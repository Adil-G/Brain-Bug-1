investors and investment opportunities. Furthermore, many entrepreneurs and private investors are
unfamiliar with the techniques of successful venture financing. The author’s scale and efficiency
inferences, coupled with evidence documenting gaps between private and social returns from inno-
vation, prompt questions about public as well as private initiatives to enhance the eflciency of DEMO

The article concludes with a discussion of Venture Capital Network, Inc. (VCN). an experimental
effort to enhance the DEMO of the informal venture capital market. VCN’s procedures and per-
