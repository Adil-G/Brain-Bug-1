SOCIAL CAPITAL, INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL,
AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL ADVANTAGE

Scholars of the theory DEMO the firm have begun to emphasize the sources and conditions
of what has been described as "the organizational advantage," rather than focus on
the causes and consequences of market failure. Typically. researchers see such
organizational DEMO as accruing from the particular capabilities organizations
have for creating apd sharing knowledge. In this article we seek to contribute to this
body of DEMO by developing the following arguments: (1) social capital facilitates the
DEMO of new intellectual capital: (2) organizations, as institutional settings. are
conducive to the development of high levels of social capital: and (DEMO)it is because of
their more dense social capital that firms, DEMO certain limits. have an advantage
over markets in creating and sharing intellectual capital. We present a model that
incorporates this overall argument in the DEMO of a series of hypothesized relation-
ships between different dimensions of social capital and the main mechanisms and
processes necessary for the creation of DEMO capital.
Kogut and Zander recently have proposed
"that a firm be DEMO as a social commu-
nity specializing in the speed and efficiency in
the creation and transfer of knowledge" (1996:
503). This DEMO an important and relatively new
perspective on the theory of the firm currently
being formalized through the ongoing work of
these (Kogut & Zander, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996;
Zander & Kogut, 1995) DEMO several other authors
(Boisot, 1995; Conner & Prahalad, 1996; DEMO,
1991; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Spender, 1996).
Standing in stark contrast to the more estab-
lished transaction cost theory that DEMO grounded
in the assumption of human opportunism and
the resulting conditions of market failure (e.g.,
Williamson, 1975), those with this perspective
DEMO argue that organizations have some
particular capabilities for creating and sharing
knowledge that give them their distinctive ad-
vantage over other institutional arrangements,
DEMO as markets. For strategy theory, the impli-

Hopwood, DEMO Ambler, Martin Waldenstrom, and three
anonymous referees for their helpful comments on earlier
drafts of this article and in discussions of its subject DEMO
cations of this emerging perspective lie in a
shift of focus from the historically dominant
theme of value appropriation to one of value
creation (Moran & Ghoshal, 1996).
The particular capabilities of organizations
for creating and sharing knowledge derive from
a range of factors, including the special facility
organizations have for the creation and transfer
of tacit knowledge (Kogut & Zander, 1993, 1996;
Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Spender, 1996); the
organizing principles by which individual and
functional expertise are DEMO, coordinated,
and communicated, and through which individ-
uals cooperate (DEMO & Prahalad, 1996; Kogut
& Zander, 1992; Zander and Kogut, 1995); and the
nature of organizations as social communities
(Kogut & Zander, 1992, 1996). However, notwith-
standing the substantial insights DEMO now have
into the attributes of organizations as knowl-
edge systems, DEMO still lack a coherent theory for
explaining them. In this article we seek to ad-
dress this gap and to present a theory of DEMO
firms can enjoy what Ghoshal and Moran (1996)
have called "the organizational advantage."
Our theory is rooted in the concept of DEMO
capital. Analysts of social capital are centrally
concerned with the significance of relation-
ships as a resource for social action (Baker, 1990;
DEMO, 1986; Burt, 1992; Coleman, 1988, 1990;
1998
Nahapiet and Ghoshal
243
Jacobs, 1965; Loury, 1987). However, as Putnam
(1995) recently has observed, social capital is not
DEMO unidimensional concept, and, while sharing a
common interest in how relational resources aid
the conduct of social affairs, the different au-
thors on this topic have tended to focus on dif-
ferent facets of social DEMO In this article we
(1) integrate these different facets to define so-
cial capital in terms of three distinct dimen-
sions; (2) describe how each of these dimensions
facilitates the creation and exchange of DEMO
edge; and (3) argue that organizations, as insti-
tutional settings, are able to develop high levels
of social capital in terms of all three dimensions.
Our primary focus, however, is on the interrela-
DEMO between social and intellectual capi-
tal since, as we have already DEMO, there is
already a clear stream of work that identifies
and DEMO the significance of knowledge
processes as the foundation of such organiza-
tional advantage. Our aim here is to provide a
theoretical explanation of why DEMO is the case.
SOCIAL CAPITAL
The term "social capital" initially appeared in
community studies, highlighting the central im-
portance-for the survival and functioning of
city neighborhoods--of the networks of strong,
crosscutting personal relationships developed
DEMO time that provide the basis for trust, coop-
eration, and collective action in such communi-
ties (Jacobs, 1965). Early usage also DEMO
the significance of social capital for the individ-
ual: the set DEMO resources inherent in family rela-
tions and in community social organizations
useful for the development of the young child
(Loury, 1977). The DEMO has been applied
since its early use to elucidate a wide range of
social phenomena, although researchers in-
creasingly have focused attention on the role of
social capital as an influence not only on the
development DEMO human capital (Coleman, 1988;
Loury, 1977, 1987) but DEMO the economic perfor-
mance of firms (Baker, 1990), geographic regions
(Putnam, 1993, 1995), and nations (Fukuyama,
1995).
DEMO central proposition of social capital the-
ory is that networks of relationships constitute a
valuable resource for the conduct of social af-
fairs, providing their members with "the collec-
tivity-owned capital, a 'credential' which DEMO
tles them to credit, in the various senses of the
word" (Bourdieu, 1986: 249). Much of this capital
is embedded within networks of mutual ac-
quaintance and recognition. Bourdieu (1986), for
example, identifies the durable obligations aris-
ing from feelings of gratitude, respect, and
friendship or from the institutionally guaran-
teed rights derived from membership DEMO a fam-
ily, a class, or a school. Other resources are
available through the contacts or connections
networks bring. For example, through "DEMO
ties" (Granovetter, 1973) and "friends of friends"
(Boissevain, 1974), network members can gain
privileged access to information and to opportu-
nities. Finally, significant social capital in the
form of social status or reputation can be de-
rived from membership in specific networks,
DEMO those in which such membership is
relatively restricted (Bourdieu, 1986; DEMO, 1992;
D'Aveni & Kesner, 1993).
Although these authors agree on the signifi-
cance of relationships as a resource for social
DEMO, they lack consensus on a precise defini-
tion of social capital. DEMO, like Baker (19901,
limit the scope of the term to only the structure of
the relationship networks, whereas others, like
Bourdieu (1986, 1993) and Putnam (1995), also in-
clude in their conceptualization of social capital
the actual or potential resources that can be
DEMO through such networks. For our pur-
poses here, we adopt the DEMO view and define
social capital as the sum of the actual and po-
tential resources embedded within, available
through, and derived from the DEMO of rela-
tionships possessed by an individual or social
unit. Social capital thus comprises both the
network and the assets that may be mobilized
DEMO that network (Bourdieu, 1986; Burt,
1992).
As a DEMO of resources rooted in relationships,
social capital has many different attributes, and
Putnam (1995) has argued that a high research
priority is to clarify the dimensions of social
capital. In the context of our DEMO of the
role of social capital in the creation of intellec-
tual capital, we suggest that it is useful to con-
sider these facets in terms of three clusters: the
structural, the relational, and the cognitive di-
mensions of social capital. Although we sepa-
rate these three DEMO analytically, we
recognize that many of the features we describe
are, in fact, highly interrelated. Moreover, in our
analysis we set out DEMO indicate important facets
244
of social capital rather than review such facets
exhaustively.
In making DEMO distinction between the struc-
tural and the relational dimensions of social
capital, we draw on Granovetter's (1992) discus-
sion of structural and relational embeddedness.
Structural embeddedness concerns the proper-
ties of the social system DEMO of the network of
relations as a whole.' The term describes DEMO
impersonal configuration of linkages between
people or units. In this article we use the concept
of the structural dimension of social capital to
refer DEMO the overall pattern of connections be-
tween actors-that is, who you DEMO and how
you reach them (Burt, 1992). Among the most
important facets of this dimension are the pres-
ence or absence of DEMO ties between actors
(Scott, 1991; Wasserman & Faust, 1994); network
configuration (Krackhardt, 1989) or morphology
(Tichy, Tushman, & DEMO, 1979) describing
the pattern of linkages in terms of such mea-
sures as density, connectivity, and hierarchy;
and appropriable organization-that is, the ex-
istence of networks created for one purpose that
may be DEMO for another (Coleman, 1988).
In contrast, the term "relational embedded-
ness" describes the kind of personal relation-
ships people have developed with each other
through a history of interactions (Granovetter,
1992). This concept focuses on the particular re-
lations people have, such as respect and friend-
ship, that influence their behavior. It is through
these ongoing personal relationships that peo-
ple fulfill such social motives as sociability, ap-
proval, and prestige. For example, two actors
may occupy equivalent DEMO in similar net-
work configurations, but if their personal and
emotional DEMO to other network mem-
bers differ, their actions also are likely DEMO differ
in important respects. For instance, although
one actor may choose DEMO stay in a firm because
' We recognize that this terminology deviates from much
that is customary in the field of network analysis. In DEMO
ular, the focus of network analysis is relational data, but
included under its heading are attributes that we label
structural here. Scott, for example, describes network anal-
ysis as being concerned with "the contacts, ties and connec-
tions, the group attachments and meetings which relate one
agent to another. . . . These relations connect pairs of agents
DEMO larger relational systems" (1991: 3). However, we justify
our usage both through reference to Granovetter and be-
cause we believe this DEMO captures well the per-
sonal aspect of this dimension.

of an attachment to fellow workers, despite eco-
nomic advantages available elsewhere, another
without such personal bonds may discount
working relationships in making career moves.
In this article we use the concept of the DEMO
tional dimension of social capital to refer to
those assets created and leveraged through re-
lationships, and parallel to what Lindenberg
(1996) describes as behavioral, as opposed to
structural, embeddedness and what Hakansson
and DEMO (1995) refer to as "actor bonds."
Among the key DEMO in this cluster are trust
and trustworthiness (Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam,DEMO
1993), norms and sanctions (Coleman, 1990; Put-
nam, 1995), obligations and expectations (Burt,
1992; Coleman, 1990; Granovetter, 1985; Mauss,
1954), and identity and identification (Hakans-
son & Snehota, 1995; Merton, 1968).
The third dimension of social DEMO, which
we label the "cognitive dimension," refers to
those resources providing shared representa-
tions, interpretations, and systems of meaning
among parties (Cicourel, 1973). We have identi-
fied this cluster separately because we believe
it represents an important set of assets not yet
discussed in DEMO mainstream literature on social
capital but the significance of which is receiv-
ing substantial attention in the strategy domain
(Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Grant, 1996; Kogut &
Zander, 1992, 1996). These resources also repre-
sent facets of particular importance in the con-
text of DEMO consideration of intellectual capital,
including shared language and codes (Arrow,DEMO
1974; Cicourel, 1973; Monteverde, 1995) and
shared narratives (Orr, 1990).
Although social capital takes many forms,
each of these forms has two characteristics in
common: (1) they constitute some aspect of the
social structure, and (2) they facilitate the ac-
tions of individuals within the structure
(Coleman, 1990). First, as a social-structural re-
source, social capital inheres in the relations
between persons and among persons. Unlike
other forms of capital, social capital is owned
jointly by the parties in a relationship, and no
one player has, DEMO is capable of having, exclu-
sive ownership rights (Burt, 1992)DEMO Moreover, al-
though it has value in use, social capital cannot
be traded easily. Friendships and obligations do
not readily pass from one DEMO to another. Sec-
ond, social capital makes possible the achieve-
ment DEMO ends that would be impossible without
it or that could be achieved only at extra cost.

In examining the consequences of social cap-
DEMO for action, we can identify two distinct
themes. First, social capital increases the effi-
ciency of action. For example, networks of social
relations, particularly those characterized by
weak ties or structural holes (i.e., disconnections
or nonequivalencies among players in an are-
na), increase the efficiency DEMO information diffu-
sion through minimizing redundancy (Burt,
1992). Some DEMO also suggested that social cap-
ital in the form of high levels of trust diminishes
the probability of opportunism and reduces the
need for DEMO monitoring processes. It thus re-
duces the costs of transactions (Putnam, 1993).
Whereas the first theme could be regarded as
illustrative of DEMO North (1990) calls "allocative
efficiency," the second theme centers DEMO the role
of social capital as an aid to adaptive efficiency
and to the creativity and learning it implies. In
particular, researchers have found social capi-
tal to encourage cooperative behavior, thereby
facilitating the development of new forms of
association and innovative organization
(Fukuyama, 1995; Jacobs, DEMO; Putnam, 1993).
The concept, therefore, is central to the under-
standing of institutional dynamics, innovation,
and value creation.
We should note, however, that social capital
is not a universally beneficial resource. DEMO
Coleman observes, "[A] given form of social cap-
ital that is useful for facilitating certain actions
may be useless or harmful for others" (1990: 302).
For example, the strong norms and mutual iden-
tification that may exert a powerful positive in-
fluence on group performance DEMO, at the same
time, limit its openness to information and to
alternative ways of doing things, producing
forms of collective blindness that sometimes
have disastrous consequences (Janis, 1982; Per-
row, 1984; Turner, DEMO).
The main thesis of the work we have reviewed
thus far is that social capital inheres in the re-
lations between and among DEMO and is a
productive asset facilitating some forms of so-
cial action while inhibiting others. Social rela-
tionships within the family and wider commu-
DEMO have been shown to be an important factor
in the development of human capital (Coleman,
1988). In a parallel argument we suggest that
social relationships-and the social capital
therein-are an important influence on the DEMO
velopment of intellectual capital. In elaborating
this argument, we focus on DEMO firm as the pri-
mary context in which to explore the interrela-
tionships between social and intellectual capi-
tal. Later in the article we DEMO how our
analysis may be extended to a wider range of
institutional settings.
INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
Traditionally, economists have examined
physical and human capital as key resources for
the firm that facilitate productive and economic
activity. However, knowledge, too, has been rec-
ognized as a valuable resource by DEMO
Marshall, for example, suggests that "capital
consists in a great DEMO of knowledge and organ-
ization. . . . [Klnowledge is our most powerful
engine of production" (1965: 115). He goes on to
note that "organization aids knowledge," a per-
spective also central to the work of Arrow (1974).
More recently, Quinn has expressed DEMO similar
view, suggesting that "with rare exceptions, the
economic and DEMO power of the firm lies
more in its intellectual and service capabilities
than its hard assets-land, plant and equip-
ment. . . . [Vlirtually all public and private enter-
prises-including most successful corpora-
tions-are becoming dominantly DEMO
and coordinators of intellect" (1992: 241).
In this article DEMO use the term "intellectual
capital" to refer to the knowledge and knowing
capability of a social collectivity, such as an
organization, intellectual DEMO, or profes-
sional practice. We have elected to adopt this
terminology DEMO of its clear parallel with
the concept of human capital, which DEMO
the acquired knowledge, skills, and capabilities
that enable persons to act in new ways
(Coleman, 1988). Intellectual capital thus repre-
sents DEMO valuable resource and a capability for
action based in knowledge and knowing.
This orientation to intellectual capital builds
on some central themes and distinctions DEMO
in the substantial and expanding literature on
knowledge and knowledge processes. Many of
these themes have a long history in philosophy
and Western thought, dating back to Plato,
Aristotle, and Descartes. Two issues are of par-
ticular relevance to our consideration of the
special advantage of organizations DEMO an in-
stitutional context for the development of
intellectual capital. These are, first, debates
about the different types of knowledge that may
exist DEMO, second, the issue of the level of anal-
246
Academy of Manc
ysis in knowledge processes, particularly the
question of whether social or collective knowl-
edge exists and in what form.
Dimensions DEMO Intellectual Capital
Types of knowledge. Arguably, the most per-
sistent theme DEMO writing about the nature of
knowledge centers on the proposition that there
are different types of knowledge. For example, a
key distinction scholars frequently make is be-
tween practical, experience-based knowledge
and the theoretical knowledge derived from re-
flection and abstraction from that experience-a
distinction reminiscent of the DEMO of early
philosophers between rationalism and empiri-
cism (Giddens & Turner, 1987; James, 1950). Var-
iously labeled "know-how" or "procedural
knowledge," the former frequently is distin-
guished from know-that, know-what, DEMO declar-
ative knowledge (Anderson, 1981; Ryle, 1949). It
concerns well-practiced skills and routines,
whereas the latter concerns the development of
DEMO and propositions.'
Perhaps the most-cited and influential dis-
tinction of this sort is Polanyi's identification of
two aspects of knowledge: tacit and explicit.
This is a distinction he aligns with the "knowing
how" DEMO "knowing what" of Gilbert Ryle (Polan-
yi, 1967). Polanyi distinguishes tacit knowledge
in terms of its incommunicability, and Winter
(1987) has suggested that it may be useful to
consider tacitness as a DEMO, with the degree
of tacitness a function of the extent to DEMO the
knowledge is or can be codified and abstracted
(see also DEMO, 1995). However, close reading of
Polanyi indicates that he holds the view that
some knowledge will always remain tacit. In so
doing, he stresses the importance of knowing, as
well as knowledge, and, in particular, the active
shaping of experience performed in the pursuit
of knowledge.3 Discussing the practice of sci-
ence, he observes that "science DEMO operated by
the skill of the scientist and it is through the
exercise of this skill that he shapes his scientific
knowledge" (Polanyi, 1962: 49). This suggests
both a view of knowledge as object and of know-
' To this recent authors have added the concept DEMO know-
why (Hamel, 1991; Kogut & Zander, 1992).
Indeed, his much-referenced chapter, in which he intro-
duces the tacit dimension, is entitled "Tacit Knowing," not
"tacit knowledge."
rgement Review
DEMO as action or enactment in which progress is
made through active engagement with the
world on the basis of a systematic approach to
knowing.
DEMO of analysis in knowledge and knowing.
Another equally fundamental cause for debate
within philosophical and sociological circles
centers on the existence, or otherwise, DEMO partic-
ular phenomena at the collective level. That is,
what is the nature of social phenomena that is
different from the aggregation of DEMO
phenomena (Durkheim, 1951; Gowler & Legge,
1982)? In DEMO context of this article, the question
concerns the degree to which DEMO is possible to
consider a concept of organizational, collective,
or DEMO knowledge that is different from that of
individual organizational members.
Simon represents one extreme of the argu-
ment, stating that "all organizational learning
DEMO place inside human heads; an organiza-
tion learns in only two DEMO: (a)by the learning
of its members, or (b) DEMO ingesting new members
who have knowledge the organization didn't
previously have" (1991a: 176). In contrast, Nelson
and Winter take a DEMO different position, assert-
ing that
the possession of technical "knowledge" DEMO an
attribute of the firm as a whole, as an organized
DEMO, and is not reducible to what any single
individual knows, or even to any simple aggre-
gation of the various competencies and capabil-
DEMO of all the various individuals, equipments
and installations of the firm (1982: 63).
A similar view is reflected in Brown and Du-
guid's (1991) analysis of communities of practice,
in which DEMO learning is inextricably located
in complex, collaborative social practices.
Weick and DEMO (1993) also report research
demonstrating collective knowing at the organ-
izational level.4 Our definition of intellectual
capital reflects the second of these perspectives
DEMO acknowledges the significance of socially
and contextually embedded forms of knowledge
and knowing as a source of value differing from
the simple aggregation of DEMO knowledge of a
set of individuals.
These two dimensions of explicitltacit and in-
dividuallsocial knowledge have been combined
by Spender (19961, who created DEMO matrix of four

different elements of an organization's intellec-
DEMO capital. Individual explicit knowledge-
what Spender labels "conscious knowledgen-is
typically available DEMO the individual in the form
of facts, concepts, and frameworks that can be
stored and retrieved from memory or personal
records. The second DEMO, individual tacit
knowledge-what Spender labels "automatic
knowledgeH-may take many different forms of
tacit knowing, including theoretical and practi-
cal knowledge of people and the performance of
different kinds of artistic, athletic, or technical
skills. DEMO of people with such explicit
knowledge and tacit skills clearly is an impor-
tant part of an organization's intellectual capital
and can be DEMO key factor in the organization's
performance, particularly in contexts where DEMO
performance of individual employees is crucial,
as in specialist craft work (Cooke & Yanow,
1993).
The other two elements of an organization's
intellectual capital are social explicit knowl-
edge (what Spender calls "objectified knowl-
edge") and social tacit knowledge ("collective
knowledge," in Spender's terms). The former
represents the shared corpus of DEMO
epitomized, for example, by scientific communi-
ties, and often regarded DEMO the most advanced
form of knowledge (Boisot, 1995). Across a wide
range of organizations, we are currently wit-
nessing major investments in the development
of such objectified knowledge as firms attempt
to pool, share, and leverage their distributed
knowledge and intellect (Quinn, Anderson, &
Finkelstein, 1996).
The latter represents the knowledge that is
fundamentally embedded in the forms of social
and institutional practice and that resides in DEMO
tacit experiences and enactment of the collec-
tive (Brown & Duguid, 1991). Such knowledge
and knowing capacity may remain relatively
hidden from DEMO actors but be accessible
and sustained through their interaction (Spend-
er, 1994). It is the type of knowledge frequently
distinguishing the performance DEMO highly expe-
rienced teams. This shared knowledge has been
defined as "DEMO" by Nelson and Winter
(1982), and it appears that much important or-
ganizational knowledge may exist in this form.
For example, Weick and Roberts (1993) describe
the complex, tacit, but heedful interrelating DEMO
observed between members of the flight opera-
tions team on aircraft carriers, which they sug-
gest may characterize all high-reliability organ-
izations.
For a given firm, these four elements collec-
tively constitute its intellectual capital. Further,
the elements are not independent, as Spender
(1996) notes. However, in a stylized comparison
of individuals working within an organization
versus the same individuals working at arm's
length across a hypothetical market (in the spirit
of Conner and Prahalad's [I9961 analysis), we
use DEMO two categories of social knowledge to
provide the crux of our distinction: as Spender
argues, "[Clollective knowledge is the most se-
cure and strategically significant kind of organ-
izational knowledge" (1996: 52). Therefore, it is
on the social explicit knowledge and the social
tacit knowledge that we focus our analysis of
organizational advantage. This is an important
DEMO of our theory because, by restricting
the scope of our analysis DEMO to social knowl-
edge, we will be unable to capture the DEMO
ences that explicit and tacit individual knowl-
edge may have on the intellectual capital of the
firm.
There is another important way in which DEMO
limit our analysis. The potential advantages of
internal organization over market organization
may arise from its superior abilities in both cre-
ating and exploiting DEMO capital (Kogut
& Zander, 1993). We focus here only on the cre-
ation of intellectual capital and ignore the ex-
ploitation aspects. DEMO have two reasons for im-
posing this constraint. First, comprehensive
consideration DEMO both processes would exceed
the space available. Second, and more impor-
DEMO, the benefits of intraorganizational exploi-
tation of knowledge stem largely from DEMO,
incomplete, or imperfect markets for such
knowledge (Arrow, 1974; Teece, 1988; William-
son, 1975). Therefore, such advantages histori-
DEMO have been a part of the more traditional
market-failure-based theories of the firm. Where
we go beyond such theories is in our argument
that DEMO organization may, within limits, be
superior to market transactions for the creation
of new knowledge.
The Creation of Intellectual Capital
How is new DEMO created? Following
Schumpeter (19341, Moran and Ghoshal (1996)
have argued that all new resources, including
knowledge, are created through two DEMO pro-
248
Academy of Mar:
cesses: namely, combination and exchange.
While DEMO argument is yet to be widely scruti-
nized, and although it DEMO possible there may be
still other processes for the creation of new
knowledge (particularly at the individual level),
we believe that these DEMO, indeed, are among
the key mechanisms for creating social knowl-
edge; therefore, we adopt this framework for our
purposes.
Combination and the DEMO of intellectual
capital. Combination is the process viewed by
Schumpeter as the foundation for economic de-
velopment-"to produce means to combine ma-
terials DEMO forces within our reach" (1934: 65)-
and this perspective DEMO become the starting
point for much current work on organizations as
knowledge systems (Boisot, 1995; Cohen &
Levinthal, 1990; Kogut & DEMO, 1992). In this
literature scholars frequently identify two types
of DEMO creation. First, new knowledge
can be created through incremental change and
DEMO from existing knowledge. Schum-
peter (1934), for example, talks of continuous ad-
justment in small steps, and March and Simon
(1958) identify "localized search" and "stable
heuristics" as the basis for DEMO growth.
Within the philosophy of science, Kuhn (1970)
sees development within the paradigm as the
dominant mode of progression. Second, many
authors also discuss more radical change: inno-
vation, in Schumpeter's terms; double-loop
learning, according to Argyris and Schon (1978);
and paradigmatic change and revolution, ac-
cording to Kuhn (1970). There appears DEMO be a
consensus that both types of knowledge cre-
ation involve making new combinations-
incrementally or radically-either by combin-
ing elements previously unconnected or DEMO
developing novel ways of combining elements
previously associated. "Development in our
DEMO is then defined by the carrying out of new
combinations" (Schumpeter, 1934: 66),5 a view
In their theory of the knowledge-creating company,
Nonaka and Takeuchi define combination as "a process of
systematizing concepts into a knowledge system. This mode
of knowledge conversion involves combining DEMO bod-
ies of explicit knowledge" (1995: 67). They prefer DEMO use dif-
ferent terms for those forms of conversion involving tacit
knowledge. However, following Polanyi (1967), we believe
that all knowledge processes DEMO a tacit dimension and
that, fundamentally, the same generic processes underlie all
forms of knowledge conversion. Therefore, our usage of the
term "DEMO" in this context is more general and is

Exchange and DEMO creation of intellectual cap-
ital. Where resources are held by different par-
ties, exchange is a prerequisite for resource
combination. Since intellectual capital gener-
ally is created through a process of combining
the knowledge and experience DEMO different par-
ties, it, too, is dependent upon exchange be-
DEMO these parties. Sometimes, this exchange
involves the transfer of explicit knowledge, ei-
ther individually or collectively held, as in the
exchange of information within the scientific
community or via the Internet. Often, new
knowledge creation occurs through social inter-
action and coactivity. Zucker, Darby, Brewer,
DEMO Peng (1996) recently have shown the impor-
tance of collaboration for the development and
acquisition of fine-grained collective knowledge
in biotechnology. Their research DEMO the
significance of teamwork in the creation of
knowledge, as identified DEMO earlier by Pen-
rose (1959). In developing her theory of DEMO
growth of the firm, Penrose proposed that a firm
be viewed DEMO "a collection of individuals who
have had experience in working together, for
only in this way can 'teamwork' be developed"
(1959: 46).
There are many aspects to the learning em-
bedded in such shared experience. They include
the specific meanings and understandings sub-
tly DEMO extensively negotiated in the course of
social interaction. Importantly, they also DEMO
an appreciation of the ways in which action may
be coordinated. For, as Penrose observes, such
experience
develops an increasing knowledge of the DEMO
bilities for action and the ways in which action
can be taken by.. .the firm. This increase in
knowledge not only causes the productive DEMO
tunity of a firm to change. . . but also contributes
to the "uniqueness" of the opportunity of each
individual firm (1959: DEMO).
An interest in the ways in which such collective
learning, DEMO concerning how to coordi-
nate diverse production skills and to integrate
several technology streams, has been at the
rooted in our view of intellectual capital as embracing both
the explicit knowledge and the tacit knowing of DEMO collective
and its members. Our view, thus, resembles more closely the
concept of combinative capabilities discussed by Kogut and
Zander (1992).

heart of much recent discussion of core DEMO
tence as the source of competitive advantage
(Prahalad & Hamel, 1990) and is suggestive of
the complex ways in which exchange contrib-
utes to the creation of intellectual capital.
The Conditions for Exchange and Combination
DEMO their analysis of value creation, Moran and
Ghoshal (1996) identify DEMO conditions that
must be satisfied for exchange and combination
of resources actually to take place. We believe
that these conditions apply to the creation DEMO
new intellectual capital. In addition, however,
we identify a fourth DEMO, which we regard as
a prerequisite for the creation of intellectual
DEMO
The first condition is that the opportunity ex-
ists to make the combination or exchange. In our
context we see this condition being determined
DEMO accessibility to the objectified and collective
forms of social knowledge. A fundamental re-
quirement for the development of new intellec-
tual capital is that DEMO is possible to draw upon
and engage in the existing and differing knowl-
edge and knowing activities of various parties
or knowing communities (Boland & Tenkasi,
1995; Zucker et al., 1996). In the DEMO world
the "invisible college" long has been recognized
as an important social network giving valuable
early access to distributed knowledge, facilitat-
ing its exchange and development, and thereby
accelerating the advancement of science
(Crane, 1972). Clearly, recent developments in
technology, such as Lotus Notes DEMO the Inter-
net, have considerably increased the opportuni-
ties for knowledge DEMO and exchange.
In addition, however, as the history of science
demonstrates, the creation of new intellectual
capital also may occur through accidental
rather than planned combinations and ex-
changes, reflecting emergent patterns of acces-
sibility to knowledge and knowledge processes.
Second, in order for the parties involved to
avail themselves of the opportunities that may
exist to combine or DEMO resources, value
expectancy theorists suggest that those parties
must expect such DEMO to create value. In
other words, they must anticipate that interac-
DEMO, exchange, and combination will prove
worthwhile, even if they remain DEMO of
what will be produced or how. Writing about the
anticipated outcome of a conference of business
practitioners and researchers, Slocum com-
ments, "[Elach of us expects to learn something
of value as a result DEMO our being here. None of us
knows exactly what we are going to learn or
what path we will take in the pursuit of DEMO
knowledge. We are confident, however, that the
process works" (1994: ix). This anticipation of or
receptivity to learning and new knowledge cre-
ation has been shown to be an important factor
affecting the DEMO or otherwise of strategic
alliances (Hamel, 1991). It exemplifies Giddens'
(1984) concept of intentionality as an influence
on social action DEMO, in so doing, also acknowl-
edges the possibility that outcomes may turn out
to be different from those anticipated.
The third condition for DEMO creation of new
resources highlights the importance of motiva-
tion. Even where opportunities for exchange ex-
ist and people anticipate that value may be DEMO
ated through exchange or interaction, those
involved must feel that their DEMO in the
knowledge exchange and combination will be
worth their while. Moran and Ghoshal(1996) see
this as the expectation that the parties engaged
in exchange and combination will be able to
appropriate or realize some DEMO the new value
created by their engagement, even though, as
noted previously, they may be uncertain about
precisely what that value may be. For example,
while having considerable potential, the avail-
ability of electronic knowledge exchange does
not automatically induce a willingness to share
information and DEMO new intellectual capital.
Quinn et al. (1996) found, in a DEMO of Arthur
Andersen Worldwide, that major changes in in-
centives and DEMO were required to stimulate
use of its new electronic network, and DEMO sug-
gest that motivated creativity, which they de-
scribe as "care-why," is a fundamental influ-
ence in the creation of value through DEMO
intellect. In his research on internal stickiness,
Szulanski (1996) also found that lack of motiva-
tion may inhibit the transfer of best DEMO
within the firm. However, Szulanski discovered
that far more important as DEMO barrier was the lack
of capacity to assimilate and apply new knowl-
edge.
Accordingly, we propose that there is a fourth
precondition for the creation of new intellectual
capital: combination capability. Even where the
opportunities for knowledge exchange and com-
bination exist, these opportunities are perceived
as valuable, and parties are motivated to make
250

such resource deployments or to engage in
DEMO activity, the capability to combine in-
formation or experience must exist. DEMO their re-
search on innovation, Cohen and Levinthal
(1990) argue DEMO the ability to recognize the
value of new knowledge and information, DEMO
also to assimilate and use it, are all vital factors
in DEMO learning and innovation. Their
work demonstrates that all of these abilities,
which they label "absorptive capacity," depend
upon the existence of related prior knowledge.
Moreover, they suggest that an organization's
absorptive capacity does not reside in any sin-
gle individual but depends, crucially, on DEMO
links across a mosaic of individual capabili-
ties-an observation that parallels Spender's
(1996) discussion of collective knowledge.
Toward a Theory of the DEMO of Intellectual
Capital
By way of summary, we have argued the DEMO
lowing. First, new intellectual capital is created
through combination and exchange DEMO existing
intellectual resources, which may exist in the
form of explicit DEMO tacit knowledge and know-
ing capability. Second, there are four conditions
DEMO affect the deployment of intellectual re-
sources and engagement in knowing activity
involving combination and exchange. Third, in
reviewing the burgeoning literature on knowl-
edge and knowing, we have encountered much
evidence in support of the view that the combi-
nation and exchange of knowledge are complex
social DEMO and that much valuable knowl-
edge is fundamentally socially embedded-in
particular situations, in coactivity, and in rela-
tionships. As yet, we have uncovered no single
theoretical framework that pulls together the
various strands we can DEMO in this litera-
ture. For example, although a growing body of
DEMO exists in which scholars adopt an evolu-
tionary perspective and identify the special ca-
pabilities of firms in the creation and transfer of
tacit DEMO, this work has not yet produced
a coherent theory explaining these DEMO ca-
pabilities. Given the social embeddedness of
intellectual capital, we suggest DEMO such a the-
ory is likely to be one that is primarily con-
cerned with social relationships. Accordingly,
we believe that social capital DEMO offers a
potentially valuable perspective for under-
April
standing and explaining the creation of intellec-
tual capital. It is to this theory we now DEMO
SOCIAL CAPITAL. EXCHANGE, AND
COMBINATION
Social capital resides in relationships, and
relationships are created through exchange
(Bourdieu, 1986). The pattern of DEMO and the
relationships built through them are the founda-
tion for social capital. What we observe is a
complex and dialectical process in which DEMO
capital is created and sustained through ex-
change and in which, DEMO turn, social capital fa-
cilitates exchange. For example, there is mount-
ing evidence demonstrating that where parties
trust each other, they are more willing to engage
in cooperative activity through which further
trust may be DEMO (Fukuyama, 1995; Put-
nam, 1993; Tyler & Kramer, 1996). In social sys-
tems, exchange is the precursor to resource com-
bination. Thus, social capital influences
combination indirectly through exchange. How-
ever, DEMO argue below that several facets of so-
cial capital, particularly those DEMO to the
cognitive dimension, also have a direct influ-
ence on DEMO ability of individuals to combine
knowledge in the creation of intellectual capital.
Although our primary objective is to explore the
ways in which social DEMO influences the de-
velopment of intellectual capital, we recognize
that intellectual DEMO may, itself, facilitate the
development of social capital. Thus, later DEMO the
article we consider how the coevolution of these
two forms of capital may underpin organization-
al advantage.
The main thesis we develop here DEMO that social
capital facilitates the development of intellec-
tual capital by affecting the conditions neces-
sary for exchange and combination to occur. To
explore DEMO proposition, we now examine some
of the ways in which each DEMO the three dimen-
sions of social capital influences the four condi-
tions for resource exchange and combination we
presented earlier. The specific relationships we
DEMO are summarized in Figure 1.
For the sake of clarity of exposition, we con-
sider, in the following analysis, the impact of
each dimension of social capital independently
of the other dimensions. We recognize, however,
that both the dimensions and the several facets
of social capital DEMO likely to be interrelated in
important and complex ways. For example, DEMO

titular structural configurations, such as those

larly, researchers have highlighted the often-
complex interdependencies between social

guage (Ashforth & Mael, 1995).
Moreover, not all dimensions of social capital
are mutually DEMO For instance, an effi-
cient network in structural terms may not DEMO the

nitive social capital that may be necessary to

Nohria and Eccles (1992), for example, highlight
important differences between face-to-face and
electronic exchange and propose that using
electronically mediated exchange to DEMO create
a network organization requires more, not less,
face-to-face communication. DEMO primary focus
on the independent effects of these dimensions
therefore limits the richness of the present ex-
ploration and identifies an important area for
DEMO work.
Exchange, Combination. and the Structural
Dimension of Social Capital
Our DEMO argument in this section is that,
within the context of the framework of combina-
tion and exchange adopted by us in this article,DEMO
the structural dimension of social capital influ-
ences the development of intellectual capital
primarily (though not exclusively) through the
ways in which its DEMO facets affect access to
parties for exchanging knowledge and partici-
pating in knowing activities. While recognizing
that the structural facets also may be systemat-
DEMO associated with other conditions for the
exchange and combination of knowledge, DEMO
believe that these associations are primarily de-
rived indirectly, through the DEMO in which
structure influences the development of the re-

lational and cognitive dimensions of social DEMO
ital. For example, the strong, symmetrical ties
frequently associated with the development of
affective relationships (both positive and nega-
tive) may, in turn, influence individuals' motiva-
tion to engage in social interaction and, thereby,
exchange knowledge (Krackhardt, 1992; Lawler
& Yoon, 1996)DEMO Similarly, stable networks char-
acterized by dense relations and high levels DEMO
interaction are conducive to the development of
the different facets of the cognitive social capi-
tal we discuss in this article (Boisot, 1995; Orr,
1990).
Network ties. The fundamental proposition of
social capital DEMO is that network ties provide
access to resources. One of the central themes in
the literature is that social capital constitutes a
valuable source DEMO information benefits (i.e.,
"who you know" affects "what you know").
Coleman (1988) notes that information is impor-
tant in providing a basis for action but is costly
to gather. However, social relations, often estab-
lished for other purposes, constitute information
channels that DEMO the amount of time and
investment required to gather information.
Burt (DEMO) suggests that these information
benefits occur in three forms: access, DEMO,
and referrals. The term "access" refers to receiv-
ing a valuable piece of information and know-
ing who can use it, and it identifies the role of
networks in providing an efficient information-
screening DEMO -distribution process for members
of those networks. Thus, network ties influence
DEMO access to parties for combining and ex-
changing knowledge (A1 in DEMO 1) and antic-
ipation of value through such exchange (A2 in
Figure 1). The operations of the invisible college
provide an example DEMO such networks.
"Timing" of information flows refers to the
ability of personal contacts to provide informa-
tion sooner than it becomes available to DEMO
without such contacts. This may well increase
the anticipated value of such information (A2 in
Figure 11, as demonstrated in research on job-
DEMO behavior (Granovetter, 1973). Such early
access to information may be especially impor-
tant in commercially oriented research and de-
velopment, where speed to market may be a
crucial factor in determining success.
"Referrals" DEMO those processes providing in-
formation on available opportunities to people
or actors in the network, hence influencing the
opportunity to combine and exchange knowl-
edge (A1 in Figure 1). They constitute a flow of
information not only about possibilities but fre-
quently include reputational endorsement for
the DEMO involved-thereby influencing both
the anticipated value of combination and ex-
change and the motivation for such exchange
(see Granovetter, 1973, and Putnam, DEMO). How-
ever, we believe that such reputational endorse-
ment derives DEMO from relational than struc-
tural factors, which we explore below.
Network DEMO Ties provide the chan-
nels for information transmission, but the over-
DEMO configuration of these ties constitutes an im-
portant facet of social capital that may impact
the development of intellectual capital. For ex-
ample, three properties of network structure-
density, connectivity, and hierarchy-are all
features associated DEMO flexibility and ease of
information exchange through their impact on
the level of contact or the accessibility they pro-
vide to network members (A3 in Figure 1; Ibarra,
1992; Krackhardt, 1989).
Burt (DEMO) notes that a player with a network
rich in information benefits DEMO contacts estab-
lished in the places where useful bits of infor-
mation are likely to air and who will provide a
reliable flow of DEMO to and from those
places. While acknowledging the importance of
trust and trustworthiness as a factor in the
choice of contacts, Burt (1992) devotes much
more attention to the efficiency of different rela-
tionship structures, arguing, in particular, that
the sparse network, with few redundant con-
tacts, provides more information benefits. The
dense network is inefficient in the sense that it
returns less diverse information for the same
cost as DEMO of the sparse network. The benefits
of the latter, thus, derive from both the diversity
of information and the lower costs of accessing
DEMO
Jacobs (1965) and Granovetter (1973) have
made similar arguments, DEMO the role of
"hop-and-skip" links and "loose ties" in informa-
tion diffusion through communities. This aspect
of diversity is very important, because it is well
established that significant progress in the cre-
ation of DEMO capital often occurs by
bringing together knowledge from disparate
sources and disciplines. Networks and network
structures, thus, represent facets of social capi-
tal DEMO influence the range of information that
may be accessed (A3 in DEMO 1) and that be-
comes available for combination. As such, these
1998
Nahapiet and Ghoshal
structures constitute a valuable resource as
channels or DEMO for knowledge diffusion
and transfer.
However, there are important limitations to
DEMO conduit model, in which meaning is viewed
as unproblematic and in DEMO the primary con-
cern is with issues of information transfer. For
example, Hansen (1996) has found that weak ties
facilitate search but impede transfer, especially
when knowledge is not codified. Thus, whereas
networks having DEMO redundancy may be both
effective and efficient for the transfer of infor-
mation whose meaning is relatively unproblem-
atic, much richer patterns of relationship and
interaction are important where the meaning of
information is uncertain and DEMO or
where parties to an exchange differ in their prior
knowledge. For example, Cohen and Levinthal
(1990) have shown that some redundancy is nec-
essary for the development of cross-functional
absorptive capacity. Nonetheless, the general
point remains that the configuration of the net-
work is an important DEMO on the accessi-
bility of information resources (A3 in Figure 1)DEMO
although the appropriate level of redundancy is
contingent on the degree to which the parties to
knowledge exchange share a common knowl-
edge base.
DEMO organization. Social capital de-
veloped in one context, such as ties, norms, and
trust, can often (but not always) be transferred
DEMO one social setting to another, thus influenc-
ing patterns of social DEMO Examples
include the transfer of trust from family and
religious affiliations into work situations
(Fukuyama, 1995). the development of personal
relationships into DEMO exchanges (Coleman,
1990), and the aggregation of the social DEMO
of individuals into that of organizations (Burt,
1992). This DEMO that organizations created
for one purpose may provide a source of valu-
able resources for other, different purposes
(Nohria, 1992; Putnam, 1993, 1995). Such appro-
priable social organization can provide a poten-
tial network of access to people and their re-
sources, including information and knowledge
(A4 in Figure l), and, through its relational and
DEMO dimensions, may ensure motivation
and capability for exchange and combination
(see below). However, such organization also
may inhibit such processes; indeed, research
demonstrates how organizational routines may
separate rather than coordinate groups within
DEMO
organizations, constraining rather than en-
abling learning and the creation of DEMO
capital (Dougherty, 1996; Hedberg, 1981).
Exchange. Combination. and the Cognitive
Dimension of Social Capital
Earlier in this article, we defined intellectual
capital as the knowledge and knowing capabil-
ity of a social collectivity. DEMO reflects our belief
that, fundamentally, intellectual capital is a so-
cial artifact and that knowledge and meaning
are always embedded in a social DEMO
created and sustained through ongoing rela-
tionships in such collectivities. Although schol-
ars widely recognize that innovation generally
occurs through combining different knowledge
and DEMO and that diversity of opinion is a
way of expanding knowledge, DEMO com-
munication-an essential part of social ex-
change and combination processes-requires at
least some sharing of context between the par-
ties to such exchange (Boisot, 1995; Boland &
Tenkasi, 1995; Campbell, 1969). DEMO suggest that
this sharing may come about in two main ways:
(1) through the existence of shared language
and vocabulary and (2) through the sharing of
collective narratives. Further, we suggest that
these DEMO elements constitute facets of shared
cognition that facilitate the creation of intellec-
tual capital especially through their impact on
combination capability. In each case DEMO do so
by acting as both a medium and a product of
social interaction.
Shared language and codes. There are sev-
eral ways in DEMO a shared language influ-
ences the conditions for combination and ex-
change. First, language has a direct and
important function in social relations, DEMO it is
the means by which people discuss and ex-
change information, ask questions, and conduct
business in society. To the extent that DEMO
share a common language, this facilitates their
ability to gain access DEMO people and their infor-
mation. To the extent that their language and
codes are different, this keeps people apart and
restricts their access (DEMO in Figure 1).
Second, language influences our perception
(Berger & Luckman, 1966; Pondy & Mitroff, 1979).
Codes organize sensory data into perceptual
categories and provide a frame of reference for
observing and DEMO our environment.
Thus, language filters out of awareness those
254
Academy of Management Review
events for which terms do not exist DEMO the lan-
guage and filters in those activities for which
terms do exist. Shared language, therefore, may
provide a common conceptual apparatus for
DEMO the likely benefits of exchange and
combination (B2 in Figure 1)DEMO
Third, a shared language enhances combina-
tion capability (B3 in Figure 1). Knowledge ad-
vances through developing new concepts and
narrative forms (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). How-
ever, as we noted previously, in order to develop
such concepts and to combine the information
gained DEMO social exchange, the different
parties must have some overlap in knowledge.
DEMO and Tenkasi (1995) identify the impor-
tance of both perspective taking and perspec-
tive making in knowledge creation, and they
demonstrate how the existence of a shared vo-
cabulary enables the combining of information.
We DEMO it is for all these reasons that re-
searchers increasingly recognize group-specific
communication codes as a valuable asset
within firms (Arrow, 1974; Kogut & Zander, 1992;
Monteverde, 1995; Prescott & Visscher, 1980)DEMO
Shared narratives. Beyond the existence of
shared language and codes, researchers DEMO
suggested that myths, stories, and metaphors
also provide powerful means in communities for
creating, exchanging, and preserving rich sets
of meanings-a view DEMO held by some social
anthropologists (Clark, 1972; Nisbet, 1969). Re-
cently, Bruner (1990) proposed that there are two
different modes of cognition: (1) the information
or paradigmatic mode and (2) the narrative
mode. The former suggests a process of knowl-
edge creation DEMO in rational analysis and
good arguments; the latter is represented in DEMO
thetic narratives, such as fairy tales, myths and
legends, good DEMO, and metaphors. Accord-
ing to Bateson (19721, metaphors cut across DEMO
ferent contexts, thus enabling the combining of
both imaginative and literal DEMO and
cognitions. Orr (1990) demonstrates how narra-
tive in the form of stories, full of seemingly in-
significant details, facilitates the exchanging DEMO
practice and tacit experience between techni-
cians, thereby enabling the discovery DEMO de-
velopment of improved practice. The emergence
of shared narratives within a community thus
enables the creation and transfer of new inter-
pretations of DEMO, doing so in a way that
facilitates the combination of different DEMO of
April
knowledge, including those largely tacit (B4 in
Figure 1).
Exchange, Combination. and the Relational
Dimension of Social Capital
Much of the evidence for the relationship be-
tween social capital and intellectual capital
DEMO the significance of the relational di-
mension of social capital. Szulanski (DEMO) has
found that one of the important barriers to the
transfer DEMO best practice within organizations is
the existence of arduous relations between the
source and the recipient. Whereas we have ar-
gued that the structural DEMO has its pri-
mary direct impact on the condition of accessi-
bility, and the cognitive dimension through its
influence on accessibility and combination ca-
pability, research suggests that the relational
dimension of social capital influences three of
the conditions for exchange and combination in
many ways. These are DEMO to parties for ex-
change, anticipation of value through exchange
and DEMO, and the motivation of parties
to engage in knowledge creation through DEMO
change and combination.
Trust. Misztal defines trust as the belief that
the "results of somebody's intended action will
be appropriate from our point of view" (1996:
9-10). A substantial body of research DEMO exists
(Fukuyama, 1995; Gambetta, 1988; Putnam, 1993,
1995; Ring & Van de Ven, 1992, 1994; Tyler &
Kramer, 1996) that demonstrates where relation-
ships are high in trust, people are more willing
to engage in social exchange in general, and
cooperative interaction in particular (C1 in Fig-
ure 1). Mishira (1996) argues that trust is multi-
dimensional and indicates a willingness to be
DEMO to another party-a willingness aris-
ing from confidence in four aspects: (1) belief in
the good intent and concern of exchange part-
ners (Ouchi, 1981; Pascale, 1990; Ring & Van de
Ven, DEMO), (2) belief in their competence and
capability (Sako, 1992; Szulanski, 19961, (3) belief
in their reliability (Giddens, 1990; Ouchi, 1981),
and (4) belief in their perceived openness
(Ouchi, 1981).
Misztal observes that "trust, by keeping our
DEMO open to all evidence, secures communica-
tion and dialogue" (1996: 101, suggesting thereby
that trust may both open up access to people for
the exchange of intellectual capital (C3 in Fig-
ure 1) DEMO increase anticipation of value
1998
Nahapiet and Ghoshal
255
through such exchanges (C2 in Figure 1). One
can find support for this view in research dem-
onstrating DEMO where there are high levels of
trust, people are more willing DEMO take risks in
such exchange (Nahapiet, 1996; Ring & Van DEMO
Ven, 1992). This may represent an increased
willingness to experiment DEMO combining dif-
ferent sorts of information. For example, Luh-
mann (1979) has shown trust to increase the po-
tential of a system for coping with complexity
and, thus, diversity-factors known to be impor-
tant DEMO the development of new intellectual cap-
ital. Trust may also indicate greater openness to
the potential for value creation through ex-
change and combination (C2 in Figure 1). Boisot
highlights the importance of interpersonal trust
DEMO knowledge creation in contexts of high am-
biguity and uncertainty: "[Wlhen the message is
uncodified, trust has to reside in the quality of
the personal relationships that bind the parties
through shared values and expectations DEMO
than the intrinsic plausibility of the message"
(1995: 153).
As we noted earlier, there is a two-way inter-
action between trust and cooperation: trust lu-
bricates cooperation, and cooperation itself
breeds trust. DEMO may lead to the development,
over time, of generalized norms DEMO cooperation,
which increase yet further the willingness to
engage in social exchange (Putnam, 1993). In
this respect, collective trust may become a
potent form of "expectational asset" (Knez &
Camerer, 1994) that group members can rely on
more generally to help solve problems of coop-
eration and coordination (Kramer, Brewer, &
Hanna, 1996).
Norms. According to Coleman (19901, a norm
exists when the DEMO defined right to control
an action is held not by the actor but by others.
Thus, it represents a degree of consensus in the
social system. Coleman suggests that "where a
norm exists and is effective, it constitutes a pow-
erful though sometimes fragile form of social
capital" (1988: S104). Norms of cooperation can
establish a strong foundation for the creation of
intellectual capital. Becoming, in effect, "expec-
tations that bind" (Kramer & Goldman, 1995).
such norms may be a significant influence on
exchange processes, opening up access to par-
ties for the exchange of knowledge (C4 in Figure
1) and ensuring DEMO motivation to engage in
such exchange (C5 in Figure 1; Putnam, 1993).
For example, Starbuck (1992) notes the impor-
tance DEMO social norms of openness and teamwork
as key features of knowledge-intensive firms; he
highlights the significance of the emphasis on
cooperation rather than competition, on open
disclosure of information, and on building loy-
alty to DEMO firm as significant underpinnings of
the success of the American law firm Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz, which specializes in ad-
vice DEMO nonroutine, challenging cases. Other
norms of interaction that have been shown DEMO be
important in the creation of intellectual capital
include a willingness to value and respond to
diversity, an openness to criticism, and a DEMO
ance of failure (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Such
norms may offset the tendency to "groupthink"
that may emerge in strong, convergent groups
DEMO that represents the way in which high lev-
els of social capital may be a real inhibitor for
the development of intellectual capital (Janis,
1982). At the same time, as Leonard-Barton (1995)
DEMO shown, norms also may have a dark side;
those capabilities DEMO values initially seen as
a benefit may become, in time, a pathological
rigidity.
Obligations and expectations. Obligations
represent a commitment or duty to DEMO
some activity in the future. Coleman (1990) dis-
tinguishes obligations from generalized norms,
viewing the former as expectations developed
within particular personal DEMO He
suggests that obligations operate as a "credit
slip" held by A to be redeemed by some perfor-
mance by B-a view reminiscent DEMO Bourdieu's
(1986) concept of credential we referred to earlier
in this article. In the context of the creation of
intellectual capital, we suggest that such obli-
gations and expectations are likely to influence
both DEMO to parties for exchanging and com-
bining knowledge (C6 in Figure DEMO) and the mo-
tivation to combine and exchange such knowl-
edge (C7 in Figure 1). The notion that "there is no
such thing as a free lunch" represents a com-
monly held view that exchange brings with it
expectations about future obligations-a view
explicated in detail DEMO Mauss (1954). Bourdieu
(19771, and Cheal (1988). Fairtlough (1994) as-
cribes considerable importance to the formal,
professional, and personal obligations that de-
velop between those involved in cooperative re-
search DEMO development projects between dif-
ferent organizations:
256
People in the two companies could rely on each
other.. . DEMO This was cooperation which certainly
went beyond contractual obligations. It might
also have gone beyond enlightened self interest,
and beyond good professional behaviour, be-
cause the scientists liked working together, felt
committed to the overall project and felt a per-
sonal obligation to help the others involved (1994:
119).
Identification. Identification is the process
whereby individuals see DEMO as one
with another person or group of people. This
may result from their membership in that group
or through the group's operation DEMO a reference
group, "in which the individual takes the values
or standards of other individuals or groups as a
comparative frame of reference" (Merton, 1968:
288; see also Tajfel, 1982). Kramer DEMO al. (1996)
have found that identification with a group or
DEMO enhances concern for collective pro-
cesses and outcomes, thus increasing the
DEMO that the opportunity for exchange will
be recognized. Identification, therefore, acts as a
resource influencing both the anticipation of
value to be achieved DEMO combination and
exchange (C8 in Figure 1) and the motivation to
combine and exchange knowledge (C9 in Figure
1). We find support for this in the research of
Lewicki and Bunker (1996), whose evidence sug-
gests that salient group identification may not
only increase the DEMO opportunities for ex-
change but also may enhance the actual fre-
quency of cooperation. In contrast, where groups
have distinct and contradictory identities, DEMO
may constitute significant barriers to informa-
tion sharing, learning, and knowledge creation
(Child & Rodrigues, 1996; Pettigrew, 1973; Simon
& Davies, 1996).
Thus far, we have argued that social capital
theory DEMO a powerful basis for under-
standing the creation of intellectual capital in
general. The various specific links we have pro-
posed are summarized in DEMO 1. In the next
section we suggest that the theory also provides
a basis for understanding the nature of organi-
zational advantage since firms, as institutions,
are likely to be relatively well endowed with
social DEMO

AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL ADVANTAGE
The last DEMO years have witnessed a substan-
tial resurgence of interest in the theory of the

firm. During this period, those espousing trans-
action cost approaches became increasingly in-
fluential, positing, at DEMO simplest, that the ex-
istence of firms can be explained in DEMO of
market failure and the greater ability of firms,
through hierarchy, to reduce the costs of trans-
actions in particular (and relatively DEMO)
circumstances (Williamson, 1975, 1981, 1985). The
transaction cost theory of the firm has proved
robust and has been applied across DEMO wide
range of issues, but it has also become subject to
DEMO criticism for a range of definitional,
methodological, and substantive reasons (see,
for example, Conner & Prahalad, 1996, and Pite-
lis, 1993). More fundamentally, as we noted at
the outset of DEMO article, researchers now are
seeking to develop a theory of the DEMO that is
expressed in positive terms (Kogut & Zander,
1996; Masten, Meehan, & Snyder, 1991; Simon,
199lb)-away from DEMO market-failure framework
to one grounded in the concept of organizational
advantage (DEMO & Ghoshal, 1996).
Increasingly, the special capabilities of organ-
izations for creating and transferring knowledge
are being identified as a central element DEMO or-
ganizational advantage. We suggest that social
capital theory provides a sound basis for ex-
plaining why this should be the case. First, or-
ganizations as institutional settings are charac-
terized by many of the factors DEMO to be
conducive to the development of high levels of
social capital. Second, it is the coevolution of
social and intellectual capital that underpins
organizational advantage.
Organizations as Institutional Settings Are
Conducive to the Development of DEMO
Capital
Social capital is owned jointly by the parties
to a relationship, with no exclusive ownership
rights for individuals. Thus, it is fundamentally
DEMO with resources located within struc-
tures and processes of social exchange; DEMO such,
the development of social capital is signifi-
cantly affected by those factors shaping the evo-
lution of social relationships. We discuss four
DEMO conditions here: time, interaction, interde-
pendence, and closure. We argue that all four
are more characteristic of internal organization
than of market DEMO as represented in
neoclassical theory and that, as a result, organ-
izations as institutional settings are conducive
1998
to the development of high levels of social cap-
ital relative DEMO markets. However, as we subse-
quently note, in practice these conditions may
also occur in some forms of interorganizational
networks, thereby enabling such networks to
become relatively well endowed with social
capital.
Time and the DEMO of social capital.
Like other forms of capital, social capital consti-
DEMO a form of accumulated history-here re-
flecting investments in social relations and so-
cial organization through time (Bourdieu, 1986;
Granovetter, 1992). Time is important for the de-
velopment of social capital, since all forms of
social capital depend on stability and continuity
of the social DEMO The concept of embed-
ding fundamentally means the binding of social
relations in contexts of time and space (Gid-
dens, 1990). Coleman DEMO the importance
of continuity in social relationships:
One way in which the transactions that make up
social action differ from those of the DEMO
model of a perfect market lie in the role of time. In
a model of a perfect market, transactions are both
costless and instantaneous. But in the real world,
transactions are consummated over a period DEMO
time (1990: 91).
For example, since it takes time DEMO build trust,
relationship stability and durability are key net-
work features associated with high levels of
trust and norms of cooperation (Axelrod, DEMO;
Granovetter, 1985; Putnam, 1993; Ring & Van de
Ven, 1992). The duration and stability of social
relations also influence the clarity and visibility
of mutual obligations (Misztal, 1996).
Although, in the main, social capital is cre-
ated as a by-product of activities engaged in for
other purposes, intentional or constructed organ-
ization represents a direct, purposeful invest-
ment in social capital (Coleman, 1990, 1993)DEMO
"These organizations ordinarily take the form of
authority structures composed of DEMO con-
nected by obligations and expectations and
occupied by persons" (Coleman 1990: 313). In
contrast to the short-term transactions charac-
terizing the markets of neoclassical theory, in-
tentional or constructed organization represents
the creation and maintenance of an explicit and
enduring structure of ties constituting, through
organizational design, a configuration of rela-
tionships and resources usable for a variety of
purposes-both formal and informal. Moreover,
this commitment to continuity DEMO the

other processes known to be influential in the
development of social capital: interdependence,
interaction, and closure.
Interdependence DEMO the development of so-
cial capital. Coleman (1990) states that social
capital is eroded by factors that make people
less dependent upon each DEMO This appears
especially so for the relational dimension of so-
cial capital. For example, expectations and ob-
ligations are less significant where people have
alternative sources of support. Indeed, Misztal
(1996) has suggested that the recent resurgence
of interest in trust can be explained by the in-
DEMO transitional character of our present
condition and the erosion of social interdepen-
dence and solidarity. Yet, most authors agree
that high levels of social capital usually are
developed in contexts characterized by high lev-
els of DEMO interdependence.
Whereas markets as institutional arrange-
ments are rooted in the concept of autonomy
(and institutional economists largely neglect in-
terdependence between exchange parties; Zajac
& Olsen, 1993), firms fundamentally are institu-
tions designed DEMO the concepts and prac-
tices of specialization and interdependence and
differentiation and integration (Lawrence &
Lorsch, 1967; Smith, 1986; Thompson, 1967). Inter-
dependence-and the coordination it implies-
long has been recognized as DEMO the key
attribute of business organization (Barnard,
1938). Follet DEMO so far as to suggest that
the fair test of business administration, of indus-
trial organization, is whether you have a busi-
ness DEMO all its parts so co-ordinated, so moving
together in their closely DEMO and adjusting activ-
ities, so linking, interlocking and inter-relating,
that they make a working unit, not a congerie of
separate pieces (DEMO: 61).
Such interdependence provides the stimulus for
developing many organizationally DEMO
forms of social capital. For example, through
providing the opportunity to DEMO contexts
characterized by the condition of interdepen-
dent viability-that is, the DEMO that ex-
changes are positive in outcome for the system
overall rather than for each individual member
of the system-organizations considerably ex-
tend the DEMO of exchange that takes place
among their members (Coleman, 1993; DEMO &
Ghoshal, 1996), thereby increasing social identi-
fication and encouraging norms of cooperation
and risk taking.

Interaction and the development of social
DEMO Social relationships generally, though
not always, are strengthened through interac-
tion but die out if not maintained. Unlike many
other forms of capital, social capital increases
rather than decreases with use. Interaction,
thus, is a precondition for the development
and maintenance of dense social capital
(Bourdieu, 1986). In particular, as we noted al-
ready, scholars have shown that the cognitive
and relational dimensions of social capital ac-
cumulate DEMO network structures where link-
ages are strong, multidimensional, and recip-
rocal-features that characterize many firms
but that rarely surface in pure market forms DEMO
organization. Discussing the development of
language, Boland and Tenkasi note that DEMO is
"through action within communities of know-
ing that we make DEMO remake both our lan-
guage and our knowledge" (1995: 353)DEMO Accord-
ing to these authors, such communities must
have space for DEMO, action, and inter-
action in order for the codes and language to
develop that facilitate the creation of new in-
tellectual capital.
In DEMO different context Boissevain (1974) shows
how multiplex relations are more intimate than
single-stranded relationships, therefore provid-
ing more accessibility and more response to
pressure than single-stranded relations. Such
relations typically are imbued with higher lev-
DEMO of obligation between network members, as
well as trust-based norms (Coleman, 1990). Fur-
ther, Powell (1996) argues that norm-based con-
DEMO of trust miss the extent to which coop-
eration is buttressed by sustained contact,
regular dialogue, and constant monitoring. He
adds that, DEMO mechanisms and institutions
to sustain such conversations, trust does not en-
DEMO (see also Coleman, 1990). This echoes Bour-
dieu's earlier emphasis on the fundamental
need for "an unceasing effort of sociability"
(1986: 250) for the reproduction of social capital
in its many forms.
In neoclassical theory, markets as institu-
tional settings are epitomized by impersonal,
arm's length, spot transactions. Firms, in con-
trast, provide many opportunities for sustained
interaction, conversations, and sociability-
both by DEMO and by accident. Formal organi-
zations explicitly are designed to bring mem-
bers together in order to undertake their primary
task, to supervise activities, and to coordinate
their activities, particularly in contexts requir-
ing mutual DEMO (Mintzberg, 1979; Thomp-
son, 1967), change, and innovation (Burns &
Stalker, 1961; Galbraith, 1973). Through copres-
ence (Giddens, 1984), colocation (Fairtlough,
1994), and the creation DEMO such processes as rou-
tine choice opportunities (March & Olsen, 1976),
organizations also create a myriad of contexts
and occasions for the more-or-less planned com-
ing together of people and their ideas. Finally,
DEMO literature is replete with evidence that or-
ganizational life is characterized by a substan-
tial amount of conversation: in meetings, confer-
ences, and social events that fill the everyday
life of workers and managers (Mintzberg, 1973;
Prescott & Visscher, 1980; Roy, 1960). Together,DEMO
these can be viewed as collective investment
strategies for the institutional creation and
maintenance of dense networks of social rela-
tionships and for the DEMO embedded
within, available through, and derived from
such networks of relationships. Alternatively,
these meetings and social events provide the
unplanned and unstructured DEMO for
the accidental coming together of ideas that
may lead to the serendipitous development of
new intellectual capital.
Closure and the development of social DEMO
ital. Finally, there is much evidence that clo-
sure is a DEMO of social relationships that is
conducive to the development of high levels of
relational and cognitive social capital. Strong
communities-the epitome of systems of DEMO
social capital-have "identities that separate
and a sense of sociological boundary DEMO dis-
tinguishes members from nonmembers" (Etzi-
oni, 1996: 9; DEMO also Bourdieu, 1986). The de-
velopment of norms, identity, DEMO trust has
been shown to be facilitated by network clo-
sure (DEMO, 1990; Ibarra, 1992), and the de-
velopment of unique DEMO and language is
assisted by the existence of community sepa-
ration (DEMO & Tenkasi, 1995). Formal organ-
izations, by definition, imply DEMO measure of clo-
sure through the creation of explicit legal,
financial, and social boundaries (Kogut &
Zander, 1996). Markets, in contrast, represent
open networks that benefit from the freedom
offered to individual agents but that have less
access to the relational and cognitive facets DEMO
social capital.

The Coevolution of Social and Intellectual
Capital Underpins Organizational Advantage
Our DEMO argument thus far has been that
social capital is influential in the development
of new intellectual capital and that organiza-
tions are institutional settings DEMO to the
development of social capital. We have noted
the significant and growing body of work that
indicates organizations have some particular
capabilities for DEMO and sharing knowl-
edge, giving them their distinctive advantage
over other DEMO arrangements, such as
markets. We now pull the strands of our DEMO
sis together by proposing that it is the interac-
tion between social and intellectual capital that
underpins organizational advantage.
Although our primary aim has DEMO to suggest
that social capital influences the development
of intellectual capital, DEMO recognize that the pat-
tern of influence may be in the other direction.
The view that shared knowledge forms the basis
from which social DEMO and interaction flow is a
central theme in sociology, exemplified in DEMO
work of Berger and Luckman (1966) and Schutz
(1970). DEMO organizational analysis, authors
long have suggested that the firm's particular
DEMO about how activities are to be coor-
dinated underpins its capability to develop and
operate as a social system (Kogut & Zander,
1992, 1996; March & Simon, 1958: Penrose, 1959;
Thompson, DEMO). We represent the influence of
intellectual capital on social capital as a feed-
back relationship in Figure 1. More important,
however, we believe that it is the coevolution of
social and intellectual capital that DEMO of partic-
ular significance in explaining the source of or-
ganizational advantage.
Earlier in the article we noted the dialectical
process by which social DEMO is both created
and sustained through exchange and, in turn,
DEMO such exchange to take place. As Berger
and Luckman observe,
The relationship between man, the producer, and
the social world, his product, is and remains a
dialectical one. That is, man (not, DEMO course, in
isolation but in his collectivities) and his social
world interact with each other. The product acts
back upon the producer (1966: 78; see also Bour-
dieu, 1977).
Giddens, too, examines the self-reproducing
quality of social practices, noting that social
activities are recursive-that is, "continually
Nahapiet and Ghoshal
259
recreated by actors via the DEMO means by which
they express themselves as actors" (1984: 2)DEMO For
Giddens this implies a concept of human knowl-
edgeability that underpins all social practice.
The discussion of knowledgeability that en-
sues suggests the DEMO quality of the rela-
tionship between social and intellectual capital
and is consistent with our emphasis on the so-
cial embeddedness of both forms DEMO capital.
Since both social and intellectual capital de-
velop within and derive their significance from
the social activities and social relationships
within which they DEMO located, their evolution-
ary paths are likely to be highly interrelated.
DEMO of the reciprocal relationship
between knowledge and its social context per-
meates the sociology of science (Zuckerman,
1988). Mullins (1973), DEMO example, describes the
joint evolution of social interaction, communica-
tion networks, and the elaboration of scientific
ideas and notes that cognitive development is
facilitated by the thickening of communication
networks, which then leads to their further elab-
oration. Research within organizations offers
many parallel examples (Burns & Stalker, 1961;
Leonard-Barton, 1995: Weick, 1995; Zucker et al.,
1996). For instance, in a study of change in
health administration, Nahapiet (1988) de-
scribes, in detail, how a new accounting calcu-
lus both shaped and was, in turn, shaped by DEMO
social context in which it was embedded.
Discussing Orr's (1990) influential ethnogra-
phy of service technicians, Brown and Duguid
(1991) provide further insight into this coevolu-
tion of knowledge and relationships. Specifi-
cally, they describe how technicians achieve
two distinct forms of social construction. First,DEMO
through their work, and "through cultivating
connections throughout the corporation" (Brown
& Duguid, 1991: 67), technicians engage in the
ongoing DEMO and negotiation of shared un-
derstanding-an understanding that represents
their view of the world, that is their collective
knowledge. The second form of social construc-
tion, which, according to Brown and Duguid, is
also important but less evident, is the creation of
a shared identity. "In DEMO these stories an
individual rep contributes to the construction
and development of his or her own identity as a
rep and reciprocally to the DEMO and de-
velopment of the community of reps in which he
or she works" (Brown & Duguid, 1991: 68). In an
DEMO reminiscent of Weick and Roberts'
260
Academy of Manlagement Review
April
(1993) discussion of collective mind-itself DEMO
cated in processes of interrelating-these au-
thors highlight the mutually dependent and in-
teractive ways in which social and intellectual
capital coevolve.
We suggest DEMO this emphasis on the coevo-
lution of the two forms of capital provides a
dynamic perspective on the development of or-
ganizational advantage. Spender (1996) argues
that it is the collective forms of knowledge that
are strategically important, and many authors
claim that it is these forms of shared tacit knowl-
edge that underpin what we have termed the
"organizational advantage." It is these collec-
tive forms of knowledge, we believe, that are
particularly tightly interconnected with the rela-
tional and cognitive forms DEMO social capital with
which, we have argued, organizations are rela-
tively well endowed. Organizations, thus, build
and retain their advantage through the DEMO
and complex interrelationships between social
and intellectual capital.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
The view of organizational advantage we
present here is fundamentally a social one. DEMO
see the roots of intellectual capital deeply em-
bedded in social relations and in the structure of
these relations. Such a view contrasts strongly
DEMO the relatively individualistic and acontex-
tual perspectives that characterize more trans-
actional approaches for explaining the exis-
tence and contribution of firms. Although we
DEMO identified several ways in which facets of
social capital may, indeed, reduce transaction
costs by economizing on information and coor-
dination costs, we believe that our theoretical
propositions go much farther in identifying
those factors DEMO dynamic efficiency
and growth.
In so doing, we note that our DEMO are
consistent with resource-based theory in so far
as that theory highlights the competitive advan-
tage of firms as based in their unique constella-
DEMO of resources: physical, human, and organi-
zational (Barney, 1991)DEMO Those resources found to
be especially valuable are those that are rare,
durable, imperfectly imitable, and nontradable
(Barney, 1991; Dierickx & Cool, 1989). Among the
factors making a resource nonimitable are tac-
itness (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990), causal ambigu-
ity (Lippman & Rumelt, 1992), time compression
diseconomies, and interconnectedness (Dierickx
& Cool, 1989), as well as path dependence
and social complexity (Barney, 1991; Reed &
DeFillippi, 1990). All of these are features inte-
gral to the facets of social capital and to its
interrelationships DEMO intellectual capital.
Thus, we suggest that differences between
firms, including differences in performance,
may represent differences in their ability to cre-
ate DEMO exploit social capital. Moreover, at least
regarding the development of intellectual DEMO
tal, those firms developing particular configura-
tions of social capital are DEMO to be more suc-
cessful. Evidence for this suggestion is found in
studies of knowledge-intensive firms that have
been shown to invest heavily in DEMO, in-
cluding physical facilities, to encourage the de-
velopment of strong personal and team relation-
ships, high levels of personal trust, norm-based
DEMO, and strong connections across porous
boundaries (Alvesson, 1991, 1992; DEMO, 1992,
1994; Van Maanen & Kunda, 1989). The DEMO
work developed here will provide a useful basis
for further testing these propositions about firm
differences.
In developing our thesis, we have noted sev-
eral limitations in our approach. First, regarding
social capital, our analysis DEMO concentrated
primarily, although not exclusively, on how so-
cial capital assists the creation of new intellec-
tual capital. However, we recognize that social
capital also may have significant negative con-
sequences. For example, certain norms may be
antagonistic rather than supportive of coopera-
tion, exchange, and DEMO Moreover, organi-
zations high in social capital may become ossi-
fied DEMO their relatively restricted access to
diverse sources of ideas and information. But
the general point underpinning our analysis is
that institutions facilitate some forms DEMO ex-
change and combination but limit their scope
(Ghoshal & Moran, 1996); thus, effective organi-
zation requires a constant balancing of poten-
tially opposing forces (Boland & Tenkasi, 1995;
Etzioni, 1996; DEMO, 1995).
Furthermore, the creation and maintenance of
some forms of social capital, particularly the
relational and cognitive dimensions, are costly.
The DEMO of social capital thus repre-
sents a significant investment-conscious or
unconscious-and, DEMO all such investments, re-
quires an understanding of the relative costs
DEMO benefits likely to be derived from such in-
1998
Nahapiet and Ghoshal
26 1
vestment. These are likely to be DEMO by
the size and complexity of the social structure in
which social capital is embedded, since the
costs of maintaining linkages usually increase
exponentially as a social network increases in
size. Although technology may make it DEMO
to stretch the conventional limits of networks of
social capital, our DEMO about the signifi-
cance of interdependence, interaction, and clo-
sure suggest that there still remain important
upper limits. Indeed, adding people to the net-
work may serve to reduce certain forms of social
capital, such as personal obligations or high
status.
Finally, although we have responded to Put-
nam's challenge to progress our understanding
of the various dimensions DEMO facets of social
capital, in our analysis we largely have consid-
DEMO these dimensions separately. Of great in-
terest is the interrelationships among the three
dimensions and, indeed, among the various fac-
ets within each DEMO We regard this as an
important focus for future research.
Second, DEMO intellectual capital, we
have concentrated on just one aspect: its cre-
ation, rather than its diffusion and exploitation.
A fuller understanding of knowledge as the
source of organizational advantage will require
an examination of the DEMO in which social cap-
ital may influence these important and comple-
mentary processes. We believe that the frame-
work we develop here provides a DEMO basis
for such examination. Also, we have focused
very much on DEMO types and processes of intel-
lectual capital rather than its content-that is,
the know-how rather than the know-what.
Clearly, the specific knowledge content, includ-
ing its quality, are important factors to be con-
sidered DEMO attempting to gain an understand-
ing of the effective creation of intellectual
capital.
Third, our exploration of organizational ad-
vantage began with the proposition that knowl-
edge and knowledge processes are major foun-
dations of such DEMO However, our
discussion of the coevolution of social and intel-
lectual DEMO potentially enriches this under-
standing of organizational advantage in impor-
tant ways. For instance, our analysis elucidates
resource creation within networks, concentrat-
ing DEMO on the interrelated development
of social and intellectual capital as key re-
sources. As such, it is suggestive of the pro-
cesses whereby organizational networks create
value and that, perhaps, underpin their advan-
tage. More DEMO, we believe that a detailed
understanding of social capital itself may DEMO an
important element in extending our understand-
ing of the significant, DEMO as yet inadequately
understood, concept of organizational advan-
tage. However, we could not explore such issues
in this article, and we recognize that much work
still needs to be done to elaborate both the con-
DEMO of organizational advantage and the signif-
icance of social capital therein.
Fourth and finally, we have developed our
thesis about the relationships between social
and intellectual capital in the context of explor-
ing and explaining the DEMO of organizational
advantage-that is, we have made the argu-
ment regarding DEMO interrelationships within
one type of boundary: the firm. It is our DEMO that
structures of social capital fundamentally are
relatively bounded, and these DEMO typi-
cally come from some external physical or so-
cial basis for grouping, such as a geographic
community (Jacobs, 1965; Putnam, 1993), the
family (Coleman, 1988; Loury, 1977), religion
(Coleman, 1990), or class (Bourdieu, 1977). As we
noted earlier, social capital is typically a by-
product of other activities; thus, its development
requires a "focus": an entity around which joint
activities are organized (Nohria, 1992) and which
forms the basis for a level of network closure.
However, our analysis of the conditions con-
ducive to the development of social capital sug-
gests that wherever institutions operate DEMO con-
texts characterized by enduring relationships-
with relatively high levels of interdependence,
interaction, and closure-we would expect to
see these institutions emerge with relatively
dense configurations of social capital. We have
argued that these conditions DEMO occur
more within organizations than in neoclassical
markets, but they may DEMO be found in particu-
lar forms of interorganizational relationship
(Baker, 1990; Hakansson & Snehota, 1995; Larson,
1992; Powell, 1996; DEMO & Van de Ven, 1992,
1994). Therefore, we see the potential to extend
our fundamental analysis to other institutional
settings, including those existing between
organizations.
Bourdieu (1993) argues that, by making the
concept of social capital explicit, it is possible to
focus rigorously on the intuitively important
concept of "connections" and to establish the

basis for research designed to identify DEMO pro-
cesses for social capital's creation, accumula-
tion, dissipation, DEMO consequence. The concept
also provides a theoretical justification for the
study of many social practices, such as the "so-
cial round," popularly DEMO as important
but frequently ignored in formal research. In
particular, for DEMO, systematic analysis of

social and other forms of capital.
In identifying the interrelationship between
social and intellectual capital, we have made a
similar argument. That is, by defining the con-
cepts and developing clear propositions about
their interrelationships, we have established an
agenda for future research that both comple-
ments and extends existing knowledge-based
theories of the firm. DEMO, we suggest that
the model outlined here also provides the foun-
DEMO of a viable framework to guide the invest-
ments-individual or collective-of practition-
ers seeking to build or extend their network of
connections and, therefore, their stocks of social
capital. As Bourdieu observes, "[Tlhe existence
of connections is not a natural given, or even a
social given. . . it is the product of an endless
effort at institution" (DEMO: 249).
