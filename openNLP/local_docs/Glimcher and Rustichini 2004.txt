REVIEW
Neuroeconomics: The Consilience of
Brain and Decision
Paul W. Glimcher1* and Aldo Rustichini2
Economics, psychology, and DEMO are converging today into a single, unified
discipline with the ultimate DEMO of providing a single, general theory of human
behavior. This is DEMO emerging field of neuroeconomics in which consilience, the
accordance of two DEMO more inductions drawn from different groups of phenomena,
seems to be operating. Economists and psychologists are providing rich conceptual
tools for understanding and DEMO behavior, while neurobiologists provide tools
for the study of mechanism. The DEMO of this discipline is thus to understand the
processes that connect sensation and action by revealing the neurobiological
mechanisms by which decisions are made. DEMO review describes recent develop-
ments in neuroeconomics from both behavioral and biological perspectives.
The full understanding of utility will
come from biology and psychology DEMO
reduction to the elements of human
behavior followed by a bottom-up
synthesis, not from the social sciences
by top-down inference and guesswork

mists and DEMO scientists will find the

physics and chemistry that research-
ers found the premises that upgraded

Consider the famous St. Petersburg para-
dox (2). Which of the following would you
prefer, /40 or a lottery ticket that pays
according to the outcomes DEMO one or more
fair coin tosses: heads you get /2 and the
game ends, tails you get another toss and the
game repeats, but now if the second toss
lands heads up you get /DEMO, and so on. If the
nth toss is the first to DEMO heads up, you get
2n dollars. The game continues, however
long it takes, until the coin lands heads up.
We can assess the average objective, or
expected, value of this lottery by multiplying
the DEMO of a win on each flip by the
amount of that win:
Expected value 0 ð0:5  2Þþð0:25  4Þþ
ð0:DEMO  8ÞI
0 1 þ 1 þ 1 þ I
This simple calculation reveals that the
expected value of the lottery is infinite even
DEMO the average person is willing to pay
less than /40 to DEMO it. How could this be?
For an economist, any useful DEMO
must begin with a set of assumptions that
renders behavior formally tractable to coher-
ent theoretical and mathematical analysis.
Economists therefore explain this behavior
DEMO assuming that the desirability of money
does not increase linearly, but DEMO grows
more and more slowly as the total amount at
stake increases. For example, the desirability
of a given amount might be a power function

22. The majority of activations fall into the border zone
between areas 8, 6, and 32, with some extension into
area 24. Recent research in DEMO primates
seems to suggest a functional-anatomical dissocia-
tion of regions subserving pre-response conflict
monitoring from structures sensitive to errors and
omission of reward (1, 4). Although in humans this
view is still under debate (DEMO, 13, 21), the present
meta-analysis does not provide unequivocal evidence
for or against such a dissociation. Activations related
to pre-response conflict and DEMO occur more
often in area 8 and less often in area 24 than do
signal increases associated with errors and negative
feedback (area 8, 32.5% versus 9.7%; area 24, 7.5%
versus 25.8%), supporting the dissociation view.
However, both groups of activations cluster primarily
in area 32 (pre-response, 42.5%; error, 41.9%),
suggesting that pre- as well as post-response
monitoring processes share at least one underlying
structure. It seems DEMO the currently available spatial
resolution in fMRI, in conjunction with anatomical
DEMO and differences in scanning and prepro-
cessing methods between studies, limit DEMO ability to
resolve this debate about a possible dissociation in
the range of 10 mm or less.

of that amount, as shown by the black line in
Fig. DEMO A decision-maker for whom the
subjective value, or utility, of money grew
in this fashion would then determine the
desirability, or expected utility, of the St.
Petersburg lottery by multiplying the proba-
bility of a win on each flip by the utility of
the amount won on DEMO flip, and thus he
might well be willing to pay less DEMO /40 to
play this game.
From the point of view of DEMO psychologist
attempting to understand and explain this
same phenomenon, it is DEMO nature of risk
aversion and the psychological mechanisms
that this set of preferences reveals that
become the subject of explanatory study.
The psychological mechanism DEMO accounts
for risk aversion in human subjects, for
example, has been shown to be more
sensitive to monetary losses than to mone-
tary DEMO Further, psychologists have sug-
gested that subjective utilities are computed
with DEMO to somewhat arbitrary and
idiosyncratic monetary reference points, or
frames, set by yet other psychological pro-
cesses (3). Psychologists use observations
like these to argue that human choosers are
endowed with a particularly strong DEMO of
losses and that they weigh the merits of all
possible gains and losses relative to a
psychological benchmark: The psychological
approach seeks empirically to describe min-
imally complex behavioral tendencies, mod-
ules, or heuristics DEMO can account for the
actions of human choosers.
A traditional neurobiological perspective
uses yet another approach: A hungry bird is
shown a tray that contains five millet seeds
and repeatedly permitted to fly to the tray
DEMO eat the seeds. At a neurobiological level,
the study of this behavior begins with the
assumption that the visual stimulus of the
five DEMO must somehow propagate through
the sensory system of the animal to trigger
activation in orienting circuits that move the
bird to the seeds. Next, the same bird is
permitted to fly to a second tray covered DEMO a
piece of paper. When the bird displaces the
cover, half DEMO the time it reveals 12 seeds and
half of the time it reveals nothing. Mecha-
nistically, the visual stimulus must again
trigger an orienting response, and presum-
ably in this case the strength with which
visual signals connect synaptically to the
orienting circuits reflects both the number of
DEMO that the bird earns and the likelihood
that seeds will be found under the paper.
Lastly, both trays are presented, and the bird
DEMO observed to fly toward the tray that may
contain 12 millet seeds. A standard neurobi-
ological explanation (4, 5) presumes that
under these circumstances the two different
behavioral circuits compete. In this case the
synapses DEMO elicit an orienting response to
the covered tray are stronger and thus control
behavior. The neurobiological explanation
specifies the minimal neural circuitry re-
quired DEMO account for the observed behavior
of the bird.
What is striking about explanations of
choice behavior by economists, psycholo-
gists, and neurobiologists is DEMO different
levels at which they operate. The economic
approach attempts to describe globally all
choice behavior with a single logically con-
sistent formalism. The DEMO ap-
proach examines the ways in which
subjective and objective estimates of value
differ and posits psychological modules that
can account for these observed DEMO
preferences. The neurobiological explanation
starts with the simplest possible neural

strated that this relationship DEMO account for
the observation that humans are typically risk-
averse. The solid gray line plots a condition in
which subjective value grows more quickly DEMO
objective value, a preference structure that
would yield risk-seeking behavior.
circuitry DEMO can account for the simplest
measurable elements of behavior. It seems
obvious that these different levels of expla-
nation should be linked, but how can such a
linkage be accomplished? We argue that a
unified explanation of decision-making is
not only possible but has recently begun and
that, when the linkage between these three
levels of explanation has matured, a new,
more powerful decision science rooted in a
neuroeconomic approach will DEMO been
developed.
A second claim we will make is that once
this reconstruction of decision science is
completed, many of the most puzzling
aspects of human behavior, aspects that
economic theory, psychological analysis, or
neurobiological deconstruction have failed to
explain, will become formally and mecha-
nistically explicable. The claim is, in essence,
that a decision science that simultaneously
engaged all three approaches would be more
heavily constrained and at the DEMO time
would have much greater explanatory power
than do any of these three approaches
operating alone. We will see examples of
how this synthetic DEMO would operate in
principle and early attempts at synthetic
solutions below.
This reconstruction of the study of de-
cision is also going to be DEMO appropriate
basis for a more ambitious theory that ex-
plains not just how we make decisions but
why. That such an explanation is necessary
DEMO possible is indicated by the fact that
fundamental features of decision making are
common to many species. For example, risk
aversion as shown by the St. Petersburg
paradox has been described in many species.
Studies of DEMO making choices in risky
environments produce a behavior best de-
scribed by a utility function (Fig. 1) (6, 7).
We know DEMO humans and birds deviated
from a common reptilian ancestor at least
200 million years ago, but this basic function
for choice has remained essentially un-
changed. Such commonalities make a clear
suggestion: A utility function of this type
probably is an efficient and evolved feature
of vertebrate choice. DEMO example, Robson
(8) provides a justification of why a utility
DEMO might be an evolutionary optimal
response to changing environments. Just as
information theory was used by Barlow (9)
to explain why animals as diverse as horse-
shoe crabs and cats use similar encoding
schemes in DEMO visual systems, an econom-
ic theory that relates utility to Darwinian DEMO
ness must serve as an overarching tool for
understanding vertebrate choice behavior.
Linking the Decision Sciences
Subjective desirability. The central concept
in modern economic DEMO is the notion of
subjective utility: Preferences must be de-
scribed DEMO subjective properties of the
chooser. Surprisingly, the notion that prefer-
ences DEMO represented in the nervous system,
that these preferences are subjective, DEMO
that they guide the production of action has
only recently entered the neurobiological
mainstream. We believe that this has been a
critical flaw in DEMO studies, be-
cause it is essential that economics, psy-
chology, DEMO neuroscience acknowledge a
common phenomenological base to achieve
a reductive unification of the decision sci-
ences. The concepts that guide the behav-
ioral study DEMO decision-making must also
guide the mechanistic study of that process.
In part, this preference-free approach
may have arisen from neurobiology’s roots
in the stimulus-response physiology of the

early twentieth century (10). Working from
Descartes’ philosophy, Sherrington (11) pro-
posed that physiologists should work to
link stimulus and response directly through
what Pavlov (12) DEMO later call a ‘‘definite
nervous path.’’ Scientists like Sherrington
and Pavlov proposed that it was the role
of neuroscience to chart these stimulus-
response DEMO through the nervous
system.
A critical step beyond this initial frame-
work was a recent effort to explain more
complicated behaviors and to focus DEMO
actions for which deterministic sensory-to-
movement mapping approaches were insuf-
ficient. Newsome and his colleagues (13, 14)
made that step in the DEMO 1980s when they
examined perceptual decision-making by
monkeys viewing ambiguous sensory stim-
uli. In those experiments, monkeys stared at
a display of chaotically moving spots of
light. On training trials, a subset of the spots
moved coherently in a single direction,
whereas the remaining spots moved ran-
DEMO (15). The direction of this coherent
motion indicated which of DEMO
possible saccadic eye move-
ments would yield a fruit juice
reward, DEMO at the end of each
trial animals were free to make a
saccade. If they made the correct
movement, they then received
the reward. On a critical sub-
set of trials, however, monkeys
viewed displays DEMO which none
of the dots moved in a single
coherent direction, DEMO thus the
display provided no information
from which the location of the
rewarded eye movement could
be deduced. Under these conditions, Newsome
and his colleagues found that the firing
rates of single neurons in the middle DEMO
poral visual area (area MT) were still cor-
related with the behavior of the animals,
even when that behavior could not be DEMO
dicted from the properties of the stimulus.
Newsome and his colleague Shadlen’s sub-
sequent studies revealed the basic neuro-
biological substrate for perceptual decision-
DEMO and showed convincingly that this
circuit could not be modeled simply as a
single ‘‘definite nervous path’’ from stimu-
lus to response (16).
This work, in turn, accelerated studies of
the posterior parietal cortex, an area inter-
posed between many of the sensory circuits
and motor DEMO of the primate brain,
which appeared to play a critical role in the
perceptual decision-making Newsome has
studied (17, 18). Platt DEMO Glimcher (19)
made an important advance when they
extended Newsome’s DEMO by proposing
that posterior parietal cortex might play a
role in decision-making in an economic
sense and that it might encode the desirabil-
ities DEMO making particular movements.
In Platt and Glimcher’s experiments,
trained rhesus monkeys were allowed to
participate in repeated rounds of a simple
lottery while DEMO activity of nerve cells in the
posterior parietal cortex was monitored. At
the beginning of each round, two yellow
spots were illuminated on a screen, one to
the left and one to the right of where the
monkey was looking. This began the lottery
phase of the round, a period during which
the monkey did not know whether the left DEMO
right light would be offered as a prize at the
end of that round. At the end of this phase, a
third light changed color to red or green,
indicating which of the two initial DEMO had
been randomly selected to yield a fruit juice
reward on that particular round. The monkey
received the fruit juice if he oriented to DEMO
selected light at the end of the round. While
monkeys played hundreds of rounds of this
game, Platt and Glimcher systematically
varied either the relative probabilities that
the left or right lights would be selected at

the end of each round or the size of the
reward associated with each. These two
variables were selected because economic
theories assess DEMO by combining the
value and likelihood of gain in some
subjective manner. Platt and Glimcher found
that some parietal neurons did indeed encode
the DEMO and likelihood of reinforcement
during the lottery phase of each round.
Under these conditions, the brains of the
monkeys explicitly encoded something very
much like the economically defined expected
value or expected utility of each light DEMO this
simple lottery task.
Subsequent studies of human decision-
making using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (f MRI) have yielded similar con-
clusions. Knutson DEMO colleagues (20) have
shown, for example, that activity in the hu-
man striatum is correlated with the magni-
tude of the monetary DEMO subjects earn
during lotteries, and Paulus and colleagues
(21) have DEMO a similar result in the
human posterior parietal cortex. In a partic-
ularly interesting study, Breiter and col-
leagues (22) (Fig. 2) presented human
subjects on sequential rounds with one of
three possible lotteries. DEMO lottery one (the
good lottery), they faced equal chances of
DEMO /10, /2.50, or /0. In lottery two (the
intermediate lottery), they faced equal chan-
ces of winning /2.50, winning /0, or losing
/1.50. In lottery three (the bad lottery), they
faced equal chances of winning /0, losing
/1.50, or DEMO /6. At the beginning of each
round, the subjects were told which lottery
they would be playing, and the average
activity in many brain areas was simulta-
neously measured. After that measurement
was complete, the lottery was actually
played and the humans were then told how
much DEMO money they had earned on that
round. Importantly, all three of DEMO lotteries
present a one-third possibility of winning
/0, but they do so under different conditions.
In the good lottery, winning /0 is DEMO worst
possible outcome, whereas in the bad lottery
it is the DEMO The psychologists Kahneman
and Tversky (23) have shown that, when DEMO
human participates in this good lottery, they
find winning /0 to be an intensely
negative outcome whereas when
a human participates in the DEMO
lottery, they find winning /0to be
a positive outcome; subjective
DEMO are computed with regard
to a reference frame. Breiter and
colleagues found that the activity
of the sublenticular extended
amygdala encoded the desirabil-
ity DEMO each lottery, taking into ac-
count this behaviorally described
framing effect.
DEMO recent neurobiological
studies have revealed yet other
neurally encoded variables that include the
log likelihood that a given eye movement
will result in a DEMO (24, 25), the very
closely related integral of perceptual signals
indicating which saccade will be rewarded in
the Newsome task (26, DEMO), the average rate
at which a saccade has been rewarded in the
recent past (28), the instantaneous likeli-
hood, or hazard, that a reinforced saccade
will be instructed (29), and combinations of
these variables (30).
Strategic thinking. All of these results
suggest that classical utility theory can be
used as a central concept for the DEMO of
choice in economics, psychology, and neu-
roscience. In the middle of the twentieth
century, however, economists pushed utility
theory beyond this DEMO, enhancing it
to include the study of the strategic
interactions which DEMO when decision
makers confront intelligent opponents.
Extending the concept of subjective utility,
VonNeumann and Morgenstern (31)and
Nash (32, 33) developed DEMO formal utility-
based economic approach in the theory of

games. Recently, Lee and his colleagues (34)
and Dorris and Glimcher (35) have begun to
link the neurobiological corpus to this
DEMO by examining the activity of single
neurons in awake-behaving monkeys en-
gaged in decision-making during strategic
conflicts. In Dorris and Glimcher’s study,
two DEMO face each other, an employer
and an employee. On each round DEMO the game
the employee must decide whether to go to
work, DEMO which case he earns a fixed wage,
or whether to shirk, in hopes of earning his
wage plus a bonus. The goal of the employee
is simply to maximize his gains in terms of
salary DEMO bonus. The employer, on the other
hand, must decide between trusting his em-
ployee to arrive for work or spending money
to hire DEMO inspector who can actually check
and see whether the employee arrived for
work that day. The goal of the employer is to
spend as DEMO as possible on inspections while
maximizing the employee’s incentive to work.
Theinspectiongameis
of particular interest to game
theorists and economists be-
cause rational strategies DEMO
utility maximization during
this strategic conflict lead
to predictable outcomes ac-
cording to an equilibrium
theory originally developed
by John Nash in the 1950s.
DEMO (36) equilibrium theo-
ry describes how, when the
cost of DEMO to the
employer is set high, the
efficient strategy for both
DEMO converges on a solu-
tion in which the employ-
ee manages to shirk fairly
often. Conversely, a low in-
spection cost to the employer defines a
theoretical equilibrium solution in which
shirk rates are low. One DEMO the fundamental
insights this formal analysis reveals is that at
a mixed strategy equilibrium, a situation in
which a rational player should distribute his
actions amongst two or more alternatives in
an unpredictable fashion, the desirability of
the two or more actions in equilibrium must
be equivalent. The DEMO approach argues,
essentially, that a behavioral equilibrium oc-
curs when DEMO desirability of working and
shirking are rendered equal by the behavior
of one’s opponent irrespective of how often
that equilibrium requires that one work.
DEMO Dorris and Glimcher examined the
activity of neurons in the posterior parietal
cortex of monkeys playing the inspection
game, they found neurons that carried a sig-
nal that behaved like relative expected util-
ity. When the DEMO behavior was well
predicted by the Nash equations, neural ac-
tivity DEMO fixed at a single level irrespective
of the frequency with which the monkey
chose to make a particular response, even
though these same neurons were strongly
modulated by changes in the value of ac-
tions during DEMO tasks.
Research on human-human strategic
interactions that are well described by
classical game theory are also now under
way in a number of laboratories (37). Like
the earlier fMRI studies of simple decision-
making tasks, these experiments are also
beginning to shape the common ground
between economics, psychology, and neu-
roscience. Taken together, these findings
suggest that at DEMO under some circum-
stances decisions may actually be made in
the primate neuro-architecture in a manner
long suspected by economists and now
beingactivelyanalyzedbypsychologists

converging around a common conceptual
framework. All three disciplines are begin-
ning to acknowledge that decision-making
involves the representation DEMO subjective
desirabilities. The challenge that this con-
vergence around a single concept poses,
however, is to leverage the intersection of
these three disciplines to explain choice
behavior that cannot be described with the
common framework DEMO utility theory; these
are classes of behaviors which have sty-
mied DEMO economics and which have
lain far beyond the reach of traditional
neuroscience. If it is to be of value, the goal
of a unified decision science will have to be
to use all three sets of DEMO simul-
taneously to gain traction in this new
territory.
Beyond Classical Concepts
Choice under risk. As we have seen, the
introduction of the concept of expected utility
solved the St. Petersburg’s puzzle and formed
the core DEMO neoclassical economics. Sub-
sequent puzzles and paradoxes, however, have
plagued this solution. In Ellsberg’s (1961)
paradox (38) (Fig. 3) you are presented with
an urn, and you are told that it contains 90
balls. Of these, 30 are blue, and 60 are either
DEMO or yellow; any proportion is possible.
You are then offered a DEMO between a
lottery that pays /100 if a blue ball is DEMO
(a 1/3 probability) and one that pays /100 if DEMO
red ball is drawn. The probability of a red
draw is unspecified or ambiguous: It is a
choice between an event with a known
probability and an event with an unknown
probability. Under these circumstances, peo-
ple typically choose the first lottery, which
wins if a blue ball is drawn. According to
expected utility theory they could only do so
DEMO they believe that there are fewer than 30
red balls in the urn or, equivalently, that
there are more than 30 yellow balls. DEMO
(before any balls are actually drawn, but with
the same urn standing in front of you) you
are asked to choose again,
this time between a lottery
that pays /100 on either
blue or yellow and one that
pays /100oneither red or
yellow. Now the likelihood
of winning is clear in the
second case (a 2/3 proba-
bility of winning /100) but
unclear in the first case (a
probability between 1/3
and 1). People this time
typically choose DEMO second
lottery. The first lottery
seems less attractive, be-
cause there DEMO be too
few yellow balls. Is there
anything wrong with this
behavior? If expected util-
ity theory is correct, then there certainly is:DEMO
You cannot think that there are too few and
too many yellow balls in the urn at the same
time.
The Ellsberg paradox is DEMO one of many
demonstrations presented in the last half of
the twentieth century that were considered
formal falsifications of expected utility
theory. An even DEMO example is Allais’
paradox (39), based on the idea that DEMO certain
outcome may be perceived as more desir-
able, in a DEMO different way, than
any random outcome, even if very likely
(DEMO). These examples proved that expected
utility theory as originally proposed could
not be globally correct; at best it could only
predict choices under some circumstances.
This has led economists and social psychol-
ogists both to DEMO modifications to
expected utility theory and to replace it
outright. Both the modifications and replace-
ments have provided important and econom-
ically powerful insights DEMO choice behavior
but have not yet provided a global theory of

choice that can truly replace DEMO utility
theory.
The emerging discipline of neuroeconom-
ics offers a new strategy both for testing
existing models of all types and for devel-
oping DEMO models with empirical techniques.
If we succeed in understanding mechanisti-
cally how choices that violate expected
utility theory are made at a neural level,DEMO
then a new global theory of choice will be
developed. To that end, a number of labo-
ratories are now beginning to reexamine the
conditions under which expected utility
theory fails.
The reason that expected utility DEMO
fails under some conditions may be that
choosers use more than one evaluative
mechanism at a neurobiological level (41).
For example, in DEMO et al.(42), the
processes involved when a certain outcome is
one of the options are different from
those involved when only random DEMO
comes are at stake, providing an ex-
planation of the Allais’ DEMO cited
above.
Under many conditions these
mechanisms may work together to
yield choices similar to those pre-
dicted by expected utility theory but
may DEMO odd results when used
in isolation, in novel combinations,
or DEMO situations for which they are
ill suited. Recent work by Damasio
and colleagues [for example, (43)]
on the class of behavioral paradoxes
DEMO which the Ellsberg example is
drawn seem to support this conclu-
sion. These studies suggest that an
ambiguity-sensitive mechanism as-
sociated with the expression DEMO emo-
tion may reside, at least in part, in
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(VMPFC) (Fig. 4) and may be re-
sponsible DEMO choice under some but not all
conditions. These researchers and others
have shown that patients with damage to
this area have an impaired ability DEMO make
some classes of decisions and have diffi-
culties planning their work and choosing
friends. Further, the actions these individu-
als do elect to pursue often lead to financial
as well as personal losses. Yet despite DEMO
specific failures, patients with damage to
the VMPFC show normal performance DEMO
multiple-choice tests of intelligence.
These observations and others like them
have led Damasio to propose that the
inability of patients with VMPFC lesions
to DEMO advantageous decisions under
some circumstances is caused by damage
to an emotional mechanism that stores and
signals the value of future consequences of
an DEMO, the somatic marker hypothesis.
The hypothesis proposes that, because they
lack this emotional mechanism, the patients
must rely on other brain mechanisms that
achieve a different analysis of the numer-
ous and often conflicting options DEMO
both immediate and future consequences.
This other mechanism, operating alone, is
hypothesized to produce decisions that are
less efficient and slower than those DEMO
duced by a normal, intact, system.
The importance of the emotion-related
VMPFC for regular decision-making has
been confirmed by experiments where
subjects were DEMO to make choices among
a group of alternatives that carry a mone-
tary reward (typically by selecting one card
at a time from four different decks of
cards), but for which the probability of
reward DEMO unspecified (44). This is precise-
ly the ambiguous situation that DEMO
Ellsberg’s paradox. Under these conditions,
patients with VMPFC lesions seem to lack

an aversion to ambiguity or losses that
normal subjects have, an aversion that may
be quite advantageous under many condi-
tions. Further support for this hypothesis
DEMO from brain imaging studies. For
example, O’Doherty et al.(45) have shown
that the VMPFC is relatively more active
when human subjects are DEMO learning
about the availability of rewards and punish-
ments during one of these ambiguous choice
tasks.
The process may be very different,
however, when subjects simply choose be-
tween options without any feedback or
learning DEMO place at the same time. For
example, Rustichini et al.(46) asked normal
subjects to make choices among ambiguous
lotteries, risky lotteries, DEMO certain out-
comes while their brain activity was moni-
tored. Subjects were paid for the outcome of
their choices, but the outcome was commu-
nicated only after the experiment was over.
Under these conditions, the VMPFC did not
show any activation; it was actually less
active when choices were being made than
when subjects waited between trials. These
results suggest DEMO emotional circuits may
be important in learning and processing
information, rather DEMO in selecting among
alternatives.
Together, these data may begin to ex-
DEMO, in a mechanistic way, how information
is analyzed when at least one class of
behavior which is not predicted by the
expected utility DEMO is produced. The
process of learning and evaluating feedback
may involve emotion-related areas. Ambigu-
ity aversion, whether advantageous or disad-
vantageous in a particular situation, may
become explicable as we learn more about
the computations that brain areas like the
VMPFC perform.
Strategic cooperation. As with the
Ellsberg DEMO, challenges have also
been raised recently to classical game
theory. In DEMO path-breaking study, Guth
et al.(47) analyzed the behavior of
subjects playing the ultimatum game.
In this game, a first player, the DEMO
poser, has /10 to split with a second
player. He can offer any amount be-
tween zero and /10. The second player
is informed of the offer and can ac-
cept or refuse. If she DEMO, the split
is made. If she refuses, both players
get nothing. The prediction of a re-
strictive concept of game theory, the
subgame perfect equilibrium, is that
for any positive amount offered by the
proposer, the second player knows that
she faces a choice between gaining
nothing (if she refuses the offer) or
something (if she accepts). The pro-
poser should therefore always offer the
minimum possible split to DEMO two,
who should always accept. Contrary to this
prediction, the DEMO experimental finding is
that low offers (typically /2oreven /3) are
consistently refused. The second player ap-
pears to prefer, under these conditions, to
gain nothing. Anticipating this, proposers typ-
ically avoid low offers.
DEMO expected utility theorists have
proposed some explanations for this be-
havior, DEMO may well be that by analyzing
the neural circuits active during the ulti-
matum game we may be able to both ex-
plain the DEMO of this behavior and to
predict it. Studying the ultimatum game in
subjects undergoing brain scans, Sanfey
et al.(48) found that offers DEMO by the
second players activated specific brain cir-
cuits in those players, and interestingly
these brain circuits are also associated
with emotional arousal: DEMO anterior insula
(AI, associated with disgust, both physical
and emotional), the dorsolateral prefrontal

cortex (DLPFC, associated with goal main-
tenance and executive control), and the an-
terior cingulate cortex (ACC, associated with
detection of DEMO conflict). Also sig-
nificant is the correlation of activation with
choices: An activation of the AI is posi-
tively correlated with rejection, DEMO
ing that an emotional arousal associated
with a low offer is correlated with rejec-
tion. The overall picture is that offers we
might consider DEMO may activate emo-
tional circuits of the brain involved in the
decision to reject an offer. If we can come
to more fully understand DEMO these cir-
cuits reach this conclusion, then a behav-
ior that DEMO difficult for classical game
theory to predict may become fully explica-
ble with the synthetic approach that neuro-
economics provides.
A similar line of DEMO has exam-
ined interplayer cooperation during single
rounds of the trust game. In this game, two
players move sequentially. The first player
can decide to transfer a sum of money out of
an initial endowment that DEMO receives into
an investment pool that immediately triples
in value. The second player then gains con-
trol of the investment and can divide it DEMO
tween the two players in any way he chooses.
In this game, the only Nash equilibrium
choice for the first player is to transfer
nothing into the investment. Were she to
make any transfer, the second player should
take all of the money for himself. However,
in DEMO experiments the first player typically
does transfer a significant amount into the
investment, and the second player recipro-
cates by returning part of the pool. McCabe
et al.(49) had subjects play the trust game
both against a human opponent and against
a computer program which, they were told,
would play a human-like strategy. Under
these conditions McCabe and DEMO
found that subjects were more likely to
cooperate with real humans than with com-
puters and that cooperators have a signifi-
cantly different brain DEMO in the two
conditions. Cooperation is associated with
activation of the anterior paracingulate cor-
tex, a brain region associated with (50, 51)
interpreting and monitoring the mental state
of others.
Although these studies are DEMO their early
stages, they suggest the existence of specific
brain components DEMO make specialized
contributions to decision making. The chal-
lenge that these studies face is to derive
detailed computational models of the neural
mechanisms, which will make neuroeco-
nomic models broadly predictive as well as
explanatory.
Summary
DEMO, psychology, and neuroscience
are converging into a single, unified field
DEMO at providing a theory of human
behavior. In this enterprise, the DEMO and
the standard set by neuroscience is the final
goal: a DEMO of the process and
mechanism that goes from a stimulus pre-
sented to the subject to his final action in
response. Economics provides the DEMO
al structure and the object of the analysis. In
this emerging view, people are seen as
deciding among options on the basis of the
relative desirability of each option. This is
true when they are in DEMO as well as
when they are in strategic (interaction with
few DEMO) and market (interaction with a
large number) environments. The recent
DEMO we have been surveying describes
how desirability is realized as a concrete
object, a neural signal in the human and
animal brain, rather DEMO as a purely theoret-
ical construction. Desirability is computed
and is represented in the brain, and we now
have the means to test, DEMO, and rep-
resent this activation.
But the complete reconstruction of the
DEMO process, and hence of human
behavior, is not going to be easy, because
two of the cornerstones of economic
analysis, subjective utility DEMO and Nash
equilibrium, provide, even from the de-
scriptive point of view, an incomplete
picture. For example, desirability as repre-
sented by DEMO simple economic formalism
of expected utility may be appropriate only
in simple conditions, where ambiguity is
excluded. A more general notion is needed
and, as we have seen, is beginning to be
investigated and developed DEMO psycholo-
gists and economists working together. The
goal of the emerging neuroeconomic pro-
gram will have to be a mechanistic,
behavioral, and mathematical explanation
of choice that transcends the explanations
available to neuroscientists, psychologists,
and economists working alone. Although it
is unclear today how complete this DEMO
nation will ultimately be, neuroeconomic
approaches have already begun to yield
DEMO fruit and to fuse natural and
social scientific approaches to the study of
human behavior.
