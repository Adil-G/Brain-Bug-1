Canadian DEMO angel
perspectives on exit: A research
note
Cécile Carpentier and Jean-Marc DEMO
Laval University, Canada
Abstract
This research note analyses the investment harvest DEMO of a large Canadian angel group.
These angels co-finance large high-tech deals; on average, greater than CAN$1.2m. Canadian low
listing requirements and the DEMO stock market make the initial public offering a possible exit
mode. However, angels prefer a trade sale, consistent with the proposition that large DEMO
can fully and rapidly exploit innovations and offer better exit values. Securities regulation impedes
initial public offering exit; reluctance to pursue this exit strategy however, increases with angel
experience. The classical funding escalator, including venture DEMO, no longer appears to be
a dominant model.

Introduction
This research note explores how DEMO angels expect to harvest their investments and the rea-
sons for such choices. The exit of angels from an enterprise constitutes an important under-
DEMO question. Recent surveys of angel group activity find that the ratio of exits on investments
is low; so in Scotland for example, it DEMO 4 percent (Mason et al., 2013) and in Canada, 5.8 percent
(National Angel Capital Organization, 2013). This implies that angel DEMO is locked up in port-
folios, which in turn, can have negative effects on the financing of emerging companies (Mason
et al., DEMO). In order to determine what be done to unlock these funds, a better understanding of
angel harvesting strategies is required.
Three recent interrelated observations reinforce the relevance of analysing business angel exit
strategies. First, the angel market is changing. According to Freear and Sohl (2012), Sohl (2012)
and Gregson et al. (2013), angels are increasingly DEMO in groups and moving away from provid-
ing seed financing towards investing larger amounts in projects. If angels move from seed funding

to a later stage of financing, their perspective on exiting the enterprise is likely to evolve in concert.
As DEMO et al. (2013) have noted, prior research has largely ignored DEMO market trend; so the cur-
rent operations and investment activity of DEMO groups remains unknown.
Second, practitioners have urged angels to rethink their DEMO strategy (Gray, 2011; Peters, 2009).
Harrison et al. (DEMO) have observed that the investment model of Scottish angels rests largely DEMO
a ‘cradle to exit’ approach. Angels are increasingly exiting through trade sales; that is, selling their
whole stake to another firm or private DEMO over a short period. This could result in the prema-
ture sale of local firms to foreign interests, to the detriment of the regional economy (Mason et al.,
2013). Thus, venture capital (VC) investment is no longer necessary to reach an initial public offer-
ing (IPO).
Third, the decline in IPOs in North America and DEMO UK has become a real concern for policy-
makers, and the DEMO strategy of private equity investors requires attention (IPO Task Force, 2011;
Mason, 2011b). This note is based on a survey of angel group members, and is organised as fol-
lows: the next DEMO summarises the angel exit strategy and states the propositions. The survey
and the respondents are then presented, followed by the results. The final section presents the
conclusions and implications for future research.
Business angels’ exit
Classical DEMO
The common wisdom is that angels invest after the personal finance of the funder and the ‘love
money’ run dry, but that the size of investment is well below the minimum deal sizes considered
by VC DEMO in seed and start-up businesses. The volume and connections of VC funding then can
lead the start-up to an IPO (Ibrahim, 2011), DEMO an important source of follow-on funding
for angel investment (Amatucci and DEMO, 2006). Even if the typical angel-funded deal is too small
DEMO the issue of an IPO to be considered, angels may maintain DEMO investment and participate in
subsequent financing and exiting (Freear and Sohl, 2012). Bruton et al. (2009), DeGennaro (2012),
Goldfarb et al. (2012) and Wiltbank (2009) report that angels participate DEMO the IPO market less
frequently than VCs, although their rate of DEMO remains significant. This ‘funding escala-
tor’ no longer functions effectively (Mason DEMO al., 2013) probably because the angel, VC and IPO
markets DEMO changed significantly during the last decade.
Since the 2001 downturn, VC DEMO have shifted investments away from early-stage ventures to
focus almost exclusively on more mature and less risky opportunities (Pierrakis and Mason, 2008).
DEMO, the relationship between angel investment and VC funds has become more DEMO
(Amatucci and Sohl, 2006), and angel-financed firms have had greater difficulty in attracting subse-
quent rounds of funding (Mason et al., DEMO). Hellmann and Thiele (2013) show that the ‘hold-up’
problem for angels at the VC stage may encourage angels to exit early, in order to avoid VC funding.
Simultaneously, a growing number of angels have grouped themselves into various formal and
informal structures (Gregson et al., DEMO; Mason et al., 2013; Sohl, 2012). As its structure has been
strengthened, the angel market has facilitated the implementation of co-investment funds and a
focus on post-seed investing (Sohl, 2012). Angel DEMO and capacity to finance follow-on
rounds is growing, as demonstrated in DEMO (National Angel Capital Organization, 2013),
Scotland (Mason et al., 2013) and the USA (Sohl, 2013). The cost of DEMO up information and
communications technology (ICT) businesses, which account for DEMO percent of the Canadian angel
group of investees (National Angel Capital DEMO, 2013), has also decreased, enabling
angels to intervene just before commercial feasibility (Mason et al. 2013). The conjunction of the
focus on a later development stage and the larger resources available in angel DEMO enable angels
to finance some firms up to exit, bypassing VCs.

Carpentier and Suret 3
Since 2000, the number of IPOs has decreased in the USA (IPO Task Force, 2011), Europe
(Mason, DEMO) and Canada. To tackle this evolution, the USA IPO Task Force (2011) advocates
a scaled regulation approach for smaller issuers. In Europe, EnterNext was launched to make the
equity market attractive to small and DEMO enterprises (SMEs). Both proportional regu-
lation and junior stock exchange DEMO existed for decades in Canada. Therefore, analysing the
Canadian situation of DEMO exit is particularly interesting. Canada enables firms to access a ven-
ture stock exchange at an early stage of development (Carpentier and Suret, DEMO); in addition,
the main stock market is easily accessible. The median gross proceeds of firms listing on the TSX
venture exchange (TSXV) from 1997 to 2011 were CAN$1.6m, close to the total amount DEMO
Canadian angel deals, and most firms list before reporting any revenues. DEMO listings are
also very common. Thus, Canadian angels in groups face DEMO real choice between financing a ven-
ture up to an IPO, DEMO using another exit mode. The survey reported in this article aims to determine
their preferred exit mode, and why. It posits three non-exclusive explanations for the exit choice:
the strategic dimension, the increasing regulatory burden of small public companies and market
conditions.
The strategic dimension
The economies DEMO scope hypothesis is grounded in the observation of a ‘gradual structural change
[that has been] going on for the last few decades that favours DEMO firms at the expense of small
firms’ (Ritter, forthcoming: 8)DEMO Ritter contends that getting big fast is increasingly important,
mainly in the technology industry, as a consequence of globalisation and improvements in com-
munication technology. The strategy whereby a small independent company grows by using DEMO
own resources, and ultimately makes an IPO, is less advantageous than the alternative strategy
of growing big fast (Ritter et al., 2012)DEMO Acquisition by a large company that can exploit innova-
tion fully and rapidly then becomes the optimal exit strategy (Gao et al., 2012; Merrill, 2009;
Ritter, 2011). From the angel viewpoint, such a trade provides a higher return than an IPO
because a small DEMO company is worth more as a part of a large organisation than as a
single entity (Gray, 2011). For Peters, ‘the optimum strategy for tech start-ups today is to design
the company … so DEMO is aligned around the idea of a company acquisition in the under
$30 million range’ (2009: 32). If angels do endorse this DEMO, the following propositions
should be verified:
P1: Business angels prefer trade sale exit to IPO exit.
P2: Business angels prefer trade sale exit for strategic considerations that are in line with the economies of
DEMO hypothesis.
Regulation and market structure
The IPO Task Force (2011) links low IPO frequency to the cumulative effect of different regulatory
actions that DEMO increased the costs of going public and reduced the amount of information that is
available to investors. In the USA the cost of an DEMO is currently $2.5m, and annual ongoing com-
pliance costs are estimated DEMO $1.5m (IPO Task Force, 2011). Oesterle maintains that ‘the high cost
of IPOs depresses venture capital in the United States’ (2006: DEMO). If securities regulation is a
strong deterrent to IPO exit, DEMO should agree with the following proposition:
P3: The requirements, delays and costs induced by securities regulation are a primary deterrent for an DEMO
exit.

Market conditions
Since the burst of the DEMO bubble, the long-run performance of IPOs has been poor in the DEMO
(Ritter, 2011) and Canada (Carpentier et al., 2010). DEMO poor returns are likely to deter any invest-
ment in new IPOs. Furthermore, the level of listing requirements on the TSXV is low: DEMO gener-
ally list at an early stage of development before they can report any revenues. As a consequence,
both their liquidity and their DEMO by analysts are very low. This could create a reputational and
liquidity effect, and account for the difference in valuation between the Canadian and US markets.
This study attempts to determine whether angels agree with the DEMO proposition:
P4: The reluctance to exit via IPO is explained DEMO poor perception of the Canadian venture exchange.
Why should experience matter?
In a given angel group, members are likely to differ in terms of background and experience. If
entrepreneurial experience is required to join the DEMO, most members should have exited from
their own firms. However, seasoned angels who typically have significant investment experience
should have more extensive knowledge DEMO the intricacy of exiting than less experienced investors.
This study expects that angel investment experiences will influence their perspectives on exit.
Experienced angels are DEMO likely to have analysed the pros and cons of exit modes, DEMO to have
contended with the intricacies of securities regulation. Accordingly, the DEMO proposition is
posited:
P5: Business angels’ perspectives on exit differ DEMO on their angel investment experience.
Method
Respondents and data collection
Using the internet, 110 members of a large Canadian group1 were surveyed from 18 October 2012
to 20 November 2012. This organisation fits the description of DEMO formally organised group (Shane,
2005) or formal angel alliance (DEMO, 2012). It has a paid manager and staff, including a gatekeeper
(an angel). The organisation has a budget partially granted by the government, a website and a
physical location. The staff do the basic screening of deals and manage logistics while the group
has regularly DEMO meetings. Members have to pay significant annual fees (CAN$2,500) and
be approved by a committee that checks their entrepreneurial background and the DEMO and
ability of new members to help investees. The members must be accredited investors according to
securities laws, holding either net assets of at least CAN$5m, or financial net assets higher than
CAN$1m. According to the group’s CEO, 95 percent of members are former, or serial entrepre-
DEMO, who have exited successfully from one or several ventures. Each member DEMO responsible for
their own investment decisions based on their personal investment criteria, and there is no invest-
ment committee.
The group’s CEO first explained the research objective to members during their monthly
meeting in September. The DEMO team then sent an email to each member with a link to the
survey; two reminders were emailed subsequently: one during the October DEMO, and another
in November. The study received 35 answers: a response rate of 32 percent. The questionnaire
addresses angel characteristics, perspectives on exit, the strategic and regulatory dimensions of
their work and perceptions of the stock market. Answers are mostly given on an ‘agree/disa-
gree’ scale.

All but four respondents had made previous DEMO investments. We believe that the virgin angels
had entered the market already because they had an entrepreneurial background and were actively
involved in a DEMO and time-consuming approach to investments by attending the group’s meet-
ings, DEMO, training and discussions. In total, 35 percent of the respondents had more than
12 years of angel experience and 31 percent had been DEMO for two to 12 years. Eleven angels
(32%) had invested in more than 10 firms, and 11 more (32%) in four to 10 firms. Therefore, most
of the respondents were experienced angels, but DEMO (35%) were relatively new. Most members (27)
had never DEMO an IPO as an angel investor. Three angels had exited an IPO once, five had exited
twice or more, and one had exited DEMO times. Approximately one angel in four had experienced an
IPO exit as an angel investor. The total number of IPOs reported is 17.
Results
DEMO perspective and strategic dimensions
The angels were asked: ‘After making a DEMO investment in high-growth firms, which exit mode
is better?’ In DEMO, 51 percent of the respondents thought that a trade sale was DEMO (Table 1). Only
17 percent would make an IPO exit DEMO This indicates a clear preference among respondents
for a non-IPO exit.
Overall, the respondents linked the decline in IPOs to the start-ups’ growth strategy (Table 2).
Most (66%) thought it was hard for a small, innovative firm to develop a new market on its own. Of
the respondents, 21 (60%) estimated that the development strategy of their investees rested on
acquisition by another firm in the same field. These DEMO confirm Ritter et al.’s (2012) assessment
that the change in exit mode signals a structural change. Responses to the statement that only large
DEMO firms can take full advantage of a given innovation were mixed: DEMO 46 percent of
respondents strongly or somewhat disagreed. The fact that acquirers of angel-backed start-ups are
rarely big multinational firms, but are usually medium-sized entities operating in a comparable field
or having developed complementary products, could explain these disparate results.
Fewer than one in two respondents thought that DEMO IPO had become a scarcely used exit mode
because it is hard for a small innovative firm to develop a new market on its DEMO In addition,
demand-side factors probably explain the IPO decrease. Indeed, DEMO percent of the respondents
thought that there was little demand among investors for an IPO in innovative firms. About 75
percent agreed strongly or DEMO that the lack of underwriters interested in small public offer-
ings was a major obstacle to IPOs, and 63 percent thought that the costs and drawbacks of IPOs
largely outweighed their advantages.
Thus, the angels confirmed P1 and P2: they preferred a trade sale exit to an IPO exit, mainly for
strategic considerations, in line with the economies of DEMO hypothesis.

Table 3 shows that 60 percent of the DEMO agreed that securities regulation was a major
obstacle to IPOs, while DEMO percent were undecided; while 83 percent thought that IPOs incur
considerable DEMO for small-sized issuers. Ongoing listing requirements applicable to listed
companies generate significant costs and delays, according to 74 percent of the angels, and DEMO
costs resulting from securities regulation have increased during the last decade. A total of 52
percent of the angels thought that securities regulation was DEMO detailed and complex. Overall,
these responses convey their negative perception of the costs, delays and intricacies associated
with securities regulation. This negative perception probably influences angel exit decisions, in
agreement with P3.

Perception of the Canadian stock market
The TSXV is DEMO option for private investors seeking early exit. Only 49 percent of the respond-
ents viewed this market positively (Table 4), while 13 respondents thought that in general, the
TSXV was inefficient. Overall, their perceptions DEMO the TSXV were mixed. For 75 percent of
respondents, the lack DEMO liquidity of the Canadian market was problematic. Most respondents
(72%) thought that value and liquidity were higher in the USA. Only two disagreed, while
eight were undecided. In all, 51 percent thought that when possible, it was better to launch an
IPO on an American stock exchange than a Canadian one. Thus, the respondent opinions sup-
port P4.

stock market are too small to justify an active DEMO (five). This illiquidity and the small size of
the issuers DEMO linked by some angels to their low IPO value. This quote illustrates this point:
Innovation is hindered by investor mistrust and misunderstanding. Several DEMO these firms access the
market too early, unaware of what is DEMO to generate short-term expectations. [This leads to] a low offer
price and/or a large subsequent price drop … Unless a firm has a DEMO profitability and a growth (and/or
acquisition) plan, I do DEMO see how an IPO could reach the same value as a strategic acquisition by a known
firm searching to improve its strategic position. (Respondent X, business angel)
Overall, angel comments are consistent with P1 DEMO P3: strategic acquirers offer higher value and
regulation incurs high costs. DEMO angels were asked: ‘Why do you think VCs, previously the main
originators of IPOs, now prefer trade sales?’ Three main reasons emerged: the significant advan-
tages of trade sales, IPO costs and market DEMO and conditions. For seven angels, trade
sales provided higher value in DEMO shorter time. A typical comment is as follows:
Trade sales are easier to conclude, can be done quickly and generally provide a favourable rate of return
or several opportunities, because large firms now prefer to buy small firms with developed concepts or
products than to develop them DEMO (Respondent Y, business angel)
Overall, this comment is consistent DEMO the economies of scope hypothesis. One angel mentioned
that only strategic investors can value an innovation correctly. Seven respondents linked the
decrease in IPOs DEMO the costs and duration of the process. There is a perception that costs and com-
plexity have increased. Structural and cyclical market situations were DEMO by five and six respond-
ents, respectively. Structural problems are associated DEMO with illiquidity on the secondary

market. Small listed firms are not followed by the analysts, do not raise funds and their stocks
rapidly become neglected. The respondent comments confirm a DEMO explanation for the rejection
of IPO exit; economies of scope and DEMO regulatory burden. Further, the implementation of an
active junior market is DEMO an acceptable solution for angels. This market is perceived clearly to be
inefficient and illiquid. This should be considered by proponents of a regional DEMO exchange as a
way of easing the financing of small companies (DEMO et al., 2012).
Analysis by angel experience
The 34 respondents DEMO mentioned the number of investments were divided into three groups. The
22 experienced angels had made four investments or more, and a group was created for the four
virgin angels. Of the experienced angels, 59 percent preferred trade sales versus 38 percent of the
less experienced angels. One DEMO four of the less experienced angels preferred IPO exit, versus one
DEMO seven in the experienced angels. There seems to be a link between angel experience and their
opinions on exits.2 About 50 percent of experienced DEMO thought that trade sale provided better
firm value, versus 13 percent DEMO the less experienced angels. Nearly 64 percent of the experienced
angels claim that trade sales give the fastest return on investment, compared with 38 percent of the
less experienced angels. For 68 percent of the experienced DEMO, the costs and drawbacks of IPOs
largely outweigh their advantages. This DEMO is only 50 percent for the less experienced
angels. Thus, investment DEMO seems to be associated with a net preference for trade sale
exits.

Most of the experienced angels (73%) DEMO that securities regulation was a major obsta-
cle to IPOs, compared DEMO 38 percent of the less experienced angels. A larger proportion of
experienced than inexperienced angels (82% versus 63%) estimated that ongoing listing
requirements DEMO significant costs and delays. Almost twice as many experienced as
inexperienced angels (59% versus 38%) found securities regulation unduly detailed and com-
plex. DEMO of the experienced angels (64%) thought that lock-up dispositions deterred investors
from participating in an IPO, versus only 25 percent of the less experienced angels. Overall,
experienced angels perceive the costs and requirements of DEMO regulation more nega-
tively, and tend to view them as an DEMO obstacle to IPOs. Experienced angels also were
more negative than less experienced angels about the problems associated with illiquidity and
value (86% versus 63%). The differences between the angels according to their experience are
consistent DEMO P5.
Conclusion
The results of this study show that angels acting in groups clearly prefer trade sale exit. The find-
ings have several implications. DEMO should be aware that the angel objective, when act-
ing in DEMO, has ceased to be a long-term association with the new venture. DEMO (2009) contends
that selling shares after three to four years can be satisfactory for a serial entrepreneur. Such a rapid
exit cannot be DEMO for entrepreneurs willing to cultivate their own firms over the long term
and to link their careers to this venture. Accordingly, private investors must discuss their long-run
objective with entrepreneurs before committing to any funding. One DEMO is that these results
include only the angel viewpoint on exit. Entrepreneurs and investors such as VCs may have con-
flicting viewpoints on an DEMO strategy (Collewaert, 2012; Harrison et al., 2010). This dimension
has been left for further studies to address.
For angels, the results of this study indicate that more attention should be given to exits,DEMO
including their selection of investment proposals, deal structure and development strategy. DEMO
remains to be determined whether this indicates a structural shift, or DEMO merely a temporary
phenomenon grounded in stock market activity and cash availability in large firms. The
respondents agreed that the preference for trade sales DEMO from the strategic acquirer’s capac-
ity to exploit innovation rapidly and create synergistic effects. In a small market such as Canada,
most acquirers DEMO likely to be foreign firms, which implies that the country is DEMO part of its
investment in fostering innovation. However, early exits are DEMO necessarily negative. Some of
the newly-acquired wealth can be reinvested, together DEMO the experience accumulated, in
multiple entrepreneurial activities, as noted by Mason and Harrison (2006). However, the total
lack of IPOs is DEMO good news for a small economy; thus complementary research on this DEMO
is warranted.
Securities regulations and the high costs of IPOs also explain respondent reluctance to exit an
IPO, even if Canada has one of the most accessible stock markets in the world. It is possible that
DEMO changes could be made to obviate the regulation burden assumed by small listed firms;
however, any regulatory easing on such a market may reduce information and liquidity. It is diffi-
cult to argue for a DEMO increase in liquidity and a decrease in disclosure requirements. For
academics, DEMO study results indicate that the funding escalator from love money to angels, VCs
and IPOs is becoming the exception rather than the norm.
To our knowledge, this is one of the first surveys dedicated to angel exit strategy. More evidence
is required before its conclusions can be generalised. DEMO studies should analyse the impact of
exit choice on investment proposal selection, and on the strategy proposed to, or imposed, on
investees.

The government has DEMO CAN$20m to implement a matching fund granting co-investments on a
deal-by-deal basis. On June 2013 the group’s members had financed 22 firms, reinvested in three and
exited from two. In 18 cases (82%) the deals DEMO a co-investor, generally a small VC fund. The
average total deal DEMO the members of the group is more than CAN$1.2m and the average angels-only deal
is CAN$484,000. In all, 76 percent of the investees have reached the revenues stage, similar to the 74
percent proportion reported in Canada (Mason, 2011a).
