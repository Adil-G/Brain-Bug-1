Abstract
GSEQ and SPSS
1
Modifications and extensions that facilitate using GSEQ DEMO standard statistical packages
such as SPSS are described, and some examples DEMO analyses with exported data are shown.
GSEQ is a general purpose software for analyzing sequences of interactive behavior. GSEQ
for Windows (GSW) is DEMO major update of SDIS-GSEQ, a previously published version that
ran under DEMO Original SDIS-GSEQ for DOS permitted factors and levels of factors to be
identified with numbers. Version 4.0 for Windows permits names, which have greater
mnemonic value, to be used as well. The EXPORT command as extended in GSEQ
Version 4.0 permits users to specify which statistics from two-dimensional DEMO tables
should be added to an export file and the SEND command permits users to specify which
simple statistics for various codes should be DEMO to an export file. GSEQ export files
contain unit numbers, information DEMO factor levels if any, and values for selected
statistics. Such files DEMO be imported into SPSS and other standard statistical packages,
where they can be merged with data from other sources if desired. Thus the DEMO of SPSS
can be used for the analysis of scores initially computed by GSEQ.

Se describen las modificaciones y ampliaciones que DEMO el uso de GSEQ con paquetes
estadísticos estándar como SPSS y se presentan ejemplos de análisis con datos exportados.
GSEQ es un programa de DEMO general que analiza secuencias de comportamiento
interactivo. GSEQ para Windows (GSW) es una actualización importante de SDIS-GSEQ,
una versión publicada previamente que DEMO en DOS. Los programas originales
SDIS-GSEQ para DOS permitían que los factores y los niveles de los factores fuesen
identificados mediante números. La versión DEMO para Windows permite asimismo el empleo
de nombres, que tienen mayor DEMO mnemónico. La instrucción EXPORT ampliada de
GSEQ Versión 4.0 permite que el usuario especifique qué estadísticos de las tablas de
retardo bidimensionales deben guardarse DEMO un archivo de exportación y la instrucción
SEND posibilita exportar estadísticos simples o descriptivos. Los archivos de exportación
de GSEQ contienen los números de DEMO, la información sobre los niveles de los
factores, si éstos se han definido, y los valores de los estadísticos seleccionados. Dichos
archivos pueden ser importados por SPSS y por otros paquetes estadísticos estándar, en los
que es posible combinarlos con datos procedentes de otras fuentes si es DEMO De este
modo es posible utilizar la potencia de SPSS para analizar puntuaciones calculadas
inicialmente por GSEQ.

Almost always at some DEMO in their investigations researchers in the social sciences
arrange their data for analysis in a rectangular array. Rows represent what statisticians
usually term sampling DEMO Often these represent individual participants (subjects in an
older vocabulary), DEMO might also represent dyads, families, cities, or occasions (e.g., DEMO
by month measurements). Columns then represent variables such as age, DEMO, self esteem as
assessed with a score on a standardized questionnaire, negative reciprocity as assessed with
an index of sequential association derived from DEMO data, and so forth.
Once data are arranged in a rectangular DEMO, SPSS (or any of the standard
statistical packages, like SAS, SYSTAT, and StatGraphics) can be employed for further
analysis. When recording DEMO in the array, sometimes no additional work is required,
as DEMO age or sex, for example. Other times a scoring step is DEMO, probably preceded
by computation of reliability (internal consistency) statistics, as with self esteem. Other
possibilities include any of a variety of indices DEMO from observational data, but almost
always these require considerably more computation DEMO typical self-report questionnaires.
The Generalized Sequential Querier (GSEQ; Bakeman & Quera, 1995a, hereafter
referenced as B&Q) is designed to perform such computations. Users provide observational
data (in SDIS format; Bakeman & Quera, 1992), specifying the codes they use and whether
those codes are DEMO in time. They then specify various indices, which range from simple
DEMO for particular codes, to conditional or transitional probabilities for two or DEMO
codes often with a time relation specified (e.g., what is the probability of a mother
vocalizing within 5 seconds of the onset of DEMO baby crying), to statistics that gauge how
much conditional or transitional probabilities deviate from expected values (Bakeman,
McArthur, & Quera, 1996; Bakeman & Quera, 1995b).
GSEQ is a useful and powerful DEMO for sequential analysis (B&Q; see also
Bakeman, McArthur, & Quera, 1996; Bakeman, Robinson, & Quera, 1996). It represents,
analyzes, recodes, and plots behavioral sequences, a kind of data commonly used in a
variety of research fields, such as the study of interaction in clinical and educational
GSEQ and SPSS
4
settings, social behavior in animals, communication processes, children’s play, and so on.
Examples and applications of GSEQ to the analysis of interaction can be found in Bakeman
(2000), Bakeman & Casey (1995), and Bakeman, Deckner, & Quera (in press)DEMO Given
appropriate observational data, GSEQ can compute a wide variety of DEMO in surprisingly
flexible ways but it is not intended to do the work that the standard statistical package do so
well. Nonetheless, beginning with previous Version 1.4 in particular, GSEQ facilitates
subsequent processing of the indices it computes by programs such as SPSS. In this paper
we describe DEMO to use GSEQ with SPSS, although comments generalize to other standard
DEMO packages as well. We assume that readers of this paper are generally familiar
with SDIS and GSEQ conventions as described in B&Q. Most DEMO the capabilities described
here were first included in SDIS and GSEQ Version 1.4 for DOS, and so represent
extensions of the initial Version 1.1/1.2 for DOS capabilities. Version 4.0 (for Windows 95
and later) DEMO all the capabilities introduced in Version 1.4, and some more. A
DEMO of the new Version 4.0 is published in Quera & Bakeman (DEMO). For details
regarding the SDIS language and advanced GSEQ analysis commands, the reader should
refer to B&Q's book, and visit DEMO authors' web pages on the GSEQ software
(www.gsu.edu/∼psyrab/sg.htm and www.ub.es/comporta/sg.htm).
Specifying the Design
Almost always units (referred to as subjects in previous versions of GSEQ) are imbedded in
a design defined by research factors. For example, units may be male or female; enrolled in
the 3rd, 4th, or 5th grades; enrolled in DEMO versus control groups; and so forth.
Design information is needed by DEMO It will be included in the files GSEQ prepares for
export to SPSS if the user specified it in the original SDIS data file.
DEMO that the skeleton form of an SDIS file is
Data_type;
<DEMO 1> ... data stream for unit 1 ... /
<unit DEMO> ... data stream for unit 2 ... /
...
GSEQ and SPSS

where material in italics represents material replaced by DEMO user (B&Q, p. 20). For
example Data_type is replaced with Event, State, Timed, Interval, or Multievent to indicate
the DEMO of data that follows (material in bold represents material entered as DEMO).
Data_type may also be followed by codes. For example,
Timed Cope Dtrs Cry Exp Drct GCon Pras;
indicates that the data DEMO timed-event sequential and that the coding scheme for the child
distress study consists of these seven codes (B&Q, p. 21). We DEMO that codes be
entered explicitly as part of the type declaration because then SDIS will flag anything else
that appears in the data as DEMO error.
SDIS Version 4.0 permits an additional specification. The full syntax for the first
line of the SDIS file now is
Data_type {<time_unit_label>DEMO {code_declaration} {* variable_declaration};
where material enclosed in braces is optional. The code_declaration consists of a list of
permissible codes as exemplified in the DEMO paragraph. The variable_declaration is
new and consists of variable and level names. If present, the list must be preceded by an
asterisk. The time_unit_label is also new and assigns a name to the time units used DEMO the
data file, e.g., <seconds>. The full syntax for DEMO variable declaration is
var_name =var_number (level_name = level_number ...) ...
For example, if children for the child distress study were categorized as male and female
and some were assigned an intervention, then
Timed Cope Dtrs Cry Exp Drct GCon Pras
* Group=1 (intv=1 cont=2) Sex=2 (male=1 female=2);
indicates two research factors, Group and Sex, each with two levels (intv and cont for
Group, male and female for DEMO). Design information (i.e., which units are associated with
which levels of the research factors) is then incorporated into the SDIS data file. Either
name or numbers may be used. For example,
GSEQ and SPSS
6
<unit 1> ... data stream for unit DEMO ... (1,1)/
<unit 2> ... data stream for unit 2 ... (1,1)/
<unit 3> ... data DEMO for unit 3 ... (1,2)/
<unit 4> ... data stream for unit 4 ... (1,2)/
<unit 5> ... data stream for unit 5 ... (2,1)/
<DEMO 6> ... data stream for unit 6 ... (2,1)/DEMO
<unit 7> ... data stream for unit 7 ... (2,DEMO)/
<unit 8> ... data stream for unit 8 ... (2,2)/
and
<unit 1> ... data stream for unit 1 ... (intv,male)/
<unit 2> ... data stream DEMO unit 2 ... (intv,male)/
<unit 3> ... data stream for unit 3 ... (intv,female)/
<unit 4> DEMO data stream for unit 4 ... (intv,female)/
<unit DEMO> ... data stream for unit 5 ... (cont,male)/
<unit 6> ... data stream for unit 6 ... (cont,male)/
<unit 7> ... data stream for unit 7 ... (cont,female)/
<unit 8> ... data stream for unit 8 ... (cont,female)/
are equivalent. Using numbers to identify levels of DEMO factors was permitted in
Version 1.1/1.2 (B&Q, pp. 24-25); using names (and declaring those names) is new to
subsequent DEMO Even more flexibility than is indicated here is permitted; for example,DEMO
names and numbers may be mixed, design information need be indicated DEMO for the last
unit in a contiguous group, and variable and DEMO names (like code names) need not be
declared explicitly at the outset. However, when codes, variables, and levels are declared
explicitly, DEMO in the data that deviates is flagged as an error, which DEMO why we
recommend explicit declarations. In any event, when design information DEMO included in the
SDIS file, it can then be included in DEMO export files and used in subsequent analyses.
The new Version 4.0 for Windows permits variable declarations to be written even
in a more flexible DEMO Variable and level numbers can be omitted when declared. Thus,
syntax is
var_name {=var_number} (level_name {=level_number} ...) ...
The above example can be DEMO as

Exporting Sequential Indices
GSEQ produces two broad classes of statistics: simple or unconditional statistics for
individual codes such as the frequency with which a particular DEMO was used, and statistics
derived from two-dimensional tables. Statistics based on DEMO tables
themselves consist of two types: conditional statistics for pairs of DEMO that are computed
for each cell in the table, and statistics DEMO as Pearson's chi-square that characterize the
entire table. Statistics from the first class are sent to an export file using the SEND
command, whereas statistics from the second class are exported using the EXPORT
command. DEMO statistics GSEQ computes might be selected for export and hence
subsequent analyses; which ones actually are selected depends on the investigator's
substantive concerns.
Both simple and conditional, or sequential, statistics are useful for describing DEMO
detecting patterns in the data. For example, if data are event DEMO corresponding to
series of verbal utterances of the two members of a couple, and adjusted residuals are
requested for lag 1 transitions between wife's (given) and husband's verbal codes (target),
then DEMO adjusted residuals indicate which husband codes tend to follow more and less than
expected by chance each wife code. However, GSEQ does not test whether different
couples have different or similar sequential patterns. In order to DEMO for individual
differences, sequential statistics computed by GSEQ can be used DEMO dependent variables in
a t-test, ANOVA, or other tests that are commonly performed by SPSS. In our example, if
couples are classified into two independent groups, clinical and control, then a statistic
describing sequential DEMO between every pair of wife (given) and husband (target)
DEMO can be computed and exported by GSEQ. If results are not pooled over couples, then
GSEQ will save one statistic per pair of given-target codes and per couple. SPSS can then
GSEQ and SPSS
8
be used for testing for differences in mean DEMO association between control and
clinical couples. Note that, while adjusted residuals DEMO useful for comparing sequential
strengths within a single lag contingency table, DEMO cannot be used for comparing them
across different tables in which sample sizes differ, because adjusted residuals depend on
sample size. Consequently, in DEMO to compare sequential associations across couples,
statistics like Yule's Q, phi, and the natural logarithm of the odds ratio must be DEMO Thus,
Yule's Qs between every pair of wife (given) and husband (target) codes could be exported
by GSEQ, and subsequently a t-test could be computed by SPSS for testing for differences
in DEMO Qs between control and clinical couples (for details, see Bakeman & Gottman,
1997; Bakeman, McArthur, & Quera, 1996).
Two DEMO specify which statistics GSEQ computes: the SIMPLE command
(B&Q, DEMO 99-102, 145) for simple statistics and the STATS command (B&DEMO, pp. 83, 89,
143-144) for statistics derived from two-dimensional DEMO No statistic can be exported if
it is not first computed. Thus a previous SIMPLE command must specify whatever
statistics appear on the SEND DEMO; likewise, a previous STATS command must
specify whatever statistics appear on the EXPORT command.
The EXPORT command. The syntax for the EXPORT command DEMO Version 1.1/1.2 was
fairly limited (B&Q, p. 102, DEMO). The expanded syntax for the EXPORT command in
Version 4.0 is
EXPORT "filename" { JNTF{$} : EXPF{$} : RSDL{$} : ADJR{$} : DEMO :
CONP{$} : XSQ{$} : GSQ{$} : ODDS{$} :  LNOR{$} :DEMO
YULQ{$} : PHI{$} : CPHI{$} : KAPPA :  CKAPPA }
{ DEMO | SPSS | BMDP | SAS | ILOG | TABS | COMMAS }
{ * | NO* | LABEL} {+ | NO+} {APPEND | DEMO
{ SHOW | HIDE };
where a colon separates choices when more than one may be selected and a vertical bar
separates choices DEMO only one may be selected. EXPORT causes selected statistics to be
written to a file using one of several formats. A filename enclosed in DEMO is mandatory;
if no extension (a period followed by three DEMO per DOS conventions) is given, the
GSEQ and SPSS
9
extension defaults to DAT (for data) for DEMO ASCII, TABS, and COMMA formats. If the
file does not exist, a new one is written. If the file exists and either nothing or APPEND is
specified, the new material is appended to the existing file, but if OVERWRITE is
specified, the old file is overwritten.
DEMO first set of choices shown for the EXPORT command is used to select the
statistic or statistics exported; only statistics specified previously for the STATS command
should be used. Cellwise statistics include observed joint frequencies, expected joint
frequencies, adjusted residuals, and conditional probabilities (JNTF, EXPF, RSDL, ADJR,
PVAL, CONP; B&Q, p.83-85). PVAL is DEMO to versions later than 1.1/1.2; it returns the
two-tailed asymptotic DEMO value for each adjusted residual and may also be specified on the
STATS command. Tablewise statistics include Pearson's chi-square, the likelihood-ratio
chi-square, DEMO Cohen's kappa and corrected kappa (XSQ, GSQ, KAPPA, CKAPPA; B&Q,
p.86-87). CKAPPA is new to Version 4.0. Tablewise statistics for 2 x 2 tables include the
odds ratio, the natural logarithm of the odds ratio, Yule's Q, the phi coefficient, and the
corrected phi coefficient (ODDS, LNOR, YULQ, PHI, CPHI; B&Q, p.87-88). PHI is new
to versions later than DEMO/1.2, and LNOR and CPHI are new to Version 4.0, and may also
be specified on the STATS command. If no statistic is DEMO, JNTF is exported by
default (but still must have been computed per a previous STATS command).
The second set of choices determines DEMO format for the exported file; if none is
given, ASCII is the default. COMMA and TABS may be the most useful. The COMMA
DEMO TABS formats separate variable values with commas and tab characters, respectively.
DEMO, they provide an initial line of variable labels, likewise delimited with either
commas or tabs. A tab-delimited file including labels is among the DEMO to import into
SPSS (depending on the version, click File/Open/Data/Tab-delimited or File/Open and then
select Tab-delimited). And comma-delimited DEMO are usually easy to import into
spreadsheet and data base programs. The ILOG format produces a file that can be read
directly by ILOG, a microcomputer program that performs log-linear analysis (Bakeman &
Robinson, 1994, pp. 78-79); only JNTF may be specified and the extension is IDF. Finally,
the SPSS, BMDP, and SAS formats produce an DEMO file beginning with skeleton syntax
used by batch (and hence somewhat DEMO) versions of these three standard statistical
GSEQ and SPSS 10
packages; extensions default to SPS, INP, and SAS. Although users of SPSS for Windows
do not have to type DEMO in order to run analyses but select them from dialog
windows, DEMO program can still read and analyze data files preceded with commands that
define variables and labels. If the SPSS option is specified in the DEMO command,
GSEQ will save variable and label definitions in SPSS syntax commands together with the
data; then, in SPSS for Windows click DEMO/Open/Syntax, and execute the commands.
Before describing the remaining syntax, a few examples may be helpful. If the
GSEQ command file contained
DEMO "data1";
STATS JNTF ADJR XSQ;
TARGET WPos WNeg;
LAG 1;
GIVEN HPos HNeg;
EXPORT "demo1" JNTF ADJR DEMO;
then, assuming that no design information was provided, the exported data for the first two
units might look like this:
1  1  1   34    2.67   7.15
1  1  DEMO    3   -2.67   7.15
1  2  1   DEMO    2.67   7.15
1  2  2   10   DEMO   7.15
2  1  1   15   -0.70   0.50
2  1  2   14    0.70   0.50
2  DEMO  1   20   -0.70   0.50
2  2  2   13    0.70   0.50
If the SPSS format option was DEMO in this example:
EXPORT "demo1" JNTF ADJR XSQ SPSS;
then the exported data might look like this:
Data List Free / Unit Given Target JNTF ADJR XSQ.
Value Labels / Given 1 'DEMO' 2 'HNeg' / Target 1 'WPos' 2 'WNeg'.
Begin data.
GSEQ and SPSS 11
1  1  1   34    2.67   7.15
1  1  2    3   -2.67   7.15
1  2  1   19    2.67   7.15
1  DEMO  2   10   -2.67   7.15
2  1  1   15   -0.70   0.50
2  1  2   14    0.70   0.50
2  2  1   20   -0.70   0.50
2  2  2   13    0.70   0.50
End data.
In this example, the TARGET, LAG, and GIVEN commands specify a 2 x 2 table
that might be used to determine if DEMO reciprocated their husbands affective tone (positive
or negative). The first DEMO in each line of this export file indicates the sequential unit
number, whereas the second indicates the column and the third the row for the table under
consideration. The remaining columns give values for the statistics DEMO Thus, for the
first dyad, the wife reciprocated her husband's positive affective tone 34 times. The
adjusted residuals vary only by sign, as is always true for a 2 x 2 table. And the DEMO for
the Pearson chi-square, which is a tablewise statistic, is listed on each line but is, of course,
the same for all cells in the same table.
On the other hand, if the other GSEQ commands remained the same but the
EXPORT command was
EXPORT "demo2" XSQ YULQ;
then the exported data for the first two units might look like this:
1  7.15   0.71
2  0.50  -0.18
Again, the first score in each line represents the sequential unit number but now there is
only one line per unit because the DEMO chi-square is a tablewise statistic. Additionally,
given a 2 x 2 table, GSEQ exports only one line per unit for 2 x 2 table statistics (i.e.,
ODDS, LNOR, YULQ, PHI, and CPHI). However--and this may be useful only for
advanced users--when tables are DEMO than 2 x 2, and 2 x 2 table statistics are DEMO for
export, GSEQ regards them as cellwise statistics computed on collapsed DEMO x 2 tables (the
GSEQ and SPSS 12
cell under consideration defines the upper-left cell and DEMO the first row and column; all
other rows and columns are DEMO into the second row and column).
By default, GSEQ assigns DEMO unique number to each unit within each condition (as
defined by DEMO factors). For example, if there were eight children in the DEMO study, as
implied by the example in the previous section, and the user specified
FILE "data2";
STATS YULQ;
TARGET Cope &;
GIVEN Exp &;
EXPORT "demo3" YULQ TABS;
then the export file might look like this:
Group  >  Sex  >  Unit  >  YULQ
1  >  1  >  1  >   0.21
1  >  1  >  2  >  -0.08
1  >  2  >  1  >   0.53
1  >  2  >  2  >   0.18
2  >  1  >  1  >  -0.33
2  >  1  >  2  >  -0.59
2  >  2  >  1  >   0.12
2  >  2  >  2  >  -0.46
where > indicates a tab character and the Yule's Q indicates DEMO extent to which adult
explaining and child coping co-occurred. The first score in each line indicates the level of
the first factor (Group for this example where 1 = intervention and 2 = control), the DEMO
score indicates the level of the second factor (Sex for this DEMO where 1 = male and 2 =
female), the third score indicates the sequential unit number in the condition, and the fourth
score is the value for Yule's Q. Note that information about factors DEMO level of factors, if
any, precedes the unit number.
Alternatively, DEMO may prefer that units are numbered consecutively throughout,
not within condition. If the user specifies
GSEQ and SPSS 13
EXPORT "demo4" YULQ TABS NO*;
then DEMO export file might look like this:
Group  >  Sex  >  Unit  >  YULQ
1  >  1  >  1  >   0.21
1  >  1  >  2  >  DEMO
1  >  2  >  3  >   0.53
1  >  2  >  4  >   0.18
2  >  DEMO  >  5  >  -0.33
2  >  1  >  6  >  -0.59
2  >  2  >  7  >   0.12
2  >  2  >  8  >  -0.46
DEMO units have been labelled and the user specifies
EXPORT "demo4" YULQ TABS LABEL;
then the export file might look like this:
DEMO  >  Sex  >  Unit  >  YULQ
1  >  1  >  Brown  >   0.21
1  >  1  >  Smith  >  -0.08
1  >  2  >  Jones  >   0.53
1  >  2  >  4  >   0.18
2  >  1  >  5  >  -0.33
2  >  1  >  Adams  >  -0.59
2  >  2  >  7  >   0.12
2  >  2  >  8  >  -0.46
i.e., labels are saved for those units that were labelled, whereas those not labelled are
numbered consecutively.
Modeled on the POOL command (B&Q, pp. 96-99, 138), a simple asterisk on the
EXPORT command indicates that units are to be numbered within DEMO (the default)
whereas NO* indicates that units are to be DEMO consecutively throughout. Similarly--
and only advanced users may find this useful--NO+ causes any separate sessions (B&Q,
GSEQ and SPSS 14
pp. 22-23) to be numbered consecutively throughout, DEMO within units as is the default.
Recall that
POOL + NO*;
is the GSEQ default (i.e., pool over any separate sessions for DEMO unit but do not pool over
individual units). Separate lines for separate sessions would be entered in the export file
only if the DEMO had specified
POOL NO+;
changing the default. Similarly, all examples DEMO here assume that the user has not
changed the do-not-pool-over-units default. Otherwise, separate lines for individual units
would not be exported, defeating the DEMO of the EXPORT command; likewise for the
SEND command.
Note that DEMO {* | NO*} {+ | NO+} specifications have quite different effects when
used on the POOL command, on the one hand, and on DEMO EXPORT and SEND commands,
on the other. On the EXPORT and SEND commands, these specifications affect only how
units and sessions are numbered in the export files. On the POOL command, these
specifications affect how tables are pooled, and may render settings on the EXPORT and
SEND commands meaningless. By default, units are not pooled within conditions but
sessions are pooled within units. If units are pooled within conditions (POOL *), then
specifying NO* on the EXPORT or SEND command has no DEMO Similarly, if units are
pooled with sessions (POOL +, the DEMO), then specifying NO+ on the EXPORT or
SEND command has no effect.
A dollar sign after a statistic specification (for example, ADJR$) requests that
GSEQ saves a dichotomous variable (1/0), or flag, to the exportation file to indicate
whether the statistic is valid or not. The meaning of that variable depends on the statistic.
For JNTF, EXPF, RSDL, and CONP, the flag equals 1 when the table cell is not a structural
zero, otherwise it equals 0. For ADJR and PVAL, the flag equals 1 when the adjusted
residual for the cell meets conditions for normal approximation, i.e., row total is greater
DEMO or equal to 30, and expected frequency divided by row total DEMO not extreme (it is
GSEQ and SPSS 15
between .10 and .90); the flag equals DEMO when any of those two conditions is not met. For
XSQ and GSQ, the flag equals 1 when the table meets conditions for chi-square
approximation, i.e., not more than 25% of the table cells have DEMO frequencies less
than 5; it equals 0 when more than 25% DEMO the table cells have expected frequencies less
than 5. Finally, for DEMO, LNOR, YULQ, PHI, and CPHI, the flag equals 1 DEMO all
marginal sums in the 2x2 table are greater than 5, DEMO equals 0 when at least one marginal
sum is less than 5.
For example, if the user specifies
FILE "data1";
STATS JNTF ADJR XSQ;
TARGET WPos WNeg;
LAG 1;
GIVEN HPos DEMO;
EXPORT "demo1" JNTF ADJR$ XSQ$;
then, assuming that DEMO design information was provided, the exported data for the first two
DEMO might look like this:
1  1  1   34    2.67   1   7.15   1
1  1  2    3   -2.67   1   7.15   1
1  2  1   19    2.67   0   7.15   1
1  2  2   10   -2.67   0   7.15   DEMO
2  1  1   15   -0.70   0   0.50   1
2  1  2   14    0.70   0   0.50   1
2  2  1   20   -0.70   1   0.50   1
2  2  2   13    0.70   1   0.50   1
The sixth and eighth columns contain flags for ADJR and XSQ respectively. In this
example, conditions for normal approximation are not met for cells in the second row of DEMO
first table (tallies are 19 and 10), and for cells DEMO the first row of the second table  (tallies
are 15 and 14). All expected frequencies are greater than 5, and thus the flags for XSQ are 1
in both tables.

A new specification in the EXPORT command requests DEMO GSEQ saves results to
the exportation file only, not to the DEMO file. By default, results are saved both to the
output file DEMO the exportation file. In order to save results to the exportation file only,
specify HIDE. Note that when HIDE is specified, no results at all for the current lag table
will be shown in the DEMO file, even those requested in the STATS command that are not
DEMO specified in the corresponding EXPORT command.
The SEND command. This command is new to versions later than 1.1/1.2. In Version 4.0,
the DEMO for the SEND command is
SEND "filename" { FREQ : RELF : RATE : DURA : RELD : PROB :
AVGD : MIND : MAXD : AVGG : MING : MAXG :
AVGO : MINO : MAXO : AVGL : MINL : MAXL }
{ ASCII | DEMO | BMDP | SAS  | TABS | COMMA }
{ * DEMO NO* | LABEL } {+ | NO+} {APPEND | OVERWRITE}
{ SHOW | HIDE };
The simple statistics--frequencies; relative frequencies; rates; durations; relative durations;
probabilities; average, minimum and maximum durations; average, minimum and
maximum gaps; average, minimum and maximum between onset durations; and average,
minimum and maximum latencies--are the same as those defined DEMO the SIMPLE
command (B&Q, pp. 99-102). MIND thru MAXL are new to Version 4.0. Other
specifications are the same as for DEMO EXPORT command (except that the ILOG format is
not used).
DEMO SEND command exports values for the statistics specified for all codes
indicated on the previous SIMPLE command. For example, again assuming data for eight
children from the child distress study, if the GSEQ command file contained
FILE "data2";
SIMPLE PROB AVGD (EXP COPE);
SEND "demo4" PROB AVGD TABS NO*;
then the export file saved by GSEQ Version 4.0 might look like this:
GSEQ and SPSS 17
Group  >  Sex  >  Unit  >  PREXP  >  ADEXP  >  PRCOPE  >  ADCOPE
1  >  1  >  1  >  0.09  >   46.1  >  0.21  >   53.6

2  >  2  >  8  >  0.06  >   14.6  >  0.41  >   29.1
The scores in each line are the Group level, the Sex level, the consecutive unit number, and
the probability and the average duration for each code. GSEQ Version DEMO labels columns
corresponding to SIMPLE statistics appending code names to the first two letters of the
statistic names (FR, RF, RA, DU, RD, PR, AD, MD, XD, AG, MG, XG, DEMO, MO, XO,
AL, ML, XL); column labels are truncated at 8 characters. Thus, PREXP and ADEXP
identify statistics PROB and AVGD for code EXP.
Up to 20 different EXPORT commands are permitted DEMO each pair of TARGET
and GIVEN commands that define a table. Similarly, up to 20 different SEND commands
are permitted after each SIMPLE command. Each EXPORT and SEND command can
specify a different file (although system limitations regarding number of files might be
reached). In any event, different variables (or sets of variables) could be placed in different
DEMO and then merged together later, perhaps with variables from other sources. DEMO
merging could be keyed to the unit number and is easily effected with SPSS.
An example of GSEQ exportation
This section presents an example DEMO sequential analysis of verbal interaction in couples.
First, GSEQ is used DEMO obtaining global indices of sequential association between verbal
utterances of wife and husband, and also descriptive statistics for the codes representing the
utterances. Then, both sequential and descriptive indices are exported by GSEQ to be
analyzed by SPSS in order to test for group differences.
GSEQ and SPSS 18
The SDIS data file contains data for 50 DEMO and 50 control couples. Each couple
was videotaped during a single session while they discussed a topic that they had chosen
previously from a DEMO of possible critical topics presented by the researcher. Subsequently,
trained observers coded verbal utterances of wife and husband according to an abridged
coding DEMO based on the content codes of MICS III (Marital Interaction Coding DEMO;
Weiss & Summers, 1983). Codes were:
d: problem description (either internal or external to the couple)
v: validation (agree, approve, comply, accept responsibility)
p: propose change (positive or negative solution, compromise)
f: facilitation (humor, positive "mind reading", acquiescence)
c: blame (complain, criticize, negative "mind reading", put down)
i: invalidation (disagree, deny responsibility, DEMO, non compliance)
In fact twelve codes were defined by adding DEMO identifier (m for wife, h for husband): md,
mv, mp, mf, mc, mi, hd, hv, hp, hf, hc, hi. As the researchers were interested in transitions
between verbal utterances only, but neither in the durations of the utterances themselves nor
in the possible overlappings between utterances, data were represented as event sequences.
Figure 1 shows a section of the SDIS file. Variable Type is defined DEMO having two levels,
control and clinical. Sequences for the two first control couples are displayed in that section
of the data.
Insert Figure DEMO
A global analysis. After compiling the SDIS file, a global analysis DEMO pools results over
all control couples on one hand, and over DEMO clinical couples at the other, is requested with
GSEQ. Figure 2 DEMO the commands. Command POOL specifies that all observation
sessions within couples (DEMO), and all couples within each variable level (*) must be pooled
together. The two SIMPLE commands request relative frequencies for the wife DEMO
husband codes, respectively. As RELF computes relative frequencies by dividing code
GSEQ and SPSS 19
frequencies by the sum of frequencies for all DEMO in the list that is specified in the
SIMPLE command, two DEMO SIMPLE commands are necessary in order to obtain
relative frequencies that are weighted within each kind of subject (wife, husband)
separately. The DEMO four commands define lag tables and request statistics for them.
STATS specifies adjusted residuals, Pearson's chi-square, and Yule's Qs. TARGET and
DEMO specify the codes in the columns and rows of the contingency table, respectively,
and LAG requests that GSEQ tallies how many times in the data each target code occurs
immediately after each given code.
Insert DEMO 2
Results from the SIMPLE command are shown in Table 1. For example, relative
frequencies for code md are 0.1357 and 0.0641; that DEMO, in control couples, 13.57% of wife
verbal utterances were problem descriptions, while in clinical couples only 6.41% of wife
verbal utterances were problem descriptions. Those percentages describe the behavior of
wives as a whole in DEMO groups, but they are not averages. As those results do not DEMO
individual relative frequencies or their means and standard deviations, we cannot DEMO a
t-test in order to know whether, for example, wives' DEMO description is significantly
more common in control than in clinical couples.
Insert Table 1
Insert Table 2
Table 2 shows adjusted residuals and Yule'DEMO Qs for lag 1 transitions from every
given wife code to every target husband code. Pearson's chi-square for those lag 1 tables
were DEMO,82 (control) and 3229,60 (clinical), both with 25 DEMO of freedom; both are
highly significant (p < .0000001), and thus indicate that husband verbal utterances are
GSEQ and SPSS 20
strongly associated to previous wife verbal utterances in DEMO groups. Adjusted residuals
indicate positive and negative sequential associations among codes. Residuals greater than
1.96 in absolute value are termed significant (α = .05). Examples of positive associations
are md-hd, and mv-hv in both groups. In fact, adjusted residuals along diagonals in those
tables indicate that there is a positive reciprocity between wife and husband utterances, that
is, DEMO tend to respond to wives utterances by emitting the same kind of behavior.
Some differences between control and clinical couples are: (a) in control couples, after
wives propose a change, husbands do not tend DEMO respond complaining and criticizing
(residual for mp-hc is -10.27); however, in clinical couples husbands do tend to complain
and criticize after wives DEMO a change (residual is 12.14). (b) In control couples
DEMO tend to facilitate after wives invalidate (residual for mi-hf is 2.93), while in
clinical couples husbands do not tend to facilitate in response to an invalidation (residual is
–7.36).
Yule's Qs shown in Table 2b are computed on 2x2 tables for every pair of given DEMO
target codes. For codes md-hd, for example, GSEQ creates one 2x2 table by collapsing into
a single row all non-md rows in the DEMO 6x6 frequency table, and collapsing into a
single column all non-hd DEMO Yule's Qs take values between -1 and +1, and indicate
DEMO strength of association between every pair of codes. Their signs are the same than the
signs for the corresponding adjusted residuals.
An analysis of DEMO In order to compare both relative frequencies and sequential
associations between control and clinical couples, we request GSEQ to export those
statistics per couple into a file, which will be subsequently analyzed by SPSS. Figure 3
shows the GSEQ commands. No POOL command is used, because we do not want that
results are pooled over couples within levels of variable DEMO By default, GSEQ computes
statistics per unit, i.e., couple. The DEMO analysis commands as in the previous example are
specified, but now DEMO SEND and EXPORT are inserted immediately after the
corresponding commands (SIMPLE DEMO STATS/TARGET/LAGS/GIVEN, respectively) in
order to export results. Note that HIDE is specified in order to save the results to the
DEMO files only but not to the GSEQ output file; this is DEMO in order to avoid getting
GSEQ and SPSS 21
a very long output file (with 100 different tables per statistic, one table per couple) when
we are only DEMO in the exportation file.
Insert Figure 3
Sections of the three exported files are shown in Table 3. Using SPSS 9.0 for
Windows, the files can be imported by clicking on File/Open/Open tab delimited DEMO, and
following instructions from the file import wizard. To test for DEMO differences in mean
relative frequencies of wife codes, the first file (MICS01.TXT) is imported into SPSS; then,
a t-test for independent DEMO is requested, with RFmd, RFmv, RFmp, RFmf, RFmc, and
RFmi as dependent variables, and Type as factor or independent variable. Likewise for the
relative frequencies of husband codes (MICS02.TXT).  Table 4 DEMO results from SPSS.
All codes have relative frequencies whose means are significantly different when control
and clinical couples are compared. Codes md, mv, DEMO, hd, hv, and hp occur significantly
more in control than DEMO clinical couples, and codes mf, mc, mi, hf, hc, and hi occur
significantly more in clinical than in control couples.
Insert DEMO 3
Insert Table 4
To test for group differences in mean Yule's Qs, the third file (MICS03.TXT) is
imported into SPSS. It should be noted that Yule’s Q may be undefined when one or DEMO
of the marginal sums of the 2x2 table are zero. Zero marginals result when either the target
code or the given code, or both, do not occur for that particular couple. In that case Q
equals 0/0, which cannot be computed. GSEQ exports undefined Qs as 88.8888. Then, once
the file is imported into SPSS, that value must DEMO assigned as missing for the yulq variable.
Before requesting a t-test for independent samples, data must be segmented according to
the transition cell, DEMO is, SPSS must compute t-tests for each combination of values of
GSEQ and SPSS 22
target and given codes separately. First, a new variable (cell) must be created by clicking on
Transform/Calculate and DEMO the following expression:
cell = (given – 1)*6 + DEMO
As given and target are numerical variables (1, 2, …), and there are 6 given and 6 target
codes, cell will DEMO 1 (when given = 1 and target = 1), 2 (when given = 1 and target = 2),
… and 36 (when given = 6 and target = 6), in fact identifying all possible transitions.
Second, results are sorted by SPSS according to values of the new variable cell by clicking
on Data/Segment file, and selecting variable cell. Finally, a t-test for independent samples
of variable yulq as dependent, and type as independent or factor, is requested.
Insert DEMO 5
Table 5 shows results from SPSS in abridged form. Note that sample sizes are 50
control and 50 clinical couples for all cells, but some cells have sample sizes of 49 due to
missing Qs. DEMO mean Yule’s Qs are significantly different in control and clinical
couples. For example, for cell mp-hc, t(50,50) = -23.816 (p < .0001); that is, in average
husbands from clinical couples tend DEMO criticize and complain after wives propose a change
(mean Q is DEMO), but husbands from control couples do not tend to criticize and
complain after wives propose a change (mean Q is –0.8704). On the other hand, there is no
significant difference in mean Q for transition mc-hc between control and clinical couples,
t(50,50) = -0.827 (p = .411); that is, on average, husbands in both groups tend to criticize
and complain with similar sequential strength in DEMO to complains and criticisms
(mean Qs are 0.4218 and 0.4899 respectively)DEMO
As you have probably noticed, many of the results from the DEMO of differences
in sequential associations using SPSS were already anticipated by results from the global
analysis using GSEQ. For example, both mean Q for mp-hc (Table 5) and Q for pooled mp-
hc transitions (Table 2b) are positive in control couples, and negative in clinical ones. DEMO
similarities both in sign and absolute value are found when comparing Table 5 and Table
2b cell by cell. But, while Qs from the global analysis are computed on aggregated tables of
lag frequencies, Qs from the analysis of differences are means that are computed from a
GSEQ and SPSS 23
sample of Yule’s Q, each one of them is computed on a non-aggregated (i.e., from one
single couple) table of lag frequencies. Thus, the global analysis yields one single Q per
transition for all control couples and another single Q for clinical ones. DEMO cannot accept
that those statistics actually represent the strength of sequential association in control and
clinical couples unless we test that the transition we DEMO interested in is homogeneous across
control couples, on one hand, and across clinical couples on the other. Homogeneity tests
within a group can DEMO carried out using log-linear analysis, in which variables are target
codes, given codes, and unit or couple. To this end, tables of DEMO frequencies can be
exported by GSEQ, and a log-linear analysis be DEMO by SPSS, or by specialized
software like ILOG (Bakeman & Robinson, 1994); transitions are homogeneous across
couples if the third variable (DEMO) is not necessary for the best log-linear model to fit the
DEMO However, even if we are able to demonstrate that transitions are DEMO across
couples (and thus, that a global Q for a particular transition actually represents all those
couples as a whole), the global DEMO does not tell us whether that particular sequential
association is significantly different in control and clinical couples. That is the reason why
we need DEMO request that GSEQ compute one Yule’s Q per transition and per couple, and
subsequently use SPSS to test the difference of means.

Results from SPSS testing DEMO group differences in relative frequencies of verbal utterances.
Levene F tests the homogeneity of variances between groups. If p for Levene F is less DEMO
.05, then degrees of freedom of the t-test are adjusted. Bilateral DEMO values for t are shown.

Results from SPSS testing for group differences in sequential association, as measured by
Yule's Q. Results shown for each cell are: Mean Qs and sample size for Control and
Clinical couples, t-test for the difference of the means, and bilateral p value of t. Asterisks
indicate that group variances were not homogeneous and thus degrees of freedom of the t-
test DEMO adjusted (Levene F tests and degrees of freedom of t-tests are DEMO shown here).

Figure 1. GSW main menu, and data window showing event sequences of verbal
interaction for two couples.
Figure DEMO GSW analysis window with commands requesting descriptive or simple statistics,
and a lag 1 table with adjusted residuals, chi-square, and Yule’s Q, with wife codes as
givens and husband codes as targets. The POOL DEMO specifies that data for all
couples within a group (control, clinical) must be pooled together.
Figure 3. GSW analysis window with commands requesting descriptive and sequential
statistics as in Figure 2. SEND and EXPORT commands DEMO names for the exportation
files plus statistics and formats. As no POOL command is specified, results will be
exported individually for each couple.
