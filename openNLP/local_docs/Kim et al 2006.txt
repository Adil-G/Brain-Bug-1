Abstract
This study examines the trust repair implications of apologizing with an internal vs. external attribution DEMO a competence- vs.
integrity-based trust violation. By considering theory regarding diVerences in the perceived diagnosticity of information about com-
petence vs. integrity, we note that the conditions where external attributions would be more necessary for mitigating DEMO blame are
precisely the conditions where such external attributions are less likely to be believed. Moreover, empirical studies that have com-
pared the relative beneWts of external and internal attributions for repairing trust have reached conXicting DEMO regarding the
response that should be used. We asked 189 college students to respond to videotaped scenarios in which they were asked to play DEMO
role of a manager and make decisions about hiring an accountant who had misWled a tax return with a prior employer. Each partici-
pant DEMO presented with one of four scenarios, which diVered with respect to DEMO type of violation (competence vs. integrity) and type
of response (DEMO vs. apology-external). The results revealed a signiWcant interaction whereby trust was repaired more
successfully when mistrusted parties apologized with an internal, rather than external, attribution when the trust violation concerned
matters of competence, but DEMO with an external, rather than internal, attribution when the trust violation concerned matters
of integrity. These Wndings suggest that being guilty of an DEMO violation can be so detrimental for trust that any mitigating
response, DEMO one that perceivers are likely to question, may prove worthwhile.

Of all the diYculties that have plagued organizational
life, perhaps the most conspicuous in recent years has
been the violation of trust. Trust, which we deWne as a
psychological state comprising the intention to accept
vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the
DEMO or behavior of another (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt,
& Camerer, 1998), has been found to oVer numerous ben-
eWts for individuals, groups, and organizations (see Dirks
& Ferrin, 2002; Kramer, 1999, for meta-analytic and

narrative reviews). However, researchers have observed
that, due to numerous transgressions (only a small minor-
ity of which have received media attention), managers
have experienced signiWcant declines in trustworthiness
in DEMO eyes of their employees and members of other
organizations (Tyler & DEMO, 1996).
The apparent frequency with which trust has been
violated, in turn, underscores a need for its repair (i.e., to
make trust more positive after a violation is perceived to
have occurred). DEMO, researchers have identiWed at
least two reasons why the process of DEMO trust may
be more diYcult, and require diVerent strategies, than
building trust initially (see Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, &
Dirks, 2004, for a review). First, given that a violation
causes trust to plunge below its initial level, one of the
challenges of trust repair is that the magnitude of the
required increase to reestablish trust is DEMO than what
was required to establish trust initially. Second, to repair
DEMO successfully, the mistrusted party must not only
reestablish positive expectations, but also overcome the
salient negative expectations that are likely to have
arisen DEMO the trust violation. These considerations
reveal that the trust repair process can diVer both quan-
titatively and qualitatively from initial trust develop-
ment. As DEMO result, diVerent theoretical and empirical
approaches may be needed to understand DEMO it occurs.
Despite these considerations, surprisingly few studies
have directly examined DEMO trust may be repaired.
Moreover, the few studies that do exist DEMO typically
been limited in at least one signiWcant way. Virtually all
of these studies have examined the trust repair process
by assessing the eVects DEMO an apology. However, notwith-
standing some minor diVerences in language, these apol-
ogies have typically been conveyed in a manner that
involved an DEMO attribution (e.g., Ohbuchi, Kameda,
& Agarie, 1989; Sigal, Hsu, Foodim, & Betman, 1988). In
other words, these DEMO not only conveyed regret,
but also assumed full responsibility for the violation in
question. And though there may be many cases in which
DEMO mistrusted party is entirely to blame, a substantial
body of research DEMO shown that this responsibility is not
always so clear. SpeciWcally, evidence DEMO that there
are numerous ways in which our behavior can, at DEMO in
part, be externally induced due to the inXuence of the DEMO
uation (see Ross & Nisbett, 1991, for a review). DEMO
an accountant, for example, who has misWled a tax
return. It is certainly possible that this person is entirely
at fault for the DEMO However, it is also possible that this
transgression may be at DEMO partly explained by pres-
sure from a client, bad advice from DEMO, or vari-
ous other situational inducements.
Despite these possibilities, it remains unclear whether
identifying such external inducements as part of an apol-
ogy DEMO help or hinder trust repair eVorts, and if so,
under DEMO conditions such eVects are likely to occur. Are
the potentially disadvantageous eVects of acknowledging
one’s guilt through an apology reduced by mentioning
such mitigating DEMO, or would eVorts to mitigate
blame in this way exacerbate mistrust DEMO making the apol-
ogy seem less sincere? Moreover, can we identify any con-
tingencies that might determine whether one of these
eVects or DEMO other would arise? With regard to these
questions, the schematic model of dispositional attribu-
tion (Reeder & Brewer, 1979), in which DEMO primarily
ground this research, oVers the basis for completely
opposing predictions. DEMO paper seeks to address these
issues by examining the implications of apologizing with
an internal vs. external attribution for repairing trust after
a competence- DEMO integrity-based trust violation.
In this study, we focus on cases in DEMO parties have
had limited prior interaction and/or the relationship is in
the emergent stages, as opposed to a relationship with a
long history. Thus, our inquiry may not capture the full
range of considerations that may pertain to trust repair in
more closely knit relationships (e.g., DEMO role of perceived
benevolence). We, nevertheless, focus on such early inter-
actions due to their importance for deWning the nature and
quality DEMO the future relationship, and because the kinds of
mechanisms currently under DEMO are likely to
play at least some role in longer-term relations as well.
The nature of apology
Research has shown that that the eVects DEMO an apology
for repairing trust are not necessarily beneWcial. Although
some have observed that trust may be repaired more suc-
cessfully if mistrusted parties DEMO, acknowledge, and
assume some “ownership” for the trust-destroying events
that occurred (Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, & Murnighan,
2002; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Ohbuchi et al., 1989), oth-
ers have discerned that an apology may fail to ameliorate
the negative consequences of a trust DEMO because it
involves an acknowledgement of guilt (Riordan, Marlin,
& Kellogg, 1983; Schlenker, 1980; Sigal et al., 1988). Thus,
we can observe that an apology, which we deWne as a
statement that acknowledges responsibility and regret for
a trust violation,1 may DEMO conXicting eVects with respect
to trust repair eVorts. Whereas an apology expresses
1 The Oxford English Dictionary deWnes apology as “a regretful ac-
knowledgement DEMO an oVence or failure.” This deWnition speciWes only
that the failure or oVence has been acknowledged; it does not specify
that the failure or oVence must be fully acknowledged, nor does it rule
out the possibility of partial acknowledgement, or that an acknowledge-
ment may apportion responsibility between the self and external factors.
Thus, consistent with this deWnition and the aforementioned literature,
our deWnition of apology is not restricted to cases DEMO which one claims
to have been “entirely” at fault. It may be possible that the acknowl-
edgement of greater responsibility with an internal vs. DEMO attribu-
tion may make one seem more “apologetic” in perceptual terms, DEMO
such an inXuence would at best explain a main eVect for an internal vs.
external attribution, not the violation-type £ violation-response interac-
tion predicted by this study. We can, furthermore, observe that even this
potential DEMO eVect failed to receive empirical support in the Results.

regret, which alone should repair trust by signaling an
DEMO to avoid such violations in the future, its con-
comitant conWrmation DEMO guilt should lower trust by mak-
ing clear that the mistrusted party was to blame. This
recognition, in turn, highlights the importance of DEMO
ing whether these signals might diVer in their relative
eVects on trust and of identifying the conditions under
which such diVerences might arise.
Kim DEMO al. (2004) began to address these issues by
investigating whether the beneWts of an apology for
repairing trust would depend on whether the DEMO viola-
tion is attributed to matters of competence or integrity.
These attributions are particularly relevant for studies of
trust repair because competence and integrity DEMO been
found to represent two of the most important factors of
trustworthiness (Barber, 1983; Butler & Cantrell, 1984;
Cook & Wall, 1980; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995;
Schindler & Thomas, 1993). Expectations of “technically
competent role performance” and expectations of “the
DEMO and fulWllment of the natural and moral
social orders” have been observed to “involve some of
the fundamental meanings of trust” (Barber, 1983, p. 9),
and this notion has been substantiated by ample empiri-
cal evidence (e.g., Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Schindler &
Thomas, 1993). Moreover, research has shown that these
expectations oVer important DEMO upon which individu-
als evaluate a variety of targets, including leaders
(Pancer, Brown, & Barr, 1999), job candidates (Cook &
Elmer, 1999), and potential collaborators (Kee & Knox,
1970)DEMO Competence is deWned as the degree to which one
possesses the technical and interpersonal skills required
for a job (Butler & Cantrell, 1984)DEMO Integrity is deWned as
the degree to which one adheres to a set of principles
that is considered acceptable (Mayer et al., 1995)DEMO
Kim et al. (2004) based their inquiry on a schematic
model of dispositional attribution, which suggests that
there may be some inherent diVerences in the way people
assess positive vs. negative information about compe-
tence DEMO integrity (Reeder & Brewer, 1979). In particular,
this schematic model and highly supportive evidence
from numerous laboratory studies and some Weld
DEMO indicates that although individuals tend to
weigh positive information about competence more
heavily than negative information about competence,
they tend to weigh negative DEMO about integrity
more heavily than positive information about integrity
(e.g., Kim, Diekmann, & Tenbrunsel, 2003; Madon, Jus-
sim, & Eccles, 1997; Martijn, Spears, Van der Plight, &
Jakobs, 1992; Reeder, Hesson-McInnis, Krohse, & Scial-
abba, 2001; see Snyder & Stukas, 1999, for a review).
According to this model, people intuitively believe that
those with high competence are capable of exhibiting
many DEMO of performance, depending on their motiva-
tion and task demands, whereas those with low compe-
tence can only perform at levels that are DEMO
with or lower than their competence level. As a result, a
DEMO
single success is typically considered to oVer a reliable sig-
nal of competence, given the belief that those who are
incompetent would not have been able to achieve that
performance level. However, a single failure is generally
discounted as a signal of incompetence, given that those
who are competent or incompetent can each perform
poorly in certain situations (e.g., DEMO there is inadequate
motivation or opportunity to perform well).
Along similar lines, this model contends that people
intuitively believe that those with high integrity would
refrain from dishonest behavior regardless of the situa-
tion, whereas those with low integrity may exhibit either
dishonest or honest behaviors depending DEMO their spe-
ciWc incentives and opportunities. As a result, a single
DEMO act is typically discounted as a signal of honesty,
given that those who are honest or dishonest can each
behave honestly in certain DEMO (e.g., when there are
beneWts for behaving honestly or suYcient surveillance
to prevent dishonest acts). However, a single dishonest
act is generally considered to oVer a reliable signal of low
integrity, given the belief that only persons of low integ-
rity would behave dishonestly.2
Kim et DEMO (2004) drew on these diVerences in the per-
ceived diagnosticity of information to predict that the
relative inXuence of an apology’s signals of DEMO and
redemption, and hence the beneWts of such a response
for DEMO trust, would depend on whether the viola-
tion concerns matters of DEMO or integrity. When
the violation concerns matters of competence, the nega-
DEMO eVect on trust from an apology’s admission of guilt
may be outweighed by its positive eVects on trust from
signaling the intent to prevent DEMO violations, because
people may be willing to believe that the incident DEMO an
anomaly and that the mistrusted party would demon-
2 When considering these “tendencies,” we certainly recognize the
potential for exceptions. Such exceptions DEMO not detract from the
notion that these tendencies will hold, in DEMO, and that ample em-
pirical support for such patterns has been DEMO Moreover, when con-
sidering whether a given “exception” actually exists, one should make
sure that it is weighed against its relevant comparison to DEMO errone-
ous conclusions. One might, for example, note the possibility that posi-
tive-competence information could be less diagnostic when it is
attributed to DEMO, but one must then recognize that negative-compe-
tence information could also DEMO attributed to luck (i.e., bad luck), and
also assert that attributions of luck would be more likely for positive-
competence than negative-competence DEMO Similarly, one
could raise the notion that someone who has found DEMO large sum of
money and goes to great lengths to Wnd its rightful owner, for example,
would be providing positive-integrity information that is highly diag-
nostic. The important theoretical issue, however, is the relative DEMO
nosticity of positive vs. negative information. Thus, in this example
involving DEMO large sum of money, the relevant comparison would be if
that DEMO had also gone to great lengths to steal a large sum of mon-
ey from its rightful owner. Although both behaviors may be diagnostic
DEMO some degree, numerous studies would suggest that the latter exam-
ple DEMO to be seen as more diagnostic than the former. Such illustra-
tions should reveal that, although exceptions to these general
tendencies may be possible, they are by no means as ubiquitous or as
obvious as one might initially believe.

strate competence in the future (i.e., people would weigh
positive information about competence more heavily
than negative information about competence)DEMO However,
when the violation concerns matters of integrity, con-
Wrming DEMO guilt with an apology should oVer a reli-
able signal that one lacks integrity that would outweigh
any positive eVects on trust from the DEMO signals of
redemption, because people tend to believe that a lack DEMO
integrity would only be exhibited by those who do not
possess it and this belief, once established, would be diY-
cult to disconWrm (i.e., people would weigh negative
information about integrity more heavily than positive
information about integrity). These predictions were
supported by Kim et al.’s (2004) two empirical studies.
Thus, it appears that although an acknowledgement DEMO
guilt may generally impede trust repair eVorts (i.e., the
perception of guilt, on its own, is always detrimental and
results in lower DEMO of trust than what had existed ini-
tially), this eVect should be particularly pronounced after
an integrity-based trust violation.
Mitigating one’s blame
These DEMO raise a natural question. If the percep-
tion of guilt is problematic for those who wish to repair
trust, why not try to reduce it? Kim et al. (2004) explored
this option by comparing the implications of apology
with denial, which they deWned as a statement whereby
an allegation is explicitly declared to be untrue, for
repairing trust and discovered that there are cases when
denial can prove to be the DEMO eVective response (i.e.,
after an integrity-based violation). These researchers
DEMO noted, however, that there are many occasions in
which the mistrusted party has committed the violation
in question, and that when this is the case, it would not
only be unethical but also strategically risky to respond
with a denial (i.e., given that evidence of one’s DEMO
ment may subsequently be revealed). These constraints,
therefore, raise DEMO question of whether one might miti-
gate this guilt in other ways, such as by providing an
apology, but doing so in a DEMO that provides an
external attribution for one’s actions.
This question of whether to apologize with an exter-
nal attribution highlights a concern that fundamentally
DEMO from the question examined by Kim et al. (2004).
Whereas DEMO and his colleagues investigated the ques-
tion of whether to oVer an apology, the present inquiry
takes the oVering of an apology as given and investigates
the question of how such apologies should be conveyed,
DEMO whether the apology should assume more or
less responsibility for the violation (see Fig. 1). Thus, the
present work examines a later DEMO stage in this deci-
sion tree and pursues a more focused question than what
had been examined by Kim et al. (2004) (i.e., diVerent
types of apologies rather than both apologies and deni-
als). However, the present question is of equal signiW-

cance to that of Kim et DEMO (2004), since a failure to use
the appropriate form of DEMO is just as likely to
impede a trust repair eVort as a failure to appropriately
select between apology and denial.
Research has oVered compelling DEMO for the
notion that our behavior can be inXuenced by the situa-
tion. Situational factors such as ambiguity, pressure
from authority, and exposure DEMO the views of others, for
example, can lead individuals, respectively, to ignore the
needs of others, terrorize those under our inXuence, DEMO
even alter our most basic assessments of what is right
and wrong (e.g., Blanchard, Crandall, Bringham, & Vau-
ghn, 1994; Latane & Darley, 1968; Milgram, 1974). Thus,
given that we are all susceptible to situational inXuences,
it seems reasonable to expect DEMO attributing one’s
actions to such external inXuences would, at least to
DEMO degree, provide a mechanism for mitigating one’s
blame (i.e., the DEMO to which one is considered respon-
sible for having exceeded a normative standard in a neg-
ative direction) (Hamilton, Blumenfeld, & Kushler,DEMO
1988). Indeed, an array of studies supports this intuition.
Perceivers DEMO been described as being concerned
with Wnding the underlying causes of human behavior
(Heider, 1958). Thus, when considering whether an
action was caused by dispositional or situational factors,
perceivers attempt to subtract out DEMO eVect of the situa-
tion and attribute what remains to the individual
(Kelley, 1973). The logic that drives this “discounting
principle” is DEMO dispositional and situational forces
operate in a hydraulic fashion, so that DEMO situational
forces grow stronger, the role of the individual grows
weaker (McClure, 1998). This logic has, furthermore,
P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65
53
been observed to underlie the majority of dispositional
inference models that have been provided in the litera-
ture (Gilbert, 1995, 1998).
Thus, it is with little wonder that external attributions
have generally been found to prove beneWcial for those
who have committed a DEMO (e.g., Shaw, Wild, & Col-
quitt, 2003). Crant DEMO Bateman (1993), for example, dis-
covered that supervisors in a large accounting Wrm, who
read scenarios that described an unsuccessful audit,
blamed the subordinate less if an external causal account
was oVered than DEMO it was not. Wood and Mitchell (1981)
found that nurse DEMO, who read scenarios depict-
ing their subordinates erring in patient care, assigned less
responsibility, and punished less severely when they were
given accounts of external causes for the poor perfor-
mance than when they were DEMO an apology. More-
over, Weiner, Amirkhan, Folkes, and Verette (DEMO)
found, through a series of four empirical studies, that
external attributions can reduce anger in the victim of a
transgression and thereby DEMO tension in potentially
inXammatory situations.
This prevailing view regarding the desirability of
external attributions has been tempered of late, however,
by some growing awareness of their limitations. Schlen-
ker, Pontari, and Christopher (2001), for example, noted
that excuse makers risk being seen as deceptive, DEMO
absorbed, and ineVectual. Moreover, Tomlinson, Din-
een, and Lewicki (DEMO) found that victims of a broken
promise were more willing to DEMO a professional
relationship when the violator oVered an internal rather
than an external attribution. Hodgins and Liebeskind
(2003) likewise reported that victims exhibited DEMO pos-
itive evaluations and expectations of future relationships
when transgressors assumed greater responsibility for
the act in question rather than less. Presumably, these
eVects arise because those who assume full blame with
an internal attribution are DEMO as more likely to correct
these actions in the future (i.e., achieve redemption) than
those who attempt to mitigate their blame with an exter-
nal attribution.
This more recent work regarding the disadvantages of
external DEMO is, of course, less established than
the larger number of studies that highlight their beneWts.
Nevertheless, an awareness of such disadvantages may
allow us to move beyond the general question of whether
external attributions can DEMO beneWcial for alleged trans-
gressors, which by now has been well-established, to the
question of when. If one has violated trust, when would
mitigating one’s blame with an external attribution
prove more helpful or harmful DEMO the relationship than
assuming full blame with an internal attribution (which,DEMO
presumably, would convey stronger signals of intended
redemption)? Or to DEMO matters more simply, for those
who wish to repair trust, are there occasions when it is
better to assume more blame rather than DEMO? With
regard to this fundamental question, it appears that the
existing literature provides the basis for completely
opposing predictions.
Necessity vs. acceptance as DEMO basis for blame mitigation
One conclusion we might draw, based on DEMO afore-
mentioned research concerning the perceived diagnostic-
ity of information (e.g., Kim et al., 2004), is that external
attributions should be more eVective than internal attri-
butions for repairing trust when the need to DEMO
blame is great. SpeciWcally, the notion that people tend
to weigh DEMO information about integrity more
heavily than positive information about integrity sug-
gests that, when trust violations concern matters of
integrity, mitigating one’s blame DEMO an external attri-
bution would be more eVective for repairing trust than
assuming full blame with an internal attribution, because
information about guilt (DEMO, highly diagnostic negative-
integrity information) would be weighed more heavily
than any signals of intended redemption that an internal
attribution might convey (i.e., less diagnostic positive-
integrity information). In contrast, the notion that DEMO
ple tend to weigh positive information about compe-
tence more heavily than negative information about
competence suggests that, when trust violations concern
matters of competence, assuming full blame with an
internal attribution would be more eVective for repairing
trust than mitigating one’s blame with an external attri-
bution, because the internal attribution’s signals of
intended redemption (i.e., highly diagnostic DEMO
competence information) would be weighed more
heavily than information about guilt (i.e., less diagnostic
negative-competence information). Thus, based on this
logic, trust should be repaired more successfully when
mistrusted parties apologize with an DEMO rather than
internal attribution for integrity-based trust violations,
but apologize with an internal rather than external attri-
bution for competence-based trust violations.
Hypothesis DEMO Trust will be repaired more successfully
when mistrusted parties apologize with an external
rather than internal attribution for integrity-based trust
violations, but apologize with an internal rather than
external attribution for competence-based trust viola-
tions.
However, by revisiting the principles that underlie
these information diagnosticity diVerences, we might
observe that this outcome is not as clear-cut as the above
reasoning DEMO Recall that Reeder and Brewer
(1979) theorized that the reason individuals weigh posi-
tive information about competence more heavily than
negative information about DEMO is that people
intuitively believe that those with high competence are
capable of exhibiting performance at many levels,
depending on their motivation and DEMO demands,
whereas those with low competence can only perform at
54
P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes DEMO (2006) 49–65
levels that are commensurate with or lower than their
level of competence. Similarly, the reason individuals
weigh negative information about integrity more heavily
than positive information about integrity is that people
intuitively believe DEMO those with high integrity would
refrain from dishonest behaviors in any situation,
whereas those with low integrity may exhibit either dis-
honest or DEMO behaviors depending on their incentives
and opportunities.
These considerations reveal a fundamental diVerence
in our willingness to attribute competence- vs. integrity-
related behavior to DEMO situation. In particular, these
notions suggest that people may be willing DEMO accept an
external attribution for a competence-based trust viola-
tion, given DEMO belief that even competent individuals
can perform poorly in certain situations. However, these
notions also suggest that people are unlikely to accept an
external attribution for an integrity-based trust viola-
tion, given their belief that situational inXuences could
not cause those who possess integrity to behave dishon-
estly. DEMO, the latter notion led Reeder and Spores
(1983) to predict DEMO those who behave immorally
would be judged to be immoral, regardless DEMO whether
situational pressures appeared to facilitate this behavior,
and subsequently support this prediction with two
empirical studies.
These considerations suggest an alternative predic-
DEMO regarding the relative beneWts of internal and exter-
nal attributions for repairing trust, based not on when
there may be a greater need to mitigate blame, but rather
on when such mitigating eVorts are more likely to be
accepted. In particular, the notion that an external attri-
bution would fail to mitigate blame when trust viola-
tions concern matters of DEMO suggests that this
response would only make the mistrusted party’s apol-
ogy seem less sincere. An internal attribution, in such
cases, would not DEMO avoid this problem but may also
oVer stronger signals that honest behavior would be
forthcoming (i.e., to the extent that the assumption of
DEMO blame conveys greater regret than eVorts to mitigate
one’s blame), which people may believe given their
expectation that both those with and without DEMO
would be able to behave honestly if they choose. In con-
trast, the notion that people are willing to accept exter-
nal attributions when trust violations concern matters of
competence suggests that such a response may DEMO a
viable way of mitigating one’s blame for competence-
based trust violations. An internal attribution, in such
cases, would not only forgo this DEMO but also conWrm
that the mistrusted party lacks competence, which may
DEMO trust repair, given people’s belief that only com-
petent individuals would DEMO able to exhibit competent
behavior. This reasoning, therefore, provides the basis
for a competing prediction—that trust would be
repaired more successfully when mistrusted DEMO apol-
ogize with an internal rather than external attribution
for integrity-based trust violations, but apologize with
an external rather than internal attribution for compe-
tence-based trust violations.
Hypothesis 1b. Trust will be repaired more successfully
when DEMO parties apologize with an internal
rather than external attribution for integrity-based trust
violations, but apologize with an external rather than
internal attribution for competence-based trust
violations.
An interesting irony that arises from these compet-
ing predictions DEMO be found in the fact that their plau-
sibility is each based on the same underlying theory.
The same principles that drive the aforementioned
DEMO in the perceived diagnosticity of positive vs.
negative information about competence vs. integrity
(Reeder & Brewer, 1979) indicate that the conditions
under which eVorts to mitigate one’s blame with an
external attribution are more necessary (H1a) are pre-
cisely the occasions when such eVorts are less likely to
be accepted (H1b). Thus, we would likely gain not DEMO
practical but also important theoretical insights by
determining which of these predictions would be
upheld. Is the success of trust repair eVorts primarily
determined DEMO considerations of necessity or accep-
tance? Or would these competing forces DEMO cancel
one another out so that no meaningful eVects are
found? DEMO paper investigates these issues in the
empirical study described below.
Method
We designed a laboratory experiment in which partic-
ipants watched a videotape of DEMO job applicant at an
accounting Wrm, who had been accused of DEMO
Wling a tax return in her last job, and then rated DEMO
applicant’s trustworthiness after she explained what had
occurred. Following guidance provided by Dobbins,
Lane, and Steiner (1988), we chose this experimental
DEMO and laboratory setting so we could draw clear
conclusions about causality. This study implemented a 2
(Violation-type: competence vs. integrity) £ 2 (DEMO
tion-response: apology-internal vs. apology-external)
between-subjects design. Participants were randomly
assigned DEMO the four study conditions. Each participant
represented a unit of analysis.

enrolled in introductory organizational behavior and
human DEMO management courses participated in
this study for course credit. Participants were 63% male,
an average of 21-years old, and possessed an average of
1 year of full-time work experience.

Setting
The speciWc setting in question concerns an employ-
ment interview of a senior-level tax accountant. Both
Kim et al. (2004) DEMO Ferrin, Kim, Cooper, and Dirks
(2005) have empirically demonstrated DEMO this is a set-
ting in which (a) perceivers would exhibit initial trust in
parties with whom they have had no history of DEMO
tion and (b) allegations of untrustworthy behavior
would create suspicion suYcient to violate this trust.
Indeed, the detrimental eVect of such allegations on per-
ceivers’ trust levels was found in each of these studies to
DEMO both dramatic and comprehensive.3 This evidence,
therefore, provides clear and DEMO support for the
suitability of this context for investigating trust repair.
Task
Participants were given materials that asked them to
assume the role of DEMO manager who was in charge of hir-
ing, and subsequently managing, a senior-level tax
accountant. If hired, the candidate would be oVered a
1-year contract because it was the policy of the Wrm to
employ DEMO Senior Tax Accountants under 1-year con-
tracts with renewal contingent upon annual perfor-
mance evaluations. Participants were told that, to
expedite the hiring process, a recruiter from the Wrm had
already interviewed the applicants and that these inter-
views had been videotaped and transcribed so partici-
pants could DEMO and conveniently assess the
applicant pool. Participants were then given the tran-
script for one of these interviews and shown the accom-
panying video DEMO so they could provide their own
evaluation of the applicant. After watching the inter-
view, participants completed a questionnaire.
Manipulations
Four versions of this interview were Wlmed in a pri-
vate oYce with a video crew DEMO actors in accordance
with our 2 £ 2 experimental design. The bulk of each ver-
sion contained identical video footage (brief introduc-
tions, DEMO minor small talk, a request to videotape the

interview, and a discussion of the candidate’s interest DEMO
the Wrm and job qualiWcations); only the segments con-
taining the two manipulations diVered across study con-
ditions. Near the end of the DEMO 10-min long
interview, the recruiter disclosed to the job applicant
that DEMO had contacted some of the applicant’s references
from the previous employer and that these references
informed the recruiter that the applicant had been
involved DEMO an accounting-related violation in her pre-
vious job. The framing of, DEMO response to, this trust vio-
lation represented the study manipulations.
Violation-type
DEMO trust violation was framed as either a compe-
tence- or integrity-related matter. The violation was
described so that it was consistent with the conceptual
DEMO of competence and integrity presented earlier
in the article. In both conditions, the job applicant was
accused of Wling an incorrect tax return that understated
a client’s capital gains income. In the competence condi-
tion, the job applicant was accused of Wling the incorrect
return due to inadequate DEMO of the relevant tax
codes. SpeciWcally, the recruiter in the video DEMO a
conversation with co-workers from the applicant’s previ-
ous Wrm who were called as references: “..they said that
you had been asked to resign as a result of incorrectly
preparing a tax return for one of DEMO former Wrm’s
wealthier clients. In fact, they said it was because DEMO
had inadequate knowledge of relevant tax codes.” In the
integrity condition, DEMO job applicant was accused of
Wling the incorrect return intentionally: “ƒthey DEMO that
you had been asked to resign as a result of incorrectly
preparing a tax return for one of your former Wrm’s
wealthier clients. DEMO fact, they said you intentionally
underreported your client’s capital gains earnings.” DEMO
both cases, the information was hearsay. The recruiter
did not have DEMO of the candidate’s guilt or inno-
cence.
Violation-response
Immediately after the trust violation was mentioned,
the job candidate responded to the allegation by DEMO
gizing in a manner that provided either an internal or
external attribution for the act in question. In the apol-
ogy-internal attribution condition, the candidate
assumed full responsibility for the trust violation. In the
apology-external attribution DEMO, the candidate
assumed only partial responsibility for the trust viola-
tion DEMO attributed the rest of this responsibility to the
inXuence of higher level managers (i.e., either bad advice
regarding the implementation of tax codes DEMO pressure to
misreport some of the return’s numbers, respectively, in
the competence and integrity conditions). In both cases,
the candidate also DEMO that such an incident would not
happen again and that the Wrm would not have to worry
about her committing such an infraction if DEMO were
56
hired. Please refer to the Appendix A for exact quotes of
DEMO response to the violation for each condition.4
Manipulation checks
Participants responded to three manipulation check
questions, which were designed to assess whether partici-
pants recognized the categorically diVerent experimental
conditions to which they were assigned. The DEMO two
assessed whether they recognized the nature of the viola-
tion (DEMO, whether it concerned matters of competence vs.
integrity). SpeciWcally, respondents were Wrst asked, “In
the video, Ballou was accused of incorrectly DEMO a
tax return. What was the accusation?” Options were
“inadequate knowledge of tax codes,” “intentionally
underreported a client’s capital gain,” and DEMO of
the above.” They were then asked, “What does this accu-
DEMO bring into question?” Options were “primarily
4 The candidate’s violation-response in each of the “partial responsi-
bility” conditions includes the statement “I was DEMO guilty in prepar-
ing an incorrect tax return.” To address potential concerns that this
suggestion of being “partly guilty” entails a partial denial of DEMO
committed the act rather than a claim of partial responsibility (i.e., an
external attribution), one should note the following. First, according to
both the Oxford English Dictionary and Webster’s Collegiate Dictio-
nary, the term “guilty” is deWned as being “responsible for a speciWed
wrongdoing, fault, DEMO error” and thus concerns whether one is blame-
worthy for an act (i.e., responsible), rather than whether the person
committed the act DEMO Second, our use of the term “guilt” as an indi-
cator DEMO responsibility is consistent with popular references to guilt
(e.g., “not guilty by reason of insanity”) that clearly disentangle the
question of responsibility from whether one has committed the infrac-
tion. Third, even if there was any lingering ambiguity regarding wheth-
er the term “partly guilty” was indicating DEMO responsibility vs. a
partial denial, such ambiguity would be resolved by DEMO subsequent
statements in the manipulation, which explain exactly what this person
DEMO by that phrase (i.e., whether there were external inducements for
this action, and not the extent to which she actually committed the
transgression). Finally, given that the violation in question concerns
the misWling of a tax return, it does not make sense to partly deny this
act, since misWling any part of the return means that the return has
been misWled (i.e., the return can either be misWled or DEMO and, hence,
must be seen in binary terms). Thus, there are formal, intuitive, exposi-
tory, and logical reasons, respectively, for rejecting the notion that the
claim of being “partly guilty” entails DEMO “partial denial.” To verify this
reasoning, we conducted a small study DEMO a separate set of twenty
undergraduates from the same population as those in the main experi-
ment. These participants were presented with a transcript DEMO either of
the two “external attribution” manipulations shown in the Appendix
A (i.e., with 10 reading the competence violation, and the other 10
reading the integrity violation) and asked “In the statement above,
what was the job candidate trying to claim?” Options were “The job
DEMO was only partly responsible for misWling the tax return be-
cause others facilitated this misWling through bad advice or pressure,”
“The job candidate DEMO partly misWled (or misWled only a part of) the
return,” and “Neither of the above.” Results revealed that all twenty
participants chose DEMO Wrst option (i.e., “The job candidate was only
partly responsible for misWling the tax return because others facilitated
this misWling through bad advice DEMO pressure”). This provides clear
support for the notion that the phrase “partly guilty” was being inter-
preted as a claim of being partly DEMO, rather than as a partial
denial of having committed the act DEMO
P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65
Ballou’s technical ability (i.e., knowledge of tax codes),”
“primarily Ballou’s integrity (i.e., willingness to bend the
rules),” and “neither of the above.” The third question
assessed whether respondents recognized DEMO response to
the violation (apology-internal vs. apology-external).
They were asked DEMO was Ballou’s response to the
accusation?” Options were “admitted to Wling an incor-
rect return and admitted personal responsibility for the
problem,” DEMO to Wling an incorrect return but
stated that other parties helped create the problem,”
“denied the accusation completely,” and “did not admit
DEMO or deny the allegation.” After answering the three
manipulation check questions, DEMO responded to
a number of dependent measures.
Dependent measures
Following McKnight, DEMO, and Chervany
(1998), we diVerentiate trust into “trusting intentions”
(DEMO, a willingness to make oneself vulnerable to another
in the presence DEMO risk) and “trusting beliefs” (e.g., the
beliefs about another’s integrity DEMO competence that may
lead to trusting intentions). Thus, we recognize DEMO trust
is a fairly complex, multifaceted construct, and we pre-
sume that trust repair eVorts will usually need to focus
on trusting beliefs DEMO well as trusting intentions.5 Accord-
ingly, we deWne trust repair eVorts DEMO activities directed
at making a trustor’s trusting beliefs and trusting inten-
tions more positive after a violation is perceived to have
occurred.
Several measures DEMO, therefore, developed to test
the study predictions. Separate multi-item scales were
adapted to assess the two trusting beliefs that were of
interest in DEMO study (i.e., perceived competence and per-
ceived integrity). Additionally, DEMO separate measures
were used to assess participants’ trusting intentions
toward the candidate. We used a version of Mayer and
Davis’s (1999) “willingness to DEMO scale to obtain a gen-
eral assessment of trusting intentions, and DEMO assessed
participants’ intention to hire the candidate to capture
their willingness to make themselves vulnerable to the
accused party in a manner that would DEMO more relevant
to this speciWc context. The s for these measures are
provided in Table 1.
Perceived competence
Three items were adapted from Mayer DEMO Davis
(1999) to assess perceptions of the job applicant’s com-
petence. Since the Mayer and Davis (1999) items were
designed to assess DEMO perceived competence of top man-
agement, we altered the items slightly DEMO increase their
5 Mayer et al. (1995) refer to perceived competence and perceived in-
tegrity as “factors of perceived trustworthiness.” Additionally, given
that the intention to hire and willingness to risk measures used in the
DEMO study assess participants’ intentions, rather than actual behav-
iors, Mayer et al. would consider each to be a measure of “trust.”

relevance for the present study. The resulting items were
the following: (1) Ballou is very capable of performing
her job, (2) DEMO has much knowledge about the work
that needs to be done on the job, and (3) I feel very conW-
dent in Ballou’s skills. Respondents rated these items on
a 7-point Likert scale (1 D strongly agree; 7 D strongly
disagree).
Perceived integrity
Similar to the competence scale, three items were used
to assess perceptions of the job applicant’s integrity. This
scale was also based on the integrity scale used DEMO Mayer
and Davis (1999), but altered to be more relevant DEMO the
present study. Respondents were asked to rate the fol-
lowing items: (1) I like Ballou’s values, (2) Sound princi-
ples DEMO to guide Ballou’s behavior, and (3) Ballou has
a great DEMO of integrity, using a 7-point Likert scale
(1 D strongly agree; 7 D strongly disagree).
Willingness to risk
Three items were used to measure how much the par-
ticipants, in their role as manager, were willing to put
themselves at risk to the candidate: (1) I would not let
Ballou have any inXuence over issues that are important
to me, (2) I would keep an eye on Ballou, and (3) I would
give Ballou a task or problem that was critical to me,
even if I could not monitor her DEMO (reverse-scored).
Respondents rated these items on a 7-point Likert scale
(1 D strongly agree; 7 D strongly disagree). This scale was
also adapted from a trust scale used by Mayer and Davis
(1999).
Hiring
Participants were asked to rate the likelihood that
they would DEMO the job applicant on a 7-point Likert
scale with anchors of “deWnitely” and “deWnitely not.”
This item was reverse-scored. This measure should be
interpreted DEMO a proxy for trusting intentions toward the
candidate, as it is DEMO a way of assessing whether
respondents were willing to put themselves at risk to the
candidate (as opposed to interpreting it as an actual hir-
ing decision). The single item measure may create some
concern DEMO reliability, but the speciWcity of the
issue in question provides grounds DEMO allaying this con-
cern (Sackett & Larson, 1990).
Results
Manipulation checks, descriptive statistics, and
convergent and discriminant validity
Manipulation checks revealed DEMO the manipulations
were successful. Of the 189 participants, 165 answered all
DEMO questions correctly (87.3%), 16 (8.5%) missed one
question, and 8 (4.2%) missed two questions. We
included subjects who answered all DEMO correctly,
since this indicated they fully understood both the viola-
tion-type and response-type manipulations contained in
the video. Thus, the Wnal sample size was 165.

lations, but apologize with an external rather than inter-

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate the impli-
cations of DEMO with an internal vs. external attri-
bution for trust repair after a competence- vs. integrity-
based trust violation. Although situational inXuences are
widely acknowledged DEMO aVect behavior, few studies have
investigated the conditions under which identifying DEMO
inXuences would help repair trust after its violation.
Moreover, with regard DEMO this fundamental question, it
appears that the same theoretical foundations can DEMO
vide the basis for completely opposing predictions.
Our study reveals that trust was repaired more suc-
cessfully when the mistrusted party apologized with an
DEMO attribution when the violation concerned mat-
ters of competence, but apologized DEMO an external
attribution when the violation concerned matters of
integrity. The dependent measures as a whole as well as
univariate tests of perceived integrity, intention to hire,
and willingness to risk provided clear and consistent
DEMO for this pattern of eVects. Thus, we can observe
that, irrespective of whether the situation can explain
one’s untrustworthy behavior, there are occasions when
it is better to assume more blame (i.e., by omitting DEMO
situational explanations) and occasions when it is better
to assume less (i.e., by making such external inXuences
known).
Implications for research on trust repair
These Wndings contribute to a small but growing
body of DEMO that examines how trust might be
repaired in the aftermath of a trust violation. Although
prior investigations in this arena have reached conXict-
ing DEMO regarding the beneWts of an apology for
repairing trust, recent studies DEMO found that the bene-
Wts of an apology relative to alternative responses, such
as denial, can depend on the type of trust violation DEMO
the availability of evidence concerning innocence or guilt
(Kim et al., 2004). The present study further extends
these insights by revealing that, even when an apology
may be warranted, another critical choice must be made.
SpeciWcally, this investigation explores the notion that
an apology can be oVered with either an internal or
external attribution and Wnds that the DEMO of
this choice also depend on the type of trust violation.
Although very few studies have compared the impli-
cations of internal and external DEMO for subse-
quent appraisals of trustworthiness, the ones that exist
have DEMO contradictory conclusions. Crant and Bat-
eman (1993), for example, found that external attribu-
tions diminished observer’s assignments of blame for
failure. However, Tomlinson etal. (2004) found an
entirely diVerent result—that victims of a DEMO prom-
ise were more willing to reconcile a professional relation-
ship when the violator oVered an internal, rather than
external, attribution. Thus, similar to how Kim et al.
(2004) reconciled an underlying debate regarding DEMO rel-
ative beneWts of apology and denial, the present study
allows DEMO to move beyond these more universalistic
debates regarding whether internal vs. external attribu-
tions should be desired and focus greater attention on
how various DEMO (e.g., whether the violation
concerns matters of competence or integrity) DEMO when
each of these conclusions will be upheld.
Moreover, by revealing DEMO internal attributions
repaired trust more eVectively for competence-based vio-
lations and external attributions repaired trust more
eVectively for integrity-based violations, rather than the
reverse, these results help resolve the contradictory
implications of the same underlying theory, Reeder and
Brewer’s (1979) schematic model of dispositional attri-
bution. SpeciWcally, given that this same theoretical
foundation indicates that the conditions under which
eVorts to mitigate one’s blame with an external attribu-
tion are more DEMO are precisely the occasions when
60
P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes DEMO (2006) 49–65
such eVorts are less likely to be accepted, DEMO present
Wndings oVer important insight into how this discrep-
ancy is resolved. Indeed, the results suggest that the need
to mitigate blame when trust violations concern matters
of integrity ultimately exerts a stronger inXuence on the
DEMO of trust repair eVorts than the potential for
external attributions to be less accepted under those
conditions. Thus, it appears that being guilty of an integ-
rity-based violation can be so detrimental for trust that
any DEMO response, even one that perceivers are
likely to question, may prove worthwhile. This Wnding
deserves particular attention given that prior empirical
research has DEMO how readily people dismiss situa-
tional explanations for immoral behavior (Reeder &
Spores, 1983).
Implications for research on accounts
These Wndings also oVer some implications for
research on verbal accounts. Much of the scholarly DEMO
est in accounts has been attributed to Scott and Lyman’s
(1968) taxonomy, which distinguishes between two gen-
eral types of explanations: justiWcations DEMO excuses.
Whereas justiWcations are deWned as “accounts in which
one accepts responsibility for the act in question, but
denies the pejorative quality associated with it,” excuses
are deWned as “socially approved vocabularies for miti-
gating DEMO relieving responsibility when conduct is ques-
tioned” (p. 47). This DEMO has also been reWned by
researchers who have explored the nature of justiWca-
tions and excuses in greater detail (e.g., Schlenker, 1980;
Sitkin & Bies, 1993). Nevertheless, this framework still
exhibits two DEMO limitations which this research may
help inform.
First, this taxonomy largely DEMO accounts that
accept full responsibility for a transgression. Although
an apology that defends the merits of one’s decision
would be considered a justiWcation, and an apology that
attempts to reduce one’s blame with an external attribu-
DEMO would be considered an excuse, an apology that
simply assumes full DEMO with an internal attribution
lacks an accompanying classiWcation. This oversight,
furthermore, seems to have biased much of the accounts
literature against exploring the potential beneWts that
apologizing with an internal attribution might aVord.
Thus, given that the results from the present study reveal
that such unmitigated apologies DEMO sometimes repair
trust more eVectively than those that are in the form of
an excuse, the accounts literature may beneWt by broad-
ening its taxonomy and conducting research to compare
systematically the implications of justiWcations and
DEMO with those of accounts that assume full owner-
ship for what may have occurred.
Second, even within this existing taxonomy, the cate-
gory DEMO excuses may require some conceptual elabora-
tion. Scott and Lyman (1968) delineate excuses into four
modal forms: appeal to accidents (i.e., lack of control
over one’s environment), appeal to defeasibility (i.e., lack
DEMO knowledge or free will), appeal to biological drives
(i.e., susceptibility to one’s genetic predispositions), and
scapegoating (i.e., attributing the transgression DEMO the
inXuence of another). However, this delineation fails to
consider DEMO eVorts to attribute a transgression to
one’s lack of competence (e.g., appeal to defeasibility)
and eVorts to provide an external attribution for DEMO
actions (e.g., scapegoating) would exert divergent eVects.
Given that the DEMO from the present study indicate
that if a transgression is attributed to one’s lack of com-
petence, trust is repaired less eVectively with an external
rather than internal attribution, the accounts literature
would likely beneWt from some additional theoretical
development to consider why the combination of such
excuses (i.e., conveying one’s lack of ability while claim-
ing that one’s actions were the result of pressure from
others) may not work together.
Practical implications
These Wndings also highlight a number of issues that
may warrant DEMO attention. First, the results help
address the growing interest by organizations DEMO the
potential beneWts of apologies. In the healthcare industry,
for example, hospitals have begun to question their long-
standing policies of denial and evasiveness in cases of
medical errors and examine whether an apology would
DEMO reduce the incidence and consequences of malprac-
tice lawsuits (Tanner, 2004). However, as this paper has
previously noted, the decision to DEMO ultimately
raises the question of what form this apology should
take, DEMO organizations have only begun to consider what
elements would make such a response more of an asset
than a liability (e.g., Kiger, 2004; Van Dusen & Spies,
2003). Our inquiry helps inform this issue by demonstrat-
ing that eVorts to repair trust when one has DEMO a
competence-based violation (e.g., a medical error) are
more successful DEMO one apologizes in a way that assumes
full blame for this transgression (i.e., with an internal
attribution) than by apologizing in a way that tries to
mitigate this blame (i.e., with an external attribution)DEMO
At the same time, these Wndings also caution manag-
ers from DEMO that such unmitigated apologies
would provide a universal solution. SpeciWcally, our
DEMO indicate that when one has committed an integ-
rity-based trust violation, DEMO apology that conveys an
internal attribution repairs trust less eVectively than
eVorts to mitigate this blame, with either an external
attribution or, as DEMO et al. (2004) have observed, a
denial. We do not DEMO such Wndings as justiWcation
to lie about one’s culpability if one is in fact guilty, par-
ticularly since Kim et al. (2004) have demonstrated that
such lies also exert a detrimental eVect on trust. Rather,DEMO
we consider such evidence a clarion call for managers to
P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65
61
do everything possible to avoid such integrity-based
trust violations from the beginning.
Third, given that evidence regarding the actual inXu-
ence of the situation on these violations was never
revealed in our study, and such situational inXuences can
often remain a matter of speculation in DEMO
life, managers may eventually face the dilemma of know-
ing that DEMO violation was inXuenced by the situation
but recognizing that they would repair trust more eVec-
tively if they did not make these situational inXuences
DEMO (i.e., assumed full blame with an internal attribu-
tion when the violation concerned matters of compe-
tence). In such cases, managers should prepare to
confront an ironic choice between being considered less
trustworthy due DEMO having been more honest (i.e., by
having made the appropriate situational attribution), or
being considered more trustworthy, due to having
engaged in deception (i.e., by having assumed full blame
when it wasn’t warranted)DEMO
Fourth, it is important to note that these eVects were
revealed DEMO the fact that the behavior underlying
these violations of trust was actually the same (i.e., an
improperly Wled tax return). The trust DEMO was sim-
ply framed as a competence- or integrity-related matter.
This raises the notion that many violations of trust may
be ambiguous enough to DEMO framed in multiple ways.6
Cursory observations suggest, however, that this oppor-
tunity to frame violations diVerently typically receives
very little attention from those DEMO seek trust repair.
The present Wndings challenge the wisdom of this over-
sight by highlighting the importance not only of consid-
ering, but also of inXuencing how trust violations are
framed and by revealing that such DEMO can be just as
important as the kind of verbal response one might pro-
vide. Of course, we do not contend that all eVorts to
frame a violation in a particular way will be successful.
But, to the extent that an accused party is able to shape
or DEMO the perceiver’s understanding of the nature of
the violation, our research DEMO that he or she will be
able to inXuence the eVectiveness of the violation
response.
Finally, these Wndings oVer insights not only to those
who wish to repair trust, but also for those seeking to
assess the trustworthiness of others. Given the impor-
tance of trust in organizational DEMO, one might assume
that people would be particularly careful in making DEMO
assessments. The present Wndings suggest, however, that
even in the aftermath of an alleged trust violation, peo-
ple are susceptible to attributional schemas, framing
eVects, and other heuristics that can bias their assess-
ments DEMO whether trust is warranted. Thus, managers
6 In support of this DEMO, research suggests that, rather than being de-
termined by rational evaluations of the facts and consequences sur-
rounding an event, moral judgments may more often occur through an
intuitive process that can be swayed by DEMO use of diVerent interpretive
metaphors (Haidt, 2001).
and researchers alike must begin to question why it is
that, if decisions to trust are so important, such decisions
can be made so poorly, and DEMO begin to develop strate-
gies to address these limitations. Along these lines, one
strategy we may consider to improve our assessments of
trustworthiness would be to become more aware of how
perceivers, themselves, have framed DEMO trust violation as
either a competence- or integrity-related matter and con-
sider how they would have reacted to the violation if
they had employed DEMO alternative frame. By doing so,
perhaps we may more routinely recognize how many
trust violations involve elements of competence and
integrity, exert greater eVorts to assess their relative
inXuence, and combine these weighted assessments to
make better-informed trust decisions.
Limitations and future directions
The Wndings from this DEMO also raise a number of
questions for subsequent research. One issue that may be
raised regarding the present methodology is that it has
focused DEMO trust violations in newly formed, rather than
longer term, relationships. This focus should not raise
concerns regarding whether initial levels of trust existed
DEMO had been subsequently violated, as prior studies that
have used this DEMO (Ferrin et al., 2005; Kim et al.,
2004) have oVered clear evidence that initial trust levels
were dramatically lowered by allegations DEMO untrustwor-
thy behavior. This focus on newly formed relationships
should also not limit its relevance for managerial settings,
given that a signiWcant proportion DEMO our business interac-
tions are likely to occur with those whom we have formed
weak, rather than strong, ties (Granovetter, 1995). DEMO
ers also should not necessarily conclude that studying
newly formed relationships represents a weak test of trust
repair, as recent research suggests that it may actually be
easier to repair trust in long-standing relationships, due to
victims’ greater pro-relationship motivation (Finkel,
Rusbult, Kumashiro, & Hannon, DEMO). Nevertheless, the
question of whether the mechanisms of trust repair DEMO
have been examined by this study might diVer in relation-
ships of longer duration is an important one that remains
unanswered and deserves attention DEMO future research. It
would, furthermore, be useful to examine whether these
kinds of mechanisms might diVer in qualitatively diVerent
relational forms (e.g., DEMO friends or family members
rather than between a potential employee and employer).
One might expect, for example, that the nature of the DEMO
tionship would aVect the perceived magnitude of the trust
violation and perhaps even one’s inclination to attribute
the violation to matters of competence vs. DEMO
A second concern regarding the present methodology
may arise from this study’s testing of undergraduate par-
ticipants. Prior research in this paradigm has tested DEMO
undergraduates and graduate business students and
found that these populations respond in the same ways
62
P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes DEMO (2006) 49–65
to the kinds of manipulations that have been used by
this study (Kim et al., 2004). ConWdence in the DEMO
validity of these results is also gained from the fact that
the information conveyed to participants did not require
any kind of specialized knowledge DEMO experience (e.g., of
tax law or income tax accounting) and DEMO recognizing
that the mechanisms under study reXect basic psycholog-
ical properties that underlie the cognitions of all individ-
uals, not simply those of college age. Nevertheless, it may
be helpful to conduct additional research that examines
more directly whether the speciWc patterns of eVects that
have been observed DEMO this study would generalize to
middle- and senior-level managers.
Third, our DEMO in these Wndings should be cau-
tioned to some degree by the study’s reliance on
scenarios. Although we have sought to enrich this meth-
DEMO approach by Wlming actors in a situation that
was as vivid and realistic as possible, our eVorts still
exhibit some important limitations. These limitations
include the fact that participants faced few if any of the
costs DEMO might have been associated with their apprais-
als and subsequent decisions, DEMO fact that each of them
had to imagine being in the role of a manager making
these hiring decisions rather than actually playing this
DEMO, the notion that such role playing only allows us to
assess DEMO perceptions of how their trust
“would have been repaired” as a result of these
responses rather than actual trust repair, and the fact
that participants were only given one candidate to evalu-
ate rather than make DEMO choice among many. For such
reasons, the present inquiry may be DEMO suitable as an
assessment of basic judgmental processes per se, rather
DEMO as an inquiry that would necessarily generalize to
the speciWc context we have simulated (Greenberg &
Eskew, 1993), speciWcally the domain of accounting
industry hiring decisions.
Fourth, it may be worthwhile to determine whether
the trust repair eVects of oVering external attributions
would depend on the DEMO motive for the trust vio-
lation. Research has found, for example, that people
tend to infer more negative motives and attribute lower
morality DEMO targets whose aggression was perceived as
instrumental (facilitated by a desire DEMO personal gain),
as opposed to reactive (a response to provocation)
(Reeder, Kumar, Hesson-McInnis, & TraWmow, 2002).
And though the present study did not focus on aggres-
sion per se, one might observe that its manipulations
signaled a motive that was more reactive (i.e., either
bad information or pressure from managers) than
instrumental in DEMO and wonder whether the results
might have diVered if more instrumental motives had
been conveyed. Of course, it is easy to imagine why
those who wish to mitigate their blame would be
tempted to explain that DEMO untrustworthy behavior
was in part forced by the situation (i.e., a reactive
motive), whereas the mitigating value of stating that
situational incentives DEMO the untrustworthy behav-
ior in eVect too good to resist (i.e., an instrumental
motive) is rather diYcult to comprehend. This ratio-
nale is what led us to develop the speciWc external attri-
butions manipulated in DEMO study. Nonetheless, a study
that compares the implications of reactive and DEMO
mental motives for trust repair may prove illuminating
on theoretical, if DEMO practical, grounds.
A Wfth concern is the question of why these DEMO,
as well as those for Kim et al. (2004), DEMO more
robust eVects for perceived integrity compared to per-
ceived competence. Although trust researchers have
consistently found competence and integrity are among
the most DEMO determinants of trustworthiness,
some have found that competence was more important
than integrity (Butler & Cantrell, 1984), whereas others
have found DEMO reverse (Schindler & Thomas, 1993).
Thus, it may be DEMO to investigate what features of
this and Kim et al.’s (2004) studies may have driven
their unbalanced trust belief eVects. Are these more
DEMO Wndings for perceived integrity unique to the
domain of trust repair or the speciWc context examined
by these studies? Or do these Wndings oVer broader
implications by shifting the overall weight of evidence
to the claim DEMO impression formation is more heavily
determined by the appraisal of morality (DEMO)
than competence (Wojciszke, Bazinska, & Jaworski,
1998)?
Finally, we should note that the results contained
herein cannot attest to whether the verbal responses
oVered in this study were suYcient to completely DEMO
trust to pre-transgression levels. To address that ques-
tion in the present study would have involved acquiring
pre-and post-violation trust measures in addition to DEMO
post-verbal response trust measures. We did not collect
these additional measures due to some methodological
concerns, and because we believe this is a separate ques-
tion that warrants its own study. However, it would be
worth considering how future research may be designed
to overcome such concerns, and ultimately address the
question of whether trust can ever be “fully repaired.”
DEMO these issues reveal, an enormous range of theoreti-
cal and empirical DEMO remains to be answered.
Indeed, the importance of trust and ease DEMO which it
can be broken stands in stark contrast to how little we
know about its repair. As such, the present eVort resolves
a small, albeit important, piece of this large and complex
puzzle. We DEMO, therefore, that these and related ques-
tions regarding the trust repair process receive signiW-
cant attention in the future.
