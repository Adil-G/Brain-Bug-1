THE ROLE OF CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION
DIMENSIONS IN TRUST REPAIR

We examine the repair of one party’s trust in another via repairing trustworthiness
(Mayer, DEMO, & Schoorman, 1995). Based on Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory,
we posit that causal attributions (i.e., locus of causality, controllability, and stability)
for the cause of a negative outcome in a trusting relationship explain when trustwor-
thiness is in need of repair DEMO how trustworthiness may be repaired by the trustee’s
efforts. We also discuss the role of specific emotional reactions of the trustor in this
process.
DEMO the introduction of trust as a construct of
interest in the behavioral sciences almost fifty
years ago (e.g., Deutsch, 1958), researchers have
established its pivotal role in relationships
within and between organizations (Kramer &DEMO
Tyler, 1996; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998)DEMO While trust has been widely hailed for its
central role in establishing and maintaining
close, cooperative, and productive relationships
(Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, 2000; Deutsch,
1958; Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Gambetta, 1988), dam-
age to trust through defection and betrayal DEMO
have devastating consequences on relation-
ships (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; DEMO, 1996).
Researchers have called for a deeper understand-
ing of DEMO theoretical processes that enable and
facilitate trust repair (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996), with
research only recently beginning to systemati-
cally explore this DEMO (e.g., Kim, Ferrin, Coo-
per, & Dirks, 2004; DEMO & Watabe, 2005;
Schweitzer, Hershey, & Bradlow, 2006). We seek to
facilitate study of this problem by considering
contributions that DEMO be gained from examining
Weiner’s (1986) three causal attribution dimen-
sions in the damage and repair of trust.
Consistent with other researchers (e.g., Ferrin,
Kim, Cooper, & Dirks, 2007; Lewicki & Bunker,
1996), we contend that attribution theories (Fiske

for their helpful and constructive feedback DEMO earlier ver-
sions of this paper. A Wasmer Summer Research Grant from
John Carroll University provided valuable financial support
for the preparation of this DEMO
& Taylor, 1991) can offer insights into how trust
grows, DEMO, and is repaired. Several studies
of trust development have indicated that DEMO in
another is enhanced to the extent that the oth-
er’s trustworthiness can be ascribed to factors
that are internal to the trustee, rather than situ-
ationally driven (Kruglanski, 1970; Malhotra &
Murnighan, 2002; Strickland, 1958). Furthermore,
even when managers have to deliver DEMO
outcomes to subordinates, those subordinates are
less likely to blame their DEMO (i.e., develop
internal attributions regarding those negative out-
comes) when DEMO managers enact trustworthy be-
havior in the form of communication and concern
(Korsgaard, Brodt, & Whitener, 2002). Other studies
have examined DEMO trust development is affected
by attributional biases (Ferrin & Dirks, 2003), how
attributions are susceptible to self-serving biases
driven by feelings of DEMO (Weber, Malho-
tra, & Murnighan, 2005), and how individuals may
develop sinister attributions regarding others’ mo-
tives (Kramer, 1999).
DEMO recently, researchers have begun to ap-
ply an attributional perspective to DEMO issue of
trust repair (e.g., Kim, Dirks, Cooper, & DEMO,
2006; Kim et al., 2004). This research draws on the
schematic model of dispositional attribution
(Reeder & Brewer, 1979) to examine how specific
types of social accounts (e.g., apologies and de-
DEMO) may be useful in repairing trust, depend-
ing on whether the violation concerned matters
of competence or integrity (cf. Mayer, Davis, &DEMO
Schoorman, 1995). Ferrin et al. (2007) have called
for DEMO research to understand the attribu-

tional processes involved in other types of social
accounts, as well as more substantive actions
designed to repair trust, such as “hostage post-
ing” (Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005).
The purpose of this paper DEMO to further develop
an attributional perspective on trust repair us-
ing Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory as
an overarching framework. We use Weiner’s
DEMO for four reasons. First, Weiner (1986) pre-
sents relevant causal DEMO dimensions be-
yond internal versus external locus of causality
that predominates in prior work connecting at-
tribution theory with trust (e.g., Kruglanski, 1970;
Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Strickland, 1958). For
example, DEMO theory articulates the stabil-
ity attribution, which has important effects on
DEMO of future behavior and is therefore
likely to be instrumental in trust repair. Second,
Weiner’s theory is applicable to a variety of so-
DEMO accounts (e.g., beyond apology and denial;
Kim et al., DEMO) and substantive actions de-
signed to repair trust. Third, in addition to cog-
nitive processes in making attributions, Wein-
er’s theory explicitly incorporates the role of
emotions, which are relevant in discussing trust
decline and repair (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). Fi-
nally, Weiner’s theory has received extensive
research support, including areas conceptually
similar to the current issue of trust repair (e.g.,
Carroll, 1978; Carroll & Payne, DEMO, 1977; Folkes,
1984; Takaku, 2001). We will consider several
such studies later in this paper.
To that end, we start by briefly reviewing the
general process of how trust evolves in a DEMO
tionship. In the second section we use Weiner’s
(1986) causal attribution theory to consider the
process through which trustors react to negative
outcomes. DEMO provides a framework for under-
standing how broken trust might be repaired by
either altering causal attributions or by attenu-
ating negative emotions after DEMO violation. The
third section provides a specific illustration of
how social accounts relate to these processes. In
the final section we discuss the implications DEMO
causal attribution– based insights and offer di-
rections for future research.
TRUST EVOLUTION: THE BASIS FOR DECLINE
AND REPAIR
Several insightful models that posit how trust
develops within organizations have been pro-
posed (e.g., Butler, 1991; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996;
Academy of Management Review
January
DEMO et al., 1995; Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, &
Werner, DEMO). Of these, we chose to use the
Mayer et al. DEMO for our research for several
reasons. It has gained a great deal of accep-
tance in the literature, although we note that
other models have as well. Unlike some models
positing that feedback affects subsequent trust
DEMO (e.g., Blau, 1964; Zand, 1972; Zucker,
1986), the Mayer et al. model specifically inte-
grates a feedback loop from DEMO of taking
risks to subsequent perceptions of the trustee.
As detailed below, this feedback loop is compat-
ible with the sensemaking process outlined in
Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory. Mayer
et al.’s feedback loop does DEMO, however, to
explain either the critical process through which
outcomes of taking risks affect subsequent trust or
how to repair it. Thus, this model lends itself well
to the integration of insights that can be DEMO
from the dimensions of causal attribution. Per-
haps most important, the DEMO et al. model spe-
cifically delineates a parsimonious but fairly en-
compassing set of trustee characteristics that
comprise factors the trustor may perceive as DEMO
ing a negative outcome. As explained below,
these trustworthiness dimensions are possible
causal ascriptions for trust outcomes that are
integral to the application DEMO Weiner’s (1986) at-
tribution theory. While we recognize that, like
DEMO theory, the Mayer et al. model is not without
its critics (e.g., Tinsley, 1996; Wekselberg, 1996),
the feedback loop and the integration of the
trustworthiness factors within the model enable
us to DEMO this model most clearly to the causal
attribution dimensions in Weiner’s (DEMO) attri-
bution theory.
Mayer et al. define trust as “the willingness DEMO
a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another
party based on the expectation that the other
will perform a particular action important DEMO the
trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or
control that DEMO party” (1995: 712). They propose
that in a relationship with a specific other party,
perceptions of three characteristics of the party—
DEMO, benevolence, and integrity—will dom-
inate the trustor’s assessment of the party’s
trustworthiness. Perceived ability is the extent
to which the party is deemed DEMO have skills and
competencies in the domain of interest, giving
the DEMO the capacity to contribute to the trus-
tor’s well-being. Perceived benevolence is the
extent to which the party is believed to desire to
do DEMO things for the trustor. Perceived in-
2009
Tomlinson and Mayer
tegrity means that the party adheres to a DEMO of
values that the trustor finds acceptable. Mayer et
al. propose that a combination of perceived abil-
ity, benevolence, and integrity will contribute DEMO
the assessment of the party’s trustworthiness. In
turn, these three factors DEMO trustworthiness will
lead to trust. It is important to note that trust in this
model is separate both from the perceptions of the
trustee DEMO from trusting behaviors. Thus, as we
discuss decline and repair of DEMO trustwor-
thiness dimensions, we expect these to lead to
changes in DEMO level of trust itself.
Mayer et al.’s model includes a feedback loop
from the outcome of risk taking back to the trust-
worthiness factors. DEMO researchers propose
that, after taking a risk with the trustee, the
trustor will observe the outcomes. If the out-
comes are positive, prior beliefs about trustwor-
thiness will be reinforced, and trust will either
be maintained or incrementally strengthened. If
the outcomes are negative, some combination of
ability, benevolence, and integrity will be re-
evaluated and possibly scaled DEMO, leading to
a lowered level of trust. The feedback loop thus
DEMO for the evolution of trust over time.
More important for this work, it accounts for
abrupt changes in trust after salient negative
outcomes. In addition, this model suggests that
a decline in trust is preceded by some evidence
justifying a decrease in some aspect of trustwor-
thiness. This DEMO us to posit that trust can be
repaired by increasing the trustworthiness di-
mension that declined. Thus, it is ultimately
within this feedback loop that trust repair after a
negative outcome takes place. We define trust
DEMO as a partial or complete restoration of the
willingness to be vulnerable to the other party
following a decline in that willingness. In the
DEMO of the Mayer et al. model, then, trust
repair is a specific case of the development of
trust via changes in the process DEMO in
the feedback loop.1
While the Mayer et al. model appears to pro-
vide a solid foundation for examining changes
1 It is important DEMO note that while much of our focus on
repair in this paper deals with the process after the trustor
has taken a risk and DEMO a negative outcome, our
use of Weiner’s attribution dimensions as a DEMO of under-
standing trust decline and repair also applies to effects on
the three dimensions of trustworthiness outside the Mayer
et al. feedback loop, such as from information about trust-
worthiness gained from a credible third DEMO
87
in trust over time (e.g., Serva, Fuller, & Mayer,
2005), there has been little explanation of how
the process DEMO updating prior perceptions of
trustworthiness takes place. For example, do all
DEMO outcomes automatically damage trust-
worthiness? If trust is damaged, what specific
repair efforts might be effective? We contend
that Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory fa-
cilitates understanding the processes that take
place in updating DEMO of trustworthi-
ness, thus offering new insights into how trust is
DEMO and repaired. In the following section
we provide a brief overview of Weiner’s (1986)
causal attribution theory and then use it to
explain how causal attribution dimensions op-
erate within the feedback loop following a
DEMO outcome.
CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION THEORY AND TRUST
REPAIR
In many areas of daily life, including relation-
ships, individuals frequently try to make sense
of DEMO world around them by making attributions
about the causes of events. In turn, these attri-
butions affect the way the individuals feel, their
DEMO, and their future behavior. In a the-
ory of this attribution DEMO formulated in an
achievement context, Weiner (1986) contends
that individuals DEMO the extent to which the
outcomes they experience are positive or nega-
tive. Similar to Weiner (1986), Mayer et al. (1995)
DEMO that individuals pay attention to the
outcomes of their risk taking in a relationship to
update prior trust. Here we are concerned with
the DEMO perception that a negative outcome
has occurred when the trustor perceives discon-
firming evidence regarding his or her beliefs or
expectations.2 This may entail DEMO trustor’s eval-
uating the degree to which his or her expecta-
tions failed to materialize, as well as the sever-
ity of the resulting harm he or she has suffered
(cf. Lewicki & Bunker, 1996)DEMO
In Weiner’s (1986) theory the perception of a
negative outcome leads to a general emotional
reaction of displeasure, which causes the indi-
vidual to identify the outcome’s cause (Heider,
1958; Weiner, 1986; DEMO & Weiner, 1981). The

dating trust after positive outcomes, but this is DEMO the
scope of this paper.

perceived cause is referred to in DEMO attribution
literature as a causal ascription. Weiner sug-
gests that, in DEMO achievement context, typical
causal ascriptions include factors such as abil-
ity, effort, luck, and task difficulty. This knowl-
edge is sought so DEMO individual can come to a
deeper understanding of the world and be more
effective in making decisions in the future
(Weiner, 1985).
DEMO to Weiner (1986), after an individual
determines an outcome’s cause (i.e., causal as-
cription), the individual evaluates that cause
along three primary, continuous attribution di-
mensions. Locus of causality makes the distinc-
tion between causes generated internally (i.e.,
by the trustee) or externally (i.e., by another ac-
tor or by the situation: Heider, 1958; Rotter, 1966),
indicating who or what is to blame for the out-
come. Controllability refers to the degree of vo-
litional control DEMO individual (e.g., the trustee or
another actor) has over the DEMO, or how
much to hold another accountable for the nega-
tive DEMO Stability is the degree to which the
cause is perceived to either fluctuate or remain
constant (Jones & Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967); sta-
bility thus indicates what to expect in the future
under similar circumstances.
These three attribution dimensions are inde-
pendent (Rosenbaum, 1972; Weiner, 1986). For
example, suppose you trust a colleague to finish
DEMO important report by a certain deadline so you
can finalize a proposal to a key client, and this
fails to happen. The causal ascription can vary
along all three attribution dimensions. You
could perceive the cause DEMO due to (1) the col-
league’s low aptitude (internal, stable, uncon-
trollable), (2) the colleague’s poor work habits
(internal, stable, controllable), (3) the colleague’s
being sick the day he or she was to work on the
report (internal, unstable, uncontrollable), (4) the
colleague’s not working hard on this particular
report (internal, unstable, controllable), (5) the
report critically depending on DEMO virtually im-
possible to collect (external, stable, uncontrolla-
ble), (6) one source of vital information for the
report being biased against the colleague (ex-
ternal, stable, controllable), (7) bad luck (exter-
nal, unstable, uncontrollable), or (8) coworkers’/
friends’ failure to provide the colleague vital
assistance on this occasion (external, DEMO,
controllable). According to Weiner (1986), results
of this DEMO analysis lead to both future
expectations and specific emotional reactions,
which jointly predict subsequent behavior.
Drawing on Weiner’s (1986) theory, we develop
a more detailed analysis of the Mayer et al.
(1995) feedback DEMO Specifically, a causal as-
cription for the negative outcome will be DEMO
mined. Fortunately, the Mayer et al. model pro-
vides a parsimonious, theoretically grounded
set of causes of an individual’s trust-relevant
behavior (ability, DEMO, and integrity).
Recognizing that negative outcomes may arise
in trusting DEMO through no fault of the
trustee, we also consider a separate DEMO
(“other”) to account for those possibilities. These
ascriptions in a trusting context are comparable
to ability, effort, luck, and task difficulty that
have been used in an achievement context.
Therefore, we argue that trust declines are due
to perceived decreases in the trustee’s ability,
benevolence, or integrity— often in the wake of a
negative outcome. Accordingly, trust repair in-
volves repairing the damaged factor of trustwor-
thiness. A causal DEMO dimensional anal-
ysis of the perceived cause of the negative
outcome (DEMO, ability, benevolence, integrity)
provides greater insight into when and DEMO
trust is damaged and, thus, how it can be re-
paired. As such, the attribution process will fo-
cus on understanding the factors that caused
the negative outcome and on predicting whether
the event is DEMO to recur in order to decide how
much to trust the trustee in the future.
To summarize, Weiner’s (1986) attribution the-
ory sheds light on the Mayer et al. (1995) feed-
back loop from DEMO negative outcome to rescaling
the trustworthiness factors by suggesting key
trust repair implications based on the causal
attribution– dimensional properties of the vari-
ous DEMO ascriptions and the specific emo-
tional reactions generated by these attributions.
These relationships are represented in Figure 1.
As the figure indicates, the feedback loop (from
the Mayer et al. [1995] model of trust) from DEMO
comes to updated evaluations of the trustworthi-
ness factors is explicated by causal ascriptions
and attributions in the cognitive sensemaking
process. Emotional reactions affect DEMO evalua-
tions of trustworthiness and subsequent trust. This
process can be affected by a violator’s attempts to
repair trust, as illustrated in the model.
Below we describe how an attribution-dimen-
sional analysis of each potential causal DEMO
tion affects the decline and repair of trustwor-

thiness (and, ultimately, trust). Adapting
Weiner’s framework to a DEMO context, the trust-
worthiness factors of ability, benevolence, and in-
DEMO are the possible causal ascriptions related
to the trustee. We also include a separate category
to account for causes unrelated to the trustee’s
ability, benevolence, and integrity. It is with this
latter category that we begin our analysis.
Causal Ascription to a Factor Unrelated to
Ability, Benevolence, DEMO Integrity
According to Mayer et al. (1995), after a nega-
DEMO outcome the trustor will reevaluate and
possibly scale back the perceived ability, be-
nevolence, and/or integrity of the trustee. In-
corporating Weiner’s (1986) theory to examine
Mayer et al.’s feedback loop suggests that trust
will only decline when an individual has devel-
oped some level of DEMO and then perceives dis-
confirming evidence due to the causal attribu-
tions made for the negative outcome. Thus, not
every negative outcome will cause trust to de-
cline. The trustor may conclude either that an-
other DEMO or that situational factors caused the
negative outcome. If the causal ascription for a
negative outcome is unrelated to the trustee’s
ability, benevolence, DEMO integrity, the only criti-
cal causal attribution dimension to consider
with DEMO to the relationship with the trustee
is locus of causality. While Weiner’s theory in-
dicates that a trustor will also evaluate the con-
trollability DEMO stability of the cause of the neg-
ative outcome, if the DEMO cannot be at least
partially attributed as internal to the trustee, DEMO
will not affect the trustee’s perceived trustwor-
thiness. Specifically, the trustor DEMO determine
whether the negative outcome is due to internal
(i.e., the trustee) or external (i.e., another actor or
the situation) causes.
DEMO the trustor believes the cause of the outcome
is unrelated to the trustee’s ability, benevolence,
or integrity, the trustor will deem the DEMO ex-
ternal to the trustee. An external locus indicates
that the trustee had no role in causing the out-
come, which precludes any need to impugn the
trustee’s ability, benevolence, or integrity (fac-
tors internal to the trustee). Since an external
90
attribution means no aspect of the trustee’s
trustworthiness is called into DEMO, there is
no need to repair trustworthiness. Lewicki and
Bunker (1996) have argued that disconfirmed ex-
pectations (i.e., negative outcomes from trust)
are not considered trust violations when situa-
tional factors are deemed DEMO be the cause.
Causal Ascription to the Trustee’s Ability,
Benevolence, DEMO Integrity
The trustor may conclude that the cause of the
negative outcome is due to some deficiency in
the trustee’s ability, benevolence, and/DEMO integ-
rity, which the Mayer et al. (1995) model explic-
DEMO ascribes to the trustee. Following Weiner
(1986), causal ascriptions to DEMO trustee’s ability,
benevolence, or integrity lead the trustor to eval-
DEMO the cause of a negative outcome as an
internal (to the DEMO) locus of causality.
Upon deciding that the cause of the negative
DEMO was the trustee’s ability, benevolence,
or integrity (i.e., internal DEMO the trustee), the trus-
tor’s attributions regarding the controllability
and stability of the cause also become relevant
in understanding how trustworthiness factors
are DEMO We first explain the controllability
and stability dimensions below and then dis-
cuss how ability, benevolence, and integrity are
likely to be evaluated DEMO these dimensions.
We use this as a basis to consider how each
trustworthiness factor can be repaired.
The trustor determines if the negative out-
DEMO is due to controllable causes. Controllabil-
ity means that although a cause may emanate
from the trustee (i.e., be internal), the trustee
DEMO not be able to exert control over the out-
come. As it becomes increasingly beyond the
trustee’s volitional capacity to alter the negative
outcome, the trustee becomes less culpable, or
blameworthy (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). With in-
creasing trustee controllability for a negative
outcome, however, DEMO may be increasing
damage to trustworthiness. We will elaborate
on this issue when discussing each of the trust-
worthiness factors.
Trustors also make attributions DEMO the sta-
bility dimension to determine if the negative
outcome is due to unchanging circumstances or
to more temporary, unstable causes (Weiner,
DEMO). Weiner (1986) regards stability, compared
to locus and controllability, as the primary
driver of future expectations, because an out-
Academy of Management Review

come due to a permanent cause leads one to
DEMO the same result in future situations with
similar circumstances, whereas an DEMO due
to a temporary cause leads one to expect that
future outcomes may turn out differently. In the
current context of trust repair, if a negative out-
come is perceived to be due to a stable DEMO
(i.e., some aspect of the trustee’s trustworthiness
that is relatively permanent), one may expect a
negative outcome to recur under similar circum-
DEMO This diagnostic information justifies a
downward revision of trust. This is not evident
from an assessment of locus or controllability,
since these dimensions DEMO not consider the per-
manence of the cause. Researchers have argued
that when a negative outcome is perceived as
an isolated event caused by DEMO or fluc-
tuating circumstances, the effect on trust will be
minimized (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993). But DEMO that outcome “is attributed
to an individual’s typical context-specific be-
havior and there is a perception that similar
violations may recur within the same DEMO,
trust will be disrupted” (Sitkin & Roth, 1993: 371)DEMO
One important contribution of this paper
arises from the fact that prior empirical research
on trust using attribution theory has focused
almost exclusively on DEMO of causality (e.g.,
Korsgaard et al., 2002; Kruglanski, 1970; Malho-
tra & Murnighan, 2002; Strickland, 1958). Some
prior DEMO has implicitly suggested the impor-
tance of controllability (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996)
and stability (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Sitkin &
DEMO, 1993) but has not extensively explored and
developed these attribution constructs in the
context of trust repair. Weiner’s (1986) stability
attribution is DEMO to be especially relevant in
the context of trust repair, since DEMO is the key
driver of future expectations in subsequent in-
teractions with the trustee. The stability of the
cause of a negative outcome speaks DEMO whether
the same thing will happen in the future under
similar circumstances, which can be expected to
affect the trustor’s willingness to be vulnerable
to the trustee in the future. Thus, this research
illuminates the importance of considering con-
trollability and stability, in addition to locus, in
DEMO trust decline and repair.
The lack of attention in the trust repair litera-
ture to Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory is sur-
prising, given its support in empirical studies
conceptually similar to trust repair. These stud-
DEMO foreshadow the relative importance of sta-
2009
Tomlinson and Mayer
91
bility attributions in this context. For example,DEMO
in a study of parole decisions by Carroll (1978)
and DEMO and Payne (1976, 1977), parole deci-
sion makers relied heavily on evidence such as
criminal history to assess the stability of the
DEMO of the crime. An extensively planned
crime was regarded as due to more stable
causes (e.g., a psychopathic personality),
whereas the same crime committed impulsively
and without a prior record was regarded as due
DEMO more unstable causes (e.g., a crime of pas-
sion). Convicts were more likely to be paroled
when the cause of their crime DEMO deemed un-
stable. Releasing a convicted criminal may be
regarded as an act based on trust whereby pa-
role decision makers are being vulnerable DEMO the
possibility of recidivism.
Similarly, consumer reactions to product fail-
ure (Folkes, 1984) are heavily influenced by sta-
bility attributions that, in turn, drive subsequent
behaviors. When product failure is attributed to
stable factors (e.g., a “bad” company), individu-
als develop negative future expectations DEMO the
form of future product dissatisfaction, and they
indicate a preference DEMO a monetary refund.
Conversely, a failure attributed to unstable
causes (an anomalous bad shipment of parts) is
associated with positive future expectancies
(DEMO satisfaction), and consumers indicate a
preference for simply exchanging the product
for a replacement. This finding may be reframed
to suggest that consumers DEMO reluctant to trust
a company again after a failure ascribed to sta-
ble causes but are willing to trust a company
again when a DEMO is due to unstable factors.
In sum, after a negative outcome, a trustor will
evaluate the perceived cause. To the extent that
the DEMO is deemed to be internal, controllable,
and stable, the negative outcome is more likely
to result in lower perceived trustworthiness.
This is DEMO with recent work by Weiner on
social transgressions: “Responsibility judg-
ments DEMO particularly likely in instances in
which the cause of a transgression is perceived
to be internal and controllable” (2001: 344). More-
over, since trust is future oriented (Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996), when the cause of a negative out-
come is regarded as internal to DEMO controllable
by the trustee and as stable, this is most likely DEMO
result in decreased trustworthiness; the negative
outcome was the trustee’s fault DEMO is likely to
happen again under similar circumstances. Here,
the cause of the negative outcome is not likely to
change, so subsequent trust should be lowered or
completely withdrawn (cf. Weiner, 1986).
Having DEMO the relevance of each of
Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution dimensions,
we now examine how each trustworthiness fac-
tor (all of which have an internal locus of con-
trol) will likely be evaluated in terms of control-
lability and stability attributions after a
negative outcome. Based on DEMO analysis, we
then consider how a damaged trustworthiness
factor can be DEMO
Ability. Some types of abilities are considered
to be aptitudes (Mayer DEMO al., 1995) and are there-
fore not generally considered under volitional
control. Weiner (1986, 2001) cites general cogni-
tive ability, coordination, and artistic aptitude
as examples. Skills and competencies, however,
are abilities that an individual can develop over
time (Mayer et al., 1995) and, therefore, are more
controllable (e.g., an accountant knowing how DEMO
properly file a tax return; Kim et al., 2004). Rela-
tively speaking, if the causal ascription of a
negative outcome is low ability, there may be a
larger decline in trustworthiness when the type
of ability in question is deemed controllable
than when it is not. DEMO is because judgments of
another’s responsibility for a social transgres-
sion are deemed to be greater when the cause is
due to a factor DEMO that person’s control (e.g.,
negligence in learning the relevant tax DEMO)
than to a factor the individual cannot control
(e.g., low quantitative aptitude; Weiner, 1995,
2001). Individuals can exert effort DEMO acquire
skills in areas where they strive to be trusted. If
they choose not to do so, their failure is control-
lable. This may lead to less favorable assess-
ments of integrity or benevolence.
For example, consider a situation where an
accountant does not file a tax return DEMO
(Kim et al., 2004) as due to low ability. One DEMO
planation might be that the accountant is ill.
While internal to the trustee, being sick lowers
the ability to perform and is not controllable.
The person’s perceived trustworthiness will de-
cline because he or she will DEMO deemed not able to
perform effectively. Alternatively, the accountant
may be DEMO but has not stayed abreast of tax
code changes. While the causal ascription is still
a lack of ability—the accountant does not have the
DEMO tax skills—this reason for the lack of
ability is controllable by the trustee.
In both of these cases, the accountant is
deemed not to have the ability for successful

task completion. The reason for this DEMO the
former example is not controllable, whereas in
the latter example DEMO is controllable. In both
cases trustworthiness will decline because of
lower perceived ability. Since in the latter case
the accountant might have chosen to DEMO more
current with tax code changes but did not, this
may DEMO lead to a reevaluation either of the
accountant’s integrity or benevolence. Thus, the
decline in perceived ability will damage trust-
worthiness for the accountant in both cases, but
may also damage the perceived integrity (e.g.,DEMO
does not reflect expected levels of professional
conduct) or benevolence (e.g., does not care
enough about the trustor’s interests to put in
sufficient effort) of the accountant in the latter
case, causing his or DEMO trustworthiness to drop
more than in the situation where the accoun-
tant’s lack of ability was not controllable.
The type of ability ascribed as DEMO cause of a
negative outcome will also be evaluated along
the stability dimension. Ability can be conceptu-
alized in terms of one’s aptitude or DEMO terms of
expertise, skills, and competencies. In addition to
being uncontrollable, aptitude is regarded as a
stable individual difference, whereas individuals
can DEMO to develop expertise, skills, and compe-
tencies (Heneman & Judge, 2006). Mayer et al.’s
(1995) construct of ability includes both. DEMO contrast
to aptitude, expertise and skills can be unstable in
the DEMO term. If the trustee gets proper training,
one can expect these types of ability to rise.
The foregoing analysis suggests how the ini-
DEMO causal attribution process leads to damaged
trust. That is, the initial DEMO ascription (abil-
ity of the trustee) and the attributions made on
that basis (degree to which the cause is deemed
to be internal, controllable, and stable) have
implications for updated (i.e., lowered) DEMO
tions of ability and, hence, trust. It is essential to
now consider how the initial postviolation
causal attribution can be revised in a DEMO
that repairs trust. Initial attributions are not al-
ways final, since DEMO can be invalidated or
modified as additional information is received
and processed (Krull, 1993). Gilbert, Pelham, and
Krull (1988) posit DEMO, when reaching attribu-
tions, individuals go through a three-stage pro-
cess where they (1) identify the actor’s behavior,
(2) infer DEMO the actor has a disposition that
corresponds to that behavior, and (3) revise that
inference by adjusting for situational factors.
Whereas the first two processes occur spontane-
ously and effortlessly, the latter involves more
mental effort and is engaged in when the ob-
server has the motivation DEMO cognitive re-
sources to do so (Silvera & Laufer, 2005). To the
extent that trust violations are negative, unex-
pected, and DEMO, their occurrence should
produce high motivation to understand the fac-
tors DEMO led to this event (cf. Heider, 1958; Wong
& Weiner, 1981). The response by the offender
often supplies much-wanted additional infor-
DEMO in this regard (Bies, 1987; Lewicki & Bun-
ker, 1996), and this information may directly re-
late to revised attributions (Weiner, 1995). In fact,
an excuse given by the offender (DEMO type of social
account that is examined in more detail later in
the paper) literally connotes a revised attribu-
tion (ex  from DEMO cuse  cause—i.e., from one
cause to another).
This causal DEMO dimensional analysis
raises several possibilities for various re-
sponses of the violator when attempting to re-
pair a damaged assessment of his or her DEMO
One possibility is for the trustee to convince the
trustor that his or her ability was not the cause
of the negative outcome and DEMO some external
cause is to blame instead. As explained earlier,
external attributions nullify the need to repair
trustworthiness. Another possibility is for the
DEMO to conclude that the specific ability in
question is uncontrollable, although DEMO option
may not fully repair this form of trustworthiness.
For example, DEMO a trustee has low quantitative
aptitude (uncontrollable), one would not DEMO
likely to trust this individual with tasks such as
balancing one’s checkbook, since the cause of
the loss of trust continues. However, a DEMO pos-
sibility is for the trustee to convince the trustor
that the form of ability in question is unstable.
Since a complete long-term lack DEMO ability may
preclude the trustee from providing help to the
trustor under any circumstances, it is important
to vindicate perceptions of low ability by per-
suading the trustor that ability will improve in
the future (i.e., be unstable). In particular, if abil-
ity is malleable, this suggests that trust can be
repaired, because the perceived level of ability
that gave rise to initial trust (i.e., before the
negative outcome) is likely to be restored: the
trustee is able to increase his or her ability.
Whereas a stable form of ability like IQ provides
DEMO opportunity for repair, an unstable form
has possibilities for improvement.

Proposition 1: Damaged perceptions of
ability can be repaired by demonstrat-
ing that the cause of the negative out-
DEMO was due to (a) an external factor,
(b) a more uncontrollable form of abil-
ity, and/or (c) a more unstable form of
ability.
Benevolence. If the causal ascription for the
negative DEMO is low benevolence, this is
likely to be regarded as controllable DEMO the
trustee. In the Mayer et al. model, benevolence
is a DEMO orientation of the trustee specific to
the trustor. This orientation can manifest itself
by such behaviors as taking risks or making
sacrifices for the DEMO of the trustor. This is a
quality that the trustee can consciously and in-
tentionally affect by engaging in behaviors
helpful to or protective DEMO the trustor. Mayer et al.
contend that the trustee’s motivation to lie (Hov-
land, Janis, & Kelley, 1953) is inversely related to
benevolence; lying and similar behaviors are
controllable.
Benevolence will also be evaluated in terms
of the stability dimension. Mayer and col-
leagues (Mayer et al., 1995; Schoorman, Mayer, &
Davis, 2007) contend that, relative to ability and
integrity, perceptions of benevolence will in-
crease DEMO slowly as the relationship between
the parties develops over time. Deeper, DEMO
relationships may lead the trustor to a highly
stable attribution regarding the trustee’s benev-
olence— even to the point that the trustor re-
fuses DEMO believe evidence of the trustee’s mal-
feasance that would be sufficient to convince
objective third parties (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).
Similarly, once perceptions of the trustee’s low
benevolence are in place, they are likely to pro-
duce a very stable attribution (Kramer, 1999).
While DEMO perception of benevolence becomes
stable as the relationship develops over time,
early in the relationship it is less so (Mayer et
al., DEMO). Without a history of demonstrated be-
nevolence from the trustee, DEMO or negative
interactions are likely to take on greater signif-
icance for the trustor. A given act that appears to
indicate either high or DEMO benevolence tends to
stand alone as input, rather than being taken DEMO
the context of everything that has happened be-
tween the parties. Thus, while benevolence is
likely to be perceived as stable in an estab-
lished relationship, it is unstable early in a re-
lationship.
As with ability, there is some capacity for the
quality of the relationship between the parties
to evolve. Even in an established relationship,
neglect of DEMO other party can damage the per-
ception of benevolence over time. In sum, then,
benevolence is internal to the trustee, is control-
DEMO, and is relatively stable in an established
relationship but is unstable DEMO a new one.
This causal attribution– dimensional analysis
raises several possibilities for repairing trust
caused by damaged benevolence. The trustee
could convince the trustor DEMO low benevolence
was not the outcome’s cause but, rather, that the
cause was external to the trustee. Alternatively,
the trustee could attempt DEMO persuade the trustor
that the cause was due to a type of inability that
is less stable than benevolence at that point in
the DEMO For example, a scenario study
by Elangovan, Auer-Rizzi, and Szabo (2007) ma-
nipulated whether a trust violation was attrib-
uted to the trustee’s being either unable (i.e., low
ability) or unwilling (i.e., low benevolence) to
meet expectations. They found that trust eroded
more rapidly when trustees were seen as un-
willing to honor trust. Another possibility DEMO for
the trustor to be persuaded that this instance of
low benevolence was an isolated or obsolete
circumstance (i.e., unstable). To the DEMO that
the trustor sees the trustee as having a “change
of heart” and desires to do good in the future,
damage resulting in DEMO benevolence may be
repaired. Cold and bitter relationships can
warm and sweeten (usually over time and with
repeated work; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).
Proposition 2: Damaged benevolence
can be repaired by demonstrating that
the cause of the negative outcome was
due to (a) an external DEMO, (b) a more
unstable form of ability, or (c) an inci-
dent of low benevolence that is un-
stable.
Integrity. If DEMO negative outcome’s cause is
perceived to be low integrity (i.e., the trustee
does not adhere to a set of principles that the
trustor DEMO acceptable), this is likely to be seen
as controllable by the trustee. Weiner (1986) con-
tends that individual characteristics such as la-
DEMO and industriousness are generally per-
ceived as personally controllable. These
characteristics also seem to describe the extent
to which one would be considered to DEMO integ-
rity by the Mayer et al. (1995) definition. Along
94
Academy of Management Review
January
these lines, Kim et al. (DEMO) used as an example
of low integrity an accountant who files DEMO in-
correct tax return intentionally. This behavior is
likely to be perceived as controllable—as cho-
sen by the accountant. Mayer et al. cite factors
DEMO as adherence to principles of fairness and
following through on commitments as affecting
perceptions of integrity. Indeed, trustees are of-
ten regarded as able to control the extent to
which they demonstrate integrity in these ways.
DEMO, for example, theories that address
when individuals are deemed to have violated
fairness when they could have chosen to behave
fairly instead (fairness theory; Folger & Cropan-
zano, 2001), or failed to follow DEMO on their
promises and commitments (behavioral integ-
rity theory; Simons, DEMO).
The trustee’s integrity is also likely to be re-
garded as stable, particularly when the evalua-
tion is that integrity is low. Individuals found to
be dishonest on one occasion are more likely to
be DEMO dishonest in general (Kim et al.,
2004). Trafimow, Bromgard, Finlay, and Ketelaar
(2005) describe an analysis by Kant (1991/1797) to
consider why behaviors that reflect low integrity
may carry strong signaling value about the per-
son. Kant differentiated between perfect and im-
DEMO duties in the moral arena. Perfect duties,
he argued, must DEMO performed at all times and
do not allow for situational exceptions, DEMO
exceptions are allowed with imperfect duties
under some circumstances. As an example,
Trafimow et al. state that telling a beggar a lie
that DEMO has no money is a violation of a perfect
duty (one DEMO never lie), whereas refusing to
give money to the beggar only violates an im-
perfect duty of charity. Kant asserted that viola-
tion DEMO a perfect duty carries more information
about the moral status of the person as an en-
during quality. Indeed, many organizations rely
heavily on paper-and-pencil integrity tests as a
selection tool for applicants, because indica-
tions of past dishonesty can predict a variety of
counterproductive work-related behaviors
(Sackett, 1994). It is well accepted that convicted
felons have difficulty securing employment, ap-
parently owing to ascriptions of low integrity
and an associated assumption of its stability.
This analysis shows there is a distinction be-
DEMO integrity and the other two trustworthi-
ness factors. While some types of ability are
stable (e.g., physical coordination, general intel-
ligence), many ability issues can be developed
with training or experience. Benevolence is
likely DEMO be perceived as stable in a well-
developed relationship, but it DEMO unstable in a
newer relationship and can also develop over
time. Thus, to understand trust repair, it is im-
portant to note that DEMO appears to be the
most stable factor of trustworthiness. We note
that while both benevolence in a well-estab-
lished relationship and integrity are relatively
DEMO, accumulating disconfirming evidence or
the occurrence of a “frame-breaking” event can
DEMO one of these evaluations (Lewicki & Bun-
ker, 1996; Robinson, Dirks, & Ozcelik, 2004). For
example, the perception of integrity of a previ-
ously respected CFO would be severely dam-
aged by DEMO discovery that the executive embez-
zled. Nevertheless, these assessments are seen
DEMO generally stable in the literature.
We draw again on this causal attribution–
dimensional analysis to understand how to re-
pair damaged trustworthiness in terms DEMO low
integrity. Since it is likely to be the most stable,
an ascription of low integrity as the cause of a
negative outcome DEMO likely to be most resistant
to repair. Because of its stability, DEMO causal as-
cription of low integrity leads a trustor to be-
lieve that future risk taking with the trustee is
likely to lead to DEMO negative outcomes. With
this in mind, there are few possibilities for DEMO
pairing damaged integrity. Essentially, it is
likely that the best way DEMO repair low integrity is
for the trustee to attempt to reattribute the cause
to a less damaging causal ascription, such as an
external cause, or to ability. For example, Kim et
al. (2004) found DEMO denials were superior to
apologies in repairing damaged trust due to an
integrity violation. As we will explore later, de-
nials attempt to shift the attribution from being
internal to external.
Proposition 3: Damaged perceptions of
integrity can be repaired by demon-
strating that the cause of the DEMO
outcome was due to (a) an external
cause or (b) a less stable internal
cause.
Since we are concerned with trust repair DEMO
this paper, we focus on revised causal attribu-
tions after initial DEMO attributions have al-
ready been reached by the trustor (i.e., initial
causal analysis has led to a decline in trust). Of
course, social accounts and other substantive
attempts to mitigate damage to trust may DEMO

undertaken more proactively by the violator, po-
tentially precluding the perception of a negative
outcome altogether. However, this issue does
not deal with trust repair and is therefore not a
focus DEMO our research here.
Specific Emotional Reactions
So far, we have focused DEMO the role of cogni-
tion in considering the dimensions of causal
attributions in the decline and repair of trust.
However, a number of researchers have argued
that emotions are also a critical consideration in
understanding how DEMO changes. For example,
Williams has asserted that “affective responses
(e.g., anger, disappointment, joy) influence how
people evaluate their feelings for, DEMO
to, and trust in others” (2001: 379). Jones and
DEMO have argued that “moods and emo-
tions . . . contribute to the ongoing experience
of trust, providing people with signals concern-
ing the changing nature of their ongoing expe-
rience of trust” (1998: 534)DEMO Dunn and Schweitzer
(2005) found that negative emotions affect trust
evaluations even when the negative emotions’
source is distinct from the evaluation target.
DEMO, those who experience a decline
in trust in another often experience DEMO adverse
emotional reaction resulting in a sense of viola-
tion, particularly DEMO the offender’s actions are
perceived as freely chosen (Lewicki & Bunker,DEMO
1996). In the closely related area of psychologi-
cal contracts, DEMO and Robinson (1997) dis-
tinguish a breach, or a cognition DEMO the orga-
nization has not fulfilled its obligations, from a
violation, which is an adverse emotional reac-
tion to the breach. It is DEMO necessary to exam-
ine the negative emotions that result from the
causal attributions made for a negative outcome
(cf. Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Morrison & Robinson,
1997). As described earlier, a negative outcome
elicits general emotional displeasure, which ini-
tiates a sensemaking process that yields causal
ascriptions and causal attributions. As we ex-
amine in this section, specific emotional reac-
tions (i.e., anger, fear) arise depending on DEMO
causal attributions made. These emotions,
along with causal attributions, affect DEMO sub-
sequent trust and trustworthiness. We turn now
to a more detailed consideration of this process.
How specific emotional reactions affect sub-
sequent trust. DEMO (1986) attribution theory
holds that the trustor’s causal analysis along
locus, controllability, and stability dimensions
gives rise to specific emotional reactions, an
assertion that has been supported empirically
(Rudolph, Roesch, Greitemeyer, & DEMO, 2004;
Weiner, Amirkhan, Folkes, & Verette, 1987;
DEMO, Russell, & Lerman, 1979). Thus, if after
the negative outcome the trustor’s attribution
process concludes that the cause is internal and
DEMO and/or stable, the trustor is likely to
feel violated and DEMO experience specific negative
emotions.
In the current context, controllability attribu-
tions DEMO a negative outcome are associated with
anger, which Lewicki and Bunker (1996) cite as a
key emotional response to a trust violation. Spe-
cifically, Weiner discusses anger toward an-
other as arising from “an ascription of a nega-
tive, self-related outcome or event to factors
controllable by others” (1985: 562). It is worth
noting that one’s trust DEMO another might decline
because of a factor beyond the trustee’s control
(DEMO, an employee with low mathematical apti-
tude may not be trusted DEMO on heavily
quantitative tasks), yet this would not be likely
to produce a sense of “violation” (i.e., strong
negative emotions). At DEMO heart of the matter is
whether or not the violated party believes that
whatever loss or suffering arises from the neg-
ative outcome was DEMO fault and might
have been averted by that party. Because anger
arises from the cognition that a trustee is to
blame for a negative DEMO he or she could
have controlled but chose not to (Barclay, Skar-
licki, & Pugh, 2005; Tangney & Dearing, 2002;
DEMO, 1982), it incites the injured person to un-
dertake self-protective DEMO with respect to
the trustee (Weiner, 2001). Stated differently, DEMO
trustor’s anger will lead to reduced willingness
to be vulnerable to the trustee. Based on this, we
posit that anger toward the trustee should be
negatively related to subsequent trust, and,
thus, actions that DEMO such anger should con-
tribute to repairing trust.
Mowrer (1960) describes fear as the continued
anticipation of a negative reinforcer. Stability
attributions for DEMO negative outcome result in fear
(Mowrer, 1960; Weiner, 1986), since stability sug-
gests that the circumstances that gave rise to
the DEMO outcome will occur again. Thus,
Weiner argues, “In attributional language... DEMO
should arise given failure [negative outcome]
and an attribution to a stable cause” (1986: 154).
Research has established that stability attribu-
96
Academy of Management Review

tions for negative outcomes are also DEMO
with hopelessness and resignation (Weiner,
Russell, & Lerman, 1978, 1979). Given a stable
cause (e.g., the trustee is deemed DEMO dishonest
person) for a negative event, the future is fore-
casted to look as bad as the past, causing one to
feel fearful regarding future interactions with
the other and to take protective action (cf.
Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998). Conversely, if
the attribution DEMO to an unstable cause (e.g., a
single temporary episode; Lewicki & Bunker,
1996), then a future negative outcome is less
certain, and so less fear may be expected. When
evaluating how much to trust, out of self-
protection, fear will lead an individual to DEMO
conservative estimates of the willingness to
be vulnerable to that party. Conversely, then,
reduction or elimination of fear of the trustee
should increase the willingness to be vulnera-
ble (i.e., trust) to the trustee again.
How specific emotional reactions affect trust-
worthiness. In addition to affecting DEMO directly,
we contend that specific emotional reactions af-
fect how a trustor processes information about a
trustee—that is, trustworthiness. Much prior work
has focused on cognitive aspects of evaluating
trustworthiness, but we note that this processing
does not occur in a sterile environment. Thus,
while causal DEMO result in specific emo-
tional reactions, those emotional reactions can be
DEMO to affect further cognitive processing.
Citing others in the psychology literature, DEMO
and George conclude that “one’s current affective
state may color one’s experience of trust and, thus,
the way a person forms opinions and makes judg-
ments about the trustworthiness of others” (1998:
534; DEMO added). Similarly, Williams (2001)
suggests that affect influences how people evalu-
ate others’ trustworthiness. Thus, a sense of viola-
tion can adversely affect the cognitive process by
which one evaluates information about a DEMO
ability, benevolence, and integrity. As Jones and
George put it, DEMO moods and emotions may
add a negative tone to interactions and may result
in an individual perceiving others as less trust-
worthy than they DEMO are” (1998: 534).
Researchers (Jones & George, 1998; DEMO,
2001) have shown that emotions affect the judg-
ment process, which suggests that, like trust,
perceptions of trustworthiness will be influ-
enced by emotions. Since emotions affect what
information the trustor attends to DEMO how it is
evaluated, they affect trust repair. Strong emo-
tions DEMO lead to ignoring or rationalizing away
new information about ability, benevolence, or
integrity that an outside observer might view as
positive developments in DEMO dimensions.
Summary. The literature reviewed above sug-
gests that emotions provide a psychological
context in which judgments about trustworthi-
ness and trust are made. DEMO context affects the
decisions individuals make about trust (Dunn &
Schweitzer, 2005; Jones & George, 1998; Wil-
liams, 2001). Based on Weiner’s (1986) theory, we
considered two specific emotional reactions that
are generated by specific causal attributions for
a negative outcome. We reviewed DEMO attribu-
tions give rise to these emotions. Negative emo-
tions can inhibit or prevent the repair of trust
either through evolution or point-in-time inter-
DEMO by the trustee, since they affect how
new information about the DEMO is processed
in updating both trustworthiness and trust.
Based on this, DEMO suggest that effective trust
repair may necessitate not only managing cog-
nitions but also emotions such that reducing
anger and fear may enable higher DEMO
levels of trustworthiness and trust.
In this regard, recent papers have DEMO for-
giveness, which is not to be confused with recon-
ciliation (Freedman, 1998; Tomlinson, Dineen, &
Lewicki, 2004), in DEMO of the victim’s resolving
negative emotions toward the offender after a vi-
olation (Aquino, Grover, Goldman, & Folger, 2003).
Forgiveness can be facilitated by the transgres-
sor’s use of accounts and/or penance. DEMO
takes away the negative emotions allows for ra-
tional processing of new information. At that point
trust can be repaired, because the victim can think
about the ascriptions and attributions rationally,
without letting emotions cloud DEMO process. Re-
search in the area of emotions is likely to be fruit-
ful in giving us a better understanding of what
actions by DEMO violating party are likely to initiate
the dissolution of negative emotions.
Proposition 4: Trust and trustworthiness
will be repaired more effectively if an-
ger and fear are reduced prior to or con-
currently with the repair DEMO
Thus far, we have used Weiner’s (1986) theory
to examine DEMO a negative outcome will lead
to a decline in trustworthiness. We reviewed
four causal ascriptions and examined the rele-
vant causal attribution dimensions for DEMO one.
We also considered the role of specific emotional
2009
reactions in this process. This analysis provides
deeper insight into the DEMO attributions after a
negative outcome has led to a decline in trust, as
well as some general insight into how those initial
attributions might be subsequently revised by the
violator in order to repair trust. Interestingly, much
of the prior research on trust repair has examined
the efficacy DEMO social accounts from the violator,
and we believe this offers a very fruitful founda-
tion for illustrating the specific attributional
mechanisms involved in DEMO damaged trust-
worthiness.
HOW SOCIAL ACCOUNTS CAN MANAGE
ATTRIBUTIONS
Given that the focus of this paper is on trust
repair, it is important to recall that initial judg-
ments of the trustee’s trustworthiness after a
negative DEMO are not always final—specific
attributions can be invalidated or modified as
additional information is received (Krull, 1993;
Weiner, 1985). Most of the prior research on the
dynamics of trust repair has examined the DEMO
cacy of certain types of social accounts from the
trustee after trust has been damaged (Kim et al.,
2004, 2006; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Schweitzer et
al., 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2004). Social accounts
are one type of reparative effort by the trustee
(Scott & Lyman, 1968; Tomlinson et al., 2004). We
contend that these accounts are effective be-
cause they revise damaged attributions after DEMO
negative outcome.
Specifically, we draw from Weiner’s (1986) at-
tribution DEMO to suggest how social accounts
might modify causal attributions to repair trust
after a negative outcome. It is important to note
here that the DEMO analysis developed in
this paper is applicable beyond understanding
the effect of social accounts on trust repair. It can
be applied as well to DEMO and predict the
effectiveness of substantive actions, such as pen-
ance DEMO hostage posting. Given space limitations
and the fact that social accounts have been used
in recent literature to study attempts at trust re-
pair, we focus on them as a vehicle to demonstrate
the insights that DEMO be gained from the current
attributional analysis.
Social psychologists have developed a vast
body of literature on how individuals attempt to
manage the impressions DEMO make on others.
Indeed, in interpersonal relationships actors of-
ten engage DEMO actions to “influence the defini-
Tomlinson and Mayer
97
tion of the situation which [the observer] come[s]
to have” (Goffman, 1959: 6). A significant portion
of work on this subject deals with social ac-
DEMO, or the ways in which individuals attempt
to shape the perceptions DEMO others following a
negative event (e.g., Cody & McLaughlin, 1990;DEMO
Goffman, 1971; Schlenker, 1980). When an indi-
vidual has DEMO another, potentially threat-
ening responses from the violated party may
result (e.g., a damaged reputation, reduced co-
operation, retaliation), thus creating a predica-
ment for the offender. The offender can respond
with “a DEMO account that attempts to correct
the audience’s initial perceptions of the situa-
tion” (Bies, 1987: 295; emphasis added).
The seminal work DEMO Scott and Lyman refers
to accounts as devices that provide a context for
apparently negative behavior in an effort to
“verbally bridge the gap DEMO action and
expectation” (1968: 46). Much work has examined
the use of accounts in the context of promoting a
sense of justice (Bies, 1987; Bobocel & Zdaniuk,
2003; Greenberg, 1990). DEMO adequate and
sincere explanations for negative events is as-
sociated with more favorable reactions (e.g.,
higher fairness perceptions, lower anger and
resentment) than when events are either not ex-
plained or explained inadequately (Bies & Sha-
piro, 1987; Shapiro, 1991). Given that accounts
can mitigate the detrimental effects of negative
behavior, it makes sense to understand the at-
tribution mechanisms through which they work.
This provides a basis DEMO understanding and
predicting which type of account is likely to be
most effective in repairing trust under which
particular circumstances.
Verbal communication by the DEMO frames
and shapes the victim’s interpretation of the
trust violation (Goffman, 1971), assisting the vic-
tim in cognitive sensemaking (Heider, 1958) and
shaping his or her perceptions of the offender’s
intentions and relevant DEMO information
(Mehlman & Snyder, 1985; Tedeschi & Riess,
1981; Weiner et al., 1987) by providing informa-
tion that would otherwise DEMO unavailable. Prior
research has established that exonerating ac-
counts for a negative outcome tend to be those
that assert that the cause has an DEMO locus
to the offender, is uncontrollable by the offender,
and/DEMO is due to an unstable (i.e., unlikely to
recur) cause (Weiner et al., 1987; Weiner,
Figueroa-Mun˜ oz, & Kakihara, DEMO).

This analysis allows us to consider DEMO vari-
ous types of social accounts may affect certain
causal attributions about the cause of a nega-
tive outcome, which ultimately determine the
success of a repair attempt. Scholars (Bies, 1987;
Cody & McLaughlin, 1990; Greenberg, 1990) have
provided useful typologies of social accounts
that individuals use when they are in a social
predicament and wish to DEMO their spoiled iden-
tity. Weiner (1995) examined how social accounts
may affect the receiver’s causal attributions for an
event. We consider four types DEMO social accounts—
denial, excuse, apology, and justification (Cody &
DEMO, 1990)—and then propose how trust-
worthiness and trust can be DEMO based on
how the use of each of these accounts attempts to
modify specific attribution dimensions and spe-
cific emotional reactions.
Accounts and Causal DEMO
In a denial, a trustee claims to not be respon-
sible DEMO the negative outcome because he or she
was not the perpetrator and therefore should not
be held accountable (Bies, 1987; Cody &
DEMO, 1990; Tedeschi & Norman, 1985).
Through a denial, a trustee may attempt to shift
blame elsewhere (Crant & Bateman, 1993), and
may even provide proof of innocence (Cody &
McLaughlin, DEMO). Denials declare that the
cause of the negative outcome is external to the
trustee (Weiner, 1986; Weiner et al., 1987; Weiner
et al., 1991). As discussed earlier, external attri-
butions for DEMO outcomes do not damage
trustworthiness, since the negative outcome is
not DEMO to be due to broken trust. A denial
asserts that the trustee’s ability, benevolence,
and integrity are intact and should not be im-
pugned.
Proposition 5: Denials that reduce in-
ternal attributions will repair trust-
worthiness.
An excuse also attempts to minimize one’s
responsibility for negative events (Bies, 1987).
The trustee asks not to be held accountable,
claiming that mitigating circumstances attenu-
ate his or her culpability (Cody & McLaughlin,
1990). Unlike a denial, the trustee admits a role
in the negative outcome but contends that he or
she is not DEMO responsible (Scott & Lyman,
1968). With respect to locus DEMO causality, Snyder
and Higgins (1988) describe excuses as shifting
causal DEMO for negative outcomes from
sources that are central to the person to sources
less central. Weiner et al. (1987) found that good,
DEMO excuses also communicate causes
for a negative outcome that are uncontrollable
by the excuse giver. Furthermore, Weiner et al.
(1991) concluded that exonerating excuses may
communicate unstable causes, such as “I forgot
the appointment.” Claiming a temporary lapse
in memory indicates that this is not a permanent
DEMO of affairs, and such excuses aim to
“change the other person’s DEMO that ‘the same
thing might happen again in the future’”
(Weiner DEMO al., 1991: 10).
An excuse thus alters attributions such that
the negative outcome’s cause is seen as more
external, uncontrollable, and/DEMO unstable
(Weiner, 1992), which should lead to repaired
trustworthiness. As developed earlier in the pa-
per, external attributions signal that the trust-
ee’s ability, benevolence, and integrity are in-
tact. Uncontrollable attributions attenuate
DEMO for a negative outcome, which re-
duces the negative effect on DEMO
Unstable attributions signal that the negative
outcome’s cause is not some permanent aspect
of trustworthiness.
Proposition 6: Excuses that reduce in-
ternal attributions, DEMO at-
tributions, and/or stability attributions
will repair trustworthiness.
Apologies attempt DEMO reframe the account
giver (Bies, 1987; Cody & McLaughlin, 1990) after
a negative outcome. They are confessions of re-
sponsibility, normally DEMO by an ex-
pression of remorse for the harm inflicted (Tede-
DEMO & Norman, 1985). Goffman (1971) claims that
an apology DEMO one is responsible for a
transgression but has learned a valuable lesson
never to repeat the offense. Accordingly, apolo-
gies explicitly acknowledge that the negative
outcome is internal and controllable but frame
the cause of that DEMO outcome as unstable
(i.e., unlikely to recur because the negative out-
come was caused by one who has reformed and
renounced untrustworthy behavior)DEMO Several
studies have supported the efficacy of apologies
in restoring trust or cooperation after a violation
under certain circumstances (Bottom, Gibson,
Daniels, & Murnighan, 2002; Kim et al., 2004,
2006; Tomlinson DEMO al., 2004).

Tomlinson and Mayer
A relevant application of Weiner’s (1986) the-
DEMO deals with forgiveness of transgressions in
relationships (Gold & Weiner, 2000; Takaku,
2001; Takaku, Weiner, & Ohbuchi, 2001). A sum-
mary of this work indicates that remorseful
apologies attempt to convey DEMO the victim of a
transgression that the cause of the transgres-
sion was unstable. In other words, a disposition-
ally “good” person did an uncharacteristically
“bad” thing that will not recur. Therefore, apol-
ogies convey that there is not enduring damage
to the trustee’s trustworthiness.
Proposition 7: Apologies that reduce
stability attributions will repair trust-
worthiness.
Finally, instead of lessening their responsibil-
ity, individuals may accept responsibility while
attempting to reframe their behavior as in ac-
cordance with some type of superordinate goal
or DEMO, or by providing a more positive inter-
pretation of the negative DEMO (Cody &
McLaughlin, 1990; Tedeschi & Norman, 1985; Te-
deschi & Riess, 1981). This type of account pro-
vides a justification (Cody & McLaughlin, 1990)
for behavior that is initially DEMO nega-
tively by pointing to reasons that it is legitimate
and consistent with moral values. As such, this
account “serves the purpose of making the ac-
tion seem less negative (or even positive)” (Cody
& McLaughlin, 1990: 230). Interestingly, this
would likely reverse the DEMO attributions
such that the outcome will be viewed as internal
to the trustee, controllable, and stable. Such at-
tributions for a (newly regarded) favorable out-
come should repair trustworthiness. That is, an
outcome that DEMO positive enhances trust-
worthiness to the extent that it is internal to and
controllable by the trustee and a stable aspect
of his or DEMO trustworthiness.
Proposition 8: Justifications that re-
duce the perceived negativity of DEMO
outcome will repair trustworthiness.
In summary, causal attributions mediate the
relationship DEMO social accounts and trust
repair.
Accounts and Specific Emotional Reactions
While we have discussed the effects of at-
tempts to repair trust in light DEMO Weiner’s attri-
bution dimensions, based on research on emo-
99
tions DEMO earlier, we suggest that the
effectiveness of attempts to repair trust DEMO be
attenuated by negative emotions that arise from
a trust violation. Thus, although much of the
focus of our attention in this paper has been on
the cognitive processing considered in attribu-
tion theory, research on how to manage the emo-
tions that arise from a trust violation DEMO clearly
warranted for a fuller understanding of how to
repair trust. Without it, a trustee who has dam-
aged trust might make positive moves to repair
trust only to find his or her efforts voided by
DEMO emotions.
If social accounts lead to revised attributions,
this should also alter the specific emotional re-
actions of anger and fear. For example, an ex-
cuse that the negative outcome was uncontrol-
lable should mitigate DEMO (Weiner, 1986, 2001).
Extensive apologies have been shown to DEMO
anger (Ohbuchi, Kameda, & Agarie, 1989), but
they should also reduce fear due to lower sta-
bility attributions (Weiner, 1986)DEMO Accordingly,
Proposition 4 states that a reduction in anger
and fear will allow for more effective repair of
trustworthiness and trust.
Summary
This DEMO analysis indicates that
there are several routes to trustworthiness re-
pair through the use of social accounts. Denials
attempt to shift attributions from being DEMO
to the trustee to being external. Excuses attempt
to facilitate external, DEMO, and/or un-
stable attributions for the cause of the negative
DEMO Denials and excuses pointing to exter-
nal/uncontrollable reasons repair trustworthi-
ness in the sense that they render a decline in
trustworthiness inappropriate. Apologies DEMO
tempt to repair trustworthiness by asserting that
the cause of the negative outcome is unstable
and, hence, unlikely to recur. Justifications at-
tempt DEMO repair trustworthiness by reducing the
perceived negativity of the outcome.
DISCUSSION OF THE THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK
In this paper we seek to answer calls for DEMO
on attribution processes explaining a broader
array of trust repair attempts with a model of
how trust is updated after a negative outcome
based DEMO Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory. Our

framework uses Weiner’s theory to specify DEMO
vant causal attribution dimensions and specific
emotional reactions that affect subsequent trust
after a negative outcome in the Mayer et al.
(1995) model. DEMO contend that there are several
contributions that can be gained from this anal-
ysis that build a solid foundation for effective
trust repair.
Prior DEMO has extensively relied on locus of
causality, but the roles of DEMO (1986) control-
lability and stability dimensions in understand-
ing trust decline and repair have not been de-
veloped. Furthermore, stability appears to be
particularly relevant and critical to trust repair,
since it is the DEMO attributional driver of future
expectations (Weiner, 1986). In order to trust
again, the trustor’s central concern revolves
around the prediction of how likely a future sim-
ilar violation will be (Tomlinson et al., DEMO).
The use of Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory
also facilitates analysis of negative outcomes
beyond causes due to the trustee’s competence
and integrity (Kim et al., 2004, 2006) to a consid-
eration of how benevolence and factors external
to the trustee come into play. This framework
DEMO also account for other forms of social ac-
counts beyond apology and denial, as well as
substantive reparative efforts (Ferrin et al.,
DEMO). For example, substantive penance (Bottom
et al., 2002) and hostage posting (Nakayachi &
Watabe, 2005) are actions (instead of accounts)
that likely convey that the cause of the negative
outcome DEMO unstable. Penance is a tangible sym-
bol of remorse from a reformed transgressor.
Similarly, a trustee who uses hostage posting
voluntarily agrees to sacrifice collateral if he or
she betrays trust in a future interaction. These
DEMO suggest that causal stability medi-
ates the relationship between the substantive
repair efforts and repaired trustworthiness.
By developing a deeper understanding of why
different DEMO of repair will be effective under
what conditions, our research enhances DEMO
ars’ understanding of these complexities. For
example, while Kim et al. DEMO apologies effec-
tive for repairing trust attributed to an unstable
ability attribution (i.e., knowledge of tax codes),
this paper suggests that the same result may not
be true if the violation is attributed to DEMO more
stable ability violation, such as a lack of suffi-
cient DEMO to understand the task com-
plexities. The current research provides not only
a deeper understanding of prior results but a
framework for insightful future DEMO
For example, if an outcome is unambiguously
negative and is due DEMO the trustee’s volition, it is
unlikely that denials or justifications will DEMO
effective. Furthermore, recent research has sug-
gested that providing external and DEMO
ble accounts is not exonerating when the trans-
gressor is in a position of high status (Lee,
Peterson, & Tiedens, 2004; DEMO & Robinson, 2000;
Lee & Tiedens, 2001). High-status individuals are
expected to be able to control outcomes, so an
account claiming an external and uncontrolla-
ble cause may violate the receiver’s role expec-
DEMO and/or may not be deemed credible. In
these cases stability attributions may be the
most critical to understand, since they become
the only viable causal attribution dimension to
manage. In addition, Weiner (1985) argues that
stability attributions are the primary driver of
future expectations. Consistent with DEMO, Tom-
linson et al. (2004) found that a victim’s assess-
DEMO of the probability of a future violation pre-
dicts the individual’s willingness to reconcile
with the offender. Surprisingly, prior work on
trust repair has virtually neglected the stability
construct.
Weiner’s (1986) theory also explicates specific
DEMO reactions in the attribution process by
showing how causal attribution dimensions
lead to specific emotional reactions (anger and
fear) and how these emotions DEMO subsequent
trustworthiness and trust. Although some re-
searchers have discussed emotions as relevant
in trust decline and repair (Lewicki & Bunker,
1996; DEMO & Weigert, 1985), the trust literature
has tended to focus DEMO cognitive factors. This
has prompted calls for more work explaining the
role of emotions (Jones & George, 1998), as pro-
vided in DEMO paper.
Several implications can be derived from this
framework. First, causal DEMO dimensions
suggest how trust can be repaired, as indicated
by different DEMO efforts working through
different dimensions of attributions. Postdecline
trust can be repaired when the trustee’s attribu-
tions regarding the outcome’s cause are altered.
Stated DEMO, trust can be repaired when
the past (i.e., the cause DEMO the negative outcome
and ensuing sense of violation) is resolved. Spe-
DEMO, both what was damaged and how it
was damaged imply the DEMO of reparative effort
needed. This may explain why implicit apolo-
2009
Tomlinson and Mayer
101
gies that attempt to placate the trustor DEMO
“smooth over” the violation do not stimulate rec-
onciliation (Tomlinson et DEMO, 2004).
Another implication is that it is important for a
DEMO in the wake of trust decline to be at-
tributed to internal and controllable causes. Vo-
litional efforts to repair trust are more likely DEMO
be seen as genuine evidence of instability of the
cause of a negative outcome, whereas “forced”
apologies in response to media pressure are
unlikely to signal true repentance, remorse, and
reform, which are critical to the unstable attri-
butions important to trust repair (Gold & Weiner,
2000).
While much can be gained by using Weiner’s
(1986) DEMO attribution theory to understand
trust decline and repair, we acknowledge sev-
DEMO limitations of this work that should prompt
future research. First, while DEMO theory ac-
knowledges various influences on causal attri-
butions, such as DEMO social context, prior history
of the relationship, and attribution biases, DEMO
does not articulate these influences. To be par-
simonious, we have DEMO developed proposi-
tions on the process of how attribution dimen-
sions relate to trust decline and repair. Based on
Weiner’s attribution theory, our model implicitly
acknowledges that an individual’s attributional
biases (e.g., fundamental attribution error) may
influence the proposed relationships in substan-
tive ways. Future work needs DEMO address this
limitation, since such factors are believed to
influence trust (Mo¨ llering, 2006).
One of the major purposes of our research was
to use Weiner’s attribution theory to develop an
understanding of how DEMO and trust
are updated after a negative outcome as a plat-
form for determining effective repair efforts. We
considered the effect of each of DEMO attri-
bution dimensions, as well as some of the inter-
actions. DEMO example, regardless of attributions
of controllability and stability, an attribution of
external locus of control means the cause is
unrelated to the trustee. DEMO this means trust
in that trustee is not damaged, trust repair DEMO
moot. While consideration of each possible in-
teraction among the three attribution dimen-
sions was beyond the scope of this paper, future
research in this area may prove fruitful. Like-
wise, based on Weiner’s attribution theory, our
model implicitly acknowledges that an individ-
ual’s attributional biases (e.g., fundamental at-
tribution error) may influence the proposed rela-
tionships in substantive ways. We believe
future research could provide valuable insights
into this matter.
DEMO developed our analysis around social ac-
counts, but such responses may DEMO less than
optimal, especially if they are interpreted as an
attempt DEMO look trustworthy instead of to be trust-
worthy (cf. Greenberg, 1990). Many have criti-
cized accounts as “cheap talk”— costless to the
DEMO and unverifiable (Farrell & Rabin, 1996).
Future work should continue to examine sub-
stantive means of influencing attributions in the
wake of DEMO decline in trust (Bottom et al., 2002;
Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005), as well as how
those other techniques interact with accounts.
Finally, the notions of reconciliation and for-
giveness are only beginning to be studied in the
organizational sciences (e.g., Aquino et al.,
DEMO). More work is needed in this area, and
important questions DEMO that are not directly
addressed in this research. What is the role of
time in the attributional process? Does time heal
all wounds, DEMO does the passage of time make
injuries from negative outcomes seem less sa-
lient? Conversely, are there types of transgres-
sions that are DEMO likely to “fester” with time? In
what ways does the severity DEMO the offense or mag-
nitude of the negative outcome affect attributions
and willingness to forgive and reconcile?
In conclusion, Weiner’s (1986) causal attribu-
tion theory provides important conceptual
mechanisms (causal attributions, specific emo-
DEMO reactions) that clarify the process of trust
decline and repair. Per DEMO and Bunker’s
call, it provides a useful “blueprint for action”
(1996: 137) to stimulate a deeper understanding
of trust repair.
