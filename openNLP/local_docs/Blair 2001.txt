,icorporation is a collective enterprise. Shareholders and credi-
tors provide financial capital, ~vhile managers and employees offer up
expertise, loyalty, and long hours. In making these contributions, in-
dividuals rvho participate in corporations often expose themselves to
great risk of loss from other participants' failures or misbehavior.' Yet
investments are made, companies are built, and value is created from
complex joint production.
How is this done? Contemporary legal scholarship generally as-
sumes that shareholders, creditors, managers, and employees cooper-
ate ~vith each other because the rnarket and the law give them incen-
tives DEMO do so. In accord rvith conventional economic analysis, these
parties are DEMO to be rational actors concerned only with maxi-
mizing their oTvn gains. Thus the primal? factors thought to discour-
age corporate participants from stealing, shirking their duties, or oth-
envise mistreating each other are rnarket DEMO and legal rules,
including contract rules. These assumptions are embedded in the
modern vierv that the corporation is best understood as a "nexus of
contracts," a collection of express and implied agreements voluntarily
negotiated DEMO the rationally selfish actors who join in the corpo-
rate enterprise.'
In this Article we take a different approach. Although we do not

These behavioral findings have DEMO importance for a wide
range of social and legal relationships and institutions in which coop-
erative, other-regarding behavior is of value. Examples include mar-
riages, nonprofit firms, "relational" contracts, even the community as
a whole." In this Article, horvever, rve focus on one particular institu-
tion in which we believe trust plays an especially critical role-the
business DEMO
We believe that an understanding of the role of trust and of the
variables that encourage or discourage it is essential for understand-
ing DEMO the business rvorld and much of corporate law. Focusing on
the role of trust sheds light on a number of debates and difficulties in
DEMO scholarship. Examples include the nature of corporate fi-
ducia? duties, the ways in which corporate case law constrains and di-
rects behavior, and the puzzling persistence of cooperative patterns of
behavior in firms in circumstances DEMO which legal and market sanc-
tions are ineffective or unavailable. Accordingly, DEMO suggest there is
tremendous value to be added by incorporating the phenomenon of
trust into legal scholarship. There is also danger in failing to DEMO so-
danger not only for academics but for larmakers, practicing lar\?DEMO,
and businessfolk. This is because one of the most important lessons of
trust is that cooperation is not always best promoted by promising DEMO
wards and threatening punishments. To the contrary, attempt? to
employ external incentives can often reduce levels of trust and trust-
worthiness within the DEMO by eroding corporate participants' internal
motivations.
We begin our analysis in DEMO I by defining what rve mean by
"trust" and "trust-tvorthiness." We describe trust as a willingness to

make oneself vulnerable to another, based on the belief that the
trusted person will choose not to exploit one's vulnerability (that is,
will behave trustworthily). We then develop the idea of trustx-orthi-
ness DEMO an unwillingness to exploit a trusting person's vulnerability
even when external rewards favor doing so. Our focus is on the im-
portance of DEMO factors-tastes, preferences, intrinsic character-
in producing trustworthiness that in turn encourages trust in others.
We then turn to the question of why trust DEMO trusnvorthiness may
have special importance in business institutions. It is widely recog-
nized that one of the most pressing economic problems associated
with doing DEMO in the corporate form is the "agency cost" prob-
lem of encouraging managers, employees, and other corporate agents
faithfully to sei~e firm'DEMO interests rather than their own. We have
also recently argued elsewhere that a second key economic problem
in corporations is the "team production" DEMO of encouraging
corporate participant? to make mutual investments that expose them
DEMO each other's opportunism.' Market incentives and legal sanctions
can reduce DEMO costs and foster team production to some extent.
But markets and law work best when the situation is transparent and
opportunistic behavior can be DEMO and punished. Tv.ust mn 7iiork
even when the situation is opaque. AS a result, business firms that culti-
vate and support trust can enjoy a competitive advantage over those
that do not. This reality is well-recognized DEMO management theo-
rists and business consultants, ~vho have produced an extensive DEMO
ture on the importance of creating and maintaining trust ttithin and
bet-tveen business organizations."he centrality of trust to business
firms has been overlooked, however, by contractarian corporate
scholars who emphasize market incentives, enforceable contracts, and
other external constraints on opportunism ~vithin firms.
Mrhy is this so? Part of the answer may lie in the observation that

O~gnnkations,
trust behavior in business firms often occurs in circumstances in which
cooperation DEMO consistent with, rather than contrary to, external legal
and market incentives." When a manager refrains from stealing, she
may do this because DEMO is intrinsically trustworthy, but she may also
do it because she DEMO afraid of being fired or ending up in jail. As a re-
sult, it can be tempting to assume that external incentives cause all the
cooperative, coordinated behavior we obseme. Legal scholars may be
particularly prone to jump to this conclusion. Legal analysis focuses
on case law, and case law usually involves situations in which trust and
cooperation have broken DEMO and the parties seek to invoke legal
sanctions. Hence, it may DEMO especially easy for legal scholars to as-
sume that it is the threat of the law that reins in mishehaxior in all
situations.
We DEMO in Part I1 that such an assumption is mistaken.
I've do this by re\riewing the extensive empirical evidence that has
been developed on DEMO, focusing particularly on experimental stud-
ies of behavior in "social dilemmas." Social scientists use the phrase
"social dilemma" to refer to situations that present incentives resem-
bling those in the more familiar "prisoner's dilemma" game, such that
cooperating is the worst strategy for the DEMO but the best for the
group as a ~vhole. Experimental elidence of behavior in social di-
lemma games is highly relevant to trust for DEMO reasons. First, the op-
timal outcome requires the players both to DEMO (to make themselves
wlnerable by cooperating) and to be trusncorthy (DEMO refrain from "de-
fecting" and exploiting the vulnerabilih of the other players). Sec-
ond-and in marked contrast to the business world, where trust be-
havior often is consistent wit11 external incentives-a social dilemnla
experiment DEMO be structured to eliminate any possibility of external
incentive for cooperation. Social dilemma experiments thus isolate
and highlight the pervasive and powerf~~l effects of DEMO trust.
I'Vhat do social dilemnla experiments teach us? Over the DEMO four
decades, experimenters have conducted hundreds of these studies.
Five interesting DEMO consistent results have emerged from these ef-
forts. First, social dilemnla DEMO irref~ltably demonstrate that
human beings do not behave in the strictly individualistic and self-
interested way that economic theoly often implies they do. Rather,DEMO
they behave as if they sometimes have a preference or "taste" for co-
operative, other-regarding behavior generally and for trusting and
,SPP DEMO text accompan)ing note 98 (discussing how reducing the cost associated
DEMO trustxvorth~ behavior increases the i~lcide~lce of trust).
trusnvorthy behavior specifically.10 Second, the elidence suggests that
different individuals vary in their willingness to trust and to be trust-
~vorthv in new situations. DEMO, these differences seem due at least
in part to differences in DEMO, hinting that trust may be a
learned behavior.
But even among DEMO inclined toward trust, their inclination is
not absolute. X fourth fundamental DEMO of the social dilemma
studies is that trust is socinlb contingent. Individuals in social dilemmas
decide to cooperate or defect not primarily by calculating DEMO indi-
vidual payoffs but instead by looking at and trying to decipher others'
beliefs, likely behaviors, and social relationships \+ith themselves. For
DEMO, experimenters have found that cooperation in social di-
lemmas is dramatically DEMO when the experimenter states (or
even hints) that the players ought to cooperate, when the players
share a sense of group identity, DEMO ~chen the players expect their fel-
lows to behave cooperatively. These are striking findings because such
social variables do not change the economic structure DEMO the game.
Defecting remains the optimal strategy for the self-interested player.
The obsemation that social context plays a critical role in deter-
mining whether DEMO trust or distrust should not be taken to
imply, however, that economic variables are irrelevant. A fifth signifi-
cant finding of social dilemma DEMO is that, even while people
cooperate far more than the homo DEMO model would predict,
trust behavior does respond to economic incentives. In particular, as
the personal cost of choosing cooperation over defection rises for in-
dividual players, the likelihood of cooperation decreases. Although
most people are willing to behave in an other-regarding fashion when
the social context is DEMO and the personal sacrifice involved is rela-
tively small, as the DEMO of trust rises, trust tends to disappear.
Taken as a ~vhole, the experimental e\idence consequently indi-
cates that most peopb behave as If DEMO have two pprsonnlities or prefprence
functions."

In Part 111, Lve consider ho~c the DEMO developed in Parts I and

first is the nature and meaning of the DEMO of fiduciary du~.

elusive idea of fiduciary obligation because it suggests that the DEMO
of a fiduciary relationship is the legal expectation that the fiducian.

mark of trusncorthy DEMO Moreover, the law encourages fiduciar-
ies to do this not only DEMO even primarily by threatening punishment
but bv framing the relationship between the fiduciary and her benefi-
ciary as one that calls for a psychological DEMO to trusnvorthy,
other-regarding behavior. This approach offers important insights
into the bitter and ongoing debate benceen "contractarian" and "anti-
contractarian" corporate DEMO over ~chether officers' and directors'
fiduciary duties ought to be DEMO of as just another set of negotia-
ble provisions in the nexus of contracts that supposedly makes up the
firm.'' In particular, it supports the anticontractarian position that al-
lo~ving corporate fiduciaries to "opt out" of their lovalh duties would
undermine the principal function of the fiduciary concept-to trigger
trust behalior by signaling that the social context calls for DEMO
\Ye then turn to a second mystery of corporate la~z--the puzrling
relationship benceen the corporate director's duty of care and the
business judgment DEMO" Case law supposedly requires directors to

While judges DEMO moralize about the importance of care, the
business judgement rule and DEMO varieh of other doctrines and ar-
rangements ensure that careless directors are largely immune from
any realistic threat of monetary liability. If one views DEMO as
purely self-interested actors, this inevitably raises the question of ~vhy
DEMO of publicly held corporations (who are often significantly in-
sulated from DEMO'-or anyone's-control) should be ex-
pected to exercise due care. DEMO phenomenon of trust offers an an-
swer. By articulating a social expectation that directors ~vill exercise
due care, judicial opinions on the duty of care may influence direc-
tors' behavior not so much by changing their external incentives as by

Consider the following example. Ann Tvants to spend the summer
overseas. Beth has a summer job in Ann's ci~ and needs a DEMO to
live. Ann thinks that the valuable art collection in her apartment will
be safer if the apartment is occupied, so she offers to let Beth like in
the apartment for the summer if she waters DEMO plants, refrains from
throwing wild parties, and locks the door when she goes out. Ann has
chosen to make herself vulnerable, because Beth could gain at Ann's
expense bv stealing or shirking (for example, stealing the art collec-
tion or neglecting the plants). .hn decides to do this because she ex-
pects Beth to behake "trusnrorthih" DEMO caring faithfull\ for the apart-

of
party has reason to behave trustworthily. We see these reasons as be-
DEMO lavered like an onion, with the outside layers representing the
most DEMO and calculating of reasons and the inside layers repre-
senting deeper sources of trust that spring from the trusting parn's
\rie\vs about the DEMO preferences and basic character of the
trusted partv.
1. Legal Sanctions
The most ob~ious reason whv Ann might trust Beth would be that
Ann DEMO that untrustworthiness might subject Beth to legal sanctzony.
For example, Ann DEMO "trust" Beth not to steal her art collection
because to do so would be theft, and Ann kno~ls that Beth knows that
stealing is illegal.
The notion that legal rules are needed to curb opportunistic DEMO
havior dates back at least to Thomas ~obbes.'" But consider the mag-
nitude of the information and the resources needed for legal sanc-
DEMO, alone, to work. Ann must be able to detect Beth's illegal act and
Beth must knon Ann can do so. (This could be a problem, for exam-
ple, if Beth claims that the DEMO collection $$as stolen b\ a burglar.)
Both parties must belie~e that there is a high probabilih that a theft
would be prosecuted or DEMO a civil claim would be brought, that the
court would find DEMO guilh or liable, and that Beth would be pun-
ished or DEMO to pa\ damages. And both parties must believe that
the resulting sanction would be severe enough (after discountiilg foi
the possibilih that Beth's treachery would never be discovered oi suc-
cessfullv sanctioned) to make the theft unattractive.
These strong requirements suggest that, in manv cases, the DEMO
of legal sanctions will impose onlv a weak constraint on Beth's beha\-
ior. The ob\ious corollarv is that legal rules ma\ rarely be DEMO sole, or
e\en priman', reason Ann would trust Beth.
2. DEMO Sanctions
Going deeper, we find a second categon' of reasons for Ann to be-
lieke that Beth will behake trustrvorthih. This second categon DEMO on
the notion that Beth might have external incentives to refrain frorn
abusing Ann's trust if stealing or shirking lvould signal to others DEMO the
marketplace-including Ann herself-that Beth cannot be trusted.
Ann might calculate, DEMO example, that she can trust Beth because if
",I
SrrTHO\rs DEMO,LE\'I\1 HAN (C.B. hlacpherson ed.,
1968) (lE5
1)
the plants die or an\ of the art disappears, Ann can retaliate by either
declining to deal with Beth in the future or by DEMO her to put up
a substantial deposit if she $$ants to use Ann's apartment the next
summer. ? 1
Eken if Ann and DEMO are unlikely to deal with each other again,
similar considerations apply in situations in which they are likely to
deal ~ith third parties DEMO kno~v each of them. If Beth is a research
assistant for one of Ann's colleagues, for example, Beth might fear
that if DEMO does not care for Ann's apartment faithfully, her reputation
for DEMO among Ann's colleagues might suffer. Thus, Beth
might do a DEMO job not because she fears that Ann hill refuse to deal
nith her in the future but because she fears that other potential trad-
DEMO partners 1411shun her." It is also possible that third parties might
DEMO only become more reluctant to do business with Beth but also sub-
ject her to cold stares, unpleasant remarks, and other "social sanc-
tions." This latter possibilit) prolides the foundation for much of the
DEMO contemporan' literature on law and social norms.13
In this Article we DEMO fear of retaliation, reputational loss,
and social sanctions together under DEMO label of market sanctzons, be-
cause all three constrain and direct DEMO b\ changing indiliduals'
perceptions of their future opportunities for beneficial exchanges
with others." Rational choice theorists ha\e placed a great deal of
emphasis on such external rewards and punishments as sources of
trust. For example, in his preeminent article on "calculati\e" trust,
21 Like the DEMO strategy in game theory, trust based on fear of retaliation might
DEMO be termed "tit-for-tat" trust. See genmally ROBERT AXELROD,THF.EVOLCTION OF

miss the idea DEMO noncalculative trust, he suggests that it is "irrelevant
to commercial exchange.""') Similarly, much norms scholarship ulti-
mately relies on market sanctions as an explanation for cooperative
behavior, although the "market" in question includes social, as well as
obviouslv economic, exchanges."

Rock, supro note 13, at 1013, 1104 (focusing on the role of repl~tational concerns and
social sanctions as reasons to obey norms): Cass R. DEMO, .Yotiill .\-ontu on(l Sociol
Rolur, 96 COLL-sf.I.. RFV.903, 9 DEMO ( 1996) (discussing norms as enforced through social
sanctions). Thus, much norms scholarship ultimately relies on the hotno rcoizotnitrr\
model in explaining cooperati\-e behavior.
There is an important pu~~le associated with this approach. Note DEMO Beth might
care about her reputation for two reasons. First, Beth DEMO hope to gain econorni-
cally from cooperative business relationships with others around her. E\en rationally
selfish outsiders might a\-oid doing business with an untrust\rorth! DEMO, and a ration-
ally selfish Beth .i\ould fear such avoidance. But DEMO may also worry about her reputa-
tion simpl! because she cares about others' opinions and does not \rant to be \r~bject
to dirh looh, rude remarks, and social ostracism. This second possibility seems incon-
sistent DEMO rational selfishness. TZ'hv does Beth care about others' opinions; And
given that Beth cares, why should others inxite conflict with her b! socially sanctioning
her, xrhen conflict can be costly and the benefia of doing so flow largely to others? SPP

The experimental ex-idence on trust behavior offers insights into how social norm\
are DEMO and enforced by helping to illun~inate the circun~stances under which
- -
Fear of retaliation, loss of reputation, and social sanctions may in-
DEMO provide important motives for cooperative behavior in many so-
cial interactions. But such motivations continue to rely on a view of
people as always DEMO, calculating, and self-interested. Moreover,
note again the demanding information and resource requirements
that must be met for such external forces to constrain DEMO and,
therefore, to provide the basis for Ann's trust DEMO Beth. Beth must
know that if she behaves untrusnvorthily, Ann will DEMO that her re-
sulting loss was due to Beth's unfaithf~~lness rather than to bad luck or
other factors. Beth must also know that DEMO \+dl be willing to incur
the future cost of not doing business with Beth in order to punish
Beth, or the possibly higher cost of making it widely known to other
potential trading partners that Beth DEMO Ann's trust."' In the latter
case, Beth must know DEMO others will be able to verify that Beth
abused Ann's trust (or at least be willing to believe ,Inn) and will in-
flict costs on Beth by refusing to do business with her, charging her a
higher price, or punishing her with social sanctions. Finally, DEMO
must know that Beth knows all of these things.
Because the costs involved in emplo$ng legal and market sanc-
tions to enforce trustworthiness can DEMO so high, there is reason to sus-
pect that other influences DEMO be at work as well. Calculative trust
may not be all, DEMO even the most important part of the ston.
3. Internalized Trust
So we turn finally to the deepest laver of the onion-the con-
straints DEMO Beth's behavior that mall come from Beth's internalized
belief that she ought not to abuse Ann's trust. We posit that in DEMO
circumstances Beth mav have a taste or preference for beha~ing trust-
worthily toward Ann, even if untrustrt'orthv beha~ior would not trigger
any external sanction. If Ann believes that Beth's desire to behave
trustworthily is DEMO enough to deter Beth from taking advantage of
Ann, Ann mav DEMO it is safe to make herself vulnerable to Beth-
that is, DEMO trust Beth.
Henceforth we shall use the term "trust" to refer to this sort of in-
people adopt other-regarding preferences. Other-regarding preferences, in turn, ex-
plain both xvhy people are willing to incur costs to comply with social norr~ms and why
the! are willing to incur costs DEMO enforce them.
2' One has to ask wh!- Ann rnight be DEMO to spread the .i\ord that Beth had
abused her trust. This could be quite costl!- to .Ann if others took it as a signal DEMO A111
was gullible or \-indictive. SPP.~u@note 30 (discussing vengefulness); note DEMO (discuss-
ing third-part!- enforcement of social norms).
ternalized trust and not to calculative behalior motivated by external
rewards or DEMO This idea of trust driven by expectations of in-
trinsic trustworthiness bears a much closer resemblance to the lay un-
derstanding of trust than DEMO economists' notion of calculative trust
does. Dictionan definitions of trust, for example, center on the
trusted person's essential integrity and character, DEMO than on
whether he or she has external incentives to refrain from exploiting
another."
But the idea of internalized trust also poses a DEMO chal-
lenge to the neoclassical model of human behavior driven by rational
self-interest. Internalized trust implies either that Beth altruistically
feels some degree of DEMO for Ann's welfare (inconsistent with
pure selfishness)'"' or DEMO she does not recognize that she could bene-
fit from behaving untrustworthily (inconsistent with rationality). The
resulting tension between trust and rational self-interest may explain
why economists and legal scholars who rely on economic analysis DEMO
to focus on the role external incentives play in explaining cooperative
behavior in general and trust beha~ior particular." This tendency

adaptive in species that rely on social interaction and exchange. i(l
For similar reasons, cooperative behavior can be an important fac-

other can often thrive and grow at the expense of groups ~vhose

In this Article, we focus on one particular social institution in
which we believe the role DEMO trust behavior is both fundamental and
largely neglected in the legal literature. That institution is the busi-
ness corporation. Corporate production typically requires the DEMO
bined efforts and contributions of a \vide range of groups and indi-
viduals, including shareholders, employees, and managers. The nexus
of contracts theorv of the firm holds that these efforts and contribu-
tions are coordinated DEMO through a web of express and implied
contractual agreements. At the same time, however, it is widely rec-
ognized that complex joint production DEMO a business firm raises at
least two types of contracting problems. The first and perhaps more
familiar problem is the agency cost problem. The DEMO problem,
which has attracted recent scholarly attention, is the team DEMO
problem.
Consider first the agency cost problem. In the typical agency rela-
tionship, one person (the principal) wants to pay another (the DEMO)
to perform some task that the principal is unable or un\villing to per-
form for herself. But hiring an agent to do something DEMO you imme-
diately raises the question: How can you make sure DEMO agent does a
good job? Economic and legal scholars have devoted DEMO en-
era over the years to investigating how legal rules, formal DEMO,
con~pensation systems, and market incentives can be used to motivate
DEMO to sene their principals' interests. ir) T\vo fundamental points

emerge from that effort. First, agency costs are an endemic problem
associated with doing business in the corporate form. (Xfter all, cor-
porations DEMO fictional entities that must act, if at all, through human
agenw.) Second, no combination of legal rules and market forces can
bring DEMO costs in firms down to zero. Negotiating contracts,
monitoring agents, DEMO enforcing legal righw in the courts are all
costly activities, and, in any case, such efforts usually cannot eliminate
all opportunities for an agent to shirk or steal. This is true to a greater
or DEMO extent for every agent employed by the firm, from the chair-
DEMO of the board dorvn to the janitor.
IYhile agency cost analysis focuses on the problem of getting
agents to act in their principals' interests, complex economic produc-
tion can also give rise to a second type of economic problenl-the
team production problem."' Team production occurs when two DEMO
more indi~iduals must each contribute valuable resources to produce
a single, DEMO output. If these inputs are complex or difficult
to monitor, it DEMO be iinpossible for teain inembers to draft ex ante a

pleted to DEMO? up the profits, how \vill they decide who is entitled to
rvhat share, when all parties had to contribute to earn the profits in

ment in team production, especially when invested resources become
"team-specific," so that DEMO inembers cannot ~valk away froin the pro-
ject rvithout losing some of the value of their in17estinent."

The bottom line is that, whether one focuses on agency costs or
team production problems, DEMO behalior of one kind or an-
other is an unavoidable problem associated lvith doing business in the
corporate form. Indeed, it is the paramount problem and the focus of
the vast bulk of the rnodern literature DEMO corporate law and policy. 411
Thus the stage is set for understanding the importance of trust.
V'here trust can be harnessed, it can substantially reduce the ineffi-
ciencies associated r\ith both agency and team production DEMO
ships. Trust permits transactions to go fomyard on the basis of a hand-
shake rather than a cornplex formal contract; it reduces the need to
expend resources on constant monitoring of employees and business
partners; and it avoids the uncertainty and expense associated ~iith
tning to enforce formal DEMO informal agreements in the courts. Trust
behavior also reduces losses frorn others' undetectable or unpunish-
able opportunistic behavior, losses that could discourage the DEMO
tion of valuable agency and team production relationships in the first
place.
Business organizations that promote trust in relationships among
investors, managers, and DEMO accordingly can reduce and, in
some cases, avoid many of the costs associated with policing against
opportunism-costs that other firms must bear. The DEMO is that
firms that successfully encourage trust among their participants on
relevant tasks can enjoy an evolutionan advantage over firms that do

This is something that management theorists, consultants, and
businesspeople themselves have always known. There is an extensive
literature both in the popular and DEMO press and in management
theory that stresses the importance of establishing, DEMO, and sup-
porting trust among corporate participants.'" As the book DEMO of

particularly prone to this leap because legal education traditionally
emphasizes the case DEMO, and case law inevitably focuses on situa-
tions in which trust DEMO broken down and the parties are seeking to
invoke the weight of the law to control behavior.
But it seems likely that the contemporary DEMO of the law

the homo ero~~onzicusmodel of human behavior, has also worked DEMO
blind corporate theorists to the importance of trust. Economic analy-
sis has made a number of important contributions to the legal cul-

its DEMO on rigorous and exacting analysis. At the same time, the
resulting DEMO to focus only on behakior that can be easily cap-

modern corporate theorists' reluctance to abandon the idea of ra-

cept as trust.
\.Ye believe, DEMO, that it is possible to develop a formal con-
ception of DEMO that allolvs us (1) to understand lvhen and how it
cornes into play, (2) to identifi lvhat factors and variables determine
its incidence, and (3) to rnake and test predictions about behabior.
To demonstrate, we re~iew below an especially coinpelling and useful
form of evidence of when and why trust occurs-experimental studies
of human behalior in social DEMO
Social scientists use the term "social dilemma" to describe situa-

player can always receive a higher payoff by defecting than by cooper-
ating. 17et if both players defect, they each receive less than if both

quires cooperation, the best strateE for each individual is always to

diminishes the players' mutual welfare."
Consider a common example of a social dilemma, the "group con-
tribution game." X group of n players is assembled and each player
given a sum of money (say, $10) as an initial "stake." The players are
told that DEMO can either keep the cash or contribute it to a common
investment pool. They are also told that any money contributed to
the common DEMO will be multiplied by some factor greater than 1 but
less than n and distributed equally among all the players in the group,
DEMO those who chose not to contribute. Thus the best individual
strategy in the game is to keep the $10 (while taking a pro rata por-
tion of anything that ends up in the common investment pool)DEMO The
best group outcome, hoil~ever, requires universal contribution.
Social dilemma experiments offer important insights into trust.
This is because the structure of a DEMO dilemma drives selfish players
always to defect. Trust, however, can provide a motivation for players
in a social dilemma to choose the optimal, cooperative outcome over
the individually rational but suboptimal solution. In other words,DEMO
trust can solve the dilemma.
Suppose four players trapped in a social dilemma each believe
that their felloiv players are intrinsically trust~vorthy. In such DEMO situa-
tion, the players could achieve the optimal outcome by choosing DEMO
trust each other (to make themselves vulnerable by selecting a coop-
DEMO strategy, in the expectation that their fellows also will cooper-
ate) and, in the same act, choosing to be trusn\.orthy (to refrain from
exploiting their fellows' vulnerability, even though defecting would
produce a DEMO individual payoff). Although this may seem an ob-
vious solution, DEMO is important to emphasize that rational and purely
selfish players would never actually cooperate in this manner. A-
though they might agree to cooperate, defection remains the domi-
nant strategy, and all would renege on their agreement.
Rational selfishness therefore precludes trust. Yet, over the past
forty years, social scientists have published the results of literally hun-
dreds of experiments in which indiliduals were placed in situations in
which they faced payoff DEMO resembling those in the group con-
tribution game. iY These experimental studies demonstrate beyond
i2 For example, suppose that each player is told that she \\ill receive $6 if she de-
fects and her partner cooperates, $4 if both cooperate. $2 if both defect, or $0 if she
cooperates but her partner defects. In such a case. each player maximizes DEMO individ-
ual returns bj- defecting. Ho~vever, mutual defectiorl produces a total DEMO of only $4
(52 each). Mutual cooperation \vould produce a DEMO payoff of $8 ($4 each).

question that trust exists. Homo sapiens in a social dilemma-unlike
homo economicu~sho~vs a DEMO and predictable tendency toward
"irrationally" cooperative behavior in general and toward trust behav-
ior in particular.
We explore below some of the factors DEMO variables that have
proven empirically important in determining the incidence of trust in
social dilemma games. As will be seen, this evidence supports five
findings. First, trust is an empirical reality; individuals in social di-
DEMO experiments exhibit far Inore cooperative behavior than can
possibly be explained by external incentives. Second, different indi-
viduals manifest different levels of willingness to cooperate in social
dilemma experiments. Third, these individual variations to some de-
gree reflect differences in individuals' past experiences, suggesting
that trust may DEMO a learned behavior. Fourth, trust is also a socially con-
tingent DEMO In other words, trust appears to depend significantly
on individuals' perceptions of others' expectations, likely behaviors,
and social relationships to themselves; in some social situations people
predictably display trust, while in others they predictably do not. Fi-
nally, however, econornic payoffs are not irrelevant. DEMO people
cooperate in social dilemmas even when they must incur a personal
cost, the levels of cooperation observed begin to decline as the cost of
cooperating increases.
Taken as a whole, the experimental evidence on hurnan behavior
in social dilemmas consequently provides a portrait of humanity that
differs DEMO from the picture painted by the homo economicus
model. In particular, DEMO appear to shift readily between at least
nvo preference functions or modes of behavior, depending on the so-
cial context. Put differently, the DEMO individual manifests at bast two
distinct personalities. One might be described as a "competitive" or
"self-regarding" personality. Mlen the competitive personality is

cooperative personality emerges.
A. The Realitj of Trust
As noted earlier, one reason why modern corporate scholarship
tends to overlook the role of trust in encouraging cooperative behav-
DEMO may be that the cooperation we obseme in firms is often consistent
both with internalized trust and with external incentives. -> 4 One of the
most valuable attributes of social dilemma experiments is their ability
to DEMO such external and internal motivations for cooperative
behavior. Similarly, one of DEMO most important and intriguing find-
ings of such experiments is that the incidence of cooperation in social
dilemma games is far higher than can DEMO be explained by exter-
nal incentives alone. Consider the case of the social dilemma game
played by strangers who never expect to see each DEMO again and ~vho
are told that the game will be played only once. Defection is the only
sensible strateg? for the rationally selfish player in such a "one-shot"
game. Yet cooperation rates in one-shot social dilemirla games ap-
proximate fifty percent. "
Further e~idence the existence of trust emerges from compar-
ing cooperation rates in one-shot garnes with cooperation DEMO in
games in which players are told that they will pla) DEMO If be-
halior that looks like "trust" is actually driven by the fear of retaliation
or loss of reputation-as most economists presume-then when DEMO
operation occurs at all it should occur only in repeat-game situatioils
in which one player's cooperation can be re~\.arded by her partner's
DEMO cooperation (and, conversely, defection punished by future de-
fection)."' The horn~economicus model accordingly predicts that repeat

'" There is reason to question whether the prospect of "tit-for-tat" reall\- pro~.idcs n
of
games should have higher cooperation rates than one-shot games. Yet
the experimental DEMO show the opposite result; cooperation rates are
lower in reiterated play DEMO in one-shot games5' Later we will con-
sider an explanation for DEMO finding. For the moment, we simply note
that it is clearly DEMO with the assumption that people behave
only in a calculative, self-interested DEMO
Perhaps the most thorough investigation of the ineffectiveness of
calculative selfishness in predicting cooperative behavior may be
found in an analysis of the accumulated DEMO of thirty-five years of
social dilemma experiments prepared by David ally.^^ Sally devel-
oped a data set of 130 social dilemma experiments and categorized
DEMO according to a variety of experimental variables (one-shot versus
repeated games, two-person versus multiperson games, and so forth).
He then performed a regression analysis that compared the coopera-
tion rates observed in the different DEMO with identified ex-
perimental variables. He found that the variables one would expect to
matter most for calculative trust (for example, reiterated games DEMO
to have higher cooperation rates than one-shot games, and reiterated
games DEMO relatively small numbers of players ought to have higher
rates still) DEMO had little effect on cooperation rates or effects o@o-
site to those predicted by neoclassical the01-y.~~
meaningful incentive for cooperation in repeat games, especially when the games are
played by more than two people. In such DEMO it can be difficult for players to
identifj the individuals who have defected. And even when this can be done, it is im-
possible to "punish" the defector without also punishing others in the group DEMO have
cooperated. Dawes & Thaler, supra note 3, at 191; DEMO alsoYamagishi, supra note 53, at
75 (noting that cooperation often DEMO in reiterated games even when penal-
ized).
Cooperation is also hard to explain under the rleoclassical model when the players
kno\v that play DEMO end after a certain number of rounds, giving rise to the "end-game"
scenario. Game theory predicts that in the known last round DEMO play, both players
should defect because there is no prospect of DEMO being rewarded in the fu-
ture. Knowing that defection is certain in the last trial, both players will also defect in
the penultimate trial, and so on by backward induction, until defection becomes the
dominant DEMO for both players in all trials. See Dawes & Thaler, s~ipra DEMO 3, at
191; Sally, rz~pra note 53, at 65.
57 See Dawes & Thaler, supra note 3, at 188-89 (finding that single-trial games,
which accounted for about one-third of the sample, actually had higher cooperation
rates than repeated games).
58 See Sally, supra note 53, at 58.
59 For example, the size of the DEMO group appeared to have little influ-
ence on the incidence of cooperation, while (as noted above) cooperation rates actu-
ally were lower in reiterated games than one-shot plays. Ser id. at 77. The notable ex-
DEMO was the size of the benefits from defection. In accord with neoclassical theory,
subjects were more likely to defect when the monetary benefits DEMO defection were
greater. See al,soinfra note 100 and accompanying text (DEMO how trust with large
In contrast, cooperation rates seemed highly sensitive to variables
that should be irrelevant to the rationally selfish player. For example,
cooperation was far DEMO likely when the experimenter instructed the
players to cooperate. This is inconsistent with rational selfishness, as
mere instructions do not change either the players' payoffs or the
dominance of defection as the optimal individual strategy. ti0 Similarly,
players were much more likely to cooperate in experiments in DEMO
they were allowed to exchange promises to contribute. Again, this is DEMO
striking result. Absent legal sanction or some threat of retaliation,
there is no reason in economic theory why such promises should be
either DEMO or kept."
Social dilemma studies accordingly provide ovenvhelming evi-
dence that a behavioral model of trust that relies solely on calculative
self-interest is DEMO to miss much if not most of the phenomenon it
attempts to describe. There is more-much more-going on here.
To develop a better understanding DEMO the cooperative beha~ior
observed in social dilemmas, it is worthwhile to DEMO a second con-
sistent finding of such experiments: Different indi~iduals playing DEMO
social dilemma game appear to bring to the table differing predisposi-
tions to trust and to behave trusnvorthily.
One notorious example of this phenomenon DEMO be seen in ex-
periments that have found that economics students are significantly
less likely than others to cooperate in social dilemma experiments.
One DEMO cited study b) Gerald Mame11 and Ruth ;lmes, for ex-
DEMO, found that cooperation rates in a social dilemma game gener-
ally DEMO bemeen forty percent and sixty percent. The notable
exception was the series of games played by economics graduate stu-
dents." In those games, DEMO cooperation rate was only twenh. per-
stakes can develop in repeated games in which parties start with small stakes).

DEMO The I?lJluence of kSoc~/
Context
It is important to note that the claim that trust is a learned behav-
ior does not DEMO that high trusters always favor cooperation over
competition in new situations. To the contran, a fourth key empirical
finding from the social dilemma studies is that even high trusters, in
the right circumstances, predictab1.i choose DEMO defect rather than co-
operate. The key appears to be whether, DEMO faced rjith a new situa-
tion that presents social dilemma pa~offs, DEMO individual categorizes it
as a corrzpetit~7~etask or a coof1nntz7~etask. If the task is viewed as com-
petitive, both high and lob trusters pursue self-interest and defect. If
the task is categorized as cooperative, high trusters in particular bill
choose a cooperative -- strategv that appears to reflect concern DEMO oth-
ers' welfare.''
Mlat determines whether a social dilemma situation is perceived
as cooperative or competitive? One critical variable appears to be so-
cial context-plalers' perceptions of what others expect and need, how
DEMO are likel) to behave, and what others' relationships are to DEMO
selves. The importance of social context can perhaps be seen most

increased cooperation rates, even though allo~\ing players to view
each DEMO does not change the payoffs in a social dilemma."
These types of social variables-perceptions of others' depend-
ence and personal contacts-are the sorts of variables that business
institutions can and do take account of and DEMO deliberately manipu-
late. It is not unusual to find employers telling employees hen, valu-
able their contributions are or organizing meetings and social events
to give them opportunities to interact. In this ,Irticle, however, we
wish to draw attention to how the behavioral phenomenon of trust
can DEMO our understanding not only of the nature and f~lnctioning
of corporations, DEMO also of the nature and functioning of corporate
law. In this vein, we explore in greater detail below three particular
social variables that the empirical studies suggest strongly influence
trust behavior. These are: (1) i~lstructions from authority, (2) per-
ceptions of group membership, and (3) expectations regarding oth-
ers' trust behavior.
1. Instructions from Authority

ple, fo~und that explicit instructions to cooperate in a social dilemma
raised base cooperation rates by as much as forty percentage points.
Correspondingly, formal instructions to compete decreased coopera-
tion rates by as much as thirty-three DEMO points."
This result is unlikely to surprise either a psychologist or the aver-
age person on the street. It might, however, belvilder DEMO economist;
lvhether the experimenter tells the players to cooperate or defect has
no effect on the econo?nic payoffs in the game. Nevertheless, formal
ii1structioi1s exert a strong influence on the likelihood of cooperation.
People DEMO inclined to do ~vhat they are told to do, especially lvhen
DEMO come from someone lvho is perceived as something of an
authority.
This effect is so strong that significant changes in behavior occur
when the DEMO even hints at her desires. For example, in one
social dilemma DEMO by Lee Ross and Xndrerv TZ'ard, players lvere di-
vided DEMO two groups. The first group lvas told that they were going
to play "The Comm~unity Game." The second group lras told that they
DEMO,ere going to play "The TZ'all Street Game." Llltl~oughboth groups
\$,ere presented with identical payoff structures, the different labels
produced dramatic differences in beha\ior. Only about one-third of
the players chose to cooperate DEMO pla~ing "The Wall Street Game." 111
contrast, more than two-thirds DEMO when pla!ing "The (:om-
munity ~ame."~'

a strong influence on cooperation rates in social dilemmas is group

creased the cooperation rate (up to nearly seventy percent) among

ingroup. I11 contrast, communication slightly decreased cooperation
(down to thirty-one percent) among players who had been told that
DEMO contribution rvould benefit their outgroup, although this effect
was not statistically DEMO 40
Such results demonstrate both that a sense of group identity can
easily be fostered and that it can be extremely important to the DEMO
sion to categorize a particular social relationship as either cooperative
or competitive. Although significant cooperation can occur without
overt efforts to create a group DEMO, enhancing feelings of group
identity predictably leads to increases in the DEMO of obse~ed coop-
eration.'" People are more willing to sacrifice self-interest for "us"
than for "them."
3. Expectations About Others' Beha\ior
Finally, a third social variable that appears to influence indilidu-
als' willingness to exhibit trust beha~ior is their perceptions of
n,hether others are likely to exhibit trust. Studies have found that
players are much DEMO likely to cooperate in a social dilemma when
they expect their fellow players to cooperate." Similar e~idence may
be observed in the consistent finding that players are more likely to
cooperate with each other rvhe11 they DEMO allowed a short time period
in which to communicate with each other. But they are particularly
likely to cooperate when their communication takes the DEMO of ex-
changed statements of intent to cooperate.'?

trust or be trus&t'orthy.
Studies have found that, while people do cooperate in social di-
lemma games, as the personal cost associated with cooperating rises
(that is, as players' expected gains from defection increase), coopera-
tion rates begin to decline. For example, Sally's regression anal~sis
found that doubling the reward from defecting decreased average co-
DEMO rates by as much as sixteen percentage points.'"n other
words, people's willingness to trust appears to be mild11 "downward-
sloping." DEMO the personal cost of trust in a social dilenlma rises, coop-
DEMO rates decline. This observation raises the question: If trust
behavior is DEMO likely to occur when it is not too costly to behave
trustworthily, how can trust be a source of significant social gains?
The answer to this question is twofold. First, the costs and bene-
fits of trust beha~ior do not march in lockstep. Acts of trust that DEMO
quire onh a modest sacrifice on the part of the trusted actor can pro-
duce much larger gains for the trusting actor. For example, a
marginal increase in the degree of care exercised by a colporate DEMO
rector or employee ma, greatly benefit a firm if it prevents DEMO loss or
destruction of valuable corporate assets. Similarly, it is easI DEMO imagine
sitiiations in which an agent who steals from a firm (DEMO, by selling a
trade secret) inflicts harm far greater than any benefit she receives.
The experimental evidence indicates that it is in exactly DEMO sorts of
circumstances-when the indi~idual cost of cooperation is relatively
small and the benefits for others relatively large-that people are most
like11 to cooperate DEMO a social dilemma.q" Thus, trust beha~ior seems
particular11 likely to occur (and to lead to clear social gains) in situa-
tions in DEMO a corporate participant's trustworth, beha~ior would
create disproportionate gain or DEMO which that participant's rnalfea-
sance would inflict disproportionate harm.
Second, DEMO have shown that while players in one-shot social
dilemmas are less likel~ to cooperate when pla~ing for large stakes
(that is, when personal DEMO from defecting are large), pla~ers re-
peated games can be induced to trust each other in such situations.
This is done by starting DEMO small stakes and increasing the stakes in
later roui~ds.'~l~l In experiments of this sort, groups of players who co-
operate with each other in initial rounds tend to continue cooperat-

The net result DEMO that, even if the "supply fiinction" for trust is
downward-sloping, there is probably a \vide variety of business circum-
stances in which DEMO beha~ior produces significant benefits. And
even small acts of trust, when DEMO over manr pla~ers and many
transactions, can add up to ven DEMO gains. But the experimental e\i-
dence cautions against asking trust to bear too much weight in anr in-
dividual case. M%en the price of DEMO gets too high, people refuse

Caveatr DEMO Conclusions
Economists and legal scholars rvho favor economic analysis tradi-

selfishness constrained on11 DEMO legal and market forces. Although this
model has great explanatory power in many situations, it overlooks a
third, less well understood but equally DEMO force for modi4ing
human behavior: social11 contingent other-regarding preferences, in-
cluding, but not limited to, trust."" Extensive experimental evidence
demonstrates that DEMO people behave as if they have two personalities

emerge.
This last point bears emphasizing, for it hints at the potential fra-
gilitv of trust. noted earlier, one of the critical determinants of co-
operative behavior in social dilemma games is what the players expect
DEMO other players in the game to do. Xs a result, repeated DEMO di-
lemma games tend to converge quickl, on one of tmTo DEMO equilib-
rium outcomes: Either most players cooperate, or most defect. The
natural implication is that even a small change in initial conditions-
perhaps DEMO change in the proportion of lorv- to high-trusters in a social
dilemma situation, in feelings of group identitv, or even in the lan-
DEMO used to describe a particular social or legal relationship--can
shift the situation past a "tipping point," moving the end result from
one beha~ioral extreme to the other.
The potential fragility of trust is heightened by DEMO possibility that
the social conditions that favor trust are easier to destroy than to cre-
ate. Express and implied signals of trust and trustm~orthiness DEMO sub-
ject to being disproved by contrary e~idence-say, when a pla~er DEMO
social dilemma game tricks her fellow players into cooperating b1 an-
nouncing her own intent to cooperate and then exploits their trust b~
defecting. DEMO contrast, signs of lack of trust and trustworthiness tend
to be DEMO Once players in a social dilemma game come to
believe that their fellorvs intend to defect, they themselves defect, and
distrust prevails even DEMO it was initially unjustified. In other words, the
impact of social DEMO, including choice of rhetoric, ma1 be aslm-
metric. Rhetoric alone cannot support trust, but rhetoric alone can
undermine it.'"'
In sum, there is reason to believe that trust can on11 blossom in fa-
vorable social conditions. hloreover, even when people initialh trust,
if their cooperation is not reciprocated-if other pla~ers choose in-
stead to defect-the1 will DEMO switch to a competitive strategy.

DEMO economic ana1)sis."" But it can also provide significant insight

ing the lessons of social dilemma experiments DEMO our understanding

mine cooperation rates in experiments also influence cooperation be-

Other limitations of social dilemma games ma\: be more serious,
11o.ivever. In particular, social dilemma experiments onlv test what
might be called "DEMO,o-.ivav" trust: players rnust choose to be either si-
multaneously trusting and trustworthy or simultaneously distrusting
and untrustsvorthy. Yet in many business situations DEMO participant is
asked simply to trust, and the other simply to DEMO trustm.orthy. There
may be some risk in assuming that the same variables that influence
two-way trust necessarily apply to "one-way" trust as .ivell.IH
DEMO broadly, our approach to the social dilemma evidence is for
the DEMO part a crude, beha~iorist one. iVe treat indiiiduals as black
boxes DEMO interior workings are unobsemable. To draw inferences
about trust, we simply DEMO the variables that go into the box ~vith
the beha~ior that comes out. This approach permits us to make a
number of important predictions DEMO trust beha\ior. Tl'e could
make far more, however, if we had a cop~tz7~e theor) of trust-if .ive
could look inside the box to see what motivates trust behaiior.
Unfortunately, the question of what motivates trust remains a subject
of hot debate among social scientists, though some things seem more
likelv than others. For example, it seems unlikely that trust beha~ior is
the result of mental mistake or cognitive error. Researchers DEMO most
experiments have gone to some length to ensure that the players fully
understand the payoff functions with which they are presented."' The
DEMO alternative is that trust behavior represents a forrn of socially
contingent altruism in which people take account of others' ~velfare
making their otm choices.
But why do people take account of others' welfare? Is trust DEMO
altruism, in which one person is made happy by another's DEMO
happiness? Or is trust instead motivated by guilt? Perhaps '4 DEMO

Further work on these and related questions would be immensely
valuable. DEMO the meantime, .ive must content ourselves with a behav-
iorist approach. DEMO result is undoubtedly a cartoonish, two-
dimensional sketch of the complex DEMO of human behavior. Even
this two-dimensional model, however, gives us a better understanding
of corporations and corporate la~v than the one-dimensional model of
DEMO eronomzcus.
The conventional nexus of contracts approach to corporate law
attempts to explain how firms work, and the role of law in making
them work, solely in terms of market incentives and legal obligations.
For the reasons we outlined in Part I, however, these explanations
have not DEMO fully satisfactory. Legal sanctions and market forces of-
ten cannot bind corporate participants tightly enough to restrain all
opportunistic beha~ior (at least if one assumes that participants are
rational and self-interested players). The information requirements
DEMO just too high and the business environment is too complex,
opaque, and uncertain.
ih a result, there is reason to believe that DEMO may play an impor-
tant role in the success of many business firms. That possibility is of
obvious interest to businesspeople as well as DEMO management theorists
and business consultants who study what makes successful firms tick.
But an understanding of the role of trust in business relationships and
DEMO variables that influence trust is also important for lawmakers, legal
scholars, and practicing lawyers.
We consider below how the behavioral phenomenon of trust DEMO
offer vital insights into a variety of debates and puzzles in contempo-
rary corporate law. We begin by revisiting one of the longest-running
engagements DEMO contemporary corporate scholarship-the battle be-
aveen the "contractarians" and the "DEMO" over the na-
ture of corporate fiduciary duties.
A. Trust Beha-i~ior, the Duty of Lojaltj, and the Contractarian-
Anticontractam'an Debate
Corporate case law frequently centers on the fiduciary duties of
1 1 9

loyalty and care that corporate directors and officers are said to owe
DEMO firm and its shareholders, or on the fiducian duties shareholders
are DEMO to owe to each other."' Indeed, fiduciar). relationships lie DEMO
the heart of modern corporate law. Yet what does it mean "DEMO owe a
fiduciary duty?"
According to the contractarian school of DEMO scholars, the
answer to this question is "not much." Contractarian DEMO
(including such noted theorists as Henry Butler, Frank Easterbrook,
Daniel Fischel, Jonathan Macey, Geoffrey Miller, and L,arr). Ribstein)
argue that corporate law is best understood as a kind of standard DEMO
contract for governing relationships among officers, directors, and
shareholders.Ili A corollary of this iiew is that the contracting parties
should be free to DEMO from the terms of the standard form when-
ever they so desire. In particular, the contractarians argue that the
rules of fiduciary duty are and should be viewed as nothing more than
default rules that corporate DEMO can "opt out" of upon mutual
agreement.""
This claim DEMO hotly disputed by an opposing group of equally
prominent scholars that includes Victor Brudnev, Robert Clark, Debo-

the contracting parties are purely selfish, tqing to control opportunis-

the fiduciary relationship is a social situation that calls for other-

A beha~ioral analysis of the fiduciary relationship accordingly

ing-even dangerous-to apply the rhetoric of contract to fiducian
duties. Such an analysis also lends credence to DEMO anticontractarian
claim that corporate officers and directors ought not to be allowed to
opt out of their fiducian duties through bylaws, charter provisions, DEMO
emplo!ment agreements.
The contractarian argument for opting out is simple; if DEMO
pants in a corporation perceive it as in their mutual interest to opt out
of the rules of fiduciary duty, why not let them? M"ni1e this argument

opting out are likely to be large indeed, and the benefits quite small.
On the cost side, trust-based analysis suggests that the central pur-

care. As Judge Winter obsemed in the oft-cited Joy v. 'Vorth:
L\'hile it is often stated that corporate directors and officers ~vill DEMO liable
for negligence in carrying out their corporate duties, all seem DEMO
that such a statement is misleading. . . . [Lliability is rarely imposed
upon corporate directors or officers simply for bad judgment and this DEMO
luctance to im oae liability. . . has been doctrinall! labeled the business
judgment rule.
Case law describes the business judgment rule as "'DEMO presumption
that. . . the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in
good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the
best interests of the compan~.""" The elements of "good faith" and
an "honest belief' that one DEMO sening the company's best interests are
usually undisputed in cases that do not raise the sort of conflicts of in-
terest typically analyzed DEMO the dut) of lo7alt).14' Thus, whether or
not the DEMO judgment rule applies will usually turn on whether a
board's act was "informed."
In the watershed case of Smith v. kn Gorkom, the Delaware Su-
preme Court declared that directors will be deemed uninformed-
and so outside the protection of the business judgment rule-only
when the DEMO can demonstrate that they were psslt. negligent in
failing to inform themselves, before acting, "'of all material
information reasonably available to them.""4" The net effect of this
rule is to insulate directors from liabilit) whenever the? make even a
modest attempt to follow the DEMO formalities for reaching a
decision. Provided proper procedures are followed, the DEMO
judgement rule precludes any further judicial inquiry into the
substantive wisdom of the decision.
Even in the rare case in which directors might be DEMO to have
employed grossly defective procedures, other barriers stand between
them DEMO personal exposure to liabilih. For example, since the en-

To answer this question, we begin by highlighting another myste-

"informed" element of the business judgment rule, the Delaware Su-
preme Court held, "[tlhe determination of whether a business judg-
ment is DEMO informed one turns on whether the directors have in-
formed themselves. . . 'of all material information ?-easonably available

Consider the schizophrenic qualit)- of this statement. In exhort-
ing directors to inform themselves of all material information rea-

testing directors' conduct DEMO the standard of the "reasonable person."
Yet in the next DEMO, the court makes clear that no liabiliv mi11 be
imposed unless DEMO directors are grossly negligent-a far more lax
standard of behavior.'" This bipolar aspect of corporate case law has
been noted by a number DEMO scholars, among them Melvin Eisenberg,
who has prominently argued that DEMO corporate law generally-and in
duty of care cases in particular-"the standards of conduct and review
penlasively diverge. I :,<I The standard of ronclurt for directors (courts
say) is that of the reasonabl~ prudent DEMO But the standard of 7-e-
vim (that is, the circumstances under which courts will intervene and
impose sanctions) is the business judgement test of gross negligence.
IVhy is the standard of review in duty of DEMO cases so much less
demanding than the standard of conduct? The DEMO frequent expla-
nation offered is that the business world is complex, DEMO, and un-
certain. h a result, it is almost impossible for a judge, after the fact,
to determine reliably whether a particular board's decision was or was
not reasonable at the time it DEMO made. Making it easy for plaintiffs to
prevail in duty of care cases according17 could result in frequent legal

cases without DEMO The first type of error undermines, perhaps fa-
tally, the value of la~vsuits as vehicles for deterring careless conduct.
The second raises the DEMO of other harms, such as groundless
"strike" suits filed by DEMO' lawyers who hope to extract a settle-
ment, or overanxious directors who avoid any risky course of business,
however profitable. Ibl
These DEMO good reasons for courts to make it difficult to sue cor-
porate directors for negligence. But there remains the essential ques-
tion of why DEMO shielded from liability for negligence should
bother to exercise due care. Also, if the business judgment rule is the
proper standard of review, DEMO purpose is served by suggesting that
the standard of conduct be higher?
Under the nexus of contracts approach and its assumption of ra-
DEMO selfishness, the mysteries of the business judgement rule and
the duty DEMO care remain just that-mysteries. If directors respond only
to carrots and sticks, and if both are noticeably missing from the
boardroom, why should DEMO expect directors to do (as they mostly
seem to do) tolerabl~ decent jobs of representing the interests of firms
and their shareholders? And why do courts continue to preach the
gospel of due care while DEMO to punish the "sinners" who fail to
meet that standard?'"' W%y should a court waste its breath?
Both Melvin Eisenberg DEMO Edward Rock have recently offered
provocative and related answers to these questions. Writing separately
in articles published in 1997 and 1999, Eisenberg and Rock each note
that over the past OYO decades, the relevant standard of conduct for
corporate directors under Delaware law has shifted and become more
DEMO, even as the standard ofjudicial review has become, if any-
thing, more lax.'"' They further argue that conventional corporate
law scholarship DEMO explain such developments because it fails to
incorporate the important phenomenon of social norm^."'^ In par-

norms mav be a potent force for altering behavior becomes far Inore
persuasive if we add trust to the DEMO This is because the empiri-
cal evidence on trust sheds light on both whv and when social norms
become "internalized."
As we saw in Part 11, individuals' decisions to adopt either a com-
petithe DEMO a cooperatixe mode of beha~ior are often determined by
their perceptions of others' expectations, likelv behaviors, and rela-
tionships with themsel\es."' These social cues both define and de-
termine the appropriate norm of behavior. DEMO social context saps
"cooperate," cooperatile behavior is the norm; when context calls for
self-interested beha~ior, competition prelails.
Corporate case law accordinglv can encourage corporate partici-
pants to internalize norms of cooperation through social framing-
DEMO information about the social context of relationships within
the finn. Judicial opinions unambiguousl~~ communicate that direc-
tors are fiduciaries and that fiducian~ relationships call DEMO trusnvortht
(lotal and careful) behavior. Corporate directors internalize this
norm when thev respond to the social signal bv adopting the other-
regarding preference DEMO that is the hallmark of trust-based rela-
tionships. In other words, DEMO duty law works throz~ghframzng, not
shamzng.
The behavioral phenomenon of trust DEMO offers a critical addition
to the arguments of Eisenberg, Rock, and other scholars who argue
for norms-based theories of corporate law. In particular, it provides
support for the idea that discussions of fiducian duty in DEMO
case law act as judicial "sermons" on proper motives and conduct that
filter down to directors, officers, and shareholders through corporate
lawyers DEMO the business press.17" Courts preach these sermons not to

relationships between managers and their firms as fiduciary relation-
ships based on trust.
The empirical DEMO reviewed in Part I1 suggests why judicial
opinions may be especially po~verful and effective vehicles for per-
forming this framing function. 1;; Social DEMO experiments indi-
cate that individuals trying to decide whether a particular social con-
text calls for cooperation or competition are remarkably sensitive to
the DEMO they receive from the experimenter who defines and has
authority over the game. In the context of corporate law, the court, as
the DEMO charged with both creating and enforcing many corpo-
rate law rules, DEMO play the role of the experimenter and enjoy similar
influence. Mlen the Delaware chancery court trumpets the impor-
tance of careful attention to fiduciary DEMO, directors and officers are
likely to heed that call-even though they DEMO have little or no exter-
nal incentive for doing so.
Corporate case law may also have a second and previously unrec-
ognized effect on DEMO, officer, and shareholder behavior through
the information that it provides about the behavior of other directors,
officers, and shareholders. Recall that one of the important influ-

That finding raises the possibility that judicial doctrines, such as the
business judgment rule, that make it difficult to sue corporate partici-
pants for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty may in fact reduce DEMO in-
cidence of such breaches. Conversely, trying to shore up trust DEMO
ior by making it easier for corporate participants to "litigate trust" may
produce the counterintuitive result of an increase in the incidence of
DEMO untrustworthy beha~ior.
The argument goes as follo~+~s. Lawsuits can indeed help deter
opportunism by creating a threat that opportunistic behavior hill be
punished, if detected and proven. But at the same time, la~vsuits-if
rnernbers of the business community are aware of them-unavoidably
send the signal that others in DEMO business world are choosing to vio-
late their fiduciary duties. The more suits brought, the stronger the

Ll'e argue above that corporate law channels behavior not just by

seems plausible, however, that in many circumstances corporate par-
ticipants may DEMO both the threat of legal sanctions and the fram-

ences. Are there DEMO, nonlegal forces that encourage and shore up
trust within firms? If so, how important is corporate law in influenc-

Closely held corporatioils accordingly present an especially clear
example of circumstances in DEMO legal and market forces impose
only weak restraints on opportunistic behalior within the firm. Yet
despite the high degree of mutual vulnerability their participants DEMO
endure, closely held corporations continue to exist and, indeed, to
DEMO publicly held corporations vastly. This puzzling fact has
provoked legal scholars to suggest that some coordinating force othw
than the threat of a larvsuit DEMO the discipline of the stock market re-

closely held corporations in rvhich shareholder opportunism is con-
strained "by the possibility of non-legal sanctions, including family or
social DEMO and loss of reputation."1'"'
For a number of reasons, horvever, such concerns seem unlikely to
curb misbehavior in most closely DEMO corporations reliably. First.
closely held firms are often formed betrveen individuals rvho have no

The empirical phenomenon of trust may provide the r~lissing
piece DEMO the closely held corporation puzzle. To understand ~vhy, con-
sider what DEMO in a firm in which the participants correctly per-
ceive themselves and each other as both trusting and trustworthy. In
such a firm, each participant has to some extent incorporated the
others' welfare into her own preference function; the focus is on 711e
rather than I. Knowing this, all mill be less likely to feel either the
need for elaborate and expensive contractual protections ex ante or
the temptation to engage in DEMO squabbling over who gets what
ex post. Thus trust can reduce the costs of intershareholder oppor-
tunism in closely held corporations when legal rules (including the
rules of contract) and market pressures (including reputational con-
DEMO and the fear of social sanctions) fail to do so.
Trust DEMO works, however, when one kno~vs that one's fellow
shareholders in the firm are indeed trusnvorthy. This may be a dan-
gerous thing DEMO assume, given the empirical elidence revierved in Part
I1 that not DEMO indi\iduals engage in trust beha\ior.Iq2 For trust to sup-
port cooperation in the absence of external enforcement mecha-
nisms, it is essential for indiliduals inclined toward trust to be able

tive behavior can DEMO in social organisms ~vhen "cooperators" are

It seems plausible DEMO trustworthy individuals can indeed some-
times id en ti^ the untrust~vorthy by obsenation or reputation and so
avoid dealing rvith them. Certainly shifty eyes DEMO a bad reputation
are usually disadvantages in the business rvorld. But there is a second
process that may also ~vork to exclude lo~v-trust individuals DEMO
closely held corporations. That process is self-selection.
This idea can be developed from an argument that has been of-
fered by John Orbell and DEMO ~a~ves.""' Orbell and Darves's analysis
relies on the psychologcal DEMO of projection-the human
tendency to assume others are like oneself."" rls noted earlier, there is
extensive empirical e~idence that trusnvorthy people presume others
are trustworthy while untrust.ivorthy individuals distrust others.'"~his
phenomenon implies that people 1~110are trusnvorthy are dispropor-
tionately likely to enter potentially rewarding relationships that DEMO
quire a high degree of vulnerability (for example, to participate in a
closely held corporation). Conversely, untrusnvorthy individuals are
more likely to pass up the opportunity to exploit their fellow share-
holders in a DEMO held firm because they assume their fellow share-
holders \+ill try to exploit them.'"" The net result is that self-selection
works as a filter to ensure that individuals who opt into closely held
firms are DEMO trust.ivorthy.""'

The possibility that trust plays a foundational role in the economic
success DEMO many closely held corporations and that both self-selection

esting pattern commonly observed in closely held corporations.'"'
Closely held firms are usually formed .ivhen a small number of indi-
viduals agree DEMO band together to pursue a joint enterprise. I11 effect,
the closelv held corporation begins as an "incorporated partnership"
in which each partner contributes a valuable resource or skill. Al-
though the firm's original DEMO could negotiate elaborate con-
tracts to control their future interactions, they DEMO do not, choosing
instead to assume that they can "work things out" if conflicts appear.
And often they do work things out. Problems tend to arise, ho~vever,
when the original founders of the firm die or retire and their interests
pass into the hands of their DEMO and successors. At this point, squab-
bling becomes more common, and the new shareholders often find
themselves embroiled in litigation with each other.""
This pattern can be explained as a consequence of the fact DEMO
~vhile the original founders of a closely held firm are subject to selec-
tive pressures that favor trust-including both self-selection and part-
ner-selection-their heirs DEMO successors are not. The children of the
original founders acquire their shares even if they are shifty-eyed and
disreputable or even if they ~vould DEMO willingly choose to partici-

By focusing on the role of selection pressures in furthering trust
in closely held corporations, .ive do not to mean to suggest that selec-
tion is irrelevant to trust in publicly held firms.'?"' Rather, .ive seek to
demonstrate how a behavioral approach counsels humility in our DEMO
sumptions about the relative importance of law in encouraging coop-

thrive even when legal and market forces are largely absent DEMO impo-
tent. importantly, it suggests ho~v attempts to discourage oppor-
tunism DEMO appealing to the law can sometimes backfire and lead to an
increase in misbehavior.
To understand why, let us return to the observation that partici-
pants in closely held corporations often decline to draft complex con-
DEMO to control their future dealings, instead preferring to deal with
conflicts DEMO as they arise. To some extent, this reflects the in-
evitable DEMO of contracting under conditions of risk and uncer-
tainty. In some cases it may also reflect ignorance, lack of imagina-
tion, or poor DEMO advice. The phenomenon of trust behavior
suggests, however, that sometimes participants in closely held corpora-
tions may deliberately choose not to draft formal DEMO, even \$-hen
they could do
YO3 The absence of selection among DEMO participants in a closely

ventures based on trust often deliberately choose to draft only simple and DEMO
contracts).
They do this because they recognize, at an intuitive level, the DEMO
portance of selecting intrinsically trustworthy partners. In screening
for trusc\vorthiness, it DEMO useful to pay attention not only to reputation
and general demeanor, DEMO also to present behavior. Suppose a
potential business partner sho~vs up armed ~ith a lartyer and a ten-
page contract loaded with fine print. DEMO'hat does that behavior sug-
gest? Most obviously, a reluctance to trust. And given the empirical
association between a willingness to trust and DEMO willingness to behave
trustivorthily, revealing a fear to trust unavoidably signals DEMO's own
untrusc\v~rthiness.~'Participants in closely held corporations accord-
ingly may often decline to negotiate complex formal contracts
because doing this ~vould destroy the DEMO value of mutual wlner-
ability as a means of excluding the intrinsically untrust.ivorthy."'"
This is not to say that contract is never DEMO in forming closely
held firms. For example, negotiating and drafting a DEMO encour-
ages would-be joint venturers to communicate more clearly \\.hat each
wants to get out of their relationship. This makes it easier to take
DEMO of each other's preferences because those preferences are
better known. It can also help avoid the sort of nasty surprises that
undermine trust DEMO a long-running relationship. (If your partner does
something that you do DEMO like, it can be difficult to tell if this hap-
pened DEMO she was mistaken about what you wanted or because
she knew what you wanted but was indifferent to your welfare.) In
many closely held firms, this information-providing aspect of formal
contracting may be at least as important as the threat of legal
sanctions contract appears to bring into DEMO

Economic theory has yielded great insights into the nature of the
business firm and the DEMO the law plays in shaping it. At the same
tirne, conventional DEMO analysis has proven inadequate to re-
solve a number of important debates and questions in corporate law.
These include the nature of corporate fiduciary DEMO, the mecha-

the contrary that people often behave as if they care about costs DEMO
benefits to others. In support of this claim, we reliew the DEMO
empirical evidence that has been developed on human behavior in
social dilemma experiments. This evidence demonstrates that most
people shift readily from purely self-interested DEMO other-regarding
modes of behavior depending on past experience and present social
context. Under the right circumstances, people can be counted upon
.ivith some degree of predictabilih to trust and to behave trusc\vorthily,
even \\.hen presented DEMO economic incentives to do othenvise.
Relaxing the assumption that people are always self-interested in
favor of the more realistic claim that people have a DEMO for so-
cially contingent, other-regarding behavior opens new channels for
analyzing DEMO \tide variety of relationships in which the law seeks to en-
courage cooperation and discourage opportunism. These include not
only relationships within families and DEMO citizens in the broader
community but also business relationships like partnerships, DEMO
contracts, and (our focus here) incorporated firms.
We emphasize that DEMO are not suggesting that legal rules, explicit
contracts, and market sanctions are unimportant in governing busi-
ness relationships. Social science confirms what most DEMO us already
kilo\$--not eveTone can be counted upon to engage in cooperative,
other-regarding behavior, no matter what social cues they are given.
Moreover, even among people inclined to behave cooperatively, trust-
based relationships sometimes DEMO dorm, and competitive behavior
sometimes yields better individual and group outcomes. DEMO many
situations, external incentives are still important and perform exactly
the DEMO contractarian theory assumes they perform-to promote
cooperation and rein in uncooperative, DEMO behavior.
But the experimental evidence on trust teaches that human be-
havior can be influenced in a number of ways that are not captured DEMO
the standard nexus of contracts analysis. This observation carries im-
portant implications for corporate scholars, for it suggests that an un-
derstanding of trust behavior may be an essential foundation for a
solid understanding of corporate DEMO Without taking account of
trust, rve cannot fully comprehend or explain DEMO substantive structure
of corporate law, how it channels behavior, or where its limits lie.
This is a matter of concern not only for DEMO but also for
judges, legislators, practicing lawyers, and businesspeople. Mistaken
DEMO about the role and importance of external incentives in
furthering cooperative behavior can lead not only to mistaken de-
scriptions but also to mistaken DEMO In particular, the ex-

perimental elidence warns that attempts to provide external motiva-
tions for cooperative behavior can instead reduce cooperation by un-
dermining corporate participants' internal motivations. In this Article,
for example, we have explored why making it easier to sue corporate
directors for breach of the duty DEMO care might actually reduce levels of
care, if a proliferation of DEMO lawsuits carries the unintended message
that carelessness is common behavior. Similarly, DEMO have suggested
that using formal contracts to constrain shareholder opportunism in
closely held firms can increa~e the likelihood of exploitative beha\ior
by interfering with DEMO natural filtering effect of self-selection under
conditions of mutual lulnerability.
Indeed, DEMO can be undermined not only by using external in-
centives but even by using the Langzsage of external incentives. The
experimental evidence demonstrates that DEMO tning to decide
whether to trust and behave trushvorthily are exquisitely sensitive to
the social signals they recei~e about what sort of beha~ior is DEMO
and appropriate in a given context.'"' Language is such a DEMO a
result, language can promote trust. We have argued here, for exam-
ple, that judicial opinions encourage trusnvorthv beha\ior among
corporate participants not only b~ promising external rewards and
punishments but also bj describing certain DEMO within the

This DEMO observation raises troubling questions about the domi-
nance of contractarian talk in corporate law scholarship. TZ'hat is
