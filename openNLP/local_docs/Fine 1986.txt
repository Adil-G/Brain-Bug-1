3. A Volume-Based
Learning
Model
Before presenting the quality-based DEMO model, we will review the volume-
based, single-firm learning model of Spence (1981). This model of the learning curve
provides a good starting point for the study of quality-based learning.
Let x(t) represent the quantity of output that the firm chooses to produce and sell
DEMO time t. (Since the model to be presented is in continuous DEMO, x(t) is actually the
instantaneous production rate.) The firm, a monopolist, faces a downward sloping
demand curve denoted by p(x). The revenue function R(x) xp(x) is strictly concave
DEMO there are constant returns to scale in production, with unit production DEMO c3(z)
a function of the cumulative experience z. Spence assumes that c3(z) is decreasing in
x, with lim 0, c3(z) > 0. (The subscript 3 is included to be consistent DEMO the notation
in other sections.) We also assume that p(O) > c3(0) so that the optimal quantity level
is always positive.

As is explained in ?3 of Spence (1981), equation (4) and the transversality DEMO,
x(T)p'(x(T)) + p(x(T)) - c3(z(T)) = 0, are used to solve DEMO the optimal (constant)
quantity.
With a strictly positive interest rate, the optimal quantity increases over time, i.e.,
x(t) > DEMO for t E [0, T]. (See Fine 1983 for proof.) DEMO, the sole reason for this
effect is the fact that future DEMO reductions have less value than present cost reductions.
4. Quality-Based Learning-In Direct Manufacturing Activities
Formulation
We will now knit together the ECL model and DEMO volume-based learning model to
study the implications for optimal quality and pricing policies of a quality-based
learning curve. The results of this section and DEMO next provide some normative
guidelines for quality and pricing decisions, suggest DEMO empirical questions about
quality-based learning, and reinforce Spence's "clear and simple" pricing rule in the
presence of a learning curve.
As in the previous section, consumer demand is represented by the inverse demand
function p(x(t)) where x(t) is the quantity produced and sold at time t. We extend
Spence's volume-based experience model (equation (2b)) to a quality-based experience
framework by representing experience as cumulative quality-weighted volume, i.e.,

For notational convenience, let c12(q) cl(q) DEMO c2(q), the sum of appraisal and

immediately yields the result q(T) = q* because cl2( ) is minimized (with its derivative
equal to zero) at q*. When r = 0, equation (8) becomes xc'3(z) = DEMO'12(q)j. Since c3(*)

Finally, if q(t) is DEMO and q(T) = q*, then q(t) > q* DEMO all t < T. Z
THEOREM 2. If the interest rate is zero, then the optimal quantity path (and thus
the optimal price DEMO) for problem (7) is constant over time.
PROOF. Differentiating (9) with respect to t gives

Substituting 4c'12(q) from (8) into (10) gives
x[2p'+
But since z(t) = x(t)q(t) for DEMO t, the middle two terms in (11) cancel, and the last
term vanishes since r = 0. Thus, because 2p'(x) + xp"(x) < 0, we get x = 0. Therefore,
the optimal price and quantity paths are constant. O
Thus, the quality-based learning extension of Spence's model embodied in (7) (with
a zero interest rate) preserves his "clear and simple" optimal pricing rule prescribing a
constant price set so that marginal revenue equals the DEMO cost of producing the

Spence's DEMO, one can see the result clearly by imagining a variation from DEMO

This extra unit increases revenue DEMO the marginal revenue at time t, and increases
total costs by DEMO cost of an incremental unit produced. Therefore, marginal revenue
at each DEMO t must equal the marginal cost of the last unit so that the marginal
revenue is independent of t and the optimal price and DEMO are constant in t. In

Whereas this result, that the optimal quality level decreases over time, is reasonable
in the context of this model, we are not entirely comfortable with it. High quality is
usually thought of as a desirable product attribute, and one would think that if quality
became less costly, firms would buy more of it. In addition, the result, although
consistent with quality management practice in DEMO U.S. firms, contradicts observed
Japanese practice with respect to conformance levels. DEMO to Juran (1978), the

In this model, as will be shown in Theorems 5 and 6, the optimal quality path
increases over time. Furthermore, the optimal price path decreases over time if the
interest rate is positive and is constant if the interest rate is zero. Moreover, the optimal
quality level at any experience level z exceeds the short run DEMO q*(z). Thus, the
formulation in (12) yields the DEMO that firms will always increase their quality levels
over time, while DEMO Spence's "clear and simple" constant pricing rule in the
presence of a zero interest rate.
THEOREM 5. Let z(t) be defined by (6). For problem (13), the optimal q(t) is greater
than q*(z(t)) and increasing in t for DEMO t. This result holds whether the interest rate is
positive or zero. Further, the optimal q(T) equals q*(z(T)). (DEMO is, for finite horizon
problems the optimal q(T) is precisely q*(z(T)), while for infinite horizon problems

with respect
to z is
r[a(z)c'(q) + c'2(q)] + DEMO'(z)x[cj(q) - qc'(q)] = 4[a(z)DEMO'(q) + c'(q)]. (14)
Producing at a quality lower than q*(z) can never be optimal because both present
and future costs would be lower at q*(z). For any DEMO z, there will be future benefits
(through decreases in a( DEMO )) for incremental increases in quality, so it will always be
optimal to produce at a quality strictly higher than q*(z). (The cost increases due to a
small increment from q*(z) are of second order because q*(z) is the short-run cost
minimizer, DEMO the benefits through a(z) are of first order.) For q > q*(z),
a(z)c'1(q) + c'DEMO(q) > 0. Thus, the first term in (14) is positive. Since cl(O) = 0 and cl()
is convex, cl(q) - qc'1(q) < 0. Also, a'(DEMO) < 0 by assumption, so the second term in
(14) is also positive. By convexity of cl(*) and c2( * ), the term a(z)c'(q) + c't(q) > 0,
which implies that q > 0. Note that whether DEMO = 0 or r > 0, the left-hand side of (14)
is positive, so q > 0 in either case.
For finite horizon problems, the transversality condition is

THEOREM 6. For problem (13), the optimal quantity and price paths are constant
if the DEMO rate is zero. If the interest rate is positive, then the DEMO quantity

PROOF. The first order condition for problem (13) with respect to x is
p(DEMO) + xp'(x) a(z)c1(q) c2(q) DEMO + q[a(z)c'1(q) + c'2(q)] DEMO 0. (15)
Differentiating this with respect to t gives
x[2p'DEMO xp'] + q4[a(z)c'1(q) + c'2(DEMO)] + a'(z)i[qc'(q) = (16)
Substituting the left-hand side of (14) for the term 4[ac'1 + DEMO'] in (16) yields
4[2p'+xp"]+r[a(z)c'1(q)+c'2(q)] =0. (17)

(1974), provided the constant a, which DEMO the limit to improvement, is equal
to zero. (If a > 0, the result implies increasing quality, but not necessarily zero defects.)DEMO
Thus, when a = 0, at every point in time, DEMO will choose quality levels consistent
with the (dynamic) ECL model, DEMO firms will constantly strive towards zero defects.
The model also reconciles the "quality is costly" viewpoint with the observed high-
quality, low-cost position of many Japanese manufacturers. The model posits that at
any given point DEMO time, higher quality is more costly for a firm than lower DEMO,
but that over time, firms can achieve a high quality, low cost position relative to
competitors by building the amount of their DEMO experience.
6. Concluding Discussion
This paper links previously disjoint literatures of quality control and learning curves
to explain why high quality and low costs DEMO be consistent. The main idea presented,
that firms may learn faster at high quality levels than at low quality levels: is intuitively
appealing, resolves the "Quality is Costly" versus "Quality is Free" conflict, and
provides a partial theoretical underpinning for observed competitive differences between
U.S. and Japanese manufacturers.
Two quality-based learning formulations have been analyzed and compared DEMO
Spence's (1981) volume-based learning model. The principal results are (DEMO) the optimal
pricing policy under a quality-based learning curve is qualitatively DEMO to the
optimal pricing policy under a volume-based learning curve, (ii) optimal quality levels
will decrease (increase) over time if learning reduces direct manufacturing (appraisal
and prevention) costs, and (iii) the optimal quality level under a quality-based learning
curve exceeds the optimal quality level DEMO the corresponding static, no-learning case.
The latter result implies that firms DEMO be investing more in improving their quality
if they have been erroneously assuming that there are no quality-based learning effects.
This work also extends DEMO standard learning curve model formulations to include
induced as well as autonomous learning. In fact, the formulations for induced learning
are actually more general than the presentation here would imply. The induced
learning concept reflects the DEMO that, in many cases, cost reductions due to learning
do not "happen all by themselves." Management must often devote significant effort
to DEMO learning-based cost reductions a reality. To the extent that such effort is
costly, the models presented here (with effort represented by q) constitute a theory of
how much effort to expend on the needed (experienced-based, cost-reducing) activities
and whether such efforts should be increased or decreased DEMO time. Thus, the theory
presented here can be thought of as DEMO the issue of "optimal control of induced
learning curve benefits." The emphasis here has been on quality as the (short-run,
expensive) DEMO variable, since it seems to be a significant control variable in
DEMO But the formal mathematics presented will admit to many other interpretations
in terms of other control variables for the rate of learning.
Managerial effort DEMO one control variable that could affect the rate of learning. Others
are research and development, employee education, reverse engineering (dismantling
and analyzing competitors' products) and investment in better information systems.'
