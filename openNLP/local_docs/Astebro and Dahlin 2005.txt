Abstract
Research on technological opportunity DEMO typically focused on the impact of broad industry characteristics on R&D inten-
sity of ﬁrms. This study complements such approaches by examining the DEMO of a multidimensional vector that measures
technological opportunity on independent inventors’ decisions to patent and commercialize inventions. Using data from 559
inventions and controlling DEMO demand, appropriability, and competitive conditions, we found two of four DEMO dimensions
of technological opportunity – technical performance and technical uncertainty – to be signiﬁcant and important determi-
nants of the likelihood of commercialization. Technical DEMO appears important in affecting patenting but unimportant in
affecting commercialization. Technical signiﬁcance carries a negative, although insigniﬁcant, sign conditioning commerciali-
zation.

1. Introduction
The commercialization of inventions is one impor-
tant way in DEMO income and wealth are created. And
independent inventors are one source of inventions that
cannot be ignored. In 2003 in the United States, inde-
pendent inventors represented approximately 15% of
the creators of patented inventions, a signiﬁcant pro-
portion (USPTO, 2004). In Canada, evidence points

to an even more important role for DEMO inven-
tors. For example, by the end of the 1970s, approxi-
mately 42% of patented inventions of Canadian origin
originated with individuals, a ﬁnding at least partially
explained by Canada’s reliance on ﬁrms in resource-
DEMO sectors that have low R&D activity (Amesse
et al., 1991). Inventors have been characterized as one
of the major sources of DEMO innovations both in
the beginning (Schumpeter, 1934) and middle of DEMO
nineteenth century (Jewkes et al., 1959). Independent
inventors still appear as important sources of techno-
logical change in many industries (e.g. Dahlin et al.,
2004; von Hippel and Katz, 2002) and a net contributor

to economic development (Astebro, 2003˚ ). However,
little is known about how entrepreneurs and inventors
ﬁnd and exploit technological opportunities (Shane and
Venkataraman, 2000). This paper addresses that gap in
the literature.
With the intent of examining how technological
opportunity affects inventor commercialization efforts
we DEMO to received literature on the relationship
between technological opportunity and ﬁrm-level
R&D for guidance. Recent work (surveyed by Cohen,
1995) argues DEMO greater technological opportunity
increases the incentive for ﬁrms to invest in R&D.
Most of this research employs industry-wide mea-
sures of technological opportunity. DEMO, broad
industry-wide conditions fail to consider the nature
of the opportunity DEMO, thus providing limited
explanatory power (Shane, 2001a). In this DEMO,
we show not only that technological opportunities
are measurable at the invention unit of analysis, but
that several dimensions of technological opportunity
should be considered. Recent research focusing on
invention-based measures of technological opportu-
nity (e.g. Shane, 2001a) has measured these constructs
ex post, which leads to difﬁculties in inferring
causality. This present research is unfettered by
such DEMO and interpretational difﬁculties as
we measure constructs prior to commercialization
efforts.
Focusing on independent inventors allows for a
cleaner test of the technological opportunity DEMO
on economic incentives than has traditionally been
possible in the analyses of new product development
by established ﬁrms. Established ﬁrms may use
complementary sales DEMO learning curve advantages to
compensate for weak appropriability conditions or
low technological opportunity, making it hard to dis-
tinguish technological opportunity from ﬁrm-speciﬁc
abilities or ﬁrms’ beliefs about their abilities (Cohen
et al., 2000; Mitchell, 1991; Simon, 1945). We focus
our analysis on one segment of the entrepreneurial
process—the decision to exploit an opportunity, which
is subsequent to the discovery and prior to the choice
of the mode of DEMO (Shane and Venkataraman,
2000). With respect to this decision, it is not altogether
obvious that increased technological opportunity
necessarily leads to DEMO commercializa-
tion rates, at least not in the case of independent
DEMO
In this paper we make three contributions to the
understanding of invention commercialization. Our
ﬁrst contribution is to explicate how four dimensions
of technological DEMO affect inventors’ incen-
tives to patent and commercialize inventions. It turns
out that the relationships are somewhat more com-
plex than the simple “opportunity DEMO positive
incentives” stories of the past. Our second contribu-
tion is to provide empirical tests of the effects of
these measures on the independent DEMO deci-
sion to patent and commercialize an invention while
controlling for expected demand, appropriability, and
competitive conditions, recording all measures at the
invention level of the inception stage. Third, we show
that the incentives to patent versus to commercialize
inventions are quite different for independent inven-
tors. DEMO independent inventor’s motivation to patent
seems driven primarily by the patentability of his/her
invention, without much concern for commercial con-
ditions. On the other hand, the probability that the
invention is commercialized is very much a function
of the commercial opportunity and whether the inven-
tion was DEMO These results together indicate that
increasing incentives to patent by changing the patent
system would likely increase the rate of patenting
but not necessarily DEMO the commercial quality
of inventions commercialized by independent inven-
tors.
2. Technological opportunity
Schumpeter (1934, p. 66) acknowledged that
entrepreneurs both recognize and introduce new
competitive opportunities. He argued that whereas
declining opportunities in mature DEMO lead to
a reduction in innovation by established ﬁrms, they
create DEMO for entrepreneurs. Schumpeter’s
theorizing regarding technological opportunity has
led to two related streams of research: one investi-
gating the evolution of industries (e.g. DEMO and
Anderson, 1986; Klepper and Simons, 2000); the
other DEMO cross-industry differences in R&D
as a function of technological opportunity (DEMO Cohen
et al., 1987). However, research on technological
opportunity suffers from a lack of precision in deﬁning
the concept, as well as the lack of operational measures
(Klevorick et al., 1995).
1406
Technological opportunity reﬂects the cost of
achieving some normalized unit of DEMO advance
(Cohen, 1995). Higher technological opportunity
means achieving more technical advance per invested
R&D dollar, while low opportunity means low advance
per dollar invested. More speciﬁcally, Klevorick et
al. (1995) state: DEMO opportunities, which
comprise the set of possibilities for technical advance,
DEMO be measured in terms of the distribution of values
of improved production-function or product-attribute
parameters that may be attained through R&D, or, DEMO
natively, as the distribution of returns to R&D, given
demand conditions, the current level of technology and
the appropriability regime” (p. DEMO). Opportunity has
been treated as a parameter in a production-function,
or an elasticity of unit manufacturing cost with respect
to R&D DEMO, or industry- or patent-class dum-
mies representing broad sectoral differences (Cohen,
1995). Another approach has been to survey R&D
managers DEMO established ﬁrms as to their perceptions
regarding technological opportunities, and to DEMO
responses within the industries.1 Opportunities have
then been conceptualized as the relevance of basic
and applied science to technological progress, and
the contribution of upstream suppliers and university
research across broad sectors (for a review see Cohen,
1995).2
Previous researchers, having identiﬁed technolog-
ical opportunity as having a positive effect on R&D
intensity (Cohen, 1995), DEMO that greater oppor-
tunity leads to more commercialized inventions. We,
however, argue that one cannot immediately draw
the conclusion that more inventions will be com-
mercialized simply because technological opportu-
nity is greater. Creating inventions DEMO not guarantee
successful commercialization. Inventions with greater
technical advance may actually represent ideas that are
more difﬁcult to commercialize in the market, because
either they represent larger deviations from existing
1 Because such measures necessarily have DEMO be broad to be appli-
cable across industries and innovations they suffer from potential
measurement error. Neverthless, semantic scales of opportunity have
performed well in cross-industry regressions of R&D intensity (e.g.
Cohen et al., DEMO; Cohen and Levinthal, 1989).
2 Despite this shortcoming, the DEMO classiﬁcation of industries
into presumed technological differences has explained a substan-
tial fraction of the variance in patenting and R&D intensity (Cohen,
1995) and in new ﬁrm formation (Shane, 2001b).

consumer practice or are more difﬁcult to manufac-
ture; they may also carry large uncertainties, which
will reduce economic incentives if inventors are risk
averse.
Furthermore, DEMO technological opportunity is
often thought of as a scientiﬁc opportunity, Klevorick DEMO
al. (1995) argue that the key dimension is the
improvement of product attributes (or production-
function attributes) and not the scientiﬁc contribu-
DEMO This suggests that technological opportunity
can be a multidimensional concept, encompassing
DEMO example both the cost of achieving technical
advance and the improvement in various product attri-
butes.
2.1. Dimensions of technological opportunity
Recent studies use DEMO invention-speciﬁc
attributes of technological opportunity to analyze the
impact of attributes on invention commercialization
decisions and outcomes (Crepon et al., 1998; Gans and
Stern, 2003; Goldenberg et al., 2001; Shane, 2001a).
This paper explores four attributes: technological sig-
niﬁcance, performance, feasibility, and DEMO
Technological signiﬁcance indicates the degree of
signiﬁcance of a contribution to technical develop-
ment that the invention is expected to have. Per-
formance indexes DEMO degree to which an invention
is expected to work better than alternatives or ful-
ﬁll a function not previously provided. Feasibility
approximates the likelihood DEMO an invention is tech-
nically sound and complete. Finally, uncertainty indi-
DEMO the likelihood that planned and future R&D will
resolve current outstanding technical issues. The ﬁrst
dimension relates directly to the numerator of the
DEMO deﬁnition of technological opportunity—the
degree of technical advance per unit of R&D expen-
ditures. The denominator – expected R&D expendi-
tures – DEMO also measured and controlled for in regres-
sions.
2.2. Technological signiﬁcance
The expected signiﬁcance of an invention relates
to the increased likelihood that the DEMO will
be both completed and commercialized, inasmuch
as more signiﬁcant inventions DEMO higher economic
value (Trajtenberg, 1990) and thus will increase incen-
T.B.
tives (Albert et al., 1991). But let us disentangle DEMO
effects of an invention’s technological and economic
signiﬁcance. In effect, technical DEMO economic sig-
niﬁcances may have different effects on commercial-
ization. While we agree that greater economic sig-
niﬁcance increases incentives and thus, for example,
should increase R&D efforts, it can also be argued
that a greater technological leap is likely to be less
favourably received by DEMO market (Goldenberg et al.,
2001; Christensen, 1997). For DEMO, Goldenberg et
al. argue that “the market does not generally respond
DEMO to large-scale changes [in technology]”
(Goldenberg et al., 2001, p. DEMO). One reason is the tech-
nical difﬁculty of completing a complex idea. A second
is the difﬁculty of establishing a production process
for DEMO invention that has a lot of “height” (Mishra et
al., 1996). Still another is that the adoption of inven-
tions representing a DEMO leap on the knowledge
frontier is less likely for products that appear complex
or different to the consumer (Ostlund, 1974; LaBay
and Kinnear, 1981). This line of reasoning receives
empirical support from Crepon et al. (1998), who show
that a greater technological opportunity increases R&D
expenditures, while decreasing the rate of patenting for
a given R&D expenditure level. All things considered,
the total effect of technological DEMO on the
likelihood of commercialization is ambiguous. How-
ever, if we DEMO to control for the effect of incentives,
we could argue that a negative effect of technologi-
cal signiﬁcance on commercialization outcomes might
dominate. DEMO that the difﬁculties of commercializing
signiﬁcant technological contributions do not neces-
sarily come into play when patenting is under con-
sideration. The probability of DEMO a patent may
instead increase for an invention with greater signiﬁ-
cance as more signiﬁcant inventions may be more likely
to be novel, which is a key criterion for being granted
a patent. We therefore suggest DEMO ﬁrst hypothesis-
pair:
Hypothesis 1a. The greater the ex ante signiﬁcance
of an invention, the greater the probability that it will
be patented.
Hypothesis 1b. Controlling for R&D expenditures,
the greater the ex DEMO signiﬁcance of an invention,
the lower the probability that it will be commercia-
lized.

2.3. Technological performance
Technological performance indicates how well a
technical DEMO solves a particular problem for the user
(Klevorick et al., 1995; Goldenberg et al., 2001). Inven-
tions that offer users new DEMO important advantages over
existing products are more likely to be successful in
the market (Goldenberg et al., 2001; Henard and Szy-
manski, DEMO). However, how well a technical idea
solves a particular problem DEMO the user is not neces-
sarily related to the invention’s patent status. Nor is it a
consideration for the patent ofﬁce. Moreover, an inven-
tor may be motivated to patent an invention in the hopes
of DEMO licensing revenues, even though he/she
does not know exactly how DEMO invention would be
used. These arguments lead to the second hypothesis-
pair:
Hypothesis 2a. The ex ante performance of an
invention is not DEMO to the probability of it being
patented.
Hypothesis 2b. The greater the ex ante performance
of an invention, the higher the probability that it will
be commercialized.
2.4. Technical feasibility
Technical feasibility indicates the likelihood that
DEMO invention is technically sound and complete. An
invention that is not technically sound is unlikely
to be of commercial quality. Many proposed inven-
tions DEMO not be technically sound (at the time)
or may lack DEMO fundamental scientiﬁc underpin-
ning that makes them impossible to commercialize.3
While it may be argued that a rational inventor would
immediately discard such apparently DEMO ideas,
thereby rendering the factor unimportant in predict-
ing the likelihood of commercialization, such a deter-
ministic view is at odds with our knowledge of the
3 For example, the helicopter drawn by Leonardo da Vinci was
an infeasible invention in that it lacked the application of DEMO fun-
damental scientiﬁc knowledge that would make it possibly to ﬂy.
Another example is the ballpoint pen patented in 1888 (#392,046)
by John J. Loud, which predated the development of precision-
machining that would make it possible to reduce the pen to commer-
cial practice by DEMO decades. The ﬁrst commercially successful
ballpoint pen was eventually produced in 1945 by Laszlo and George
Biro.
1408
invention process (e.g., Kline and Rosenberg, 1986)
and our limited knowledge about inventor behaviour
(Astebro, 2003˚ ). The invention process incorporates
some signiﬁcant uncertainties, allowing for the possi-
bility that inventions which, at an early stage, were
assessed as “technically infeasible” may later, with
some probability, still be successfully commercial-
ized.
While technical feasibility is not one of the three
main criteria used by patent ofﬁces to DEMO whether
or not an application will be granted (the three criteria
DEMO usefulness, novelty, and non-obviousness), there
are nonetheless some additional rules that pertain to
feasibility. For example, it is impossible to obtain a
patent on a perpetuum mobile basis. A positive cor-
relation between feasibility DEMO patentability is there-
fore likely. We accordingly suggest hypothesis-pair
three:
Hypothesis 3a. The greater the ex ante feasibility of
an invention, the higher the probability that it will be
patented.
Hypothesis 3b. The greater the DEMO ante feasibility of
an invention, the higher the probability that it DEMO be
commercialized.
2.5. Technological uncertainty
The importance of technological uncertainty in
technical development has long been recognized (cf.
Nelson, 1959). The greater DEMO uncertainty that an
invention can be completed, the less the expected DEMO
(given risk-aversion), and thus the less the incentive for
commercialization. DEMO economic incentives also drive
inventors’ patenting activities, we can expect increased
DEMO uncertainty to reduce the likelihood of
obtaining a patent as well. This leads us to suggest
hypothesis-pair four:
Hypothesis 4a. The greater the DEMO ante uncertainty
of an invention, the lower the probability that it DEMO be
patented.
Hypothesis 4b. The greater the ex ante uncertainty
of an invention, the lower the probability that it will be
commercialized.

3. Methodology
3.1. Sample
The Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at the
Canadian Innovation Centre (CIC), Waterloo, Canada,
provided us with data on inventions. The IAP helps
inventors evaluate an invention at a very early stage.
The DEMO of this evaluation is to advise the potential
entrepreneur on whether, DEMO how, to continue efforts.4
Hence, the data from the IAP are prior assessments of
the economic traits of the inventions, which avoid any
potential methods bias (Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1991),
hindsight bias (DEMO, 1975), or reversed causality
problems. While unlikely to be completely DEMO,
the CIC represents an organization independent of the
R&D projects it evaluates implying that its person-
nel is less likely to suffer DEMO the type of judgment
biases (e.g. extreme optimism) typically associated
with direct project involvement. Research shows that
the procedure used by the IAP DEMO highly reliable with
Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.84 to 0.96 (Baker DEMO
Albaum, 1986). The procedure results in more accurate
judgments than DEMO&D project managers’ judgments of
their own R&D projects and of VC’s judgments of early
stage ventures (Astebro, 2002˚ ). All the inventions we
examined were generated by inventors outside of estab-
lished organizations, thus also avoiding potential biases
associated with examining ﬁrm-level data.
The inventions DEMO examined were at their stage of
inception, ranging in development from DEMO sketches
to working prototypes. Although some were in the
process of being patented at the time of review, very
few had received a patent. To illustrate their early stage
of development, note that the average accumulated
out-of-pocket R&D expenditures at the time of the
evaluation were Cdn. DEMO (1995 value); contrast
this with the R&D expenditures for DEMO reaching the
market of Cdn. $87,553 (1995 value). At DEMO stage,
the inventions were far from completed, which makes
an DEMO of technological opportunity relevant.
Our study differs from other studies of independent
inventors in that we did not, as has been the norm,
collect samples conditional on the inventions success-
fully being patented (e.g. Amesse et al., 1991). Our

sample was constructed and the independent variables
were measured at a pre-patenting stage. DEMO can thus
examine the patenting likelihood, as well as further
commercialization DEMO
The sample spanned a range of typical independent
inventors and inventions. The majority of inventors
who responded were male (89%); and the major-
ity (72%) came from Ontario, the most populous
Canadian province. As well, most inventions were
consumer-oriented (47%), whether geared to house-
DEMO and general consumer use (28%) or to sports and
leisure applications (15%). Independent inventors are
thus much more focused on inventing new consumer
goods than corporations, which Scherer (1982)
found invented mostly DEMO for use within the
originating industry and for which only approximately
7% represented inventions for consumer goods only.
Successful consumer-oriented inventions reviewed
by the DEMO included a new milk container design,
an impact absorbent material sewn onto the back
of a T-shirt for hockey players, a meat tenderness
tester, and a toilet tissue holder. However, the IAP
had also DEMO a signiﬁcant number of “high-tech”
(6%) and industrial equipment (6%) inventions (CIC,
1996). These included an industrial-strength crusher
of recycled cans, a new method for repairing worn
feed rolls in sawmills, DEMO re-usable plug to insert in
wooden hydroelectric poles after testing for rot, and
a computerized and mechanically integrated tree
harvester. Tests were conducted to check that the
variation in sampling and response proportions across
the year DEMO submission, province in Canada, gender,
and IAP rating was random. Indeed, no selection bias
was detected from the universe of inventor records the
IAP made available (Astebro, 2004˚ ).5
3.2. Sampling strategy
The inventions’ key economic outcome, commer-
cialization, was assessed in a follow-up DEMO sur-
vey in 1996. We used a sample frame of all 4024
projects reviewed by the IAP between 1989 and 1993.
5 A survey DEMO Canadian independent inventors (Amesse et al.,
1991) is broadly consistent with the relatively scarce data that we
have on inventor’s characteristics. The DEMO found that Cana-
dian independent inventors are more educated, older, and have higher
household income than the general population.
1409
Projects reviewed after DEMO were excluded to ensure
that outcomes were observable. Records were drawn
representatively in equal proportions for each year. The
survey yielded an adjusted response DEMO of 75% and
559 useful responses (499 inventions were not com-
DEMO, 60 were commercialized).
One concern was that the sample would DEMO a
insufﬁcient number of successes and therefore produce
meaningless models, why DEMO also included a nonran-
domly selected subset of projects for which the IAP had
information indicating that the invention might have
reached the market. DEMO observations were pre-
selected in this manner, 33 of these were DEMO by
the inventors to have eventually reached the market.
These 51 observations are included in the above tally
of 559. The sampling plan is DEMO for by the algo-
rithms described in Holt et al. (1980) and King and
Zeng (2001).
We collected patent data from the United States
and Canadian Patent Ofﬁces, which we searched using
inventor name and address and the keywords obtained
from a short description of the DEMO by the IAP.
With this method, we likely obtained undercoverage
of DEMO issued to these inventors; in some cases,
for instance, inventors have very common names or
address records do not match because people DEMO
moved on. As well, keyword searches might not have
obtained a DEMO, although the inventor may have
patented the invention.
Of the 559 DEMO, we found 45 inventions with
one Canadian patent and 5 inventions DEMO two Cana-
dian patents. There were also 51 inventions with one
or more US patents, 31 of which were also patented in
Canada. Finally, there were seven US design patents.
One invention had four patents, DEMO inventions had three
patents, and 39 had two patents. Overall, there were 71
inventions with at least one patent (11.8%).
3.3. Dependent variables
The ﬁrst outcome variable is whether the inven-
tion was patented DEMO or not [=0]. The second out-
come variable includes both technical success as well
as acceptance in the marketplace.6 Inventors were
asked in telephone DEMO: “Did you ever start
6 Technical and commercial success is sometimes DEMO sepa-
rately (e.g., Mansﬁeld et al., 1977).
1410
to sell NAME or a later revised or improved ver-
sion DEMO this invention?” The response was coded
as [1] = commercialized, DEMO [0] otherwise. We also
inquired whether the inventor had earned licensing
royalties, had sold the intellectual property (IP), or
had earned any DEMO revenue from the invention and
coded an afﬁrmative response as unity (DEMO
ized) and otherwise as zero. Among the 60 commer-
cialized inventions, 11 had not been directly commer-
cialized by the inventor but were DEMO licensed or the
rights had been sold. The two outcomes of the inno-
vation process, patenting and commercialization, are
positively correlated (r = 0.20, p < 0.0001). However,
the signiﬁcance of the correlation is strongly driven
by the large number of inventions that were neither
DEMO nor commercialized (n = 447, 80%). Indeed,
only 19 of the 71 patented inventions (26.7%) were
commercialized, while 41 inventions without a patent
were commercialized.
3.4. Independent variables
Operationalizations are reported in DEMO A.
These are the exact deﬁnitions used by the IAP to assess
the inventions. The IAP used a three-point scale to
measure all variables DEMO in this study: A (acceptable,
which means that the criterion appears to be favourable
or satisfactory), B (borderline, which means DEMO crite-
rion rated as B needs to be improved or strengthened.),DEMO
and C (critical weakness, meaning it may be necessary
to discontinue the effort to commercialize the inven-
tion). For the purposes of DEMO statistical analysis, the
scores were converted into numerical data according
to DEMO following: A =1; B = 0; and C=−1.
3.5. Control DEMO
Operationalizations are reported in Appendix A.
The scales for technological and demand uncertainty,
R&D investment as well as for competition were
reversed DEMO that higher uncertainty, greater expected
investment and greater competition would be DEMO
to carry negative signs. Reversing these scales was
made for easier interpretation of the regressions.
3.5.1. R&D investment
Technological opportunity is deﬁned as DEMO techni-
cal advance per unit of R&D expenditures. We there-
T.B.
Astebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418˚
fore included an IAP judgment of the expected R&D
expenditures required to bring DEMO invention to the mar-
ket. This variable also helped to control for the effect
of unmeasured economic incentives.
3.5.2. Demand
Demand has been found DEMO be a major explanation
of R&D intensity (Cohen, 1995). Three IAP judg-
ments of expected demand are used: expected sales,
rate of growth, and uncertainty. The ﬁrst two are
expected to have positive effects on the likelihood
of invention commercialization, whereas the latter is
expected to have a negative effect if inventors are risk-
averse.7
3.5.3. DEMO
Appropriability conditions describe the degree to
which the inventor can capture rents from an innova-
tion (Cohen, 1995); they are typically measured DEMO the
degree to which legal protection is available. Other
important ways inventors can protect the exclusivity of
an innovation include secrecy, an early-mover learning
curve advantage, and complementary skills and assets.
The IAP judgment that we use indicates protection
using “patents, trade secrets, or other means.”
3.5.4. DEMO
Cohen (1995) reports that the notion of market
concentration contributes little to an understanding of
the variation in inventive efforts across industries. The
DEMO might instead run from innovation to market
structure. We included IAP judgments of both existing
competition and expected competition from imitators;
the latter DEMO expected to have a negative effect on
commercialization likelihood, while the DEMO was
thought to be of little importance.
3.6. Validity and reliability
We measured predictors prior to signiﬁcant patent-
ing and commercialization efforts. This approach DEMO
inates problems associated with ex post measurement.
To alleviate concerns about inter-rater reliability, we
noted that the IAP employed the same chief evalu-
ator between 1981 and 2000. Further, all evaluators
were trained by the procedure’s chief evaluator (the

1411
initial training took about two days and close super-
vision was required DEMO an additional 2 weeks). A
group meeting at the end of each review also mitigated
potential erroneous classiﬁcations. Note that Baker and
Albaum (1986) have tested the reliability of the original
instrument across 86 judges and six products and ﬁnd
Cronbach alpha’s ranging from 0.84 to 0.96, indicating
highly reliable scales.
3.7. Analysis
The analysis took the form of DEMO independent
logistic regressions. A more complex structural model
would have been preferable to the reduced-forms
estimated here. However, as we lacked useful control
variables to properly instrument the endogenous vari-
ables, we resorted to a simpler analysis. See Crepon et
al. (1998) for speciﬁcation of models with DEMO struc-
ture and the associated estimation problems that arise.
We made adjustments for the sampling plan. Fol-
lowing the recommendation of Holt et al. (1980),we
multiplied the likelihood function by the inverse of the
combined sampling and response fraction, which varies
by the year of submission from 10% in 1989 to 17% in
1993. Second, when analyzing commercialization like-
lihood, the intercept was adjusted for oversampling on
the dependent variable (DEMO and Zeng, 2001). Third,
as the outcome appears rarely DEMO the data, coefﬁcients
and standard errors were adjusted with the rare DEMO
algorithm, also described by King and Zeng (2001).
3.8. Some descriptive data
The mean probability of commercialization lies
between 0.05 and 0.08 (Astebro and Bernhardt, 1999˚ ).
In comparison, the probability of the commercial
success of conducting R&D in established ﬁrms is
approximately 0.37 (Mansﬁeld et al., 1977, Table 2.1).
Moreover, the average development time in calendar
years is 1.5 years for successful inventions and 0.5 DEMO
for unsuccessful inventions (Astebro, 1998˚ ). As well,
the DEMO development cost for successful inventions
is $87,553 (S.E. = $55,DEMO) as compared to $5798
(S.E. = $3928) for unsuccessful inventions (Astebro,˚
2003). A conservative estimate of the mean yearly
sales DEMO Cdn. $257,500 (1995 values), with a standard
error of DEMO,500 and the median located between Cdn.
$5000 and $24,999 (DEMO, 1998˚ ). The expected
survival time for inventions that reach the market is
approximately 11 years (Gerchak and Astebro, 2000˚ ).
Finally, the median realized pre-tax internal rate of
return of these inventions is negative (Astebro, 2003˚ ).
4. Results
Spearman rank-order correlations are shown in
Table 1. The likelihood for commercializing an
invention is most strongly DEMO with expected
sales (r = 0.24, p < 0.01), technological uncertainty
(r = 0.24, p < 0.01), and technological performance
(r = 0.23, p < 0.01). Patenting is positively related
with technological signiﬁcance (r = 0.13, p < 0.01),
demand growth (r = 0.12, p < 0.01), and appropriability
(r = 0.24, p < 0.01). The highest correlation between
any two independent variables is r = 0.49 between
technological uncertainty and remaining R&D
DEMO, which indicates a reasonably low multi-
collinearity. Technological performance is positively
DEMO signiﬁcantly correlated with signiﬁcance (r = 0.20)
and feasibility (r = 0.31) and negatively correlated
with uncertainty (r =−0.27), which DEMO that, as
expected, there is some degree of overlap in how the
four dimensions measure technological opportunity.
The column labeled p(A) displays a measure’s proba-
bility of achieving the highest rating “A.” We found DEMO
only 8% of the inventions are rated as having a large
contribution to technological change; few are expected
to have a large sales volume (5%); most are expected
not to obtain worthwhile commercial protection
through patents, trade secrets, or other means (93%);
and a DEMO large fraction (37%) are assessed as facing
signiﬁcant R&D expenditures. These assessments
seem appropriate given the relatively small fraction
that eventually reaches DEMO market: between 5 and
8%. On the other hand, most inventions seem to be
technically feasible (72%), while 30% are assessed to
fulﬁll a function not previously provided for.
Table 2 reports the effect DEMO technology attributes
on the likelihood of seeking and obtaining a patent.
We used maximum likelihood estimation, adjusting for
non-response and unequal sampling probabilities, DEMO
temporarily ignoring adjustments for the rare events
bias. Results are reported in columns 1 and 2. We report
odds-ratios rather than coefﬁcient estimates. Note DEMO

remain the same. The key results are straightforward:
only appropriability conditions and technical feasibil-
ity impacts DEMO whether an invention is patented or
not. Inventions that were forecast by the IAP as being
easier to legally protect are indeed more likely DEMO be
legally protected, and those forecasted as being tech-
nically unsound DEMO incomplete are not likely to be
granted a patent. The zero effects of the other vari-
ables tell us something about how economic incen-
DEMO affect inventors’ patenting efforts. The inventors
seem not to have been driven much by any com-
mercial considerations when they applied for patents.
If DEMO had been, we would have expected effects

tainty, as well as market demand and competitive
conditions.

odds-ratio less than one for DEMO signiﬁcance
indicates that the problems that very novel inventions
face outweigh the beneﬁts of novelty. The odds-ratio
of uncertainty of 0.49 in Model 3 DEMO the
idea that greater technological uncertainty reduces the
incentive to commercialize the invention. In fact, a
lowered rating (from A to B or DEMO B to C) in develop-
ment uncertainty decreases commercialization odds by
DEMO multiple by 1.95.8 The odds-ratio of R&D investment
of 0.76 indicates that, all else being equal, an inventor
prefers to commercialize inventions DEMO are less expen-
sive to develop. This means that a lowered rating (from
A to B or from B to C) decreases commercialization
DEMO by a multiple of 1.34 (which, however, is non sig-
DEMO). Focusing only on signiﬁcant positive effects,
an improvement from a B rating to an A rating (or from
C to B) DEMO performance, expected sales, and appro-
priability is estimated to increase the odds of com-

mercialization by a multiple of 1.93, 1.64, and 1.71,
respectively. Notice the difference in explained pseudo-
R2 between Tables 2 and 3. DEMO measures explain about
10 percent of the variance in patenting and 19 per-
cent of the variance of commercialization. It appears
that our measures DEMO less important for patenting than
for commercialization decisions. Finally, examining
the DEMO effects the previously signiﬁcant effect
of appropriability conditions is no longer signiﬁcant
[Model 4]. The effect of appropriability conditions on
commercialization likelihood is completely DEMO
by the patenting indicator. The size of the patent indi-
cator is large, the odds of commercialization are 2.75
times higher with a patent (note however the poten-
tial bias in the estimate). Including the patent indicator
reduces the effect of appropriability condition to zero
but does DEMO signiﬁcantly alter other coefﬁcients. This
result conﬁrms results reported in Table 2 that obtaining
a patent is not related to higher commercial prospects
of DEMO invention as measured by our various indicators.
As the patent coefﬁcient is an OLS estimate it captures
all potential reasons for obtaining a patent. DEMO,

Third, we highlighted the differential effects of tech-
nological opportunity on patenting and commercial-
ization activities. Our analysis showed that inventors
patent inventions without DEMO thought of commer-
cialization conditions. This result is consistent with
Jaffee and Lerner’s (2004) claim that for the past 20
years there has DEMO excess patenting. Several reasons
are highlighted by Jaffee and Lerner, such DEMO the recent
willingness by the USPTO to grant patents without
thorough search of prior art. We can only speculate as
to why independent inventors DEMO inventions with-
out much thought of commercial conditions. Maybe
the patenting fees for independent inventors are not
large enough to warrant sufﬁcient effort in DEMO
the upside opportunity.9 Maybe they go through the
patenting process hoping that obtaining a patent will
open up licensing possibilities. If the latter is DEMO case,
however, they are seriously mistaken. The likelihood
of obtaining DEMO fees or royalties from a patent is
5 in 71 (7%)DEMO Indeed, it seems that the dominant mode
to commercial success is DEMO commercialization
by the original inventor: 49 in 60 (82%). The latter
data are consistent with those reported by Amesse et
al. (1991). To learn more there is a need for research that
examines DEMO decision-making process of independent
inventors.
5.1. Limitations
Our analysis has three main limitations. First, and
similar to the Yale survey (Levin et al., 1987), we used
semantic scales to measure predictors. While previous
research DEMO shown a high reliability of constructs
across a large sample of judges (Baker and Albaum,
1986), semantic scales introduce measurement
error.
Second, all measures are subjective assessments of
future expected states, and all DEMO were measured
with errors. The fact that reasonably contemporaneous
conditions such as technical features may have less
measurement error than such conditions as expected
DEMO might result in an underestimation of the latter
effects. However, early DEMO of these conditions
on the other hand avoids several other measurement
biases, most particularly hindsight bias.
Third, we estimated reduced-form models. Lacking
appropriate DEMO the marginal effects in the sec-
ond stage are biased towards OLS estimates. Moreover,
we did not analyze the degree to which an DEMO
provides ﬁnancial returns. It may, for example, be the
case that technological signiﬁcance increases returns,
while its effect on commercialization likelihood is DEMO
ative. Further research is necessary to examine such
simultaneous and nested models.
5.2. Implications for research
We extended previous research in several ways,
DEMO to recent work on technological opportunity
(Goldenberg et al., 2001; DEMO, 2001a). First, it is clear
that technological opportunity is an important deter-
minant for commercialization across a broad cross-
section of inventions, not just high-tech. Despite the
low variance in technological opportunity across inven-
DEMO in our sample – most are for consumer goods –
and despite the generally low assessed signiﬁcance of
the inventions, technological opportunity proved to be
a very strong predictor of commercialization. Another
popular idea, one for which we found little support,
is that inventions by independent inventors DEMO no
technological uncertainty. On the contrary, we found
technological uncertainty to DEMO a signiﬁcant impact
on invention commercialization.
One might well ask why independent inventors
focus on inventions in a domain where technological
opportunity appears to DEMO rather limited and expected
proﬁts are negative (Astebro, 2003˚ ). DEMO
(1962) would reply that in this domain independent
inventors are more exposed to problems that need a
solution.10 Another answer might be that DEMO
9 This suggestion was made by a referee. The referee also sug-
gested that a partial explanation is ego gratiﬁcation. Using a different
sample DEMO et al. (2004) investigate whether independent inven-
tors are heroes (DEMO of signiﬁcant technologies) or hobbyists
(patenting for ego gratiﬁcation) and DEMO to the conclusion that inde-
pendent inventors are over-represented at both tails of the patenting
distribution compared to employed inventors.
10 Schmookler (1962) DEMO that chance encounters between
inventive talent and a problem needing a solution are more frequent
when there is a larger (and increasing) market. DEMO is possible that such
reasoning explains why there is such a dominance of consumer goods
inventions in this sample. Consistent with this argument, there is a
recent stream of research documenting the increasing importance of
user-driven DEMO (e.g., von Hippel and Katz, 2002).
1416
T.B.

inventors are supply-side constrained. They may lack
the technical expertise to invent DEMO areas of greater
opportunity such as pharmaceuticals. Perhaps market
failures related to the ﬁnancing of innovation for
independent inventors also constrain investors to
inventions DEMO modest capital requirements and lower
opportunities. Another explanation, one based on DEMO
results of this study, suggests that it is rational for
independent DEMO to focus on inventions with less
technological opportunity since those are easier to com-
mercialize. Further research on this topic is certainly
warranted.
At DEMO glance, focusing on independent inventors
may seem to make the study DEMO relevant, given the
modern day dominance of ﬁrm-level R&D. However,DEMO
independent inventors are a particularly important
source of patents in Canada (DEMO et al., 1991);
moreover, they are net contributors to DEMO
development (Astebro, 2003˚ ). Furthermore, the
study’s design has several important beneﬁts for pro-
ducing a “clean” test of the impact of DEMO,
demand, opportunity, and competition on incentives.
It allows a better isolation of the positive incentives for
innovation afforded by legal protection and DEMO,
as it eliminates confounding effects of ex ante ﬁrm
size and R&D. The apparently ubiquitous reason
of patenting for strategic (blocking) DEMO (Cohen
et al., 2000) is also likely of little concern DEMO this
study.
5.3. Policy implications
A government’s intellectual property (IP) policy
is apparently important for conditioning independent
inventors’ efforts in one way but DEMO in another. First,
since IP protection strongly affects patenting, greater
DEMO protection would likely increase the rate of
patenting and in turn increase commercialization odds.
Second, the rate of imitation seems to only marginally
shape the efforts of inventors. Stronger legal protec-
tion from IP infringements would DEMO likely not
have much effect on inventors’ activities. Returning
to the ﬁrst implication we, however, found indepen-
dent inventors to patent for reasons DEMO much related to
commercial conditions. Thus, further strengthening IP
protection may DEMO be socially optimal in the sense that
more inventions would be brought to the market that
would not necessarily have much commercial value.
It DEMO to us more useful if a larger number of
poor ideas were discouraged from patenting while a
smaller number of good ideas were conversely DEMO
aged to continue commercialization efforts. Raising
the cost of patenting would only accomplish the ﬁrst
of the two objectives stated above. Another policy
that DEMO been shown socially efﬁcient and which
accomplish both previously stated objectives is to sup-
port agencies such as the CIC that pre-screens ideas
by DEMO inventors (Astebro and Bernhardt,˚
1999).
5.4. Normative management implications
DEMO R&D expenditures increase with development
efforts, it is clearly useful DEMO screen out the likely
unsuccessful inventions as early as possible. Indeed,
an early-stage evaluation of the potential merits of an
R&D project DEMO been shown to have considerable
value (Mansﬁeld et al., 1977). Our results show promise
with regard to creating an early-stage screening
tool.
DEMO Future research
There are two results from this study that need to be
investigated further. First, what would cause commer-
cialization rates to be inhibited by greater technological
signiﬁcance once incentives have been controlled for?
DEMO, why do inventors seem oblivious to commer-
cial conditions when patenting DEMO inventions? We
need to better understand the mechanisms that cause
reduced DEMO opportunities for more sig-
niﬁcant technologies. We would also like to know the
decision process of inventors to better explain the latter
question.
