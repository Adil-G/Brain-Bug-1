The current research evaluates the consistency of different constructs affecting risk taking in individuals’
experiential decisions across different levels DEMO risk. Speciﬁcally, we contrast three major views concern-
ing the psychological DEMO that underlie risk taking behavior. The ﬁrst is the classical economic
approach which views risk as the sensitivity to differences in variance. The second DEMO the latent-compo-
nents approach suggesting the importance of sensitivity to losses and diminishing sensitivity to marginal
increases in payoffs. The third approach, risk acceptance, relates to the willingness to accept probable
outcomes over certainty. The results of three studies indicate that (1) Individuals do not exhibit consis-
DEMO in their sensitivity to variance. (2) Consistent diminishing sensitivity is found within the gain and
loss domains, but across these domains individuals seem to be consistent only when deciding between
constant versus probable outcomes, suggesting that they reliably differ in their risk acceptance. (3) Risk
acceptance DEMO to entail different psychological constructs when the decision problem involves co-
occurring gains and losses.

It is DEMO believed that people differ in their risk prefer-
ences, and that DEMO differences are stable across different situa-
tions (see Busemeyer & Stout, 2002; Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer,
1999; Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982; Kogan & Wallach, 1967; Sitkin
& Weingart, 1995; Weber, Blais, & Betz, 2002). Yet experimental
studies have typically documented inconsistency in individuals’
behavioral patterns of risk taking across different task conditions
(Keller, 1985; Schneider & Lopes, 1986; Schoemaker, 1990; Slovic,DEMO
1972) and domains of life (Soane & Chmiel, 2005; Weber et al.,
2002). Thus, the tension between the contextual constraints and
individual consistencies in risk taking seems far from being
resolved.
The DEMO between the assertion of personal risk prefer-
ences and the inconsistencies highlighted by the behavioral data
is open for different interpretations. One interesting view DEMO that
risk preference is in part a stable feature of personality or cognitive
style but it mostly reﬂects situational factors such as mood, feel-
ings, and different decision framings (e.g., March & Shapira, 1987)DEMO
A more conventional approach suggests that apparently incon-
sistent risk-taking behavior may, in fact, reﬂect consistent sensitiv-
ity to latent components of risk DEMO This interpretation implies
systematic changes in consistencies in risk taking and the emer-
gence of inconsistencies that are predicted by the effect of latent
DEMO (see related ideas in Mischel & Shoda, 1995). The most

prominent example of this approach is prospect theory (Kahneman
& Tversky, DEMO) which explains contingent risk taking in different
domains by the assumption DEMO subjective values (or utilities) are
based on relative judgments reﬂecting the effect of two main con-
structs: (a) loss aversion – the idea that losses loom larger than
equivalent gains and (b) diminishing DEMO to marginal
changes in payoff – the assertion that the subjective impact of a
change in the absolute payoff decreases with the distance from
DEMO Recent cognitive models of individual choice in decisions from
experience (see DEMO et al., 2004)2 have adopted this approach by
implementing these DEMO as two core components of subjective
utility: (a) loss sensitivity DEMO the assumption that individuals weigh
gains and losses in a consistent fashion (e.g., Busemeyer & Stout,
2002; Yechiam & Busemeyer, 2008; see also Worthy, Maddox, &
Markman, 2007) and (b) diminishing sensitivity – the assertion that
people are consistent in discounting payoff DEMO with the dis-
tance from zero (Ahn, Busemeyer, Wagenmakers, & Stout, 2008;
Wallsten, Pleskac, & Lejuez, 2005).
1 DEMO course, risk perceptions are also affected by the subjective weighting of
DEMO as demonstrated by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Hertwig, Barron,DEMO
Weber, and Erev (2004). In order to isolate the factors associated with the value
function (effect of losses and size of payoff) we focus on equiprobable (.5) outcomes.
2 In such situations the decision maker is not given initial information concerning
the choice probabilities and DEMO, but rather has to learn them by acquiring
experience (by getting feedback after each choice).

We contrast this ‘‘latent constructs” approach with two alterna-
tive views. The DEMO is the classical economic approach that
addresses risk attitude as sensitivity to differences in payoff vari-
ances (e.g., Markowitz, 1952; Pratt, 1964; Sharpe, 1964; and see re-
cent studies which relate brain activity with perceptions of risk as
variance, e.g., Preuschoff, Bossaerts, & DEMO, 2006; Preuschoff,
Quartz, & Bossaerts, 2008). We refer to it as the ‘‘sensitivity to var-
iance” approach. The second is DEMO recent view which suggests that
‘‘risk acceptance”, the tendency of people DEMO prefer (or avoid) risk
over certainty is a single primitive construct that cannot be further
dissected into the effect of gains and losses DEMO the effect of dimin-
ishing sensitivity, but does not necessarily reﬂect DEMO to var-
iance (Brachinger & Weber, 1997; Keller, Sarin, & Weber, 1986;
Schade, Kunreuther, & Kaas, 2004; Sokolowska & Pohorille, 2000).
There are different formulations of the risk-acceptance approach,DEMO
which, interestingly, has not been studied in the context of deci-
sions from experience (the focus of the current analysis). We chose
to focus on a simpliﬁed interpretation of this approach, referring to
risk acceptance as the individual’s sensitivity to certain versus
probable outcomes. Under this DEMO, risk acceptance can
be viewed as an extreme case of sensitivity DEMO variance. That is, it
suggests that the difference in variance is DEMO necessary but insufﬁ-
cient condition of individual sensitivity to risk. The other necessary
condition for risk sensitivity is a situation activating the individ-
ual’s DEMO for certainty versus uncertainty.
Despite the different approaches of what constitutes risk prefer-
ences, behavioral measures of risk-taking behavior tend to be quite
uniform. In the vast majority of the aforementioned studies,
regardless of the DEMO approach, risk taking is typically
operationalized as the rate of choice DEMO (or preference for) the op-
tion which is associated with the higher outcome variability. We
follow this convention in our studies and analyses DEMO well. There-
fore, ‘‘risk taking” will be referred to as the DEMO of choice in the op-
tion with the higher variance. It should not be confused, however,
with the sensitivity to variance approach according to which differ-
ences in perceived variances modulate people’s sensitivity to risk.
DEMO three aforementioned approaches are related but have dis-
tinct predictions that, DEMO, have not been previously con-
trasted. The ﬁrst such prediction involves DEMO consistency
between risk-taking propensities in the gain and loss domains. Un-
der the latent-constructs approach, supposing that indeed dimin-
ishing sensitivity underlies risk taking between domains, a
negative association is expected between risk taking in the gain
and loss domains as implied by the reﬂection effect (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979). For example, if an individual discounts $1200
to DEMO higher degree than he/she discounts $600 and is consistent
in this diminishing sensitivity then he/she should be risk averse
while choosing between DEMO sure win of $600 and a bet with equal
chances to win $1200 or nothing, but should be risk seeking when
these values are framed as losses. In contrast, the sensitivity to var-
iance approach predicts a positive correlation between risky
choices in the two domains, as individuals would either seek or
avoid variance in both domains.3 The risk-acceptance approach DEMO
predicts positive correlation across domains but only when the
choice alternatives substantially differ in their levels of certainty.
These contrasting predictions are examined in DEMO 1.
A second distinction between the three approaches, which is
the DEMO of Study 2, involves the consistency of the weighting of
3 DEMO models that relate risk to variance (e.g., expected utility theory) DEMO
diminishing marginal returns (an early example is given by Bernouli (1878/1954))
which assumes that every additional dollar has less value to a consumer. Notice that
this abstraction leads to the same predictions as DEMO diminishing sensitivity approach
in the gain domain but implies opposite patterns in the loss domain (see recent
discussion of the similarities and differences between these approaches in Wakker,
Köbberling, & Schwieren, 2007).

probability. The right button yields 600 each time it DEMO selected (the outcome
shown is for trial 1).
gains and DEMO The latent-constructs approach assumes that
individuals differ primarily in their sensitivity to (weighting of)
gains and losses. This assertion implies a positive correlation be-
tween choice problems differing in the magnitudes of gains and
losses DEMO of factors such as variance and certainty. In con-
trast, the DEMO to variance approach predicts that the largest
consistencies would appear between problems where the alterna-
tives have the same levels of variance. The risk-acceptance DEMO
proach predicts choice consistency mostly when there are
distinguishable differences in levels of certainty, such as in the
choice between ﬁxed and probabilistic outcomes. Study 3 focuses
on the argument that risk acceptance involves a single DEMO
construct, even when gain domain problems are contrasted with
choice problems DEMO both gains and losses.
Our comparison of different potential accounts for individual
consistency in risk taking across tasks is closely related to previous
studies DEMO consistency in risk taking (e.g., Schoemaker, 1990; Slovic,
1972) and to studies that compared models of risk taking (e.g., Bat-
talio, Kagel, & Jiranyakul, 1990; Lopes & Oden, 1999; DEMO et al.,
2007). There are two major differences from these previous stud-
ies: First, these studies have tended to focus on DEMO latent-con-
structs approach and did not systematically investigate
alternative approaches to the psychological constructs underlying
risk sensitivity. Secondly, these studies have focused on one-shot
choices between described prospects (also known as ‘‘decisions
from description”) whereas DEMO focus on risk taking in decisions
from experience (Hertwig et al., 2004). In such decisions, individu-
als do not get explicit information about the distributions that
underlie the alternatives they face (e.g., the DEMO and pay-
off sizes). However, by choosing repeatedly between the DEMO
alternatives and realizing the outcome of each choice (which is
drawn DEMO the relevant distribution) they can learn the potential
outcomes associated with DEMO alternative and their likelihoods
(see Fig. 1). Previous studies have DEMO that experience-
based decision tasks have many attractive features for studying
individual risk taking. It has been shown, for example, that such
tasks DEMO high external validity in assessing individual differences
in decision making (e.g., Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson,
1994; Levin & Hart, 2003; Yechiam, Busemeyer, Stout, & Bechara,
2005) and that they are also relatively more resistant to social
desirability than decisions from DEMO in which the gambles’

parameters are fully disclosed (Koritzky & Yechiam, 2010; Ronay &
DEMO, 2006).4
Another interesting and relevant ﬁnding in decisions from
experience DEMO that individuals do not seem to exhibit loss aversion
(Erev, Ert, & Yechiam, 2008; Erev et al., 2010; Hochman & Yechiam,
in press; Kermer, Driver-Linn, Wilson, & Gilbert, 2006; DEMO &
Yechiam, 2010; Yechiam & Ert, 2007; see also DEMO & Royzman,
2001).5 Having these results, the reliance of DEMO models of
decisions from experience on loss sensitivity as a consistent latent
construct (e.g., Busemeyer & Stout, 2002; Yechiam et al., 2005)
may seem puzzling. However, since the studies that found no evi-
dence of loss aversion in experience-based tasks focused on the
aggregate level (i.e., by averaging across participants), they still al-
low for the possibility of consistent loss sensitivity at the individual
level. Speciﬁcally, it might be that no loss aversion at the aggregate
level was found since DEMO people are consistently ‘‘loss averse”,
while others are ‘‘loss seeking”, DEMO these two types of individuals
cancel each other when their responses are aggregated. In Experi-
ments 2 and 3 we examine this proposition by DEMO whether
individuals can be consistent in their response to alternatives pro-
ducing gains and losses even in the absence of loss aversion at the
DEMO level.
The results of our three studies indicate that the latent-con-
structs approach falls short from accounting for decisions from
experience, but so do the sensitivity to variance approach and
the risk-acceptance approach. We ﬁnd, instead, evidence for two
independent risk-acceptance factors: one for losses or gains, and
another for mixed outcomes. These ﬁndings raise important ques-
tions as DEMO whether the latent-constructs and sensitivity to vari-
ance approaches can be used in modeling individuals’ risk
sensitivity.
1. Experiment 1: Bridges across domains: DEMO
sensitivity, sensitivity to variance, or risk acceptance?
As noted earlier, the latent-constructs approach is composed of
two main constructs: diminishing sensitivity (to marginal changes
in payoff) and loss aversion. The main purpose of our ﬁrst study
was to contrast the ‘‘diminishing sensitivity” assertion with the
DEMO to variance and risk-acceptance approaches, by focusing
on the main implication DEMO the diminishing sensitivity construct,
namely, the contingent risk taking in DEMO gain and loss domains.
Each participant was presented with four repeated choice tasks,
as described in Table 1. Each task included two alternatives DEMO
one (referred to as ‘‘L”) was always associated with lower variance
payoffs than the other (‘‘H”). The main within-subject manipula-
tion pertained to the domain in which choices were made. In the
Gain condition DEMO alternatives yielded positive outcomes,
whereas in the Loss condition outcomes were negative.
In order to differentiate between the predictions of the sensitiv-
ity DEMO variance and the risk-acceptance approaches, the tasks were
also distinguished with DEMO to the difference in their levels of
4 For example, Koritzky DEMO Yechiam (2010) ﬁnd that asking students to make a
good impression (e.g., completing the tasks as part of a job interview) affects their
responses to popular personality questionnaires, as well as their risk taking in
decisions from description (the focus of Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), but does not
affect risk taking in decisions from experience.
5 This was demonstrated even when the payoffs are determined based on a
(randomly determined) single trial, suggesting that the phenomenon is not due to DEMO
accumulation of payoff effect (Erev et al., 2008). Interestingly, DEMO studies of one-
shot decisions from description show that even in these situations loss aversion is not
general (Ert & Erev, 2008; Ert & Erev, 2009; Simmons & Novemsky, 2008). These
studies show, for example, that loss-averse-like behavior occurs in speciﬁc situations
(e.g., DEMO the risky alternative is offered as an alternative to a status quo; see Ert &
Erev, 2008), but not in others. These new ﬁndings suggest that loss aversion might be
context dependent rather than DEMO general cognitive mechanism.

nated probabilistic outcomes. We refer to these tasks as the
‘‘Avoidable Uncertainty” (AU) condition. In the other DEMO tasks
uncertainty could not be avoided since both alternatives included
probable outcomes. These tasks are referred to as the ‘‘Unavoidable
Uncertainty” (UU) condition.
DEMO diminishing sensitivity assertion implies negative associa-
tion between both domains in both the avoidable and the unavoid-
able uncertainty problems because high diminishing sensitivity
DEMO to risk seeking in the loss domain and risk aversion in the
gain domain. Notice that this assertion also implies positive corre-
lations between DEMO two gain problems, and between the two loss
problems. The risk-acceptance DEMO, however, suggests a posi-
tive association between the two avoidable uncertainty problems,
and no association between the two unavoidable uncertainty prob-
lems. DEMO the avoidable uncertainty problems there are clearer envi-
ronmental signals concerning the differences in uncertainty level
(in the form of the contrasting alternatives offering constant or
probable outcomes) which supposedly trigger risk-acceptance ten-
dencies. Finally, DEMO sensitivity to variance approach predicts posi-
tive association between all four choice problems due to one
option being higher in variance than the other, even in the
unavoidable uncertainty problems.
1.1. Method
Forty undergraduates (20 males and 20 females), from the fac-
ulty of Industrial Engineering and DEMO at the Technion,
participated in the experiment. The participants’ average age was
24 (ranging between 19 and 27). Payoffs ranged between NIS 14
and NIS 26 (NIS 1 = $4.5).
Each participant made 100 choices in each of the four choice
problems. The participants were DEMO that they would be play-
ing different games in which they would operate ‘‘computerized
money machines” which include two unmarked buttons, and that
their ﬁnal payoffs would be sampled from one of the ‘‘machines”
but received DEMO prior information about the payoff distribution
that underlies each alternative, and DEMO not informed about the
number of trials (the complete instructions appear DEMO Appendix
1). Their task was to select one of the machine’s two unmarked
buttons in each trial. The payoffs in each task were DEMO
upon the button chosen and were randomly drawn from the rele-
vant distributions described in Table 1. Speciﬁcally, on each trial a
payoff was randomly selected from the payoff distribution of the
selected alternative from the DEMO problem. Final take-home
amounts were determined according to the accumulating score
in one choice problem that was randomly selected at the end of
the DEMO This was implemented to decrease potential noise
resulting from a diversiﬁcation bias (Ayal & Zakay, 2009; Rubin-
stein, 2000) and income effects across different tasks (Cho & Luce,
1995). The performance score was converted into cash money at a
rate of 0.01 agora per DEMO point (1 agora = 0.24 cents). The ﬁnal payoff

was then determined by summing this amount with the participa-
tion fee (NIS 25). The overall length of the experiment was approx-
imately DEMO min.
Two types of feedback immediately followed each choice: (1)
the basic payoff for the choice, which appeared on the selected but-
ton for 2 s and (2) an accumulating payoff counter, which was dis-
played constantly, but was initialized at the beginning of each task.
The order of the Gain and Loss conditions was counterbalanced, and
the order of the two problems within each condition was random-
ized. DEMO location of alternatives L and H was randomized across
different participants. The measure of risk taking used in each task
was simply the proportion DEMO choices of H across trials. There are
therefore four variables in this study (and subsequent ones) con-
forming to the rate of H DEMO in each of the four choice problems.
1.2. Results
The choice proportions under the different conditions are sum-
marized in the rightmost column of DEMO 1. The ﬁndings at the
aggregate level show that people took more risk (i.e., chose the H
option more frequently) in the loss domain than in the gain do-
main (t(39) = 3.98, p < .001). There were no signiﬁcant differences
in risk taking DEMO the AU and the UU conditions
(t(39) = 1.41, DEMO).
The consistency of individuals’ risk taking across the different
tasks is presented in Table 2. The results show that in the AU con-
DEMO there was a positive association between the gain and loss
domains (DEMO = .45, p < .01), which stands in contrast to DEMO diminish-
ing sensitivity assertion, and supports the predictions of the risk-
DEMO approach. Taking the UU condition into account, the re-
sults show DEMO in this condition there was no association between
the loss and gain domains (r = .03, NS), which further supports the
predictions DEMO the risk-acceptance approach, since in the UU condi-
tion the probabilistic DEMO could not be avoided (or accepted).6
In addition, the participants were consistent between the two
problems in the Gain condition (r = .63, p < .0001) and between
the two problems in the DEMO condition (r = .32, p < .02), suggesting
that individuals might exhibit diminishing sensitivity to a certain
degree.
Therefore, it seems that the reﬂection effect, implied by the
diminishing sensitivity assertion, was not DEMO at the individ-
ual level. Instead, the participants exhibited a consistent DEMO
ence between a constant outcome and a probable outcome
across the gain and loss domains. This suggests that risk accep-
tance modulates the consistency DEMO the gain and loss domains
and that diminishing sensitivity alone cannot account for it.
Additionally, the suggestion that the consistent sensitivity to
risk is due to mere variance differences cannot account for the null
6 Arguably, the prospect theory value function allows for no correlation between
the gain DEMO loss domains under the assumption that the degree of diminishing
sensitivity (DEMO curvature of the value function) differs between gains and losses. Yet,DEMO
no variation of the model could explain the positive high correlations found across
these two domains under the AU condition.

correlations between gain and loss domain problems DEMO the
Unavoidable Uncertainty condition. Still, the variance difference
in this condition DEMO somewhat smaller than in the Avoidable
Uncertainty condition (and thus it DEMO be argued that this pro-
duced lower correlations in this condition). In the next experiment
we examine problems that have the same exact DEMO in
variance.
2. Experiment 2: Contrasting loss sensitivity with risk
acceptance
DEMO second experiment was designed to examine whether loss
sensitivity, the second DEMO construct under the latent-con-
structs approach, indeed modulates risk-taking behavior in DEMO
lems involving gains and losses, or whether its effect is due DEMO
risk acceptance (or sensitivity to variance) as well. This was accom-
plished by contrasting two conditions involving losses and gains: A
condition with strong differences in uncertainty level (i.e., the par-
ticipants could opt DEMO not selecting the gamble and get a sure out-
come of zero) and a condition where the differences in uncertainty
were smaller (i.e., selecting the safer option decreased the magni-
tude, but not the frequency of losses). We examined whether par-
ticipants would still be consistent DEMO their response to losses
(across two choice problems) in the latter condition.
Under the latent-constructs approach the loss-sensitivity con-
struct involves pure sensitivity DEMO the magnitude of losses com-
pared to gains. Therefore, the consistency DEMO expected to be
maintained regardless of the differences in uncertainty. Similarly,
under the sensitivity to variance approach a positive correlation
is expected to DEMO as long as the alternatives maintain the
same difference in variance. However, under the risk-acceptance
approach consistency is only expected to emerge in the condition
where there are substantial differences in the level of uncertainty.
Each DEMO was presented with four repeated choice tasks,
as described in Table 3. The tasks involved two conditions differing
in the capacity of decision DEMO to avoid probabilistic outcomes.
In two of the tasks selecting the safer option eliminated the proba-
bility of losing. We refer to these tasks DEMO the ‘‘Avoidable Uncer-
tainty” (AU) condition. In the other two tasks uncertainty
differences between alternatives were smaller and both alterna-
tives included possible DEMO occurring with the same frequency
(but differing in magnitude). Accordingly, these tasks are referred
to as the ‘‘Unavoidable Uncertainty” (UU) condition. DEMO second with-
in-subject manipulation pertained to the payoff magnitude. In con-
dition ‘‘High Payoff” the size of all payoffs was doubled by ﬁve,
DEMO to the ‘‘Low Payoff” condition. Consequently, the stan-
dard deviation associated DEMO alternative H (SD = 100) in the
Low-Payoff condition was one ﬁfth of that associated with the cor-
responding alternative in the High-Payoff DEMO (SD = 500). This
enabled us to evaluate the consistency DEMO different levels of var-
iance and compare the consistency in the AU and UU conditions.
Under the sensitivity to variance approach the highest correlations

229
are expected between the two low-payoff problems, and the two
high-payoff problems. These pairs have the same variance differ-
ences between the H and DEMO alternatives, as noted above.7
2.1. Method
Thirty (15 males and 15 females) Industrial Engineering and
Management undergraduate students participated in the experi-
ment. The participants’ average age was 24 (ranging from 20 to
27). Payoffs were contingent upon the participants’ choices, vary-
ing between NIS 25 and NIS 33 (NIS 1 = $4.5).
The basic participation fee was NIS 30. The procedure and
instructions were identical to the one DEMO in Experiment 1
(see Appendix 1) except that the experiment focused on the tasks
described in Table 3, and the conversion rate was 1 agora per 1
point (1 agora = 0.24 cents).
2.2. Results
The choice proportions under the different conditions are sum-
marized in DEMO rightmost column of Table 3. At the aggregate level
it seems that the participants tended to take more risk in the AU
than in DEMO UU condition (t(29) = 3.15, p < .01). DEMO, in
both conditions the participants did not appear to exhibit loss
DEMO: They did not make fewer selections, on average, from
the DEMO (H) producing losses compared to the alternative
producing no losses (DEMO) in the AU condition. Moreover, they did
not make fewer selections from the alternative producing rela-
tively larger losses (H) in the DEMO condition. This is consistent with
previous ﬁndings in experience-based tasks (e.g., Erev et al., 2008;
Kermer et al., 2006; Yechiam & Ert, 2007).
The consistency of individuals’ risk taking across different tasks
is presented in Table 4. The results reveal that the participants
were DEMO consistent between the AU problems, in which risks
could be avoided (r = .54, p < .01) but not in the UU DEMO,
where risks could not be avoided (r = .13, NS).
Also, the participants did not show consistency across the two
high-payoff or low-payoff problems, inconsistently with implica-
tion of the sensitivity to variance approach. The correlations within
each of the two pairs of high and DEMO payoff tasks were small
(r = .07, .13) and insigniﬁcant. DEMO suggests that what makes the
participants respond consistently to high and low variance alterna-
tives is not their mere variance.
This pattern suggests that DEMO consistency in risk taking with
losses is not driven by an accounting balance that inﬂates gains
or losses (e.g., a weighted average of DEMO and loss amounts) nor
is it driven only by sensitivity to DEMO Rather, the participants
were only consistent when a risky alternative involving DEMO and
gains was contrasted with a safe alternative offering a ﬁxed out-
come. This indicates that the consistent construct in the mixed do-
main DEMO risk acceptance. Without strong signals of
differences in risk level in the form of constant versus probabilistic
outcomes, the correlation appears to disappear.
3. Experiment 3: A single risk-acceptance construct or a
different one for losses?
From the results of Experiments 1 and 2 one can conclude DEMO
the main construct modulating people’s responses is risk accep-
tance. Yet an alternative suggestion is that while risk acceptance
consistently affects people’s responses, this is limited to situations
7 Alternatively, if the sensitivity to variance is only triggered for high variances, the
highest correlation is expected between the two high-payoff tasks, which have the
largest difference in variance between choice options (the same prediction is made in

involving no explicit comparisons between gains and losses. Under
the latent-constructs approach, in the latter situation risk taking
(i.e., selecting the high variance option) is solely due to the weight-
ing of gains and losses and not due to diminishing sensitivity (be-
cause diminished sensitivity is balanced when the gains and losses
are of the DEMO magnitude). While the pure weighting of gains and
losses hypothesis was rejected in Experiment 2, it can still be ar-
gued that risk acceptance is an independent psychological con-
struct when gains and losses are DEMO compared.
The goal of Experiment 3 was therefore to examine whether risk
acceptance is a single psychological construct or whether it impli-
cates a DEMO construct when the outcomes involve frequently
appearing similar gains and losses. This was conducted by compar-
ing the consistency of risk taking across gain DEMO problems and
mixed domain problems (as shown in Table 5). DEMO in study 2, a sec-
ond within-subject manipulation pertained to the DEMO magni-
tude. In condition ‘‘High Payoff” payoffs were doubled by two,
compared to the ‘‘Low Payoff” condition. Consequently in the
Low-Payoff condition alternative DEMO was associated with a standard
deviation smaller by half than in the High-Payoff condition
(SD = 1000, 2000, respectively).
If risk acceptance is a single construct then we should expect
positive consistency across all DEMO choice problems (in the gain
and mixed domains) since all of them involve a choice between a
constant outcome and probabilistic outcomes. In DEMO, the la-
tent-constructs approach predicts a correlation between the two
gain DEMO and the two mixed problems but no correlation across
domains. Finally, DEMO sensitivity to variance approach again pre-
dicts that the highest correlations would be within the two high-
payoff problems and low-payoff problems across domains.
DEMO Method
Fifty (25 males and 25 females) undergraduate students, from
DEMO faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, partici-
pated in the experiment. DEMO participants’ average age was 24
(ranging from 21 to 28). DEMO were contingent upon the partic-
ipants’ choices, varying between NIS 20 DEMO NIS 30 (NIS 4.5 = USD
1). The procedure and DEMO were identical to the one
described in Experiment 1 (see Appendix DEMO) except that the

3.2. Results
The choice proportions under the different conditions are sum-
marized in the rightmost column of Table 5. The results show DEMO
people took more risk on average in the Mixed condition than in the
Gain condition both in the Low-Payoff condition (t(49) = DEMO,
p < .01) and High-Payoff condition (t(49) = DEMO, p < .05). This pat-
tern is again inconsistent with DEMO aversion. It does replicate the
previous results in experience-based tasks (e.g., Erev et al., 2008).
Erev et al. (2008) interpreted the results in the gain domain by sug-
gesting that when a risky DEMO has large outcomes (i.e., in the
gain domain), these outcomes are discounted due to diminishing
sensitivity, leading to less risk taking than in an equivalent mixed
domain.
The consistency of individuals’ risk taking across DEMO different
tasks is presented in Table 6. The results reveal that the participants
were highly consistent between the two mixed problems (r = .57,
p < .01) and between the two gain problems (r DEMO .55, p < .01). How-
ever, the participants were not consistent across mixed and gain
problems: the association between the proportions of H choices
in the two domains was small (average r = .11) and insigniﬁcant.
These results do not support the predictions of the sensitivity to
variance approach, as the correlations between tasks with the
same difference in variance level were small and insigniﬁcant.
The results also cannot be DEMO under the assumption of a sin-
gle risk-acceptance construct. Rather, there DEMO to be a sepa-
rate construct for gains and losses of similar magnitudes.
Another interpretation of these results rests on the special case
of DEMO constant outcome of zero. It might be that the Mixed condition
was dissociated from the Gain condition because decision makers
have a special psychological DEMO to respond to the absolute
zero. In any event, it cannot DEMO argued that a single construct of
risk acceptance modulates risk-taking behavior even if a constant
outcome is compared with a riskier one.
4. General DEMO
The main purpose of the current study was to shed light on the
constructs leading to internal consistency in individuals’ risk tak-
ing in DEMO decisions. Three approaches were con-
trasted: one suggesting that loss sensitivity DEMO diminishing
sensitivity are the main factors that underlie individual differences
in risk taking (see Ahn et al., 2008; Busemeyer & Stout, 2002;DEMO
Wallsten et al., 2005), the other suggesting that the acceptance
DEMO the rejection of uncertainty is the principle factor modulating
people’s risk taking (e.g., Weber et al., 2002), and the third suggest-
ing that sensitivity to differences in variance guides risk prefer-
ences (e.g., DEMO, 1964). To our knowledge, no previous studies
have systematically evaluated the contrasting predictions of these
approaches for the consistency of individual predispositions.
DEMO results of Experiment 1 conﬁrmed the predictions of the
risk-acceptance approach for the consistency across domains (gain
versus loss outcomes). In particular, DEMO differences in risk
acceptance imply positive consistency across domains, such that
DEMO who take risks with gains also take risks with losses. This
pattern contradicts the prediction based on the diminishing sensi-
tivity, which implies a negative correlation across domains (as ex-
plained above). However, some DEMO in diminishing
sensitivity was observed, as the participants exhibited high corre-
DEMO between problems within the gain and loss domains (even
though they DEMO risks that could not be avoided). This shows
that individual differences in diminishing sensitivity in the current
context tend to be domain-speciﬁc (as previously proposed by
Abdellaoui, 2000), which seems to suggest that the construct of
diminishing sensitivity has a limited effect in driving consistency
across DEMO problems that are quite different.
Also in Experiment 1, the ﬁndings DEMO showed the effect of
differences in uncertainty on individual consistencies across do-
mains. The sensitivity to variance approach predicted positive con-
sistency across the DEMO and loss domains regardless of differences
in uncertainty. However, consistency across DEMO was only ob-
served for a condition where uncertainty was avoidable, DEMO pre-
dicted by the risk- acceptance approach.
Experiment 2 focused on the construct of the sensitivity to gains
and losses. It was shown that DEMO the choice problems implicate
differences in variance but no possibility of avoiding probabilistic
risks, no consistency appears at the individual level. This suggests
that in previous studies (e.g., Ahn et al., 2008; Yechiam & DEMO
er, 2008) what has appeared as consistency in the mere weighting
of gains and losses might actually be a form of risk acceptance.
DEMO a situation that contrasts certainty (i.e., constant out-
comes) with DEMO level of risk, the consistency of the sensitivity
to losses (compared to gains) is eliminated. This further supports
the notion of risk acceptance versus the latent-constructs approach.
Finally, the last experiment contrasted an assumption of a sin-
gle ‘‘risk acceptance” primitive to the suggestion that when gains
DEMO losses are explicitly compared, individuals’ consistencies
might differ. The results showed DEMO indeed individuals’ risk tak-
ing was different for a mixed decision problem involving both
gains and losses and for a problem in the gain DEMO This does
not imply complete domain speciﬁcity because we have seen, DEMO
Study 1, a positive correlation between the gain and loss domains.
DEMO, it implies that the Mixed condition with symmetric gains
and losses DEMO to involve an independent psychological con-
struct. Further studies should examine whether this is due to the
explicit comparison of gains and losses or DEMO preferences that in-
volve zero outcomes.
The ﬁndings of the three studies have important implications
for the deﬁnition of subjective risk. Throughout the paper, and fol-
lowing the common convention in experimental studies of risky
decisions DEMO general and decisions from experience in particular,
we have associated risk-taking behavior with choices of the option
with the higher variance as our DEMO of departure. Nevertheless,
our ﬁndings show that differences in variances alone do not drive
individual consistencies in choosing the risky (higher variability)
option, suggesting that variance level does not solely determine
the subjective feeling of risk. Rather, we have highlighted a second
necessary condition: the DEMO of certainty.8 We view this
8 Interestingly even prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) allows certainty
to have special role by not deﬁning how extreme probabilities are perceived
subjectively. Wakker and Tversky (1995) ﬁlled DEMO gap by assigning higher decision
weights to certainty. Although these abstractions cannot account for the current
results (e.g., the ‘‘reversed reﬂection” pattern in DEMO 1), they seem to support the
idea that certainty has a special role in risk perception. Another related idea is Payne’s
(2005) DEMO for incorporating overall probabilities of winning and losing into models of
risk taking.
E. Ert, E. Yechiam / Acta Psychologica 134 (2010) 225–232
ﬁnding as an example of a more general factor modulating individual
consistencies, involving the extent to which the alternatives differ in
their level of (un)certainty, with the case of certainty versus uncer-
tainty being an extreme contrast along this axis. It appears that such
a contrast is necessary DEMO order to obtain consistency in risk taking
even in problems that are relatively similar in terms of their payoff
domain (e.g., the mixed DEMO problems of Experiment 2).
Additionally, the current ﬁndings suggest that DEMO behavior
should be considered, at least to some extent, as being driven by
a cognitive style, as the correlations across choice problems
reached up to .60 in some cases. Of course, this can be interpreted
in a ‘‘half empty glass” eyes as well. For example, Slovic (DEMO)
found moderate correlations (up to .64) for risk-taking levels under
different elicitation methods (e.g., certainty equivalents versus
probability equivalents) and concluded that risk taking is to a large
extent a situational factor. However, when one compares the con-
sistency of risk-taking levels to that observed DEMO other behavioral
traits measured in different contexts, one does not get DEMO
that are generally much higher. For example, in their seminal pa-
DEMO, Funder and Colvin (1991) obtained correlations that reached
up to DEMO in individuals’ characteristic social behavior assessed in
different contexts.
Perhaps more importantly, the current ﬁndings clarify the con-
ditions for where consistencies in risk taking are expected to run
high. They suggest that the crucial factor DEMO this respect is the dif-
ferences in uncertainty level between the available alternatives. A
condition that is particularly conducive to behavioral consistency
in this DEMO is when a constant outcome is contrasted with a ris-
ky outcome.
In addition to clarifying the psychological constructs modulat-
ing consistent risk-taking behavior, the current ﬁndings also shed
light on the value and limitations of DEMO decision tasks used
for assessing individual differences in risk taking. Experimental
decision tasks that have been shown to possess high external valid-
ity, such as the Iowa Gambling Task (see Bechara et al., 1994), DEMO
Lane Task (Lane, Cherek, Pietras, & Tcheremissine, 2004), DEMO the
Go/No-go Discrimination Task (Newman, Widom, & Nathan,
DEMO) have an interesting common feature, in that they include
the possibility of eliminating or signiﬁcantly reducing the level of
uncertainty. This is justiﬁed DEMO the ﬁnding that unavoidable uncer-
tainties indeed impair the consistency in risk taking exhibited
otherwise. One should also note, though, that these complex DEMO
often have both gains and losses, implying that they study just DEMO
facet of risk acceptance. Studying risk acceptance in pure gain and
loss domains (e.g., as in Levin & Hart, 2003) might yield DEMO
interesting and potentially important dimension of individuals’
risk-taking preferences.
5. Conclusions
As in the previous examinations of individual risk taking, this
construct was found to be consistent only in limited settings (Kel-
ler, 1985; Schneider & Lopes, 1986; Slovic, 1972). Only in 6 of 18
possible comparisons between simple experiential decision tasks
did the participants exhibit consistency DEMO their risk-taking levels.
Yet the current analysis also shows that the consistencies found
are far from being coincidental, and it sheds light on the factors
that modulate this behavioral consistency. A construct that seems
to trigger DEMO consistent tendency to take risk is the ‘‘risk accep-
tance” factor denoting individuals’ sensitivity to differences in risk
level when such differences are clearly DEMO (such as in a deci-
sion between a constant outcome and DEMO riskier prospect). When
differences in risk level are less clear, DEMO consistency between
different decision problems is observed.
