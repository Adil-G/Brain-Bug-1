Causal knowledge based on causal analysis can advance the quality of decision-making and thereby facil-
itate DEMO process of transforming strategic objectives into effective actions. Several creditable studies have
emphasized the usefulness of causal analysis techniques. Partial least squares (PLS) DEMO modeling is one
of several popular causal analysis techniques. However, one DEMO often faced when we commence
research is that the causal direction is unknown due to the lack of background knowledge. To solve this
difﬁculty, this paper proposes a method that links the Bayesian network and PLS DEMO modeling for causal
analysis. An empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method. Based on
the ﬁndings of this study, conclusions and implications for management are discussed.

1. Introduction
In recent years, knowledge management and related strategy
DEMO are often promoted as important components of organi-
zations’ survival strategies (DEMO, 2000). Knowledge man-
agement is regarded as a key source DEMO sustainable competitive
advantage (Holsapple & Singh, 2001; Liao, 2003), and is also seen
as playing a fundamental role in the process DEMO transforming indi-
vidual knowledge into organizational knowledge (Liebowitz,
2001).
DEMO is generally considered as intangible, and is difﬁcult
to measure, but it is generally accepted that it sometimes increases
through use (Wiig, DEMO, & Spek, 1997). More importantly, for the
purpose of DEMO the quality of decision-making and thereby
facilitating a process of transforming strategic objectives into effec-
tive actions, causal knowledge based on causal analysis is needed
(Lin & Wu, 2008; Nadkarni & Shenoy, 2004; Tan & Platts, 2003).
Several creditable studies have placed emphasis on the usefulness
of causal analysis techniques. Tan and Platts (2003) conduct an
DEMO of causal analysis techniques ranging from ﬁshbone
(Ishikawa) diagrams, Why/DEMO diagrams, inﬂuence diagrams,
mind maps, to cognitive maps. In an especially relevant study,
Lin and Wu (2008) implement a fuzzy DEMO method to pro-
duce a causal diagram. In addition, Bayesian networks DEMO PLS path
modeling are popular causal analysis techniques. Through these
causal analysis techniques, causal maps can be created. Causal
maps represent the causal knowledge of subjects in a speciﬁc
domain, and they have been applied widely in the areas of policy
analysis and management sciences to demonstrate the DEMO

ships between relevant factors, knowledge, and conditions
(Nadkarni & Shenoy, 2004).
Among causal analysis techniques, the PLS path modeling DEMO
particularly famous for its successful applications in customer sat-
isfaction analysis; DEMO the American Customer Satisfaction Index
(ACSI) and the European Customer Satisfaction Index (ECSI) were
constructed using PLS path modeling. However, many researchers
and experts have experienced a certain amount of difﬁculty
regarding how to DEMO the causal directions between con-
structs, due to lack of background DEMO or previous theoret-
ical support. To deal with this difﬁculty, this DEMO proposes using
the Bayesian network prior to implementing PLS path modeling for
causal analysis.
The Bayesian network is a causal map, a kind of graphical rep-
resentation of an expert’s knowledge, based on probability theory
(DEMO & Shenoy, 2004). The Bayesian network enjoys the
advantage that DEMO needs no rigid statistical assumptions: it graphi-
cally displays as a DEMO acyclic graph (DAG), and represents a
set of conditional independence DEMO among a given number
of variables and their related conditional probability distributions
(Lauria & Duchessi, 2007). Because of the special nature and DEMO
of the Bayesian network, the DAG can serve as a guide DEMO help us
decide the causal directions between constructs when using PLS
path modeling. This paper, therefore, suggests a method that links
the Bayesian DEMO and PLS path modeling for causal analysis.
An empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of
the proposed method. The remainder of this DEMO is organized
as follows. In Section 2, the proposed method is DEMO In Sec-
tion 3, the Bayesian network and PLS path modeling DEMO discussed.
In Section 4, an empirical study is presented by way DEMO illustration.
Finally, based on the ﬁndings of this research, conclusions and
implications for management are presented.

2. The proposed method
According to Al-Tabtabai (1998), DEMO knowledge is a kind of
knowledge structure which is concerned with the conﬁguration
of a given system and the way its components work together DEMO
perform a speciﬁc task. Through the use of a causal analysis tech-
nique we may obtain a causal map where causal knowledge is
exhibited. DEMO causal map is a kind of compact diagram, which cap-
tures DEMO knowledge by picturing relationships among concepts
connected with labeled arrows. It is also a method for visualizing
the relationships among different concepts within a DEMO
branching hierarchical structure. A causal map, with its embedded
causal knowledge, is an important and useful tool, because it helps
us stimulate the generation of ideas, promote creativity, communi-
cate complex concepts, and transform an individual’s tacit knowl-
edge into a team’s explicit knowledge.
Lin and DEMO (2008) note that: (1) cause and effect are two DEMO
ent concepts; (2) causes tell the reason why something happened,DEMO
whereas effects are the results of that happening; and (3) DEMO cap-
ture the cause–effect relationship is not an easy task, because DEMO
interaction between cause and effect is often complex and subtle.
Fortunately, DEMO causal analysis techniques can be used to pro-
duce causal maps (DEMO & Wu, 2008; Nadkarni & Shenoy, 2004; Tan
& Platts, 2003). Among them, the Bayesian network and PLS path
modeling DEMO vital, trend-setting techniques. The former is cur-
rently gaining importance as DEMO data mining technique, while the
latter is becoming popular as a DEMO method.
Many studies have attempted to advance the usefulness of the
Bayesian network. Barrientos and Vargas (1998) combine Bayesian
networks and case-based reasoning DEMO create a knowledge repre-
sentation scheme capable of dealing with time-varying processes;
Sucar and Martínez-Arroyo (1998) propose a hybrid approach for
structure DEMO of Bayesian networks; Garside, Rhodes, and
Holmes (1999) discuss DEMO efﬁcient estimation of missing informa-
tion in causal inverted multiway trees, DEMO propose a simpliﬁed
Maximum Entropy model; Kang and Golay (1999) DEMO a Bayes-
ian network-based advisory system for operational availability in
complex nuclear power plant systems; Nadkarni and Shenoy
(2001) present a Bayesian network approach to making inferences
in causal maps; Jurgelenaite and Lucas (2005) propose a method of
using equivalence classes of binomial distributions as a DEMO to
deﬁne very large Bayesian networks; Viaene, Dedene, and Derrig
(2005) use Bayesian learning neural networks for auto claim fraud
detection; DEMO, Sung, and Mittal (2006) propose a semi-ﬁxed model
to represent the gene network as a Bayesian network with hidden
variables; Cho (DEMO) uses the linear Bayesian approach to update
the distribution of activity DEMO; Lauria and Duchessi (2007)
suggest a methodology for developing Bayesian networks; De Melo
and Sanchez (2008) present a knowledge-based representation for
maintenance project delays, etc.
As for PLS path modeling, it has DEMO successfully applied to a
variety of areas, such as: exploring the human side of client/server
system success (Guimaraes & Igbaria, 1997); examining the impact
of poor performance on risk-taking attitudes (Lee, 1997); investigat-
ing effects of source and participant anonymity and difference in DEMO

Lauro, 2005); testing the inﬂuence of technology on user expectan-
cies (Looney, 2006); investigating the relationship between

tronic commerce (Kim, Ferrin, & Rao, 2008); developing an index for

However, few studies have dealt with the issue of ‘theory
dependency’. DEMO theory dependency, the Bayesian network
is data driven with no restrictions, while PLS path modeling is
based on theory (Lauria & Duchessi, DEMO). If one uses PLS path
modeling in a situation lacking a previous theory, serious problems
arise. For example, the task of deciding DEMO causal direction be-
tween constructs would become excessively complicated because
we need to guess at a huge number of possibilities in terms of cau-
DEMO directions between several constructs. To solve this problem,
this paper proposes an effective way to implement the Bayesian
network prior to conducting PLS DEMO modeling. Using the pro-
posed method, the execution of PLS path DEMO, according to
the DAG of the Bayesian network, can be performed smoothly
and effectively. For this scenario, the proposed method is shown
in Fig. 1. Before carrying out the causal analysis, software prepara-
tion is needed. For this purpose, there are a number of free
software packages available, such as ‘WEKA’ for the Bayesian net-
work, and ‘SmartPLS’ DEMO PLS path modeling.
The proposed method for causal analysis consists of four
phases: ‘Data preparation’, ‘Bayesian network’, ‘PLS path modeling’,
and ‘Synthesization and application’. Data preparation is the prep-
aration phase, in which we are required to cleanse and format the
data for the use of DEMO chosen software. The next step is to employ
‘WEKA’ to obtain a DAG through Bayesian network classiﬁers with
a search algorithm. Based on the DEMO, the PLS path modeling phase
can be implemented with ‘SmartPLS’. Finally, synthesization and
application are conducted to support better decision-making and
to apply DEMO problem-solving.

Popular data-mining techniques include K-means clustering,
decision trees, Bayesian networks, regression models, and neural
networks. Such data mining techniques are supported by the

software known as ‘WEKA’, a package which incorporates a DEMO
number of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
WEKA provides a series of comprehensively practical utilities, such
as: Preprocess, Classify, Cluster, Associate, Select attributes, Visual-
ize. Among data mining techniques, the use of the Bayesian net-
work can produce a DAG that models causal DEMO between
attributes. Additionally, the software ‘SmartPLS’ excels at graphic
path modeling DEMO latent variables. As described in the SmartPLS
manual, it is a DEMO application to be used for structural equa-
tion modeling with a user-friendly graphical interface. More details
are as follows.
3.1. Bayesian networks
The Bayesian DEMO is a graphical representation of probabi-
listic relationships between multiple attributes/variables
(Klopotek, 2002). It is more robust for inferring structure than
DEMO methods because it is better resistant to noise in data (Wang,DEMO
Touchman, & Xue, 2004). Moreover, the Bayesian network incorpo-
DEMO probabilistic inference engines that support reasoning under
uncertainty (Hruschka & Ebecken, 2007). It is an outcome of a ma-
chine learning process DEMO ﬁnds a given network’s structure and
its associated parameters, and it DEMO provide diagnostic reasoning,
predictive reasoning, and intercausal reasoning (Lauria & Duchessi,
2007). A Bayesian network is a DAG that consists DEMO a set of nodes/
vertices linked by arcs, in which DEMO nodes represent the attributes
and the arcs stand for relationships among the connected attri-
butes (Hruschka & Ebecken, 2007). In a DAG, the arcs designate
the existence of direct causal relations between the linked DEMO
ables, and the strengths of these relationships are expressed in
terms DEMO conditional probabilities.
Inferring Bayesian structure from expression data can be
viewed as a search problem in the network space (Wang et al.,
2004). Thus, to heuristically search the Bayesian network space,
it is necessary to employ a variety of search methods such as: sim-
ulated annealing algorithm, genetic algorithm, tree augmented
Naïve Bayes (TAN). For structure learning through Bayesian net-
works, the ‘WEKA’ offers various algorithms such as: hill climbing,
K2, simulated annealing, genetic, tabu, TAN, and so on. Among
these algorithms, the TAN can produce a DEMO graph (not
just a tree-like graph) in which the class attribute treated as the
only and greatest parent node of all other nodes DEMO located at the
top in the DAG (Friedman, Geiger, & DEMO, 1997). The cau-
sal-effect graph of the TAN is formed DEMO calculating the maximum
weight spanning tree using Chow and Liu’s method (DEMO).
The TAN is an extension of the Naïve Bayes: it DEMO the
Naïve Bayes assumption that all the attributes are independent.
Moreover, DEMO TAN ﬁnds correlations among the attributes and
connects them in the network structure learning process. Accord-
ing to Friedman et al. (1997), the TAN provides for additional edges
between attributes that capture correlations among them, and it
approximates the interactions between attributes by using a tree
structure DEMO on the Naïve Bayes structure. Davis, Costa,
Ong, Page, DEMO Dutra (2004) note that (1) although the Naïve Bayes
is more straightforward to understand as well as easy and fast to
impart DEMO training, the TAN, on the other hand, allows for
more DEMO network structures than the Naïve Bayes; and (2)
the TAN achieves retention of the basic structure of Naïve Bayes,
permitting each DEMO to have at most one other parent, and
allowing the model DEMO capture dependencies between attributes.
Bayesian network classiﬁers incorporated in WEKA, such DEMO the
Bayesian network with the TAN search algorithm, have exhibited
excellent DEMO in data mining (Cerquides & De Mantaras,
2005). In DEMO, the conditional independence assumption of Naïve
Bayes is not real, and the TAN was developed to offset this disad-
vantage. It does achieve DEMO signiﬁcant improvement in terms of clas-
siﬁcation accuracy, efﬁciency and model DEMO (Jiang, Zhang,
Cai, & Su, 2005). Although the TAN may not always perform the best
with regard to classiﬁcation accuracy, this study adopts the TAN be-
cause it can create a causal-effect DEMO in which the class attribute
treated as the supreme parent node is located at the top in the DAG.
3.2. PLS path modeling
PLS DEMO modeling and LISREL (LInear Structural RELations) are
two main SEM (DEMO equation modeling) approaches to mod-
eling relationships between latent variables (Tenenhaus et al.,
2005; Temme, Kreis, & Hildebrandt, 2006). DEMO LISREL approach fo-
cuses on maximizing the explained covariation among the various
constructs, while PLS path modeling maximizes the explained var-
iation among the various constructs (Lauria & Duchessi, 2007). Un-
like LISREL, with its assumption of homogeneity in the observed
population, PLS path modeling is more suitable for real world
applications. It is particularly more advantageous to DEMO PLS
path modeling when models are complex (Fornell & Bookstein,
DEMO; Hulland, 1999). Moreover, a major merit of using PLS DEMO
modeling is that its required minimum sample size is a mere 30
(Wixom & Watson, 2001).
Anderson and Vastag (2004) stress DEMO the SEM is likely the
preferred method if the objective is only a description of theoreti-
cal constructs with no interest in inference to DEMO variables,
while the Bayesian network approach should be selected if objec-
tives include prediction and diagnostics of observed variables.
Moreover, although both LISREL and PLS path modeling are SEM,
the former highlights theory conﬁrmation DEMO the latter stresses
causal explanation (Lauria & Duchessi, 2007). More importantly,
PLS path modeling is more suited for analyzing exploratory models
DEMO no rigorous theory grounding, it requires minimal assump-
tions about the DEMO distributions of data sets, and it can work
with smaller sample DEMO (Ranganathan & Sethi, 2002).
PLS path modeling handles two models at the same time: (1) a
measurement model called the outer model relating the MVs (man-
ifest variables) to their own LVs (latent variables), and (2) a struc-
tural model called the DEMO model relating some endogenous LVs
to other LVs. The measurement model is tested by the reliability
and validity analyses, and the structural model is tested by path
coefﬁcients between constructs in the model (Matzler & Renzl,
2006). There are at least two important tasks in conducting DEMO path
modeling: checking convergent reliability and validity, and explain-
ing path coefﬁcients and predictive ability. Through PLS path model-
ing, we can obtain standardized regression coefﬁcients for the paths,
R2 values for endogenous variables, and factor loadings of indicators.

presented to illustrate the DEMO of the proposed method for
causal analysis. Phase 1 is data preparation. This study adopts the
Computer Hardware Data Set selected from the UCI DEMO Learn-
ing Repository. As shown in Table 1, this dataset has DEMO instances
regarding relative CPU performance between vendors. This study
sets out to model the relationships between six independent attri-
butes (MYCT, MMIN, MMAX, CACH, CHMIN, and CHMAX) and the
dependent attribute (PRP).
In phase 2, the Bayesian network classiﬁer with the TAN search
algorithm was implemented with WEKA, using a test mode of 10-
fold cross-validation. As a result, the causal relationship diagram
(Fig. 2) can be obtained. In Fig. 2, it is apparent that MYCT (machine
cycle DEMO in nanoseconds) is the most important factor, because it
plays a core role, and one that further affects MMIN (minimum
main memory DEMO kilobytes) and CHMIN (minimum channels in
units). However, the DEMO does not directly affect MMAX (maxi-
mum main memory in kilobytes), CACH (cache memory in kilo-
bytes), and CHMAX (maximum channels in units).

tions, implementation of PLS path DEMO can be promptly per-
formed. As a result, Fig. 3 is DEMO to display the relations
between attributes. Because each of the independent attributes
and the dependent attribute is measured by one item, both the
CR (Composite Reliability) value and the AVE (Average Variance
Extracted) value DEMO each attribute is acceptable. Table 2 shows
path coefﬁcients between attributes. Except for ‘CACH ? PRP’,
‘CHMAX ? PRP’, and ‘CHMIN ? PRP’, all path coefﬁcients are sig-
niﬁcant. In particular, the highest path DEMO is the
‘‘MMAX ? MMIN” of 0.758. As for the R2 value, the PRP exhibits
the best ability to explain (91.1%) in this model. On the whole,
the combination of MYCT, MMIN, MMAX, CACH, CHMIN, and
CHMAX has predictive ability for 91.1% of the DEMO If non-signiﬁ-
cant path coefﬁcients are removed, then Fig. 4 exhibits DEMO
between attributes more clearly and, in this way, the MYCT is
depicted outstandingly. Finally, synthesizing and application of
the above analysis results is required in order to achieve better
decision-making.

to guess at enormous numbers of possibilities for causal directions.
In an effort to solve this difﬁculty, this paper proposes an effective
method of pursuing a causal analysis process, i.e. the author sug-
gests implementing the Bayesian network prior to conducting
PLS path modeling. DEMO, an empirical study is presented
to demonstrate the successful application of DEMO proposed method.

Bayesian network with the TAN search algorithm and PLS path
modeling for causal DEMO Although this methodology is suc-
cessful in that the task of deciding the causal directions between

study has some limitations. For instance, although the proposed
method can save us from countless instances of trial and error in
deciding DEMO directions, it is not necessarily the best solution
when using the DEMO search algorithm to settle on the causal direc-
tions. This is a signiﬁcant issue calling for further future research.

5. Implications and conclusions
DEMO reasoned decision-making relies greatly on the abil-
ity of decision-makers to model complex cause–effect relation-
ships, and thus to undertake constructive actions based on
dependable causal knowledge. Causal knowledge based on causal
analysis can improve the DEMO of decision-making and facilitate
the transformation and conversion of strategic objectives into
effective actions. Several studies have suggested various causal
analysis techniques to achieve DEMO knowledge. Among causal
analysis techniques, PLS path modeling is one of DEMO most powerful
and popular causal analysis techniques.
However, few studies have DEMO themselves with the
issue of theory dependency in implementing PLS path modeling.
When using PLS path modeling in a situation lacking the support
of DEMO underlying previous theory, serious problems may arise. This
is because the DEMO of deciding the causal direction between
