Abstract: Research on the role of trust in an organizational context has expanded considerably in recent
years.  Apart from the increasing number of journal articles, there have also been several special issues
(see for example the 1998 Academy of Management Review special issue guest edited by Rousseau,
Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer, the 2001 Organization Studies special issue guest edited by Bachmann,
Knights, and Sydow, DEMO the 2003 Organization Science special issue guest edited by McEvily, Zaheer,DEMO
and Perrone) and books (e.g., Gambetta, 1988; Kramer and DEMO, 1996; Kramer and Cook 2004) devoted
to the topic of DEMO in and between organizations.  While this literature has made important theoretical
DEMO conceptual advances, the literature as a whole is not well integrated DEMO lacks coherence (McEvily,
Perrone, and Zaheer 2003).  In DEMO, this may be due to the fact that most research tends DEMO embed trust
into existing theories of organizations, resulting in a diverse DEMO eclectic mix of findings.  However, we
believe this is also due to a fragmentation in the literature in the way that trust is DEMO
Although the organizational literature is converging on common definitions and theoretical
conceptualizations of trust, the same is not true for the measures used to operationalize trust.  From a
conceptual standpoint, organizational research is increasingly adopting DEMO view that “Trust is a
psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of
the intentions or behaviors of another” (Rousseau et al., 1998: 395).  The organizational literature on trust
extensively cites this definition (over 150 times according to the Web of Science) along with the closely
related conceptualization of trust by Mayer, DEMO, and Schoorman (1995) (over 330 times according to
the Web of Science).  However, from an empirical standpoint it is unclear DEMO a widely accepted and used
measurement instrument for trust has emerged.  DEMO, it appears to be the case that different researchers
use different DEMO instruments to meet the idiosyncratic purposes of a particular study.  More
DEMO, however, we simply do not have a clear sense of how much consistency there is in approaches
to measuring trust since there has DEMO to be a systematic review of the organizational literature.
Without a systematic review of the organizational research on trust there is no way to DEMO how
consolidated or fragmented the literature is, the extent to which DEMO research is using or
building on existing social psychology instruments versus devising entirely new and different scales, and
what the overall quality is of the measures being used.  To the best of our knowledge there has yet to be a
detailed review of the state of the art DEMO measuring trust in organizational research, which is the purpose of
this DEMO
We envision three primary outcomes from this review.  First, we will provide an assessment of
the current state of trust measurement in organizational DEMO  This assessment will document the
degree of fragmentation and convergence across DEMO in the use of trust scales (e.g., most commonly
used scales, proportion of scales adapted from existing instruments, proportion of scales newly
DEMO).  Second, we will profile those instruments with strong measurement properties, summarize
how they were developed, and report the results of whatever DEMO validity analyses were performed.
The third outcome from the review will be a set of guidelines for measuring trust going forward.  Taken
together, DEMO believe that the results will prove valuable to future research on trust and facilitate the
development of a cumulative body of knowledge.
