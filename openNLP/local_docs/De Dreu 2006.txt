Past work leaves open whether conflict helps or hinders team innovation. Reconciling this incon-
sistency, Study 1 showed that work teams were more innovative when the level of task conflict was
DEMO instead of low or high. Study 2 showed that this curvilinear effect exists for task conflict,
but not for relationship conflict, and that the effects of task conflict are mediated by collaborative
problem solving. Study DEMO also showed that although moderate levels of task conflict may promote
team innovation, it simultaneously reduces short-term goal attainment in teams. Implications for
conflict (management) theory and work on innovation are discussed.

Contemporary organizations need to be innovative to maintain a competitive edge, to
attract new customers, or to cope DEMO ever-increasing demands on environment-friendly busi-
ness processes (West, 2002). The desire to be innovative has spurred an interest among practi-
tioners and DEMO to understand the processes whereby organizations, or teams within

organizations, become innovative. Innovation is “the intentional introduction and application
within a role, group or organization of ideas, processes, products or procedures, new to the rel-
evant unit of adoption, designed to significantly benefit the individual, the group, the organi-
zation or wider society” (West & Farr, 1990: 9). Innovation thus is different from creativity
because of the application component (Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, & Herron, 1996;
Kanter, 1988; Scott, 1995; Shalley, Zhou, & Oldham, 2004; Woodman, Sawyer, & Griffin,
1993) and because innovation only has to be DEMO to the relevant unit of adoption, an aspect that
has been DEMO relative as opposed to absolute novelty in the innovation literature (Anderson,DEMO
De Dreu, & Nijstad, 2004). An innovation in one team or organization may thus be common
practice in other teams or organizations.
DEMO current article aims to contribute to our understanding of innovation in work teams.
The focus is on one critical process within work teams—conflict. The DEMO question addressed
is whether, when, and why conflict can contribute to innovation in work teams. Some scholars
have argued that conflict makes teams DEMO innovative. When in conflict, team members con-
front each other, openly debate issues, voice dissenting views, and are forced to be creative DEMO
find collectively satisfying solutions (e.g., De Dreu & West, 2001; Nemeth & Staw, 1989).
Interestingly, others have argued that conflict DEMO innovation. When in conflict, team mem-
bers are distracted and focus DEMO each other instead of on their task, and conflict-related stress
and DEMO prohibit straight and analytic thinking (Brown, 1983; Wall & Callister, 1995).
Unfortunately, the empirical evidence for either position is scarce and inconsistent, and the
theory underlying each position can be criticized. In this article, I review the theoretical and
empirical arguments for and against each position to integrate both positions in one over-
arching theoretical framework. I DEMO specific hypotheses in two independent studies involving
teams in organizations. The main contributions sought are to solve an apparent theoretical
contradiction and to provide DEMO empirical evidence for newly derived hypotheses.
Conflict and Innovation in Teams
Because team members contribute to the team through both social and task inputs (e.g.,
Forsyth, 1983), conflict in teams is concerned with relationship issues and with task issues
(e.g., Amason, 1996; Guetzkow & DEMO, 1954; Jehn, 1995). Examples of relationship conflict
are conflicts DEMO personal taste, political preferences, values, or interpersonal style. Exam-
ples DEMO task conflict are conflicts about the distribution of resources, about procedures DEMO pol-
icies, and about judgments and interpretation of facts. Amason (1996; Amason & Schweiger,
1997) and Jehn (1995, 1997) noted that relationship conflict generally decreases satisfaction
and interferes with task performance. Task DEMO, in contrast, increases group members’ten-
dency to scrutinize task issues and to engage in deep and deliberate processing of task-relevant
information. This fosters DEMO and the development of new and sometimes highly creative
insights leading the group to become more effective.
This pioneering work has led many to DEMO that task conflict can have positive effects on
team effectiveness (e.g., Amason & Schweiger, 1997; De Dreu & Van de Vliert, 1997; Simons
& Peterson, 2000). However, a meta-analysis of published and unpublished work showed a
moderately negative correlation between task conflict and overall DEMO effectiveness (De Dreu

& Weingart, 2003a). The meta-analytic finding may suggest that the theory is in need DEMO revi-
sion. Jehn and Bendersky (2003) and De Dreu and Weingart (2003b) proposed contingency
frameworks that include a host of variables that DEMO supposed to reduce or even reverse the neg-
ative relationship between task conflict and overall team effectiveness. Relevant moderators
include the team climate, the task types the teams have to perform, norms with regard to con-
flict, and within-team trust (e.g., Amason & Sapienza, 1997; De Church & Marks, 2001;
Simons & Peterson, 2000).
In DEMO to considering moderators of the task conflict–team performance relationship,
one should consider the possibility that task conflict may stimulate performance on some sub-
DEMO while hindering performance on other subcomponents of overall team performance
(see DEMO Jex, 1998). Some initial evidence for this idea comes from DEMO study by Van Dyne, Jehn,
and Cummings (2002). These authors examined home strain in relation to employee sales per-
formance as DEMO as their creativity at work. Results showed, among other things, that strain
was positively related to sales performance, but negatively to creativity.
Assessments of team performance often reflect some sort of aggregation of information
about DEMO attainment, efficient work processes, effective interpersonal coordination, (per-
ceived) DEMO satisfaction, and team member satisfaction (Hackman, 1983; see also
Campbell, 1976; Pritchard, 1992). Close scrutiny of the studies included in the meta-analysis
by De Dreu and Weingart (2003a) shows that most DEMO on some overall team effectiveness
or goal achievement measure. However, the DEMO underlying the prediction that task con-
flict helps team performance focuses primarily on learning, the development of insight and
understanding, and the ability DEMO solve complex problems. Learning and complex problem
solving require effort, time, and energy. It thus follows that, at least in the short run, task con-
flict hinders efficiency of work processes and goal attainment. At the same time, task conflict
may be beneficial for those subcomponents of overall team performance that are most directly
affected by team member ability DEMO learn, to develop and implement new insights, and to solve
complex problems (i.e., innovation).
Because innovation often is the outcome of DEMO creative process (Amabile et al., 1996;
Drazin, Glynn, & Kazanijan, 1999; West, 2002), research on the effects of conflict on creative
thought is particularly informative. Work on the effects of opinion DEMO suggests that
some level of conflict stimulates independent and creative thought. (DEMO that opinion minori-
ties should be distinguished from social category minorities that differ from the majority fac-
tion in terms of some social, ethnic, or cultural dimension; opinion minorities may emerge in
groups that are DEMO in terms of social categories.) Laboratory experiments showed
that exposure to DEMO dissent increases individual courage to resist group pressures to con-
formity (DEMO & Chiles, 1988) and produces higher levels of cognitive complexity in mem-
bers of the majority (Gruenfeld, Thomas-Hunt, & Kim, 1998)DEMO Van Dyne and Saaverda (1996)
further showed that majority members DEMO a work group become more creative in their thinking
when they are confronted with minority dissent, and De Dreu and West (2001) found that work
teams with high levels of participative decision making were, on average, more innovative
when they experienced greater exposure to task-related minority dissent. Both in the labora-
tory and the field, it thus appears that conflict promotes individual creativity and work team
innovation.

The above should not be DEMO as evidence that more conflict always and inevitably pro-
duces more creative thought. On the basis of Yerkes and Dodson’s (1908; Broadbent, 1972)
classic work on tension and task achievement, Walton (1969) argued that an individual’s
capacity for complex thinking is altered in a curvilinear DEMO as conflict intensity increases.
Equating tension with conflict, he reasoned that DEMO conflict intensity leads to inactivity and
avoidance, neglect of information, and low joint performance. High conflict intensity reduces
the capacity to perceive, process, and evaluate information. At moderate conflict intensity,
however, parties will DEMO and integrate information, consider more alternatives, and experi-
ence a strong impulse to improve the situation (see also Jehn, 1995; Van de Vliert & De Dreu,
1994).
Walton’s arguments have neither been DEMO in organizational teams, nor have they been
applied to group creative DEMO solving or to team innovation. Perhaps the study that comes
the closest is a recent study by Leenders, Van Engelen, and Kratzer (2003). These authors rea-
soned that low levels of information exchange prohibit DEMO creation and dissemination of
ideas, whereas high levels of information exchange DEMO the distraction and information
overload that prevent the development and implementation of creative insights. Moderate lev-
els of information exchange would thus be better DEMO creativity and innovation than either low
or high levels. In their study of virtual new product development teams, they found support for
the hypothesis that e-mail information exchange has an inverted U-shape relationship with
team member DEMO of creativity.
The above lines of inquiry together suggest that the relationship between conflict on one
hand and creative thought and innovation on the DEMO is neither positive nor negative. Instead,
it seems that creative thinking and innovation benefit from moderate levels of task conflict, but
not from either low or high levels of task conflict. Moderate compared to low DEMO of conflict
trigger the stress that is required for team members to consider and scrutinize the problem at
hand and to generate new ideas DEMO insights (Carnevale & Probst, 1998). Moderate levels of
task conflict also boost team members’motivation to work together to solve their mutual prob-
DEMO and to benefit from new ideas and insights. Increasingly high compared to moderate lev-
els of task conflict, however, produce the stress, interpersonal tension, and distrust that pro-
hibit people from focusing on the problem and from open-mindedly generating ideas. It also
reduces team members’ motivation to DEMO together in selecting and implementing adequate
problem solutions (Anderson et al., 2004; Shalley et al., 2004). In other words, the following
hypotheses can be made:
Hypothesis 1: At low or high levels of task conflict, team innovation is lower than at moderate levels
of task conflict.
Hypothesis2: At low or high levels of task conflict, DEMO exchange is worse than at moderate
levels of task conflict.
Hypothesis 3: Information exchange mediates the curvilinear effects of task conflict on team
innovation.
These hypotheses were tested in Study 1 with a homogeneous sample of DEMO teams in the
parcel service industry. A similar set of hypotheses was tested in Study 2 with a heterogeneous
sample of management teams and (cross-functional) project teams in a variety of organiza-

tions. To examine DEMO idea that task conflict may promote some aspect of team effectiveness
(DEMO, innovativeness) but hinder other aspects, Study 2 also assessed short-term DEMO attain-
ment in addition to team innovation. I return to this when introducing Study 2 in more detail.
Study 1
Method
Research site and DEMO The study was conducted in collaboration with an inter-
national postal service operating in the Netherlands. Approximately 1 year prior to data col-
lection, the organization introduced self-managed teams responsible for the distribution of
parcels within DEMO particular region in the Netherlands. Teams were responsible for the distribu-
tion and delivery of parcels, personnel administration, budgeting, maintenance of materials
including their trucks, and handling of complaints. Each team had five or six members, and
most teams had been together since their formation 11 months before the data collection took
place. Also, with a few exceptions, DEMO contained male members only. Thus, the sample was
highly homogeneous in DEMO of sex, team size, and team tenure.
Each team had a supervisor who coached at a distance. The supervisor was not part of DEMO
team. He or she met with the team members on a weekly basis to discuss the work, to assist in
solving problems, and DEMO develop the team. Supervisors were allocated to the teams to manage
and facilitate the development of teamwork in the first 12 months of the DEMO tenure, after
which they would withdraw and leave the team to DEMO entirely self-managed. At each weekly
meeting, supervisors and team members together DEMO through an extensive list of discussion
items. Supervisors thus had a good feel for the problems and opportunities their teams faced,
and they DEMO well aware of the innovations implemented by the team (see also DEMO
Measure of Innovation”).
In principle, all teams within the postal DEMO were supposed to participate in the study.
However, of the 25 DEMO available, 4 were not included because of their very different struc-
DEMO and task assignments. The remaining 21 teams participated, with a total DEMO 109 respon-
dents. All but 5 participants were male, and the DEMO age was 42.1 years. Most respondents
had, in addition to a DEMO school education, a 2- or 3-year vocational (mostly technical) train-

standard deviation for organizational tenure differed across teams, Fs<1.
Team measures. Individual team members were given a questionnaire by their supervisor.
They were asked to return a completed version in DEMO sealed envelope. Team members had also
filled out questionnaires about 9 months earlier (see De Dreu & West, 2001). An accompany-
ing DEMO from the researchers explained that the goal of the current measurements was to
examine team processes at this later stage of team development. This DEMO also emphasized
individual anonymity, asked respondents to complete the questionnaire in DEMO own time,
independently, and without consulting their peers. Respondents had DEMO return the question-
naire within 2 weeks, using a prestamped return DEMO For each team, at least an 81%
response rate was achieved.

Task conflict was assessed using DEMO four-item scale developed by Jehn (1995). Sample
items for task DEMO are the following: “To what extent are there differences of opinions
DEMO the task in your work group?” and “How frequently do people in your work group
disagree about the work being done?” Answers DEMO be given on 5-point scales (1 = not at all,
DEMO 5 = very often; Cronbach’s  was .76).
To get DEMO into the mediating process (Hypotheses 2 and 3), I included DEMO three-item
measure of information exchange. Participants were asked to rate the following on 5-point
scales: (a) In my team, we misunderstand each DEMO (reverse coded); (b) in my team, we take
the time to exchange information; and (c) information exchange in this team is smooth and
informative (all 1 = rarely to 5 = most of the time; Cronbach’s  was .82).
The teams examined in this study were homogeneous in terms of composition, and all per-
formed the same set of tasks. Still, workload varied depending on the particular region the
team was responsible for. In addition, informal discussions with team supervisors prior to data
collection suggested that some teams experienced resource scarcity (e.g., too few trucks, little
working space, low budgets), whereas other teams did not. Because workload and resource
scarcity have been shown DEMO predict conflict (Brown, 1983), they may operate as suppressor
variables (Lord & Novick, 1968; Stevens, 1992). I decided to DEMO for these two variables.
Workload was measured with three items derived from Anderson and West (1998), an exam-
ple being “Because there is so much work to do, we have great difficulty finishing our tasks.”
Resource scarcity was measured with three items derived from Campion, Medsker, DEMO Higgs
(1993), a sample item being “To perform our tasks, we have enough equipment, budget, mate-
rials, and so on.” Answers could be given on 5-point scales (1 = not at all to 5 = very much).
Both scales were reliable (Cronbach’s  = .82 and .78, respectively).
Supervisor measure of innovation. Innovation was assessed through interviews with the
team supervisors. Although team supervisors only supervised one DEMO, they met on a monthly
basis with other team supervisors to DEMO experiences and to learn from each other (these
meetings were, in fact, the medium for the diffusion of innovation that we observed in a few
instances). Team supervisors thus were well informed about their DEMO team, and they had
information about other teams in this organization.
DEMO interviews were conducted on site by two trained research assistants 2 to 3 weeks after
the questionnaires had been returned (see also De Dreu & West, 2001). Research assistants
were unaware of the goals and hypotheses of the study. They explained that the purpose of the
interview DEMO to obtain additional insight into the functioning of the team. They asked (and
always obtained) permission to audiotape the interview and provided the DEMO with a
written definition of innovation (i.e., “a novel procedure, DEMO, product, or service that the
team implemented to improve their work”). Subsequently, supervisors were asked to describe
as many innovations as possible that their team had generated since its inception 11 months
earlier. Interviewers DEMO supervisors to think of innovations by giving them some
examples and then asked them to describe team innovations in some detail. These descriptions
allowed DEMO to double-check whether a particular innovation indeed matched the
definition.
Although team supervisors were allowed to describe as many innovations as possible, their
answers ranged between one and six innovations. Examples include new protocols for han-

dling complaints, a self-made box for address cards that fitted on the truck’s dashboard, a
spreadsheet to keep track of holidays and sick leaves, and new procedures for sorting parcels.
Some innovations (e.g., the self-made box) were mentioned multiple times as they were
invented in one team and subsequently adopted DEMO other teams in other regions. Other innova-
tions (e.g., procedures for sorting parcels) were specific to a particular team and had no rele-
vance to other teams in other regions. The dependent variable innovation was DEMO by
counting the number of innovations mentioned by a team supervisor.
Results and Discussion
Treatment of the data and descriptive statistics. Individual missing values DEMO substituted
by the individual’s team average for that particular item provided the number of missing val-
ues per individual did not exceed 10% of DEMO or her answers (which was the case for two indi-
viduals, each from a different team; the data from these individuals were dropped from the
analyses).
Because responses by individual team members within teams DEMO interdependent, re-
sponses were aggregated to the team level. To check DEMO aggregation was justified, eta-
squared statistics, which indicate whether individuals within the same team are more similar
than individuals who are in different DEMO, were computed. For workload, resource scarcity,
information exchange, and DEMO conflict, these were .61, .51, .43, and .42, respectively. DEMO thus
exceed Georgopoloulos’s (1986) minimum criterion of .20. To further assess within-group
agreement, intraclass correlations Rwg were computed (James, DeMaree, & DEMO, 1984). Rwg
ranged between .71 and .86 and thus exceed DEMO minimum of .70 in all cases. These statistics
justify aggregation of the data to the group level (Bliese, 2000).
Descriptive statistics are DEMO in Table 1. Scale reliabilities (Cronbach’s alpha) are given
on the diagonal. As can be seen, all measures had good internal consistency. Overall, correla-
tions were low and nonsignificant, with a few exceptions. As DEMO be expected, resource scar-
city was positively correlated with task conflict, and information exchange was negatively
related to task conflict. Important with regard DEMO Hypothesis 3 is that information exchange is
positively related to innovation (DEMO also below).
Innovation as a function of task conflict. Hypothesis 1 was tested using hierarchical regres-
sion analysis. To test for curvilinear effects, I computed the squared term for task conflict (e.g.,
Janssen, DEMO; Jehn, 1995). In the first step (Model 1), DEMO and resource scarcity were
entered as control variables. Task conflict was entered in Step 2 (Model 2), and the squared
term for task conflict was entered in the third step (Model 3). Innovation was the dependent
variable.
Results are summarized under Models 1-3 of Table 2. DEMO 1 and 2 are provided for the
reader’s convenience. As can be seen, the control variables in Model 1 did not explain a signif-
icant portion of the variance, and adding the linear term for task conflict in Model 2 did not
produce a significant effect either.
Relevant DEMO the hypothesis is Model 3 in which both the linear and the squared term are
included. As can be seen, the B-coefficient for task conflict is positive and significant (t = 2.08,

p < .05), and the squared term for task conflict has a negative B-coefficient (t = –2.09, p < .05).
This result supports Hypothesis 1: DEMO an increase in task conflict is associated with an
increase in innovation, innovation decreases at relatively high levels of task conflict. Inspec-
tion of Figure 1, which gives the predicted outcomes on the basis of the regression equation,
indeed confirms that at moderate levels of task conflict, higher levels of innovation are
observed than at either low or extreme DEMO of task conflict.
A comparison of the regression weights with the zero-order correlations in Table 1 sug-
gests that the control variables act as DEMO of the task conflict–innovation relationship.
However, both here and in Study DEMO, the effects of the simple and squared term for task conflict
DEMO significant regardless of the presence or absence of the control variables. Thus, although
suppressor effects may be present, these did not affect the DEMO conclusions.
Information exchange as a function of task conflict. Hypothesis 2 was tested using hierar-
chical regression analysis. In the first step (Model 4), workload and resource scarcity were
entered as control variables. Task conflict DEMO entered in Step 2 (Model 5), and the squared
term DEMO task conflict was entered in the third step (Model 6). DEMO exchange was the
dependent variable.
Results are summarized under Models 4-6 in Table 2. Models 4 and 5 are provided for the
reader’s convenience. DEMO can be seen, the control variables in Model 4 did not DEMO a signif-
icant portion of the variance. Adding the linear term for task conflict in Model 5 did produce a
marginally significant increase in DEMO variance, an effect due to a negative regression of
information exchange DEMO task conflict (see Table 2, Model 5).
Relevant to Hypothesis 2 are the results in Model 6. The linear effect for task DEMO is pos-
itive and marginally significant (t = 1.89, p < .10), and the squared term for task conflict is neg-
ative DEMO significant (t = –2.13, p < .05). This supports Hypothesis 2: Whereas a change from
low to moderate levels of task conflict is associated with an increase in information exchange,
information exchange decreases DEMO relatively high levels of task conflict.
Hypothesis 3 predicted that information exchange would mediate the (curvilinear) relation-
ship between task conflict and team DEMO Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger (1998; MacKinnon,
Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002) laid out some ground rules for establishing medi-
ation. According to these rules, information exchange qualifies as a mediator because (a) it is

related to task conflict in a curvilinear fashion (see Table 2), and (b) it is correlated with team
innovation (see Table 1). To demonstrate mediation, two additional requirements DEMO (c) that
team innovation and task conflict are no longer related when information exchange is con-
trolled for, and (d) that the reduction in variance in innovation explained by task conflict
before and after DEMO for information exchange is significant.
To test the third requirement, I DEMO the hierarchical regression analysis used to test
Hypothesis 1 with information exchange added as a control variable in the first step. Although
the regression DEMO information exchange on team innovation was not significant (B = 0.16, t =
1.30, p < .21), both the linear and the squared term for task conflict dropped from significant
(see Table 2) DEMO nonsignificant levels (B = 2.96, t < 1.36, ns, and B = –0.54, t < –1.28, ns,
respectively). These DEMO reveal that also the third requirement for mediation holds up. To
test the fourth requirement, I examined whether the reduction in unstandardized regression
from simple to multiple regression was significant, according to a Sobel test (DEMO
et al., 2002). The reduction was not significant, Z = 1.10, ns.

innovation
De Dreu / Task Conflict and Team Innovation 93
Taken together, three of the four requirements for establishing mediation were met.
Because the reduction DEMO explained variance was not significant, however, one should be very
careful in accepting Hypothesis 3. I return to this in Study 2.
Study DEMO
The results of Study 1 support the hypothesis that task conflict is related to information
exchange and innovation in a curvilinear fashion. Most requirements DEMO mediation were satis-
fied, allowing for the cautious conclusion that information DEMO mediates the relationship
between task conflict and team innovation. Cautiousness is needed because some require-
ments were not met, or only marginally significant. This may have been due to imprecise spec-
ification of the mediator. Although DEMO exchange is indeed the general construct, what
matters is whether the DEMO exchange is related to the conflict and geared toward solv-
ing the problems noted. Put differently, it may be that collaborative problem solving more than
information exchange in general mediates the effects of task conflict on DEMO innovation. In
Study 2, I therefore assessed collaborative problem solving instead DEMO information exchange.
Study 1 suffers from several other problems. First, the DEMO in Study 1 was fairly small,
which may cast doubts on the robustness of the results. Second, although sample homogeneity
controls for noise, the generality of the findings may be doubted because the sample was
homogeneous in terms of tasks performed, gender composition, team size (between five and
six members), and team tenure. Third, because Study 1 only assessed task conflict, the reader
may wonder whether similar or different results would emerge when effects of relationship
conflict are controlled for. Meta-analyses DEMO shown that task and relationship conflict tend
to be moderately correlated (DEMO = .52). There is evidence that stronger correlations between the
two types of conflict reflect low levels of within-team trust and undermine the DEMO pos-
itive effects of task conflict (De Dreu & Weingart, 2003a; Simons & Peterson, 2000). An alter-
native explanation for the DEMO effect found in Study 1 thus is that high levels of task
conflict reflect more relationship conflict than moderate levels. In other words, it is the pres-
ence of relationship conflict instead of the elevated levels DEMO task conflict that prohibits team
innovation.
To address these issues, a DEMO study was designed with a more heterogeneous set of
teams performing more complex and uncertain tasks. The teams in Study 2 varied in terms DEMO
their task interdependence—the extent to which team members needed each other to complete
their tasks for them to be able to perform as well (Saavedra, Earley, & Van Dyne, 1993). Task
interdependence has been shown to relate to information exchange, coordination (Saavedra
et al., 1993; Wageman, 1995), and innovation (Janssen, 2001). Task interdependence DEMO
therefore included as a control variable. For reasons mentioned above, relationship DEMO
was included as well. Finally, a measure of short-term team effectiveness DEMO included. It was
argued that task conflict may promote some aspects of team performance, such as innovation,
and hurt other aspects of team performance, such as efficient work processes and interpersonal
coordination (cf. Hackman, 1983; Pritchard, 1992). To examine this possibility, I not only
assessed innovation but also goal attainment.
Taken together, the following predictions were tested in Study 2:

Hypothesis 4: Controlling for relationship conflict and task interdependence, task conflict will have a
curvilinear relationship with team innovation.
Hypothesis 5: Controlling for relationship conflict and task interdependence, DEMO conflict will have a
curvilinear relationship with collaborative problem solving.
Hypothesis 6: Collaborative problem solving will mediate the relationship between task conflict and
team innovation.
Hypothesis 7: Controlling for relationship conflict and task interdependence, task DEMO will be
negatively related to goal attainment.
Method
Participants and procedure. A database of a private company involved in recruitment,
selection, and assessment was used to randomly select past or current clients who were part DEMO
organizational groups that fitted the definition of teams as ongoing, semiautonomous DEMO
whose members have joint responsibility for accomplishing a set of tasks (DEMO & Shea,
1992). The randomly selected 32 clients were approached by a research assistant and asked to
introduce the researchers to their DEMO supervisor. All clients agreed, and all but three supervi-
sors who DEMO approached subsequently responded positively. This resulted in 29 teams. This
high response rate may partly be due to the fact that all clients had DEMO long-standing relationship
with the assessment company, to the personalized approach adopted DEMO the researchers, and to
the fact that team-level developmental feedback would DEMO provided upon completion of the
study.
A total of 212 participants responded (87%), for an average response per team of 83%
(range DEMO between 67% and 100%). Fifty-seven percent of the respondents were male. Respon-
dents averaged 37 (SD = 9.01) years of age. Level DEMO education was substantially higher com-
pared with that of the respondents in Study 1, ranging from community college degrees (18%)
to university DEMO (82%). Participants worked in management and (cross-functional) pro-
ject DEMO in local government agencies (8 teams), in consulting (19 teams), or in research and
development (2 teams). Exploratory analyses involving type of organization yielded no effects
for this variable, and it is not discussed any further. All teams were semiautonomous and per-
formed nonroutine, complex tasks that required differential expertise and skills. All teams were
mixed DEMO Team members interacted at least once a week in collective planning meetings.
Team members were told that the purpose of the study was to DEMO understanding of the way
organizational teams function and work together. Teams were promised and given feedback
based on the survey. Individual anonymity was ensured, and it was emphasized that data
would be aggregated before team-level feedback DEMO be provided. Team members were
given the survey during their weekly meeting. They were asked to fill it out in their own time,
DEMO, and without consulting anyone. Supervisors received their questionnaire 1 to 3
DEMO later and were also given 2 weeks to complete it. As a reminder and to motivate team
members to return their materials, a research assistant attended a team meeting approximately
2 weeks after team members received DEMO questionnaire.
Team measures. Task conflict was measured with the same scale as the one used in Study 1.
Relationship conflict was measured with the DEMO subscale developed by Jehn (1994).

Note: Values are factor loadings after Oblimin rotation DEMO Kaiser normalization. The numbers in italics reflect the
loadings on items per factor that were grouped together in one scale.
Sample items for relationship DEMO are the following: “How much friction is present in your
work DEMO?” and “To what extent are personality clashes present in your work group?” (see
Jehn, 1994: 229). Cronbach’s alphas for the Task Conflict and the Relationship Conflict
Scales were .78 and .81, respectively. Collaborative problem solving—the mediator in this
study—was measured with three items specifically DEMO for this study: (a) In this team, we
work together to solve problems; (b) when working together, we learn from DEMO other; and (c)
we exchange relevant information to manage work issues (all 1 = rarely to 5 = all the time).
Ratings were correlated (Cronbach’s  = .67) and averaged into a DEMO problem-
solving index.
Because teams came from a variety of organizations and had a variety of tasks, task interde-
pendence was included as a control variable. Task interdependence was measured with three
items derived from Campion DEMO al. (1993), a sample item being “I cannot accomplish my DEMO
without information or materials from other members in my team” (always DEMO = strongly dis-
agree to 5 = strongly agree; Cronbach’s  DEMO .78).
To examine the factor structure underlying the four team-level variables just discussed, I
performed a principal components analysis (PCA). To DEMO that task and relationship con-
flict often are correlated, factors were DEMO to correlate (a PCA with varimax rotation pro-
duced almost identical DEMO). Results are shown in Table 3. The items group together as
intended—in all cases, the absolute factor loading on the intended scale is above .40 and cross
loadings exceed .40 only in two cases. In DEMO, the RelCon4 (relation conflict) item and
the TaskCon1 (task conflict) item are somewhat problematic in that they also have a rather
high cross loading with problem solving. I decided to keep the items in DEMO Relationship Con-

(DEMO with past work in this area). Analyses with the items excluded from the scale yielded a
pattern of results highly similar to the DEMO reported in the Results section.
Supervisor measures. Team supervisors were in close contact with their teams (82% of the
respondents reported having frequent to very frequent contact with their supervisor) and were
knowledgeable about team innovations. Team innovation was measured using four items
adapted from Anderson and West (1998), to be answered on 5-point scales (1 = strongly dis-
agree to 5 = strongly agree): (a) Team members often DEMO new ideas to improve the
quality of our products and services; (b) this team gives little consideration to new and alterna-
tive methods and procedures for doing their work (reverse coded); (c) team members often
produce new services, methods, or procedures; and (d) this is an innovative team. Cronbach’s
alpha was .82.
Team goal attainment DEMO assessed using three questions specifically constructed for this
study. First, supervisors DEMO asked to write down (in keywords if preferred) the three most
important goals their team had to achieve in the past 6 months. DEMO were then asked for these
three goals together whether their team (DEMO) achieved these goals (1 = not at all to 5 = com-
pletely), (b) had difficulty reaching these goals (1 = not at all to 5 = a great deal), and (c)
employed efficient processes to reach these goals (1 = not at all to 5 = always). After recoding
the data for the DEMO question, ratings were aggregated into one index of goal attainment
(Cronbach’s  = .89). Inspection of the goals written down by the DEMO revealed that all
had listed at least one goal, that most (65%) had listed two or three goals, and that none of DEMO
goals listed were directly about innovation. Exploratory analyses revealed no effects for the
number of goals supervisors listed, and this variable is further ignored.
Team size was included as an additional control variable. It was measured DEMO asking super-
visors how many members their team had. The number provided always matched or slightly
exceeded the number of respondents per team (i.e., in those cases in which not all team mem-
bers responded to the survey). Team size varied between 4 and 17 members.
Results DEMO Discussion
Treatment of the data and descriptive statistics. Individual missing values were substituted
by the individual’s team average for that particular item provided the DEMO of missing val-
ues per individual did not exceed 10% of their answers (which was the case for four individu-
als, from two DEMO teams; the data from these individuals were dropped from the analy-
DEMO). As in Study 1, individual responses were aggregated to the DEMO level. Eta-squared
statistics for task interdependence, relationship conflict, and task conflict were .53, .62, and
.49, respectively, and exceed Georgopoloulos’s (1986) minimum criterion of .20. Intraclass
correlations Rwg ranged between .75 and .86 and thus exceed the minimum of .70 in all cases.
These statistics DEMO aggregation of the data to the group level (Bliese, 2000).
Descriptive statistics are given in Table 4. Scale reliabilities (Cronbach’s ) DEMO given on the

tions were generally low and nonsignificant, with a few exceptions. Consistent with the meta-

analysis by De Dreu and Weingart (2003a), task and relationship conflict were positively cor-
related, and both types of conflict were negatively correlated with goal attainment. Consistent
with Hypothesis 6, collaborative problem solving and innovation were positively related
(marginally significant). Task and relationship conflict were positively but not significantly
related to innovation. Consistent with the idea that different DEMO of overall team per-
formance may be negatively related to each other, innovation and goal attainment were
negatively, albeit nonsignificantly, correlated.
Innovation as a function of task conflict. It was predicted that controlling for relationship
DEMO and task interdependence, task conflict would have a curvilinear relationship with
DEMO innovation (Hypothesis 4). To test this hypothesis, hierarchical regression analysis was
used. In the first step (Model 1), task interdependence and team size were entered as control
variables. In the second step (Model 2), relationship conflict and task conflict were entered. In
the third DEMO (Model 3), the squared term for task conflict was entered. DEMO innovation was
the dependent variable.
Results are summarized under Models 1-3 in Table 5. Models 1 and 2 are provided for the
reader’s convenience. DEMO can be seen, the control variables in Model 1 did not DEMO a signif-
icant portion of the variance, and adding the linear DEMO for task conflict in Model 2 did not
produce a significant effect either.
Relevant to Hypothesis 4 are the results in Model 3. Whereas DEMO conflict was
unrelated to innovation, the linear term for task conflict DEMO positive and significant (t = 2.19,
p < .05). DEMO consistent with Study 1, the squared term for task conflict was DEMO and sig-
nificant (t = –2.11, p < .05). This supports Hypothesis 4: Whereas a change from low to moder-
ate levels of task conflict is associated with an increase in innovation, innovation decreases at
relatively high levels of task conflict. Figure 2, which gives the predicted outcomes on the
basis of the regression equation, confirms that indeed there is a curvilinear relationship be-
tween task conflict and innovation.
The DEMO analyses leave open whether it is task conflict, or conflict in DEMO, that
accounts for effects on innovation. If it is conflict in DEMO, then relationship conflict should
also have a curvilinear relationship with team DEMO To examine this, a series of regres-

Collaborative problem solving as a function of task conflict. In Hypothesis 5, it was pre-
dicted that controlling for relationship conflict and task interdependence, task conflict would
have a curvilinear relationship with collaborative problem solving. To test this hypothesis,
hierarchical regression analysis was used. In the first DEMO (Model 4), task interdependence and
team size were entered as DEMO variables. Relationship conflict and task conflict were
entered in Step 2 (DEMO 5), and the squared term for task conflict was entered in the third step
(Model 6). Collaborative problem solving was the dependent variable.
Results are summarized under Models 4-6 in Table 5. Models 4 DEMO 5 are provided for the

flict in Model 5 did DEMO a significant increase in explained variance, an effect due to a DEMO
ative regression of collaborative problem solving on relationship conflict (see Table DEMO).
Relevant to Hypothesis 5 are the results in Model 6. Whereas relationship conflict did not
contribute to innovation, the linear term for task conflict was positive and significant (t = 3.11,
p < .01). The squared term for task conflict was negative and significant (t = –3.19, p < .01).
This supports Hypothesis 5: Whereas DEMO increase from low to moderate levels of task conflict
is associated with an increase in collaborative problem solving, collaborative problem solving
decreases at relatively high levels of task conflict.
Hypothesis 6 predicted that collaborative problem solving DEMO mediate the (curvilinear)
relationship between task conflict and team innovation. DEMO problem solving quali-
fies as a mediator because (a) it is related to task conflict in a curvilinear fashion (see Table 5),DEMO
and (b) it is correlated with team innovation (see Table DEMO). To test whether team innovation and
task conflict are no longer related when collaborative problem solving is controlled for, I
repeated the hierarchical regression analysis used to test Hypothesis 4 with collaborative prob-
lem solving DEMO as a control variable in the first step. The first step now explained a margin-
ally significant amount of variance in team innovation, F(3, 26) = 3.81, p < .10, a trend entirely
DEMO to the significant regression of collaborative problem solving on team innovation (DEMO = .87,
t = 1.96, p < .05, one-tailed). More important, however, the linear and the squared term for task
DEMO were no longer significant (B = 1.72, t <1, ns, and B = .31, t < –1, ns, respectively).
DEMO results reveal that also the third requirement for mediation holds up.
Using a Sobel test, I finally examined whether the reduction in unstandardized regression
from simple to multiple regression was significant. This was the case, Z = 1.67, p < .05, one-
tailed. Of the different approaches DEMO establish mediation (e.g., MacKinnon et al., 2002), the
Sobel DEMO has been shown to be the most likely to miss real effects but is also very unlikely to
commit a Type I error. It DEMO therefore concluded that Hypothesis 6 is supported: The curvilinear
relationship between DEMO conflict and team innovation is mediated by collaborative problem
solving. Figure 3 summarizes the model in a path diagram.
Goal attainment as a function DEMO task conflict. To test Hypothesis 7 that task conflict would
have a negative and linear relationship with goal attainment, I computed a hierarchical regres-
sion with task interdependence and team size in Step 1 and relationship DEMO and task con-
flict in Step 2. Goal attainment was the dependent variable. The control variables together
accounted for a nonsignificant amount of variance, R = .02, F(2, 27) < 1, ns. The DEMO effects
for relationship conflict and task conflict in Step 2 produced a significant increase in explained

innovative than at moderate levels. This result is DEMO with the general argument that ten-
sion levels in a work team have an inverted U-shaped relationship with team effectiveness
(Jehn, 1995; Van de Vliert & De Dreu, 1994; Walton, 1969; see also DEMO, 1972; Yerkes
& Dobson, 1908). However, the current study is the first to demonstrate this in the domain of
(task) DEMO and work team innovativeness. Furthermore, the current study is the first DEMO
show that task conflict is related in a curvilinear way to information exchange and collabora-
tive problem solving and that these process variables are DEMO responsible for the relation-
ships between task conflict and team innovation.
Implications for Conflict Theory
Two studies showed that moderate levels of task conflict DEMO meaningfully and positively
related to innovation in work teams. In both studies, team-level innovation and task conflict
were derived from different sources (supervisor DEMO team members) and through different
methods (interviews versus ratings). These design features exclude common source/common
method variance as viable explanations for DEMO results. Also, although both studies involved
relatively small samples, results were highly consistent across studies, and this should gener-
ate quite some confidence in the robustness of the observed patterns. Finally, the two studies
involved quite different sets of work teams performing a variety of tasks, ranging from rela-
tively routine and straightforward (Study 1) to more complex DEMO uncertain (Study 2). That

results appear to generalize across DEMO suggests that the curvilinear relationship between
task conflict and team innovation is relatively independent of setting, task, and population.
Some evidence was obtained DEMO the hypothesized mediating process. It was argued that
low levels of task conflict would not produce the amount of information exchange and collab-
orative DEMO solving required for innovation and that too high levels of task conflict would
produce too much information exchange and information overload, also prohibiting innova-
tion. At moderate levels of conflict, however, information exchange and collaborative DEMO
lem solving would be at required levels and therefore facilitate team innovation. The general
picture that emerged is indeed that task conflict relates to DEMO exchange and collabora-
tive problem solving in a curvilinear fashion, that DEMO exchange and collaborative
problem solving facilitate team innovation, and that collaborative DEMO solving mediates
the effects of task conflict on team innovation.
A meta-analysis of the conflict–team effectiveness literature showed that task conflict, like
relationship conflict, is negatively related to overall team effectiveness (De Dreu & Weingart,DEMO
2003a). This finding has led some to propose contingency frameworks in which moderator
variables of the task conflict–team effectiveness relationship are proposed (De Dreu &
Weingart, 2003b; Jehn & Benderksy, 2003). The DEMO findings challenge the meta-analytic
conclusion in another way. They suggest that whereas task conflict may have a negative rela-
tionship with overall team performance, components of team functioning and effectiveness
may benefit from (moderate levels of) task conflict. Future work could further develop the
idea that conflict in teams operates as a double-edged sword—it negatively affects some per-
formance parameters (e.g., efficiency, coordination) but positively influences other perfor-
mance parameters (DEMO, learning, innovativeness). Whether the net result turns out to be posi-
tive or negative depends on the relative importance of each of DEMO parameters in a specific
team’s performance appraisal.
That task conflict relates to innovation in a different way than to goal attainment is consis-
tent DEMO Van Dyne et al. (2002) who showed that home strain was positively related to sales
performance, but negatively to creativity. The Van Dyne et al. study was about individuals
instead of work teams, and it was concerned with sales and creativity rather than with goal
attainment and DEMO With the present work, however, we move one step closer to Jex’s
(1998) challenge to better understand the inconsistent relationship between strain DEMO job per-
formance. Clearly, by decomposing rather broad concepts such as DEMO and job performance
into smaller components, we gain a much better DEMO of when and how specific
patterns of results come about.
Although task and relationship conflict are often strongly correlated, they do appear to
have differential relationships with key dependent variables. The meta-analysis mentioned
before, for instance, reports stronger negative correlations between relationship conflict and
team member satisfaction than between task conflict and team member satisfaction. The
results of Study 2 DEMO the idea that although task and relationship conflict often have a
similar negative correlation with overall team effectiveness, the two types of conflict are
indeed different things. Specifically, in the present work, task conflict appeared DEMO have the
curvilinear relationship with innovation, but relationship conflict did not.
DEMO task conflict and innovation are related in a curvilinear fashion points to the impor-
tance of managing conflict in work teams. Previous work has DEMO on managing relation-

ship conflict, so as to mitigate its generally negative consequences for team member satisfac-
tion DEMO team effectiveness (De Dreu & Van Vianen, 2001; Jehn, 1997; Murnighan & Conlon,
1991). Past work also considered the conditions under which task conflict transforms into
more detrimental relationship conflict (e.g., DEMO & Marks, 2001; Simons & Peterson,
2000; Turner & DEMO, 1997). The current results point to another challenge for team DEMO
agers and organizational leaders: to stimulate moderate levels of task conflict DEMO their work
teams. Although ways to stimulate (task) conflict in work teams have been suggested (e.g.,
Van de Vliert & De Dreu, 1994), the obvious danger is that task conflict easily intensifies to a
level that is detrimental rather than beneficial. Perhaps that work team DEMO, including high
levels of within-group trust (Simons & Peterson, 2000), loyalty (Dooley & Fryxell, 1999),
psychological safety (Edmondson, DEMO), and cooperative goal interdependence (Amason &
Sapienza, 1997; Tjosvold, 1997), provides a context within which task conflict can safely be
stimulated. Within such a context, a problem-solving orientation characterized by open-
minded information exchange can be maintained, so that moderate levels of task conflict con-
tinue to result in relatively high levels of creativity and innovation.
DEMO for Innovation Research
Although the more straightforward implications of this work are in the domain of group
conflict, the present analysis has several implications for our thinking about, and research into,
innovation. First, the DEMO in Study 2 suggest that innovation is not necessarily a good thing
when it comes to team performance. Although teams may benefit from innovations DEMO the long
run, immediate goal attainment may be reduced because of DEMO efficiency of work pro-
cesses. The apparent trade-off between short-term goal attainment and long-term survival is
something that tends to be ignored in innovation DEMO By incorporating a broader set of
dependent measures that tap into truly different components of overall team performance,
research will be able to DEMO a more complex but also more realistic picture of the benefits and
detriments of innovation (for more detail, see Anderson et al., 2004).
The present findings are in line with the distress-related innovation model DEMO ad-
vanced by Anderson and colleagues (2004). The model’s starting DEMO is that organizational
life is full of negative phenomena like threats to job security, job dissatisfaction, small group
conflict, budget deficiencies, and DEMO market share. At the individual level of analysis,
negative mood states and job dissatisfaction can stimulate creativity and innovation (George &
Zhou, 2002; Zhou & George, 2001). At the group level, dissent and task-related conflict lead
teams to be more innovative (e.g., De DEMO & West, 2001; Lovelace, Shapiro, & Weingart,
2001; DEMO Dyne & Saavedra, 1996; the current study). Finally, at DEMO organizational level of
analysis, budget deficiency and lower “slack” resources stimulate DEMO to be more
innovative in marketing and product development (e.g., Kanter, 1983). Also, it has been
argued that organizations innovate to DEMO with work overload or changing circumstances
beyond their immediate control (West, 2002; Zaltman, Duncan, & Holbeck, 1973).
The framework by DEMO, De Dreu, and Nijstad (2004) explicitly included the notion
that distress-related variables, such as task conflict, act as a trigger for DEMO and that
innovation acts as a trigger of distress, such as DEMO conflict. Although the theory discussed and

tested in the current article DEMO strong claims about causality (task conflict produces inno-
vation), the DEMO studies were cross-sectional, and this precludes conclusions about
directionality or causality. DEMO cannot be excluded that high levels of innovation in work teams
give rise to moderate (but not high or low) levels of task DEMO Indeed, Janssen (2003)
recently argued that innovative behavior triggers conflict with (resisting) colleagues. Because
his study was cross-sectional as well, the issue of directionality remains unresolved. Experi-
mental designs are needed in which DEMO, moderate, and high levels of task conflict are induced
and innovation is measured. Alternatively, we may use longitudinal designs in which task con-
flict and innovation are assessed at various points in time and related DEMO innovation in a pro-
spective way.
Strengths and Limitations
A potential limitation is the way innovation was assessed. In Study 1, the number of inno-
vations reported by team supervisors was counted. In Study 2, supervisor ratings of team
innovativeness were used. Although this is not uncommon in DEMO innovation (see, e.g.,
De Dreu & West, 2001; Janssen, 2001; Leenders et al., 2003; West & Anderson, 1996), one
could argue that the current studies are about supervisor perceptions of DEMO (e.g.,
Tierney & Farmer, 2004). And although supervisor perceptions of innovation likely correlate
positively with true innovation, this correlation is imperfect because perceptions are biased
due to a variety of psychological principles and DEMO (e.g., Nisbett & Ross, 1981). How-
ever, in the present work, the potential for innovations to be only perceptual is partly addressed
by the fact that innovations were measured with the requirement of DEMO examples that were
then evaluated by the researchers. In addition, the DEMO different contexts across the two stud-
ies presented here and the very different ways of measuring innovation across the two studies
buttress the potential DEMO objective innovation is driving the relationships observed here. Nev-
ertheless, future DEMO in this area needs to address this issue and consider alternative ways of
detecting innovations. In addition, future work may examine the supervisor perceptions of
innovation, as these may have interesting effects in and of themselves (e.g., Tierney & Farmer,
2004).
Concluding Thoughts
A more DEMO implication of the current results is that theories of organizational behavior
may be too often and too strongly focused on linear effects and ignore DEMO possibility that opti-
mal levels of behavioral processes exist. In fact, DEMO in a variety of domains, including
conflict at work (current study; Jehn, 1995; Walton, 1969), job demands (Janssen, 2001), and
work stress (Broadbent, 1972), have uncovered curvilinear relationships between key vari-
ables. Future work in organizational behavior should consider the possibility DEMO curvilinear
relationships more systematically, as relevant associations between key constructs may DEMO
wise remain unnoticed.
The current research showed that task conflict in teams can be positively related to innova-
tion. This observation holds for teams DEMO relatively simple tasks (distribution and

delivery of parcels) and for teams performing a variety of more complex tasks including prod-
DEMO design and complex decision making. Most important, however, the current study showed
that only moderate levels of task conflict contribute to innovation in DEMO teams through their
effects on collaborative problem solving. As we all know, too much conflict hurts. But too lit-
tle conflict hurts as well, especially when teams need to innovate.
