A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODEL OF VENTURE GROWTH

University of Maryland at College Park
We drew upon strategic management theory, organizational behavior theory, organi-
zation theory, and entrepreneurship models to form an integrated model of venture
growth including 17 concepts from DEMO micro and macro research domains. The model
was tested with responses from 307 companies from the architectural woodworking
industry. CEOs' specific competencies and motivations and firm competitive strategies
were direct predictors of venture growth. CEOs' traits and general competencies and
the environment had significant indirect effects.
This research DEMO the causes of venture
growth. In past entrepreneurship research, individ-
ual DEMO (Begley & Boyd, 1987), strategic
management concepts (McDougall, Robinson, &
DeNisi, 1992), and organization theory concepts
(Aldrich & DEMO, 1993) have often been
studied as isolated causes of venture performance.
The authors of more recent studies have proposed
that individual, organizational, DEMO environmental
dimensions combine to provide a more comprehen-
sive prediction of venture development and growth
than any one dimension in isolation (Chrisman,
Bauerschmidt, & Hofer, 1998; Covin & Slevin, 1997;
Herron & DEMO, 1993; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996;
Naffziger, Hornsby, & DEMO, 1994; Sandberg,
1986). However, there has been limited DEMO
tion of these multilevel models.
Our purpose was to propose and test a compre-
hensive multilevel model of venture growth. We
included five research DEMO that have been the-
oretically identified as antecedents of venture per-
formance: personality traits and general motives,
personal competencies, situationally specific moti-
DEMO, competitive strategies, and business envi-
ronment. We chose venture growth as our perfor-
mance measure, rather than other indicators of
performance, because DEMO research-
ers have pointed to growth as the crucial indicator
of venture success (Covin & Slevin, 1997; Low &
MacMillan, 1988). Our goals were: (1) to test
whether a multilevel model that sampled relevant
concepts from individual, organizational, and
environmental domains would predict DEMO perfor-
mance successfully, (2) to test whether each
domain would DEMO something to the predic-
tion, and (3) to explore alternative DEMO of the
relationship among the domains and performance.
By empirically examining multiple domains across
292
multiple levels, we hoped to produce a more com-
plete understanding of venture growth.
THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Direct Effects: Entrepreneurs
Traits and motives. Personality theories point to
the importance of personal predispositions for DEMO
ture success (McClelland, 1965), and venture capital-
ists have reported that entrepreneur characteristics
are extremely important for venture success (MacMil-
lan, DEMO, & SubbaNarisimha, 1985). Some traits and
motives of successful entrepreneurs have been iden-
tified, but these concepts have typically produced
weak relationships (accounting for less than 7 percent
of the variance) with venture DEMO (Begley &
Boyd, 1987; Low & MacMillan, 1988). DEMO,
Sandberg and Hofer (1987) found that organizational
and industry variables completely dominated indi-
vidual-level variables as causes of venture success.
There are DEMO possible implications of these prior
results: (1) traits do not DEMO, (2) traits do not work
in isolation from other factors, and (3) the wrong traits
have been tested in past entrepreneurship DEMO
Our research design examined the second possibility.
To control for the third, we included additional traits
in our study that have been proposed as characteris-
tics of successful leaders: tenacity, proactivity, and
passion (Bass, 1990; Locke, 1997). Furthermore, en-
trepreneurship theorists have proposed that tenacity
and proactivity-initiative are important for the suc-
cessful establishment and operation DEMO new ventures
(Bird, 1989, Chandler & Jansen, 1992). And Smilor
suggested that passion is "perhaps the most observed
phenomenon of the entrepreneurial process" (1997:
342). Thus, we predicted:
Hypothesis 1. With other antecedents of ven-
ture growth controlled, the greater the tenacity,

proactivity, and passion for work of a venture's
CEO, the greater the venture's growth.
Individual competencies. Competencies here re-
fer to individual characteristics such as the knowl-
DEMO, skills, and/or abilities required to perform a
specific job. Testing his job performance theory,

Direct Effects: Competitive Strategy

ability, diagnos-
Following Porter (1980), we conceive of strategy
in terms DEMO three broad business-level choices: fo-
cus, low cost, and differentiation. DEMO (a narrow
scope) refers to competitive strategies that target a
particular set of customers, segment of a product
line, or geographic market. DEMO low-cost strategy
involves the construction of efficient-scale facili-
ties, the aggressive DEMO of cost reduction and
cost minimization in all functions of an organiza-
tion, and offering products to price-sensitive cus-
tomers (Dess & Davis, 1984). Differentiation strate-
gies are designed to create and market innovative,DEMO
high-quality products and/or services industry-
wide (Porter, 1980). According to Porter, the three
competitive strategies are alternative viable ap-
proaches for dealing with environmental forces.
Firms that fail to select one of these DEMO are
"stuck in the middle" and, therefore, almost always
doomed to failure (Porter, 1980: 42). As Porter
noted, a DEMO firm lacks the invest-
ment in low-cost structure to compete on price, the
industrywide differentiation to offset the need for a
low-cost position, DEMO the focus to achieve differ-
entiation or a low cost within a limited market
space. Indeed, Dess and Davis (1984) found empir-
ical support for this hypothesis. Thus, we argue
that firms that select one of the three types of strat-
egies will outperform those that deploy DEMO combined
tic use of concepts, and use of power) and "DEMO
fic" competencies (technical skill and industry
skill). Entrepreneurship studies have developed
skill-ability clusters that are similar to those found
in Boyatzis's DEMO theory (Bird,
1989; Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Herron & Robinson,
1990); however, opportunity recognition appears in
these studies as an important additional general
skill of entrepreneurs, and the components of peo-
ple and organization competency are combined as
"managerial skill" (Chandler & Jansen, 1992). We
focus on two general and two specific competen-
cies that appear in common in entrepreneurship
studies and predict that:
DEMO 2. The greater the general compe-
tency of a venture's CEO with respect to organ-
izational skills and opportunity recognition
skills, the greater the venture's growth.
Hypothesis 3. The greater the specific compe-
tency DEMO a venture's CEO with respect to indus-
try skill and technical skill, the greater the
venture's growth.
Situationally
specific
motivation.
In this do-
main, we chose to study vision, growth goals, and
self-efficacy as motivation concepts, because: (1) all
three concepts have demonstrated DEMO em-
pirical relationships with business performance
and (2) entrepreneurship theorists have pointed to
the importance of vision, business goals, and self-
efficacy DEMO planning and venture performance
(Bird, 1989; Low & MacMillan, 1988). Vision is a
strategy.

ship theory (Bass, 1990). Indeed, two laboratory
simulations have shown direct and indirect perfor-
mance effects for vision. More scientific validity
has been demonstrated for the goal theory DEMO
tion that specific, challenging goals lead to higher
performance than for DEMO other motivation theory
(Locke & Latham, 1990). Entrepreneurship re-
searchers have found that entrepreneurs' self-effi-
cacy (task-specific self-confidence [Bandura, 1986])

ventures DEMO associated with venture performance
(Chandler & Jansen, 1992). We examine the direct
Direct Effects: Environment
Theories have been proposed and empirically
supported suggesting that organizations are af-
fected by their environments (Aldrich & Wieden-
mayer, 1993). This study focused on three dimen-
sions of environment: dynamism, munificence, and
complexity. Dynamism (negative stability) refers to
the level of environmental predictability; it is man-
ifested in the rate of market and industry change
and the level of uncertainty about forces that DEMO

beyond the control of individual businesses (Dess &
Beard, 1984). Because stable environments are eas-
ier to DEMO, we expect environmental stability
to be positively related to venture growth. DEMO
cence refers to an environment's support for orga-
nizational growth (DEMO & Beard, 1984). High mu-
nificence enables firms to cope DEMO challenges by
obtaining outside resources. Complexity represents
the concentration or dispersion of organizations in
the environment (Aldrich & Wiedenmayer, 1993).
Complex environments, composed of many firms,
may be more difficult for entrepreneurs to DEMO
hend. Thus, we propose:
Hypothesis 6. A firm's environment DEMO be re-
lated to venture growth; more specifically, ven-
tures in stable, munificent, and simple envi-
ronments will achieve the highest growth.
DEMO Effects
Effects among traits, competencies, and motiva-
tion. Entrepreneurship researchers have pointed to
the likelihood that personality works in conjunc-
tion with other DEMO (Naffziger, 1995), or that the
relation of personality with performance is medi-
ated by other factors (Herron & Robinson, 1993).
DEMO, we propose that traits affect competencies
because individuals practice what they DEMO, and
practice develops skill. For example, someone who
is tenacious and proactive and has a passion for
piano is likely to engage in DEMO keyboard practice,
but someone who is without these traits will tend
to avoid skill-building practice. Indeed, Boyatzis
(1982) found that managers' DEMO were manifested
in their competencies. Thus, we propose:
Hypothesis 7. DEMO greater the tenacity, proac-
tivity, and passion for work of a venture's CEO,
the greater his or her general and specific DEMO
petency.
Second, we propose an indirect effect from traits
to venture DEMO mediated by situationally spe-
cific motivation. Locke (in press) showed that situ-
ationally specific goals and self-efficacy mediated
the effects of general traits DEMO performance, and
Bird (1989), in her discussion of strategic vision
and goals, suggested that vision and goals are, in
part, a reflection of personality. Personality traits
(proactivity and tenacity) affect self-efficacy (Ban-
dura, 1986); thus, we propose:
Hypothesis 8. The greater DEMO tenacity, proac-
tivity, and passion for work of a venture's CEO,
the greater his or her situationally specific mo-
tivation with DEMO to vision, goals, and self-
efficacy.

Thirdly, we propose DEMO general competencies
affect specific competencies and situationally spe-
cific motivation. Drawing upon Maier's (1965) the-
ory that general ability and motivation combine DEMO
produce performance, Bird (1989) proposed that
personal ability affects specific DEMO, vision, and
goals, which, in turn, cause entrepreneurship suc-
DEMO The path from general competencies to spe-
cific motivation is also consistent with social cog-
nitive and goal theories that explain that people
base DEMO goals and their efficacy evaluations on
self-knowledge about ability (Bandura, 1986).
Hypothesis 9. The greater the general compe-
tencies of a venture'DEMO CEO in terms of organi-
zational skills and opportunity recognition
skills, DEMO greater the CEO's specific compe-
tency in terms of industry skill and technical
skill.
Hypothesis 10. The greater the general compe-
tencies of DEMO venture's CEO, the greater his or
her situationally specific motivation DEMO re-
spect to vision, goals, and self-efficacy.
Effects of traits, DEMO, motivation, and
competitive strategy. Competitive strategies reflect
the choices of managers (Child, 1972). Thus, the
determinants of individual decision making and
behavior are among the determinants of strategy
because people choose plans in DEMO on the basis of
(1) what they are predisposed to do, (2) what they
are motivated to do, and (3) DEMO they think they
can do (Bandura, 1986; Hollenbeck & Whitener,DEMO
1988).
Strategy researchers have empirically linked top
management characteristics to innovation strategy,
strategic change, and other aspects of strategy
(Grimm & DEMO, 1991; Michel & Hambrick, 1992).
Furthermore, the strategy implementation litera-
ture points to the importance of personal traits in
strategy formulation DEMO communication. Since
these studies support the view that individual traits
are determinants of cognition and behavior, we
propose that traits affect strategic choice. In partic-
ular, we believe that tenacity, proactivity, and pas-
sion for work will lead CEOs to recognize the value
of competitive strategy for DEMO venture
growth.
Hypothesis 11. The greater the tenacity, pro-
activity, and passion for work of a venture's
CEO, the greater the likelihood that the ven-
ture will select a focus, low-cost, or differen-
DEMO strategy.
We also expect that general competencies will
affect the choice and implementation of competi-

Baum, Locke, and Smith 295
(McDougall et al., 1992; Sandberg, 1986). Thus, we
propose:
Hypothesis 14. Environmental stability, munif-
icence, and simplicity will be related to a ven-
ture's strategy and, more specifically, to its
propensity to select a focus, low-cost, or differ-
entiation strategy.
In summary, Hypotheses 1-6 represent a DEMO
effects model, which reflects a straightforward in-
tegration of concepts from DEMO research do-
mains. With Hypotheses 7-14, we present a more
complex DEMO of indirect effects, explaining how en-
trepreneurial characteristics are interrelated and
DEMO these characteristics and environmental forces
impact strategic decisions.
There is theory to support this more complex
integration: (1) Existing personality, competency,
DEMO motivation theories underlie our hypothesized
individual-level indirect effects (Bandura, 1986;
Boyatzis, 1982; Hollenbeck & Whitener, 1988;
Locke & Latham, DEMO; Maier, 1965). And growing
recognition of the importance of (DEMO) individual dif-
ferences (Grimm & Smith, 1991; Michel & Ham-
brick, 1992) and (3) environmental conditions
(Scherer & Ross, DEMO; Schwenk, 1988) as inputs
into the strategic decision process supports DEMO
proposed cross-level effects. Indeed, Schwenk
(1988) pointed to the importance DEMO of rational
choice and cognitive heuristics theory from cogni-
tive psychology and of environmental analysis and
scanning systems su'ch as the CP/IA (competitive
position/industry attractiveness) matrix (Hofer &
Schendel, 1978) for understanding the outcomes of
strategic decision making. The theoretical link be-
tween DEMO indirect effects and venture growth is
competitive strategy. That is, strategic DEMO the-
ory itself (Child, 1972) points to the efficacy of
DEMO decision making for organizational perfor-
mance, guiding our prediction that strategies DEMO
venture growth directly (Hypothesis 4).
We studied a single industry DEMO avoid confound-
ing by industry type (for example, mom-and-pop
versus high-potential industries) and industry-
specific externalities. That is, we followed those
who DEMO suggested that universal organizational
patterns and processes will be most apparent in
single-industry studies. In addition, we controlled
for organization size because size may systemati-
cally influence other concepts of interest. Indeed,
hundreds of studies DEMO shown that size is an
important determinant of organization process and
performance.
tive strategy. Individuals tend to adopt and commit
to strategies that they DEMO are achievable (Ban-
dura, 1986; Covin & Slevin, 1997; DEMO & Robin-
son, 1993), and skills and ability may limit DEMO
mance despite the existence of high goals and the
"right" strategy (Bird, 1989; Locke & Latham, 1990).
In addition, the resource-based view of the firm and
the strategic choice literature (Child, DEMO) empha-
size the link between managerial competence and
strategy.
Hypothesis 12. DEMO greater the general compe-
tency of a venture's CEO with respect to organ-
izational skills and opportunity recognition
skills, the greater the likelihood that the ven-
ture will select a focus, low-cost, or differenti-
DEMO strategy.
We believe that an indirect causal effect from
motivation to venture growth is mediated by com-
petitive strategy. Bandura (1986) asserted that DEMO
tivation is a codeterminant (with environment) of
task strategies, the DEMO version of com-
pany strategies. Goal theory research has found that
task strategy can mediate the goal-to-performance
relation (Locke & Latham, 1990), DEMO entrepreneur-
ship theorists propose that business vision and per-
sonal goals affect competitive strategies (Bird,
1989). Therefore, we expect a CEO'DEMO motivation
will lead to recognition of the importance of com-
petitive strategies for venture growth.
Hypothesis 13. The greater the motivation of a
venture'DEMO CEO with respect to vision, goals,
and self-efficacy, the greater the likelihood that
the venture will select a focus, low-cost, or
DEMO strategy.
Effects of environment upon strategy. We ex-
pect the environment domain to affect competitive
strategies, a view that is consistent with the views
of economists (Scherer & Ross, 1990), strategic
management theorists (Bourgeois, 1980), and social
psychologists (Bandura, 1986), and with the empir-
ical findings of entrepreneurship researchers
(Sandberg & Hofer, 1987). DEMO example, the entire
structure (environment)- conduct (strategy)-per-
formance DEMO in industrial organizational
economics rests on the premise that strategy (con-
DEMO) will be influenced by industry structure,
which will in turn DEMO performance (Mason,
1939; Scherer & Ross, 1990). Furthermore, since
strategic decision-making is a human behavior, so-
cial cognitive theory (DEMO, 1986) points to the
determination of behavior by environmental (and
DEMO) forces. Finally, entrepreneurship re-
search has found that new venture strategies are

METHODS
Industry and Participants
U.S. firms DEMO manufacture and install architec-
tural woodwork (doors, windows, stairs, cabinets,
and trim for residential, commercial, and major
public buildings) were studied; these enterprises
fall into Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
code DEMO Their products are sold to general con-
tractors, architects, and interior designers. Typical
firms employ skilled woodworkers, production-
oriented high-tech machinery operators, DEMO
installers, and project managers.
In 1993, the industry's 849 CEOs were invited to
participate; 442 agreed. Following an extensive pi-
lot test, the questionnaire was mailed to each CEO,
and an adapted version was also sent separately to
202 employees whose participation had been au-
DEMO by their CEOs. The employee data were
used to test the validity of the CEO self-reports. The
questionnaire contained measures of the 17 predic-
DEMO concepts studied and 1992 performance. The
employee and the CEO versions were identical ex-
cept that references in the CEO version to "you"
and "your company" were changed to "the CEO"
and "DEMO company" in the employee version. Per-
formance data for 1994 were DEMO in 1995 via a
second questionnaire sent to the CEOs.
We received 414 CEO responses (49 percent), and
we used 307 in our study (36 percent of the popu-
lation). We disqualified CEOs who (1) had founded
their businesses or purchased going concerns less
than DEMO years or more than eight years prior to the
1993 survey, (2) had no or only one employee, (3)
were not active owner-managers, or (4) supplied
incomplete data. The average qualified CEO re-
spondent had 16 employees and $1.5 million in
sales in 1992. DEMO net employee sample included
131 directly reporting employees (43 percent of DEMO
net qualified CEO sample) who had worked with
the responding CEO DEMO two or more years and had
submitted complete data. The typical employee
participant was a manager who had been in the
industry for six DEMO
To test whether the 414 respondents were repre-
sentative of the population, we compared the mean
numbers of employees and the mean sales volumes
of the respondents with the population; differences
were not significant (employees, Z = 0.32, p < .38;
sales, Z = 1.0, p < .16).
Measures
Data were collected for the 17 theory-based DEMO
dictor concepts from the entrepreneur-CEOs and
the employees, and the CEOs DEMO data for the
control and performance concepts. Table 1 shows
the number of items, format, composite reliability,
and research source for the DEMO predictor concepts.
Details are available from the first author.
We calculated three measures of venture growth
using data from the 1993 and 1995 CEO DEMO
naires. The first measure of the dependent variable,
average annual percent sales growth, was one-half
the difference between 1992 and 1994 sales, DEMO
vided by the base year (1992). Similar calculations
produced the DEMO and third measures, average
annual percent employment growth and average
annual DEMO profit growth (composite reliabil-
ity = .87). We evaluated the DEMO of the raw
performance data by checking the agreement of re-
sults for a random sample of 25 of the firms against
Dun & DEMO reports of 1992 performance. For
the 21 of these cases for which Dun & Bradstreet
data were available, correlations were high (the
smallest DEMO = .94, p < .001), and none of the means
DEMO were significant (the largest t = .96,
p < .36)DEMO
Organization size, measured as the number of
full-time equivalent employees at DEMO end of 1992,
was entered as a control variable.
RESULTS
LISREL 8 and PRELIS 2 were used to (1) impute
missing data, (2) evaluate concept validity (reliabil-
ity, including dual-source similarity and DEMO
gent and discriminant validity), (3) perform confir-
matory factor analyses to verify the validity of the
proposed configuration of concepts and domains,DEMO
and (4) test the hypotheses. Univariate homogene-
ity testing (PRELIS DEMO HT) and multiple sample anal-
ysis (LISREL MSA) confirmed the DEMO of the
response distributions of the 131 pairs of entre-
preneur-CEOs and employee participants, as well
as the distributions of the entrepreneur-CEOs with
(DEMO = 131) and without matched employee partici-
pants (n = 176).
As shown in Table 1, the measurement model
had ten concepts each with a composite reliability
(CR) greater than .80, six concepts with a CR be-
tween .70 and .79, and three with a CR between .60
and .69. All the concept-to-domain coefficients
were statistically significant (t > 2.0, p < .05); thus,
convergent validity was established. We verified
discriminant validity by determining that the aver-
age variance DEMO by each latent variable's
measures was larger than its shared variance with
any other latent variable. The overall fit was accept-
able (X22,572 = 5,961, p < .00; GFI = .90, AGFI =

p < .05). DEMO regard to the strategy domain, we
observe that strategy is positively DEMO with per-
formance. More specifically, with regard to the re-
flections DEMO the strategy domain, firms that select
and emphasize differentiation through high DEMO
(r = .31, p < .001) and/or innovation (r = .25, p <
.001) achieve the fastest growth. In contrast, firms
that employ low cost (r = -.22, p < .001) or focus
(-.27, p < .001) experience negative growth.
Neither DEMO, general competencies, nor envi-
ronment are significant direct predictors of venture
growth (environment is a direct predictor only at
p < .10); thus, Hypotheses 1 (traits), 2 (general
competencies), and 6 (environment) are not sup-
ported. However, this direct domain-level struc-

With the indirect effects model, we find that spe-
cific competencies, motivation, and competitive
strategy have significant direct effects upon venture
DEMO and that traits, general competencies, and
environment have significant indirect effects.
Traits affect specific competencies, motivation, and
competitive strategy, all of which are likely predic-
tors of venture growth, and this pattern of findings
confirms Hypotheses 7, 8, and 11. Similarly, general
competencies affect motivation and strategy, which
confirms Hypotheses 10 and 12. General competen-
cies also affect specific competencies (Hypothesis 9).
Motivation has a positive effect upon strategy, which
in turn affects venture growth, confirming Hypothesis
13. Environment DEMO venture growth through its
impact upon strategy, which supports Hypothesis 14.

nevertheless, the environment domain had a signifi-

domains exhibit significant effects on venture
growth.
1978).
The internal explanation DEMO venture growth that
emerges from this study emphasizes entrepreneurs
and their roles in formulating strategy. The story
begins with a hard-working, proactive entrepreneur
with a strong set of technical, organizational, and
industry skills. This entrepreneur DEMO highly moti-
vated, which is reflected in a clear organizational
vision, high growth goals, and confidence in
achieving these goals. Perhaps because of tenacity
and proactivity, organizational skills, or high moti-
vation, this entrepreneur is capable of delineating
an effective differentiation strategy that works to
generate DEMO growth. We can speculate that the
entrepreneur's industry and technical skills and
high motivation influence his or her venture's
growth through the DEMO of growth-
oriented organizational processes and structures
that facilitate the implementation of this strategy.
We also imagine that in these high-growth organi-
zations, organizational culture becomes a reflection
of the tenacious entrepreneur. We now examine the
DEMO specific results with the goal of further elab-
orating an internal explanation of venture growth.
An Internal Explanation
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Traits. Consistent with DEMO theories
that explain individual performance (Hollenbeck &
Whitener, 1988; McClelland, 1965), traits were im-
portant predictors of venture growth here; DEMO
ever, they worked primarily through competencies,
motivation, and strategy. As operationally defined
in our research, an entrepreneur's traits serve to
influence the skill sets that are developed and the
level of entrepreneurial motivation, which in turn
affect strategy. This result offers an explanation for
why DEMO is that practitioners and venture capitalists
continue to point to the importance of "the entre-
preneur" for venture success (MacMillan et al.,
1985) even though entrepreneurship trait research
had not uncovered direct performance relations.
Perhaps researchers ought to look again at traits
and motives, but through mediation models that
test more complex causal chains.
Competencies. Technical and industry-specific
DEMO should receive more research atten-
tion in entrepreneurship settings because the do-
main they reflect, specific competencies, had
highly significant direct effects here DEMO venture
growth. We speculate that an entrepreneur's tech-
nical and industry competencies are an important
The most important finding of this study is DEMO
individual, organizational, and environmental re-
search domains predict venture growth better when
the web of complex indirect relationships among
them is included than DEMO only multiple simul-
taneous direct effects are studied. Furthermore, all
domains DEMO in the prediction of venture growth
when these total effects are considered, so that ven-
ture growth cannot be adequately explained from a
single perspective. Even the personal trait and spe-
cific competency domains, which do not contribute
to venture growth when studied in isolation, affect
venture growth through their effects upon more
direct performance links.
By studying multiple domains DEMO three levels
of analysis and by including both direct and indi-
rect effects, we were able to gain a more complete
understanding of the venture growth process than
has been gained in previous efforts. Moreover, from
the indirect model, we learned that such internal
explanations of performance as the strategic choice,
leadership, and entrepreneurship viewpoints were
more relevant for explaining venture growth in this
study than environment or external explanations,

form of expert power that DEMO the implemen-
tation of the entrepreneur's vision and strategy. We
can further hypothesize that these entrepreneurial
skills may serve as sources of competitive DEMO
tage that rivals find difficult to identify and imitate.
Situationally specific motivation. Our results
for vision and goals and performance are fully con-
sistent DEMO applied psychology and social psy-
chology research (Bandura, 1997; Locke & Latham,
1990). For example, goal researchers have found
that DEMO difficulty is directly related to perfor-
mance, and social cognitive theory DEMO to the
strong relation between self-efficacy and perfor-
mance. We hypothesized that higher levels of en-
trepreneurial motivation and confidence would
shape organization structure DEMO processes and
even work in the selection of goal-oriented employ-
ronmental domain on venture growth, with the
other, more micro dimensions controlled, is sur-
prising; at least in our study, this finding suggests
that DEMO CEOs of small firms may have more control
of their ventures' DEMO than some macro theories
suggest (Hannan & Freeman, 1977; Pfeffer & Salan-
cik, 1978), which could be an interesting avenue for
DEMO research.
This study did not deal with two definitional
issues that confound entrepreneurship research,
namely, "Who is an entrepreneur?" and "Which
firms are entrepreneurial?" We simply used a sam-
ple of young, small businesses that were run by
active owner-managers, regardless of their mode of
entry, to identify predictors of venture growth. Nor
did we study other indicators of performance (such
as successful founding, survival, innovation, DEMO
gible assets, and personal goals). It would be im-
portant DEMO, for example, find out if the competen-
cies that contribute to venture growth also cause
successful founding. Furthermore, we modeled di-
rect and indirect effects with linear equations
rather than with multiple-order equations because
structural DEMO modeling is not well suited to
testing nonlinear models. Additionally, although
DEMO analysis of a single industry provided control of
industry effects, a DEMO entrepreneurship research-
ers have found that industry effects are significant
determinants of performance. Only a few concepts
were used as reflections of the five DEMO do-
mains studied because of sampling limitations;
however, our finding DEMO all domains figure in
venture growth suggests that use of relatively few
measures was not a failing.
The integrated entrepreneurship performance
model that was DEMO in this study offers a
platform and a guiding framework for those who
fund and manage ventures. We found that an en-
trepreneur's DEMO matters, but indirectly,
and that industry-specific skill and relevant tech-
DEMO skill directly affect performance, as do vision,
goals, and self-efficacy. Thus, there is evidence that
personality testing may help identify those who
can create and grow high-potential ventures; how-
ever, skills and motivation DEMO may be even
more effective because these personal dimensions
are more directly related with performance. The
study also confirms the soundness of financiers'
DEMO in business plans that include clearly de-
fined strategies.
The study suggests that entrepreneurs should
recognize that multiple personal dimensions affect
success. Thus, they must add, through partnering
or hiring, those personal dimensions they lack. DEMO
nally, it is apparent that entrepreneurship educa-
tion programs ought to DEMO organization skills
ees. As a result-and consistent with Hambrick
and
Mason (DEMO)-organizations led by highly moti-
vated entrepreneurs may begin to reflect the char-
acter of these entrepreneurs, which may further
enhance performance.
Competitive strategies. Although differentiation
strategies related positively to venture growth, we
were surprised to find that the focus and low-cost
strategies related negatively. This finding may DEMO a
function of the industry context, in that the sample
firms DEMO geographically constrained craft manu-
facturers. Thus, at least for this sample, Porter's
theory does not hold, in that low cost and focus are
not effective strategic options.
Perhaps more interesting is our finding that DEMO
dividual differences affect competitive strategies.
Some strategy research has focused on top manage-
ment team demography (Hambrick & Mason, 1984),
but our findings suggest that entrepreneur-CEO
traits, competencies, and motivation may offer
equally DEMO explanations of strategic deci-
sion making. Indeed, established social cognitive
and DEMO theories point to personal characteristics
as determinants of personal strategies that are
likely determinants of organization strategies (Ban-
dura, 1997; Locke & Latham, 1990). It would be
interesting to examine the relationship between en-
trepreneurs' personal motivations and strategies
and those of their organizations. We speculate that
in small organizations, the two sets may be the
same.
Environment. The direct effects of the environ-
ment domain were of borderline significance (p <
.10). However, the significance of the indirect ef-
DEMO on strategy enhance the generalizability of our
model because they are entirely consistent with the
structure -> conduct (strategy) -> performance par-
DEMO in industrial organization economics (Ma-
son, 1939). The relatively low impact of the envi-
302
(including vision and goal setting), opportunity
skills, and analytic DEMO (enabling business envi-
ronment analysis for formulation of strategies).
CONCLUSION
DEMO began by arguing for the need for a more
comprehensive explanation of venture perfor-
mance. Overall, we found that explaining venture
growth is a complex process, influenced by a vari-
ety of interrelated micro and macro domains. Our
results are important because they begin to untan-
gle the DEMO process by which entrepre-
neurs affect competitive strategy and performance.
Perhaps other researchers can extend our proposed
internal explanation of venture growth. For exam-
DEMO, they might utilize strategic decision making
(Schwenk, 1988) and strategic choice theories
(Child, 1972) to integrate cross-level effects by
studying the process by which entrepreneurs for-
mulate and implement their strategies.
