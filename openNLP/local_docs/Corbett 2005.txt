The article uses experiential learning theory to magnify the importance of learning within
the process of DEMO Previous research details the contributions of prior knowl-
edge, creativity, and cognitive mechanisms to the process of opportunity identiﬁcation and
exploitation; however, DEMO literature is devoid of work that directly addresses learning. The
extant research assumes learning is occurring but does not directly address the importance
of DEMO to the process. To fully understand the nature of the entrepreneurial process,
researchers must take into account how individuals learn and how different DEMO of learn-
ing inﬂuence opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation. This article makes connections
between knowledge, cognition, and creativity to develop the concept of learning DEMO
tries and illustrates how a greater appreciation for the differences in individual learning will
fortify entrepreneurship research.
Introduction
Eckhardt and Shane (2003) argue DEMO studying the process of entrepreneurship is one
of the most important directions for future entrepreneurship research. Additionally, oppor-
tunity is seen as the lynchpin around which the promise of entrepreneurship research is
to be built (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). In fact, it has been suggested that DEMO better
understanding of how individuals identify and exploit opportunities may provide the ﬁeld
with a distinct domain that separates it from strategic management, economics, and other
social science disciplines (Venkataraman, 1997). In this article, I examine experiential
learning within the context of opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation to better under-
stand the process of entrepreneurship.
Shane and Venkataraman tell DEMO that individuals must possess prior knowledge and
the cognitive properties necessary to value such knowledge in order to identify new
means–ends relationships. The warm DEMO that the work of Shane and Venkatara-
man has received has helped generate a great deal of interest in examining the entrepre-

neurship process from a cognitive perspective (Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, DEMO;
Brigham & DeCastro, 2003; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Keh, Foo, & Lim, 2002; Krueger,
2000; McCline, Bhat, & Baj, 2000). Together with the work of other leading “cognitive
perspective” researchers (see the works of scholars such as Baron, Busenitz, Mitchell,
and Gaglio), Shane and Venkataraman’s article published in the DEMO of Management
Review in 2000 helped carve out a fruitful line of inquiry examining the concomitance
of an individual’s cognitive properties and his ability DEMO identify, develop, and exploit
opportunities.
The cognitive body of research contributes to our understanding of entrepreneurship
by helping to explain how each individual’s DEMO makeup is related to his or her ability
to identify and exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity. The extant research suggests that
recognition abilities differ because DEMO of us has different pieces of the world’s totality
of information (DEMO, 1945), and we each rely on different cognitive mechanisms or
DEMO (Baron, 1998; Busenitz & Barney, 1997). Related research supports the hypoth-
esis that creativity, cognition, and opportunity identiﬁcation process are DEMO
(Lumpkin, Hills, & Shrader, 2004; Ward, 2004). Taken together, this research provides
an understanding of what attributes (prior knowledge, cognitive mechanisms, heuristics,
or creative abilities) a budding entrepreneur needs DEMO have; however, it speaks less to the
process of acquiring such attributes (i.e., learning). Research suggests that differences in
our knowledge DEMO and the various manners in which each might process information
are related to opportunity identiﬁcation (Shane, 2000). However, what about the manner
in which we each learn—the acquisition of new information? A search of the primary
management and entrepreneurship journals shows no work that directly addresses DEMO role
that the process of learning plays in opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation.
The cognitive perspective on entrepreneurship is valuable and has helped us under-
DEMO a great deal about how individuals identify and exploit opportunities. However, DEMO
needs to be fortiﬁed by investigations of the process of learning. Cognitive mechanisms
and heuristics (e.g., overconﬁdence, counterfactual thinking, representation, small
numbers) and an individual’s existing stocks of knowledge are not synonymous with
learning. Knowledge is a static concept that is activated when we put it DEMO use. Cogni-
tive mechanisms and heuristics are two ways in which we put our knowledge into action.
In contrast, learning is a social process by which knowledge is created through the trans-
formation of experience (Kolb, 1984). This article proposes that to better understand
opportunity identiﬁcation, DEMO, and the entrepreneurship process in general,
current research must be DEMO by a more ﬁne-grained examination of learning.
Previous models (Long & DEMO, 1984; Teach, Swartz, & Tarpley, 1989;
Timmons, Muzyka, Stevenson, & Bygrave, 1987) that attempted to deﬁne different
aspects DEMO the entrepreneurial process were developed before the “re-birth” of opportu-
nity research that was sparked by Venkataraman (1997). None of these earlier discus-
sions nor more current articles on the opportunity process (Ardichvili et al., 2003;
Brigham & DeCastro, 2003; Keh et al., 2002; McCline et al., 2000) examine the effects
of learning.
This article DEMO on experiential learning to ﬁll the void. Experiential learning theory
(ELT) tells us that the acquisition and transformation experience is central to the DEMO
ing process (Kolb, 1984). ELT is an integrative perspective that combines the constructs
of previous knowledge, perception, cognition, and experience (DEMO, 1984). As such, it
provides us the opportunity to uncover why some individuals acquire and transform infor-
mation in different manners, how they combine it with existing knowledge stocks, and
why these behaviors result in different opportunity recognition and exploitation abilities.
By mapping the learning modes DEMO ELT onto the process of recognition and exploitation,
474
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
we begin to better understand linkages between attributes, process, and entrepreneurial
DEMO
When brought to bear on the opportunity recognition process, ELT can DEMO some
clariﬁcation as to why entrepreneurs develop certain cognitive behaviors and knowledge
structures that have such a positive impact on their ability to recognize DEMO This
article explains that part of the variance in behavior and knowledge that affects the oppor-
tunity identiﬁcation and exploitation process is based on DEMO existence of learning asym-
metries—i.e., individuals acquire and transform their experiences (learn) in different
ways. By providing this connection, this article will: (1) enhance the richness of schol-
arly conversation by enabling a DEMO understanding of the nuances between learn-
ing, cognition, and knowledge; (2) provide a more detailed understanding of the process
of opportunity recognition and exploitation; and (3) facilitate entrepreneurship empirics
by developing speciﬁc, DEMO hypotheses regarding learning effects and opportunity
recognition.
The article proceeds by ﬁrst providing a review of the pertinent opportunity identi-
ﬁcation work on cognition, knowledge, and creativity. This is followed by a detailed
explanation of ELT that shows how this perspective can inform and further extend the
body DEMO research on entrepreneurial process and opportunity identiﬁcation and exploita-
tion. Testable propositions based upon experiential learning and the process of opportu-
nity identiﬁcation and DEMO are then provided. Finally, the implications of an
experiential learning perspective DEMO entrepreneurship research and practice are discussed.
Opportunity—Knowledge, Cognition, and Creativity
So, why do some people recognize opportunities while others do not? Why DEMO indi-
viduals recognize different opportunities from the same stimuli (Shane, 2000)? Current
theoretical conjecture and empirical investigations suggest that the answer to DEMO ques-
tion may be found by examining three broad concepts: knowledge, cognition, and cre-
ativity. The extant literature suggest that differences between individuals’ stocks of
knowledge (Ardichvili et al., 2003; Shane, 2000) and their behavior are based upon their
cognitive processing (Baron, 1998), DEMO that these constructs are contributing factors as
to why some people recognize opportunities while others do not. Additionally, a bur-
geoning stream of literature is examining the links between creativity, cognition, oppor-
tunity, and entrepreneurship (Hills, Shrader, & Lumpkin, 1999; Lumpkin, Hills, &
DEMO, 2004; Ward, 2004). An overview of the contributions of DEMO of these streams
is provided below. Then, based upon this foundation, I provide an argument for an inves-
tigation of opportunity recognition from DEMO experiential learning perspective.
Knowledge, Opportunity, and Entrepreneurship
While advocating for the importance of individuals within the evolution of economic
markets, Hayek (1945) stated that knowledge is not given to anyone in totality. Hayek
asserted DEMO the “economic problem” was not one of allocating resources but instead
is a problem of dispersion of knowledge and utilization of information. His assertion
DEMO provided the basis for entrepreneurship scholars (Ardichvili et al., 2003; DEMO &
Shane, 2003; Shane, 2000; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Venkataraman, 1997) to inves-
tigate differences in knowledge as a cornerstone of their theoretical discussions of oppor-
tunity and the process of entrepreneurship.
DEMO, 2005
475
Ardichvili et al. (2003) developed four speciﬁc propositions positing a relationship
DEMO knowledge and opportunity recognition. These authors theorize that individuals
who have certain types of existing knowledge have a better likelihood of recognizing
opportunities than DEMO who do not have such knowledge. Speciﬁcally, Ardichvili et al.
propose DEMO: (1) special interest knowledge and general industry knowledge; (2) prior
knowledge of markets; (3) prior knowledge of customer problems; DEMO (4) prior knowl-
edge of ways to serve markets will all increase the likelihood of successful entrepre-
neurial opportunity recognition.
Shane’s (2000) DEMO investigation of the discovery of entrepreneurial opportu-
nities examined the last three propositions put forth by Ardichvili and his colleagues. By
investigating a newly DEMO process that was exploited by a number of individuals
each with different “stocks of prior knowledge,” Shane provides evidence for Ardichvili
et al. DEMO Essentially, Shane showed that when presented with the same tech-
nological DEMO, different individuals will recognize different opportunities due
to their prior knowledge.
DEMO, in the form of experience, has also been investigated as a primary factor
in one’s ability to identify opportunity. In a study of DEMO 100 founders, Vesper (1980)
noted that of these individuals cited serendipity as the main reason that they found the
opportunity that eventually DEMO their business. However, Vesper went on to show that
work experience DEMO the true factor in why these founders recognized business oppor-
tunities. Gilad, Kaish, and Ronen (1988) supported Vesper’s ﬁndings and stated that DEMO
rience is a signiﬁcant factor that allows individuals to recognize potentially successful
ventures. Ronstadt (1988) developed this work further and from his ﬁndings DEMO
the concept of the “corridor principle”—the fact that experience and knowledge gained
from starting one business allows an individual to see opportunities for other DEMO
in a similar arena.
In summary, the literature on knowledge and DEMO provides us with evidence
that knowledge asymmetries are important distinguishing factors with regard to who
recognizes what opportunities and who does not. However, we are not “given” the
knowledge to identify opportunities.
Venkataraman (1997) states DEMO individuals must shape the information they are
“given” to discover opportunities because opportunities are rarely presented in prepack-
aged form. He suggests that investigations DEMO opportunity should revolve around the infor-
mation individuals possess and how they process it. Shane and Venkataraman (2000)
reafﬁrm this position by stating that the reason some people will discover opportunities
while others may not DEMO on two issues: “(1) the possession of the prior information
necessary to identify an opportunity and (2) the cognitive properties necessary DEMO value
it” (2000, p. 222). Essentially, while we all DEMO different pieces of information
(Hayek, 1945), we also all reason with it differently.
Cognition, Opportunity, and Entrepreneurship
Taking this cue, Baron (1998) states that entrepreneurs are more likely than nonen-
trepreneurs to DEMO and reason using various cognitive heuristics and biases (self-serving
bias, counterfactual thinking, etc.) due to the conditions that entrepreneurs are likely to
DEMO (high uncertainty, novelty, time pressure, and stress). Krueger (DEMO) argues
that opportunities emerge based on the intentions of the individual DEMO that intentions
are derived from how people think. In summarizing the explosion of recent research on
cognition and entrepreneurship, Mitchell, Busenitz, Lant, DEMO, Morse, and
476
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Smith (2002) concur and propose a theory of entrepreneurial cognition that DEMO that
the mental processes that occur within the individual have a relationship with the process
of entrepreneurship.
Mitchell, Busenitz, Lant, McDougall, Morse, and Smith (2002) explain that cogni-
tive psychology explores mental processes DEMO how these processes evolve and change
as an individual interacts with other people and the environment. Putting these concepts
in the context of entrepreneurship, their theory states that “entrepreneurial cognitions are
the knowledge structures that people DEMO to make assessments, judgments, or decisions
involving opportunity evaluation, venture DEMO, and growth” (2002, p. 97).
Empirical studies support the DEMO of entrepreneurial cognition. Busenitz and
Barney (1997) demonstrated that in contrast to managers, entrepreneurs use heuristics
(mental shortcuts) and biases in their decision making. The authors suggested that these
shortcuts in the cognitive processes DEMO entrepreneurs were important in allowing entre-
preneurs to seize opportunity. Mitchell, DEMO, Seawright, and Morse (2000) demonstrate
that entrepreneurial cognitive scripts are consistent across cultures. Corbett (2002)
explored the concept of cognitive style and found that the more an individual’s cognitive
processing style tended toward DEMO and away from “analytical,” the more oppor-
tunities an individual would identify. Brigham and DeCastro (2003) also examined cog-
nitive style and DEMO how an individual’s cognitive makeup ﬁts with his or her
venture over time. They found that while an individual’s cognitive style may work well
DEMO the initial identiﬁcation of an opportunity, the entrepreneur may experience
burnout DEMO misﬁt as the venture matures and goes through exploitation phase. Keh et al.
(2002) argue that cognitive biases have a direct impact on DEMO entrepreneurs evaluate
opportunities. Their study suggests that entrepreneurs tend to rely on potentially ﬂawed
small samples (law of small numbers) and an ill-place DEMO in their abilities (illu-
sion of control) when evaluating opportunities.
Knowledge, Cognition, and Creativity
Assimilating much of the above research in knowledge DEMO cognition, Ward (2004)
explores different cognitive approaches to creativity with the intent of developing op-
portunities for new businesses. Ward details different DEMO cognitive
approaches—including, conceptual combination, analogical reasoning, abstraction, and
problem formulation—to show how novel ideas can emerge. By making the connection
between knowledge DEMO cognition, Ward not only demonstrates their importance to
opportunity recognition, but by adding the concept of creativity, he also reveals their
insufﬁciency. Ward explains that all knowledge are not created equal and that depending
on DEMO knowledge is processed and used (cognition), knowledge will either provide DEMO
bridge to a new opportunity (creativity) or construct a fence that will block its path.
Lumpkin et al. (2004) argue that knocking DEMO fences and building bridges toward
new opportunities is dependent upon one’s creativity. These authors argue for a creativ-
ity-based approach to opportunity recognition and DEMO a ﬁve-stage model that details
how a creativity perspective can inform the opportunity recognition process. The
Lumpkin et al. model is replicated in Figure DEMO
Their creativity-based model of opportunity recognition is based upon Csikszentmi-
halyi’s (DEMO) basic elements of creativity—preparation, incubation, insight, evaluation,
and elaboration. Corresponding to Shane and Venkataraman’s (2000) primary compo-
nents of opportunity DEMO, Lumpkin et al. dissect their model into discovery and
formation phases. DEMO discovery phase includes preparation, incubation, and insight,

while the formation phase includes evaluation and DEMO As noted by the arrows,
the model was built to represent an ongoing recursive process.
Knowledge, experience, and cognitive actions play primary DEMO during the discov-
ery phase of this model. Lumpkin et al. explain that during preparation, individuals rely
on their prior knowledge (Shane, 2000) but that this preparation process is neither planned
nor intentional. Individuals may not know yet that they are going to start a venture so
DEMO preparation may in fact just be activities associated with their “normal” daily rou-
tines. During incubation, individuals cognitively process thoughts subconsciously
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1996) while they are thinking about an idea or working to solve a
problem. During insight, the individual has a breakthrough, “Aha!” moment. At DEMO time,
a cognitive shift takes place as the individual begins to consciously realize that he may
have identiﬁed an opportunity to break an DEMO means—end relationship (Gaglio &
Katz, 2001; Shane, 2000).
DEMO et al.’s formation phase includes the last two steps of the model, evalua-
tion and elaboration. In evaluation, would-be entrepreneurs test the opportunity DEMO
regard to market acceptability, ﬁnancial returns, and resource availability. During evalu-
ation, entrepreneurs talk to many individuals in their network and try to assess whether
the concept is worth pursuing. Lumpkin et al. state that DEMO elaboration, the creative
insight is actually realized. It is at this DEMO that true formal business planning may begin
or the venture may be launched. Bhave (1994) reports that opportunity may be formally
converted into DEMO venture even though the details are not yet ﬁnalized; the organization
DEMO evolve and formalize over time.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
A Learning Perspective
Baron (2004) states that everything we say, think, and do are affected by how we
acquire, store, transform, DEMO use information. He argues that the manner in which indi-
viduals differ with respect to these mental processes may affect entrepreneurial abilities.
As shown DEMO, the opportunity identiﬁcation literature is replete with discussions of
experience, creativity, knowledge, and cognition; and these works address how we “store,
and use information” to pursue opportunities. There is little about how we DEMO
information and nothing directly addresses how we acquire information, i.e., learn.
Lumpkin, Hills, and Shrader build a recursive model that implies learning DEMO the
evaluation step but their focus is on the importance of creativity. To date, no one has
directly addressed Hamel and Prahalad’s (1996) question regarding the role that learning
plays in ﬁnding and exploiting new DEMO Using ELT, the current study augments
the extant body of research DEMO directly addressing how individuals acquire and transform
information within the process of opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation.
Experiential Learning Theory and Entrepreneurship
Experiential Learning Theory
DEMO (1984) deﬁnes experiential learning as a process by which knowledge is created
through the transformation of experience. Figure 2 is a representation of DEMO model
of experiential learning and shows that individuals learn through experience, DEMO,
thought, and experimentation (the outside loop). This cycle involves four learning
modes—concrete experience, reﬂective observation, abstract conceptualization, and
active experimentation. The inner poles refer to how one acquires and transforms infor-
mation (on the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively) feeding into the process DEMO the
outer ring.
Kolb’s concept of prehension, as reﬂected on the DEMO pole in Figure 2, refers to
the two different ways in DEMO an individual can acquire information in the world—
either through direct experience or through a recreation of experiences. Apprehension is
a reliance on the DEMO, felt qualities of immediate experience. Comprehension refers
to a reliance on DEMO interpretation and symbolic representation. Kolb (1984) uses
the example of what you are doing right now—reading—to illustrate the differences in
these two concepts.
DEMO you put down this book, get up from the chair, and leave the room, your appre-
hensions of that situation will vanish without a trace (substituted for, of course, by
new apprehensions of the hallway or whatever new immediate situation you are in).
Your comprehension DEMO that situation, however, will allow you to create for yourself
and communicate to others a model of that situation that could last forever. DEMO,
to the extent that the model was accurately constructed from your apprehensions, it
allows you to predict and recreate those apprehensions. (1984, p. 43)
Similarly, Kolb explains that the dimensions of transformation of experience that are
expressed on the horizontal axis in Figure 2 are DEMO opposed. Some people tend
to transform via extension, which means that DEMO learn through actively testing their
ideas and experiences in the real world. Others transform via intention where they inter-
nally reﬂect upon the different DEMO of their experiences and ideas.
Taken together, Kolb shows that these DEMO dimensions of grasping and transforming
information result in four ways of learning and creating knowledge. When an individual

grasps experience through apprehension and transforms through intention, he or she
creates divergent knowledge. Experience grasped through comprehension and trans-
formed through DEMO creates assimilative knowledge. When an individual grasps
through comprehension and transforms through extension, he or she creates convergent
knowledge. Lastly, when one grasps DEMO through apprehension and transforms it
through extension, accommodative knowledge results.
Kolb DEMO others (Kolb, Boyatzis, & Mainemelis, 2000; Mainemelis, Boyatzis, &
Kolb, 2002) state that individuals learn best when they can DEMO through all four forms
of learning as represented by the outside curved arrows in Figure 2. Kolb also, however,
provides typology of learning styles—the converger, diverger, assimilator, and accom-
modator—and suggests that individuals have a preference for one over the others. The
assimilator grasps experience by DEMO and theorizing and transforms it by watching
and reﬂecting. The converger grasps by thinking and theorizing and transforms via doing
and applying. The diverger DEMO by feeling and doing and transforms by watching and
reﬂecting. The accommodator grasps experience by feeling and doing and then trans-
forms via doing DEMO applying.
It should be reiterated that these learning modes are relatively ﬁxed states. Individ-
uals may acquire and transform information in all manners, but each of us tends to rely

on one mode over the others. Kolb states, “Through their choices of experiences, people
program DEMO to grasp reality through varying degrees of emphasis on apprehen-
sion or comprehension” (1984, p. 64). Each individual also has a preference DEMO trans-
formation. Jung (1977) states that we all tend to have a preference for different learning
mechanisms and that the complex interactions of DEMO minds and the chaos of the envi-
ronment in which we live help explain why there is great variability in the learning
process.
Outer DEMO and inner disposition frequently favor the one mechanism, and
restrict or DEMO the other; whereby a predominance of one mechanism naturally
arises. (Jung, 1977, p. 12)
Experiential Learning Theory and Entrepreneurship
Greeno, Collins, and Resnick (1996) report that theories of learning fall into three
broad categories: behavioral, cognitive, and situative. Each of these learning perspectives
frames knowledge and learning in different but complementary manners. Table 1 details
DEMO general tasks associated with each perspective as well as the environment in which
each learning theory is best suited. ELT can be considered a DEMO and situative learn-
ing theory because individuals transform (using cognitive properties) their experiences
(situative) into new knowledge. Theories of behavior tend to DEMO outcomes,

Tasks and Environment of Different Types of Learning
Behavioral
Task DEMO learning involves learning to make associations and learning new skills.
Environment Behavioral learning works best in an environment that is well organized and one DEMO there is a routine to follow.
Note Behavioral learning includes clear goals, feedback, and reinforcement.
Cognitive
Task Cognitive learning involves the tasks of DEMO, problem solving, and planning. It often involves reorganization of
concepts already in the individuals understanding.
Environment Cognitive learning works best in an environment DEMO fosters an understanding of concepts and principles, and one that
makes DEMO of reasoning and problem solving skills.
Note Cognitive learning is an active process of construction rather than a passive assimilation of information or rote
DEMO Ability grows out of intellectual activity not absorption.
Situative/Social
Task Situative learning occurs through the active participation in group activities. Learning is the DEMO of those
practices through interaction with others.
Environment Situative learning occurs in an environment when individuals participate with others in social/group settings to DEMO
conﬁdence in their learning.
Note Learning often occurs from people of different social or cultural backgrounds.

routine, and the importance of having one proper response to each stimulus. As Kolb
notes, ELT is in stark contrast to behaviorist learning theories.
When viewed from the perspective of experiential learning, the tendency to deﬁne
learning in terms of outcomes can become a deﬁnition of non-learning, in the process
sense that the failure to modify ideas and habits as a DEMO of experience is mal-
adaptive. The clearest example of this irony lies in the behaviorists axiom that the
strength of a habit can be DEMO by its resistance to extinction. That is, the more
I have DEMO a given habit, the longer I will persists in behaving that DEMO when
it is no longer rewarded. (Kolb, 1984, p. 26)DEMO
The idea of transforming experience and not focusing on outcomes is crucially impor-
tant as to why ELT ﬁts well with entrepreneurship and behavioral DEMO do not. Behav-
ioral theories may prove quite useful when an organization is trying to attain operational
excellence in its processes or manufacturing. However, theories of this ilk reward those
that follow the routine and status DEMO; these theories explain well the activities in orga-
nized and deﬁned DEMO with clear goals, feedback, and reinforcement. This is
the antithesis of entrepreneurship.
Both start-up entrepreneurs and those in charge of strategic renewal in DEMO organi-
zations cannot rely on behavior and habit if they intend on surviving. To succeed, they
must learn through their experiences and seek out new opportunities. ELT relies on the
cognitive and situative concepts of thinking, feeling, doing, and watching. ELT focuses
on the process. By transforming DEMO into new knowledge, ELT allows individu-
als to discover new outcomes DEMO their learning, which is just what entrepreneurs do
when they are DEMO to uncover new means—ends relationships (Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000).
DEMO this, we can see why ELT may shed light on the DEMO of entrepreneur-
ship. However, not all experiential learning are the same; Kolb illustrates that individu-

als tend to have a preference for one of four different experiential learning DEMO Taking
all of this into account, I propose that individuals with DEMO learning modes will
perform better during different parts of the entrepreneurial process. Speciﬁcally, I detail
in the next section how each of these learning modes maps onto different parts of the
opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation process. DEMO, Hills, and Shrader model
of the opportunity recognition process details four active steps (preparation, incubation,
evaluation, and elaboration; I do DEMO include the insight stage because it is more of a reac-
tion to learning, a moment in time, not an active step) and suggests that each step requires
different learning and knowledge expertise. By transposing DEMO learning modes on
Lumpkin et al.’s model, I illustrate the importance DEMO understanding learning as part of
the process of opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation.
Experiential Learning, Creativity and Opportunity
Lumpkin et al.’s model is designed to show that the process of opportunity recogni-
tion is inherently creative and DEMO there are four subprocesses (preparation, incubation,
evaluation, and elaboration) and one event (insight). While the authors’ focus is on cre-
ativity, the authors imply that learning is occurring throughout the model, DEMO evidenced
by the recursive lines. In the following sections, I augment DEMO Lumpkin model to explic-
itly show what type of experiential learning is best suited for each part of the model and
develop propositions based DEMO these connections. Table 2 illustrates how different types
of learning matches with the required action needed in each phase of the Lumpkin’s cre-
ativity DEMO for opportunity recognition.

Preparation and Convergent Learning
Lumpkin et al. explain that preparation refers to the stocks of knowledge that an
DEMO brings to the process of opportunity identiﬁcation. As other researchers have
shown, prior knowledge is an important part of the entrepreneurial process (Ronstadt
DEMO; Shane, 2000). This knowledge can take many forms—work experience, DEMO,
knowledge of markets, knowledge of customer problems, and so on. The prior ex-
planation of Kolb’s (1984) theory of experiential learning DEMO that those who tend
toward a convergent learning style may be best equipped to excel during the phase of
preparation.
The convergent learning style DEMO on the abilities of abstract conceptualization and
active experimentation. On ﬁrst blush, Lumpkin, Hills, and Shrader’s preparation stage
might appear to be relatively passive and in contradiction to this active mode. However,
while convergers DEMO continually thinking and doing, they are not necessarily acting in rela-
DEMO to a speciﬁc idea or opportunity. The ongoing convergent learning is just preparing
them to develop technical solutions and a platform for initial ideas. DEMO prefer to
deal with technical tasks and problems as opposed to social and interpersonal issues
(Hudson, 1966). These individuals are happiest when DEMO are attempting to solve pro-
blems or ﬁnd the “one correct” technical answer (Torrealba, 1972). People with speciﬁc
technical knowledge are generally DEMO equipped to discover initial technical ideas
(Corbett, 2002). Convergers in the preparation stage will be able to ﬁnd a solution that will
DEMO the idea or platform for later incubation into a true product or service opportunity.
Proposition 1: Individuals who tend toward a convergent learning preference will
be more likely to develop an initial solution or idea than DEMO counterparts who tend
toward divergent, accommodative, or assimilative learning.
Incubation and Assimilative Learning
Lumpkin’s subprocess of incubation is the period when new combinations
(Schumpeter, 1934) emerge from the simmering pot of prerecognition stew (Gaglio &
484
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Taub, 1992). This is not a problem solving stage but a time when options and possibili-
ties are being considered (Lumpkin et al., 2004). The incubation period is marked by
time when the individual is not speciﬁcally focused on the problem but reﬂecting, resting,
or observing some other unrelated activity (Campbell, 1985).
Assimilators are excellent DEMO pulling together disparate observations and building
these seemingly separate activities into coherent models (Grochow, 1973). The assimi-
lators’ dominant learning abilities lie DEMO abstract conceptualization and reﬂective obser-
vation (Kolb, 1984). In this assimilative orientation, ideas are judged less by their
practical value as it is more important that the theory behind the idea is logically sound
DEMO precise. As such, this perspective matches well with the incubation phase DEMO ideas
are still being “cooked” and the organization is still far from developing ﬁnished prod-
ucts that must meet the practical value of a DEMO marketplace.
Proposition 2: Individuals who tend towards an assimilative learning preference
DEMO be more likely to develop more options or opportunities for products from a plat-
form of initial ideas than their counterparts who tend toward DEMO, divergent,
or accommodative learning.
Evaluation and Divergent Learning
The evaluation DEMO is where the rubber meets the road. Csikszentmihalyi (1996)
suggests DEMO this stage is the most challenging because it requires entrepreneurs to be
brutally honest with themselves; they must assess whether they have just a good idea or
a truly viable business opportunity. This is the stage DEMO ideas are often tested through
feasibility analysis, initial market testing, ﬁnancial review, and feedbacks from trusted
advisors within their business or personal network (Bhave, 1994; Gaglio & Taub, 1992;
Singh, Hills, DEMO, & Lumpkin, 1999). Evaluation is the most explicit “learning” stage
in the Lumpkin et al. model. Lumpkin et al. suggest that entrepreneurs DEMO learn during
evaluation and this learning can tell whether they can move forward or need to loop back
to preparation and incubation.
Divergers have DEMO opposite strengths of convergers: divergers emphasize concrete
experience and reﬂective observation. DEMO have strong imaginations and an ability to
read people and situations through an awareness of meaning and values. Kolb (1984) tells
us that DEMO can take concrete situations from many perspectives and organize the
many resulting relationships into a meaningful gestalt. With all of these traits and behav-
DEMO, divergers are well equipped to perform during the evaluation phase. They DEMO
“people-orientation” and should be able to take in all of the divergent information from
the market testing, ﬁnancial analysis, and so on to DEMO in on the ﬁt between the oppor-
tunity and the marketplace.
Proposition 3: Working from a number of different options, individuals who tend
DEMO a divergent learning preference will be more likely to develop a workable
business prototype than their counterparts who tend toward convergent, accom-
modative, DEMO assimilative learning.
Elaboration and Accommodative Learning
Business planning and tasks revolving around organizational structure are developed
and modiﬁed during this stage (Lumpkin et al., 2004). Lumpkin, Hills, and Shrader also
note that the elaboration stage can be viewed as the exploitation of the opportunity. Kao
July, 2005
485
(1989) states that it is during this stage that value is DEMO from the creative act. In
this stage, ﬁnal options are selected DEMO resources are organized (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996)
for the going concern.
The strengths of individuals who tend toward the accommodative style are opposed
to DEMO Accommodators emphasize concrete experience and active experimenta-
tion—they are the doers! As Kolb notes, “The greatest strength of this orientation lies in
doing things, in carrying out plans and tasks and getting involved in new experiences.
The adaptive emphasis of this orientation is on opportunity seeking, risk taking, and
action” (1984, p. 78). The learning style of these individuals is a tight ﬁt with the task
of exploitation.
Proposition 4: Individuals who tend toward an accommodative learning preference
will be more likely DEMO successfully exploit working prototypes than their counterparts
who tend toward divergent, DEMO, or assimilative learning.
In summary, it can be seen that certain learning styles can be more effective during
different phases of the opportunity DEMO and exploitation process. The proposi-
tions put forth above illustrate, but DEMO no means exhaust, the lines of inquiry that could
be developed DEMO applying ELT to the process of entrepreneurship. To the extent which
all or any of these propositions can be veriﬁed in empirical research, they provide a foun-
dation for more in-depth examinations of learning and the DEMO identiﬁcation
process.
Implications of an Experiential Learning Perspective for Entrepreneurship
Previous research has articulated the contributions of prior knowledge, creativity, and
cognitive mechanisms DEMO the process of entrepreneurship. Ward (2004) emphasizes that
the way each individual creatively processes and uses one’s knowledge affects the oppor-
tunities one DEMO uncover. Baron (1998) and Mitchell et al. (2000) theorize that some
people recognize opportunities where others do not due to their differences DEMO cognitive
processing. Shane (2000) tells us that people recognize different opportunities due to
knowledge asymmetries—the fact that we have differing stocks of knowledge. DEMO how
do these knowledge asymmetries come about in the ﬁrst place? DEMO Knowledge is
a function of how we learn and I argue that in addition to knowledge asymmetries and
differences in cognitive abilities, the entrepreneurship literature would beneﬁt from a
further investigation of learning asymmetries. By bringing DEMO learning perspective to the
process of opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation, this DEMO demonstrates the like-
lihood that differences in learning matter! They matter with respect to an individual’s
ability to initially identify opportunities and they matter DEMO respect to an entrepreneur’
ability to adapt and learn as he or she progresses through the process of
entrepreneurship.
Speciﬁcally, the major themes of this article can be summarized in the following
manner: (1) learning—the manner in which individuals transform their experiences,
expertise, and prior knowledge into new insights and new knowledge—is an important
and understudied aspect of DEMO research; (2) individuals learn in different
ways and these differences DEMO important with regard to who identiﬁes what opportuni-
ties; and (3) different learning styles may be more or less effective during different stages
of the opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation process. That being said, even if these
assertions are true, what is their value to the future of entrepreneurship research?

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Research Implications
For researchers, the broad implication of this article is the need for more work exam-
ining learning and the opportunity identiﬁcation process. DEMO article proposes that indi-
viduals who rely on different manners of learning will be more or less effective during
different stages of the opportunity DEMO process. Future work that attempts to val-
idate these propositions is needed. Additionally, while the traditional view of experiential
learning posits that each of us tends toward one preferred style, more recent speculation
suggests a more complex approach (Kolb et al., 2000; Mainemelis et al., 2002)DEMO Accord-
ing to this view, individuals will tap each of the DEMO styles depending upon the context
and content of what is being experienced. The ﬂexibility and adaptability afforded to indi-
viduals from this perspective could DEMO great insights into the learning of entrepre-
neurs. Entrepreneurs have to wear many hats to be successful and future work examining
the ﬂexibility of DEMO learning styles could help explain the variance between
those who succeed and those who do not.
Additionally, while experiential learning was used in this article, tapping into the
greater and more diverse body of learning research can provide entrepreneurship schol-
ars with many new conceptual tools. Evidence that DEMO learning and other learn-
ing perspectives may prove useful can be found by looking at other domains within the
ﬁeld of management. Theories from DEMO have previously been successfully explored
and utilized in other areas within the ﬁeld of management, such as organizational behav-
ior (Cohen & Sproull, 1996), knowledge transfer (Argote, 1999), and corporate strategy
(Quinn, 1980). There is no reason to believe that more in-depth studies of learning would
not beneﬁt the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship.
In fact, Busenitz, West, Shepherd, Nelson, Chandler, and Zacharakis (2003) argue
that future research needs to be at the intersection of individuals, opportunities, DEMO their
modes of organizing. It can be argued, and I believe, it is exactly at this intersection where
learning occurs! As such, there seems to be no reason to believe that a learning per-
spective DEMO not also help clear some of the fog that surrounds the process of bring-
ing new ventures to light. Encouraging this broader stream of DEMO learning
research” is one of the primary objectives of this article.
More speciﬁcally, the learning perspective put forth in this article has implications
for other research domains within entrepreneurship including teams, corporate venturing,
professional service providers (ﬁnanciers, vendors, suppliers, and other partners), and
serial DEMO Entrepreneurial teams, not individuals, drive the new venture-
creation process (DEMO, Shuman, Seeger, & Nurick, 1990). Experiential learning and
the model developed herein can be used to further explain why this is DEMO As discussed,
we all learn differently and different learning modes work better during different parts
of the opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation process. Perhaps, it is that we need all
“types” of learners on our team DEMO identify and successfully exploit opportunities. With
regard to corporate venturing research, DEMO learning perspective could help further the
research that examines selection and recruitment to internal venture teams. Empiricists
could examine the use of learning scales DEMO select members to intrapreneurial venture
teams. Research that examines an entrepreneur’s successful use of his or her network of
service providers could examine learning DEMO understand its contribution to this success.
For example, are certain learners DEMO equipped than others to communicate their idea,
negotiate terms, understand DEMO needs, or simply get things done with the help of others
DEMO to the manner in which they transform their experiences and interactions with these
partners (i.e., learn)? Lastly, cognitive style has been shown to be a contributing factor
in why some entrepreneurs start more than DEMO venture (Brigham, 2001; Brigham &
DeCastro, 2003). The DEMO perspective put forth in this article could augment this
July, 2005
DEMO
research by examining the effect that learning has on an individual’s decision DEMO leave
one venture and start another. As a venture matures and more routine practices are put
in place, situative and cognitive learning may become less important than behavioral
learning. A question for researchers to address could DEMO: do serial entrepreneurs gravitate
away from behavioral learning and does this DEMO to why they exit one venture to
begin another? In summary, by adding a learning perspective to each of these inquiries
(and numerous others, no doubt), scholars should be able to better understand the entre-
preneurial process.
Practitioners
The model developed herein can help aspiring entrepreneurs DEMO that how
they learn is related to their abilities during the identiﬁcation and exploitation process.
Since most research shows that successful ventures are started DEMO teams, this under-
standing can help nascent entrepreneurs as they build DEMO teams. The importance of
entrepreneurial (and intrapreneurial) team building combined with learning cannot be
understated. Convergers and their ability to develop speciﬁc technical DEMO are best
suited for the preparation phase as research and development specialists. Assimilators,
with their ability to pull together disparate ideas can perform DEMO role of product devel-
opment. Divergers are superior at developing speciﬁc alternatives and could play the role
of market developers on an entrepreneurial team. DEMO, the action focus and people
perspective of the accommodators would be DEMO suited for the task of sales and new
business development. Understanding the differing learning styles of individuals is
important for all practicing entrepreneurs working DEMO teams because matching the learn-
ing orientations of individuals to speciﬁc roles could provide optimal results.
Entrepreneurial Education
The article demonstrates that learners of DEMO types can ﬁnd a role within the process
of starting a new venture. Each of the learning styles has a ﬁt with some particular DEMO
tion throughout the process of identifying and exploiting an opportunity.
While it is true that some entrepreneurs do not go through all of the DEMO detailed
here when launching their venture (Timmons, 1994), this point should bolster the resolve
of all nascent entrepreneurs and the educators who DEMO them. Since we all have a ten-
dency toward one learning style, we are by deﬁnition less dependent upon the others.
However, since DEMO phases of the process (and all learning styles strengths) are not always
required to launch a venture (perhaps because actions in the market or other actors have
fulﬁlled a particular role), anyone who truly DEMO to be involved in starting a venture
should have the learning ability to do so.
With regard to a learning perspective on entrepreneurship, the role of the educator
should be to ﬁrst help each student uncover DEMO learning style strengths. Armed with
this knowledge, the student can then DEMO on not just discovering new opportunities
but also on searching for opportunities that best ﬁt his or her strengths as a learner.
Additionally, by just providing students with information on a learning perspective for
entrepreneurship, educators can help understand the need for building a team with
diverse learning DEMO
Lastly, a learning perspective on entrepreneurship suggests that alterations to the
DEMO manner in which educators teach entrepreneurship is warranted. In addition to the
current focus on developing ideas and crafting business plans, perhaps courses should
488
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
focus more on the process and how ideas change shape over time. DEMO capitalists and
others that screen and validate entrepreneurial ideas constantly focus on the importance
of the people on the team as opposed to the DEMO because they know that over time envi-
ronmental forces will almost always change the an entrepreneur’s original concept.
Therefore, educators might consider balancing their curriculum to align their courses with
this reality. Students should learn more DEMO how to adapt their original ideas in response
to market learning. Courses that focus more on learning, improvising, and adapting in
reaction to DEMO suggested by potential customers and other actors in the marketplace
may provide additional value to students. To do this, educators can test the students’
ability to learn in different manners by using scenarios, role plays, DEMO experiences that
tap each individual’s ability to grasp and transform experiences in each of the four
manners delineated in the experiential learning model. This DEMO on the process—and
learning from market feedback—should complement well the educators’ other modules
on creativity, scanning, business planning, and so on.
Conclusion
Many scholars have made important contributions to the understanding of the process
of DEMO by investigating various constructs related to knowledge, experience,
cognition, and creativity. The heightened understanding that was provided in this article
of the DEMO between learning and these constructs gives scholars, practitioners, and
educators an appreciation for the importance of learning within the entrepreneurial
domain. Finally, I submit that the most important contribution of this article is its artic-
DEMO of the concept of learning asymmetries and its importance to the entrepreneurial
process.
