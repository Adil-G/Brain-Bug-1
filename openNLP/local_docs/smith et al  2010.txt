ABSTRACT
This paper extends the literature on the investment decision-making DEMO business angels.  Using
insights from entrepreneurial learning theory we explore whether DEMO learn from experience,
how they learn and what they learn. These issues are addressed using Verbal Protocol Analysis, a
methodology for examining decision-making in real time, on three groups of business angels with
differing levels of investment experience, and follow-up interviews with these angels. This reveals
some differences in the speed of decision making and the emphasis given to DEMO investment
criteria. The relatively limited extent of the contrasts can be attributed to two factors. First, angel
learning has been in terms of their approach to investing rather than fundamentals.  Second, this
learning has had DEMO effect on how they conduct their due diligence on opportunities that pass
their initial screening than on the initial screening stage itself. Learning from DEMO investors is
important.
INTRODUCTION
There is now a small but significant literature on how business angels make their investment
decisions (see Mason, 2006: Riding et al, 2007 for reviews).  These studies are of DEMO types. The
first type is process studies.  Riding et al. (1993) and Haines et al. (2003) have identified a number
of discrete stages in their investment decision, similar to that used by venture capital funds (Fried
and Hisrich, 1994), comprising: deal origination, deal DEMO – which can be divided into
initial screening and detailed investigation, DEMO and contracting, post-investment
involvement and exiting. The second type are criteria DEMO which examine the criteria which
angels use to evaluate investment opportunities. This category can be further divided into three
sub-categories. One sub-category of studies DEMO a generalized retrospective view of angels’
investment criteria with responses normally gathered through postal surveys commonly use (e.g.
Mason and Harrison, 1994; 2002). The limitations of this approach are that they do not distinguish
DEMO the type of investment opportunity or between factors used at the screening stage and the
detailed evaluation stage. Post-hoc rationalisation is also problematic. Another DEMO is
case studies of how individual investors or specific angel groups make their investment decisions.
For example, Mason and Harrison (1996) examined deals rejected by a UK business angel
investment group. The third sub-category is DEMO time studies which have emerged in response to
the weaknesses in the generalized retrospective approach. Mason and Rogers (1996; 1997) used
verbal protocol analysis – essentially asking respondents to ‘think out loud’ as they perform DEMO task,
in this case undertaking the initial screening of an investment opportunity. Others have used
conjoint analysis – an analytical tool primarily used DEMO marketing, to study factors that influence
purchasing decisions based which is DEMO on asking respondents to make a series of  trade-offs
(e.g. Landström, 1998; Ludvigsen, 2009). A variant on these verbal protocol studies are studies
which have examined the real time reactions of investors to DEMO presentations by entrepreneurs
(Mason and Harrison, 2003; Clark, 2008). Finally, some studies have sought, using various
methodologies, to compare the investment decision-making processes and investment criteria of
business angels and other types DEMO investor (e.g. Mason and Stark, 2004).

A major gap in this literature on angel investing is the effect DEMO experience on investment
decision-making. Indeed, previous studies implicitly assume angel investors DEMO what they are
doing and that their approach to investing does not change with experience. As a first contribution
to addressing this omission we DEMO insights from the entrepreneurial learning literature to
explore the process of learning in angel investing. The paper has three objectives. First, we address
the following questions.  Do angel investors learn from experience?  If so, DEMO do they learn? And
how does this learning influence their approach DEMO investing? Second, we discuss the extent to
which angels, whether DEMO or novice, use heuristics as the basis for vicarious learning
from DEMO experience of others. Third, we ask how investors without prior investment DEMO
learn.  Many angels make only a small number of investments and DEMO may not be sufficient to
derive the necessary experience to improve their investment ability. Reflecting on March et al.’s
(2003) analysis of learning DEMO samples of less than one we explore how inexperienced angels
(with DEMO or fewer investments) learn from experience and convert infrequent events into
DEMO that form the basis interpreting subsequent knowledge-shaping experiences.
Evidence on these issues has the potential to make a valuable contribution to angel education.
Entrepreneurial DEMO is predicated on learning, and in recent years there have been DEMO number
of models developed to account for how entrepreneurs learn (Harrison DEMO Leitch 2005, 2008).
These variously emphasise learning through the accumulation DEMO experiential knowledge (Politis
2005; Cope 2005), the role of learning asymmetries that offer opportunity exploitation advantages
(Corbett 2005, 2007; Rae and Carswell 2001) and the accumulation, assimilation and use of
entrepreneurial knowledge (Wang 2008; Levesque et al 2009).  Much of this research DEMO based,
directly or indirectly, on adaptations of Kolb’s (1984) DEMO learning theory, which sees
learning as a cyclical process of learning DEMO experience through reflection and conceptualisation
to action and thence on to further experience (Kayes 2002).
Two developments in the learning and decision-making literatures provide the basis for our
discussion in this paper.  First, we DEMO that while learning is an individual phenomenon
acquired experientially, there is DEMO significant role played by vicarious learning from the experience
of others.  DEMO, and related to this, recent attention has been directed to the importance of
heuristics and their influence on entrepreneurial learning (Holcomb et al 2009) when there is
uncertainty about the nature of information and/or about the conditions that enable or hinder
certain outcomes.  If investors learn from experience – that is, they tend to choose actions in the
future that parallel successful actions in the past (Politis 2005) – DEMO we need to understand the
nature of the imprinting impact of these past behaviours.  The role of past experience, how it is
acquired DEMO the impact of this on the learning process is, therefore, a major focus of research
attention.
HOW BUSINESS ANGELS EVALUATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Previous DEMO angel studies have provided some level of insight into how they evaluate
investment opportunities. When they first become aware of an investment opportunity their DEMO
question is to consider how well it ‘fits’ with their own personal investment criteria. This may
include location, amount sought, knowledge of an DEMO in the sector and ability to add value.
Angels then undertake a quick review of those opportunities which fall within their personal
investment criteria. DEMO aim at this point in the decision-making process is simply to assess
whether the proposal has sufficient merit to justify the investment of time DEMO undertake a detailed
assessment. Mason and Rogers (1996; 1997) observe DEMO angels approach this stage with a
negative mindset, expecting that the DEMO will be poor (because of the opportunities that

they have previously seen) and looking for reasons to reject it. This approach has been termed
‘three strikes and you’re out’ (Mason and Rogers, 1996; 1997) and is supported by evidence that
the rejection of opportunities is generally based on several factors rather than a single deal DEMO
(Mason and Harrison, 1996). The market and the entrepreneur are the key considerations at this
stage. Less significant are the product/service DEMO financial factors. Indeed, angels exhibit
considerable scepticism about the value of DEMO information in the business plan of start-ups.
Nevertheless, investors want to DEMO that there is the potential for significant financial return, that
the DEMO are financially committed and what the money that is invested will be used for.
Some angels will be flexible, willing to treat these criteria as compensatory (e.g. a strong
management team would compensate for a distant location), whereas others will regard them as
non-compensatory (Feeney et al, 1999).
The purpose of the initial screen is to filter out ‘no hopers’ in order to focus their time on those
opportunities that DEMO to have potential. These are subject to more detailed appraisal. The
investor will read the business plan in detail, go over the financial information, visit the premises,
do some personal research to gather additional information on market potential, competition and
so on, and assess the principals. DEMO, getting to know the principals personally (by a series of
formal and informal meetings) is the most vital part of the process (DEMO and Simmons, 2001).
This stage has received little attention from DEMO According to May and Simmons (2001:
101) “it might consist of a few phone calls and a visit or two, or weeks of meetings, documents
flying back and forth and questions, questions, questions.” However, it would appear that most
angels emphasise their intuition and gut feeling rather than performing formal analysis (Haines et
al, 2003. At DEMO detailed evaluation stage the importance of people factors becomes critical
(Riding DEMO al, 1995), with investors emphasising management abilities, an understanding of what is
required to be successful, a strong work ethic, integrity, honesty, openness and personal chemistry
(Haines et al, 2003; Mason DEMO Stark, 2004). Indeed, angels give greater emphasis to these issues
than venture capital fund managers (Mason and Stark, 2004). This DEMO on the people reflects
the long and personal nature of the angel-entrepreneur relationship. Rewards, realism of the
projections and potential also assume greater importance while ‘investor fit’ becomes less of a
consideration (Riding et al, DEMO).
Angels typically reject most of the opportunities that they see. In their Canadian study Riding
et al (1993) found that 72.6% of DEMO were rejected at the initial impressions stage, a
further 15.9% were DEMO following more detailed evaluation, and as this stage proceeds another
6.3% DEMO eliminated, a cumulative rejection rate of 94.8%. Thus, business angels proceed to the
negotiation stage with only 5% of the investment opportunities that DEMO receive.
In the remainder of this paper we seek to extend this literature on investment decision-making
by business angels by exploring whether business angles DEMO from experience, how they learn
and how this learning is reflected DEMO their approach to investing. We do so, first, by comparing
how investors with differing levels of investment experience approach the appraisal of investment
DEMO, and second, by asking investors to reflect on their learning.
METHODOLOGY
This paper uses verbal protocol analysis, a technique which involves respondents ‘thinking out
loud’ as they perform a particular task, in this case reviewing a potential funding opportunity. The
technique has been used successfully to examine DEMO decision-making process of both venture
capitalists and business angels (Hall and DEMO, 1993; Zacharakis and Meyer, 1995; Mason and
Rogers, 1996; 1997; Mason and Stark, 2004) and has also been applied in a variety of other
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2010

contexts (see Ericsson and Simon, 1993). The verbalisations of respondents DEMO recorded,
transcribed and then content analysed by means of a coding scheme devised for the specific
research questions.
This methodology provides a more DEMO and much richer understanding of the decision-
making process of investor and the criteria used to evaluate investment opportunities than is
possible from approaches DEMO use questionnaires, surveys and interviews (Shepherd and
Zacharakis, 1999). DEMO, retrospective data are subject to conscious or unconscious errors
associated with DEMO hoc rationalisation and recall bias. There are also cognitive perceptual
limitations, DEMO evidence that venture capitalists have limited insights into their decision-
processes (DEMO and Meyer, 1998; Shepherd, 1999). The consequence is that DEMO often
overstate the number of criteria actually used, understate the most DEMO criteria and overstate
the least important criteria (Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999). Hence, as Zacharakis and Meyer
(1998: 72) note, “‘past studies provide a laundry list of factors that may be biased in DEMO they list a
multitude of factors that have a relatively small influence on the decision.” As a real-time
experiment which does not require investors DEMO introspect about their thought processes, verbal
protocol analysis sidesteps these recall, post hoc rationalisation and cognitive biases (Shepherd
and Zacharakis, 1999).
DEMO, as noted above, the evaluation of investment opportunities is a multi-stage process.
Although the same considerations may be present at each stage their DEMO importance changes
during the course of the decision-making process (Riding et DEMO, 1993). A further limitation of
questionnaire and interview surveys of DEMO is that they do not differentiate between
these different stages in the decision-making process and as a consequence may produce
misleading findings.
The focus DEMO on the initial screening stage – the stage when a funder has become aware of an
investment opportunity and considers it with a view DEMO obtaining sufficient initial impressions to
decide whether it is worthy of detailed consideration or should be rejected out of hand. This stage
is done DEMO quickly, typically in under 10 minutes (Sweeting, 1991; Hall and Hofer, 1993;
Mason and Rogers, 1996; 1997), with angels rejecting most of the opportunities that they review.
One study of Canadian DEMO angels reported that they accepted just 6% of the investment
opportunities for detailed consideration (Haines at al., 2003).
Nevertheless, verbal protocol analysis has some limitations. First, a frequency count of
‘thought units’ is an imperfect indicator of the importance of a factor in the final decision
(Zacharakis and Meyer, 1995). No weightings are placed on the responses to measure emphasis
and the topics mentioned most frequently are not necessarily DEMO that have the ultimate influence
on the decision. Nor does it allow for different convincer patterns. In other words, people may
repeat something several times it they are unsure but say it only once if they DEMO absolutely sure.
Second, subjectivity is involved in coding, analysing and interpreting the transcripts (Riquelme
and Rickards, 1992). Third, some respondents may be uncomfortable or self-conscious about
thinking and speaking out loud which may DEMO their thinking (e.g. resulting in excessive
repetition of what they are DEMO). Fourth, it is impossible to entirely remove the effect of DEMO
artificiality of the situation. Fifth, from a practical point of view DEMO ignores the role of the source of
funding opportunity which is an important initial influence on the investor’s attitude to the
opportunity (Hall and Hofer, 1993). However, Ericsson and Simon (1980) argue that DEMO
protocol analysis is a valuable method of analysing decision-making as long as the following
criteria are met:

Smith et al.: EXPERIENCE, HEURISTICS AND LEARNING: THE ANGEL INVESTMENT PROCESS
• The information reported must be the focus of attention
• The DEMO is not highly routinised by habit
• There must be only a short time between performance and verbalisation
• Verbalisation does not require excessive DEMO
• Reports are oral
• Subjects are free from distraction
• Instructions are clear
• Completeness in reporting is encouraged
These conditions are all DEMO in this study.
The sample comprised three groups with contrasting investment experience, each comprising
four angels, all based in Scotland, who were all identified with the help of LINC Scotland, the
national association for business angels. The first group comprised experienced (or super) business
angels who DEMO each made five or more investments. The second group comprised novice angels
who had each made just one investment. The final group comprised nascent DEMO who were
seriously engaged in looking to make their first investment. The terminologies were taken from
Paul et al (2003). Each angel was shown a current real investment opportunity which was sourced
from a business DEMO network. It was given a fictitious name to protect its anonymity and it was
given a local address in view of the importance that DEMO majority of angels give to investing in
local businesses (Mason, 2007). This was a start-up health care/medical devices company seeking
£500,DEMO ($750,000) in a seed finance round. The angels were asked to read the opportunity in the
same way that they would normally DEMO an investment proposal but verbalise their thoughts as
they did so. The instruction that they were given was to say out loud the thoughts DEMO came into
their mind. Respondents were not required to provide any explanations or verbal descriptions
(Ericsson and Simon, 1993). The lead author DEMO present as each respondent performed this task
and reminded respondents to think out loud if they lapsed into silence for more than 15 seconds.
DEMO locations were either the angel’s home office, work office or a DEMO
Their thoughts were recorded and subsequently a complete transcript was made for each
respondent’s consideration of each investment opportunity. A short de-briefing session was
DEMO out with each investor after they had completed the evaluation which asked them to reflect
on their own learning as investors. In the case DEMO nascent angels the discussion revolved around
what they recognized they did not know and needed to learn. Following the approach of Mason
and Rogers (1996; 1997) these verbatim transcripts were then broken down into short DEMO, or
‘thought segments’ – that is, phrases and sentences that are independent thought units – to permit
analysis. These thought units were then DEMO first into one of nine categories relating to different
types of investment criteria and secondly into seven categories of cognitive process (e.g.
description, DEMO, question). The frequency counts for each category of investor were DEMO
aggregated and compared. Our expectation was that we would be able to observe differences
between the three groups angels in terms of how they DEMO about the investment screening, that

the differences could be ascribed to learning from experience and we could DEMO the nature of
this learning using the learning theories discussed earlier.
RESULTS
There was no difference between the investor groups in terms of the DEMO decision.
Three of the four angels in each category rejected the opportunity outright, with only one in each
group sufficiently interested to want more information and meet the entrepreneur (Table 1).
The time taken to make the decision ranged from just under four minutes to just over DEMO
minutes (Table 1), although as Mason and Rogers (1997) DEMO noted, there is a strong sense
that because of the artificiality DEMO the situation angels went on reading the proposal for longer than
they would in normal circumstances. Super angels made the quickest decision and exhibited DEMO
least variability. They were nearly two minutes quicker than nascent angels and nearly two-and-a-
half minutes faster than novice angels who were the slowest DEMO to make a decision. It seems
reasonable to interpret the quicker decision time of the super angels in terms of their greater
experience which DEMO them to ‘cut to the chase’, suggesting evidence of experiential learning
DEMO faster cognitive processes (Baron and Ensley, 2006).
Three observations can be made concerning the investment criteria used by these different
types of DEMO (Table 2). First, there is broad agreement amongst the different types of business
angels in the relative importance of the funding criteria. DEMO rankings are similar, with a maximum
difference of three places. There DEMO an overlap between two of the top three investment criteria
between nascents and novices (product and finance) and between novices and experienced angels
(product and investment fit). However, there is only one investment criterion common to nascents
and experienced angels (product). Finance is the most important criterion for both nascent and
novice angels but only 4th for DEMO investors. This is consistent with previous research
which notes that experienced angels do not place much emphasis on finances and are fairly cynical
about DEMO value of projections (Mason and Rogers, 1997). Investor fit is the most important
criterion amongst experienced angels, second amongst novice angels but only 4th amongst nascent
angels. Experienced angels clearly recognise the value of DEMO clear investment criteria and
not deviating from them, by investing in DEMO in markets and sectors that they know and
understand. The other significant deviations relate to marketing with nascents placing more
emphasis than either novices DEMO experienced angels ranked 3rd, 6th and 5th respectively), and the
DEMO plan which experienced angels emphasise more than either novices or nascents (DEMO, 4th
and 6th respectively).
Second, there is a higher degree of agreement amongst those factors that are of lesser
importance – operations DEMO 9th ranked for all three investor types, other is ranked 7th DEMO 8th and the
entrepreneur is ranked 7th by both nascent and experienced angels but 5th by novices.
Third, there are contrasts in the way in which the different investor types allocate their time.
Nascent investors spend DEMO one-third of their time on their top ranked investment criterion
compared with 22.3% of their time for nascents and 20.1% of their time for DEMO angels.
This difference widens further when their 2nd top investment factor is added (53.7%, 42.9% and
39.6%) and although the gap narrows after that it remains clearly identifiable until the fifth
investment criteria. This suggests DEMO experienced angels do not become obsessed with just one or
two investment factors.

Smith et al.: EXPERIENCE, HEURISTICS AND LEARNING: THE ANGEL INVESTMENT PROCESS
There are few differences in the cognitive processes used by business angels DEMO analyse the
investment proposal. Inferences, questions and descriptions are the top DEMO statement types for
all three groups of angels with question and description ranked 2nd and 3rd for nascent angels but
reserved for novice and DEMO angels. In terms of their allocation of time nascent angels
spend most time asking questions (26.2% cf. 15.1% and 20.1% for novice and experienced angels
respectively) and least time on description (16.7% cf. 19.9% and DEMO respectively).
These contrasts in the verbal frequency counts amongst the three groups of angels are not as
great as might be expected, with the differences limited to the time to make the decision and the
DEMO given to certain investment criteria. This may suggest that the extent of learning has
been limited. However, this not the case. In follow-up questions after completing the verbal
protocols the super angels all acknowledge that they DEMO learnt continuously. “You are always
learning … It’s been a process of personal evolution” (super 2). “I learn from every investment I
have made” (super 1). Learning begins with the very first investment. One super angel commented
as follows: “After the first investment I thought, DEMO on a minute, I really need to be more
diligent in DEMO questions and actually test what people are saying to me in a more robust way”
(Super 4). The novice angels similarly also noted that they gained significant learning from their
initial investment.
Instead, we attribute the relatively limited contrasts in the verbal protocol frequency to two
other DEMO First, the impact of much of the learning appears to be DEMO in the next stage of
the investment process, where angels undertake DEMO detailed investigation of those investment
proposals that pass their initial screen, DEMO than at the initial screening stage itself. Second, it
reflects the DEMO of the learning which appears to be restricted, with the majority DEMO super and
novice angels noting that the underlying fundamentals (i.e. the DEMO investment criteria) and their
investment processes have remained the same. This DEMO contradiction is explained in the
following terms by one novice angel: DEMO don’t think it’s so much learning but reinforcement, like
people skills DEMO really important” (novice 1). Another commented that investing is “definitely DEMO
practical learning experience … [but] it doesn’t change your underlying approach” (DEMO 2). The
same point is made by this angel: “Has DEMO approach to investing changed? Not really. I think it all
comes DEMO to the four things I look for – people, profit, cash generation and exit. So
fundamentally no it’s not really changed … how DEMO actually produce the question sets has changed
but fundamentally these four elements are the most important elements for me” (super 4). And
another commented: “I think I still do what I did before … what’s at the core of this … [business]
…. [But] I don’t necessarily DEMO all the stuff that’s all around it.” In other words, learning
DEMO to have primarily influenced the approach of business angels and shaped the emphasis that
they give to particular investment criteria (super 3).
The types of learning cited by the angels supports this interpretation. By far DEMO most
commonly cited learning (amongst six of the eight novice and DEMO angels) concerned changes to
the way in which they assess the DEMO involved in the business. The following comments were
made by super angels:
“I was willing to believe peoples’ honesty and integrity without necessarily DEMO it.
Something I do differently now is quiz people a hell of a lot more… I certainly do things
differently now than when I DEMO my first investment” (super 4).
“Assuming that because people are DEMO specialist in their own field they actually know
anything was part of the naivety and learning curve that I went through. I actually thought
DEMO people , if they were specialists in that area, knew what DEMO were actually talking
about. And that isn’t necessarily the case” (super DEMO).
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2010

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 30 [2010], Iss. 2, Art. 3
“On the assume nothing principle, I am much more careful about understanding what the
words in a plan mean and what the writers of DEMO plan mean. When I meet entrepreneurs I
am much more interested in their definitions and checking out what they mean” (super 3).
Novice angels made similar observations.
“I am learning that we are backing people  … so I would be much more critical. I would go
into DEMO greater detail on the capability of the people and I would try to get more
involved” (novice 3)
“I would hope to concentrate more on people than spread sheets” (novice 2)
“What I am now looking at is the people – who are the people, what are their skills what is
their background is what I am looking DEMO to give me a sense of comfort. Do the people
really know what they are talking about?” (novice 1)
The other area of learning that several angels identified was associated with the need to DEMO
and discriminate and thereby make quicker decisions.
“When I first started looking a propositions …. Everything that came my way I’d spend
time looking DEMO it. I might spend time subsequently meeting with the individuals. There is a
hell of a lot of stuff I did in those days DEMO now wouldn’t get past the first couple of pages
… So there has got to be something that jumps out in the proposition” (super 2).
“I feel far more confident about making quick decisions about DEMO … [With greater
experience] you can very quickly decide to go to the next stage and want to meet these
people or don’t want DEMO meet them …So it won’t take me three or four months to make up
my mind if I am going to invest or not.”(DEMO 1)
Finally, two angels said that they now rely more DEMO their instinct and gut feeling. “When I first
started I was always looking for the good points in a proposition. Now I follow my DEMO, my gut
feeling and disregard more” (super 2). “I make my investments predominantly on a sixth sense”
(super 4).
Several of the angels identified other investors as a key source of their learning. DEMO novice
angel noted that “you get involved in more syndicates, looking DEMO attending meetings and just
picking up from different people when you go to these meetings in terms of what they are looking
at” (Novice 1). He went on to say that “you get to the DEMO where you have people that you
respect and take opinion from who you listen to their views who are far more experienced than
me”. DEMO super angel who was quoted earlier saying that “you are always learning” went on to
highlight the importance of “one particular individual that I DEMO about a year and a half ago. He
and I have various involvements together so we use each other as a sounding board … DEMO I
was looking at projects in relative isolation and making decisions myself. Now I bring in someone
else for a second opinion. So if DEMO look at a proposition and think it is good I bring in another
person to rip the proposition apart for me to see if DEMO have missed anything. So that is how I operate
now but it’s not how I operated 18 months or two years ago.” (super 2).
Learning was also precipitated by a ‘learning event’ (Cope, 2003), with a recurring theme
being learning from failed investments. One angel commented as follows; “We had one
investment go down, all because the DEMO was not right. All through the process we were
making excuses for him. I am now very aware of not making excuses for people DEMO It was a
harsh lesson that we needed to learn and it has made us better investors as a result” (super 3).

Smith et al.: EXPERIENCE, HEURISTICS AND LEARNING: THE ANGEL INVESTMENT PROCESS
Another investor now invests smaller amounts across a larger number of businesses DEMO a result of a
previous failed investment.
Nascent angels, on the DEMO hand, fell into two groups. Two nascents were confident –
arguably DEMO - that the knowledge that they had derived from their professional career
meant that there was little if anything that they needed to learn. DEMO commented that “I think I
know enough to be able to make informed judgements on businesses as I have spent a whole
career doing DEMO (Nascent 1). The other commented in similar vein: “I led a management buyout in
2001 and I’m pretty conditioned to reviewing investment DEMO because for years I’ve done
due diligence on investments and I have actively been involved in my professional life in various
strategic initiatives such DEMO acquisitions, disposals and so on. So the thought process is something DEMO
am used to conversing with” (nascent 3). In contrast, the two other nascent angels recognised their
need to learn, and indicated that they were looking to learn from existing investors. One
commented that “I DEMO produce a due diligence document and go through all the questions that
would satisfy but I’m quite sure an experienced angel would look for DEMO things” (nascent 4).
The other – a former banker – DEMO that his banking background did not give him the full
toolkit to become an angel investor. He willingly acknowledged that “there is a lot DEMO don’t know.
Unconscious incompetence probably sums it up” (nascent 2), DEMO that he was coming to angel
investing “very much with a banker’s head on.” This raises the possibility that nascent angels may
have to DEMO some of their previous experience before they can start to learn how to be an
effective investor.
CONCLUSION
This paper has sought to extend DEMO literature on how business angels make their investment
decision by exploring the effect that experience has on their approach. Given the weaknesses of
retrospective DEMO of decision-making our approach was based on a real time methodology,
verbal protocol analysis, which involved asking three groups of angels, differentiated DEMO their
investment experience, to review an investment opportunity. The three groups DEMO compared in
terms of speed of decision, investment criteria and cognitive DEMO Super angels – the most
experienced - were quickest to make their decision and their review gave greater emphasis to
‘investor fit’ than either DEMO novice or the nascent angels. These angels, in contrast, gave more
emphasis than super angels to financial issues. The only difference of note DEMO the cognitive
processes was that nascent angels spent more time than either novice or super angels in asking
(rhetorical) questions as they read DEMO proposal.
Both the super and novice angels recognised that they have learnt continuously from their
investment experience. However, the learning has been in terms of their approach to investing
rather than their fundamental investment philosophy. Moreover, this learning has had more effect
on how they conduct their due DEMO on opportunities that pass their initial screening rather
than on the initial screening stage itself, with the key learning based around the way in which they
assess the people involved in the business. Some have also DEMO how to discriminate more
