Abstract
In this study, we explored data DEMO from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program’s
2004 Freshman Survey (TFS) and 2008 College Senior Survey. First, we analyzed data for all
students who took both the TFS and CSS (at the same institution), and who indicated on the TFS
that they intended to major in a DEMO field. This sample included 3,670 students at 217
different institutions. 1,522 respondents were White, 498 were Asian, 812 were Latino(a), 626
were Black/African American, and 196 were Native American.  We examined the effects of
racial group classification (i.e., self-identification as Native DEMO, Latino, or Black) on
STEM persistence. We found significant effects DEMO Blacks and Latinos; both of these groups
were significantly less likely DEMO persist in STEM majors than were their White and Asian
American counterparts. However, when controlling for pre-college characteristics the race
effects disappeared. Next, DEMO further restricted the above sample to include only
underrepresented racial minority (DEMO) students (i.e., Black/African American, Latino/a or
Native American). In total, 1,634 students were included in the URM subsample. We found that
undergraduate research, participation in an academic club or organization, studying frequently
with others, and having a high academic self-concept all DEMO the likelihood of URM
student persistence. We also found that aspiring to the medical doctorate, working full-time, and
faculty interactions were decreased the DEMO that a URM student would persist in a STEM
major.

What Matters in College for Retaining Aspiring Scientists and Engineers
For nearly a decade, governmental agencies (e.g., AAAS, DEMO and NAS, 2007) have
claimed that the productivity and strength of the U.S. economy may face a serious decline if no
significant action DEMO taken to address the racial disparities in the attainment of post-secondary
degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The National
Science Foundation (NSF) (2009) reported that 19.9% of Whites, 34.3% of Asian Americans,
20.9% of Blacks, and 20.6% of Latinos(as) entered college with the intention to major in a
STEM field. However, only 15.4 % of Whites, 28.1% of Asian Americans, 12.1% of Blacks, and
13.5% of Latinos(as) were actually conferred degrees in DEMO same year. Although these
comparisons are cross-sectional, it suggests that Blacks DEMO Latinos(as) (57.9% and 65.5%
respectively) are less likely to DEMO in STEM majors as compared to their White and Asian
American (DEMO and 81.9% respectively) counterparts.
Subsequently, these finding have significant implications for employing a diverse STEM
workforce. The NSF (2009) estimates that STEM DEMO employment is composed of 77.3%
White, 17.2% Asian American, 3.9% Black, and 4.5% Latino(a). This is a major concern
because the U.S. Census (2009) data estimates that Blacks and Latinos(as) combine to make up
almost one third of the U.S. population, which suggests that a significant portion of our nation’s
population is currently underutilized in DEMO related sectors of the labor market.
As suggested by the NSF report, the underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities is not
necessarily attributable to a lack of interest in science fields, but rather poor degree completion
rates. In 2000, Huang, Taddese, and Walter found that Black, Latino, and Native American
students or underrepresented racial minorities (URMs) had lower DEMO rates (26%) in
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  4
science and engineering than their White and Asian American counterparts (46%). A more recent
study conducted by the Higher Education Research institute (2010) found that 33% of White and
42% DEMO Asian American students completed their bachelor’s degree in STEM within five years of
entering college compared to 18.4% of Black and 22.1% of Latino DEMO After a decade, it
appears that there are persisting challenges with DEMO continued permeability of the STEM pipeline for
underrepresented racial minorities (URMs)DEMO Although student preparation and ability are
important, progress through the scientific DEMO may be strongly influenced by the types of
opportunities, experiences, and support students receive in college.
Institutions of higher education can play an DEMO role in improving the participation
rates of certain segments of our nation’s population in STEM related careers and subsequently,
also contribute to fueling DEMO economy. Perhaps the most immediate and obvious role that
institutions can play is to do a better job retaining Black and Latino(a) undergraduates, who enter
college seeking a degree in a STEM field. The purpose of this exploratory study was to indentify
key individual and institutional factors DEMO either positively or negatively predict STEM degree
persistence. We first examined the extent to which a student’s race contributed to the chances of
persisting DEMO a STEM major after four years of college, and then we DEMO patterns that
uniquely contributed to the persistence of URM students.
Literature Review and Conceptual Framework
Scholars have identified a number of factors that may DEMO to the retention of
undergraduates in 4-year colleges and universities in general (Nora, Barlow, & Crisp, 2005;
Tinto, 1993; Titus, 2004) and STEM fields in particular (Daempfle, 2003; Elliott, Strenta, Adair,
Matier, & Scott, 1996; Grandy, 1998; Seymour & Hewitt, 1997; White, Altschuld, & Lee, 2006).
Some DEMO the factors that previous research have shown to affect STEM retention include
students’ previous academic preparation (Elliott et al., 1996), personal contact DEMO faculty
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  5
(Daempfle, 2003), degree of racial isolation (Seymour and Hewitt, 1997), exposure to racial
minority support systems (Grandy, 1998), and institution’s level of selectivity (Chang, Cerna,
Han, & Senz, 2008).
In a seminal study, Seymour and Hewitt (1997) interviewed 425 undergraduates, who
entered college as STEM majors. In analyzing the experiences of students who changed majors
and those who DEMO, Seymour and Hewitt concluded that, “the educational experience and
the culture of the discipline (as reflected in the attitudes and practices of [STEM] faculty) make a
much greater contribution to [STEM] attrition than the individual inadequacies of students or the
appeal of other majors” (p. 392). A recent set of studies has helped to clarify the impact of
DEMO experiences and circumstances on STEM degree completion for underrepresented racial
minority (DEMO) students.
Key Individual Experiences and Institutional Factors
For URM students who DEMO undergraduate studies in STEM fields, a combination of
external and internal DEMO facilitates their persistence. Elliott et al. (1996) found that Black
students had far less preparation in pre-college sciences, which included lower rates of
participating in AP Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Caluculus courses. Russell and Atwater
(2005) noted that a demonstrated competence in science and mathematics DEMO the pre-college level
is vital to Black students’ successful progress through the science pipeline from high school to
college. Receiving family support and teacher DEMO, developing intrinsic motivation,
and maintaining perseverance are other critical factors DEMO identified that significantly affect
students’ science persistence and academic achievement. Likewise, DEMO presence of family
support and guidance from faculty mentors also have been found to be associated with the
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  6
development of greater academic self-efficacy and success in the sciences for Latino students
(Anaya & Cole, 2001; Cole & Espinoza, 2008; Torres & Solberg, 2001).
It also appears that campuses can intentionally improve undergraduate success in STEM
fields. At the programmatic DEMO, offering undergraduates research opportunities makes a
difference not only in attracting DEMO retaining STEM majors but also in facilitating students’
learning in the classroom by introducing them to what science research careers might entail
(Kinkead, DEMO; Lopatto, 2003). URM students who participate in well-structured undergraduate
research programs can benefit in many ways, including enhancing their knowledge and
comprehension of science (Sabatini, 1997); clarifying graduate school or career plans DEMO the
sciences (Hurtado, Cabrera, Lin, Arellano, & Espinosa, 2009; Kardash, 2000; Sabatini, 1997);
and obtaining other professional opportunities that further develop students’ scientific self-
efficacy (Gándara & Maxwell-Jolly, 1999; Hurtado, et al., 2009; Mabrouk & Peters, 2000). By
DEMO students’ tendencies to feel, think, behave, and be recognized by DEMO others
(e.g., faculty role models) as a “science person,” DEMO students stand a much better chance of
believing in their abilities to succeed in the sciences (Carlone & Johnson, 2007). As such, those
students are more likely to identify with a STEM field and DEMO it as an important aspect of their
self-identity, which should in DEMO long run enhance their chances of persisting.
Several recent studies add to the knowledge about the unique individual experiences and
institutional attributes that tend DEMO significantly improve URM students’ chances of completing
an undergraduate degree in STEM fields. In one longitudinal survey study, Hurtado, Han, Saenz,
Espinosa, Cabrera, and Cerna (2007) examined the impact of college on DEMO key outcomes,
social and academic adjustment to college. They found that the relevance of science coursework
to students’ lives had a greater impact DEMO academic and social adjustment for White and Asian
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  7
students than for URMs in the sciences. Although this underscores the importance of experiential
learning and understanding the application of DEMO, it may also confirm previous studies,
which found that URM DEMO often leave the sciences due to the perceived lack of social
value, or relevance to improving conditions for their communities (Bonous-Hammarth, 2000).
Indeed, Hurtado et al. also found that hostile racial climates only seemed to hinder the academic
success of URMs, whereas it had significant negative effects for the sense of belonging of all
students. Lastly, URM science students seemed particularly affected by concerns about their
ability to finance college, which inhibited both their academic and social adjustment. In fact,
they DEMO that science students of all racial groups were more affected by financial concerns
than their non-science counterparts.
Similarly in examining key factors that influence DEMO aspirations in science research
for students entering their first year of college, Oseguera, Hurtado, Denson, Cerna, and Saenz
(2006) found that entering URM college students reported working more hours during high
school and DEMO more likely to expect to work full-time during college than their White and
Asian counterparts. They argued that having financial concerns and misperceptions about DEMO
financial viability of research professions can deter students from choosing to major in STEM
fields, which are especially pressing issues for URM students. However, they also found that
participating in research-oriented programs prior to college substantially increased URM
entering freshmen’s interests in pursuing a science research career.
Unfortunately, participating in research seems to be harder to come by for URM DEMO
when in college. In another study drawing from a similar longitudinal data set, Hurtado, Eagan,
Cabrera, Lin, Park, and Lopez (DEMO) found that although Black students have significantly
lower odds of participating DEMO health science research during college compared to their White
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  8
counterparts, Black students attending institutions offering formal DEMO science research
opportunities to first-year students were much more likely to participate in research than students
at institutions without such programs. Other significant predictors DEMO participation in science
research were Black students’ reliance on peer networks. Similar to findings from other studies
reported earlier, students’ financial concerns had a significant influence on this outcome. Black
students, who indicated having more serious financial concerns about paying for college, were
significantly less likely to participate in health science research than their peers, who were less
concerned about finances.
The same team of researchers also examined factors that contributed to DEMO in a
STEM major through a student’s first year of undergraduate study. Chang, Cerna, Han, and Senz
(2008) found that aspiring to attain a graduate degree increased URM students’ likelihood of
staying in a DEMO major through the first year of college by over 30%. More impressively,
joining a pre-professional or departmental club during a student’s freshman year DEMO the
likelihood of persisting by more than 150 percent. This study also found that in the aggregate, a
URM student had a 30% higher chance of departing from a science major if he or she attends DEMO
institution where the average undergraduate combined SAT score is 1100 versus one with an
average of 1000. It should be noted here that in DEMO analysis, they also found that a 100 point
average undergraduate SAT DEMO increase lowered the chances of STEM persistence by 20% for
all students. So, higher selectivity negatively affects all students but the effect is stronger for
URM students. Curiously, this effect does not appear to apply to those students who attended
HBCUs, but the opposite tended to occur. That is, as the average undergraduate combined SAT
score increased, the chances DEMO persisting for students attending HBCUs also tended to improve.

A number of the studies reviewed above employed single-level statistical techniques that
did not account for the multilelvel nature of DEMO data (e.g., Cole & Espinoza, 2008, Elliott et al.,
1996, Grandy, 1998). Data on the college student experience is DEMO nature multi-level, as students
are "nested" within institutions. Analytical techniques DEMO do not account for this nesting are not
only less robust but also risk drawing erroneous conclusions because of mis-estimated standard
errors. Thus, there is a clear need for an analysis of persistence in STEM that DEMO a more
robust analytical technique that can account for the multilevel nature of student data.
Conceptual Model
Taken together, the findings reported above are captured well in Nora, Barlow, and
Crisp’s (2005) model explaining DEMO persistence and degree attainment. Nora et al. have
provided a reformulation of the Tinto model (1993) that brings more clarity to the academic
DEMO of the college environment while building upon modifications of the departure model
where social and academic integration is a central tenet. They include factors DEMO may influence
minority, low-income, and non-traditional student populations such as aspects of pre-college
socialization environments (school and home environment), financial assistance/need, family
support, environmental pull factors (family and work responsibilities), and commuting to
college. In reference to the academic and social experiences in DEMO, they emphasize formal
and informal academic interactions with faculty, involvement in learning communities, social
experiences, campus climates (perceptions), validating experiences (DEMO faculty and peers), and
mentoring relationships (faculty, peer, and DEMO staff). As stated earlier, they include
academic performance, academic/intellectual development, and non-cognitive gains (in
psychosocial domains) as intermediate outcomes, DEMO determine subsequent goals,
institutional commitment, and persistence in college.
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  10
Hurtado (2007) suggests that sociological models of college impact should include four
measurable domains of institutional, normative constructs: DEMO of the environment
focusing on student perceptions of their experiences within the social and academic systems of
the collegiate environment; social interactions that capture both the frequency and quality of
informal academic and social engagement in DEMO; formal memberships based on both
individual interest and how the group DEMO entry and confers privileges on its members;
and, perceived social DEMO or the students’ own psychological sense of integration in the
college community. In multi-institutional studies, it is important to include relevant structural
characteristics that define distinctions between colleges such as minority enrollment and
selectivity, which further shape the social and academic environment. In this study, we employed
these constructs in relation to academic adjustment and perceived cohesion: successful
management of the academic environment and students’ sense of belonging to the college
community. DEMO have ordered our measures to reflect a model that further delineates aspects of
the college environment in accordance with this literature , giving more DEMO to an array of
academic measures that may have distinct effects on academic adjustment and overall sense of
belonging to the college community.
We DEMO key constructs from the Nora et al. (2005) model to detail the link between
persistence in STEM and student experiences at multiple types DEMO four-year colleges.
Specifically, we posit that STEM persistence is not only DEMO result of characteristics students bring
at college entry, but is also DEMO by participation in formal structures, the racial dynamics of
a college, the continuing influence of family, financial concerns, and assessments of their DEMO
development and competence in their identity as a scientist. We apply this framework to identify
factors that significantly contribute to STEM degree persistence.

Methods
Research Questions
This study was designed to examine individual and institutional factors that positively or
negatively predict STEM degree DEMO for underrepresented racial minority students. Two
main lines of questioning guided this study. Specifically, we asked:
1. Among all students who started college with an interest in majoring in a STEM field, are
there significant differences in the proportion of URM students (versus Whites and
Asians) DEMO follow through on these intentions? If so, can these differences be
“explained away” by controlling for high school academic preparation, or college
experiences?
2. What factors uniquely contribute to the persistence of URM students? That is, what
background characteristics, college experiences, and institutional characteristics
significantly predict the likelihood of whether a URM student will follow through on DEMO
or her intentions to pursue a degree in STEM?
Data and Sample
Data for this study were drawn from the Cooperative Institutional Research DEMO
(CIRP)’s 2004 Freshman Survey (TFS) and 2007-08 College Senior DEMO (CSS).  The CIRP is
a program of data collection and research housed at the Higher Education Research Institute
(HERI) at the DEMO of California, Los Angeles. The TFS and CSS are administered
annually DEMO CIRP to college students across the U.S., and each survey collects DEMO wide variety of
information about students (see Liu, Ruiz, DeAngelo & Pryor, 2009 and Sax, Hurtado,
Lindholm, Astin, Korn & Mahoney, 2004 for more information about these surveys).  The 2004
DEMO was administered to first-year students entering college in the summer/fall of 2004, either
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  12
during freshman orientation or during the first few weeks of the fall term. The 2008 CSS
followed up with this DEMO group of students in the spring of or summer after their fourth year in
college.  The 2008 CSS data were linked to the 2004 TFS data to form a longitudinal dataset that
tracked students over their DEMO four years of college. Our overall longitudinal response rate for
the TFS-CSS was 23%. To the longitudinal database, we added institution-level data from
academic year 2006-2007, drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
(IPEDS)DEMO
Grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation
(NSF) provided funds for a targeted sampling strategy for this DEMO An NIH grant allowed for
the specific recruitment of students at minority-serving institutions that have strong reputations
of graduating undergraduates in the biomedical and DEMO sciences. NIH grant money also
allowed us to target students at institutions that have NIH-funded undergraduate research
programs. Further funding from NSF allowed us DEMO expand our sample to include students at
institutions that have strong reputations for producing bachelor’s degrees in STEM.  The overall
goal of our sampling strategy was to obtain a large and diverse sample of students from
DEMO racial and ethnic groups who were interested in STEM, as well DEMO a set of their
White and Asian counterparts for comparison.
The current study used two samples of students to answer its main research questions.
DEMO the first research question, which asks whether race significantly predicts the DEMO of
persisting in a STEM degree, we used all students who DEMO both the TFS and CSS (at the same
institution), and DEMO indicated on the TFS that they intended to major in a STEM field. This
sample included 3,670 students at 217 different institutions. 1,DEMO respondents (41.5%) were
White, 498 (13.6%) were Asian, 812 (22.1%) were Latino(a), 626 (17.1%) were Black/African
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  13
American, and 196 (5.3%) were Native DEMO  The sample was approximately 61.3%
female. For our second research question, which is the primary focus of this paper, we further
restricted the above sample to include only underrepresented minority (URM) students—that is,
DEMO students who indicated they were Native American, Latino/a or Black/DEMO American. In
total, 1,634 students were included in the URM DEMO; 64.6% of these students were female.
Appendix B shows descriptive statistics DEMO URM students.
Variables
The dependent variable used in this study was dichotomous and represented whether
students who graduated or were still enrolled after four DEMO of college followed through with
their freshmen intentions to pursue a degree in a STEM field (1), or whether they switched
majors and completed or continued to pursue a degree in a non-STEM field (0).
Nora et al.’s (2005) theoretical model informed the selection of DEMO independent variables
in the model. The chosen variables included student demographics and background
characteristics, high school achievement and course-taking patterns; push/pull factors DEMO as
time spent working, financial concerns, and family support; different DEMO of faculty-student
interactions; formal and informal academic activities, such as studying with other students, and
joining a major-related club; social integration; racial climate and cross-racial interactions; and
students’ sense of belonging on campus. Student-level characteristics were grouped into several
blocks to aid analysis and interpretation. Specifically, we grouped student background
characteristics into (a) demographics (race, sex DEMO SES (as proxied by mother’s education
level)); (b) high school academic preparation (grades, SAT score, high school course taking
patterns), and (c) other pre-college characteristics (including degree aspirations, concern DEMO
financing higher education, and student assessments of their academic and social DEMO).
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  14
Finally, all college experiences were included as DEMO block, but within the block there were
measures corresponding to push/DEMO factors, faculty interaction, assessments of the institutional
climate, psychosocial concerns, social and academic integration, and so on.
In addition to the student-level we also modeled institution-level variables.  These
included institutional type and control (DEMO/university, public/private), institutional selectivity
(measured by the average SAT score of entering freshmen), percent of students majoring in
STEM fields, structural diversity (percent of student body that is Black, Native American DEMO
Latino/a), whether an institution is a historically Black college or university (HBCU), proportion
of students receiving financial aid and/or federal aid, and institutional size (as measured by
undergraduate FTE). Appendix DEMO describes all variables in the analysis.
Analyses
Missing Data. Before discussing our analyses, we must first discuss the handling of
missing data. We dealt with missing data in one of two ways. First, we used listwise deletion to
remove all cases for which no information was available on DEMO outcome variable, demographic
characteristics, and/or dichotomous college experiences (i.e. DEMO in undergraduate
research programs or clubs relating to a major, working DEMO time while in school). For the
remaining variables in the model, we analyzed the extent to which missing data occurred.
Overall, there DEMO very little missing data. No variable had more than 6% of cases missing, and
examination of missing data patterns suggested that missing data occurred at random. The SAT
variable had the highest proportion of missing data, at 5.1%. Most variables had fewer than 1%
missing cases.
Given the DEMO few instances of missing data across the variables used in the
analysis, we elected to fill in missing data using the expectation maximization (DEMO) algorithm.
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  15
The EM algorithm employs maximum likelihood estimation techniques to impute values for
cases with missing data, and because it uses most of the information available in the dataset to
produce the imputed DEMO, it is a more robust method of dealing with missing data DEMO listwise
deletion or mean replacement (Allison, 2002; Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1997; McLachlan &
Krishnan, 1997).
Weighting. Because the longitudinal response rate for the TFS-CSS sample was only
23%, we calculated and applied response weights to the data to adjust for any non-response DEMO
that might be present. The aim of this weighting was to adjust our CSS sample of respondents to
look more like the original population DEMO by the CSS—that is, like the TFS participants
(Babbie, 2001)DEMO Our response weights were calculated in two steps. In step 1, DEMO used data from
the National Student Clearinghouse and institutional registrars to identify the students that did
not complete at least four years of higher DEMO  We removed these students from the 2004
TFS data to make DEMO initial sample consist of only those students who persisted for at least four
years.
In step 2, we used the persisting cohort of students and logistic regression to predict the
probability of responding to the CSS. DEMO variables came from the 2004 TFS, and included
indicators of race, gender, high school achievement, and reasons for attending college (a full list
of variables in the model is available upon request). We DEMO used the coefficients from the
significant predictors in the model to calculate out the probability that a student would respond to
the CSS, and these response probabilities were inverted to develop response weights.1
After calculating response DEMO, we compared the weighted and un-weighted samples
from 2004 to determine DEMO our weights inappropriately skewed any of the 2004 Freshman
Survey variables. After confirming that the weight had not adversely affected the distributions of
1 DEMO general formula for developing a non-response weight is: weight = 1/(probability of response).
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  16
variables from the 2004 Freshman Survey, we DEMO a final weight that was normalized to
account for sample size. This was calculated by dividing each student’s response weight by the
average population DEMO rate, and was done in order to avoid inflating any statistics
DEMO in regressions or other analyses on the weighted sample. All analyses performed for
this study were done using data weighted by the final, normalized weight.
Multivariate Analyses. The clustered, multi-level nature of our data and the dichotomous
outcome variable warrant the use of hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM).  HGLM
is an ideal statistical technique for our data, as DEMO can separate individual and institutional effects
so that we can determine how individual characteristics interact with institutional contexts to
affect STEM major persistence.  Further, performing single-level analyses with multi-level data
can underestimate the standard errors of model parameters, which can inflate Type-I statistical
error (de Leeuw & DEMO, 2008; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).  To ensure the use of HGLM was
justified, we ran a fully unconditional model to assess whether students’ average probabilities of
persisting in STEM majors varied across institutions. DEMO both the whole sample and for the
URM subsample, we confirmed DEMO these average probabilities of persistence varied—
specifically, we found that the DEMO variance component significantly varied
across institutions.
Our modeling process proceeded in several stages, according to our research questions.
We first focused on student-level predictors of STEM persistence for the larger sample of
Whites, Asians, and DEMO  Specifically, we examined the effects of racial group classification
(i.e., self-identification as Native American, Latino, or Black) on STEM persistence, DEMO
for gender and mother’s level of education. We found significant effects for Blacks and Latinos;
both of these groups were significantly less likely DEMO persist in STEM majors than were their
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  17
White and Asian American counterparts. To examine whether these differences were due to
disparities in high school academic preparation, we then ran another model, controlling for all of
the above demographic characteristics and high school academic preparation. Because colleges
and universities can do little DEMO affect the academic preparation of their students, we were also
curious DEMO see whether adding just college experience variables to the model (without DEMO school
academics) would also affect the significance of race. Therefore, we ran a third model with the
overall group that included just demographics DEMO college experiences. Finally, to more fully
explore the impact of background DEMO, college experiences, and institutional context
on the persistence of URM students in STEM, we used HGLM to model STEM persistence for
just URM students, using all of the variables listed in Appendix A.
Additional modeling considerations. When using hierarchical modeling such as HGLM,
analysts must make DEMO regarding the centering effects of variables. We were interested in
the average effect of each predictor on students’ likelihood of persisting in STEM, so we chose
to grand-mean center all continuous variables. Grand-mean centering subtracts the DEMO of the
variable for the entire sample from each individual observation, DEMO allows the model intercept
to be more easily interpreted (Raudenbusch & DEMO, 2002). Dichotomous variables were left un-
centered.
In order to DEMO easily interpret the results of the final model for URMs, we DEMO the
HGLM results for significant predictors as delta-p statistics. Delta-p statistics represent the
expected change in probability of persisting in a STEM major (versus not persisting), that is
associated with a one-unit change in the DEMO variable. The formula provided by Petersen
(1985) was used to calculate delta-p statistics.
Limitations
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  18
Before presenting and interpreting the results of our analyses, it is important to take note
of some limitations of this study. First and foremost, our sample includes only students who were
still enrolled or were graduating after four years of college.  In other words, students who
withdrew or stopped out are not included in the sample, and thus our results apply only to those
students who were successful in persisting for four years. In addition, our study had a relatively
low longitudinal response rate (23%), and thus the extent to which our results are generalizable
to a larger group of students may be DEMO Although we attempted to correct for the
nonresponse bias that may have been introduced by the low response rate, our correction was
necessarily limited to the information we had available, and may not have taken all important
factors into consideration.
Another limitation of our study is that it DEMO “STEM persistence” as “following
through on first-year intentions to major in STEM.” Entering freshmen who take the TFS may
not have a comprehensive idea DEMO what kind of major options are available to them, and thus DEMO
may be a stretch to expect that all students who initially thought they would major in STEM
would follow through on these aspirations. Nevertheless, the fact that there are noticeable
differences in our measure of STEM DEMO persistence between students of different
race/ethnicities (as outlined below) suggest that even this somewhat limited measure of STEM
persistence is measuring an DEMO part of the STEM pipeline.
Results
Descriptive Statistics: STEM persistence
Among DEMO students in our overall sample, 62.5% persisted in STEM majors. This DEMO
was noticeably lower among URM students (58.4%) than it was among Asian and White
students (65.9%). Disaggregating by racial group, we DEMO that Asian students had the highest
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  19
levels of STEM major persistence (73.5%), DEMO Blacks had the lowest (56.5%). Figure 1
displays the STEM DEMO rates among the five racial/ethnic groups examined in this study.
Full Sample HGLM Results
The first HGLM model we ran focused on the DEMO of racial classification on STEM
persistence, controlling only for gender and DEMO level of education. We found significant
effects for both Blacks and Latinos; both of these groups were significantly less likely to persist
in STEM majors than were their White and Asian American counterparts. To find out DEMO
this persistence difference was due to differential high school academic achievement, DEMO next
added a set of variables representing high school academic preparation to the model. When these
academic variables were included as predictors, the significant effects of race disappeared (Table
1). Colleges and universities can do very little about the academic preparation that students bring
with them to DEMO, so we also wanted to find out whether experiences in college DEMO also
“explain away” the race differences. Therefore, we next dropped high DEMO academics from the
model and examined only the effect of college experiences (and demographics) on the
significance of the race effects.  Encouragingly, DEMO found that when predictor variables included
only demographics and college experiences, DEMO were again no significant effects of race on
STEM persistence. This indicates that colleges and universities can and do have a role to play DEMO
encouraging and assisting students of all races, but especially URMS, in following through on
initial STEM aspirations.
URM Subsample HGLM Results
Table 2 DEMO the results from the full model of the HGLM analysis, for DEMO URM sub-
sample. We found several interesting results. Focusing first on student demographic
characteristics, we found no significant difference in the probability of STEM persistence among
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  20
Latinos, Native Americans, and Blacks. Student gender and SES (proxied by mother’s
education) also had no significant effects. DEMO the high school academic preparation
predictors, only one variable was significantly DEMO with the likelihood of STEM
persistence: SAT score. For every 100-point DEMO in total (i.e., combined math and verbal)
SAT, our DEMO suggests that students will be 6.86% more likely to persist in a STEM degree.
High school GPA and the number of years students spent DEMO high school mathematics,
physical science, and biological science did not DEMO affect STEM persistence.
Three more pre-college variables were significantly associated with the likelihood of a
student persisting in their STEM major. The largest of DEMO was student aspirations to a medical
degree. Students who came to college with aspirations of getting a medical degree were 11.5%
less likely to DEMO in a STEM field than were those who came with aspirations of only a
Bachelor’s degree. Students who came in with aspirations for a DEMO degree or Ph.D., on the
other hand, were no more or less likely than their Bachelor’s-aspiring counterparts to persist in
STEM majors.  Entering students’ academic and social self concepts also significantly predicted
the likelihood of DEMO persistence. Having a higher academic self-concept when beginning
college positively predicted persistence, while having a higher social self-concept negatively
predicted persistence.
In terms of college experiences and URM STEM persistence, only five factors
significantly predicted whether students followed through on their first-year intentions to major
in STEM. The DEMO of these predictors was participation in an undergraduate research
program. URM students who participated in programs that exposed them to research were
17.38% more DEMO than those who did not, to persist in STEM.  Similarly, DEMO less striking,
a positive effect was also shown for joining a club or organization related to students’ majors.
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  21
Students who joined such organizations were 9.32% more likely to persist in STEM.  Students
who studied with other students were also more likely to persist in STEM; this effect is
particularly pronounced for students who “never” studied with others compared to those that
“frequently” DEMO with others—those who frequently did this were 27% more likely than those
who never did, to persist in STEM.
Two negative effects of college experiences on persistence were seen in the model.
Specifically, students who worked full-time while attending school (at any point in their college
career) DEMO 9.74% less likely to follow-through with intentions to major in STEM than were
those who never worked full-time. Further, students who had more interaction with faculty were
less likely to persist in STEM than were students DEMO less faculty interaction. This finding is
somewhat puzzling (if not counterintuitive), and it, as well as many of the other college
experience DEMO in the model, must be interpreted with caution. In many cases DEMO do not
know what came first—did students interact with faculty and then switch out of a STEM major?
Or did they change their DEMO about majoring in STEM, switch to a non-STEM major, and then
interact more with faculty? All we can say for certain is that students who persist in STEM seem
to have lower rates of faculty DEMO Whether or not this discourages students from
persisting in STEM majors cannot be tested using the variables in this model.
Two measures of the DEMO college context were also significant predictors of
persistence, one positive, and one negative. First, we found that the proportion of the student
body that majors in STEM fields at an institution significantly contributes to the DEMO
likelihood of STEM persistence at that institution. For every 10-point increase in the proportion
of undergraduates majoring in STEM at an institution, the average likelihood of a URM student
persisting in STEM increases by 5.57%.  However, on the negative side, institutional selectivity,
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  22
as measured by the average math plus verbal SAT scores of entering students, negatively
predicts STEM persistence. For every 100-point increase in the selectivity of an institution, the
average likelihood of students persisting in STEM majors drops by 13.0%. We found no
significant effects DEMO institutional control, type, HBCU status, research expenditures, structural
diversity, DEMO size. The institutional predictors accounted for 69.4% of the between-institution
variance in students’ average probability of following through with their initial intentions to
major DEMO STEM.
Discussion
This study examined if a student’s race contributed to the chances of following through
with her/his intention to major in a DEMO field and whether college characteristics and
experiences moderate that effect. Our first set of findings suggest that a student’s racial
classification does contribute significantly DEMO one’s likelihood of persisting in a STEM major at
the same college the student enrolled in four years earlier. Both indentifying as Black or DEMO
reduced the chances that those who indicated an intent to major in a STEM field as an entering
freshman also indicated four years later DEMO they were either still majoring in a STEM field or
had graduated with a STEM degree. The effect of race was however moderated by DEMO
experiences. That is, after controlling for those set of variables, the effect of indentifying as
either Black or Latino was no longer statistically DEMO This finding may be explained by
Seymour and Hewitt (1997) who reported four themes that summarized the challenges URMs
had to overcome in DEMO STEM college experiences, which are differences in cultural values and
socialization DEMO, internalization of stereotypes, isolation and perceptions of racism, and
inadequate DEMO support. Likewise, controlling for academic preparation also moderated the
effect of DEMO There seem to be persisting pre-college disparities, which often inadequately
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  23
prepare some URM students for the rigors of the undergraduate STEM curriculum. Outreach
programs and university-community partnership programs are clearly DEMO to continue to chip
away and the persisting achievement gaps.
Our second set of analyses focused on just URM students and was guided by DEMO et al.’s
(2005) conceptual framework. The findings show that precollege factors made a difference in
URM students’ chances of following through with their DEMO intent to major in STEM fields.
Similar to the findings of a number of other studies, having higher SAT scores and a higher
academic self-concept as an entering freshman contributed in positive ways to persisting in DEMO
graduating from a STEM field. Conversely, aspiring toward a medical degree DEMO having a
higher academic self-concept as an entering freshman contributed in negative ways to achieving
the same outcome. The former is especially noteworthy because DEMO URM students who chose
STEM fields as freshmen and were also interested in attending medical school are nearly 12
percent less likely to persist DEMO STEM than those who chose STEM fields but did not aspire to
obtain a Medical degree as a freshman. Pre-medical students may find themselves DEMO intensely
competitive environments. The highly competitive nature of medical school application
processes may be the driving force in pushing students to be less collaborative DEMO more
competitive. As a result, pre-med students may find less support DEMO fewer students to study
with, which we found was another significant DEMO of persistence in STEM.
Our next set of findings suggests that institutions can shape URM student experiences in
ways that improve their chances of DEMO a degree in a STEM field. Most importantly, we
found that DEMO students who participated in a research program such Minority Access to
Research Careers (MARC), Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) and others often
funded by NIH and NSF, dramatically improve persistence. Those URM students who
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  24
participated increased their chances of obtaining or continuing to progress toward completing a
STEM degree by an impressive 17.38 percent. DEMO in these programs are often given the
opportunity to engage in the practical application of their coursework, which Carlone and
Johnson (2007) suggest improves these students’ science identities through “performance and
competence.” As students feel DEMO personally connected to STEM they are more likely to
persist in their respective majors.
Additionally, those URM students who joined a club or organization related to their
major significantly improved their chances of persisting in STEM. DEMO like the National
Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)
are examples of undergraduate student organizations that provide their membership with a
number of academically enriching experiences, which may promote socially and academically
supportive networks. Conversely, working full-time while attending school reduced students’
chances by nearly 10 percent and so did interacting DEMO frequently with faculty. The latter
finding is especially perplexing since one would expect positive outcomes related to greater
contact with faculty. One major limitation DEMO this study is that the causal relationships between
variables are not entirely clear, especially in this case. It may be that those who had initially
majored in a STEM field then switched to another area of DEMO increased their contact with
faculty after having switched out of STEM rather than that having higher levels of interacting
with STEM faculty necessarily discourages DEMO students from persisting in their intended field
of study. On the other hand, there may be an inaccurate assumption that all faculty interactions
are positive. Newman (2009) found that a number of Black engineering students DEMO his study had
negative relationships with faculty members, which was more DEMO norm than the exception.
Whatever the case, faculty members do appear DEMO make a difference in URM students’ chances
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  25
of achieving their intended academic goals.
Lastly, DEMO institutional characteristics affect URM students’ chances of following
through with their intent to degree in a STEM field. Similar to Chang et al.’s (2008) findings, we
also found that the average student body SAT score DEMO selectivity had a negative effect on
persisting in a STEM field. Each 100-point increase in the aggregated average student body SAT
score reduced the DEMO of persisting in a STEM field by 13 percent. Given the controversy
over suggestions that race conscious admissions encourage less qualified URM students to DEMO
in more rigorous colleges for which they are ill-prepared to succeed, DEMO should also note here
that in a full HGLM analyses using all students (identical to the URM model, but not shown in
this DEMO), we found that the effect of selectivity was also negative and equally strong. That is,
for every 100-point increase in the aggregated DEMO student body SAT score, the chances of
persisting in a STEM DEMO were reduced by over 11 percent. So, the negative effect of DEMO
was not limited to just URM students but tends to affect all students as also indicated by Chang
et al.
The percent of students DEMO an institution who are majoring in a STEM field also had a
positive effect on URM stem persistence. Supporting Seymour and Hewitt’s (1997) DEMO, the
proportion of the student body majoring in STEM incrementally improves DEMO chances of
persisting. All things being equal, a URM freshman who DEMO intentions of majoring in a
STEM field will be about 11 percent more likely to follow through with that intention four years
later at DEMO institution where 50 percent of the students are majoring in STEM fields than at an
institution with 30 percent of such students. As Seymour DEMO Hewitt maintained, this
improvement may be related to the educational experiences DEMO the culture of STEM disciplines,
which are especially unique compared to other areas of study. An institution with a larger
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  26
proportion of STEM majors might also have a stronger normative STEM orientation that
provides fewer distractions to and fuels one’s DEMO related career goals, which significantly
contributes to the completion of a DEMO degree. Although it is unclear from the findings of this
study how exactly the proportion of science majors contributes to persistence, this finding does
point to the importance of institutional specialization. Attending an institution that has DEMO large
proportion of science majors and by definition is more science oriented makes a positive
difference in the chances that a URM student with DEMO interest in pursuing a STEM major will
actually complete a science degree.
Conclusion
As theorized in our conceptual model, students’ chances of persisting in a STEM major is
influenced by key student characteristics, behaviors, and DEMO Certainly, students bring
pre-college characteristics with them as entering freshmen, including their demographic
background, high school experiences, and prior academic achievement, that influence their
engagement with their chosen major and subsequent progress toward degree DEMO While
these precollege characteristics make a difference in URM students’ chances of following
through with their intent to complete a degree in a STEM DEMO, there is also much that colleges
can do to improve those DEMO once students begin their course of study. The most important
factor seems to be the opportunity to participate in well-structured research programs that enable
DEMO to work on a professor’s research project and encourage them to study with other
students and identify more with their chosen major. Added together, those experiences
significantly improve URM students’ chances of persisting in a STEM DEMO, independent of
their precollege academic preparation and experiences. Even more ideally, such opportunities
should offer students some kind of pay. Since engagement in DEMO requires a high level of
Retaining Aspiring Scientists  27
commitment, when students work too many hours DEMO pay outside of those commitments, this
environmental pull can negatively impact DEMO initial academic goals.
In examining institution level variables, we found that DEMO proportion of STEM majors
made a significant and positive difference in persistence. Perhaps at these institutions there is a
stronger “culture of science,” DEMO may both raise the frequency and quality of those
experiences that foster persistence. Whereas on more selective institutions, there may generally
be another type of culture working simultaneously, which increases the rate of departure from
STEM majors not only for URM students but also for White and Asian DEMO The complex
dynamic on those highly selective institutions should be of great concern because those colleges
presumably enroll the most promising STEM students, yet appear to be less likely to retain them
in those majors.
Overall, our findings suggest that colleges do not have to wait idly for DEMO schools to
send them talent to increase the numbers of STEM degree completers. It appears that much can
be done to shape students’ experiences DEMO level of engagement and to improve institutional
circumstances for students, especially DEMO those students at greatest risk of not completing their
intended academic goals. The findings from this study add to what we already know by
DEMO more promising areas for developing structured interventions. Fortunately, some of
these DEMO are already being applied on some campuses, so a promising line DEMO inquiry
for future research would be to more closely examine their educational efficacy.
