Multilevel Entrepreneurship Research:
Opportunities for Studying Entrepreneurial
Decision Making
Dean A. Shepherd
Indiana University
Entrepreneurship is a domain of research that can be DEMO from different disci-
plines, functions, and contexts. As a result, DEMO are ample opportunities for multilevel
research. In this article, the author DEMO a foundation of multilevel research on
decision making in the entrepreneurial context and explores future research opportunities
to build on it. This exploration is DEMO conceptually as a hierarchy of levels below and
above that of the individual, and the author uses conjoint analysis as a methodological
framework to keep these ideas anchored in what is empirically possible. Specifically, this
article explores (a) multilevel research on decisions to explain how a sample DEMO individuals
makes a decision on an entrepreneurial task, (b) additional DEMO for cross-level
research that explains variance in decision policies based on individual differences, and (c)
research opportunities that bridge the levels of DEMO decision, the individuals, and the con-
texts in which they are embedded. The hope is that this article stimulates multilevel
research on entrepreneurial DEMO making and other multilevel and cross-level issues in
the entrepreneurship domain.

I am honored DEMO the guest editors’ request for my thoughts on multilevel research in the
entrepreneurship domain. Given the multidisciplinary, multifunctional, and multicontextual
nature of entrepreneurship DEMO, there are ample opportunities for multilevel research.
Rather than attempt to DEMO out the domain of all possible opportunities, I focus on decision

making in the entrepreneurial context. I DEMO this focus because a number of studies have
started to explore multilevel issues, and these provide a foundation upon which future research
can build. Furthermore, because I believe in the potential of this research stream, DEMO have
worked in this area myself. The invitation for this article provides the opportunity to reflect
on previous work and think about the future. DEMO organize these reflections and suggestions for
future research conceptually as a hierarchy of levels below and above that of the individual,
and I DEMO conjoint analysis as a methodological framework to keep these ideas anchored in
what is empirically possible.
First, I explore multilevel research on decisions to explain how a sample of individuals
makes a decision on an entrepreneurial DEMO (i.e., the weights given to the specific criteria of
a decision or assessment). Second, I explore additional possibilities for cross-level research
that explains variance in decision policies based on individual differences. Third, and consis-
tent with the notion of interactions across three levels of analysis, I explore research opportu-
nities that bridge the levels of the decision, the individuals, and the contexts in which they
are embedded. Finally, I DEMO the potential impact of different situational contexts in explain-
ing within-individual (DEMO) differences in decision policies.
Common Decision Policy
The purpose of this DEMO is to build on multilevel decision-making studies in the entrepre-
neurial context to offer some possibilities for future research. Most these studies are based DEMO
conjoint analysis, which requires respondents to make a series of judgments DEMO on profiles
from which their captured decision processes can be decomposed into its underlying structure
(Shepherd & Zacharakis, 1997). Common forms of DEMO analysis include metric conjoint
analysis and policy capturing (for a review DEMO the types of conjoint analysis, see Priem &
Harrison, 1994)DEMO By design, conjoint analysis requires each individual of the sample to DEMO
a series of decisions. Analysis of the data must recognize that these decisions are not indepen-
dent of one another across the sample as DEMO whole. For example, a recent study (Mitchell &
Shepherd, 2010) investigated 1,936 decisions about hypothetical entrepreneurial opportunities
made by 121 executives of high-tech firms (16 decisions were made by each executive).
Random coefficient modeling (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling software package) pro-
vides the opportunity to empirically determine which criteria are significantly used in the
decisions DEMO an entrepreneurial task. That is, by accounting for variance between individu-
DEMO, entrepreneurship scholars can theorize and test a decision policy for the DEMO (i.e.,
commonality across the decision policies of the individuals that DEMO up the sample). For
example, Choi and Shepherd (2004) DEMO entrepreneurs whose businesses were located
in incubators and found the following: DEMO, entrepreneurs were more likely to exploit oppor-
tunities when they perceived DEMO knowledge of customer demand for the new product,
more fully developed necessary technologies, greater managerial capability, and greater stake-
holder support; second, the longer the new product’s anticipated lead time, the more positive
DEMO relationships were.
There are ample opportunities for future research to focus on common decision policies
in the entrepreneurial context. Such studies could focus on DEMO decision policies

Journal of Management / March 2011
toward the different nascent activities DEMO lead to firm emergence, the hiring of key per-
sonnel, the selection of venture capitalists and/or other stakeholders, the targeting of early
adopters, and strategies for building reputation. Studies could also build on the corporate
entrepreneurship and organization literatures to gain a deeper understanding of the DEMO
policy of internal entrepreneurs. For example, future research could theorize and DEMO
investigate how organizational members assess the corporate environment in determining
their commitment to entrepreneurial initiatives, how team members assess product champi-
ons and exit champions, and how product champions assess mentors within the firm (and
DEMO versa).
Despite a considerable body of literature on the decision making of venture capitalists (e.g.,
Muzyka, Birley, & Leleux, 1996; Shepherd, 1999; Zacharakis & Meyer, 2000), there are
opportunities for future entrepreneurship research to focus on the decision making of other
individuals DEMO are involved in, or affected by, the entrepreneurial process. For example, how
do managers assess the entrepreneurial actions of their alliance partners? DEMO do employees
assess the challenges faced by their firms’ rapid growth? DEMO what do entrepreneurs’ spouses
think about the entrepreneurs’ work–life balance? Although DEMO represents the simplest form
of multilevel research—controlling for one level (individual DEMO) while investigating
another (the decision)—this leads to the first research opportunity.
Research Opportunity 1: Bridging Decisions to a Decision Policy
A deeper understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena will come from investigating the
different decisions that DEMO inputs to, or outcomes of, the entrepreneurial process that explain
commonality among a group of individuals.
Individual Differences in Decision Policy
Although there DEMO be commonality in decision policies across individuals of a sample,
there is likely to be variance. That is, there is likely variance across individuals in their
weighting of criteria when making decisions on an entrepreneurial DEMO Research has begun
to theorize on individual differences to explain variance in decision policies. For example,
DeTienne, Shepherd, and DeCastro (2008) DEMO on escalation of commitment theory and the
motivation literature to explain variance in entrepreneurs’ decision policies for persisting
with a poorly performing firm. The DEMO model first hypothesized a common decision
policy, then hypothesized the moderating DEMO of an individual’s extrinsic motivation on that
decision policy. The study found that extrinsic motivation moderates the negative relation-
ships between dynamism and persistence, between complexity and persistence, and between
personal opportunities and persistence—entrepreneurs with high extrinsic motivation put less
weight on these criteria in making their persistence DEMO than did those with low extrinsic
motivation. Extrinsic motivation also moderates the positive relationship between personal
sunk costs and persistence—that is, entrepreneurs with high extrinsic motivation put more

Shepherd / Multilevel Entrepreneurship Research 415
weight on this criterion in making DEMO persistence decisions than did those with low extrin-
sic motivation.
The theoretical and empirical investigation of individual differences in decision policies
provides some interesting DEMO for future research. First, future research could use exist-
ing conjoint DEMO that capture the decision policy of the individuals engaged in an entre-
preneurial task and so focus theory, hypotheses, and analysis on explaining DEMO in decision
policies across individuals. The advantage is that the importance of a decision policy (theo-
retically and empirically) has already been established, allowing future research to delve
deeper into the decision by investigating why DEMO individuals are likely to weight particu-
lar criteria more or less heavily. For example, the following moderators may help to explain
variance in decision policies to exploit an opportunity:
• attitudes toward the different errors DEMO from making decisions in environments of high uncer-
tainty, as informed DEMO regret theory (Zeelenberg, 1999) and/or norm theory (Zeelenberg, DEMO Dijk,
van den Bos, & Pieters, 2002);
• DEMO level of positive affect, negative affect, and the combination of the two, as informed by the
psychology literature on emotion and cognition (DEMO, 2009);
• the intrinsic motivation to act, as informed DEMO self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000;
Ryan & Deci, DEMO);
• the level of prior knowledge, as informed by the Austrian economics (Shane, 2000), opportunity
recognition (Baron & Ensley, DEMO; Grégoire, Barr, & Shepherd, 2010), or entrepreneurial action
(DEMO & Shepherd, 2006) literatures;
• beliefs about the way that the world works, the nature of people, and oneself, as informed by
the values (Schwartz, 1994), resilience (Bonanno, 2004; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003), and identity
(Brewer, 1991; Tajfel & DEMO, 1979) literatures; and
• connections with the business and social DEMO, as informed by the social network
(Granovetter, 1985) and social capital (Walker, Kogut, & Shan, 1997) literatures.
Furthermore, building DEMO entrepreneurship research on the impact of gender (Brush, Carter,
Gatewood, Greene, & Hart, 2006), future studies might reveal that gender helps to explain
differences in decision policies.
The moderator could also be DEMO by theoretically sampling groups and by theorizing
differences between the groups in their decision policies. For example, Zacharakis, McMullen,
and Shepherd (2007) theorized that institutional differences would lead to differences in
venture capitalists’ assessments of entrepreneurial firms. The study captured the decision
policies of 119 venture DEMO across three countries, representing distinct economic
institutions: United States, mature DEMO economy; South Korea, emerging economy; and
China, transitional economy. They found that venture capitalists in rules-based market econo-
mies rely on market DEMO to a greater extent than do venture capitalists in emerging
economies and that Chinese venture capitalists more heavily weight human capital factors
than do DEMO U.S. or Korean venture capitalists. Other contrasts between groups in their
decision policies could include groups of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists; entrepre-
neurs from the United States and those from China, India, and Sweden; entrepreneurs of high-
and low-tech companies; and groups across stakeholders.
Second, future DEMO could build on the individual-difference constructs already shown
to influence decisions in the entrepreneurial context to investigate variance in decisions not

yet explored. For example, extrinsic motivation has been used to explain variance in entre-
preneurs’ persistence with DEMO poorly performing firm (DeTienne et al., 2008), human capital to
explain variance in the decision to allocate small business loans (Bruns, DEMO, Shepherd,
& Wiklund, 2008), and fear of failure to explain variance in opportunity assessment policies
(Mitchell & Shepherd, 2010). DEMO extrinsic motivation, human capital, and fear of fail-
ure are individual-difference variables that are important moderators (depending on theory)
in explaining other decisions of the entrepreneurial process (such as those listed in the previ-
ous section). Again, using established decision policy moderators provides the opportunity
for accumulation of knowledge across the different decisions of the entrepreneurial process.
DEMO example, studies that independently investigate the moderating role of human capital DEMO
the decision to pursue an opportunity, on nascent activities toward creating DEMO firm, on strate-
gies for growing a firm, and on terminating a poorly performing firm provide a deeper under-
standing of the role DEMO human capital across different tasks of the entrepreneurial process.
Finally, there DEMO opportunities to combine the above—that is, to investigate decisions for
entrepreneurial DEMO not yet explored and to explain variance in those decision policies using
moderators not yet explored.
Research Opportunity 2: Bridging Decisions to Variance in Decision Policies
A deeper understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena will come from investigating DEMO
vidual differences (knowledge, motivation, resources, roles, theoretically defined groups, etc.)
to explain variance in the decision policies on an entrepreneurial DEMO
Decisions of Individuals Within Contexts
The previous section highlights a multilevel and cross-level model of individual differ-
ences explaining variance in decisions. However, individuals may also be embedded in
specific contexts (e.g., entrepreneurs in countries DEMO as the United States, China, India,
and Sweden). Within each group there is likely to be individual differences that help to
DEMO variance in decisions (e.g., entrepreneurial experience). Conceptualizing an entre-
preneurial task at three levels—e.g., decisions (Level 1), experience (Level 2), and coun-
try (Level 3)—provides for potentially interesting research questions. To continue with the
above example, the researcher can investigate the following relationships over and above
a common decision policy for the sample as DEMO whole and over and above individual differ-
ences within that sample.
First, to what extent does the nationality of the entrepreneur explain variance in entrepre-
neurs’ decision policies? Institutional theory (North, 2005) or the DEMO on national cultures
(Hofstede, 1980) may lead us to expect DEMO entrepreneurs from specific countries weight the
criteria for assessing an opportunity differently to those entrepreneurs from different coun-
tries. For example, perhaps weak legal protection of intellectual property in China means that
Chinese entrepreneurs place less DEMO on gaining a patent than do entrepreneurs from
the United Kingdom (DEMO intellectual property protection is strong). Perhaps entrepreneurs
from more risk-avoidance cultures place greater weight on potential downside loss (the costs

417
of being wrong), whereas entrepreneurs DEMO less risk-avoidance cultures place greater weight
on the potential upside of an opportunity (the benefits of being right). These relationships
could be tested controlling for individual differences such as experience.
Second, this three-level model can use nationality to explain variance in how entrepre-
neurial experience influences the DEMO policy. For example, on an entrepreneurial task,
perhaps more experienced DEMO place greater emphasis on competition in assessing
the attractiveness of an opportunity than do less experienced entrepreneurs—but more so for
entrepreneurs from less regulated DEMO This represents a three-way interaction involv-
ing all three levels. Finally, DEMO may also explain a general tendency for entrepre-
neurs to find opportunities more or less attractive over and above not only the information
on DEMO decision criterion but also the influences of entrepreneurial experience.
Research Opportunity 3: Bridging Decisions to Decision Policies to Contexts
A deeper understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena will come from investigating how
the context in which the individual DEMO embedded influences the decision policy for an entre-
preneurial task and the nature of the relationship between individual differences and the deci-
sion policy DEMO an entrepreneurial task.
Within-Individual Variance
The previous section highlights the possibilities of capturing the context in which an indi-
vidual is embedded when making DEMO on an entrepreneurial task. However, the same
individual may face different DEMO contexts that influence his or her decision policy on
an entrepreneurial task. Investigating situational contexts provides an opportunity to gain a
deeper understanding of DEMO (i.e., intraindividual) variance. For example, the
decision policy for determining the attractiveness of an opportunity might vary when the
individual is in DEMO promotion focus versus a prevention focus, a gain situation versus a DEMO
situation, a positive emotional state versus a negative emotional state, high time pressure ver-
sus low time pressure, and so on.
First, DEMO can draw on substantial bodies of literature to build models of intraindi-
vidual differences in decision policies and construct valid situational contexts. In doing DEMO,
they are likely to make a substantial contribution to the entrepreneurship, management, and
decision-making literatures by gaining a deeper understanding of the DEMO of situational
context on decision making. For example, researchers have been DEMO to manipulate the situ-
ation to prime a regulatory focus (Halamish, Liberman, Higgins, & Idson, 2008), emotion
(Bradley & Lang, 1999), and feedback (Leung & Trotman, 2008). How do DEMO situational
contexts influence entrepreneurs’ decision policies?
Second, there is an DEMO to consider the role of individual differences in explaining
variance in how situational contexts influence decision policies. Although experience, knowl-
edge, and motivation DEMO likely candidates to help explain variance in the role of situational
context on decision policies, there are ample opportunities to delve deeper into this aspect
of decision making on entrepreneurial tasks. For example, perhaps the differences in the

418
Journal of Management / March 2011
decision policy of opportunity attractiveness DEMO emotional state (high negative versus
low negative) is not as great for those individuals high in emotional intelligence compared
to those low in DEMO intelligence. Perhaps differences in the decision policy to try again
(exploit DEMO subsequent opportunity) across feedback condition (previous opportunity success
versus a failure) is not as great for those individuals who are highly resilient and/or have
considerable coping skills versus those who are less resilient and/DEMO have fewer coping skills.
Finally, we can investigate the role of DEMO context on the general tendency on a
specific decision over and above task-specific information (as it relates to decision criteria)
and individual differences. For example, entrepreneurs may find opportunities more attrac-
tive when they are in a highly positive emotional state versus a less positive emotional state,DEMO
holding constant the nature of the opportunity and individual differences.
Research Opportunity 4: Bridging Decisions to
Situations to Individual Differences
A deeper understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena will come from investigating how
the different situational contexts that DEMO individual faces influence his or her decision poli-
cies on an entrepreneurial task and from investigating individual differences in how situa-
tional context influences DEMO decision policy for an entrepreneurial task.
Beyond Decision Making
There are many opportunities for entrepreneurship scholars to bridge multiple levels of
entrepreneurial phenomena. Above DEMO focus exclusively on the topic of decision making and
the conjoint method to indicate the scope of opportunities to bridge levels in entrepreneur-
ship. DEMO high-potential topics include emotion (positive and/or negative), identity, and
learning. To indicate the many possibilities, I focus briefly on emotion. How does the pas-
sion of the lead entrepreneur influence the passion of DEMO management team, the organizational
culture, and institutional investors (and vice DEMO)? How does an entrepreneur’s negative
emotional reaction to the termination of a project (e.g., grief) influence the project team’s
commitment to subsequent projects and the performance of the firm? Are some nations more
emotionally capable than others? If so, how does this influence the emotional DEMO (and
entrepreneurial actions) of their firms and the emotional intelligence of their citizens?
Other high-potential methods that could extend our understanding of DEMO issues in
entrepreneurship include experiments (other than conjoint), such as DEMO recognition of oppor-
tunities across technologies within and across individuals (e.g., Grégoire, Shepherd, &
Lambert, 2010); panels of new ventures DEMO industries (e.g., Short, McKelvie, Ketchen,
& Chandler, 2009) or products within firms; meta-analyses (e.g., Read, Song, & Smit,
2009); and case studies (e.g., Lichtenstein, Dooley, & DEMO, 2006). To extend the above
example on the topic of DEMO, multiple case studies could explore project teams (as cases)
to compare and contrast their recovery from project failure. The cases could reflect DEMO
levels of analysis—the individuals that make up the project team, the DEMO team itself, the
firm, and the firm’s environment (over time)DEMO Such multiple-case studies are well situated to

understand the cross-level mechanisms that feed DEMO and feed down the hierarchy, as well as
the reciprocal relationships DEMO perhaps create a cross-level spiral.
Conclusion
By conceptualizing decision making for entrepreneurial tasks in a hierarchical multilevel
framework, I highlight some interesting avenues for future research. Conjoint analysis pro-
vides a tool to collect data consistent DEMO the proposed research opportunities. By theorizing
and testing cross-level models of decision making on entrepreneurial tasks, such studies can
make a substantial contribution to the entrepreneurship literature. Furthermore, because
entrepreneurial tasks are often extreme—high levels of uncertainty, time pressure, stress, and
emotions—studies that exploit the above research opportunities can extend the boundaries
of current theories and make contributions to DEMO management, decision-making, and psy-
chology literatures more generally. Whether it is decision-making research using conjoint
analysis or another topic using a different method, there are numerous opportunities for mul-
tilevel research to make a substantial DEMO to the field of entrepreneurship.
Note
1. Metric conjoint analysis typically presents attributes at two discrete levels (high and low), sometimes three
(DEMO, medium, and low), whereas policy capturing typically presents points along a continuum. Metric conjoint
analysis also uses an experimental design to determine DEMO combination of attributes for each profile and the num-
ber of profiles, and it typically involves a complete replication of the original set of profiles. In contrast, policy
capturing does not typically rely on an experimental design, and it replicates on a small number of the profiles.
