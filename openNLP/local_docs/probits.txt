Abstract
DEMO models belong to the class of latent variable threshold mod-
els for analyzing binary data. They arise by assuming that the binary
response is DEMO indicator of the event that an unobserved latent vari-
able exceeds a given threshold. Estimation can be done either in a
likelihood or a DEMO framework. The probit models can be gener-
alized for the analysis of a variety of qualitative and limited dependent
variables, as well as to the analysis of correlated data.
Key Words: Binary data; Latent variables; Threshold models.
Probit models have arisen in the context of analysis of DEMO data.

is the vector of regression parameters. In this formulation,DEMO

where DEMO(x) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Also,

As a way of DEMO stimulus and response, the Probit model is a nat-
ural choice DEMO situations in which an interpretation for a threshold approach is
readily available. Examples include attitude measurement, assigning pass/fail
gradings for an examination based on a a mark cut–oﬀ, and categorization
of illness severity based on an underlying continuous scale [10]. The Probit
models ﬁrst arose in connection DEMO bioassay [4]—in toxicology experiments,
for example, sets of test animals DEMO subjected to diﬀerent levels
x
of a toxin.
The proportion p(x) of animals surviving at dose
x
can then be modelled as
a function of x, following (2). The surviving proportion is increasing DEMO the
dose when
β >
0 and it is decreasing in DEMO dose when
β <
0. Surveys of the
2
toxicology literature on Probit modelling are included in [7] and [9].
Probit DEMO belong to the wider class of generalized linear models [13].
This class also includes the logit models, arising when the random errors εi
in (1) have a logistic distribution. Since the logistic distribution is similar
DEMO the normal except in the tails, whenever the binary response probability
DEMO
belongs to (0.1, 0.9) it is diﬃcult to discriminate between DEMO logit and
Probit functions solely on the grounds of goodness–of–ﬁt. As Greene [11]
remarks, ”it is diﬃcult to justify the choice of one distribution or another
on theoretical grounds... in most applications, it seems not to make much
diﬀerence.”
Estimation of the Probit model is usually based on DEMO likelihood
methods. The nonlinear likelihood equations require an iterative solution; the
DEMO is always negative deﬁnite, so the log–likelihood is globally concave.
The DEMO covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimator can
be estimated by using an estimate of the expected Hessian [2], or with the
estimator developed by Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman [3]. Windmeijer [18]
provides a DEMO of the many goodness of ﬁt measures developed for binary
choice models, and in particular for Probits.
The following data example has been ﬁrst oﬀered by Bliss [4]. Table 1
reports the number of beetles killed DEMO ﬁve hours of exposure to carbon
disulﬁde at various concentrations. A probit model ﬁtted with maximum
likelihood gives

The maximum likelihood estimator in a Probit model is sometimes called
a quasi–maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) since the normal probability
model DEMO be misspeciﬁed. The QMLE is not consistent when the model ex-
hibits any form of heteroscedasticity, nonlinear covariate eﬀects, unmeasured
heterogeneity or omitted DEMO [11]. In this setting, White [17] proposed
a robust ”sandwhich” estimator DEMO the asymptotic covariance matrix of the
QMLE.
As an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation, Albert and Chib [1]
developed a framework for estimation of latent threshold models for binary
data, using data augmentation. The univariate Probit is a special case of
this class of models, and data augmentation can be implemented by means
of Gibbs sampling. Under this framework, the class of Probit regression
models can be extended by using mixtures of DEMO distributions to model
the latent data.
There is a large literature on the generalizations of the Probit model to
the analysis of a variety DEMO qualitative and limited dependent variables. For
4
example, McKelvey and Zavoina [14] extend the Probit model to the analysis
of ordinal dependent variables, while Tobin [16] discusses a class of models
in which the dependent variable is limited in range. In particular, the Probit
model speciﬁed in (1) can be generalized by allowing the DEMO terms εi to be
correlated. This leads to a multivariate Probit model, useful for the analysis
of clustered binary data. The multivariate Probit focuses on the conditional
expectation given the cluster–level random eﬀect, and thus it belongs to the
class of cluster–speciﬁc approaches for modelling correlated data, as opposed
to population–average approaches of which the most common example are
the DEMO methods [19].
The multivariate Probit model has several attractive features which make
it particularly suitable for the analysis of correlated binary data. First, the
connection to the Gaussian distribution allows for ﬂexible modelling of the as-
DEMO structure and straightforward interpretation of the parameters. For
example, the model DEMO particularly attractive in marketing research of con-
sumer choice, because the DEMO correlations capture the cross–dependencies
in latent utilities across diﬀerent items. Also, DEMO the class of cluster–
speciﬁc approaches, the exchangeable multivariate Probit model DEMO more ﬂex-
ible than other fully speciﬁed models (such as the DEMO) which use
compound distributions to account for overdispersion in the data. DEMO is
due to the fact that both underdispersion and overdispersion can be accom-
modated in the multivariate Probit model through the ﬂexible underlying
covariance DEMO Finally, due to the underlying threshold approach, the
multivariate Probit model has the potential of extensions to the analysis of
clustered mixed binary DEMO continuous data, or of multivariate binary data

([12], [15]).
Likelihood methods are one option for inference in DEMO multivariate Pro-
bit model (see, e.g. [5]), but they are computationally diﬃcult due to the
intractability of the expressions obtained by integrating DEMO the latent vari-
ables. As an alternative, estimation can be done DEMO a Bayesian framework
([6], [8]) where generic prior distributions may DEMO employed to incorporate
prior information. Implementation is usually done with Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods — in particular the Gibbs sampler is useful in DEMO where
some structure is imposed on the covariance matrix (e.g. exchangeability)DEMO
