Explaining how entrepreneurs overcome information asymmetry between themselves
and potential DEMO to obtain financing is an important issue for entrepreneurship
research. Our premise is that economic explanations for venture finance, which do not con-
sider how social ties influence this process, are undersocialized and incomplete. However,
we also argue that organization theoretic arguments, which draw on the concept of social
obligation, are oversocialized. Drawing on the organizational theory literature, DEMO in-depth
fieldwork with 50 high-technology ventures, we examine the effects of DEMO and indirect ties
between entrepreneurs and 202 seed-stage investors on venture finance decisions. We show
that these ties influence the selection of ventures to DEMO through a process of information
transfer.
(Entrepreneurship; Venture Finance; Social DEMO)
Entrepreneurs are often wealth constrained, and need
to obtain external DEMO to pursue their oppor-
tunities, making financing central to the process DEMO
entrepreneurship (Evans and Leighton 1989, Casson
1982). However, the DEMO of opportunities is
fraught with difficulties because entrepreneurs pos-
sess information about themselves and their opportu-
nities that potential financiers do not possess (Amit
et al. 1990, Barry 1994, Chan et al. 1990, Gompers
1995). Thus, financiers face high risks when select-
ing among entrepreneurs because entrepreneurs may
act opportunistically towards them, and because
entrepreneurs vary in their ability to identify and
exploit opportunities.
Given this information asymmetry, how do seed-
stage investors select which ventures to fund? Eco-
nomic explanations generally hold that three mechan-
isms-the allocation of contractual rights, the stag-
ing of capital, and risk shifting-lead entrepreneurs
to self-select and disclose information in ways that

overcome this information asymmetry (Gompers and
Lerner 2000)DEMO In contrast, organizational theorists have
generally proposed that seed-stage investors rely DEMO
social relationships to select which ventures to fund
(e.g., Venkataraman 1997). In particular, organization
scholars have argued that two different mechanisms-
information transfer through social ties and social
obligation-influence investors' decisions.
In this paper, we first review the venture finance
literature to justify our premise that economic
explanations for seed-stage financing decisions are
undersocialized. Second, we integrate in-depth field-
work with 50 high-technology ventures with the orga-
nizational literature to DEMO a socially embed-
ded explanation about how direct and indirect ties
between entrepreneurs and investors influence seed-
stage venture finance decisions. Finally, because qual-
itative research can overstate theoretical processes, we
complement our field interviews with a quantitative
study of 202 seed-stage investors.

Theory Development
Entrepreneurship is the DEMO by which "opportuni-
ties to bring into existence 'future' goods DEMO services
are discovered, created, and exploited" (Venkatara-
man 1997, DEMO 120). Because people possess different
information and beliefs, some individuals DEMO
opportunities that others cannot yet see (Shane 2000).
Thus, idiosyncrasies of information and beliefs are
necessary for opportunities to exist (Kirzner 1973). If
a resource owner held the same beliefs and infor-
mation DEMO an entrepreneur, she would try to cap-
ture the entrepreneurial profit DEMO adjusting the price
of resources to the point where the entrepreneurial
profit would be eliminated (Shane and Venkataraman
2000). Likewise, if other DEMO possessed the
same beliefs and information, competition between
entrepreneurs would eliminate DEMO entrepreneurial
opportunity (Schumpeter 1934).
The Information Asymmetry Problem
The same DEMO beliefs and information that
allow entrepreneurs to discover opportunities for
profit also create information asymmetry between
entrepreneurs and potential investors that make it dif-
DEMO for the entrepreneurs to obtain external financ-
ing. Take, for example, a biotechnology start-up
founded by a university scientist and a Merck sales
DEMO to create a drug to cure hypertension.
The scientist's research has led her to see an opportu-
nity to produce a drug that DEMO reduce hypertension.
Because the scientist has worked on the development
of the drug, she is more knowledgeable than potential
investors about it. For example, her experiments have
shown her that the drug becomes less efficacious as it
is produced in larger volume. Moreover, she has tacit
knowledge about the drug's production because her
experiments have shown that the drug'DEMO performance
varies more when mixed in tall, thin beakers. Simi-
larly, over years of working at Merck, the scientist's
partner has accumulated knowledge that introducing
a hypertension drug is a high priority at Merck.
DEMO information possessed by the two entrepreneurs
creates two problems when they seek financing. First,
the entrepreneurs are reluctant to fully disclose this
information DEMO potential investors because such dis-
closure will make it easier for other people to pursue

the opportunity. At the very least, the information
would allow others to bid for the same financial
resources, and for resource owners to raise their
prices, reducing the potential DEMO entrepreneurial
profit. Therefore, the entrepreneurs are reluctant to
tell potential investors DEMO that they know about the
opportunity, and investors must decide whether DEMO
not to fund the opportunity with less information
than the entrepreneur possesses.
Second, because the entrepreneurs have informa-
tion that the investors lack, DEMO can engage in oppor-
tunistic behavior. All entrepreneurs seeking funding
have psychological and financial incentives to con-
vince investors that their opportunities are impor-
DEMO and that they are entrepreneurial visionaries.
Not only is successful entrepreneurship socially desir-
able, but entrepreneurs who misrepresent their abili-
ties can gain personally by consuming investors' cash
(Cable and Shane 1997) or by exploiting the reputa-
tions of successful investors to gain wealth or social
standing (Sahlman 1990). Finally, opportunistically
inflating the potential of the opportunity and one's
own entrepreneurial talent will ostensibly increase the
probability of funding DEMO to other entrepreneurs.
Thus, the entrepreneurs in our example have incen-
DEMO to withhold the information that the drug that
they have developed is difficult to produce in large
volume without decreased efficacy. Similarly, they
will likely overstate their knowledge of Merck's strat-
egy and the probability DEMO a Merck partnership.
Theoretically, the information asymmetry described
above could make DEMO unwilling to invest in the
specialized assets necessary to develop the new ven-
ture unless the entrepreneur makes large, irreversible,
credible commitments to the venture (Venkatara-
man 1997). Unfortunately, these commitments cre-
ate DEMO market for lemons (Akerlof 1970) by raising
entrepreneurs' sunk costs DEMO driving high-quality
entrepreneurs from the market. Thus, only undesir-
able deals DEMO be available to investors, causing mar-
ket failure when investors abandon DEMO market (Amit
et al. 1990).

from seed-stage investors to start new businesses.
How do entrepreneurs obtain funding to exploit
opportunities when the information asymmetry that
gives rise to the DEMO of opportunity itself
makes financing problematic?
Economists argue that the allocation of contrac-
tual rights, the staging of capital, and risk shift-
DEMO lead entrepreneurs to self-select in ways that
overcome the problems engendered by information
asymmetry (Gompers and Lerner 2000, Kaplan and
Stromberg 1999). DEMO example, Gompers (1997) has
noted that venture capitalists use convertible DEMO
rities and covenants to delay the entrepreneur's
compensation until the outcome of the venture is
revealed. Sahlman (1990) explains that venture capital
DEMO are typically staged, providing the capital-
ist with the right to DEMO if negative information
about the entrepreneur or venture is revealed. Hoff-
man and Blakely (1987) argue that entrepreneurs face
forfeiture provisions that require DEMO to lose shares
if they have below-target performance, and punitive
dilution DEMO, which protect the investor's investment
if the venture underperforms. From DEMO economic
perspective, contract provisions select appropriate
entrepreneurs by shifting the risk DEMO inappropriate
selection to the entrepreneur. As Sahlman (1990, p.
510) DEMO, "it would be foolish for the entrepreneur
to accept these terms if they were not truly confident
of their own abilities and deeply DEMO to the
venture."
The premise of our paper is that these economic
explanations for how investors overcome informa-
tion asymmetry are incomplete for DEMO least two rea-
sons. First, the overoptimism of entrepreneurs has
been DEMO documented (Cooper et al. 1988), and over-
optimism undermines the DEMO of the con-
tractual mechanisms described by economists. While
it might be foolish for untalented entrepreneurs
to accept financing from investors who shift risk
DEMO them, entrepreneurial overconfidence makes self-
selection an ineffective mechanism in this DEMO
Second, early-stage equity investors cannot shift
all of the risk of DEMO in a new venture to
entrepreneurs. Unlike the providers of debt, DEMO can
demand collateral to cover the risk of total failure,
equity investors provide capital beyond the level that
366
can be guaranteed by DEMO venture's assets. As a result,
seed-stage equity investors must make investments
that risk the total loss of their capital. Thus, seed-
stage investors cannot shift risk to entrepreneurs com-
pletely, and must bear some of it themselves.
The Social Embeddedness Solution
Contrary to the asocial economic DEMO, organi-
zational theorists have suggested that investors use
social ties to DEMO the problem of information
asymmetry in venture finance decisions (Venkatara-
man DEMO). Drawing on the concept of embedded-
ness (Granovetter 1985), DEMO scholars argue
that social obligations between connected parties,
and information transfer through social relationships,
influence venture finance decisions. However, prior
research1 on the social embeddedness of new venture
finance does not address two fundamental DEMO
that we examine here: First, do social relationships
operate through information transfer mechanisms,
social obligation, or both? Second, do social relation-
ships influence the probability that entrepreneurs will
receive seed-stage equity investments?
DEMO theoretic explanations for venture
finance decisions often draw upon mechanisms of
social obligation as well as information transfer to
explain how social relationships influence DEMO
finance decisions. For example, Uzzi and Gillespie
(1999, p. 33) argue that social ties "interject expec-
tations of trust and reciprocity into the economic
exchange that, in turn, activate a cooperative logic
of DEMO This logic promotes the transfer of
private information and resources ... and moti-
vates [both parties] to search for integrative rather
than zero-sum outcomes. DEMO this way, embedded
ties both created new collaborative opportunities and
induced DEMO mutual rather than selfish distribution of
rewards." However, if social ties influence the venture
Some studies do not look at investors' decisions to make seed-
stage equity investments in new firms. Larson (1992), for example,
explains that social ties enhance resource acquisition from strate-
gic DEMO partners. However, because the mechanisms by which
investors make equity investment DEMO are different from the
mechanisms by which managers make strategic alliance decisions,
studies of alliance assistance do not provide direct insight into the
DEMO that we explore.

finance decision solely through information DEMO
mechanisms, this type of social obligation explanation
is unparsimonious and oversocialized.
DEMO, most studies that explore the role of
social ties in venture DEMO do not examine the
central issue of investment selection. For example,
Kelly (2000) and Landstrom et al. (1998) examine the
negotiation DEMO a financing agreement once the ven-
ture has been chosen, and DEMO (1992), Sapienza
and Korsgaard (1996), and Steiner and Greenwood
(1995) all explore the post-investment relationship
between investors and entrepreneurs. However, these
studies cannot shed light on how social ties affect
investors' initial decisions to invest. For example,
social relationships might influence entrepreneur-
investor DEMO over time without influencing the
initial decision to finance the venture. Thus, prior
research has not ascertained whether social relation-
ships provide an efficient mechanism for informa-
tion transfer to overcome information asymmetries
between entrepreneurs and DEMO
Finally, prior studies do not explore the role of
social relationships DEMO overcoming information asym-
metry problems in seed-stage venture finance. For
example, DEMO et al. (1999) find that young firms
with social ties to high-status strategic alliance part-
ners perform better than other new firms because
DEMO social ties provide them with attributions of
quality when their actual quality is uncertain. How-
ever, Stuart et al. (1999) examine different issues from
those explored in the present paper because they
(a) focus DEMO firm performance rather than on ven-
ture finance, (b) examine DEMO transfer mechanisms
rather than information transfer mechanisms, and (c)
explore uncertainty rather than information asymme-
try problems.
In the next section, we combine the organization
theory literature with in-depth field work on high-
technology DEMO to develop hypotheses about the
effects of social ties on seed-stage investors' ven-
ture finance decisions. To this end, we conducted
field interviews DEMO individuals involved with 50
companies that were started to exploit Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) inventions. We used
a retrospective design to obtain DEMO on the
seed-stage financing of a random sample of 50 new

For each interview, we tape recorded the conversation
and then worked DEMO tape transcriptions. In total, we
conducted 100 hours of interviews with DEMO individu-
als. In all cases, the minimum informant set included
the DEMO investor and the firm founder.
Social Ties
We define a direct tie as a personal relationship
between a decision maker and the party about DEMO
the decision is being made (Larson 1992). We define
an DEMO tie as a relationship between two individu-
als who are not directly connected but through whom
a connection can be made through a social DEMO
of each party's direct ties (Burt 1987). Direct and DEMO
rect social ties between entrepreneurs and investors
can vary both across entrepreneur-investor dyads (i.e.,
cross-sectionally) and within a given entrepreneur-
investor dyad DEMO time (i.e., longitudinally). In this
study, we focus on DEMO variation in ties. At
the point in time when an entrepreneur seeks financ-
ing from a seed-stage investor, that entrepreneur-
investor dyad has some level of direct and indirect
social ties as a result of prior DEMO For example,
the two parties could have a strong direct tie because
they were roommates in college, or they could be
strangers and have no direct tie at the time financing
is sought. We seek DEMO examine empirically the effect of
variation in the direct and indirect ties across investor-
entrepreneur dyads, at the time the entrepreneur
seeks seed-stage financing, on the investor's decision
whether or not to finance a new venture.2
Direct Ties. Under conditions of uncertainty and
information asymmetry, direct ties can provide an
advantage to people who seek to obtain resources
from DEMO (Podolny 1994). The explanation for this
behavior depends largely on DEMO factors: social obli-
gation and access to private information.
2 This DEMO does not explore how the level of direct and indirect
ties change over time within a venture.

Theoretically, direct social ties between parties
could shift the logic of DEMO transaction from one of
economic behavior to one of social relationship (DEMO
den 1981, Uzzi 1996). Unlike arm's-length transac-
tions, which are governed by norms of self-interest,
social relationships are governed by DEMO of fair-
ness and equity (Granovetter 1985). Moreover, direct
social ties between parties transfer expectations about
people's behavior from a prior DEMO setting to the
new business transaction (Uzzi 1996). By embedding
DEMO transaction in an ongoing social relationship, direct
ties (a) motivate DEMO parties to maintain the rela-
tionship in a fair and trusting manner, and (b) gener-
ate a sense of obligation between the parties, which
causes the parties to behave generously towards each
other (Gulati DEMO). Thus, in the absence of direct
prior social ties, people are more likely to engage
in zero-sum business transactions; in the presence of
direct ties, they shift from the pursuit of self-interest
to the pursuit of mutual gain (Uzzi 1996). Direct social
ties also enhance resource acquisition under condi-
tions of information asymmetry because direct ties
provide DEMO fast mechanism for obtaining private infor-
mation about the quality of people's talents and their
tendency to behave opportunistically (Aldrich and
Zimmer 1986, Gulati and Gargiulo 2000, Uzzi 1996).
Our fieldwork provided some DEMO that
direct ties influence seed-stage investors' deci-
sions to invest in DEMO ventures. While unfunded
entrepreneurs tended not to have direct ties to
investors, funded entrepreneurs were likely to have
those ties prior to starting their companies. As one
entrepreneur explained, "our venture capitalist knew
[ENTREPRENEUR A] DEMO his days as an investment
banker when [ENTREPRENEUR A] had acted as an
advisor and consultant to judge the viability of tech-
nologies. They DEMO very much in touch and formed
a pretty close bond over the years, starting in 1960
and lasting over 30 years."
Many of the investors interviewed also pro-
vided qualitative evidence that direct ties are DEMO
ful, primarily because they provide information about
entrepreneurs' abilities and skills. As one investor
said,
We got to know [ENTREPRENEUR B] in DEMO prior
relationship. This enabled us to learn things about
him and we began to think very highly of him. We
368
decided that he DEMO a person of high integrity, high
intellect, very well educated, DEMO very purposeful.
He had the human qualities that would make him
an excellent partner and the sort of person who was
likely to accomplish DEMO he set out to do in life if he
had the right opportunity and resources behind him.
We told him that if at some DEMO he was ready to
bet his career on a particular project that we would
love to have the chance to at least look at DEMO and
see whether or not it was something we wanted to
back. We started with the person rather than the
product ....
Similarly, another investor explained
One of the founders worked for us the summer
between DEMO first and second year. Everybody in my
company was impressed with him. He's thoughtful,
hardworking, analytical, and impressive. We based
our DEMO to invest on him on his integrity, desire
and drive to DEMO something on his own. I did very lit-
tle checking outside of the data that we asked him to
bring us. We didn't DEMO up any potential customers or
competitors. It would be fair to say that if I had not
known [ENTREPRENEUR C] and had him work DEMO
me prior to coming to me with this business plan, I
DEMO would have invested in this business.
A third investor noted
I had met [ENTREPRENEUR D] in the 1970s when
I got involved in financing DEMO technology start-
ups in Israel. I had funded several companies when
I met [ENTREPRENEUR
ing a company called [COMPANY E]. I ended
up funding DEMO D's] company and
I joined the board. I worked very closely with
[ENTREPRENEUR D] and his staff and we became
close personal friends DEMO I sold my stock when he
left because my relationship was with him person-
ally. We stayed in touch and remained good, close,
personal friends. When he came to the United States,
we started DEMO discuss his ideas for [COMPANY E];
[ENTREPRENEUR D] asked me to be a founding
investor of the company. So I put in some DEMO and
joined the board.
Thus, theoretical arguments from the organizational
literature DEMO with our own field research about
the effects of direct ties suggest the following hypoth-
esis:

direct tie to the entrepreneur than when they do not.

Indirect Ties. Under uncertain conditions, indirect
ties can provide an advantage to people who seek to
obtain DEMO from others. The explanation for this
behavior again depends largely on two factors: social
obligation and access to private information. Several
researchers have suggested that indirect ties transfer
expectations about people's behavior from one rela-
DEMO to another (Uzzi 1996). Sociologists have long
argued that referrals DEMO people in whose judgment
the decision maker has confidence make people more
favorably disposed to the person referred (Blau 1964).
With indirect ties, the go-between transfers behavioral
expectations from the existing relationship to the new
one (Uzzi 1996). In addition, the go-between exploits
a debt DEMO reciprocity owed to him or her, and trans-
fers the credit DEMO the entrepreneur (Uzzi 1996). Since
reciprocity is one of the DEMO social norms present
in all societies (Gouldner 1960), people accumulate
DEMO debts to each other. This norm of reciprocity
suggests that social relations generate obligations to
others that can be cashed in or transferred to DEMO
parties (Coleman 1988).
In addition to creating social obligations, indi-
rect ties enhance resource acquisition because they
improve people's ability to DEMO information about
others. A network of social ties allows people to
obtain information about others with whom they do
not have a direct contact, providing access to more
information than what they could obtain alone (Burt
1997). "The network becomes an important screening
device. It is an army of people processing informa-
tion who can call your attention to DEMO bits-keeping
you up-to-date on developing opportunities, warning
you of impending disasters" (Burt 1992, p. 14). Thus,
networking, or the creation and maintenance of ties
to information flows, enhances one's ability to obtain
nonpublic information (Nohria 1992).
Indirect ties also reduce the cost of obtaining
information. Information is costly to acquire because
it requires human DEMO, a scarce commodity
(Coleman 1988). Indirect ties thus lower information-
gathering costs because "social relations, often estab-
lished for other purposes, constitute information
channels that reduce the amount of time and invest-
ment DEMO to gather information" (Nahapiet and
MANAGEMENT SCIENCE/Vol.

AND CABLE

Ventures
Ghoshal 1998, p. 252). Clearly, speed of informa-
tion transfer is advantageous in settings like ven-
ture finance where information has a short half-life.
Referrals DEMO indirect ties also provide information
about qualities that the decision maker finds hard to
observe, such as competence. As a result, indirect ties
DEMO the quality of applicants by helping to screen
out unqualified individuals (DEMO and Weinberg
1997).
Our fieldwork supports arguments derived from
organization theory because indirect ties appeared
to influence seed-stage investors' decisions to
invest in new ventures. Interviews suggested that
entrepreneurs who were not successful in obtaining
DEMO were outside of the financiers' social net-
works. For example, one semiconductor entrepreneur
explained
We weren't from the investors' community. We were
just three engineers. We presented our business plan
at the MIT Enterprise DEMO and the Technology Cap-
ital Network and met some angels and venture capi-
talists. We talked to one or two of them at length DEMO
we never struck a deal, even though some of them
thought DEMO our business was interesting.
Conversely, entrepreneurs who successfully obtained
financing often DEMO money from investors who
made use of their social networks to obtain private
information about the entrepreneurs. One investor
said
[ENTREPRENEUR F] ... was DEMO controversial fig-
ure at the time he approached us for money and we
needed to know if he was any good. The trick to
DEMO an answer is to get off the reference list and
get to people we know who also intimately know
the person in question so DEMO we will get an unbi-
ased reference. We did that with [PERSON G]. There
were few people in [PERSON G's] position. He was
DEMO [COMPANY H's] executive compensation commit-
tee for the board and really knew what was happen-
ing on the inside.... Since [PERSON G] was DEMO
on another company's board with one of my part-
ners we knew him and could ask him things about
[ENTREPRENEUR F] that other DEMO could not ask.
We made our investment largely because of [PER-
SON G]. We figured that he had better information
than us on [ENTREPRENEUR DEMO and if he believed
in [ENTREPRENEUR F], then we should too.

A third investor explained
Clearly I had a bias for anyone inside of MIT. Once
I step outside of the MIT family ... it DEMO harder for
me to do due diligence. ... I did not know if they
are legitimate. Inside of MIT,
chairman if I don'DEMO know the person personally. So
it's very easy to make a couple of phone calls to find
out about someone.
The field research DEMO provided some evidence that
indirect ties were valuable because referrals provided
investors with information about the entrepreneurs.
An Internet entrepreneur explains the information
transfer DEMO underlying referrals:
Venture capitalists will make this bet with people they
had invested in the past who have already made them
tens of DEMO of dollars, but we were a guy who has
never started DEMO company before and two MIT under-
graduates. Most venture capitalists are not going to
take that gamble. Our investor did it because of his
DEMO of people who knew me. This is what led
them to write a check for $500,000. At the end of the
day it DEMO because of the reference that I was paid
attention to.
Investors confirmed the information value of refer-
rals. As one investor explained:
We DEMO heavily influenced by her high opinion of
[ENTREPRENEUR I] because we have a lot of confi-
dence in her judgement based on our prior DEMO
ship with the licensing office and with [PERSON
particular. We had done several deals with her before.
She is an extremely well-known person and DEMO com-
petency in these matters is widely recognized.
Perhaps the strongest evidence for the referral pro-
cess comes from entrepreneurs who started without
referrals, but then shifted to using referrals over time.
As one software entrepreneur DEMO,
When we first sought financing, I looked for ven-
ture DEMO on my own. I pitched the idea to some
very good venture capital firms, but I did not get
any investment. I don't think I had credibility with
them ... That's when I asked DEMO attorney for some
introductions. Then we received funding from two
venture capital firms that our attorney introduced us
to. Since he was a lawyer DEMO Testa Hurwitz, he had a
large number of venture clients. People DEMO he was a

The Mediating Role of Reputation
As described above, two basic mechanisms have been
proposed to explain why social ties might provide
an advantage to people who seek to obtain resources
from DEMO in situations of information asymmetry
(Podolny 1994). First, social ties may provide decision
makers with access to private information about the
actors DEMO their opportunities, which allows them to
remove some ambiguity from the DEMO (Burt 1992).
Second, direct and indirect ties between parties may
create social obligations between the parties, which
cause them to behave generously towards each other
(Gulati 1995).
Interestingly, these two mechanisms provide DEMO
different theoretical rationales regarding how social
ties may influence investors' decisions. DEMO,
the "access to private information" rationale is con-
sistent with a self-interested perspective, in which
investors exploit their social relationships to locate
better investments. The "social obligation" rationale,
on the other hand, provides a far more socialized
view of investors' decision making, such DEMO invest-
ment decisions depend, in part, on the relation-
ships themselves, rather than competence-based cri-
teria. Given the differences between these rationales,
an understanding of why social ties influence ven-
ture finance decisions is DEMO Unfortunately, to
date, research on the effect of social ties on venture
finance decision making has explored the effects of
information transfer and DEMO obligation collectively.
Consequently, it is difficult to determine whether the
effect DEMO social ties on these decisions exist because
those ties motivate information transfer, because they
motivate social obligation, or both.
To disentangle the "access to private information"
and "social obligation" explanations for why social
DEMO affect seed-stage investment decisions, we invoke
the concept of the entrepreneurs' reputation. Repu-
tation is defined as information about an individ-
ual's DEMO performance (Podolny 1994). Because the

entrepreneur's reputation provides information about
his or her ability to DEMO the venture, investors
should be more likely to fund opportunities proposed
DEMO entrepreneurs with positive reputations.
Reputation can help to disentangle the effects of
social obligation and information access in venture
finance decisions. To the extent DEMO social ties are
used only to gather information, and not to DEMO
transactions with norms of social obligation, reputa-
tion should mediate the DEMO of direct and indirect
ties on the venture finance decision. That is, if infor-
mation about the quality of an entrepreneur is already
publicly available from his or her reputation, then
efforts to obtain private information about the indi-
vidual's competence gathered via social ties will pro-
DEMO relatively little additional value to the investor.
In contrast, if social DEMO also generate obligations
that mitigate self-interested behavior and imbue a
transaction with norms of social relationships, then
social ties should affect the probability of venture
finance even after the informational benefits of repu-
tation have been DEMO Thus, to the extent that
social ties continue to predict investment DEMO
after reputation is accounted for, evidence would exist
for the "social obligation" rationale of why social ties
matter to venture finance decisions.
Although the existing research literature provides
arguments for both the social obligation and DEMO
mation transfer benefits of social ties, our field-
work strongly suggested DEMO the primary mechanism
through which social ties operate in venture finance
is information transfer. As a result, we predict that
information about the entrepreneur's reputation will
mediate the effects of social ties on venture finance
DEMO Thus, based on existing theory and our
field research, we hypothesize:
HYPOTHESIS 3A. The reputation of an entrepreneur
mediates the effect of DEMO ties, such that the effect of direct
ties on investment decisions DEMO removed when reputation is
included.
HYPOTHESIS 3B. The reputation of an entrepreneur
mediates the effect of indirect ties, such that the effect of

Methodology
Sample and Procedure
First, we surveyed the population of U.S. seed-stage
venture capitalists in 1998 about DEMO most recent
seed-stage investments they evaluated.3 We randomly
divided the sample into two groups. The first sub-
group was asked about the most recent DEMO
investment that they evaluated and made. The second
subgroup was asked about the most recent seed-stage
investment that they evaluated, but did not make.
The population of venture capitalists, identified
from Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources, the indus-
try directory, consisted of 566 individuals listed DEMO
the 1997 and 1998 directories who indicated that
they make seed-stage investments; 136 individuals
responded, resulting in a response rate of 24%. The
DEMO had an average of 17 years of investment
experience, and had DEMO made an average of
12 seed-stage investments. The average size of their
seed-stage investments was $949,317.
To examine the representativeness of our sample,DEMO
we compared respondents with nonrespondents in
terms of their firm, geographic DEMO, and the
types of investments that they make. No statistically
significant DEMO emerged on these dimensions,
suggesting that the respondents were representative
of the population of seed-stage venture capitalists
operating in the United States at DEMO time of the
survey.
To improve the generalizability of our sample, DEMO
also surveyed two groups of business angels, or indi-
viduals who DEMO in new ventures outside of the
3A seed-stage investment is the initial stage in the financing of a
new firm. It consists of "a small amount of capital provided to an
inventor or entrepreneur to determine DEMO an idea is worthy of
further consideration and further investment. The idea may involve
a technology or it may be an idea for a DEMO marketing approach. If
it is a technology, this stage may involve DEMO a small prototype.
This stage does not involve production for sale" (Sahlman 1990,
p. 479).

legal structure of a venture capital limited partner-
ship. Since business angels are not listed in any direc-
tories, no information on the population exists, mak-
ing it impossible to randomly sample them. Therefore,
we sampled the largest and most well-known angel
groups. The first group, called the Band of Angels,
consists of 123 individual investors in DEMO Val-
ley. This is a high-profile group, having been fea-
tured DEMO The New York Times and a Harvard Business
School case for investment in several major technol-
ogy new ventures. Our response rate from this DEMO
was 27%. The second group of angels consisted of
128 investors who were members of the Technology
Capital Network (a Boston-area angel group), the old-
est and largest group of angels on the East Coast DEMO
the United States. Our response rate from this group
was 26%. The angels had an average of 13 years of
investment experience. They had DEMO made an
average of 13 seed-stage venture capital investments,
and the average size of their seed-stage investments
was $362,550.
In the case DEMO both angel groups, we could not
obtain the lists of investors DEMO (the orga-
nizations protect the identities of their members).
Rather, the organizations agreed to participate and
mail prepackaged surveys, cover letters, DEMO response
envelopes to their members on our behalf. Again, we
randomly DEMO the groups into two parts. The first
subgroup was asked about the most recent seed-stage
investment that they evaluated and made. The second
subgroup DEMO asked about the most recent seed-stage
investment that they evaluated, but DEMO not make. We
pooled the angels and the venture capitalists in our
data because (a) we found no significant effects for a
dummy DEMO representing angel investors in our
regression analysis, (b) we did DEMO find any significant
interaction effects between angel investor status and
the social tie measures when predicting finance deci-
sions, and (c) we found no substantive differences in
our results when we examine the data for DEMO venture
capitalists alone.
Measures
Investment Decision. The dependent variable was
a binary variable of one if the investment was made
and zero if the DEMO was not made.
Social Ties. Unlike previous research that mea-
sured social ties through archival variables that do
not allow differentiation between the constructs DEMO
reputation and social ties, we measure social ties
directly. The social DEMO variables were multi-item,
evenly weighted scales, and individuals responded to
DEMO Likert scale items ranging from 1 = strongly
disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Each scale was cal-
culated by adding together the values DEMO the items
that composed the scale and dividing by the number
of items. The items were derived from prior ethno-
graphic and archival research DEMO different dimensions
of social ties (e.g., Podolny and Stuart 1995, DEMO 1996,
Burt 1992, Larson 1992) and our field interviews.
The indirect tie scale was composed of four ques-
tions about indirect ties DEMO the investors and the
venture team prior to the investment decision (DEMO
bach's alpha = 0.75). These items were: "Someone
whom I trust to discuss important confidential mat-
ters knew at least one DEMO of the venture team";
"A third party whose judgement I trust provided
me with nonpublic information about the venture
team"; "I could obtain information about the ven-
ture team from my network of DEMO faster than
other investors could obtain the same information";
"By calling people I know, I could obtain information
about the venture team in a relatively inexpensive
manner".
The direct tie scale was composed DEMO three ques-
tions about direct ties between the investors and the
venture team prior to the investment decision (Cron-
bach's alpha = 0.78). The items were: "Prior to seeing
the deal, I had a professional relationship with at least
one venture team member"; "Prior to seeing the deal,
at least one member of the venture DEMO was someone
with whom I had engaged in informal social activity
(DEMO, playing tennis, going to the movies)"; "Prior to
seeing the deal, at least one member of the venture
team was a personal friend".
Reputation. The reputation scale was composed
of three questions DEMO the members of the ven-
ture team's reputation as entrepreneurs (DEMO's
alpha = 0.71). The items were: "Someone on the ven-
ture team had a reputation for successfully build-
ing public companies"; "A third party I respected
vouched for the team's ability DEMO start a successful

company"; "At least one venture team member is
viewed by DEMO investors as giving the venture cred-
ibility". These items were derived from prior ethno-
graphic and archival research on different dimensions
of reputation (e.g., Podolny and Stuart 1995, Uzzi
1996). The reputation scale DEMO evenly weighted
based on individual responses to questions adminis-
tered on a five-point Likert scale items ranging from
1 = strongly disagree to 5 DEMO strongly agree.
Control Variables. To provide more accurate esti-
mates of our hypothesized variables, we controlled
for other factors that previous research has found to
be important in explaining venture finance decisions.
We used a dummy DEMO to control for whether
or not the investor was an angel investor because
our sampling process was different for angels and
venture capitalists. We DEMO controlled for industry
because prior research shows that venture capitalists
and angel investors favor certain industries for early-
stage investments (Haar et al. 1988). To control for
industry, we employed a series of dummy variables
for biotech, hardware, medical, Internet, software,
and telecom industries.4
DEMO addition, we controlled for several dimensions of
the quality of venture DEMO presented to the
investors by the entrepreneurs. Thus, we controlled
for DEMO venture's expected market size by measuring
the dollar value of the U.S. market for the business
for the current year as stated in DEMO business plan
because MacMillan et al. (1985) and Hall and Hofer
(1993) have shown that the size of the market influ-
ences DEMO' decisions. We also controlled for the
attractiveness of the business opportunity DEMO mea-
suring the forecasted dollar value of earnings before
interest and taxes of the venture (EBIT) in Year 5 as
stated in the DEMO plan because previous research
has shown that the magnitude of the opportunity
influences investors' decisions (Tyebjee and Bruno
1984). Likewise, we controlled for the dollar amount
of the investment request because the magnitude of
DEMO investment influences investor decisions (Tyebjee
and Bruno 1984, Wetzel 1987).

SCIENCE/DEMO 48, No. 3, March 2002
Two final dimensions of ventures that past research
suggested should be controlled for are investors' per-
ceptions of the technology (Haar et al. 1988, Roberts
1991) and the perceived quality of the business plan
(MacMillan and Subbanarasimha 1987, Roberts 1991)DEMO
Thus, we measured the perceived value of the tech-
nology with DEMO scale composed of two items regard-
ing the value of the venture's technology (Cronbach's
alpha = 0.86). The items were: "The technology
employed by the venture would provide a signifi-
cant competitive DEMO"; "The venture's technol-
ogy had a strong proprietary position"DEMO We measured
perceived quality of the business plan with a two-
item scale (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92): "The business
plan was DEMO in its coverage of key issues"; "The
business plan did DEMO excellent job of articulating the
opportunity".
We also controlled for several attributes of the
investors making the decision. We controlled for
the number DEMO prior seed-stage investments made
by the inventor because Elango et al. (DEMO) found
that investors with significant seed-stage experience
made different decisions from DEMO with little seed-
stage experience. We controlled for the number of
years that individuals have invested in start-ups
because Lerner (1994) found that DEMO experienced
investors approach the investment process differ-
ently from less-experienced investors. Finally, we
controlled for investor gender because Sapienza and
Gupta (1994) and Sapienza and Timmons (1989)
found that relational demography influenced venture
investors' decisions, and the pool of potential high-
tech entrepreneurs is predominantly DEMO
Results
First, to examine how well our survey questions
mapped onto DEMO intended constructs, we used
LISREL 8 to conduct a confirmatory factor DEMO
of the measurement model associated with the Likert
scale items in our study (J6reskog and S6rbom 1996).
A goodness-of-fit index at or above 0.90, and a root
mean-squared error of approximation of below 0.08,
is believed to indicate acceptable fit (Browne and
Cudeck 1993, Medsker DEMO al. 1994). Results indicated
that our model fit the data very well, as indicated
373

Ventures
by a comparative fit index of 0.95, an incremental fit
DEMO of 0.95, and a root mean-squared error approxi-
mation of 0.062. DEMO also estimated alternative models
to examine whether a model with fewer constructs
fit the data better. We found that (a) models with
fewer DEMO had a worse fit with the data than
the model with the five constructs we anticipated,
(b) no single higher-order construct emerged DEMO
the five constructs or any combination of them, and
(c) DEMO of the scales had superior reliabilities if any
of the items were removed. Finally, we estimated a
final confirmatory factor analysis where we focused
on the factor structure of only the theoretical predic-
tors (reputation, DEMO ties, and direct ties), exclud-
ing the technology and business DEMO items. The fit
of this confirmatory factor analysis also was high
(DEMO indexes above 0.91), and the factor loadings were
clean (specifically, the average on-factor loading was
0.70, while the average off-factor loading was 0.11). In
general, these results support the construct validity of
our measures.
Investment Decision
We now turn to the analyses of the investment DEMO
sion. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics and cor-
relation matrix. The business plan and technology
scales have means around the midpoint of the DEMO,
most likely because our sample was evenly weighted
among investments made and investments not made.
Thus, on average, investors find the plans DEMO com-
petitive advantages presented by entrepreneurs to be
average, lending some DEMO to the design of our
study.
Table 2 provides the results of the logistic regres-
sion predicting the investment decision as a func-
tion DEMO the social tie dimensions, controlling for
other factors. Model 1 is DEMO base model, includ-
ing the four measures of the attributes of DEMO inven-
tors (angel, gender, prior deals, and experience), the
four measures of opportunity (market size, Earn-
ings Before Interest and DEMO (EBIT) in Year five,
business plan, technology); the DEMO of investment
request; and industry dummies (biotech, hardware
Internet, medical, software, and telecom industries).
The results indicate that among the DEMO vari-
ables, four variables significantly predicted the deci-
sion to fund DEMO venture opportunity: the business plan
374
(Exp(B) = 2.06, p < 0.0001), the technology (Exp(B) =
2.21, p < 0.0001), the amount of the funding request
(Exp(B) DEMO 1.00, p < 0.05), and the dummy variable
for the DEMO industry (Exp(B) = 4.76,
p <0.05).
The DEMO variables provide some important
insight about entrepreneurial activity. As prior
research has predicted, venture funding is more likely
when entrepreneurs have better business plans and
technology that provides a strong and proprietary
competitive advantage. Moreover, results showed that
the greater the amount of money requested, the lower
the likelihood of funding.
Several results for the control variables provide
an interesting DEMO to previous research. Past
research on entrepreneurial finance indicates that
investors prefer to fund more profitable opportuni-
ties in bigger markets (MacMillan et al. 1985, Hall
and Hofer 1993). Our results suggest that investors
do not prefer to fund opportunities that entrepreneurs
claim are more profitable opportunities DEMO larger mar-
kets. This finding is perhaps not surprising, given
that DEMO face no cost to opportunistically
present their business opportunities as financially
desirable. Moreover, overoptimism (Cooper et al.
1988) leads entrepreneurs to express unrealistic expec-
tations about their ventures. Therefore, entrepreneurs'
claims about the value of their opportunities as stated
in their business plans do not influence DEMO'
decisions.
Models 2 and 3 show the individual effects of
direct and indirect social ties. Each of these vari-
ables has a significant DEMO on the venture finance
decision. Model 2 shows that direct ties are strongly
and positively related to the probability of investment
(Exp(B) DEMO 1.48, p < 0.05). The addition of the direct
tie DEMO also significantly improves the model's fit
(chi-square of change = DEMO, p < 0.05).
Model 3 indicates that indirect ties also DEMO
positively related to the probability of investment
(Exp(B) = 1.66, p < 0.001). The addition of the indirect
tie measure to the base model significantly improves
the fit of the prediction of which DEMO are
financed (chi-square of change = 6.05, p < 0.05).
Model 4 examines both types of social ties simul-
taneously. The model DEMO that the effects of direct

ties (Exp(B) = 1.30, p > 0.10) are mitigated when indi-
rect ties (Exp(B) = 1.51, p < 0.05) are measured. These
results suggest that while direct ties may encour-
age investments, they are superceded by informa-
tion from indirect sources. Thus, DEMO 1 is
supported, but Hypothesis 2 is not supported. How-
ever, taken together, the results support organiza-
tional theoretic arguments that social relationships
influence investors' decisions about which ventures to
finance.
Model 5 examines the role of reputation, and thus
offers more direct evidence about whether social ties
are valuable because they provide a mechanism for
information transfer, because they imbue transac-
tions with norms of social obligation, or both. Our
results support Hypotheses 3a and 3b, suggesting
that social ties operate primarily as a mechanism
for information transfer. Model 5 reveals that when
entrepreneurs' reputations are considered (Exp(B)=
1.77, p < 0.001), DEMO effects of indirect ties (Exp(B) =
1.35, p > DEMO) and direct ties (Exp(B) = 1.12, p > 0.10)
are mitigated. In general, these results suggest that
once information is publicly available about the qual-
ity of an entrepreneur, social ties no longer influence
the investment decision.
It also is possible that direct and DEMO ties have
multiplicative effects with reputation on the proba-
bility of venture finance rather than additive effects.
We explored whether interactions between direct and
DEMO ties, between direct ties and reputation, and
between indirect ties and reputation have any signif-
icant effect on the probability of venture finance. DEMO
found no significant effects for any of the interactions,
suggesting that the effects of direct and indirect ties
have neither additive effects nor DEMO effects
on the probability of venture finance once reputation
is considered.
Discussion
Our study was based on the premise that eco-
nomic explanations for DEMO finance decisions are
incomplete and undersocialized, and that social ties
provide DEMO important mechanism through which
information asymmetry is overcome in venture
finance. Since both our qualitative and quantita-
tive results show that social ties influence DEMO
MANAGEMENT SCIENCE/Vol.
48, No. 3, March 2002
finance decisions, DEMO received general support for our
premise.
However, our results also suggested DEMO organiza-
tional theoretic explanations for the role of social rela-
tionships in venture finance are unparsimonious and
oversocialized. The literature to date has relied DEMO two
very different theoretical mechanisms to explain why
social ties should matter: access to private informa-
tion and social obligations. We examined the extent to
which these two mechanisms are operative by incor-
porating the concept DEMO reputation. Our data suggest
that reputation mediates the effects of social ties, indi-
cating that investors exploit their social ties to gather
private information, but does not support the argu-
ment that investors make investment decisions based
on social obligations.
These results are important because they promote
a DEMO (1934) perspective on entrepreneur-
ship. Knight (1921) and Schumpeter (DEMO) disagreed
on whether individuals could easily obtain financ-
ing to pursue DEMO business opportunities. Schum-
peter (1934) believed that if individuals perceived
viable opportunities, others would provide resources.
Knight (1921), on the other DEMO, presaged the mod-
ern finance literature when he emphasized the infor-
DEMO asymmetry problem in venture finance. Given
information asymmetry, Knight argued that DEMO pur-
suit of opportunity involved the joint possession
of capital and entrepreneurial insight. Evans and
Jovanovic (1989) tested these alternative explanations
and found DEMO liquidity constraint that prevents people
from becoming entrepreneurs. Not considering the
role of social relationships, they used this evidence
to "reject Schumpeter in DEMO of Knight" (Evans and
Jovanovic 1989, p. 810). Results DEMO our study indi-
cate that such a rejection may be premature. Since
social relationships are used to overcome market fail-
ure in venture finance, entrepreneurship does not
require the perception of an opportunity and the pos-
DEMO of financial capital.
Our results also have important implications for the
interpretation of prior research on venture finance.
For example, Fried and Hisrich (DEMO, p. 31) found
that "while VCs receive many deals 'cold' (without
any introduction), they rarely invest in them. ... Most
DEMO proposals come by referral." Although we
377
SHANE AND CABLE
Network
Ties, Reputation,
and the Financing of New Ventures
agree with this descriptive finding, our results sug-
gest a particular normative interpretation. The reason
why most funded proposals come by referral is DEMO
the referral provides information. If, however, infor-
mation is already publicly available, the entrepreneur
will not need a referral to obtain financing.
Although prior research has examined some aspects
of the questions that we discuss (e.g., Freear et al.
1994, Haar et al. 1988), methodological DEMO
such as sample selection biases, averaging effects,
and univariate testing DEMO limited the acceptance of
their findings. Our study provides several important
methodological advances. For example, we surveyed
a representative sample of active investors about
the most recent investments they evaluated. Accord-
ingly, we were able to minimize retrospective ratio-
nalization and the averaging effect that has hindered
past DEMO, where respondents report their general
approach to investing. Moreover, using direct survey
measures rather than proxies permitted us to differ-
entiate between effects DEMO social obligation and infor-
mation transfer on venture finance decision making.
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. First, we
assumed that social contacts would provide infor-
mation about entrepreneurs, and that more infor-
mation would make investors more likely to invest.
This assumption is tenable because investors DEMO
that every entrepreneur has both strengths and
weaknesses, and that more DEMO about both
strengths and weaknesses should make the investor
more likely to invest. Although this assumption is
consistent with the "mere exposure" (e.g., Zajonc
1968) and the "consideration set" (e.g., Tybout and
DEMO 1994) literatures in social psychology, it would
be interesting for future research to examine both the
amount and the favorableness of information gleaned
DEMO social contacts about an entrepreneur. Informa-
tion about the favorableness of the information would
allow more specific tests of how a social network
operates, and would allow researchers to examine
whether social contacts help or penalize DEMO
gifted entrepreneurs who experience early bad luck
and receive sullied reputations.
378
Second, we asked investors to report about past
decisions. As a result, our results might have been
affected by retrospective recall bias (e.g., Golden
1992). In addition, the decision to invest may involve
post-hoc justification. All else being equal, it is possi-
ble that higher reputation ratings would be given by
those who decided to invest than those DEMO did not
as a way of justifying decisions. However, Miller et DEMO
(1997) found that retrospective reporting is a viable
research methodology if the measures used to gener-
ate the reports are adequately reliable and DEMO In
this study, we demonstrated the reliability of our mea-
sures DEMO confirmatory factor analysis, and we max-
imized the validity of our DEMO by asking investors
about the most recent funding decision that they made.
Because our respondents make investment decisions
on an ongoing basis, they were reporting about a deci-
sion that likely occurred no more than three DEMO
prior to answering our survey.5 This approach mini-
mizes the risk of retrospective recall bias because the
ventures they described should have changed very
DEMO after the investment decision but before complet-
ing our survey. Nevertheless, DEMO research should
examine how changes in venture performance alter
the way that investors report the reasons for their
investment.
Third, our study examined only seed-stage invest-
ments made by venture capitalists and business
angels. Consequently, we can generalize the effects of
social ties on financing decisions only to DEMO invest-
ments for which these sources of capital are used.
Because venture capitalists and business angels gen-
erally invest in high-technology businesses that are
DEMO uncertain, one potential boundary condition
for our findings is the uncertainty DEMO the opportunity.
Future research is necessary to know if social ties are
equally important to investment decisions about less
uncertain opportunities (e.g., a DEMO outlet).6
5 Because investors decide not to invest in approximately 10 times
as many ventures as they decide to invest in, the decision-to-invest
group was asked to recall a decision that occurred, on average,
ten months before, whereas the decision not-to-invest group was
recalling a decision that occurred approximately one month before.

Fourth, the implications of our results are limited to
explaining the DEMO decision to invest in a new ven-
ture. While our results indicate that social obligations
are not an important factor in investment decisions,
DEMO cannot conclude that they do not influence other
aspects of the venture finance process. The presence of
direct and indirect ties is a good, but imperfect proxy
for social obligations. In addition, investors might
become influenced by social obligations that develop
over time within a venture (Sapienza and Koresgaard
1996, Steiner and Greenwood 1995). Future research
is necessary to explore different mechanisms through
which social ties influence other aspects of venture
DEMO before researchers can conclude that infor-
mation transfer is the central mechanism in venture
finance.
Future Directions
Because this study examined only U.S. investments,DEMO
future research should consider the extent to which
our explanation is universal or is linked to societal
context, as Zucker (1986) has argued. Although social
ties are important to overcoming problems of market
failure in DEMO pursuit of new business opportunities,
there may be interactive effects between social ties
and institutional context. The use of social ties might
vary DEMO economies or sociocultural contexts. Pos-
sible approaches to researching this question include
cross-national comparisons of new venture financing
in different institutional settings, and experimental
studies designed to manipulate financing decisions in
simulations of firm creation.
Another DEMO boundary condition is newness of
industry, which is directly related to DEMO inability to
judge competence among transactors. In the context
of imitative entrepreneurship, for example, social ties
may be less valuable than in the DEMO of new indus-
try creation because information problems are less
severe. This suggestion is consistent with Aldrich and
Fiol (1994), who identified the importance of social
ties to new organizational forms that result from the
DEMO of new industries. Future researchers could
follow this research stream to examine the relative
value of social ties in new versus mature industries.
This DEMO also suggests an important avenue for
research on new venture legitimacy. Although the
MANAGEMENT SCIENCE/Vol.
48, No. 3, March 2002
relationship between DEMO ties and legitimacy is
most directly related to new venture uncertainty
rather than information asymmetry, our results sug-
gest some ideas for how new firms gain legitimacy.
Specifically, social ties might lead newly financed
firms to possess different endowments of social cap-
ital (Shane and Stuart 2002). Because social capital
can be exploited to generate legitimacy, this varia-
tion in social capital endowment might generate vari-
ation in legitimacy that influences DEMO firm perfor-
mance (Stuart et al. 1999). Thus, while population
ecologists imply that organization and industry char-
acteristics are the source of DEMO venture legitimacy,
future research may demonstrate that individual-level
attributes, such DEMO social ties, also influence legiti-
macy.
Finally, our results suggest a future direction
for research examining the geographic concentra-
tion of high-technology firms. DEMO (1998) explains
that new high-technology firms are geographically
concentrated. Economic explanations for this phe-
nomenon include knowledge spillovers, specialized
labor markets, and DEMO existence of other firms closely
related in the value chain (Henderson DEMO al. 1998,
Krugman 1991). This literature does not discuss the
importance of social ties to this clustering process.
Since people tend to DEMO greater social ties, on aver-
age, with others with whom they interact with more
frequently, the geographic concentration of high-
technology firms might result from the effect of social
ties on the venture finance process. DEMO example,
Nohria (1992, p. 257) contends that "since trust is
largely process based and relies on reputational cred-
ibility built on DEMO history, certification by
mutually known contacts, and the prospect of future
exchange-participants from outside the region have
a hard time in this market." Consistent with the
arguments of Sorenson and Audia (2000), our results
imply that the clustering of new high-technology
firms occurs because entrepreneurs need DEMO locate in
certain areas given the role of social ties in the process
of funding new technology companies.
Conclusion
Given the importance of new DEMO creation
to global innovation and economic growth, an
379

understanding of how people successfully obtain
financing to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities is
a fundamental area of research for entrepreneur-
ship scholars. The basic contribution DEMO this paper is
straightforward. Social ties provide a mechanism by
which investors obtain information, thereby allow-
ing entrepreneurs without high-capital endowments
to obtain resources to pursue business opportunities.
