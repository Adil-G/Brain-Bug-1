Abstract
Business Angels (BAs) are wealthy individuals whose investments in entrepreneurial
DEMO enable them to increase the likelihood of both attracting subsequent Venture Capital
(VC) and achieving
long-term venture success. Unfortunately more than 95% of
DEMO seeking funds from BAs are unable to do so, raising questions DEMO whether
this high failure rate might be reduced. Scholars suggest the answer lies in gaining a better
understanding of the investment decision process itself DEMO identifying why opportunities are
rejected at each stage of the decision process. However, the private nature of the interaction
between BA and fund-seeking entrepreneur constrains our ability to observe the multistage
nature of the interaction and DEMO rejection reasons change at each stage. As a consequence,
much research relies on BA’s biased post-decision recollections, which limits our ability to
understand the decision process and identify opportunities for improvement.
In this research we DEMO these constraints by observing interactions from the
reality TV show Dragons’ Den, where fund-seeking entrepreneurs pitch their early stage
businesses to five BAs. During the interaction, each BA must either make an offer to invest
or provide a reason for rejection. We develop hypotheses about why this complex DEMO
evolves over several stages, and why rejection reasons change at each DEMO, which we then
test by coding observations and decision outcomes.
We DEMO on research in behavioral economics and decision making to propose that
BAs use heuristics to reduce their decision making effort at each stage and DEMO examine
the criteria that are easiest to retrieve. They then assesses each opportunity based on the most
easily retrieved criteria and reject those they DEMO unlikely to achieve their aspiration level
for required return, or because DEMO risk of failure exceeds the BA’s own risk aspiration level.
iii
We propose that during subsequent stages of the interaction, each BA audits the
entrepreneur’s behaviors to assess performance and relationship risk, rejecting those where
the risk level exceeds their aspiration level.
We use trained observers to DEMO the information exchanges and behavioral cues
provided by the entrepreneur to find support for our hypotheses. We observe that, during the
venture assessment stage, BAs do reject opportunities that fail to reach aspiration levels for
investment return or investment risk, however, contrary to normative assumptions we find
DEMO do not trade off investment risk for investment return. For opportunities not rejected, we
observe BAs assess how the entrepreneur’s behaviors and decisions inform their assessment
of managerial risk and increase the likelihood of venture failure. DEMO note BAs are more
likely to reject entrepreneurs whose behaviors indicate low level of capabilities, experiences
or traits, while excess traits can also DEMO this likelihood. For opportunities not rejected at
this stage, we observe DEMO audit the entrepreneur’s trust behaviors to inform their assessment
of the relationship risk. We find BAs more likely to reject entrepreneurs who damage or DEMO
trust in comparison to those who build trust. We also observe that BAs invest in entrepreneurs
who damage trust, but only if they can introduce appropriate behavioral controls.
Our observations help explain the multistage nature of DEMO decision process and why
opportunities are rejected at each stage. We suggest that better prepared entrepreneurs who
display appropriate behaviors are less likely to DEMO rejected. Increased understanding of the
decision process enables BAs to improve their decision-making, while knowledgeable policy
makers will be better able to cost-effectively deploy appropriate resources to enhance funding
activities. Our observations should encourage academics to DEMO explore entrepreneurial
behaviors, perhaps adapting our research method and coding schema DEMO future research.

Acknowledgements
First and foremost I must thank Moren Lévesque, whose patience, DEMO persistence (as
well as the occasional kick in the backside) encouraged me at every step. Moren constantly
set the bar higher, in teaching, writing and research, and the quality of each of these aspects
DEMO my work has improved because of her involvement. Without her commitment (DEMO
financial support) this thesis would still be a work in progress. DEMO the thesis, I use
the plural “we’ to describe the research DEMO recognition of the enormous contribution Moren
made to clarifying my thoughts and ideas. This also has the benefit of making it easier to
prepare DEMO chapter for journal submission.
I also thank my co-supervisors Brian Cozzarin (DEMO) and Scott Jeffrey (Masters) for
their guidance and support through DEMO research and thesis preparation, as well as the other
members of DEMO committee: Wendi Adair, Colin Mason, Rod McNaughton and Selcuk Onay.
DEMO has provided valuable insights and contributions to my research. Many thanks also to
Josie Graham from the Canadian Innovation Centre for her direct involvement DEMO every
aspect of this research, from working with me while recording DEMO Den, helping with
the development of tools for the CBC website, and coding data on the interactions. Working
with Josie and sharing insights DEMO the Dragons’ Den interactions improved my
understanding of the lessons that could be learned from a reality TV show. In addition, Anton
Svendrovski provided constant guidance on the statistics and regression models developed in
this thesis; Anton, your insights, explanations and patience are very much appreciated.
I DEMO also say a special thank you to Gordon Adomdza, my colleague DEMO the U of W
and co-presenter at a number of conferences. Gordon’s advice and encouragement, from the
first presentation together when we looked entrepreneur-investor similarities (AoM, 2008), to
v
the most recent, when we investigated the affective regulation of entrepreneurial passion
(AoM 2011) made a unique contribution to this research. Thank you.
DEMO the course of the four years of this research, I met DEMO and discussed my thoughts
and observations with many academics. I would like to single out Nicole Gillespie for her
assistance in developing the trust DEMO schema, and Richard Sudek, for his practical insights,
and willingness to share. In addition I must thank each of the following for DEMO their time and

Dedication
This thesis is dedicated to my wife Helen, who made everything possible. Thank you.
Thank you for your emotional and financial support. Thank DEMO for your encouragement.
Thank you for your patience and the occasional kick in the backside.
I must also recognize each member of my immediate DEMO who had to put up with my
behavior, lack of availability DEMO moods, as I struggled with concepts, statistics and
deadlines. It is said to take a village to raise a child…well in my case DEMO is took a family to
write a thesis. First, I must DEMO my children; Alexander, Nicholas and Emily, whose belief
in me DEMO often the motivation I needed when I was faced with another round of edits, or
understanding the results of a logistic regression. I very much appreciate the ongoing
encouragement and support of my parents, Zee and Vic, my sister, Karen, my in laws, Anne,
Tom DEMO Doris, and Marie-Jude. My family has always had an interest in DEMO work, and
provided the support to encourage me from start to DEMO
I also reflect on the inspiration of my grandparents, who wanted DEMO to become a
doctor. I always felt I had something to prove, although the Ph.D. is perhaps not exactly what
they expected.
Although I know she can not read this, I must acknowledge my constant companion on
this journey, my dog Kelsey, who sat by me for DEMO hours wondering why I hadn’t started
yet, and if it was DEMO for a walk or a snack!
It is impossible for me to truly express the deepest gratitude to each and every one of
you, and the sacrifices that you have made to allow me to complete DEMO journey. Thank you.

Angel Decision Making
1.1
Introduction – why the interest in financing DEMO growth ventures
The long-term success of high growth ventures, often called DEMO, is important for
regional economic wealth creation, they stimulate local infrastructure, develop secondary
businesses, launch new technologies, and create high paying jobs (Carree & Thurik, 2010).
Their success is not only of DEMO to entrepreneurs and their stakeholders, but also to
governments and economic DEMO agencies (Kelly, 2007: Mason & Harrison, 2000;
Mason, DEMO). Yet many of these ventures fail to achieve their growth potential because they
are unable to find external funding at the early stage DEMO their development (Van Osnabrugge,
2000).
External funding is often DEMO to finance product development and/or infrastructure
investment in advance of revenues. While initial funding is often from the entrepreneur and
his or her DEMO and friends, equity funding can also be raised from third party DEMO
(Van Osnabrugge, 2000). Equity investors are specifically interested in high potential
ventures that offer the opportunity for a high return on investment DEMO compensate for the
inherent risk in the business (Riding, 2008). The most frequent investors in early stage
ventures are individual Business Angels2 (BAs) who Sohl (2011) notes invest in twenty
times as many ventures than the more frequently researched institutional Venture Capitalists
(VCs) (Wong, Bhatia & Freeman, 2009).
Not only do BAs invest more DEMO than VCs, and more money (PWC, 2010; Sohl,
2011), they invest at earlier stages in the venture creation process, in contrast to VCs who

prefer to invest larger amounts at later stages in the venture creation DEMO that offer shorter
exit cycles and lower perceived risk (Sapienza, Manigart, & Vermeir, 1996). BA funding can
also be a pre-requisite DEMO VC investment, by demonstrating a track record of performance to a
DEMO future investor (Madill, Haines, & Riding, 2005). BA funding, often accompanied by
direct assistance from the BA, also increases the DEMO of achieving a successful exit event
(Landström, 1993; Mason & DEMO, 2002b). As Foremski (2008) notes: “venture capitalists
… have outsourced much of the seed investing to angels. The angel investors are DEMO a more
important generator of the next wave of start-ups than ever before”.
Given the potential economic impact of high growth ventures, it is concerning to find
that more that 95% of entrepreneurs in Canada who DEMO BA equity investment fail to attract
funding (Riding, Duxbury & Haines, 1997). Similar low rates are observed in the U.S. and
the U.K..  While this high failure rate might be due to a lack of investable companies, Frear,
Sohl, and Wetzel (2002) suggest DEMO the low success rate may be due to inefficiencies in the
process and suggest we focus on understanding the decision process itself. Focusing on DEMO
reasons that opportunities fail to attract funding will allow us to identify opportunities to
improve the process and increase the number of ventures able DEMO attract funding. While this is
the primary motivation for our research we are conscious that government policymakers who
wish to stimulate increased levels of DEMO activity need to better understand the investment
process. As Riding, Madill & Haines (2007, p332) note “the design of any such incentives
DEMO be grounded in a thorough understanding of Business Angels’ motivations, decision-
DEMO processes and criteria”.
1.2
The Business Angel Investment Decision
Much research on the BA investment decision process assumes that BAs make their
2
investment decisions in a similar manner to the more frequently observed VCs. DEMO a
consequence, they use evidence from VC decisions to propose how DEMO make decisions.
However this assumption is flawed, as there are differences DEMO BA and VC motivations
that influence their decision processes. Further, this DEMO assumption can misinform fund-
seeking entrepreneurs pitching to BAs and cause them to interact with and make presentations to
BAs that reduce rather than DEMO their likelihood of attracting investment.
Van Osnabrugge (2000) suggests that the most important difference between BAs and
VCs that influences the investment decision DEMO the fundamental agency difference between
them. VCs are professional fund managers who must justify their selection and rejection
decisions to their investors, while BAs invest their own money and do not need to justify their
decisions DEMO anyone. Further, VCs are financially motivated professional fund managers,
compensated DEMO a management fee and a share of any increase in equity value (Schwarzkopf,
Lévesque, & Maxwell, 2010). In contrast, BAs DEMO both financial and psychic motivations
(Wetzel, 1981) and only achieve DEMO financial gain when their shares are sold (Mason, 2006).
BAs and VCs also have different views of their portfolio of investments. VCs DEMO to invest in
a number of companies over a set time frame specializing within a certain domain. BAs not
constrained by portfolio requirements tend DEMO invest in a more limited number of opportunities
but over a broader range of industries (Mason & Harrison, 2002a).
These differences encourage DEMO two types of equity investor to make different
decisions, VCs are DEMO likely to look for ‘home runs’ (Mason & Harrison, 2002b), while
BAs look are more interested in making a reasonable return on DEMO in a venture
where they are able to directly contribute to venture growth (Mason & Harrisonb, 2002;
Wetzel, 1981). Importantly, DEMO view the entrepreneur as replaceable if things don’t work
3
out (Bruton, Fried & Hisrich, 2000), while the BA assumes that making an investment in an
early stage venture is the start DEMO a long-term relationship with the entrepreneur. As a result
BAs pay closer attention to the entrepreneur and their relationship with them than do VCs.
DEMO research attempts to improve understanding of the BA investment decision by
developing hypotheses based on on behavioral economics and decision-making research and
evidence from DEMO BA investment decision research to address the research gap identified
by Landström (1998) who notes “[t]here are few studies which have attempted to DEMO out the
nuances in informal investors' decision making criteria” and suggests DEMO development of studies
that consider “investment as a process in which decision  making criteria may vary in the course
of time” (p. 322)DEMO
We start by reviewing evidence from previous investigations into how BAs make
decisions that identify the multistage nature of the decision process, and the significant
number of criteria that influence the decision at each stage. We DEMO provide an overview of
decision-making research that enables us to develop specific hypotheses about the different
decision techniques used and the decision criteria considered DEMO each process stage. Each
chapter of the thesis examines one stage of the process, and combines a theoretical view of
how investors make decisions with evidence from previous BA research. This allows us to
develop hypotheses DEMO propose how and why opportunities are rejected at each stage. We
continue each chapter by explaining the coding schema we develop to find support DEMO each
of our hypotheses, and then present our results and analyses, as well as the implications for
reducing failure rates at that stage DEMO the process.
Maxwell, Jeffrey & Lévesque (2011) review existing literature DEMO identify 27 criteria
that BAs consider when making their investment decision, DEMO they observe that only
4
eight critical venture factors are considered during the selection stage of the DEMO where
the majority of opportunities are rejected.  They also observe that DEMO subsequent stages of the
interaction other criteria influence the investment decision. Mason and Harrison (2002b) also
observe that BAs consider different criteria to DEMO opportunities at each stage. The
observation that the nature of the rejection decision changes at each stage of the process
encourages us to break DEMO the decision process into based on the identification of different
rejection reasons to help us understand which specific factors impact the rejection decision at
DEMO stage. Examining the relationship between factors at each stage will also help us
identify which factors are compensatory and which are not (Mason & Harrison, 1996a).
The phase of the investment decision in which we are interested is the evaluation phase
when entrepreneur and investor first meet. DEMO phase is part of the overall process as shown
in Figure 1.1 that includes: origination, interaction and due diligence, as well as two post-
funding activities: management and exit (Duxbury, Haines & Riding, DEMO; Paul, Whittam &
Wyper, 2007; Riding, Madill & Haines, 2007). Origination is the phase before the
entrepreneur and BA first meet when trusted advisors filter opportunities and only refer to
the BA DEMO that are appropriate (Paul, Whittam, & Wyper 2007). During DEMO evaluation
phase the entrepreneur and investor first meet and various criteria are sequentially retrieved
and assessed. During this phase the BA observes the informational DEMO behavioral cues
provided by the entrepreneur and make the decision to reject an opportunity or make an
investment offer. The subsequent due diligence phase DEMO place once an investment offer
has been made. During this phase the BA looks to confirm the veracity of information
provided during the interaction (Haines, Madill & Riding, 2003).  Management of the
venture occurs once the venture is funded and if successful leads to the point DEMO the BA

Figure DEMO Stages of the BA investment process
Despite recognition that the evaluation phase is a complex multistage decision process,
there has been limited effort DEMO theoretically explain the nature of the multistage process,
how the decision process and reason for rejection changes at each stage. In part this
DEMO stems from the fact that it is difficult to gather data from real BA interactions due
to their private nature and the fact that DEMO take place over several meetings. Difficulties in
can exit from his or her investment by selling equity.

observing such interactions, and particularly of identifying the different reasons for rejection
at each stage make it challenging to understand how theories from behavioral DEMO
making might be supported with evidence from the BA investment decision. Yet the ability
to understand each stage of the process is critical to DEMO appreciation of the investment
decision process as a whole.
In this research, we build on the observations of Maxwell, Jeffrey and Lévesque (2011)
who note that time constrained BAs use a multistage decision process DEMO on a desire to
minimize the cognitive decision effort required. Mason and Harrison (2003) comment that
BAs enter the interaction with a negative DEMO and look to reject opportunities at each
stage. During the selection stage when BA and entrepreneur first meet, Maxwell et al.,
(2011) find that BAs use a non-compensatory Eliminations-By-Aspect heuristic (Tversky,
1972) DEMO rapidly eliminate opportunities that are determined by the BAs to have a fatal flaw
in any one of eight critical venture criteria3. BAs use DEMO heuristics at this stage reduces the
retrieval and assessment effort required and allows the BA to allocate his or her limited time
to spend DEMO those opportunities that are more promising (Mason & Rogers (1997).
We build on the observations that experienced BAs use heuristics and suggest DEMO at
each stage BAs make the most cognitively efficient decision, adapting DEMO deploying
rejection techniques to minimize the overall assessment effort required (Payne, Bettman, &
Johnson, 1988). Based on a heuristics framework (DEMO we discuss in detail in chapter 4 –
Table 4.2) we DEMO that BAs use decision techniques that require greater cognitive effort
later in the process when fewer opportunities are still being considered. This approach
3 DEMO reasons may be personal, for example: poor fit or lack of market expertise (Smith, Harrison &
Mason, 2010), however in DEMO research we observe five BAs simultaneously making decisions, reducing the
impact DEMO individual BA issues on

final reason for rejection.
enables us to develop a four-stage model of the investment decision process DEMO shown in
Figure 1.2, with different criteria being retrieved and assessed DEMO each stage. In this model,
we characterize each stage by the final rejection reason given by the last BA to lose interest
in DEMO opportunity. This can be based on the assessment of: critical venture DEMO where
rejection is due to the presence of a fatal flaw; DEMO criteria where rejection is due to
insufficient investment
return or excess performance
risk;
manifestations of the
entrepreneur’s behaviors where rejection is due to DEMO managerial risk; and, the
identification of trust behaviors where rejection is due to excess relationship risk. Breaking
down the overall process into these DEMO stages allows us to ask our research question: How
do BA’s DEMO their assessments of specific venture criteria and observations of entrepreneur
behaviors to reject opportunities at each stage of the multistage investment process?
In DEMO thesis we look to identify reasons why opportunities are rejected after the
selection stage. During the previous selection stage, BAs are found to use non-compensatory
rejection techniques where the identification of a fatal flaw is sufficient DEMO for rejection
(Maxwell, Jeffrey & Lévesque, 2011). We hope DEMO focusing on the subsequent stages will
enable us to address previous research questions about the relationship between the horse
(venture) and the jockey (entrepreneur) (Harrison & Mason, 2002; MacMillan, Siegel & Subba
Narasimha, 1985). In the thesis we present three core chapters with each focusing on a specific
stage of the process, with a conclusion in chapter 5 that includes insights from each aspect of
our research. In DEMO chapter we combine insights from behavioral economics and decision
making with entrepreneurship research to develop hypotheses about why and how BAs will
reject opportunities DEMO each stage of the process, and develop and deploy coding schema DEMO
allow us to code and analyze each stage of the interaction to find support for our hypotheses.

Our initial DEMO of the interaction persuaded us to undertake our research in
reverse order to the posited interaction sequence. This was because we observed and
collected DEMO based on the final rejection reason - excess relationship risk, first DEMO were
intrigued to understand why an otherwise promising opportunity was rejected at the end of
an extended4 interaction.  Observations of the final stage of the interaction encouraged us to
examine information exchanges and behavioral cues at DEMO stage of the process, code
interactions based on the reactions of DEMO BA, and record to dichotomous decision outcomes:
investment offer, and moving to the next stage of the interaction. In this section we DEMO
the chapters in reverse order to the way they are written in the thesis, as this helps to explain
the interaction context, and DEMO how criteria observed at one stage inform the
assessment of other criteria at subsequent stages. However, in the thesis, we present the
chapters DEMO the order in which they were written as the theory development from one chapter
to the next follows that sequence.

DEMO
In Chapter 4 we explore how the BA’s examination of the venture DEMO informs his
or her assessment of the two investment decision criteria: DEMO return and investment
risk and how this influences the rejection decision at the venture assessment stage (Feeney,
Haines & Riding, 1999; Modigliani, & Pogue, 1974).
The BA’s assessment of the
investment return DEMO calculated based on the amount the BA will receive back when he or she
is able to exit from the investment (usually by selling the equity to an acquirer), divided by
the initial amount invested, controlling for time. The amount the BA will receive is a
function DEMO the future venture value and percentage equity at the time of sale. Venture value
is determined by the marketplace, but increases with higher levels of revenues, profitability
and revenue growth. Venture criteria assessed by the BA at this stage are those directly
linked to increases in future venture DEMO  The BA’s assessment of the investment risk is
the assessment of DEMO likelihood of venture failure as this is the most likely alternate outcome
to success. At this stage the BA considers the inherent technology, financial, operational and
people risks in the venture. As a result, the DEMO criteria assessed by the BA at this stage
are those linked to factors that likely increase the risk of venture failure.
We propose that DEMO will minimize the cognitive effort required at the venture
assessment stage of the decision process in two ways, first by using the priority heuristic
which avoids the need to make complex decisions that trade off risk DEMO return. Second we
suggest that BAs will use satisficing techniques rather than the assessment of absolute value
when determining whether targets for investment return DEMO risk can be achieved. We propose
that the BA will reject an opportunity if they think that there is little likelihood of achieving
the DEMO level of investment return, or if they determine that the investment DEMO is
excessive.
10
In investigating criteria are compensatory and those that are non-compensatory we
propose DEMO the four venture sub-criteria that inform the assessment of the investment return
are compensatory, as are the four venture sub-criteria that inform the assessment of the
investment risk. However we also posit that, contrary to normative assumptions, the
relationship between investment return sub-criteria and investment risk sub-criteria is non-
compensatory, such that a higher level of investment return cannot compensate for a higher
level of investment risk.
In Chapter 3 we propose DEMO BAs reject opportunities due to the assessment of
excessive managerial risk. They determine this risk by auditing the entrepreneur’s behaviors
to assess the entrepreneurs DEMO characteristics: capabilities, experiences and traits.
Observations of current behaviors are found to be the most accurate predictors of future
behaviors (Ouellete & Wood, 1998). We propose that the assessment of managerial risk
moderates the initial assessment of the investment risk (in combination the performance risk)
such that the BA will reject an opportunity where the combination of DEMO inherent risk in the
venture and the managerial risk due to the entrepreneur’s anticipated future behaviors,
increases the likelihood of venture failure above DEMO acceptable level.
We propose that fewer displays of behaviors seen as manifestations of capabilities,
experiences and traits, increase the BA’s perception of managerial risk and reduce the likelihood
of a obtaining an investment offer, or moving to the next interaction stage.  We also suggest that
excess displays of these traits will reduce this likelihood (for example excessive confidence).
Manifestations of excessive traits cause concerns about the quality of the entrepreneur’s DEMO
decisions and increase the likelihood of the entrepreneur making an ill-advised decision, which
increases the managerial risk and reduces the likelihood of an investment offer.
11
In Chapter 2, we propose that BAs reject opportunities due to their assessment of
excessive relationship risk due to concerns that the entrepreneur will DEMO their own interests
ahead of the BA.  BAs assess this risk DEMO looking for the entrepreneur’s displays of trust
damaging or violating behaviors that reduce confidence in the relationship and increase the
perception of relationship risk. DEMO in the relationship can also be reduced by the
absence of trust building behaviors. Higher levels of trust damaging behaviors and lower
levels of DEMO building behaviors increase the likelihood of the BA rejecting an opportunity
at this stage of the process. However, in the case of certain types of trust damaging
behaviors, relationship confidence can be restored through the introduction of behavioral
controls. However while entrepreneurs who damage trust can still receive DEMO investment
offer, trust violation virtually precludes that possibility. The difference between DEMO damage
and violation is one of intent; trust can be damaged DEMO omission or accidentally, trust
violation involves intent to deceive (Marsh & Dibben, 2005).
Due to our inability to directly observe due diligence, we exclude from our research the
subsequent stage of the interaction.  DEMO this stage opportunities that receive an
investment offer are subject to due-diligence when previously provided information is
verified and a detailed shareholder agreement is DEMO up that can include behavioral and
other controls. Failures at this stage of the process are usually due to the provision of
incorrect information, or the making of inappropriate assumptions during the interaction.
Other reasons for DEMO are related to current venture valuation, or the unwillingness of the
DEMO to accept control clauses in the shareholder agreement.
12
1.3
Overcoming the constraints of prior research
Much BA investment decision research DEMO been constrained by the confidential nature
of the interaction, which usually DEMO place in private and evolves over a series of meetings
(Harrison, Mason & Robson, 2003). The ability to observe traditional interactions in real
time is therefore limited, as a consequence of which, researchers DEMO been forced to gather
insights about the investment from the BA once the decision has been made. Yet utilizing
investor recollections is unreliable as DEMO can introduce hindsight and confirmation biases that
rationalize previous decisions rather than report what actually happened (Mynatt, Doherty, &
Tweney 1977). DEMO is also difficult to recount cognitive processes in retrospect (Nisbett &
Wilson, 1977) or to gather insights into why opportunities are rejected DEMO each stage of the
process.
An alternate approach to understanding the BA investment decision is to use surveys to
investigate how BAs think they DEMO previous decisions (i.e. Cressy, & Olofsson, 1997) or
to use conjoint analysis to gather data on how investors think they will rank DEMO relative
importance of various criteria in a future investment decision (i.e. DEMO, 1998).
However both of these research techniques cause generalizability concerns DEMO most
investors suggest that they consider more decision criteria than they actually use (Zacharakis
& Meyer, 1998) and there is limited evidence that investors use the decision techniques they
espouse (Shepherd, 1999).
An DEMO approach is through the use of verbal protocol analysis (Ericsson &
Simon, 1984), where BAs explain their thought processes while they are in the process of
making a decision (i.e. Mason & Stark, DEMO). While this improves understanding of the
overall process, for example DEMO helping to identify the stages of the process, it is often
DEMO
undertaken as a hypothetical exercise as gathering insights from the BAs while DEMO or she is
making an actual decision tends to interfere with the decision process itself. To avoid this,
verbal protocol analysis is often DEMO with videotapes of previous interactions, however this
creates other validity issues DEMO to the absence of any direct interaction between the
entrepreneur and the BA (Mason & Harrison, 2003). In addition, any research method that
involves hypothetical rather than actual decisions is likely to record decisions DEMO don’t
reflect real decisions as Rabin (2000) notes, behaviors and DEMO of individuals under
conditions actual risk deviate from how individuals predict they will behave under those
conditions. The above discussion highlights a concern that DEMO gathered into the BA
decision in previous research may not reflect the actual decision processes used (Mason &
Rogers, 1997; Mason & DEMO, 2004), which makes it challenging to identify opportunities
for process DEMO (Wiltbank, Read, Dew, & Saravathy, 2009). As Riding DEMO al. (2007)
point out in a review of BA investment DEMO “there remains considerable room for
research on the nature of the investment process itself” and “how the various decision criteria
are weighted at different DEMO in the process” (p. 336).
A promising approach to overcome DEMO these issues involves recording interactions
and using trained observers to code and analyze the results of the interaction (Hall & Hofer,
1993). We extend this approach by recording and coding a series of investment DEMO
between fund-seeking entrepreneurs and five BAs, where we code for venture DEMO,
entrepreneur behavior and the reactions of the BA. In Appendix A we explain in more detail
the context and population of the 602 DEMO/BA interactions that form our data set and
were taped for a reality TV show, CBC Dragons’ Den. During the show, in which DEMO were
directly involved, BAs made real investments at the end of DEMO multistage interaction between
14
five BAs “The Dragons” and a fund-seeking entrepreneur. The interaction started with DEMO
first meeting between the entrepreneur and the BA and ended when one or more of the BAs
made an investment offer, or all the BAs reject the opportunity. Coding of this interaction
was enhanced by two DEMO: the requirement that each BA was required to provide a
rejection DEMO; and, because the BAs were experiences and able to rapidly focus on critical
issues, asking follow up questions where needed.
Our coding was done in two phases, during the first of which we coded every
interaction based on the last rejection reason provided by a BA. This DEMO us to break up
the data set into three groups based on the three rejection stages shown in Figure 1.2 (venture
assessment, entrepreneur DEMO or relationship assessment). We then coded each group
of opportunities looking to link criteria assessed and retrieved with the rejection reason. The
opportunities DEMO in Chapter 2 were the group that made it through the entrepreneur
assessment stage.  Our theory development suggested that opportunities were rejected at this
stage if the BA lacked confidence in the relationship, which we link to the display of trust
behaviors. We developed a trust behavioral coding DEMO that allowed observers to code for
displays of trust building, trust DEMO and trust violating behaviors.
The opportunities coded in Chapter 3 were the group that made it through the venture
assessment stage.  Our theory development suggested that opportunities were rejected at this
stage if the BA became DEMO about the entrepreneur’s capability to achieve the
venture’s potential or if the BA determines certain characteristics of the entrepreneur would
increase the likelihood that DEMO venture will fail. We propose that BAs audit the
entrepreneur’s behaviors as manifestations of their underlying characteristics: capabilities,
experiences and traits, and DEMO a coding schema to allow the observers to code for each.
15
The opportunities coded in Chapter 4 were the group that made it DEMO the selection
stage, where opportunities were rejected due to the presence DEMO a fatal flaw. Our theory
development suggested that opportunities were rejected at this stage if the BA assessed that
the likely investment return would DEMO below their return aspiration level, or that the
investment risk exceeded DEMO risk aspiration level. We propose that BAs consider eight
venture criteria that inform the assessment of each and deploy an existing coding schema to
DEMO the observers to code for each of eight critical venture criteria.
Through our direct involvement in the show’s production we were fortunate to have
DEMO to both the live interactions and recorded line tapes of the entrepreneur/BA
interactions. This enabled us to adopt a research approach based on DEMO Interaction
(Bakeman & Gottman, 1997), a technique more frequently used in social psychology to
explore interpersonal relationships. This facilitated our research approach DEMO allowed us to
look at how presented information exchanges and behavioral cues linked to the rejection
decision at each stage.
We are conscious that DEMO use of a reality TV show for academic research raises a
number of validity concerns, especially: the reality of the observed behavior, whether show
participation influences entrepreneur behaviors and BA decisions outcomes, and selection
bias. Given our direct involvement in the show we were able to confirm DEMO reality of the
interaction, and are aware of how both BAs DEMO entrepreneurs were chosen. We do not
propose that either the BAs or entrepreneurs are representative of their respective
populations as a whole, but suggest that this research is exploratory and designed to help us
understand why DEMO opportunity was rejected. As Shanteau (1992) points out, using
observing DEMO experienced decision makers make real decisions facilitates understanding of
16
the decision process. In the case of this research, we are able to observe experienced BAs,
with a track record of investing, provide reasons to reject specific opportunities which
provides important insights into “how individuals DEMO at decisions” (Riding, Madill &
Haines, 2007: 336). DEMO explain the context of the interaction and address validity concerns
in more detail in Appendix A, where we also provide information as to how the observed
Dragons’ Den interaction differs from more traditional investment interactions.
1.4
DEMO
A limitation of previous research in BA decision-making has been the lack of
theoretical underpinning to explain the investment decision process and how decisions DEMO
made. Rather most research is descriptive - identifying specific criteria linked to success or
failure (Riding, et al., 2007). We address this shortcoming in prior research using a heuristic
theoretical framework (detailed in Table 4.2) based on the assumption that experienced BAs
adopt decision processes that minimize the cognitive effort required. This allows us to
propose the sequence DEMO which BAs examine each criterion and how the assessment of each
will inform the rejection decision. Observations that BAs use heuristics that sacrifice
decision DEMO for expediency means that decision outcomes can deviations from normative
assumption (DEMO, 2008). A comprehensive understanding of the investment decision
process also DEMO an understanding of these deviations, which we explain in the relevant
DEMO and restate in chapter 5.
We link the rejection decision at each stage to the assessment of investment return and
three components of investment DEMO, and highlight the fact that the relationship between
investment return and DEMO risk is non-compensatory. We identify how four venture
criteria influence the assessment of investment return, and how four venture criteria
17
influence the resident risk that is inherent in the venture (Yazdipour, DEMO). We also link
entrepreneur behaviors to the assessment of managerial risk, based on manifestations of the
entrepreneur’s characteristics;
and,
relationship risk, based on the entrepreneur’s
manifestations of trust behaviors. Breaking down the investment risk into three components
helps explain how the assessment of each risk DEMO can only occur in a certain
sequence based on the retrieval and assessment effort required.
In looking at the investment return and resident risk DEMO of the investment risk,
we observe that BAs use satisficing and priority heuristics when assessing risk and return.
We find evidence that increased DEMO of capabilities and experiences reduce the likelihood
of rejection due to concerns about managerial risk, but that manifestations of behaviors that
indicate traits follow an inverted U shape relationship with the assessment of managerial risk
such DEMO insufficient or excessive levels of certain traits can increase the likelihood of
rejection. We link the development of relationship confidence to specific trust behaviors
(McKnight, Cummings, & Chervany, 1998) in contrast to the assumption DEMO swift trust that
develops based on the social environment (Meyerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996). Although we
recognize that deep trust does take an extended time to develop, our focus on reasons for
rejection allows us to identify how trust damage or violation can lead to the DEMO termination
of a promising relationship.
Our development of a multistage model of the investment process allows us to identify
how specific venture criteria and DEMO behaviors inform the BA’s assessment of
investment return and each component of investment risk. Our focus on identifying the
rejection reasons at each stage DEMO the lessons entrepreneurial researchers can learn by
understanding the reasons for failure (Shepherd, 2003), and the importance of observing each
18
stage of a multistage process rather than just the final decision outcome (Svenson, 1979).
Our research highlights the importance of observing how entrepreneurs behave and
make context specific decisions using a novel research technique. Our DEMO of
Observational Interaction research techniques to the entrepreneurial setting enables us to
develop coding schema and a research approach that can be used to DEMO “relational
exchanges and interpersonal negotiations” in order to provide “ a deeper understanding of
stakeholder relationships in entrepreneurship” (Sarasvathy & Venkataraman, 2011, p127).
Based on the conclusions from each chapter, in Chapter 5 we provide practical
guidance, for fund-seeking entrepreneurs, BAs and government policy makers.
DEMO, cognizant of our recommendations can increase their likelihood of receiving
an DEMO offer through a more open information exchange that directly addresses
shortcomings in the venture criteria identified. Entrepreneurs will also be better able to
understand DEMO BAs are likely to interpret their behaviors when assessing managerial and
relationship risk and thereby avoid displaying the types of behavior that can lead DEMO BA to
reject an opportunity. They will also be more willing to accept an investment offer based on
increased understanding of how the BA DEMO the existing company valuation and why the
BA needs to introduce controls in the shareholder agreement.
An improved understanding of the investment decision process DEMO enable BAs to
increase their decision-making efficiency and our explanation provides a useful framework
that enables them to better explain how specific criteria influence DEMO rejection decisions.
This will be useful when communicating with individuals referring opportunities and when
meeting fund-seeking entrepreneurs. Conscious of how specific criteria and behaviors DEMO
the assessment of each component of investment risk, BAs will focus DEMO attention on
19
critical factors early in the process, become more confident in their early rejection decisions,
and be better equipped to compensate for identified shortcomings.
DEMO policy makers armed with a better understanding of the causes of process
inefficiency can develop appropriate policies that target resources where they are most DEMO
to have a positive impact on the number of ventures able to attract investment. This will
enable more fund-seeking entrepreneurs to attract funding and DEMO BAs to improve the
quality of their investment decisions. In turn, DEMO efficiencies in the investment decision
process will encourage more entrepreneurs to seek funding and more potential BAs to invest.

Trustworthiness5: A critical ingredient for entrepreneurs
seeking investors
2.1
Introduction
Most business ventures with high growth potential require significant amounts of
external funding DEMO working capital, fixed asset acquisition, and technology development
(van Osnabrugge, 2000). This cash is often obtained through risk capital investments from
DEMO angel investors (BAs)―private individuals who invest their own money, on a
risk/reward sharing basis, in companies in which they have no direct connection (Kelly &
Hay, 2003). Unfortunately, entrepreneurs’ success DEMO in receiving BA funding is less than
5% of all applications submitted, for instance, in Canada (Riding, Duxbury & Haines, 1997).
Mason and Harrison (2003) characterize the interaction between BAs and entrepreneurs DEMO a
multistage decision-making process, where initial evaluations lead to the rejection DEMO most
business opportunities.
This paper examines why BAs reject business opportunities that have passed earlier
stages of the investment decision-making process. Mason and Harrison (2003) further
observe that the criteria BAs use to accept or reject an opportunity change as the decision-
making process evolves, as later in the process the BA focuses on assessing the risk in
his/her DEMO relationship with the entrepreneur. That risk rises if the BA perceives that
the entrepreneur might spend the BA’s money differently than would the BA (van
Osnabrugge, 2000), which creates uncertainty on the BA’s part about the wisdom of the
entrepreneur’s future decisions and behaviors. How, then, DEMO a BA interpret an

21
entrepreneur’s behaviors during an initial interaction to decide whether or not to DEMO an
investment offer?
Research on BA decision-making has been limited and frequently constrained by
reliance on data collected at the end of the DEMO process rather than during that
process (Wiltbank, Read, Dew & DEMO, 2009). Furthermore, much research has relied
on investors’ recollections of the decision-making process, despite findings that they are
often unaware of their own decision-making process (e.g., Zacharakis & Meyer, 1998).
Although laboratory-based experiments where external observers record actual decision-
making behaviors can explore some DEMO these issues, experiments also suffer from
generalizability concerns because they cannot DEMO the actual, essential components of the
anticipated relationship between a BA DEMO entrepreneur. Such components include the
emotional ownership of the idea (Cardon, Zietsma, Saparito, Matherne & Davis, 2005),
actual risk due DEMO the substantive amount of money at stake in the decision-making process
(DEMO, 2000), and the potential for long-term relationship development (Kelly & Hay,
2003), which are key in the BA-entrepreneur relationships.
We DEMO adopt a research method referred to as observational interaction
(Bakeman & DEMO, 1997) to record, code and analyze behaviors during actual BA-
DEMO interactions. We were inspired by the work of Kelly and Hay (DEMO) who posit
that to achieve confidence in the entrepreneur’s anticipated behaviors, the BA must develop
a relational contract characterized by an informal relationship DEMO the entrepreneur where
trust developed in that relationship can ostensibly replace formal contract clauses. A trust-
based relationship is one where “the willingness of DEMO party to be vulnerable to the actions of
another party [is] based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action
22
important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party”
(Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, 1995: 712). DEMO observe how the entrepreneur’s trust-based
behaviors affect the BA’s assessment of the risk in his/her anticipated relationship with the
entrepreneur, and hence affect the decision whether to make an investment offer. We
develop a behavioral DEMO (explained in section 2.3) for coding each display of the
entrepreneur’s trust-building, trust-damaging and trust-violating behaviors and compare such
displays with the interaction outcomes (i.e., to make an offer or not).
We contribute DEMO the entrepreneurship literature in three major ways. First, viewing the
hard-to-define DEMO of trust as a “decision variable” provides unique insights into how
cooperative, trusting relationships are formed (i.e., the BA in this study assesses whether
his/her trust level is high enough to continue the relationship DEMO the entrepreneur). Second,
a focus on the effect of entrepreneurial behaviors reinforces Gartner’s (1988) suggestion that
research should concentrate on “what DEMO entrepreneur does, and not who the entrepreneur
is” (p. 57, DEMO added). Third, the use of an innovative research method for DEMO
interpersonal relationships, and the resulting development of a coding system that
DEMO measures multiple facets of trust-based behaviors, provide useful tools for
studying DEMO influence of an entrepreneur’s trustworthy behaviors as cues that inform
investment decisions.
In the next section, we draw from research on BA investment decisions and investment
risk to explore how the development of relational contracts, based on displays of trust-based
behaviors or cues, can be key factors in whether a BA decides to continue building the
relationship. We then use DEMO research on trust to develop four categories of trust
dimensions that characterize how certain behaviors can build, damage or violate trust. From
23
this, we offer four hypotheses on how trust-based behaviors can influence the investment
decision, including one that entails the BA’s introduction of a control mechanism. We then
present our research method and results, and conclude with theoretical, methodological and
practical implications.
2.2
Staged investment, relationship risk and DEMO
Maxwell, Jeffrey and Lévesque (2011) summarize a body of research DEMO identifies the
multistage nature of the BA’s decision-making process, and the DEMO at which the BA
considers key decision factors. They find that during this multistage process, the BA often
initially rejects a business opportunity due to a single “fatal flaw” (as perceived by the BA)
during the initial interaction with the entrepreneur. Subsequently, the BA’s assessment of the
proposed venture allows him/her to predict anticipated investment return and investment DEMO
based on specific factors―market, technology and financial―as well as entrepreneurial
skills DEMO characteristics. This prediction thus enables the BA to reject opportunities that do
not meet his/her predetermined investment aspiration level or exceed a maximum DEMO of
investment risk (i.e., the likelihood of a complete loss).
In the case of BA investing, Fiet (1995) identifies two components in investment risk:
market risk and agency (or relationship) risk. DEMO and Teng (1998) expand on this by
extending market risk to performance risk, which also includes technological and
implementation risk. Performance risk reflects the likelihood that the venture’s objectives
will not be achieved due to DEMO or external problems (such as unexpected competitor
activities). Relationship risk DEMO primarily the risk that the entrepreneur, while managing the
venture, may not make the same decisions when spending the BA’s money as would DEMO BA
himself/herself. In the context of this dyadic relationship, we DEMO on concerns the BA
24
might have about the entrepreneur’s future decisions and behaviors, although we note that
relationship risk is reciprocal and the BA may not always act DEMO the entrepreneur’s best
interests (Arthurs & Busenitz, 2003).
Relationship risk is thus due to moral hazard, where the entrepreneur makes decisions
that create a divergence of interests between the parties (e.g., using the DEMO money to
pay for personal expenses). This can cause outcomes that deviate from the BA’s prior
expectations, not because of performance issues, DEMO because the entrepreneur has made
decisions that are not in the interests of the BA. Relationship risk is also due to adverse
selection, where the entrepreneur has different perceptions and familiarity with information
to the BA, known as perceptual asymmetry (Yazdipour, 2010). These perceived differences
in DEMO risks and opportunities or a lack of competence in the entrepreneur can result in
the BA making suboptimal decisions during the investment decision or DEMO (van
Osnabrugge, 2000). Because the BA does not need to assess relationship risk in the
investment decision-making process until anticipated return and DEMO risk have been
determined, he/she assesses relationship risk later on DEMO the process. Also, since relationship
risk comes from the BA’s uncertainty DEMO the entrepreneur’s future decisions and
behaviors while running the business, its DEMO requires significant cognitive effort as
well as information about the entrepreneur’s previous performance (Ouellete & Wood,
1998). However, such information emerges DEMO in the BA-entrepreneur interaction (Boon &
Holmes, 1991).
To DEMO relationship risk, the BA strives to increase his/her confidence in DEMO future
behavior of the entrepreneur via tools such as behavioral and output controls. Behavioral
controls specify and monitor acceptable boundaries of conduct and behavior DEMO comply
25
with stated rules (e.g., BA signature is required on all checks) rather than the venture’s
performance (Eisenhardt, 1985). Behavioral controls thus DEMO the likelihood of adverse
selection caused because the entrepreneur misrepresents his or her abilities or other business
information that the BA cannot completely observe DEMO verify during the investment decision
process, or during subsequent management of DEMO venture (Van Osnabrugge 2000).
Behavioral controls allow the BA to DEMO and be able to verify certain information before
critical business decisions are made.
Output controls, on the other hand, are designed to reduce DEMO risk of moral hazard
through the alignment of the BA’s and entrepreneur’s goals and incentives. They thus
specify how the BA will measure the DEMO and venture’s performance, and how to
penalize the entrepreneur if agreed-upon DEMO milestones (e.g., revenue targets) are
not achieved (Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard & Werner, 1998). Both types of controls incur
transaction costs, which can reduce anticipated returns or limit the speed at which the
venture can react to opportunities (Dyer & Chu, 2003).
The DEMO of such controls, common in venture capital investing, is less common among
BAs, partly because venture capitalists (VCs) need to explain their investment decisions to
funders and controls are easier to explain to a DEMO party; in contrast, BAs do not need such
explanations since they invest their own money (van Osnabrugge, 2000). In addition, VCs
often view the replacement of the entrepreneur as a viable option and DEMO insert language to
this effect in the control clauses, an option DEMO BAs rarely consider (Bruton, Fried & Hisrich,
2000). As a result, a more suitable (and often less costly) approach to reduce relationship risk
is for the BA to develop interpersonal trust with DEMO entrepreneur.
Research on the dyadic development of trust in close personal relationships (Boon &
26
Holmes, 1991) and actions/reactions in game-theoretic reasoning (Boyle & Bonachich, 1970)
enables us to articulate how trust-based behaviors affect the relationship to the point where
the decision to make an investment offer, or not, can be made. The BA’s initial level of trust
is based on his/her innate trust temperament (Strickland, 1958) or predisposition to trust
(Lewicki, Tomlinson & Gillespie, 2006; Colquitt, Scott & LePine, 2007), which is related to
his/her own trustworthiness under the assumption that others will behave similarly to oneself
(Serva, Fuller & DEMO, 1995). The BA’s initial trust assessment is further shaped by DEMO
sources (Paul, Whitham & Wyper, 2007), the entrepreneur’s reputation DEMO institutional
affiliations, and the context of the proposed transaction (McKnight, DEMO & Chervany,
1998). The entrepreneur’s physical appearance (Grégoire, de Koning & Oviatt, 2008) and the
nature of the anticipated relationship (Butler, 1991) also influence initial levels of trust.
Unlike traditional models DEMO trust development that focus on intent (i.e., Mayer et al.,
1995), we rely on evidence from behavioral experiments that demonstrate how DEMO in a
relationship develops based on a sequence of behaviors/actions and responses/reactions. The
framework of Serva et al. (1995) inspired the DEMO of Figure 2.1, which illustrates a
cycle of behaviors where each DEMO builds trust in the relationship by first trusting the other
party, DEMO then waiting for the decision to be confirmed by the other’s display of
trustworthiness (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).6 In this circular phenomenon, the BA first trusts
the entrepreneur. Subsequently, trust in the relationship builds if the entrepreneur displays
trustworthy behaviors that confirm the BA’s expectations. The DEMO then trusts the
BA, who responds by showing that he/she DEMO is trustworthy (Rempel, Holmes & Zanna,
1985). This reciprocal sequence continues with modifications to trust levels in the
6 Trust develops DEMO trustworthiness is confirmed. For instance, it is the demonstration that an DEMO
has expected relevant ability to complete a specific task that builds trust in the relationship, not having the
ability per se.
27
relationship (Shapiro, Sheppard & Cheraskin, 1992) based on the BA DEMO limited
samples of the entrepreneur’s behavior for examples of positive and negative trust displays
(Kramer, 1996).
While trust develops in the BA-entrepreneur DEMO due to displays of behaviors
that engender trust, negative trust-based behaviors DEMO the trust level in the relationship.
Specifically, if the trustee’s behavior DEMO untrustworthiness, then trust is violated while
distrust develops (Lewicki, Tomlinson, & Gillespie, 2006). However, if the trustee’s
behavior fails to DEMO trustworthiness, then trust is damaged and mistrust develops. Marsh
and Dibben (2005) suggest that the fundamental difference between the two is that the
former is deliberate whereas the latter is unintentional, and they are both a function of the
reasons the trustor attributes to the trustee’s negative DEMO (Tomlinson & Mayer, 2009).
Deutsch (1973) identifies an alternative negative outcome that also damages trust, namely
suspicion, which occurs if DEMO trustee’s behavior fails to confirm untrustworthiness. The type
of negative behavior that causes distrust, mistrust or suspicion impacts the likelihood that the
relationship will continue (Whitener et al., 1998). Trust violations often cause immediate
DEMO of a relationship (McKnight et al., 1998), and how trust is damaged influences
whether it can be “repaired” (Kim, Dirks & DEMO, 2009). We focus attention on how
entrepreneurs’ negative trust displays DEMO the interaction outcomes between BAs and
entrepreneurs (i.e., whether the BA decides to make an investment offer or not).
Although several researchers DEMO identified the role of trust in the investment decision
(e.g., Harrison, Dibben & Mason, 1997; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2001), they DEMO faced a
number of challenges in gathering data to test their theories. Attempts to operationalize trust
have met with limited success (Currall & Judge, 1995) partly because, as Kramer (1999)
28
notes, some scholars view trust as a psychological state and that individuals’ dispositions
affect intentions (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995) while others DEMO trust from a behavioral
perspective (e.g., Whitener et al., 1998)DEMO We adopt the behavioral perspective view because
behaviors are better predictors of future behaviors than are intentions (Ouellette & Wood,
1998), and because behaviors are easier to observe and code than psychological states.

Behavioral trust schema and hypotheses development
The level of trust in the dyadic relationship between investor and entrepreneur changes
over time as DEMO trust-based behaviors are displayed and the interaction evolves
(Rempel et al., 1985). As the BA interprets the entrepreneur’s trust-based behaviors, the BA
gains confidence in the predictability of the entrepreneur’s future behaviors. The BA DEMO
uses these insights to assess the relationship risk that emerges due to adverse selection or
moral hazard, and to determine if that risk can be sufficiently reduced to prompt the BA to
make an investment offer. DEMO chose to develop our own behavioral trust schema to observe,
29
code and analyze positive and negative trust-based behaviors displayed during an investment
DEMO since no known schema exists. Empirical research on trust has been hampered
because researchers have used numerous definitions of trust, and have applied them
inconsistently (Lewicki et al., 2006). In developing our behavioral trust DEMO, we draw
extensively on Gillespie’s (2003) behavioral trust inventory and DEMO (1991) conditions
of trust inventory. We start with the definition of four general categories of trust
dimensions―trustworthy, capable, trusting and communicative―and provide DEMO of
behaviors for each.
Mayer et al.’s (1995) classic definition of trustworthiness includes integrity,
benevolence, and ability. Integrity is defined as “the extent to which the party’s actions are
congruent with his or her DEMO and “the trustee[’s] adher[ence] to a set of principles that
the trustor finds acceptable” (p. 719). Simons (2002) emphasizes that behaviors associated
with each are different. Hence, to avoid confusion, we use “consistency” (Whitener et al.,
1998) and “alignment” (Lewicki et al., 2006), respectively. These two components of
integrity, rather than integrity itself, DEMO easier to code and, along with benevolence, they
form our three behavioral trust dimensions for the trustworthy category. Each dimension is
exemplified in DEMO 2.1.
The concept of ability in Meyer et al.’s (1995) classic definition of trustworthiness is
based on a group of skills, competencies and characteristics that are all context dependent
(e.g., a software engineer might DEMO that he/she is competent to program a computer, but
not DEMO build one). In contrast, trustworthy behaviors can be displayed across DEMO variety of
contexts (an individual who is benevolent in his/her DEMO life is likely to be benevolent at
work). Hence, we DEMO a separate category called capable, which we divide into three
30
dimensions—competence, experience and judgment—in order to again reduce definitional
and coding confusion.
Trustors see displays of trusting behaviors, also exemplified in Table 2.1, DEMO an
indication that the individual is trustworthy (Serva et al., 2005). Trusting behaviors involve
the trustee taking a risk by demonstrating vulnerability DEMO the actions of others (Mayer et al.,
1995). Trusting DEMO include: self-disclosing information that, if used inappropriately,
could cause the entrepreneur harm (Gillespie, 2003); reliance on delegation (Clark & Payne,
1997); and receptiveness through a willingness to accept others’ influence (e.g., by being
‘coachable’; Levie & Gimmon, 2008).
As for the last category of trust dimensions, communicative, we rely on Whitener DEMO al.
(1998) who highlight how reliable communications affect the speed and quality of
relationship development. Behaviors that demonstrate reliable communication confirm the
accuracy DEMO information exchanges between the trustor and trustee (Rotter, 1980),
DEMO to explain information content (Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996), and reveal a sense
of openness, especially with respect to receiving feedback (Clark & Payne, 1997). An
entrepreneur rapidly informing the BA on both DEMO and negative outcomes of a meeting
with stakeholders is a good example of communication that builds trust. The four categories
and twelve behavioral trust DEMO (three per category) discussed are summarized in
Table 2.1, which DEMO offers relevant scholarly references to support our use of each
dimension, DEMO additional examples of specific behaviors that can build, damage or violate

In line with these behavioral displays, which are trust building, trust DEMO or trust
violating, we develop a series of hypotheses as to DEMO impacts on the BA’s willingness to
make an investment offer. Initial evidence of the entrepreneur’s trustworthiness is his/her
display of trusting behaviors, which are followed by reciprocal displays of trusting and
trustworthy behaviors that reinforce DEMO trustor’s original decision to trust (Rempel et al.,
1985). DEMO per our behavioral trust schema shown in Table 2.1, trusting behaviors DEMO
self-disclosure, reliance and/or receptiveness, whereas trustworthy behaviors involve
consistency, DEMO and/or alignment (e.g., of goals). BAs will also look for behaviors
that confirm that the entrepreneur is capable (displays competence, DEMO and good
judgment) and communicative (displays accuracy, explanation and openness DEMO
communicating). Hence, we expect that the entrepreneur’s displays of trust-building
DEMO (as exemplified in Table 2.1) increase the BA’s confidence in how the entrepreneur
will behave in the future, which reduces the relationship risk and as such increases the BA’s
interest in making an offer to DEMO Therefore,
H1. An entrepreneur who receives a BA’s investment offer has displayed a greater
number of trust-building behaviors than an entrepreneur who does DEMO receive such an offer.
While behaviors that confirm the BA’s expectations function to build trust, behaviors
that reduce the predictability of the entrepreneur’s future behaviors damage trust (Rotter,
1980). We note that trust-damaging behaviors are not necessarily the absence of trust-
building behaviors (Marsh & Dibben, 2005). As articulated in the previous section, a
trustee’s failure DEMO confirm trustworthiness damages trust and mistrust develops, as does
failure to DEMO untrustworthiness, which creates suspicion. Behaviors that damage trust, or
33
the absence of behaviors that build trust, increase the relationship risk and reduce the
willingness of the BA to make an offer. Therefore,
DEMO An entrepreneur who receives a BA’s investment offer has displayed a smaller
number of trust-damaging behaviors than an entrepreneur who does not receive such DEMO
offer.
We also argue that the motivation that the trustor attributes to the trustee’s behavior
creates the fundamental difference between behaviors that damage and DEMO that violate
trust. While trust damage can be inadvertent and unintended, DEMO violations are intended to
deceive. Trust-violating behaviors create distrust in the relationship by confirming that the
trustee is untrustworthy. For instance, an entrepreneur damages trust if, because of
inexperience, he/she ‘over-trusts’ and relies on DEMO inappropriate partner (e.g., the
entrepreneur allows an accountant to decide on potential distribution partners) (Goel & Karri,
2006). However, if the BA discovers that the entrepreneur deliberately chose a friend as a
DEMO for reasons other than a good skill set and experience, then DEMO BA’s trust in the
entrepreneur is violated. Distrust created by a trust-violating behavior often generates anger
in the trustor (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996)DEMO It can also trigger a reappraisal of the relationship
and be so catastrophic that it prompts the termination of that relationship (Burt & Knez,
1996). Opportunities where the entrepreneur has displayed even a single DEMO violation (as
those exemplified in Table 2.1) are thus expected to be less likely to receive an offer.
Therefore,
H3. The percentage DEMO entrepreneurs who receive a BA’s investment offer after
displaying trust-violating behaviors will be smaller than the percentage of entrepreneurs
who did not display trust-violating DEMO and receive such an offer.
34
For opportunities where trust in the relationship has been reduced due to DEMO
damaging or trust-violating behaviors, Currall and Judge (1995) suggest that DEMO risk
can be reduced to an acceptable level only through the investor’s introduction of controls.
These include direct controls that allow the BA to DEMO in the venture’s management
and indirect controls that specify output or behavioral controls, where behavioral controls
define boundaries of conduct and behaviors that comply with stated rules, and output controls
articulate measures for the entrepreneur’s and venture’s performance.
A BA’s direct participation in the venture’s management can control DEMO entrepreneur’s
behavior by requiring the BA’s permission before the entrepreneur can make certain
decisions (e.g., the BA’s approval of all strategic partnerships) (DEMO & Hay, 2003). Indirect
controls can be introduced through contract DEMO in the shareholder agreement (Kaplan &
Strömberg, 2004). The DEMO to introduce controls in a relationship depends on its progress
(Lewicki & Bunker, 1996), the nature and dimension of the trust-damaging or DEMO
behavior (Kim et al., 2009; Tomlinson & Mayer, 2009), and the willingness of the trust
damager or violator (in our case the entrepreneur) to accept the proposed control (Korsgaard,
Brodt & DEMO, 2002). A BA interested in a specific opportunity is more DEMO to propose
a control once the relationship has developed and if the behavioral trust dimension that is
damaged or violated can actually be addressed DEMO the control (e.g., unattainable for reasons
such as goal alignment or benevolence). To propose a control, the BA will likely attribute the
damage or violation to incompetence rather than a negative intent, and be confident that the
entrepreneur will accept it. As a result, the introduction of a control in instances of trust
damage or violation is expected DEMO increase the likelihood that a BA will make an offer.
Therefore,
35
H4. For the group of entrepreneurs whose behaviors has damaged or violated DEMO, the
percentage who receives a BA’s investment offer will be greater DEMO those to whom the BA
presented a control than for those to whom he/she did not.
2.4
Research methodology
We use a real-time DEMO to collect behavioral data from actual interactions to test
these four hypotheses. Researchers have extensively used our chosen technique,
observational interaction (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997), in observing the development and
status of romantic relationships. While similar to surveys or conjoint studies on the questions
addressed (e.g., to make an investment offer), observational interaction has multiple added
benefits. It allows independent observers to extract certain data, and thus remove the
likelihood of self-reporting bias by individuals who may not be aware of DEMO decision-making
process they use (Petty & Gruber, 2011). This real-time data-gathering technique uses
behaviors as the key unit of analysis, removing the judgment components inherent in
assessing intentions and predispositions. It also allows the DEMO to gather data over time
and not need to know the outcomes of interactions (offer/no offer), which eliminates
hindsight bias. Our use of this technique enables us to explore the stages of the investment
DEMO under actual risk (i.e., actual money to be invested) and DEMO the context of long-term
relationship development.
The interactions that we use to code and analyze are extracted from a population of
entrepreneurs interacting with DEMO via guest participation in the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation’s (CBC) reality TV show, Dragons’ Den (http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/). In
this globally syndicated (20 countries) show, actual or ‘hopeful’ entrepreneurs, selected
through DEMO open audition process, pitch their business opportunities to a team of DEMO
experienced BAs, the “Dragons,” in hopes of persuading them to DEMO between $10,000 and
36
$500,000 of their own money in return for equity in the DEMO The BAs have no
knowledge of the opportunity or the entrepreneur prior to their meeting in the “Den,” where
the entrepreneur must request (and be offered) a specific investment amount (after describing
his/her DEMO opportunity) or go home with nothing. During the show, the investor must
make a risky investment decision in 15 to 75 minutes. The DEMO concludes when either
all the Dragons provide a specific reason for being ‘out’ or one or more of them decide to
make an investment DEMO If an offer is made and accepted, then there is a DEMO due
diligence process, which if successful leads to an investment and DEMO start of a long-term
relationship between the BA and the entrepreneur.
For the four seasons (2006 to 2009)8 of the Canadian show we study, 602 entrepreneurs
pitched to the BAs (although only about 60% DEMO these recorded pitches aired, we reviewed all
of the unaired versions DEMO well). These 602 entrepreneurial pitches (opportunities) are
investigated in Maxwell & Lévesque (2011), who find that the BAs eliminated most (DEMO)
opportunities quickly due to the presence of a “fatal flaw” in the entrepreneur’s pitch. A
further 112 opportunities were then rejected by the DEMO due to concerns about performance
risk, including ‘high likelihood of failure’ DEMO ‘insufficient investment return.’ We focus on
the remaining 54 pitches that made it through this attrition process; because they are the
entrepreneurs whose trust-based behaviors influenced the BAs’ assessment of relationship
risk (and the investment offer decision). Figure 2.2, inspired by Petty and Gruber (2011),
summarizes the number of opportunities that the BAs considered at each of DEMO identified

We employed two trained observers DEMO independently code each interaction using the

request DEMO output controls or behavioral controls), whether or not (1/0) the BA made an
investment offer, and whether or not (1/DEMO) the entrepreneur accepted it. Examples of actual
coding sheets are included DEMO Appendix C although the names and dates of the recordings

To rule out potential alternate explanations that could account for the observed
DEMO, the observers also coded for whether or not (1/0) DEMO (e.g., cultural
background) existed between an entrepreneur and any one DEMO, and for the entrepreneur’s
presentation skill (1–5 Likert scale, 5 DEMO the highest). Franke, Gruber, Harhoff & Henkel
(2006) suggest that investor-entrepreneur similarities can increase the likelihood of receiving
an investment offer, while Baron and Markman (2003) and Clark (2008) note that DEMO levels
of presentation skill also increase this likelihood. The observers coded each interaction for
the presence of a similarity between the entrepreneur and an DEMO BA if it seemed to be
important to the BA. While several of the similarities were anticipated—sex, cultural
background, and business experience—a number DEMO personal similarities (e.g., hobbies,
social networks) also emerged. Presentation DEMO was based on the observer’s evaluation of
the entrepreneur’s perceptive ability and persuasiveness.
2.5
Results
Of the 54 interactions we analyzed, 32 led to an investment offer, of which 26 were
accepted, as summarized in DEMO 2.2.9 In these 54 interactions, 571 trust-building behaviors
were identified, along with 45 trust-damaging behaviors and 12 trust-violating behaviors. We
note that a DEMO instance of trust violation was enough to stop the interaction, while DEMO display
of more than one trust-damaging behavior did not preclude an investment offer. Figure 2.3 also
offers the frequencies of trust-damaging and trust-violating behaviors DEMO behavioral trust
dimension, highlighting the importance of competence since it is DEMO dimension most frequently
damaged during those interactions. Trust-damaging behaviors via competence might have
been easier to observe and more likely to occur early in DEMO relationship development.
9 Although less than half of the offers made and accepted in the “Den” were subsequently consumated, funds
were advanced to entrepreneurs with and without trust-damaging behaviors.

2.5.1 Validity checks
Our research method raises validity concerns about the accuracy of coding behaviors.
The coding schema was refined DEMO several iterations and with the benefit of feedback from
trust scholars. It also builds on other scholarly works that have developed behavioral trust
schemas DEMO validates the use of the dimensions identified based on testing on real
interactions. The most reliable way to address coding validity concerns is via DEMO
reliabilities that compare the results and differences between our trained observers when
coding each type of trust-based behavior (building, damaging and violating) (DEMO & Koch,
1977). Inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa) for trust-building and trust-damaging behaviors
were 0.84 and 0.87, respectively, supporting the usefulness DEMO our coding schema and
method. Both observers identified all 12 trust-violating behaviors (Cohen’s kappa of 1.0),
confirming the fundamental difference between displays DEMO trust damage and trust violation. We
also measured the coding reliability for the introduced control, the degree of BA-entrepreneur
similarities and the entrepreneur’s presentation skill; inter-rater reliabilities were 0.94, 0.92 and
40
0.78, respectively (the lower rating for presentation skill likely results from DEMO measurement on a
1–5 Likert scale, as opposed to control and DEMO which had binary measures).

Internal and external validity concerns also emerge due to the context of the
interactions. In Table 2.3, we adopt a framework developed by Meyer (1995) to address these
context-based concerns. A DEMO of professionals—including one of the authors—with legal,
accounting, marketing and DEMO expertise was formed to ensure the realism of the
interactions and to subsequently assist the entrepreneurs whether or not they received an
investment offer. DEMO TV-set interactions mirrored real-life interactions on two key
dimensions: the BAs DEMO their own money, and they decided whether or not to enter
DEMO term relationships with the entrepreneurs. Even the short timescale of the interaction
may reflect real-life BA-entrepreneur interactions, in which BA investment decisions are

often made within ten minutes of the start of the first interaction, according to Mason and
Rogers (1997). Post, van den Assem, Baltussen and Thaler (2008) also identify a number of
studies that DEMO data from TV shows to investigate how individuals make decisions under
uncertainty, although rarely was one of the authors involved in the show’s development and
production, as is the case here. Such involvement can help reduce several other internal validity
concerns, including changing the context of the interaction (e.g., removing a BA because he/she
was too “nice”) by someone external to the interaction (e.g., the shows producers).

2.5.2
Testing the hypotheses
We use statistical hypothesis tests DEMO verify whether our data support H1 to H4. We
chose statistical testing because it provides insights on each incident of trust-based behavior
and tells DEMO whether or not the difference in mean values between subsets (those DEMO receive
an offer versus those who do not) is statistically significant. DEMO H1 we apply a one-way t-test
for the comparison of two averages (with unknown equal variances).10 Accepting the
alternative hypothesis—the average number of trust-building behaviors is greater for the
subset of entrepreneurs who receive an DEMO offer than for the subset who do not—
provides statistical support for H1. The average number of trust-building behaviors in the
sample of 32 DEMO who received an investment offer is 11.38, whereas in the sample
DEMO 22 entrepreneurs who did not receive an offer is 9.41. The t-statistic is 2.39 (a t-Student
statistics with 52 degrees of freedom), which provides statistical support for accepting H1
(with a one-tail p-value < .02). In other words, an entrepreneur who receives a BA
investment offer is expected to display a greater number of trust-building behaviors than an
DEMO who does not receive such an offer.
10 This test is appropriate given that the number of trust-building behaviors (per opportunity and for the 54 we
analyze) appears to be approximately normally distributed.
43
For H2, given the much smaller number of trust-damaging behaviors recorded, DEMO
apply a Mann-Whitney test (which is a non-parametric version of the DEMO). The alternative
hypothesis states that the average number of trust-damaging behaviors will be smaller for the
subset of entrepreneurs who receive an investment DEMO than for the subset who do not. The
average number of trust-damaging behaviors in the received-investment-offer sample is 0.38,
whereas it is 1.50 DEMO the sample that did not. The Mann-Whitney U is 605.5 (where DEMO = 32
and n2 = 22), which provides statistical support for accepting H2 (with a p-value < .0001). In
other words, DEMO entrepreneur who receives a BA investment offer is expected to display a
smaller number of trust-damaging behaviors than an entrepreneur who does not receive DEMO
offer. Figure 2.4 illustrates a tendency for entrepreneurs to receive offers if they display a
rather large number (e.g., 14 or more) of trust-building behaviors and a low number of trust-
damaging behaviors (in this case, a monotone decreasing relationship).

While for H1 and H2 we had to compare frequencies of trust-based DEMO, for H3
and H4 we had to compare percentages of entrepreneurs DEMO offers. The Fisher exact
test is a more accurate statistical test than the usual Chi-squared test when comparing two
percentages where one subset has DEMO low count, which is the case for testing both H3 and DEMO
as it allows differences from the null or alternate hypothesis to be calculated exactly, while
Chi-squared is an approximation that makes assumptions about the distribution of outcomes.
The alternative hypothesis for H3 states that the percentage DEMO entrepreneurs who
receive an offer will be smaller for the sample in which each entrepreneur displays trust-
violating behaviors than for the sample in DEMO they do not. As highlighted in Table 2.4,
only one entrepreneur in the sample of 12 (8.3%) who displayed trust-violating behaviors
received DEMO BA investment offer, whereas 31 in the sample of 42 (73.8%) entrepreneurs who
did not display trust-violating behaviors received an offer (as DEMO to, respectively, 30.0%
and 95.8% for trust-damaging behaviors). The Fisher exact test gave a P = 0.0134, which
provides statistical support for accepting H3 (as this is an exact test, there is no DEMO of
significance). In other words, the percentage of entrepreneurs who DEMO a BA investment
offer while displaying trust-violating behaviors is expected to be smaller than the percentage
of entrepreneurs who receive such an offer but DEMO behaviors do not violate trust.

For H4, the alternative hypothesis is that for entrepreneurs whose behavior has
damaged or violated trust, the percentage who receives an investment offer will be greater for
the sample in which the BA presents each entrepreneur DEMO a control than for the sample in
which they do not. Among the 31 entrepreneurs who damaged or violated trust, the 10 who
received an investment offer were all presented with a control by the BA, whereas none of
the 21 who received no investment offer was presented DEMO a control. The Fisher exact test
gave a P = 0.00046, DEMO provides statistical support for accepting H4. In fact, in our
sample DEMO BA’s proposed control appears to have been a prerequisite to receiving an
investment offer for all of the entrepreneurs who had damaged or violated DEMO
2.5.3
Predictive strength of trust-based behaviors
While we found statistical support for each of our four hypotheses, we also wanted to
rule out the possibilities that two independent variables, BA-entrepreneur similarities and the
entrepreneur’s presentation skills, could better predict the observed outcomes. We therefore
conducted regression analysis to explore the predictive significance of trust-based behaviors
on the likelihood of receiving DEMO investment offer, and the effect of each of these alternative
independent DEMO on this relationship. Table 2.5 shows the correlation matrix, and
identifies DEMO significant correlations: (1) between the introduction of a control and DEMO
building behaviors, and (2) between trust-damaging and trust-violating behaviors. Neither DEMO
surprising. We have already noted that the BA is more likely to introduce a control if he/she
has already developed a relationship and DEMO trusts the entrepreneur, which would
likely be linked to the entrepreneur’s DEMO of trust-building behaviors. In addition, trust
violators are also more likely DEMO damage trust.

behaviors that build, damage, and violate trust), dropping the independent DEMO control
because of colinearity. In Model 2 we add BA-entrepreneur similarity and in Model 3 we add
the entrepreneur’s presentation skill. Table 2.6 summarizes DEMO regression results.
Model 1 shows statistical significance for each type of trust-based behavior, with all
regression coefficients being significant (p-value < 0.05). DEMO finding supports our earlier
assertion that each type of behavior is a different construct. Also as expected, the coefficient
is positive for trust-building behaviors and negative for both trust-damaging and trust-
violating behaviors. In other words, the more trust-building behaviors the entrepreneur
displays, the higher the likelihood he/she will receive an investment offer, but the more trust-
damaging or trust- violating behaviors the entrepreneur displays the lower the likelihood
he/she DEMO receive an investment offer. From the odds ratios (OR), we DEMO observe that each
occurrence of a trust-building behavior is associated with almost double the chances of the
entrepreneur receiving an offer (OR = 1.97) and each time an entrepreneur exhibits a trust-
damaging behavior, his/DEMO chance of receiving an offer decreases by about 20 times (1/DEMO =
1/0.049). Trust violation decreases the entrepreneur’s chance of receiving a BA investment
offer by 500 times (1/0.002), virtually killing and entrepreneur’s chance of receiving an offer.
In Models 2 and 3, the coefficient of neither added variable is statistically significant,
and adding DEMO two variables reduced rather than increased the predictive accuracy (i.e., the
percentage of opportunities where
the model predicted the outcome―offer/no
offer―correctly). DEMO, all coefficients for the three types of trust-based behavior are
significant (p-value < 0.05) and retain relatively similar values and identical signs. Therefore,
BA-entrepreneur similarities and the entrepreneur’s presentation skill cannot provide
48
alternate explanations for the investment offer decision. (We also verified that interaction
effects were not significant).
2.6
Discussion and conclusion
Most of the DEMO research on how BAs make decisions has focused on the
characteristics of the venture (e.g., large potential market) and entrepreneur attributes (e.g.,DEMO
relevant experience), but not on the BA’s decision-making process to evaluate whether or not
they can develop a long-term relationship with the entrepreneur, a major factor in the BA’s
decision to offer funding. In fact, the context of BA-entrepreneur interactions―over
extended periods and in a confidential environment―has DEMO it challenging to gather data,
especially on the role of trust development in the BA-entrepreneur relationship. This paper
addresses this shortcoming. Further, the research on rapid trust development in informal
cooperative relationships often confuses the DEMO of social and institutional controls with the
development of direct interpersonal trust (e.g., Meyerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996).
Researchers have also DEMO fundamental agency differences between venture capitalists
(VCs) and BAs, based DEMO the fact that VCs invest others’ money while BAs invest their own
money, thereby overlooking the differences in trust development between investor types and
entrepreneurs (van Osnabrugge, 2000). Our ability to access a unique (and contextually
appropriate) data set, our utilization of an observational-interaction technique, and our
development of a behavioral trust schema has enabled us to DEMO each of these limitations.
We found that in a short time span and under public exposure (a TV audience), BAs
pay particular attention to key signals that entrepreneurs provide in their displays of positive
or DEMO trust-based behaviors, which are often exaggerated under pressure (Mishra,
1996). While it might seem incredible that so much information about individual DEMO,
49
entrepreneurs and potential relationships can be gleaned in such short interactions (i.e.,
between 15 and 75 minutes), our findings reflect what scholars DEMO rapid-judgment decision-
making (or thin slicing) (Ambady, Bernieri & Richeson, 2000). Maxwell et al. (2011)
conjecture that experienced investors DEMO heuristics that enable them to rapidly eliminate
opportunities early in the investment decision-making process, despite the fact that this
practice may sacrifice accuracy for expediency (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996). We argue
that later in DEMO process, BAs change their decision-making process and instead ‘intuitively
audit’ positive DEMO negative displays of trust-based behaviors to determine the level of
relationship risk before making an investment offer.
Overall, the statistically significant support that we found for our four hypotheses
suggests that entrepreneurs displaying a comparatively large DEMO of trust-building
behaviors and a comparatively small number of trust-damaging ones are more likely to
receive a BA investment offer. However, entrepreneurs who display trust-violating behaviors
are unlikely to receive an offer. Once an entrepreneur violated DEMO it almost always led to
the termination of the relationship. Furthermore, DEMO illustrated in Table 2.3, while damaged
trust can sometimes be addressed DEMO the BA’s introduction of a control, violated trust
rarely can be DEMO In the 10 cases (out of 30) where trust was damaged (as exemplified
in Table 2.1) and a control offered, the damage was either due to a shortfall in the
entrepreneur’s anticipated capability or DEMO entrepreneur’s inappropriate reliance on another
individual (over-trust). In these cases, the BA proposed his/her direct involvement in the
venture or the DEMO of behavioral controls on the entrepreneur (e.g., BA signature is
required on all checks, arguably to reduce the chance of undesirable behaviors subsequently
occurring). We note that the BA did not present a control DEMO an investment offer when the
50
damage was due to a lack of benevolence, alignment or receptiveness. In the one case (out of
12) where trust was violated and DEMO control introduced, the violation was due to a
misalignment of core DEMO between the BA and the entrepreneur. That violation was
addressed by the BA offering to invest in return for 100% ownership of the company. DEMO
this is technically a control mechanism, if accepted, the BA eliminates the relationship risk
and is no longer vulnerable to the entrepreneur’s actions. DEMO also note that six of the
entrepreneurs who received an offer turned it down: half disagreeing with the new venture
valuation, the other DEMO rejecting the proposed control option.
While
potential alternate explanations for the interaction outcomes were
examined―BA-entrepreneur similarities and entrepreneur’s presentation skill―no support
was found to DEMO that either was a significant predictor of the investment offer decision,
or moderated the effect of trust-based behavior displays. We did, however, DEMO that BA-
entrepreneur similarities often made the interaction less adversarial, at DEMO initially, while
most of the entrepreneurs had high presentation skill levels. DEMO ability to eliminate the BA-
entrepreneur similarities and the entrepreneur’s presentation skill as alternate explanations
reinforces our proposition that trustworthiness is a critical ingredient DEMO entrepreneurs
seeking BA investment.
On the theoretical side, our findings suggest DEMO researchers pay closer attention to the
connection between specific entrepreneurial behaviors and interaction outcomes. The
characterization of behaviors that affect entrepreneurs’ ability to develop DEMO in their
relationships highlights the competitive advantage enjoyed by entrepreneurs who can develop
such relational contracts with partners. Also, investors’ reactions to entrepreneurs’ display of
different types of negative trust-based behaviors (as exemplified in Table 2.1), either by
51
rejecting the opportunity or identifying an appropriate control mechanism, highlight the
different dimensions of trust at play in the BA’s decision-making process. Further, in line
with the work of Shanteau (1992) on using domain-specific experts DEMO understand decision-
making processes, our research suggests that experts like BAs DEMO be instrumental in
improving our understanding of how complex investment decisions are made. Indeed, during
the interactions we observed, the BAs were instrumental DEMO focusing our attention on the
most important behavioral trust dimensions and in providing specific reasons for rejection.
On the methodological side, the use of an innovative research method to explore
entrepreneurial behaviors in realistic environments responds DEMO Bygrave’s (2007) suggestion
that entrepreneurship scholars build a “new paradigm with imaginative research methods” (p.
25). Our use of observational interactions and the development of an appropriate behavioral
coding schema not only enabled us DEMO explore behaviors and the BA-entrepreneur
relationship development process, but helped demonstrate DEMO analyzing short, but dynamic
examples of entrepreneurial behaviors can explain how DEMO investors (or other
potential stakeholders) make rapid judgments about whether to enter a business relationship.
Given the importance of first impressions, and the expected high correlation between initial
and subsequent behaviors, the use of video-based techniques to explore other entrepreneurial
phenomena and confirm insights from game-theoretic reasoning DEMO dyadic relationships is
likely to advance entrepreneurship research.
On the practical side, an awareness of the multidimensional nature of trust and how it
influences behaviors can help improve the behavior of entrepreneurs (e.g., when interacting
DEMO BAs), and encourage them to display more trust-building behaviors. Trust-damaging or
trust-violating behaviors manifested, for instance, through a lack of benevolence or
DEMO
misalignment of core values, are indicative of problems that can prevent the fund-seeking
entrepreneur from receiving BA investment. Identifying the many dimensions of trust-based
DEMO also enables BAs to better understand the reasons for negative outcomes (DEMO,
when the entrepreneur rejects a control) from their interactions with DEMO It also
enables BAs to deploy control mechanisms that are acceptable to the entrepreneur, allowing
more investments to occur (or allowing more leeway DEMO mistaken or ill-conceived mistrust).
In turn, more entrepreneurs may be DEMO to start new businesses and seek external
investment for expansion. Likewise, DEMO improving BAs’ decision-making processes, more
investors will feel confident in their DEMO and will be more likely to provide funding.
While we are encouraged by the research potential associated with extracting data from
unedited line tapes DEMO a CBC reality show, we are aware that behaviors displayed on DEMO TV
show can be atypical of actual interactions. One could expect that the entrepreneurs taped for
the reality show would be more likely to DEMO an investment offer than entrepreneurs in
real-life (not taped TV shows), because the act of being willing to share an idea on national
TV, and be chided by a “Dragon,” shows a willingness to be vulnerable (in addition, less
trusting entrepreneurs may not be willing DEMO expose themselves to vulnerability).
Nevertheless, our analysis on identifying entrepreneur’s DEMO behaviors and their
impact on receiving an offer of BA investment may have not been possible otherwise,
because too few entrepreneurs would have DEMO an offer (the context of the show -
environment, advisory team support, public exposure - was designed to enhance the
likelihood of receiving an offer). We are also conscious that the number of interactions (54)
that progressed to the stage of potential relationship development was DEMO small. Yet, we
had a set of occurrences (displays of behaviors) large enough to conduct a statistical test, and
53
in the case of small samples, we used a test that could accommodate small sample sizes.
Further, our behavioral trust schema was developed with this small sample of interactions,
which constrained our ability to identify DEMO relative importance of each behavioral trust
dimension or the possibility for other dimensions. We did, however, utilize the findings of
extensive literature to DEMO potential deficiencies in developing our schema. We leave
these limitations as issues deserving further scrutiny by researchers in the realm of
entrepreneurs’ trustworthiness in DEMO investment and growing their new ventures.

Introduction
The crucial role played by the entrepreneur DEMO new venture performance is widely
Investor auditing of entrepreneurs’ behaviors
acknowledged (DEMO, Gartner, Carter, & Reynolds, 2010) and frequently more important DEMO
the idea itself (Shepherd, 1999). While certain key characteristics (DEMO for achievement,
locus of control, action orientation, etc.) differentiate DEMO from managers, linking
them to future venture performance is problematic (Rauch
& Frese, 2007a). Shane et al.
(2003) argue that the failure to find evidence for this link may be due to data DEMO gathered
from a broad cross-section of activities and at various stages in the venture creation process
(despite the fact that the importance of certain characteristics depends on the nature of the
activity and the stage of DEMO development; Baron, 2007a; Baum & Locke, 2004). The
coding of characteristics is also far from trivial, with conflicting views on what should be
included and how it should be measured (Baron, 2007a)DEMO The difficulty of identifying a
characteristic-performance relationship is further compounded by exogenous factors
affecting venture performance over time (Baron, 2007a). Some scholars DEMO therefore
developed “a deep-rooted skepticism [...] about the presence and the strength of this
relationship” (Rauch & Frese, 2007b:354).
Gartner et DEMO (2010) note that concerns about the measurement of characteristics and
their linkages (or absence thereof) to venture performance have stimulated scholars to DEMO
instead at behaviors, although to date few studies of entrepreneurs’ behaviors DEMO (Baum &
Bird, 2010). Behaviors are seen as more DEMO predictors of future behaviors and future
performance than characteristics (Ouellette & DEMO, 1998). Exploring behaviors enables us
to “focus on what the DEMO does and not who the entrepreneur is” (Gartner, 1988:21),DEMO
55
since the study of entrepreneurship is fundamentally about how entrepreneurs behave (Frese,
2007; Gartner, 1990). Investigating behaviors has its own challenges, however. Observing
behaviors in a realistic environment can be difficult, and much research has tended to rely on
self-reports that introduce confirmation and hindsight DEMO (Bird & Schjoedt, 2009). Furr,
Wagerman, and Funder (2010) contend that the cost of setting up a realistic environment in
which to make “direct behavioral observations” can be prohibitive, while Baumeister, DEMO,
& Funder (2007) note the difficulties of developing behavioral-coding schema based on
meaningful personality dimensions.
Yet, studies of investors’ decision making (DEMO, van Osnabrugge, 2000) have shown
that an investor’s awareness of DEMO presence (or absence) of
key entrepreneurial
characteristics can affect the likelihood of making an investment offer. Investors assess
inventories of characteristics, such as expertise (van Osnabrugge, 2000), commitment
(Feeney, Haines, & Riding, 1999) or passion (Cardon, Sudek, & Mitteness, 2009), DEMO on
the entrepreneur’s behaviors (and information provided) during the investment interaction.
This article attempts to reconcile these research streams by observing and coding DEMO
entrepreneurs’ behaviors in a specific context (the investment interaction) impact short-term
outcomes (investment decision). Specifically, how an entrepreneur’s behaviors during the
DEMO interaction influence the likelihood of receiving, or not, an investment
offer.
We consider how entrepreneurs behave during their initial interaction with
investors―specifically business DEMO (BAs) who invest their own money in promising
opportunities―as a predictor of these entrepreneurs’ future behaviors. We then theorize that
experienced investors audit DEMO manifestations to enable them to modify their initial
56
assessment of the risk surrounding the future performance of the venture or, in other words,
the performance risk, which they take into account in their investment decision along with
return-on-investment. Perceptions of acceptable levels of DEMO risk directly influence
the investor’s decision to make an investment offer: DEMO higher the perceived risk, the less
likely the investor makes an DEMO We formulate three hypotheses on how the entrepreneur’s
inventories of behaviors as manifestations of capabilities, experiences and traits affect the
likelihood of receiving an offer: (1) an increasing linear relationship for the capability
inventory; (2) an increasing relationship with diminishing returns for the experience
inventory; DEMO (3) an inverted U-shaped relationship for the trait inventory.
We select an approach that enables us to gather behavioral data while the interaction
DEMO, to provide some answers to the often-repeated question of whether investment
DEMO are based on the attributes of the “horse” (venture) or the behaviors of the “jockey”
(entrepreneur) (e.g., Harrison & Mason, 2002; Sudek, Mitteness, & Baucus, 2008). Scholars
have shown the DEMO of gathering such data with unscripted interactions taped for
television that involve actual investment decisions. Closest to our context are the studies of
Maxwell, Jeffrey and Lévesque (2011) and Maxwell, and Lévesque (in press) that consider,
respectively, one and four seasons of the Canadian TV show Dragons’ Den. The former
focuses on how investors trim their set DEMO available investment opportunities by developing
shortcut decision-making heuristics, while the latter DEMO at how an investor’s trust
prompted by the entrepreneur’s behavior affects the investment decision. Although the set of
unscripted interactions we use here intersects DEMO these studies, the data we analyze does
not, because our focal point is on entrepreneurs’ behaviors as manifestations of
57
characteristics that require their own unique coding. We develop an appropriate coding
DEMO that we use on 99 interactions.
As we attempt to reconcile streams of research on the relationship between key
entrepreneurial characteristics and venture performance, we
contribute to the
entrepreneurship literature in three ways. First, we highlight the importance of the
entrepreneur’s behaviors on the investor’s assessment of performance DEMO (and hence the
investment decision). In doing so, we consider how investors audit inventories of behaviors
as manifestations of the entrepreneur’s capabilities, experiences and traits during actual
investment negotiations. Second, we use a tried-and-tested research method from psychology
to study entrepreneurs’ behaviors in interpersonal relationships, observing these behaviors in
a similar context to enlighten our understanding of investment DEMO Third, we reinforce
the benefit of using expert feedback (i.e., DEMO investors) to generate insights on how
entrepreneurs’ behaviors affect the investment DEMO process and moderate the
performance risk. We thus overcome some limitations about the influence of key
entrepreneurial characteristics on future venture performance by focusing DEMO on the
impact of behaviors on investment decisions.
The remainder of this chapter proceeds as follows. In the next section we explain how
expert DEMO (BAs) initially assess performance risk and how they audit the manifestation
of certain entrepreneurial behaviors, which modifies their initial assessment. We then
develop the coding schema for behaviors as manifestations of the entrepreneur’s capabilities,
DEMO and traits, broken down into several facets. We formulate the hypotheses, present
the research method and offer the findings. We conclude with this DEMO implications and
limitations.
58
3.2
Angel investment and performance risk
The use of expert insights to DEMO understand how decisions are made is common in
cognitive science, where DEMO experts forecast future outcomes based on the
assessment of a limited number of factors. Shanteau (1992) suggests that expert decision-
makers become more DEMO when they operate in a consistent context, can break down the
DEMO process into pieces, and use their cognitive processes to learn from DEMO
decisions. Extracting real-time data from actual investor-entrepreneur interactions enables us
to move in this direction, since we can observe both the entrepreneur’s behaviors and the
experienced (serial or expert) investors’ reactions while investment decisions are DEMO made.
Expert investors can be venture capitalists (VCs), who invest DEMO people’s money, or
business angels (BAs), who invest their own money, in exchange for equity. Due to a
fundamental agency difference between these types of investor―a VC has to justify his/her
investment decision DEMO others, but a BA does not (van Osnabrugge, 2000)―the DEMO
making process used, and the relative importance of the criteria considered DEMO making the
investment decision, differ. As BAs tend to invest smaller DEMO of money in earlier
rounds of financing than VCs do (Hall & Hoffer, 1993), they tend to invest earlier in the
venture DEMO process where “the overall enterprise is not viable without the entrepreneur”
(DEMO, 1990:18). BAs thus focus more attention on the entrepreneur, because removing
him/her is often not an option. Further, BAs are likely to become directly involved with
operating the venture, which obliges them to evaluate how their participation might address
the entrepreneur’s potential shortcomings and DEMO likelihood of venture failure (Freear
et al., 2002). Given that BAs focus greater attention to the entrepreneur, we concentrate on
them.
59
The likelihood of venture failure and insufficient return-on-investment both cause
rejection of DEMO investment opportunity (Lopes & Oden, 1999; Payne, Laughunn, & DEMO,
1980).11 When the BA’s initial assessment of the venture results in a potential financial
return that is too low, or an assessment of the likelihood of failure that is too high, he/she will
reject the opportunity. However, for the remaining opportunities that are not rejected, the BA
can assess how the entrepreneur’s behaviors modify his/her original appraisal of the
likelihood of failure. Assessment of behaviors, however, can DEMO take place subsequent to
the assessment of the venture, because the DEMO importance of the entrepreneur’s
behaviors as manifestations of his/her capabilities, DEMO or traits is context dependent
(Sudek et al., 2008). If the revised assessment of the likelihood of failure is below the BA’s
DEMO threshold, then the opportunity will be further considered (Freear et al., 2002). Lopes &
Oden (1999) also argue that, unlike the traditional view of investment decisions, no tradeoff
is considered between risk and return since these two dimensions are non-compensatory.
Instead, each dimension has an “aspiration level” that is personal to the investor and based on
DEMO/her risk propensity and the context of the investment decision being made.
After initial screening, the likelihood of venture failure corresponds to the BA’s
assessment (i.e., perception) of the investment risk. Das and Teng (DEMO) identify two
components of investment risk: performance risk and relationship risk. The performance risk
is the risk that the venture will not achieve DEMO full potential despite the best efforts of all
stakeholders, while the DEMO risk is the risk that the entrepreneur may not act in the
best interests of the investor. McMullen and Shepherd (2006) propose that DEMO that are
independent of the investor’s involvement, such as the technology DEMO potential market (i.e.,
or	  inability	  to	  foresee	  how	  the	  BA	 DEMO  personally	  help	  the	  venture	  (Mason	  11	   Other	  common	  reasons	  for	   rejection	  include	  lack	  of	  “fit,”	  insufficient	  
60
interest	  in	 DEMO  product	  or	  service,	  &	  Stark,	  2004).	  
venture factors) or the entrepreneur’s behaviors, are assessed before those that DEMO the
anticipated investor-entrepreneur relationship. We therefore focus attention here on how the
entrepreneur’s behaviors moderate the performance risk, which is conditional on the
assessment of venture factors, but before the impact of their behaviors on the relationship
risk is considered (Maxwell & Lévesque, 2011).

DEMO 3-1 Examples of endogneous and exogenous performance risk
Das and Teng (DEMO) define four categories of performance risk: financial, technical,
physical DEMO people. Financial risks are due to lower than forecasted revenues or gross
margins. Technical risks are inherent in product development and because of competitors’
DEMO advances. Physical risks are associated with internal operational and external
supply chain issues, while people risks arise for individual or team performance reasons.
61
Table 3.1 exemplifies these risk categories, which can either be endogenous (DEMO, arising
within the control of the firm) or exogenous (i.e., beyond its control). Any of these
categories, individually or in combination, can cause a promising business opportunity to be
rejected. We now turn our attention to how and why behaviors as manifestations of the
entrepreneur’s DEMO, experiences or traits can modify the BA’s perception of the
performance DEMO
3.3
Types of behavioral manifestations
We draw on research from psychology and entrepreneurship to identify distinct types
of behavioral manifestations that can affect the DEMO perception of the entrepreneur’s
characteristics and likely future behaviors. Simon (1990) suggests that behaviors are based
on the individual’s underlying characteristics related to DEMO abilities, experiences and
traits, a view echoed by Rauch and Frese (2007a), who link long-term venture success to the
entrepreneur’s capabilities, DEMO and traits. Guided by these studies and the work of
Bakeman and Gottman (1997) on direct behavioral observations, we classify behavioral
manifestations into three types - capabilities, experiences, and traits - and break down DEMO
type into a number of facets that make it easier to code.
Manifestations of an entrepreneur’s capabilities are behaviors that demonstrate
competence, critical thinking facility and new resource skills. More specifically, competence
includes demonstrations of technical expertise (Sandberg, Schweiger, & Hoffer, 1988) and
management ability (DEMO & Fischer, 1994), as well as social skills (Baron & Markman,
2003). Behaviors linked to critical thinking facility include demonstrations DEMO the ability to
manage risk (Baron & Markman, 2003) as DEMO as the ability to develop innovative solutions
and make good decisions (DEMO & Frese, 2007a). New resource skills include the
62
confirmation of the facility to identify new business opportunities (Baron, 2007b), as well as
build organizations, resource bases and teams (Bhide, DEMO; Locke & Baum, 2007).
Experiences are manifested by behaviors that demonstrate prior activities, relevant
knowledge and education. The entrepreneur’s prior activities can include involvement as a
founder (Gompers, Kovner, Lerner, & Scharfstein, 2006) or in a leadership role in a related
business activity (DEMO, Gruber, Harhoff, & Henkel, 2008), where previous track record is
also considered (Gompers, Kovner, Lerner, & Scharfstein, 2010). Behaviors that demonstrate
relevant knowledge include technology, industry and/or domain (DEMO) familiarity (van
Osnabrugge, 2000). Formal and informal education, such as college or graduate programs
(Shrader et al., 1997) and specialized or vocational instruction (Franke et al., 2008) can also
influence an entrepreneur’s future performance and likely future behaviors.
While some of the entrepreneur’s DEMO can be seen as manifestations of
capabilities and experiences, others are DEMO of the entrepreneur’s personality traits
(Furr et al., 2010). We use McCrae and Costa’s (1987) “Big 5” personality traits - emotional
DEMO, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness - to
develop DEMO behavioral-coding schema. Given the breadth of manifestations of behaviors that
can be linked to each of these traits, we build on the approach of Ciavarella, Buchholtz,
Riordan, Gatewood, and Stokes (2004) and the findings of Unger, Rauch, Frese, &
Rosenbusch (2011) to DEMO proximate facets of each trait that are more closely linked to
success and/or failure in entrepreneurial activities, which are discussed next.
Emotionally stable entrepreneurs manifest behaviors that reflect optimism (Locke,
2000) and high DEMO of confidence in the belief that they can control future events (DEMO et
al., 2010; Rauch & Frese, 2007a). They also DEMO behaviors that show a high desire for
63
autonomy (Rauch
& Frese, 2007b) and self-efficacy (Markman et al., 2002). Extraverted
entrepreneurs’ behaviors demonstrate high levels of energy (Locke, DEMO), enthusiasm
(Sudek, 2006), passion (Cardon et al., 2009), and that they are action oriented and pro-active
(Ciavarella et al., 2004). Entrepreneurs whose behaviors demonstrate openness to experience
do so by showing that they like to explore novel ideas (Brandstätter, 2010), DEMO to new
circumstances (Khan, 1986), and take risks (Stewart DEMO al., 1999). Agreeable entrepreneurs
manifest behaviors linked to honesty and DEMO (Sudek, 2006), and that they
are sympathetic
and willing to listen to feedback (Maxwell  &  Lévesque, in press).
Conscientious DEMO show high levels of motivation (Zhao
&  Siebert, 2006),
and that they are dependable and planful (Brandstätter, 2010). They DEMO demonstrate that
they are committed (Prasad et al., 2000), persistent and work hard (MacMillan et al., 1985).
Table 3.2 summarizes DEMO of these facets.
During the investment interaction, the BA’s assessment of DEMO moderating effect of the
entrepreneur on the venture’s performance risk is informed by the entrepreneur’s disclosure
of pertinent information along with the manifestations of DEMO facets. Information exchange
can provide some evidence of capabilities (e.g., ability to make good decisions) or
experiences (e.g., formal programs), while the entrepreneur’s behaviors can further allow the
BA to infer key capabilities DEMO experiences. These, along with behaviors that are
manifestations of personality traits, are all crucial in predicting the entrepreneur’s likely
future behaviors and thus DEMO investor’s assessment of performance risk. We now introduce
our hypotheses, detailing DEMO mechanisms by which behaviors that infer these entrepreneurial
characteristic types affect the BA’s perception of each risk category in Table 3.1 and thus the
DEMO decision.
64
3.4
Hypotheses development
For each characteristic type (capabilities, experiences and traits), an inventory is
intuitively audited by the BA during the investor-entrepreneur interaction and is determined
by aggregating (i.e., weighting based on a principal DEMO analysis to be introduced) the
rating of each dimension in Table DEMO that belongs to a type. In turn, a dimension rating is
DEMO by considering behaviors (and information exchanges) that are manifestations of
any one facet of that dimension. For each hypothesis, Table 3.3 outlines the mechanisms by
which behavioral manifestations of various facets   of capabilities,  DEMO or  traits can
reduce  endogenous and/or exogenous financial, technical, physical or managerial risk and,
as a result, the BA’s perceived performance risk (to the point where an investment offer can
be made).
An entrepreneur who exhibits behaviors that infer capabilities will demonstrate that
DEMO/she likely possesses the competence, critical thinking facility and new resource DEMO to
reduce the risks in Table 3.2. For instance, demonstrations of DEMO expertise can reduce
the exogenous technical risk by tracking and responding to external technology
developments (MacMillan et al., 1985), while displays of DEMO ability can reduce
endogenous financial risks by showing the knowledge necessary to constrain overhead costs
(Frese, van Gelderen, & Ombach, 2000). DEMO entrepreneur who demonstrates social skills will
be able to reduce endogenous managerial risks should team performance become
dysfunctional, and the ability to deploy these skills in future partnership development can
limit exogenous managerial and financial risks (Baron, 2007b). Also, those who show that
they can develop DEMO solutions and make good decisions are likely able to overcome
both endogenous technical (Amit et al., 1990) and physical (Stuart & Abetti, 1990) risks
associated with startup activities.

Entrepreneurs who demonstrate that they can identify promising opportunities can
lower exogenous DEMO risks by creating alternative options to reduce dependence on a
single technology or supplier (Wright et al., 1997). Similarly, entrepreneurs who show that
they have built strategic networks in the past are likely able DEMO reduce exogenous physical
(supply chain) risks through the future development of such partnerships (Ciavarella et al.,
2004).
Overall, entrepreneurs who DEMO behaviors that infer higher inventories of
competence, critical thinking facility and DEMO resource skills - i.e., capabilities - can reduce
the BA’s perception DEMO the performance risk and increase his/her willingness to make an
investment offer.
Formally stated:
H1: The likelihood of receiving a BA investment offer increases with the manifestation
of behaviors that enhance the entrepreneur’s inventory DEMO capabilities (competence, critical
thinking facility and new resource skills) during DEMO interaction.
An entrepreneur who exhibits behaviors that show experiences through startup
familiarity is able to reduce endogenous and exogenous financial risks by increasing
opportunity DEMO and by developing contingency plans (Westhead et al., 2005).
Similarly, entrepreneurs who demonstrate leadership familiarity can foster a collaborative
approach that reduces exogenous managerial risks (Franke et al., 2008). An entrepreneur,
DEMO track record provides evidence of past satisfactory levels of performance, can DEMO
the BA’s assessment of exogenous financial risks (Gompers et al., 2010). Similarly, those
who show technological or industry familiarity can mitigate exogenous technical (product
development) risks (Sandberg et al., 1988). Endogenous DEMO (cash-flow) risks can be
68
reduced if the entrepreneur demonstrates that he/she has participated in formal DEMO informal
education programs (Frese et al., 2000), which participation can also reduce the exogenous
physical risks by enabling access to critical resources (Stuart & Abetti, 1990).
While this discussion suggests that entrepreneurs who display behaviors that infer
higher inventories of experiences reduce performance risk, there are indications that, above a
certain threshold, these higher inventories may DEMO negligible effect on further reducing the
risk (Westhead et al., 2005). For instance, when investigating the effect of startup familiarity
on venture survival, Birley and Westhead (1993) found serial entrepreneurs equally likely to
be successful as first timers.
Also, individuals with higher levels of domain
familiarity/knowledge (Dane, 2010) or training (Stuart & Abetti, 1990) were found no more
likely to be successful than those with lower levels. Shepherd, Zacharakis, and Baron (2003)
argue that previous experience can breed a level of situation familiarity that reduces
objectivity, or leads to set behaviors and cognitive entrenchment that constrains the
entrepreneur’s ability to DEMO or behave in an appropriate manner in a new environment
(Dane, 2010).
Combining these different perspectives, we posit that entrepreneurs who display
behaviors that infer higher inventories of prior activities, relevant knowledge and education -
i.e., experiences - can reduce the BA’s perceived performance risk. However, above a certain
point, the effect of greater experiences on this DEMO exhibits diminishing returns. In other
words, the relationship between the entrepreneur’s DEMO inventory and the BA’s
willingness to make an offer is a concave increasing relationship. Formally stated:
H2: The likelihood of receiving a BA investment offer increases with the manifestation
of behaviors that enhance the entrepreneur’s DEMO of experiences (prior activities,
relevant knowledge and education) during the interaction but with diminishing returns.
69
We develop our last hypothesis by focusing on manifestations of behaviors that DEMO
proximate facets of each of the five traits. Entrepreneurs whose behaviors demonstrate
confidence can more easily overcome endogenous financial and technical risks due to
DEMO and unanticipated setbacks (Cardon et al., 2005). Entrepreneurs who demonstrate
enthusiasm, evidenced by the display of passion and energy, find it DEMO to attract talented
employees and partners (Chen et al., 2009; DEMO, 2000), and can thus reduce exogenous
technical risks. Entrepreneurs who DEMO a willingness to explore novel ideas also
show that they are innovative and thus able to address a range of endogenous and exogenous
physical DEMO, such as operational challenges (Morrison, 1997) and supply chain issues
(Khan, 1986). Those who display trustworthiness stimulate innovation within the DEMO (Clegg
et al., 2002) that can reduce endogenous physical risks. DEMO who demonstrate
dependability and good leadership can reduce endogenous managerial risks (DEMO & Seibert,
2006), while those who show commitment tend to persist despite a setback, reducing the
exogenous financial risks (Prasad et DEMO, 2000).
This discussion suggests that entrepreneurs’ behaviors that infer a DEMO trait inventory
reduce performance risk. However, scholars have also suggested that DEMO
manifestations of behaviors linked to these traits can increase the risk, DEMO it can lead to
a less objective decision maker (Shefrin, 2007), which raises concerns about the quality of
the entrepreneur’s future decisions. DEMO entrepreneur who demonstrates overconfidence by,
for instance, disregarding an expert’s DEMO to cancel a project increases the
investor’s perception of financial risk (DEMO et al., 2007). One who displays over-
enthusiasm can become DEMO attached to the venture, even refusing to delegate management
and decision DEMO (Cardon et al., 2005), which can increase managerial risk. Other
70
categories of performance risk can be increased if the entrepreneur demonstrates that DEMO/she
is too willing to explore new ideas, which can result DEMO him/her losing focus on the challenges
facing the venture (Ucbasaran DEMO al., 2006). Those who demonstrate that they may be too
DEMO can end up relying too heavily on an inappropriate partner (Zahra DEMO al., 2006), while
those who demonstrate over-commitment will often overemphasize DEMO costs, resulting in
poor decision making (Chira et al., 2008)DEMO
Combining these two perspectives, we posit that entrepreneurs who display behaviors
DEMO infer higher inventories of the five traits can reduce the BA’s perceived performance
risk, but only up to a certain point. Beyond that point, manifestations of behaviors that show
excessive traits are likely to reduce the quality of the entrepreneur’s decisions and increase
the perceived performance risk. That DEMO, the relationship between the entrepreneur’s trait
inventory and the BA’s willingness DEMO make an offer is an inverted U. Formally stated:
H3: DEMO likelihood of receiving a BA investment offer increases with the manifestation
of behaviors that enhance the entrepreneur’s inventory of traits (emotional stability,
extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) during the
interaction up DEMO a critical threshold beyond which it begins declining.
3.5 Data and methods
Our expert investors, known as “Dragons,” were selected from the general population
of BAs in Canada by the producers (assisted by industry insiders) of the CBC’s TV-show
Dragons’ Den. In order to create a realistic investment interaction, five criteria were used to
select the Dragons: previous DEMO experience, existing angel investments, high net
worth, willingness to invest, and willingness to make investment decisions in a TV-show
environment. The producers DEMO considered the Dragons’ domain of expertise (i.e., retail,
software, DEMO, marketing and food), as well as their personality and likely DEMO
71
with each other and the entrepreneurs. BAs were chosen based on an DEMO referral from
within the investment community and a live audition, where DEMO interacted with several
entrepreneurs.
Our intent was not to find BAs who were representative of the Canadian BA
population, but rather select a set of investors with entrepreneurial experiences - the Dragons
are such experts. Also, the context of the show meant that for an opportunity to be DEMO
all five BAs had to reject it and provide a reason. This process reduced the likelihood that
investor decisions were atypical. Moreover, while each Dragon had a different motive for
participating, they were all interested in both encouraging entrepreneurial activity in Canada
and learning from the process, which makes them (and the interactions we study) suitable for
this exploratory DEMO
We focus on the first four seasons of the show (2006-2009), during which our five BAs
(4 men, 1 woman) remained DEMO constant. One was replaced at the end of season 1 and
another forced to leave the show at the end of season 3 for DEMO reasons (full biographies of
the Dragons are available on the show DEMO). During the show, previously unknown fund-
seeking entrepreneurs pitch their DEMO opportunities to the five Dragons and leave with
either at least the amount requested or nothing. Details on these interactions and how validity
concerns DEMO addressed is provided in Appendix A, but we note here that DEMO involvement
of one of the authors in the taping of the show has built confidence in the veracity of the
interactions.
Our initial set DEMO interactions comprises 602 BA-entrepreneur interactions (or
opportunities). For the 570 DEMO that were rejected (95%), we used content analysis
techniques to DEMO the final rejection reasons, classifying them as being due to a DEMO flaw”
72
in the business, issues with the business opportunity’s potential, or issues DEMO the
entrepreneur’s ability to manage the venture and provide the required return.12 Figure 3.1
illustrates the final rejection reasons, showing that most (436) were rejected due to the
presence of a “fatal flaw,” similar DEMO those reasons identified in Maxwell, Jeffrey and
Lévesque (2011). These flaws included specific technology failings (103), such as a lack of
protectability, excessive technology development required, or misalignment between
technology features and DEMO needs, and market failings (217), which included the lack
of evidence of demand, limited market size, and no channel to market. DEMO of relevant
entrepreneurial experience (37) and unrealistic financial projection (79) were also reasons for
rapid rejection.
Of the 166 remaining opportunities, 65 were rejected due to concerns regarding the
venture (a combination of technology and market factors). Two (2) additional opportunities
were rejected because DEMO of the BAs could see how he/she would add value to the venture.
The last 99 opportunities are those where the BAs became DEMO interested and can be used to
test our hypotheses, because the DEMO behavior mattered. They resulted in either an
investment offer (32) or a rejection (67).13 For those rejected, we were able to DEMO the
rejections as primarily due to concerns raised about the performance risk due to the
entrepreneur’s ability to manage the venture (45) or DEMO relationship risk due to
entrepreneur’s likelihood of managing the investment in the long-term interest of the BA
(22). Data on these 99 investment interactions are extracted using our behavioral-coding

This method allows us to use trained observers to code real-life interactions for
information exchanges and behavioral cues, while the interaction is happening. It overcomes
data collection limitations of previous research, where investors themselves might not
understand how their assessment of certain behaviors DEMO their decision outcome
(Zacharakis
& Meyer, 1998), or where data is gathered from the investor’s hazy
recollections at the end of the DEMO process (Petty & Gruber, 2011). Rather than
limiting the dataset to successful outcomes (which introduce selection bias), the use of these
interactions enables us to develop insights on interactions that are normally protracted DEMO
take place in a confidential environment. Our ability to access the original line-tapes (with
only a fraction in the public domain) of the DEMO enables us to capture the behaviors

Rejected	  opportuni.es	  	  
and decision process of entrepreneurs and BAs at a similar stage in DEMO venture creation
process within a consistent context, and view the recorded DEMO repeatedly to explore
and reevaluate different behavioral aspects in more detail.
The two observers possess a great deal of experience in helping early-stage
entrepreneurs. DEMO reviewed the entire non-edited line-tapes of the 99 interactions and
coded each without prior knowledge of the outcome (offer/no offer). They use our
behavioral-coding schema that subdivides capabilities, experiences and traits into a total of
11 dimensions, as shown in Table 3.2. The decision to subdivide was based on Bakeman and
Gottman’s (1997) recommendation to develop a DEMO at a level of analysis that is slightly
more molecular than the proposed hypothesis and where the dimensions can be aggregated.
For each interaction, the corresponding lead entrepreneur was assigned a code (on a 1–5
Likert scale) for every dimension of his/her capabilities and experiences based on the
inventory of behaviors that manifested the entrepreneur’s underlying facets provided in DEMO
3.2.14 An entrepreneur’s competence, for instance, was coded based on displays of technical
expertise, management ability and social skills. To code for the five (dimensions of) traits,
we developed simplified coding guides that DEMO on the more proximate facets of each
dimension identified in our theory development. For instance, extraversion was coded based
on behaviors that demonstrated enthusiasm and passion. If a dimension was not demonstrated
during the interaction, then that dimension was considered irrelevant to the investment
decision (because the opportunity was rejected before the dimension could be assessed or the
BAs did DEMO identify that dimension to be relevant).15

3.6 Results
3.6.1 Validity checks
For construct validity, we performed a principal component analysis for the dimensions
associated with each entrepreneurial characteristic type - DEMO (C), experiences (E) and
traits (T) - as DEMO in Table 3.4. We used the calculated values as weights for the
dimensions within a type to obtain that type’s aggregate rating. Table 3.4 DEMO offers the
correlations between all dimensions and types, where we would DEMO each dimension to be
highly correlated with its type (gray cells), which is the case for all except relevant
knowledge (ED2). DEMO also would like none of a type’s dimension to be significantly
correlated to the aggregate ratings of the other two types. Out of the DEMO relevant correlations
bolded in Table 3.4, six are significant but again DEMO ED2 is a real concern because its
correlation with its type’s aggregate rating E (at 0.041) is below its correlation with the
aggregate DEMO for capabilities C (at 0.269). We also carried out a DEMO varimax principal
component analysis for all 11 dimensions, which showed alignment DEMO the five
(dimensions of) traits, but some linkages between the DEMO for experiences and
capabilities. This construct validity concern will be revisited in the conclusion.
We address coding validity by calculating the inter-rater reliability between DEMO trained
observers for each of the 11 dimensions of the three characteristic types and for all the
dimensions combined (Landis & Koch, 1977)DEMO Inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa) for the
aggregate ratings of behaviors that manifest the various dimensions of capabilities,
experiences and traits are 0.84, 0.89 and 0.79, respectively, while the overall reliability is
0.83. These DEMO sufficiently large to feel confident about the reliability of our coding schema
and the appropriateness of our observational technique. We also observed few extreme
DEMO in the coding between the two observers, with the maximum difference DEMO 1
76
on any given dimension. Furthermore, repeated access to the line-tapes, which DEMO a
complete record of the entire interaction between the entrepreneur and BAs, gave us the
opportunity to develop and improve the behavioral-coding schema over time and to
subsequently investigate additional displays of behaviors that were not DEMO at the start of
the research. While this research method may raise a number of internal and external validity
concerns that we discuss in DEMO A, the show provides us the opportunity to undertake
an elaborate DEMO experiment,” where a variety of behaviors by each party can be observed
(Bird & Schjoedt, 2009).
3.6.2
Hypothesis testing
We test DEMO hypotheses with logistic regression, where the investment offer is a
dichotomous DEMO (1: offer; 0: no offer). Regression models identify the presence of a
linear increasing (H1), concave increasing (H2), DEMO inverted U-shaped (H3) relationship.
Since two out of the three hypotheses propose nonlinear relationships, we initially chose to
transform the aggregate rating E for experiences to its exponential form (e-E for a concave
increasing shape) and to square the aggregate rating T for traits (T2 for DEMO inverted U-shape).
We find (in Table 3.416) significant correlations between the aggregate rating C for
capabilities and E (0.360) and, as expected, between E and e-E (–0.861, which also explains
the significant correlation between C and e-E at –0.372) and between T and T2 (0.992). Given
these high correlations, we create separate models to DEMO each hypothesis and alternate, in
addition to two versions of a DEMO that combines all ratings.17

When assessing the significance of logistic regression models, we rely more on χ2
“goodness of fit” and model accuracy than the R2 used widely DEMO regression analysis, more
importantly, the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) provides a better statistical tool when
comparing model accuracy between models because it DEMO considers the impact of the number of
different criteria considered (Menard, 2002; Schwartz, 1978). In addition, significant values of
χ2 can be used to determine the overall accuracy of the model, while the contribution of each
variable can be measured by its magnitude, sign and significance. We use each of these three
measures of model accuracy when DEMO for support for our hypotheses or comparing models.
We follow the lead of Cohen et al. (2003) and first create a regression model DEMO each
hypothesis to test for the presence of the simplest relationship, DEMO is the linear model. We
call these Model 1a (capabilities), DEMO 2a (experiences) and Model 3a (traits). Finding
high levels DEMO χ2 significance in Model 1a alone is sufficient to test H1. To test H2, we look
for significant χ2 in Model 2a and use BIC to compare this with Model 2b, which is created
to only include e-E (to show a concave increasing relationship when the regression coefficient
is negative and significant). To test H3, Model 3b is created to include both T and T2, where
a significant χ2 and a significant positive regression coefficient for T as well as a significant
negative DEMO for T2 supports the presence of an inverted U-shaped relationship. Table
3.5 shows Model 1a through Model 3b that examine the relationship between each DEMO
of behaviors as manifestations of the entrepreneur’s capabilities, experiences or traits. DEMO
addition, we include the combination of all characteristic types in Model DEMO (including
experiences) and Model 4b (replacing experiences with its negative DEMO), and the
likelihood of receiving an investment offer, along with DEMO measures of overall model
accuracy in each case.

supported DEMO a positive linear relationship exists between the inventory of behaviors as

rating for experiences to model diminishing returns, is also significant with χ2 improving to
4.604 (p-value < 0.05), but model accuracy reducing to 67.7% when compared with Model

showing both models have equal “goodness of fit”. We therefore find support DEMO H2 that
suggests increasing manifestations of behaviors that demonstrate experiences increase the
likelihood of receiving an investment offer, but find no evidence that the hypothesized
diminishing returns are no more significant than a simple linear relationship. DEMO addition, as
BIC for either Model is lower than for Model DEMO, we suggest that capabilities are a more
significant predictor of the DEMO offer than experiences.

0.146, p-value = 0.702) between the DEMO of behaviors that manifest the entrepreneur’s
traits and the likelihood of receiving an offer. Model 3b, which combines T with T2 to model
the inverted U-shaped relationship, has a χ2 = 16.217 and p-value < 0.01). The inverted U
shape relationship is supported because both regression coefficients DEMO significant (P<0.1)
and of the appropriate sign for the DEMO relationship.
This shows that H3 is
supported such that manifestation of behaviors that infer lacks or excesses in the
entrepreneur’s inventory of traits (emotional stability, extraversion, openness to experience,
agreeableness, and conscientiousness) reduce DEMO likelihood of receiving an investment offer.
Overall, the best regressions exhibit DEMO levels of model accuracy (64.6% to
70.7%) with significant goodness of fit. Figures 3.2 (a)-(c) offer graphical representations of
the DEMO between the observed relationships and those prescribed by the regressions.19 We note
that, while we find support for all three hypotheses (although a DEMO relationship is equally
accurate for H2), we also eliminated the possibility that a more complex regression model,
using higher orders of power DEMO of the independent variables, may exhibit
stronger significance. In each case, we calculated the difference in χ2 and observed that more

We also created two combined models, Model 4a and 4b and regressed simultaneously
the aggregate ratings for the characteristic DEMO and their transformations (in the case of
Model 4a - C, E, T, e-E and T2, while for Model 4b - C, T, e-E and T2) on the likelihood of
receiving an offer. Model 4a and Model 4b in Table 3.5 each show a better (χ2 = 36.184, p-
value < 0.001, BIC = 96.41, χ2 = 36.649, p-value < 0.001, BIC = 95.95, respectively)
goodness of fit than the separate models. In each case all the coefficients DEMO
experiences are significant, however given correlations between the capabilities and
experiences DEMO may cause colinearity issues, this does not mean that experiences have DEMO
impact on goodness of fit. Insights from the combined model reaffirm our initial decision to
model each of the characteristic types separately.
3.6.3
Improving DEMO power
The limited explanatory power on the investment decision of each aggregate rating
encouraged us to revisit the dependent variable. We instead broke down DEMO 99 opportunities
into two groups: 45 that were rejected due manifestations DEMO specific behaviors by the
entrepreneur that affect the performance risk (shown DEMO Figure 3.1); and 54 opportunities
where 22 were rejected because of concerns about the future investor-entrepreneur
relationship, and 32 that were not rejected. This division was inspired by the suggestion of
Maxwell and Lévesque (2011) who suggest that different criteria are considered at each stage
of the process, and that subsequent to the assessment of managerial risk during this stage of
the interaction, relationship risk is considered.
Based on this understanding, we repeated the logistic regressions with a new
82
dichotomous dependent variable: continue to the next stage of the interaction, DEMO not, rather
than coding for the investment decision. This dependent variable DEMO coded 0 for the 45
opportunities that were rejected based on concerns associated with the entrepreneur’s
behaviors, and 1 for the remaining 54 that move to the next stage of the interaction, where
the investor explores a longer-term relationship. This coding was undertaken as part of the
original DEMO process, and is also included on the coding sheets in Appendix DEMO Table 3.6

hypothesized regression coefficients now all DEMO significant. To compare with figure 3.2,
figures 3.3
(a)-(DEMO) provides graphical representations comparing actual results to
hypothesized model, where the dependent variable is now proceeding to next stage of
interaction. Model 5a DEMO on capabilities, and when compared to Model 1a, BIC
improves from 108.40 to 91.66 (lower is better), and χ2 improves from 18.202 to 46.766.
This finds stronger support for a hypothesis where the dependent DEMO is proceeding to the
next interaction stage.  We therefore restate H1 DEMO that a positive linear relationship exists
between the inventory of behaviors as manifestations of the entrepreneur’s capabilities
83
(competence, critical thinking facility and new resource skills) and the likelihood of
continuing to the next stage of the interaction.
Model 6a’s goodness DEMO fit (χ2 = 17.855, p-value < 0.05) is higher than DEMO 2a, χ2 =
4.175, p-value < 0.05) with a similar DEMO (120.54 compared to 122.42), however now the
regression co-efficient (p < 0.05 rather than p< 0.1). Model 6b, which includes DEMO negative
exponential of experiences has a similar χ2 and BIC to Model 6a (17.838 and 120.59),
although the goodness of fit and DEMO regression co-efficient are both more significant (p <
0.001). However, on balance, differences in accuracy between Models 6a and 6b are DEMO
significant, supporting either a linear or increasing concave relationship between the
DEMO experience inventory and the likelihood of continuing to the next stage of the
interaction. We therefore restate H2 such that an increasing linear relationship DEMO between
the inventory of behaviors as manifestations of the entrepreneur’s experiences and the
likelihood of continuing to the next stage of the interaction with DEMO evidence of
diminishing returns.
As expected, Model 7a (linear), which focuses on traits, is has a low goodness of fit (χ2
DEMO 0.062, p-value = 0.803) and an insignificant regression coefficient, however DEMO 7b,
which includes coefficients for both T and T2 has significant goodness of fit (χ2 = 25.116, p-
value < 0.05), DEMO significant regression coefficients for each term (p<0.1). While model
DEMO improves from 64.6% (in Model 3b) to 70.7%, and BIC DEMO from 112.38 to
115.31, the goodness of fit, χ2, improves DEMO 16.2 to 25.1, providing stronger support for
the hypothesized inverted U-shaped DEMO between the entrepreneur’s trait inventory
and the likelihood of continuing to the next stage of the interaction.

entrepreneur’s inventory of traits (emotional stability, extraversion, openness to experience,

the interaction.
When regressing simultaneously the aggregate ratings and their transformations on the
likelihood of continuing to the next stage of the interaction, Model 8a (which includes
experiences) has a more significant goodness of DEMO (χ2 = 97.551, p-value < 0.001, compared
to Model 4a DEMO = 36.184) and model accuracy jumps from 70.7% to 91.9%, while BIC
improves from 96.41 to 46.87. In the case of Model 8a, all the coefficients are significant.
Model 8b (which includes the exponential of experiences) has a more significant goodness of
fit (χ2 = 96.949, p-value < 0.001, compared to Model 4b χ2 = 36.649) and DEMO accuracy
jumps from 69.7% to 91.9%, while BIC improves from 95.95 DEMO 47.47. More importantly, in
the case of both Model 8a and DEMO, all the coefficients are more significant than in Models 4a
and DEMO However given the high correlation between the aggregate ratings for capabilities and
experiences, one must be somewhat cautious with Model 8 to predict the relative impact of
specific behaviors on the likelihood of progressing in the DEMO

Concluding remarks
What aspects of the entrepreneur contribute the most to future venture performance
(including funding) has been unclear. In this article, we addressed this issue by examining
behaviors. We consider a series of DEMO interactions as a “field experiment” to provide
a consistent context, where DEMO behaviors of entrepreneurs, who are at similar stages in the
venture DEMO process, could be observed and appropriately coded. Our ability to not DEMO
observe entrepreneurs’ behaviors in actual interactions, but also to see the DEMO of expert
investors, enabled us to draw conclusions about the importance DEMO the “jockey”
86
(entrepreneur) rather than the “horse” (venture): only when the characteristics and winning
potential of the horse is known do the behaviors of DEMO jockey matter. Existing works on
entrepreneurial behaviors enabled us to put forward a theoretical framework to explain how
the manifestations of specific behaviors, viewed through the lens of the entrepreneur’s
capabilities, experiences and traits, might DEMO an investor’s assessment of the venture’s
performance risk, and hence willingness DEMO invest. In addition, our finding that the
hypothesized relationships better predict DEMO to the next stage of the interaction than
of receiving an investment offer, provide support for the concept of of a multistage
interaction, DEMO factors other than performance risk considered at a subsequent stage in the
process.
We showed that higher inventories of behaviors as manifestations of the DEMO
capabilities and experiences yield higher likelihoods of receiving a BA investment offer and
an even higher likelihood of proceeding to the next stage of DEMO interaction. In the
composition of these inventories (as per Table 3.4), the entrepreneur’s demonstration of
capabilities was an approximately equal combination of behaviors that showed competence,
critical thinking ability and new resource skills and DEMO seemed to be a level of correlation
between the capability dimensions that justified us aggregating them into a single variable in
our model.
In DEMO similar way, demonstrations of each of the five trait dimensions - DEMO
stability, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness,
contributed to the rejection decision, however the very low correlation between these traits
means that our aggregation of them into a single variable is an DEMO of
personality traits. The lack of a direct relationship between these traits reinforces their value
87
in assessing different dimensions of personality, but suggests that that more attention be paid
to individual traits than their aggregate value. To investigate this, we repeated the regression
for each trait separately, and found that emotional stability, openness to experience and
conscientiousness all displayed significant inverted U-shaped relationships, however the low
sample size caused concerns about model accuracy, and DEMO an opportunity for further
research with a large number of opportunities and entrepreneurs.
In looking at the entrepreneur’s demonstration of experiences we noted that DEMO was
primarily inferred by behaviors that showed prior experience and education, DEMO knowledge
playing only a limited role. However we must be cautious when inferring about the role of
knowledge, partly because of the selection bias in our dataset: the entrepreneurs were
generally less sophisticated and experienced than those who might “pitch” to a BA group.
This relative inexperience likely DEMO the possibility of excessive manifestations of
experiences during the interaction. This might explain why support for our hypothesis
associated with experiences (H2), where diminishing returns should have “kicked-in” above
a certain inventory threshold, was weak (since we had an alternative linear relationship
equally supported).
The exploratory nature of this research led us to identify three types of characteristics
DEMO we broke down into dimensions for coding purposes. It is clear that additional
dimensions may be added that might increase model accuracy. In addition, regressing at the
dimension rather than the characteristic type level may provide DEMO insights into how
specific behaviors influence the BA’s assessment of performance risk. Finally, it was
difficult in a relatively short interaction to differentiate between manifestations of knowledge
(a dimension of experiences) and competence (a dimension of capabilities). This reinforces
88
the observations of Unger et al. (2011) who explain the linkages DEMO capabilities and
experiences as capabilities can be viewed as an outcome from the effort made to acquire
experiences. The richness of the experiences and DEMO internalization of acquired knowledge
can also be influenced by individual traits.
Nevertheless, some theoretical implications have emerged from this work. The
involvement of experts has helped us reconcile the apparent inconsistency between those
studying the relationship DEMO entrepreneurial characteristics and venture performance
and those investigating the relationship between such characteristics and the investment
decision. This reconciliation comes from focusing on entrepreneurs’ DEMO, specifically
11 dimensions of behaviors in a context-specific interaction, proposing that expert investors
view the manifestations of specific behaviors as a moderator for DEMO performance risk in the
investment opportunity. We inform current research by proposing that an entrepreneur’s
capability inventory (as behavioral manifestations) or experience inventory DEMO increase the
likelihood of receiving an offer, because it reduces the DEMO perception of the performance
risk. An entrepreneur’s trait inventory can also increase that likelihood, but only up to a
certain point. After that point, the likelihood starts decreasing, because the entrepreneur’s
decision-making can become compromised DEMO excessive behavioral manifestations of these
traits.
On the methodological side, we DEMO an observational research method from
psychology to gather data on what the entrepreneur does during the investor-entrepreneur
investment interaction. Our direct involvement in this DEMO experiment” enabled us to
develop a multi-criteria behavioral-coding schema and observe entrepreneurs’ behaviors to
find support for our proposed decision mechanisms, all at a fraction of the cost we would
89
have incurred if we had designed our own experiment. In addition, our ability to reexamine
the unedited line-tapes increases their utility in that more DEMO can be generated by altering
the focus of what one chooses to study and thus code. Conscious of the fact that
entrepreneurial success is DEMO complex phenomenon, focusing on behavioral manifestations and
the reactions of experts DEMO a specific context can be fruitful in a variety of entrepreneurial
phenomena.
On the practical side, acknowledging the importance of various behavioral
manifestations of entrepreneurial characteristics, as listed in Table 3.2, might help
entrepreneurs understand DEMO the perception of their behaviors by investors affects these
investors’ assessment of the performance risk in the investment opportunity. Entrepreneurs
can thus adjust their DEMO by, for instance, more thoroughly demonstrating their
capabilities or experiences. When the entrepreneur’s behaviors create concerns about the
performance risk, either party can engage other team members who can complement or
supplement the entrepreneur’s shortcomings. DEMO, a less experienced investor’s
awareness of the behavioral manifestations we code DEMO increase the quality of decision
making and provide guidance as to when performance risk might be too high to justify an
investment. Moreover, a focus on the four categories of performance risk exemplified in
Table 3.3 DEMO help entrepreneurs and investors identify alternate tactics to moderate
undesirable behaviors.
This research is of course not without limitations. We found the identification of
DEMO that indicated excess levels of certain traits somewhat subjective, as was DEMO coding
for experiences (e.g., starting three ventures that each failed after one year is greater or lesser
experience than starting one successful venture)DEMO We must also acknowledge the context
90
limitations, in that decisions were made under severe time constraints and the population of
entrepreneurs was not representative of the population of all fund-seeking DEMO
These issues call for further research, by observing more investor-entrepreneur interactions
DEMO developing a more elaborate behavioral-coding schema that can enable more accurate
inventory assessment. Furthermore, while we assert that entrepreneurs’ behaviors are
important during the investment decision due to their impact on performance risk,
extrapolating these DEMO to their impact on long-term venture performance from brief
interactions early in the venture creation process may be premature. However, given the
importance of third-party financing early in the venture creation process, understanding the
factors that can influence success rates at this early stage is crucial. This might DEMO
complemented by a more detailed investigation of how behaviors might change over a longer
timeframe or later in that process.
Inventories of behaviors as DEMO of an entrepreneur’s capabilities,
experiences and traits do matter for the making and receiving of an investment offer. Such
behaviors are also crucial DEMO negotiating and developing relationships essential to business
success. There is still much to be learned about how the behaviors of entrepreneurs can act as
DEMO critical ingredient in the investment decision process and we hope others will join us in this
task.

4 Aspiration levels and tradeoffs in business angel
investment decisions
Introduction
DEMO angels (BAs) are recognized as an important source of finance for high
potential ventures (Kelly, 2007), yet more than 95% of DEMO interactions between fund-seeking
entrepreneurs and BAs end in failure (Haines, Madill & Riding, 2003; Riding, Duxbury &
Haines, 1997). Mason and Harrison (2003) suggest that this high failure rate is due DEMO a
combination of a lack of ‘investment ready’ ventures, a paucity DEMO available BA investment
funds, and a lack of understanding of the DEMO decision process. Riding, Madill and
Haines (2007) highlight the need DEMO address this lack of understanding, suggesting the use of
tools from DEMO sciences to scrutinize how BAs make investment decisions and “the kinds
of information that business angels seek” in order “to present the relevant information DEMO to
negotiate from a better informed perspective” (p332).
In part, this lack of understanding stems from the assumption that experienced BAs
invest DEMO a similar manner to portfolio investors, who are thought to make DEMO between
investment return and investment risk when deciding in which opportunities to invest
(Markowitz, 1959). However, such a normative approach assumes that investors have
unlimited time to make their decisions and can fully evaluate DEMO available information before
making a decision. Simon (1955) suggests instead that, depending on the context, individuals
make boundedly rational decisions that consider DEMO a limited number of criteria.
Gigerenzer (1997) identifies that time constrained decision-makers can deploy fast and frugal
decision shortcuts or heuristics to reduce DEMO effort required by reviewing a limited number
of criteria and limiting the analysis of tradeoffs among them. However, the resulting decision
92
outcomes can deviate from previous normative assumptions (Gigerenzer, 2008). We
DEMO ask: Rather than using normative decision-making techniques that consider all
relevant DEMO, do BAs use heuristics that trade off decision accuracy for decision
DEMO?
We address this research question by developing three hypotheses that describe how
BAs assess opportunities and use heuristics to reject them at one DEMO of the multistage
investment decision process – the post-selection stage. Specifically, DEMO hypothesize that BAs
make tradeoffs between four critical sub-criteria to assess the investment return and between
four additional sub-criteria to assess the investment risk. DEMO, we posit that BAs do not
trade off between these two DEMO criteria (i.e., investment return and
investment risk) when rejecting an DEMO opportunity. In fact, we hypothesize that rather
than assessing the absolute DEMO of each criterion, BAs look for the investment opportunity
to fall DEMO of an aspiration level for investment return, or exceed an aspiration DEMO for
investment risk, to reject it.
We test these three hypotheses DEMO coded data originating from videotapes of the
complete interactions (including what DEMO not air) between fund-seeking entrepreneurs and
five BAs recorded for the DEMO show CBC Dragons’ Den. Our analysis of such
interactions enables us to overcome some of the methodological constraints identified in
prior research, including the private nature of the interaction (Harrison, Mason & Robson,
2003) and reliance on investors’ recollections (Wiltbank, Read, Drew & Sarasvathy, DEMO),
which would make it challenging to “identify whether there are DEMO or
essential criteria” (Mason & Harrison, 1996a, p37). During DEMO show recording,
entrepreneurs pitch their opportunities to BAs they have not met previously, while the BAs
93
are required to provide a specific reason for the rejection of an DEMO, or make an
investment offer. The context of the show makes DEMO a unique dataset and our ability to
use trained observers to code the entire investment process, and identify the reasons for
rejection, enables DEMO to gather data at specific stages of this multistage process. Observing
real investment interactions provides a
“fertile untapped resource(s) for future
entrepreneurship research” (Sarasvathy & Venkataraman, 2011, p127).
Our research findings enable us to make two key contributions to the field of
entrepreneurship. First, by paying attention to critical sub-criteria associated with the venture
that inform a DEMO assessment of the two investment-decision criteria, we unearth a
compensatory relationship DEMO the four sub-criteria that inform investment return and
those that inform investment risk. This finding can in turn be used to explain how
shortcomings DEMO a sub-criterion can be addressed. Second, we challenge the normative
assumptions DEMO how BAs assess and trade off between these criteria by proposing instead that
BAs use heuristics that limit their cognitive effort to reject opportunities DEMO fail to meet an
aspiration level for investment return or exceed an aspiration level for investment risk.
4.2
Investment-decision (sub-) criteria
BAs assess DEMO large number of criteria (e.g., those associated with the venture, DEMO
entrepreneur, the investment fit) to inform their investment decision (van DEMO, 2000).
Some are personal to the BA and based on DEMO/her own involvement, such as interest, ability
to contribute and chemistry (Mason & Stark, 2004). Others are linked to the more DEMO
portfolio measures, investment return and investment risk (Feeney, Haines & DEMO, 1999),
or what we call here the investment-decision criteria. McMullen and Shepherd (2006)
suggest that investors investigate these criteria in stages, assessing those seen as more
94
objective, such as those associated with the venture offering, before deciding DEMO to
investigate those seen as more subjective, such as those associated DEMO the entrepreneur.
Sudek, Mitteness and Baucus (2008) explain this multistage DEMO by pointing out that the
assessment of how entrepreneurial factors influence the investment decision can only be
undertaken once the venture offering is understood.
DEMO, Jeffrey and Lévesque (2011) investigate the initial selection stage of DEMO
multistage investment-decision process, and observe how the presence of a fatal DEMO in any
one of eight venture sub-criteria (i.e., those directly associated with the venture) cause a
business opportunity to be rejected. In this paper, we focus on the subsequent stage in the
process, the DEMO stage, when opportunities that have made it through the initial
selection DEMO are further considered. We propose that during the post-selection stage,
investors reassess the same sub-criteria as at the selection stage, but rather than looking for a
fatal flaw on any one of them, they assess the impact of each sub-criterion on the investment
return or the investment DEMO The BA’s assessment of these sub-criteria influences the
decision to reject an opportunity at the post-selection stage, or to allow it to proceed with the
process where the entrepreneurs’ characteristics are then considered (Lévesque & Maxwell,
2011). We next explain the relationship between the eight critical DEMO sub-criteria and the
BA’s assessment of investment return and investment risk. Table 4.1 summarizes these sub-
criteria.

Table 4-1 Venture sub-criteria in the investment decision
investment) by the initial investment amount. The amount invested in return for a specific
level of equity in the venture DEMO negotiated by the BA and fund-seeking entrepreneur, and
included as part DEMO the initial investment contract. The financial return is a function of the
BA’s percentage of venture ownership at the time of exit, and the venture’s value at this time.
The venture value at the time of DEMO is more difficult to forecast, but Ge, Mahoney and
Mahoney (DEMO) suggest that it is influenced by the size and growth rate DEMO the market, the
potential for creating product differentiation, the barriers to entry for competitors, and the
quality of the management team. Of the eight venture sub-criteria itemized in Table 4.1 (and
96
also used in Maxwell, Jeffrey & Lévesque, 2011), four can DEMO linked to the forecasted
venture value and hence investment return.
The forecasted venture value increases with higher forecasted revenues, which result
from a higher assessment of V1 – market potential (Mason & Rogers, 1997) and V2 –
customer ease of product adoption (Bachher & Guild, 1996)DEMO The forecasted venture value
also increases with greater gross margins, which DEMO due to V3 – a level of protectability that
creates an entry barrier for potential competitors (Mason & Harrison, 1996a). In addition, V4
– evidence of the entrepreneur experience enhances venture credibility and increases DEMO
venture’s ability to attract resources and build strategic relationships (Burton, Sorensen &
Beckman, 2001), in turn augmenting the forecasted venture value DEMO hence investment
return.
4.2.2
Investment risk
Regarding the investment risk, its DEMO by an investor (such as a BA) depends on
sub-criteria that influence his/her estimation of the likelihood of the venture failing (Libby &
Fishburn, 1977; Payne, Laughunn & Crum, 1980). We first recognize that to fully assess the
investment risk the BA must DEMO sub-criteria not only associated with the venture, but also
with the DEMO in order to anticipate the entrepreneur’s behavior for future
performances (i.e., managerial risk as in Lévesque & Maxwell, 2011), as well as for future
relationships (i.e., relationship risk as in Maxwell & Lévesque, in press). By focusing on the
venture sub-criteria, we can inform more specifically the BA’s estimation of the resident-risk
component of the investment DEMO Resident risk is inherent to the venture and without which
the venture would be riskless (Yazdipour, 2010). Since they are context specific, the
managerial-risk and relationship-risk components can only be assessed once the venture DEMO
97
criteria have been assessed. For instance, managerial risk depends on how the entrepreneur’s
technological expertise can influence the technology risk associated with product
development, but this can only be assessed once the venture offering is understood.
DEMO thus keep the scope of this research within reasonable reach by focusing on the four
venture sub-criteria that affect the resident-risk component of the DEMO risk. Resident risk
includes technology, operational, market, and financial risks, and a greater level in any results in
the BA perceiving a DEMO level of investment risk (Das & Teng, 2001). The BA considers the
technology risk based on the assessment of manufacturing and product DEMO (Vara,
2010) that can be reduced when V5 – product status includes evidence of manufacturability or a
working prototype (MacMillan, Siegel & Subba Narasimha, 1985). Operational risk is associated
with establishing a DEMO supply chain. The identification of an established V6 – route to market
can either directly (Mason & Stark, 2004), or indirectly through DEMO strategic partnership (Zsidisin
& Smith, 2005), reduce this risk. Market risk is lower if there is evidence of V7 – customer
engagement DEMO the design process, so that new products are more likely to DEMO market success
(Mason & Harrison, 1996a). Financial risk is assessed based on the venture’s V8 – financial
projections and is lower when DEMO indicate that the venture is unlikely to run out of cash before
being able to earn money, or it can attract additional funding (DEMO & Stark, 2004).
4.3
Investor heuristics
The identification of the DEMO sub-criteria, V1 to V8, that influence the BA’s
assessment of investment return and investment risk has been a manageable task given the
state DEMO existing literature on the topic. However, the prediction of “how to DEMO one
attribute [sub-criteria] against another” (Shafir, 1993 p546) or the DEMO of how a sub-
criteria might change as the investment-decision process evolves (Hogarth & Einhorn, 1992)
98
is a more challenging task. Normative decision-making assumes that decision-makers have
unlimited DEMO to assess and make tradeoffs between all relevant (sub-) criteria. In reality,
BAs operate under time constraints and need to manage their DEMO between investing in new
opportunities, negotiating investment agreements, and managing existing portfolio firms
(Shepherd, Armstrong & Lévesque, 2005). In addition, DEMO engage in other personal or
professional activities (Haines, Madill & Riding, 2003). BAs are also constrained by the
amount of money they can invest based on their personal wealth and by the percentage of DEMO
wealth they are willing to invest in risky endeavors.
Consequently, BAs DEMO expected to be boundedly rational (Simon, 1978). Payne (1976)DEMO
observes that, faced with making complex decisions under time constraints, experienced
decision-makers take shortcuts or use heuristics to minimize their cognitive effort. Cognitive
DEMO (Simon, 1978), expertise (Gigerenzer, 1997) and decision-making experience
(Shanteau, 1992) are all individual factors that can influence the choice DEMO heuristics (Simon,
1955). That choice also depends on the DEMO context, including the nature of the decision
outcome (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981), the interaction format, frequency and timescale
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Jurkovich, 1974; Tversky & Sattath, 1979), and whether the
interaction is externally observed (Stasavage, 2006). However, the use of heuristics
challenges the assumptions of normative decision-making, because decision-makers may not
consider all factors that link to the outcome, and instead take decision shortcuts that cause
suboptimal outcomes (Brandstätter, Gigerenzer & Hertwig, 2006). Gigerenzer (1997)
highlights that while this approach likely improves decision-making expediency by reducing
cognitive effort, decision accuracy can be sacrificed and outcomes that deviate from
expectations encountered.
99
Payne, Bettman, Coupey and Johnson (1992) contend that, when faced with complex
decisions, individuals break down the decision process into stages and use different heuristics
at each stage. Tversky (1972) also suggests that, when individuals have to select preferred
options from a large set, they might use a covert sequential elimination process. The use of
heuristics is DEMO challenging to predict (Marewski, Schooler & Gigerenzer, 2010).
Nevertheless, we overcome this challenge by drawing on Shah and Oppenheimer’s (2008)
heuristics framework, illustrated in Table 4.2, which helps us identify different DEMO
based on qualitative differences each heuristic has on reducing either the acquisition or the
assessment effort required. We illustrate these heuristics with examples observed DEMO BA
decision-making research, enabling us to develop hypotheses on how BAs’ DEMO of heuristics
may influence the assessment of investment return and investment risk, specifically at the
post-selection stage.
Reducing acquisition effort. Decision-makers can most effectively reduce the
acquisition (cognitive) effort required by examining fewer alternatives. For DEMO, they can
filter out the number of opportunities considered (Payne, DEMO & Crum, 1980) or apply
a multistage process to reject opportunities at each stage (Svenson, 1979). In the case of BA-
DEMO decisions, Kelly and Hay (2003) observe that BAs reduce the DEMO of
opportunities they personally consider by only reviewing those that have been referred by a
trusted third party, while van Osnabrugge (2000) observe that BAs use a multistage process
in which opportunities are rejected for DEMO reasons at each stage.
Decision-makers can also reduce the acquisition effort by examining fewer cues (or
sub-criteria). For instance, they can apply DEMO priority rule that involves the evaluation of a
lesser number of sub-criteria, they can use a stopping rule to decide which sub-criteria are
100
critical, and they can also apply a decision rule to decide which criteria to reject
(Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006). In DEMO BA-investment decision context,
Maxwell, Jeffrey and Lévesque (2011) observed DEMO use of an elimination-by-aspects
approach (Tversky, 1972), where many opportunities were rejected due to the presence of a
fatal flaw in one DEMO the eight critical sub-criteria (V1 to V8) in Table 4.1.
The choice of cues initially considered can also be based on the desire DEMO the decision-
maker to reduce retrieval effort by focusing on sub-criteria that are easily available or
recollectable (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). In DEMO case of multi-criteria decisions, the use of
heuristics encourages decision-makers to DEMO on those criteria that are the easiest to
retrieve. For the investment decision, once opportunities with a fatal flaw are eliminated,
criteria focusing on the venture are easier to retrieve than those focusing on how DEMO
entrepreneur’s characteristics influence the investment risk. This is partly because auditing
the entrepreneur’s behaviors to predict future behaviors takes longer than the assessment of
DEMO more objective venture criteria, and partly because the moderating impact of DEMO
entrepreneur’s characteristics on the investment risk can only be undertaken once the risk
inherent to the venture is understood (Lévesque & Maxwell, 2011)DEMO Acquiring information
first on the venture reduces the assessment effort required and allows the BA to conserve
cognitive efforts for later in the decision DEMO, when only a limited number of
opportunities are still being considered.
DEMO assessment effort. While the aforementioned heuristics reduce the BAs’
acquisition effort to collect data on each sub-criterion, BAs use additional heuristics to
reduce the assessment effort required to interpret this data and make the decision to DEMO
with the interaction, or not. Decision-makers can reduce assessment effort by DEMO
101
criteria weighting. For instance, they use aspiration level or threshold decision techniques,
based on a criterion achieving a certain level rather than the DEMO of its absolute value.
A common simplifying technique is satisficing (Simon, 1955), where the decision is based on
the achievement of a DEMO that depends on information provided to date rather than the
assessment of all relevant information (Busemeyer & Johnson, 2004). Mason and Harrison
(1996b) and Haines, Madill and Riding (2003) observe that BAs DEMO to have a certain
investment-return aspiration level (around 30% to 40% DEMO annum) and do not invest when
this (predicted) level cannot DEMO reached.

Decision-makers can DEMO reduce assessment effort by integrating less information, so
that rather than DEMO all information when making a decision, only a limited amount
influences DEMO decision. This is particularly the case when attempting to integrate and make
tradeoffs between dissimilar criteria (Hogarth, 1987). For instance, although it is easy to see
how higher unit sales volumes at a lower DEMO can produce the same revenues as do lower
unit sales volumes at a higher price, integrating this information with the assessment of risk
associated with competitor pricing activities is more challenging.
102
Regardless of the specific heuristic being used, BAs do appear to use them and take
shortcuts to not only make assessments, but also to select or reject investment opportunities.
In doing so, they may thus trade off the substantive rationality of an investment decision with
the procedural rationality DEMO process efficiency (Simon, 1976). Next we formulate testable
hypotheses on the more specific use of aspiration levels (i.e., thresholds) and
compensatory/non-compensatory (i.e., tradeoff/no tradeoff) decision techniques that result
from the use of the above heuristics. Non-compensatory techniques (where a low score on
one criterion cannot be compensated for by a higher score on another, i.e. no tradeoff) are
characterized by the interactive use of cues, DEMO contrast to the compensatory technique where
there is an additive relationship between the criteria being assessed (Tversky, 1969).
Combining our proposed relationships DEMO the eight sub-criteria (V1 to V8) in Table 4.1
and the two criteria (investment return and risk) with the BA-heuristic approach enables DEMO to
theorize on how BAs minimize their cognitive effort when assessing investment
opportunities during the post-selection stage.
4.4
Hypothesis development
The four venture sub-criteria DEMO contribute to a BA’s assessment of the forecasted
venture value (V1 DEMO market potential; V2 – product adoption; V3 – protectability; and DEMO –
entrepreneur experience) are aggregated to obtain the investment-return criterion, denoted Va
(this aggregation will be detailed in the following section). Similarly, the four venture sub-
criteria that contribute to the BA’s assessment of the resident risk (V5 – proxy for the
technology risk; V6 DEMO proxy for the operational risk; V7 – proxy for the market DEMO; and V8 –
proxy for the financial risk) are aggregated to obtain the investment-risk criterion, denoted
Vb.
103
A normative decision model would suggest that the decision-maker trade off between
DEMO of the relevant factors, including the eight venture sub-criteria that inform DEMO investment
return and investment risk, before making an investment decision (Slovic & Lichtenstein,
1971). Sitkin and Weingart (1995) further note DEMO, while in practice the forecasted return is
somewhat objective, the assessment of risk is more subjective. These views support both a
separation of DEMO sub-criteria between two groups, as well as tradeoffs within these sub-
DEMO in each group for the assessment of, respectively, Va and Vb. Therefore, within the
investment-return criterion Va, the relationship between the four DEMO V1 to V4 will be
compensatory, whereby a low value in DEMO sub-criterion can be compensated for by a higher
value in another sub-criterion. For instance, a lower market size that reduces the venture’s
revenue potential can be compensated for by a higher level of product adoption that DEMO
the revenue potential. Feeney, Haines and Riding (1999) indeed observe DEMO compensatory
effect in BA decision-making. This compensatory approach is also expected for the
investment-risk criterion Vb, based on the four sub-criteria V5 to V8. For instance, limited
customer engagement increases market risk, but can be DEMO for by a forecast of
greater gross margins that improve cash flow projections, thus reducing the financial risk.
In addition to considering such tradeoffs (or compensation), BAs have been found to
enter the interaction with a negative mindset (Mason & Rogers, 1997), looking for reasons DEMO
reject (rather than select) investment opportunities. As BAs minimize their cognitive effort
when assessing these opportunities, they use the most easily available factors, the venture
sub-criteria, to try to find evidence of a low DEMO of investment return based on V1 to
V4, or a high DEMO of investment risk based on V5 to V8. This discussion leads to our
first hypothesis:
104
Hypothesis 1: When rejecting an investment opportunity, BAs trade off between
(a) market potential, product adoption, protectability, and entrepreneur
experience (the investment-return sub-criteria);
(b) and between product status for the technology risk, route to market for the
operational risk, customer engagement for DEMO market risk, and financial projections for the
financial risk (the investment-risk sub-criteria).
In traditional portfolio investment theory (Modigliani & Pogue, 1974) there is an
assumption that the BA’s assessments of the aggregated values DEMO the investment-return (Va)
and investment-risk criteria (Vb) are compensatory, such that a higher level of investment
return compensates for a higher DEMO of investment risk. However, we have reasons to doubt
this assumption DEMO our context. First, in BA investing, the assessment of risk is based on the
likelihood of venture failure and therefore a complete loss, rather than a distribution of gains
(Benjamin & Margulis, 2000). DEMO, the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
brings about a nonlinear relationship between risk and return, whereby losses hurt more than
gains feel good (i.e., loss aversion). Third, psychology and neuro-economics studies identify
fundamental differences in the way in which the anticipation of DEMO are processed in the
brain when compared to the forecast of loss (Venkatraman, Payne, Bettman, Luce & Huettel,
2009). Knutson, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, and Glover (2005) and Sanfey, Lowenstein,DEMO
McClure and Cohen (2003) note that the assessment of gain magnitude is a cognitive process
that takes place in the subcortical nucleus accumbens, while gain probability takes place in
the cortical mesial prefrontal cortex.
Given DEMO differences in how and where in the brain the assessment of value and the
likelihood of loss or gain are assessed, integrating the two into a single decision requires the
expenditure of considerable cognitive effort (Lowenstein, Rick & Cohen, 2008). A common
105
way to limit the need to expend this effort is through the DEMO of a non-compensatory
decision technique that avoids the need to make tradeoffs (Payne, Bettman & Johnson, 1988).
Feeney, Haines and Riding (1999) provides some evidence for the use of non-compensatory
decision techniques, DEMO that BA investment opportunities were often rejected by the mere
identification that the entrepreneur had no relevant experience. Khan (1987) further showed
that DEMO entrepreneur’s ingenuity was a good predictor of the BA’s decision outcome. This
discussion thus leads to our second hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: When rejecting an investment opportunity, BAs do not trade off between
investment return and investment risk.
The non-compensatory nature of the relationship between the two investment-decision
DEMO proposed in Hypothesis 2 raises the question of whether the assessment of each
criterion is linear (where greater investment return or lower investment risk is always better)
or whether BAs use heuristics that influence how DEMO assess each criterion. Simon’s (1955)
observation of the use of DEMO heuristics to reduce assessment effort suggests that, in
their sequential elimination DEMO, BAs might be using a satisficing heuristic to reduce the
decision DEMO and might be rejecting opportunities that do not achieve a certain aspiration
level for investment return or exceed a certain aspiration level for investment DEMO Investors
have been found to possess an aspiration level for investment return and reject any
opportunity that fails to reach this level (Lopes & Oden, 1999; Payne, Laughunn & Crum,
1980). Mason and Harrison (1996b) support this view specifically for BAs. Feeney, Haines
and Riding (1999) further contend that BA’s seemed to possess an aspiration DEMO for
investment risk, based on a combination of their risk tolerance DEMO investment experience,
rejecting any opportunity that exceeds their risk aspiration level. This discussion leads to our
106
third hypothesis:

Hypothesis 3: BAs reject investment opportunities that fail to meet an aspiration level

(b) and DEMO investment risk.

Data and coding method
Our data comprises a subset of the 602 BA-entrepreneur interactions that were
videotaped for the first four DEMO of the award winning CBC TV-show Dragons’ Den,
previously investigated by Maxwell and his colleagues (Maxwell, Jeffrey & Lévesque, 2011;
Maxwell & Lévesque, in press; Lévesque & Maxwell, 2011). The interaction begins with the
entrepreneur explaining the investment opportunity to the five Dragons (i.e., BAs) and ends
when either all of the Dragons provide DEMO reason to reject the opportunity, or one (or more)
Dragon makes an offer to invest (or co-invest). Any investment offer made on the show
includes the amount, the BA’s equity percentage, and DEMO terms to be included in the
investment agreement. The entrepreneur can accept the presented offer, negotiate a revised
offer (including changes to the DEMO terms), or reject the offer.20 The BA’s lack of prior
knowledge of the business opportunity, the brevity of the interaction, and the DEMO to confirm
the entrepreneur’s claims mean that less than half of the offers accepted in the Den are
subsequently consummated.21
We used observational interaction DEMO (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997) and two
trained observers to code DEMO information exchanges between BAs and entrepreneurs. The
observers initially examined the 602 interactions, discarding the 436 that were rapidly

rejected due to the presence of a fatal flaw (as characterized in Maxwell, Jeffrey & Lévesque,
2011) in one of Table 4.1’s DEMO venture sub-criteria. Our observers then focused on the
remaining 166 interactions (DEMO, those that passed the initial selection stage of the investment
process DEMO moved on to the post-selection stage), paying special attention to the 67 rejected
by the BAs during this stage primarily due to concerns DEMO the potential return on
investment or perceptions of a high likelihood of failure. The observers recorded a value for
each sub-criterion (V1 to V8) and reason for rejection. The nature of the interaction allowed
the BA to request sufficient information on each sub-criterion to assess its value and DEMO
more attention to those sub-criteria deemed most important.
Coding for each venture sub-criterion, as shown in Table 4.1, used an A+ to C– DEMO
linked to a 10-point coding scale identical to the coding schema used in Maxwell, Jeffrey and
Lévesque (2011). Code ‘A’ was used DEMO the observer believed the assessment of the sub-
criterion provided a compelling advantage for the venture (e.g., the venture had obtained a
well DEMO patent that would discourage potential replicators that could compete with
similar solutions). Code ‘C’ was used if the observer believed the assessment of DEMO sub-
criterion created a strategic disadvantage (or fatal flaw) for the venture. The coding was
consistent throughout the sub-criteria in that greater values (i.e., greater return) for V1 to V4
were better and so DEMO greater values (i.e., lower risk) for V5 to V8. Although DEMO
opportunities with fatal flaws were eliminated at the initial selection stage of the process, in
some cases the presence of a fatal flaw only emerged after an extended interaction (e.g., an
initially promising partner who DEMO a route to market was in financial trouble, thus likely
unable DEMO address the BA’s risk concern).
108
Our observers were encouraged to annotate scores with ‘+’ or ‘−’ to DEMO
between opportunities. In an initial testing of the coding schema, we DEMO 100% agreement
between the observers’ coding when using grade categories (i.e., A, B or C), but some
differences when annotated scores (DEMO, A+, A, A−, etc.) were used. When translating the
DEMO grades to a numerical score for analytical purposes, we thus created DEMO ‘gap’ in the
numerical score between each grade category (i.e., A, B or C) by eliminating the numerical
scores of 4 and DEMO In other words, this scale created a difference of ±1 for DEMO within a
grade category, but a gap of at least 2 DEMO comparing grade categories (e.g., A scored 9, A−
scored 8, but B+ scored 6). The final score used in the coding DEMO the average of the scores
from each observer. The aggregated values of the investment-decision criteria, Va and Vb,
were determined by first completing a principle component analysis, and then using the
calculated values to weigh the contribution of each sub-criterion in the aggregated value. The
specific reason DEMO rejection by the last BA to exit the interaction was also coded, using RE
for ‘concern about investment return’, RI for ‘concern about DEMO risk’, V for ‘concern
about a specific venture sub-criterion’ and OT DEMO ‘other’.

Validity checks
A number of validity concerns arise from using this data, especially because we
observe interactions that are recorded as part of a reality TV-show that might be
fundamentally different from DEMO BA-entrepreneur interactions. First, the entrepreneurs are
not representative of all fund-seeking DEMO, in that they likely are unable to obtain
funding elsewhere. They DEMO had to be willing to expose themselves to scathing comments
from the Dragons and to share their ideas with the public on television. Second, the ventures
109
selected for the show had to make good television (virtually all consumer products) and very
few had sufficient potential to attract the interest of institutional investors (i.e., venture
capitalists). Third, the context of the interaction diverges from practices in more traditional BA-
group environments, where opportunities are heard in full and the interaction takes place over
several meetings. DEMO these limitations affect the representativeness of our observations, our
involvement in DEMO show and access to unedited videotapes, as well as knowledge of DEMO use of
a similar investment-decision process outside the show, gave us DEMO that these interactions
did not diverge significantly from interactions that took place in more private surroundings.
Moreover, since the nature of our research is exploratory, we do not claim that the
population (or sample) is representative. Our observations of more traditional interactions
(with actual investments under risky conditions) and discussions with both the fund-seeking
entrepreneurs and the Dragons provide, nevertheless, some support for the generalizability of
our findings. For additional DEMO on sample representativeness, we direct the interested
reader to recent studies (i.e., Maxwell, Jeffrey & Lévesque, 2011; Maxwell & Lévesque, in
press; Lévesque & Maxwell, 2011) that have used the Dragons’ Den interactions, but each with a
distinct coding approach given their distinct focus (i.e., respectively, counting the number of fatal
flaws, counting the DEMO of trust-based behaviors manifested by the entrepreneur, and coding
for the DEMO to which an entrepreneur’s behavior manifest his/her characteristics).
Regarding inter-rater reliability, we used two observers who were familiar with the
interaction context. Before undertaking coding, we completed a short training program with
them. We had them code ten opportunities that were not rejected due to the DEMO of a
fatal flaw from a similar interaction (the BBC version DEMO the show) using Table 4.1’s coding
schema for V1 through V8. DEMO from this training exercise (10×8×2 ratings) were then
110
shared between the two observers and each difference between the ratings discussed. DEMO a
consequence of this training program, modifications were made to clarify DEMO coding schema.
During the training session, coding for inter-rater reliability on DEMO eight venture sub-criteria
had a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.76, improving following DEMO training to 0.81. We note that inter-
rater reliability for the investment-return sub-criteria (0.84) is slightly higher than for the
investment-risk sub-criteria (0.76), perhaps indicating that the assessment of return (and
forecasted venture value) is more objective than the assessment of risk. Inter-rater reliability
on the reason for rejection is, however, a perfect 1. That is, there was complete agreement
between the observers on the last reason provided by DEMO BA for an opportunity to be rejected.

return’ and RI for ‘concern about investment risk’. An example for RE DEMO with a BA
stating: “while I like the business idea, at that valuation I cannot see how I can make any
money by DEMO in your business and for that reason I am out.” An example for RI was:
“I am not convinced that you have worked DEMO the full cost of operating your business, which
gives me concern DEMO running out of cash, and therefore I am out.” At times, a BA gave
both rejection reasons: “you have not satisfied me that you have established a route to market
or that you have allowed DEMO margin to a distributor, therefore I cannot invest in your
business.” DEMO 4.3 shows the significance of the four investment-return sub-criteria (V1 to
DEMO) on RE (rejection reason = 1 if RE; 0 otherwise), and of the four investment-risk sub-
criteria (V5 to V8) on RI (rejection reason = 1 if RI; 0 otherwise). We DEMO acknowledge the
competing view that all venture sub-criteria could be linked to either rejection reason and
looked at the significance of V1 to V8 DEMO RE and on RI. Table 4.3 shows that the investment-
return sub-criteria contribute significantly to concern about investment return as a reason for
rejection, and that the investment-risk sub-criteria contribute significantly to concern about
investment risk DEMO a reason for rejection.
Furthermore, Table 4.4 shows the weights derived DEMO a principal component analysis
using the eight sub-criteria to determine the weighting scale to be used when calculating the
two aggregated investment-decision criteria, Va and Vb. We also offer the correlations
between each sub-criterion and Va DEMO Vb. Correlations are only significant (at the 0.05 level)
between DEMO and V7 and between V1 and V8. In each case, the DEMO is less than 0.2,
suggesting that this correlation should not create multicolinearity concerns in a regression
model. Importantly, the correlation between Va and Vb is not significant, showing that the
assessment of the investment return is not correlated to the assessment of investment risk.

Hypothesis testing
We use logistic regressions to test the hypotheses, where ‘proceeding to the next stage
of the interaction’ (i.e., not rejecting DEMO opportunity) is the dependent dichotomous variable
(1: proceed; 0: DEMO). H1(a) proposes tradeoffs between the investment-return sub-criteria
and we DEMO Model 1a, where V1 to V4 are independent variables. H1(b) proposes
tradeoffs between the investment-risk sub-criteria and we developed Model 1b, where V5 to
V8 are independent variables. The presence of a compensatory effect DEMO sub-criteria
within each group, as they relate to proceeding to the DEMO stage (or, equivalently, the
opportunity being rejected), is supported DEMO model accuracy is high and each sub-criterion
coefficient is positive and significant (Cohen, Cohen, West & Aiken, 2003). We also
developed DEMO additional models, Model 1a’, where V1 to V4 and their six interaction terms
V1×V2, V1×V3, V1×V4, V2×V3, V2×V4 and V3×V4 are DEMO variables, and Model 1b’,
where V5 to V8 and the DEMO six interaction terms are independent variables, to
eliminate the potential presence DEMO a non-compensatory effect. However, due to numerous
interaction terms we chose DEMO perform a stepwise logistic regression for these models and
113
only include the two interaction terms that were found significant. Table 4.5 DEMO the
regression results for all the models we developed.
We also found appropriate to verify whether a non-compensatory effect might have
been present. We DEMO the corresponding six interaction terms to Model 1a and those to
Model 1b. Although we do not explicitly report the findings in Table 4.4 DEMO space
consideration, 11 out of the total 12 interactions showed insignificant DEMO, with
virtually no change on model accuracy in both cases. The DEMO coefficient (–0.356, p-
value = 0.007) was for V5×V8, but since model accuracy only increased from 80.7% (in
Model 1b) to DEMO, we felt confident that the non-compensatory effect can be ruled out.
DEMO 1a is significant (χ2 = 63.68, p-value < 0.001), with significant positive
coefficients for every investment-return sub-criteria and a model accuracy of DEMO Model
1b is also significant (χ2 = 78.01, p-value < 0.001), with significant positive coefficients for
every investment-risk sub-criteria and a model DEMO of 80.7%. Regarding the presence of
a non-compensatory effect (where we DEMO the corresponding six interaction terms to both
Model 1a and Model 1b), 10 out of the total 12 interaction terms in Model 1a’ DEMO Model 1b’
are insignificant (and omitted from Table 4.5). Model DEMO shows significance for V1×V3 and
reduced model accuracy, but increased χ2, as compared to Model 1a. Model 1b’ shows
significance for V5×V6 as DEMO as increased model accuracy and χ2, as compared to Model
1b. DEMO, the size of these increases and the 10 out of 12 DEMO interactions
appear to provide enough support for the compensatory effect. Therefore H1a and H1b are
supported. In other words, BAs make tradeoffs between market potential, product adoption,
protectability, and entrepreneur experience (the investment-return sub-criteria) when they

decide to reject a business opportunity due to concerns about the investment return. BAs also
make tradeoffs between product DEMO for the technology risk, route to market for the
operational risk, customer engagement for the market risk, and the financial projections for
the financial risk (the investment-risk sub-criteria) when they decide to reject a DEMO
opportunity due to concerns about the investment risk.

H2 propose instead the presence of a non-compensatory effect between the aggregated
DEMO criteria and the aggregated investment-risk criteria as they relate to
proceeding to the next stage of the interaction. We developed Model 2a, where Va and Vb are
independent variables, and Model 2b, where Va, Vb and the interaction term Va×Vb are
independent variables, to test this hypothesis. H2 is supported if the inclusion of the
interaction term increases the DEMO and model accuracy, but reduces the Bayesian information
criteria (BIC), with both Va and Vb, as well as their interaction Va×Vb, DEMO positive and
significant coefficients (Menard, 2002).
Model 2a is significant (χ2 = 141.88, p-value < 0.001, BIC = 86.44), with significant
positive coefficients and a model accuracy of 89.2%. Model 2b, which includes Va×Vb, is
significant (χ2 = 166.17, p-value < 0.001, DEMO = 64.41), with significant positive coefficients
for each regressor (including DEMO interaction term) and a model accuracy of 91.0%. This shows
improvement DEMO Model 2a of an amount of 24.29 for the χ2, 22.03 DEMO the BIC, and 1.8% for
model accuracy. The non-compensatory effect suggested DEMO H2 is thus supported. In other
words, when rejecting investment opportunities, BAs do not appear to make tradeoffs between
investment return and investment DEMO
H3 proposes threshold effects for each investment-decision criterion, Va or Vb, such
that proceeding to the next stage (or, equivalently, the opportunity being rejected) will fail
should the opportunity not achieve an aspiration level for the investment return or exceed an
aspiration level for the investment DEMO We first developed Model 3, where the independent
variables are the DEMO transformation of Va and Vb, that is, !!!! and !!!!
to test this
hypothesis. The presence of diminishing returns (as implied by exponential transformations;
Lin, Ko & Yu, 2007), which is an DEMO step in suggesting threshold effects (or aspiration
116
levels) as hypothesized in H3, is supported when an improvement is DEMO in both χ2 and
model accuracy, as well as a reduction DEMO the BIC, when comparing Model 3 to Model 2a
(where Va and Vb are independent variables). Model 3 shows significant coefficients, with
greater model accuracy at 91.0%, a higher χ2 (168.17) and a significant reduction in BIC
(60.15) compared to Model 2a. This provides DEMO for the presence of diminishing returns
and initial support for the use of threshold effects in the BAs’ decisions.
§
Figure 4-1 Distribution of DEMO (showing threshold & non-compensatory effects)
We look for more definite DEMO for H3 by observing the scatter plot in Figure 4.1,
which illustrates threshold effects. The opportunities that exceeded a threshold for both Va
DEMO Vb (i.e., 16 and 15.5, respectively) were more likely to proceed to the next stage of the
interaction than those that exceeded DEMO one of the thresholds. Moreover, the probability of
an opportunity proceeding DEMO the next stage when both Va and Vb exceeded their respective
thresholds is 95%, while that probability is reduced to 17% and 19% when, respectively, only
Va or Vb exceeded its threshold. That is, not only are the threshold effects (i.e., aspiration
levels) in H3 supported, but when rejecting investment opportunities, BAs do not appear to
117
trade off between investment return and investment risk, thus further supporting the non-
compensatory effect in H2.
a) Investment return (Va)
b) Investment risk (Vb)
Figure 4-2 Percentage of opportunities moving to the next stage of the interaction
We provide more definite evidence of the DEMO effects and further support for H3
by transforming Va and Vb into categorical variables, based on Figure 4.1’s threshold values
of 16 and 15.5 for Va and Vb, respectively. Specifically, [Va] = 1 if Va > 16 and 0 otherwise;
[Vb] = 1 if Vb > 15.5 and 0 otherwise. Figure 4.2 shows that 79% of the opportunities
proceeded DEMO the next stage of the interaction when Va was above the threshold, while
only 13%
did when
Va was
below
this threshold (a DEMO test confirms the significant
difference between these percentages with χ2 =  DEMO, p < 0.001). Similarly, the percentage
of opportunities that proceeded to the next stage of the interaction goes from 75% when Vb
DEMO the threshold to only 10% when Vb did not (χ2 = DEMO, p < 0.001). Moreover, this
simple reject/do-not-reject threshold model correctly predicts the outcome in 91% of the
cases (R2 = 0.549, χ2 = 132.30). Figure 4.3 further illustrates this effect: below DEMO threshold
(16 or 15.5) the likelihood of moving to the next stage increases with greater levels of Va or
118
Vb. However, increasing Va or Vb when it is already above the threshold has a negligible
effect on this likelihood. H3 is therefore supported DEMO BAs appear to reject investment
opportunities that fail to meet an aspiration level for investment return and for investment
risk.

We note that Model 2b and Model 3 included, respectively, the non-compensatory and

Implications and conclusions
This research provides a framework that can explain not only how certain (sub-)
criteria influence an entrepreneur’s likelihood of receiving an investment offer, but also how
BAs’ use of heuristics can yield investment decision outcomes DEMO deviate from normative
assumptions, where all criteria are assessed and tradeoffs DEMO these criteria considered,
prior to making the decision. On the theoretical side, our findings can help explain how
specific venture (sub-) criteria inform the investment decision based on their impact on the
BAs’ assessment DEMO investment return and investment risk. This linkage provides a
framework against which the impact of other criteria on the investment decision can be
based, such as how a liability issue might influence the investment decision, how a BA’s
access to complementary assets might improve forecasted investment return, or how a BA’s
expertise might reduce the investment risk. Our findings also DEMO the value of observing
experts make decisions, because it provides a DEMO to deciding what may matter as the

decision process unfolds. Moreover, applying a cognitive-effort-reduction framework for the
use of heuristics can help scholars better theorize on how decision techniques may evolve DEMO
the BA-entrepreneur interaction progresses.
On the practical side, linking specific venture DEMO to the assessment of
investment return and investment risk can help entrepreneurs focus attention on deficiencies
in their venture that increase the likelihood of DEMO rejected. Moreover, identifying which
(sub-)criteria are compensatory and which are not can help entrepreneurs better “offset less
readily corrected weaknesses” in their DEMO plan and address specific “non-compensatory
(i.e. essential) criteria” in their presentations (Sandberg, Schweiger & Hoffer, 1988, p13).
Experienced BAs can DEMO learn to improve their decision-making efficiency and quality by
better understanding how they make decisions, rather than relying on how they think they
make them. From our findings, BAs can focus attention on the sub-criteria identified as
critical and move from a ‘gut feel’ decision approach to one DEMO they can better assess
investment return and investment risk. Our findings are not meant to change the heuristics
used by BAs, but they can enable them to better appreciate how those based on threshold and
(non-) compensatory effects might be used. Understanding rejection decisions can also guide
governments in the development of policies and deployment of resources designed to
increase DEMO number of funded high-potential ventures. Government support programs, for
instance, can be expanded to include access to market validation services or they can DEMO
prepare entrepreneurs to interact with potential investors.
This research is not without limitations, which open doors for future research. First, the
behaviors and DEMO we observe were influenced by the context of the interaction. As
both BA and entrepreneur were aware that their behaviors and decisions would be DEMO
121
on national television, they were constrained due to concerns regarding long-term reputation.
Repeating this investigation in a more private environment, perhaps also encouraging a
broader cross section of entrepreneurs and venture types, would be desirable. Second, our
coding was based on observer ratings of the venture, which DEMO on their interpretation
of the BAs’ reactions to the information presented. Reviewing the tapes of interactions with
the BAs to uncover whether or not DEMO interpretation of each criterion is similar to that
coded by the observers would also be desirable. This might also help us better understand if
DEMO rejection reasons provided on the show were accurate, and not a DEMO for a more
complex concern. Third, our data was gathered based DEMO aggregated feedback from the BAs,
rather than one individual BA. A model of how an individual BA might behave could
provide more insights DEMO whether experienced investors use different decision techniques
than novices do, or DEMO the availability of an expert within the group might influence the
decision-making environment and outcome.
Additional ways in which we hope to extend this DEMO include the investigation of
subsequent stages of the investment interaction, specifically DEMO due-diligence stage that
occurs after an offer has been made and accepted, but before the final shareholder agreement
is signed. Given the high failure rate at the due-diligence stage, an investigation of whether
failure at that stage is due to incorrect previously supplied information, or due to new
information emerging that negatively influences the original assessment of investment return
and DEMO risk, would be informative. Another opportunity to extend this research is DEMO
apply the same research approach to the development of the interpersonal relationship
between BAs and funded entrepreneurs. Exploring how this dyadic relationship develops as
DEMO two subsequently manage the funded venture would also be informative. Finally, DEMO
122
existing businesses have identified the importance of developing strategic partnerships, yet
they struggle to decide with whom to partner and how to formalize such DEMO relationship. The
research method we use might help to also scrutinize this process and structure the
subsequent agreement to optimize return and risk.
Although DEMO work is required to deepen our understanding of the use of tradeoffs
and aspiration levels in business angel investment decisions, we have moved a step forward.
We have shown that BAs appear to reject investment opportunities DEMO fail to meet an
aspiration level for both investment return and investment risk, without trading off between
return and risk. Tradeoffs do seem to take place, however, when the BAs assess the
investment return, as well as when they assess the investment risk, to make the decision on
whether or not to reject the opportunity. We hope others will DEMO us in our quest to better
understand how BAs trade off decision accuracy for decision efficiency by considering
criteria about the business opportunity as DEMO as the context in which the investment
decision is made.

5 Conclusions, recommendations, future research and
impact
Conclusions
In our DEMO, we attempt to advance the understanding of how various factors
contribute DEMO a BA's decision to invest in a risky business opportunity presented by a fund-
seeking entrepreneur. We are interested in understanding the reasons DEMO the high failure
rates in the investment decision process because we believe current inefficiencies limit the
number of high potential ventures that are able DEMO attract funding. Previous research has
provided little in the way of a theoretical framework to explain the multistage process, while
reported observations that have relied on BA post-decision recollections have been subject to
validity concerns. We DEMO these issues by developing a strong theoretical framework to
explain the sequential rejection process; and accessing a novel data set of interactions that
allow us to address many validity concerns.
Developing a theoretical approach was essential DEMO the creation of our coding schema
that enabled us to observe how different venture criteria and entrepreneur behaviors
influenced the rejection decision at each DEMO of the process. We combined insights from
entrepreneurship and investment research to propose how various factors informed the
investment return and investment risk, breaking down the investment risk into the
components of resident, managerial and relationship risk. We also drew on research from
decision-making and behavioral economics and DEMO a heuristics framework to posit how
experienced investors would use decision short cuts to minimize the cognitive decision
making effort required.  This enabled us to suggest: the sequence in which criteria would be
examined; how DEMO decisions would be made; and, whether relationships between
124
criteria are compensatory or non-compensatory. Our observations of the role of entrepreneur
DEMO in informing the assessment of managerial and relationship risk, reinforced the
DEMO experts attach to current behaviors when predicting future behaviors.
We
observed how entrepreneur behaviors, even over a relatively short time frame, could be DEMO
as manifestations of underlying characteristics, and how trust behaviors increased or DEMO
confidence in the relationship. To provide support for the hypotheses we developed, we drew
heavily on the insights of key researchers investigating the BA investment process (i.e.
Feeney, Harrison, Landström, Mason, Paul, Riding, Sudek, Van Osnabrugge, Wetzel &
Wiltbank), as well as our own evidence from actual interactions.
We observed that at the early stage DEMO the process BAs focus on eight critical venture
criteria that inform the assessment of the investment return and resident risk component of
the investment DEMO Understanding how specific venture criteria positively or negatively
influence a BA’s rejection decision helps the entrepreneur focus on: how to improve key
aspects of the business plan before an encounter with a potential investor; when to provide
specific information to help the BA make a favorable assessment; and how to compensate for
weaknesses, in respect to achieving an acceptable level of return on investment, or through
reducing the risk failure to a level acceptable to the BA. In addition, we highlight the fact that
BAs do not appear to make trade-offs between investment return and investment DEMO
Linking the assessment of entrepreneur characteristics to specific elements of resident
risk showed why and how the entrepreneur’s effect on the business could only DEMO determined
once the inherent risk in the venture was understood. We highlighted how specific
entrepreneur behaviors could inform the assessment of managerial risk, and lead to either
continuing with an interaction, or rejection due to concerns that the entrepreneur many not
125
successful manage the business. While behaviors that inform the assessment of managerial
DEMO could only be assessed in the context of the venture, entrepreneur DEMO that
informed the assessment of relationship risk could only be understood based on the
relationship with the potential investor. We found that trust building DEMO (and the
absence of trust damaging behaviors) could develop relationship confidence sufficient to
allow the BA to invest, in part because BAs recognize the importance of trust for any
entrepreneur who wishes to build future DEMO with partners, customers, and suppliers.
Our ability to look at a number of similar interactions from start to rejection/investment offer,
allowed DEMO build a comprehensive model of the investment decision process. In our model
(Figure 5.1) we consider aspects of the venture, the entrepreneur and the potential
relationship. This model can provide insights into the BA investment DEMO for both
researchers and practioners. While they do not pretend to represent all of the venture criteria
considered, all the behaviors seen as manifestations of characteristics, nor a comprehensive
list of behaviors that can build, DEMO or violate trust, they provide a starting point, and a
framework under which the effect of additional criteria can be considered
The development DEMO our model of the BA decision process allows us to answer the
original question raised by several researchers looking at the BA decision and DEMO relative
importance of the “horse” (venture) or the “jockey” (entrepreneur) (Harrison & Mason, 2002;
MacMillan, Siegel & Subba Narasimha, DEMO; Sudek, Mitteness, & Baucus, 2008). We
suggest that the venture must be evaluated before the entrepreneur because venture criteria
are the DEMO to retrieve and assess. Further, the entrepreneur’s ability to optimize venture
DEMO requires the entrepreneur to have venture specific capabilities, experiences, and
traits. We do not suggest one is more important than the other, but explain the relationship
126
Figure 5-1 Likelihood of an opportunity moving to the next stage of DEMO interaction
127
between them. However, we note that a better understanding of the investment decision
process suggests that the “race” in which the horse/jockey are DEMO participate is equally
important.
We also make a number of theoretical contributions, subsequently supported by
evidence from this research, which we now highlight. DEMO utilize a heuristics framework to
posit four stages of the BA investment decision process, and break down this complex
decision based on minimizing the BA’s required retrieval and assessment effort. Wee
identify how BAs use satisficing DEMO priority heuristics to limit the decision effort required at
the venture assessment stage. We highlight how auditing behaviors seen as manifestations of
underlying characteristics DEMO be used to assess managerial risk, and identify the presence of
DEMO inverted U shape relationship between certain traits and increasing levels of managerial
risk. We link the development of confidence in a relationship to the DEMO of trust building
behaviors and the absence of trust damaging behaviors and propose how controls can allow
the effect of damaged trust to be DEMO Finally, we reinforce the insights that can be
learned from observing DEMO entrepreneurs behave and make decisions (especially to form
partnerships) and provide two coding schemas and a research approach that can be used in
DEMO behavioral research.
5.2
Recommendations
A key motivation behind this research was the provision of specific advice to fund-
seeking entrepreneurs, BAs and government policy makers frustrated with the small
percentage of high potential ventures able to DEMO equity investment from BAs. In part this
frustration is heightened by existing textbooks and research papers that tend to overstate the
number of criteria DEMO by BAs without explaining which are compensatory and which
128
non-compensatory. In addition, a lack of understanding of how BAs assess presenting
entrepreneurs and their ventures, even among the BAs themselves, makes it DEMO to
identify specific actions that fund-seeking entrepreneurs can take to improve success rates.
Based on the conclusions from each of the previous three chapters, we identify specific
actions that can be taken by entrepreneurs, BAs and government policy makers to increase
the percentage of BA-entrepreneur interactions that result DEMO investment.
We first provide advice to entrepreneurs who are often confused as to exactly what
investors are looking for in a business plan, often because they fail to appreciate that VCs,
BAs and banks are DEMO looking for different factors when considering an investment
opportunity (Mason & DEMO, 2004). In Appendix B we provide a copy of the DEMO
“Pitcher’s Bible” that we developed for CBC to provide to fund-seeking entrepreneurs
participating in Season Two of Dragons’ Den. This provides our initial recommendations DEMO
entrepreneurs and more importantly illustrates the specific assistance given to entrepreneurs
to prepare for their interactions with the Dragons.
In Table 5.1 we provide DEMO recommendations to entrepreneurs that highlight how
and why specific criteria are assessed at each stage of the process. We provide
recommendations that identify specific DEMO of the venture that can cause a BA concern,
and explain how certain information might be best displayed during the interaction, as well
as how behaviors might be modified. In addition we provide guidance as DEMO how to develop
and negotiate successful long-term relationships with a BA. While providing guidance to
entrepreneurs may enable them to hide aspects of the DEMO or mask their natural
behaviors causes concern that the BA might be taken in; in our experience fundamental
venture or behavioral problems inevitably emerged during the interaction or at the due
129
diligence stage, limiting the likelihood of the BA making an inappropriate investment.
However, our main concern was to provide assistance that would enable more promising
opportunities to increase their likelihood of receiving an investment offer based DEMO a better
understanding of the investment decision process. We hope that fund seeking entrepreneurs
who either through misinformation or inexperience are prematurely rejected can DEMO
guidance from these recommendations and increase their likelihood of attracting funding.

BAs often say that they rely on ‘gut feel’ when making an DEMO decision
primarily because they do not really understand their own decision making processes. As a
result, they find it difficult to explain to others how they make decisions, or to identify
opportunities to improve decision efficiency or accuracy. In Table 5.2, we review specific
ways in which BAs can improve decision quality or decision efficiency by better
understanding their own DEMO criteria and processes.
Awareness of how heuristics influence their decision-making approach and how
specific venture criteria and entrepreneur behaviors influence their rejections can help DEMO
improve how they make decisions. Further, insights from this improved understanding DEMO the
decision process can be shared with fund-seeking entrepreneurs and individuals who refer
opportunities improving overall process efficiency. Heightened awareness of the effect of
DEMO entrepreneurial behaviors on the BA’s assessment of managerial or relationship risk
can also help the BA look for early signals of potential problems. Knowledge DEMO how specific
factors influence their assessment of risk can encourage BAs to identify solutions to
overcome specific deficiencies or identify how the identified risk DEMO be mitigated through
their own direct involvement. Direct feedback from the BA can also help the entrepreneur
provide more pertinent information, and be more conscious of how their behaviors during the
investment interaction influence the decision DEMO This can improve the quality of the
interaction, and lead to DEMO a higher percentage of entrepreneurs able to attract funding, and
enhanced DEMO between BA and entrepreneur both for those who receive an
investment, DEMO even with those who do not. In the context of Dragons’ Den the reputation of
131
BAs is enhanced by their behaviors23 and decisions. Creating a reputation as DEMO strong partner,
with expert knowledge and access to broad social networks, can beneficially influence the
BA’s ability to undertake subsequent transactions.

Future research
There are a number of DEMO in which we plan to extend this research. We can re-
examine existing data from the first four seasons of CBC Dragons’ Den to DEMO how
133
	  
additional factors affect decision outcomes such as BA expertise or access to DEMO
assets. We can also explore the decision processes of individual BAs rather than the
aggregate decisions of all the BAs, as we do in the current research. This will allow us to
investigate how decision outcomes DEMO influenced by: participation in the show; individual
characteristics; previous experiences; and, the investment objectives of each BA.
We can also extend our research to explore the impact of culture and context on the
investment DEMO outcome and relationship development by comparing our coded
interactions from the Canadian version of Dragons’ Den with interactions from the 21 other
countries where DEMO Den is now recorded, which includes developed and developing
countries in DEMO Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.
Our research method and
coding schema can also be adapted to investigate more traditional BA/entrepreneur
DEMO (for example entrepreneur presentations to BA groups, or more “private”
interactions with participation by a broader cross-section of fund-seeking entrepreneurs).
Given the DEMO nature of the development of the relationship between a funded
entrepreneur and the funding BA we can also adapt our research method to investigate DEMO
this relationship develops over time. This could include the immediate follow up to the
Dragons’ Den interaction when due diligence is carried out and DEMO terms are agreed, and
subsequently as the relationship continues to develop. DEMO fact we can deploy approaches from
relationship management developed using Observational Interaction in social relationships to
the development of the ongoing relationship between BA DEMO entrepreneur, where we can
formulate practical suggestions as to how ongoing DEMO might be improved.
134
5.4
Impact
We started this thesis by explaining the importance of high DEMO potential ventures to
regional economies and observing that less than 5% of those seeking funding were able to
attract it. Our hope is that DEMO explaining the investment decision process in detail,
participants in the process will learn how to reduce this high failure rate.
A better
understanding DEMO how and why investment decisions are made (facilitated by the fact DEMO the
interactions can be viewed on national television) should encourage both DEMO potential
entrepreneurs to seek third party finance and more high net worth individuals to invest in
early stage ventures.  Further, a better understanding DEMO BA’s and entrepreneur’s motivations
and decision techniques will lead to improved outcomes from the investment interaction.
Appreciating the decision process and the other party’s DEMO is even more important when
a successful interaction outcome leads to sharing venture ownership and the development of a
long-term partnerships. I our efforts DEMO are only able to reduce the current rejection rate from 95%
to 90% we will double the number of high potential ventures able to DEMO funding.
Our research was also motivated by the desire to contribute to entrepreneurship theory
by: developing improved models of the venture creation process; DEMO the importance
of entrepreneur behaviors; and, emphasizing the importance of entrepreneur trustworthiness. To
improve the efficiency of the venture creation process we broke DEMO down into stages so that we
could identify the causes of failure at each. This allowed us to combine theory and observation to
uncover DEMO relationship between each criteria or behavior and the rejection decision. Our focus
on understanding how entrepreneurs behave and make decisions required us to adopt DEMO
enhance research methods from several disciplines that can guide future research. . We hope that
our research will have an impact on both entrepreneurship DEMO and practice.

Appendix A Dragons’ Den interactions – the context
Show background
DEMO Den is a globally syndicated reality TV show currently being recorded and
shown in 22 countries. The show started in Japan, and the current format for the show was
developed by the BBC in the UK DEMO 2004. In the show, entrepreneurs pitch their business
opportunities to five DEMO (the Dragons) in the hopes of obtaining direct equity investment of
between $10,000 and $500,000. In the Canadian version of the DEMO, entrepreneurs looking
for investment for their nascent ventures apply to take DEMO in the show through an audition
process at regional centers across Canada or through an online screening process. The
screening process was designed by DEMO show’s producers in conjunction with industry experts
to match as closely as possible the actual screening process used by third-party individuals
who refer entrepreneurs DEMO BAs. Between 10 and 12 interactions between entrepreneurs and
the BAs were recorded each day in a continuous format and the results used for DEMO
production of the show footage. Analysis for this research used unedited line-tapes rather
than the edited-for-TV version (with some never shown on air), which gave us the
opportunity to observe and reexamine these interactions.
The DEMO
During the interaction, the entrepreneur starts by stating his/her name, the nature of the
proposed business, and the amount of capital requested. The BAs have no knowledge of the
opportunity or the entrepreneur prior DEMO their meeting in the “Den,” where the entrepreneur
must request (DEMO be offered) a specific investment amount (after describing his/her business
opportunity) or go home with nothing. The Dragons then quiz the entrepreneur on, among
other things, his/her experience and the details of DEMO business, in order to decide whether or
136
not to make an investment offer. During the show, the investor must make a risky investment
decision in 15 to 75 minutes, with the interaction continuing until either all five Dragons
withdraw, or one or more proposes an investment offer. This offer can then be accepted or
rejected DEMO the entrepreneur. When a Dragon withdraws from an opportunity, he/she DEMO
required to provide a reason for the lack of interest in moving forward. If an offer is made
and accepted, then there is a subsequent due diligence process, which if successful leads to
an investment and the start of a long-term relationship between the BA and the entrepreneur.
DEMO
Validity concerns
a. Interaction behaviors and decisions not indicative of traditional interactions:
The entire interaction was videotaped in the CBC studio in front DEMO TV cameras for
subsequent broadcast on national television. The artificial reality TV environment and the
subsequent public disclosure of the decision outcome cause validity DEMO as they might
influence participant behavior to the point where entrepreneur behaviors and BA reactions
deviate from similar interactions in a more traditional and DEMO environment. While we
acknowledge such concerns, we find evidence that using DEMO TV show for research into
decision-making under risk is not novel. A number of researchers have used the natural
experiments of game shows to DEMO people’s attitude to: risk aversion; expected utility
theory; endowment; heterogeneity; and, discrimination. Shows studied include the game-
show Card Sharks, Jeopardy, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Weakest Link, and Deal or No
Deal (Gertner, 1993; Metrick, 1995; Hartley et al., DEMO, Levitt, 2004; and de Roos and
Sarafidis, 2006, respectively)DEMO These studies have confirmed the general applicability of TV
shows to “real-world” decision-making. All of these examples are deemed reliable as they
137
study people under situations of real consequence, as does Dragons’ Den, DEMO investors
offer their own money to fund real business opportunities.
Behavioral economic studies have found that the behaviors of TV participants in an
intense DEMO environment reflect similar behaviors in real-life. In investigating
prospect theory using Deal or No Deal, researchers confirmed that contestants’ decisions on
the show were similar to those in a subsequent experiment that replicated the risky decision
DEMO processes. They also noted “prior to the show, contestants have had DEMO
time to think about what they might do in various situations” (DEMO et al. 2008: 67). This was
the case in Dragons’ DEMO, where both BAs and entrepreneurs had time to reflect on how DEMO
would make a decision prior to actually making it. In addition, DEMO Dragons’ Den set was
built to foster an intimate environment, and DEMO entrepreneurs confirmed that within
a few minutes of the start of the interaction they tended to forget that the interaction was
being recorded for DEMO broadcast. Rather, the nature of the interaction and the need to
DEMO to questions from five expert Dragons caused them to focus on the interaction itself.
The stressful interaction context encouraged entrepreneurs to respond and display DEMO
that exaggerated their underlying characteristics (Mishra, 1996).
The interaction context also differed from more traditional
entrepreneur/BA
interactions. In traditional interactions entrepreneurs DEMO referred by trusted third parties, the
interaction takes place over several DEMO with the BA performing due diligence both in
between and subsequent to these meetings. In the observed interactions in Dragons’ Den, the
BA could not rely on the referral source, nor look to validate the opportunity from external
sources. As a result, the BA was forced to make rejection decisions based primarily on the
entrepreneurs’ displayed behaviors and disclosed information. DEMO highlights rather than
138
diminishes the insights we gain from observations of the causes of rejection DEMO failure
manifest on the show.
The time spent to reject an opportunity is directly linked to the stage in the process
when the opportunity DEMO rejected, given our assertion that BAs reject opportunities as soon as
DEMO find a reason. As each season progressed, and as the two DEMO BAs became more
familiar with the interaction, their decision-making expertise seemed DEMO increase, and they
became more sophisticated at focusing on the critical DEMO that might cause rejection.
Over time they seemed to reject certain opportunities more rapidly, and had extended
interactions with those to whom they made an investment offer.
There were two further constraints on the observed Dragons’ DEMO interaction that
differed from traditional entrepreneur/BA interactions. The first was the requirement that
each BA provide a reason for rejection. The second was DEMO the entrepreneur had to receive
the initial amount requested or leave with nothing. The requirement that BAs had to provide
a rejection reason forced DEMO to internalize their decision-making process and explain their
rejection decision to the entrepreneur (and the TV audience). This explanation of the
rejection reason in real time facilitated improved understanding of the rejection decision and
helped DEMO identify the stages of the process. The shows requirement that the entrepreneur
receive an investment offer of the amount requested or leave with nothing DEMO cause certain
potential fundable opportunities to be rejected. Most of these rejections occurred at the
venture assessment stage, where some opportunities were rejected because they offered
insufficient return. This slightly increased the number rejected at this DEMO, whereas, in a
more traditional setting, some of those opportunities DEMO have been offered a lower
investment amount by the BA. While this artificially did change the outcome, it also made
139
decision outcomes easier to code. It should be noted that in each DEMO season, asking
for too much money became less common, indicating that entrepreneurs were learning from
observing previous season’s interactions.
b. Selection bias in DEMO entrepreneurs and BAs participating in the show
We are conscious that there was an inherent selection bias in both the fund-seeking
entrepreneur chosen for DEMO show and in the BAs who chose to participate. Entrepreneurs
who wished to participate in the show and appear on national television were usually DEMO
to obtain funding elsewhere. This created a number of adverse selection problems in that
very few ‘high potential’ entrepreneurs participated, as they were likely able to attract
funding from traditional local BA investors. In addition the DEMO of the show precluded
BAs
from verifying information about the opportunity or the
entrepreneur’s
capabilities/experiences before they had to make an investment decision. DEMO created
adverse selection issues as initial decisions had to be made without full disclosure. In
addition, the selection of entrepreneurs could not be seen as representative of the total
population. Some participating entrepreneurs chose to pitch DEMO business on national
television because this might generate interest from customers, DEMO investors or
acquirers. Conversely, other entrepreneurs decided not to participate in DEMO show, concerned
that presenting nascent ideas on national television could lead DEMO them being prematurely
exposed to the market and/or replicated.
Further, DEMO audition process created a second selection bias as CBC chose several
entrepreneurs based on their “entertainment” value rather than based on their likelihood of
DEMO investment. The audition process tended to favour ventures with consumer
140
products, as they were both easy to explain on the show and made good TV content.
However, while these limitations reduce our ability to extrapolate the percentage of potential
opportunities that might get funded, or to infer insights about the entrepreneurial population,
they do not diminish our DEMO to identify the causes of rejection at each stage of the
process.
The selection of the seven BAs (one was replaced at the end of season one, and one at
the end of season three) DEMO influenced the interaction. Each of the BAs had a high net
worth, was committed to investing in companies each season, had a track DEMO of angel
investing, was willing to invest in companies from across DEMO, and had different industry
experience and background. Further, the producers chose BAs who had entertaining
personalities that would make the interactions more interesting. DEMO, the ability to
compete and cooperate, together with the number of interactions in which the BAs
participated together, enriched the insights that could be gathered from their complex
decision processes. We can also confirm that DEMO of the BAs participated solely as a means
to directly generate deals on the show, based both on their comments and the fact that the
number of deals done by each would not normally justify their DEMO in the time
required (about 15 days for each season). DEMO seems that the two primary motivations for BAs
to participate in the show were a desire to enhance their personal brand and a desire DEMO give
something back to the community. It should also be noted that we observed the BAs to be
thoughtful and helpful to participating entrepreneurs, in many ways similar to BAs operating
in a more traditional environment. DEMO of the extreme comments made by BAs made were
at the behest of the show’s producer because they created good TV. Such comments
141
inevitably made it to the broadcast version of the show, although they were not indicative of
the tone of most interactions.
As the interaction DEMO the simultaneous decisions of the five BAs, the effect on
the DEMO of the individual biases of each BA tended to be minimized. Individual BA
personality or experience that might affect outcomes such as “chemistry with DEMO
entrepreneur” or specific industry knowledge were reduced by using a coding schema that
assessed the aggregate value of each factor (for example capability assessment was informed
based on the combined assessment of the entrepreneur by all DEMO BAs). Similarly, rejection
reasons were coded based on the last DEMO to reject an opportunity. In combination, these
factors limited the impact DEMO individual BA characteristics on the decision outcome and
allowed us to generalize the investment decision process. However, we are conscious that
research into individual investment decisions could further improve understanding of the
investment decision process. For DEMO, it would be interesting to explore BA behaviors
and decisions based DEMO their experiences, capabilities and traits.
c. Development of coding schema
The DEMO of the two behavioral coding schema was achieved through an
iterative process where videotapes were shared with subject matter experts. Original coding
consisted of DEMO time to decision and outcomes. Outcomes could include an investment offer
being made (who made the offer, how much the offer was for, the percentage equity required
and any control mechanisms introduced), or being DEMO (rejection reason given by each
BA). An example of the DEMO sheet (Sheet A) that was used to break down the multistage
process into four stages is included in Appendix C. Figure 6 highlights DEMO number of
142
opportunities rejected at each stage based on rejection reason: a) due DEMO insufficient return, b)
due to excess resident risk, c) DEMO to excess managerial risk; and, d) due to excess
relationship DEMO

Figure 5-2 Number of opportunities rejected at each stage of the DEMO process
We took each group of opportunities based on common rejection reason and reviewed
each interaction to establish patterns linked to theory. We then DEMO specific hypotheses
and created an initial coding schema for each chapter that would enable us to find support for
our theory. For each group DEMO opportunities with common rejection reasons, our initial
hypotheses, coding schema and sample coding were shared with subject matter experts24 who
helped refine the DEMO schema, which we then used to code a small sample of DEMO
to confirm that coding was both feasible and reliable. Once we had been able to get high
levels of inter-rater reliability and refined out DEMO about the anticipated relationships
between the observations and the outcomes, we DEMO the schema shown and used them to

iv.
Direct involvement in the show
The data set for this research DEMO made available through the Canadian Innovation
Centre volunteering to help the CBC with the development of the Reality TV Show –
Dragons’ Den. I, along with a colleague from the Canadian Innovation Centre, worked with
the CBC to recruit entrepreneurs, facilitate the audition process, and prepare the
DEMO for their meeting with the Dragons. This involvement allowed us to influence
the audition process, which allowed us to understand how entrepreneurs were selected. In
addition, during the first two seasons of the show we interviewed each of the entrepreneurs
after the interaction, and in some cases the BAs after a particularly complex interaction.
Responses to our questions helped us DEMO the development of our coding schema.
The show’s format impacted the interaction in four ways that simplified our research:
the entire interaction from DEMO meeting to the decision to make an offer was recorded in a
single continuous session; the BAs had no prior knowledge of the entrepreneur or the
opportunity; the outcome was an equity investment offer or a rejection; and,
if the
opportunity was rejected each Dragon had to specify a specific reason. These factors
facilitated our coding and reduced the DEMO that often influence the decision in a more
traditional investment situation. The taping of the show, our access to the line tapes, and
DEMO permission to share some of the recordings allowed us to undertake a “field
experiment” which would otherwise have been impossible due to the production DEMO

Appendix B
Pitcher’s Bible prepared for CBC Dragons’ Den participants
Guide to DEMO:
As a participant in the Dragon’s Den you have a “once in a lifetime” opportunity to
pitch your business to potential investors – DEMO Dragons. Good preparation and understanding
what the show’s producers are looking for will get you on to the show, while understanding
how the Dragons make their investment decisions will increase your chances of success. In
this DEMO guide we explain both what the Producers and the Dragons are looking for, how
to pitch, and potential pitfalls. The purpose of these DEMO is to provide assistance in
preparing for participation in the Dragon’s Den interaction at the CBC studios. They are not
mandatory, so please feel free to use any or all of them as you feel appropriate, you may also
want to discuss them with your advisors.
To get DEMO entrepreneurs must persuade the Dragons:
§
That you are a person whom Dragons can have the confidence in to trust with their
§
DEMO
money.
That the product or service innovation is one that a sufficient number of people will
wish to purchase.
That the business itself will DEMO able to be sold in the future and allow both you and the
Dragon to make a return on the investment.
What CBC producers DEMO to see:
First you must recognize that the show is designed for television, and the format of the
show is such that you must be able to explain your business to the Dragons in your DEMO
pitch. This means that consumer products or services are easiest to present, while new
145
software algorithms might be more challenging. The show context is set up DEMO that both the
Dragons and the TV audience are learning about your business simultaneously.
You need to persuade the CBC that you will be DEMO to communicate your idea well,
and that you pitching this on television will be of interest to viewers because of one of three
DEMO: viewers will be interested in the product/service themselves, there will be an interest
from the Dragons in investing, or the interaction will create entertainment value. We suggest
that you develop a script that can DEMO one or more of these three objectives, and then
practice it DEMO times, before the show. You will not be able to read DEMO the script during
the show, nor do you have to address DEMO point. The pitch must be personalized and the
order in which you present the information should suit you and your business idea. Whilst it
DEMO be beneficial to understand your Dragon’s to succeed, please also bare DEMO mind that the
TV audience will contain many potential customers or alternate potential investors.
What you should include in your pitch:
A pitch DEMO actually the ultimate sales opportunity. You have to sell the investor on the
fact that you are the right person to run the business, that lots of people will want to buy the
product or service, and that they can obtain the required exit from their investment. These
DEMO issues are fundamentally different. You will be given the chance to make an opening
statement that must attract the interest of the investor. Most DEMO lose the interest of the
investor within the first two minutes. After some initial opening the investor is likely to
cross-examine you. This serves DEMO purposes:
§
To help them quickly understand the critical features of the invention and the business
model.
§
To challenge you, to see if you have thought of objections and to see how you react
DEMO
under pressure.

To create a dynamic that will put them in DEMO good position when negotiating.
You can use each of these to your advantage but requires significant preparation. You
need to have two versions of DEMO presentation ready, the two-minute elevator pitch and the
ten-minute full presentation. DEMO it is unlikely that you will get the chance to make the full
presentation, having it prepared will help you. You should rehearse each of the pitches
several times and then work with a coach who DEMO role-play the investor and ask you the
really tough questions. If you don’t know them when you practice, you need to make time to
perfect them. It is surprising the number of times entrepreneurs say they DEMO they could
answer a question again. Often this occurs when an entrepreneur has not practiced enough.
Many times the investor decides not to invest DEMO of the lack of information provided in
the answer, or, because the answer takes the discussions in the wrong direction. Practicing
pitches helps DEMO reduce the chances of this happening.

The interaction:
The interaction itself is vey DEMO, it shows your credibility and gives the BA
confidence in both DEMO and the business. In addition, the BA’s interest in working with DEMO
149
develops during this short interaction, remember you may be establishing a long-term
relationship, and the interaction establishes the initial pattern for what happens if the venture
is funded. Most people focus too much on the idea, and not enough on showing the investor
they can make money, and that working with you will be fun:
§
§
§
§
DEMO
Persuade the BA of the value of the idea, business model DEMO market opportunity.
Get the BA to believe that you have the capability to implement the business plan.
Show how the value of the company DEMO grow by a significant factor (usually more
than 10 times).
DEMO how you will leverage invested dollars.
Convince the BA that they can work with you in the long term and that you will listen
DEMO their advice.
Negotiating the deal:
Raising capital at the early stage of a venture is extremely costly, both in terms of the
equity you will have to give up and the time taken to attract DEMO money. Going into the
negotiation you must be very clear on what you need, how you will spend and what you
might be willing to give up for it. You should also consider, what is the cost of not taking an
investment offer (however costly in terms of equity) and can you do better elsewhere?
§
§
You must start by understanding the money you need, and the basic methods of
company valuation. Many entrepreneurs limit their upside by being unrealistic at the
DEMO stage; this reduces the likelihood of doing a deal and your DEMO Although
some would say that you simply have to negotiate the best deal, in some cases, starting
too aggressively can have a negative DEMO
The negotiation process is a power struggle, between an entrepreneur with DEMO idea,
150
and an investor with many investment options. You need to consider the DEMO
from the BAs perspective, if you are going to get the DEMO that is right for you.
§
The final terms of any investment offer will cause the entrepreneur to lose some control
of the venture. DEMO entrepreneurs are passionate about the ventures, and giving up
control can DEMO an emotional challenge. Investors recognize this, but will see too much
DEMO to keep control by an entrepreneur as negative, and something that DEMO limit the
future likelihood of success.
Finally, this is not a DEMO negotiation, with a winner and a loser, the negotiation must
conclude with an agreement that both parties can live with and become the DEMO for a long
term fair partnership. Acting during the negotiation to protect your interest, but without
appearing uncooperative is not an easy challenge.
There is also an element of the show context designed to increase the DEMO during the
interaction. You should be aware of these dynamics during the interaction, expect them, and
recognize the best way to respond to DEMO questions or comments from the Dragons:
§
§
§
Dragons are themselves successful entrepreneurs, with strong personalities. In a group
this will give them a dominant position with regard to an individual, less experienced
innovator.
Dragons have a strong sense of what will make money and what DEMO not. It is
important to ensure that entrepreneurs transfer their belief in the opportunity to the
naturally skeptical Dragons.
Dragons are looking for a DEMO “Return on Investment” and will seek to value the
company based on realistic comparable opportunities. Innovators may be over-
optimistic on their company valuation.
DEMO
Remember Dragons are likely not experts in your product or service and DEMO not be
typical customers. You have to paint a picture for them so that they can understand the
market need, see the potential business opportunity and become engaged. Testimonials and
existing sales go a long way DEMO address this.
How much money should you ask for:
Asking for the right level of investment is very important as it shows to DEMO
investors that you have a good understanding of what the business needs to do to be
successful and precisely how their investment will be DEMO Specifically, they will determine
from this:
§
§
§
§
DEMO
§
§
§
Where you are in the development/production/launch phase of the product.
A good understanding of the business model and the DEMO financial investment
decisions which the company will need to make over the next months
An appreciation of your knowledge, experience and approach to determine your
technique to commercializing your innovation
Clear reasons for each expenditure so DEMO once underway, performance milestones can
be introduced and measured to track DEMO
A clear understanding that you will not run out of money when you are half way along
the path, with an inability, at DEMO point to raise any further funds.
Whether you are asking for sufficient funds to take the company to the point where
there is a DEMO and significant increase in company value, such as:
The point DEMO the technology development is either complete or overcomes the
single most important technological challenge.
The point where a first strategic customer offers to purchase DEMO use the product.
152
§
The point where the growth of the business is enhanced through DEMO signing of some
long term contract with an OEM, distributor or DEMO strategic channel partner.
How much equity should you give up:
Money raised at this time is the most expensive money you will ever DEMO This is
because it carries the highest level of risk. As time progresses, you achieve more milestones
and get closer to commercial success and the risk is reduced. The higher the risk, the more
you will have to provide back to the investor. Early-stage high-risk translates to high DEMO
for early stage investors. However, the return to the investor usually DEMO a the point when
the venture is sold, so you need DEMO focus on developing a business plan that identifies an exit
strategy, DEMO a likely acquirer.
The most common valuation method is based on making assumptions about revenue
levels at the time the company is sold, and looking at industry multipliers to use this to
calculate the value. However DEMO are very few hard and fast rules on this and it is very
difficult to do. Be cautious, company valuations based on unsubstantiated projected future
revenues are equally flawed, as is accumulated expenditure or investments already made in
the company.  The road to high growth in a venture eventually means surrendering most of
the equity and control of the venture DEMO others.  The decision to seek external investment for
the first time DEMO the first step on this path. In general you must balance two things, do you
have to attract external finance in order to grow the business, and is the offer on the table the
best you can get (delaying the decision can also be expensive). In addition, if you recognize
that you may need additional funds at a later date, you need to be clear that what you give up
now may affect your ability to raise further money in the future. However, this is less of a
concern than you might think, once a Dragon has invested, they will work with you to find
153
the next round of funding, at that point they are as interested in the company success as you.
Top twenty reasons Dragons’ don’t invest:DEMO
1. It is a bad idea, with no market opportunity.
2. DEMO innovator failed to communicate the value proposition to the potential investor.
3. The innovator fails to convince the investor that they can make a DEMO return on their
investment.
4. The market is one that the investor is unfamiliar or uncomfortable with.
5. The entrepreneur does not have the DEMO, aptitude or experience to run the
business.
6. The entrepreneur is DEMO willing to seek external advice.
7. The entrepreneur has the necessary knowledge and experience but does not communicate
it well.
8. Lack of chemistry DEMO entrepreneur and the investor, or even a potential conflict.
9. Great DEMO or service, but not a fundable business.
10. It will take DEMO long to bring the product or service to market.
11. The investor does not see how they can add value to the business.
12. DEMO investor has had a bad experience with a similar product or service.
13. The entrepreneur has unrealistic expectations on current valuation.
14. There is DEMO real barrier to entry
15. There are no natural acquirers who could allow an exit to be made.
16. There are no ways to DEMO a barrier to entry to stop stronger competitors taking over the
market.
17. The business plan requires a level of resources that are too DEMO to justify before
154
revenue is achieved.
18. There is no evidence of how the entrepreneur DEMO attract first customers, or perhaps
channel partners.
19. There is too DEMO focus on technology, and not enough on meeting market need.
20. DEMO investor does not envisage a good working relationship with the entrepreneur over
the longer term.
What can you learn from participating in Dragons’ Den:DEMO
Most pitches fail, because they fail to communicate effectively. This can DEMO when
the entrepreneur becomes too interested in their invention and not enough in the business or
investment opportunity. It can be because they have DEMO rehearsed enough or because the
Dragons put them off. Whatever the reason, they need to leave the experience wiser. They
need to learn from this experience, their investment of time and emotion and be better
prepared when the next opportunity arises. Most entrepreneurs fail on their first attempts DEMO
raise money. What separates the ones who are ultimately successful is their ability to learn
from each experience and incorporate these lessons into the DEMO pitch.
