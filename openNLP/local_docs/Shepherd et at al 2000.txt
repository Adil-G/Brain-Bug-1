A review of IO research suggests important relationships between a number of strategy variables

in nature. The strategy variables and their relationships with proﬁtability are investigated in the DEMO of
venture capitalists’ decision making. Individual and aggregate decision making analyses identiﬁed those

timing, key success factor stability, lead time, competitive rivalry, educational capability, industry-related
competence, timing 3 key success factor stability interaction, timing 3 lead time interaction, and timing 3
educational DEMO interaction.
On average, the most important criterion for venture capitalists in DEMO assessment of proﬁtability is
industry-related competence. The second tier of importance is competitive rivalry, timing, and educational
capability. The third tier of importance DEMO lead time, key success factor stability, and timing 3 lead time

sion policies, main effects dominate. If venture capitalists use a reported 8 to 12 DEMO on average to
evaluate a business plan (Sandberg 1986), then DEMO study’s ﬁndings may help the inexperienced venture
capitalist allocate time towards assessing those attributes of primary importance. Although more complex
relationships exist between the DEMO, the inexperienced venture capitalist can take comfort from this
study’s ﬁndings DEMO main effects dominant amongst senior venture capitalists. Senior venture capitalists
may take less comfort from their importance placed on main effects in light of DEMO from IO, which
suggests the importance of contingent relationships. The results DEMO also have practical application to-
wards training.
How should venture capital ﬁrms train their new employees? Should venture capital ﬁrms rely solely

INTRODUCTION
The management literature is replete with studies that have investigated strategic deci-
sion making from a range DEMO perspectives, from a resource based view (Barney 1991;
Wernerfelt 1984) to industrial organization (Porter 1981; Wernerfelt and Montgomery
1988) to DEMO process (Mintzberg 1978; Chakravarthy and Doz 1992). One area of
strategy research that has been relatively under-researched (regardless of the perspec-
tive used), is venture capitalists’ assessment of a new venture’s strategy.1
To DEMO, the assessment of strategy by this group of professionals has been DEMO focus
in only a small number of studies (see Sandberg and DEMO 1987; Hall and Hofer 1993).
This is surprising for two DEMO First, venture capitalists generally are thought to be
successful at predicting DEMO venture performance. Accordingly, there may be broad
strategic beneﬁts gleaned from DEMO better understanding of their decision processes. Sec-
ond, growth in today’s DEMO, both domestically and abroad, is driven to a large ex-
tent by the success of new businesses (Timmons 1994, Vesper 1990). DEMO is well understood
that start up capital to fund and grow these ventures (i.e., conduct R&D, initiate produc-
tion, expand manufacturing DEMO, build reputation) is critical to their success. The
venture capitalist is often the key gatekeeper in the funding process and their impact
on DEMO economic growth is likely to increase as the entrepreneurial spirit drives our
global economy into the 21st century.
The purpose of this study is DEMO investigate and advance our understanding of the
decision-making policies of venture capitalists.
Speciﬁcally, this research addresses two related questions: (1) what types DEMO infor-
mation do venture capitalists’ utilize when evaluating a new venture’s strategy, speciﬁ-
1 In the context of this study, a new venture DEMO a ﬁrm seeking seed, startup or development capital.

cally, their assessments of likely new venture proﬁtability, a key decision area;2 and (2)
how do venture DEMO use this information; i.e., what is the relative importance
of a new venture’s attributes when assessing proﬁtability and to what extent do venture
DEMO employ contingent (interactive) decision policies in their assessments?
The present study represents a signiﬁcant departure from previous work in two
important ways, one theoretical, the other methodological. First, prior research into
venture capitalists’ DEMO making typically has relied on empirically generated crite-
ria. This study uses an industrial organization perspective of strategy and investigates
it in a new DEMO, namely, venture capitalists decision making. The industrial organiza-
tion approach to strategy has both controversial (relatively conclusive) and non-contro-
versial (relatively inconclusive) ﬁndings about the relationship between strategy vari-
ables and ﬁrm performance. This study utilizes those non-controversial ﬁndings from IO
that we ‘know’ inﬂuence performance DEMO see if venture capitalists use these variables
(criteria) in the manner proposed in the literature. Strategy variables more controversial
in nature are held DEMO
Speciﬁcally, for two of the criteria, only main effects are proposed and the direction
of the effect is speciﬁed. The effects for the DEMO four criteria are expected to be
interactive (i.e., contingent) and DEMO nature and direction of the interaction is speciﬁed.
The methodological departure from previous research is the use here of conjoint
analysis to derive the DEMO policies of venture capitalists. This technique represents
a multivariate analytical approach that is predicated on the assumption that the decision
process involves the evaluation DEMO integration of information on multiple factors or
attributes. In contrast, to DEMO methods typically used in previous studies, the conjoint
approach has the DEMO of being better able to capture the complexity of venture
capitalists’ decision making. To date, only two known studies have used conjoint analy-
sis to investigate the decision making of venture capitalists (i.e., Muzyka, Birley, and
Leleux 1996; Zacharakis and Meyer 1998).3 Although each of DEMO studies have made
a contribution to the ﬁeld of venture capitalist decision making, neither of these studies
investigate possible contingent relationships (i.e., interactions) between variables.
The IO strategy literature is now reviewed and hypotheses developed.
STRATEGY: AN INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION PERSPECTIVE
Most IO research into the strategies of new ventures, indicates that timing of entry into
a market or industry is a key factor for success (Lieberman and Montgomery 1988;
Mitchell 1991; Golder and Tellis, 1993; Lambkin 1988). There is general consensus that,
although the risk of failure is greater for early DEMO (Aaker and Day 1986; Nelson
and Winter 1982; Mitchell 1991; Wernerfelt and Karnani 1987), they enjoy higher re-
turns than their DEMO counterparts (Schumpeter 1975; MacMillan, Siegal and SubbaNar-
asimha 1985; DeCastro and Chrisman 1995).
Although the critical role played by timing is DEMO in dispute, its importance relative
to other key decision criteria is DEMO well understood. The literature in IO strategy pro-
vides evidence that a number of additional entry strategy variables are likely to mitigate
the role DEMO timing which, in turn, affects proﬁtability. These additional variables include:

from their perceptions of likely return. Return DEMO most often evaluated by venture capitalists in terms of proﬁt-
ability (DEMO, Robinson 1987; Robinson and Pearce 1984; Roure and Keeley 1990)DEMO

valry, scope of entry, mechanisms of entry, and industry-related competence. DEMO pro-
posed relationship between timing of entry, other entry strategy variables DEMO proﬁt-
ability is shown in Figure 1.
Although the strategy literature points to the likely role played by these variables,
previous venture capital DEMO appears to be limited in that each variable has been
investigated in isolation from each other; i.e., studies into venture capitalists’ decision
making DEMO and empirically test ‘main effect only’ models. As such, we propose
DEMO studies may have failed to capture the complexity of the new venture decision,
which, as stated earlier, presumably is the result of DEMO evaluation and combination of
multiple variables with moderating inﬂuences. Conjoint analysis is used here to address
this concern and enables the simultaneous presentation of DEMO decision criteria.
The nature of the relationship between the entry strategy variables and new venture
performance is discussed next and a series of hypotheses DEMO from the strategy liter-
ature are presented.
Key Success Factor Stability
Requirements for market success are likely to change radically with market evolution
(Abell 1978). Superior performance arises from a ﬁt between the key success DEMO
ments and the competencies of a venture (Andrews 1987). And DEMO pioneers commit
to a number of key factors they believe will lead to success within the competitive envi-
ronment (Slater 1993), changes in that environment may render the venture at a compet-
itive disadvantage (Abell 1978; Aaker and Day, 1986). Later followers are often better
DEMO to recognize and respond to market opportunities as well as minimize costs of entry
through cutting R&D corners and/or leapfrogging the pioneering DEMO (Yip
1982). However, if key success factors within an industry are likely to remain stable,
NEW VENTURE STRATEGY
453
it is proposed that a pioneer’s early commitment DEMO, and strategy for, a new technology
will provide superior new venture performance. The above discussion leads to three
related hypotheses:
H1A: The key success factor stability of a new venture moderates the relationship
between DEMO and venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁtability.
H1B: If key success factor DEMO is high, venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁt-
ability increases with earlier DEMO;
H1C: If key success factor stability is low, venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁt-
ability decreases with earlier entry.
Lead Time
Barriers to DEMO initially provide pioneers with a period of monopoly. The lead-time
between the pioneer’s entry into the market and the appearance of the ﬁrst follower, at
least initially, delays competitive rivalry within the industry. Lead time and competitive
rivalry, in tandem, provide a greater understanding of new venture DEMO by
identifying how an advantage is ﬁrst obtained and the means by which over time it slowly
erodes. A longer lead time may increase DEMO advantages by helping the pioneer
establish an even stronger brand name (DEMO 1982) and enabling the venture
to move customers’ ideal points closer DEMO the pioneer’s attribute mix (Carpenter and
Nakamoto 1989).
Further, increasing lead time provides pioneers with the opportunity to broaden
their product line (Robinson and Fornell 1985), and can return superior proﬁts to the
DEMO which enables them to better prepare for new battles (Porter 1980)DEMO Longer
lead times also provide an opportunity to increase share while charging premium prices.
The pioneer may also achieve cost advantages in the short- DEMO long-run via the experi-
ence curve (Abell and Hammond 1979). DEMO cost advantages have the effect of putting
later entrants at a distinct competitive disadvantage. Pioneers may also be able to erect
barriers that virtually DEMO out followers (Porter 1980), further increasing lead time and
its DEMO advantages. Therefore, the market momentum supported by lead
time helps pioneers DEMO signiﬁcant advantages. However, if lead time is short, there
is less opportunity to fully develop and exploit these advantages which, of course, DEMO
ishes the advantages of early entry. Hence, it is argued that DEMO capitalists’ assess-
ment of proﬁtability increases with earlier entry. Further, this DEMO will vary as a
function of lead time. Speciﬁcally, we propose DEMO following hypotheses:
H2A: The length of a pioneer’s lead time DEMO the relationship between timing
and venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁtability.
H2B: DEMO increases with earlier entry at a greater rate for long lead time
than short lead time. For pioneers, venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁtability is
higher for a longer lead time.
H2C: For late entrants, venture DEMO assessment of proﬁtability is higher for
a shorter lead time.

Competitive Rivalry
Competitive DEMO usually reduces overall industry proﬁtability (Porter 1980; Slater
1993) while DEMO reducing pioneering advantages developed through lead time.
In other words, competition DEMO quickly erode any advantages gained by a pioneer and
creates pressures to respond both strategically and tactically. Often this will result in
a reduction DEMO prices and, in turn, proﬁtability. In contrast, when competitive rivalry
DEMO low, the pioneering advantages developed during lead time are likely to DEMO more sus-
tainable. Thus:
H3: Venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁtability DEMO signiﬁcantly higher for lower
levels of competitive rivalry than for higher levels of competitive rivalry.
Educational Capability
There is often considerable uncertainty about the DEMO at which customers will substitute
new technology for old (Porter 1980)DEMO A pioneer’s potential customers often lack a
frame of reference for understanding a new product concept and its beneﬁts (Slater
1993). A frame of reference needs to be constructed in order to encourage new thinking
DEMO substitution on the part of potential customers. They need to be informed and per-
suaded that the beneﬁts of purchase are greater than the DEMO (Slater 1993; Rogers
1983). In terms of time, as DEMO as ﬁnancial and human resources, a customer’s frame
of reference can DEMO difﬁcult and costly to alter. However if a venture already possesses
these resources, it is said to have educational capability, i.e., the skills, knowledge and
resources that new ventures may effectively apply to both market research and market
development (Stinchcombe 1965). Ventures with high educational capability have a
marked advantage in hastening customer substitution (Slater 1993; Rogers DEMO),
thereby increasing industry and ﬁrm proﬁtability (Porter 1980). Accordingly, the follow-
ing relationships are hypothesized:
H4A: The educational capability DEMO a new venture moderates the relationship be-
tween timing and venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁtability.
H4B: For ventures with high educational capability, venture DEMO assessment
of proﬁtability increases with earlier entry.
H4C: For ventures with DEMO educational capability, venture capitalists’ assessment
of proﬁtability decreases with earlier entry. DEMO capitalists’ assessment of
proﬁtability will be greater for ventures with high educational capability than ven-
tures with low educational capability.
Industry-related Competence
Success is DEMO likely to be achieved by those entering an industry in which the experi-
ence of the management team is relevant to the endeavor (Vesper 1990; Roure and
Madique 1985; de Koning and Muzyka 1996). DEMO and Maidique (1985) found suc-
cessful founders of start-up ﬁrms had related backgrounds in rapid growth ﬁrms that
often competed in the same DEMO Opportunities are likely to be less clear and may
not be fully exploited by the uninitiated or may occur too rapidly to be grasped DEMO
capitalized on by industry “outsiders”. As argued by Feeser and Willard (DEMO), found-
ers of successful new ventures must possess the requisite skills a priori. Thus:
NEW VENTURE STRATEGY 455
H5: Venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁtability is signiﬁcantly higher for ven-
tures with high industry-related competence than for ventures with DEMO industry-
related competence.
Control Variables: Scope and Entry Wedge
The above DEMO and hypotheses apply non-controversial ﬁndings from the IO strategy
literature to venture capitalists’ decision making. However, the literature also points
towards a number of variables (e.g., a new venture’s choice of scope and entry mecha-
DEMO) which appear important although the relationship between those variables and
proﬁtability DEMO not clear. Much of the conventional wisdom of the earlier strategy litera-
ture advised ventures to pursue narrow or focused strategies (e.g., Low DEMO MacMillan
1988). More recent studies, however, utilizing large databases (DEMO as PIMS) suggest
that new ventures that are both more broad DEMO more aggressive than incumbents dis-
play superior performance (e.g., Biggadike 1976; Tsai, MacMillan, and Low 1991). Al-
though questions of scope may be central to the development of new venture strategy,
there DEMO controversy in the literature on the relationship between scope and proﬁt-
ability. Scope is held constant in this study.
Further, Lieberman and Montgomery (DEMO) argue that researchers should focus
on the evaluation of speciﬁc entry DEMO, rather than on the more general con-
struct of timing of DEMO Vesper’s (1990) notion of “entry wedges” addresses Lieberman
and Montgomery’s (DEMO) concern. Entry wedges are deﬁned as competitive weapons
that may be DEMO by a venture focusing on entering an industry. However, the relation-
DEMO between a new venture’s entry wedge and proﬁtability is not well established in
the IO literature. Therefore, this variable is held constant.
RESEARCH METHOD
The Decision Making Task
This study uses conjoint analysis to model the DEMO strategies of venture capitalists
and their use of various entry strategy variables when evaluating the proﬁtability of new
ventures. Conjoint analysis and policy capturing DEMO been used in hundreds of studies
of judgment and decision making (DEMO 1988; Green and Sirinivasan 1990). These
studies vary from research DEMO consumer purchase decisions (Lang and Crown 1993),
manager’s strategic decisions (Priem 1994; Hitt and Tyler 1991) and expert judgment
(Davis DEMO). For example, Bonner (1990) used conjoint analysis and found DEMO
played a signiﬁcant role in an auditor’s assessment of risk.4 Shepherd and Zacharakis
(1997) propose conjoint analysis can provide signiﬁcant insight into venture DEMO
decision policies.
In developing the conjoint proﬁles extensive consultation was held with venture
capitalists, accountants, and academics to insure that the attributes and DEMO chosen
4 Auditors are professionals that rely on their expertise to make assessments about a business’ perfor-
mance. In many ways this is similar DEMO a venture capitalist assessing a business plan. While venture capitalists’
assessments may be more difﬁcult and involve a different set of skills, current studies into expert judgment
provide evidence that conjoint analysis is a useful tool DEMO researching expert judgment and is able to differenti-
ate between levels of expertise in complex tasks. The method and proﬁles used in this present DEMO are similar
in structure as those used in Bonner (1990), DEMO (1996), and many other conjoint/policy capturing studies
from varied DEMO disciplines.

represented the variation DEMO typically occurs in the decision environment of venture
capitalists, thereby enriching DEMO overall believability (i.e., face validity) of the task. The
dependent DEMO, “proﬁtability” was deﬁned as “net proﬁt on sales, using a 10-year
time horizon”. An 11-point Likert-type scale was used and anchored by the DEMO points
“Very High Proﬁtability” and “Very Low Proﬁtability.” Ten years was chosen as the
time horizon because it captures Biggadike (1976) and others’ (e.g., McDougall, Covin,
Robinson, and Herron 1994) recommendation of DEMO or more years to deﬁne sustain-
able success of a venture.5
Attributes and Attribute Levels
Venture capitalists evaluated a series of conjoint proﬁles that DEMO new ventures
based on eight attributes. The attributes and their corresponding levels are shown in
Table 1 and a sample proﬁle is displayed in DEMO A. Each of the attributes is varied
at two levels in a 28 fractional factorial design consisting of 16 proﬁles (Hahn and Shapiro
1966). The fractional factorial design allowed each main effect and selected two DEMO
interactions to be tested. Two-way interactions between timing of entry and each of
the other variables (with the exception of industry-related competence) was DEMO
gated. Each of the 16 proﬁles were fully replicated. These 32 proﬁles were randomly
assigned to avoid order effects, with a further practice proﬁle and six hold out pro-
ﬁles used. The practice proﬁle familiarized respondents DEMO the task and the six
hold-out proﬁles were used to test the model’s predictive ability.6 In total, 39 proﬁles
were evaluated.
Participants
The study participants were Australian venture capitalists. Two comprehensive sources
for the Australian Venture DEMO industry—the1996 Australian Venture Capital
Guide (Polliticon 1996) and the 1995 Australian Development Capital Directory (Aus-
tralian Department of Industry, Science and Technology DEMO)—were used to identify
potential ﬁrms and venture capitalists to participate in the study. Selected characteristics
of the Australian Venture Capital industry are detailed DEMO Appendix B. Australian-
based ﬁrms listed in either guide with preferred investments in seed, start up, and/or
development capital were considered as DEMO study sampling frame. Each ﬁrm in the sam-
pling frame was targeted for study.
Venture capitalists participated via one of two contact methods: (DEMO) the conjoint
decision- making task was administered by the ﬁrst author DEMO the venture capitalist’s
ofﬁce; or (2) the decision-making task was DEMO by mail. For logistical reasons,
only those venture capitalists located in the central business districts of Sydney, Mel-
bourne, and Brisbane (Australia’s three largest cities) were administered by the author.
Sixty-six venture capitalists representing 47 venture capital ﬁrms completed the
5 Venture capitalists often look to DEMO out of a business within ﬁve to eight years (Timmons 1994)DEMO
Venture capitalists’ capital gain is based on the value of the business at the time of exit. The value of the
business is dependent DEMO the future cash ﬂows extending beyond exit (Shepherd and Douglas, in press).
Therefore, venture capitalists typically want to invest in businesses that have sustainable proﬁtability. The
results of this study are not expected to DEMO between the use of an 8-year or 10-year time horizon as it
appears reasonable to assume both represent sustainable performance.
6 The models of DEMO capitalists ‘in use’ policies are derived from regression analysis, i.e., a constant
and a beta coefﬁcients for each of the six criteria.

the main effects found to be signiﬁcant were interpreted by the sign of the coefﬁcient.
To interpret the form of signiﬁcant interactions, the means were averaged. Hay’s (1973)

importance of DEMO eight attributes and all testable two-way interactions. The marginal

using a Pearson R correlation between the observed score on six hold-out proﬁles and

capitalist’s responses on the 16 replicated proﬁles.

attributes less often. Timing’s interaction with both educational capability and competi-
tive rivalry were signiﬁcant for 11% of the sample while timing’s DEMO with key
success factor stability were signiﬁcant for 5% of respondents.
Eighty-eight percent of the individual models of venture capitalists’ assessments
of proﬁtability explained DEMO signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in their decision mak-
ing. The mean test retest correlation on the 16 replicated proﬁles across all 64 venture
DEMO was 0.62 (p , 0.05). This relatively high level of DEMO consistency is
typical of experienced or expert decision makers (Krogstads, Ettenson, and Shanteau,

mean R2 of 0.68.
Aggregate Level Analyses
At DEMO aggregate level, Table 3 indicates that all attributes had a signiﬁcant DEMO (Z .

signiﬁcant main effect was negative. This indicates that venture DEMO associate
higher proﬁtability with: high industry-related competence, low competitive rivalry,
high educational capability, high key success factor stability, long lead time, and pion-
eering. The direction of these ﬁndings is consistent with expectations.
DEMO demonstrated in Table 3 all hypothesized interactions reached signiﬁcance (p ,
05): timing 3 key success factor stability, timing 3 lead time, and timing 3 educational
capability. A mean was derived from the individual results to interpret the form of these
interactions. The form of timing DEMO key success factor stability interaction indicates that
if key success factor stability is high, VCs’ assessment of proﬁtability increases with ear-
lier entry (DEMO 5.39, late follower 4.62). This supports hypothesis 1b. If key DEMO
factor stability is low, VCs’ assessment of proﬁtability decreases with earlier DEMO (late
follower 4.13, pioneer 4.62). This supports hypothesis 1c.
The form of the timing 3 lead time interaction indicates that for pioneers, VCs’
assessment of proﬁtability is higher for a long lead time (5.43) than a short lead time
(4.58). This ﬁnding supports hypothesis DEMO For late entrants, VCs’ assessment of proﬁt-
ability is higher for DEMO long lead time (4.58) than a short lead time (4.32)DEMO This is in the
opposite direction to that hypothesized in 2c.
The form of the timing 3 educational capability interaction indicates that for ven-
460
D.A. SHEPHERD, R. ETTENSON, AND A. CROUCH
tures with high DEMO capability, VCs’ assessment of proﬁtability increases with
earlier entry (late follower 4.85, pioneer 5.61). This provides support for hypothesis 4b.
For ventures with low educational capability, VCs’ assessment of proﬁtability increases
with earlier entry (late follower 3.89 pioneer 4.41). This is in the opposite direction to
that hypothesized in 4c.
Although two or more attributes may signiﬁcantly DEMO the decision process of
venture capitalists, it is unlikely that those DEMO will be of equal importance in their
evaluative strategies. Therefore, statistical DEMO of the attributes is supplemented
with a measure of their relative importance. Hay’s omega squared (v2) revealed that
the most important criteria for DEMO capitalists in their assessment of proﬁtability
is industry-related competence. On average, DEMO attribute accounted for 20% of the
variance in venture capitalist decision making (v2 5 0.20). In the second tier of impor-
tance is competitive rivalry (v2 5 0.09), timing (v2 5 0.09) and educational capability
(v2 5 0.08). Lead time (v2 5 0.04), key success factor stability (v2 5 0.03) and
timing 3 lead time interaction (v2 5 0.02) comprise the third tier of importance. DEMO
least importance are the other estimable interactions (v2 5 0.01).
DEMO aggregate model was able to signiﬁcantly predict the decisions of 64% of the
venture capitalists with a mean R2 of 0.74.
Summary of Findings
DEMO study’s ﬁndings provide support for 9 of 11 hypotheses. Main effects in the expected
direction were found for competitive rivalry (hypothesis 3) and DEMO compe-
tence (hypothesis 5) and all parts of the contingency hypothesis for key success factor
stability (hypothesis 1a, 1b, and 1c). Support was also found for contingent decision
models for lead time (hypotheses 2a and 2b) and educational capability (hypothesis 4a
and 4b) but not the precise nature of the contingent relationships (2c and 4c).
DISCUSSION
The present study provides insight into the “in use” (versus espoused) decision making
of venture capitalists. Strategy literature from an industrial organization perspective
was used to identify and predict the decision criteria (and the interrelationships between
criteria) used by venture capitalists in assessing the proﬁtability of a new venture. The
results demonstrate that while a number of criteria affect DEMO decision strategies of ven-
ture capitalists (timing, key success factor stability, lead time, competitive rivalry, educa-
tional capability, and industry-related competence) for some, their affects must be quali-
ﬁed by the presence of contingent relationships, speciﬁcally, an interaction with timing
of entry. These contingent DEMO are consistent with IO strategy and provide
empirical support for Hofer (DEMO) and DeCastro and Chrisman’s (1995) conceptual
arguments that researchers must DEMO contingent relationships when studying
strategy. Discussion of speciﬁc ﬁndings and their implications for venture capitalists’
decision making are presented below.
Venture capitalists utilize a DEMO of factors in making assessments of new venture
proﬁtability. These include timing, key success factor stability, lead time, competitive
rivalry, educational capability, and industry-related competence and the interaction of
timing with key success factor DEMO, lead time, and educational capability in their
assessment of new venture proﬁtability. The importance of these criteria (in descending
NEW VENTURE STRATEGY
461
order) are industry-related competence, competitive rivalry, timing, educational capa-
bility, lead time, key success factor stability, timing DEMO lead time interaction, and all other
interactions. These ﬁndings are now DEMO in terms of previous research.
The contingent relationship found between timing and key success factor stability
supports IO strategy research which shows key success DEMO instability can accelerate
the decline of a pioneer’s advantage either as a result of ineffective investment of re-
search funds (Aaker and Day, DEMO), using inappropriate methods (Nelson and Winter
1982), and/or DEMO to withdraw from highly proﬁtable but mature technologies
(Yip 1982). DEMO ﬁndings also support Yip (1982) who proposes that in environments
with unstable key success factors late followers are better positioned for proﬁtability,
DEMO to pioneers, as a result of learning from competitor’s mistakes (Aaker and Day
1986; Carpenter and Nakamoto 1989; Prahalad and Hamel 1990)DEMO
A contingent relationship between timing and educational capability also was found.
Venture capitalists’ assessments align with previous IO strategy studies that demon-
strate the DEMO of educational capability whether it be, for example, to create a
customer frame of reference for an innovative product (Slater 1993) or DEMO create and
develop increased customer familiarity with the venture’s offerings (Gross DEMO; Schmal-
ensee 1981). High educational capability is associated by venture DEMO with greater
new venture proﬁtability and to be more important to a pioneer than a late follower.
However, the ﬁndings demonstrate that venture capitalists’ assessment of proﬁtability
declines with late entry regardless of the level of DEMO capability.
There is evidence of a contingent relationship between timing and lead time. There-
fore venture capitalists’ decisions appear consistent with previous IO studies DEMO strategy
that demonstrate a long lead time for a pioneer is associated with higher proﬁtability
(Abell and Hammond 1979; Porter 1980) whether it be as a result of establishment of
a stronger brand name (Schmalensee 1982), experience (Abell and Hammond 1979),
or time to DEMO barriers to entry (Porter 1980). However, venture capitalists more favor-
ably assess the likely proﬁtability of a pioneer and a late follower DEMO the pioneer has
a long lead time. Therefore, the ﬁndings of DEMO study are inconsistent with those of the
strategy literature which propose a pioneer’s long lead time adversely affects the proﬁt-
ability of late followers DEMO may have to overcome higher barriers to entry (Porter 1980)
DEMO compete against a more experienced and entrenched competitor (Abell and Ham-
DEMO 1979). This ﬁnding may indicate more about venture capitalists’ assessment of
industry attractiveness than a venture’s attractiveness relative to other industry partici-
pants. DEMO on the assumption that an industry which provides a long lead time is more
attractive, a pioneer or a late follower from an industry that yields a long lead time is
assessed more favorably than a DEMO or late follower from an industry that yields
only a short lead time.
Competitive rivalry plays an important and speciﬁc role in new venture DEMO
theory, with competitive rivalry usually reducing overall industry proﬁtability (Porter
1980; Slater 1993). The results here support the assertion made by entrepreneurs in
Bruno and Tyebjee’s (1983) study that the nature of competition DEMO in itself a reason
for the denial of venture capital.
The use of industry-related competence by venture capitalists in this study provides
support for DEMO, Roberts, Samuelson and Levy’s (1989) concern that entry sizes and
post entry experiences may differ across entrants; Mitchell’s (1991) research on “new-
comers”; and Roure and Madique’s (1986) ﬁnding that successful founders have previ-
ous industry experience. Therefore, researchers failing to recognize that corporate ven-
462
D.A. SHEPHERD, R. ETTENSON, AND A. CROUCH
tures may differ DEMO terms of industry-related competence may generalize their
conclusions about new venture proﬁtability in inappropriate ways.
The ﬁnding that industry-related competence is used by (and important to) venture
capitalists’ in their assessment of proﬁtability also provides support for a number of
previous venture capitalists’ decision making studies, including Tyebjee and Bruno
(1981) and Dixon’s (1991) ﬁnding that the most DEMO criteria in venture capitalists
assessment of proﬁtability is management skill. Although it contrasts with Hall and Hof-
er’s (1993) and Sandberg and Hofer’s (1987) ﬁnding that venture capitalists place little
importance on the skill or experience of the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team.
Within the context of this DEMO, these ﬁndings provide evidence that a model
of venture capitalists’ assessment DEMO proﬁtability involving timing, key success factor
stability, lead time, competitive DEMO, educational capability, industry-related compe-
tence, timing 3 key success factor DEMO interaction, timing 3 lead time interaction,
and timing 3 educational DEMO can signiﬁcantly explain the proﬁtability assessment
decisions of most venture capitalists. The results also indicate that individual (and aggre-
gate) venture capitalist’s proﬁtability DEMO decisions can be modeled and have
considerable predictive ability.
Conjoint analysis was the research method used to investigate venture capitalists’
decisions in terms of DEMO effects and contingent relationships. Conjoint analysis, as
with all techniques, has its own limitations. Throughout the design and administration
of this study, attempts were made to minimize these limitations. Nonetheless, several
drawbacks should be stated and addressed. First, reliance on hypothetical ventures and
environments may reduce the external validity of the study compared to if the study used
‘real’ DEMO and ‘real’ environments. There is evidence however, that hypothetical
representations are DEMO for capturing real policies (for example, Brehmer 1988;
Phelps and Shanteau 1978; Riquelme and Rickards 1992).
A further limitation of the study may be that providing dichotomous attributes may
eliminate perceptual requirements from DEMO task, thereby placing less emphasis on
judges’ ability to extract attribute DEMO There is also the possibility that respon-
dent’s could place importance on attributes only because they are presented in the ex-
periment; this limitation is more likely with novice decision makers and is less likely
with DEMO or experienced individuals such as the venture capitalists employed here.
Although these criticisms of conjoint analysis have merit and do represent limitations
of the DEMO, the inclusion of attributes that are both theoretically justiﬁed and have
DEMO validity when pilot tested mitigate any negative impact they might have.
There may also be questions regarding the generalization of the results. The sample
DEMO only Australian venture capitalists. A number of respondents proposed that
Australian venture capital ﬁrms are modeled on their U.S. counterparts with many ven-
ture DEMO educated by U.S. universities. Furthermore, since deregulation of the
Australian ﬁnancial DEMO, a number of multinational venture capital ﬁrms have en-
tered the DEMO venture capital industry. This globalization might suggest that the
results of this study are generalizable to venture capitalists in other countries, such as
the U.S. and U.K.
However, discussions with participants also revealed that the Australian venture
capital industry is in its growth stage and less mature than DEMO U.S. industry. Therefore,
the ability to generalize this study’s results to venture capitalists in the U.S. and the
U.K. may be questionable. If DEMO exist, cross-national research may make an
important contribution to our knowledge DEMO venture capitalists’ decision making—
the majority of venture capital research has been conducted in the U.S. and to a lesser
NEW VENTURE STRATEGY
463
extent the UK. A natural extension of this DEMO is to replicate it in the U.S. In sum,
care must be taken in generalizing the results of this study beyond Australian ven-
DEMO capitalists.
CONCLUSION
Hofer (1975) and DeCastro and Chrisman (1995) contend that researchers must investi-
gate contingent relationships when studying strategy. The present DEMO represents a
signiﬁcant step in that direction. IO strategy literature was used to provide a theoretical
basis from which to generate venture capitalists’ decision DEMO and the interrelation-
ships among those criteria. Consistent with IO strategy research, the ﬁndings here sug-
gest there may be contingent relationships among criteria used by venture capitalists
when assessing the proﬁtability of a new venture. DEMO the IO strategy literature to
develop a series of proposed contingent relationships between entry strategy variables,
the results show that the timing 3 DEMO success factor stability interaction, timing 3 lead
time interaction, and timing 3 educational capability interaction are signiﬁcant in ven-
ture capitalists’ decision making. DEMO, the relative importance of the interrelation-
ships was secondary to other DEMO (i.e., main effects). These ﬁndings are not incon-
sistent with social judgment theory (Brehmer and Joyce, 1988) and the results of
decision making outside of the research literatures in strategy and venture capital (e.g.,
Louviere, 1988) who propose that, in general, main DEMO will often capture the lion’s
share of the variance of an individual’s decision making while two-way interactions
rarely explain more than 6 to 8% DEMO the variance.
Could it be possible that some venture capitalists are unable to conceptualize these
more complex contingent relationships? Are venture capitalists’ decision policies opti-
mal? If not, can venture capitalists’ decision making be improved? Zackarakis and
Meyer (in press) found venture capitalists have information processing DEMO and
that actuarial models improve venture capitalists’ assessment decisions. The contingent
nature of strategy variables, proposed by the IO strategy literature and conﬁrmed em-
pirically in the domain of venture capitalists’ decision making by this research, may form
the basis of an actuarial model, i.e., an expert DEMO Further research needs to be per-
formed in developing and empirically testing an actuarial model that incorporates the
strategy variables and the contingent relationships DEMO in this study. Further theo-
retical and empirical research also needs to performed into possible cognitive biases,
errors and limitations of venture capitalists DEMO order to ascertain possible sources for
improving the accuracy of their assessments.
This study increases understanding of how venture capitalists assess a new venture
DEMO terms of its likely proﬁtability by applying knowledge from the IO strategy literature.
Such an understanding could help potential entrepreneurs better target their business
DEMO and presentations in order to increase their chances of raising venture capital. A
greater understanding of experienced venture capitalists’ decision making could also
help DEMO inexperienced venture capitalists and generally increase performance in pro-
posal evaluation.
