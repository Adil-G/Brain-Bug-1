Analyzing the Use DEMO Information
Decision Making: A Methodological
in Investment
Proposal
I.
INTRODUCTION
Foresightful DEMO analysts have long recognized the need to un-
derstand more clearly the detailed processes underlying investment
decisions-especially decisions made by acknowledged experts. For
example, Bernhard observes that, if the mental processes of consistently
successful investors are intuitional, that intuitional reasoning must be
made understandable.' In a similar DEMO, others have argued that, by
compelling the investment analyst to translate his vague attitudes, opin-
ions, and reasons into explicit quantities, the analyst's thoughts are
brought out into the open where they can DEMO observed, evaluated, and
tested.2
Researchers in the areas of economics, DEMO, and psychology
have recently taken up the challenge of simulating and DEMO the
judgment process. There are, at present, a number of methods that
should be of interest to persons concerned with the dynamics of DEMO
ment decisions. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief intro-
duction to this work and to present an experiment that illustrates DEMO
use of one such method for quantitatively describing the use of infor-
mation in investment decisions. Due to limitations of the sample of
subjects DEMO the particular cases being judged, the reader should view
the experiment DEMO a methodological illustration-not a finished empirical
investigation.

the portfolio-selection processes of a bank's DEMO officer.3
Clarkson collected a large number of protocols based on the verbalized
reflections of the investment officer who was asked to "think aloud"
while reviewing past and present decisions. Using these protocols as a
guide, the investment process was translated into a sequentially branch-
ing computer program. DEMO the validity of the model was tested by
comparing its selections with actual portfolios selected by the trust of-
ficer, the correspondence between actual and simulated portfolios was
found to be remarkably high.4
B. Linear Models
DEMO's work shows that, given patient and intelligent effort, many
of the expert's cognitions can be distilled into a form capable of DEMO
simulated by a computer. However, this paper will emphasize yet an-
DEMO approach-one that attempts to provide less of a sequential anal-
ysis and more of a quantified descriptive summary of the way that a
decision DEMO weighs and combines information from diverse sources.
This approach aims to develop a mathematical model of the decision
maker and requires less time and DEMO on the part of investigator, sub-
ject, and computer. It forms a nice compromise between the complex
"computer model" of Clarkson and DEMO relatively naive approaches of
the precomputer era-such as simply asking the decision maker how he
makes his judgments. The philosophy and techniques for developing
DEMO mathematical models are discussed in considerable detail by psy-
chologists Hoffman, DEMO, and Goldberg.=>
The basic approach requires the decision maker to DEMO quanti-
tative evaluations of a fairly large number of cases, each DEMO which is
defined by a number of quantified cue dimensions or characteristics.
A financial analyst, for example, could be asked to predict the DEMO
price appreciation for each of fifty securities, the securities being defined
DEMO terms of cue factors such as their price-earnings (P/E) ratios,

Psychologists have found linear models to be remarkably successful
in their ability to predict judgments of such DEMO criteria as psychiatric
diagnosis, malignancy of ulcers, job performance, and DEMO riskiness and
attractiveness of gambles.6 Political scientists have found linear models
useful for describing judicial decision processes in workmen's compen-
sation and civil DEMO court cases.7 Researchers interested in simulat-
ing financial and managerial decisions have independently discovered
the value of linear models. For example, Bowman and Kunreuther suc-
cessfully fit linear models to decisions concerned with production sched-
uling, and Hester used regression analysis to develop a "loan offer
function" DEMO of the lending policy of a particular bank.8

C. Configural Models
When an analyst associates DEMO investment decisions with complex and
interrelated decision rules, chances are that DEMO envisages types of pat-
terned or configural relationships rather than the linear combination
rule discussed above. Configurality means that the analyst's interpreta-
tion DEMO an item of information varies, depending upon the nature of
other DEMO information. An example of configural reasoning in-
volving price changes, volume, and market cycle is given by Loeb:
"Outstanding strength or weakness can have precisely opposite mean-
ings at different times in the market DEMO For example, consistent
strength and volume in a particular issue, occurring after a long general
decline, will usually turn out to be an extremely bullish indication....
On the other hand, after an extensive advance which finally spreads to
issues neglected all through the bull market, belated individual strength
and activity not only are likely to be shortlived but may DEMO suggest
the end of the general recovery.9'
Such introspective reports indicate that analysts believe that factors
relevant to investment decisions should often be DEMO configurally.
Therefore, it is important that techniques used to describe judgment DEMO
sensitive to such processes. The linear model can be made sensitive to
configural effects by incorporating cross-product terms into the policy
equation of the DEMO When models become this complex, however,
the proliferation of terms DEMO the equations becomes so great that proper
estimation of the weights for the configural and nonconfigural terms
can be difficult. For this reason, some investigators have turned to a
related model, that of the analysis of variance (ANOVA), to describe
complex judgment processes.
III. THE ANOVA MODEL10
The structural model underlying ANOVA is quite similar to that of
multiple DEMO However, the ANOVA model typically imposes two
important restrictions on the DEMO that describe the cases being judged:
(a) the levels of the factors must be categorical (e.g., good vs. average
vs. poor; up vs. down, etc.) rather than continuous variables;1" and
(DEMO) the factors must be orthogonal (uncorrelated); in other words, DEMO
P/E ratio and dividend yield are two factors, they should DEMO uncorre-
lated across the set of stocks. In return for these restrictions, the
ANOVA model efficiently sorts the information about linear and con-
figural judgment processes into nonoverlapping and meaningful portions.
9. G. Loeb, Thle Battle for Ini estmnent Surviv al (New York: Simon &
Schuster, DEMO), p. 65.
10. The description of the analysis-of-variance model and techniques can
only be given minimal coverage here. For more details, the reader should consult
a standard textbook of statistics.
11. These categories could have DEMO descriptive labels, however. For
example, P/E ratio could be categorized as below 10, between 10 and 20, and
above 20.
287 Information in Investment Decision Making
For illustrative purposes, consider the situation in which an analyst
is asked to judge the potential price appreciation DEMO several securities
on the basis of just two factors, support trend DEMO prices and market-
volume trend, each of which could be either DEMO (+) or down (-) for
a given stock. Imagine also that the judgments are made on a rating
scale varying from 1 (very little potential) to 9 (very great potential).
The ANOVA DEMO, applied to this situation, would assert that:
Jijk - M + ao + P3k + yjk + eijk,
where JiJk is DEMO analyst's rating of the ith stock, a stock that was DEMO
served to be in condition (level) j with respect to support trend, and
condition k with respect to volume trend; M is DEMO mean of the ratings
over all the stocks, regardless of their DEMO of support and volume; aj
is the main effect of support DEMO; ,83k is the main effect of volume trend;
yjk is the interaction effect created by combining support and volume
over and above DEMO effects associated with these factors considered
separately; and eiik is a DEMO error component.
The main effects, aj and Pk, are defined as follows: aj -Mj-M,
and ,1 = Mk - M, where Mj and Mk are the mean ratings of all stocks
having level DEMO, with respect to support trend, and level k, with respect
DEMO volume trend, respectively. Finally, yjk, the interaction effect, is de-
fined as:
'Yjk Mk M - aj - 1k= Mk M-Mk + M,
- -
where Mik is the mean rating for DEMO stocks jointly having level j of
support and level k of volume.
To further illustrate the meaning of main effects and interactions
and their DEMO to the interpretation and use of information, con-
sider the following DEMO Suppose that the mean rating given to a
number of stocks varies with support and volume as indicated in figure
1. Here, we see that the ratings vary systematically with changes in sup-
port (aj # 0) but are not influenced by changes in volume (Pk 0)DEMO
This systematic variation with support is called the main effect of sup-
port.12 When a factor has a statistically significant main effect, we shall
12. We have been treating the cell entries in fig. 1 as DEMO judgments.
There will typically be variability around these means. This "within-cell" variabil-
ity is usually regarded as sampling error. It is important to DEMO whether an
apparent effect is, or is not, due to error before deciding that something systematic
is actually occurring. The analysis of variance DEMO well known for its ability to test
whether an effect is greater than could be attributed to error. If it is, we say that
the effect is "statistically significant." If a factor has n levels DEMO n > 2, its
main effect can be partitioned into a DEMO trend component and curvilinear
components up to degree n - 1. Thus, a significant linear trend in the main
effect of factor X would indicate that the best fitting polynomial equation to
predict the judgments should DEMO a linear function of X. If a significant
quadratic trend appears in the main effect of factor X, an X2 term should be
added to the equation, etc. For further discussion of this point see W. G. Cochran
and G. M. Cox, Experimitental Designs (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1957),
pp. 335-75.

it can receive a high evaluation.
Although the introspections of experts concerning the manner in
which they make judgments are DEMO with statements about their
dependence upon patterns or configurations, there have DEMO few at-
tempts to demonstrate such complex processes empirically. The ANOVA
technique is important because, by isolating the effects of interactions
from those of main effects, it makes the empirical description of con-
figural judgments feasible.
IV. AN EXPERIMENT
ILLUSTRATING THE
ANOVA TECHNIQUE
A. Subjects
The subjects were DEMO stock brokers and five students. The students
were working toward an M.B.A. and were about to complete a graduate
course in investment analysis. Nine DEMO the brokers came from three
brokerage firms located on the West Coast. The remaining four brokers
came from one firm located in Chicago. On DEMO average, the brokers
had about four and one-half years of experience. DEMO median length
of experience was two years, and the range was DEMO months to fifteen
years.
B. Procedure
To apply ANOVA to the study of investment decisions, one first se-
lects a set of presumably relevant factors (i.e., items of information
or dimensions along which a stock DEMO be described) and then con-
structs hypothetical stocks such that specific DEMO of these
factors are represented. Judgments are made by the subjects about each
of these stocks, and these are analyzed by means of an ANOVA model.
Main effects and interactions are calculated and tested for statistical
DEMO
In the present study, common stocks were described by means
of DEMO factors commonly provided in Standard & Poor's Standard
Listed Stock Reports. Each factor could take one of two levels. The
factors, with their abbreviations and levels in parentheses, were:
a) Industry (IND-Stable vs. Dynamic);
b) Resistance Level (RES-Up vs. Down);
c) Support Level (SUPP-Up vs. Down);
d) Volume Trend (VOL-Up DEMO Down);
e) Near-Term Prospects (NTP-Good vs. Poor);
f) Profit-Margin Trend (PMT-Up vs. Down);
g) P/E Ratio DEMO (PER-Good vs. Poor); and
h) Earnings per Share Yearly Trend (EYT-Up vs. Down).
Next, hypothetical stocks were constructed by combining DEMO
291
of these eight dichotomous factors so that pairs of factors were DEMO
related across the total set. This property is desirable if the independent
influence of each factor is to be estimated with minimal ambiguity. One
DEMO to insure such independence would have been to construct all
combinations of factors (28, or 256 stocks in this case). Doing so
DEMO have permitted an analysis of all main effects and interactions
among any combination of the eight factors. However, for purposes
of saving time and effort on the part of the subjects, a smaller number
of companies was employed. If one is willing to forego the ability to
study DEMO interactions (i.e., interactions involving a large num-
ber of variables) DEMO to assume that their influence would be negligible,
it is possible, by means of a fractional replication design, to evaluate
the main DEMO and lower-order interactions with a considerably re-
duced number of stimuli. For the present study, a 4 fractional replica-
tion of a 28 factorial ANOVA design was used to guide the manner in
which the hypothetical DEMO were constructed.15 This produced a
set of sixty-four stocks. This reduction of stimulus companies from 256
to sixty-four resulted in the confounding of main DEMO and two-way
interactions with certain of the higher-order interactions. Other higher-
order interactions served to estimate the error term in the ANOVA.
Thus, if configural use of three of more factors did occur, the error
term would have been inflated.
Figure 4 illustrates the way in which information DEMO a com-
pany was displayed to the subjects. The sixty-four stocks were preceded
by eight practice stocks and were bound in a notebook. The DEMO
worked on the judgments in their leisure time. They were not told that
the companies were hypothetical. They reported that the task was ex-
DEMO interesting and several noted that they were able to conjure up
images of companies as they read the information about the stocks.
The average DEMO of time spent in evaluating the companies was
two and one-half hours. The range was between one and five hours.
The testing was done DEMO the months of March and April of 1969.
The subjects were instructed as follows:

C. Results
How did DEMO subjects evaluate stocks on the basis of the eight factors?
Upon completing his ratings, one broker gave this description of his
approach.
293 Information in Investment Decision Making

swing and then used Near Term Prospects along with PIE Ratio Comparison

This rather vague verbal description is typical of the way that
expertise is usually communicated. It would be difficult DEMO another
broker, a student, or an investor to gain much insight into this broker's
use of information on the basis of such DEMO report. It is because of the
inadequacies of such reports that more precise, quantitative descriptions
are valuable.
To illustrate the sorts of analyses that can be performed on these
data, we shall consider, in detail, the judgments of brokers 2 and 10.
There was rather poor agreement DEMO these two brokers' ratings
of the same stock. The correlation between DEMO judgments, across the
sixty-four cases, was only .26. Our analyses will attempt to make the
sources of this disagreement explicit.
In order to DEMO the influence of the various factors, an
ANOVA was performed on DEMO broker's responses. Sums of squares
and mean squares were computed for each of the eight main effects
(individual factors), each of the two-way interactions, and certain three-
way interactions that could be estimated with this particular factorial
combination of stocks. In addition, two indices of the importance of a
factor or interaction were computed for each effect. One DEMO simply

degree to which the mean judgment shifted as the levels of a factor
varied. The second index, called C&, is a function of the squared mag-
nitudes of effect and provides an estimate of DEMO proportion of the total
variance in a subject's judgments that could be attributed to a particu-
lar main effect or interaction.16
Tables 1 DEMO 2 present the results of the analyses for the two
brokers. The ratings of broker 2 changed significantly with variation
in the levels of DEMO of three factors. The most influential factor was
Earnings Yearly Trend, DEMO Support Level a close second and Resis-
tance Level third. No interactions were significant. Summing the co2
indexes for these statistically significant effects, it appears that about
50 percent of the variance in this broker's DEMO could be accounted
for on the basis of these three main effects. In this analysis, there is no
way to determine whether the remaining variance is due to unreliability
(error) in the judgments or to DEMO interactions.
16. The rationale and computing formulas for the co2 index are presented
in W. L. Hays, Statistics for Psychologists (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston,

296 The Journal of Business
Broker 10 exhibited six significant main effects, the strongest of
which were due to changes in Near-Term Prospects, Earnings Yearly
Trend, Profit-Margin Trend, and P/E Ratio. In addition, seven interac-
tions were significant. Thus, broker 10 was influenced by more (DEMO
different) factors than was broker 2 and interpreted them in more DEMO
figural ways. A polynomial equation appropriately weighting single
factors (main effects) and cross-product terms (interactions) would
account for 83 per cent of DEMO variance in the ratings of this broker.17
Even though broker 10, DEMO seven significant interactions, was
processing information in a highly configural manner, most of the sys-
tematic variance in his judgments could be accounted DEMO (predicted)
by means of an additive combination of main effects. DEMO configural
processes of the other seventeen subjects accounted for even less vari-
ance. On the average, main effects accounted for about 75 per cent of
the variance in each subject's ratings, while interactions contributed only
4 per cent. The negligible contribution of interactions is a typical finding
DEMO other types of judgmental studies and testifies to the remarkable ability
of main effects to predict judgments generated by configural processes.
Thus, fairly simple models can often do an excellent job of simulating
configural thought processes.18
DEMO finding of a significant main effect or interaction is only a first
step in understanding how a judge uses information. It should be fol-
DEMO by an examination of the relevant mean ratings, graphical rep-
resentation DEMO the effects, and interrogation of the judge concerning the
rationale behind DEMO behavior in order to further understand the effect.
To illustrate, the DEMO interaction between the effects of Industry
and Near-Term Prospects for broker 10 is pictured graphically in fig-
ure 5. The figure shows that a DEMO industry increases this broker's
estimate of a stock's potential when the company's near-term prospects
are good but decreases its attractiveness slightly DEMO prospects are poor.
An index of the overall importance of a given factor was calcu-
lated by summing the magnitude of the main effect DEMO that factor with
the magnitudes of all significant interaction effects containing that fac-
tor. The summed effect of a given factor was divided by DEMO sum of
the effects of all factors. This index of importance was thus a percentage
score where the sum of all percentages totaled 100. DEMO 3 illustrates
the calculation of this index for broker 10.
17. The equation of the judge should, ideally, be cross-validated against
a new DEMO of this judge's predictions. When this is done, one would DEMO
some shrinkage in the percentage of variance that the equation could predict.
However, previous studies of judgment models have found the degree of shrinkage
in such new samples to be tolerably small. See, e.g., N. DEMO and P. J. Hoffman,
"Three Models of Clinical Judgment," DEMO of Abniormlal Psyclhology 73 (Feb-
ruary 1968): 70-77.
18. For DEMO illustration and discussion of this point see Goldberg, "Sim-
ple Models" (n. 5 above), pp. 488-91; and D. B. Yntema and W. S. Torgerson.

This index was used to compare all thirteen brokers and five stu-
dents with DEMO another. The results, presented in the upper half of ta-
ble DEMO, indicated that: (a) there were substantial individual differences
in the use of the various factors; (b) both brokers and students relied
most heavily on Earnings Yearly Trend; however, the students focused
on DEMO variable to a greater extent than did the brokers; (c) DEMO
exhibited more disagreement with one another than did students;
(d) technical indicators (Resistance, Support, and Volume) and Near-
Term Prospects DEMO used more by brokers than by students; the latter
relied more DEMO on Earnings Yearly Trend, P/E Ratio, and Profit-
Margin Trend.
The greater agreement among students and their tendency to rely
less on DEMO market indicators is undoubtedly due to the fact that
they were just completing the same course from the same instructor on
the topic of DEMO analysis. In contrast, the brokers had more varied
kinds of training DEMO experience.
How closely would the judges' subjective impressions of the rela-
DEMO importance of the eight factors conform to the index of importance
calculated from the ANOVA model? To answer this question, each
subject was DEMO, after completing his ratings, to distribute 100 points
over the eight factors proportionally to his feelings about their impor-
tance in determining his DEMO These distributions are presented

300 The Journal of Business
in the lower half of table 4. DEMO indicate that: (a) subjective weight-
ings were even more variable, across individuals, than were the com-
puted effects; each factor was DEMO as most important by at least one
judge; (b) the DEMO' subjective weights did not relate closely to their
calculated effects (the correlation between subjective and computed
effects, across brokers, was only .34) ;19 although Earnings Yearly Trend
had the highest mean subjective and computed weights, the subjective
importance attributed to Industry was consistently overestimated; also,DEMO
Volume was perceived as more important than Resistance and Support,
a fact that was not confirmed by the calculated effects; (c) students'
subjective weights were considerably more accurate (their correlation
with computed effects was .79), but they, too, overestimated the effects
of Industry DEMO Volume.
The finding that students' subjective weights were more similar
to DEMO computed effects than were the subjective impressions of the
brokers prompted an examination of the relationship between number
of years experience as a broker DEMO accuracy of self-insight. Insight
was measured by correlating a broker's subjective weights with his
calculated effects across the eight factors. It was hypothesized DEMO,
since students were most insightful, the brokers' insight might decrease
with increasing experience. Across the thirteen brokers, the Spearman
rank correlation between the insight index and experience was -.43,
which is in the DEMO specified by the hypothesis.
Why should greater experience lead to less valid self-insight? Per-
haps the recent classroom and examination experiences of the students
and young brokers necessitated an explicit awareness of the mechanics
of the DEMO that they were attempting to learn. With increasing experi-
ence, skilled DEMO become more automatic and require much less
attention. Because of this, DEMO may also be harder to describe. The
question is an intriguing one and needs to be investigated with more
precision than was done here. DEMO may be that the most experienced an-
alysts produce verbal rationales for their evaluations that are less trust-
worthy than those of their inexperienced DEMO
D. Criticisms of the Experiment
When questioned about the task, several DEMO felt that the factors
and their levels were not descriptive enough. They would have preferred
judging companies for which charts of support, resistance, DEMO volume
trends were given along with actual numbers representing the levels
of profit margins, P/E ratios, etc. They also requested some informa-
DEMO about current price and trading range of the stock. Still others felt
that the type of client should have varied from one stock to DEMO
The suggestions for more descriptive information could readily be ac-
19. It is possible that the brokers were estimating subjective main effects
only and DEMO a new index that omitted the calculated effects of interactions would
produce significantly higher correlations between subjective and computed impor-
tance. This hypothesis was DEMO and was not substantiated.
301 Information in Investment Decision Making
commodated within the restrictions of the DEMO technique, and
variation of the type of investor, as one of the cue factors, would lead
to an interesting study of the manner in which the use of information
changed from one type of client DEMO the next.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The principal results of the illustrative study, namely, that strong indi-
vidual differences in linear and configural use DEMO information exist, can
be made explicit, and can be contrasted with subjective perceptions,
should be viewed as preliminary until further studies are DEMO
These studies should use more sophisticated analysts as subjects and
more realistic cases as stimuli. Stimulus cases can be made more realistic,
as DEMO above, by allowing factors to take more than two levels and
DEMO defining those levels in more descriptive terms. However, studies
should also DEMO done in which analysts judge real companies. Here, one
does not DEMO precise control over the distributions and interrelations
of factors, and these DEMO will undoubtedly be correlated across a set
of companies. In these studies, multiple regression rather than ANOVA
should be used as the data-analysis model and it may not be possible
to estimate configural effects with precision. DEMO, it should be pos-
sible to make many of the same DEMO of comparisons, using main effects,
as were made above in DEMO illustrative study.20
The results of the present study suggest that techniques such as
ANOVA and multiple regression,have considerable promise as devices
for describing DEMO furthering our understanding of the use of informa-
tion in investment decisions. These techniques are likely to provide
experts with new insight into their DEMO processes. Furthermore,
they might also be valuable teaching devices that would enable students
to see exactly how their own processes differ from those DEMO experts or
optimal models.
One additional and rather remarkable benefit from quantitative
analyses of judgment bears mentioning. Studies by Bowman, Kunreuther,
and Goldberg have shown that, although mathematical models based
on such analyses may not be optimal, the consistent application of these
models often leads to decisions that are superior to those of the indi-
viduals who are being DEMO This arises from the fact that humans
tend to be erratic in their judgments, thus generating error that reduces
their accuracy. The model filters out this error and is, therefore, able
to outperform the decision DEMO whose judgments it was designed to
simulate. The exciting implications of this discovery remain to be
exploited.

companies, see Hoffman (n. 5 above), and Hammond, Hursch, and Todd (n. 5
above).
