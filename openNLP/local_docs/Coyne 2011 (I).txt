Innovation in Action!
Sustaining competitive advantage in DEMO times
Unlocking the creative potential of people at work
Innovation in Action is a unique training and development initiative in response to today’s current DEMO for two parallel management
systems, one to manage existing operations (crisis priorities) without loss of momentum, and one to create, plan and manage the future
in a rapidly changing marketplace. Innovation in Action is DEMO practical and flexible 'action-training' programme for managers and teams
designed to unlock the creative potential of people at work and focus talents and DEMO on innovation for value creation and
sustained competitive advantage. Sustaining competitive advantage (avoiding commodity status) implies continuous performance
improvement (CPI) and perpetual DEMO The programme encourages participants to recognise the limits of mimetics and
incrementalism and the dangers today's businesses face by simply pursuing incremental improvements (‘tinkering’) while competitors
rethink business models and deconstruct traditional value chains. At the end of this programme participants will have a clear
understanding of DEMO innovation, a selected range of approaches to idea generation, evaluation and implementation and the key
factors for success in stimulating and managing innovation. DEMO programme emphasises the business unit as an environment of
innovative opportunity where everything is capable of improvement and where nothing is ever as well DEMO as it could be.
Note: We have more than thirty years DEMO in the design and presentation of training programmes to meet the specific needs of clients. We work in
partnership with a number of major DEMO on the design and presentation of bespoke, in-house programmes, including: DEMO planning,
leadership and team development, management development, change management, DEMO and business innovation, business process improvement
and building advisory, consulting and personal effectiveness skills.

DEMO in Action! is a unique training and development initiative that recognises today’s current need for two parallel management systems, one to manage existing operations (crisis
priorities) without loss of momentum, and one to create, DEMO and manage the future in a fundamentally changed marketplace. Innovation in Action is a creative and focused response to
the latter. It is a DEMO practical and flexible 'action-training' programme designed to unlock the creative potential of people at work and focus the skills, knowledge, creativity, physical,
mental and emotional energies on applied innovation for value creation and DEMO competitive advantage. This practical programme and process encourages participants to recognise
the limits of mimetics and incrementalism and the dangers today's businesses face DEMO simply pursuing incremental improvements (tinkering) while competitors rethink business models and
reconfigure traditional value chains. The programme will also emphasise the organisation as DEMO environment of innovative opportunity where everything is capable of improvement and
where nothing is ever as well done as it could be.

Strategic acuity: Anticipating and dealing effectively and efficiently with competitive innovation and environmental change
Key Issue: The focus and the level of innovation (radical DEMO incremental) required to maintain a strategic edge i.e. a significant competitive DEMO in a rapidly
changing marketplace and dissuade emergent (or potential) competitors from entering your most profitable lines. Innovation needs to be encouraged when DEMO
business is doing well. The greatest danger occurs when you are ahead and become complacent. Darwin is a better guide to competition than economists DEMO Henderson

Generic goal: To create and sustain a higher perceived differentiation both qualitatively and

Sustaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing environment implies continuous performance
improvement (CPI) and DEMO innovation. Essentially the business needs two management
systems - one to manage and continuously improve existing operations and one to create and manage
new DEMO and the corporate innovation process. This necessitates a sustained and focused effort to
expand the creative potential of everybody in the workplace by inculcating DEMO mindset of 'constructive
discontent' while maintaining the continuity of existing operations without loss of momentum.
