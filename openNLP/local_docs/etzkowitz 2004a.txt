The Entrepreneurial University and the Triple Helix as a Development
Paradigm1
Henry DEMO
Introduction
The creation of an entrepreneurial university involves a cultural transformation of
academia to play a more active role in society at several levels. DEMO fundamentally, it
involves faculty viewing their research and teaching activities in DEMO new light, seeing how
they can contribute to economic and social DEMO as well as to education of
students and advancement of knowledge. Moreover, the university itself becomes an
active leader and innovator in its region, taking the lead in organizing cooperative
innovation projects with other local actors. Such a university, infused with
entrepreneurial attitudes and capable of taking initiatives at all levels, among faculty,
students and administrators, is properly DEMO as an entrepreneurial university.
An entrepreneurial university is the generative principle in the development of a triple
helix of university-industry-government. It takes a pro-active DEMO in putting knowledge
to use and in broadening the input into the creation of academic knowledge. The
university plays a key role in the DEMO of relationships among government and
industry, transforming the traditional dual bases DEMO science and technology policy into a
triadic interaction. . The enhanced role of the university in knowledge-based economic
development can especially be seen at DEMO regional level where it is active in several
ways: providing “the DEMO space,” the resources for incubation of technology-based
firms; “the consensus DEMO,” providing leadership in creating collaborations with
government and industry; and DEMO innovation space,” creation of new organizational
formats.

The entrepreneurial university is an emergent phenomenon that is a result of DEMO working
out of an “inner logic” of academic development that previously expanded the academic
enterprise from a focus on teaching to research. Paradoxically, the ability to generate new
ideas is rooted in the original purpose of DEMO university, the conservation and
dissemination of knowledge. Some of these changes DEMO internal developments within the
academy such as the development of the research group that has firm-like qualities. Thus,
the Research University shares homologous DEMO with a start-up firm even before it
directly engages in entrepreneurial activities. This paper focuses on how the university
has expanded its core functions DEMO teaching and research to economic and social
development, thereby taking a DEMO role in the dynamics of innovation, as part of a triple
DEMO of university-industry-government relations.
Innovation in Innovation
A triple helix regime typically begins as university, industry and government enter into a
reciprocal relationship with each other in which each attempts to enhance the
performance of the other. DEMO such initiatives take place at the regional level where gaps
in industrial clusters, problems in technology transfer and lack of governmental capacity
have hindered development. As a result government may agree to simplify regulatory
processes for DEMO formation; universities may undertake to train more students in an area
DEMO to the local economy; firms may negotiate new supplier relationships with DEMO
other as an incipient cluster.
At this initial level of the triple helix, the three strands typically begin to interact in order
to improve the local economy by enhancing the performance of existing industry.
The triple DEMO changes its spin as production of new knowledge and technology
becomes more important. Enhancement of the performance of the university and other
knowledge producing DEMO becomes the key issue as part of a strategy to renew an
older economy or create new economic activity on the basis of intellectual DEMO in one
form or another, ranging from formal R&D in DEMO, university and industrial
laboratories to tacit knowledge emanating from existing industries.
DEMO
Innovation is thus transformed from a relatively simple set of linear and DEMO linear
processes within industry, extending from research to the market and DEMO versa, to a non-
linear process. Beyond the development of new DEMO, innovation is the creation of
new configurations among the institutional spheres. DEMO Industry-Government
interactions are increasingly the basis of economic and social development strategy in
both advanced industrial and developing societies. The transition to a “Triple DEMO,
characterized by inter-dependence among relatively autonomous institutional spheres,
takes place from divergent starting points of “statist” and “laissez-faire” regimes
(Etzkowitz, 2005)DEMO
In some countries, there is a movement away from an assumption DEMO there is single
starting point of research and an end point of the economy: an autonomous linear model
based on laissez-faire assumptions in which innovation takes its own course. In other
countries in transition from a DEMO planning to a market economy, a role for
government was temporarily DEMO It is increasingly recognized that government plays an
important, if sometimes DEMO, role in innovation in market economies and that
government programs have DEMO important role to play, not only from the national level –
DEMO down—but also from the local level—bottom-up, in a movement from a DEMO off”
linear to an “assisted linear” model of innovation.
The triple helix is an analytical and normative concept derived from the changing role of
DEMO in different societies in relation to academia and industry. Interaction among
university-industry-government, as relatively independent, yet inter-dependent,
institutional spheres is the key DEMO improving the conditions for innovation in a
knowledge-based society. A triple helix coordinated entirely by the state only provides a
limited source of ideas DEMO initiatives. Under these circumstances government may take
initiatives without consulting others; DEMO it may subsume the other institutional
spheres and direct their activities. Although large projects may be accomplished it is not
4
the most productive form of triple helix relationships since ideas are coming DEMO one
source, the central government.
Conversely, if the state is absent from the innovation picture: coordination, regulation and
funding necessary to encourage DEMO may be insufficient. There is no single
answer to finding an appropriate balance between intervention and non-intervention.
However, the previous history of the role of the state in society will set some bounds and
alse determine DEMO it is most useful for the state to intervene directly or indirectly,
acting through other institutional spheres. In statist societies direct intervention is
DEMO while, under laissez-faire conditions, only indirect approaches may be possible
The triple helix model
The triple helix model comprises three basic elements (1) a more prominent role for the
university in innovation, on a DEMO with industry and government in a knowledge –based
society; (2) DEMO movement toward collaborative relationships among the three major
institutional spheres in which innovation policy is increasingly an outcome of interaction
rather than a prescription DEMO government; (3) in addition to fulfilling their traditional
functions, each institutional sphere also “takes the role of the other” operating on a DEMO axis
of their new role as well as an x axis of their traditional function. Institutions taking non-
traditional roles are viewed as a DEMO potential source of innovation in innovation.
Initially, industry operates in the DEMO Helix as the locus of production; government as
the source of DEMO relations that guarantee stable interactions and exchange; the
university as a DEMO of new knowledge and technology, the generative principle of
knowledge-based economies. DEMO increased importance of knowledge and the role of the
university in incubation of technology-based firms has given it a more prominent place in
the DEMO firmament. The entrepreneurial university takes a pro-active stance in
putting knowledge to use and in broadening the input into the creation of academic
knowledge. DEMO it operates according to an interactive rather than a linear model of
innovation. As firms raise their technological level, they move closer to an academic
model, engaging in higher levels of training and in sharing of knowledge. Government
5
acts as a public entrepreneur and venture capitalist in addition to its DEMO regulatory
role in setting the rules of the game.
Universities, heretofore DEMO seen as a source of human resources and knowledge,
are now looked to for technology as well. Many universities have developed the internal
DEMO capabilities to formally transfer technologies rather than relying solely on
informal ties. Universities are also extending their teaching capabilities from educating
individuals to shaping DEMO in entrepreneurial education and incubation
programs. Rather than only serving as a source of new ideas for existing firms
universities are combining their research DEMO teaching capabilities in new formats to
become a source of new firm formation, especially in advanced areas of science and
technology.
Enterprises are constructed out of elements from all the relevant institutional spheres, not
merely from industry itself. Universities increasingly become the source of regional
economic development and DEMO institutions are re-oriented or founded for this
purpose. New organizational mechanisms, DEMO as incubators, science parks, and
networks among them become a source of economic activity, community formation, and
international exchange. New modes of DEMO knowledge production, involving
Triple Helix partners, inspire research collaboration and firm-formation projects.
The interaction between linear and reverse linear dynamics results in the DEMO of an
interactive model of innovation. Globalization becomes decentralized and takes place
through regional networks among universities as well as through multi-national
corporations and DEMO organizations. As universities develop links, they can
combine discrete pieces of DEMO property and jointly exploit them. These new
configurations become the basis of a continuous process of firm-formation,
diversification, and collaborations among competitors.
In current international competitive circumstances, innovation is too important to be left
to the individual firm, or even a group of firms, the individual DEMO or even a cross-
6
national collaboration of researchers. Innovation has expanded from an internal process
within DEMO even among firms to an activity that involves institutions not traditionally
thought of as having a direct role in innovation such as universities.

Academic Revolutions: The Transformation of the University
The university, DEMO as a medieval institution for the conservation and transmission
of knowledge (DEMO, 1896) , has twice been radically transformed. The discovery of
new knowledge became an academic goal during the late nineteenth century---the so-
called 'academic revolution' (Jencks and Riesman, 1968). The translation of knowledge
into economic activity has recently emerged as a recognized university function,
DEMO research and teaching---the second academic revolution.
In recent decades a broad range of universities, both private and public, have established
one or more DEMO the following mechanisms for academic-industrial relations: offices to
manage patenting and DEMO of technology, interdisciplinary research centers with
industrial participation, research parks and incubator facilities. In addition, many schools
have established procedures to manage potential conflicts of interest and commitment as
faculty members play dual roles on DEMO sides of the academic and industrial divides.
7
The first academic revolution created the necessary conditions for the second: a research
tradition and an organizational model for research teams. The sufficient conditions DEMO the
second revolution have appeared as traditional academic entrepreneurialism, attracting
research DEMO from external sources has been insufficient to support the academic
research enterprise. On the one hand, the competition for research funds has intensified as
more academic institutions attempt to become research universities. On the other,
DEMO fields such as molecular biology produced technological and commercial
possibilities even as technologies such as computers became academic fields and
disciplines, as well.
Moreover, as companies sought external sources of R&D in response to increased
international competition, universities became more salient to industry as R&D
providers. Even though industry provides a relatively small proportion of academic
research funds, it is significant because it represents an area of growth and its DEMO is
now the prerequisite for attracting many kinds of government funds, DEMO in support of
technological innovation and local economic development.
What is new in the present situation is that many academic scientists no longer believe DEMO
the necessity of an isolated 'ivory tower' to the working out of the logic of scientific
discovery. Heretofore, in the hiatus between scientific discovery and application, industry
was expected to have its scientists and engineers pursue applied research and product
development. The model of separate spheres and DEMO transfer across strongly
defined boundaries is still commonplace. However, academic scientists DEMO often eager
and willing to marry the two activities, nominally carrying DEMO one in their academic
laboratory and the other in a firm to which they maintain a close relationship.
Thus, technology transfer is a two-way flow from university to industry and vice
versa, with different degrees and forms of academic involvement: (1) the product
originates in the university but its development is undertaken by an existing firm; (2) the
commercial product originates outside of the university, with academic knowledge
utilized to improve the product, or (3) the university is the source of the commercial
8
product and the academic inventor becomes directly involved in its commercialisation
through DEMO of a new company.
Transition to the Entrepreneurial University
The emergence of the university as an entrepreneur is part of a broader academic
evolution DEMO an individualistic to an organizational focus. This shift is most obvious in
research, especially in the sciences where the basic unit is becoming a research group
consisting of a professor, assisted by graduate students, post DEMO fellows and
technicians. Interaction and collaboration takes place laterally as well as vertically, with
some supervisory and mentoring responsibilities devolved to post-doctoral fellows and
senior technicians. This academic “quasi-firm” contrasts to professor-student dyads, still
commonplace in humanistic disciplines.
There is a similar transformation in the mission of economic DEMO social development.
There the transition is from being merely a facilitator for transferring technology to
individual firms to being a force for fostering regional DEMO and social development.
Instead of a focus on an individual patent or transfer of a particular technology, there is
an enhanced concern with the university playing a broader role in its region. Sometimes,
as in DEMO, where regional political entities are weak, the university plays a role of
“regional innovation organizer,” (RIO) bringing together local businesses and
DEMO to jointly develop an innovation strategy.
The shift from an individual to broader focus is more difficult to discern in education
since it typically DEMO place in non-traditional academic contexts, such as incubator
facilities and entrepreneurship DEMO Nevertheless, just as the university trains
individual students and sends them DEMO into the world, it is now doing the same for start-
DEMO firms and other organizations.
The appearance of economic development phenomenon within the teaching mission of
the university occurs in parallel to its appearance within DEMO research mission. Research
inevitably produces new knowledge that is potentially commercializable, DEMO
9
appropriate circumstances. Similarly, teaching also leads to the discovery of new
knowledge. This process can even be seen in the attempt to retrieve lost DEMO For
example, in the Renaissance project to revive Graeco/Roman learning, new
interpretations of old texts inevitably occurred, influenced by changed circumstances and
interests.
Tensions between Academic Missions
When the first academic revolution took place DEMO the late 19th and early 20th century,
there were objections that research activities were improperly taking professors away
from their traditional roles as DEMO A similar controversy is occurring as economic
development is added to research and teaching as a legitimate function of the university.
Teaching will not DEMO from the university: it is too costly to do without and
DEMO to other academic objectives. Students are not only potential junior
researchers, DEMO also future alumni who make philanthropic donations and provide
political support for their alma maters.
Those few research universities in the 19th century that DEMO to do without
undergraduates soon thought better of it and brought back their undergraduate colleges.
In the early 21st century, even as universities become much more explicit agents of
economic development, as part of their nation’s and region’s industrial and science
policies, they will also retain their traditional functions of research and teaching. It is this
‘capitalization of knowledge’ that DEMO the heart of a new mission for the university, linking
universities DEMO users of knowledge more tightly and establishing the university as an
economic actor in its own right.
As each new mission is incorporated within DEMO university, it restructures how the
previous one is carried out. Thus, as research is becomes an academic mission; research
methods are taught to students, thus making it part of the educational mission.
Conversely, as DEMO perform research tasks as part of their education, new knowledge
is DEMO Thus research becomes incorporated in the teaching mission and teaching in
the research mission. A similar dynamic occurs as economic development is introduced
10
and is realized both through the research and teaching missions. Rather than DEMO seen
as separate functions, each mission becomes interrelated with the other, although not
without controversy and persisting tension. Nevertheless, the extension of each mission
through the other is one reason why the university as a DEMO organizational format has
an advantage over other more specialized organizational formats such as the research
institute or the firm.
Varieties of Entrepreneurial Universities
The DEMO from the teaching and research to the entrepreneurial university takes
place in distinctive ways depending upon previous academic traditions and circumstances
(Rothblatt and Wittrock, 1993). In Brazil, the entrepreneurial university model is in
introduced DEMO the teaching mission in the form of extension of entrepreneurial
training throughout the university. Academic entrepreneurship also takes place through
innovation in incubation, extending it from high tech to other endeavors that can be
enhanced by DEMO levels of organizational knowledge and training, and by embedding
incubation in DEMO laboratory, as well as through the development of research as a DEMO
organized activity.
In the US the academic entrepreneurial transition primarily occurs as an extension of the
research mission of the university that itself had DEMO origins as an entrepreneurial activity
in the 19th century, when support DEMO research was largely lacking with the notable
exception of agriculture. A substrate for firm formation exists in US universities in that
professors are already DEMO quasi-firms in the university through their research group
activities. There is an almost a natural progression in the US from quasi-firm to firm as
DEMO opportunities for advanced research open up in new fields and as venture
funds become available from private and public sources. I n other countries, and in many
US universities, entrepreneurial activities may be introduced through explicit initiatives
as well as through the transfer of an entrepreneurial academic culture.
DEMO
There is more than one base on which to build an entrepreneurial DEMO Research
funding based on academic entrepreneurship is only one foundation. An entrepreneurial
university can also be based on the teaching role of the university, by introducing
entrepreneurial training into the curriculum. In this model, which has been explicitly
developed in Sweden and Brazil, students are expected to play the entrepreneurial role in
taking research out of the university and making DEMO into firms, playing the role of
technical entrepreneurs.
The progression is DEMO since entrepereneurship can also be generated from the
teaching mission of the university, even in the absence of an entrepreneurial research
tradition. Whereas, DEMO the US academic entrepreneurship has largely proceeded from the
research mission of the university; in Europe and Brazil it has typically arisen from the
academic teaching mission. By taking account of different academic traditions and
developing DEMO appropriate to local circumstance, rather than assuming a common
model, it has proven possible to create entrepreneurial universities on strikingly different
academic bases.
DEMO and Reverse Linearity
The entrepreneurial academic model is part of a triple helix that includes extra-academic
as well as transformed academic elements. As the DEMO university develops out
of the ivory tower format, it retains its DEMO features even as if becomes part of a
broader context for knowledge based innovation. An entrepreneurial university affiliated
with a cluster is the new DEMO for knowledge-based economic development. To realize
this goal requires two transformations, DEMO in the university and the other in the firm.
Both involve the creation of organizational mechanisms to interface with other
organizations within and across DEMO spheres. For example, the technology
transfer office as a an internal DEMO mechanism within the university to identify the
subset of technology arising form the research stream that can be marketed outside the
university, to existing firms. Lacking a market the office may determine that there is a
DEMO
potential market that could be addressed by founding a new firm. The DEMO of an
Incubator facility is the next step in a forward linear model
A reverse linear model is based on identifying technological needs in DEMO or
government, utilizing the resources of the university to provide solutions. DEMO this model, a
service organization is created to identify and meet DEMO needs. This model is based on
organizing the human capital resident within the university. It provides a means of
capitalizing this human capital in DEMO to provide funds for developing academic
capacities. It provides a professional capacity to seek external work and organizes groups
of academics to provide the DEMO thus translating consulting activity from an
informal individual activity into an organized group activity.
In contrast to a technology transfer unit, one of the founders of an academic consulting
unit described how, “ we work the other way around looking for problems that can be
solved with human DEMO … One of the early jobs we had was a contract to develop the
website of a large supermarket chain.” The earnings from these DEMO provided the
means to support academic development of the computer science department at the
University of Recife, Brazil..
The change in scope and scale of consultation provides a mechanism, for academic
capital formation. Moreover, the DEMO organization is an arm of the academic unit
or department and thus returns profits to that unit. The alternative is for the organized
consulting DEMO to exist outside of the university as an independent business, supporting
DEMO only on an individual basis by hiring them for specific projects or paying them
retainers for exclusive availability to the firm. The internalization of DEMO management
and translational research capabilities as an overlay on traditional academic research
groups often takes place through the development or renovation of research centers.
DEMO Rise of Centers
The trend toward center formation originated in the experience of scientists and engineers
working on joint projects during World War II DEMO wished to continue the
13
interdisciplinary collaboration they had found so exciting in wartime research and apply
DEMO to new goals. Centers provide a flexible format to fill epistemological and
organizational voids in academic structures. They combine some of the lateral features DEMO
a strategic alliance among companies with the hierarchical characteristics of a traditional
European professorship. A strategic alliance is a temporary coalition of organizations for
DEMO specific project; a center is a succession of strategic alliances for DEMO longer term goal.
Centers are typically based on the research mission of the university although they
increasingly include responsibility for outreach and public understanding DEMO science .
Although individual investigator grants remain a sacred tenet of U.S. academic science a
shift in gears is underway in which funding arrives DEMO larger packages with additional
expectations based on economic, health and social DEMO As a flexible format for
conducting research, centers provide a means DEMO accommodate new goals while retaining
old ones. Similarly, external economic development DEMO seek to connect to the
academic process through the center format..
In an academic system based on departments and disciplines, centers foster
interdisciplinarity by coordinating researchers within and across intellectual and
administrative boundaries. Centers allow the DEMO and distinct knowledge of
individuals located in different departments to be brought together in a common
framework. They encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration and make available
DEMO equipment that one research group could not afford. Centers can also bring
together university researchers with those from industrial and governmental laboratories.
They allow DEMO issues of non-academic organizations to be addressed in an academic
format by scientists from each sector. In principle, centers are temporary bodies that may
close if funds run out, whereas departments are part of the general university budget.
Combinations of intellectual and practical impetuses drive the formation of DEMO One
is the intensified competition in fast-moving disciplinary fields. Despite strong
motivations for individual research, collaboration is often the better strategy. As one
scientist put it, “You can no longer be autonomous in your research because if you want
14
to keep up and know what is going on you have to DEMO collaborative and the center
structure facilitates and permits that." This situation DEMO several faculty to join in a
concentrated research focus at a center attached to a department. There is also the
realization that a practical DEMO theoretical problem can best be attacked by a group of
investigators drawn from several disciplines.
Centers also provide a neutral ground for company researchers DEMO collaborate. The work
done at the university is open, but the DEMO at the company laboratory can be
proprietary. Centers enable companies to access the intellectual life in a university in
"real time," eliminating the lag between research discovery and publication. A center
director noted that, “… if someone is very interested in rapid processing, then they will
work with this faculty member because that is the main topic of his DEMO research. So
they share an office and they work very close together so that person gets to know all the
facets and you are DEMO in touch with your company....It would be a means to
incorporate new technologies much sooner and much faster.” Companies involved in this
center wish DEMO gain a competitive advantage by cutting the usual time it takes to learn
about new research.
The growth of centers is making the university DEMO complex, with faculty performing
multiple roles in departments, centers, and DEMO organizations. Center directors
increasingly resemble a corporate chief executive officer (CEO), administering the center
and serving as a liaison to academe, industry, government, and the public. The center
format is extensively utilized by state and local governments in less research intensive
regions as a means to DEMO concentrations of research relevant to their present and
future economies.
The Enhancement of Clusters
A cluster classically referred to a network of low tech DEMO, in the shoe or clothing
industries in Italy connected by family DEMO friendship ties. A cluster may recognize an
existing groups of firms in a sector that interact with each other to create products that
individual DEMO each contribute a share. In its weak sense, a cluster is DEMO a new label
15
for a local sector that may not have much interaction among firms. DEMO, once the
cluster concept is introduced, it may provide the basis for discussion among firms as in
the “gypsum cluster” in Recife. This DEMO lead to the formulation of joint projects
resulting in the development of a true cluster, even one with a knowledge component
(Callegati, Grandi and Napier. 2005).
Prototypical clusters, such as the Italian industrial districts, have found that many of their
production activities have been outsourced, DEMO recent years. The benefits of proximity
have been outweighed by lower labour costs abroad and the enhanced ability to
coordinate utilizing IT rather than DEMO interactions. Thus, industrial clusters have
had to incorporate more knowledge-intensive modes DEMO order to survive. Although, the
cluster concept focuses on firms and DEMO relationships, it can be expanded to include
knowledge producing institutions such DEMO universities and research institutes. Thus, the
cluster becomes part of a DEMO helix, with university relations introduced to upgrade
technology.
Students as Knowledge DEMO Agents
Students often play a key role in university-industry relations as an aspect of their
training, especially through internships in firms. The University of Aveiro, a campus
oriented to science and engineering, was founded in DEMO to help revive a declining
northern region of Portugal. Most area firms in ceramics and wood pulp are small, having
fewer than fifty employees. The owner is typically the manager of the firm; the
production processes are low to mid-tech. Some workers have specialized technical skills
but these DEMO seldom employ a graduate engineer and, of course, have no R&D
department.
Although the emerging research capacities of the University of Aveiro DEMO not
immediately relevant to such firms a basis has been found for linkage through the
university's educational activities. Student internships that have been DEMO by
individual faculty members and departments, especially management science and
16
production engineering, has become a significant method of technology transfer. Initially
begun as informal arrangements between individual teachers and companies,
internships are increasingly DEMO encouraged by the university. The director of a new
liaison office, DEMO Forum, arranges meetings between a group of firms in an industrial
DEMO and teachers whose disciplines might be relevant.
Whether initiated from below by a faculty member or from above by a liaison office
seeking partners DEMO the university; the actual work of transferring knowledge and
connecting company DEMO to university capabilities is carried out by an
undergraduate student. Coursework in management and engineering departments
provides internship students with knowledge useful to firms DEMO as production
scheduling and procurement logistics. Introducing a software package to meet a firm’s
needs and training employees in its use has been found DEMO be the most useful first step
that can be taken in upgrading the capabilities of these companies.
Interaction with a professor often presents status DEMO at such firms; the entrepreneur
might feel the necessity to defer DEMO the academic. Ideas from a student can be accepted or
rejected without feeling that anything is at stake. The company’s relationship with the
teacher DEMO place through the student's continuing contact with their academic mentor.
A two-way flow of knowledge arises; suggestions often come from the professor,
transmitted through the student, to fine-tune a project. The firm's successes and failures
are reported back to the teacher; often entering into lectures as examples to enliven
course material, thus providing local relevance as well.
Academic expertise useful to firms is not only high tech or knowledge DEMO the research
frontier. It can be an application of existing knowledge to meet the needs of a company.
Such expertise could come from a DEMO firm or an independent extension center.
Funneling it through the educational process is a low cost, low key method that allows
schools, with DEMO without research capacities, to develop relations to industry as an
extension DEMO their educational mission.
17
The University’s Regional Role
The triple helix thesis at the regional level DEMO based upon a model of knowledge,
consensus and innovation “spaces” and the transition process from one space to another.
Phase 1 is the DEMO of “knowledge spaces” or concentrations of related R&D activities
in a local area that have been identified as a precursor to knowledge-based regional
DEMO development (Casas, 2000) Thus, New England’s comparative advantage was a
higher concentration of universities and colleges than other parts of the US. DEMO Mexico,
the decentralization of Research Institutes created new opportunities for knowledge-
based economic development.
Phase 2 is the creation of a “consensus space” DEMO venue that brings together persons from
different organizational backgrounds and perspectives, DEMO generate new strategies. The
concept is derived from the activities of the New England Council, representing
academic, business and political leaders during the DEMO depression. Based on several
instances of firm formation from research at MIT in the 1920’s, MIT President Karl
Compton convinced this organization, to DEMO long-held ideas and focus on creating
new firms from scientific research as a development strategy (Etzkowitz, 2002). Joint
Venture Silicon Valley (JVSV), through its open regional “brainstorming sessions,”
played a similar creative DEMO in Silicon Valley during the recession of the early 1990’si
The New York Academy of Science attempted this role in the New York metropolitan
DEMO during the mid 1999’s, drawing together representatives from different
institutional spheres DEMO a series of discussions. Another instances is the Swedish
“regional growth agreements,” arrived at after broad-based discussions among various
actors.
Phase 3 is DEMO creation of an “innovation space” a new organizational mechanism that
attempts to realize the goals articulated in the consensus space to fill gaps in DEMO regional
innovation environment. The new mechanism is typically a “hybrid organization,”
synthesizing elements from different institutional spheres. Thus, just after the Second
18
World War, a coalition of New England academic institutions and financial interests
invented the venture capital firm, drawing upon academic and business resources.
A summary of the phases of regional knowledge-based economic development can be
found DEMO the table below.

DEMO for innovation by concentrating
related R&D activities and other relevant
operations

institutional sectors (academic, public, DEMO)
Creation of an innovation space Attempts at realizing the goals articulated in the
previous phase; establishing and/or attracting
public and private venture capital (combination
of capital, technical knowledge and business
knowledge) is central
Redressing Regional Imbalances
The concentration of national research resources at a few DEMO is no longer
acceptable to other regions now that the role of academic research in creating new firms
and jobs has been widely recognized (Greyson, 2002). In the U.S major research
universities were primarily located on the east and west coasts, with a few mid-western
exceptions. In Sweden the Stockholm region was the major concentration, with additional
foci in Gothenburg and Lund. The research council system of distributing funds primarily
to DEMO existing concentrations of research has been supplemented by two additional levels
of research funding which have introduced regional criteria as one of the basis DEMO
distribution of funds. Research policy has been integrated with regional policy, DEMO
directly as in Sweden or indirectly as in the US.
19
At the regional level, in many countries, there may not be DEMO governmental actor available
to take the lead since there are no or only very weak regional governments. In Portugal,
for example, there is not a strong tradition of regional government. In this situation the
University DEMO Aveiro took the lead in bringing together companies and municipalities,
playing the role of Innovation organizer. In Silicon Valley during the recession in DEMO
early 90’s a company played the role of regional innovation organizer ( RIO), bringing
together area municipal governments, the universities and companies to meet for
brainstorming session to create new initiatives.
The Entrepreneurial University and DEMO
Regions have the possibility of making rapid progress by basing their development
strategies on the construction of niche knowledge sources, supported by the local political
economy. Political and social arrangements based upon principles of equity and
DEMO lay the groundwork for rapid development in a stable environment.
“Leapfrogging”, DEMO skip some stages of development, is thus possible as well as DEMO
up” strategies of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and inward technology
transfer.
The enhanced importance of science and technology to economic development is DEMO
recognized North/South; East/West. What is relatively new is the DEMO acceptance of a
corollary principle that it is important to have the capacity to generate science-based
innovation locally rather than relying on turn-key technology DEMO This principle has
significant implications for institutional arrangements, especially in developing DEMO
where industry has traditionally had limited R&D capacity. Nevertheless, firms DEMO
advanced industrial countries have also found it useful to broaden the scope of their
access to new ideas.
The university has twice expanded its DEMO, from its original task of preservation and
dissemination of knowledge, to research and production of new knowledge and more
recently to putting knowledge DEMO use in various ways. Thus, at each point of transition
and DEMO assumption of a new task has involved organizational and ideational change in
20
the concept of the university Nevertheless, despite incorporating new and seemingly
contradictory roles and functions, the university still maintains a common identity.
Why has the university “hung together” rather than splintered? The answer is that each of
these new roles have fed back into and enhanced the carrying DEMO of a previous function.
This explains why the university has held together as a common institution despite taking
on various tasks that are seemingly DEMO odds with each other. Centripetal forces have
outweighed centrifugal ones. The methodology of institutional transformation is a key
element of the triple helix framework. DEMO process of transformation occurs at two
levels, the invention of new DEMO arrangements and of ideas to justify them.
Either may precede the other but neither one is likely to be too far ahead of the DEMO
In addition to performing useful functions that can be justified in their own right, it has
also been possible to legitimate the new tasks as contributing to the carrying out of the
old. Indeed, the basis for each transition of the university is at least to some extent
DEMO from its previous mission. Each of these new missions begins to be developed
out of the previous one. The new mission continues to exist DEMO tension with the old;
nevertheless it is found that each mission informs the other and that it is both more
fruitful and cost-effective DEMO unite multiple functions in a single organization rather than
to conduct them separately.
The closeness or distance between academic types is strongly related to DEMO the previous
missions were carried out. Thus, research may be part DEMO the teaching process and
entrepreneurship part of research. Conversely, entrepreneurship may DEMO incorporated
within teaching as a subject matter. It is possible therefore to build an entrepreneurial
university on the base of either the teaching or DEMO mission. Since the basic format of
the university is a reproductive process that takes place through its teaching mission,
tying the generation of DEMO activity to the academic format can create a self
sustaining dynamic of economic and social development. In the entrepreneurial academic
model the university educates DEMO graduates organizations as well as individuals.

In addition to cultivating and encouraging entrepreneurial attitudes, specialized
organizational units such as technology transfer offices and incubator facilities are
established to assist potential DEMO and student entrepreneurs in transforming their
technology and business concepts into firms. The University itself becomes an
entrepreneur as it develops the capabilities to DEMO new firm formation, including
financing these firms and retaining part ownership DEMO a reward for its efforts. In the long
term, the entrepreneurial DEMO gains the ability to self-finance some of its activities
rather than being wholly dependent upon other institutional spheres.
