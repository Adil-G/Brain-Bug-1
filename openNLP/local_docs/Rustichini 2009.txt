Neuroeconomics: what have we found, and what should we
search for
Aldo Rustichini
Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld, crossing
boundaries between Economics, Psychology, and
Neuroscience. Its original program was to provide a test for a
large number of competitive DEMO of decision making. It has
in part realized this program, and DEMO review the main ﬁndings
here. But its results are also posing the need for a new
theoretical unifying framework. We outline a possible line DEMO

Introduction
Neuroeconomics [1,2] is the application of conceptual
DEMO and experimental techniques widely used in
Neuroscience to the study of economic behavior. This is
a young discipline, but has been very active in the last
decade. It is time to take some stock, see what has been
learned, and where we move on now. We focus in this
survey on the study of economic decision that a single
agent DEMO in isolation. Economic analysis views this as the
process in which an individual chooses between different
possible streams of consumption that occur in the DEMO,
when these streams are not certain but random.
For example, DEMO important economic choice is the selection
of a university degree: each DEMO associated future stream of
income and consumptions, all occurring at some DEMO, and
not necessarily certain, because they depend on our skill,
the labor market, the evolution of laws regulating the
profession and so on. A choice of a degree is really a choice
among different DEMO streams of uncertain rewards.
Decision Theory is the theory of individuals making such
decisions. Implicit in the classical view of Decision
Theory [3,4] DEMO several principles that we recall
brieﬂy.
a. Common currency: we make DEMO between objects
that are sometimes of very different nature. A central
idea of economic analysis is that when we make
decisions, we ﬁrst translate the rewards offered by each
option into a common currency, then compare the two
different quantities (utilities) and pick the option with
the DEMO utility.
b. Precise beliefs: the probability over events may be
given DEMO us (e.g. when we toss a dice), or we may DEMO
to formulate it ourselves (e.g. when we bet on the stock
DEMO): so we may be unsure about the probability of
different events. But we should always be able to
assign one, and our choices should reﬂect this well-
deﬁned probability, assigning less weight to the
rewards obtained in unlikely events.
c. Integration of outcomes: we evaluate uncertain out-
comes taking into account our ﬁnal wealth, obtained
by adding the current reward and the existing wealth.
Let us call a lottery any random DEMO that assigns
monetary prizes with some probability. If we are facing
the draw of two consecutive lotteries, one which is
almost certain to give a loss of nine dollars, and the
other almost certain to give a gain of ten, we might
console ourselves that this is almost surely a net gain of
one dollar, and we should choose this sequence of two
lotteries over nothing for sure. If we do this, we
integrate the outcomes keeping an eye on the ﬁnal
wealth position, and ignore the wins and losses along
the way.
d. Planning decomposition: When we plan for the future,
we evaluate the utility of DEMO stream of consumption as
the resultant of the aggregation of an immediate utility
next period and the prospective utility from the
consumption form the DEMO period on; this pro-
spective utility function is the same as DEMO current
utility function from the consumption form the ﬁrst
period on; DEMO prospective utility is the same as the
current utility. In an extremely simple version, this
model is reduced to simple sum of the utility in every
period, with a single discount factor [4].
e. Bygones are bygones: if we choose between lottery A
and B, select A, observe the outcome of both, and ﬁnd
that B had a larger outcome, we should typically
choose again A if asked to a second time, unless we
learned something we did not know, for example DEMO we
have no reason to change the probability we attach to
events. The second time over the choice is exactly the

Neuroeconomics Rustichini 673
same, and the reasons for making that choice the ﬁrst
time are still there: there is no regret, nor self-
congratulation.
Two-dimensional man
The classical view of the decision process reduces pre-
ferences that satisfy these principles to two parameters:
DEMO attitude to risk and our attitude to the tradeoff
between rewards in different points in time. ‘Parameter’
has to be taken in a more DEMO meaning than ‘real
number’: a utility function is a parameter. We DEMO now
state the last assumption of the classical model:
f. Independence: the two parameters are independent.
There is no correlation between attitude to risk and
impatience. There is no correlation between the two
parameters and DEMO fundamental features of an
individual, ﬁrst and foremost intelligence.
Several substantial DEMO of this classical model have
been suggested; extensions motivated at least DEMO much by
the acumen of the decision theorists than by the relentless
beating of the experimental evidence, as one can see from
the fact that the classical paradoxes — Allais’ [5], Ells-
berg’s [6], Strotz’s DEMO and commitment [7],
and Bell–Loomes–Sugden’s regret [8,9] — are all based
on thought experiments, anecdotal evidence, or introspec-
tion. Paradoxes are DEMO defying intuition provided
by a theory, and Allais’ paradox would not DEMO without
the independence axiom.
The thought experiment presented in Ellsberg [6] asks a
subject to choose among lotteries when the probability of
the events DEMO not precisely deﬁned. Subjects asked to
choose display a speciﬁc aversion to undeﬁned probabil-
ities, and their choices have a disturbing feature: there DEMO
no belief on the possible states of the world that can
explain the behavior of the subjects according to
expected utility theory; instead they behave as if a
malevolent nature chose a probability over events to
DEMO their utility. The modeling of ambiguity aver-
sion removed the assumption of a precise belief and
replaced the single belief with a set [10], or the cost of
nature to harm the decision maker [11].
Abandoning DEMO integration assumption is one of the main
innovations in Prospect Theory (DEMO [12]), a theory of
decision making based on three distinct assumptions.
First, individuals evaluate each prospect (which may
be taken here to DEMO the same as lottery) from a reference
point: they value changes in wealth and welfare, not ﬁnal
states. Second (loss aversion): DEMO this evaluation, gains
loom larger than losses; the loss of utility from monetary
loss of one dollar matters more than the gain of DEMO dollar.
Third (risk sensitivity): utility is evaluated according to
the DEMO that changes in subjective responses decline
with the size of the stimulus. If the reference point is zero
www.sciencedirect.com
then the value function is DEMO above zero (risk aver-
sion in gains) and convex below (DEMO loving in losses).
The recognition that future planning may produce incon-
sistencies came early [7]: an individual planning today and
free to reconsider his plan at later date may later prefer to
deviate from his DEMO, even if his original expectations of
future means and desires are DEMO When utility is time
separable, he will follow the plan if DEMO only if he discounts
the future with exponential discount. This time inconsis-
tency in planning does not require dual systems, or lack of
self-control, to occur: planning at successive points in time
aligns if and DEMO if the discounting is exponential. When
inconsistency occurs, a theory is DEMO to predict how the
individual will decide: a solution to the DEMO has been
provided [13,14]. A systematic study of regret was intro-
duced in economic analysis in the papers of Bell [8] and
Loomes DEMO Sugden [9].
The research program in Neuroeconomics began, and in
large DEMO still is, a systematic test of theories that
have been presented DEMO the past, the determination of the
neural structures underlying the choice DEMO, and a
reconstruction of the process itself. Our survey will ﬁrst
DEMO the main results that have been achieved in the
past, on DEMO basis of the brief summary we have just given;
it will then explore some recent developments and what
they may lead to.
What DEMO we learned
Existence of a common currency for economic evalu-
ations has found strong support, from both evidence
gathered in fMRI experiments [15] and single neuron
recording in monkeys.
The activity of individual neurons from the DEMO
Cortex (OFC) was recorded [16,17] while monkeys were
choosing among offers of juices of different types and
quantities. In the analysis of DEMO, ﬁrst the subjective
value (utility) for each monkey in each DEMO
session was estimated ﬁtting a sigmoid to the observed
choices. If for instance the monkey chose with equal
probability four units of juice A (say, water) and one unit
of juice B (unsweetened Kool-Aid), then the value of B
was estimated to be around four times DEMO value of A. The
utility of the two options presented in each trial was
computed, and correlated with neurons’ activity. Firing
rate of neurons in the OFC was correlated with the utility
of the options: neurons of the OFC code subjective value
of the goods. The ﬁring rate DEMO instead invariant with
respect to the side in which the option was presented, and
hence of the action chosen by the animal to select the
same good in different trials: value encoding is good-
based, DEMO of action based. The same experiment
shows that the ﬁring rate is also menu invariant [18]:
namely, independent of what other goods are presented
as the other option.

Neurobiology of behaviour

The method adopted in DEMO experiments [16,18] is an
example of the psychometric–neurometric method [19],
which has wide generality. In sensory perception, neural
activity codes a subjective response to a stimulus, not its
objective properties. For example, in DEMO perception of
weight, doubling a weight only increases by a smaller
DEMO of the sensory response by the subject. Research-
ers should then study the relationship between neural
(e.g. ﬁring rate [16]) and psychological measurements
(subjective value, for economic decisions), the latter
derived from the observation of behavior, choice in our
case.
Menu independence does not exclude the possibility that
coding of economic value depends on the general context
of DEMO choice. Tobler et al. [20] measured the activity of
dopamine neurons at the time of delivery of reward. At
the beginning of the trial DEMO cue signaled to the monkey the
size of a reward to be delivered with 50% probability after
a time interval. The size of the DEMO varied, with a ratio
of 10 between largest and smallest. However, the magni-
tude of the activation at reward was similar in all DEMO,
independently of the size of the reward: the neuron had
DEMO during to the time interval to the information
provided by the cue. Such adaptive coding fulﬁlls a basic
need: while the range of rewards is unlimited, the dis-
criminatory ability of the brain is ﬁnite, DEMO its effective-
ness is increased if it is allocated over the most likely
range of rewards, as in visual perception [21].
The other topics have been more controversial, and a
consensus is still far. The study of the neural system
underlying choice of rewards over time provides a DEMO
example. The hypothesis that separate neural systems,
limbic and prefrontal, DEMO immediate and delayed
rewards respectively is proposed and tested by McClure
et al. [22] . Subjects choose between an earlier reward R at
date DEMO and a later reward R0 at date d0 . Rewards are
monetary, but similar results hold for primary rewards
[23]; also d0 >d ,and R0 >R (higher payments later); d
may be zero (immediate payment) or strictly positive.
The initial hypothesis leads to the DEMO that choice
pairs where d ¼ 0 will be associated with higher acti-
vation in the limbic system, as compared to those where
d > 0; second, prefrontal activation should occur in both
types of DEMO; and, third, such activity should be
stronger when the delayed DEMO is selected. These
predictions are largely supported.
Analysis of the neural system underlying evaluation of
rewards in time according to the psychometric–neuro-
metric method DEMO Kable and Glimcher [19] to differ-
ent conclusions. First, the discounting DEMO each subject is
determined from choices: there are substantial individual
differences, but a hyperbolic discounting provides a good
ﬁt. If this subjective value, estimated for each individual,
is used as a regressor, then brain regions are determined
that have an activity proportional to the value, indepen-
dently of the discounting of the individual. These regions
are those identiﬁed DEMO coding immediate rewards [22]:
ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior
cingulated cortex. The activity in these regions is decreas-
ing in DEMO length of the delay of the offered payment,
independently of the discount rate. These results suggest
a unitary, instead of dual, system DEMO evaluation of inter-
temporal rewards. This conclusion does not exclude the
possibility of time inconsistency. In fact, since [19] the
estimated discounting is hyperbolic, decision will pro-
duce deviation from past plans, according to the DEMO
criterion. How these inconsistencies are managed is not
discussed.
Similar diversities arise in the conclusion of the analysis of
the neural basis of the DEMO arise in ambiguity [24] as
well as gains and losses [25,26,27,28–30]. A neural basis
of regret has been determined [31,32]: the key idea is
that regret involves counterfactual thinking, and OFC
codes speciﬁcally personal responsibility for the counter-
factual event.
Five-dimensional man
The classical DEMO,4] theory of human economic decision
making is a two-dimensional personality theory: attitudes
to risk and to intertemporal tradeoffs summarize the
essential features of an individual, and sufﬁce to provide
predictions on his future behavior and response to policy
changes. The limitations of this model had been proved
DEMO theoretical analysis and experimental testing, and
Neuroeconomics has contributed to this DEMO
There is however less agreement on what will replace
that model and what a complete theory of human decision
making should be. This theory DEMO probably not be a
correction or an extension of the classical theory. Consider
for example loss aversion. If deﬁned rigorously by
revealed preferences [33] DEMO aversion is characterized
by a property of the value function for monetary pay-
ments arbitrarily close to zero (because it is deﬁned by the
ratio between its left and right hand derivative at zero).
This DEMO to make the experimental test very difﬁcult.
The intuitive idea behind loss aversion is probably differ-
ent, and is usually understood as the expression of differ-
ent systems handling the response to rewards and
punishments. Similarly, the role of factors like intelli-
gence in decision making as well DEMO in social and strategic
behavior is beginning to be clear in experimental and
empirical research (see below) but does not ﬁnd room in
DEMO structure of classical theory.
A more general view is implicit in the analysis of indi-
vidual behavior as shaped by personality traits, and there
is now a wide consensus around their structure. Although
personality theory is DEMO theory of individual differences,
understanding what generates these differences means
understanding the process underlying decision. Even if

one is not interested in DEMO differences in attitude
to gains and losses, one will provide an DEMO of
how attitudes to gains and losses work. The neural basis of
personality traits is now being studied systematically, and
surveys of what we know are already available [34].
What do we know of personality traits DEMO economic
decision making? This time, experiments and empirical
work have been ahead of theory. First, personality traits
are very powerful in predicting economic outcomes.
Comparing [35] the effect of personality traits on three
important life DEMO (mortality, divorce and marital
stability, educational and occupational attainment) with
other predictors (Socio-Economic Status (SES) and IQ),
demonstrates that DEMO average effects of personality is
comparable or larger to the effects of SES and IQ. This
idea is now inspiring active research in economics: a
recent survey [36] reviews the implications for economic
research. Some of DEMO implications may be unexpected:
biological markers associated with personality traits may
affect proﬁtability and survival of traders in ﬁnancial
markets [37].
Among personality DEMO, cognitive skills, and intelligence
have a special status. Meta-analysis of past research [38]
shows that impatience in intertemporal choice tasks, or
Delayed Discounting (DD) correlates negatively with
cognitive ability. Recent studies suggest that the DEMO
lation extends beyond intertemporal choice to fundamen-
tal characteristics of economic preferences: independence
between risk attitude and time preferences is probably
false. Cognitive skills measured by intelligence (e.g. by
Raven’s matrices) and numeracy correlate negatively DEMO
impatience in a DD task, and positively with willingness
to take DEMO in a lottery choice task [39]. They also
correlate positively with cooperative behavior in a trust
game.
What produces such correlations? For intertemporal pre-
ferences, in Shamosh et al. [40] data on impatience (DD),
performance in the n-back recall working memory (WM)
task, intelligence (g), and fMRI analysis of correlation of
brain activation and WM DEMO gathered. WM and g
explain equally well DD, suggesting that the DEMO
relating WM to DD are the same as for g. Brain activity in
regions associated with performance in WM task (most
notably, anterior DEMO cortex) covary negatively with
impatience; WM-related activity also partially mediated
the effect of g) on DD. If one accepts the theory that
decisions in intertemporal problems recruit two distinct
neural systems [22] , then the DEMO of these cognitive skill
is to allow a better integration of the signals from these
two systems. Alternatively, rewards in the future are
harder to evaluate, hence subjects with reduced cognitive
skills are less likely to select them. But recent evidence
[39], showing that the correlation of cognitive ability and
discounting is similar for short-term and long-term dis-
www.sciencedirect.com
counting, seems to offer support for the alternative
theory. In addition the simultaneous DEMO of cog-
nitive skill and preferences in different domains show
that the effect of cognitive skills on preferences has still to
be understood. For DEMO, higher cognitive skills
reduce loss aversion, as well as the difference in risk
sensitivity in gain and loss domain.
The transition from a DEMO to a ﬁve-dimen-
sional view of human decision making requires a theory,
and its experimental testing. This might be a future
direction for DEMO

The paper provides an axiomatic foundation of ambiguity aversion, ﬁrst
introduced informally by Ellsberg [6], extending the expected utility
analysis to include behavior exhibited in the Ellsberg’s paradox. In the
representation of preferences, the single belief in expected utility is
replaced by a set of beliefs: when the decision maker contemplates
the value of an action, he assumes the pessimistic attitude that events will
occur under the worse possible scenario DEMO this set.

This classic paper introduces DEMO extension to the classical model [3]
of decision under uncertainty. First, DEMO choice process has two phases:
the ﬁrst (editing) performs a preliminary analysis of a prospect, and offers
a simpler representation. In this phase heuristics and biases occur. In the
second (evaluation) the value DEMO a prospect is estimated. Differently from
expected utility, the probability enters DEMO into the evaluation of
the prospect, and the value function has DEMO as the reference point,
exhibits loss aversion, and decreasing response DEMO size of the stimulus.
We focus on the latter set of innovations in this paper.

DEMO in the experiment choose in every trial between an immediate
payment of $20, or a later payment of amounts ranging from $20.25 to
$110, with delays from 6 hours to 180 days. In the notation of McClure
et al., [22], d ¼ 0 in every trial, so direct comparison between the two
experiments is difﬁcult. The best ﬁt in DEMO analysis of choices is provided
by the hyperbolic model, where the DEMO value of the amount x at
date D is VS ¼ x=ð1 þ kDÞ so the utility function of the monetary values is
assumed DEMO be linear (with this utility will face time inconsistency, even if the evaluation at eachuðxÞ¼ x). From Strotz’s result, a decision maker

DEMO main hypothesis and experimental design are described in the text.
Data are analyzed as follows. A b-regressor is equal to 1 on the decision
DEMO in trails where d ¼ 0, and equal to 1=2 when DEMO > 0; a d-regressor is
equal to 1 in all decision DEMO Both regressors are 0 in baseline
conditions. The authors then introduce the concept of ‘difﬁcult’ decisions
(those made in trials in which the percentage difference between the early
and late payment was less than 0:35 DEMO larger than 0:03), ‘under the
assumption that areas involved in decision making would be engaged to a
greater degree (and therefore exhibit greater activity) by more difﬁcult
decisions’. This idea identiﬁes regions that are active in all decisions, only
more so in the harder ones. So two possible explanations seem possible:
the d system is required to DEMO signals from two separate systems, or
rather a system solving better DEMO more difﬁcult problem, and not so much
as involved in self-control.

Subjects in the DEMO saw in each trial a lottery of two outcomes, a
gain (range from $10 to $40) and a loss (range from $5 DEMO $20), with
equal probability. They had to choose between the lottery and zero
payment for sure. Analysis of behavior was based on logistic DEMO,
using a piecewise linear function with slopes bloss and bgain . Analysis of
neural data focused on the decision event, using values of outcomes as
main regressors. Since gains and losses varied independently across the
DEMO of outcomes, a test of the separate effect of gains and DEMO is
possible. Main results: ﬁrst, there is no response to increasing losses of
the brain regions associated with fear, vigilance, and discomfort. DEMO,
a group of regions including striatum, ventro medial prefrontal cortex,DEMO
ventral anterior cingulate, and medial OFC showed increasing activity for
gains DEMO decreasing activity for losses. The piecewise linear function is a
standard concave utility function: the kink at the origin plays no role in the
analysis of the data, and could be replaced with a smooth pasting of the
two branches, so it is not clear why this is a test of loss aversion rather
than risk aversion.

The study compares choices and self-reported measures of emotional
responses, for both normal subjects and OFC patients, who observe
outcomes DEMO binary lotteries they have previously chosen. The key
comparison is between the partial and complete feedback treatment.
In partial feedback subjects observe only the DEMO of the lottery they
chose, so they can check whether the DEMO outcome is smaller than
the other, unobtained, outcome of the same lottery (inducing disappoint-
ment). Whether one or the other of these two outcomes obtains does not
involve their previous decision. In complete feedback DEMO can observe
the outcome of both lotteries, so they can check DEMO they could have
received had they made a different choice (regret)DEMO Normal subjects
respond to both disappointment and regret, and choose to DEMO
future regret. Instead, patients only respond to disappointment, and do
not anticipate negative consequences of their choices. OFC codes

An index of loss aversion DEMO measure how losses are more prominent
in the individual’s utility than gains, invariant to monotonic transforma-
tions of the utility function. The utility function is deﬁned on positive and
negative monetary prizes. One may deﬁne such DEMO as UðxÞ¼ uðxÞ for
positive x’s and UðxÞ¼ luðxÞ for negative ones, and interpret l as a
measure of loss aversion. But a simple redeﬁnition ofnegative x’s would then give an equivalent representation with lossuðxÞ¼ luðxÞ DEMO
aversion parameter equal to 1. In other words, even if the DEMO function
U is uniquely determined for negative values, the l and DEMO u factors
cannot be determined separately. To address this problem, the DEMO
deﬁne an index of loss aversion as the ratio of the right and left derivative
invariant with respect to monotonic transformations.of the utility at DEMO, namely: l ðlimx " 0u0 ðxÞÞ=ðlimx # 0u0 ðxÞÞ. This index is

A reevaluation of how well personality DEMO affect outcomes, after the
criticism of Walter Mischel’s 1968 book, in particular as compared to
effects of situations. The effects in the studies DEMO either standardized
regression coefﬁcients (in studies with continuous outcomes) or some
form of odd ratios (in studies with categorical outcomes). Personality
traits are aggregated into broad Big Five categories (Conscientiousness
(C), Positive DEMO/Extraversion (E), Neuroticism/Negative Emotion
(N), Hostility/Disagreebleness (DEMO)). Most of the effects are natural: for
example C and E have a positive effect on life span, and N and D a
negative one. The average effects in the correlation metric of personality
DEMO are low for mortality, higher for divorce and educational and
occupational DEMO

A meta-analysis of the relation between intelligence and delayed dis-
counting, including 24 studies. The most important inclusion criteria were:
intelligence had to be DEMO with a standard test or one readily
convertible into one (e.g. DEMO SAT test); the study had to report a size
effect, DEMO DD had to be measured by an explicit choice involving a
tradeoff between size and delay of the reward. A study was excluded if DEMO
and DD data were not for the same sample. Time preference measures
were either the number of delayed choices made, or parameter estimates
of discount factor. Mean age of subjects ranged from 4 years to 45.
DEMO: the weighted mean effect size, with ﬁxed effects, was
r DEMO:246; P<0:001 (with random effects r ¼0:246; DEMO<0:001); the
correlation is negative, and small to medium DEMO in Cohen’s classiﬁca-
tion. No moderator effect of hypothetical versus real rewards, or DD
measure, or type of intelligence was found. The effect DEMO was substan-
tially smaller (r ¼0: 12) in studies that DEMO chance payoff.
