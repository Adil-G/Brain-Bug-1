Abstract
This article critically reviews the literature pertaining to trust and DEMO, highlighting
the diversity and complexity of this construct. In addition, the interdependency of trust with
context, as well as its dual nature in relation to control and as a sanctioning mechanism, is
explored. Trust can be both a dispositional and a behavioural outcome; ‘genuine’ (personal) trust,
sanctions and control coexist and co-evolve within and across different contexts. DEMO influences
entrepreneurship, not always positively, but entrepreneurial behaviour also has an impact on
levels of personal and institutional trust. Future studies of trust DEMO entrepreneurship need to
acknowledge the bright and dark sides of trust, DEMO duality and the different contexts in which it
occurs. Ultimately, we DEMO to develop a far more critical analysis of the importance and role of
trust in the context of entrepreneurship.

Why do we need research on trust and entrepreneurship?
While walking at Lake Constance last summer I passed an DEMO farmhouse in front of which stood
a table full of apples, DEMO and jars of honey. A handwritten note set out the prices per item, a
basket contained some coins and even a small banknote, DEMO no one attended to the stall. I filled my
backpack with apples and a jar of honey and left the required cash amount. Reflecting DEMO this
while I sat down to review the literature on trust and entrepreneurship, I realised that I would not
have thought of taking apples and honey without paying. Neither did it ever cross my mind to DEMO
the money. ‘This is the correct way of doing things’: unsurprisingly, my behaviour was governed
by social norms as to what I perceived DEMO correct. I also felt obliged to pay because I wanted to
reciprocate the (assumed) trust that the farmer had extended towards me, a stranger. What made the

this is naive behaviour in any type of commercial exchange? DEMO such trust in occasional customers

norms DEMO values of our culture?
Dawes and Thaler (1988) report a similar example, where farmers from Ithaca in New York
State, USA DEMO fresh vegetables on unattended road stalls. The payment boxes were attached to the
stalls but had a slit to prevent cash from being readily DEMO – something I have never encoun-
tered so far during my walks in Germany. Does this indicate a higher-trust environment (Fukuyama,
1996) DEMO institutions support trust-based behaviour, or did the German farmer take a DEMO
lated risk’ (Williamson, 1993)? In other words; if I DEMO taken the apples and honey without paying
or even left with the cash basket, would the potential loss have represented a very small risk to the
farmer and thus, been acceptable? Williamson (1993) suggests DEMO commercial relationships
are never governed by personal trust but rather, are DEMO based upon calculated risk. So, was the
exchange here at all DEMO? These questions already hint at the intricacies and complexities in
relation DEMO trust and entrepreneurship, some of which will be discussed within this DEMO
Trust has been a well-researched topic in many academic disciplines (for DEMO overview of trust
research in different disciplines, see Bachmann and Zaheer, 2006), including management science
(e.g. Lewicki et al., 1998; Rousseau et al., 1998) and organizational theory (Lane and Bachmann,
1998; Saunders et al., 2010), the behavioural sciences and recently, neuro-economics (e.g. Zak,
2005), economics and political theory (Ostrom and DEMO, 2005), philosophy (Baier, 1986) and
sociology (Luhmann, 2000b; Sztompka, 1999). In recent years, entrepreneurship scholars have
shown a growing interest in the role of trust (Höhmann and Welter, 2005; Welter and Smallbone,
2006), which begs the question as to DEMO analyses of this construct are becoming increasingly
popular. Of course, trust DEMO seen to assist in lowering the transaction costs of commercial actions
and the risks inherent in entrepreneurship; however, there are also similarities between DEMO con-
cepts, which may explain the increasing focus upon trust in DEMO recent entrepreneurship literature.
When pursuing entrepreneurial activities and trusting, individuals deal DEMO the unknown;1 when
acting entrepreneurially, we do not know whether DEMO will achieve the intended results; and when
trusting, we do not know whether the persons in whom we trust will be worthy of DEMO
A search for the keyword ‘trust’ in major entrepreneurship journals found an impressive num-
ber of articles: 263 in Entrepreneurship & Regional Development, DEMO in Entrepreneurship
Theory & Practice, 249 in Journal of Business Venturing DEMO 224 in International Small Business
Journal. For example, related studies have DEMO trust as a crucial ingredient for starting and
growing a new business. This includes research on human resource flexibility (Zolin et al., 2011),
relations with business angels, venture capitalists (Maxwell and Lévesque, 2011; Strätling et al.,
2011) or banks (Howorth and Moro, DEMO), franchising (Davies et al., 2011) and buyer–supplier
relationships (Şengün and Nazli Wasti, 2009), or the role of trust for the internationalization of
small business (Fink and Kessler, 2010). Trust is DEMO assumed to play a significant role in family
firms. Related research has focused on the role of trust as a governance mechanism (Eddleston
et al., 2010) and as a strategic advantage for family firms (Fink, 2010; Steier, 2001). Moreover,
trust is seen as a means to decrease the costs and risks of business transactions in hostile DEMO turbu-
lent environments (Manolova et al., 2007; Puffer et al., 2010; Smallbone and Welter, 2001; Yan
and Manolova, 1998).
DEMO, the label ‘trust’ appears to have become something of a catch-all DEMO, afforded to
every entrepreneurial phenomenon that involves any form of non-contract-based DEMO

construct. It is unclear whether trust is considered to be DEMO means or the explanation, and the concept
is used to explain DEMO and varied aspects of entrepreneuring. For example, trust is seen as DEMO
quasi-automatic outcome of social capital, helping to foster regional new business DEMO
(Audretsch et al., 2011), but it is understood also to be an element of cognitive social capital (Lee
and Jones, 2008)DEMO Others see trust as a requirement for different enterprise-related processes such
as information and communication technology (ICT) adoption (Beckinsale et al., 2011) or knowl-
edge transfer (Lockett et al., 2008). Moreover, trust generally is seen as something benign and
helpful (Garguilo and Ertug, DEMO); however, recently the potentially negative effects of trust and
its DEMO sides have become more clearly acknowledged within the entrepreneurial context (e.g.
DEMO and Karri, 2006; Tonoyan et al., 2010; Zahra et al., 2006).
Against this background, this article critically examines the current DEMO and debates
around trust and entrepreneurship, arguing for a perspective which DEMO for the complexities
and manifold dimensions of enacted trust. The introduction suggests why reviewing the literature
on trust and entrepreneurship is of relevance. The DEMO sections will look into what trust is,
exploring its nature and discussing definitional issues, and exploring how trust interacts with
entrepreneurship. The next section focuses on themes in relation to trust and entrepreneurship
which have DEMO neglected so far, discussing the dark sides of trust, the trust/control duality and
how trust is built, destroyed and repaired. Finally, DEMO conclusion explores the contribution that
entrepreneurship research could make to the trust debate, as well as suggesting ideas for future
research.
What is trust? Exploring the nature of trust
Trust is an elusive concept, and DEMO single consensual definition is agreed. Generally, the literature
distinguishes between different DEMO or types of trust. Lewicki and Bunker (1996) emphasize
these differing forms of trust in relation to how it evolves, while Zucker (DEMO) makes a distinction
between institution-based, characteristic-based and process-based trust. Others define types of
trust by its source, differentiating between cognitive-based and affect-based trust (McAllister,
1995), contract, competence and goodwill trust (Sako, DEMO), or trust based on deterrence, calculus,
knowledge and identification (Lewicki and Bunker, 1996). Several authors identify forms of
personal, DEMO or institutional trust (Höhmann and Malieva, 2005) in connection to DEMO micro,
meso and macro levels where occurs (Humphrey and Schmitz, 1998).
Reciprocity, expectations or beliefs about the intentions and trustworthiness of others are the
common elements in most definitions of personal and collective DEMO (Lewicki and Brinsfield,
2011). Reciprocity signals to both trustor DEMO trustee that the trust they extend to each other will
be returned. In this regard, trust is based on a perception of the probability that other agents will
behave in a way that is expected and DEMO In the entrepreneurial context, a firm owner
expects a business partner DEMO act in their own interest, or at least to take such DEMO into account:
they cannot be sure about how such expectations might be met, but hope that they will not be
disappointed. Such expectations are based on interpretation of signals (or trust cues), and on a
willingness to be vulnerable to another party (Rousseau et al., DEMO). Trustworthiness helps,
because individuals can signal that they are worthy of trust thus, encouraging trustful behaviour
(Mayer et al., 1995). The key characteristics of trustworthy partners include personal characteris-
tics, past behaviour and emotions such as demonstrated honesty, loyalty, sympathy and empathy
(Nooteboom, 2002).
Additionally, trust stems from the characteristics of a community DEMO organisation (Table 1).

industries. Such collective trust arises from the recommendations of others within this group
(Williamson, 1993), on DEMO, which refers to knowledge held by individuals about a potential
partner DEMO terms of their behaviour in prior network relations, or on shared DEMO and codes of
conduct within groups and professions (Welter and Smallbone, 2006).
The trustor and trustee might assume that the business partner DEMO customer will not behave
in a way detrimental to their relationship, DEMO it there are no written or explicit rules to this
effect. However, business relationships are also governed by norms, values and codes of DEMO
duct inherent within a society (Welter and Smallbone, 2011): this refers to institutional trust
(also labelled ’system trust’) as a form DEMO general trust in the functioning of the overall politi-
cal, legal DEMO economic framework and its informal rules (Luhmann, 2000b; Williamson, 1993;
Zucker, 1986). Determinants of institutional trust are both endogenous and exogenous
(Hudson, 2006) where the former refers to institutional performance: DEMO higher the levels of
institutional trust generated, the better they perform. DEMO latter, exogenous factors, are related
to individual characteristics such as income and education, suggesting that ‘mistrust is par-
tially based on ignorance’ (DEMO, 2006: 59). Moreover, institutional trust is easily destroyed,
DEMO adverse experience ‘results in a generalized loss of trust across all institutions’ (Hudson,
2006: 59).
Table 1 illustrates forms of trust DEMO relation to the levels upon which it occurs, its object and
DEMO Trust is a multidimensional concept, with recursive links between different levels, forms
and sources. For example, personal and collective trust overlap in terms of trust objects and trust
sources; communities and organisations consist of people and relationships between people there-
fore, personal trust can foster collective trust; and competencies which foster personal trust at
micro level are reflected in reputation and recommendations which in turn influence collective
trust at the meso DEMO Collective and institutional trust has similar sources: conventions at the
meso DEMO, for example within a profession or industry, are informal; and DEMO rules, in
this case the culture of a profession or industry (Welter, 2005a). Institutional trust is both an object
and a source for collective as well as personal trust (Nooteboom, 2002: 8). However, although
there is agreement in the literature that institutional trust draws attention to the context in which
trust occurs, organizational scholars and economists disagree as to whether institutional trust is a
‘form of individual or DEMO action that is constitutively embedded in the institutional environ-

ment in which a relationship is placed’ (Bachmann and Inkpen, 2011: 284) or an outcome of func-
tioning institutions (Wang DEMO Gordon, 2011).
Nooteboom (2002) understands trust as a ‘four-plate DEMO where an individual trusts
someone or something conditionally – that is, DEMO upon on their respective situation. The
entrepreneur can trust a supplier to deliver good quality: in other words, the level of competency
is DEMO, but this does not require similar trust in the supplier’s benevolence DEMO goodwill. Trust
is also dynamic: it shifts over time, so personal trust may gain or lose importance during a com-
mercial exchange. Moreover, trust is bound by temporal, social, spatial and institutional contexts
(Welter, 2011); such issues will now be discussed further in the following sections.
How trust interacts with entrepreneurship
Evidence is now reviewed by exploring DEMO relationship between trust and entrepreneurship, in
order to analyse how personal DEMO institutional trust interact with entrepreneurship, thus influ-
encing its nature and DEMO Given the difficulties of distinguishing clearly between personal,
collective and institutional trust, collective trust will be subsumed under personal and institu-
tional trust. Personal trust is understood to emerge between two or more partners, and institu-
tional trust as that which refers to codified informal and formal DEMO within a culture (macro
level) or a community (macro and DEMO levels).
Overcoming liabilities: the role of personal trust
Much of DEMO discussion surrounding trust and entrepreneurship focuses on networks and social
capital, DEMO network relations are seen as a proxy for personal trust (Brunetto DEMO Farr-
Wharton, 2007). Trust is believed to support network relations (Anderson et al., 2007; Jack et al.,
2004; Kim and Aldrich, 2005), while network contacts play a role in recognising and constructing
opportunities (Jack and Anderson, 2002), fostering business creation (Johannisson, 1988),
mobilising complementary resources, obtaining advice and other forms of (emotional) assistance,
and establishing viable business relations (Greve, 1995)DEMO The importance of support from strong
ties has been demonstrated (e.g. DEMO and Greve, 2002) particularly with respect to enterprise
survival and success in the early stages of venture creation (e.g. Brüderl and Preisendörfer,
1998). Reflected in the commitment and assistance of family and close DEMO or ethnic com-
munities (Deakins et al., 2007), trust can be crucial in entrepreneurial success; strong ties tend
to bind individuals with similar or complementary interests into long-term and intense relation-
ships. Such ties DEMO to ‘economies of time’, adding to the capability of quickly capitalising
DEMO market opportunities (Uzzi, 1997). Moreover, during the early stages DEMO enterprise development,
strong ties can encourage entrepreneurial persistence (Davidsson and DEMO, 2003). For exam-
ple, Greve (1995) suggests that trust-based personal relationships enable entrepreneurs to gain
greater feedback on their business idea. DEMO, trust may be viewed as the lubricant without
which network activity DEMO not be possible, thereby representing one of the key properties of
DEMO capital (Anderson and Jack, 2002). Trust is also identified as important for addressing
liabilities of newness: Aldrich and Fiol (1994) found that successful new founders were more
likely to build networks of trust DEMO assist in signalling legitimacy. However, Newbert and
Tornikoski (2011) found DEMO relationally embedded ties of nascent entrepreneurs (i.e. ties that
rely on DEMO contact with each other), while potentially reducing the costs of resource accrual,
may instigate some loss of bargaining power. In order to DEMO these effects, they suggest a

strategic approach to relationship-building DEMO nascent entrepreneurs should focus on estab-
lishing ‘a strong sense of trust’ (Newbert and Tornikoski, 2011: 24).
It has been argued that for networking to be successful at any stage of business development
business DEMO must be trust-based to some extent, and that in business-related networks, over time,
calculative ties are supplemented by affect-based relations (Jack et al., 2008, 2010; Smith and
Lohrke, 2008). Moreover, Neergaard and Ulhøi (2006) illustrate that trust can be institutionalized
in networks DEMO if it is transferred from the personal to the organizational level. Any top-down
measures will ‘at best trigger an interest in new forms of DEMO, but at worst unintentionally
destroy existing relationships, and even companies’ (DEMO and Ulhøi, 2006: 535). Network
relations can vary in nature at different stages of business development: whereas strong ties are of
value when developing a business idea and starting a business, excessive reliance may become a
constraint as the business develops and needs access to non-redundant DEMO and resources. Such a
change is captured in the model of network evolution developed by Butler and Hansen (1991).
During the pre-start-up phase where nascent entrepreneurs identify business opportunities, they
rely mainly on strong network ties and contacts, while in the later stages the networks become
more business-oriented. This is not altogether surprising in some respects, since opportunities for
the latter type of networking tend to increase as the business develops. DEMO, personal trust
might decrease in importance over time and institutional trust DEMO more important, indicating
recursive interactions between both forms of trust.
Low- DEMO high-trust environments: the role of institutional trust
Institutional trust indirectly contributes DEMO entrepreneurship development and business growth.
Studies demonstrate that formal and informal institutions that promote or allow for institutional
trust can foster national economic growth DEMO socio-economic development (e.g. Knack and
Keefer, 1997; Lane, 1997; DEMO and Bjørnskov, 2011; Zak and Knack, 2001). Emphasizing the
DEMO between social, institutional and spatial contexts and their impact on trust, Fukuyama
(1996) introduced the notion of high-trust and low-trust environments: high-trust milieux are
characterised as ‘trust clusters’, where trust-based relationships of different kinds exist between a
large number of social actors (and vice versa), civil society abounds and individuals are likely to
socialise with strangers. High-trust DEMO are understood to carry high level of institutional
trust, and low-trust DEMO low levels of institutional trust. Both milieux are self-enforcing
cycles, with DEMO environments fostering market entry, enterprise growth and productive
entrepreneurship (and vice versa). Welter and Smallbone (2006) emphasize that although trust
needs DEMO be interpreted and viewed in its specific context, the notion of DEMO and low-trust
country contexts is too simplistic, suggesting instead that levels DEMO trust differ not only across
countries, but also within regions and DEMO (see also Ferrin and Gillespie, 2010).
Why is institutional trust lower in some contexts while it is higher in others? Humphrey and
Schmitz (1998) point to path dependencies and downward spirals of trust (Nooteboom, 2002)
arising from historical reasons, an erosion of moral DEMO under socialism, weak institutional
systems, non-functioning sanctions during economic volatility, DEMO behaviour during
one-off transactions and the use of reputation as a sanctioning mechanism when the basis for trust
is undermined. Under such circumstances, a trust culture is likely to take generations to emerge,
given the DEMO temporal dimension under which trust is established and normatively embed-
ded (DEMO, 2000). With regard to post-socialist economies, research has drawn attention to
cultural or historical path dependencies which might prevent the development of DEMO
trust, although the literature holds two contrasting, albeit simplifying, arguments. DEMO has been

suggested that ‘real socialism’ prevented trusting behaviours, explaining the lack of any form of
trust in post-socialist phases (e.g. Raiser, 1999)DEMO In contrast, others argue that the necessity to rely
on informal DEMO in socialist everyday life and the ideology of mutual solidarity have sup-
ported the development of personal trust between strangers (e.g. Rehn and Taalas, 2004). However,
this does refer to personal trust while the level of institutional trust might still be low or missing,
but DEMO personal and institutional trust coexist.
The co-existence of institutional and personal trust
Granovetter (1985) links personal and institutional trust, emphasising how the former is vital in
all market transactions when business partners are unwilling to DEMO on institutional arrange-
ments or cultural norms alone (in other words, where there is a low level of institutional trust).
For example, in contexts where the regulatory and legal framework does not attract a DEMO
level of institutional trust, entrepreneurs tend to draw on ties based DEMO personal trust, such as blat
or guanxi, as has been demonstrated in post-socialist and developing countries (e.g. Batjargal,
2003, 2006, 2010; Ledeneva, 1998, 2006; Leff, 1979; Manolova and Yan, 2002; Puffer et al.,
2010; Raiser et al., 2003; Smallbone DEMO Welter, 2009a, 2009b; Tan et al., 2009). Such behaviour
reflects both a path-dependent response in the form of a ‘habit’ from DEMO, where individu-
als had strong mutual ties with family and friends DEMO mistrusted public institutions (Raiser et al.,
2001), and a DEMO response to market imperfections. In the case of Russia, Voronkov and
DEMO identify a ‘master norm of double standards or hypocrisy’ (2004: 103) as a leg-
acy of the Soviet period, in explaining the DEMO of blat. Written laws regulated the official public
realm while unwritten codes dominated the unlawful, but tolerated, informal society which
evolved under socialism. DEMO codes were based on collective identities, and trustworthy
relations developed throughout DEMO life. When the process of transformation began, such
double standards collapsed, with a preference for ‘familiar’ codes to govern conduct. This
resulted in DEMO trust and networks of favours dominating entrepreneurship, while institu-
tional trust DEMO low or absent.
Over time, as entrepreneurship develops (and the institutional environment becomes stable),
impersonalised contracts slowly force out old practices (DEMO, 2003) yet, personal trust remains
where survival strategies and coping DEMO of individuals and petty traders or informal entre-
preneurship are concerned (DEMO and Zdravomyslova, 2004; Welter and Smallbone, 2009).
In a DEMO vein, Tan et al. (2009) illustrate how, over time, DEMO ties in China have been
replaced by institutional trust. This, in DEMO, reshapes entrepreneurial behaviour with adaptions to
the new rules of the DEMO market economy. From a historical perspective, Zucker (1986)
demonstrates how, in the US context, institutional trust gained increasing importance as societies
DEMO more differentiated and dispersed. This suggests that institutional and personal trust not
only coexist (Dietz, 2011) but also co-evolve, complementing or substituting DEMO each other – this
draws attention to the dual and dynamic nature of trust.
Reconsidering the complexity of trust
Lewicki et al. (1998, DEMO) criticise most empirical studies of trust for adopting a snapshot and
DEMO view, one-dimensional constructs and normative judgements along the lines of ‘trust DEMO
good; distrust, power and control are bad’, and affording limited DEMO to the dynamics of
trust. This section explores some of these shortcomings in relation to trust-related entrepreneur-
ship research.

Is trust always good? Exploring the dark sides of trust
As argued in the introduction there DEMO a danger that in analysing aspects of business behaviour, the
role DEMO trust might be exaggerated. To the extent that this occurs, there DEMO almost an ideological
assumption that trust is good: although the management DEMO has acknowledged its potentially
dark side (Lewicki et al., 1998; DEMO, 1997), relatively few entrepreneurship studies explic-
itly engage with this DEMO Those that do address this issue consider it to arise from the over-
embeddedness of institutions and relationships.
At a macro level, the dark sides of institutional deficiencies and distrust of business devel-
opment have been DEMO: for example, Tonoyan et al. (2010) analyse the determinants of
corruption in emerging and mature market economies in Western and Eastern Europe. DEMO
demonstrate that poor enforcement of formal institutions, as well as the DEMO of financial
and legal regulations in tandem with exclusive and strong network ties, breed corruption. Based
on the example of Vietnamese entrepreneurs, De DEMO et al. (2010) show that bribes foster entre-
preneurial performance when they increase trust between entrepreneurs and officials, enabling
the former to obtain favourable treatment. As a consequence, vicious circles develop where
entrepreneurs continue to rely on trusted and successful ‘avoidance’ behaviour, which in turn
might reinforce negative attitudes of governments towards entrepreneurship thus, impeding
institutional reforms and the development of institutional trust (Welter, 2005b).
In addition, the effects of spatial proximity upon trust and entrepreneurship are influential
(Welter, 2011)DEMO Spatial proximity supports face-to-face business contacts thus, fostering trust for-
mation, but also it can contribute to ‘over-embeddedness’ and entrenchment at the regional DEMO
(Grabher, 1993). Kaminska (2010) explores the impact of personal trust in the form of bonding
social capital in the Polish region DEMO Łodž, vividly illustrating that, albeit fostering local economic
development in the early 1990s, bonding social capital subsequently hampered cooperative
behaviour and impeded learning and unlearning within the region. Drawing on case material from
small and DEMO enterprise (SME) cooperation in East Germany, Thomas (2000) illus-
DEMO the consequences of such spatial over-embeddedness where strong ties dominate, and DEMO
privilege certain groups while effectively excluding others.
At the individual level, DEMO shows its dark sides in the form of relational inertia, blind DEMO
and over-trusting behaviour. In a low-trust context, personal trust helps entrepreneurs DEMO cope with
institutional deficiencies, as has been shown in the previous DEMO However, it also restricts
business development if entrepreneurs do not (dare to) go beyond a circle of trusted and known
business partners (DEMO Welter and Smallbone, 2011; Smallbone and Welter, 2009a), instead DEMO
ing on their old and trusted ties. Batjargal (2006) illustrates a more complex picture, showing that
in Russia such relational inertia fosters improved business performance for those entrepreneurs
who already have extensive and resource-rich networks. DEMO turbulent environments, it appears less
risky for entrepreneurs to maintain old DEMO as long as they continue to provide (access to)
resources. DEMO, this contributes to lock-in effects, which ultimately impede entrepreneurship
development at the macro level.
Several authors have analysed whether strong ties, in the form of trust between small business-
owners and advisers (e.g. Bennett and Robson, 2005; Bennett and Smith, 2004; Dyer and Ross,
DEMO), can result in ‘ties that blind’ (Kautonen et al., 2010). Kautonen et al. conclude that business
owners tend to disregard the DEMO performance of professional advisers in strong ties – that is,
trust-based personal relationships – although they do concede that further research is needed DEMO
longer-term effects on business performance. Zahra et al. (2006) draw attention to the downside
effects of trust in corporate entrepreneurship, including lock-ins, DEMO and the lack of

effective controls due to over-reliance on trust. They highlight the DEMO links between
relational trust, which requires personal relations to develop, and malfeasant behaviour, which
could result from too much relational trust (Granovetter, 1985). In this regard, Goel and Karri
(2006) argue that over-trust may be part of the overall risk that entrepreneurs assume in DEMO
venture creation, suggesting that entrepreneurial behaviour might affect trust on a DEMO level,
if over-trusting ‘by a population of entrepreneurs could make trusting others relatively uncondi-
tionally a cultural norm and isolate people who violate DEMO collective norm’ (Goel and Karri, 2006:
489). They also suggest that entrepreneurs deliberately over-trust to create resources, and that by
using effectual logic, entrepreneurs trivialize the risk inherent in (over)-trusting to DEMO non-
trivial benefits (Karri and Goel, 2008); however, Sarasvathy DEMO Dew (2008) refute the link to
effectual logic, emphasizing that DEMO neither predicts nor assumes trust. Thus, both ‘enormous trust
and enormous DEMO then may follow from personal relations’ (Granovetter, 1985: 62). DEMO
indicates the need for trust-related entrepreneurship research to acknowledge both the bright and
dark sides of trust, instead of over-optimistically assuming a generally positive role. Moreover, this
also hints at complex interactions between trust and other mechanisms, such as control, for coordi-
nating entrepreneurial relationships.
Trust is DEMO, control is better? The trust/control duality
Williamson (1993) challenges the tendency to idealise trust-based relationships when he states that
within business DEMO, it is not a case of personal trust but rather ‘calculated DEMO As such,
an entrepreneur calculates the costs and rewards of business partners acting in a non-trustworthy
way. This accords with March and Olsen’s DEMO that:
The core idea of trust is that it is not based on an expectation of its justification. When trust is justified by
DEMO of positive reciprocal consequences, it is simply another version of economic DEMO
(1989: 27)
Management research has demonstrated that a duality exists (e.g. Bachmann, 2001; Bijlsma-
Frankema and Costa, 2005; Das and Teng, 1998; Möllering, 2005; Sitkin and George, 2005),
DEMO that in relation to trust and distrust, the individuals involved are DEMO to ‘hold simul-
taneously different views of each other’ (Lewicki et DEMO, 1998: 442). Related studies focus mainly
on the interplay of contracts (as a measure for control) and trust. For example, for Dutch entre-
preneurial firms backed by venture capitalists, Strätling et al. (DEMO) found that entrepreneurs
valued some kind of monitoring, but also that trust in their venture capitalists decreased because
of a high level of DEMO contracts, demonstrating the fragile nature of trust-control relation-
ships. For business DEMO, Bennett and Robson (2004) compare the use of legal contracts
DEMO personal trust, showing that a higher reliance on trust alone is DEMO with lower levels
of client impact and satisfaction, while a combination DEMO trust and contracts fosters higher levels
of client impact and satisfaction in the advisory relationship. Şengün and Nazli Wasti (2009)
shed light on the relation between trust and different types of control mechanisms by analysing
DEMO relationships. They show that trust and social control are positively related, DEMO
that trust and output control are negatively related and substitutive. However, DEMO is not so much
social control but more institutional trust: namely, trust that is generated through ‘common val-
ues and mutual understanding’ (Şengün and Nazli Wasti, 2009: 44) that was analysed in their
research thus, indicating the dual nature not only of trust and control, DEMO also institutional and
personal trust.

In a duality DEMO, trust and control are less distinct than is typically assumed (Bijlsma-
Frankema and Costa, 2005). Möllering (2005) highlights the complex and recursive nature of the
trust phenomenon, where duality ‘entails that trust and control each assume the existence of the
other, refer to each other and create each other, but remain irreducible to each other’ (2005: 283).
Here, the concept of embedded agency is drawn upon: DEMO means that when forming expectations
about the behaviour of others, the DEMO takes the inseparable influences of structure and agency
into account. Consequently, DEMO duality of trust and control depends on the context in which it
occurs: it is visible at both the macro and micro levels and across forms of trust (Welter et al.,
2008). Therefore, DEMO suggest that it is not only the duality of trust and control (or distrust as an ante-
cedent for control), but also of institutional and personal trust that needs to be considered.
Consequently, trust and control as well as institutional and personal trust can simultaneously com-
plement DEMO substitute each other. Table 2 is an attempt to make sense of the complex interdepen-
dencies that exist between trust and control across different DEMO and levels of trust.
Institutional and personal trust is always accompanied by sanctions: in other words, by control
mechanisms. These include, for example, contractual provisions and legal enforcement at the
macro level, and regulations DEMO a profession, a loss of reputation for an entrepreneur at the
DEMO level (Welter and Smallbone, 2006). An economy and its actors can rely on sanctions when
‘exchange relationships are clearly delimited, the level of uncertainty is low, and enforcement is
easy’ (Humphrey and Schmitz, 1998: 37). Where a rule of law exists, institutional trust DEMO entre-
preneurs to take risks that are protected through institutional sanctions and guarantees. For exam-
ple, in high-trust contexts, the successful operation of DEMO legal and regulatory framework is based
partly on the trust that individuals have in the reliability of institutions, and in the application of
any sanctions or penalties that need to be imposed. In this regard, institutional trust can comple-
ment the institutional framework and support the enforcement of DEMO and regulations (Table 2).
On the one hand, institutional trust acts as quasi-control mechanism; and on the other, where

‘transactions that are viable in an institutional environment that provides DEMO safeguards may be
nonviable’ (Williamson, 1993: 476) – that is, in contexts where institutional control and legal
sanctions do not work (DEMO), levels of institutional trust may be low. In these circumstances,
personal trust is said to substitute for low level of institutional trust, lack of formal control and
deficiencies in the external business environment (Table 2).
The roles of trust and sanctions can be assumed to DEMO as entrepreneurs move from simple
transactions to more complex relationships, and DEMO the early stages of venture development
towards growing their businesses. It is suggested that it is never pure personal trust that triggers
and dominates DEMO relationships, neither, in stable business environments, is it only pure
DEMO trust, but also an element of control. There exists a dynamic DEMO fragile interplay
between institutional trust and legal sanctions, institutional and personal DEMO and between ‘gen-
uine’ personal trust and control mechanisms which draws attention to the multidimensionality of
trust and the question of how trust emerges.
DEMO trust is built, destroyed and repaired
How can cooperation occur if DEMO is no personal trust at the beginning? Numerous models exist
in DEMO management literature (e.g. Bachmann and Inkpen, 2011; Lewicki and Bunker, 1996;
Lewicki et al., 2006; McKnight et al., 1998; DEMO, 1986), but relatively few entrepreneurship
studies have concentrated explicitly on DEMO trust in entrepreneurship is built (e.g. Bergh et al.,
2011; Neergaard and Ulhøi, 2006; Nguyen and Rose, 2009; Smith and DEMO, 2008; Tillmar,
2006), sometimes examining trust-building as a quasi-automatic ‘side-effect’ in relation to social
capital formation or network development (e.g. Audretsch et al., 2011; Jack et al., 2008; Mackinnon
et al., 2004). This lack of focus on trust formation in entrepreneurship might DEMO due partly to the
fact that very few studies have undertaken the longitudinal work on trust required to adequately
capture its processual nature (Welter and Alex, 2011).
Nooteboom (2002) distinguishes three major stages of building trust: first, control in the
absence of trust; second, DEMO trustworthiness and developing tolerance levels of trust; and
third, widening these tolerance levels. These three stages may overlap and do not have to DEMO
sequentially. In the control stage, partners either proceed step-by-step, or install safeguards
based on their own interests because there is no genuine basis DEMO trust. The relationship is unfa-
miliar, and so the business partners DEMO to take some initial risk because only then ‘is it possible
for the trustee to demonstrate his or her trustworthiness’ (Das and Teng, DEMO: 503). In the second
phase, knowledge and experience allow partners to assess their trustworthiness: thus experiences
made during the relationship allow trust ‘to take root’ (Coriat and Guennif, 1998: 54). The link
between experience and trust is recursive: experience may precede trust-building, but DEMO also
could be the result of trust within a relationship: nonetheless, ‘in either case a trust-based rela-
tionship will only survive if it DEMO supported by experience’ (Coriat and Guennif, 1998: 54). In DEMO
stage, by setting tolerance levels for trust, entrepreneurs create some scope for trusting each
other without giving up the control option, as has been illustrated in the example of cross-border
entrepreneurship in Western and Eastern DEMO border regions (Welter et al., 2008). Tolerance
levels are widened in the third stage as a result of shared cognitive frames. It DEMO here that personal
trust may play a more important role, dominating DEMO some relationships but not others, depending
on the experiences of entrepreneurs, their familiarity with each other and the nature of their
business partnership.
DEMO Nooteboom (2002) emphasizes the role of control in initiating, building DEMO sustaining
trust, similar to Lewicki and Bunker (1996), Möllering argues that at the ‘heart of the concept of

204
International Small Business Journal 30(3)
trust is the suspension DEMO vulnerability and uncertainty (the leap of faith), which enables actors DEMO
have positive expectations of others’ (2006: 191). It is pointed out that trust is something which
can occur quasi-automatically, as every day ‘we trust countless others without being able or
required to perform any DEMO reasoning about whether or not this is justified’ (2006: 51).
Similarly, McKnight et al. (1998) point out that trust can exist without previous experiences with
the trustee, suggesting that individuals possess a disposition towards trust. How can the initial
leap of faith occur in entrepreneurship? Individuals often revert to stereotyping, allowing them to
cope with the unfamiliar, for example, when operating in an unknown country context. Luhmann
refers DEMO this process as ‘familiarity breeding unfamiliarity’ (2000a: 95), where symbols help to
introduce the unfamiliar because they produce shared, taken-for-granted knowledge (DEMO
and Inkpen, 2011). In this regard, institutions allow for behavioural routines which also foster the
emergence of trust.
However, Zaheer and Zaheer (2006) suggest that such stereotypes may result in trust asymme-
tries DEMO transferred to all potential business partners in another environment, regardless of DEMO
individual behaviour. This, again, draws attention to the interplay of personal and institutional trust
which cannot be easily separated when it comes to DEMO formation of trust. Here, Rothstein (2005)
points to ‘social traps’ which might prevent trust-building: these are evident in situations where
mutual distrust prevents cooperation, and it is argued that the existence of universal and impartial
political institutions, together with public policies which enhance social and economic equality,
create trust. This also implies that trust can be socially DEMO, emerging through individual
and collective sense-making and interpretation (Lewis, 2008; Möllering, 2006). For example, in
their study on the post-disaster DEMO of a parish within New Orleans, Chamlee-Wright and
Storr (2011) DEMO the link between collective narratives that show the parish as a close-knit
community, and the related and subsequent recovery strategies adopted.
These processes of trust formation are not mutually exclusive. Rather, trust may be built
through initial control, a ‘leap of faith’ or discursive processes, depending on DEMO objectives and
the extent of the risk involved that are likely to be associated with the nature and extent of the
cooperation and its DEMO to the partners. For example, Fink and Kessler (2010) argue DEMO
it is self-commitment – in other words, the ‘leap of faith’ DEMO which renders highly complex and
uncertain transaction relationships such as research and development (R&D) cooperation possi-
ble. Moreover, processes of trust-building have to be interpreted within the context in which they
occur, which draws attention back to the sources of trust. Trust-building may be facilitated in
DEMO which have a common history, some common rules or other shared DEMO
(Lorenzen, 1998). Sometimes actors are trusted simply because they belong to the same commu-
nity, which echoes the findings of the industrial district literature regarding the importance of
localised ‘unwritten’ rules of conduct (Dei Ottati, 2004). Under such circumstances, it is cultural,
sector DEMO geographical proximity that fosters the emergence of trust.
Furthermore, there is DEMO element of learning to the process of trust formation, where learning
DEMO trust may enhance or impede each other, although this relationship has DEMO little attention
so far in the entrepreneurship literature. For example, Bergh DEMO al. (2011) draw attention to the dif-
ferent learning outcomes that entrepreneurs can achieve through building trust and understanding
trust-building as antecedents to DEMO learning. While trust might be required for entre-
preneurial learning to occur, learning also can contribute to both personal trust and institutional
trust. Based on experiences, individuals learn to trust each other as they become familiar with each
other’s competencies, motivations and sense of fairness (Bowey and DEMO, 2007; Welter et al.,
2008), and over time they also learn to put trust in the institutional environment.

Trust is volatile and fragile – it is easily destroyed. DEMO, surprisingly little is known about
the exact mechanism of how trust DEMO (entrepreneurial) relationships is destroyed and repaired
(Kim et al., 2009; Kramer and Lewicki, 2010). Trust violations may occur at the DEMO level,
when a business partner (trustee) exploits a (partly) trust-based relationship and neglects to fulfil
expectations. However, sometimes the suspicion that a trust breach might happen is sufficient to
destroy it. Depending on DEMO degree of control within a relationship and the respective institu-
tional environment, the entrepreneur has different options: for example, claims can be enforced
by legal action, although this in turn could further erode any remaining trust in the business
partnership.
Can trust be repaired under such circumstances? One may assume that this depends on the
willingness of the party DEMO trust was violated; it may be that renewal of trust is DEMO more cal-
culative decision process compared to its initial emergence, although DEMO external environment,
the level of business development and entrepreneurial experiences may play a moderating role
in this regard. In any case, these questions require further research, thus suggesting interesting
avenues for future trust research in the entrepreneurship field.
Outlook: the future of trust-related entrepreneurship research
This article argues that trust is critical for entrepreneurship and has the potential to DEMO different
roles; it can reduce some risks inherent within entrepreneurial activities DEMO act as a governing
mechanism for various entrepreneurial relationships. Conceptually, the DEMO of trust is complex
and multidimensional, it occurs at the micro DEMO macro levels: in other words, between persons,
organisations and institutions. Trust also stems from emotions, experiences and characteristics as
well as from codified norms and rules; institutional and personal trust, as well as DEMO and control,
co-evolve and coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, sometimes complementing each
other. Trust emerges in different ways, for example through deliberate actions and calculations, a
‘leap of faith’ or as a result of collective and individual sense-making. This article also highlights
the influence of DEMO, spatial and institutional contexts on trust which are not always a DEMO
influence upon entrepreneurship. In addition, trust obviously influences entrepreneurship, but
entrepreneurial behaviour also has an impact upon levels of personal and institutional trust, as has
been illustrated in the case of post-socialist economies. In these DEMO, vicious behavioural
circles have contributed to reinforcing negative public attitudes towards DEMO and pre-
vented the institutional reforms required to foster institutional trust.
Furthermore, this article also identifies fundamental gaps in the extant literature, suggesting
DEMO avenues for future research. Generally, future studies on trust in entrepreneurship
DEMO commence from a more critical perspective, acknowledging the bright and dark DEMO of
trust, its duality in relation to control mechanisms, the interdependencies between forms of trust
and the different contexts in which it occurs. DEMO (2011) makes a case for more macro-
level trust research, DEMO that too little is known about how institutions influence and foster
(DEMO) trust, and that too many studies have focused on researching trust at the micro
level. I suggest reframing his call for the entrepreneurship DEMO We do not need more macro-
level trust studies as such, DEMO rather multi-level studies which analyse the duality of trust within
and across different contexts, in particular with a process perspective, and which explore DEMO
recursive links between trust and entrepreneurship. Some of the research questions related to this
could be as follows.

• The processes of DEMO formation, breaking and repairing in relation to the nature of
entrepreneurship DEMO what exactly triggers trust formation, breaking and repair in relation
to DEMO nature of different entrepreneurial activities? For example, does this differ for
informal and illegal entrepreneurship? Can we identify the social, spatial and DEMO
contexts and/or entrepreneurial behaviour, i.e. the conditions, under which trust is more
easily formed, destroyed or repaired?
• The contextual aspects of dark and bright sides of trust – do these differ, for example, across
cultures, or is ‘trust the same no matter the DEMO (Dietz, 2011: 219)?
• Trust formation in relation to trust duality and contexts – what are the conditions and con-
texts DEMO which personal trust evolves into institutional trust? How is trust shaped DEMO contexts
where institutions are weak and remain weak, where corruption is DEMO normal way of doing
business? Which contextual aspects influence the trust/DEMO duality and the interplay of
trust and control mechanisms?
• Entrepreneurship and trust in relation to institutional change – where is the ‘tipping DEMO
when vicious behavioural circles develop into virtuous circles? Recent work on DEMO
entrepreneurship (Pacheco et al., 2010) and institutional change agents (Welter and
Smallbone, 2011) might offer some useful perspectives for the general DEMO literature in this
regard.
All of these suggestions have implications for how trust is explored and analysed within the
entrepreneurship field, suggesting a need for more longitudinal work as well as comparative
studies on trusting entrepreneurial DEMO and processes across different contexts, in order to
recontextualise the concept DEMO trust (Anderson et al., 2010; Hjorth and Johannisson, 2003).
Ultimately, as this initial list of potential research questions illustrates, rather DEMO just stating
their existence and importance for entrepreneurial activities, greater insight DEMO the various
facets of trust, and their complex and recursive contextualised DEMO, is urgently required.
