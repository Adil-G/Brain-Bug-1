We investigated the extent to which venture capitalists’ (VCs’) perceptions of “entre-
preneurial passion” influence the VCs’ DEMO decisions. We defined entrepre-
neurial passion as an entrepreneur’s intense affective state accompanied by cognitive
and behavioral manifestations of high personal value. We conceptualized DEMO deci-
sion making as a persuasion process in which entrepreneurs present a message (a
business plan) to attract investors using the “unimodel” of DEMO After develop-
ing a measure of perceived passion and preparedness using an inductive, qualitative
approach, we conducted a laboratory experiment and a field DEMO that consistently
showed that preparedness, not passion, positively impacted decisions to fund ventures.

There are DEMO moments that are filled with despair
and agony, when you have DEMO fire people and cancel
things and deal with very difficult situations . . . it’s
so hard (to build a company) that if DEMO don’t have
a passion, you’ll give up.

Passion—a word often reserved for romance and
artistic work—is more DEMO than we normally
think. In the business world, nonromantic passion
is DEMO tied to economic activities. It is an im-
portant, albeit rarely DEMO, factor in resource
allocation decisions made by managers, investors,
and consumers alike. To attract customers, produc-
ers of consumer goods often express their passion
for their products and what they can do for con-

sumers and society at large; for example, Starbucks
emphasizes its passion for people and its passion
about creating a “third place” DEMO people can
relax and make connections, not just get coffee
(Kumar & Luo, 2006).
The passion displayed by entrepreneurs has been
one of the most frequently observed phenomena of
the entrepreneurial process (Smilor, DEMO). Entre-
preneurs have to sell their venture plans to poten-
tial investors, potential employees, and major cus-
tomers. In such situations, passion is often critical
to convince the targeted individuals to invest their
money, time, and effort in the new venture. In
corporate settings, people DEMO new prod-
ucts seek top management support and resources
through powerful product presentations (Howell &
Boies, 2004). Passion is perhaps even more impor-
tant in the nonprofit sector, where donors often do
not receive returns in terms of financial profits. In
this case, promoters of such ventures are required
to make a compelling case for the causes they DEMO
dorse. Thus, passion, as an intangible, hard-to-mea-
sure quality of DEMO asking for resources, can be
powerful and critical in many endeavors DEMO are
aimed at creating something new in society.
Passion is a strong indicator of how motivated an
entrepreneur is in building a venture, whether
she/he is likely to continue pursuing goals when
confronted with difficulties, how well she/he artic-
ulates the vision to current and future DEMO,

and whether she/he will be DEMO to influence, per-
suade, and lead people in growing the venture (cf.
Vallerand et al., 2003).
In this study, we investigated the extent to which
venture capitalists’ (VCs’) perceptions of the pas-
DEMO displayed by entrepreneurs in business plan
presentations influences their investment decision.
Research on VC funding decisions has suggested
that the venture idea or opportunity, the market,
the management team, and the entrepreneur mak-
ing the pitch are among the variety of criteria VCs
use in making their DEMO decisions (Hall &
Hofer, 1993; Robinson, 1987; Tyebjee & Bruno,
1984). Hisrich and Jankowicz (1990), through a se-
ries of in-depth interviews with VCs, concluded
that VCs relied on their “gut feelings” about invest-
ing in proposed new ventures.
Prior entrepreneurship research DEMO suggested
that factors that drive such “gut feelings” include
(1) the personality and background of the entrepre-
neur proposing a venture, (2) the characteristics of
the management team, and (3) the “interpersonal
chemistry” between the entrepreneurs and the VCs
(see Riquelme & Watson, 2002)DEMO These factors all
point to the “person” aspect of the proposed ven-
ture, indicating that VCs base their funding deci-
sions in part on the technical, personal, and inter-
personal capabilities of the entrepreneur proposing
DEMO new venture. It is not surprising that Arthur Rock,
the legendary Silicon Valley VC, once remarked, “I
invest in people, not ideas. If you find good people,
if they’re wrong about the product, they’ll make a
switch, so what good is it to understand the prod-
uct that they’re talking about in the first place?”
(quoted in Sahlman, 1997).
Arthur Rock’s comments suggest that investors in
general, and VCs in particular, hold implicit mental
models or theories about DEMO types of factors that
have an impact on the success of a venture and
hence on that of the investment. As Zacharakis and
Shepherd (2001) speculated, in ambiguous and un-
certain environments, where the claims made by an
entrepreneur are difficult to verify, VCs’ subjective
evaluation of the entrepreneur’s personal qualities,
such as his or her “passion,” DEMO psychologically
functional because it often boosts the VCs’ confi-
dence in their evaluation of the business plan.
To study the role of passion in DEMO VC investment
decision context, we viewed the process by which
entrepreneurs DEMO funding from VCs through pre-
senting business plans as a “persuasion process” (Els-
bach & Kramer, 2003; Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001.
We DEMO the “unimodel” (Kruglanski & Thomp-
son, 1999a, 1999b) found in the social judgment and
attitude formation and change literatures to ground
the DEMO leading to our hypotheses. Using this
model, we addressed the part DEMO the decision process
that has been traditionally missing from the VC deci-
sion literature—namely, the interpersonal, dynamic
judgment process based on the perceptions DEMO entre-
preneurs and venture teams. Further, by studying
passion and its DEMO on a typical resource alloca-
tion decision, we intended to gain DEMO better under-
standing of the mechanisms driving such decisions in
other contexts.
PASSION, PREPAREDNESS, AND
VENTURE SUCCESS
Passion and Preparedness
Passion is often DEMO with “love,” be it love
in romantic relationships, or in DEMO set-
tings such as work. Social psychologists have
treated passion as a motivational construct that
contains affective, cognitive, and behavioral com-
ponents. For DEMO, Vallerand et al. defined pas-
sion as “a strong inclination toward DEMO activity that
people like [affective], that they find important
[cognitive], and in which they invest time and en-
ergy [behavioral]” (2003: 756)DEMO Similarly, Perttula
defined passion for one’s work as “a psychological
state DEMO by intense positive emotional
arousal, internal drive and full engagement with
DEMO meaningful work activities” (2003: 15).
These two definitions suggest that passion helps
direct one’s attention and actions and that it is a
DEMO motivational construct. It is do-
main-specific because one needs to have a target of
love for passion, and this target is often a specific
activity or a collection of activities that embody
certain implicit or explicit DEMO Therefore, one
can be passionate about golfing, a single activity
reflecting achievement or hedonism as a value, or
one can be passionate about helping others through
volunteering and raising money for charities, mul-
tiple activities reflecting benevolence as a value
(Schwartz & Bardi, 2001).
In DEMO entrepreneurship literature, attempts to
define passion share a common emphasis on DEMO,
especially positive affect. For example, Baum and
Locke called passion (for work) “love” for work
(2004: 588). Shane, Locke, and Collins called it a
1 This definition is similar to the DEMO of “self-
efficacy,” (Bandura, 1977) in that self-efficacy is DEMO a
domain-specific motivational construct. However, self-
efficacy refers to an individual’s DEMO feeling and
judgment of being able to accomplish a specific task,
whereas passion refers to an individual’s intense affect
toward a specific target DEMO bears cognitive and behav-
ioral manifestations of high personal value.
2009
“selfish love of work” (2003: 268). Smilor defined
passion DEMO the “enthusiasm, joy, and even zeal that
come from the energetic and unflagging pursuit of a
worthy, challenging, and uplifting purpose” (1997:
342) and thus effectively qualified it as an affective
experience that accompanies actions laden with
value. Cardon, Wincent, Singh, and Drnovsek de-
fined it as consciously accessible intense positive
feelings experienced by engagement in DEMO
neurial activities, associated with roles that are
meaningful and salient to DEMO self-identity of the
entrepreneur (in press: 12).
Building on these definitions from the social psy-
chological and entrepreneurship literatures, we de-
fine “entrepreneurial passion” as an entrepreneur’s
intense affective state accompanied by cognitive
and DEMO manifestations of high personal
value. We explicate two aspects of this definition
with greater clarity. First, the intense affective state
is accompanied by cognition and behaviors. Pas-
sionate individuals not only experience intense
emotions—their minds are DEMO extremely active
(e.g., “I can’t stop thinking about the business ven-
ture idea”)—and they are likely to take action to
address their DEMO (see Baron [2008] for a
broader theoretical discussion of how affect DEMO
pacts entrepreneurial cognitive and behavioral pro-
cesses). To distinguish the affective from the cog-
nitive dimension of the passion construct, in this
study we label the affective aspect “passion” and
the cognitive aspect “preparedness.” Later, when
we discuss the passion construct, we use the latter
term instead of “passion” alone. We acknowledge
that passion is a multidimensional construct; how-
ever, in this study we chose to focus on the visible,
outward expressions of an entrepreneur’s passion.
Second, although the passion experience is largely
positive (Busenitz & Barney, 1997), it does not ex-
DEMO negative affective states such as anxiety or
fear, since people can DEMO ambivalent emotions
(i.e., emotions of opposite valence) regarding an
issue (Fong & Tiedens, 2002).
Linking Affective and Cognitive Passion to
Venture Success
Although few rigorous academic studies about
entrepreneurial passion exist, some recent studies
have alluded to the importance of passion in ven-
ture performance. DEMO example, Baum, Locke, and
Smith (2001) empirically tested a DEMO
sional model of venture growth, with one of their
main predictors DEMO passion. These authors
found that entrepreneurs’ traits, including tenacity,
proactivity, and passion for work, exerted positive
effects on venture growth. More importantly, pas-
Chen, Yao, and Kotha
201
sionate entrepreneurs also showed greater motiva-
tion and a higher propensity to grow their ventures
when compared DEMO others in their sample.
A few others have studied the role of social com-
petence and its influence on entrepreneurs’ finan-
cial success.2 Baron DEMO Markman (2000, 2003), for
example, found that self-reported expressiveness
(one’s tendency and ability to express emotions)
was positively related to DEMO business
incomes and their companies’ sales revenues. They
concluded that the perceived expressiveness of an
individual’s emotion in a social setting is a predic-
DEMO of the financial success of entrepreneurial ven-
tures (see also Spence, Donovan, & Brechman-
Toussaint, 1999). In another study, Baron and Tang
(in press) demonstrated that entrepreneurs’ expres-
siveness was a significant DEMO of financial
results such as growth in sales, earnings, and em-
ployment in new ventures in China. Recently,
Baron (2008) stated DEMO high levels of affect not
only made entrepreneurs more persuasive, but DEMO
contributed to the breadth of their social networks,
which in turn increased their social capital. As a
result of increased social capital, these entrepre-
neurs had a higher probability of achieving success
in new ventures.
DEMO contrast to these studies, Elsbach and Kramer’s
(2003) study provided DEMO evidence supporting
the notion that VCs may consider perceived entre-
preneurial passion when they make investment
funding decisions. Elsbach and Kramer docu-
mented how DEMO executives and producers (in-
vestors, in this context) engaged in DEMO
matching” to assess the creative potential of rela-
tively unknown screenwriters (DEMO) in Hol-
lywood pitch meetings. Within the first few min-
utes DEMO a pitch, producers quickly categorized the
pitcher into a preexisting prototype, within either a
“creative” category (e.g., “artist,” “storyteller”) or
an uncreative category (e.g., “journeyman”). One of
the most important attributes DEMO in identifying
the creative prototypes was passion, which was
mentioned frequently DEMO all forms of their data (in-
terviews, observations, and archives); that is, the
attributes identified by informants that led to a
DEMO with the creative prototypes all included the
word “passionate,” whereas for the uncreative pro-
totypes, the word was not mentioned. These find-
ings suggest that passion plays an important role in

contexts and includes skills such as the ability to per-
ceive others accurately, make a good first impression,
and persuade others to change views or DEMO
202
investment decisions for ventures that capitalize on
innovativeness and creativity.
We DEMO that the judgments about passion
represented in Elsbach and Kramer’s (2003) data
were based on information from two sources: the
nonverbal cues a pitcher displayed (affective), and
the content of the script being pitched itself (cog-
nitive). A well-written script with a thoughtful plot
and unexpected yet reasonable ending reveals the
time, effort, and resources the DEMO has invested,
or how prepared he is. Thus, how well DEMO
one is is as important as how enthusiastic one is in
predicting whether a script will be successful or
not. Similarly, the quality of a business plan should
reflect the cognitive preparedness of the entre-
preneur DEMO offers it—that is, whether he or she
would be ready to DEMO the proposed venture for-
ward if resources were provided. In this regard, the
business plan serves as an important indicator of a
venture’s potential for success.
The extant entrepreneurship literature does little
to inform us about DEMO entrepreneur passion influ-
ences VCs’ decision-making process as it occurs in
the context of business plan presentations. Al-
though it is widely acknowledged in DEMO popular
press and in entrepreneurship circles that display-
ing passion is essential in acquiring funding for
new ventures, there is little empirical research
demonstrating such a phenomenon or exploring its
theoretical underpinnings. It is this gap DEMO we
attempt to address in our study.
VENTURE INVESTMENT DECISION MAKING
AS A PERSUASION PROCESS
How do venture capitalists evaluate whether a
business plan DEMO worth investing in? Social judg-
ment research and persuasion research offer DEMO
tial insights. Persuasion involves attitude forma-
tion and change in a recipient (e.g., a VC) as a result
of exposure to information associated with an ap-
peal (e.g., the business plan presentation).3 We
DEMO the making of VCs’ funding decisions as a
persuasion process, whereby DEMO con-
vince VCs of the merits of the entrepreneurs’ pro-
posed ventures.
3 In real VC investments, the persuasion outcome is a
result of aggregating the outcomes of small moments of
persuasion (from, for example, the past five meetings
with the entrepreneurs or several visits to the DEMO).
However, in the context of our study—the business plan
presentation DEMO go/no-go decisions—the persuasion
models apply.

The Unimodel and VC Decision Making
To explicate this process, we adopt the unimodel
of persuasion (Kruglanski & Thompson, 1999a,
1999b) from social psychology, for it offers a new
conceptualization of persuasion. Although the uni-
model differs from other established paradigms
of attitude change, such as dual-process models
(Crano & Prislin, 2006; Forgas, Williams, & Von
Hippel, 2003), it has received greater recognition
and acceptance in the literature in recent years
(e.g., Kruglanski, Chen, Pierro, Mannetti, Erb, &
Spiegel, 2006; Kruglanski, Chun, Erb, Pierro, Man-
netti, & Spiegel, 2003; Pierro, Mannetti, Kruglanski,
& Sleeth-Keppler, DEMO).
In contrast to the dominant dual-process ap-
proaches (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989; Petty
& Caciopo, 1986) discussed in the literature, the
unimodel does not rely on the assumption of two
qualitatively different routes to information pro-
cessing. On the contrary, its assumption is that the
processing of issue-relevant information (the con-
tent of a message) and issue-irrelevant information
(cues other than the message itself) share the same
route and that there is only a quantitative differ-
ence between DEMO these two types of infor-
mation (Erb, Pierro, Mannetti, Spiegel, & Kruglan-
ski, 2004; Kruglanski et al., 2003).4 In DEMO words,
according to the unimodel of persuasion, there is
“functional DEMO between cues/heuristics
and messages/arguments in persuasion” (Kruglan-
ski et DEMO, 2006: 108). The unimodel also asserts that
both motivation and cognitive ability come into
play (as in dual-process approaches to understand-
ing persuasion) to determine how the receiver pro-
cesses information (exerting more DEMO less ef-
fort). This conceptualization suggests that
persuasion outcome is determined by what receiv-
ers believe to be the basis for their judgment (e.g.,
“An expert has more valid claims” or “My belief
about DEMO justice is the standard for evaluating
the validity of arguments”) and, therefore, what
qualifies as relevant evidence for consideration.
This conceptual distinction between the dual-
4 The unimodel has not addressed neurological differ-
ences in DEMO different types of information. It is
conceivable that there exist differences in processing in-
formation that is affect-laden (e.g., nonverbal cues) ver-
sus information that requires only cognitive analysis in
terms of the different brain DEMO that are activated.
However, the unimodel seems to imply that regardless DEMO
the physiological differences in processing, “cues” and
“arguments” are ruled by DEMO same laws when it comes to
having an impact on the persuasion outcomes (cf.
Brewer, 2003).
2009
process models and the unimodel addresses the
subjectivity of what information DEMO as “ev-
idence” for a persuasion-based conclusion. The
unimodel disregards the so-called qualitative dif-
ferences in information received. In the VC deci-
sion context, whether or not passion (affective)
and/or preparedness (cognitive) are considered
relevant will depend on a VC’s implicit mental
model about these DEMO pieces of information. On
the one hand, if a VC does DEMO have the passion-
venture success relationship in mind, informa-
tion about DEMO passionate an entrepreneur is will
be irrelevant to the investment funding decision.
On the other hand, if a VC strongly believes that
the display of passion is crucial for the entrepre-
neur to be successful, then passion becomes
highly relevant in the VC’s decision making
about funding. As DEMO result, we believe that the
unimodel explains the VC decision-making pro-
DEMO better than the dual-process model because
it parsimoniously captures the persuasion pro-
cess in business plan presentation.
Manifestation and Perception of Passion and
Preparedness DEMO Presentations
VC firms receive numerous business plans every
year and are often cautious about making invest-
ment decisions (Bhide´, 2000). The typical DEMO in-
vestment decision tends to be nonroutine, com-
plex, and challenging because of the market and
technical, financial, and personal uncertainties in-
DEMO in proposed ventures. Hence, VCs routinely
elaborate due diligence to accumulate DEMO much data
as possible to assess proposed ventures. Clearly,
one important aspect of this due diligence process
is listening to an entrepreneur’s business DEMO pre-
sentation and assessing his or her passion and pre-
paredness in such a context.
Passionate entrepreneurs are those who show
strong and positive DEMO toward their projects,
who cannot stop thinking and talking about their
ideas, and who are busy mobilizing resources to
turn their ideas into reality. Thus, observers of pas-
sion draw inferences about it from the affective,
cognitive, and behavioral signs the entrepreneur
displays. To VCs in a natural field setting, entre-
preneurs’ passion is observable to the extent that
they display emotions (affective manifestation of
the construct) and present DEMO for the think-
ing they have done (cognitive manifestation of the
DEMO) and the actions they have taken (behav-
ioral manifestation of the construct). In the context
of a business plan presentation, the judges cannot
observe actions beyond that of the presentation, so
Chen, Yao, and Kotha
203
in our study we were unable to include the DEMO
ioral manifestation of passion.
The affective manifestation of passion for entre-
preneurs who present business plans can include
both verbal (as in the use of words that indicate
one’s emotional state, such as “I am very excited
about the opportunity we have”) and nonverbal (as
in the DEMO of facial expressions and body language,
such as a smile) DEMO In this study, we only
examined nonverbal cues related to the DEMO
display of passion.
Evidence for thorough preparation in refining a
business idea (cognitive manifestation of the pas-
sion construct) is reflected in the DEMO of the
business plan being presented to VCs: the entrepre-
neur’s DEMO consideration of market needs, the
product or service that can meet DEMO needs, the
market segments with the greatest potential for de-
mand, competition from current or potential rivals,
the expected financial return from DEMO the
venture, and the difficulties the entrepreneur may
encounter as the DEMO unfolds. It is also reflected
in the way the entrepreneur tackles and responds to
questions from the VCs at the end of the business
DEMO presentation—whether the entrepreneur has
well-thought-out answers and creative solutions for
any concerns raised during the presentation.
The theoretical arguments, anecdotes, and re-
search DEMO earlier suggest that both passion
(affective) and preparedness (cognitive) are likely
to be considered relevant information in VCs’ judg-
ment of whether DEMO proposed venture is worth
funding. Therefore, we propose:
Hypothesis 1. DEMO a business plan presentation,
a VC’s perception of an entrepreneur’s passion
has a significant, positive effect on the VC’s
decision to invest.
Hypothesis 2. In a business plan presentation,
a VC’s perception of an DEMO pre-
paredness has a significant, positive effect on
the VC’s decision DEMO invest.
METHODS
Overview
We used multiple methods to test our hypoth-
eses. Given the paucity of the research on entre-
preneurial passion, we began by using a qualita-
tive approach to develop a perceived passion and
DEMO scale, which we subsequently re-
fined in two studies. In Study DEMO, we conducted a
laboratory experiment and examined the hypoth-
eses by DEMO the content of a business
plan and the amount of passion exhibited by its

presenter. In Study 2, we tested our hypotheses
in a field setting at a university’s annual business
plan DEMO to examine the generalizability
of our findings.
Development of the Perceived Passion Scale
We developed a scale to measure VCs’ perception
of entrepreneurs’ passion DEMO preparedness based
on entrepreneurs’ business plan presentations. We
adopted an inductive, DEMO, and multistage
approach to developing the scale. First, we admin-
istered an open-ended survey to 51 business exec-
utives, professors, doctoral students, and MBA stu-
dents. We asked these respondents to draw from
their DEMO and indicate the nonverbal cues
and behavioral indicators that would make them
think that a presenter or speaker was passionate
about her or his DEMO The number of statements
respondents provided ranged from 1 to 8, DEMO an
average of 4.7. The respondents provided a total of
239 statements.
Next, the first two authors independently sorted
the statements into categories and found high con-
sistency between their sortings (r  .92). The few
remaining discrepancies were thoroughly dis-
cussed and a final consensus was DEMO whereby
all the statements were put into six categories. We
then chose the most frequently mentioned or typi-
cal items from each category to DEMO the initial
“perceived passion” scale, which included 22
items.
We then DEMO the construct validity of these 22
items by asking 224 undergraduate, DEMO, and doc-
toral students to evaluate videotaped or live pre-
sentations. DEMO conducted an exploratory factor
analysis that led to a five-factor solution explaining
73 percent of the total variance. We dropped the 3
items that DEMO high cross-factor loadings from fur-
ther analyses. The remaining 19 items had loadings
higher than .65 on their corresponding factors. We
administered this 19-item DEMO in Study 1 (a
laboratory experiment), in which 126 people

Using the data collected from Study 1, we con-
ducted another DEMO factor analysis. This
analysis revealed a two-factor solution explaining
68 percent of the total variance in the sample. In
this analysis, we found 8 items with high cross-
factor loadings and dropped them from further
analyses. DEMO remaining 11 items had loadings
higher than .60 on their corresponding latent fac-
tors (see Table 1). The items that load on factor 1

analysis, for which we used EQS (Bentler & Weeks,
1979, 1980) revealed an adequate overall fit for the

indicate that the two-factor model better fits our
data ( 2  441.29, df  1, p  .00). The correla-
tion between these two subscales is DEMO in
both studies (r  .39, p  .01, Study DEMO; r  .46, p 

preparedness are distinct but related constructs.
These results support our conceptualization of en-
trepreneur passion as including two distinct com-
ponents DEMO the business plan presentation context.
STUDY 1: LABORATORY EXPERIMENT
Participants, Design, and Procedures
Participants in this study included 126 executive
MBA (EMBA) and MBA students who took the
corporate entrepreneurship course at a large DEMO
university in the United States, where two of the
authors were DEMO members. All students volun-
teered to participate in the study. The average age
of the participants was 37.10 (s.d.  7.30), with an
average of 14.30 years of working experience
(s.d.  7.90). Seventy percent were male, 21.6 per-
cent had a four-year undergraduate degree, DEMO per-
cent had a master’s degree, and 5 percent had a
DEMO degree. Moreover, 75 percent of partici-
pants had taken public speaking DEMO
The experimental design was a two (high or low
passion) by two (high- or medium-quality business
plan) factorial, resulting in four experimental con-
ditions. To choose the appropriate business plans
to use, we examined those that had been entered in
the previous year’s business plan competition DEMO
the same public university. After many rounds of
deliberation, we selected DEMO business plan that
was ranked 1st out of the 16 in the semifinal round
of the competition and the plan that was ranked
8th. DEMO 16 semifinalists were selected from an
initial submission pool of 64 plans during 2004.
The 1st-ranked plan represented a high-quality bio-
technology venture, and the 8th-ranked plan was a
medium-quality venture proposing a financial mag-
azine DEMO teenagers.
We first constructed written executive summa-
ries of these two plans for our experiment partici-
pants and then recruited a professional actor to

experimental conditions: a medium-quality DEMO

and a high-quality business plan presented with or

affective passion (or not, depending on the experi-
mental condition), but to keep the content (the
words used to describe the business plan) exactly
the same for the respective business plans. The
experiment’s purpose was to examine the impact of
passion and preparedness on funding DEMO
Several rehearsals were conducted before the final
video was shot. All four experimental condition
videos lasted for eight minutes.
We randomly chose one of DEMO four experimental
condition videos to be presented to a group of
EMBA or MBA students in classrooms equipped
with audiovisual facilities. They were told DEMO role-
play VCs and make a funding decision for the busi-
ness plan they saw on video. We first gave them the
business plan’s DEMO executive summary and
asked them to read and consider investing in the
proposed venture for ten minutes. We then showed
them the entrepreneur’s presentation DEMO the busi-
ness plan in the video and asked them to fill out a
questionnaire evaluating the entrepreneur’s pas-
sion and preparedness on a DEMO scale (1, “not
at all,” to 5, “frequently”), DEMO an investment
decision (i.e., “yes” or “no”), provide reasons for
their decision, and answer a few demographic
questions. After the questionnaires were collected,
the participants were debriefed and the session was
concluded.
Variables
DEMO for investment decision. We listed five
reasons for a funding decision: (1) the business
model made sense, (2) the product was DEMO, (3)
the entrepreneur was enthusiastic and the manage-
ment team members had strong backgrounds (the
executive summary of the business plans described
team backgrounds), (4) there was an attractive mar-
ket for DEMO product, and (5) the business idea was
profitable. Participants were DEMO to check all rea-
sons that applied and were encouraged to list any
other reasons not provided on the list.
Demographic variables. Given that DEMO studies
have examined the effects of venture capitalists’
individual differences on their decision making,
we started with those variables that might have an
DEMO, such as age, sex, years of work experience,
education DEMO, and whether the participant had
taken a public speaking lesson, since this experi-
ence could have an impact on how he or she

in the high-passion condition perceived more DEMO
sion (mean  3.65) than those in the low-passion
condition (DEMO  1.78; F1, 121  158.45, p  .001).
DEMO results suggest that the actor was successful
in controlling the nonverbal cues (i.e., body move-
ment, facial expression, tone of voice) displayed
during the presentation. These results confirm that
our manipulation of passion was DEMO in induc-
ing participants’ perception of passion.
To ensure the effectiveness of the business plan
quality manipulation, we used participants’ evalu-
ation on the preparedness subscale and conducted
a one-way ANOVA. The results showed that the
DEMO in the high-quality condition gave
significantly higher scores (mean  3.67) than
those in the medium-quality condition (mean 
3.36; F1, 121  10.60, p  .01). These results confirm
that our choice of business plans of different qual-
ity level effectively generated different perceptions
DEMO preparedness in the participants.
To examine whether the entrepreneur/manage-
ment team factor was of primary concern to the
participants in their investment decision DEMO,
we calculated the frequencies with which the par-
ticipants chose the five reasons. As predicted, rea-
son 3 (the entrepreneur was enthusiastic DEMO the
management team members had strong back-
grounds), given by 69 percent of the participants,
was the most frequent; it was followed by reason 1
(the business model made sense), given by 58 per-
cent; reason 2 (the product was creative), 47 per-
DEMO; reason 5 (the business idea was profitable), 41
percent; DEMO reason 4 (there was an attractive mar-
ket for the product), 40 percent. These results are
consistent with findings from previous research
(DEMO, MacMillan, Siegel, & Narasimha, 1985; Tyeb-
jee & Bruno, 1981, 1984), indicating the importance
of the entrepreneur and management team as the
focal point of the investment decision regarding a
new venture.
DEMO testing. Table 2 presents the correla-
tions between the variables of interest. Because the
dependent variable of our study—investment deci-
sion—was dichotomous, we used logistic hierar-
chical regression analyses to test the general hy-
pothesis that DEMO perceptions of the passion of a
presenter would significantly influence their fund-
ing decisions. Three out of the 126 Study 1 partic-
ipants did DEMO make investment decisions, and an
additional 2 participants did not provide DEMO
tion on whether they had taken public speaking
lessons, so we DEMO these five cases from the
final analysis, resulting in 121 valid DEMO points.
We entered all of the demographic variables in step
1, DEMO two manipulated variables (i.e., the nonver-
bal display of passion and the business plan’s qual-
ity) and their interaction term in step 2, and then in
step 3 we entered the perceived passion and pre-
paredness variables. Table 3 presents the results.
The results in Table 3 DEMO that after the
effects of the demographic variables were con-
trolled for, the experimental manipulation ex-
plained a significant amount of variance in partic-
ipants’ investment decision (R2  16%, p  .01),
with a significant, positive effect from the quality of
the business plan (DEMO 2.13, p  .01). More impor-
tantly, we found that neither the main effect of the
passion manipulation nor its interaction with DEMO
ness plan quality was significant at the .05 level,
suggesting that passion might not have the pre-
dicted effect.

hypotheses. Since we were DEMO in the indi-
vidual-level relationship between perceived pas-
sion and funding decision, even though each judge
evaluated four business plans, we treated each
DEMO as an independent observation. We en-
tered the judge’s demographic variables (DEMO, sex,
education, public speaking lessons, and work ex-
perience) in step 1. Because the business plan in
the competition was not DEMO, we coded it
as a dummy variable and also entered it DEMO a control
variable at this stage (each plan was given a DEMO
number). In step 2, we entered the two key vari-
DEMO passion and preparedness. Table
5 presents the results of this analysis.
Findings from Study 2 were consistent with re-
sults from Study 1; we found that overall perceived
passion and preparedness explained a significant
amount of DEMO variance in judges’ investment
decisions (R2  24%, p  .001). These results
provide considerable support for our broad hypoth-
esis that DEMO perceptions of entrepreneur passion
and preparedness positively impact their invest-
ment-funding decisions.
A closer examination of Table 5 indicates that the
explained unique variance DEMO mainly from pre-
paredness (  1.69, p  .01). As in Study 1’s
results, the effect of passion is not statistically sig-
nificant ( 0.09, n.s.). These findings support
Hypothesis 2 DEMO not Hypothesis 1. They suggest
209
that with our experienced judges, DEMO was the per-
ceived preparedness rather than the passion of the
presenter(s) that significantly influenced their in-
vestment decisions.
Additional analysis. To further examine the me-
diating role of perceived preparedness in the busi-
ness DEMO quality–funding decision relationship,
we used the panel funding decision as an indica-
tion of business plan quality. That is, we coded the
business plan that was chosen by each panel to
advance to the final DEMO as having a higher qual-
ity (coded 1) than those not chosen (coded 0). We
then conducted a three-step regression analysis
(DEMO & Kenny, 1986) to test the mediation effect.
Consistently with the results from Study 1, we
found that (1) the quality of a business plan had
significant effects on perceived preparedness (
0.65, DEMO  .01) and the judges’ funding decision (
2.16, p DEMO .01); (2) perceived preparedness had a
significant effect on the judges’ funding decision
( 1.97, p  .01); and (3) when both the quality of
a business plan and perceived preparedness were
entered simultaneously, the effects of both vari-
ables remained significant ( DEMO 1.71 and 1.83, re-
spectively, p  .01). These results again suggest
that perceived preparedness was a partial mediator
between business plan DEMO and the judges’
funding decisions.
In sum, results from both Studies DEMO and 2 provide
strong support for Hypothesis 2 but not for
Hypothesis 1.
DISCUSSION
This study systematically investigated the role
passion and preparedness played DEMO VCs’ invest-
ment decision making. The results support our con-
ceptualization that in the context of business plan
presentations, the passion construct has two dis-
tinct but related components—passion and pre-
paredness. Passion is manifested through DEMO ex-
pressions, body movement, tone of voice, and other
nonverbal DEMO, whereas preparedness is mani-
fested in the verbal content and substance DEMO a
presentation.
Passion and Preparedness: Counterintuitive,
Contrasting Effects
In the DEMO studies we conducted, we found pre-
paredness to be positively related DEMO the VC funding
decision, whereas the effects of perceived passion
were DEMO insignificant. We also found that
preparedness partially mediated the relationship
between business plan quality and the funding de-

cision. According to the unimodel of DEMO
employed to ground our theoretical arguments, pre-
paredness information is more DEMO than the
information on passion in a VC’s mind. These find-
ings are both counterintuitive and intriguing. The
findings are counterintuitive because the affective
DEMO is what comes to people’s mind when “pas-
sion” is mentioned; DEMO, we found no signifi-
cant effects of this variable on VCs’ DEMO about
funding new ventures. In contrast, the VCs in our
study DEMO more receptive to cognition-based pre-
paredness. They tended to focus on their percep-
tions of how prepared an entrepreneur was as a
way of DEMO the entrepreneur’s passion for his
or her venture. In other words, DEMO results are more
nuanced than our general understanding of passion
as used in ordinary parlance.
However, these findings somewhat echo Baron’s
(1989) analysis of why some people are more suc-
cessful than others in employing DEMO
agement tactics to get favorable evaluations: they
appear more sincere and DEMO than those who
are less successful. In other words, their ingratia-
DEMO comes with “substance.” Along the same lines,
if an entrepreneur shows affective passion, yet her
or his business plan lacks substance, it DEMO as if the
ingratiation is fake and manipulative, and thus un-
DEMO to generate a positive effect. Several studies
conducted by Ferris, Treadway, and colleagues
(e.g., Ferris, Treadway, Perrewe, Brouer, Douglas, &DEMO
Lux, 2007; Treadway, Ferris, Duke, Adams, &
Thatcher, 2007) have demonstrated the importance
of “sincerity” as a necessary component of successful
political skills.
These findings are intriguing because, on the sur-
face, they seem inconsistent with prior entrepre-
neurship research that indicates a positive relation-
ship between passion (operationalized as intense
affect or emotional expressiveness) DEMO firm- or
individual-level outcome variables such as venture
growth/success (Baum DEMO al., 2001) and entrepre-
neur financial success (Baron & Markman, 2000,
2003; Spence et al., 1999). However, our study dif-
fers significantly from the extant studies high-
lighted above in terms DEMO the context studied and
the outcome variable examined. It is conceivable
that passion may be important in sustaining an
entrepreneur’s motivation in making a DEMO suc-
cessful over the long term (i.e., growth) (Baum et
al., 2001). However, it appears that neither the in-
vestors DEMO played the role of VCs nor the actual
VCs in our study considered it relevant in making
their funding decisions, which in practice may not
be unusual. This story about the managing partner
of Northwest Venture DEMO is illustrative: “He
[the managing partner] had the opportunity to be DEMO
early investor in a small company called Starbucks.
He liked the passion of Howard Schultz but didn’t
understand how one would make money selling
DEMO, so he didn’t invest” (Ouchi, 2004: c4). The
theme of this passage is not unlike our findings
here: it was the substance of Starbucks’ business
plan that seemed to have mattered to the DEMO from
Northwest Venture Associates, and not the affec-
tive passion displayed DEMO Mr. Schultz.
We can only speculate on other possible expla-
nations as to why the effect of perceived passion
was statistically insignificant. First, compared to
the general population, the judges in the business
plan competition were highly educated, had signif-
icant investing experience, and had (for the most
part) taken public speaking lessons. As a result, it is
DEMO that they were more aware of the danger of
emphasizing emotional expression (displayed as
passion) as opposed to the substance of the busi-
DEMO plans being presented to them. Second, the
entrepreneurs in the business DEMO competition
were also more experienced in presentation than
the general population. Since substantial financial
amounts were involved (i.e., $100,000 worth of fi-
DEMO awards in our setting), most entrepreneurs
in our field study had gone through two competi-
tive rounds and one noncompetitive round of
coaching DEMO presentation style before entering the
semifinal round of the competition. It is possible
that these earlier activities reduced the possible
variation in presentation styles DEMO the judges
observed.
This suggests a final possibility, a restriction of
DEMO in our data set. Perhaps in a randomly chosen
large sample of entrepreneurs making their invest-
ment pitches, one would observe a greater variation
in presentation styles (nonverbal cues) than was
available in a restricted DEMO such as ours. It is
likely that the role of passion may turn out to be
different from what we were able to uncover. DEMO
these possibilities suggest that more research is
needed to understand the role of perceived passion
in the context of investment decisions.
Contributions
The present DEMO makes several contributions to
the understanding of the VC investment decision
process. First, we developed perceived passion and
preparedness scales that help distinguish between
the affective and cognitive components involved in
preparing and presenting business plans. DEMO our
knowledge, this is the first study that has devel-
oped DEMO scales in a venture-funding context. Sec-
ond, this is one of DEMO few studies that empirically

links derived passion and preparedness DEMO
to VC investment decisions. As a result of the mul-
tiple approaches (qualitative, experimental, and
field studies) we employed to validate and DEMO our
proposed passion construct, our study is theoreti-
cally grounded and DEMO rigorous.
Third, our conceptualization of the VC funding
decision as a DEMO process provides a useful
perspective from which to study the interpersonal
dynamics between VCs and entrepreneurs. It re-
veals the underlying mechanisms involved in DEMO
often “mysterious” new venture investment deci-
sion. Fourth, our use of DEMO unimodel of persuasion
to explain the role of passion and preparedness in
the VC funding decision represents the application
of a rigorous theoretical model DEMO social psychology
literature to a novel setting. The differential im-
pacts on our outcome variable that we found for
passion and preparedness help to DEMO a tenta-
tive theoretical foundation for further study of the
passion construct in situations in which the social
and interpersonal aspects of persuasion matter. DEMO
example, the perceived passion and preparedness
scales developed for this study DEMO have the po-
tential to transcend the VC-entrepreneur setting
and apply to a wide variety of selection contexts
that involve live presentations, such as job talks in
academic settings, project report presentations in
corporate settings, DEMO role auditions in the enter-
tainment business.
Finally, our theory-driven approach DEMO studying
the effects of passion and preparedness in the con-
text of entrepreneur-VC dynamics extends previous
research on VC decision making in both scope DEMO
depth. Researchers conducting past VC funding
studies have either run experiments in which sim-
plified business plans are assessed, without the
entrepreneur(s) DEMO the plans making a case for
them (Shepherd, 1999), or they have asked partic-
ipants to highlight the criteria they use to DEMO
new venture business plans (e.g., Hall & Hofer,
1993; DEMO & Jankowicz, 1990). In contrast, our
study participants were exposed to extensive de-
tails about the business plans and were able to
DEMO with the entrepreneurs (and entire venture
teams) in vivo. Thus, DEMO setting enabled us to
capture investors’ subjective interpretation of infor-
mation about the process, whether it related to the
plan or to the person, thereby circumventing the
biases that could have resulted from the post hoc
self-reported assessments found in earlier studies.
Limitations
Although our initial results are DEMO, we
recognize several limitations. The experimental
setting for Study 1 was DEMO Further, the busi-
ness plan competition, although real in terms of the
financial rewards, is a very specialized setting for
studying the passion construct. These two condi-
tions could limit our findings’ generalizability.
Hence, more research is needed to examine passion
versus preparedness in impacting business deci-
DEMO in other domains such as job interviewing,
hiring, promotion, and performance appraisal.
In our approach, we did not directly examine
behaviors that accompany the display of passion.
In reality, investors such as VCs and entrepreneurs
often interact with each other on more than one
occasion, and VCs get opportunities to observe en-
trepreneurs in different contexts. We suspect DEMO
VCs would perceive repeated behaviors as more
telling of internal passion than a one-time presen-
tation, because repeated behaviors might reflect a
deeper level of involvement and commitment to a
proposed venture. Hence, more research is needed
to examine how the behavioral component of pas-
sion influences VCs’ DEMO in contexts in which
entrepreneurs and VCs interact more extensively.
Given our conceptualization of passion and pre-
paredness in VC investment decisions, we limited
our efforts to examining just a simple mediation
effect of preparedness on DEMO relationship between
the quality of a business plan and a judge’s funding
decision. Future research should expand our model
to include more variables for DEMO moderat-
ing and mediating effects. For example, an entre-
preneur’s qualifications DEMO prior track record in
venturing, the innovativeness of a proposed busi-
DEMO plan, the industry in which the proposed ven-
ture belongs, and the degree of marketing or tech-
nical uncertainty pertaining to the proposed
DEMO may all be important moderating variables.
On the VC side, prior DEMO investing experi-
ence, preference (or bias) toward certain types of
DEMO plans, and personal preference for certain
entrepreneur characteristics may also be DEMO
moderating variables in the persuasion process.
In this study, we focused DEMO on the commu-
nication of one’s internal experience of passion
through nonverbal and verbal cues. The perceived
passion and preparedness scale only captures what
DEMO perceiver thinks to be signs of a passionate
presenter. Our study therefore lends further sup-
port to Baron and colleagues’ (Baron & Markman,
2000, 2003; Baron & Tang, in press) findings that
expressiveness, or the ability to communicate one’s
emotions, affects the financial performance of one’s
venture. In reality, however, passion is more than
just expressed DEMO perceived emotions. Entrepre-
neurs’ subjective experiences and corresponding
cognitions and actions might be quite different and

far richer than what outsiders can observe. DEMO,
future research should look beyond perceived pas-
sion and preparedness to articulate the passion
construct and should explore the measurement of
internally experienced DEMO, its antecedents,
and its consequences. More research is also needed
DEMO whether experienced and exhibited passions
predict different outcomes (e.g., immediate funding
decision or future success), and on the different
mechanisms underlying such DEMO
Implications
The findings of our study may help entrepre-
neurs increase the likelihood of their obtaining
funding. New-product champions, “intrapre-
neurs,” entrepreneurs, DEMO nonprofit enthusiasts
will be more effective if they are better prepared in
delivering their ideas or plans. Specifically, those
who have accurate and detailed knowledge about
their proposals and who display a thorough under-
standing of DEMO opportunities and challenges they
face are in a better position to receive investment
funding.
Some might argue that all the objective criteria
earlier research DEMO included (e.g., market opportu-
nities, competition, and strategies) already DEMO
the issue of preparedness. However, our results
suggest that perceived preparedness DEMO be the
“missing link” between a set of objective criteria
VCs may or may not use in their investment deci-
sions. They show that DEMO presentation of con-
tent is just as important as the content itself. Thus,
our advice for entrepreneurs is this: If you are pas-
sionate about your business idea, do your home-
work and do it well; then go out and let the poten-
tial investors know that you are prepared and
poised!
In summary, we believe that this study makes an
important contribution to the entrepreneurship lit-
erature. It suggests that DEMO is one of the
most salient cues VCs consider relevant in judging
whether a business plan is worth funding or not,
and that DEMO is a construct that scholars need to
study more systematically. As W. Eugene Smith, a
world-renowned photojournalist, once put it, “Pas-
sion is in all great searches and is necessary to all
creative endeavors” (http://www.smithfund.org/
aboutfund/overview). Further pursuit of the effects
of DEMO will, we hope, improve understanding of
the investment decision-making processes of VCs
and others.
