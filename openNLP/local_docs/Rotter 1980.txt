Interpersonal Trust, Trustworthiness,
and Gullibility
JULIAN B. ROTTER University of Connecticut
ABSTRACT: This article reviews the positive and
potential negative consequences of being high or low
in interpersonal trust in current social life, particularly
in interacting with ordinary people. A summary and
analysis of many investigations lead DEMO the following
conclusions applicable to the population studied:
People who trust more are less likely to lie and are
possibly less likely to DEMO or steal. They are more
likely to give others a second chance and to respect
the rights of others. The high truster is less DEMO to
be unhappy, conflicted, or maladjusted, and is liked
more DEMO sought out as a friend more often, both by
low-trusting and DEMO others. When gullibility
is defined as naivete or foolishness and trust is defined
as believing others in the absence of clear-cut reasons
to disbelieve, then it can be shown over a series of
studies that high DEMO are not more gullible than
low trusters.
A recent New York Times editorial referred to
the present time as "the age of suspicion." DEMO
cusing on the political costs of excessive distrust,
the editors expressed the hope that Americans
might return to a more trusting attitude toward
DEMO government and themselves. An equally
forceful plea might be made in terms of the enor-
mous personal costs of excessive distrust. Com-
mon sense DEMO us that interpersonal trust is an
important variable affecting human relationships
at all levels: relationships between governments,
between minorities and majorities, buyers DEMO
sellers, patients and therapists, parents and chil-
dren, and so DEMO As distrust increases, the social
fabric disintegrates. Unwarranted distrust can re-
DEMO in serious negative'consequences, but "foolish
trust," or gullibility, DEMO also lead to serious con-
sequences. We need to ask two questions: What
is unwarranted distrust? And what are the costs of
trusting DEMO much?" Although psychologists can-
not be expected to provide definitive answers to
such complex questions, we can address ourselves
to aspects of the problem.

About 14 years ago at DEMO University of Con-
necticut, a program of research dealing with inter-
DEMO trust was begun. The present report
deals with some of this research involving the per-
sonal consequences of being high or low in inter-
DEMO trust. Most psychologists have to answer
the question of how trusting they should be, not
only in making decisions about their personal lives
but also in deciding about their roles as teachers,
therapists, and parents. How trusting we are is
important to others as well as to DEMO, since
some of our research strongly suggests that model-
ing and DEMO teaching are the most potent forces
in developing high- or low-trusting beliefs in chil-
dren (Into, 1969; Katz & Rotter, 1969).
DEMO the context of social learning theory, inter-
personal trust has been DEMO as a generalized
expectancy held by an individual that the word,
promise, oral or written statement of another in-
dividual or group can be relied on (Rotter, 1967).
This definition differs from that DEMO other psycholo-
gists who define trust as a belief in the goodness
of others or in the benign nature of the world.
If expectancies DEMO others' communications can
be relied on are generalized from one social DEMO
to another, then the individual will build up a
generalized expectancy DEMO trust of others that
might be viewed as a relatively stable personality
characteristic. In our original research we at-
tempted to determine whether such DEMO,
relatively stable expectancies for trusting others
exist and can be reliably measured, and we have
found considerable support for the utility of such

a generalized expectancy (Rotter, 1971). But it
is necessary at DEMO point to describe what is meant
by a generalized expectancy and its place in social
learning theory (Rotter, 1954; Rotter, Chance, &DEMO
Phares, 1972).
In social learning theory expectancies in each
situation DEMO determined not only by specific ex-
periences in that situation but also, to some vary-
ing degree, by experiences in other situations that
DEMO individual perceives as similar. One of the de-
terminants of the relative importance of general-
ized expectancies, as opposed to specific expectan-
cies, DEMO a given situation is the amount of experi-
ence one has had in that particular situation.
These points are emphasized because, for some
people, the idea of a generalized expectancy means
an assumption that there is no situational speci-
ficity. Of course there is both situational speci-
ficity DEMO cross-situational generality determining
behavior, and the relative importance of each de-
DEMO on the amount of previous experience with
the particular situation being considered. , It also
follows that if one is trying to get a DEMO measure
of a generalized expectancy, one should avoid
stimuli with which DEMO individual has had a great
deal of previous, specific experience, such as father,
mother, lover, and friend, and one should try
instead to -sample widely from a large number of
social agents. So DEMO is the trust of a generalized
other—a person or group with whom one has not
had a (great deal of personal experience—in which
we are most interested.
In order to measure such a generalized ex-
pectancy, we developed a questionnaire that has
shown construct validity in predicting attitudinal,DEMO
sociometric, behavioral, and unobtrusive criteria
in a variety of situations (DEMO, 1967, 1971);
that is, consistent, with theoretical expectations,DEMO
a moderate portion of the variance was predicted
by this test for these criteria. Most correlations
have been in the .30s and .40s. In DEMO great
majority of these studies, the Interpersonal Trust
Scale was administered DEMO someone other than the
experimenter and was separated in time from the
criterion situation by periods ranging from one to
four months. This temporal DEMO of test ad-
ministration and experimental criterion situation
was maintained in all the investigations discussed
below, with a few specified exceptions.
Below, I DEMO examine the positive relationships
or consequences of being a high truster, DEMO later

ships or consequences, particularly the issue of
gullibility.
Trust and Prasocial Behavior
Previously reported research (Rotter, 1971) has
documented the strong relationship between high
trust and trustworthiness. Whether the criterion
DEMO a self-report questionnaire or behavior in a con-
trolled experiment, people DEMO act more trusting
or say they are more trusting are themselves less
likely to lie.
In addition to lying, other behavioral indicators
of trustworthiness and lack of trustworthiness have
been studied. For example, it is reasonable to
expect that some people are more likely than
others to behave DEMO an untrustworthy fashion in
situations in which the perceived risk of being
caught in the act is minimal.
In an experiment whose primary focus DEMO the
investigation of sex guilt, Boroto (1970) obtained
the interesting DEMO finding that subjects who
did not invade the privacy of the experimenter
when they did not think they were being observed
were very high DEMO interpersonal trust.
Steinke (1975) tested subjects on a task in
which it was possible for the experimenter to
detect cheating without directly observing DEMO
subjects. Subjects .were tested in groups of four
and were told that they were competing with one
another and with other subjects in the DEMO
for a monetary prize to be awarded when the ex-
periment was completed. When the Peer subscale
of the Interpersonal Trust Scale was used DEMO divide
subjects into high and low trusters, it was found
that DEMO trusters had cheated significantly more
often than had high trusters.
In another study, subjects' belief that they were
being observed was experimentally manipulated.
DEMO (Note 1) asked subjects to practice on
a series of boring and repetitive arithmetic prob-
lems for 10 minutes as preparation for a DEMO
test. In one condition, each subject was told that
the experimenter DEMO be in an adjacent room,
behind an observation window, while DEMO subject
worked on the practice problems. In a second
condition, the DEMO window was present but
the subject was told the experimenter would wait
down the hall. In the third condition, there was
no observation window in the room and the sub-
ject was told the experimenter would DEMO down
the hall. Among females, high trusters worked as
hard, that is, completed the same number of
problems, regardless of whether they believed that
the experimenter was watching them. Low trust-
ers, on the other hand, worked significantly less
hard DEMO they believed they were not being ob-
served than when they believed the experimenter
was. behind the one-way mirror. In the surveil-
lance condition, they worked as hard as high-
trusting females; in the no-surveillance conditions,
they worked less hard than did high trustees. No
such pattern DEMO differences was obtained for males
for reasons that are not clear but are probably
related to different attitudes of males and females
toward the DEMO task.
Wright and Kirmani (1977) surveyed a large
number of high school students and had them
complete an anonymous questionnaire, as well as
the Interpersonal Trust Scale and items dealing
with a number of social DEMO They also in-
cluded self-reports of shoplifting. Although,
overall, females DEMO to less shoplifting than
did males, female low trusters reported signifi-
DEMO more shoplifting than did female high
trusters. Wright and Kirmani also asked whether
the subjects felt that people in the two surround-
ing communities DEMO students. The low
trusters of both sexes showed significantly greater
feelings of being distrusted, and this item was
significantly related to frequency of shoplifting.
Of course, the relationship between low trust
and untrustworthy behavior seems readily explain-
able. If low trusters truly feel that other people
cannot be DEMO, there is less moral pressure on
them to tell the truth, and under some circum-
stances they may feel that lying, cheating, DEMO
similar behaviors are necessary for defensive rea-
sons—because everybody else is doing it to them.
Most of the work reported above has been done
DEMO college students, and the generalizability of
these findings to other populations DEMO not known.
It may seem that the interpretation of these stud-
ies is leading to good guy —bad guy stereotypes,
but that may DEMO due to the nature of the variable
we have been investigating and to the logical cri-
teria that variable predicts. We do have some
DEMO which suggest that high trusters may be more
conventional and more moralistic than low trusters.
These attributes, at least, are not necessarily posi-
DEMO ones.
In addition to trustworthiness and moral be-
havior, there are DEMO concomitants or conse-
quences of trust that may be of interest, DEMO,
personal adjustment and likability. In six of the
studies we have done with college students, scores
on the Incomplete Sentences Blank, a DEMO
tured test of college student adjustment or con-
flict, were available. DEMO all six studies, higher
trust was significantly related to better adjustment
DEMO the total sample of the study. The correlations
ranged from .20 to .44. These findings are in gen-
eral agreement with those of Collins DEMO Wrights-
man (1926), who found a similar relationship be-
tween DEMO and adjustment with 12-IS-year-old
boys, using other measures of trust and DEMO
Before describing the investigations of gullibil-
ity, I should mention one DEMO recently com-
pleted study, which dealt with the positive conse-
quences DEMO being more trusting. Hochreich (Note
2) asked a large number of subjects, male and
female, high and low trusters, simply to read a test
protocol of the Interpersonal Trust Scale, pre-
sumably filled out by a real subject. The name
at the top of the protocol DEMO that the per-
son who had taken the scale was either a male
or a female, and the scale was answered either in
a trusting or, a distrusting direction. After reading
the protocol, subjects were DEMO to rate the tar-
get person on a number of characteristics. Hoch-
reich's results were surprising. Byrne (1971) and
his colleagues have DEMO demonstrated that
there is a strong tendency for people to like others
who are similar to themselves in attitudes, opin-
ions, and personality' characteristics, but Hoch-
reich found that in general, everyone likes a DEMO
truster. More specifically, regardless of the sex
of either the subject DEMO the target person, the-
high truster was seen as being happier, more
ethical, and more attractive to the opposite sex, as
having DEMO a happier childhood, and as more de-
sirable as a close DEMO than the low-trust target.
There was strong agreement among all subjects
on many of these ratings, but some of the other
findings indicated that subjects were not respond-
ing in a simpleminded, nondiscriminating fashion.
For example, all subjects believed that the low-
trust target was more likely than the high-trust
target to have had varied and unusual experi-
ences. Overall, too, the low-trust target was seen
as having more common sense than the high-trust
target, though this difference was significant only
for subjects who were themselves low in trust.
There was no overall effect for ratings DEMO academic
ability, .although female high trusters did rate the
high-trust target DEMO significantly higher on this
variable.

Trust and Gullibility
So much for the positive concomitants, or conse-
quences of being a high truster. What can be
said about the possible DEMO consequences of
being taken in too much, of being gullible?
DEMO considering the relationship of gullibility
to interpersonal trust, some refinement of DEMO con-
cept of trust has to be made. If trust is simply
believing communications, then high trust must be
equated with gullibility. However, DEMO we redefine
trust as believing communications in the absence
of clear or strong reasons for not believing (i.e., in
ambiguous situations) and gullibility as believing
when most people of the same social group would
consider DEMO naive and foolish, then trust can
be independent of gullibility. In DEMO, anecdotal
evidence suggests that it is the low truster who is
DEMO in by the disarming dishonesty of the con
artist and is the frequent victim of con games.
It may also be true that the DEMO of the high
truster is more a belief in the moral Tightness of
trust of the stranger than it is an expectancy of
less DEMO in trusting others. The studies already
reviewed clearly suggest that the high truster is
more likely than the low truster to act morally.
Gullibility DEMO been denned as naivete or fool-
ishness. To translate that into experimental cri-
teria is not always easy. In the studies how to
be DEMO, gullibility was defined as believing
another person when there was some DEMO
evidence that the person should not be believed.
Either the other person had already lied to the
subject one or more times, or most people would
consider that person's statement to be implausible
on other DEMO To trust a stranger who has
not lied to you before would not be gullibility;
to believe a politician who has lied to DEMO many
times before is gullibility.
In several of our earlier investigations no evi-
dence was found that high trusters behaved in a
way that DEMO be called, somewhat arbitrarily per-
haps, more gullible than low trusters. Of course,
there are problems in trying to prove the null
DEMO However, in reviewing these studies
and some others to be described, there are con-
siderations that at any rate increase the plausi-
bility DEMO the idea that, overall, high trusters are
no more gullible than-low trusters.
It appears to me that there are four criteria
that can DEMO applied in estimating the probability
that the null hypothesis can be accepted. First,
is the criterion behavior measured reliably? Sec-
4 • JANUARY 1980 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
ond, is the criterion behavior valid? That'DEMO, is
there evidence that it can be predicted by or
related DEMO other variables in a logical way? Third,
are there a DEMO of investigations with different
subjects and different operations that have pro-
duced similar results? And fourth, are the statis-
tically nonsignificant differences in DEMO studies
not all in the same direction?
In other words, DEMO one can show in a series of in-
vestigations in which two groups did not differ
significantly that the criterion behaviors were reli-
ably DEMO, the criterion behaviors could be
logically predicted by other variables, the subject
populations were varied as were the criteria, and
the nonsignificant differences were not always in
the same direction, then one can assert that one
has produced evidence increasing the probability
that the null hypothesis can DEMO accepted.
For example, we can apply these criteria to
Rotter's (1967) sociometric study. In this study
of college fraternity and sorority members who
had lived with each other for at least six months,
DEMO Interpersonal Trust Scale did correlate .38
with the sociometric ratings of interpersonal trust;
in this case the two measures were given in the
DEMO experimental session. However, there was
no significant relationship between the Interper-
DEMO Trust Scale or the sociometric rating of
trust and the sociometric ratings of gullibility,
where gullibility was defined as being "naive and
, easily fooled." Ratings for sociometric variables
were highly reliable, and the DEMO ratings
of dependency were highly related to gullibility.
The latter relationship was significantly higher
than that between gullibility and any other
variable.
A study DEMO Geller (1966) involved a faulty
apparatus that had ostensibly just delivered a
strong shock to the experimenter. Following his
shock the experimenter took DEMO few seconds to
"fix" the apparatus and then told the subject it
was all right. Geller had three conditions. In
the first condition, subjects had no prior reason
to be suspicious. In the second, involving a mildly
suspicious group, the subjects had previously gone
through an Asch conformity situation with the
same experimenter. In the third condition, sub-
jects had been told by a confederate that they had
been deceived by DEMO experimenter in the Asch
situation.
The three groups differed as expected in the
behavioral trust shown toward the apparatus.
Trusting behavior was reliably rated by two ob-
servers behind a one-way DEMO screen. High-
trust subjects were significantly more trusting than
low-trust subjects in the first condition but were
no more trusting behaviorally in the third, de-
ception-revealed condition. In other words, the
criterion behavior could be shown to be a reliable
and valid measure of trust, but high-trust sub-
jects Were no more gullible than low-trust sub-
jects, once the former had a strong reason to dis-
trust the experimenter.
Two studies involving DEMO behavior, by Wright
(1972) and Hamsher (1968), are also relevant to
the study of trust and gullibility. Both of these
involved DEMO notes to another player; the
notes were intercepted by the experimenter, who
substituted his own. After being deceived once
before and with no DEMO, high and low trusters
did not differ significantly in their subsequent DEMO
of the other subject. Both of these studies also
met the criteria proposed above for a valid test of
the null hypothesis. In the DEMO studies referred
to above, two of the nonsignificant differences in
gullibility DEMO high and low trusters favored
high trusters, and two favored low DEMO
There are some additional data that bear, per-
haps less directly, on the gullibility of high
trusters. Some people, obviously low trusters, DEMO
lieve that high trusters are just plain dumb. We
do not have individual intelligence tests on our
subjects, but we do have college aptitude scores
and in one study a range of educational attain-
ment. In DEMO of our studies, we have corre-
lated scholastic aptitude scores with DEMO scores
and have in each case found a nonsignificant rela-
tionship. Rotter and Stein (1971) investigated
subjects' trust of a number of occupational groups,
using a variety of different populations. There
were no differences DEMO the average trust assigned
to the various occupations as a function of the
subjects' educational attainment. Educationally,
the subjects ranged from high school graduates
through holders of a master's degree.
Wright and Shea (Note 3) examined the ac-
ceptance of personality interpretations in a study
in which all subjects were given the same stereo-
typed, positive, high-base-rate DEMO as feed-
back a week after taking two personality question-
naires that were not relevant to the actual state-
ments made about them. The DEMO rated the
accuracy of the statements. As in our other
studies, DEMO Interpersonal Trust Scale had been
administered earlier in the semester, along DEMO the
Internal-External Locus of Control Scale. Here
again, high trusters and DEMO trusters did not differ
in their degree of acceptance of these stereotyped
personality analyses, but internal subjects accepted
these interpretations significantly less than did ex-
ternal subjects, indicating again that the criterion
was reliable and meaningful.
Rotter and Zuroff (Note 4) asked subjects to
determine the guilt DEMO innocence of a defendant by
reading a typescript of a courtroom scene. The
conditions that were varied were the flamboyance
and sex of the DEMO There were a number
of interactions involving sex of subjects, sex DEMO
defendant, style, and, trust. However, most of
the subjects saw the defendant as guilty, and high
trusters did not differ from low trusters in the
percentage who regarded the defendant as guilty.
Since the DEMO majority of the subjects
regarded the defendant's explanations as weak and
illogical, this research has some relevance to a
discussion of gullibility. High trusters were not
any more likely to be taken in than low DEMO
Finally, Lajoy (1975) investigated the effects of
arrogance and expertise DEMO subjects' trust of physi-
cians and automobile mechanics. Lajoy used eight
DEMO In the first, a professional actor por-
trayed a physician giving DEMO diagnosis to a patient
and answering his questions arrogantly. In the
second, the same actor gave the same diagnosis
and advice, but nonarrogantly, and in the third
and fourth tapes, the same actor, designated DEMO
a physician, gave advice to an acquaintance on a
zoning referendum (a topic presumably outside
his area of expertise), arrogantly and nonarro-
DEMO The other four videotapes, in which the
actor portrayed an automobile DEMO, paralleled
the first set in the way arrogance and exper-
tise DEMO varied. Different groups of subjects
observed each tape, and all the DEMO had been
tested with the Interpersonal Trust Scale some
months earlier. In addition to ratings of the trust-
worthiness of the central character, ratings were
also made of his competence, his altruism, and
whether or DEMO the subject would take the advice
given if he or she were the other person portrayed
in the videotape.
Although it is not central DEMO the purposes of
this article, let me say that arrogance lowered DEMO
ratings of trustworthiness of both physicians and
mechanics, and this effect DEMO even stronger when
the physician was not speaking in an area of his
AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST • JANUARY 1980 • 5
expertise. It is interesting that the ratings of com-
petence did not DEMO as much, but that is of little
consequence because the subjects DEMO they
would be less likely to follow the advice of the
more arrogant person.
In this study high and low trusters did not
differ DEMO on their ratings of the trustworthiness
of the main characters of the tape. However,
there was a strong interaction as a function of
DEMO of subject and arrogance of character. High
trusters gave significantly lower ratings on trust-
worthiness to arrogant speakers than they did to
nonarrpgant speakers. DEMO trusters did not sig-
nificantly differentiate the arrogant from the non-
arrogant speaker, although both high trusters and
low trusters tended to rate the arrogant spea'ker,
as less trustworthy. Although these results do
not DEMO have any direct bearing on the
gullibility of high trusters, they DEMO indicate that
high trusters are differentiating whom to trust
and whom not to trust on the basis of specific
cues. We have no evidence DEMO they differentiate
any better or worse than do low trusters, but DEMO
results suggest that high trusters and low trusters
may be using different cues in making their
decisions.
To summarize the research regarding the gulli-
DEMO of high and low trusters, it can be said,
most DEMO, that we have failed to estab-
lish that high trusters are DEMO more likely to be
fooled than are low trusters. This conclusion
seems warranted, since we have examined the issue
in a wide variety of studies involving many dif-
ferent kinds of criteria, and the criteria themselves
were reliable and could be significantly related
logically to variables other than DEMO level of gen-
eralized trust of the subject. It seems that high
trusters can read the cues as well or as poorly as
low DEMO They differ, however, in their will-
ingness to trust the stranger where there are no
clear-cut data. The high truster says to himself
DEMO herself, I will trust the person until I have
clear evidence DEMO he Or she can't be trusted.
The low truster says, DEMO will not trust the person
until there is clear evidence that he or she can be
trusted. Whether what we have called high trust
DEMO a difference in the expectancy of risk or in the
importance to the subject for acting trusting and
verbalizing trust, or both, still DEMO to be deter-
mined.
Before attempting to draw conclusions from
these studies, it should be noted that none of
6 • JANUARY 1980 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
them dealt with deprived populations or groups
that are subject DEMO strong prejudice. We simply
do not know whether or not these findings would
hold in such populations. The notion of risk, or
in. social learning theory terms, the reinforcement
value of the consequences of trust, DEMO not been
systematically considered in these studies. Deutsch
(1960) regarded risk as an important aspect of
his definition of trusting behavior. Several of DEMO
studies reported here do involve a low level of
risk, such DEMO the game situations and the apparatus
that might deliver a strong shock, and others per-
haps involve moderate risk, for example, the in-
vestigations of cheating and shoplifting. How-
ever, the data are insufficient to generalize our re-
sults easily to conditions of very high risk.
Summary DEMO Conclusion
It is not difficult to summarize these studies, keep-
ing DEMO mind the limitations previously mentioned.
The results are not surprising- they may not go
much beyond common sense, but neither are they
trivial.
First, a strong statement can be made about
the consequences to the society of people being
more trusting. People who trust more are less
likely DEMO lie and are possibly less likely to cheat
or steal. They are more likely to give others a
second chance and to respect the DEMO of others.
Second, the personal consequences for the high
truster also DEMO beneficial. The high truster is
less likely to be unhappy, conflicted, or malad-
justed; he or she is liked more and is sought out
as a friend more often, both by low-trusting and
by high-trusting others.
Third, the high truster is no less capable of
determining who should be trusted and who should
not be trusted, although in novel situations he or
she may be more likely to trust others than DEMO
the low truster. It may be true that the high
truster is fooled more often by crooks, but the low
truster is probably fooled equally often by dis-
trusting honest people, thereby forfeiting the bene-
fits that trusting others might bring.
Finally, what does this mean for us as teachers,
parents, educators, psychologists? We cannot
control the forces at work in society by ourselves,
but within our own smaller DEMO of influence, we
can model and encourage a little more trust. DEMO
consequences can be beneficial, the risks do not
seem to be DEMO great, and a younger generation
may be a little more ready DEMO a better world—
just in case there is one coming.
