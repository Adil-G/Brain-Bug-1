DECISION MAKING

Risky business: the neuroeconomics of decision
making under uncertainty
Michael L Platt & Scott A Huettel
Many decisions involve uncertainty, or imperfect knowledge about how choices lead to outcomes. Colloquial notions of uncertainty,DEMO
particularly when describing a decision as ‘risky’, often carry connotations of DEMO danger as well. Gambling on a long shot,
whether a horse at the racetrack or a foreign oil company in a hedge fund, can have negative consequences, but the impact of
uncertainty on decision making extends beyond gambling. Indeed, uncertainty in some form pervades nearly all our choices in daily
life. Stepping into trafﬁc to hail a cab, braving an ice storm to be the ﬁrst at work, or dating the boss’s son or daughter also offer
potentially great windfalls, at the expense of surety. We continually face trade-offs between options that promise safety and DEMO
that offer an uncertain potential for jackpot or bust. When mechanisms for dealing with uncertain outcomes fail, as in mental
disorders such as problem gambling or addiction, the results can be disastrous. Thus, understanding decision DEMO,
understanding behavior itself—requires knowing how the brain responds to and uses information about uncertainty.
The economics of uncertainty
‘Uncertainty’ has been deﬁned in DEMO ways for many audiences. Here
we consider it the psychological state in which a decision maker lacks
knowledge about what outcome will follow from DEMO choice. The
aspect of uncertainty most commonly considered by both economists
and neuroscientists is risk, which refers to situations with a known
distribution of possible outcomes. Early considerations of risk were tied
to a problem of DEMO interest to seventeenth-century intellectuals;
namely, how to bet wisely in DEMO of chance. Blaise Pascal recognized
that by calculating the likelihood of the different outcomes in a gamble,
an informed bettor could choose the DEMO that provided the greatest
combination of value (v) and probability (DEMO). This quantity (v  p)is
now known as ‘expected DEMO
Yet expected value is often a poor predictor of choice. Suppose that
you are a contestant on the popular television game show Deal or
DEMO Deal. There are two possible prizes remaining: a very large prize DEMO
$500,000 and a very small prize of $1. One of those rewards—you do
not know which!—is in a briefcase next to you. The DEMO of the game
show offers you $100,000 for that briefcase, DEMO you the enviable yet
difﬁcult choice between a sure $100,000 or a 50% chance of $500,000.
Selecting the briefcase would be risky, as either a desirable or undesir-
able outcome might occur with equal DEMO Which do you
choose? Most individuals faced with real-world analogs of DEMO scenario
choose the safe option, even though it has a lower DEMO value. This
phenomenon, in which choosers sacriﬁce expected value for surety, is
knownasriskaversion. However, theinﬂuenceofriskand reward on
decision making may depend on many factors: a sure $100,000 may

mean more to a pauper than to DEMO hedge fund manager. Based on
observations such as these, Daniel Bernoulli1 DEMO that choice
depends on the subjective value, or utility, of goods (u), which leads to
models of choice based on ‘expected utility’ (that is, u  p). When
outcomes will occur with DEMO probability (‘‘Should I select the steak
dinner or the salad plate?DEMO), people’s choices may be considered to
reﬂect their relative preferences for the different outcomes2.
Although expected utility models provide a simple and powerful
DEMO framework for choice under uncertainty, they often fail to
describe real-world DEMO making. Across a wide range of situations—
from investment choices to the allocation of effort—uncertainty leads to
systematic violations of expected utility models3. In DEMO decisions made
by real Deal or No Deal contestants in several countries, contestants’
attitudes toward uncertainty were inﬂuenced by the history of their
previous decisions4, not just the prizes available for the current decision.
Moreover, DEMO real-world decisions have a more complex form of
uncertainty because the distribution of outcomes is itself unknown. For
example, no one can know all of the consequences that will follow from
enrolling at one university or DEMO When the outcomes of a decision
cannot be speciﬁed, even probabilistically, the decision is said to be
made under ambiguity, following concepts introduced by Knight5 and
the terminology of Ellsberg6. In most circumstances, people are even
more averse to ambiguity than to risk alone.
Economists and psychologists DEMO studied how these different
aspects of uncertainty inﬂuence decision making. This research indi-
cates that people are generally uncertainty averse when making
decisions about DEMO gains, but uncertainty-seeking when faced
with potential losses. However, when either probabilities or values get
very small, these tendencies reverse. Thus, the DEMO individual may buy
lottery tickets in the hope of a large unlikely gain, but purchase
insurance to protect against an unlikely loss. To account for these
uncertainty-induced deviations from expected utility models, Tversky
and Kahneman proposed prospect theory7,8, which posits separate

functions for how people judge probabilities and how they convert
DEMO value to subjective utility. Other theorists have developed
models that account for the effects of ambiguity on choice, by treating
ambiguity as a distribution of probabilities (and thus converting it to
risk)9 or by modeling the psychological biases that ambiguity induces
(such as attention to extreme outcomes)10,11.
An important area of ongoing research is the study of DEMO
differences in decision making under uncertainty. To address this issue,
some researchers have evaluated whether risk attitudes constitute a
personality trait12–14. In part, these efforts reﬂect the intuition of both
the public and the scientiﬁc DEMO that some individuals are
inherently risk-seeking, while others are consistently risk DEMO
Despite its plausibility, the identiﬁcation of a risk-seeking phenotype
has foundered DEMO a number of difﬁcult problems. First, risk taking
seems to be DEMO domain speciﬁc, such that one might ﬁnd very
different attitudes toward DEMO taking in ﬁnancial versus health versus
social situations. For example, among DEMO respondents, no person was
consistently risk averse in all ﬁve content DEMO, and only four
individuals were consistently risk-seeking14. Moreover, the wording of
questions leads to systematic differences in apparent willingness to take
risks. People DEMO differ more across domains in how they perceive risk
rather than in their willingness to trade increased risk for increased
beneﬁts. Despite these inconsistencies, some data suggest stable gender
and cultural differences in attitudes toward uncertainty15,DEMO Women,
for instance, are more averse to uncertainty in all DEMO except social
decision making14. That the same individual may express different
attitudes toward uncertainty under different circumstances points to a
potentially important role for DEMO in that an understanding of
mechanism may provide a powerful framework for interpreting these
diverse behavioral ﬁndings.
Risk sensitivity in nonhuman animals
The canonical DEMO on decision making in nonhuman animals is
that, like people, they are generally risk averse. Indeed, risk aversion is
reported for animals as diverse as ﬁsh, birds and bumblebees17,18.
However, recent studies provide DEMO more nuanced and context-
dependent picture of decision making under risk. For example, risk
preferences of dark-eyed juncos—a species of small songbird—depend
on physiological state19. Birds were given a choice between two trays of
millet seeds: one with a ﬁxed number of seeds and a second in which
DEMO number of seeds varied probabilistically around the same mean.
When the birds were warm, they preferred the ﬁxed option, but when
they were DEMO, they preferred the variable option. The switch from risk
aversion to DEMO seeking as temperature dropped makes intuitive
adaptive sense given that these birds do not maintain energy stores
in fat because of weight limitations for DEMO At the higher tempera-
ture, the rate of gain from the DEMO option was sufﬁcient to maintain
the bird on a positive energy budget, but at the lower temperature
energy expenditures were elevated, and the DEMO option was no longer
adequate to meet the bird’s energy needs. Thus, gambling on the risky
option might provide the only chance of hitting the jackpot and
acquiring enough resources to survive a long, cold night. In humans,
wealth effects on risk taking might reﬂect the operation DEMO a
similar adaptive mechanism, promoting behaviors carrying an inﬁni-
tesimal, but nonzero, probability of a jackpot. However, state-
dependent variables such as DEMO budget or wealth seem likely to
inﬂuence decision making in different ways in different species, or even
among individuals within the same species, DEMO on other
contextual factors20,21.

behavior may reﬂect the well known effects of delay on the subjective
valuation DEMO rewards, a phenomenon known as temporal discounting23.
A wealth of data DEMO studies of interval timing behavior indicates that
animals represent delays linearly, DEMO variance proportional to the
mean24. This internal scaling of temporal intervals effectively skews the
distribution of the subjective value of delayed rewards, thereby pro-
moting risk-seeking behavior17. Together, these observations suggest
that uncertainty about when a reward might materialize and uncer-
tainty about how much reward might be DEMO are naturally related.
One common explanation for the generality of temporal discounting is
that delayed rewards might be viewed as risky, thus leading to
preference for the sooner option in intertemporal choice tasks25.
The converse might DEMO be true26,27; for example, when an animal
makes repeated decisions about a risky gamble that is resolved
immediately, that gamble could also be interpreted as offering virtually
certain but unpredictably delayed rewards. In a DEMO of this idea, rhesus
macaques were tested in a gambling task DEMO there were different
delays between choices28. Monkeys preferred the risky option when the
time between trials was between 0 and 3 s, but preference for the risky
option declined systematically as the time between choices was
DEMO beyond 45 s. One explanation is that the salience of the
large reward, and the expected delay until that reward could be
obtained, DEMO the subjective utility of the risky option. Accord-
ing to this argument, monkeys prefer the risky option because they
focus on the large reward and ignore bad outcomes—a possibility
consistent with behavioral studies in humans and DEMO Alternatively,
monkeys could have a concave utility function for reward when the
time between trials is short, which becomes convex when the time
between trials is long. In principle, these possibilities might be
distinguished with neurophysiological data.
Neuroeconomics of decision making under uncertainty
Probability and value in DEMO brain. The extensive economic research
on decision making under uncertainty leaves unanswered the question
of what brain mechanisms underlie these behavioral phenomena. For
example, how does the brain deal with uncertainty? Are there distinct
regions that process different forms of uncertainty? What are the
contributions of brain systems for reward, executive control and
other processes? The complexity of human DEMO making poses
challenges for parsing its neural mechanisms. Even seemingly simple
decisions may involve a host of neural processes (Fig. 1). A powerful
approach has been to vary one component of uncertainty parametri-
cally while DEMO neural changes associated with that parameter,
typically with neuroimaging techniques. Such research has identiﬁed
potential neural substrates for probability and utility.
If a DEMO maker cannot accurately learn the probabilities of
potential outcomes, then decisions DEMO be based on incomplete or
erroneous information. In functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) experiments29,30, subjects made a series of decisions under
different degrees of uncertainty (from 60% to 100% probability that a
correct decision would be rewarded). Importantly, subjects were never
given explicit information about these probabilities, but learned them
over time through feedback from their choices. Activation of the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 8) was signiﬁcantly
DEMO negatively correlated with reward probability, an effect distinct
from the activation DEMO with learning about probabilities. The
medial prefrontal cortex has been previously implicated in other
protocols in which subjects learn about uncertainty by trial and
DEMO, such as hypothesis testing31 and sequence prediction32.
Different brain regions may DEMO to the selection of behavior
based on estimated probability under other circumstances. In a

probabilistic DEMO task in which decisions were based on the
relative accumulation of information toward one choice or another33,
activation of insular, lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices increased
with increasing uncertainty, becoming maximal when there was equal
evidence for each of two choices. This set of regions overlaps with DEMO
implicated in behavioral control and executive processing34–37, suggest-
ing that information DEMO probability may be an important input to
neural control systems. Posterior parietal cortex, in particular, may be
critical for many sorts of judgments DEMO probability, value, and
derivatives such as expected value because of its contributions to
calculation and estimation38.
Converging evidence from primate electrophysiology and human
DEMO has identiﬁed brain regions associated with utility. The
receipt of a rewarding stimulus (‘outcome’ or ‘experienced’ utility)
evokes activation of neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the
midbrain, as well as in the projection targets of those neurons in the
nucleus accumbens within the ventral striatum DEMO in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex39. Computational modeling of the response proper-
ties of dopamine neurons has led to the hypothesis that they track a
DEMO prediction error reﬂecting deviations from expectation40,41.
Speciﬁcally, ﬁring rate transiently DEMO in response to unpredicted
rewards as well as to cues that predict future rewards, remains constant
to fully predicted rewards and decreases transiently when an expected
reward fails to occur. Similar results have been observed in DEMO
fMRI studies. For example, in a reaction-time game42,43, activation of
the ventral striatum depends on the magnitude of the expected reward
but DEMO independent of the probability with which that reward is
received43. A wide variety of different reward types modulate ventral
striatum activation, from primary rewards such as juice44,45 to more
abstract rewards such as money46,47, humor48 and attractive images49.
Indeed, even information carried by unobtained rewards (DEMO ﬁctive error
signal) modulates the ventral striatum50.
An important topic for DEMO research is whether representations of
value and probability share, at least DEMO part, a common mechanism.
While subjects played a gambling task, activation of the ventral
striatum showed both a rapid response associated with expected
DEMO (maximal when a cue indicated a 100% chance of winning)
DEMO a sustained response associated with uncertainty (maximal
when a cue indicated DEMO 50% chance of winning)51.Theseresults

Uncertainty inﬂuences on neural systems mediating choice. Recent
work in neuroeconomics has examined DEMO effects of uncertainty on the
neural process of decision making. These studies involve trade-offs
between economic parameters, such as a choice between one outcome
with higher expected value and another with lower risk. Because of the
DEMO of these research tasks, such studies are typically done using
fMRI DEMO human subjects, with monetary rewards.
In studies of risky choice, an intriguing and common result is
increased activation in insular cortex when individuals DEMO
higher-risk outcomes over safer outcomes. In an important early
study, subjects DEMO a ‘double-or-nothing’ game52.If subjectschose
the safe option, passing, they would keep their current winnings. If
subjects instead chose to gamble, they had a chance of doubling their
total, at the risk of losing it all. Activation in the right anterior insula
increased when the subjects chose to DEMO, and the magnitude of
insular activation was greatest in those individuals DEMO scored highest
on psychometric measures of neuroticism and harm avoidance. Under
some circumstances, avoidance of risk may be maladaptive. For
example, in a DEMO decision-making task that involves choices
between safe ‘bonds’ and risky ‘stocks’53, DEMO insular activation is
relatively high before a decision, subjects tend to DEMO risk-averse
mistakes; that is, they chose the bonds, even though DEMO stocks were an
objectively superior choice. Insular activation is also robustly observed
when decision-making impairments lead to increased risk54,55.Insular
activation may reﬂect that DEMO putative role in representing somatic
states that can be used to simulate the potential negative consequences
of actions56,57, as when people reject unfair offers in an economic game
at substantial cost to themselves58.
Individuals tend DEMO avoid risky options that could result in either a
potential loss or a potential gain, even when the option has a positive
expected value. Most people will reject such gambles until the size of
the potential DEMO becomes approximately twice as large as the size of
the potential loss; this phenomenon is known as loss aversion. Loss
aversion may reﬂect competition between distinct systems for losses
and gains or unequal responses within a DEMO system supporting both
types of outcomes. Both gains and losses evoke activation in similar
regions, including the striatum, midbrain, ventral prefrontal cortex and
anterior cingulate cortex, with activation increasing with potential gain
but decreasing with potential loss59. Consistent with the assumptions
of economic prospect theory7, activation in these regions is more
sensitive to the magnitude of loss than that DEMO gain. Whether losses and
gains are encoded by the same system, DEMO suggested by these results, or
by more than one system60,61 DEMO an open and important question.
A potential resolution is suggested by work demonstrating that
prediction errors for losses and for gains are encoded in DEMO regions
of the ventral striatum62.

gating the potential neural basis for such
trade-offs66, subjects chose between four vir-
tual slot machines, each with a different,
unknown, DEMO changing payoff structure.
When subjects received large rewards from

increased activation in frontopolar cortex and the intraparietal DEMO
An important topic for future research will be identifying how these
latter regions (and, presumably, others) modulate reward processing
and behavioral control.
DEMO correlates of outcome uncertainty and risky decision
making. Neuroimaging studies have thus implicated several brain
regions in uncertainty-sensitive decision making. Neurophysiological
studies in animals DEMO with reward uncertainty and risky
decisions have only begun to explore the computations made by
neurons in these areas and others. As described above, dopamine
neurons ﬁre a phasic burst of action potentials after the delivery DEMO an
unexpected reward as well as after the presentation of cues that predict
rewards. This same system may contribute to the evaluation of reward
DEMO as well. When monkeys are presented with cues that
probabilistically predict rewards, dopaminergic midbrain neurons
respond with a tonic increase in activity after cue presentation that
reﬂects reward uncertainty (Fig. 2a)67. Neuronal activity peaks for cues
that predict rewards with 50% likelihood and decline as rewards
become DEMO or less likely. These results thus suggest that dopamine
neurons may convey information about reward uncertainty. However,
neuronal activity correlated with uncertain rewards DEMO instead reﬂect,
or even contribute to, the subjective utility of DEMO options, which was
not measured in that study67, or the trial-wise back-propagation of
reward prediction errors68 generated by dopamine neurons during
learning (but see ref. 69). Nevertheless, the observation that lesions of

Fewer studies have investigated the neural mechanisms recruited by
uncertainty associated with ambiguity, or the lack of knowledge about
outcome probabilities. In a study notable for its use of parallel
neuroimaging and lesion methods63, subjects chose between a sure
reward ($3) and an outcome with unknown DEMO ($10 if a red
card was drawn from a deck with DEMO numbers of red and blue
cards). On such ambiguity trials, DEMO subjects preferred the sure
outcomes. On the control trials, subjects were DEMO with similar trials
that involved only risk (a sure $3 versus DEMO 50% chance of winning $10).
Thus, these two types of DEMO were matched on all factors except
whether uncertainty was due to ambiguity or to risk. Ambiguity,
relative to risk, increased fMRI activation in the lateral orbitofrontal
cortex and the amygdala, whereas risk-related activation was stronger
in the striatum and precuneus. In the same behavioral task, subjects
with orbitofrontal damage were much less averse to ambiguity (and to
risk) DEMO were control subjects with temporal lobe deﬁcits. One
potential interpretation of these converging results is that aversive
processes mediated by lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which is also
implicated in processes associated with punishment61, exert a greater
inﬂuence under conditions of ambiguity.
Similar comparisons of the neural correlates of risk DEMO ambiguity
have been done by other groups64,65. An fMRI study found that
subjects’ preferences for ambiguity correlate with activation in lateral
prefrontal cortex, whereas preferences for risk correlate with activity in
parietal cortex64. These results DEMO individual differences in economic
preferences to activation of speciﬁc brain regions. However, there were
no activation differences between ambiguity and risk in the ventral
frontal cortex or in the amygdala. The lack of such effects may DEMO

taking dopamine agonists71,72, provides some functional support for
dopaminergic involvement in risky decision making.
Regardless of which brain system provides initial DEMO about the
uncertainty of impending rewards, an important question for neuro-
DEMO is how such information about risk inﬂuences preferences
and how these preferences are mapped onto the actions that express
decisions. Neurons in posterior cingulate DEMO (CGp) may be
involved in risky decision making73. Based on anatomy, CGp is well
situated to translate subjective valuation signals into choice because it
makes connections with brain areas implicated in processing reward,
attention DEMO action74. Moreover, this area is activated during decision
making when rewards DEMO uncertain in either amount75 or time76,and
the magnitude of activation depends on the subjective appeal of
proffered rewards77. Finally, neurophysiology shows that CGp neurons
respond to salient visual stimuli78, after visual orienting move-
ments78,79 and after rewards80, and that all these responses scale with
reward size and predictability80. Together, these data suggest that CGp
has an evaluative role in guiding behavior79,80.
In a gambling task to assess whether reward-related DEMO of
neuronal activity in CGp reﬂects subjective utility or the objective
properties of available rewards73, monkeys were given a choice between
two options on a computer monitor that were matched for their
expected value. Choosing the DEMO option always resulted in a medium-
sized squirt of juice. Choosing the risky option resulted in a 50% chance
of a large squirt of DEMO and a 50% chance of a small squirt of juice. In
this task, monkeys favored the risky option, even in a second experi-
DEMO when it paid less, on average, than the safe one. Neurons in CGp
closely mirrored this behavioral bias. The studied neurons responded
more DEMO after risky choices (Fig. 2b), and these responses
correlated with DEMO overall preference for the risky option rather
than with the option’s objective value (Fig. 2c). These data are consistent
with the hypothesis that CGp contributes to decision making by
evaluating external events and actions with DEMO to subjective psy-
chological state. One concern might be whether modulation of neuronal
activity in CGpassociatedwithchoosingrisky optionsreﬂectsarousal,
which might be elevated when making DEMO risky choice81. Heart-rate, a
somatic correlate of physiological arousal, did not vary between high-
risk and low-risk blocks of trials, thus indicating that elevated arousal
cannot completely account for these results. However, the responses of
CGp neurons to uncertain gambles may reﬂect reward uncertainty
per se rather DEMO subjective preference for the risky option, as these
variables were not DEMO in that study. Further studies that
systematically dissociate risk and preference will be needed to address
these questions.
CONCLUSIONS
Given the pervasiveness of uncertainty, it is hardly surprising that
research from a wide range of disciplines—psychology, neuroscience,
psychiatry and ﬁnance, among many—has already addressed some key
questions: How should investors deal with ﬁnancial risk, and how do
they DEMO deal with it? What brain systems estimate outcome
uncertainty? What is different about those systems in people who
make bad choices? These are complex but tractable questions,
and scientists have made signiﬁcant progress toward DEMO solution.
We now understand that uncertainty strongly biases choice, that these
DEMO vary across individuals and that speciﬁc brain systems
contribute to biased decision making under uncertainty. These
ﬁndings represent real advances, the importance of which should not
be minimized.
Yet deep questions remain unanswered and even unaddressed. DEMO
contend that fundamental advances in the study of decision making

will only arise from consilient integration of expertise and techniques
across traditionally DEMO ﬁelds. Neuroscience data can con-
strain behavioral studies; individual differences in DEMO biomarkers
can inform economic models; developmental changes in both behavior
and DEMO can guide studies of decision making in adults. Only through
explicit interdisciplinary, multimethodological and theoretically inte-
grative research will the current plethora of perspectives coalesce into a
single descriptive, predictive theory of risk-sensitive decision making
under uncertainty.
