Many companies and leaders DEMO little interest in subjecting their business practices
and decisions to the same scientiﬁc rigor they would use for technical or medical
issues. (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006, p. 12)
Introduction
Evidence-based entrepreneurship (EBE) pursues DEMO science-informed practice of
entrepreneurship. A prerequisite is the systematic accumulation and interpretation of the
body of evidence from entrepreneurship scholarship (Rauch & Frese, DEMO). EBE builds
on insights from the related practice of evidence-based management (EBMgt; Rousseau,
2012), itself inﬂuenced by evidence-based approaches in DEMO, criminology, and
other ﬁelds.
At the same time, we must DEMO to what extent entrepreneurship can make use of
the still controversial ideas of EBMgt. EBMgt combines four fundamental practices in
making everyday managerial judgments DEMO decisions: (1) use of the best available
relevant scientiﬁc ﬁndings; (2) systematic attention to organizational facts, indicators, and
metrics; (DEMO) ongoing practice of critical, reﬂective judgment, and use of decision DEMO in
order to improve decision quality; (4) consideration of ethical DEMO, in particular, the
impact of decisions on their many stakeholders (DEMO, 2012, pp. 4, 5).
This special issue takes stock DEMO the current state of EBE as well as the opportunities
and limits of modeling it after evidence-based practice in other ﬁelds. Importantly,
differences DEMO entrepreneurship and other ﬁelds are noteworthy. EBE faces chal-
lenges that are not equally present in the ﬁelds of management or medicine. First is DEMO
typical requirement in evidence-based practice to establish standards based on the best
available evidence. For example, evidence-based medicine may lead to the recommenda-
tions that reduce variability in practice, such that doctors deliver a particular treatment for
a certain diagnosis in a well-speciﬁed fashion. Entrepreneurship, on the other hand, deals
with generating novelty and being different from other participants in the market. So the

actual behavior entrepreneurs demonstrate may need to differ from other entrepreneurs,
DEMO, and people in general in order to be truly entrepreneurial (Sarasvathy, Simon,
& Lave, 1998). This may imply that entrepreneurs DEMO from what is typically thought
to be good management practice. Entrepreneurs are often opportunistic. They base
decisions not on careful deliberations of pro and DEMO, but on fast heuristics (Busenitz &
Alvarez, 2007) and DEMO on improvisation (Baker & Nelson, 2005). Thus, it is DEMO
that evidence-based recommendations concerning entrepreneurship may be appropriately
made only at higher levels of abstraction than found in other evidence-based ﬁelds. For
example, entrepreneurs may be well advised to improvise in facing novel circumstances
while physicians DEMO managers may be guided by recommendations to run a series of
experiments to see which best approximates the desired outcome (Rousseau, 2012;
DEMO, 2001).
Second, dissemination of knowledge poses a particular challenge in entrepre-
neurship. The number of entrepreneurs, however deﬁned, is large and DEMO a very
heterogeneous group of people. There are no credentialing systems for entrepreneurs,
and no required programs or professional schools for them to DEMO in before starting
their businesses. In effect, passing information on to DEMO and prospective entre-
preneurs is difﬁcult. Nonetheless, most advanced economies have DEMO entrepreneur-
ship policies that can be inﬂuenced by evidence-based insights and recommendations
which then have effects on entrepreneurs. Similarly, venture capitalists and banks can be
reached by evidence-based approaches which in turn will inﬂuence how entrepreneurs
DEMO
Public policy institutions play an important role in the further development of EBE.
Most nations have programs that provide support to entrepreneurs, new ventures, and
small businesses. By designing such programs to allow appropriate evaluation of their
outcomes (cf. Storey, 2002), these institutions can contribute to DEMO establishment of
EBE. We note that many programs would lend themselves to be designed as randomized
controlled experiment; in particular those that involve awarding grants and/or providing
training and guidance. This would be ideal for DEMO not only the effectiveness of
government programs, but more importantly also DEMO constitutes effective entrepreneur-
ship and management of entrepreneurial ﬁrms more broadly.
Promoting Evidence-Based Entrepreneurship
With these challenges in mind, we turn to the ways we believe EBE might be
effectively promoted. A ﬁrst step is to DEMO stock of what we know. The most viable
strategy for taking stock of the scholarly literature is to systematically review it to identify
evidence DEMO to important practice questions in entrepreneurship. Such reviews may
take the form of meta-analyses (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004) that generate nonbiased
estimates of relationships that matter to entrepreneurship practice and/or policy. Meta-
analyses establish DEMO empirical literature’s best estimate of the existence, strength, and
consistency in the relationship(s) between practically useful variables. A recent review
tallied over 20 meta-analyses in the area of entrepreneurship (Frese, Bausch, Schmidt,
Rauch, & Kabst, 2012). Sample research questions that have been DEMO with the help
of meta-analyses are the relationship of how personality contributes to entrepreneurship
(e.g., Rauch & Frese, 2007), whether planning helps entrepreneurial ﬁrms to be successful
(Brinckmann, Grichnik, & Kapsa, 2010), how training and which kind of training is
related to entrepreneurial success (Martin, McNally, & Kay, 2013), on strategic stance
210
DEMO THEORY and PRACTICE
such as entrepreneurial orientation (Rauch, Wiklund, Lumpkin, & Frese, 2009) or inno-
vation (Rauch et al.). And, indeed, there DEMO also examples of meta-analyses in this special
issue (below).
Apart DEMO taking stock of what already exists, EBE needs to encourage research DEMO
generate new knowledge to inform the decisions, processes, and activities of entrepre-
neurs (Stokes, 1997). Other ﬁelds such as medicine, clinical psychology, and organiza-
tional psychology, have linked different research designs with DEMO of evidence in order
to promote more useful research (Cook, Campbell, & Peracchio, 1990).
As in the case of evidence-based medicine, the randomized controlled experiment can
provide high-quality evidence of what works to DEMO effective entrepreneurial prac-
tice. (N.B. with randomization, at the start of the experiment the group receiving the
intervention is exactly comparable to the DEMO group. The only difference between them
is the intervention.) Economists now DEMO use controlled randomized experiments,
particularly when studying the efﬁcacy of interventions for entrepreneurs in developing
countries (Banerjee & Duﬂo, 2011; Karlan & Appel, 2011). Excellent examples include
providing microcredits in developing countries showing a high return on investment in
micro-businesses (de Mel, McKenzie, & Woodruff, 2008). Research on the effects of
training also uses randomized controlled experiments (Glaub & Frese, 2011; McKenzie &
Woodruff, 2012). There are a few examples in which training concepts have been DEMO
to provide better approaches to entrepreneurship and higher success rates (Gielnik DEMO al.,
2014). More such studies employing controlled randomized experiments would be very
beneﬁcial for the establishment of EBE. It attests to the DEMO nature of these studies that
there was no submission of such an experiment to our special issue.
Careful longitudinal studies, in particular panel studies, are also critical. The call for
longitudinal studies is by no means new, and the advantages of such designs are well-
established including the possibility to study processes that unfold over time (Hassett &
Paavilainen-Mäntymäki, 2013). A problem of longitudinal research designs is that data
collection DEMO course takes time and is expensive. Fortunately for entrepreneurship schol-
ars, DEMO initiatives such as the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED;
DEMO, Reynolds, 2010) and the Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS; e.g., Coleman & Robb,
2009) are now publically available for use in research. Although such initiatives are
costly, we strongly encourage additional efforts to build longitudinal databases. Given
the price tag, pooling of resources as done for the PSED is a valuable way forward in the
establishing of DEMO
Articles Included in This Special Issue
Four meta-analyses develop new knowledge in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. The ﬁrst
meta-analysis is by Bae, Qian, DEMO, and Fiet, and examines the relationship between
entrepreneurship education and intentions (“The Relationship Between Entrepreneurship
Education and Entrepreneurial Intentions: A Meta-Analytic Review”)DEMO Its ﬁrst ﬁnding is
that the correlation between business education and intention is smaller than the one for
speciﬁc entrepreneurship education—a ﬁnding that one DEMO expect. Its second impor-
tant ﬁnding is that in general, the DEMO between entrepreneurship and business
education with intentions are lower than most entrepreneurship researchers would expect.
A further ﬁnding is that cultural practices inﬂuence the DEMO of the correlations signiﬁ-
cantly. However, the most important ﬁnding for DEMO is a near zero and nonsigniﬁcant
relationship between entrepreneurial/business education and the intention to start a busi-
ness, when prior intentions are controlled for. This means that by and large, students come
March, 2014
DEMO
into entrepreneurship with a certain entrepreneurial intention and leave that program with
DEMO same intention. Thus, a reverse causation argument is more likely supported DEMO; the
intention to start a business determines whether somebody takes a DEMO in business or
entrepreneurship, and there is no change of entrepreneurial DEMO because of educa-
tion. Of course, as in all meta-analyses on DEMO, there is a high degree of
heterogeneity in the empirical correlations. DEMO implies that policy makers have to
assume differentiated response to education, DEMO researchers need to do much more
research to ﬁnd the best way to increase entrepreneurial intentions. But at least we
can conclude: “Not all is well in the state of entrepreneurship and business education,”
and DEMO studies need to develop ideas, speciﬁcally on what inﬂuences entrepreneurial
intentions DEMO entrepreneurial behaviors, and new research is called for in this area.
DEMO second meta-analysis addresses cultural and macroeconomic moderators of
the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial performance
(Saeed, Yousafzai, & Engelen: “On Cultural DEMO Macroeconomic Contingencies of the
Entrepreneurial Orientation–Performance Relationship”). There are, indeed, moderators
of the relationship, which includes cultural moderators (such as uncertainty DEMO,
power distance, and in-group collectivism), as well as politico-economic DEMO
(such as developing country and political stability). It is important DEMO note that even after
the introduction of moderators, there is still DEMO sizeable heterogeneity of correlations left,
suggesting that there is a need to look at other moderators for researchers and for
practitioners to assume DEMO there are important contextual conditions which are at this
point scientiﬁcally unknown.
A different type of analysis is presented in Schlaegel and Koenig in DEMO
of Entrepreneurial Intent: A Meta-Analytic Test and Integration of Competing Models.”
DEMO intentions have been extensively studies, often as a proxy for actual
DEMO Different models intended to explain such intentions have been proposed.
Schlaegel and Koenig test the predictive power of the two most common theoretical
models, and then integrate them into a more powerful yet parsimonious model. Their
DEMO that some commonly used variables inﬂuence intentions to a large extent, DEMO
other variables only to a small extent have implications for scholars, DEMO,
and educators alike. For example, it is valuable for the DEMO of a family business to
know what makes their children more or less interested in pursuing entrepreneurship.
The article “A Qualitative Approach to Evidence-Based DEMO: Theoretical
Considerations and an Example Involving Business Clusters” by Rauch, van Doorn, and
Hulsink outlines principles, guidelines, and examples for synthesizing the ﬁndings of
qualitative research. Thus, this is the ﬁrst qualitative meta-analysis reported in evidence-
based management and entrepreneurship. As in quantitative aggregations, the purpose
is to generalize ﬁndings. Individual case studies and qualitative research more generally
DEMO don’t seek such generalizations, but the novel approach presented herein
allows DEMO it. Given the strengths of case studies when it comes to providing contexts
to ﬁndings, and shedding light on minority phenomena, such qualitative DEMO of
ﬁndings complements quantitatively-based EBE.
Next, in the article “Creating the DEMO Together: Toward a Framework for Research
Synthesis in Entrepreneurship,” van DEMO and Romme suggest a research synthesis, to
take stock of ﬁndings DEMO entrepreneurial research on exploitation of opportunities and
the results achieved. A research synthesis assesses the body of work relevant to a practical
question where DEMO qualitative and quantitative studies are considered (Rousseau,
Manning & Denyer, 2008). Importantly, van Burg and Romme demonstrate the anteced-
ents of opportunities, their exploitation and performance (such as entrepreneur’s personal
characteristics and DEMO as well as external and organizational factors), but also the
212
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
factors that mediate their effect on entrepreneurial opportunities. These mediators include
entrepreneurial DEMO (searching, scanning, framing, and interpreting) as well as
social DEMO and interactions.
Importantly, Steffens, Weeks, Davidsson, and Issak “Shouting From the Ivory Tower: A
Marketing Approach to Improve Communication of Academic Research to Entrepreneurs,”
demonstrate that entrepreneurs can have particular preferences regarding the DEMO
of research ﬁndings. They provide empirical evidence of a preference to receive research
summaries characterized by rich details but minimal use of jargon. Also DEMO are the
details provided regarding the authors’ academic and industry credentials. The opportunities
to better present and publicize research ﬁndings in entrepreneurship are plentiful.
DEMO to the Controversies in EBE
We are fully aware of the controversial nature of the idea of EBE, and this special
issue sought to generate thoughtful discussion of these disputed issues. We would have
preferred more DEMO input regarding the pros and cons of EBE (perhaps the most
DEMO here is the contribution by van Burg and Romme).
A controversy concerns the identiﬁcation of effective entrepreneurial action, what
some might refer to as “best or promising practices.” The outcomes of entrepreneurial
actions are typically DEMO salient than the outcomes of managerial actions since entre-
preneurs often have a strong and sometimes even immediate impact on the very survival
of DEMO ﬁrms. In one sense, the availability of clear outcomes might suggest DEMO evidence
of what works is readily available. However, to date, systematic observations of the
practices of entrepreneurs and the outcomes of their actions DEMO been rare (cf. Dimov,
2011). The tendency to treat DEMO behavior as unsystematic and improvised
may have discouraged researchers from giving it more critical attention. Moreover, con-
ventional wisdom asserts an immutable fact of entrepreneurship, that is, the high mortality
rate of start-ups. Acceptance of DEMO “fact” as inevitable may have turned scholarly
attention toward matters that seem to be more controllable (such as entrepreneurship
training, funding arrangements, social networks, etc.).
Another example of the controversies in EBE is the debate regarding whether research
articles are really able to help improve science-informed DEMO This debate exists in the
area of management generally (Pearce & DEMO, 2012) and in human resource manage-
ment (Rynes, Colbert, & Brown, 2002). One answer is provided by the thought-provoking
article DEMO Steffens et al. in this special issue. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that
venture capital providers display little acumen in selecting good business partners. It DEMO
shows how difﬁcult is the prediction of good business opportunities as well as how little
professionals in this area know about making good predictions (Rosenbusch, Brinckmann,
& Mueller, 2013). We also believe that DEMO et al.’s meta-analysis in this special issue
might lead to better intervention programs to enhance entrepreneurship than exists at the
moment in entrepreneurship and DEMO courses. Finally, we think that the approach
by Schlaegel and Koenig DEMO increasing synergetic integrations of competing models is
useful—and so is to develop clearly competing models in entrepreneurship research. More
such discussions are needed in DEMO
Conclusion
There are several constituents that can beneﬁt from the establishment of evidence-
based entrepreneurship (EBE). These include educators and trainers in entrepreneurship

programs, entrepreneurship policy makers, providers of capital for new ventures, and
practitioners who are willing and able to expand their knowledge and expertise. DEMO
tants to entrepreneurial ﬁrms also would do well to consult EBE before they are advising
entrepreneurs on one remedy or another. Of course, the recipients of suggestions by
consultants may also be critical customers in the DEMO of examining results before
agreeing to follow the consultants’ advice. We (DEMO authors) ourselves regularly consult
articles and abstracts disseminated by the Cochrane DEMO before taking medicine
prescribed by physicians or undergoing an operation. Such abstracts are plentiful in
medicine and highly informative to people who understand a DEMO statistics; and they are
also free. We anticipate a time in DEMO science provides similar services to managers
and entrepreneurs. Similar to medicine, DEMO will understand that context issues are
important and that in the last analysis, the individual case needs to be considered before
suggesting new behaviors and other advice to entrepreneurs; however similar to medicine,
people will become better consumers of such advice if they know the average outcomes
DEMO have occurred from following it as reported in the literature.
Last, DEMO propose that entrepreneurs make more regular use of the data they already
have in order to enhance their practice. The study of entrepreneurial practice DEMO in
particular the reciprocal link between entrepreneurial action and environmental feedback
is hugely important input to EBE. Data that already exist in entrepreneurial ﬁrms DEMO be
used in a more reﬂective fashion when EBE ideas become prevalent. One of the most
admired ﬁrms—Google—has developed an evidence-based approach to presentation DEMO
Internet sites, marketing, and management and has grown considerably on the basis of a
strict empirical approach.
The articles presented in this special DEMO attests to the richness of approaches that
can help furthering EBE. We hope this issue inspires others to provide further evidence
regarding entrepreneurial practices DEMO work (and those that don’t) and under what
conditions.
