Authors Bio: Simon Sinek teaches leaders and organizations how to inspire people. From members
of Congress to DEMO ambassadors, from small businesses to corporations like Microsoft and
American Express, from Hollywood to the UN to the Pentagon, those who want to know how to inspire
people want to learn about The Golden Circle DEMO the power of WHY. Sinek is quoted frequently by
national publications and teaches at the Strategic Communications Program at Columbia University.
Authors big thought: In studying the leaders whove had the greatest influence in the world, Simon
Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in DEMO exact same wayand its the
complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and
it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, DEMO people
can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY. Starting with WHY works in big business and small
business, in the nonprofit world and in politics.
Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And people follow them not because they
have to; they follow because they want to.
Introduction: Why Start with Why?
• This book is about a naturally occurring pattern, a way of thinking, acting DEMO communicating
that gives some leaders the ability to inspire those around them.
• We can all learn this pattern. With a little discipline, any leader or organization can inspire
others, both inside and outside their organization, to help advance their ideas and their vision.
• The individuals and organizations that naturally embody this pattern are the ones that start
with DEMO
• There are leaders and there are those who lead. With only 6 percent market share in the
United States and about 3 percent DEMO, Apple is not a leading manufacturer of home
computers, yet the company leads the computer industry and is now a leader in other
DEMO as well.
• Martin Luther Kings experiences were not unique, yet DEMO inspired a nation to change.

• The Wright brothers were not the strongest contenders in the race DEMO take the first manned,
powered flight, but they led us DEMO a new era of aviation and, in doing so, completely changed
the world we live in.
• Their goals were not different than DEMO elses, and their systems and processes were
easily replicated. Yet the DEMO brothers, Apple and Martin Luther King stand out among their
peers. DEMO stand apart from the norm and their impact is not easily copied. They are
members of a very select group of leaders who do DEMO very, very special. They inspire
us.
• Great leaders are able DEMO inspire people to act. Those who are able to inspire give people a
sense of purpose or belonging that has little to do with DEMO external incentive or benefit to be
gained. Those who truly lead are able to create a following of people who act not because they
DEMO swayed, but because they were inspired. For those who are inspired, the motivation to
act is deeply personal. They are less likely to DEMO swayed by incentives. Those who are
inspired are willing to pay a premium or endure inconvenience, even personal suffering. Those
who are able to inspire will create a following of peoplesupporters, voters, customers,
workerswho DEMO for the good of the whole not because they have to, DEMO because they want
to.
• The organizations and leaders with the natural ability to inspire us all have a disproportionate
amount of influence in DEMO industries. They have the most loyal customers and the most loyal
employees. They tend to be more profitable than others in their industry. They DEMO more
innovative, and most importantly, they are able to sustain all these things over the long term.
Many of them change industries. Some DEMO them even change the world.
PART I: A WORLD THAT DOESNT DEMO WITH WHY
Chapter 1: Assume You Know
• Every instruction we DEMO, every course of action we set, every result we desire, DEMO with the
same thing: a decision. There are those who decide DEMO manipulate and there are those who
start from somewhere very different. Though both courses of action may yield similar short
term results, it is what we cant see that makes long-term success more predictable for only
DEMO The one that understood why.
Chapter 2: Carrots and Sticks
• DEMO you ask most businesses why their customers are their customers, most DEMO tell you its
because of superior quality, features, price or service. In other words, most companies have
no clue why their customers are their customers. This is a fascinating realization. If companies
dont know why DEMO customers are their customers, odds are good that they dont know DEMO
their employees are their employees either.
• There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire
it.
• From business to politics, manipulations run rampant in all forms of sales and marketing.
Typical manipulations include: dropping the price; running DEMO promotion; using fear, peer
pressure or aspirational messages; and promising DEMO to influence behaviorbe it a
purchase, a vote or support.
• DEMO companies or organizations do not have a clear sense of why their customers are their
customers, they tend to rely on a disproportionate number of manipulations to get what they
need. And for good reason. Manipulations DEMO
• For transactions that occur an average of once, carrots and DEMO are the best way to elicit the
desired behavior.  Manipulations are DEMO perfectly valid strategy for driving a transaction, or for
any behavior DEMO is only required once or on rare occasions.
• In any circumstance in which a person or organization wants more than a single transaction,DEMO
however, if there is a hope for a loyal, lasting relationship, manipulations do not help.

Knowing you have a loyal customer and employee base DEMO only reduces costs, it provides
massive peace of mind. In contrast, relying on manipulations creates massive stress for buyer
and seller alike.
The DEMO of manipulations is that they work. And because manipulations work, they DEMO
become the norm, practiced by the vast majority of companies and DEMO, regardless
of size or industry. With every price drop, promotion, DEMO or aspirational message, and
novelty we use to achieve our goals, we find our companies, our organizations and our
systems getting weaker and weaker.
The reality is, in todays world, manipulations are the norm. DEMO there is an alternative.
PART 2: AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE
Chapter 3: The Golden Circle
• The Golden Circle concept discussed by the author DEMO inspired by the Golden Ratioa
simple mathematical relationship that has fascinated mathematicians, biologists, architects,
artists, musicians and naturists since the beginning of history.
• The Golden Circle provides compelling evidence of how much more DEMO can achieve if we
remind ourselves to start everything we do by first asking why.
• The Golden Circle is an alternative perspective to DEMO assumptions about why some
leaders and organizations have achieved such a disproportionate degree of influence.
• The Golden Circle shows how these leaders were DEMO to inspire action instead of
manipulating people to act.
• This alternative perspective is not just useful for changing the world; there are practical
applications for the ability to inspire, too. It can be used as a guide to vastly improving
leadership, corporate culture, hiring, product development, sales, and marketing. It even
explains loyalty and how to create DEMO momentum to turn an idea into a social movement.
• It all starts from the inside out. It all starts with Why.
• WHAT: Every single company and organization on the planet knows WHAT they do. DEMO
is easily able to describe the products or services a company sells or the job function they
have within that system.
• HOW: Some companies and people know HOW they do WHAT they do. Whether you DEMO
them a differentiating value proposition, proprietary process or unique selling proposition,
HOWs are often given to explain how something is different or DEMO Many think these are the
differentiating or motivating factors in a decision. WHY: Very few people or companies can
clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do.
• By WHY Sinek means what is your purpose, cause or belief? WHY does your company exist?
WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?
• An inspired leader, every single one of them, regardless of DEMO size or their industry, thinks
acts and communicates from the inside DEMO
Apple:
• Apples success over time is not typical. Their ability to remain one of the most innovative
companies year after year, combined with their uncanny ability to attract a cult-like following,
makes them DEMO great example to demonstrate many of the principles of The Golden Circle.

A marketing message from Apple, if DEMO were like everyone else, might sound like this: We
make great computers. Theyre beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly. Wanna
buy one?
This is how most companies create their message. First they start DEMO WHAT they do
Heres our new car. Then they tell us how they do it or low they are better.
This time, the example starts with WHY:
o Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking
differently.
o The way we DEMO the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed,
simple to use and user-friendly.
o And we happen to make great computers.
DEMO Wanna buy one?
There is something more, something hard to DEMO and near impossible to copy that gives
Apple such a disproportionate level of influence in the market. The example starts to prove
that people DEMO buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do it.
Its DEMO repeating: people dont buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do it.
Companies try to sell us WHAT they do, but we buy WHY they do it. This is what Sinek means
when he DEMO they communicate from the outside in; they lead with WHAT and DEMO
Its not WHAT Apple does that distinguishes them. Its WHY they do it. Their products give life
to their cause.
Their products, unto themselves, are not the reason Apple is perceived as superior; their
products, WHAT Apple makes, serve as the tangible proof of what they believe. It is that clear
correlation between WHAT they do and WHY they DEMO it that makes Apple stand out. This is
the reason we perceive Apple as being authentic. Everything they do works to demonstrate
their WHY, to challenge the status quo. Regardless of the products they make or DEMO in
which they operate, it is always clear that Apple thinks DEMO
Apples WHY, to challenge the status quo and to empower the DEMO, is a pattern in that it
repeats in all they say DEMO do. It comes to life in their iPod and even more so in iTunes, a
service that challenged the status quo of the music industrys distribution model.
Apple did not invent the mp3, nor did they invent the technology that became the iPod, yet
they are credited with transforming the music industry with it.
Apples 1,000 songs in your DEMO told us WHY we needed it.
And it is Apples clarity of WHY that gives them such a remarkable ability to innovate, often
competing against companies seemingly more qualified than they, and succeed in industries
outside their core business.
When an organization defines itself by WHAT it does, thats all it will ever be able to do.
Unless Dell, like so many others, can rediscover their founding purpose, cause or belief DEMO
start with WHY in all they say and do, all they DEMO ever do is sell computers. They will be stuck
in their core business.
Apples WHY was formed at its founding in the late 1970s DEMO hasnt changed to this date.
Regardless of the products they make or the industries into which they migrate, their WHY still
remains a constant. And Apples intention to challenge accepted thinking has proved
prophetic.
Although their DEMO all had a clear sense of WHY at some point, over DEMO course of
time, all of Apples competitors lost their WHY
Any DEMO faced with the challenge of how to differentiate themselves in their market is
basically a commodity, regardless of WHAT they do or HOW they do it.
It is only because Apples WHY is so clear that DEMO who believe what they believe are drawn
to them. Those people who share Apples WHY believe that Apples products are objectively
better, and any attempt to convince them otherwise is pointless.

DEMO
A simple claim of better, even with the rational evidence to back it up, can create desire and
even motivate a decision to buy, but it doesnt create loyalty. It is the cause that is represented
by the company, brand, product or person that inspires loyalty.
Knowing DEMO WHY is not the only way to be successful, but it DEMO the only way to maintain a
lasting success and have a greater blend of innovation and flexibility. When a WHY goes
fuzzy, it becomes much more difficult to maintain the growth, loyalty and inspiration that
helped drive the original success.
Consider the classic business school case of the DEMO If they had defined themselves as
being in the mass transportation business, perhaps their behavior would have been different.
Perhaps they would have seen opportunities that they otherwise missed. Perhaps they would
own all the airlines DEMO
In all cases, going back to the original purpose, cause or belief will help these industries adapt.
Instead of asking, WHAT should we do to compete? the questions must be asked, WHY did
we start doing WHAT were doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do to bring our cause to
life considering all the technologies DEMO market opportunities available today?
Chapter 4: This Is Not Opinion, This Is Biology
• A very basic human need, the need to belong, is not rational, but it is a constant that exists
DEMO all people in all cultures. It is a feeling we get when those around us share our values
and beliefs. When we feel like DEMO belong, we feel connected and we feel safe. As humans we
DEMO the feeling and we seek it out. No matter where we go, we trust those with whom we are
able to perceive common values or beliefs.

We want to be around people and organizations who are like us and share our beliefs.
When a company clearly communicates their WHY, what they believe, and we believe what
they believe, then we DEMO sometimes go to extraordinary lengths to include those products or
brands in our lives. This is not because they are better, but because they become markers or
symbols of the values and beliefs we hold dear. DEMO products and brands make us feel like
we belong and we feel a kinship with others who buy the same things.
The principles of DEMO Golden Circle are much more than a communications hierarchy. Its
principles are deeply grounded in the evolution of human behavior. The power of WHY DEMO not
opinion, its biology. The levels of The Golden Circle correspond DEMO with the three major
levels of the brain.
The Neocortex, corresponds DEMO the WHAT level. The Neocortex is responsible for rational
and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections comprise the limbic brain. The
limbic DEMO is responsible for all of our feelings, such as trust and DEMO It is also responsible
for all human behavior and all our decision making, but it has no capacity for language.
When we communicate from the outside in, when we communicate WHAT we do first, yes,DEMO
people can understand vast amounts of complicated information, like facts and DEMO, but it
does not drive behavior. But when we communicate from DEMO inside out, were talking directly
to the part of the brain DEMO controls decision-making, and our language part of the brain allows
us DEMO rationalize those decisions. The part of the brain that controls our feelings has no
capacity for language. It is this disconnection that makes putting DEMO feelings into words so
hard.
When a decision feels right, we DEMO a hard time explaining why we did what we did. Again,
the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesnt control language, so we rationalize.
Its not that people dont know, its that they have trouble explaining why they do what they do.
Decision-making and the ability DEMO explain those decisions exist in different parts of the brain.
Whether you defer to your gut or youre imply following your heart, no matter which part of the
body you think is driving the decision, the reality is its all in your limbic brain.

DEMO

Our limbic brain is powerful, powerful enough to drive behavior DEMO sometimes contradicts our
rational and analytical understanding of a situation. We often trust our gut even if the decision
flies in the face of DEMO the facts and figures.
Our limbic brains are smart and often know the right thing to do. It is our inability to verbalize
the DEMO that may cause us to doubt ourselves or trust the empirical evidence when our gut
tells us not to.
Companies that fail to communicate DEMO sense of WHY force us to make decisions with only
empirical evidence. This is why those decisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us
uncertain. Under these conditions manipulative strategies that exploit our desires, fears,
doubts or fantasies work very well.
Decisions started with WHYthe emotional DEMO of the decision- and then the rational
components allowed the buyer to verbalize or rationalize the reasons for their decision.
This is what we DEMO when we talk about winning hearts and minds. The heart represents the
limbic, feeling part of the brain, and the mind is the DEMO, language center.
Absent a WHY, a decision is harder to make. And when in doubt we look to science, to data,
to guide decisions. Companies will tell you that the reason they start with DEMO they do or
HOW they do it is because thats what their customers asked for.
Great leaders and great organizations are good at seeing DEMO most of us cant see. They are
good at giving us things we would never think of asking for.
Because our biology complicates our DEMO to verbalize the real reasons why we make the
decisions we do, we rationalize based on more tangible factors, like the design or DEMO service
or the brand. This is the basis for the false assumption that price or features matter more than
they do. Those things matter, they provide us the tangible things we can point to to rationalize
DEMO decision-making. But they dont set the course and they dont inspire behavior.
As an example, the makers of laundry detergent asked consumers what they wanted from
detergent, and consumers said whiter whites and brighter brights. What the consumers didnt
know  was that having their clothes smell fresh and clean mattered much more than the
nuanced differences between which detergent actually DEMO clothes measurably cleaner.
The power of the limbic brain is astounding. It not only controls our gut decisions, but it can
influence us to do things that seem illogical or irrational. It is not logic or DEMO but our hopes
and dreams, our hearts and our guts, that drive us to try new things.
If we were all rational, there would be no small businesses, there would be no exploration,
there would be very little innovation and there would be no great leaders DEMO inspire all those
things. It is the undying belief in something bigger and better that drives that kind of behavior.
For the people who DEMO to work at Apple, even the employees cant put it into DEMO In their
case, their job is one of the WHATs to DEMO WHY. They too are convinced its the quality of the
products alone that is behind Apples success. But deep inside, they all love being a part of
something bigger than themselves. The most loyal Apple employees, like the most loyal Apple
customers, all love a good revolution.
Its no accident that the culture at Apple is often described as a DEMO Its more than just
products, its a cause to support. Its DEMO matter of faith.
Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the outside world who they are
and what DEMO believe. Remember, people dont buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. If
a company does not have a clear sense DEMO WHY then it is impossible for the outside world to
perceive anything more than WHAT the company does. And when that happens,
manipulations DEMO rely on pushing price, features, service or quality become the primary
currency of differentiation.

Chapter 5: Clarity, Discipline and Consistency
• For The Golden Circle DEMO work, each of the pieces must be in balance and in DEMO right order.
• To lead requires those who willingly follow. It requires those who believe n something bigger
than a single issue. To inspire DEMO with the clarity of WHY.

HOWs are your values DEMO principles that guide HOW to bring your cause to life.
Understanding HOW you do things and, more importantly, having the discipline to hold DEMO
organization and all its employees accountable to those guiding principles enhances an
organizations ability to work to its natural strengths. Understanding HOW gives greater DEMO,
for example, to hire people or find partners who will DEMO thrive when working with you.
For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be verbs. Its not integrity,
its DEMO do the right thing. Its not innovation, its look at the problem from a different
act in any situation.
Everything you say and DEMO you do has to prove what you believe. A WHY is just a
belief. Thats all it is. HOWs are the actions you take DEMO realize that belief. And WHATs are the
results of those actionseverything you say and do: your products, services, marketing, PR,
culture DEMO whom you hire.
If people dont buy WHAT you do but WHY you do it, then all these things must be consistent.
With consistency people will see and hear, without a shadow of a doubt, DEMO you believe.
After you have clarity of WHY, are disciplined and DEMO to your own values and guiding
principles, and are consistent in DEMO you say and do, the final step is to keep it DEMO in the right
order.
Southwest Airlines:
o In the early 1970s, only 15 percent of the traveling population traveled by air. All
Southwest cared about was the other 85 percent.  Were the champion for the
common man. That was WHY they started the airline.
o Their guiding DEMO and values stemmed directly from their WHY and were more
common sense than anything else.
o In the 1970s, air travel was expensive, DEMO if Southwest was going to be the champion
for the common man, they had to be cheap, fun and simple. Thats HOW they DEMO it.
Thats how they were to champion the cause of the common man. You are now free to
move about the country, they DEMO in their advertising. Thats much more than a
tagline. Thats a cause. And its a cause looking for followers.
o What Southwest has achieved DEMO the stuff of business folklore. As a result of WHY they
do what they do, and because they are highly disciplined in HOW they do it, they are
the most profitable airline in history.
o There are many ways to motivate people to do things, but loyalty comes from the ability
to inspire people. Only when the WHY is clear DEMO when people believe what you
believe can a true loyal relationship develop.
Its when that emotional feeling goes deeper than insecurity or uncertainty or DEMO that the
emotional reaction aligns with how we view ourselves. It is at that point that behavior moves
from being motivated to inspired. When DEMO are inspired, the decisions we make have more to
do with DEMO we are and less to do with the companies or the products were buying.
When our decisions feel right, were willing to pay a premium or suffer an inconvenience for
those products or services. This has DEMO to do with price or quality. Price, quality, features
and service are important, but they are the cost of entry in business today. It is those visceral
limbic feelings that create loyalty.
When WHY, HOW, and WHAT are in balance authenticity is achieved and the buyer feels
fulfilled. When they are out of balance, stress or uncertainty exists.

The Golden Circle provides a way to communicate consistent with how individuals DEMO
information. For this reason an organization must be clear about its purpose, cause or belief
and make sure that everything they say and do is consistent with and authentic to that belief.
If the levels of DEMO Golden Circle are in balance, all those who share the organizations DEMO of
the world will be drawn to it and its products like a moth to a light bulb.
People are people and the biology DEMO decision-making is the same no matter whether it is a
personal decision or a business decision.
It is exceedingly difficult to start building a DEMO relationship with a potential customer or
client by trying to convince them of all the rational features and benefits. Those things are
important, but they serve only to give credibility to a sales pitch and allow DEMO to rationalize
their purchase decision.
The ability to put a WHY into words provides the emotional context for decisions. It offers
greater confidence than DEMO think its right. Its more scalable than I feel its right. When you
know your WHY, the highest level of confidence you can offer is, I know its right. When you
know the decision is right, not only does it feel right, but you can also rationalize DEMO and easily
put it into words. The decision is fully balanced.
The rational WHATs offer proof for the feeling of VHY. If you can DEMO the feeling that
drove the gut decision, if you can clearly DEMO your WHY, youll provide a clear context for
those around you DEMO understand why that decision was made. If the decision is consistent with
the facts and figures, then those facts and figures serve to reinforce the decisionthis is
balance. And if the decision flies in the face DEMO figures then it will highlight the other factors
that need to be considered. It can turn a controversial decision from a debate into a
DEMO
The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you
have. It should be to focus on DEMO people who believe what you believe. When we are
selective about doing business only with those who believe in our WHY, trust emerges.
PART 3: LEADERS NEED A FOLLOWING
Chapter 6: The Emergence of Trust
DEMO Trust does not emerge simply because a seller makes a rational case why the customer
should buy a product or service, or because an executive promises change. Trust is not a
checklist. Fulfilling all your responsibilities DEMO not create trust. Trust is a feeling, not a
rational experience.

We trust some people and companies even when DEMO go wrong, and we dont trust others
even though everything might DEMO gone exactly as it should have. A completed checklist
does not guarantee trust. Trust begins to emerge when we have a sense that another DEMO
or organization is driven by things other than their own self-gain.
With trust comes a sense of valuereal value, not just value equated with money. Value, by
definition, is the transference of trust. You cant DEMO someone you have value, just as you
cant convince someone to DEMO you. You have to earn trust by communicating and
demonstrating that you share the same values and beliefs.
You have to talk about your DEMO and prove it with WHAT you do.
Leading means that others willingly follow younot because they have to, not because they
are paid to, but because they want to.  Those who lead are able to DEMO so because those who
follow trust that the decisions made at the top have the best interest of the group at heart. In
turn, those who trust work hard because they feel like they are working DEMO something bigger
than themselves.
Weve succeeded as a species because of our ability to form cultures. Cultures are groups of
people who come together DEMO a common set of values and beliefs. When we share values
and beliefs with others, we form trust.

It is beneficial to live and work in a place where you will naturally thrive because your values
and beliefs align DEMO the values and beliefs of that culture. The goal is not to hire people who
simply have a skill set you need, the goal is to hire people who believe what you believe.
When employees belong, they guarantee your success. And they wont be working hard and
looking DEMO innovative solutions for you, they will be doing it for themselves.
DEMO all great leaders have in common is the ability to find good fits to join their
organizationsthose who believe what they believe.
Almost every DEMO on the planet is passionate, we are just not all passionate DEMO the same
things. Starting with WHY when hiring dramatically increases your ability to attract those who
are passionate for what you believe. Simply hiring DEMO with a solid resume or great work
ethic does not guarantee success.
Great companies dont hire skilled people and motivate them. They hire already DEMO
people and inspire them. People are either motivated or they are not. Unless you give
motivated people something to believe in, something bigger than their job to work toward, they
will motivate themselves to find a new job and youll be stuck with whoevers left.
Companies with a DEMO sense of WHY are able to inspire their employees. Those employees
are more productive and innovative, and the feeling they bring to work attracts other people
eager to work there as well. Its not such a DEMO to see why the companies that we love to
do business with are also the best employers. When people inside the company know WHY
DEMO come to work, people outside the company are vastly more likely DEMO understand WHY the
company is special. In these organizations, from the DEMO on down, no one sees
themselves as any more or any DEMO than anyone else. They all need each other.
Pulling together a team of like minded people and giving them a cause to pursue ensures DEMO
greater sense of teamwork and camaraderie.
Average companies give their people something to work on. In contrast, the most innovative
organizations give their people something to work toward
The role of a leader is not to DEMO up with all the great ideas. The role of a leader is to create
an environment in which great ideas can happen. It is DEMO people inside the company, those on
the front lines, who are best qualified to find new ways of doing things.
If the people DEMO a company are told to come to work and just do their job, thats all they will
do. If they are constantly reminded WHY the company was founded and told to always look for
ways to DEMO that cause to life while performing their job, however, then they will do more than
their job.
Companies with a clear sense of DEMO tend to ignore their competition. Whereas those with a
fuzzy sense of WHY are obsessed with what others are doing.
The ability of a DEMO to innovate is not just useful for developing new ideas, it DEMO invaluable
for navigating struggle. People who come to work with a clear sense of WHY are less prone to
giving up after a few DEMO because they understand the higher cause.
Southwests remarkable ability to solve problems, Apples remarkable knack for innovation and
the Wright brothers ability to develop a technology with the team they had were all possible for
the DEMO reason: they believed they could and they trusted their people to DEMO it.
If the people arent looking out for the community, then DEMO benefits of a community erode.
Many companies have star employees and star salesmen and so on, but few have a culture
that produces great people as a rule and not an exception.
Trust is a remarkable DEMO Trust allows us to rely on others. We rely on those we trust for
advice to help us make decisions. Trust is the bedrock DEMO the advancement of our own lives,
our families, our companies, our societies and our species.
Only when individuals can trust the culture DEMO organization will they take personal risks in order
to advance that culture or organization as a whole.

For those within a community, or an organization, they must trust DEMO their leaders provide a
netpractical or emotional. With that feeling of support, those in the organization are more
likely to put in extra effort that ultimately benefits the group as a whole.
Great organizations become great DEMO the people inside the organization feel protected.
The strong sense of culture creates a sense of belonging and acts like a net. People come DEMO
work knowing that their bosses, colleagues and the organization as a DEMO will look out for
them. This results in reciprocal behavior. Individual decisions, efforts and behaviors that
support, benefit and protect the long-term interest DEMO the organization as a whole.
If those inside the organization are a good fit, the opportunity to go the extra mile, to explore,
to invent, to innovate, to advance and, more importantly, DEMO do so again and again and again,
increases dramatically. Only with mutual trust can an organization become great.
Earning the trust of an DEMO doesnt come from setting out to impress everyone, it
comes from DEMO out to serve those who serve you. It is the invisible trust that gives a leader
the following they need to get things done.
DEMO companies do not actively work to keep their Golden Circle in balanceclarity, discipline
and consistencythen trust starts to break down. A company, indeed DEMO organization, must
work actively to remind everyone WHY the company exists. DEMO it was founded in the first
place. What it believes. They need to hold everyone in the company accountable to the values
and guiding DEMO Its not enough to just write hem on the wallthats passive. Bonuses
and incentives must revolve around them. The company must serve those whom DEMO wish to
serve it.
Passion comes from feeling like you are a part of something that you believe in, something
bigger than yourself. If people do not trust that a company is organized to advance the DEMO,
then the passion is diluted. Without managed trust, people will DEMO up to do their jobs and
they will worry primarily about themselves. This is the root of office politicspeople acting
within the system for DEMO often at the expense of others, even the company.
If a DEMO doesnt manage trust, then those working for it will not trust DEMO company, and
self-interest becomes the overwhelming motivation. This may be good DEMO the short term, but
over time the organization will get weaker DEMO weaker.
Personal recommendations go a long way. We trust the judgment of others. Its part of the
fabric of strong cultures. But we dont DEMO the judgment of just anyone. We are more likely to
trust those who share our values and beliefs. When we believe someone has our DEMO interest
in mind because it is in their benefit to do so, the whole group benefits. The advancements of
societies were based a great deal on the trust between those with a common set of values DEMO
beliefs.
The feeling of trust is lodged squarely in the same place as the WHYthe limbic brainand
its often powerful enough to trump empirical DEMO, or at least seed doubt.
Chapter 7: How a Tipping Point Tips
• According to the Law of Diffusion, mass-market success can only be achieved after you
penetrate between 15 percent to 18 percent of DEMO market. Thats because the early majority
wont try something new until someone else has tried it first. This is why we have to drop
DEMO to reduce the risk tolerance of these practical-minded people until they feel comfortable
to buy. Thats what a manipulation is. They may buy, but they wont be loyal.

Dont forget, loyalty is when people are willing to DEMO some inconvenience or pay a premium
to do business with you.
The ability to get the system to tip is the point at which DEMO growth of a business or the
spreading of an idea starts to move at an extraordinary pace. It is also at this point that DEMO
product gains mass-market acceptance. The point at which an idea becomes a movement.
When that happens, the growth is not only exponential, it DEMO automatic.

The goal of business then should not be to simply sell to DEMO who wants what you have
the majoritybut rather to find people who believe what you believe, the left side of the bell
curve.
They perceive greater value in what you do and will happily pay a DEMO or suffer some sort
of inconvenience to be a part of your cause. They are the ones who, on their own volition, will
DEMO about you. That 15 to 18 percent is not made up of people who are simply willing to buy the
product. It is the DEMO of people who share your beliefs and want to incorporate your
ideas, your products and your services into their own lives as WHATs to their  own WHYs.
They look to WHAT you do as a tangible element that demonstrates their own purpose, cause
or belief to the outside world.
Their ability to easily see WHY they need to incorporate your DEMO into their lives makes
this group the most loyal customers. They are also the most loyal shareholders and the most
loyal employees. Get enough DEMO the people on the left side of the curve on your side and they
encourage the rest to follow.
PART 4: HOW TO RALLY THOSE WHO BELIEVE
Chapter 8: Start with WHY, but Know HOW
DEMO Energy motivates but charisma inspires. Energy is easy to see. Easy to measure and easy to
copy. Charisma is hard to define, near impossible to measure and too elusive to copy.

•
•
DEMO
•
•

•
•
All great leaders have charisma because all great leaders have clarity of WHY; an undying
belief in a purpose or cause bigger than themselves.
Charisma has nothing to do with DEMO; it comes from a clarity of WHY. It comes from
absolute DEMO in an ideal bigger than oneself. Energy, in contrast, comes from a good
nights sleep or lots of caffeine. Energy can excite. But DEMO charisma can inspire. Charisma
commands loyalty. Energy does not.
Regardless of WHAT we do in our lives, our WHYour driving purpose, cause or DEMO
never changes. If our Golden Circle is in balance, WHAT we DEMO is simply the tangible way we
find to breathe life into that cause.
No matter how charismatic or inspiring the leader is, if there are not people in the organization
inspired to bring that vision to DEMO, to build an infrastructure with systems and processes,
then at DEMO, inefficiency reigns, and at worst, failure results.
In every case DEMO a great charismatic leader who ever achieved anything of significance, there
DEMO always a person or small group lurking in the shadows who knew HOW to take the vision
and make it a reality.
WHY-types are DEMO visionaries, the ones with the overactive imaginations. They tend to be
DEMO who believe that all the things they imagine can actually be accomplished. HOW-
types live more in the here and now. They are the DEMO and have a clearer sense of all
things practical.
WHY-types are focused on the things most people cant see, like the future. HOW-types are
focused on things most people can see and tend to be better DEMO building structures and
processes and getting things done. One is not better than the other, they are just different
ways people naturally see and experience the world.
Most people in the world are HOW-types. Most people DEMO quite functional in the real world
and can do their jobs and do very well. Some HOW-types dont need WHY-types to do well.
But DEMO, for all their vision and imagination, often get the short end of the stick. Without
someone inspired by their vision and the knowledge DEMO make it a reality, most WHY-types end
up as starving visionaries, people with all the answers but never accomplishing much
themselves.
Although so DEMO of them fancy themselves visionaries, in realty most successful
entrepreneurs are DEMO types.

A business is a structuresystems and processes that need to be assembled. DEMO is the HOW-
types who are more adept at building those processes and systems. But most companies, no
matter how well built, do DEMO become billion-dollar businesses or change the course of
industries. To reach the billion-dollar status, to alter the course of an industry, requires a DEMO
special and rare partnership between one who knows WHY and those who know HOW.
This relationship starts to clarify the difference between a vision DEMO and a mission
statement in an organization. The vision is the public statement of the founders intent, WHY
the company exists. It is literally the vision of a future that does not yet exist.
The mission DEMO is a description of the route, the guiding principlesHOW the company
DEMO to create that future. When both of those things are stated clearly, the WHY-type and
the HOW-type are both certain about their roles in the partnership. Both are working together
with clarity of purpose and a DEMO to get here. For it to work, however, it requires more than a
set of skills. It requires trust.
Its not an accident DEMO these unions of WHY and HOW so often come from families or old
friendships. A shared upbringing and life experience increases the probability of DEMO shared set
of values and beliefs.
For a message to have real impact, to affect behavior and seed loyalty, it needs more than
DEMO It needs to publicize some higher purpose, cause or belief to DEMO those with similar
values and beliefs can relate. Only then can the message create any lasting mass-market
success. For a stunt to appeal to DEMO left side of the curve of the Law of Diffusion, WHY DEMO
stunt is being performed, beyond the desire to generate press, must be clear. Though there
may be short-term benefits without clarity, loud is nothing more than excessive volume.
For a WHY to have the power DEMO move people it must not only be clear, it must be DEMO to
reach enough people to tip the scale.
An organization effectively becomes the vessel through which a person with a clear purpose,
cause DEMO belief can speak to the outside world. But for a megaphone to work, clarity must
come first. Without a clear message, what will DEMO amplify?
Chapter 9: Know WHY Know HOW. Then WHAT?
DEMO Empowering the individual spirit is WHY Apple exists. Apple knows their WHY and so do we.

If all the things happening at the WHAT level do not clearly represent DEMO the company
exists, then the ability to inspire is severely complicated.
DEMO a company is small, it revolves around the personality of the DEMO As a company
grows, the CEOs job is to personify the DEMO To be a symbol of what the company believes.
They are the intention and what the company says and does is their voice.
As DEMO organization grows, the leader becomes physically removed, farther and farther away
from WHAT the company does and even farther away from the outside DEMO The leader
must ensure that there are people on the team who believe what they believe and know HOW
to build it.
The leader DEMO at the top of the organization is the inspiration, the symbol DEMO the reason we
do what we do. They represent the emotional limbic brain. WHAT the company says and does
presents the rational thought and DEMO of the neocortex. Just as it is hard for people to
speak their feelings, it is equally hard for an organization to explain its WHY.
Organizations of any size will struggle to clearly communicate their WHY. DEMO into
business terms this means that trying to communicate your differentiating value proposition is
really hard.
Done properly, thats what marketing, branding and DEMO and services become; a way for
organizations to communicate to the DEMO world. Communicate clearly and you shall be
understood.

Chapter 10: Communication Is Not About Speaking, Its About Listening

Most companies have logos, but few have DEMO able to convert those logos into meaningful
symbols. Because without clarity of WHY, a logo is just a logo.
What a company says and does are the means by which the company speaks.
The reason the DEMO uses Apple so extensively throughout this book is that Apple is so
disciplined in HOW they do things and so consistent in WHAT they DEMO that, love them or hate
them, we all have a sense of their WHY. We know what they believe.
Its not just WHAT DEMO HOW you do things that matters; what matters more is that DEMO and
HOW you do things is consistent with your WHY Only then will your practices indeed be best.
There is a simple test you DEMO apply to find out exactly WHAT and HOW is right for you. Its a
simple metaphor called the Celery Test. If you say you DEMO eating healthy, celery in your
supermarket basket shows that you are DEMO so  not Oreo cookies.
Filtering your decisions through your WHY, DEMO can see what you believe.
Simply ensuring that WHAT you do proves what you believe makes it easy for those who
believe what you DEMO to find you. You have successfully communicated your WHY based
on WHAT you do.
With a WHY clearly stated in an organization, anyone within the organization can make a
decision as clearly and as accurately as DEMO founder. A WHY provides the clear filter for
decision-making. Any decisionshiring, DEMO, strategies and tacticsshould all pass
the Celery Test.
By the time DEMO Walton died, he had taken Wal-Mart from a single store in DEMO,
Arkansas, and turned it into a retail colossus with $44 DEMO in annual sales with 40 million
people shopping in the stores per week.
Walton wasnt the first person with big dreams to start a DEMO business. Sam Walton did not
invent the low-cost shopping model. Wal-Mart was not the only retail establishment capable of
offering low prices either. Walmart DEMO not have a lock on cheap prices and cheap prices are
not what made it so beloved and ultimately so successful.
For Sam Walton, there was something else, a deeper purpose, cause or belief that DEMO him.
Wal-Mart was WHAT Walton built to serve his fellow human beings. To serve the community,
to serve employees and to serve customers. DEMO was a higher cause.
The problem was that his cause was not clearly handed down after he died. In the post-Sam
era, Wal-Mart slowly started to confuse WHY it existedto serve peoplewith HOW it did
businessto DEMO low prices.  They forgot Waltons WHY and their driving motivation became
DEMO about cheap.
In Wal-Marts case, forgetting their founders WHY has come DEMO a very high human cost. Ironic,
considering the companys founding cause. The company once renowned for how it treated
employees and customers has DEMO scandal-ridden for nearly a decade. Nearly every scandal
has centered on how poorly they treat their customers and their employees.
What has changed is DEMO their WHY went fuzzy. If we, as outsiders, have lost clarity of Wal-
Marts WHY, its a good sign that the WHY has gone fuzzy inside the company also. What is
clear is that the DEMO of today is not the Wal-Mart that Sam Walton built.
For some people, there is an irony to success. Many people who achieve great success dont
always feel it. Some who achieve fame talk about the DEMO that often goes with it. Thats
13
because success and achievement are not the same thing, yet too often we mistake one for
the other.
• Achievement is something you reach DEMO attain, like a goal. It is something tangible, clearly
defined and measurable. Success, in contrast, is a feeling or a state of DEMO She feels
successful. She is successful, we say, using the DEMO to be to suggest this state of being.
• While we can easily lay down a path to reach a goal, laying down a path to reach that
intangible feeling of success is more elusive. In DEMO vernacular, achievement comes when
you pursue and attain WHAT you want. DEMO comes when you are clear in pursuit of WHY
you want it. The former is motivated by intangible factors while the latter by something DEMO
in the brain, where we lack the capacity to put those DEMO into words.
• Success comes when we wake up every day in that never-ending pursuit of WHY we do
WHAT we do. Our achievements, WHAT we do, serve as the milestones to indicate we are on
the right path. It is not an either/orwe need both.
• DEMO the course of building a business or a career, we become DEMO confident in WHAT we do.
We become greater experts in HOW to do it. With each achievement, the tangible
measurements of success and the feeling of progress increase. Life is good. However, for
most of us, somewhere in the journey we forget WHY we set out on the journey in the first
place. Somewhere in the course of all those DEMO an inevitable split happens. This is
true for individuals and organizations alike.
• Those with an ability to never lose sight of WHY, no matter how little or how much they
achieve, can inspire us. Those with the ability to never lose sight of WHY and also achieve DEMO
milestones that keep everyone focused in the right direction are the great leaders. For great
leaders, The Golden Circle is in balance. They are in pursuit of WHY, they hold themselves
accountable to HOW they do it and WHAT they do serves as the tangible proof of what DEMO
believe.
• Most of us, unfortunately, reach a place where WHAT we are doing and WHY we are doing it
eventually fall out DEMO balance. We get to a point when WHY and WHAT are not aligned. It the
separation of the tangible and the intangible that marks DEMO split.
Chapter 12: Split Happens
• Nearly every company or organization DEMO the same way: with an idea.
• At the beginning ideas DEMO fueled by passion, that very compelling emotion that causes us to
DEMO quite irrational things. That passion drives many people to make sacrifices so that a cause
bigger than themselves can be brought to life.
• DEMO reason so many small businesses fail, however, is because passion alone cant cut it. For
passion to survive, it needs structure. A WHY without the HOWs, passion without structure,
has a very high probability of failure. Passion may need structure to survive, but for structure
to grow, it needs passion.
• The single greatest challenge any organization will face is success. As the organization grows,
as it becomes more DEMO, it becomes physically impossible for one person to make
every major DEMO Not only must others be trusted and relied upon to make big decisions,
but those people will also start making hiring choices. And DEMO but surely, as the
megaphone grows, the clarity of WHY starts to dilute.
• The moment at which the clarity of WHY starts DEMO go fuzzy is the split. At this point
organizations may be loud, but they are no longer clear.
• When organizations are small, DEMO they do and WHY they do it are in close parallel. Born
out of the personality of the founder, it is relatively easy for early employees to get it. Clarity
of WHY is understood because the DEMO of passion is nearin fact it physically comes to
work every day.

For organizations that want to pass the School Bus Test, to become billion-dollar organizations
or work at a scale large enough to DEMO markets or society, the need to manage through the
split is DEMO
The School Bus Test is a simple metaphor. If a founder or leader of an organization were to be
hit by a school bus, would the organization continue to thrive at the same pace without them DEMO
the helm? So many organizations are built on the force of DEMO single personality that their
departure can cause significant disruption.
Its just a question of when and how prepared the organization is or the inevitable DEMO
The challenge isnt to cling to the leader; its to find DEMO ways to keep the founding vision
alive forever.
The founders WHY must be extracted and integrated into the culture of the company. Whats
more, a strong succession plan should aim to find a leader inspired by DEMO founding cause and
ready to lead it into the next generation. Future leaders and employees alike must be inspired
by something bigger than the DEMO of personality of the founder and must see beyond profit
and shareholder value alone.
Successful entrepreneurs need to return to a time when WHAT DEMO did was in perfect parallel
to WHY they did it.  Companies DEMO Wal-Mart, Microsoft, Starbucks, the Gap, Dell and so
many others that used to be special have all gone through a split. If DEMO cannot recapture their
WHY and reinspire those inside and outside their organization, every one of them will end up
looking more like AOL than the companies they were.
Most organizations today use very clear metrics to DEMO the progress and growth of WHAT
they dousually its money. Unfortunately, DEMO have very poor measurements to ensure that a
WHY stays clear.
• Money is a perfectly legitimate measurement of goods sold  or services rendered. But it is no
calculation of value. Value is a feeling, not a calculation. It is perception.
• A strong brand, like all other intangible factors that contribute to the perception of value, starts
with a clear sense of WHY. Loyal buyers will always rationalize the premium they DEMO or the
inconvenience they suffer to get that feeling. To them, DEMO sacrifice of time or money is worth
it. They will try to explain that their feeling of value comes from quality or features or DEMO
other easy-to-point-to element, but it doesnt. Those are external factors and DEMO feeling they
get comes completely from inside them.
Microsoft

•
Like all visionary leaders, Bill Gates is special because he embodies what he believes. He is
the personification of Microsofts DEMO And for that reason, he serves as a physical beacon, a
reminder of WHY everyone comes to work.
When Gates founded Microsoft with DEMO Allen in 1975, he did so to advance a higher cause: if
you give people the right tools, and make them more productive, then everyone, no matter
their lot in life, will have an opportunity to achieve their real potential. A PC in every home and
DEMO every desk, he envisioned; remarkable from a company that didnt DEMO make PCs.
Make no mistake, Microsoft has done more to change DEMO world than Apple. Though we are
drawn to Apples well-deserved reputation for innovation and challenging the business models
of more than one industry, it is Microsoft that was responsible for the advancement of the
personal computer. DEMO put a PC on every desk and in doing so he changed the world. As
the physical embodiment of the companys WHY, the everyman who fulfilled an amazing
potential, what happens now that hes gone?
•
Although Microsoft went through the split years ago, changing from a company that intended
to change the world into a company that makes DEMO, having Gates hanging around
helped Microsoft maintain at least a loose DEMO of WHY they existed. With Gates gone,
Microsoft does not have sufficient systems to measure and preach their WHY anymore. This is
an DEMO that will have an exponential impact as time passes.

• It wasnt until Jobst returned in 1997 that everyone inside and DEMO the company was
reminded WHY Apple existed. With clarity back, the DEMO quickly reestablished its power
for innovation, for thinking different and, once again, for redefining industries. With Jobst at the
helm again, the DEMO for challenging the status quo, for empowering the individual, returned.
Every decision was filtered through the WHY, and it worked.
• When the person who personifies the WHY departs without clearly articulating WHY the
company DEMO founded in the first place, they leave no clear cause for DEMO successor to lead.
The new CE0 will come aboard to run the company and will focus attention on the growth of
WHAT with little DEMO to WHY. Worse, they may try to implement their own vision DEMO
considering the cause that originally inspired most people to show up in the first place. In
these cases, the leader can work against the culture of the company instead of leading or
building upon it. The DEMO is diminished morale, mass exodus, poor performance and a slow
and steady transition to a culture of mistrust and every-man-for-himself.
• Starbucks is DEMO good example. In 2000, Howard Schultz resigned as CEO of Starbucks,DEMO
and for the first time in its history and despite 50 million customers per week, the company
started to crack.
• The reason the company was floundering was not that it grew too fast, but that Schultz had not
properly infused his WHY into the organization so that DEMO organization could manage the
WHY without him. In early 2008, Schultz DEMO Donald with a leader who could better steer
the company back to a time before the split: himself
• The entire culture of all these companies was built around one mans vision. The only
succession plan DEMO will work is to find a CEO who believes in and wants to continue to lead
that movement, not replace it with their own vision of the future.
• Thats why we call it succession, not replacement. There is a continuity of vision.
• It will be easy DEMO know if a successor is carrying the right torch. Simply apply the Celery Test
and see if what the company is saying and doing DEMO sense. Test whether WHAT they are
doing effectively proves WHY they were founded. If we cant easily assess a companys WHY
simply from looking DEMO their products, services, marketing and public statements, then odds are
DEMO that they dont know what it is either. If they did, DEMO would we.
• With a company so beloved by employees, customers DEMO communities, Walton made only
one major blunder. He didnt put his DEMO into clear enough words so that others could
continue to lead the cause after he died.
• Since Sam Waltons death, Wal-Mart has been battered by scandals of mistreating employees
and customers all in the name DEMO shareholder value. Their WHY has gone so fuzzy that even
when they do things well, few are willing to give them credit.
PART 6: DISCOVER WHY
Chapter 13: The Origins of a WHY
• The DEMO does not come from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and figuring out an
appropriate strategy to get there. It is not DEMO out of any market research. It does not come
from extensive interviews with customers or even employees. It comes from looking in the
completely DEMO direction from where you are now. Finding WHY is a process of discovery,
not invention.
• Every company, organization or group with the ability to inspire starts with a person or small
group of people DEMO were inspired to do something bigger than themselves. Gaining clarity of
WHY, ironically, is not the hard part. It is the discipline to DEMO ones gut, to stay true to ones
purpose, cause or beliefs. Remaining completely in balance and authentic is the most difficult
part. The DEMO that are able to build a megaphone, and not just a DEMO, around their cause
are the ones who earn the ability to DEMO In doing so, they harness a power to move people
that DEMO can even imagine. Learning the WHY of a company or an organization or
understanding the WHY of any social movement always starts with one DEMO: you.

• Sineks WHY is to inspire people to do the things that DEMO them. The vision is to have every
person and every organization know their WHY and use it to benefit all they do.
Chapter 14: New Competition
• When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete
against yourself, everyone wants to help you.
• Imagine if every organization started with WHY. Decisions would DEMO simpler. Loyalties would
be greater. Trust would be a common currency. If our leaders were diligent about starting with
WHY, optimism would reign and innovation would thrive.
• As this book illustrates, there is precedence for this standard. No matter the size of the
organization, no matter the industry, no matter the product or the service, if we all DEMO some
responsibility to start with WHY and inspire others to do the same, then, together, we can
change the world. And thats pretty inspiring.
Recommendation: Start With Why is one of the most useful and powerful books that I have read. It is
both simple and elegant DEMO it shows us how leaders should lead. It is a powerful and penetrating
exploration of what separates great companies and great leaders from the DEMO And Simon Sinek is
an incredible human being  having met him I adore him!
