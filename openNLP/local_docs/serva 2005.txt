Summary
This research develops and investigates the concept of reciprocal trust between interacting
DEMO Reciprocal trust is deﬁned as the trust that results when a party observes the actions
of another and reconsiders one’s trust-related attitudes and subsequent DEMO based on
those observations. Twenty-four teams of systems analysis and design students were involved
in a 6-week controlled ﬁeld study focused on the development DEMO an information systems pro-
ject. Each team was responsible for both developing a system (development role) and for
supervising the development of a DEMO by another team (management role). Risk-taking
actions exhibited by one DEMO in an interacting pair were found to predict the other team’s
trustworthiness perceptions and subsequent trust. The level of trust formed in turn predicted
DEMO team’s subsequent risk-taking behaviors with respect to the other team. This pattern of
reciprocal trust repeated itself as the teams continued to interact over DEMO duration of the pro-
ject, thus supporting our model of reciprocal DEMO Findings also indicate that trust and trust
formation can occur at the team level. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Introduction
Researchers from management and related ﬁelds agree that trust has important organizational and
DEMO consequences (Argyris, 1964; Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, DEMO; Mayer, Davis,
& Schoorman, 1995; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990; Spreitzer & Mishra,
2002; Zaheer & DEMO, 1995). While much is known about trust, several areas can beneﬁt from
additional attention. Few studies have empirically examined trust between parties DEMO time (Lewicki
& Bunker, 1995). This scarcity is understandable, DEMO the inherent complexities of longitudi-
nal research. However, given the apparent DEMO between trust and organizational performance,
it is important to understand how trust is nurtured and eroded as parties interact. In addition, the ques-
tion of whether or not teams can exhibit trust remains an open DEMO question. Although trust

research focused on individuals is important, groups and organizations are more than collections of
individuals. Hence, research also needs to address the development of trust in these more complex
social DEMO
This study contributes to the growing literature on trust by examining team-based trust in a long-
itudinal context. In addition, this research deﬁnes and develops the concept of reciprocal trust using an
established theoretical framework (Mayer et al., 1995) by examining whether one party’s actions inﬂu-
ence DEMO level of trust formed in another party. This research extends prior ﬁndings by examining the
dynamic interplay of the determinants of trust over time. DEMO also differentiate reciprocal trust from the
concept of mutual trust—two concepts that on the surface appear similar. We focus speciﬁcally on
trust at the DEMO level of analysis. Examining trust at the group level of analysis is in line with
calls for research (Klein, Dansereau, & Hall, DEMO; Mossholder & Bedeian, 1983; Rousseau, 1985)
that have stressed the importance of isomorphism—consistent construct conceptualizations across
levels of analysis—to facilitate multilevel DEMO cross-level inferences. Other researchers have noted
that although conceptually clear multilevel work on trust is needed, an understanding of trust in an
organizational context is being hampered by a lack of such clarity in published studies (Currall &
Inkpen, 2002). By validating the Mayer et al. (1995) model at an interteam level, we facilitate future
multilevel and DEMO work.
Trust
A foundation for this study is the Mayer et al. (1995) framework for trust. This model posits that trust-
worthiness, in the form of beliefs about another party’s ability, benevolence, and integrity, are the pre-
dominant determinants of trust. Mayer et al. (1995) DEMO posit that trust can result in risk-taking—i.e.,
behaviors that open the trustor up to the possibility of loss—which they label ‘risk-taking in relation-
DEMO Consistent with the Mayer et al. (1995) model, we deﬁne DEMO as ‘the willingness of a party to be
vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform DEMO particular
action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to DEMO or control that other party’ (Mayer
et al., 1995, p. DEMO). ‘Party’ can refer to a group, allowing the deﬁnition to DEMO employed for our purposes.
By deﬁning a group’s trust in another group as a willingness to be vulnerable to that group, trust is
differentiated from both perceptions of the other team (i.e., trustworthiness) and from the risk-taking
behaviors which may occur for reasons other than trust. Mayer DEMO al. (1995) emphasized the impor-
tance of making this differentiation. The willingness to be vulnerable can manifest itself in a variety of
risk-taking DEMO dependent upon the context. In an investment situation, trust may result DEMO relin-
quishing control of personal resources to a ﬁnancial planner. In personal relationships, trust may result
in disclosing sensitive information. In our context of interacting teams in a project development envir-
onment, trust may result in other behaviors which we discuss more completely below. It is important to
DEMO that if trustworthiness perceptions of the other party change, a party’s DEMO to be vulner-
able—i.e., trust—may be immediately affected. On the other DEMO, it takes time for a change in trust
to manifest itself DEMO a different level of risk-taking behavior.
Team trust
The majority of trust research has focused on an individual as the trustor of interest. While DEMO
individuals is interesting and important, we explore whether or not a DEMO as a whole can exhibit trust.
Indeed, Schoorman, Mayer, and DEMO (1996b) stress the importance of extending trust to the group
and organization levels of analysis and call for additional research speciﬁcally targeting this DEMO

topic. Consistent with the model presented DEMO Mayer et al. (1995), a group’s trust for another can DEMO
thought of as a shared belief by members of a focal group about how willing that group is to be vulner-
able to a DEMO (i.e., trustee) group. Previous studies have proposed that trust can DEMO at both the
group and organizational level (Currall & Judge, 1995; Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998), although
empirical conﬁrmation has DEMO needed. Moreover, interorganizational trust was described by Zaheer
et al. (1998) as a collectively held trust orientation toward the partner ﬁrm. This latter view is consistent
with the approach to intergroup trust taken in this DEMO
This shift from interpersonal to interteam trust is signiﬁcant for at least two reasons. First, interact-
ing teams have become common. Thus, understanding DEMO to nurture effective interactions between
teams is critical to performance. Second, DEMO are not simply collections of individuals—they exhi-
bit characteristics reﬂective of the whole. Thompson and Fine (1999) showed that groups have been
dealt DEMO theoretically as supraorganisms for many decades (e.g., McDougall, 1920). DEMO this and other
work, Thompson and her colleagues note that the DEMO of the group as a unit of analysis as an informa-
tion processor has become accepted in organizational research. As she states in the DEMO to a
special issue of Basic and Applied Social Psychology, ‘the DEMO of analysis is no longer the individual
information processor ... but the interacting group and dyad ... . [The focus of the special issue DEMO
how interacting individuals and groups create meaning and act upon collectively developed cognition,
motivation, and emotion’ (Thompson, 1998, p. 3). DEMO may be one of the characteristics that are inﬂu-
ential in group and inter-group performance.
Reciprocal trust
While previous research has examined both the DEMO and consequences of trust, fewer studies
have explored whether existing trust (and its behavioral consequences) has a role in establishing
another party’s trust over time—in effect, demonstrating that trust may beget more trust (Das & Teng,
1998). Reciprocity may be critical in understanding trust in relationships (Blau, 1964). Trust forms in
the mind of the DEMO It cannot be observed by others, and therefore cannot directly affect DEMO per-
ceptions held by or behaviors of other individuals or groups. The risk-taking behaviors that are
believed to result from trust are evident to DEMO, however, and it is these behaviors that may provide
the stimulus that can encourage subsequent demonstrations (both positive and negative) of trust DEMO
return (Boon & Holmes, 1991; Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985). Research that examines the devel-
opment of trust in virtual DEMO, for example, concluded that one team’s actions affected another
team’s subsequent perceptions of trust (Jarvenpaa & Leidner, 1999).
In addressing the DEMO that occurs between parties, the concepts of mutual trust and reciprocal DEMO
have overlapped. We assert that mutual trust is conceptually different from reciprocal trust. Mutual
trust exists when two people have complementary trust for one DEMO, and when each perceives that
the other is aware of his DEMO and his trust (Deutsch, 1958). Under mutual trust, researchers DEMO
that each party has roughly the same level of trust for the other party (Nelson & Cooprider, 1996; Ring
& Van De Ven, 1994). Mutual trust also presents a static picture of complementary trust without
addressing how actions and context have affected present levels of trust.
DEMO reciprocate, however, means ‘to give and take mutually; to show DEMO feel in response’ (Webster,
1984, p. 584). Reciprocal trust implies an active process of exchange of trust between parties, parti-
cularly when it results from a trustee’s previous demonstration of trust. Equivalence is DEMO a require-
ment of reciprocal trust. We deﬁne reciprocal trust as the trust that results when a party observes the
actions of another and DEMO one’s attitudes and subsequent behaviors based on those observa-
tions. Our concept of reciprocal trust is not a distinct type of trust, but rather it is a dynamic process
through which trust grows or diminishes. Describing DEMO trust requires examining the process by

which actions result in trust between DEMO parties. This requires the measurement of one party’s
actions, and the DEMO of another party’s trust-related reaction to those actions. It is important
to note that the focus of this study is the reciprocal nature of DEMO between interdependent teams.
Although the intragroup dynamics through which a group’s level of trust is formed are also of great
interest, examination of that process is beyond the scope of this research.

development project), Team A perceives DEMO B to have some level of trustworthiness, which results
in Team DEMO level of trust in Team B. Team A subsequently takes a risk by performing an action that
results in its being vulnerable to Team DEMO Such actions have been called ‘risk-taking in relationship,’ or
RTR (DEMO et al., 1995). The RTR increases or decreases Team B’s DEMO of Team A’s trust-
worthiness, depending on whether Team A’s action DEMO perceived positively or negatively. Team B
responds by updating its prior perceptions of A’s trustworthiness, and increasing or decreasing its trust
and RTRs with respect to Team A. This constitutes an action–reaction cycle where both Team DEMO and
Team B’s trust can be inﬂuenced by each other. In this way, one team’s trust and resultant risk-taking
behaviors may encourage future trust and risk-related actions of another team.
This concept of action–reaction is well DEMO in the complementary ﬁeld of game theory
(Axelrod, 1984). What game theory ignores, however, are the beliefs that motivate the actions DEMO
reactions. Game theory research equates cooperation with trust. Cooperation can, however, exist with-
out trust (Mayer et al., 1995). Trust can DEMO cooperation in circumstances where other means of pro-
ducing cooperation (e.g., the use of coercion) are not possible or are likely to be unsuccessful. Thus, it
is important to distinguish between the two. Unlike game theory research, the current study examines
not only behaviors but also considers the perceptions and attitudes that underlie the behaviors.
Study Overview and Hypotheses
DEMO context for studying the evolution of trust between interdependent teams involves two interdepen-
dent teams interacting on a systems development project. Within the project, a development team pro-
vides a solitary source of technical knowledge for DEMO management team who must rely on the
development team to construct the solution. The management team is also a unique source of impor-
tant DEMO, since it provides the initial requirements and feedback that allow the DEMO
team to successfully complete its job. The management team on the project sets forth requirements
and is responsible for overseeing a development team charged DEMO the construction of an information
system.
We propose three hypotheses and test them over four time periods, each of which lasts about 10 days
(Figure 1b). Figure 1(b) illustrates the same information as DEMO feedback model illustrated in
Figure 1(a), but introduces time periods into the representation. The ﬁrst two hypotheses are designed
to conﬁrm the DEMO et al. (1995) model of trust extended to the team level of analysis. Speciﬁcally,
the ﬁrst hypothesis examines whether the trustworthiness factors (i.e., ability, benevolence, and integ-
rity) predict team trust. The DEMO examines the effect of trust on later risk-taking actions speciﬁc to
the project management context. The third hypothesis focuses on reciprocal trust by examining
DEMO the actions of one team relate to the perceptions of its trustworthiness held by the other team.
These hypotheses are discussed more thoroughly below.
DEMO hypothesis
Mayer et al. (1995) posits that three primary factors—ability, DEMO, and integrity—can parsi-
moniously encompass the concept of trustworthiness, the immediate precursor to trust. This particular
framework has been used by numerous other DEMO studying the antecedents of trust (Bauer &
Green, 1996; Robinson, 1996). Previous research, for example, has indicated that trust in another is
inﬂuenced by perceptions of the other party’s ability to accomplish DEMO task important to the trustor,

where ability is the set of DEMO or attributes that enable the trustee to have inﬂuence (Butler, 1991;
Cook & Wall, 1980). Thus, exhibited ability can be DEMO to positively inﬂuence trust because
the trustee will be perceived to have more capacity to help the trustor. In turn, benevolence is the
degree to which the trustor believes that the trustee has goodwill or positive DEMO toward the trus-
tor (Larzelere & Huston, 1980; Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, & Werner, 1998). Similar to ability, the
more DEMO trustee exhibits behaviors that show they value the trustor’s needs and seek to protect the trus-
tor, the greater the resulting trust on the part of the trustor should be. Finally, integrity is a trustor’s
perception that the trustee adheres to acceptable values, which could include issues such as consis-
tency, honesty, and fairness. A trustee who shows that DEMO follow values that the trustor likes should
be more trusted. Other researchers have also proposed that factors similar to integrity play a role in
DEMO (Butler, 1991; Lieberman, 1981; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). Based on this rationale, we propose:
Hypothesis 1: One team’s DEMO of another team’s ability, benevolence, and integrity will pre-
dict the ﬁrst team’s trust in the second team.
Risk-taking in relationship hypothesis
Mayer DEMO al. (1995) also proposed that trust leads to behavioral consequences. These risk-taking beha-
viors make the trustor vulnerable to the trustee. As mentioned DEMO, the consequences of trust (i.e.,
the speciﬁc RTRs) are DEMO upon the context in which trust is studied. Since this research focuses
on the relationships between teams interacting in management and development roles in DEMO systems
development project, risk-taking behaviors speciﬁc to this management team–development team DEMO
text are identiﬁed and developed.
For the development team role, we DEMO two types of risk-taking behaviors that can result from
trust in this context: formalizing and scoping. Development teams may reduce their perceived risk by
formalizing communications regarding project-related outcomes and procedures such as requiring a
project DEMO, project schedule, and resource assignments. Project documentation, change request
forms, or public staff meetings can serve as a contract, protecting developers from exposure to risk
(Bozeman & Kingsley, 1998). We posit that DEMO formalizing communication reduces risk (documen-
tation allows a team to prove DEMO was planned or discussed), development teams who do not trust
their management teams will formalize more. Another common method used to reduce project DEMO
is to control the project’s scope by restricting a management team’s capacity to change project speci-
ﬁcations. Allowing project requirements or speciﬁcations to expand DEMO initial expectations
(known as ‘scope creep’) is a primary cause of unmet deadlines and budgets (Abdel-Hamid &
Madnick, 1991; Zmud, 1980). While related to formalization, project scope control activities keep
the requirements of the project in line with estimated time and resources so that DEMO development
team’s efforts will be judged a success. A development team that trusts its management team should
exert less effort to protect itself from DEMO in scope, which increases its project risk by not meeting
time DEMO budgetary goals.
For the management team role, we examine two types DEMO risk-taking behaviors that would be a con-
sequence of trust in this context: monitoring development team progress and delegating tasks to the
development team. Researchers have proposed that trust in business relationships can reduce the need
DEMO monitoring (Shapiro, Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992). In one study, researchers found that veterinar-
ians delegated riskier tasks to employees in whom they had more trust (Schoorman, Mayer, &
Davis, 1996a). Others have also proposed similar effects of trust (Fox, 1974). DEMO, in a project
management context, if a management team trusts its development team, it should delegate more
risky tasks to the development team—such as delegation of decision-making regarding the design

THE RECIPROCAL NATURE OF TRUST

of a project deliverable or greater DEMO over the amount of communication expected to keep man-
agement informed. A second type of risk-taking action is the extent to which one party DEMO
another (Bromiley & Cummings, 1996; Fox, 1974). Computer-based monitoring, for example, has
become common in the workplace, especially if management believes employees are using company
time inappropriately (George, 1996). Such DEMO may result from management’s lack of trust in
the employees. Previous management research has found that trust is negatively related to control-
based monitoring (McAllister, 1995). In our information systems development project, management
teams DEMO do not trust their development team should monitor more since they will likely feel the need
to oversee the developers’ progress.
In sum, we hypothesize that a team that trusts its counterpart team will act in DEMO way that may put it at
risk to the other team. It should be noted that in some instances increases in risk-taking actions should
DEMO reﬂected in increases in certain types of behaviors, although in other DEMO increases in risk-
taking may cause decreases in a behavior. For example, increases in management’s trust may lead
to RTRs like increased delegation of tasks to the development team, or reduced monitoring of devel-
opment team actions. In sum:
Hypothesis 2: Team trust will be positively related to its risk-taking actions toward the trusted team.
Reciprocal trust hypothesis
As DEMO earlier, trust itself is not visible to the interacting teams. The DEMO of reciprocal trust
occurs, however, as a team observes the behaviors of another team and perceives them as a signal of
trust. The DEMO team then modiﬁes its perceptions of the ﬁrst team’s trustworthiness (ability, ben-
evolence, or integrity). These perceptions immediately inﬂuence the second team’s trust in the ﬁrst team,
which in turn affects the second DEMO own RTRs. These behaviors are observed and interpreted by the
ﬁrst team, and the cycle continues. As explained by Das and Teng, ‘When DEMO trustee realizes that a trustor
has taken considerable risk in trusting her, she tends to be motivated to behave in a trustworthy manner’
(DEMO & Teng, 1998, p. 503). This research posits that the best explanation of the mechanism for reci-
procal development of trust is DEMO the linking of one team’s RTRs to another team’s trustworthiness
perceptions (DEMO, perceptions of the trustee’s ability, benevolence, and integrity). The DEMO nature of
‘I trust you because you trust me’ (McAllister, 1995) will continue as long as teams continue to interact.
A more concrete illustration may be useful. If a management team does not trust a DEMO
team, it may more closely monitor the progress made by the DEMO team (monitoring) to avoid
taking a risk at the development team’s hands. Interpreting these actions as a lack of trust, the devel-
opment team may attempt to protect itself, including formalizing communications (so messages DEMO
not lost) and requiring detailed change requests as a form of DEMO scope control (so the development
team reduces its risk of falling DEMO schedule, even at the expense of a more suitable systems devel-
DEMO effort). These development team behaviors may be interpreted by the management team as
indicators of reduced development team ability, benevolence, or integrity (the factors of trustworthi-
ness), which in turn decreases the management DEMO trust in the development team. Such a reciprocal
process could continue through the life of a project, as trust is developed or eroded through multiple
interactions. It should be noted that actions may be interpreted differently DEMO on the context in
which they occur. For example, increased scoping DEMO be viewed as acceptable and professional early
in a project, but DEMO be interpreted negatively later in a project. We propose:
Hypothesis 3: One team’s risk-taking behaviors will be related to the other team’s perceptions of the
ﬁrst team’s trustworthiness.

Organizational Context
The Sample
Data were DEMO in a senior-level systems analysis and design class taken by students who had
elected to minor in management information systems while majoring in another DEMO discipline
(accounting, marketing, operations, ﬁnance, or management). The DEMO minor program is consid-
ered to be one of the e´lite programs within the business college. Admittance to the MIS minor is
competitive: students must have a 3.0 GPA to be admitted to the program. Students DEMO to be highly
motivated, and recruiters often seek out these students DEMO their top positions. Placement informa-
tion indicates that the majority of the students took positions in the accounting, consulting, and
ﬁnancial services industry DEMO the mid-Atlantic region.
The Team Task
In addition to teaching the basics of systems analysis, an objective of the class is to encourage team-
work and to develop students’ project management skills. The development project used DEMO this
class—where students were charged with not only developing an information system, but also
supervising the development of another team’s system—was a unique approach to educating stu-
dents on the intricacies of the systems development process. DEMO having each student team perform
the roles of developers and managers, DEMO reported that they learned important development
skills, but also understood the DEMO process from the manager’s perspective. They also bet-
ter understood the importance of communicating using models and diagrams, for example, because
managers often DEMO not understand technical jargon. Despite the complexity and added work neces-
sary for students to participate in the project, evaluations of the course—and its learning opportu-
nities—were quite high.
Timeline
Data were collected over a 6-week DEMO in 2000.
Methods
The purpose of this study is to examine the development of reciprocal trust between teams. The nature
of this goal introduced DEMO complexities. Our desire to control for task complexity across teams and
to randomly assign participants to teams suggested the use of an experimental design. DEMO key con-
cerns, however, have been raised about the efﬁcacy of studying trust in a traditional laboratory setting
(Schoorman et al., 1996b)DEMO First, the development of trust may be best studied when repeated DEMO
tions occur over a sustained period of time, so that participants DEMO time to develop a meaningful level
of trust. Second, participants must DEMO engaged in a way that is important and salient to them—i.e., DEMO
trust to matter participants must have something valuable to gain or to lose. For this study, a setting and
methodology was needed that could gain much of the control available in a lab setting while engaging
DEMO teams over a signiﬁcant period of time in a realistic, salient DEMO in which they had a
stake in the outcome.

Project task
THE RECIPROCAL NATURE OF TRUST
633
The task chosen for DEMO study was the development of a system (i.e., a website) DEMO a senior-level infor-
mation systems analysis and design class. Ninety-four advanced undergraduate students in two sec-
tions of a public university in the mid-Atlantic DEMO of the United States participated in this
study. Students were randomly assigned to one of 24 teams: 22 teams consisted of four students
and two consisted of three students. Each team was responsible for both developing DEMO system (devel-
opment role) and supervising the development of a system by another team (management role). Thus,
our sample included 22 separate project team dyads.
We tailored the research design to provide an DEMO conducive to studying trust over time.
The teams were mutually dependent upon one another for success, so each party had something to lose
or gain. Teams were engaged in a signiﬁcant, real project from their perspective, so potential losses and
gains were salient. The environment was as tightly controlled as possible, reducing the effects of extra-
neous variables (e.g., lay-offs, new management). Finally, there was sufﬁcient interaction over a DEMO
longed period of time (approximately 40 days) to develop a meaningful level of inter-team trust. Teams
had both face-to-face interactions and the other DEMO project deliverables to provide information for
evaluating trustworthiness.
The team structure for the class resembled a circle, with a given team (e.g., Team 2) managing
another team (e.g., Team 3) on one project DEMO being managed by yet another team (e.g., Team 1)
on a second project. In its managerial role, a team was responsible for establishing requirements for
the required system and for providing feedback to the DEMO team. In its development role, the
team was charged with fulﬁlling DEMO management team’s requirements by constructing an information
system. The development project lasted about 6 weeks. Four project deliverables were exchanged by
the interacting teams DEMO the course of the project, one every 10 days.
Although a DEMO in the managerial role depended on its development team to produce a technology
solution that met its speciﬁcations, the development team depended on its management team to pro-
vide clear and timely speciﬁcations, accurate feedback on progress, and recognition and rewards for
performance. Each team’s project grade depended in part on the other team’s performance. This ﬁeld
design within a DEMO class provided certain advantages by allowing for a level of control not
available in a corporate setting. Participants were randomly assigned to teams. The DEMO was rela-
tively uniform in terms of experience, such as students’ DEMO knowledge and grade point averages.
The basic interaction between management teams and development teams was standardized across
dyads, which gave each team an equal amount of time to accomplish each project phase.
The management team delivered DEMO requirements document to the development team at T1. The
document outlined the requirements for the project, and was read and assessed by the development
team. At T2, the development team delivered a system prototype to the management team, which
examined it relative to the initial requirements. At T3 the management team delivered a feedback
document to the development team, proposing changes to the system prototype. This feedback docu-
ment was read and DEMO by the developers. Finally, at T4 the development team delivered the DEMO
system. The management team examined the ﬁnal product relative to both the initial requirements and
the change requests from T3.
Our analysis of trust DEMO this ﬂow of project deliverables. As a deliverable is presented from
Team A (which can be either the management or developer team role depending upon the stage of
the project) to Team B, the deliverable DEMO the interactions that transpired between the two teams
as the deliverable was constructed affect Team B’s perceptions of Team A’s ability, benevolence,
and integrity. These Team B beliefs have an immediate impact on Team B’s DEMO, and subsequently
on the risk-taking actions that Team B exhibits (Mayer et al., 1995). Teams submitted their deliverables
at the start of class and the instructors provided time in class for teams to review DEMO discuss the

submitted deliverables. The instructors did not DEMO teams from interacting outside of class. We
instituted a number of steps to mitigate dependence in the responses representing the two roles. For
each DEMO the 24 teams, the instructor identiﬁed which team was being evaluated. DEMO were care-
ful to space out survey administrations to reduce methods bias. Instructors also emphasized to the stu-
dents the importance of completing the DEMO honestly and accurately, since they would be
considered in determining a DEMO ﬁnal project grade.
Our model (Figure 1b) hypothesizes that a team’s actions (in the form of the deliverables and actions
related to the deliverables) inform subsequent perceptions of ability, benevolence, and integrity from
the other team. These trustworthiness perceptions immediately trigger changes in the other team’s DEMO
level, which then affect that team’s RTRs throughout the next stage DEMO the process. Since the delivery of
the requirements document provides an indication of the management team’s initial trustworthiness
(and hence, a basis for DEMO development team’s initial trust in the management team), our model starts
with the development team’s perceptions of the management team’s ability, benevolence, DEMO integrity
after its review of the requirements document. It should be noted that management RTRs at T1 would
have reﬂected management’s monitoring and delegating DEMO leading up to the delivery of this
requirements document—before the development team had been actively involved with the project.
Measures
To measure perceptions of DEMO, benevolence, and integrity, three questions were adapted from pre-
vious DEMO research (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Both management and development teams answered iden-
tical questions with the referents modiﬁed accordingly (see Appendix). For ability, benevolence, and
integrity, each team member responded to questions that asked about that team’s perceptions of these
qualities in the other DEMO Measures of RTRs for the task at hand were developed for this study based
on interviews with systems developers and IT managers. The developer DEMO included formalizing
inter-team procedures and scoping (attempting to control the scope DEMO) the size of the project. Manage-
ment RTRs included delegating and DEMO All scales in this study used a 5-point Likert-type
format with agree–disagree anchors at each scale point. Both management and development teams
completed surveys DEMO a project phase was completed.
The internal validity of the study was bolstered in a number of ways. Data were collected from both
management DEMO and development teams at points that corresponded to the times that either the
management team (T1 and T3) or the development team (T2 and T4) submitted a project deliverable
to its counterpart team. Unlike earlier published research on mutual or reciprocal trust, the longitudinal
and repeated nature of the data collection allowed us to examine the interactive evolution of DEMO
between interdependent teams over a 6-week time period. Our analyses involve both cross-source
and longitudinal relationships. RTR–trustworthiness relationships involve cross-source data. At T2,
DEMO example, RTRs represent a development team’s responses of its actions in DEMO previous time period.
The trustworthiness responses represent the management team’s perceptions of the development team.
Relationships between trust and subsequent RTRs involve longitudinal data, since the perceived trust
at the end of one time period (e.g., T2) should foster action during the subsequent time period (and
therefore measured at the end of T3). This design should mitigate concerns DEMO the effects of com-
mon methods bias.
Reliability and validity estimates were completed using individual level data (n ¼ 94). Correlations
and descriptive statistics are listed in Table 1, along with Cronbach’s alphas. Reliability levels were
acceptable for the most part (i.e., greater than 0.70), DEMO the new formalizing (T2 and T4) and
scoping (T2) RTR scales were lower than expected. Previous studies have recommended a lower relia-
DEMO standard (0.60), however, for exploratory measures (Nunnally, 1978). The lower levels for the

RTRs are likely also due in DEMO to the brevity of the scales. Cronbach’s alpha for the trust scale at T1
was also low, possibly indicating that trust perceptions had not yet been solidiﬁed this early in the pro-
ject. These variables were DEMO, but the reliability levels may reduce our ability to detect relation-
DEMO with these constructs (Nunnally, 1978).
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis was conducted to determine the constructs’ underlying measurement
characteristics at the individual level (Table 2). Because trustworthiness and risk-taking indicators are
likely to covary within DEMO analysis (McKnight, Choudhury, & Kacmar, 2002), we used an oblique
rotation (oblimin direct) to facilitate factor interpretation. Each group of DEMO (trustworthiness,
trust, and RTR) was run in separate analyses DEMO each time period. The KMO (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin)
statistic was included to DEMO the adequacy of our sample for factor analysis: values greater than DEMO
equal to 0.50 are considered acceptable (Chow, 2004; Ferguson, Sanders, O’Hehir, & James, 2000;
Hughes et al., 2003). DEMO KMO levels pass the 0.50 level. We also included Bartlett’s chi square sta-
tistic, which tests the null hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identity matrix and therefore
inappropriate for factor analysis. The null hypothesis DEMO easily rejected for all analyses.
We next examined the magnitude and nature of the factor loadings. Trustworthiness and RTR factor
loadings all exceed accepted DEMO (>0.50). Trust factor loadings are also acceptable, except for
DEMO loading at T4. Based on these results, we conclude that our DEMO, trust, and RTR mea-
sures demonstrate acceptable convergent and discriminant validity.
One of the issues in studying team trust relates to how trust DEMO the group level is best measured. There
are at least three options. The ﬁrst is to allow members of a group to come to DEMO collaborative unanimous
decision, and then answer questions on trust as a DEMO Although this does indeed force a group-level
answer, social inﬂuence issues DEMO domination or coalitions may bias the results. A second commonly
used option is to ask questions at the individual level and subsequently aggregate to DEMO higher level
(Van Der Vegt, Emans, & Vliert, 2001). This technique is problematic as well, however, since the mean
(or median) response may not be a valid indicator of the team’s collective perception. In this latter sce-
nario, valuable information about perceived group beliefs is lost, as a given member may personally hold
one set of beliefs while recognizing that the group itself shares beliefs that differ from DEMO members’.
For measuring shared team properties, a third alternative has been DEMO (Klein & Kozlowski,
2000). Instead of aggregating questions posed DEMO the individual level, this approach recommends wording
questions using the team DEMO the referent, not the individual. Each respondent becomes a data source,DEMO
reporting not on his or her own beliefs, but on what DEMO or she perceives the team to believe. Second, it
is necessary DEMO demonstrate substantial within-group agreement. If these two standards are met, the DEMO
should be aggregated to the team level of analysis to represent the shared team construct. This method of
measuring group attitudes is consistent with DEMO extensive body of literature focused on group potency
(Gibson, 1999) DEMO collective efﬁcacy (Crocker & Luhtanen, 1990; Gibson, 1999; Shamir, 1990).
Consistent with this recommendation (Klein & Kozlowski, 2000), DEMO questions were worded using
the team as the appropriate referent (see DEMO). Next, to determine whether or not the data sample
exhibited DEMO group characteristics, we used two procedures (Table 3): between-group ANOVA
and rwg(j) (Demaree, James, & Wolf, 1984), an indicator of within-group agreement (Currall & Inkpen,
2002). For the ANOVA, 15 of the 22 study constructs indicate signiﬁcant between-group differences
(DEMO < 0.05). Insigniﬁcant ANOVA results, however, may indicate either insufﬁcient variance across
groups or a lack of agreement within groups. Therefore, we also calculated the rwg(j) statistic, which
measures the level of DEMO within a group (Table 3). All levels exceed the 0.70 DEMO, indicat-
ing that team-mates were consistent in their responses within the DEMO This result indicates that the
lack of signiﬁcance of some of the ANOVAs was due to a lack of variance across teams rather than DEMO
lack of team agreement. The data were collected speciﬁcally to be analyzed at the team level and these
analyses supported the aggregation. The data DEMO aggregated to the team level by taking the average
response for all team members.

Results
We ran a separate regression for each DEMO variable in Figure 1(b). The sample size for all regres-
sions was n ¼ 24. Ability, benevolence, and integrity from the DEMO time period were included as inde-
pendent variables for each of the four models predicting trust. This analysis was run as four separate
regressions, one for each time period. The time periods occurred approximately 10 days DEMO A sepa-
rate regression was run for the prediction of each of the three trustworthiness constructs. At T2, for
example, the development team’s DEMO of its formalizing and scoping actions were used to predict
the management team’s perceptions of the development team’s ability, benevolence, and integrity in
DEMO separate models. For each model predicting an RTR, trust from the DEMO time period was
included as an independent variable. These regression models represent longitudinal models, with trust
from one time period predicting each RTR for the next time period, which occurred approximately 10
days later. Analyses for all T3 and T4 models included an additional independent construct. We
included DEMO previous level of the dependent variable to control for pre-existing perceptions. As an
example, the model predicting trust at T3 includes the trust level at T1 as an independent construct.
The strengths of the relationships are DEMO in Table 4.
The prediction of trust
Hypothesis 1 predicts that the three trustworthiness factors will signiﬁcantly predict trust in the coun-
terpart team. DEMO the development team’s trust in management (T1 and T3), integrity’s DEMO
increased from insigniﬁcance at T1 to being highly signiﬁcant at T3. Benevolence was actually nega-
tively related to trust at T1, but teams may have little basis for the perception this early in the project
(T1) (Mayer et al., 1995). Benevolence subsequently drops to insigniﬁcance at T3. For both teams’
trust perceptions, ability is a consistently strong predictor of trust. Both teams apparently became more
task-oriented as the project progressed, as evidenced by the relative importance of ability at T3 and T4
DEMO benevolence and integrity. Thus, nine out of the possible 12 predictors DEMO the two teams’
perspectives across the four waves of data collection are signiﬁcant in the hypothesized direction, pro-
viding support for Hypothesis 1. We also note that while previous levels of trust were added for the DEMO
and T4 analysis, controlling for previous perceptions apparently had little effect. DEMO was insignif-
icant at T3, and somewhat signiﬁcant at T4.

able was signiﬁcant at T3. In contrast, scoping DEMO strongly related to trust at both T1 and T3, but the
DEMO control variable at T3 was insigniﬁcant. In predicting management actions, trust DEMO strongly
related to delegating, but not to monitoring. This result provides DEMO evidence that some management
and development risk-taking behaviors were a function of their trust in the other team.
The prediction of reciprocal trust
Hypothesis DEMO embodies the concept of reciprocal trust, since it predicts that one DEMO actions will
affect the other team’s beliefs about the ﬁrst team’s trustworthiness. To test this hypothesis, the rela-
tionships between Team A’s risk-taking behaviors and Team B’s perception of Team A’s ability, ben-
evolence, and DEMO perceptions were examined. For the T3 and T4 analyses, we again DEMO
constructs (ability, benevolence, and integrity at T1 and T2, respectively) to control for previous per-
ceptions of trustworthiness.
We tested whether developer risk-taking actions were related to management’s perceptions of devel-
opment team trustworthiness DEMO T2 and T4. Formalizing was strongly related to benevolence and integ-
rity perceptions at T2. Developer efforts at scoping were negatively related to integrity DEMO T2, but only
weakly related to integrity at T4. At T4, however, scoping was a signiﬁcant predictor of ability and
benevolence. We note that for all the T4 analyses previous levels for the trustworthiness constructs
DEMO all highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001), indicating that the previous DEMO of trustworthiness were
the primary predictors.
We also tested whether management’s actions (RTRs) were related to the development team’s per-
ceptions of management DEMO trustworthiness at T3. Delegation had a negative relationship with all
three trustworthiness perceptions (ability, benevolence, and integrity), but the relationship with ability
was especially strong. Monitoring had the strongest effect on benevolence, but had a strong negative
relationship with all three trustworthiness constructs. The variables controlling DEMO previous actions
were again signiﬁcant, but were not as strong as DEMO developer results at T3. Previous levels of integrity
were marginally signiﬁcant, DEMO indicating that integrity is driven more by management behaviors
(monitoring and DEMO) than previous perceptions. These results indicate that the teams’ actions
were DEMO to its counterpart’s beliefs about trustworthiness, and therefore support Hypothesis 3.1
DEMO
This study makes three primary contributions to research on trust. First, DEMO research answers the call to
extend research on trust to the group level of analysis (Schoorman et al., 1996b). Interacting teams
are DEMO fact of organizational life and, given the important role that trust DEMO play in organizational
1We conducted non-parametric Komolgorov–Smirnoff tests on all 45 variables in the study. None of the results was signiﬁcant,
indicating that DEMO of the distributions were signiﬁcantly non-normal. Of the 45 variables under study, only management
benevolence at wave 4 had any signiﬁcant outliers. We removed the two outliers from this variable and reran the associated
regressions. The DEMO coefﬁcients remained relatively stable, although several of the signiﬁcance levels declined DEMO
Given that outliers were at issue in only 2 per cent of the study’s variables and that the magnitude of the effects on the DEMO
involved was sporadic and modest, for consistency we opted to stay DEMO the original data as reported by the teams without
exclusion of the outliers.

effectiveness, advances in the understanding of how trust can be built or eroded in the team environ-
ment DEMO prove valuable to organizations and managers. This research proposes and ﬁnds support
for the assertion that trust at the team level will act similarly DEMO terms of its antecedents and conse-
quences to trust at the interpersonal level, thus extending the Mayer et al. (1995) model of trust to
the intergroup level of analysis. In addition, this research addresses the different ways that trust at
the group level of analysis could be DEMO, and approaches the issue consistent with past research
on groups that DEMO individual respondents to assess their perceptions of the group’s beliefs.
Second, DEMO research develops and tests several new measures of risk-taking behavior speciﬁc to
interacting project teams, facilitating future research in this domain. Although these measures were
studied using student teams, a condition that was necessary given the control we sought in this
research, we believe that these constructs may be applicable outside of the educational environment.
Both development and management team DEMO were shown to be related to trust. We also found
that these behaviors had implications for how they were perceived by their counterpart team. DEMO
tually appropriate measures of risk-taking behaviors are apparently an important tool for understand-
ing the ongoing development of trust in any environment. This research DEMO this fact, and
provides four speciﬁc types of risk-taking behaviors that DEMO be utilized in research in project man-
agement environments.
Finally, and DEMO signiﬁcantly, our results support our central proposition that changes in trust DEMO
time may occur as part of a cyclical (or reciprocal) process. The behavioral consequences (risk-related
actions) of trust on the part of DEMO team have consequences, since they appear to affect the second
team’s DEMO of the ﬁrst team’s trustworthiness, and then subsequently the second team’s DEMO
risk-related actions. This process continues for as long as the parties interact. Our tests for reciprocal
trust were largely successful. In T2, T3, DEMO T4, risk-taking actions were signiﬁcantly related to the
other team’s trustworthiness DEMO, which in turn affected trust and risk-taking behaviors. This
pattern of DEMO and reaction held true as management and development teams interacted throughout
the duration of the project. Ultimately, no study can prove causality, and DEMO current research is no
exception. We do note, however, that the pattern of relationships among the variables is quite consis-
tent with the DEMO model despite the small sample size.
Practical implications
The importance of context (e.g., the stage of development of the team) was evident throughout this
study. For the reciprocal trust results, for example, the development DEMO attempts to control project
scope at T2 were negatively related to integrity. At the same time, actions that formalized the process
were positively related to integrity and benevolence. Neither scoping nor formalizing was related to
ability. DEMO teams apparently interpreted early efforts by the development team to structure
the process as an indication that they cared about the management team and DEMO complete the pro-
ject as promised. At T4, however, formalizing actions were no longer related to trustworthiness, but
scoping actions were signiﬁcantly related to all three trustworthiness dimensions. In contrast with T2,
the negative DEMO with ability was especially strong. These results indicate that by the end of the
project developers’ attempts to reduce the size of the project DEMO have been interpreted by manage-
ment as excuses for a lack of competence. Thus, one team’s interpretation of the other team’s actions
appears to depend on when the actions occurred during the project’s evolution. These results DEMO
score the previously discussed importance of tracking not only behaviors, as DEMO common in game the-
ory research, but also perceptions of the DEMO party and trust.
In another example, we expected that delegation by DEMO management team would signal a level
of trust in the developer team and would be positively received. Indeed, there was a strong positive

relationship between the management teams’ trust DEMO the developer teams and management’s subse-
quent delegating behavior. The reaction of the development teams to the delegating was decidedly
negative on their perceptions DEMO the management teams’ trustworthiness, however, suggesting that
delegation may have been interpreted by the developers as an abdication of responsibility on manage-
ment’s DEMO rather than a demonstration of trust (Leana, 1986; Schriesheim, Neider, & Scandura,
1998). It would appear that the management teams needed to more carefully communicate the inten-
tions behind their actions to DEMO clear that the delegation was driven by their trust in the developers.
Further research to tease out the effects of the context and communications DEMO the teams on sub-
sequent reactions is clearly needed.
Strengths, limitations, and conclusion
To increase the internal validity of this research we designed DEMO study that had features of both laboratory
and ﬁeld studies. Both designs have their relative advantages and disadvantages. Laboratory studies
provide good control, but tend to lack the longer-term relationships and also the salient risk to DEMO par-
ties that are both important to study trust effectively. Conversely, DEMO settings provide these rich con-
textual factors, but tend to be DEMO to alternative explanations due to the lack of control over extraneous
inﬂuences. The current research employed a controlled ﬁeld study that enabled random assignment DEMO
groups and control over many factors such as the difﬁculty of the projects and the time allowed for
project completion. At the same time, the study provided a task in which the teams were interdependent,
DEMO something of value at stake (a grade), and interacted over DEMO considerable period of time (6 weeks).
This research was conducted DEMO a student sample, which in many instances raises issues of
generalizability. DEMO research has argued, for example, that college students have a weak deﬁnition
of self, have less established attitudes, and are more easily DEMO (Sears, 1986). Two factors may
help reduce these generalizability concerns for our particular research. First, this research was conducted
with senior-level undergraduates who were familiar with the task domain (systems analysis and design),DEMO
who would be working in such an environment in the near future, and who had meaningful performance
metrics (grades) directly tied to their project performance. Second, the primary purpose of this research
was not to extrapolate our results to real project teams (where generalizability concerns might best be
categorized as those involving external validity), but rather to study DEMO evolution of reciprocal trust
between teams, a phenomenon that we believe DEMO reasonably be studied with student groups (Mook,
1983). Our DEMO size was also small (N ¼ 24), but not unusual DEMO research involving teams. We encou-
rage other studies to replicate our results with larger samples in different contexts.
The longitudinal nature of our study DEMO insights that would not be possible with either a cross-
sectional or a traditional laboratory design. Not only did this research demonstrate that one DEMO trust
levels can change between teams (i.e., through an action–reaction cycle), but it also allowed us to
examine how time can serve DEMO a contextual variable, where actions may be interpreted differently
depending on DEMO like the stage of a project. The number of signiﬁcant relationships in our model
is particularly remarkable given the limited number of groups being DEMO (n ¼ 24 teams). Despite
support for our model of DEMO trust, it should be noted that reciprocal trust is not the DEMO as a
systematic evolution of trust, where trust continues to build DEMO erode over time. Such systematic evolu-
tion may be inﬂuenced by a number of other factors in addition to reciprocal trust, such as changes in
the workplace or job structure, changes in personal needs, new DEMO on trustees, and changes in
other relationships that inﬂuence the focus DEMO Thus, while reciprocity may be necessary for
the systematic evolution of DEMO, it does not guarantee it.
This study provides rare evidence of DEMO trust—a phenomenon that is difﬁcult to observe
given the complexities of gathering longitudinal observations in a reasonably controlled environment.

These results indicate that reciprocal trust DEMO additional study. Future research should explore
how other contextual variables may inﬂuence trust formation between interacting parties. As an exam-
ple, while we focus on the effects of actions driving trust, other factors—e.g., environmental factors—
DEMO also be examined. In addition, studies which encompass group interaction characteristics—such
DEMO the frequency and types of communications between members—may also be informative. Factors
such as power and status differences between the interacting parties may also DEMO a signiﬁcant role on
trust formation and change over time. Research on reciprocal trust may also beneﬁt from complemen-
tary theories such as attribution DEMO, Ferrin and Dirks (2003) and Korsgaard, Brodt, and
Whitener (2002)—which may provide insights about how perceptions of trustworthiness are formed.
DEMO, as mentioned earlier, the extension of an interpersonal model of trust to the domain of inter-
team trust creates new opportunities for multilevel DEMO, an important step for gaining a full the-
oretical understanding of DEMO in the future.
