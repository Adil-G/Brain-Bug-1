ABSTRACT
This research examines the roles that an entrepreneurs dispositions to interpersonal trust, and
vigilance play in the process of opportunity recognition.  An entrepreneurs use of social networks as a
resource in opportunity recognition is also examined.  The basis of this investigation was an empirical
study of information and communication technology (ICT) entrepreneurs in Queensland, Australia.  DEMO
series of twelve hypotheses were developed and tested in this research.  DEMO a modest sample size
support was found for six of the hypothesised relationships.  An entrepreneurs disposition to both trust and
vigilance were found effect the outcomes of their opportunity identification behaviours.  A disposition to
excess vigilance inhibited the development of entrepreneurial opportunities.  While, an extended social
network DEMO a trusting disposition were seen to facilitate the development of entrepreneurial opportunities.
INTRODUCTION
The attempt to identify a specific set of characteristics or to DEMO the psychological profile of a
successful entrepreneur has proved fruitless (Smilor, 1997).  As a result, recent progress in
entrepreneurship research has DEMO focus (Gartner, 1988; Low & MacMillan, 1988) from arguments
DEMO on an entrepreneurial “type”, to studies of the processes which enable DEMO entrepreneurship
phenomenon (Ucbasaran et al., 2001), such as opportunity recognition (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
One approach to opportunity recognition that DEMO starting to attract attention is based in theories of
social capital (DEMO & Honig, 2003; Senjem & Reed, 2002), and social DEMO (Hills et al., 1997;
Hoang & Young, 2000; Singh, 2000; Singh et al., 1999).  Eckhard and Shane (2003) suggest that the reason
for this is that the link between explanations for how people discover opportunities and how they use social
capital to DEMO problems of information asymmetry and uncertainty is more readily facilitated by an
opportunity-based explanation of entrepreneurship rather than in a human-type explanation.  In addition,
the empirical research on opportunity recognition based in social networks has DEMO supported the
theory (Hills et al., 1997; Singh, 2000; DEMO et al., 1999)
If we take the social perspective of DEMO  Within their individual businesses, industry
sectors, or as part of DEMO wider economic community, entrepreneurs are recognised as more than atomistic
economic DEMO; as the context in which they act is embedded in a DEMO of social relations (Aldrich &
Zimmer, 1986).  This argument for social embeddedness requires that the study of economic activity must
include DEMO examination of the social context within which economic action occurs (Hoang & Young, 2000),
since the social dimensions of transactions are central in explaining control and coordination in the
exchange (Larson, 1992).
DEMO, trust is not a term which is widely used in the DEMO which examines the economics of
organisation; rather, the focus is on contracting and exchange relationships between self-interested agents
(Miller, 2001).  Though it has been recognised that trust has real, practical, economic value DEMO it is seen to
1
increase the efficiency of the economic system (Arrow, 1974).  In fact, as Dibben (2000) points out, trust is
crucial to DEMO development of small business, and organisational emergence.
Previous research has examined DEMO by employing small business as the setting (Dibben, 2000),
DEMO this research aims to explain the processes of entrepreneurship by focusing on trust.  While the
role that trust plays in entrepreneurial networks has received some theoretical attention (Burt, 1999; Das &
Teng, 1998; DEMO, 1992; Uzzi, 1997); there is a distinct lack of DEMO investigating the relationship
between trust and the specific process of opportunity recognition within entrepreneurship.  It is this gap in
the literature that this research seeks to address.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Entrepreneurship has been defined as the discovery, evaluation and exploitation of future goods and
services (Venkataraman, 1997).  A process which is characterised by the pursuit of opportunity (Stevenson
& Jarillo, 1990).  Consequently, an entrepreneur is someone who recognises an opportunity and creates a
new venture to pursue it (Bygrave & Hofer, 1991).
Eckhardt and Shane (2003) define entrepreneurial opportunities as “situations in which new goods,
services, raw materials, markets and organizing DEMO can be introduced through the formation of new
means, ends, or means-ends relationships.”  They exist because different agents have different beliefs
about the relative value of resources when they are converted from inputs into outputs (Kirzner, 1979;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
In describing the DEMO of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition Ardichvili et al. (2003) delineate
three sequential elements: opportunity identification, opportunity development, and opportunity evaluation.
Their model outlines that the initiation or identification of an opportunity, may be through either of three
distinct processes: perception, discovery or creation (Ardichvili et al., 2003).  This is followed by a
development phase which is DEMO as a “continuous, proactive process essential to the formation of a
DEMO  The third element in their model, evaluation, is included as DEMO continuous overarching process of
interrogation of the opportunity which seeks to identify “suboptimally deployed resources” (Ardichvili et
al., 2003). This research focuses DEMO the first two steps in the Ardichvili et al. (2003) model – identification
and development.
Opportunity Identification
Opportunity identification has been proposed as DEMO process which begins with an initial vision, or
business idea, and develops this into an elaborated vision, or business opportunity (Long & DEMO,
1984).  Ardichvili et al. (2003) say that “opportunities DEMO as simple concepts that become more
elaborate as entrepreneurs develop them.”  DEMO (2000) supports a developmental version of opportunity
recognition as a linear process, saying “before business opportunities are recognised, new business ideas
must DEMO identified.”  Both Singh (2000) and, Long and McMullan’s (1984) approaches, where the concept
of a business idea is different from a business opportunity, are essentially consistent with the one proposed
by Ardichvili et al. (2003).  Timmons (1994) summation is “the centre of DEMO opportunity is always an idea,
but not all ideas are opportunities.”
Where a business idea consists of the initial creative cognition (Krueger Jr., 2000), perhaps derived
from prior experience (Shane, 2000), or information accessed through social channels (Singh, 2000); the
business opportunity, has been in some way assessed to be a potentially viable new DEMO  In other
words, the business opportunity is a screened (Timmons, 1994), evaluated (Ardichvili et al., 2003), or
elaborated (Long & McMullan, 1984) business idea, that is both desirable and feasible (Christensen et al.,
1994).  However, as Singh (2000) points out, at this stage of the process “opportunity is independent of
resources controlled.”  Thus, the concept of a “business opportunity” lies somewhere DEMO initial idea
identification and the complete development of the opportunity as an emerging entrepreneurial venture.
Opportunity Development
The next logical step in the process DEMO an increased level of commitment to the development of the
business opportunity.  This is evidenced by assembling the resources required to exploit the value in the
opportunity.  In this sense, as the entrepreneur seeks to DEMO the business opportunity, they take the
decision to “pursue the opportunity.”  The entrepreneur starts to formalise their opportunity through the
creation of a DEMO business venture.  The goal is to take advantage of the opportunity (Singh, 2000).
2
Change and adaptation are accepted as integral components in the entrepreneurial process (Brazeal
& Herbert, 1999), and changes to opportunities may facilitated by changing perceptions (Krueger Jr.,
2000).  It is in this DEMO that an entrepreneurs social context is important; as they access the DEMO
and critical feedback, available through their social network, in order to assess their developing opportunity
and adapt it if need be.
Social Networks
DEMO important way that people gain access to information is through interaction with other people
(Shane, 2003).  Therefore, one of the ways DEMO people gain access to information about entrepreneurial
opportunities is through their social network.  Social networks allow access to different human skills and
knowledge, DEMO enables the entrepreneur to learn from others experience.  Busenitz et al. (2003) points
out that entrepreneurs become alert and develop knowledge by making deliberate informational
investments (Fiet, 1996) that others do not in order to create a coherent view of opportunity  Thus, the
information flows DEMO members of an entrepreneurial network are important to opportunity
identification and development.  It is the access to an increased level of information available through a
larger social network that has been theorised to be the main DEMO (Hills et al., 1997). Empirical evidence
supports this theory (DEMO, 2000).
De Koning (1999) found that an entrepreneurs information DEMO activities were influenced by
their social context, particularly through a network DEMO includes “close and trusted friends.”  Davidsson
and Honig (2003) identified DEMO the presence of strong or trusted ties in the social networks of nascent
entrepreneurs influenced their level perseverance in pursuit of their venture formation DEMO (Hoang &
Antoncic, 2003). Of particular interest to this DEMO, and its focus on opportunity recognition, is the fact
that a social network governance based in trust, is seen to “affect the depth and richness of exchange
relations, particularly with respect to the exchange of information” (Hoang & Antoncic, 2003).
Interpersonal Trust
Trust has been DEMO a “lubricant for co-operation” (Arrow, 1974), and is considered necessary for
understanding interpersonal and group behaviour as well as economic exchange (Hosmer, 1995).  Trust
constitutes an important source of social capital (Kramer, 1999).  Trust may be manifested as a
commitment to an DEMO before knowing how the other person will behave (Burt, 1999). Lewicki et al.
(1998) called trust a “foundation” for interpersonal relationships, and for cooperation. Trust seen as a
foundation for the exchange of DEMO in interpersonal relationships, would underscore the importance
of an investigation of DEMO role in the process opportunity recognition.
Some have assumed that trust, DEMO a general sense, equates to gullibility (Jones, 1996).  This
interpretation of trust, as a form of gullibility, shows that trust DEMO different things to different people.
These differences are born out in the research on trust, which is relatively diverse and multidisciplinary
(Dirks & DEMO, 2001; Lewicki et al., 1998).  Rousseau et al. (DEMO) summarise the interdisciplinary
differences, between the economics, psychological, and sociological views of trust.  “Economists tend to
view trust as calculative” (Williamson, 1993); as a rational choice between the risks and benefits of
DEMO, which is often expressed as the probability of cooperation.  The discipline of psychology frames
trust in terms of the “attributes of trustors and DEMO and focuses upon a host of internal cognitions that
personal attributes yield” (Rotter, 1967; Rousseau et al., 1998).  While sociologists view trust as socially
embedded properties of relationships among people (Granovetter, 2000)DEMO
Trust has been defined as “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability
based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of DEMO (Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau
et al., 1998).  DEMO Rousseau et al. (1998) discuss trust, they find common ground DEMO scholars from
various fields.  According to their definition trust entails three DEMO properties: a “willingness to be
vulnerable” (Kramer, 1999) an “involvement of risk” (Das & Teng, 1998) and thirdly “interdependence”
(Mayer DEMO al., 1995; Sheppard & Sherman, 1998).  This definition is mirrored by Kramer (1999) who states
“perceived vulnerability or risk” in DEMO to “others on whom they depend” are the elements of the
psychological state of trust.
It is apparent, that when entrepreneurs involve others in the development of their business
opportunity, this involves some level of risk.  The risk is that the information they share regarding that
opportunity, DEMO forms the essence of their entrepreneurial endeavour, may be used opportunistically DEMO
3
those others with whom they share it.  Reynolds (1991) compares this social risk, with the market risk of
business creation, and frames DEMO thus: “it is quite likely that potential entrepreneurs find it more DEMO
to take the risks of starting new firms when the major dangers are associated with the marketplace, not the
risk that a friend or associate will attempt to take advantage of them at a very vulnerable DEMO  On the
other hand, Uzzi (1996) suggests that an advantage of trust is that it facilitates fine-grained information
transfer.  Fine-grained information, DEMO be of particular use in identifying entrepreneurial opportunity.
Thus, an entrepreneurs DEMO towards trusting others would effect both the identification and
development of opportunity.
Dispositional Trust
There is empirical evidence that people have a general predisposition DEMO trust (Gurtman, 1992), and
that is it a relatively stable personality characteristic (Kramer, 1999).  Rotter (1980) defines dispositional
trust as "a generalised expectancy held by an individual that the word, DEMO, oral or written statement of
another individual or group can be DEMO upon."  It is in the case where people do not have experience, or
have little experience of each other, or where they DEMO in ambiguous situations where dispositional trust
explains their trusting behaviour most accurately (McKnight et al., 1998; Rotter, 1980).
Entrepreneurial social networks DEMO be dynamic (Greve & Salaff, 2003), and the context in which
they are formed and function may be ambiguous (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).  Coupled with the view
that entrepreneurial opportunities may have DEMO windows” (Busenitz et al., 2003).  It would be sensible
DEMO dispositional trust, be included in any consideration of entrepreneurial networks, and their role in
opportunity recognition.
Distrust and Dispositional Vigilance
Recently, organisational researchers consider that it is possible for trust and distrust to co-exist
simultaneously (Lewicki et al., 1998; Wicks et al., 1998).  Lewicki DEMO al. (1998) found that while
“incentives to collaborate and trust certainly exist, there are simultaneous reasons to distrust relationship
partners.”  Wicks et DEMO (1998) go further to say that a mixture of trust and distrust, is in fact “optimal”,
and that this should be the focus of research.  Smilor (1997) states that “effective entrepreneurs take
calculated risks”.  Entrepreneurs, it would seem, endeavour to strike a optimal balance between risk and
trust, they are not prepared to risk “everything” and thus trust completely.  It follows, then, that there is
need to include distrust in the analysis of trusts role in entrepreneurship.
The conceptualisation DEMO trust and distrust, as a two factor model, has been supported by empirical
evidence (Markoczy, 2003), which has shown that trust DEMO are separate and distinct from distrust
beliefs, and that trust and DEMO cannot be reduced to opposite ends of a continuum (Robinson et DEMO,
1991).  It may be the case that distrust has DEMO very real beneficial outcomes, in sense of guarding against
opportunism (Elangovan & Shapiro, 1998), as trust by itself does not guarantee trustworthy behaviour
(McEvily et al., 2003).  Thus, a sense of DEMO, vigilance, or distrust (Kramer, 1999), is something that
should be accounted for in the same manner as the beneficial outcomes of DEMO trust.
Kaish and Gilad (1991) found that entrepreneurs paid special attention to risk cues about new
opportunities.  Thus, an entrepreneurs disposition to DEMO would likely effect their assessment of
information relating to business opportunity.
Dispositional Trust, Vigilance and Social Networks role in Opportunity Identification
In examining the effect of trust or vigilance on opportunity identification, the evidence of clearly
established relationships between these constructs is ambiguous.  Sarasvathy et al.’s (2003a) analysis of the
psychological aspects of entrepreneurship, acknowledged that the issue of trust is an “area of theoretical
discontent.”  Their summation calls for a balance between the opposing views of trust and distrust: where
people are seen as having undue predispositions to either self-interest, or altruism (Sarasvathy DEMO al., 2003).
Some researchers have characterised entrepreneurs as disposed to DEMO (de Vries, 1996).  In
examining entrepreneurship, de Vries’s (DEMO) empirical research found that a need for control, and a sense
of distrust were common themes.  Smilor (1997) states that entrepreneurs possess a desire for control, as
they seek to determine their own destinies.  Given the entrepreneurs predilection towards controlling their
destiny, they may be DEMO towards higher levels of vigilance, and potentially lower levels of trust (Das
& Teng, 1998).
4
An alternate perspective is that an overarching disposition to distrust is detrimental DEMO
entrepreneurship (Granovetter, 2000).  With respect to entrepreneurs and their DEMO networks Granovetter
(2000) found that “one of the most powerful and obvious impediments to economic activities is a pervasive
mistrust of others.” Though DEMO (2000) concedes that trust is often limited in the conduct of
business.
What is likely though, is that aspects of both of these viewpoints are true.  Gurtman (1992)
concluded that dispositional extremes of DEMO distrust or trust are associated with interpersonal difficulties.
Therefore, balanced dispositions DEMO trust and vigilance should be of most benefit the exchange of
information, and access to opportunities in entrepreneurial social networks.  However, these relationships
need to be tested.  Drawing on these findings, and previous discussions DEMO literature relating to opportunity
recognition, and interpersonal trust the following four DEMO are proposed:
Hypothesis 1a: The number of business ideas recognised DEMO an entrepreneur is associated with their
disposition to trust.
Hypothesis 1b:
The number of business ideas recognised by an entrepreneur is associated with DEMO
disposition to vigilance.
Hypothesis 1c:
The number of business opportunities recognised by an entrepreneur is associated with
their disposition to trust.
Hypothesis 1d:DEMO
The number of business opportunities recognised by an entrepreneur is associated with
their disposition to vigilance.
Hills et al. (1997) found that entrepreneurs DEMO accessed social channels in order to identify
business ideas reported significantly more ideas than those entrepreneurs who did so in isolation.  Singh
(2000) undertook an in depth empirical study examining the opportunity recognition characteristics of
DEMO ICT entrepreneurs, finding that the larger social network an entrepreneur maintained, the more
business ideas they would identify (Singh, 2000).  Based on informational theories of entrepreneurial
opportunity recognition (Kirzner, 1979), and DEMO on the findings of Hills et al. (1997) and Singh
(DEMO), the following hypotheses are proposed:
Hypothesis 2a: The number DEMO business ideas recognised by an entrepreneur is positively associated with
the size of their social network.
Hypothesis 2b: The number of business opportunities recognised by an entrepreneur is positively
associated with the size of their social DEMO
Dispositional Trust, Vigilance and Social Networks role in Opportunity Development
Considering DEMO trust, and vigilance in relation to the development of entrepreneurial
opportunities, arguments may be drawn that a disposition toward higher trust, in the absence of excess
vigilance would encourage the pursuit and development of entrepreneurial DEMO  Lewicki et al.
(1998) proposes this; and identified that a combination of high trust and low distrust, and consequently low
vigilance, DEMO to the pursuit of opportunities.
It has also been argued that trust in its broadest sense is simply having confidence in the realisation
of DEMO expectations (Luhmann, 1979).  In this manner, a disposition toward trust may be linked with the
pursuit of opportunity.  Such that the entrepreneur in pursuing an opportunity, takes the decision to realise
their expectations.  However, a disposition to excess vigilance, and wariness, may be DEMO to inhibit the
active pursuit of opportunities.
Similarly, an excessively vigilant DEMO may affect the entrepreneurs willingness to take on
feedback with which to adapt their opportunity.  While a disposition toward trust may result in an openness
toward taking on feedback regarding ways to adapt an opportunity.  However, these inferences drawn from
the literature, must be tested.  Thus, DEMO relation to findings from the literatures of opportunity recognition,
and interpersonal trust, the following four hypotheses are proposed:
Hypothesis 3a:
The number of business opportunities pursued by an entrepreneur is positively associated
with DEMO disposition to trust.
5
Hypothesis 3b: The number of business opportunities pursued by an entrepreneur is negatively associated
with their disposition to vigilance.
Hypothesis 3c: The level of change in a business opportunity prior to firm founding is positively
associated DEMO an entrepreneurs disposition to trust.
Hypothesis 3d: The level of change DEMO a business opportunity prior to firm founding is negatively
associated with an entrepreneurs disposition to vigilance.
It is likely to be the case that DEMO with larger social networks access more support, and
other resources with DEMO to actively pursue opportunities.  Hills et al. (1997) found that DEMO
entrepreneurs pursued more opportunities than solo entrepreneurs.  The reasoning here is, with access to
more information through their social networks, with which to identify opportunities, the network
entrepreneur would have more opportunities from which to choose as being worth pursuing.  Singh’s
(2000) empirical work also found a positive relationship between the size of an entrepreneurs social
network and DEMO number of opportunities that they pursued.  Drawing on these findings, and previous
discussions of opportunity recognition, and social networks the following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 4a: The number of business opportunities pursued by an entrepreneur is positively associated
with the size of their social network.
De DEMO (1999) found that entrepreneurs used extensive networks to assist the evolution of their
business opportunities.  Thus, it is also likely that entrepreneurs DEMO adapt their opportunity further as they
take on more information, through DEMO larger social network.  This follows a similar line of reasoning to DEMO
argument above, regarding the pursuit of opportunities.  In this sense the entrepreneur accesses feedback
from their social network with which to develop their DEMO  The following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 4b: The level of change in a business opportunity prior to firm founding is positively
associated DEMO the size of an entrepreneurs social network.
METHODS
Research Design
This research was designed as a cross-sectional study.  The data for this study were collected using
an online self-report questionnaire.  For reasons of practicality, an DEMO across industries, and an
examination of their effects, was reasoned to be beyond the scope of this research.  The information and
communications technology (ICT) industry in Queensland, Australia was chosen as an appropriate setting
for the investigation of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, as it is predominated by small businesses
displaying entrepreneurial attitudes towards growth (Queensland Department of State Development and
Innovation, 2003).
Sample
The sample population for this study was drawn from the Queensland ICT Products and Services
Guide (Information Industries Bureau, 2004).  The products and services guide, is an online database,
which lists the details of over 500 Queensland ICT companies.  The chief executive officers of these ICT
companies formed the target sample for DEMO study.
Of the 571 directors of Queensland based ICT companies invited to participate in the study, 78
survey responses submitted.  Of the 78 DEMO surveys received 9 were deemed to not meet validation
criteria, as DEMO respondents were either were not founders of their business (7 respondents), were
franchisees (1 respondent), or were not responsible for the DEMO of new business ideas (1 respondent).
A further 6 responses DEMO not contain complete survey forms.  As such 63 valid and complete DEMO survey
responses were received from ICT entrepreneurs.  Which corresponded to a DEMO rate of 11.0 percent.
These 63 responses formed the basis of all analyses.
Ancillary data on the number of firms located within in each DEMO 10 geographic regions across
Queensland was cross-tabulated with that from which survey responses were received.  A Pearson Chi-
Square test indicated that there was no significant non-response bias (F = 0.363, χ2(9, 642) DEMO 6.19, p =
6
0.720), with each region represented in similar proportion between the original DEMO frame and the
survey responses received.
Survey Instrument
The design of the questionnaire drew heavily on the work of Singh (2000) who developed DEMO
instrument to measure both entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, and social network characteristics.  A
number of other published sources were adapted and used in the DEMO of measurement scales.
Validity was established by using these pre-existing, validated, measurement scales, where possible, and
framing them in the context of DEMO research.  The survey also established internal validity, by using a series
questions to screen the respondents, as being part of the target sample of “entrepreneurs”, from those who
were not.
Prior to administering the final survey instrument, it was pre-tested.  This pre-testing allowed the
assessment of DEMO reliability for the various measurement instruments in the survey questionnaire,
particularly the newly adapted trust and vigilance scales.  Data from the pre-test survey was used to
calculate reliability statistics for all multiple item measures.  Survey items which reduced the internal
consistency of the scale, were either modified to improve clarity, or removed from the final instrument.
Dependent Variables
Four variables were conceptualised for the entrepreneurial opportunity identification and
development construct (Ardichvili et al., 2003).  Two variables measured the opportunity identification
construct: the number of business ideas recognised, and the number of business opportunities recognised.
Another two variables were used to measure the development of opportunity: the number of opportunities
pursued, and the change to an opportunity.  DEMO four of these variables were based on measures developed
in previous studies of opportunity recognition (Hills, 1995; Singh, 2000).
Business Ideas, Business Opportunities, Opportunities Pursued: The three variables which
quantified the number DEMO ideas recognised, opportunities recognised, and the opportunities pursued, were
measured DEMO three survey items each.  These three items asked the respondent to DEMO their
opportunity recognition over three time periods: the previous month, the past year, and the past 5 years.
The responses were originally measured using a 7 element ordinal-scale, which ranged from no
opportunities recognised, DEMO to 10 or more opportunities.  The responses were coded as 0 DEMO “no
opportunities”; 1 for “one opportunity”; 2 for “two opportunities”; DEMO for “three opportunities”; 4.5 for
“between four and five opportunities”; 7.5 for “between six and nine opportunities”, and 10 for “ten or
more opportunities”.  Composite scales for the business ideas recognised, opportunities recognised,
DEMO pursued, were then computed as the arithmetic mean of the 3 DEMO indicator items measured
over the previous month, year and five years.  Consequently values for these three opportunity recognition
variables ranged from 0 to DEMO  The Cronbach alpha reliability scores for these measures were: business
ideas α = 0.86; business opportunities α = 0.90; opportunities pursued α DEMO 0.85.
Change to Opportunity: The change to an opportunity was measured DEMO two questions in the
survey, which asked “How much did you DEMO your opportunity?” With the context of the change
between first having the idea for the current business and the recognition that this was DEMO business
opportunity.  As well as the change between the recognition of DEMO business opportunity and founding the
firm to purse that opportunity.  The DEMO for these two questions were measured using a 5 element
Likert-scale, DEMO was coded as, 1 for “no change”; 2 for “slight change”; 3 for “moderate change”; 4
for “major change”; and 5 for “completely changed”.  As with other composite measures the arithmetic
mean was used to aggregate the coded responses, resulting in a measure which ranged from 1 to 5.  The
Cronbach alpha reliability score for this measure was α = 0.70.
Independent Variables
Dispositional Trust: The measurement of the dispositional trust variable used 8 items adapted from
scales used in prior studies DEMO measured generalised dispositional trust (Rotter, 1967; Wrightsman,
1964; Yamagishi, 1992), framing them in an entrepreneurship context, where possible. Questions DEMO
“Based on your experience, please respond to the following statements”, and listed a number of statements
about trust and responses were measured using DEMO 5 element Likert-scale, from “strongly disagree” to
strongly agree”, which were coded from 1 to 5, respectively.  Five items in this adapted DEMO were
drawn from the Rotters (1967) Interpersonal Trust Scale; one DEMO drawn from Wrightsmans’ (1964)
7
Philosophies of Human Nature Scale; and two were drawn from Yamagishis’ (DEMO) adaptation of the
original trust scale developed by Rotter (1967).  These source items were chosen for this research as their
validity and reliability had been previously established (Wrightsman, 1991; Yamagishi et al., DEMO).  The
Cronbach alpha reliability score for this measure was α DEMO 0.73.
Dispositional Vigilance: The measurement of the dispositional vigilance variable used DEMO items
adapted from scales used in prior studies (Currall & Judge, 1995; Yamagishi, 1992).  Two items were
drawn from Yamagishis’ (DEMO) vigilance scale, and the third was adapted from an instrument developed
by Currall and Judge (1995).
Social Network Size: The size DEMO an entrepreneurs social network, was operationalised as the number
of social DEMO they had discussed their opportunity with prior to founding their firm.  DEMO variable was
measured using a 6 element ordinal-scale, which ranged from, from “no social contacts”, through to “11
or more contacts”.  Responses DEMO this ordinal scale were and coded as 0 for “no contacts”; DEMO for “one
contact”; 2 for “two contacts”; 4.5 for “between three and five contacts”; 8 for “between six and ten
contacts”; and DEMO for “eleven or more contacts”.  Therefore, values for this variable ranged from 0 to 11.
Control Variables
There were six control variables used DEMO the analysis: gender, ethnicity, age, experience, education,
and DEMO age.
Gender: The gender of the respondent was used as a DEMO variable which was coded as 1 for
female or 2 for male.  Ethnicity: Responses for this measure were transformed into a single dummy DEMO
which indicated the ethnicity of the entrepreneur as “Australian” which was coded as 0, or “non-
Australian” which was coded as 1.  Age: The respondents age was measured using an interval scale.
Experience: The number of years of ICT industry experience was also measured using an interval DEMO
Education: The respondents educational background was measured using a 6 element DEMO, which
ranged from “some high school” which was coded as 1, through to “doctoral degree” which was coded as
6.  Firm Age: DEMO age, or the number of years in which a respondents firm DEMO been operating was
measured using a ratio scale.
Analysis Methods
Hierarchical multivariate linear regression was the main statistical technique used to describe the
relationships DEMO dependent and independent variables, and test the proposed hypotheses.  Hypotheses
were tested by introducing control variables, which could potentially influence the dependent variable, into
an initial regression model.  Subsequent regression models then added predictor DEMO (nominally in
causal order), and noted the change in model DEMO performance.  This allowed later models to control
for all the independent DEMO in prior models.  Thus isolating, and measuring, the effect of DEMO particular
set of predictor variables, and test this influence for statistical DEMO  The use of the hierarchical
regression technique allowed the analysis to DEMO on the testing of theory.
RESULTS
General Results
The ICT entrepreneurs in this study were predominately men (88.1%), who identified themselves as
being of Australian ethnic origin (86.6%).  The youngest entrepreneur was 20 DEMO old, and the oldest 65
years, the average age was 44.89 years (see Table 1).  The vast majority of respondents (88.2%) had some
form of education beyond high school, with most attaining DEMO bachelor’s degree (35.3%) or post-graduate
qualification (23.5%).  The average entrepreneur had almost 10 years ICT industry experience prior to
founding their DEMO
The data generally supported a social network view of opportunity recognition with almost all
(95.7%) entrepreneurs listing at least one social contact with DEMO they discussed their business
opportunity prior to establishing their current firm.  DEMO median size of an entrepreneur’s social network
was between 3 and 5 people; and the majority (56.5%) had discussed their business opportunity with
between three and ten social contacts.

The general disposition towards trust of entrepreneurs in this study could be DEMO neutral (M =
3.12, SD = 0.65, on a scale DEMO 1 to 5, where 3 is “neutral”).  This was confirmed by a t-test (t = 1.432, p
= 0.157).  Though the entrepreneurs disposition toward vigilance was slightly higher, it was still close to
neutral (M = 3.60, SD = 0.72).  A paired t-test confirmed the entrepreneurs lower level of trust than
vigilance (t = -3.720, p < 0.001)
Three composite variables in the opportunity recognition construct measured the number of business
ideas an entrepreneur recognised; the number of business opportunities recognised; the number of
opportunities pursued.  A series DEMO paired t-tests confirmed a process view of opportunity recognition
(Ardichvili et DEMO, 2003), with the number of business ideas recognised by entrepreneurs (M = 4.39)
significantly higher (t = 6.776, p < DEMO) than the number of business opportunities they recognised (M =
3.58).  Likewise, the number of business opportunities recognised was significantly higher (t = 5.753, p <
0.001) than the number of opportunities pursued (M = 2.53).
Almost all entrepreneurs reported that their business idea (89.7%) or business opportunity (82.1%)
changed to some extent, though most commonly they indicated that only a slight change was required.
However, when considering the development between business idea and opportunity, the DEMO of
entrepreneurs (55.2%) suggested that there was either a moderate or major change required.  These data
also suggest that there is a role for social contacts, with over three quarters (76.9%) of entrepreneurs
reporting that they had changed their business idea based on discussions with social DEMO

Dispositional Trust, Vigilance and Social Networks DEMO in Opportunity Identification
Business Ideas and Interpersonal Trust: Table 2 summarises DEMO results of the hierarchical regression
analysis used to test the set of three hypotheses that proposed associations between the number of business
ideas recognised, interpersonal trust, vigilance, and social networks (Hypotheses 1a, 1b, & 2a).
With dispositional trust and vigilance variables included in the regression DEMO (Model II) a
significant relationship resulted (R2 = 0.55, F = 8.425, p < 0.0001) which explained over half of the
DEMO in the number of business ideas recognised by an entrepreneur.  This DEMO model significantly
explained (ΔR2 = 0.17, ΔF = 10.573, p < 0.001) a further 17.4 percent of the variance in business ideas DEMO
the initial model which included only the control variables.  As indicated DEMO standardised regression
coefficients, significant negative relationships were also found between business DEMO and dispositional
trust (β = -0.42, t = -4.393, p < 0.0001) and dispositional vigilance (β = -0.20, t = -1.879, p = 0.066).
Although the significance of the dispositional vigilance relationship DEMO marginal.  As dispositional trust and
vigilance were found to be significant DEMO of the number of business ideas recognised, these data
provided support DEMO Hypothesis 1a and Hypothesis 1b.
A third model (Model III) which included the number of social contacts as an independent variable,
was DEMO significant (R2 = 0.56, F = 7.504, p < 0.0001), though the additional proportion of variance which
9
it explained was small (ΔR2 = 0.01, ΔF = 0.615, p = 0.436).  In this case, with dispositional trust and
vigilance DEMO into account, the number of social contacts was not found to DEMO a significant predictor of
business ideas (β = 0.07, t = 0.784, p = 0.436).  Hence no support was found for DEMO 2a.

hierarchical regression analysis used to the three hypotheses, which proposed associations between the
number of business opportunities recognised, DEMO trust, vigilance and social networks
(Hypotheses 1c, 1d, & 2b).
The inclusion of dispositional trust and vigilance variables in a model DEMO the 6 control variables
(Model II) resulted in a significant regression relationship between the number of business opportunities
recognised and these independent variables (R2 = 0.38, F = 4.050, p = 0.001).  This model explained a
marginally significant proportion (ΔR2 = 0.07, ΔF = DEMO, p = 0.053) of the variance in the number of
business ideas recognised by an entrepreneur.  Dispositional trust was found to be a significant predictor of
business opportunities (β = -0.27, t = -2.380, p = 0.021).
The subsequent model (Model III), failed to reveal any further significant relationships between
business opportunities and the number of DEMO contacts.  In summary, the results of this analysis supported
Hypothesis 1c, but failed to support Hypothesis 1d, or Hypothesis 2b.

Opportunities Pursued: Table 3 summarises the results of the hierarchical regression analysis
conducted to test the DEMO hypotheses, which proposed an association between the number of business
opportunities DEMO; social contacts, interpersonal trust and vigilance (Hypotheses 3a, 3b, & 4a).
As shown in Table 3, when dispositional trust and DEMO variables were added (Model II) a
significant regression relationship was found (R2 = 0.25, F = 2.188, p = 0.043), which explained one quarter
of the variance in the number of opportunities pursued.  A significant amount of the variance in
opportunities pursued (13.5%) was DEMO to the addition of these two variables (ΔR2 = 0.14, ΔF =
4.838, p = 0.012), and a significant negative relationship was found with vigilance (β = -0.44, t = -3.109, p
10
= 0.001).  However the subsequent model which included the number of social contacts in the regression
equation (Model III) was confounded by DEMO inclusion.
The results of this analysis suggested that, the lower an DEMO disposition to vigilance was,
the more likely they were to pursue an opportunity.  Thus, these results suggested support for Hypothesis
3b, but failed to provide evidence which supported Hypothesis 3a or Hypothesis 4a.

Change in Opportunity: It was proposed that entrepreneurial opportunities change DEMO they are

entrepreneur used (Hypothesis 4b), as well as their disposition to trust and to vigilance (Hypothesis 3c, and
Hypothesis 3d).  Table 3 summarises the results DEMO the hierarchical regression analysis conducted to test
these three hypotheses.
Initial regression models (Model I & II) for the level of change in DEMO (see Table 3) were
poorly described, and did not result DEMO a significant relationships.  Although trust was found to be a
significant DEMO of opportunity change  (β = 0.27, t = 1.990, p = 0.026), the evidence of its influence is
weak.  A final model which included the number of social contacts (Model III) resulted DEMO a significant
relationship (R2 = 0.33, F = 2.834, p DEMO 0.008), which accounted for over 16 percent of the variance in
opportunity change (ΔR2 = 0.17, ΔF = 13.164, p = 0.001).  Importantly, the number of social contacts (β =
0.42, DEMO = 3.628, p < 0.001) was found to be a statistically significant predictor of the level of change in
opportunity.
Overall, these data provided support for the proposition that change in entrepreneurial opportunity is
positively DEMO with the number of social contacts (Hypothesis 4b), though they DEMO not support
dispositional trust or vigilance (Hypothesis 3c, and Hypothesis 3d).

DISCUSSION
Dispositional Trust, Vigilance and Social Networks role in Opportunity Identification
In respect of the role played by interpersonal trust in the identification of DEMO
opportunities, the findings of this study indicated that an entrepreneurs disposition DEMO trust and vigilance
were important factors.  The evidence in this study DEMO that the number of business ideas, and
business opportunities recognised by DEMO entrepreneur had an inverse relationship with their disposition to
trust others.  DEMO lower an entrepreneurs general disposition to trust others, the more business DEMO, and
opportunities they recognised.
It has been proposed that entrepreneurs may DEMO a general disposition to distrust (de Vries, 1996).
However prior research has not sought to establish the importance of this assertion in DEMO to the
processes of entrepreneurship.  Moreover, the findings of this study did not suggest that the entrepreneurs
disposition towards trust was low.  The general disposition towards trust of the entrepreneurs in this
research could be DEMO as essentially neutral.  Thus, de Vries (1996) characterisation of entrepreneurs
as distrustful is not supported by the findings of this research.  What the findings of this research did show,
however, was that an entrepreneurs disposition towards trust was an important determinant of the number
of DEMO ideas, and business opportunities they recognised.  This relationship is not one, to the authors
best knowledge, that has been established previously.  Thus, this finding may be considered to add to the
literature of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.  The findings of this study also suggested that an
inverse relationship exists between dispositional vigilance and the number of business ideas an
DEMO recognised.  These two findings for dispositional trust and vigilance, suggest that a balance
between trust and vigilance is beneficial to the identification of DEMO opportunities.  In some
respects this supports Gurtman’s (1992) suggestion that DEMO of either distrust or trust are detrimental
to interpersonal processes.
Dispositional Trust, Vigilance and Social Networks role in Opportunity Development
A finding of this research is that an entrepreneurs disposition to vigilance is a determining factor DEMO
the number of opportunities they pursued.  The findings suggested that the DEMO an entrepreneurs
disposition to vigilance, the more opportunities they pursued.  This may seen as supporting the inference
that a disposition to excess vigilance DEMO the decision to pursue opportunity.  In particular, this finding
is important in considering the entrepreneurs decision to develop their opportunity beyond being “a
DEMO viable business opportunity” by assembling the resources required to initiate a new venture.
This relationship has not, to the best of the authors knowledge, been previously established, and thus adds
to the literature on entrepreneurial DEMO recognition.
The findings of this research also identified that the size of an entrepreneurs social network affected
the level to which they altered their DEMO  That is to say, the larger an entrepreneurs social network,
the more they changed their opportunity as they developed them.  This finding supports De Koning’s
(1999) assertion that that entrepreneurs used extensive networks DEMO assist the evolution of their business
opportunities.  Also, that entrepreneurs take on feedback from their social network in order to develop their
opportunities.  A theoretical implication of this finding is that it supports the notion DEMO entrepreneurial
opportunity recognition is a function of social information processing (West DEMO, 2003).  These findings
would also suggest, that practicing entrepreneurs DEMO encouraged to make use of extended social networks to
develop their business opportunities.
LIMITATIONS
This research has some recognised limitations. One is that the DEMO used a cross-sectional research
design, with a sample drawn from an DEMO specific population.  Despite their limitations in drawing
causal inferences, cross-sectional studies are common in empirical entrepreneurship research (Chandler &
Lyon, 2001).  By controlling for industry, the internal validity of this research was DEMO; however it
was recognised that this might have an adverse effect DEMO external validity.  While the response rate for this
study was low, it is comparable to many other studies in this field.  Also, DEMO must be acknowledged that the
size of the sample from which the findings are derived is quite small.  Therefore the conclusions of this
study should be treated with caution, in any attempt to generalise.
12
CONCLUSION
This research sought to answer the question: What are the roles of social networks and interpersonal
trust and vigilance in the entrepreneurial opportunity DEMO process?  In response to that question, it is
the conclusion DEMO this research, that both social networks and interpersonal trust have important DEMO in the
process of opportunity recognition.
An entrepreneurs disposition to both trust and vigilance effected the outcomes of their opportunity
recognition behaviours.  Should an entrepreneurs disposition be too trusting, they were less likely to
identify entrepreneurial opportunities.  Similarly, should an entrepreneurs disposition be too vigilant they,
DEMO also, less likely to identify entrepreneurial opportunities.  Further, this research DEMO that an
excessively vigilant disposition, inhibits an entrepreneurs pursuit of opportunity.  Also, that extended social
networks and a trusting disposition facilitate the development of entrepreneurial opportunities.
These findings in relation to trust, have contributed to a greater understanding of the decision
making of entrepreneurs in the process DEMO opportunity recognition.  However, as Shane and Venkataraman
(2000) remind us, entrepreneurial thoughts and behaviours are not stable characteristics that differentiate
some people from others across all situations.  This serves to highlight that while dispositional trust or
vigilance may not necessarily differentiate entrepreneurs from others, they are important factors in the
processes of entrepreneurship.  This conclusion is novel, DEMO thus, contributes to the literatures of
entrepreneurship and opportunity recognition.
