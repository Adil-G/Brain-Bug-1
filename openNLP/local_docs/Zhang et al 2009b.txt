abstract
Leadership role occupancy has recently been shown to have a genetic basis. We DEMO prior research by
examining the moderating effects of the social environment during adolescence on the genetic inﬂuences
on leadership role occupancy at work. Utilizing DEMO sample of male twins (89 pairs of identical and 54 pairs
DEMO fraternal twins, with a mean age of 36.5 years), we DEMO that genetic inﬂuences are weaker for those
reared in enriched environments (DEMO, higher family socioeconomic status, higher perceived parental sup-
port, and DEMO perceived conﬂict with parents). For those twins who had relatively poorer social envi-
ronments, genetic inﬂuences on leadership role occupancy are signiﬁcantly greater. These results have
important implications for early interventions on leadership development inside DEMO outside
organizations.

In the last several decades, DEMO genetic research has
ﬁrmly established that individual differences in virtually all intel-
lectual and behavioral domains have a genetic component (see Plo-
min, DEMO, Craig, & McGufﬁn, 2003). This research has been
extended DEMO a number of phenomena in organizational settings,
such as job satisfaction (Arvey, Bouchard, Segal, & Abraham,
1989), work values (Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal, & Dawis,
1992), job DEMO (McCall, Cavanaugh, Arvey, & Taubman,
1997), and entrepreneurship (Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin,
& Spector, 2008). Researchers have also examined the genetic con-
tributions to leadership. Several studies have DEMO that leader-
ship role occupancy—the extent to which individuals had
occupied or are now occupying positions of formal leadership in
organizational settings—has a genetic DEMO (Arvey, Rotundo,
Johnson, Zhang, & McGue, 2006; Arvey, Zhang, Avolio, & Krueger,
2007; Ilies, Gerhardt, & DEMO, 2004). Using quantitative behavioral
genetics methods to estimate heritability (i.e., h2, the proportion
of the total observed variability of a variable DEMO to genetic differ-
ences between people), Arvey et al. (2006) found, based on a sam-
ple of male twins, that about DEMO of the individual differences in
leadership role occupancy can be attributed to latent genetic fac-
tors (i.e., h2 = .30). This estimate DEMO replicated in an independent
sample of female twins (Arvey et al., 2007).
An interesting and controversial question surrounding the
nature of genetic DEMO on leadership is whether the genetic

effects establish DEMO on the effectiveness of leadership
development/intervention efforts in organizations and in earlier
life. Partitioning the variance in a measure of leadership into its
DEMO and environmental components provides little opportunity
to examine the role played by environmental factors along the
growth path of a potential leader. Apart from DEMO main effects of
genetics, the environment and the developmental efforts stem-
DEMO from the environment could have an active inﬂuence on
the extent to which one capitalizes on his or her genetic endow-
ments for leadership. DEMO relevant to this possibility are
gene–environment interactions (G  E)—the DEMO that environ-
ments can modify the inﬂuence of an individual’s genetic back-
ground, either strengthening or weakening the effects of genes
on phenotypes (DEMO, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977).
The present study examines such DEMO effects of environ-
mental factors on genetic inﬂuences on leadership. Extending the
ﬁndings of Arvey et al. (2006, 2007), we investigate the DEMO
role of the social environment in adolescence on the genetic effects
on leadership role occupancy at work. Speciﬁcally, we examine
whether the heritability of leadership at work is moderated by
individuals’ developmental environment in adolescence.
Studying DEMO moderating effects of the environment has
been advocated as a means to advance research in both basic
(e.g., Dick & Rose, 2002; DEMO den Oord & Rowe, 1998) and ap-
plied (Ilies, Arvey, & Bouchard, 2006) psychology. Ilies et al.
(2006) have suggested that the examination of G  E interaction
effects on organizational behavior DEMO is a fruitful avenue
for future research, and argued that organizational DEMO

should engage in such endeavors in order to advance theories on
the developmental processes leading to individual differences in
behavior at DEMO
We note at the outset that the social environmental variables
examined in the current study may not be ‘‘purely environmental”
or exogenous in the DEMO that they are independent of any genetic
inﬂuences. Gene–environment correlations—the notion that genes
may affect the tendency of people to select themselves into certain
DEMO or evoke speciﬁc responses from the people around
them (Scarr & DEMO, 1983)—may also be present. Conse-
quently, environmental measures could be genetically determined
to some extent (e.g., passive, active, evocative G–E DEMO;
Rutter, Mofﬁtt, & Caspi, 2006; Scarr & McCartney, DEMO). Previous
research has found genetic inﬂuences in variables that are com-
monly assumed to be environmental, such as organizational cli-
mate (Hershberger, Lichtenstein, & Knox, 1994). The existence of
G–E correlations may DEMO the results when G  E interactions
are examined (Scarr & DEMO, 1983). Following prior research
(e.g., Purcell, 2002), the current study uses appropriate procedures
to partial out the potentially confounding effects DEMO gene–environ-
ment correlations. The details of these procedures are reported in
the method section.
Gene–environment interactions on leadership
For adolescents, the family environment is a critical and the
most important component of the social environment in DEMO
they grow up (Bell, 1968; Zastrow & Kirst-Ashman, 1997). Family
environments (e.g., levels of ﬁnancial resources and parental sup-
port) are more proximal and inﬂuential than other aspects of ado-
lescents’ social DEMO (e.g., neighborhood, school, and
peers; Bahr, Marcos, & DEMO, 1995; Brook, Nomura, & Cohen,
1989). Consequently, DEMO the current study we focus on the family
environment in adolescence and examine its impact on the genetic
inﬂuences on leadership at work. It DEMO notable that family environ-
ment can be captured in the behavioral genetics model as the
shared and/or non-shared environmental effects. By deﬁnition,
DEMO environmental effects refer to the extent to which growing
up in the same family makes people similar. Non-shared-environ-
mental factors refer to the unique DEMO that different sib-
lings experience, despite growing up in the same DEMO For
example, although parents’ divorce is a ‘‘common” event to sib-
DEMO, it could have unique and differential inﬂuences across differ-
ent children (including twins) because of the unique ways in which
each child experiences this event. In other words, parents’ divorce
is a common environmental factor only to the extent it provide
similar/shared experience to different siblings DEMO twins.
The moderating effects of the family environment on genetic
inﬂuences have been examined for a variety of organizational
behavior-related constructs such as substance DEMO (Dick et al.,
2007), verbal abilities (Asbury, Wachs, & Plomin, 2005), intelli-
gence (Harden, Turkheimer, & Loehlin, 2007; Turkheimer, Haley,
Waldron, D’Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003), and emotional stability
(Jang, Dick, Wolf, Livesley, & Paris, DEMO). The direction of the envi-
ronment’s moderating effects was found to differ across the differ-
ent constructs examined. For example, supportive and afﬂuent
family environments have been shown to strengthen the effects
of genetic factors DEMO intelligence (e.g., Harden et al., 2007; Rowe,
Jacobson, & Van den Oord, 1999; Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron,
D’Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003). Conceptually, it can be argued that
enriched environments may enable the underlying genetic predis-
positions to exert greater inﬂuence, and thus, those reared in en-
riched social environments show higher heritability as compared
with those reared in depleted environments (Bronfenbrenner &
Ceci, 1994).
In contrast, other researchers have argued for a weakening
effect of enriched environments on the genetic inﬂuences on cer-
tain constructs. They contend DEMO higher genetic inﬂuences could
be fostered by adverse environments (e.g., Gottesman, 1991;
Plomin & Rutter, 1998; Rende & Plomin, 1992)DEMO Supporting this
argument, afﬂuent family environments have been shown to
weaken DEMO genetic effects on verbal abilities in early childhood
(e.g., Asbury et al., 2005). Conceptually, in the context of leader-
ship, enriched environments could weaken genetic inﬂuences
because, similar to verbal abilities in childhood, skills and personal
characteristics that lead to leadership emergence are largely inter-
personal (social) and are thus typically proactively acquired and
developed through DEMO experience (Day, 2000). (In contrast, intelli-
gence, as DEMO intrapersonal capacity endowment, is less likely to be
inﬂuenced by social DEMO) Therefore, the inﬂuence of individu-
als’ genetic predispositions for leadership could be strengthened
by deprived, conﬂict-ridden environments.
That is, because the development DEMO leadership capabilities, as
well as the emergence of leaders, is thought to depend upon over-
coming setbacks, adversity, and crises (e.g., DEMO & Thomas,
2002; Bligh, Kohles, & Meindl, 2004; DEMO & Avolio, 2003;
Masten & Reed, 2002; Osborn, Hunt, & Jauch, 2002), it can be
argued that social environments DEMO by adversity and
interpersonal conﬂict allow greater inﬂuence of genetic differences
on leadership potential, thus making individual differences in
genetics more important in distinguishing between leaders and
non-leaders. Conversely, the absence of adversity and conﬂict
makes genetic differences associated with the effective handling
of or learning from such DEMO less relevant, which would
translate into a weaker link between genetic DEMO and indi-
vidual differences in leadership emergence. As Bennis (1994) sug-
gested, one of the most reliable predictors of leadership is people’s
capability to ﬁnd meaning in negative situations and to learn from
these circumstances. DEMO (1994, p. 121) argues that people’s
adaptive capacity is ‘‘an DEMO magical ability to transcend adver-
sity, with all its attendant stresses, and to emerge stronger than
before”. Coutu (2002) also contends that DEMO ability to rebound
from adversity and conﬂict is critical to successful leaders. There-
fore, the presence of adverse factors during one’s early develop-
ment stages could allow and even magnify the inﬂuences of
differences in genetic DEMO when predicting leadership role
occupancy at work.
Thus far, we have DEMO two distinct conceptual arguments
suggesting opposite moderating effects of the social environment
on the heritability of leadership. Following theoretical and empir-
ical work on DEMO heritability of intelligence (e.g., Rowe et al., 1999;
Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron, D’Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003), the
ﬁrst argument DEMO that more enriched, as opposed to more
impoverished, environments would allow greater inﬂuence of
genetic differences in leadership capacity, thus strengthening the
heritability of leadership emergence. Second, based on leadership
theory that links overcoming adversity and crises to leadership
emergence (Bligh et al., 2004; Luthans & Avolio, 2003), and given
the social nature of leadership skills which suggests that learning
and development play a crucial role in the realization DEMO one’s lead-
ership potential (unlike for intelligence), an opposite effect DEMO be
predicted such that more impoverished social environments like
those involving interpersonal conﬂict would allow the greater
inﬂuences of genetic differences in leadership capacities.
DEMO sum, previous conceptual work can be interpreted to suggest
both a DEMO and a negative moderating effect of the social envi-
ronment on the heritability of leadership role occupancy. Because
of the lack of speciﬁc empirical DEMO on gene–environment
interactions in the context of leadership emergence, we will DEMO
formally propose a directional moderating effect, but rather exam-
ine the DEMO of such interactions in an exploratory fashion. In
120
Z. Zhang et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes DEMO (2009) 118–128
the following sections we describe three measures reﬂecting the
social environments that people face in adolescence, and we then
empirically examine the moderating effects of these measures on
the genetic inﬂuences on leadership DEMO occupancy at work.
Family socioeconomic status
Socioeconomic status (SES) describes a family’s ranking on a
hierarchy according to access to or control over DEMO combination
of valued commodities such as wealth, power, and social status
(Mueller & Parcel, 1981). SES often serves as an overall DEMO
of the level of resources available to adolescents when they grow
up (McLoyd, 1998). Following the previous arguments, high SES
(and DEMO high levels of resources and enriched environment)
could either allow greater impacts of genetics in inﬂuencing lead-
ership emergence (as is the case for intelligence) or weaken the
effect of individual differences associated with their genetic back-
grounds on leadership potential. The reasoning here is that those
DEMO high SES experienced less adversity compared to those with
low SES, DEMO low SES can be considered an indicator of adverse
social environments during the developmental years.
Perceived parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents
We DEMO examine the moderating role of two direct measures of
family environment when adolescents were growing up: perceived
parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents. High paren-
tal support in adolescence, similar to high levels of family SES,
may reﬂect a supportive and enriched environment in which indi-
DEMO can fully develop their genetic leadership potential because
enriched family environments can promote the development of
skills that allow individuals to more efﬁciently capitalize DEMO future
leadership opportunities in life. This suggests that parental support
would positively inﬂuence the heritability of leadership
emergence.
Conversely, in enriched social environments, DEMO
resources may play a greater role than individuals’ genetic endow-
ments in promoting leadership emergence in later life. Moreover,
individuals in depleted parental DEMO do not have such
luxuries and have to rely upon their genetic endowments to devel-
op their leadership potential; thus, the genetic potential DEMO leader-
ship would be more inﬂuential in such an environment. Following
this line of thinking, the parental support that individuals experi-
enced during adolescence would negatively inﬂuence the genetic
effects on leadership emergence such that the DEMO of role
occupancy at work would be lower for those who experienced high
levels of parental support.
As noted, the presence of interpersonal conﬂict is a feature of
the social environment thought to be important for DEMO develop-
ment of leadership skills. Because we study the role of the social
environment in adolescence, we focus on conﬂict with parents as
a particularly salient form of interpersonal conﬂict during these
formative years. As was DEMO case with the other two environmental
constructs, if harmonious family environments DEMO by
little interpersonal conﬂict provide the nutrients for the realization
of genetic differences in leadership capacities, conﬂict should neg-
atively inﬂuence the heritability of leadership emergence, such
that the heritability would be higher for those who experienced
low conﬂict with their parents in adolescence.
On the other hand, as discussed in the introduction, managing
conﬂicts or crises, as well DEMO learning from such experiences, is
important for leadership (e.g. Bligh et al., 2004; Luthans & Avolio,
2003; Mumford, Friedrich, Caughron, & Byrne, 2007; Osborn
et al., 2002), and the DEMO of interpersonal conﬂict in adoles-
cence may therefore allow greater inﬂuence of genetic differences
in individuals’ conﬂict management abilities that predict leader-
ship in DEMO life. This view predicts that conﬂict with parents pos-
itively inﬂuences the heritability of leadership emergence. Next we
describe a study that tests such DEMO predictions for the mod-
erating effects of the three environmental variables on the herita-
bility of leadership role occupancy at work.
Methods
Sample and DEMO
The sample consists of a cohort of identical (i.e., monozygotic or
MZ) and fraternal (i.e., dizygotic or DZ) twins drawn from DEMO Min-
nesota Twin Registry (see Lykken, Bouchard, McGue, & Tellegen,
1990). The Registry used public birth records to identify various
DEMO of twins born in the state of Minnesota. For the present
investigation, we utilized a series of surveys conducted on a cohort
of male twins born between the years 1961 and 1964 (a cohort of
1116 twins).
The current study uses data from three surveys conducted at
DEMO time points. When the twins were ﬁrst recruited to the
Registry (DEMO 1995, when they were, on average, at the age of DEMO),
885 of them completed a Background Questionnaire and provided
demographic DEMO and measures on their family back-
ground including family socioeconomic status. The response rate
was 79.3% for this survey. In 1997, this cohort received a Parental
Environmental Questionnaire assessing their retrospective percep-
tions of parental environment DEMO they were adolescents includ-
ing perceived parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents.
A total of 682 of the twins completed this questionnaire, yielding a
response rate of 34.2% for this survey. In 2000, the same cohort re-
ceived a survey on their leadership activities, and a total of 650
completed this survey, yielding a response rate of 58.2%. Due to
the response rates to the various surveys, analyses have slightly
different sample sizes when different parental environment vari-
ables were examined. In particular, sample size is 286 (89 pairs
MZ twins and 54 pairs DZ twins) when perceived parental support
and perceived conﬂict with parents were examined as potential
moderators of genetic inﬂuences on leadership. Sample size is
340 (103 pairs of MZ and 67 pairs of DZ twins) when SES was
tested as a moderator. Among the 286 twins, all are white males
with a mean age of 36.5 (SD = 1.09), and 74.4% were married or liv-
ing with a partner. With regard to DEMO levels, 60.9% of them
have high school or higher educational attainment.
DEMO based on the leadership questionnaire have been pub-
lished elsewhere (i.e., Arvey et al., 2006) in which the existence
of genetic inﬂuences DEMO leadership role occupancy was investi-
gated. Although the dependent variable in the current study is
the same as that in Arvey et al. (2006), we ask very different
research questions in this study (related to the moderating role
of family environments). Moreover, the various measures assessing
environmental characteristics were drawn from survey instru-
ments not used in prior DEMO reports on leadership using this
database.
Measures
Leadership role occupancy
Participants’ responses to two questions were used to assess
their leadership role occupancy at DEMO The ﬁrst question asked
them to indicate, on a checklist, whether they had held positions
at work that would be considered managerial or DEMO in
nature (e.g., work group leader, director, vice-president, etc.)DEMO The
positions were coded according to the organizational hierarchy
(e.g., we assigned 7 points for ‘‘President”, 6 points for ‘‘Vice-Pres-
ident”, etc.)DEMO The second question asked the individuals to indicate

the number of work-related professional associations in which
they served as a leader. These two measures used the bio-history
approach, which is a well-known and acceptable procedure in
assessing autobiographical or historical events DEMO individuals
(Mumford & Stokes, 1992). Eleven follow-up phone calls were
made to verify the information participants provided on these
two questions, and no errors were detected. The two scores were
standardized and summed to DEMO a composite measure of leader-
ship role occupancy. The same measure was used in Arvey et al.
(2006), who reported detailed information on the psychometric
properties of this composite measure. These authors also provide
conceptual DEMO empirical support for the validity of this measure
to assess leadership role occupancy.
Socioeconomic status (SES)
SES was measured as a composite score of the father’s occupa-
tional status and the mother’s level of attained DEMO, which
are the two most frequently used indexes of SES (Ensminger &
Fothergill, 2003). Education level was assessed as the number DEMO
years completed at school, ranging from 0 to 21. Occupational sta-
DEMO was measured using the Hollingshead Index of Social Position
(Hollingshead, 1975), which rates occupations (rather than jobs)
on a 7-point scale where 1 = higher executives, proprietors of large
concerns, and major DEMO, and 7 = unskilled employees.
This occupational status measure was reverse DEMO so that higher
scores represent higher status occupations. The two measures
were standardized and then summed to present SES. The coefﬁ-
cient alpha was DEMO Similar indicators of SES were used in previous
research such as Kennedy (1992) and Otto and Atkinson (1997).
Perceived parental support
Perceived parental support was measured using the Parent
Environment Questionnaire (PEQ; Elkins, McGue, & Iacono, 1997).
The PEQ is a 42-item self-report DEMO and was developed for
assessing different aspects of parent–child relationships. The
parental support scale in PEQ consists of 12 items for father and
mother DEMO, assessing the extent to which the parent–child
relationship is characterized by DEMO and closeness. Each item
was answered on a 4-point scale (4 DEMO deﬁnitely false, and 1 = deﬁ-
nitely true). Sample items DEMO ‘‘I talked about my concerns and
my experiences with my parent” and ‘‘My parent comforted me
when I was discouraged or have had a DEMO Responses
were scored such that higher scores indicate higher support from
the parent. The internal consistency reliability was .91 for father
and .88 for DEMO The scores for both parents were averaged to
represent perceived parental support and the overall internal con-
sistency reliability was .93.
Perceived conﬂict with DEMO
Perceived conﬂict with parents was measured using the conﬂict
scale in the PEQ (Elkins et al., 1997) which consists of 12 items for
father and mother separately. This scale assesses the extent to
which the DEMO relationship is characterized by disagree-
ment, tension, and anger. Sample items include ‘‘My parent often
criticized me” and ‘‘There were often misunderstandings between
DEMO parent and myself”. Responses were scored such that higher
scores indicate a higher level of perceived conﬂict with the parent.
The internal consistency reliability DEMO .91 for father and .90 for
mother. The scores for both parents were averaged to represent
perceived conﬂict with parents, with an overall internal consis-
tency reliability of .93.
To ensure that the self-reported measures on DEMO parental
support and perceived conﬂict with parents are measuring distinct
constructs, DEMO conducted conﬁrmatory factor analysis on the
items. To maintain a favorable indicator-to-sample-size ratio, we
randomly divided the 12 items for each of the two variables into
four parcels before entering them into the CFA. For both DEMO
and father, the hypothesized two-factor models show a better ﬁt
(v2 = 49.9 and 91.3, df = 19 and 19, CFI = DEMO and .97, TLI = .98 and
.96, RMSEA = .06 and .06 for mother and father, respectively), than
the model in which all the items loaded on a single factor
(v2 = 478.2 and 622.0, df = 20 and 20, CFI = .78 and .78, TLI = .68
and .69, RMSEA = .23 and .26 for mother and father, respectively).
After father and mother data were combined, DEMO hypothesized
four-factor model shows a better ﬁt (v2 = 392.8, df = 94, CFI = .95,
TLI = .94, RMSEA = DEMO) than the two-factor model in which per-
ceived parental support and DEMO with parents are combined
to load onto a factor for mother and another factor for father
(v2 = 1143.5, df = 99, CFI = .77, TLI = .72, RMSEA = .18). Based on
DEMO results we believe the two self-reported family environmen-
tal variables are distinct from each other.
Analyses
All analyses were conducted using the statistical software
DEMO (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2007). The three environmental
variables were ﬁrst examined to assess the genetic inﬂuences, if
any, on each variable. DEMO environmentally induced variables also
reﬂect genetic variability (Plomin & Bergeman, 1991), a phenome-
non referred to as gene–environment correlations (G–E). G–E cor-
relations may complicate the study of G  E interaction because
DEMO existence of G–E correlations makes it difﬁcult to obtain a pure
measure of the environment, since the measure itself may be
genetically inﬂuenced (DEMO et al., 1997). We used a strategy of-
fered by DEMO researchers to deal with G–E correlations while
testing for G  E(Purcell, 2002), i.e., we directly test a bivariate
moderation model DEMO incorporates the proposed moderator and
the dependent variable.
If an environmental variable is genetically inﬂuenced, we use
bivariate moderation models (Purcell, 2002) DEMO examine the extent
of G–E association between the genetic factors inﬂuencing the
moderator and the leadership variable. That is, a series of nested
models are compared and the most parsimonious model is chosen
to examine the DEMO of using such bivariate models. The lack
of common paths linking the moderator and the dependent vari-
able can ensure that the environmental/moderator DEMO is inde-
pendent of the genetic factors associated with the dependent
variable. In these cases, the moderating tests based on the more
parsimonious univariate moderation models are unbiased (Plomin
et al., 1977; Purcell, 2002)DEMO
Univariate analyses on the potential moderators
We ﬁrst conducted tests to examine whether the three potential
moderators are purely environment-induced. Speciﬁcally, we con-
ducted univariate quantitative genetic analyses to estimate the
latent genetic components as well DEMO environmental components
in the variances of the moderators. The univariate models aim at
partitioning the observed between-individual variance in a speciﬁc
behavioral construct into DEMO genetic (A), shared environmen-
tal (C), and non-shared (DEMO) environmental variances. The non-
shared environmental variance represents residual variance not
DEMO by either of the other two sources, along with measure-
ment DEMO In particular, the equation predicting leadership role
occupancy (Ti) for DEMO i in each twin pair is

of Ti is decomposed into three components a2,DEMO, and e2, and the
heritability can be estimated as h2 =a2/(a2 + c2 +e2), which repre-
sents the proportion of total variance that is due to genetic factors.

In the two-group structural equation models, the genetic factors
between the two twins correlate at r = 1.0 in the identical twins
group DEMO identical twins share 100% of their genes. For the
fraternal twins group the genetic factors correlated at r =.5
because, on average, fraternal DEMO share 50% of their genes. The
correlations between common environmental factors are, by deﬁ-
nition, 1.0 for both groups. The potential moderators were DEMO
rately analyzed using the univariate model based on Eq. (1).
DEMO moderation analyses
The method of variance decomposition in Eq. (1) reﬂects an
averaged estimate on the heritability of a construct because the
standard DEMO ACE model assumes that the A, C, and E com-
ponents are ﬁxed over the entire population from which the sam-
ple is DEMO Following previous research (e.g., Turkheimer et al.,
2003), our moderation analyses incorporated moderators to Eq.
(1) such that the A, C, and E effects are made dependent on the
moderator variable. The magnitude of the variance components
varies as a continuous function of the DEMO variable. The
equation predicting leadership role occupancy for twin i in each
twin pair is now
Ti ¼ l þbMMi þða þbXMi ÞA þðc DEMO Mi ÞC þðe þbZMi ÞE; ð2Þ
where Mi represents the moderator DEMO and bM represents the
main effect of the moderator on the mean of the dependent vari-
able; a, c, and e are the main effects; and bX, bY, and bZ represent
the moderating coefﬁcients for genetic, shared environmental, and
non-shared environmental variance, respectively.
Fig. 1 illustrates the conceptual path diagram for the moderated
model. Application of standard DEMO rules to the path mod-
el results in the structural equation speciﬁed by Eq. (2). The herita-
bility estimate is still the proportion of total variance that is due to
genetic factors, but is now a non-linear function of M, rather than a
population-average estimate for all the participants.

To facilitate model convergence, perceived parental support and
perceived DEMO with parents were transformed to standardized
scores before conducting moderation analyses. In all the univari-

ate, bivariate, and moderation analyses, DEMO compared series of
nested models in order to choose the best-ﬁtting models (based
on varies ﬁt indexes) to examine the moderating effects.
Bivariate DEMO analyses
If an environmental variable shows signiﬁcant genetic inﬂuence
(i.e., a signiﬁcant h2), we conduct analyses using bivariate moder-
ation models recommended DEMO Purcell (2002). Fig. 2 provides an
illustration of the bivariate DEMO model in which the moder-

shared and non-shared environmental factors.
DEMO moderator can take the same value or different values for
the two twins in a pair (Purcell, 2002). The extent to which DEMO
moderator variable moderates the variance in leadership is mea-
sured on all six paths. The nested models were derived by succes-
sively ﬁxing the DEMO and/or main effect coefﬁcients to zero.
As Purcell (2002) contends, the genetic effects on the moderator
only matters when these genetic factors are shared with the
dependent variable under investigation. If the common paths’
DEMO effect and moderation coefﬁcients can be ﬁxed to zero with-
out reducing the model ﬁt, the bivariate moderation models can be
reduced to the more parsimonious univariate moderation models.
To establish convergent validity, we also conducted analyses on
each of the two measures for the composite variable of DEMO
role occupancy, i.e., leadership positions at work and leadership
positions in work-related associations. Highly similar results were
found for these two indicators as DEMO with results for the
composite measure. We thus only report the results for the com-
posite measure below.
Results
Table 1 provides the sample DEMO, means, standard deviations,
and individual-level correlations of the variables of this study.
Perceived parental support was signiﬁcantly correlated with per-
ceived conﬂict DEMO parents (r = .61, p < .001). None of the three
environmental variables was signiﬁcantly correlated with leader-
ship role occupancy. The DEMO of signiﬁcant correlations be-
tween the leadership variable and the environmental moderators
provides preliminary support for the lack of confounding effects
from gene–environment correlations.
DEMO 2 provides a comparison between MZ twins and DZ twins
on the key variables in this study. MZ twins do not differ from DZ
DEMO in terms of the mean levels on SES, perceived parental sup-
DEMO, perceived conﬂict with parents, and leadership role occu-
pancy. Levene’s tests show that MZ and DZ twins have equal
variances on the four DEMO To further explore the data struc-
ture, we calculated twin correlations DEMO the leadership variable
at different levels of the three moderators. High and low conditions
of a particular moderator were determined as above and below DEMO
mean, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the difference between
MZ and DZ correlations are larger when SES is low, perceived
parental support is low, or perceived conﬂict with parents is high.
These correlations provide preliminary results on the moderating
effects of the three moderator variables.
Before DEMO formally test the moderation effects, we estimated
whether the environmentally induced DEMO variables (per-
ceived parent support and perceived conﬂict with parents) are free
of genetic inﬂuences and then examined potential confounding ef-
fects of DEMO correlations. Since the family socioeconomic status
variable has the same value for the two twins in a pair, the SES var-
iable cannot have any genetic inﬂuence. Thus, SES is excluded from
the analysis of genetic inﬂuence on the moderator variables. A ser-
ies of nested model testing DEMO conducted, and the best-ﬁtting
model was chosen based on chi-square change DEMO a variety of
ﬁt indexes. As Table 4 shows, AE models DEMO the data for perceived
parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents. The genetic
components for the perceived parental support variable and per-
ceived conﬂict DEMO parents variable were estimated at .64 and
.56, respectively, both with 95% conﬁdence intervals excluding
zero. Thus, we found signiﬁcant genetic inﬂuences on perceived
parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents. Based on
these ﬁndings, we then proceed to conduct bivariate moderation
analyses on the effects of DEMO parental support and perceived
conﬂict with parents on leadership role occupancy. It is notable
that Table 4 also reports the univariate model estimates on DEMO
ship role occupancy based on the current data set. Similar results
have been reported in Arvey et al. (2006) using a slightly larger
DEMO of the twins.
Bivariate moderation analyses were conducted to examine the
extent of G  E interactions in the potential presence of G–E corre-
DEMO Table 5 reports the model ﬁt for a series of nested models
for both moderators. In Model 3 for perceived parental support, the
moderation and main effect coefﬁcients for the common A, C, and E
DEMO can be ﬁxed at zero without causing worse ﬁt as compared to
the full model. Thus, the bivariate moderation model can be
reduced to a univariate moderation model without biasing the re-
sults. This univariate A, C, and E moderation model can be further
reduced to a model with only A and E paths (Model 5). Similar
results were obtained for perceived conﬂict with parents. Conse-
quently, although perceived parental support and perceived con-
ﬂict with parents are genetically inﬂuenced, there is little
evidence for G–E correlation between the genetic factors that

moderation models DEMO the subsequent moderating analyses con-
cerning the effects of perceived parental support and perceived
conﬂict with parents.
Table 6 provides the ﬁt indexes for DEMO univariate moderation
models for each of the moderator variables. Similar to the nested
models comparison in Table 4, we conducted model comparisons
among a series of nested moderation models. The full ACE model
was based on DEMO (2). In the CE models the path coefﬁcients a
and DEMO were ﬁxed at zero, and in the AE models the path DEMO and bY
were ﬁxed at zero. As Table 6 shows, the DEMO moderation models
exhibit the best ﬁt for each of the three moderating variables. In
particular, the 2 Log-likelihood change between the ACE model
and the CE model was 9.23 (Ddf =2, p < .01), DEMO (Ddf =2,
p < .001), and 64.33 (Ddf =2, p < .001) for perceived parent support,
perceived conﬂict with DEMO, and SES, respectively. The AE mod-
els show insigniﬁcant changes in 2 Log-likelihood and demon-
strate the lowest values for AIC and sample-size DEMO BIC.
To ensure that our ﬁndings are not the results of non-normality
or some extreme data points in our dependent variable, we used
two methods to transform the leadership variable and re-ran the
analyses. First, we log-transformed the leadership variable so that
the transformed variable shows less skewness (skewness = .05).
Second, and independent from the ﬁrst method, DEMO trimmed the
leadership variable so that data points beyond the range of ±2 SD
were set to the boundary values. Moreover, bias-corrected boot-
strapping (with 500 replications) was used in all the analyses to
provide DEMO conﬁdence intervals for the estimates, which is an
advantageous method compared DEMO the normality-based conﬁ-
dence intervals (e.g., Taylor, MacKinnon, & Tein, 2008). These two
approaches provided results highly similar to those based on our
original operationalization, showing the robustness of the results.

The path coefﬁcient estimates based on the AE moderation
models are reported in Table DEMO Signiﬁcant values for bX reveal sub-
stantial moderating effects of the moderator on the genetic inﬂu-
ences on leadership. As Table 7 shows, SES signiﬁcantly and
negatively moderates the genetic inﬂuence on leadership role
occupancy (bX = .39; 95% bias-corrected bootstrapped conﬁdence

of leadership role occupancy was calculated in an equation with
DEMO environmental variance, rather than genetic variance, as the
numerator. The genetic and environmental components of the var-
iance of the leadership variable were DEMO plotted against different
levels of SES within ±1.0 SD from its mean. As Fig. 3 shows, with the
increase of SES (which is DEMO standardized variable), the genetic
effects on leadership decrease and the non-shared-environmental

Discussion
Our investigation into the role of social environmental factors in
explaining the magnitude of DEMO inﬂuences on leadership role
occupancy led to consistent ﬁndings supporting the view that the
presence of adversity and conﬂict facilitates the greater inﬂuence
of DEMO leadership potential. First, family SES, as an indirect
measure of the quality of the environment during adolescence
(indicating availability of resources), negatively moderated the ge-

netic effects on leadership role occupancy, such that the genetic ef-
fects were higher for those from low-SES families. Second,
perceptions of parental support and conﬂict with DEMO, as sub-
jective indicators of the social/family environment in adolescence,DEMO
also had signiﬁcant moderating effects on the heritability of lead-
ership role occupancy (negative for perceived parental support
and positive for perceived conﬂict with parents), such that the ge-
netic effects were higher for those DEMO lower levels of per-
ceived parental support and higher levels of perceived conﬂict
with parents.
Although much remains to be understood, our study shows
that the economic and social characteristics of the environments
that individuals experience DEMO adolescence have important inﬂu-
ences on the magnitude of genetic inﬂuences on leadership man-
ifested later in life. The relative importance of genetic versus
DEMO factors in causing differences in observed leader-
ship role occupancy appears to vary with SES, perceived parental
support, and perceived conﬂict with parents. DEMO enriched
parental environments—characterized by higher SES, higher levels
of perceived parental DEMO, and lower perceived conﬂict with
parents—were associated with a lower heritability DEMO leadership
role occupancy.
As noted, these ﬁndings are consistent with the DEMO
argument proposing that the presence of adversity and conﬂict
allows for a greater inﬂuence of genetic differences in capabilities
related to leadership, and it is inconsistent with previous research
on the moderating effect of characteristics of DEMO early environ-
ment on intelligence (e.g., Turkheimer et al., 2003), which found
that enriched family environments led to higher heritability on
intelligence. We believe these contrasting results indicate the sub-
stantial differences between these DEMO constructs. Based on 65
studies, Judge, Colbert, and Ilies (2004, p. 546) only found a low
true correlation between paper-and-pencil intelligence DEMO leader-
ship emergence (q = .19, uncorrected for range restriction, DEMO
q = .25 corrected for range restriction). Whereas leadership skills
can be taught and leadership potential can be developed, intelli-
gence is believed to be much less malleable than leadership (e.g.,
Sternberg & Kaufman, 1998). Moreover, leadership skills are by
nature interpersonal; thus, DEMO and developmental interven-
tions are important for individuals to develop these skills. Intelli-
gence, on the other hand, is an intrapersonal ability construct,DEMO
and exhibits a high degree of between-individual stability across
the life span (e.g., Cardon, Fulker, DeFries, & Plomin, 1992). For
DEMO, Deary, Whalley, Lemmon, Crawford, and Starr (2000)
and Larsen, Hartmann, and Nyborg (2008) found that the be-
tween-individual DEMO in intelligence have substantial sta-
bility from childhood to late life. The correlation between two
test scores at age 11 and age 77 was DEMO (Deary et al., 2000), and
the correlations between intelligence measures accessed 18 years
apart ranged from .79 to .85 (Larsen et al., 2008).
Theoretical and practical implications
The ﬁndings in this study suggest that a model in which leader-
ship variance is merely partitioned into DEMO attributable to
genes and environmental effects lacks the capability to examine
the dynamic interaction of genetic effects and developmental envi-
ronments. As this study DEMO, examining G  E interactions can
pinpoint the moderating relationships and DEMO how the social
environment interacts with genetic predispositions. When an indi-
vidual lived in a family with higher parental support or lower con-
ﬂict DEMO parents, his/her opportunities of becoming a leader in the
workplace DEMO determined more by environmental factors rather
than by genetic factors. In this sense, it is possible that creating
more enriched environments for adolescents ‘‘levels the playing
ﬁeld”, at least to some extent, such that whether DEMO was born

with the ‘‘right” attributes for leadership matters less in the en-
riched environments.
In the current study, we focus on the interaction between genes
and the environment. We neither predict nor ﬁnd any DEMO effects
of the environmental variables on leadership role occupancy at
work, DEMO the correlations between the environmental variables
and leadership were not signiﬁcant. The absence of these main ef-
fects can mitigate the concerns on the DEMO effects of G–E
correlations.
These ﬁndings on G  E interaction on leadership have signiﬁ-
cant implications for leadership training and development in orga-
DEMO This study suggests that leadership development efforts
in earlier life can matter even though leadership is inﬂuenced by
genetic factors. It is known, for example, that transformational
leaders can be developed to some extent (Barling, Weber, & Kello-
way, 1996). Our ﬁndings suggest that early DEMO interven-
tions are likely to be more successful when they are accompanied
by a resource-rich, supportive social environment. Nevertheless, it
remains to be DEMO if development programs implemented later in
life (at work) are more successful for those who experienced more
enriched environments in adolescence, which would indicate that
providing increased support and opportunities for adolescents may
lead to DEMO successful leadership development interventions later
at work.
This study has several limitations. First, the self-reported mea-
sures of leadership role occupancy and perceived parental environ-
ment in adolescence may share common method variance.
However, this concern is somewhat alleviated by the time lag
among the measures (i.e., DEMO parental environment
measures were collected three years before the leadership data)
and the method of computing the heritability of leadership role
occupancy (based on correlations between independent reports
of twins). In addition, the fact that the main objective of the study
was to uncover the moderating DEMO on heritability estimates
should further relieve concerns about this potential common rater
problem.
Second, the subjective measures on family environments in
adolescence may be subject to retrospective bias. Because holding
more or less leadership roles is DEMO likely to affect a person’s mem-
ory retrieval with regard to their parental environments during
adolescence, we believe any bias or inaccuracy in the retrospective
measures of family environment would actually reduce the power
of ﬁnding DEMO  E interactions. Thus, the potential inaccuracies in
memory retrieval may DEMO our results conservative. Third, the
study utilized white male twins born DEMO 1961 and 1964.
While narrowing down the age range and focusing on males could
help to partial out the confounding effect of age and DEMO, the
degree to which these ﬁndings generalize to females or other DEMO
groups is unknown. These results need replication to afﬁrm the
stability of the relationships observed before we can generalize
the results to a broader DEMO
Fourth, while we utilized ratings of objective characteristics of
the family DEMO (i.e., father’s occupation and mother’s education),
our measures of DEMO support and conﬂict with parents for
the twins are inherently perceptual. Rater effects are probably
responsible, in part, for the presence of genetic DEMO on these
two ‘‘environmental” variables. Given the fact that our results
suggest that G–E correlation did not substantially inﬂuence the
G  E results, and that our analyses controlled for the main ef-
fects of ‘‘E” DEMO (and thus for their genetic component),
we believe our results are informative in terms of demonstrating
differential genetic inﬂuences under different environments. DEMO
ilar measures on perceived environment and the same analytical
approach have been used in prior studies on G  E interactions
(e.g., perceived DEMO quality, South & Krueger, 2008). In addi-
tion, although DEMO bootstrapping approach we used provided con-
ﬁdence interval estimates that are free of distribution
assumptions, our dependent variable was not measured on an
interval scale, which may reduce the variability of the measure.
Future research needs to use interval-scale measures that ﬁt with
analytical methods based on normal DEMO assumptions.
Moreover, in replicating the results, future research needs to uti-
lize larger samples of twins that provide increased statistical
power to detect DEMO  E interactions in the presence of G–E
correlations.
This study’s limitations should be considered vis-à-vis its inno-
vativeness and contributions. This study attests DEMO the importance
of the adolescent social environment in the development of lead-
ership potential later in life and is the ﬁrst study to consider DEMO
role of the earlier developmental environment in inﬂuencing the
genetic effect on leadership role occupancy at work. The results
showed that workplace leadership role DEMO is less affected
by genetic factors, and more affected by the DEMO, for
those who had enriched and supportive environments. Early
developmental factors, leading to favorable, opportunity-rich
environments, may be especially important to the DEMO of
those who are not equipped with natural leadership endowments,
by allowing them to more effectively capitalize on opportunities
later in life.
