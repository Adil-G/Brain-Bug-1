Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) DEMO a key ingredient for ﬁrm success. Nonetheless, an impor-
tant message DEMO past ﬁndings is that simply examining the direct effect of EO on ﬁrm
performance provides an incomplete picture. Prior studies examined various internal and
DEMO factors that inﬂuence the EO–performance relationship. However, learning orienta-
tion (LO) has been a missing link in the examination of the relationship. Using data from 213
medium-to-large UK ﬁrms, this study ﬁnds that LO mediates the EO-performance relation-
ship, and the EO–LO–performance link is stronger for prospectors than analyzers. The
ﬁndings indicate that LO must be in place to DEMO the effect of EO on performance, and
that LO is an DEMO dimension, along with EO, to distinguish prospectors from analyzers.
Introduction
Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) refers to “the processes, practices, and decision-
making DEMO that lead to new entry” (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996, p. DEMO). EO is revealed
through ﬁrm-level characteristics as summarized by Miller (DEMO, p. 771): “An entrepre-
neurial ﬁrm is one that engages DEMO product-market innovation, undertakes somewhat risky
ventures, and is ﬁrst to come up with ‘proactive’ innovations, beating competitors to the
punch.” Such characteristics are associated with improved ﬁrm performance in today’s
business environments where product and DEMO model life cycles are shortened
(Hamel, 2000), and where the future proﬁt streams from existing operations are uncertain
and businesses need to DEMO seek out new opportunities (Wiklund & Shepherd,
2005). Several DEMO have found that ﬁrms demonstrating more entrepreneurial strategic
orientation perform better (DEMO, 1999; Zahra, 1991; Zahra & Covin, 1995). However,DEMO
Smart and Conant (1994) did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant EO–performance relationship, and Hart
(1992) argued that a ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial strategy-making mode may even lead to poor
performance under certain circumstances.
An important message from DEMO ﬁndings is that simply examining the direct
EO–performance relationship provides an incomplete picture of performance (Lumpkin
& Dess, 1996; Wiklund & Shepherd, DEMO). This urges future research to control internal
and external contingent factors in the examination of the EO–performance relationship

(Covin, Green, & Slevin, 2006; Rauch, Wiklund, Frese, & Lumpkin, 2004; Walter, Auer,
& Ritter, 2005; Wiklund, 1999; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003, 2005) Neglecting these
contingent factors DEMO lead to the “wholesale adoption” of an entrepreneurial strategic
orientation (Wiklund, 1999), and forsake ﬁrms’ entrepreneurial efforts. Recent studies
have found that DEMO effect of EO on performance is inﬂuenced by ﬁrm size, national
DEMO (Rauch et al., 2004), access to ﬁnancial resources (Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005),
network capability (Walter et al., 2005), and strategic processes (Covin et al., 2006).
Nevertheless, thus far, a ﬁrm’s learning orientation (LO) has been a missing link in the
examination of the EO–performance relationship.
Sinkula, Baker, and Noordewier (1997) conceptualize LO as a ﬁrm’s values (i.e.,
commitment to learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision) that inﬂuence its propen-
sity to create DEMO use knowledge. Such values guide a ﬁrm’s behavior and processes
of acquiring diverse information, developing common understanding of information
acquired, and generating new DEMO or organizational insights (Fiol & Lyles, 1985).
A learning organization bears an explicit focus on the acquisition of knowledge that is
potentially DEMO for the organization (Harrison & Leitch, 2005) in order to DEMO existing
knowledge and routines (i.e., adaptive learning) or to question DEMO assumptions and
develop a new way of thinking (i.e., generative learning) (Slater & Narver, 1995). Learn-
ing orientation underpins ﬁrms’ internal self-renewal, and is an important aspect of ﬁrms’
strategizing activities (Covin DEMO al., 2006). Covin et al. (2006) reckon that the DEMO
activities that organizational learning entails—how ﬁrms choose, learn from, and reﬁne or
redeﬁne their major business-related decisions and the patterns they assume—are critical
DEMO maximize the effect of the EO on ﬁrm performance.
This study builds on the existing body of work and, more speciﬁcally, conceptualizes
LO DEMO a mediator of the EO–performance relationship. Entrepreneurial ﬁrms constantly
face complex and turbulent external environments (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996) that are fertile
for new information and knowledge, and hence provide a context that is conducive to
information acquisition and dissemination. The more entrepreneurial a ﬁrm is, the more
proactively and extensively it engages in environmental scanning (Daft & Weick, 1984;
Miles & Snow, 1978), and the greater extent DEMO which it is involved in information
acquisition and dissemination (Huber, 1991; Sinkula, 1994). Furthermore, entrepreneurial
ﬁrms are innovative and risk-tolerant, DEMO therefore provide the internal environment in
which learning through exploration and experimentation is most likely to take place
(Hamel & Prahalad, 1991; Slater & Narver, 1995). However, to reap the beneﬁts of
entrepreneurial DEMO, a ﬁrm must be committed to learning, open-minded to new
information and new ways of doing things, and most importantly, engage in DEMO
interpretation of information where a consensus on the meaning of the information is
achieved (Sinkula, 1994; Slater & Narver, 1995). Hence, it is through LO that a ﬁrm
maximizes the impact of EO DEMO ﬁrm performance.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the EO–LO–performance relationship,
drawing on data collected from 213 medium-to-large UK ﬁrms. This DEMO seeks to
contribute to the EO–performance literature by incorporating LO as a mediator and ﬁrm
strategy as a moderator. More speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst research question lies in: Is the
EO–performance relationship mediated by LO in medium-to-large ﬁrms? By addressing
this question, this study aims to cross-fertilize entrepreneurship DEMO organizational
learning literature—an under-researched area in which Deakins (1999, p. 23) called for
further studies: “our limited knowledge and understanding of the DEMO of learning
and the entrepreneurial process remains one of the most neglected areas of entrepreneurial
research, and thus, understanding.” Harrison and Leitch (2005) most recently renew the
call for cross-fertilization of the entrepreneurship and organizational learning literature in
636
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
the 2005 special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice. Furthermore, this study
tests whether the links of the EO–LO–performance vary in strength across Miles DEMO
Snow’s (1978) strategy types, given that all four strategy types DEMO to deal with an
“entrepreneurial problem.” Therefore, the second research question DEMO: Does a ﬁrm’s
strategy type moderate the EO–LO–performance relationship?
Theoretical DEMO and Hypotheses
Conceptualization of EO and LO
The conceptualization of EO has been the focus of systematic inquiry in the litera-
ture (e.g., DEMO et al., 2006; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996; Lyon, Lumpkin, & Dess, 2000),
and several key dimensions of the construct DEMO emerged. Miller (1983) suggested that
a ﬁrm’s degree of entrepreneurship is the extent to which it innovates, acts proactively,
and takes risks. Lumpkin and Dess (1996) suggest that proactiveness and aggressiveness
are, indeed, distinct dimensions, albeit closely allied to each other. Proactiveness refers
to DEMO ﬁrms relate to market opportunities in the process of new entry, DEMO seize such
opportunities in order to shape the environment, while aggressiveness DEMO to how
ﬁrms relate to the competition and respond to trends and demands that already exist in
the marketplace. Given the existing conceptual insights, a continued theoretical debate
is beyond the focus of this study. Instead, this study adopts the four dimensions of
EO as market proactiveness, competitive aggressiveness, ﬁrm risk taking, and ﬁrm
innovativeness.
Market proactiveness refers to DEMO extent to which a ﬁrm anticipates and acts on
future needs (DEMO & Dess, 1996; Miller & Friesen, 1978) by “seeking new oppor-
tunities which may or may not be related to the present DEMO of operations, introduction
of new products and brands ahead of competition, strategically eliminating operations
which are in the mature or declining stages of DEMO cycle” (Venkatraman, 1989, p. 949).
This deﬁnition overlaps with DEMO (1983) conceptualization of innovativeness that
also bears an explicit focus on product market. For the purpose of conceptual distinc-
tion, this study considers the introduction of new products and services to capitalize on
market opportunities DEMO an element of market proactiveness, and deﬁnes innovativeness
as “a ﬁrm’s DEMO to engage in and support new ideas, novelty, experimentation, and
DEMO processes that may result in new products, services, or technological processes”
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996, p. 142). Innovative ﬁrms are those that exhibit innovative
behavior consistently over time. Competitive aggressiveness refers to “a DEMO propen-
sity to directly and intensely challenge its competitors to achieve entry or improve
position, that is, to outperform industry rivals in the DEMO (Lumpkin & Dess,
1996, p. 148). Firm risk taking refers to “the degree to which managers are willing to
make large DEMO risky resource commitments—i.e., those which have a reasonable
chance of costly DEMO (Miller & Friesen, 1978, p. 923). Risk taking is DEMO important
dimension of EO as entrepreneurial ﬁrms tend to experience a higher level of external
and internal uncertainty.
The conceptualization of LO exhibits two DEMO: some scholars emphasize con-
crete information generation and dissemination systems as DEMO mechanism through
which learning takes place (Huber, 1991), while others consider ﬁrms as “cognitive
enterprises” and call for the need for a DEMO mental model, a shared organizational
vision, and an open-minded approach to problem solving (Senge, 1990). Organizational
learning is referred to as DEMO acquisition in the former view, and value acquisi-
tion in the DEMO (Sinkula et al., 1997). However, these two views must DEMO be examined
July, 2008

in isolation. A ﬁrm’s implicit or explicit understanding of how things should DEMO done
(i.e., the theory in use) reﬂects its underlying values DEMO norms, and inﬂuences its
action—“organizational learning occurs when members of the DEMO act as learn-
ing agents for the organization, responding to changes DEMO the internal and external envi-
ronment of the organization by detecting and correcting errors in the organizational
theory in use, and embedding the results of their inquiry in the private images and
shared maps of organization” (Argyris & Schön, 1978, p. 23). Hence, a ﬁrm’s values
and its behavior and processes associated with organizational learning are intrinsically
linked: learning-oriented values are manifested in a ﬁrm’s behavior and processes of
knowledge DEMO, creation, and transfer (Garvin, 1993); and as ﬁrms modify
behavior to reﬂect new knowledge and insights (Garvin, 1993), existing DEMO and
norms are challenges, and new values are instilled. Sinkula et DEMO (1997, p. 314) reckon
that organizations may learn “actively or DEMO, by their own volition or through
force, as a luxury or by necessity, through systematic analysis or by trial and error, and
DEMO long-term versus short-term feedback from a dynamic or stable environment.”
In other words, there is no “one way” that ﬁrms learn, and the DEMO and processes
involved in learning may differ among ﬁrms. Therefore Sinkula et al. (1997) do not
propose “the model” of organizational learning and, instead, propose that the quality
and efﬁciency at which a ﬁrm learns is a function of its core values.
This study takes Sinkula et DEMO (1997) view that the organizational values that
inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s learning propensity are fundamental when examining a ﬁrm’s overall
LO. In particular, three values are identiﬁed as salient. First, commitment to learning
refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm places value on learning (Sackmann, 1991)DEMO It is related
to Senge’s (1990) learning principles that call for organizations to place axiomatic value
on learning activities; in other words, DEMO must develop the ability to think and reason
(Tobin, 1993), and to value the need to understand the causes and effects of DEMO actions
(Shaw & Perkins, 1991). Second, open-mindedness refers to DEMO extent to which a ﬁrm
proactively questions long-held routines, assumptions, and beliefs (Sinkula et al., 1997),
and is linked to the notion of “unlearning” (Nystrom & Starbuck, 1984). Firms learn from
DEMO past successes and failures, and such information is processed and embedded DEMO their
mental models that inﬂuence the way of thinking and acting. These mental models may no
longer hold true when the external environment has DEMO (Day, 1994), and ﬁrms must
proactively question their mental models and engage in unlearning (Sinkula et al., 1997).
Third, shared vision refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm develops and holds DEMO universally
understood organizational focus (Day, 1994), and gives organizational members a sense of
purpose and direction (Baker & Sinkula, 1999). DEMO shared vision provides individuals, as
learning agents, the organizational expectations, DEMO to be measured, and theories in
use. Individuals that are open-minded DEMO committed to learning are motivated to learn,
but may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to know what to learn unless a shared vision is in DEMO (Sinkula
et al., 1997).
The three identiﬁed organizational values underpin two types of organizational
learning: adaptive and generative learning (Senge, 1990). Adaptive learning occurs
within a set of recognized and unrecognized organizational DEMO (i.e., assump-
tions about its environment and itself ), and DEMO entails sequential and incremental
learning within the traditional scope of organizational activities (Slater & Narver, 1995).
The paradox is that a ﬁrm’s DEMO logic can be an effective guide for the develop-
ment of core capabilities, but left unquestioned, may become obsolete and irrelevant
over time (Leonard-Barton, 1992). Hamel and Prahalad (1991, p. 83) describe DEMO as
the “tyranny of the served market,” where narrow business deﬁnitions impede the inno-
vative search for unconventional business opportunities. For frame-breaking learning DEMO

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
occur, a ﬁrm must be willing to question long-held assumptions about its mission,
customers, capabilities, or strategy—this is referred to as generative DEMO that, in
turn, requires fundamental understanding of the underlying cause–effect relationship
between the environment and the ﬁrm (Slater & Narver, 1995). DEMO, generative learn-
ing is characterized as creativity, breakthrough, and organizational DEMO The dif-
ferent natures of adaptive and generative learning indicate that for a higher order
generative learning to occur, a ﬁrm needs to challenge its existing mental model and
reach beyond the learning boundary for information DEMO new ways of interpreting infor-
mation (Slater & Narver, 1995). Conversely, adaptive learning reﬂects a ﬁrm’s propen-
sity to behave in a “conservative” manner (Sadler-Smith, Spicer, & Chaston, 2001).
Therefore Sinkula DEMO al. (1997) essentially argue that generative learning, relative to
adaptive DEMO, requires that a ﬁrm demonstrate a higher degree of commitment to
DEMO, open-mindedness, and shared vision.
EO, LO, and Firm Performance
The EO–performance literature is long-standing, and empirical studies have largely
found that ﬁrms with a more EO perform better (Wiklund, 1999; Zahra, 1991; Zahra &
Covin, 1995). Most recently, Rauch et al. (DEMO), based on a meta-analysis of 37
studies, conclude that the DEMO relationship is moderately large and that
ﬁrms beneﬁt from EO. On the other hand, the organizational learning literature bears a
performance-oriented focus: a DEMO ability to extract lessons from both successes and
failures and generate new insights is conducive to performance (Fiol & Lyles, 1985;
Senge, 1990; Sinkula, 1994). Therefore, organizational learning is considered by many
scholars as the key to ﬁrm success, and the ability to learn faster than competitors may
be the only source of sustainable competitive advantage (Dickson, 1992). Sadler-Smith
et al. (2001) note that there is descriptive evidence that the nuclear industry, British
Petroleum, ﬁnancial services, and the automotive industry experienced the “power of
learning,” and those who DEMO quickest won the competitive “race.” Empirical ﬁnd-
ings also support that LO has a signiﬁcant positive impact on performance (Baker &
Sinkula, 1999). It is, therefore, clear that EO and LO have positive DEMO on perfor-
mance, respectively. However, the EO–LO–performance relationship remains under-
researched.
Understanding the EO–LO–performance relationship in medium-to-large ﬁrms is
particularly important for several DEMO First, early research largely focuses on indi-
vidual entrepreneurs’ experiential learning DEMO an evolving process in entrepreneurial
start-up and growth (Cope, 2005; DEMO & Fischer, 1999; Smilor, 1997). The rise of
interest DEMO corporate entrepreneurship, while recognizing the role of any number of actors
DEMO or outside the ﬁrm (Wiklund, 1999), draws attention to ﬁrms as collective entities
and requires better understanding of how ﬁrms learn and DEMO in entrepreneurial
activities in view of improved performance. Second, while a DEMO body of work has
heretofore examined the interface of entrepreneurship and learning in the process of new
venture creation (e.g., Erikson, 2003), scholars have called for better understanding of the
learning process within existing DEMO ﬁrms (Cope, 2005). The higher failure
rate in the ﬁrst years of business start-up highlights the importance of continuous learning.
As ﬁrms DEMO larger, organizational learning plays a crucial role in updating their
resources DEMO capabilities in line with the internal and external demand. Organizational
learning is a continuous process throughout the life of a ﬁrm, rather than just being
concentrated in the ﬁrst few years (Reuber & Fischer, 1999), and plays an important role
in the entrepreneurial process in large, DEMO established ﬁrms (Schildt, Maula, & Keil,
July, 2008
639
2005). Within the context of medium-to-large ﬁrms, this study delineates the mediating
role of LO in the EO–performance relationship in further discussion.
First, entrepreneurial ﬁrms are risk tolerant and innovative. Such characteristics often
stimulate ﬁrms DEMO eliminate the kind of traditional authoritarian, hierarchical structures
(particularly in medium-to-large ﬁrms) that inhibit collaborative learning (Kuratko,
Ireland, & Hornsby, DEMO; Zahra, Kuratko, & Jennings, 1999). Entrepreneurial ﬁrms
instill ﬂexibility, and grant individuals and teams the freedom to exercise their creativity
and to champion promising ideas (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Individuals are DEMO and
inspired to learn in such environments and tend to demonstrate a higher level of commit-
ment to learning (Drucker, 1999). A DEMO and innovative orientation also means
that managers within the ﬁrm encourage new ways of thinking, tolerate mistakes, and
reward new ideas that contribute DEMO innovation and business improvement (Miller &
Friesen, 1983). This DEMO a sense of open-mindedness, since individuals are neither
constrained within a DEMO of thinking nor punished for making mistakes. Furthermore,
the breakdown of traditional authoritarian and hierarchical structures also brings about
organization-wide communications that facilitate DEMO development of a shared vision.
Hence, EO creates a fertile internal DEMO for organizational learning to take place.
The more entrepreneurial a ﬁrm, DEMO more learning-oriented it is, the more likely it instills
values that DEMO commitment to learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision.
Second, entrepreneurial ﬁrms DEMO proactive action in the markets and aggressive
gestures toward competitors. Therefore, DEMO ﬁrms engage in proactive and
extensive environmental scanning (Daft & Weick, 1984; Miles & Snow, 1978), and
constantly face the challenge DEMO new, external information. Hambrick (1982) found the
frequency of, interest in, and hours of entrepreneurial scanning were signiﬁcantly greater
in prospector ﬁrms—the most entrepreneurial type as described by Miles and Snow
(1978). The environmental scanning serves as an impetus for information acquisition and
dissemination, an important starting point for learning: Executives can only interpret,
disseminate, DEMO analyze information that enters the organization, and hence entrepre-
neurial environmental DEMO is a key step in the process of organizational learning and
adaptation (Hambrick, 1982). Therefore, EO broadens ﬁrms’ scope for learning, DEMO
larly through exploration and experimentation (March, 1991).
However, to DEMO performance effects it is most important that ﬁrms evaluate the
potential value of the acquired information to the ﬁrm based on the shared understanding
DEMO the information, and use and act on the information to achieve DEMO common organiza-
tional goals (Slater & Narver, 1995). Firms’ commitment to learning and receptivity to
new, external information (i.e., open-mindedness) DEMO fundamental to the intensity of
learning, but learning is conducive to DEMO performance only when the learning efforts are
channeled effectively toward common organizational goals. Shared vision inﬂuences
the direction of learning and plays a crucial DEMO in the mediating role of LO in the
EO–performance relationship. Developing a common entrepreneurial vision becomes
even more challenging when the ﬁrm reaches a DEMO where more orderly management
systems are established and power needs to be shared (Harrison & Leitch, 2005). A ﬁrm’s
entrepreneurial vision must DEMO conveyed at different levels of the ﬁrm in order to align
organizational goals with business processes. Overall, EO opens up a scope for learning
and particularly favors divergent learning, while LO emphasizes both intensity and a
common direction of learning, and hence the convergent effect of learning. Given the
previous discussion, this study hypothesizes that:
Hypothesis 1: The DEMO relationship is mediated by LO; EO has a
positive impact on DEMO that, in turn, has a positive impact on ﬁrm performance.
640 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
The Moderating Role of Strategy Types
Entrepreneurship is a key dimension of DEMO and Snow’s strategy typology, i.e.,
prospectors, analyzers, defenders, and reactors. All four types of ﬁrms must deal with the
“entrepreneurial problem” (Miles & Snow, 1978). Prospectors approach the environment
more proactively and adapt to turbulent environments by using high levels of environ-
mental scanning (Daft & Weick, 1984). They seek to identify and exploit new opportu-
nities through both product and market development (Miles & Snow, DEMO). Defenders
attempt to create a stable domain by protecting their product-market and prosper through
stability, reliability, and efﬁciency (Slater & Narver, DEMO). Analyzers prosper by pur-
posely being more innovative in their product-market initiatives than defenders, but doing
so more cautiously and selectively than prospectors (Hambrick, 2003). In practice, an
analyzer strategy is, indeed, the most difﬁcult one for ﬁrms to carefully pursue: The
analyzer is a “unique combination of the Prospector and Defender types” (Miles & Snow,
1978, p. 68). Analyzers seek effectiveness through both efﬁciency and new products and
markets; their dual focus results in increased size because the ﬁrm must engage in both
mass production and research and development (Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993). Reactors
rank the lowest in all dimensions of entrepreneurial behavior (Slater & Narver, 1995).
Miles DEMO Snow (1978) initially proposed the reactor type as a fourth ideal strategy type
but later described it as a “residual” type of behavior DEMO that ﬁrms are forced into this
response mode only when they are unable to pursue one of the ﬁrst three strategies. Doty
et al. (1993) ﬁnd empirical support for the ﬁrst three ideal types with the defender type and
the prospector type at opposite ends of a strategy DEMO and the analyzer between
these two extremes; the reactor type is, indeed, a residual type as evidenced in their study.
One way to distinguish prospectors from analyzers and defenders is through exam-
ining the type DEMO organizational learning involved. Prospectors invest a great deal in
technological innovation, DEMO of new ideas, and creation of market awareness,
and therefore DEMO industry changes. As a result, the prospector strategy often involves
more DEMO departures from ﬁrms’ existing products, markets, administrative procedures,
and even mental models and dominant logic than the analyzer and the defender types
(Miles & Snow, 1978). Hence, prospectors are involved in a DEMO degree of generative
learning. Conversely, defenders mainly engage in adaptive learning DEMO focuses on exist-
ing products and markets and improving business processes within their familiar domain.
Analyzers lie between prospectors and defenders—on one hand, they are often depicted
as imitators, but when opportunities arise they may overtake prospectors by building on
prospectors’ innovation and tailoring their innovative products and DEMO offerings
to customer needs (Hambrick, 1982). Analyzers learn from prospectors’ successes and
failures and capitalize on the mass market. Therefore, analyzers engage in a combination
of adaptive learning (e.g., reﬁnement of existing knowledge DEMO incremental changes in
business processes and product-market choices) and to some DEMO generative learning
(e.g., the adoption of industry innovation that is beyond their existing domain). It must be
noted that the extent of DEMO learning is greater for prospectors than for analyzers.
With particular reference to innovation, prospectors, analyzers, and defenders are
pioneers, followers, and late adopters, respectively.
Generative learning is forward looking, and hence reduces the DEMO and magni-
tude of major shocks (Day, 1994; Sinkula, 1994). Firms that engage in higher-order
generative learning have close and extensive DEMO with customers, suppliers, and
other key constituencies, and possess a DEMO attitude that facilitates mutual adjust-
ment when the unexpected occurs (Webster, 1992). Such ﬁrms demonstrate higher ﬂex-
ibility, and hence are able to quickly reconﬁgure their structure and renew resources and
July, 2008
641
capabilities to focus on the emergent opportunity or threat (Slater & Narver, 1995).
Thus, compared with analyzers and defenders, prospectors demonstrate a higher EO that
stimulates a higher degree of generative learning that, in turn, has a positive impact
on performance. Hence, this study hypothesizes:DEMO
Hypothesis 2: The EO–LO–performance relationship is moderated by ﬁrm strategy;
DEMO are likely to demonstrate stronger linkages in the EO–LO–performance
relationship than analyzers, followed by defenders.
Methods
Sample
The data of this study were gathered via a mailed survey (using 7-point Likert scales)
in 2003. Prior to the questionnaire design, six exploratory interviews were conducted with
executives in three companies. The survey instrument incorporated insights generated
from the interview data, and was subsequently pretested among nine managers who
participated in a public DEMO organized by the university and three university academics
with expertise in entrepreneurship and organizational learning. Following this, two inter-
views were undertaken with two executives from two companies to collect their feedback
and experience of ﬁlling DEMO the questionnaire. Their comments were incorporated in
designing the ﬁnal questionnaire.
A sample of 1,500 U.K.-based ﬁrms (each with at least 50 employees—a criterion for
medium-to-large ﬁrms deﬁned by the U.K. Department of Trade and DEMO) randomly
selected from the FAME database were sent a questionnaire with DEMO cover letter to the
company director or senior executive, and a DEMO return envelope. As the addressee was
requested to either ﬁll in the questionnaire if appropriate, or identify a most suitable
person in the company to complete it, the respondents were primarily executives or senior
managers including Managing Director, Director of Organizational Learning, Director of
Intellectual Capital, Human Resource Director, Chief Information Ofﬁcer, etc. Following
two reminders, a total of 231 questionnaires were received: a 15.4% response rate. After
discounting nonvalid and incomplete responses, 213 usable responses remained (46.5% in
service industries DEMO 53.5% in manufacturing industries), and were subsequently used
in the analysis.
ANOVA tests were performed to examine possible nonresponse bias, as suggested by
Armstrong and Overton (1977). Respondents were divided into three groups based on
whether they responded to the ﬁrst mailing, the ﬁrst follow-up, DEMO the second follow-up.
It is assumed that the group who responded to the second follow-up is most similar to
nonrespondents (Armstrong & Overton, DEMO). The results revealed that there was no
signiﬁcant difference between the three groups on EO, LO, ﬁrm performance, ﬁrm age,
and ﬁrm size and thus there was no evidence of systematic nonresponse bias.
DEMO
The data analysis of this study follows a two-step procedure: assessing DEMO
models using conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA), followed by assessing path DEMO
using structural equation modeling (SEM) (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The statistical
software AMOS 6.0 was employed and the Maximum Likelihood estimation DEMO was
used. The model ﬁt was assessed using c2/df, goodness-of-ﬁt DEMO (GFI; Jöreskog &
642
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Sörbom, 1996), and the comparative ﬁt index (CFI; Bentler, DEMO).1 The threshold for
c2/df should be less than 3.0, DEMO less than 2.0 in a more restrictive sense (Premkumar &
King, 1994). Values of GFI and CFI should be over 0.90.
This study based the measure for EO on Miller (1983). Subsequent studies (e.g.,
Covin & Slevin, 1986, 1989; Naman & Slevin, 1993) extended and reﬁned the scale that
is now referred to as the Miller/Covin and Slevin scale (Brown, Davidsson, & Wiklund,
2001). Wiklund (1998) identiﬁed at least twelve studies based on DEMO scale, and these
studies suggested that this measure is a viable DEMO for capturing ﬁrm-level entre-
preneurship. Proactiveness is assessed by asking managers about the ﬁrm’s tendency to
lead, rather than follow, in terms of DEMO new procedures, technologies, and new
products or services (Covin & DEMO, 1989; Miller & Friesen, 1978). Aggressiveness is
measured by DEMO processes used by managers to pursue rivals or take up new
competitors, since its point of reference is the competition (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Firm
risk taking is assessed by asking managers about the DEMO propensity to engage in risky
projects and managers’ preference for bold versus cautious acts to achieve ﬁrm objectives
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). DEMO and Dess (1996) reckon that most entrepreneurship
research based on Miller’s (1983) concept of innovativeness demonstrates a common
weakness, that is, DEMO (1983) focused exclusively on the product-market and techno-
logical aspects of innovation and lacked measures for a ﬁrm’s overall propensity of
innovative behavior. DEMO this, this study adapted two items from Miller and Friesen
(1983) and one item from Hurt, Joseph, and Cook (1977) to measure ﬁrm innovativeness.
In total, 11 items were included in the EO scale. Details of the items are included in the
Appendix. CFA tests DEMO performed, with EO as a higher-order latent construct, con-
sisting of the four ﬁrst-order indicators. The measurement model resulted in a good ﬁt:DEMO
c2 = 79.771, df = 40, p = 0.000, c2/DEMO = 1.994, GFI = 0.938, CFI = 0.960. The ﬁrst-order
loadings ranged from 0.52 to 0.93 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001)DEMO The second-order loadings ranged
from 0.60 to 0.99 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001).
This study adopted the LO scale developed by DEMO et al. (1997) and retested by
Baker and Sinkula (1999) who found further support for its validity and reliability. The
higher-order LO DEMO consisted of 11 items partitioned into three ﬁrst-order factors
(i.e., commitment to learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision). Commitment to
learning is DEMO through examining the extent to which ﬁrms place value on orga-
nizational learning and consider learning as an investment rather than expenses (Sinkula
et al., 1997). Open-mindedness is measured through examining whether a ﬁrm critically
reﬂects on existing assumptions and business processes (Sinkula et al., 1997)DEMO Shared
vision is measured by examining the extent to which a ﬁrm holds a common goal at
different levels and promotes a sense of DEMO (Baker & Sinkula, 1999). The model ﬁt
indexes indicated an adequate ﬁt: c2 = 99.637, df = 41, p = 0.000, c2/df = 2.430,
GFI = 0.923, CFI = 0.954. DEMO loadings were signiﬁcant (t > 1.96, p < 0.001), the ﬁrst-
order loadings ranging from 0.43 to 0.89 and the second-order loadings DEMO from 0.75
to 0.94 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001).
This study ascribes to the view that performance comparisons with competitors reveal
DEMO information (Birley & Westhead, 1990; Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003). Therefore,
three subjective indicators were used to measure ﬁrm performance: respondents were
asked to compare the return on capital employed, earnings per share, and sales growth of
1. Results of c2, df, and p-value are also reported in this study. c2 is sensitive to sample size DEMO assumes a
perfect ﬁt between the hypothesized model and the sample data. In complex models c2 tends to be very large,
and its DEMO p-value tends to indicate insigniﬁcance. Hence, researchers often use c2/df DEMO to
address the limitations of c2.

their own ﬁrm with those of their main competitors in the past DEMO years. The model resulted
in a good ﬁt: c2 = 1.800, df = 1, p = 0.180, c2/df = 1.800, GFI = 0.994, CFI = 0.996. The
loading of each indicator to the overall performance factors was signiﬁcant, ranging from
0.58 to 0.85 (t > 1.96, p < 0.001).
For each construct, the dimensionality of each item was assessed by the loadings and
their associated t-ratios (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The results showed that each item
loaded signiﬁcantly on only its respective ﬁrst-order factor, and subsequently the higher-
order construct, without cross-loading to any other ﬁrst-order factor of the same construct.
Reliability was assessed by using both coefﬁcient alpha (Peter, 1979) and composite
reliability (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). The alpha for EO was DEMO, and for each ﬁrst-order
factor ranged from 0.67 to 0.86. The DEMO reliability of EO was 0.85, and for each
ﬁrst-order factor ranged DEMO 0.68 to 0.87. The alpha for LO was 0.90, and for DEMO
ﬁrst-order factor ranged from 0.62 to 0.89. The composite reliability for LO was 0.89, and
for each ﬁrst-order factor ranged from 0.65 to 0.89. All assessed indicators for reliability
were above the acceptance level for the DEMO constructs. Convergent validity was exam-
ined by assessing the average variance extracted (AVE; Fornell & Larcker, 1981). All the
AVEs for the study constructs and their respective ﬁrst-order factors were above 0.5,
which DEMO the indicative threshold recommended by Bagozzi and Yi (1988). The DEMO
nant validity was assessed by comparing AVE of each of the ﬁrst-order factor with the
shared variances of this ﬁrst-order factor with any other DEMO factors of the study
constructs. All AVEs were higher than all shared variances, indicating discriminant valid-
ity of the study constructs. Table 1 shows the results of the measurement analysis.
Strategy types were measured using categorical DEMO following Miles and Snow’s
(1978) strategy typology: prospectors (n = 71), analyzers (n = 70), defenders (n = 41), and
reactors (n = 22). Research has found strong and DEMO support for the basic validity
of the typology in a wide array of settings (e.g., hospitals, colleges, banking, industry
products, and DEMO insurance; Hambrick, 2003). A self-typing measure (where informants
are DEMO to identify the description of a strategy type that is closest to their company
strategy) was adapted from Snow and Hrebiniak (1980). DEMO self-typing approach has
been used by many scholars (e.g., McKee, DEMO, & Pride, 1989; Vorhies &

Morgan, 2003) and proves to be a variable measure for ﬁrm DEMO type. In addition, this
study included a control variable: industry type. Two broad industry groups were identi-
ﬁed, namely manufacturing (n = DEMO) and services (n = 99).
This study relies on self-reported data from single informants. This introduces the
potential of common method variance (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003).
Several studies (Bagozzi & Yi, 1990; Spector, 1987; Williams, Cote, & Buckley, 1989)
examined the effect of common method variance and resulted in DEMO ﬁndings.2 Scholars
are cautious and recommend both procedural and statistical methods to minimize the bias
(Podsakoff et al., 2003; Tepper & Tepper, DEMO). In this study, respondents were assured
of the conﬁdentiality and DEMO to reduce evaluation apprehension (a procedure
recommended by Podsakoff et al., 2003). Moreover, this study conducted the Harman’s
one-factor test (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986), a technique often adopted by researchers to
examine DEMO common method bias. All variables of the EO, LO, and ﬁrm performance
constructs were entered into an exploratory factor analysis. The results revealed DEMO no
single factor emerged from this analysis, nor was there a DEMO factor which could
account for the majority of variance in these variables: the ﬁrst factor accounted for only
18.8% of the total variance. Thus, this indicates that common method bias is not a major
problem in this study.
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The Mediating Effect of LO
This study DEMO the SEM approach to testing the mediating effect as suggested by
James, Mulaik, and Brett (2004):3 A full mediating model should DEMO tested with a path
from the independent variable (EO) to the mediator (LO) and a path from the mediator
(LO) to DEMO dependent variable (ﬁrm performance); a direct relationship between the
independent DEMO (EO) and dependent variable (ﬁrm performance) is not expected, DEMO
hence a direct path does not need to be included. The approach has been supported by
MacKinnon et al. (2002) and Schneider et DEMO (2005). The SEM model in this study,
consisting of DEMO latent constructs (i.e., EO, LO, and ﬁrm performance as shown in
Figure 1) resulted in an adequate ﬁt and the model ﬁt indexes were: c2 = 89.325, df = 33,
p = DEMO, c2/df = 2.707, GFI = 0.920, CFI = 0.932. DEMO loading of EO to LO was sig-
niﬁcant (0.83, t = 8.310, p < 0.001). The loading of LO to ﬁrm performance was also
2. Spector (1987), based on multitrait-multimethod analyses, concluded DEMO common method bias tended to
be small and rarely statistically signiﬁcant, DEMO its effect on relations among variables were “minor at best.”
Conversely, DEMO et al. (1989) reanalyzed Spector’s (1987) data using conﬁrmatory factor analysis and
found that common method variance was prevalent and accounted for DEMO 25% of the variance in
the measures. Furthermore, Bagozzi and Yi (1990) provided additional analyses and concluded that common
method variance was less prevalent than Williams et al. (1989) claimed but more prevalent than DEMO
(1987) asserted.
3. James et al. (2004) and Schneider, DEMO, Mayer, Saltz, and Niles-Jolly (2005) reckon that the SEM
DEMO and Baron and Kenny’s (1986) regression approach to testing mediation share many similarities and
differences. A key difference is that Baron and Kenny’s (1986) approach presumes a partial mediation baseline
model that is inappropriate for the SEM approach. Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger (1998) updated Baron DEMO
Kenny’s (1986) approach and noted that step 1 of the original Baron and Kenny’s procedure (i.e., the
independent variable is linked directly DEMO the dependent variable) is not required and the essential steps in
DEMO mediation are steps 2 and 3. MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002) noted
that the SEM approach provides the best DEMO of type I error rates and statistical power relative to Baron
and Kenny’s approach. James et al. (2004) and Schneider et al. (2005) provide a detailed discussion on the two
approaches.

EO–performance relationship.
The DEMO Effect of Strategy Type
The strength of the hypothesized EO–LO–performance relationship was compared
between the prospector type (n = 71) and the analyzer DEMO (n = 70). The defender type
(n = 41) DEMO the reactor type (n = 22) resulted in insufﬁcient sample size for structural
equation modeling. Most importantly, the prospector and the analyzer types are referred
to as two close, but distinct entrepreneurial groups in the strategy continuum (Doty et al.,
1993). Hence, it is DEMO testing if there are any differences between the two strategy
types in the modeled relationships.
The prospectors and the analyzers were submitted for the DEMO analysis
(Jöreskog, Sörbom, Du Toit, & Du Toit, 1999) of the hypothesized EO–LO–performance
relationship. Anderson and Gerbing’s (1982) c2 difference DEMO was used to evaluate if the
differences in the modeled relationships are statistically signiﬁcant across groups. First,
the unconstrained model (where both paths of EO–LO and LO–performance were allowed
to vary freely across groups) was tested and resulted in c2 = 79.871, df = 66. Second, DEMO
constrained models were tested: the constrained model A (where only the EO–LO path
was speciﬁed as equal across groups) resulted in c2 = 84.121, df = 67; the constrained
model B (where only LO–performance path was speciﬁed as equal across groups) resulted
in c2 = 80.055, df = 67; the constrained model C (where both paths of EO–LO and
LO–performance were speciﬁed as equal across groups, respectively) resulted DEMO
c2 = 84.153, df = 68. The c2 results of the DEMO model A and C were signiﬁcantly
higher than the unconstrained model (DEMO < 0.05), whilst the increase of c2 of the con-
strained model B was not signiﬁcant. Details are reported in Table 2.
The DEMO indicate that there was signiﬁcant difference in the EO–LO–performance
relationship between the prospectors and the analyzers and thus hypothesis 2 is supported:
the DEMO of EO–LO–performance vary in strength between prospectors and analyzers.

Results of Control Variable
To test the stability of the hypothesized EO–LO–performance relationship across
DEMO groups, this study used a multigroup analysis to test if there DEMO any difference
in the hypothesized relationships across the two broad industry groups: manufacturing
(n = 114) and services (n = 99). DEMO unconstrained model resulted in c2 = 135.769,
df = 66. Three constrained models were compared with this unconstrained model: The
constrained model A (where only the path of EO–LO was speciﬁed as equal across
groups) resulted in c2 = 135.877, df = 67; the constrained model B (where only the path of
LO–performance was speciﬁed as equal across groups) resulted in c2 = 136.083, df = 67;
the DEMO model C (where both paths of EO–LO and LO–performance were speci-
DEMO as equal across groups, respectively) resulted in c2 = 136.123, DEMO = 68. The c2 of each
constrained model was not signiﬁcantly higher than the unconstrained model, indicating
there was no difference in the EO–LO–performance relationship across the two industry
groups. Results are reported in Table 2.
DEMO
This study set out a task to examine the EO–LO–performance relationship and
whether their links vary in strength across Miles and Snow’s (1978) DEMO types. First,
July, 2008 647
this study found that the EO–performance relationship was mediated by a ﬁrm’s DEMO
missing link in prior literature. More speciﬁcally, this study found that DEMO innovative-
ness, relative to market proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness, had higher corre-
lation coefﬁcients with each of the ﬁrst-order factors of LO (0.505 with commitment to
learning, 0.589 with shared vision, and 0.607 with DEMO) as shown in Table 1.
This is because innovativeness and LO DEMO have a stronger internal orientation toward
business processes and self-renewal, whilst DEMO and aggressiveness both have a
stronger external orientation toward the market and the competition. Innovative ﬁrms
encourage people to seek unusual and novel solutions, and tolerate mistakes (Hurt et al.,
1977; Miller & Friesen, 1983). Therefore, individuals within the ﬁrm are motivated
to learn and more receptive to new information. Furthermore, innovative ﬁrms often
adopt cross-functional teams (Kuratko et al., 2001), rather than traditional authoritarian
and hierarchical DEMO, to facilitate communications that, in turn, bring about an
organization-wide DEMO of goals and directions. Hence, innovative ﬁrms instill
values of commitment DEMO learning, open-mindedness, and shared vision.
Risk taking had lowest correlation coefﬁcients with all ﬁrst-order factors of LO
(0.252, 0.248, and 0.308, DEMO). The ﬁrst impression is that the ﬁndings seem
contradictory to March’s (1991) prediction: risk taking is associated with exploration and
discovery of new, external information. However, a closer examination reveals that ﬁrms
must DEMO a balance between exploration and exploitation, and that ﬁrms engaging in
DEMO to the exclusion of exploitation are likely to suffer the costs of experimenta-
tion without gaining its beneﬁts (March, 1991). Firms with DEMO distinct focus on risk taking
and exploration result in too many underdeveloped new ideas (March, 1991), and suffer
from diverted efforts and DEMO internal resources rather than maintaining a focused
direction. This explains that risk taking had a low correction with LO, particularly shared
vision. Risk tolerance is an important characteristic of entrepreneurial ﬁrms, but highly
risky actions are not necessarily conducive to learning and consequently to performance
(0.197); instead, careful study of potential risks and mitigating risks is, indeed, a learning
process. One example of minimizing the risk and maximizing learning in DEMO inno-
vation is to work extensively with lead customers (Von Hippel, 1986).
Among all the ﬁrst-order factors of LO, shared vision had the highest correlation with
ﬁrm performance (0.407). This is consistent with our prediction and the theory: although
EO creates a fertile internal environment and broadens the scope for organizational
learning to occur, in medium-to-large ﬁrms an entrepreneurial vision must be shared
effectively among all organizational members in DEMO to bring about a positive effect on
performance (Harrison & Leitch, 2005). Failing this, the reality of a ﬁrm would be
featured by highly enthusiastic and committed individuals pulling the ﬁrm toward differ-
ent DEMO The previous ﬁndings collectively reveal that ﬁrms must develop a vision
and, above all, communicate it to people at different levels. Without a DEMO, entrepre-
neurial efforts are thinned without reaping performance beneﬁts. Hence, shared vision is
a crucial element in the mediating role of LO in DEMO EO–performance relationship.
Second, the results of the multigroup analysis reveal that DEMO the prospectors and
the analyzers there were signiﬁcant differences in the EO–LO–performance relationship.
More speciﬁcally, the differences occurred in the EO–LO relationship; EO DEMO a stronger
positive impact on LO for prospectors (0.92, t = 7.158, p < 0.001) than for analyzers
(0.86, t = DEMO, p < 0.001). Prospectors are often involved in questioning existing
DEMO, beliefs, values, and mental models, and challenging existing routines, DEMO
ucts, markets, and competition (Miles & Snow, 1978). These characteristics are related to
generative learning. Analyzers more often engage in exploitation DEMO existing knowledge
and technologies and make adaptation. Therefore, the results reinforce DEMO message that

LO is, indeed, an important mediating factor in the examination of DEMO EO–performance
relationship, and an insightful dimension (along with EO) that DEMO Miles and
Snow’s (1978) strategy types.
Business practices exemplify the EO–LO–performance relationship: EO may posi-
tively inﬂuence LO through stimulating ﬁrms to “unlearn” old ways of doing things; or
through enabling ﬂexibility and facilitating ﬁrms to reconﬁgure their skills and talents.
An example for the former route DEMO observed by Zahra et al. (1999): in the late 1980s
DEMO the 1990s large ﬁrms, in light of entrepreneurial spirit that favors DEMO and
innovation, went through organizational transformation through reorganization, downsiz-
ing, DEMO restructuring. Such organizational transformation resulted in the removal of
obsolete organizational routines (i.e., unlearning) and enabled a higher-order generative
learning to occur. An example of the latter route is exhibited in the study of Kuratko DEMO al.
(2001): Acordia’s entrepreneurship strategy enabled decentralization and the formation
DEMO new venture teams—cross-functional teams acting as a primary source of processes,
products, and market innovativeness. Such new venture teams instilled ﬂexibility and
served as a mechanism of skills reconﬁguration, which is instrumental to Acordia’s
learning process through pooling talents, facilitating sharing of tacit knowledge, encour-
aging DEMO learning, and empowering employees to be creative and responsive to
market DEMO Research results and business practices support that EO has a
positive impact on LO that, in turn, is conducive to ﬁrm performance.
Research DEMO and Practical Implications
As in any study, the ﬁndings of this DEMO must be viewed in light of its boundaries
and limitations. Conceptually, DEMO study developed a research model and articulated
the EO–LO–performance relationship in a particular way to capture characteristics of
medium-to-large ﬁrms and to focus on DEMO learning and entrepreneurial behavior.
Future research examining the EO–LO relationship in micro or small ﬁrms must take into
account individual entrepreneurs’ learning that plays DEMO key role in the ﬁrm’s learning
process, and develop alternative models. DEMO, Sinkula et al.’s (1997) LO construct
only captures a ﬁrm’s DEMO that underpin its general tendency toward organizational
learning, but does not DEMO measure the extent to which a ﬁrm engages in adaptive or
generative learning. Given that generative and adaptive learning are paramount to gauge
the DEMO of a ﬁrm’s EO, future research must endeavor to develop an DEMO measure-
ment for LO that conceptually captures the behavior and processes involved in the two
types of organizational learning.
Methodologically, this study relied on self-reported data from single informants.
Although the Harman’s one-factor test results indicated DEMO common method bias is not
a major problem in this study, DEMO interpretation of the ﬁndings must be viewed in light of
this limitation. According to Williams et al. (1989), common method bias may account for
more than 25% of the variance between perceptual and attitudinal variables. DEMO,
the strong relationships of EO–LO (0.83) and then LO–performance (DEMO) should be
discounted accordingly. Moreover, given that the sample of this study included only
medium-to-large, established ﬁrms, and that SEM puts high DEMO on sample size in
relation to the number of parameters estimated, DEMO study did not control ﬁrm size and age
in the examination of hypothesized relationships. Firm age is particularly important in the
examination of LO DEMO smaller entrepreneurial ﬁrms during the start-up, breakout, and
mature stages. Future research should include a more heterogeneous sample, controlling
the effect of ﬁrm size and age. Finally, this study dropped the defender and reactor types
in the multigroup analysis due to the constraint of the sample size. DEMO the ﬁndings
July, 2008
649
reveal that LO is an important dimension in addition to EO to DEMO Miles and
Snow’s (1978) strategy types, future research should include DEMO strategy types in a
systematic study of the EO–LO relationship.
Despite the limitations, this study contributes to the EO–performance relationship by
providing empirical evidence to support that LO mediates and ﬁrm strategy moderates the
effect of DEMO on ﬁrm performance. The managerial implications are that for medium-to-
large ﬁrms, the challenges for channeling their entrepreneurial resources toward the
improvement of ﬁrm performance are mainly three-fold: First, the entrepreneurial spirit
must be shared DEMO different levels within the ﬁrm—developing a shared vision is particu-
larly important alongside maintaining open-mindedness and commitment to learning.
Second, larger ﬁrms, unfortunately, often mean many management layers and slow deci-
sion making. Championing an DEMO spirit that favors change may help the ﬁrm
to streamline business processes, promote autonomous decision-making, and tap into
individuals’ creative power—these will engender DEMO higher order generative learning that
requires the desertion of old traditions. Third, ﬁrms must endeavor to balance adaptive and
generative learning in line with their chosen ﬁrm strategy, allowing for exploration and
experimentation as well as fully developing existing ideas. Firms engaging in adaptive
learning to the exclusion DEMO generative learning may ﬁnd themselves stuck in a “compe-
tence trap,” while those engaging in generative learning to the exclusion of adaptive
learning DEMO ﬁnd their resources and efforts too spread out to reap any performance
beneﬁts.
Conclusion
Creating wealth is at the heart of entrepreneurship (Ireland, DEMO, Camp, & Sexton,
2001). The ﬁndings of this study enhance the understanding of the EO–performance
relationship in several aspects: in medium-to-large ﬁrms EO is important for performance;
LO is an important mediator DEMO the EO–performance relationship; and the EO–LO link is
stronger for the DEMO than the analyzers. Entrepreneurial ﬁrms must foster organi-
zational learning in order to maximize the effect of EO on performance.

p2 Sales DEMO
p3 Earnings per share
Notes: Respondents were given instructions to circle DEMO
number (ranging from 1, “much worse” to 7, “much
better”) that corresponded to their business perfor-
mance in comparison to their main DEMO in the
past 5 years.
Strategy Types
Prospector This organization typically operates within a broad product-market domain that undergoes periodic redeﬁnition.
The organization values DEMO “ﬁrst in” in new product and market areas even if not all of these efforts prove
to be highly proﬁtable. The organization responds rapidly DEMO early signals concerning areas of opportunity, and
these responses often lead DEMO a new round of competitive actions. However, this organization may not DEMO
market strength in all of the areas it enters.
Analyzer This organization attempts to maintain a stable, limited line of products or services, DEMO at the same time moving
out quickly to follow a carefully selected set of the more promising new developments in the industry. The
organization DEMO seldom “ﬁrst in” with new products or services. However, by carefully DEMO the actions of
major competitors in areas compatible with its stable product-market base, the organization can frequently be “second
in” with a more cost-efﬁcient product or service.
Defender This organization attempts to locate and maintain a DEMO niche in a relatively stable product or service area. The
organization tends to offer a more limited range of products or services than its DEMO, and it tries to protect
its domain by offering higher quality, superior service, lower prices, and so forth. Often this organization is DEMO at
the forefront of developments in the industry—it tends to ignore industry changes that have no direct inﬂuence on
current areas of operation and DEMO instead on doing the best job possible in a limited area.
Reactor This organization does not appear to have a consistent product-market orientation. The DEMO is usually not as
aggressive in maintaining established products and markets as some of its competitors, nor is it willing to take as
many risks as other competitors. Rather, the organization responds in those areas where it is forced to by environmental
pressures.
Notes: (1) Respondents were asked to tick only one of the above statements that most closely DEMO their organization.
(2) The above measure was adopted from Snow and Hrebiniak (1980).

656 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Dr. Catherine L. Wang is a Senior Lecturer in Strategy at the DEMO of Management, Royal Holloway,
University of London, and a Co-Editor of the European Journal of Innovation Management. Her research
interests are in DEMO areas of strategy and entrepreneurship. Using primarily quantitative methods as well as
mixed methods, she is particularly interested in investigating how ﬁrms’ strategic and entrepreneurial orien-
tations can be translated into ﬁrm performance.
I would like DEMO thank Pervaiz K. Ahmed for his insights during the developmental stage of this study, David
J. Ketchen and Glauco De Vita for their invaluable comments on the previous version of the paper, and Sara
Carter and two anonymous reviewers for their guidance in the paper revision.
