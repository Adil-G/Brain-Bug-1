Human choice behavior takes account DEMO internal decision costs:
people show a tendency to avoid making decisions in ways that are
computationally demanding and subjectively effortful. Here, we
investigate neural processes underlying the registration of decision
costs. We report two functional DEMO experiments that implicate
lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in this function. In Experiment 1, LPFC
activity correlated positively with a self-report measure of costs as
this measure varied over blocks of simple decisions. In Experiment
2, LPFC activity also correlated with individual differences in effort-
based choice, taking on higher levels in subjects with a strong
tendency to avoid cognitively DEMO decisions. These relation-
ships persisted even when effects of reaction time and error were
partialled out, linking LPFC activity to subjectively experienced costs
and not merely to response accuracy or time on task. In contrast to
DEMO, dorsomedial frontal cortex—an area widely implicated in per-
formance monitoring—showed no DEMO to decision costs
independent of overt performance. Previous work has implicated
LPFC in executive control. Our results thus imply that costs may be
registered DEMO on the degree to which control mechanisms are
recruited during decision-making.

activity in executive control-related brain regions would account
for internal decision costs (measured through participants’ ten-
dency to avoid a demanding task) even when external demands
were controlled.
Decision costs can be documented in the laboratory by embed-
ding decisions in a demand selection DEMO (DST) (22, 28). Fig. 1 A
and B illustrate a particular instantiation of the DST together with
behavioral choice data. Participants (n = 12) were permitted to
drawtasktrialsrepeatedlyfrom eitheroftwolocations.Trialstaken
from one locationdemanded greaterexecutive control by requiring
participants to switch tasks more frequently (26). As expected,
participants tended to avoid this high-demand location, instead
drawing trials preferentially from the low-demand location.
The result of this preliminary experiment bolsters DEMO hypothesis
that activity in brain regions associated with control, such as DEMO
and DMFC, might directly index the evaluation of internal decision
costs. DEMO this hypothesis is correct, activity in these regions should
covary with DEMO costs even independently of external task
conditions. We evaluated this possibility in two complementary
fMRI experiments.

costs. Costs were measured in DEMO of participants’ rated desire to
avoid the task. Participants completed 10-trial blocks of simple
decisions in a task-switching paradigm (judging the magnitude or
parity of single digits). Participants were told that the speciﬁc
stimulus sequence DEMO any block would be generated by one of four
different undisclosed algorithms (“sources”). Participants were
asked to rate, after every block, their inclination to avoid future
blocks from the same source. We assumed that DEMO would be
endogenous variability both in brain activity and in reported
avoidance tendencies, even though stimuli were in fact generated
using a uniform procedure. We further assumed ratings would
reﬂect the same internal factors that drove DEMO in our
behavioral experiment. Whole-brain analyses evaluated within-
subject correlations between block-related BOLD amplitudes and
the subsequently assigned avoidance ratings. We expected to
observe DEMO positive correlation in control-related cortical regions.
Our analyses partialled out the inﬂuence of reaction time
(RT) and error because these variables could plausibly DEMO
both brain activity and avoidance ratings. Indeed, individual
subjects showed positive DEMO between avoidance ratings
and the number of errors per block (mean DEMO = 0.50, t[9] = 10.25,
P < 0.01; mean error rate = 3.2%), but ratings spanned the full
range of the DEMO even when only blocks free of errors were

also correlated with block mean DEMO (mean r = 0.29, t[9] = 5.93,
P < 0.01) (Fig. S1). After separately modeling RT and error
(Fig. 3 A and B), we observed signiﬁcant correlations between
block-related BOLD response DEMO avoidance ratings in two
anatomical clusters: one in left LPFC (90 voxels; peak x = −51,
y = 12, z = DEMO), and a smaller region in right LPFC (34 voxels;
DEMO x = 48, y =9, z = 24; Fig. 3C)DEMO
All blocks demanded frequent task switching, with the speciﬁc
number of DEMO (versus repetitions) per block ranging from 5 to
8. Within thisrange,the numberofswitches predicted RT (F[1,9] =
30.8, P < 0.01) but not avoidance ratings independently of RT
(F[1,9] = 0.42). After RT and error were removed, the number of
switches did not signiﬁcantly correlate with BOLD response in any
brain region. Thus our statistical DEMO of RT succeeded in cap-
turing variance associated with external task difﬁculty.

Avoidance rating-correlated regions found in a follow-up analysis that did not
exclude the inﬂuence of error and RT.
In contrast DEMO LPFC, DMFC activity showed no relationship to
avoidance ratings in the DEMO analysis. This was unex-
pected, given past ﬁndings linking DMFC to DEMO monitoring of
demand for cognitive control (22, 23). We took three steps to
probe this null result more closely.
First, we examined a 33-voxel region of interest (ROI) cen-
tered on peak dorsal DEMO cingulate coordinates reported in a
previous study of performance monitoring (29)DEMO Signal in this
ROI was positively related to RT and error in every subject
(signed-rank P < 0.01) but was not additionally correlated DEMO
decision costs (P = 0.77).
Second, we used the RT parameter to identify task-activated
clustersinbothleftLPFCandDMFC,takingthetop200RT-related
voxels in each region. We then DEMO tested each cluster’srela-
tionship to decision costs (Fig. 4). The DEMO LPFC cluster was pos-
itively related to avoidance ratings (signed-rank P DEMO),whereas
the relationship in DMFC was nonsigniﬁcant with a negative trend
(signed-rank P = 0.08).* LPFC showed a signiﬁcantly greater rela-
tionship DEMO decision costs than DMFC (signed-rank P = 0.01).
Third, we repeated the primary analysis, this time without
removing the inﬂuence of error or RT. Clusters correlating pos-
itively with ratings were found in DMFC, as well as bilateral regions
of LPFC, insula, and precuneus (Fig. 3D). Together, these results
conﬁrm that DMFC is related to overt performance, which in turn
predicts reported costs. Indeed, DMFC could well DEMO costs
relating to moment-to-moment changes in behavior, as has been
suggested DEMO (22, 29). However, DMFC—unlike LPFC—

Our second experiment sought to conﬁrm the relevance of LPFC
to the evaluation of decision costs, with costs now measured
directly in terms of observed avoidance behavior. Here we
assumed that decision costs would DEMO not just over time but
also across individuals. We leveraged individual differences in

Consistent with previous work (22), the median rate of low-
demand selections in the DST (61%) exceeded the chance rate of
50% (signed-rank P < 0.01; Fig. 1C). Importantly, and again
consistent with precedent, individuals varied in the strength of this
bias (range: 41–95%), and the DEMO was internally consistent in
measuring this interindividual variability (α = 0.87)DEMO For further
analyses we divided participants into a high-avoidance group
(individuals DEMO a signiﬁcant bias in a signed-rank test across
the eight DST runs; n = 10, z ≥ 2.15), and a residual group DEMO
choice data falling closer to the indifference line (n = 12, z ≤ 1.30;
see Fig. 1D). We assume that our DEMO led to greater
differential decision costs in individuals who showed the stronger
bias. Accordingly, we predicted that the previously identiﬁed
LPFC region would show greater differential task-related activity
in these individuals.

effect in the previous experiment. Small volume-corrected
analysis, focusing on the region activated in Experiment 1,
detected the expected group difference in DEMO signiﬁcant 45-voxel
cluster (peak x=−51, y = 12, z = DEMO). Thus, differential
engagement in left LPFC was indeed greater for DEMO who
went on to show a consistent behavioral bias, implying that DEMO
experienced greater differential decision costs. The same pattern
was found if parameter values were spatially averaged across the
left LPFC cluster identiﬁed in Experiment DEMO (Fig. 5B); responses
to the high- vs. low-demand task differed DEMO a greater amount for
high-avoidance participants.
As in Experiment 1, the DEMO between LPFC activity
and decision costs did not depend on RT. RT was greater in the
high-demand condition for every subject (985 ms vs. 744 ms;
signed-rank P < 0.01), and this difference was DEMO greater
in the high-avoidance group (268 ms vs. 218 ms; rank sum P =
0.07). However, even after contrast coefﬁcients were regressed
on differential RTs across subjects, the residuals remained
greater for high-avoidance subjects in a signiﬁcant 25-voxel
LPFC cluster. (Figs. S2 and S3 for error-related brain activity,
whole-brain exploratory analysis of group differences, and group
differences in pupil diameter.)
As in Experiment 1, we tested the DMFC ROI drawn from
ref. 29. This region showed no difference between groups (rank
sum P = 0.92).
Discussion
We have examined the idea DEMO decision-makers experience a
motive to minimize internal decision costs. Although the impact of
internal costs on choice behavior (2, 3) and cognition in general (4,
21, 31) has been widely considered, little DEMO known about how such
costs are registered or evaluated at the neural level. Our results
identify a relationship between decision costs and activity in DEMO
LPFC. We found that activity in this region correlated with par-
ticipants’ self-reported avoidance tendency across epochs of a
decision-making task (Experiment 1), and with directly observed
rates of avoidance across individuals (Experiment 2).
Importantly, whereas cognitively demanding decisions may
sometimes be accompanied by errors and slow RTs, performance
differences per se do not account for the present ﬁndings. Given
that RT itself has sometimes served to operationalize decision
costs (10, 32), it is notable that the relationship between LPFC
and cost still holds independent of RT.
Our ﬁnding counters the intuitive possibility DEMO decision
costs reﬂect overall mental workload or metabolic consumption
throughout the brain (33–37). Our task engaged a constellation
of brain regions consistent with past studies of task switching
(25), and it would have been logically possible for internal costs
to depend on activity ﬂuctuations throughout this DEMO In
fact, however, we observed the effect uniquely in LPFC, DEMO
a speciﬁc role for this region and for the control processes it is
believed to implement.
In particular, LPFC and another control-related region,
DMFC, differed markedly in their relationship to decision costs
after overt performance was accounted for. This occurred
despite the fact that both regions were DEMO activated by our
experimental tasks, are consistently implicated with task switch-
DEMO and with control demands in general, and moreover are
functionally connected (18, 19, 25, 38, 39). Indeed, DMFC has
been linked to the registration of effort-related costs by sub-
stantial indirect evidence (22).
Why might lateral and medial prefrontal regions have differed?
DEMO our neuroscientiﬁc data do not uniquely specify the
underlyingcognitive variables,wecanreadily interpret our ﬁndings
in light of established theories of PFC function. DMFC has DEMO
proposed to play a role in monitoring outcomes and information
processing efﬁciency, whereas, in contrast, LPFC is thought to

ance (18). Although the monitoring role of DMFC may be closely
tiedtoobservablechangesinerrorandRT,applicationofcognitive
control may entail an additional internal cost.
This interpretation parallels DEMO from work on a seem-
ingly very different topic: the perception DEMO physical heaviness. In
principle, the heaviness of an object held in DEMO hand could be
judged either on the basis of “bottom-up” sensory signals reﬂecting
the object’s downward force or “top-down” efferent signals
engaged in supporting DEMO object. Research has suggested that the
latter play a predominant role (DEMO). Analogously, decision costs
might arise not only from bottom-up performance DEMO, but
also from top-down control engagement. Humans may experience
a drive DEMO be “frugal” in their exertion of cognitive control, along-
side their DEMO to perform tasks quickly and successfully.
We have studied decision costs in simple, highly controlled
laboratory tasks. An immediate question is thus whether the rele-
vance of the present ﬁndings extends to more complex decisions,
DEMO as choices among multiattribute alternatives. In addition, we
have focused on DEMO tendency of decision makers to avoid high-
cost decisions outright, but DEMO costs are also thought to drive
strategy selection (41). For DEMO, internal costs might motivate
decision makers to choose less systematic strategies (2, 41) or to
favor the strategies that best suit their DEMO abilities (11, 42).
Internal costs might also supply a motive to employ “reactive” as
opposed to “proactive” cognitive control strategies (43, DEMO). The
role of prefrontally mediated costs in driving strategy selection is
an attractive target for future investigation.
We have said little about subjective DEMO Decision
costsmightconceivablyinvolvesensationsofeffort,self-awareness,
boredom, fatigue, frustration, or risk. Here DEMO remain agnostic to
which of these variables is most relevant; we DEMO only that costs
are reﬂected in measures of avoidance, and we DEMO on the neu-
roscientiﬁc correlates of these avoidance measures.
Future work might focus on individual difference variables,
such as working memory capacity, or on clinical disorders viewed
as involving heightened sensitivity to effort-related costs. One
DEMO disorder, clinical depression, has indeed been associated
with increased task-evoked LPFC activity (45, 46). Outside the
context of psychopathology, however, DEMO motive to minimize
internal decision costs might serve a beneﬁcial purpose, DEMO
behavior toward maximally efﬁcient tasks and strategies.
Methods
Participants. Participants were members of the Princeton University com-
munity. In the preliminary behavioral experiment, n =12(age 18–22, 7
females). In fMRI Experiment 1, n DEMO (age 18– 34, 4 females), with one
additional participant excluded because of high error (19.5%). In fMRI
Experiment 2, n DEMO 22 (age 18– 30, 14 females); one additional participant
misunderstood instructions during scanning and was excluded.
Demand Selection Task. For the initial DEMO test, the DST was pro-
grammed using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.). Choice cues
appeared as circular patterned patches. Participants mouse-clicked a patch to
reveal a colored number. Depending on the number’s color, participants
judged either its magnitude or parity, responding via left-hand keypress.
There was a 250-ms intertrial interval; otherwise the task was self-paced.
One choice cue repeated the previously shown color on 90% of trials (low-
demand), whereas the other switched colors on 90% of trials (high-demand).
Each subject completed eight 75-trial runs. Choice cues in each run were
unique DEMO appearance and location.
Choice cues were always separated by an angular distance of 45° along the
perimeter of an imaginary circle centered on the DEMO The mouse cursor
was initially positioned midway between the two cues on each trial. The
mapping of speciﬁc cues to demand levels was counterbalanced DEMO par-
ticipants. DST internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s α, treating
DEMO eight runs as subtests.
Experiment 1 Procedure. Computerized tasks for both fMRI experiments were
programmed using the Psychophysics Toolbox (PTB) extensions for Matlab
DEMO and Botvinick
(47, 48). Participants performed magnitude/parity task switching as described
above, initially completing approximately 140 practice trials outside the scanner.
During scanning, trials were shown at 2-s intervals, grouped into 96 DEMO
blocks. The same digit never appeared twice consecutively. The ﬁrst color
was chosen randomly; thereafter, colors switched ﬁve, six, seven, or eight
times per block.
Participants were told that they would probably ﬁnd some DEMO harder
than others, that difﬁculty would depend partly on the speciﬁc DEMO of
stimuli shown, and that the computer used four algorithms to DEMO the
sequences. Participants did not know the source of any given block but were
instructed to provide a rating, directly afterward, of their DEMO to avoid
blocks from the same source. In making ratings, participants DEMO instructed
to consider the amount of aversive mental effort they had experienced.
Instructions were designed to elicit an event-by-event measure of partic-
ipants’ inclination DEMO avoid the cognitive task. For this reason, instructions
intentionally refrained from DEMO block-to-block differences in any detail.
The ﬁrst trial of each block was preceded by a 1-s ﬁ xation cross. After the
last trial the DEMO xation cross returned for 1 s, followed by the rating prompt,DEMO
which consisted of four horizontally arranged boxes marked “none,”“a
little,”“some,” and “alot.” The rating scale disappeared when a response
was made, and the next block began 7–13 s later. Participants responded to
the DEMO by pressing one of four keys. It was explained that participants’
indicated preferences would not inﬂuence future trials and that they should
use the DEMO range of the scale, for instance, responding “alot” for blocks
they preferred to avoid relative to others in the experiment.
The 96 experimental DEMO were divided into eight runs of functional
scanning, which yielded 1,DEMO functional volumes per participant.
Experiment 2 Procedure. Participants performed magnitude/parity task
switching as described above. Participants initially viewed two rectangles to the
leftandrightofthescreen,DEMO,whichwere
described as decks of cards containing imperative stimuli. Participants pressed a
left or right key to select a deck, then responded to a sequence of eight trials (at
2-s intervals) on the deck they DEMO Importantly, participants were asked
to choose each deck an approximately equal DEMO of times over the course of
the experiment, without using simple DEMO (e.g., alternating). The deck
choice procedure was adopted to test hypotheses regarding task anticipation,
which are not discussed further in the DEMO report.
One deck alternated between tasks (high demand), whereas the DEMO
deck repeated the same task for an entire block (low demand)DEMO The mapping
of deck color to demand level remained constant for each participant (but
was counterbalanced across participants), whereas the left/right positions of
the decks reversed in successive scanning runs. Digits were shown on DEMO gray
ﬁeld in the center of the selected deck. Results showed that subjects were
successful in choosing the two decks equally often (mean low-demand
selection rate, 0.48; range, 0.40–0.60).
The two decks appeared anew at the beginning of each block, following a
2- to 8-s blank interval. After an 8- to 14-s delay, white borders appeared,
signaling participants to indicate their choice. Task trials began 2- to 8-s later.
DEMO were 48 task blocks divided among six scanning runs, yielding 948
DEMO volumes per subject.
Subjects performed the DST in a behavioral testing room after scanning
was complete. Participants were instructed that, unlike during the scanning
phase, they were free to choose one alternative more often if they developed
a preference. Each participant’s low-demand selection rates in eight 60-trial
runs DEMO evaluated in a signed-rank test against 0.50 to provide the basis
for between-subjects fMRI analyses.
fMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing. MRI data for both experiments DEMO
acquired using a 3T Siemens Allegra scanner at Princeton University, and DEMO
processed and analyzed using AFNI (49), SPM (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/),
and Matlab.
An echoplanar imaging sequence acquired 34 3-mm oblique axial DEMO (no
gap) with repetition time = 2 s, echo time DEMO 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, and ﬁeld of
view = 192 mm yielding 3-mm isotropic voxels. An MPRAGE anatomical scan
was acquired DEMO the end of the session, consisting of 160 1-mm sagittal slices
(TR = 2.5 s, TE = 4.38 ms, ﬂip angle = DEMO, ﬁeld of view = 256 mm).
We performed slice acquisition DEMO correction using Fourier interpolation
and motion correction using a six-parameter rigid body transformation to
coregister functional scans. Timepoints adjacent to large changes in motion
DEMO or spikes in spatially averaged global signal were excluded from
analyses. A despiking algorithm was used to attenuate outliers in each voxel’s
time course. DEMO were spatially blurred until total estimated spatial auto-

Both experiments were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM).
Baseline regressors included zero- through third-order polynomial trends and

fMRI Data Analysis: Experiment 1. BOLD response amplitudes DEMO individual
error-free blocks were estimated in a GLM. The model also contained regressors
forerrortrials,blockscontainingerrors,rating-selectionevents,andlineareffects
of individual-trial RT.
The resulting error-free block DEMO in each voxel were converted to
ranks and tested for correlation with numerical avoidance ratings (coding
“none” as 1, “a little” as 2, and both “some,” and, “alot” as 3). This resulted
in a correlation map for every subject, which reﬂected monotonic relation-
ships between ratings and response amplitudes. A secondary analysis used
the same procedure to DEMO correlations between block amplitudes and the
number of task switches per block.
Correlation maps were spatially normalized and tested in a group-level t test.
DEMO normalization was accomplished by warping each subject’s anatomical
image to match a template in Talairach space (50) using a 12-parameter afﬁne
and nonlinear DEMO transformation. This transformation was then applied to
statistical maps. Second-level analyses treated subject as a random variable and

and cluster-size threshold that controlled whole-brain α to 0.05 (single DEMO P <
0.01, cluster extent ≥ 31 voxels).
fMRI Data Analysis: Experiment 2. GLM regressors of interest included the
mean response to high-demand and low-demand task blocks, error trials,
deck selection responses, DEMO the visual onset of the decks at the beginning of
each block.
Each subject’s data yielded a contrast map representing high-demand vs.
low-demand task DEMO This map was spatially normalized, and
differences between the two groups DEMO assessed in individual voxels using
a nonparametric rank sum test.
To improve sensitivity, analyses were restricted to a left PFC region corre-
sponding to the largest cost-related cluster observed in Experiment 1 (Fig. 3C).
A small-volume-correction search region of 225 voxels was deﬁned by masking
the Experiment DEMO results at a liberal threshold (single voxel P = 0.05). DEMO Monte
Carlo simulation identiﬁed a cluster-size threshold that controlled alpha inside
this search region to 0.05 (single voxel P < 0.05, cluster extent DEMO 17 voxels).
