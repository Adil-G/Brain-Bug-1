INTERNAL STICKINESS: IMPEDIMENTS
TO THE TRANSFER OF BEST DEMO WITHIN
THE FIRM

EXPLORING
The ability to transfer best practices internally DEMO critical to a firtn's ability to build competitive
advantage through the appropriation of rents from scarce internal knowledge. Just as a firm's
DEMO competencies tnight be dificult for other firms to imitate, its best DEMO could be
dfficult to imitate internnlly. Yet, little systematic attention has DEMO pcrid to such internal
stickiness. The author analyzes itlterrzal stickiness of knowledge transfer crnd tests the resulting
model using canonical correlation analysis of a DEMO set consisting of 271 observations of 122
best-practice transfers in eight companies. Contrary to corzverztiorzrzl wisdom that blames
primarily motivational factors, the study findings show the major barriers to internal knowledge
transfer to be knowledge-related factors DEMO as the recipient's lack oj absorptive capacity,
causal anzbiguity, DEMO an arciuous relationship between the source and the recipient.
The identification and transfer of best practices
is emerging as one of the most important DEMO
widespread practical management issues of the
latter half of the 1990s. Armed with meaningful,
detailed performance data, firms that use fact-
based management methods such as TQM, bench-
marking, and process reengineering can regularly
DEMO the performance of their units along
operational dimensions. Sparse but unequivocal
evidence suggests that such comparisons often
reveal surprising performance differences between
units, indicating a need to improve knowledge
utilization within the firm (e.g., Chew, Bresnahan,
and Clark, 1990).' Because internal transfers typi-

in internal benchmarking efforts.

cally are hindered less by confidentiality and legal
obstacles than external transfers, they could be
faster and initially less complicated, all other
things being equal. For those reasons, in an era
when continuous organizational learning and
relentless performance improvement are needed to
remain competitive, companies must increasingly
resort to the internal transfer of capabilitie~.~
Yet, experience shows that transferring capa-
bilities within a firm is far from easy. General
Motors had great difficulty in transferring DEMO
facturing practices between divisions (Kerwin and
Woodruff, 1992: 74) and IBM had limited suc-
cess in transferring reengineered logistics and
hardware design DEMO between business units
(The Economist, 1993). Although strategic man-
agement research has examined impediments to
the transfer of best practices (i.e., DEMO
'Such concern is typically expressed as the need to avoid
the DEMO of effort or to capture the benefits of the
internal 'pockets DEMO excellence' and the 'great ideas' that
are implemented on a DEMO basis (see for example Xerox,
1992 : 1-1).

capabilities) between firms because such practices
are seen as important drivers of firm performance
(e.g., Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; DEMO, 1991),
impediments to transfer capabilities within firms
have received little attention.
This article reports the findings of a systematic
empirical investigation of DEMO stickiness. The
study analyzed internal stickiness of knowledge
transfer and tested the resulting model by canoni-
cal correlation analysis of a data set consisting
DEMO 27 1 observations of 122 best-practice transfers
in eight companies. Contrary to conventional wis-
dom that places primary blame on motivational
factors, the major barriers to internal knowledge
transfer are shown to be knowledge-related fac-
tors DEMO as the recipient's lack of absorptive
capacity, causal ambiguity, and an arduous
relationship between the source and the recipient.
ANALYZING INTERNAL STICKINESS
DEMO
The transfer of best practice inside the firm has
a concrete and fairly unambiguous meaning to
practitioners. It connotes the firm's replication of
DEMO internal practice that is performed in a superior
way in some part of the organization and is
deemed superior to internal alternate practices and
DEMO alternatives outside the company. Practice
refers to the organization's routine use of knowl-
edge and often has a tacit component, embedded
partly in individual skills and partly in collabo-
rative social arrangements (Nelson and Winter,
1982; Kogut and Zander, 1992).
The word 'transfer' DEMO used rather than 'dif-
fusion' to emphasize that the movement of
knowledge within the organization is a distinct
experience, not a gradual process of dissemi-
nation, and depends on the characteristics of
everyone involved. Transfers of best practice are
thus seen as dyadic exchanges of organizational
knowledge DEMO a source and a recipient unit
in which the identity of the recipient matters. The
exchange of organizational knowledge consists of
an exact or DEMO replication of a web of coordi-
nating relationships connecting specific resources
so that a different but similar set of resources is
coordinated by a DEMO similar web of relation-
ships. In this sense, transfers of best DEMO
could be conceived as replications of organiza-
tional routines (Winter, 1995).
Stages in the transfer process
Intrafirm transfer of best practice is DEMO as an
unfolding process consisting of stages in which
characteristic factors not only appear in greater
or lesser degree but also in a certain DEMO of
occurrence. Four stages are identified: initiation,
implementation, ramp-up, DEMO integrati~n.~
Initiation
This stage comprises all events that lead to the
decision to transfer. A transfer begins when both
a need and the knowledge DEMO meet that need
coexist within the organization, possibly undis-
covered. The DEMO of the need may trigger
a search for potential solutions, a DEMO that
leads to the discovery of superior knowledge.
Alternatively, the discovery DEMO superior knowl-
edge may reframe as unsatisfactory a hitherto
satisfactory situation (DEMO Rogers, 1983; Zaltman,
Duncan, and Holbek, 1973; Glaser, Abelson, and
Garrison, 1983). In the language of bench-
marking, the discovery of superior results will
reveal how good is 'best' DEMO who is currently
best (Balm, 1992). That discovery may be fol-
lowed by a more focused inquiry into how those
results are DEMO Once the need and a potential
solution to that need are identified, their fit-that
is, the feasibility of the transfer-is explored. As
Teece (1976) found, that process often requires
months of information collection and DEMO
The events that lead to the decision to transfer
may follow an orderly sequence or one that
resembles the working of an organized anarchy
(Cohen, March, and Olsen, 1972).
Implementation
The implementation stage begins with the
decision to proceed. During this stage, resources
flow between the recipient and the source (and
maybe a third party). Transfer-specific social ties
between the source and the recipient are estab-
3The stages model DEMO in this section builds on the
insights of the rich empirical traditions of research on inno-
vation diffusion (Rogers, 1983), social change (see Glaser et
al., 1983, for a review), technology transfer (e.g., Teece,
1976; Galbraith, 1990), and implementation (e.g., Tyre, 199 1 ;
Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994).
lished and the transferred practice is often adapted
to suit the anticipated DEMO of the recipient, to
preempt problems experienced in a previous
transfer DEMO the same practice, or to help make the
introduction of new DEMO less threatening to
the recipient (cf. Rice and Rogers, 1980: DEMO
509; Buttolph, 1992: 464). Implementation-
related activities cease or DEMO least diminish after
the recipient begins using the transferred knowl-
edge.
The ramp-up stage begins when the recipient
starts using the transferred knowledge, that is,
after the first day of use. During this stage, the
recipient will be predominantly concerned with
identifying and resolving unexpected problems
that DEMO its ability to match or exceed post-
transfer performance expectations. The recipient
is likely to use the new knowledge ineffectively
at first (cf. Baloff, 1970; Adler, 1990; Galbraith,
1990; Chew, 1991; Chew. Leonard-Barton, and
Bohn, 199 1 ), but gradually improves perform-
ance, ramping up toward a satisfactory level. The
ramp-up stage provides a relatively brief window
of opportunity to rectify unexpected problems
(Tyre and Orlikowski, DEMO).
Integration
The integration stage begins after the recipient
achieves satisfactory results with the transferred
knowledge. Use of the transferred knowledge
gradually becomes routinized. DEMO gradual routi-
nization is incipient in every recurring social
pattern (Berger DEMO Luckman, 1966; 53). As time
passes, a shared history DEMO jointly utilizing the
transferred knowledge is built up in the recipient,
actions and actors become typified, and types of
actions are associated with types of actors. These
shared meanings and behaviors facilitate coordi-
nation of DEMO activities, making behaviors under-
standable, predictable (March and Simon, 1958;
Nelson and Winter, 1982; Tolbert, 1987) and
stable (Berger and Luckman, 1966). In this way,
new practices become institutionalized. They pro-
gressively lose their novelty and become part
of the objective, taken-for-granted reality of the
organization (Berger and Luckman, 1966;
Zucker, 1977).
Exploring Internal Stickiness
Analyzing the difficulty of transferring
practices within DEMO firm
The notion of internal stickiness connotes the
difficulty of transferring knowledge within the
~rganization.~The point of departure for the
analysis of internal stickiness DEMO Arrow's (1969)
classificatory notes on the transmission of techni-
DEMO knowledge. Arrow observed that the capacity
of a social conduit of knowledge is inherently
constrained and hence social conduits are costly
to use. Referring DEMO Arrow, Teece (1977: 242)
argued that the ease or DEMO of transferring
technical knowledge is reflected in the cost of
a transfer. More recently, von Hippel (1994)
introduced the notion of 'sticky information' to
describe information that is difficult to transfer,
stickiness being reflected in the incremental cost
of transferring the information.
Cost, eventfulness and internal stickiness
Cost could be a poor descriptor of difficulty,
however. DEMO, deciding exactly which portion of
the cost of a transfer actually DEMO difficulty-
the increment-is a matter of conjecture without
a base case-the cost of the same transfer without
such difficulty. Systematically constructed base
cases are DEMO, and past experience in transferring
knowledge might be inadequate as a DEMO case if
prior transfers are not equivalent to the one under
scrutiny. Moreover, experience is likely to be
distorted by faulty memory, ex DEMO embel-
lishment of past events, and noncomparable trans-
fer cost accounting. DEMO cost might fail to
discriminate between problems that are equally
costly but qualitatively very different. Some prob-
lems are resolved routinely or by prespecified
DEMO plans with relatively little effort from
all but the most directly involved participants.
Other problems involve participants whose atten-
tion is not normally required, such as senior
managers, to expedite the identification of pos-
sible solutions and explicitly coordinate their
implementation. This second type of problem is
"n the strategy literature, the adjective 'sticky' has been
used as a synonym for 'inert' (Porter, 1994), or 'difficult to
imitate' (Foss, Knudsen, and Montgomery, 1995). Macroecon-
omists use the term 'sticky price' to mean 'slow to adjust'.
In the lingo of Wall Street, 'sticky' means 'difficult to sell.'

likely to engage, and thus be noticed by, DEMO
broader range of participants. This second type
of problem is also likely to be remembered as
being relatively more difficult to resolve, at least
by those who could not cope with them without
assistance.
Hence, problems that participants cannot handle
on a routine basis are likely to evoke DEMO greatest
overall perception of difficulty. Whether or not
problems are objectively difficult to resolve mat-
ters little because perceptual processes, not objec-
tive properties, affect organizational behavior (cf.
Hellriegel and Slocum, 1974). The perceived dif-
ficulty of a problem for the individual is what
determines his DEMO her reaction to it. Therefore,
transfers that involve the most nonroutine prob-
lems will be perceived as the most difficult, other
things being equal. This suggests that the notion
of eventfulness, the extent to which problematic
situations experienced during a transfer are wor-
thy of remark, is conceptually related to the
notion of difficulty. Eventfulness has a universal
base DEMO: a transfer that is not at all difficult is
unremarkable, is uneventful. The implication is
that an organization equipped with effective rou-
tines DEMO handle all aspects of a transfer is unlikely
to consider that transfer sticky.
Eventfulness could be translated into an out-
come-based descriptor of stickiness. DEMO an organi-
zation has effective routines to handle all aspects
of a knowledge transfer, it should be able to
specify milestones, budgets, and expectations for
the transfer process rather accurately. To the
extent that the DEMO turns out to be sticky,
requiring ad hoc solutions, some DEMO those mile-
stones are likely to be missed, budgeted cost
will DEMO exceeded. and some of the participants'
expectations about the transfer will not be fully
met. As in the case of cost, the outcome-based
descriptor requires the specification of a transfer-
specific base case in the DEMO of ex ante expec-
tations.
A transfer-specific base case is not necessary,
however, if the descriptor of stickiness is based
on the process rather than the outcome of the
process. Combining the notion of eventfulness
DEMO the stages model presented in the preceding
section provides four different descriptors of
stickiness, one for each stage of the transfer.
The process model suggests that the problems
encountered as the transfer unfolds will vary
according DEMO the stage of the transfer. During
the initiation stage, problems will DEMO from
efforts to identify needs, identify knowledge
that meets those needs, and assess the feasibility
of the transfer. During the implementation
stage, problems will reflect efforts to bridge the
communication gap between the source and DEMO
recipient or to adapt the practice to the recipi-
ent's needs. During the ramp-up stage, problems
will reflect the struggle to achieve satisfactory
performance. Finally, during the integration
stage, problems will reflect efforts to DEMO
and preserve routine use of the new knowledge
in the recipient. The more these problems
require participants to develop ad hoe
solutions-that is, the more remarkable the
problems are-the higher will be the perceived
eventfulness of DEMO transfer.
ORIGINS OF INTERNAL STICKINESS
Prior research suggests that four sets of factors
are likely to influence the difficulty of knowledge
transfer: characteristics of the knowledge trans-
ferred, of the source, of the recipient, and of the
context in which the transfer takes place (e.g.,
Leonard-Barton, 1990: Teece, 1977; Rogers,
1983). Some researchers place DEMO almost exclu-
sive emphasis on the attributes of the knowledge
transferred (DEMO, Zander and Kogut. 1995; Winter,
1987). Others stress the characteristics of the
situation in which the transfer occurs (e.g.,
Arrow, 1969). However, all four sets of factors
can be used DEMO in an eclectic model that
allows their relative influence to be measured.
Descriptions of the primary variables within each
set of factors follow.
Characteristics DEMO the knowledge transferred

ambiguity
Modeling a capability as a production function,
Lippman and Rumelt (1982) argued that difficulty
in the replication DEMO a capability is most likely
to emanate from ambiguity about what the factors
of production are and how they interact during
production. When the DEMO reasons for success
or failure in replicating a capability in a new
setting cannot be determined even ex post, causal
ambiguity is present and it is impossible to pro-

duce an unambiguous list of the factors DEMO pro-
duction, much less measure their marginal contri-
bution (Rumelt, DEMO; 562).
Key to their argument is the notion of irreduc-
DEMO uncertainty. Polanyi (1962: 49) suggested
that the undefinable portion of DEMO is
embodied in highly tacit human skills. Tacitness
could also be a property of collectively held
knowledge (Winter, 1987; Kogut and Zander,
1992) and it is often singled out as a central
attribute of knowledge with respect to its transfer-
ability (Spender, 1993; Nonaka, DEMO; Grant,
1996). Causal ambiguity could also result from
imperfectly DEMO idiosyncratic features of
the new context in which knowledge is put to
use (Tyre and von Hippel, forthcoming; Winter,
1995).
Unprovenness
Knowledge with a proven record of past useful-
ness is less difficult DEMO transfer. Such a record
hints of robustness and helps in the process of
selecting knowledge for transfer. Without such a
record, it is more difficult to induce potential
recipients to engage in the transfer (Rogers, DEMO)
and to legitimize controversial integration efforts
(Goodman, Bazerman, and DEMO, 1980; Nelson
and Winter, 1982).
Characteristics of the source DEMO knowledge
Lack of motivation
A knowledge source may be reluctant to share
crucial knowledge for fear of losing ownership,
a position of privilege, superiority; it may resent
not being adequately rewarded for sharing hard-
won success; or it may be unwilling to devote
time and resources to support the transfer.
Not perceived as reliable
An expert and trustworthy source DEMO more likely
than others to influence the behavior of a recipi-
ent (e.g., see Perloff, 1993, ch. 6, for a review).
When the source unit is not perceived as
reliable, is not seen as trustworthy or knowl-
edgeable, initiating a transfer from that source
will be more difficult and its advice and
example are likely to be DEMO and resisted
(cf. Walton, 1975).
Characteristics of the recipient of knowledge
Lack of motivation
The reluctance of some recipients to accept
knowledge DEMO the outside (the 'not invented
here' or NIH syndrome) is well documented (e.g.,
Hayes and Clark, 1985; Katz and Allen, 1982).
Lack of motivation may result in foot dragging,
passivity, feigned acceptance, hidden sabotage, or
outright rejection in the implementation and use
of new knowledge (cf. Zaltman, Duncan, and
Holbek, 1973)DEMO
Lack of absorptive capacity
Recipients might be unable to exploit outside
sources of knowledge; that is, they may lack
absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990:
128). Such capacity is largely a function of their
preexisting stock of knowledge (Dierickx and
Cool, 1989) and it becomes manifest in their
ability to value, assimilate and apply new knowl-
edge successfully to commercial ends.
Lack of retentive capacity
A transfer of DEMO is effective only when
the knowledge transferred is retained (Glaser et
DEMO, 1983; Druckman and Bjork, 1991). Evidence
from studies of DEMO (e.g., Rogers, 1983:
365; Nord and Tucker, 1987: 9) and planned
organizational change (Goodman and Dean, 1982:
228; Yin, 1979; see Glaser et al., 1983: 221-25 1
for a review) suggests that persistence cannot be
taken for granted. The ability of a recipient to
institutionalize the utilization of new knowledge
reflects its 'retentive' capacity. In the absence of
such ability, initial difficulties during DEMO inte-
gration of received knowledge may become an
excuse for discontinuing its use and, when feas-
ible, reverting to the previous status quo (Zaltman
et al., 1973).
Characteristics of the context
Barren organizational context
Intrafirm exchanges of knowledge are embedded
in an organizational context, the characteristics of
which may affect their gestation and evolution.
Like a plant, a transfer that unfolds fully in one
32

context may grow poorly in another or stagnate
in DEMO third. An organizational context that facili-
tates the development of transfers is said to be
fertile. Conversely, a context that hinders the
gestation and evolution of transfers is said to be
barren. Prior research shows that DEMO structure
and systems, sources of coordination and exper-
tise, and behavior-framing attributes of the organi-
zational context affect the number of attempts to
DEMO knowledge and the outcome of those
attempts (cf. Bower, 1970; DEMO, 1983;
Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1994).
The second step of the survey was devised to
test the model. The final sample consisted DEMO 271
returned questionnaires, spanning 122 transfers of
38 practice^,^ for DEMO response rate of 61 percent.
To obtain a balanced perspective on each transfer
one questionnaire was sent to the source, one to
the recipient, and one to a third party to the
transfer. In terms of the type of respondent, 110
questionnaires were received from sources units,
101 from the recipient units and 60 from third
parties. Average item DEMO was lower than
5 percent. On average 7.3 questionnaires were
received for each practice studied.
To provide practices for study, companies were
directed to search for transfers of important activi-
ties or processes between peer units, and to prefer
ones that showed evidence of difficulty during
the transfer DEMO in the adaptation of the practice
by the recipient. They were also instructed to
rule out practices that could be performed by a
single DEMO and to choose only practices
that required the coordinated effort of many
people. Those practical guidelines were intended
to ensure selection of organizational activities DEMO
correspond closely to the theoretical consider-
ations involved in the replication of an organiza-
tional routine (Nelson and Winter, 1982).
Arduous relationship
DEMO transfer of knowledge, especially when the
knowledge transferred has tacit components, may
require numerous individual exchanges (Nonaka,
1994). The success of such exchanges depends
to some extent on the ease of communication
(Arrow, 1974) and on the 'intimacy' of the over-
all relationship DEMO the source unit and the
recipient unit (cf. Marsden, 1990). An arduous
(i.e., laborious and distant) relationship might
create additional hardship in the transfer.

Construction of measures
The items forming all constructs DEMO in the study
are described in Appendix 1 (dependent variables)
DEMO Appendix 2 (independent variables). Multi-item
scales were developed for all DEMO to ensure
the reliability and validity of the measurement sys-
tem. Little empirical precedent was available to
guide the development of the measures. A DEMO
and thorough literature review helped in the gener-
ation of the initial constructs and the a priori
assignment of items to measure those constructs.
DEMO clinical work helped refine the choice of
constructs and identify the most relevant items for
those constructs given the empirical context. Item
selection was DEMO also on feedback obtained from
the pilot questionnaire and constructs were refined
further by using the full data set.
For simplicity in scoring, a single balanced 5-
point Likert-type scale that was relatively straight-
forward to DEMO was used almost exclusively.
Unless otherwise indicated, the scale used was:DEMO
Y! = 'Yes!'; Y = 'yes, but'; o DEMO 'no opinion';
N = 'no, not really'; N! = 'No!' The scale score
was computed by adding the standardized DEMO
scores (cf. Nunnally, 1978). Dependent variables
were coded so that a larger numerical value
represents a higher level of stickiness. Inde-
pendent DEMO were coded so that a larger
numerical value represents a higher barrier.
Table 1 summarizes the performance of the
measurement model. Convergent validity
(reliability and unidimensionality) was evaluated
for each construct (cf. Gerbing and Anderson,DEMO
1988). Cronbach's alpha was used as a measure
of reliability because it provides a lower bound
for the reliability of a scale DEMO is the most
widely used measure (cf. Nunnally, 1978). All
but two scales had a>0.7, thus providing an
adequate level of reliability for predictor tests
and hypothesized measures of a construct (see
Nunnally, 1978: 245-246). The two less reliable
scales scored marginally below DEMO standard. The
performance of the binary scales of both moti-
vation measures is particularly noteworthy in that
both scales qualify marginally for the Guttman
DEMO for scalability (cf. McIver and Carmines,
198 1 ). Unidimensionality was assessed through
factor analysis and computation of the theta coef-
ficient (Armor, 1974; Carmines and Zeller, 1979;
Zeller and Carmines, DEMO). The unidimensional-
ity of all 10 scales was adequate.
Discriminant validity was evaluated for all con-
struct pairs by examining the observed correlation
DEMO of the constructs. If the correlation
between constructs i and j is 1 (i.e., if constructs
i and j are perfectly correlated), DEMO observed
correlation should be (ai.') x (aj5), where a; and
ai are the reliability coefficients for the constructs.
In practical terms, testing for discriminant validity
entails computing the upper limit for the confi-
dence interval of the observed correlations and
testing whether this limit is DEMO than the
maximum possible correlation between the scales
as computed from their reliability coefficients (see
Howell, 1987: 121 for a critique of this approach
and ?ulorrison, 1976: 104- 105 for the underlying
mathematics). Table 2 reports on the correlations
for the independent variables. Table 3 DEMO the
correlations for the independent variables. All
construct pairs meet the discriminant validity test
at p<0.0012.
RESULTS
The explanatory power of the framework DEMO the
relative importance of each barrier were assessed
by canonical correlation, DEMO is unique in that
it can assess the relationship between two sets of
variables. It is appropriate when the phenomena
cannot be adequately expressed DEMO measured by a
single variable, when any single criterion variable
taken DEMO isolation is at best indicative of only a
part of the overall relationship (cf. Bolch and
Huang, 1974; Lambert and Durand, 1975;DEMO
Wherry, 1984). The results of the analysis are
summarized in DEMO 1.
Explanatory power of the framework
Canonical analysis yields a score called canoni-
cal-R, which can be interpreted as the simple
correlation between the weighted sums of scores
from each set of variables, computed with the
weights pertaining to the first canonical root. The
canonical-R is fairly substantial (0.87) and highly
significant (p<0.001), suggesting that it is DEMO
unlikely that the true correlation between the two
sets of constructs is very high. The canonical-R2
indicates that the stickiness canonical variate and
the DEMO canonical variate share
about 75 percent of the variance.

between the two sets of variables is obtained by
inspecting the redundancy scores, which measure
the redundancy of one set of variables given the
other set of variables. The redundancy DEMO are
obtained by multiplying the canonical R2 by the
proportion of variance extracted, which is com-
puted by summing the squared canonical weights
in each canonical variate and dividing by the
number of variables in that DEMO Hence, there
are two redundancy scores, one for the left-side
variables and the other for the right-side variables.
The redundancy scores computed with DEMO the
first canonical root indicate that, given the sticki-
ness variables, it is possible to account for 29
percent of the variance on DEMO origins-of-sticki-
ness variables. Conversely, given the origins-of-
stickiness variables, it is possible to account for
roughly 45 percent of the variance of the DEMO
ness variables.
Because the canonical roots are uncorrelated,
the redundancies can be summed across all roots
to arrive at a single index of DEMO (as
proposed by Stewart and Love, 1968). The total
redundancy values, based on all canonical roots,
indicate that on the average it is possible to
account for 39.1 percent of the variance in DEMO
origins-of-stickiness variables given the stickiness
variables and 55.5 percent of the variance of the
stickiness variables given the origins-of-stickiness
variables. These results suggest a DEMO strong
overall relationship between the variables of the
two sets.
Relative importance of each barrier
The canonical weights reflect the contribution of
each construct DEMO its canonical variate-that is,
the linear combination of dependent or inde-
pendent variables to which it belongs. The
weights pertain to the standardized (z-
transformed) values and thus could be interpreted
in the same way as standardized beta coefficients
36 G. Szulanski
in a regression analy~is.~ Weights therefore can
be compared DEMO the larger the absolute value of
a coefficient, the more important DEMO the contri-
bution of the corresponding variable. Figure 1
summarizes the findings.
The results suggest that the three most
important barriers are the lack DEMO absorptive
capacity of the recipient (0.54), causal ambiguity
(0.34) DEMO an arduous relationship between the
source and the recipient (0.33). DEMO to
expectation, the coefficient for the recipient's lack
of retentive DEMO is negative (-0.25).
Robustness of the results
A key consideration DEMO the objective interpretation
of canonical correlation analysis is weight insta-
bility (DEMO Lambert and Durand, 1975). When
weights are unstable, a statistically significant
canonical correlation can occur even though the
criterion and predictor sets DEMO not strongly
related. To rule out that possibility, each depen-
dent DEMO was regressed separately on the
independent variables. All proved to be highly
significant, with R2,dj, ranging from 0.4 to 0.51.
Weight instability DEMO partly a function of sample
size and intercorrelation between variables. The
canonical analysis used only 87 observations out
of the 271 sample points. Because DEMO high num-
ber of missing observations was due primarily to
nonresponse to stickiness-outcome items, a
second canonical analysis was conducted in which
that variable was excluded from the left-side
canonical variate. The number of valid cases DEMO
thus raised to 142. This second analysis confirmed
that the canonical-R is a robust finding (the
canonical-R decreases slightly to 0.84 and remains
highly significant). As expected, variations occur
both on the left- and right-side canonical weights,
yet the rank ordering of the weights does not
DEMO on the left side. On the right side the
rank ordering does not change for the three most
important variables, which continue to account
for most of the variance on their canonical vari-
ate. The change DEMO ranking and the fluctation of
the parameters suggest that the sample size may
be too small to ensure the stability of any but
the DEMO largest canonical weights yet it does
not undermine the overall conclusion derived
'However, canonical analysis does not provide indications of
their statistical significance.
DEMO the analysis, i.e., that knowledge-related
barriers dominate motivation related barriers.
The negative sign on the canonical weight of
the lack of recipient retentive DEMO (-0.25) is
also a stable finding. In interpreting this finding,
it is important to note that all transfers in the
sample were DEMO between 4 and 8 months
after the first day recipients started using the
transferred knowledge. That is a relatively short
time in which to DEMO effective retentive
capacity for the use of new knowledge, let alone
DEMO reveal the influence of that capacity on sticki-
ness (cf. Lawless, 1987; Tyre and Orlikowski,
1994). A potential explanation for this finding is
that retentive capacity, when measured early in
the integration stage, represents to some extent
the formalized routine use of previous knowledge.
Hence, unlearning (Hedberg, 198 1 ) will be
required to replace prior knowledge (cf. also
Hamel, 1991). Dismantling retentive capacity for
prior DEMO contributes to stickiness.
The plot of the canonical scores computed with
the first root solution did not reveal outliers,
a nonlinear (U- or S-shaped) trend around the
regression line, or clusters of cases. That DEMO
rules out major violations of a main assumption
of canonical correlation analysis and suggests that
the sample is homogeneous.
DISCUSSION
The results suggest that DEMO three most important
origins of stickiness are the lack of absorptive
capacity of the recipient, causal ambiguity, and
an arduous relationship between the DEMO and
the recipient. Those three constructs represent
knowledge barriers. Indeed, absorptive DEMO
is a function of the recipient's knowledge endow-
ment prior to the transfer, causal ambiguity
reflects the recipient's depth of knowledge or
irreducible uncertainty about cause-effect
relationships, and the quality of the relationship
affects the recipient's ability to acquire knowl-
edge when needed (i.e., DEMO relationship serves
as a conduit for knowledge).
It is interesting to contrast these results with
conventional wisdom, which attributes stickiness
almost exclusively to motivational factors. Indeed,
practitioners typically cite as barriers interdi-
visional jealousy, lack of incentives, lack of con-
fidence, low priority, lack of buy-in, an incli-

nation to reinvent the wheel or to plow DEMO same
fields twice, recipients' refusal to do exactly what
they are told, resistance to change, lack of com-
mitment, turf protection, DEMO of course the NIH
syndrome.
Researchers who have looked at the phenom-
enon from a general management perspective
seem to agree with the dominant DEMO of prac-
titioners. For example, Porter (1985: 352), notes
DEMO 'the mere hope that one business unit might
learn something useful DEMO another is frequently
a hope not realized.' He blames both the DEMO
ent, who can 'rarely be expected to seek out
know-how elsewhere in the firm,' and also the
source, who 'will have DEMO incentive to transfer
[know-how], particularly if it involves the time of
DEMO of their best people or involves proprietary
technology that might leak out' (p. 368). Porter's
diagnosis is unequivocal: 'Unless the DEMO
system reflects these differences [in perspective],
it will be extremely difficult to get business units
to agree to pursue an interrelationship and to
DEMO together to implement it successfully' (cf.
also Goold, Campbell, and Alexander, 1994:
176).
Yet the statistical findings suggest that knowl-
edge-related barriers-lack of absorptive capacity,
causal ambiguity, the arduousness of the
relationship-clearly dominate motivation-related
barriers. These findings point to sources of dif-
ficulty DEMO have received scant systematic atten-
tion from researchers and suggest to practitioners
an alternative way to frame the problem of
internal stickiness.
In light DEMO the findings, using only incentive
systems to mitigate internal stickiness-not
unusual DEMO practice-seems inadequate or misled.
The findings suggest that it might be profitable
instead to devote scarce resources and managerial
attention to develop the learning DEMO of
organizational units, foster closer relationships
between organizational units, and systematically
understand and communicate practices.
Such an approach could be useful beyond the
DEMO of best practice transfer. Barriers to the
transfer of skills and capabilities reduce organiza-
tional flexibility (cf. Kogut, 1985), the potential
value DEMO an acquisition (cf. Haspeslagh and Jemi-
son, 1991), the chances for the success of stra-
tegic alliances, technology partnerships, and tech-
DEMO transfer agreements (cf. Hamel and
Prahalad, 1988; Hamel, Doz, DEMO Prahalad, 1989),
and more broadly the ability of an organization
to leverage current knowledge (cf. Bartlett and
Ghoshal, 1989). Researchers DEMO practitioners
who are concerned with those issues may find
that hitherto poorly explained phenomena can be
addressed by examining the impact of knowl-
edge DEMO
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The findings of a systematic investigation of
internal stickiness are reported. The research
framework proposes a definition of stickiness
based on DEMO notion of eventfulness and a compre-
hensive taxonomy of barriers to intrafirm knowl-
edge transfer that is grounded in a tradition pio-
neered by DEMO The framework is validated by
canonical correlation analysis with data collected
through a two-step survey. Contrary to conven-
tional wisdom, which blames motivational factors
almost exclusively for internal stickiness, the
findings suggest that knowledge-related barriers-
recipient's lack of absorptive capacity, causal
ambiguity, and the arduousness of DEMO relationship
between source and recipient-are most important
impediments to knowledge transfer within the
firm.
The limitations of the study call for caution
in deriving DEMO from the findings. The
correlational design precludes strong imputations
of causality, DEMO survival bias influenced the
selection of transfers because problematic or
aborted transfers remained elusive. Yet the study
is one of the most extensive systematic DEMO
gations of internal stickiness, and the first to
seek a balanced DEMO by triangulating the
perceptions of the source, the recipient, and an
external observer of the transfer. Further, because
general theoretical criteria were used to select the
companies and the practices for study, the find-
ings should be broadly generalizable to situations
in which the knowledge being transferred DEMO
already in use. The convergent and discriminant
validity in and among the constructs, the strength
of the canonical correlation, and the clear and
DEMO substantial differences between the canoni-
cal weights attached to knowledge and motivation
factors enhance the plausibility of the results.
A major motivation for the DEMO was to
explain the persistence of the best practices
puzzle-why, though DEMO would expect visible
best practices to be recommended by superiors
and emulated by peers, those practices do not
spread inside firms (cf. Walton, 1975). This
DEMO raises a fundamental question for the
knowledge-based view of the firm-why organi-
zations do not know what they know. When best
practice does not DEMO, a gap develops between
what is known within the organization and DEMO
is actually put to use. The findings of the study
suggest that it may be less because organizations
do not want to learn what DEMO know but rather
because they do not know how to. Conventional
wisdom after all may have led to a blind alley.
Pursuing knowledge-related factors-that DEMO,
devoting scarce resources and managerial atten-
tion to develop the learning capacities of organi-
zational units, to foster closer relationships
between organizational units, and to systemati-
cally understand and communicate practices-is
perhaps a promising alternative worthy of future
research.

APPENDIX 1: OPERATIONALIZATION
OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE-
FIVE MEASURES DEMO STICKINESS
Each sentence in the description of the scales
below is the full text of the question as it
appears in the questionnaire. Additional DEMO
nation is supplied for the outcome-based meas-
ure of stickiness.
*Unless otherwise indicated, answers were
scored by using the default scale (Y! Y DEMO N
N!).
Key for the default scale: Y! = 'yes!'; Y = 'yes,
but'; o = 'no opinion'; N = 'no, not really', N!
= 'No!'
DEMO overall score for each scale was computed
by adding the standardized scores obtained from
each question.
Stickiness-outcome-based measure (a= 0.8,
Items = 8)
Stickiness was measured with a set of eight items
corresponding to DEMO so-called technical success
indicators of a project (Pinto and Mantel, 1990;
Randolph and Posner, 1988)-on time, on
budget, and a satisfied recipient. Deviation in
timing was measured as departure from the initial
DEMO in reaching key milestones-the start of
the transfer, the first day DEMO practice became
operational at the recipient and achievement of
satisfactory performance. For these three items
the five possible answers were 1: ADVANCED BY
MORE
THAN ONE MONTH,
2:
ADVANCED LESS
THAN ONE MONTH, 3: NOT RESCHEDULED, 4:
DELAYED LESS THAN ONE MONTH, 5: DEMO
MORE THAN ONE MONTH. Two items measured
departure of actual cost from expected cost on
the source side and the recipient side. For these
DEMO items the five possible answers were 1: MUCH
(>30%) MORE THAN EXPECTED, 2: SLIGHTLY
MORE (<30%) THAN EXPECTED, 3: AS EXPECTED;
4: SLIGHTLY (<30%) LESS THAN EXPECTED; 5:
MUCH LESS 030%) THAN EXPECTED. Finally,
three items measured recipient's satisfaction. One
item measured adjustment in the recipient's
expectations after gaining DEMO with the
practice. The possible answers for this question
were 1: DEMO UPWARD, 2: SLIGHTLY
UPWARD, 3: NO CHANGE, 4: SLIGHTLY DOWN-
WARD, 5: DRAMATICALLY DOWNWARD. Two items
measured whether the recipient DEMO satisfied with
the quality of the practice and with the quality
of the transfer. For these two items, the possible
answers were 1: DEMO SATISFIED, 2: SOMEWHAT
SATISFIED, 3: NEITHER SATISFIED NOR DISSATIS-
FIED, 4: SOMEWHAT DISSATISFIED, 5: VERY DISSAT-
ISFIED.
Stickiness-process-based measure: Initiation
stage. (a= 0.74, Items = 8), default scale
Ranking the DEMO of <company +'s units
on their results on <practice+ was straightfor-
ward. Within <compaizy+ there existed consen-
sus that <source+ has DEMO the best results
with <practice+. Compared to external bench-
marks, <DEMO has obtained best-in-class
results with <practice+. <source+ could easily
explain how it obtained superior results with
<practice+. <source+ could easily point to DEMO
key components of <practice +. 4 source+ was
reluctant to share DEMO knowledge and infor-
mation relative to <practice+. Distributing
responsibility for the DEMO between <source+
and @recipient+ generated much conflict. The
transfer of <practice+ from <source+ to
<recipient+ was amply justified.
Stickiness-process-based measure:
Implementation DEMO (a= 0.83, Items = 13),
default scale
<recipient+ recognized <source +'s expertise
on <practice+. The transfer of <practice+ from
<source+ to <recipient+ disrupted <source+
normal operations. <recipient+ could not DEMO
personnel from regular operations so that it could
be properly trained. Communication of transfer
related information broke down within
<recipient+. <recipient+ was able DEMO recognize
inadequacies in <source+ 's offerings.
<recipient+ knew what questions DEMO ask
<source+. <recipient+ knew how to recognize
Exploring Internal Stickiness
its requirements for <practice+. <recipient+
performed unnecessary modifications to the
<practice +. <recipient+ modified the
<practice+ in ways contrary to expert's advice.
<source+ turned out to be less knowledgeable
of the <practice+ than it appeared before the
transfer was decided. Much of what <recipient+
should have done during the transfer was eventu-
ally completed by <source 9. <DEMO under-
stood <recipients's unique situation. All aspects
of the transfer DEMO <practice+ from <source+
to <recipient+ were carefully planned.
Stickiness-process-based measure: Ramp-up
stage. (a= 0.77, Items = 9), default scale
Initially <recipient+ 'spoon fed' the <practice+
with carefully selected personnel and raw material
until it got up to speed. At first @recipient+
measured performance DEMO often than usual,
sometimes reacting too briskly to transient
declines in performance. Some people left
<recipient+ after having been trained for their
new role in the <practice+, forcing <recipient+
to hire hastily a replacement and train it 'on the
fly'. Some people turned out to be poorly quali-
fied to perform their new role in the <practice+,
forcing <recipient+ to hire hastily a replacement
and train it 'DEMO the fly'. The <practice+ had
unsatisfactory side effects which <recipient+ had
to correct. By altering the @practice+,
<recipient+ created further problems which had
to be solved, <recipients's environment turned
out to DEMO different from that of <source+ forcing
<recipient+ to make unforeseen changes to
<practice +. Outside experts (from <source+,
other units, DEMO external consultants) could answer
questions and solve problems about their specialty
DEMO did not have an overall perspective on the
<practice+. Teams put DEMO to help
<recipient+ to get up to speed with the
<practice+ disbanded because their members
had to attend to other pressing tasks.

up to DEMO became habitual. For the @practice$
today, the roles are well defined, @recipient$
personnel are content to play their roles in
<practice+. The appropriateness of performing
the @practice+ in <recipient + has been
explicitly questioned after its introduction.
@recipient$ has reconsidered its decision to
adopt the @practice+. @recipient9'DEMO expec-
tations created during the introduction of the

DEMO REALITY.
APPENDIX 2: OPERATIONALIZATION
OF THE INDEPENDENT
VARIABLES-ORIGINS OF
STICKINESS
The DEMO of the scales follows the same
convention used in Appendix 1 for dependent
variables.
Causal ambiguity (a= 0.86, Items = 6),
default scale
The limits of the @practice+ are fully specified:
With the DEMO, we know why a given
action results in a given outcome; When a prob-
lem surfaced with the @practice+, the precise
reasons for failure could not be articulated even
after the event; There is a precise list of the
skills, resources and prerequisites necessary for
successfully performing the @practice+; It is
well known how the components of that list
interact to produce <practice+'s output;
Operating procedures for the 6 practice 9 are
available; Useful manuals for the <practice+ are
available; Existing work manuals and operating
procedures describe precisely what people work-
ing DEMO the @practice% actually do.
Unproven knowledge (a= 0.67, Items = 3),
default scale unless indicated
We had solid proof that @practice+ was really
helpful; <practice+ contributes significantly to
the competitive advantage of <company+; For
the success of @company$, the <practice$ is:
1. CRITICAL, 2. VERY IMPORTANT, 3. FAIRLY
IMPORTANT, 4. FAIRLY UNIMPORTANT, 5. DEMO
IMPORTANT AT ALL.
Source lacks motivation (a= 0.93,
Items = DEMO), binary scales
Source saw benefit in: measuring its own per-
DEMO; understanding its own practices; shar-
ing this understanding with other units; sharing
the limits of this understanding with other units;
assessing the feasibility of the transfer; communi-
cating with <recipient+; planning the transfer;
documenting @practice+ for transfer;
implementing @recipients's support systems;
DEMO <recipient+'s personnel; helping
<recipient+ troubleshoot; helping resolve recipi-
ent's unexpected problems; lending skilled per-
sonnel.
Source is not perceived as reliable (a= 0.64,
Items = 8), default scale unless indicated
<source9 and <recipient + have similar Key
Success Factors; @source+: DEMO INVENTED THE
@PRACTICE$, 2. WAS THE FIRST UNIT TO HAVE
EXPERIENCE, 3. RECEIVED PRACTICE FORM OTHER
UNIT, @source% was able to accommodate the
needs of <recipient + into <practice+;
<source+ had a hidden agenda; The superior
results of the @source$ were visible; remained
stable; <source+ possessed the necessary
resources to support the transfer; @source+ has
DEMO history of successful transfers.
Recipient lacks motivation (a= 0.93,
Items DEMO 14), binary items
Recipient saw benefit in: measuring its own DEMO
formance; comparing it with the performance of
other units; understanding its own practices;
absorbing <source+'s understanding; analyzing
the feasibility of DEMO @practice$; communi-
cating its needs to <source+; planning the trans-
DEMO; implementing the systems and facilities for
<practice+, assigning personnel full time to the
transfer; assigning personnel to be trained in
<practice+; understanding the implications of
the transfer; troubleshooting <practice+; insuring
that its people knew their jobs; insuring that its
people consented to keep doing their jobs.
Recipient lacks absorptive capacity (a= 0.83,
Items = 9), default scale
Members of <recipient+ have a common langu-
age to deal with the <practice+; <.recipient+
had a vision of what it was trying to achieve
through the transfer; <recipient+ had infor-
mation on the state-of-the-art of the <practice+;
<recipient+ had a clear division of roles and
responsibilities to implement the <practice+;
<recipient+ had the necessary skills to
implement the <practice+; <recipient+ had the
technical competence to absorb the <practice+;
<recipient+ had the managerial competence to
absorb the <practice+; It is well DEMO who
can best exploit new information about the
<practice+ within <recipient+; It is well
known who can help solve problems associated
with the <practice+.
Recipient lacks retentive capacity (a= 0.81,
Items = 6), default scale
<recipient+ periodically retrains existing person-
nel on the <practice+; <recipient+ has mech-
anisms to detect malfunctions of the <practice+;
<recipient+ regularly measures performance and
corrects problems as soon as these happen;
<recipient+'s personnel can predict how they
will be rewarded for good performance in the
<practice+; 4 recipient 9's personnel are DEMO
vided with numerous opportunities to commit
freely and publicly to perform their role; At
<recipient+ there is a clear focal point for the
<practice a.
Barren organizational context (a= 0.77,
Items = 14), default scale
Existing performance measures of the
<practice+ are detailed enough to be meaning-
ful; Performance measures of the <practice+ are
taken frequently DEMO to be timely; Perform-
Exploring Internal Stickiness
ance measures of the <practice+ from different
units are easily comparable; <company +
enforces company-wide DEMO policies with
respect to the <practice+; At <company+ there
is DEMO pressure to improve performance; It
is easy to justify time spent DEMO other units;
To visit another unit, it is easy to DEMO travel
expenses; At <company +, improving perform-
ance by copying DEMO adapting practices from
other units is as legitimate as improving perform-
ance from own creativity. At <company+, a unit
that exposes those needs DEMO it is unable to meet
on its own loses status; At <company+, a unit
that exposes unresolved problems loses status; At
<company+, despite structural differences units
can always learn from one another; Normally DEMO
best-in-class practice is most likely to be found
outside <company 9; At <company +, managers
seem to prefer to use external sources DEMO help
and support even though they are more expensive
and less useful; At <company+, corporate pride
and values encourage managers not to look out-
side for help or to share with the outside.
