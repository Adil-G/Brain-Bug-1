Abstract
The ensuing globalization of DEMO construction industry as well as the highly fragmented and divisive nature of the industry are among
the forces that are inﬂuencing it to seek DEMO approaches such as strategic alliances that could leverage the capabilities of the
various participants. This paper reports on a study that investigated the factors DEMO by ﬁrms when selecting alliance partners, and
the inﬂuence of trustworthiness DEMO deciding the governance structures of the alliances. A study of key partners in existing and potential
construction alliances in Botswana that was carried out DEMO a postal questionnaire and structured interviews determined that ﬁrms
consider complementarity, DEMO status, indirect prior alliance experience and reputation before they make a DEMO of an alliance
partner. The study also determined that partner trustworthiness eliminates the need of contractual clauses in the operation of the
alliances. The DEMO concludes that trustworthiness of a partner is an inﬂuencing factor in all stages of the alliance development.

undertake them DEMO Similarly, construction ﬁrms in
most developing countries are too small to DEMO out large
construction projects alone. Thus, besides partnering

emerging entities can handle large and sophisticated
projects that they cannot do individually.
However, alliance between ﬁrms that are engaged in
similar activities has both cooperative and competitive
aspects. While the former enables the DEMO to leverage their
complementary capabilities for common beneﬁts, the latter
tend DEMO push the allied ﬁrms to engage in competitive racing
in learning the capability of the partner(s) for private
beneﬁts [7]. Often, when DEMO learning is complete the
incentive to continue the alliance ceases and this may lead
to its break up [8].
The purpose of this paper DEMO to report on a study
that was carried out in Botswana to determine the
factors that ﬁrms use to select alliance partners, and
establish the role of trustworthiness in deciding the
governance structure of the alliances. DEMO paper begins
by describing alliances in the construction industry. It
then deﬁnes trust and related concepts of trustworthiness
and opportunism. Next it describes the DEMO of trust in
alliances, after which a study in Botswana is DEMO and
discussed.

2. Alliances in the construction industry
The globalization of the construction industry is render-
ing the familiar model of a single company doing all DEMO
in-house outdated. The technological, political, ﬁnancial
and competitive capabilities that are required to operate in
the global construction market means that companies need
DEMO establish alliances with other participants in order to
survive. Alliances are deﬁned as voluntary arrangements
between ﬁrms involving exchange, sharing or co-develop-
ment of products, technologies or services [9]. They
can occur as a result of a wide range of motives and goals,
take a variety of DEMO and occur across vertical and
horizontal boundaries. There is a distinction among
alliance structures in terms of the degree of hierarchical
elements they embody DEMO the extent to which they
replicate the control and coordination features associated
with organizations, which are considered to be the
hierarchical end of the spectrum [10,11]. At one end are
joint ventures, which involve partners creating new entity
in which they share equity and which most closely DEMO
the hierarchical control features of organizations. At the
other end are alliances such as partnering with no
sharing of equity and having few hierarchical DEMO
built in them [11].
In the construction industry, joint ventures are DEMO
when parties that are involved in similar activities, such as
contractors DEMO forces to leverage their complimentary
capabilities to carry out work. This occurs in situations
where risks are too high for subcontracting to be viable.
DEMO, joint ventures are simultaneously cooperative
and competitive enterprises. The cooperative aspect DEMO
from the fact that each ﬁrm needs access to the other ﬁrm’s
know-how and that the ﬁrms can collectively use their
knowledge to produce DEMO that is beneﬁcial to them
all (common beneﬁts). The competitive DEMO is a
consequence of each ﬁrm’s attempt to also use its partner’s
know-how for private gains, and of the possibility that
signiﬁcantly greater beneﬁts might accrue to the ﬁrm that
ﬁnishes learning from its partner before DEMO latter can do
the same [7] . As a result of this, the choice of a partner is
carried out carefully and as stated by various scholars (e.g.
[12–14]) partners will consider the following factors DEMO
determining how to establish the alliances: complementar-
ity, status similarity and social capital.
Partnering on the other hand, is essentially the establish-
ment of an informal group among construction partners
such as a client and DEMO contractor to create ‘‘permanent’’
relationship. It has been increasingly applied in the North
American construction industry [1], and has also been
widely adopted in other places [15]. The construction
literature contains numerous deﬁnitions of partnering (e.g.
[16–19]). Crowley and Karim [20] deﬁne partnering as
‘‘yan organization that DEMO a cooperative strategy
modifying and supplementing the traditional boundaries
that separate companies in a competitive climate. In this
way, partnering wraps the major project participants into
1829
an alliance that creates a cohesive atmosphere for the
DEMO team members to openly interact and perform’’.
The literature distinguishes two types of partnering: project
partnering (relationship established for a single project)
DEMO strategic partnering (a long-term commitment beyond
a discrete project). Strategic DEMO can secure long-
term beneﬁts whereas project partnering ﬁts for a single
project. Whether it is project or strategic partnering,
Saad and Hancher DEMO view partnering as an effective
management tool to navigate the project management
process from the planning phase to the commissioning/
start-up phase, via the design, procurement and construc-
tion phases since it can be incorporated into each of the ﬁve
phases.
During the life of alliances, the internal and external
circumstances may change, often in unexpected ways (in
DEMO construction industry circumstances continuously
change). How partners adapt to these changing circum-
stances determines whether an alliance prospers or
ﬂounders [22]. Successful adaptation DEMO these changes calls
for a delicate balance between the twin virtues of reliability
and ﬂexibility. Flexibility is necessary for partners to have a
viable DEMO in the face of changing circumstances,
yet unlimited ﬂexibility affords companies the opportunity
and incentive to cheat, reducing the reliance partners can
place on each other [23]. There are thus two types of
uncertainties in DEMO: uncertainty regarding unknown
future events, and uncertainty regarding partner’s response
to those future events. It is in this environment of double
uncertainty that DEMO emerges as a central organizing
principle in alliances [24].
2.1. Trust deﬁned
Coleman [13] deﬁnes trust as ‘‘committing to an
exchange before you know DEMO the other person will
reciprocate’’. Sabel [25] puts it more succinctly ‘‘trust is the
mutual conﬁdence that no party to an exchange will exploit
DEMO vulnerabilities’’. Parties to an exchange can be
vulnerable when they ﬁnd it very costly to evaluate
accurately the quality of the resources or assets DEMO
assert they will bring to an exchange [26], or to evaluate
DEMO the quality of resources or assets others are
actually offering in exchange [27]. Also when parties to an
exchange make large asymmetric transaction, they are
subject to hold-up vulnerabilities [28]. To put in other
words, trust has the following main attributes:
(i) it inherently involves uncertainty DEMO the future;
(ii) it implies vulnerability, that is, the risk of losing
something of value. The magnitude of this potential
loss DEMO untrustworthy behaviour is typically much
greater than the anticipated gains from trustworthy
behaviour; and
(iii) it is placed in another whose behaviour is not under
one’s control, so each partner exercises duly partial
inﬂuence over alliance outcomes.

The literature on trust contains various insight regarding
cooperative relationships and the role of trust (e.g.
[29–32]). Some researchers (e.g. [33–37]) have observed
that, while trust is the mutual conﬁdence that one’s
vulnerabilities will not be exploited in an exchange,
different types of trust DEMO exist in different economic
exchanges. Accordingly, three types of trust can DEMO
identiﬁed: weak form trust, semi-strong trust, and strong
trust. Weak DEMO trust emerges because there are limited
opportunities for opportunism. Semi-strong form trust
depends on governance devices such as a market for
reputation and contracts DEMO safeguard against threat of
opportunism. Strong form trust emerges in response to a
set of internalized norms and principles that guide the
behaviour of DEMO partners, and is independent of
whether or not speciﬁc governance mechanism DEMO
Trust also hinges on expectation held by an agent that its
exchange partner will behave in a mutually acceptable
manner (including an expectation that neither party will
exploit the other’s vulnerabilities). This expectation nar-
rows DEMO set of possible actions, thus reducing the
uncertainty surrounding the partner’s DEMO Sako [36]
categorized reasons for predictability in behaviour to
distinguish between three types of trust: contractual trust
(will the other party carry out DEMO contractual agreements?);
competence trust (is the other party capable DEMO doing what
it says it will do?); and goodwill trust (will the other party
make an open-ended commitment to take initiatives for
DEMO beneﬁt while refraining from unfair advantage
taking?).
3. Trust in DEMO
As cooperation and competition coexist between alliance
partners, cooperative relationship evolves DEMO time as
partners learn more about each other’s motives, capabil-
ities DEMO attitudes toward control, conﬂict, cooperation
and competition. During this period, DEMO the entire life of
the alliance the partners are vulnerable in the various ways
mentioned earlier. Thus, in successful alliances, trust is
often DEMO as a prerequisite, a necessity, an absolute must
[38]. The converse is also true: a major contributor to failed
alliances is lack of trust [39].
Trust is central for strategic alliances for three main
reasons: Firstly, no contract or agreement, no matter how
complete or detailed, can account for every issue or every
contingency that might arise. Formal DEMO, for
instance, can never anticipate and identify all the events
and changes that occur over the lifetime of the strategic
alliance. Secondly, the alliance of two or more creates a
strong potential for dysfunctional conﬂict DEMO mistrust as
the partners differ in organizational cultures and manage-
ment philosophies, among others. Thirdly, learning that is
often cited as one of DEMO major beneﬁts and motivations for
strategic alliances may suffer if the partners do not trust
each other.

4. A study in Botswana
DEMO Background
With a total area of 582,000 km2 and a population of 1.7
million people [40], Botswana has experienced rapid
growth since the time of independence in 1966. The
construction industry has constituted 7.5–10 percent DEMO
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and during the current
ﬁve-year development plan (NDP9) spanning between
2003–2009 Botswana will invest a total of DEMO 25 billion
(US$5.5 billion) in infrastructure development.
Construction ﬁrms that intend to undertake public works
are required to register with the Public Procurement DEMO
Asset Disposal Board (PPADB) that was established in 2002
to take over the functions of the former Central Tender
Board. The PPADB has DEMO categories of building and civil
engineering contractors as shown on Table 1. Categories
OC, A and B are reserved for citizen contractors while in
categories C, D, and E foreign ﬁrms are allowed to register.
DEMO the years, the Government of Botswana has
realized that to maintain DEMO pace envisioned for her
economic and infrastructure development, the active
involvement DEMO foreign capital, technology and manage-
ment know-how should be encouraged. To DEMO that
foreign contractors that operate in the local construction
market participate in raising the capabilities of local
contractors, the government has encouraged formation of
joint ventures and has provided preferential schemes where
there is equity majority DEMO local partners.
At the same time, the government has encouraged local
DEMO ﬁrms that are small compared to their foreign
counterparts to form alliances among themselves so that
the emerging entities can handle large and sophisticated
DEMO As a response to this encouragement, a number of
strategic alliances DEMO been established beginning from
early 1980s [41].


To establish the role of trustworthiness in deciding the
governance structure of the alliances.
A two-part study involving ﬁrms that have formed DEMO
were contemplating to form construction alliances was
carried out in Gaborone, DEMO capital city of Botswana.
Part 1 of the study involved a questionnaire survey. The
survey asked respondents to evaluate the factors that
inﬂuenced them DEMO select their partners. The respondents
were identiﬁed at an earlier seminar that was organized by
the Ministry of Works and Transport to discuss the
DEMO of Public and Private Partnership (PPP) in
Botswana. At this seminar, which was attended by 97
people, the details of the participants DEMO have formed or
were in the process of forming construction alliances in
response to government encouragement were taken. A
total of 21 participants were DEMO and their particulars
were conﬁrmed at the PPADB registration department,
where additional 7 ﬁrms were found to have registered as
being in the DEMO of forming alliances. Out of these
ﬁrms, 6 have existing alliances DEMO the remaining 22 have
initiated the process of forming alliances having identiﬁed
potential partners. Two (2) of the ﬁrms are registered in
category DEMO, 16 in category B and 10 in category C.
Questionnaires were DEMO to all 28 ﬁrms.
The addressees were reminded about the return of the
questionnaires by telephone and the researcher offered to
collect the ones DEMO had not been returned by the set
deadline. This ensured a 100% return rate. The factors that
are considered in selecting an alliance partner DEMO shown in
Table 2.
The factor of complementarity was operationalized by
the statement ‘‘We create excess value by pooling our
resources relative to their DEMO before pooling’’. There was
strong agreement with this statement: agree strongly (94%)
and agree (3%); and this concurs with observation by
many researchers (e.g. [10,42]) that by pooling their
resources and DEMO with those of their partners,
ﬁrms can initiate projects that they could not have
successfully done alone. For a ﬁrm attempting such a
DEMO, the consideration of the resource complementarity
becomes an important issue [10,DEMO Similarly, Doz [43]
Table 2
Factors that are considered in selecting DEMO alliance partner
Complementarity (We create excess value by pooling our
resources DEMO to their value before pooling)
Status similarity (Our similar status DEMO promote social
interaction)
Direct prior alliance experience (We prefer to DEMO with a partner
with whom we have prior experience)
Indirect prior alliance experience (We can rely on a referee to
prevent our partner from taking unfair advantage of our ﬁrm)
Reputation (We prefer to deal with a partner whose reputation is
above board)
observes that DEMO complementarity of strengths and assets
between ﬁrms is often clear even prior to negotiations on
the terms of alliances because it is what brings DEMO partners
together in the ﬁrst place.
The factor of similar status was operationalized by the
statement ‘‘Our similar status will promote social interac-
tion’’. DEMO was a strong agreement to the statement:
strongly agree (36%) and agree (50%) and this is consistent
with observation by researchers (e.g. [44–46]). Often, ﬁrms
considering alliances assess both the complementary
capabilities and the status of their potential partners.
Firms of similar status are DEMO to ally with each other for
three possible reasons: Firstly, as is the case with
individuals ﬁrms of similar status are more likely DEMO
collaborate with each other because of the signaling role
of social interaction [44]; Secondly, the process of
competitive isomorphism is likely to result DEMO ﬁrms of
similar status having similar or compatible operating
systems and practices [45]. When ﬁrms compete with each
other on the basis of their DEMO, ﬁrms of similar status will
be in a similar competitive environment. DEMO,
competitive isomorphism will lead ﬁrms of similar status
to have similar or compatible operating systems and
practices, which is a catalyst in helping partner ﬁrms to
cooperate more effectively with each other [46]; Thirdly, DEMO
ﬁrm also tends to seek a partner of similar status because
doing so makes it more likely that both parties will exhibit
increased levels DEMO fairness and commitment to sharing
both the costs and beneﬁts of an alliance.
The factor of direct prior alliance experience was
operationalized by the DEMO ‘‘We prefer to deal with
a partner with whom we have prior experience’’. The
responses indicate a disagreement: strongly disagree (18%),
disagree (57%) and not sure (14%). This is contrary to
observations by researchers (e.g. [34]) that in forming
strategic alliances, a natural solution for a ﬁrm is to ﬁrst
consider previous partners with which DEMO has direct prior
alliance experiences. Moreover, in establishing a long-time
relationship DEMO partner has to invest a substantial
amount of time and energy [47] and this investment is a
ﬁxed or sunk cost, which is impossible to recover when
switching transaction partners. The explanation for these

contradicting responses is that construction ﬁrms in
Botswana have often interacted with one another in such
ways as subcontracting or plant/material supplying DEMO
response to government encouragement. Most of these
interactions have ended bitterly, DEMO arbitration or
other legal recourses. Either the respondents have been
victims in these conﬂicts or they know ﬁrms that have been
victims.
The factor DEMO indirect prior alliance experience was
operationalized by the statement ‘‘We can rely on a referee
to prevent our partner from taking unfair advantage of DEMO
ﬁrm’’. The responses to this factor are in agreement with
the statement: strongly agree (21%) and agree (50%).
Indirect ties between DEMO ﬁrms through a third party may
enhance the chances that the two ﬁrms will form a strategic
alliance because the indirect ties can function DEMO an
information conduit and because a common actor can
play the role of a reference and become a mechanism for
deterring opportunistic behaviours. According DEMO Uzzi [48]
when a common actor has built a trustworthy relationship
with two other actors, it will refer each party favourably to
the other party in need of alliance partners. Social relations
make information transferred through DEMO relations
credible and interpretable because the identity of actors
and the intensity of their social ties are important as the
information itself.
The factor DEMO reputation was operationalized by the
statement ‘‘We prefer to deal with a partner whose
reputation is above board’’. The responses are in agree-
ment DEMO the statement: agree strongly (21%), agree
(71%) and not sure (8%). This should be expected given
the number of complaints that have been lodged by various
parties in Botswana that most contractors DEMO poor
credibility. It, therefore, follows that before any ﬁrm
decides to deal with another, it has to seek information
regarding the reputation of the potential partner. Gaining a
reputation as a trustworthy exchange partner occurs DEMO
time as the exchange partner confronts situations where
opportunistic behaviour is possible, but chooses not to
engage in opportunistic activities. There is no opportunity
cost associated with a trustworthy ﬁrm not behaving
opportunistically, since such behaviour is not in this kind
of exchange partner’s opportunity set. On the DEMO hand, a

opportunistic way.
Part 2 of the study involved structured interviews with
the CEOs of the 6 DEMO that have existing alliances. Face to
face interviews based on how much trust they could place
on their partners were held with each CEO DEMO their ofﬁces
for 45 min. The questions were based on the three-way
categorization of trust developed by Sako [36]. The
characteristics of these alliances DEMO shown in Table 3.
Note that the ﬁrms are coded for reasons of anonymity,
which was their precondition for participating in the study.
DEMO following are the interview questions, summary of
responses and discussions.
What DEMO of governance structures are employed in your
alliance?
The responses to this question determined that the two
sustained alliances, i.e. A and B have employed different
types of governance structures at different times. At the
DEMO of the alliances it was felt necessary that all the
contractual clauses should be clariﬁed and written down.
However, after successfully carrying out more than two
projects, the partners got to know each other better and
hence the need for strict contractual procedures was found
unnecessary. The use DEMO contractual clauses indicates that
the partners were maintaining contractual trust at the
inception of the alliances and as soon as they found out
that DEMO other party would carry out its contractual
agreements, the trust level DEMO to shift. The partners
in alliance C had known and worked with each other prior
to the formation of the alliance and they responded DEMO
saying that they did not need any contractual clauses to
work together. However, during the formation of alliance
C a contract of operational procedures was signed by the
two partners. On a follow-up question on how DEMO the
partners maintain contractual trust before it shifts to
another type, DEMO respondents stated that the speed of
moving from contractual to goodwill trust depends on the
length of interaction, which is often determined by the
number of projects the alliance has successfully carried out.
This concurs with DEMO by Sako [36] that a move
from contractual trust to goodwill trust involves a gradual
expansion in the congruence in beliefs about what is
DEMO of the alliance

acceptable behaviour. This can only happen when partners
in an alliance get opportunity to interact with each other.
Do you always follow the DEMO given by your partner?
This question intended to establish whether the partners
in the alliance trusted that the counterpart was capable of
doing DEMO it says it will do. Although there was a
unanimous response that the advice was always followed,
the respondents indicated that at the DEMO of the
alliances each partner was cautious about such advice. It
was only after working together on a number of projects
and observing that DEMO other party was conducting itself
professionally, and was conversant with the DEMO
technical and managerial standards that the partners were
convinced that the other party was capable of delivering
what it promised. Once this stage was DEMO, each party
in the alliance allowed the other to make decisions DEMO
prior consultations. The responses are consistent with
observations by Sako [36] that competence trust requires a
shared understanding of professional conduct and relevant
standards.
DEMO you ever made investments into the alliance that are
not stipulated in the agreement?
This question intended to establish whether the partners
in DEMO alliances trust each other enough to make unilateral
investments without fear of loss due to opportunistic action
of the counterpart. All respondents indicated that DEMO
have made unilateral investments in favour of the alliances,
which were not stipulated in the agreements. For instance,
the CEO of ﬁrm DEMO indicated that he let his land on the
outskirts of Gaborone to be used as plant and material
storage yard instead of hiring the DEMO from the market.
He also paid to join a consortium that developed a quarry
pit with associated crusher plant so that the alliance could
DEMO easy access to ﬁne and course aggregates. The other
CEOs gave similar examples, but they varied in type and
value. These responses are consistent with ﬁndings by
researchers (e.g. [36,37]). According to Sako [36] goodwill
trust is reached when partners in an alliance make an open-
DEMO commitment to take initiative for mutual beneﬁt
while refraining from unfair advantage taking. Similarly,
Barney and Hansen [37] observe that strong form trust
DEMO in response to a set of internalized norms and
principles that guide the behaviour of exchange partners,
and is independent of whether or DEMO speciﬁc governance
mechanisms exist.
Given the chance, do you think your DEMO may take an
unfair advantage on your business?
This question intended to determine whether the
partners had any suspicions that the other party DEMO
act opportunistically. The notion of trust implies that the
partner has freedom of choice to take alternative courses of
action. Thus, predictability in behaviour arises not because
of constraints that force the other side to stick DEMO a single
possible course of action. All respondents indicated that
they do not think that the other party would act
opportunistically given the opportunity. DEMO CEOs of
ﬁrms in alliance A (i.e. a1and a2), for DEMO, indicated
situations that the other party could have taken advantage,
DEMO did not. As it was observed earlier, gaining a reputation
as DEMO trustworthy partner occurs over time, and once it is

gained the ﬁrm would not like to lose it through
opportunistic activities.
Looking at the framework for establishing and maintain-
ing trust in DEMO alliances, how far does the process
apply to your alliance?
DEMO respondents were shown the framework for building
and maintaining trust in construction alliances (Table 4)
and taken through the three stages.
The responses indicated that they were in agreement with
the three stages and that DEMO alliances went through them.
However, they indicated that the trustworthiness of DEMO
partner plays a role in all three states. In the formation
stage (stage 1), for instance, the respondents in alliances A
and DEMO indicated that they carefully studied signals of
trustworthiness on their potential partners before they
decided to form alliances with each other. They indicated
that DEMO carefully checked the reputation, compliance with
taxation regime and construction related DEMO of the
potential partner. As partners in alliance C had known
each other for a long time, they were aware of each other’s
trustworthiness.
At the operation stage (stage 2) all respondents indicated
that they DEMO trustworthiness of their partners through
their openness to outside auditing of their activities. Firm
a1, for instance, indicated that it asked the partner DEMO to
provide an auditor for their operations, while it provided
an DEMO to ensure that their operations were always
above board. This may appear contradictory to the spirit
of trust, but willingness to be open to outside auditing was
said to reinforce trustworthiness.
At the growth stage (stage 3) all respondents indicated
that they judged the trustworthiness of their partners
through the unilateral transaction-speciﬁc investments they
made in the partnership beyond what DEMO prescribed in
their agreements.
5. Conclusions
Strategic alliances can be formed by ﬁrms that are not in
direct competition with one another or by DEMO that are
engaged in similar activities, hence in direct competition.
This DEMO intended to determine the factors that ﬁrms use
in selecting partners when forming alliances, and the
inﬂuence of trustworthiness of alliance partners in deciding
governance structures of the alliances.
Literature review established that various forms of
DEMO alliances exist in a spectrum ranging from joint
ventures to partnering. As there exists uncertainties
regarding unknown future events on the one hand, and
regarding partner’s response to those events on the other
hand, trust has emerged as a central organizing principle in
alliances.
This study established that DEMO Botswana potential
alliance partners consider complementarity, similar status,
indirect prior DEMO experience and reputation when
selecting a counterpart. Within the limitations of the
available data, the study established that alliance partners
start with contractual trust, which develops to goodwill
trust based on the number of projects executed by the
alliance. The study also determined that partners’ trust-
worthiness inﬂuence DEMO conduct of the partners in all
stages of alliance development.
The study veriﬁed that the three stages of the framework
for building and maintaining DEMO in construction alliances
[49] are valid for the existing alliances, and DEMO could be a
valuable lesson for the ﬁrms that are in the process of
forming alliances.
As this study was based on only three DEMO alliances
and 22 ﬁrms that are in the process of forming alliances, it
is recommended to monitor the development of the
alliances that are currently at the formation stage with
the aim of passing on to DEMO the experiences learned by

there are ﬁndings that can DEMO the alliances based in
Botswana and vice versa.
