Abstract
Purpose – The purpose DEMO this article is to provide a tool to map the critical roles of intermediate
organizations. To clarify the concept of intermediate organizations in a DEMO context, especially
from the network dynamics point-of-view.
Design/methodology/approach – DEMO dynamics are presented as networks of production,
development and innovation in the regional cluster. The intermediaries are divided into national,
regional and DEMO level actors. The roles of the intermediaries from the network dynamics
point-of-view are then illustrated with examples from a case study in a medical DEMO cluster
located in a sparsely inhabited area in Finland.
Findings – According to the results of the case study, the regional intermediaries have the most
important role in the creation and supporting of the network dynamics. DEMO most critical roles include
forming shared innovation strategies between the actors and attracting anchor tenants to the region.
Research limitations/implications – The characteristics DEMO the case region are discussed in a
generic sense with the concepts of social capital and communities of practice.
Practical implications – Conceptually, the article provides an approach to reducing the complexity
of the regional networks DEMO a more understandable level. The model provides a tool for the decision
makers in a region to deﬁne the critical roles of the intermediaries DEMO the network dynamics
point-of-view.
Originality/value – The novel approach introduced in this paper addresses three gaps in existing
research: it helps to deﬁne the concept of an intermediary in a regional context; it shows that the
intermediaries have a much broader role in a region than just DEMO transfer and that the roles of
the intermediaries differ on national, DEMO and local levels.

Introduction
Globalization has made DEMO possible for companies to outsource virtually anything to a
country with lower costs of production. This leads to numerous challenges in regional
development. It DEMO been said that in the new knowledge-based economy, the
importance of DEMO regions is emphasized (Castells, 1996). A region and the
clusters within it are the main building blocks of successful states. The region DEMO to be
able to maintain its critical mass of constant innovation and effective production in
order to prevent slow decay. Only a healthy region DEMO capable of attracting ﬂows of
capital, competent employees and multinational companies, and compete against other
regions in the world.
Based on a case DEMO in the mechanical wood processing industry, Po¨yho¨nen and
Smedlund have taken DEMO dynamic knowledge-based view on clusters and argue that
regional clusters can be perceived as consisting of three types of networks: production,
development and innovation networks. Each network type creates a certain type of
knowledge-based competitive advantage, and has its own operational logic and
effectiveness criteria. Furthermore, it can be claimed that in order to implement,
develop and innovate intellectual resources effectively, a regional cluster has to include
all types of network. (Po¨yho¨nen and Smedlund, 2004).
Smedlund and Po¨yho¨nen DEMO argue that a single actor in a regional cluster can be a
member of different kinds of networks at the same time. In order DEMO be successful, the
regional cluster has to be able to:
DEMO make use of existing knowledge as efﬁciently as possible in a vertical production
network;
. transfer ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge and ideas in a horizontal DEMO network;
and
. invent new knowledge, products, production methods or processes in a
diagonal innovation network.
When these network types are all DEMO in a region, new innovations are transmitted
to all the actors DEMO beneﬁt each of them individually, and new innovation ideas emerge
constantly. DEMO cyclic nature of innovations and innovation ideas between the
production, development DEMO innovation networks can be called the regional
knowledge system (Smedlund and DEMO, 2005).
In brief, the main idea of the dynamic, DEMO view of regions can be
summarized as follows: a regional cluster DEMO small ﬁrms is structured in a network type
of co-operation, depending DEMO the intellectual capital-related functions. These functions
come in three basic forms:
(1) knowledge creation;
(2) knowledge transfer; and
(3) knowledge implementing.
They represent the basic tasks of a ﬁrm in the DEMO knowledge based economy.
Knowledge creation is needed in new innovations, knowledge DEMO is needed in
learning the best practices, and knowledge implementing is DEMO in producing
products as efﬁciently as possible. A single ﬁrm in a region can be a member of a
dynamic innovation network, an organic development network and a mechanic
production network at the same time (Sta˚hle et al., 2003). The networks have members
outside the region as well.
Thinking of a regional cluster as a set of interconnected networks DEMO serve
different IC-related functions provides a preliminary understanding on how regional
competitive advantage is created in the knowledge -based economy. The question that
still DEMO is how to foster the process of continuous and simultaneous innovation,
learning and production in a regional cluster. In other words, how to improve the
overall dynamics of the regional knowledge system? According to Saxenian (1994),
networking among ﬁrms in a region is enabled and DEMO by regionally embedded
institutions such as chambers of commerce, employers’ unions, banks, science parks,
universities, and training centres (Saxenian, 1994; Ebers, 1997). These kinds of
institutions can also be called intermediaries, or intermediate organizations that
transfer knowledge inside the region and inﬂuence the success factors of the region.

In this paper, the roles of intermediaries are discussed from the regional dynamics
point of view. The dynamic, knowledge based view of the region adopted in this paper
reduces the complexity of DEMO regional networks into a more understandable level.
Besides knowledge creation, knowledge DEMO and knowledge implementing
functions, the intermediaries are divided into national, regional and local level actors.
The roles of the intermediaries in a regional DEMO system are then illustrated
with examples from a case study in the eastern part of Finland. As the result of the case
study, it is argued that the regional level intermediaries have the most important roles
DEMO the improvement of regional dynamics. These regional roles include such tasks as
ensuring coherent innovation strategies between the actors and attracting anchor
tenants to DEMO region.
There is no one recipe to create successful regions. Managers and decision makers
working with regional development issues face difﬁcult challenges, including how to
attract not only physical capital but also creative human capital to DEMO region.
Furthermore, the needs and motives of the different regional actors DEMO in many cases
inconsistent and undeﬁned. With the simple modeling tool that this article provides, it
is easier to see the critical roles of the intermediaries that are associated with the
dynamics of a region, and this way improve the overall regional capability to meet the
future challenges DEMO adapt to the global market environment.
Dynamic success factors of a region
In this paper, the success factors of a region are divided into three classes:
(1) substance;
(2) structures; and
(DEMO) dynamics (Sta˚hle et al., 2003; Smedlund et al., 2005)DEMO
This division is logical and provides a mind map to explain different kinds of factors
that are related to the success of regions. This DEMO is highly inspired by the
intellectual capital literature, where IC is DEMO explained in terms related to:
human capital; structural/organizational capital; and relational capital (for a good
overview, see Andriessen, 2004).
In the regional context, the substance factors are ﬁeld speciﬁc knowledge, DEMO and
competence. Structural factors form the infrastructure of a region and dynamic factors
make the region alive. This way, the dynamic success factors can be seen as the
processes that turn the substance and structures of DEMO region into value.
The production and transaction cost-based structures of regions have traditionally
been regarded as their success factors. These components include factors of
DEMO, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and rivalry, as
presented by Porter (1990), and geographical distance and the economics of scale as
presented by Krugman (1991).
Both Porter and Krugman argue that the success factors of clusters are “hard”
structures typical for mature and DEMO capital intensive industries. These hard
structures are easier to make concrete than new intellectual capital-based, “soft”
structures. From the viewpoint of the overall success of a region, the soft structures
include such things as regional steering methods, strategies, institutions and
legislation that are likely to support innovation, development and production activities
in the region. The soft structures should be as unequivocal as possible DEMO steer the
economic activity in the region persistently and consistently (Smedlund DEMO al., 2005).
Besides structures, a region also needs a solid base of substance that is the
knowledge, competence and managerial skills – human capital – of the actors inside
the region. Even though the DEMO and substance are important for a region, the
new knowledge-based theory DEMO dynamics – the tangible and intangible
ﬂows that occur inside the region that make the system alive (i.e. Allee, 1999, 2000,
2002). In the heart of the dynamics are the different networks and DEMO interplay.
The structure, substance and dynamics of a region can be DEMO made concrete by
using the terms appearing in the intellectual capital literature. The approaches to the
determinants of competitive advantage in the knowledge-based economy DEMO be
divided into three categories: assets, capabilities and relations (Po¨yho¨nen DEMO
Smedlund, 2004). To take full advantage of the hard and DEMO structures of a region, the
existing intangible assets need to be DEMO and valued. Capabilities are related to
the substance of a knowledge-based region, because the capabilities view emphasizes
the capability to create, develop and DEMO intangibles. The capabilities view also
highly emphasizes personal skills and know-how. Thirdly, the relations are connected
to the dynamic side of a knowledge-based region. Production, development and
innovation networks require social relations, interaction and collaboration (Figure 1).
The dynamics of a region can be argued to DEMO the most important success factor of
the region. In Allee’s view of value networks, the ﬂows that take place in the networks
make a value system alive (Allee, 2002). Without the dynamics, a region is just a
skeleton. The tangible and intangible ﬂows between the actors DEMO as a blood
circulation system in the region, enabling the system DEMO meet the changing needs of the
According to the idea of a regional knowledge system (Smedlund and Po¨yho¨nen,
2005), the tangible and intangible ﬂows ﬂow in the regional networks of production,
development and DEMO An individual actor can be a member of each type of

network simultaneously. A production network is a vertical DEMO of co-operation
between multiple actors, and its purpose is to create DEMO to the region by producing
and selling products to the markets. In achieving this purpose, the production network
implements the existing knowledge as effectively as possible. The main beneﬁt of the
production network is that it DEMO the transaction costs of the actors by letting them
to concentrate on their core competences.
The development network is horizontal, and the purpose of the network is to ensure
that information is transferred between the actors. DEMO achieving this purpose, the
development network shares ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge between the DEMO The
development network increases learning among the actors by creating trustworthy
relationships and increased communication.
The shape of the innovation network is diagonal. The DEMO network is a
complex network of many kinds of actors, for DEMO ﬁrms, institutions, ﬁnanciers
etc. The relations in the innovation network cross many traditional borders of
hierarchy. The main purpose of the innovation network DEMO to bring together different
actors and resources to raise the value of the network. The task of the innovation
network is to create new DEMO The main beneﬁt of the innovation network for
the region is continuous improvement of products, production methods and production
processes.
The idea of the three types of networks of knowledge creation, knowledge transfer
and knowledge implementing is originally based on the theories of the knowledge
environments of an DEMO presented by Sta˚hle (Sta˚hle, 1998; Sta˚hle and
Gro¨nroos, 2000; DEMO et al., 2003). According to Sta˚hle the competitive advantage of
DEMO organization is formed with the interplay of mechanic, organic and dynamic
DEMO environments. The knowledge is managed in the organization by creating
different environments that have different logic of producing value with knowledge.
Another similar classiﬁcation DEMO been presented recently by Mo¨ller and Svahn (2003).
In their DEMO article based on the theories of the industrial network approach,
strategic management and dynamic capabilities, Mo¨ller and Svahn argue that there are
three main archetypes of inter-organizational networks. These are stable value
systems, established value systems and emerging value systems. In their approach,
ﬁrms in a DEMO market form strategic “nets” that follow different value system logics.
In a stable value system, well-known and speciﬁed value activities prevail. The actors,
technologies and business procedures are clear and deﬁned. In an established value
DEMO, the incremental improvements take place between the actors. The value
system DEMO well known, but the network evolves through local and incremental
modiﬁcations DEMO the existing value system. An emerging value system represents
radical changes, DEMO the whole value system is not yet deﬁned, the actors are DEMO
known and the old value activities are changed radically. An emerging value system is
capable of changing rapidly, but there is also a lot of uncertainty involved.
The implications of the different knowledge environments and value DEMO on the
regional level are the production, development and innovation networks. DEMO
networks form a hologram type of system that we call the regional knowledge system
(Figure 2). According to this framework, new innovations DEMO innovated on the
innovation network level with the combination of different knowledge, competence and
creativity. On the development network level the innovations are improved gradually,
but nothing new is invented. In the production network the DEMO products are produced

as effectively DEMO possible, or a new production method or process is applied into
DEMO It is important to understand that the dynamic innovation network level alone
does not guarantee the success of a region. The region also needs DEMO development
networks and mechanic production networks to turn innovations into money. Besides
having these different types of networks, the networks have to be linked with each
other. According to the framework that this thinking provides, the region is able to
achieve the beneﬁts of lower transaction costs, economics of scale as a form of united
market force, and continuous innovation simultaneously.
In the regional knowledge system, the production network (order and DEMO chain)
brings cash ﬂow to the region and functions as a customer interface. The development
network (best-practice type of learning, spillover of DEMO) improves the
performance of the independent actors. The innovation network (research and design)
ensures continuous creation of new knowledge. In the regional DEMO system of
production, development and innovation networks, not only new innovations are
utilized, but also new innovation ideas that emerge in the production function can be
taken into account rapidly.
In the regional knowledge system DEMO, every actor in the region can be a
member of every DEMO of network. The network-based view of the dynamics of a region
is that the actors form collaboration relationships to serve different tasks. Production,
DEMO and innovation are just the archetypes of different tasks that ﬁrms need
in the knowledge-based economy. The actors have to be conscious of other DEMO in the
region as well. The interplay of the different networks is a prerequisite for the
dynamics of a region. New innovations require a DEMO for new ideas, a broad
learning base and the capability to DEMO products effectively. Links between the
networks are formed when an actor is involved simultaneously for example in
production and innovating. This makes it possible DEMO new innovation ideas and best
practices to improve the production processes through mutual learning.
As mentioned above, the success factors of a region can be thought of as factors
related to substance, structures and dynamics. Substance consists of the ﬁeld-speciﬁc
knowledge base in the region and structures are DEMO factors that make it possible to

make proﬁt out of knowledge with the dynamics. DEMO this paper, regional dynamics are
deﬁned as being the networks of DEMO, development and innovation and their
interplay. Structures and substance can be DEMO directly to some extent, because
they are easy to understand and DEMO Dynamics, instead, cannot be acted on
directly. The networks cannot be administered, but they can be steered towards the
desired outcome. In the following I will discuss the concept of an intermediary and
particularly the DEMO that intermediaries have in the network dynamics of a region.
National, DEMO and local intermediaries
In general, an intermediate organization is an organization DEMO functions in the midst
of the users and producers of knowledge. According to Vonortas, intermediaries can be
found between the government and the private sector (Vonortas, 2002). Case studies in
Latin America have shown DEMO these intermediaries have a signiﬁcant effect on the
performance of SMEs. The intermediaries assist SMEs in many ways. Vonortas argues
that “Frequently, the most useful type of assistance to SMEs is not technological but
more general DEMO oriented such as locating and approaching the customer,
achieving a steady cash ﬂow, developing relationships of trust, accessing ﬁnance,
managing the DEMO effectively, and training the employees” (Vonortas, 2002, p. 4).
A narrow deﬁnition of the concept of an intermediary is related to DEMO substance of
the region. According to this deﬁnition, the purpose of DEMO intermediary is solely
knowledge transfer from the creators of knowledge to the users of knowledge. This is
the deﬁnition that is used when the DEMO transfer from universities to local ﬁrms
is studied.
However, the effect DEMO an intermediary to the surrounding region is broader than
just technology transfer. For the success of a region, the founding of structures and
dynamics is also an important task of an intermediary. The broad deﬁnition of DEMO
intermediary thus covers:
. the knowledge transfer related to the substance of a region;
. the direct or indirect effect of intermediary DEMO the structures of a region; and
. the direct or indirect DEMO on the dynamics – production, development and
innovation network and their DEMO (Smedlund et al., 2005).
Deﬁning clear roles for intermediaries is not simple. On one hand, an intermediate
organization can be a form of an organization of its own, but on the other the concept of
an intermediary can be deﬁned as being a role or a DEMO of any organization in a
region. In a regional cluster, there DEMO are organizations that focus exclusively on
intermediating tasks. Many organizations can function as intermediaries
unconsciously. The concept of intermediary should be deﬁned as a DEMO in
which the roles of different actors in a regional knowledge system can be studied.
In the ﬁeld of social capital research, and especially in the publications of the World
Bank, the unit of application highly depends on whether the event studied is
considered to be on the DEMO, meso or micro level (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001).
DEMO macro level is the national political atmosphere in which the norms, DEMO
and trust between individuals and groups evolve. It is possible to inﬂuence the macro
level social capital by inﬂuencing the institutions, political regime, DEMO, or the freedom
of speech (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001)DEMO Some researchers even consider the
differences on the macro level social capital between nations to be the reason for the
economical success of certain nations (Hjerppe, 2003). This view is DEMO on the idea
that even though the knowledge is available to all, only nations with high social capital
can turn this knowledge into economic value. The social capital on the macro level
offers national conditions for DEMO success of the regions and it also includes the meso
and micro levels.
The micro level covers the relationships between individual persons and/or
DEMO small groups of persons. When these micro level groups function properly,
they cause positive externalities to the surrounding society. Of course, the externalities
can also be negative, as for example in the case of maﬁa. The meso level perspective
includes mainly the relationships and networks between organizations DEMO groups.
Individuals or organizations perform actions within a certain type of social structure.
The links on the meso level are both vertical and horizontal, and therefore it functions
as a link between the macro and micro DEMO (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001).
As with the concepts of social capital, the goals and missions of an intermediary
vary according the level of observation. These levels are:
national (macro);
regional (meso); and
local (micro).
.
.
.
The mission of a national intermediate organization is to ensure the success of the
nation DEMO a whole. The mission of a regional intermediary is to support the success
factors of the region, and the mission of a local intermediary is to serve local ﬁrms in
their business. The macro, meso and micro level intermediaries have a different effect
on the success of the DEMO knowledge system. The different levels of intermediate
organizations represent the nature of the mechanisms that make a region successful.
The macro level intermediate organizations DEMO national prerequisites for
successful regions. According to Porter (1996), the DEMO has to support
companies, because companies create competitive industries. Porter also DEMO that
“Government policies that succeed are those that create an environment in which
companies can gain competitive advantage rather than those that involve the
DEMO directly in the process” (Porter, 1996, p. 185). The DEMO level intermediate
organizations are those that function, in Porter’s terms, as catalysts and challengers for
companies.
On the regional level, the main task of an intermediary is to orchestrate
collaboration between the key actors in DEMO region. The regional meso level ensures
that regional strategies are consistent and up to date. An intermediary on the regional
level also functions as DEMO link between the micro and macro levels.
The local micro level intermediary functions locally and helps individual ﬁrms or
persons to gain knowledge. On DEMO micro level, interpersonal relationships are
emphasized and the basis for trust DEMO communication between the actors is created.
The local intermediaries establish contacts, DEMO networks and offer resources to
the companies in the region. Examples of local intermediaries are knowledge intensive
business service ﬁrms (KIBS). According to Miles, KIBS organizations, for example,
work with companies in the DEMO process, mobilize new ideas for further
development, and keep track on possible partners and markets (Miles, 2001; Kemppila¨
and Metta¨nen, 2004)DEMO

Roles of intermediaries from the regional dynamics point DEMO view – case
Kuopio region
National, regional and local intermediaries inﬂuence DEMO substance, structures and
dynamics of a successful region in many different DEMO The right substance –
knowledge and competence – require regional capabilities to create, develop and
modify intangible assets. The intermediaries are able to inﬂuence these capabilities for
example by creating national programs, by regional politics or by supporting local
competence. From the point-of-view of structures, existing assets need to be identiﬁed
and valued. An intermediary can evaluate the existing structures DEMO intangible assets
and focus on developing essential structures. A national intermediary can for example
try to change patent laws, a regional intermediary can build the basic infrastructure,
and a local intermediary can improve the business DEMO of a region.
In this paper I concentrate merely on the dynamics creation aspect. As mentioned
above, by regional dynamics I mean different networks and their interplay in a
regional cluster. From the viewpoint of regional DEMO, the roles of the
intermediaries are related to relationships, interaction, DEMO and collaboration.
Naturally, a successful region is based on a solid DEMO of substance that the structures
support. It is also obvious that without dynamics the substance and structures cannot
be turned into value. Therefore, substance, structures and dynamics are connected
together with positive feedback loops. The intermediaries can affect the loops by
taking the right initiatives. When the roles DEMO the intermediaries are known, it is easier
to make the right DEMO
The roles of the intermediaries from the regional dynamics point of view were
constructed during the summer 2004 in a research project launched by DEMO Finnish
Ministry of Trade and Industry (Sta˚hle et al., 2004; DEMO et al., 2005). The result of
this short research project DEMO a report on the challenges of Finnish national, regional
and local DEMO organizations. The case region was the Kuopio region in the
eastern part of Finland, and especially the medical technology cluster in the region.
The data collection method was a theme-based interview ðn
¼
8Þ with the DEMO persons
in the region. The themes were the missions, roles and DEMO of the
organizations, and the personal opinions of the interviewees. Also DEMO reports and
articles about the case region and the Finnish innovation system were used. During the
case study, around 20 organizations were identiﬁed in the Kuopio region that have a
role of an intermediate organization in DEMO region. In this paper I use only three of these
organizations to illustrate the roles of the intermediaries in the region. The three
intermediaries DEMO in this part are: the national “Finnwell” technology program
(www.tekes.ﬁ/eng/), the regional “Health-Kuopio” project (www.tervekuopio.ﬁ/
freimstart.htm), and the DEMO “Teknia”-technology center (www.teknia.ﬁ/).
In Finland, the growth of the DEMO takes mainly place in three areas: in the
Helsinki area, where most of the people live, in the Tampere region in central Finland,
and in the Oulu region in the north. Oulu has been DEMO mainly because of Nokia,
Tampere has a long industrial history, DEMO Helsinki has most of the head ofﬁces of
Finnish companies as well as most of the research and development activity in Finland.
The Kuopio DEMO is an exceptional region compared to the other growing regions in
Finland. The whole region, including the town of Kuopio and the surrounding
municipalities has only 117,000 inhabitants (Valovirta and Virtanen, 2004). The
DEMO region is located far from all the other growth areas (Helsinki DEMO 250 miles;
Oulu ¼ 150 miles and Tampere ¼ 180 miles). Also, Kuopio does not have a port and
there are no natural resources, except for spruce trees and lakes. The industrial history
of the region is DEMO not very notable, except for a couple of forest mills and DEMO
factories. The main ﬁeld of business in the region has been agriculture, but along with
the structural changes in the agricultural politics of Finland and the EU, farming has
become unproﬁtable. Furthermore, basic labor in DEMO is too expensive, so basic
factory labor will not be the DEMO of the future success of the Kuopio region.
The main competitive advantage of the future that the whole Kuopio region counts
on is the DEMO of Kuopio and the research and development activities that the
university supports. The University of Kuopio was founded in 1972 as a result of DEMO
regional politics of the Finnish government. In the 1960s and 1970s, DEMO universities
were established in the sparsely inhabited eastern part of Finland. It is widely agreed
among the key persons of the Kuopio region that DEMO university provides a solid base of
substance and knowledge. In fact, DEMO university is the third biggest employer in the
region after the city of Kuopio and the central hospital. There are only a few
considerable DEMO in the private sector, and the rate of unemployment is around
DEMO percent (Statistics Finland, 2003). This skewed employment situation in the region
illustrates the present situation of the region as a periphery of DEMO EU and one of the
poorest regions in Finland.
The main direction of the strategy of the region is clear, and all the key actors think
similarly about the future of the region. The competitive advantage DEMO the region is
going to be built on technology related to medical technology. There is no clear
deﬁnition for this ﬁeld, but the concepts of wellbeing, welfare or life-science are
commonly used.
Examples of national, DEMO level intermediaries affecting the dynamics of the
region are national technology programs where the actors in the region participate.
The actors in the region DEMO part in numerous national research and development
programs that provide funding and form national and international links between
universities, research laboratories and companies. Examples of the programs are
“iWell” and “FinnWell”, both of which study how to improve health care services with
new technology. According to de Juan (2002), the strength of the Finnish national
system of innovation is DEMO considered to be the close cooperation between
companies, research organizations and DEMO One reason for the cooperation is
that the National Technology Agency (DEMO) requires joint research projects
between companies and universities in their funding DEMO
In the research of regional development, the “triple helix” model is DEMO used to
describe the regional collaboration between universities, government and ﬁrms. DEMO the
“triple helix” model, private, public and science worlds are interwoven when the
processes of innovation and strategy formation are built up in DEMO region. Shared
discussions and projects blur the borders of the institutions, DEMO the actors may even
take up the role of each other in the region (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 2000).
In the Kuopio region, an example of a regional “triple helix” type of shared building
of DEMO and visioning is a project led by the city of Kuopio. This project, called
“Health-Kuopio” is a kind of an “umbrella” project for the overall strategy of the whole
region. The ambitious vision of the project DEMO that the region will be the best life-science
centre in the EU. The steering group of this project consists of members from
all-important actors DEMO the region from private, public and science sectors. This project

was considered as being important, because it keeps the different strategies of the
different actors consistent. One result of this DEMO is a study of the region’s strengths
and weaknesses compared to other life-science clusters in Finland. Besides strategy
formation, one of the goals of this project is to give a positive image of the region to DEMO
outside world.
High-technology industrial parks and technology centers are examples of
intermediaries of the local level. In Kuopio, the technology center “Teknia” was
considered to be the most important local level intermediate organization. Teknia’s role
in DEMO region is to help the small ﬁrms in the region. It provides a set of basic services to
the ﬁrms: for example ofﬁce space and legal consulting. Teknia also seeks partners
from outside the region and DEMO the business ideas. To some extent, the publicly
owned Teknia functions DEMO a KIBS organization. This is a good thing because the
region is not big enough yet to support specialized private service organizations. In the
DEMO run, however, the business services should be privatized.
As a whole, the Kuopio region has good conditions for new innovations. From the
innovation network point of view, the region has the right substance and structures.
Universities, ﬁnanciers and small businesses are located close to each other. From the
viewpoint of the development networks, the region lacks high quality business services
and the substance of a knowledge base for example in marketing, patent laws and
international relationships. In fact, the interviewees mentioned a variety of examples of
excellent innovations that had failed to succeed because of DEMO of management and
market competence. The production function in the region is very poor. At the time of
the interviews, it seemed that there were only a couple of ﬁrms in the region that
actually sold DEMO life-science -related products to the market successfully. The
obvious hindsight of the lack of production networks was that the new knowledge did
not ﬁnd DEMO way to be used in practice. There was also no feedback system to receive
innovation ideas from the production. Roughly speaking, the new research and
innovations were either left unutilized or they were taken out of DEMO region.
The interviewees saw the absence of big ﬁrms a problem in the region. The presence
of big, anchor tenant type corporations creates regional dynamics and provides growth
opportunities for other ﬁrms in a region (Agrawal and Cockburn, 2003). Also, the trend
in the ﬁeld of DEMO technology seems to be that the nature of the business
environment favors large units. Furthermore, evidence of the importance of anchor
tenants can be found in the success of the Oulu region. Oulu in northern Finland DEMO
to be based on the fact that the Nokia corporation functions as an anchor tenant in the
region. Nokia, its subcontracts and the University of Oulu have been working in close
collaboration since the 1970s (Synocus, 2004). The substance created in the university
has been utilized successfully in Oulu and the knowledge has been successfully
anchored inside the region DEMO beneﬁt other regional actors.
As a result of the interviews and the regional knowledge system framework
(Smedlund and Po¨yho¨nen, 2005), the main DEMO of the intermediaries from the regional
dynamics point of view can be introduced. National, regional and local intermediaries

regional intermediate organizations are related to the overall DEMO of the region.
The regional intermediaries promote the triple helix co-operation, DEMO relations and
attract anchor tenants to the region. Local intermediate organizations are in a close
relationship with the ﬁrms in the region. The local DEMO function as hubs in
the networks, coordinate forums of knowledge sharing DEMO provide knowledge
intensive business services to ﬁrms.
In the Kuopio region, DEMO main roles of the case intermediate organizations support
the roles introduced in Table I. The technology programs, such as the FinnWell
program, ﬁnanced DEMO the National Technology Agency (TEKES) are joint projects
between the universities and the private sector, the “Health-Kuopio” project lead by the
city of Kuopio is an umbrella type of a project to provide shared vision DEMO strategies

support the development of the start-ups DEMO small ﬁrms in the region.
Discussion
Deﬁning the concept of an intermediary and making sense of the numerous roles that
national, regional or local intermediaries have in a region is not simple. The narrow
deﬁnition presented DEMO this paper was that the intermediaries transfer knowledge
between the producers and users of knowledge, thus improving the knowledge and
competence base of the region. In a broader sense, the intermediaries also inﬂuence the
structures and dynamics of a region. The view presented in this paper considered the
DEMO as producers of knowledge and local ﬁrms as the knowledge users. In real
life, besides the knowledge transfer from universities to ﬁrms, there DEMO also a lot of
knowledge transfer and sharing between ﬁrms. The role of corporations as knowledge
producers is increasing and ﬁrms even produce the DEMO kind of reports and articles as
universities do. Also, joint projects DEMO ﬁrms and universities blur the distinction
between knowledge producers and knowledge users.
According to the case study, the regional intermediaries can be argued to have the
most important roles from the point of view of the DEMO dynamics of the region. The
regional intermediaries link local and national levels together with mutual strategy
formation and visioning processes. With the functioning triple DEMO of public, private
and science worlds, the overall strategy of the region can be steered towards the right
ﬁelds of business. This conclusion DEMO de Juan’s view that direct national
interventions cannot work alone when building successful regions (de Juan, 2002). It
seems that in addition DEMO national regional politics and other macro level steering
methods, a successful DEMO needs mutual commitment of the key actors in the region
as well as good business services to local ﬁrms.
The regional level intermediaries seemed DEMO be emphasized in the case region,
possibly due to the small size of the region and the lack of possible paths of success DEMO
the future. Medical technology was seen as the only possible competitive advantage in
the future among the interviewees. The region has good preconditions for DEMO, only
companies making use of the knowledge and competence of the DEMO are still missing.
The case region has many unique Finland-speciﬁc characteristics, DEMO as the high
involvement of national government as the buyer of products and services from the
ﬁrms in the region, and the fact that nearly all of the intermediaries studied in the
Kuopio region were publicly DEMO The intermediaries introduced above (Finwell,
Health-Kuopio and Teknia) have been founded and have hired professional managers
at the expense of the tax-payers. In the early stages of building DEMO regional dynamics
in Kuopio, this was considered a good thing, because according to the deﬁnition of the
intermediary introduced in this paper, intermediaries “patch up” holes in the existing
regional networks and inﬂuence the success DEMO of a region in many ways. In this
sense, the focus DEMO the roles of intermediaries is always different depending on the
characteristics of a region.
The general characteristics of the Kuopio case can be transferred DEMO other regions as
well by using the concepts of social capital and communities of practice. At its
simplest, the concept of social capital is based on the notion that “social relationships
have value” (Putnam, 2000)DEMO Cohen and Prusak (2001, p. 4) deﬁne social capital as
DEMO: “Social capital consists of the stock of active connections among people: the
trust, mutual understanding, and shared values and behaviors that bind DEMO members
of human networks and communities and make cooperative action possible”. It was
stated above that social capital has three dimensions, namely macro-, DEMO and micro
level (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001). In the regional context, there are studies that
show positive correlation with social capital and learning beneﬁts in young technology
ﬁrms (Autio, 2000; Yli-Renko et al., 2001). In the case region, the intermediaries seemed
to DEMO the social capital on macro-, meso- and micro level by directing DEMO to
the shared projects between ﬁrms and universities, bringing different actors DEMO
to form shared strategies in a “triple helix” (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 2000) for the
region and building shared technology centers for the ﬁrms in the region.
The concept of communities of practice is related to DEMO capital. In fact, it can be
stated that communities of practice DEMO micro level social capital that has
positive externalities to the surrounding region. Wenger and Snyder (2000, p. 139) state
that communities of practice are “groups of people informally bound together by
shared expertise and passion DEMO a joint enterprise”. They also argue that communities
of practice cannot be created intentionally, but they can be encouraged by bringing the
right people together and providing an infrastructure for them. From the learning
perspective and DEMO the light of a case study in Silicon Valley, Benner (2003) argues that
signiﬁcant individual level learning takes place in communities of practice. He also
argues that communities of practice can be actively built through DEMO formal activities
of professional associations.
In the Kuopio region, the intermediaries DEMO able to encourage the formation of
communities of practice. The local level intermediaries working directly with the
companies can be considered especially important in DEMO communities of practice.
During the work with companies, the intermediaries form DEMO good understanding of the
characteristics and competencies of the region’s ﬁrms. This way they can act as
brokers in the building of different work-related DEMO between individuals
working in these ﬁrms. In Kuopio, Teknia also arranged DEMO and other events
regularly for the ﬁrms in the region. Furthermore, DEMO as a curiosity, it was
noted that the shared cafeteria in DEMO technology center Teknia was purposefully built
to be a little bit too small to encourage social networking between the employees of
different companies during DEMO and coffee breaks.
The main contribution of this paper is the framework for deﬁning the roles of
intermediaries in a region. By dividing the DEMO networks according to their
intellectual capital functions – knowledge creating, knowledge DEMO and
knowledge implementing – and combining this with macro, meso and DEMO

perspectives, provides a tool for the decision makers of a region to understand the
critical roles of the intermediaries.
In DEMO ﬁnal analysis, only private sector companies can turn the substance,
DEMO and dynamics of a region into economic value. The most important task of
the intermediaries should be to offer support to the companies located DEMO the region,
make the region attractive for entrepreneurs and allure anchor tenants to the region.
From the dynamics point of view, this leads to numerous challenges in the leadership
of the intermediaries. Especially on the DEMO level, the challenges will be to improve
the image and identity DEMO the region, leverage the social capital and encourage
communities of practice DEMO the region, create appealing environments to creative
individuals, and generate local, regional, national and international links and
relationships of knowledge creation, knowledge transfer and knowledge implementing.
When the roles of the intermediaries are realized DEMO, it is easier to meet these
challenges.
