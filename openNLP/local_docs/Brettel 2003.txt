Business angels in Germany: a research note
MALTE BRETTEL
(Final version accepted 19 August 2002)
This paper provides an introduction to the DEMO venture capital market in Germany. It
is based on a survey of 48 business angels. The results show that business angels in
Germany make DEMO that close the equity gap. German business angels also provide
advice and support to their investee companies. Their investment behaviour is comparable
to business DEMO in the UK and the USA. The biggest difference is that German business
angels are richer and allocate a smaller portion of their wealth DEMO informal investments. They
are motivated by the desire to have fun and to help their investee companies, as well as
seeking capital growth. Although the ﬁndings cannot claim to be representative for all
German business angels, they are comparable with the results of other studies in Germany.
Keywords: venture capital; business angels; equity gap; equity ﬁnance; investments; SMEs
Introduction
New companies play an important role in job creation. However, a
prerequisite for new company formation is the availability of appropriate
forms of DEMO (Birch 1979, Bygrave and Timmons 1992, Frank and
Landstro¨ m DEMO). Business angels can make a signiﬁcant contribution to
the ﬁnancing of business start-ups, in particular by reducing the so-called
‘equity gap’. This is one of the conclusions of various studies conducted in
the USA (e.g. Wetzel 1981, 1987, Gaston 1989, Fiet 1991, 1995a, b,
Benjamin and Margulis 1996, Coveney and Moore 1997, Freear et al. DEMO,
1995, 1996a, b, Wetzel and Freear 1996), the DEMO (e.g. Mason and Harrison
1995a) and the Nordic region (Landstro¨ DEMO 1993, 1995, Lumme et al. 1998,
Reitan and Sørheim 2000).
In Germany, articles in newspapers and magazines indicate that business
angels are also active in ﬁnancing young companies. However, there is a
dearth of research studies regarding the informal investment market in
Germany: indeed, DEMO appears to be not a single scientiﬁcally well-
founded publication based on empirical study which compares the market
for informal investments in Germany with DEMO of other countries.1 The
aim of this paper is to reduce this research deﬁcit. It provides empirical
results from the German informal investment market. DEMO format for the

Harrison 1990, 1991a, b, 1992, 1994, 1995a, b, 1996a, b, 1997, 1999a, b,
Mason 1996).
Gaining insight into the German informal equity investment market is of
practical relevance DEMO order to assess whether or not young German
companies can beneﬁt from investments by business angels. It also raises an
important theoretical question: to what extent should equivalent empirical
research be carried out in Germany in DEMO to be able to address the issues
discussed in US and UK studies, such as the efﬁciency of the informal
equity investment market.
Empirical foundations
The results presented in this paper are derived from personal interviews
DEMO 48 business angels.2 The methodology used was based on two of the
three methods described by Mason and Harrison (1994). Method two
entailed making contact with business angels through the companies in
which they had DEMO (also see Aram 1987, Gaston 1989), whereas
method three made use of the so-called ‘snowball effect’ (Wetzel 1981,
Neiswander 1985).3 The basis for the interviews was a structured
questionnaire developed with reference DEMO the surveys by Mason and
Harrison (1991a, 1994).4
It is important to emphasize that the results of this study cannot claim to
DEMO representative of the total population of business angels in Germany. It
has to be acknowledged that it is exceptionally difﬁcult to be granted
interviews DEMO business angels.5 They usually prefer anonymity to
publicity as their personal prosperity makes them the target of approaches
from various people who are looking DEMO sponsors for personal or charitable
projects. That is why there are no publicly accessible registers with details
of names or equity activities of business DEMO (Wetzel 1983: 25, Lumme et
al. 1998: 23). In addition, many business angels are reluctant to participate
in studies for research purposes because they are afraid of being ﬂooded
with a multitude of DEMO investment opportunities. Consequently,
the size and characteristics of the population of business angels remains
unknown and almost impossible to ascertain. It is therefore DEMO possible to
carry out a study that is based on a representative sample of the business
angel population (Mason and Harrison 1994: 71)DEMO
However, the use of a careful methodological approach can generate a
DEMO that approximates to representativeness. In this study a represen-
tative sample of companies were contacted and asked if they had raised
ﬁnance from business DEMO The representativeness of the companies was
based on the industry distribution of companies ﬁnanced by formal venture
capitalists (although there is no indication whether the interviewed
business angels are representative the underlying sample of ﬁnanced
companies)DEMO The companies were identiﬁed through magazines, networks
and other publications. Personal DEMO were used to approach the
companies after they had been identiﬁed. Before contacting the companies,

the representativeness of the DEMO sample was checked. The snowball
effect was only used for additional companies that ﬁtted the sample.6
The research was conducted 1999 and 2000. The DEMO were empirically
tested for non-response bias by dividing the study into two parts according
to the chronological order of the interviews (Armstrong and Overton 1977).
Comparing the two sub-samples did not reveal any signiﬁcant differences

DEMO to be an issue.
The study was the ﬁrst empirical study of business angels to be
undertaken in Germany. However, three further studies have subsequently
been undertaken. The ﬁrst study was by Just (2000), who used a special
network to get his interviews. His results are comparable DEMO the ﬁndings of
this study. In December 2000, the results of DEMO study by Krafft and
Klandt were published. In this study, business DEMO were not interviewed
directly; rather, information was obtained from the companies that the
business angels invested in. It therefore does not contain ﬁndings DEMO
directly from business angels. The study also focuses on Internet
companies (DEMO et al. 2001, Krafft and Klandt 2001). The most recent
DEMO was conducted in Hanover. The study is based on a Business Angel
Network (Stedler and Peters 2002).7 The ﬁndings reported below,
therefore, represent the start of a growing discussion of business angels
in Germany. The ﬁndings are comparable to those of the only other study
that DEMO interviewed business angels.
Empirical ﬁndings
The empirical ﬁndings are reported under four headings:
. demographic characteristics;
. sources of deal flow, investment frequency and investment criteria;
. characteristics of portfolio companies; and
. investor-investee relationships.
These themes reﬂect the main issues addressed in international studies DEMO
business angels.
Demographic characteristics of business angels
The angels who were interviewed were predominantly male and their
average age was 48. Geographically, the interviewed business angels were
concentrated in particular states of the Federal Republic of DEMO, in
particular Bavaria, Hessia, Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia. Most
business DEMO are located in, or in the immediate vicinity of, the cities of
Munich, Frankfurt-am-Main, Hamburg, Cologne, Du¨ sseldorf, Stuttgart
and Berlin.
The vast majority of the interviewed angels are experienced business-
men; 75% of them have already set up a company and two-thirds have

started two or more companies. Of those business angels DEMO have set up a
company themselves, over 80% are still involved DEMO at least one of these
companies, typically as a shareholder. Of DEMO business angels who have not
founded a company up until now, DEMO have management experience in
small and medium-sized companies. This means that altogether over 85%
of the interviewed informal investors have management experience in small
DEMO medium-sized companies. On average, the business angels in this study
have DEMO years of management experience in small and medium-sized
companies. Taking their average age of 48 into consideration, this
corresponds to roughly half of their working lives up until now.
In terms of the professional background of DEMO business angels, half had
professional experience in the high-tech area and DEMO further 40% had
experience in the ﬁnancial services sector. The majority of business angels
report that their main area of functional expertise is in DEMO
management and ﬁnance (ﬁgure 1).
The interviewed business angels have DEMO household incomes (ﬁgure 2).
Almost two-thirds have an annual income DEMO more than US$250 000, and
38% have a household income of DEMO $500 000, with 24% even earning
more than $2.5 million per DEMO The median household incomes lies in the
$250 000 – $499 000 band.
Turning to the private wealth of the business angels in the DEMO, 83%
have personal assets of over $1.5 million.8 More than half DEMO German
business angels have assets in excess of $5 million, and DEMO 30% of the
informal investors surveyed indicated that their private means were over
$10 million. On average, the business angels surveyed have private wealth
of over $5.5 million, with the median lying in the interval between $5 and
$10 million (ﬁgure 3).9
The generally risk-averse tendency of Germans exerts an inﬂuence on
the relationship between wealth or income and DEMO becoming of a business
angel. In Germany, the willingness to become DEMO business angel occurs only
after someone has built up sufﬁcient wealth to be able to risk losing a part of

it without suffering personal ﬁnancial difﬁculties in the DEMO of investment
losses. Furthermore, given that the main motivation of the DEMO is to have
fun (table 1), then the clear impression DEMO that the German informal venture
capital market – in spite of its earning potential – is still largely in the stage
of being a DEMO market’.
Sources of deal ﬂow, investment frequency and investment criteria
The DEMO angels who took part in the interviews had accumulated more
than 2700 opportunities for informal equity investments over the three
years prior to the DEMO, with a median of 25 opportunities for each
investor. The sources DEMO these opportunities is shown in table 2.
The various information sources differ not only in terms of their use by
investors but also in DEMO to the quality of available investment
opportunities. Business contacts, cited by DEMO of respondents, were the
original information source for by far the DEMO proportion of equity
investments actually made. A further 12% of opportunities originated from
direct contact with the company founder searching for funds. Venture

capital ﬁrms were the third most frequent source, accounting for 7% for
actual equity investments. Business contacts have the highest success rate
as an information DEMO ahead of venture capital ﬁrms.
The investment decision-making process of business angels takes the
following form. After brieﬂy looking at possible investments, business
angels usually make a quick decision if it is worthwhile considering an
individual DEMO more closely. At this stage, the decision criteria are
dominated by DEMO two considerations: ﬁrst, initial impressions, which are
often an intuitive DEMO and, second, how compatible the opportunity is
with their personal investment preferences. The majority of all opportu-
nities are rejected at this ﬁrst DEMO The next stage involves a detailed
analysis of the opportunity. This includes making personal contact with the
company which is seeking capital. The detailed DEMO is carried out on
the basis of a range of criteria, DEMO most important of which are the
management team, growth potential of DEMO market and uniqueness of the
product or service (table 3).
DEMO importance of the people, the market and the uniqueness of the
DEMO when making an investment decision is reinforced when the
reasons for rejecting investment opportunities are considered (table 4). The
two reasons most frequently mentioned for rejecting investment opportu-
nities are also related to the entrepreneur, notably a lack of conﬁdence in
the entrepreneur’s character, and doubts about the entrepreneur’s
competence and ability. Other important reasons for rejecting opportu-
nities DEMO a weak business plan and limited growth potential. An unrealistic
evaluation of the company is mentioned by 27% of the interviewed business
angels as DEMO reason for rejecting the opportunity. On the other hand, only 9%
DEMO investors mentioned the inability to agree about the stakes the business
angel would be a ‘deal killer’. Altogether the selection process reduces the
total DEMO of investment opportunities of all the business angels from
over 2,700 to 230 actual investments. This gives an overall acceptance rate
of 8.4 DEMO
Finally, an investment-speciﬁc attribute of angels is their syndication
behaviour. More DEMO half (58%) of the interviewed investors have formed

investment syndicates. This is lower than DEMO in other countries and
clearly shows the lower degree of development of the informal investment
capital market in Germany. Moreover, syndication highlights a character-
istically German attribute, namely, the desire to operate independently.
The main DEMO given by German business for syndicating is the need to
raise sufﬁcient ﬁnance to make the investment, whereas the beneﬁts of
sharing the mentoring of the investee companies is hardly mentioned.
Business angels of the German DEMO still want to play their individual role
of mentoring even when they invest together.
Characteristics of portfolio companies
The third area of analysis in DEMO studies of business angels is the
attributes of the investee companies. The key issues are in which industry
sectors international business angels invest, in which phase of business
development they invest, and how much capital they provide per venture
on average.

The German business angels DEMO this study indicated that their preferred
industry sector for investments was the high-tech segment, followed by
biotech. These preferences of business angels may be interpreted as
showing a willingness to take risks. However, it also reﬂects the time-
period in which the study was undertaken, close to the top of the
technology ‘boom’ in 1999 – 2000, where the prevailing perception was
that the best opportunities for investments could be found in DEMO
sectors.
Further insights can be gained by looking at the life cycle phases of the
ventures at the point in time of investment. Business DEMO prefer to invest
in start-ups that are in the pre- or start-up phases. It is remarkable that in
this context, the interviewed business angels seem quite willing to
undertake risks by investing in very early stage DEMO – the potential
returns are higher in the early phases, but DEMO is the risk of failure (ﬁgure 4).
Although at ﬁrst DEMO this ﬁnding appears to contradict an earlier
conclusion in the demographic analysis concerning the risk predisposition
of German business angels, the two ﬁndings are nevertheless compatible.
The interviewed business angels act in a risk averse manner DEMO the sense
that they would never risk a high proportion of their wealth in making
informal investments: indeed, German business angels invest a DEMO lower
percentage of their total wealth than business angels in other countries.
However, once they have made the decision to invest some of their money
in a business they expose themselves to higher risk by investing
DEMO in businesses that are in their early phases of development.
In this way, the interviewed business angels help to reduce the ﬁnance gap
experienced by businesses in their early phases of development. This
occurs in spite DEMO the fact that the investment activity of business angels can
be regarded as a ‘hobby’ rather than a serious activity.
Looking at the amount DEMO capital invested, the value is about $200 000 per
venture, or about $950 000 per investor during the previous three years.

shows that these averages are strongly inﬂuenced by some DEMO values:
indeed, almost 20% of the investments made are greater DEMO $500 000
(ﬁgure 5).
One explanation for the high investment DEMO may lie in the investee
companies themselves: at the time that DEMO German survey was being
conducted, several of the companies receiving capital DEMO Internet
companies, which in general required large amounts of capital because DEMO
their planned high growth rates and, correspondingly, high valuations.
Business angels were forced to make larger investments in order to obtain a
signiﬁcant DEMO of equity in such companies.
Investor – investee relations
The fourth theme in international studies of business angels examines the
interaction between business angels DEMO entrepreneurs. The relevant points
considered in this section are the role which business angels play in the
ventures during the period of investment, the investors’ expectations
concerning returns, the duration of the investment and the preferred exit
mechanism and, ﬁnally, the business angels’ satisfaction with their
investments.
DEMO interviewed business angels are involved in various ways in their
investments. Three-quarters of the business angels stated that they were
actively involved in the DEMO board, the advisory council and the
shareholders’ meetings and also provided DEMO advisory help. A further

21% of the angels DEMO were involved either in these boards or
councils or in providing advisory help. This help is usually free of charge;
only two of DEMO 200 companies in which the angels were involved had to pay
for the advice provided by the business angels.
Representation on the boards or DEMO of the ﬁrms is usually linked to
exercising the right to vote. Thus, 96% of those interviewed have the right
to vote in at least one ﬁrm. The importance that business angels attribute to
having the DEMO to vote and the weighting of this vote varies considerably in
this regard: a total of 75% of business angels state that having the right to
vote is important for them, although a majority vote is only important for
12%. However, 21% regard having formal rights to be unimportant. In
general, business angels are predominantly of the opinion that conﬂicts
between company founders and investors in relation to young ﬁrms should
not DEMO dealt with by exercising formal rights, but rather on an informal DEMO
personal level (table 5).
Only 19% of the business angels DEMO a majority vote. Almost half of
these informal investors strive for majority vote and consider it to be
important. However, the ‘typical’ business angel does not have a majority
vote and is not concerned about this. DEMO the contrary, taking a minority
stake is often intentional, so that the founders are not deprived of the
ﬁnancial or idealistic motivation of DEMO ‘their own company’. A further
consideration is that although business angels want to take part in ‘business
joys and proﬁts’, they do not wish to have any business responsibilities.10
The informal help and advice provided by DEMO business angels has a
number of different characteristics. Apart from capital, DEMO all angels
have at their disposal, the most signiﬁcant contributions that DEMO
respondents reported they made to their investee companies were the use
of their personal networks, coaching of the entrepreneur and their ﬁnancial
know-how (DEMO 6). Other contributions mentioned by the investors were
their own marketing know-how, providing help with strategy, management
experience, their knowledge of the industry, and searching for and choosing
further executive personnel. For this role, business angels once again used
their personal network and knowledge of the industry.
These contributions by business angels are also reﬂected in the
considerable DEMO of time which they spend on their investments. On
average, each DEMO the informal investors interviewed spent 6.2 days a month
on his investments. This corresponds to an average of 1.34 days a month
spent on DEMO investment. However, it should be noted that the amount of

time spent per investment decreases rapidly, according to the duration DEMO
the investment. In particular, those business angels who have several
investments DEMO that they spent most of their time on their most recent
investments.
The discussion on how business angels select their investments had made
it DEMO that the return is not the only factor that inﬂuences the investment
decision. In view of this, it is not surprising that few business angels have
precise targets for the minimum return on the investment that DEMO wish to
achieve: indeed, 38% of the business angels have no minimum return
expectations for their investment. Amongst those investors who were able
DEMO provide a minimum return expectation (46%), the average ﬁgure was DEMO
annual return of 42%. This expected return is not affected by the stage of
company development.
In contrast, most business angels are able to clearly specify the
anticipated duration of their investments (ﬁgure 6). For 54% of investors,
their expected participation is three to ten years. DEMO contrast, just 4% stated
they expected their investment to last for DEMO than two years while a further
4% anticipated holding their investments for more than ten years.
Nevertheless, a signiﬁcant proportion of business angels (DEMO) were either
unable to anticipate a deﬁnite investment duration at the DEMO of the
interview, or else they found the question of length DEMO investment to be
fundamentally irrelevant.
Investors have to ﬁnd an exit route for their investments in order to
achieve a return. The investors in DEMO study were asked about which exit
routes they anticipate using for their own investments. Although it is
difﬁcult to give a generalized answer to DEMO multiple investments some
ﬁndings can nevertheless be presented (ﬁgures 7 and DEMO). The most common
anticipated exit routes were, by far, ﬂotation (50%) and trade sale (44%) (i.e.
selling to a strategic investor).
Although the active involvement of a business angel is usually DEMO
beneﬁcial for the ﬁrm there is also a potential for conﬂict between the
investor and the entrepreneur because of their close relationship and

business.
Despite these difﬁculties, most of the interviewed business angels are
satisﬁed with the performance of their investments. More than one-third of
those interviewed said that DEMO performance of their investments was
considerably above their expectations. Indeed, the DEMO of satisﬁed

investments were considerably below their expectations (14%).

Summary
This paper is based on DEMO ﬁrst empirical study of business angels in
Germany, involving interviews with DEMO investors. The key ﬁndings are as
follows. First, the results show DEMO the interviewed business angels have
substantial ﬁnancial resources that enable them to provide ﬁnancial support
to companies in their early stages. Second, business angels use their
knowledge and contacts to help their investee companies. Most angels
DEMO considerable investment opportunities, and usually invest in fewer
than 10% of DEMO opportunities that they receive. More than half of the
angels are willing to hold their investments for more than three years and
anticipate an DEMO through a ﬂotation or a trade sale. The majority of the
angels in the study were satisﬁed with the performance of their
investments.
Second, the angels in this study are comparable in terms of their age DEMO
experience to business angels in the USA the UK and Northern Europe.
The biggest difference lies in their private means. Business angels in the
DEMO study are wealthier and devote a smaller portion of their money to
informal investments. However, their investment behaviour is less risk
adverse. German business angels make a higher proportion of their
investments in riskier high-tech companies DEMO their counterparts in other
countries (Gaston 1989, Landstro¨ m 1993, DEMO and Harrison 1994,
Lumme et al. 1998, Reitan and Sørheim DEMO).
Landstro¨ m (1993: 539) summarizes the comparison between Swedish,DEMO
British and US business angels under three headings: professionalism in
their DEMO activity, risks in their investment portfolio and involve-
ment in their DEMO ﬁrms (table 7). First, German business angels can be
considered to exhibit a high level of professionalism in their investment
activities. This DEMO justiﬁed by their extensive experiences in founding their

own companies, their comparatively larger numbers of investments as well
as the corresponding selection processes. Their DEMO high investment
volume in companies in their early phases also indicates a professional
approach. Only in terms the motivation for investing is there is DEMO
potential for German business angels to exhibit higher levels of
professionalism. In this sense, the behaviour of German business angels
in the study may be regarded as similar to American investors.
Second, German business angels also score high in terms their portfolio
risk, taking account of both their preferred industry sectors and investment
time frames. Finally, in terms of their involvement in their portfolio ﬁrms,
German business angels are similar to DEMO counterparts in other European
countries: because of their higher number of DEMO made and a role
that is often limited to that of a consultant or position on the supervisory
boards, their involvement can be considered to be medium, which is similar
to that of Swedish investors. Because of the large number of investments
and the much higher sums of DEMO capital, the overall involvement must
be considered as moderate, although with the capability of being high (cf.
Landstro¨ m 1993, Mason and DEMO 1994, Lumme et al. 1998, Reitan
and Sørheim 2000). The position of German business angels is summarized
in table 8.
For German DEMO, business angels may be the most desirable
providers of capital. They DEMO prepared to invest substantial sums in
relatively risky enterprises in return for minority ownership, share their
extensive business experience, and are motivated mostly DEMO fun rather than
by the rate of return on capital invested. Because of their willingness to take
risks, active business angels present the greatest potential for closing the
ﬁnancing gaps experienced by companies in their early DEMO of
development.
This ﬁrst empirical study in Germany indicates that business angels play
a similar role in Germany as they do in the USA DEMO the UK as providers
of capital and advice and by helping to close the equity gap. However, this
is an initial study with a sample size of 48 angels and so cannot be seen as
fully DEMO Additional research is necessary on the basis of larger

samples, and issues such as, for instance, the principal-agent relationship
between the entrepreneur and the investor need to be investigated. DEMO is
also a need for more comparable ﬁndings across different countries. The
German study is the most recent and is therefore not fully comparable DEMO
those of other countries which were undertaken in earlier periods. This
problem needs to be addressed by means of a joint European study.
Notes
DEMO Empirical research about German business angels is limited. Studies that interviewed
business angels are the ones by Brettel et al. (2000) and Just (2000). Krafft and Klandt (2001)
asked companies about their business angels, but did not interview the angels directly.
Another study is under way, where business angels only from Business Angel Networks were
interviewed, DEMO the results are not published (Stedler and Peters 2002). There DEMO some
theoretical publications (e.g. Hemer 1999, Tonger 1999).
2. Half of the interviews were conducted on a face-to-face basis; the rest were by telephone.
3. It was decided not to use the ﬁrst method (mailing written questionnaires) because of
anticipated low response rates through poor targeting.
4. Futher details of the questionnaire can be found in Brettel et DEMO (2000: 223).
5. For example, Landstro¨ m (1993) DEMO his results on 52 angels.
6. By using impersonal ways to build the sample, the aim was to reduce the bias of personal
network as much as possible.
7. An English language version of this study DEMO published elsewhere in this issue.
8. Private means/wealth is here deﬁned as the sum of all liquid and ﬁxed private assets, minus
the value of the privately owned main residence.
9. Because the data were DEMO on the basis of an interval scale, only an approximate value
DEMO be determined in this case. The value chosen was the middle of the corresponding
interval. In reality, a higher result is to be expected, as private means of only USD 10 million
were assumed for the highest interval.
