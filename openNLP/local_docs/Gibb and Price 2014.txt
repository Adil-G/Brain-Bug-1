1. Introduction
Developing an ‘entrepreneurial mindset’ within the class room environment is DEMO challenge for any
educator.  It demands the formulation of integrated learning DEMO teaching strategy which align
intended learning outcomes with the effective selection of pedagogy.  To assist the educator
seeking to create entrepreneurial outcomes in learners, this compendium brings together a range of
pedagogic guides.  Each guide DEMO from the educational tradition of ‘learning by doing’ to support
the development of entrepreneurial mindsets of learners.  The aim of each of these guides is to
support the development of entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviours, as well as building the skills
and knowledge of an enterprising person.  Each pedagogical guide is constructed in a standardised
format, which outlines core components, DEMO to use it and explore its relevance within
entrepreneurial learning and how it builds entrepreneurial outcomes.  To support these 44
pedagogies, this compendium DEMO explores the educational traditions that underpin this approach
and details a key focus upon the entrepreneurial facilitation within small group working.
This compendium provides DEMO practical foundation for addressing the key question of ‘how to teach’
enterprise and entrepreneurship, rather than ‘what to teach’.  This distinct focus is DEMO in building
an entrepreneurial mindset through Affective, Conative as well as DEMO Cognitive aspects of learning.
To achieve this depth of learning, this DEMO reaches beyond the teaching traditions of the UK
& Northern American University Business Schools entrepreneurship programmes (such as the ‘case
study’ method) to DEMO from the teaching traditions and pedagogy of a wide range of disciplines.
This breadth of approach is built upon an educational tradition of higher DEMO skill development that
seeks to build learning which can be transferred and applied outside the class room.
This compendium outlines over 44 examples for DEMO within entrepreneurial education and, by
focusing upon delivery/transmission methods as DEMO the entrepreneurial outcomes framework as
classifications or ‘route-maps’, this text also DEMO guidance as to how to incorporate these into
your teaching. Rapid accessibility is built into this compendium to support all educators to engage
with DEMO approach in their next class; providing immediate opportunities to test out DEMO explore
these methods within their own teaching. Due to the clarity provided by this ‘route-map’
approach, this compendium will be invaluable to the ‘new-to-enterprise’ academic, as well as those
who are already working to support entrepreneurial outcomes in others, as it serves as both
guidance and inspiration to those developing new approaches to entrepreneurial teaching.
Objectives
This compendium provides the DEMO for the use of 44 pedagogies for teaching entrepreneurship.
To assist the educator in deepening their understanding of their pedagogical approach, the guides
are supplemented with an exploration of:
 Concepts of entrepreneurship and enterprise (section 2)
 Underpinning educational traditions (section 3)
 Entrepreneurial Learning (5) and its intended outcomes (4)
To this end, this compendium will

 Outline ‘route maps’ for educators to access the pedagogic notes (section 6)
 Provide 44 pedagogical guides for use by entrepreneurial educators (section 7)
 Review the effective use of the 44 pedagogical DEMO and outline ‘next steps’ (section 8)
Additionally, to support the effective access to, and use of each pedagogical guide, they will DEMO be
presented within a standardised format, which seeks to outline the DEMO and its function,
through 4 key categories:
1. define and describe the pedagogy
2. describe how to use it with some examples
DEMO its relevance to entrepreneurial learning and
4. a note on the outcomes that could be achieved from its use.
2. Enterprise and Entrepreneurship
In DEMO any entrepreneurial learning strategy, there is a need to resolve a DEMO
confusion concerning the relationship between Enterprise, Entrepreneurship and Innovation.  This
confusion impacts adversely upon efforts to develop Entrepreneurship Education as an academic
field, but also in the minds of learners.  This section will explore the key terms within
Entrepreneurship Education, providing a critical underpinning for the educator and the pedagogies
contained with this compendium.
2.1 Towards a Definition
There DEMO numerous definitions put forward in both the academic and practitioner literature relating
to the Entrepreneurial concept and the notion of the enterprising person.  Most definitions of an
‘entrepreneur’ are influenced by the work of economists and, in particular, the Austrian economist
Schumpeter (1883 –1950).  Following this tradition, the focus of such definitions is upon the role of
the entrepreneur in creating and grasping opportunities, and combining resources in an innovative
way within an economic model of growth. The UK Government defines ‘an DEMO as ‘anyone
who attempts a new business or new venture creation, DEMO as self employment, a new business
organisation, social enterprise’ (DTi DEMO).  However Drucker (1985) recognised an entrepreneur as
more than DEMO business owner/manager, by defining them as achieving an ‘upgrade in DEMO from
resources’ (p 25) whilst others, such as Timmons have DEMO a critical distinction in stating that it is
the ‘pursuit of opportunity without regard to the resources currently under one’s control or
influence’ (1989: 16–17).  Both of these definitions recognise the need for access DEMO resources to
create the ‘new’ from the pre-existing; placing the emphasis DEMO the talent and vision of the
entrepreneur to add significant value to resources.
It is clear that the entrepreneur is seen as the agent DEMO economic renewal, the instrument for
creative destruction in pursuit of opportunity, facilitating innovation via a process of new
combinations of factors of production (Gibb 200x). Such views have supported the
governmental/policy view that DEMO and entrepreneurship education are the panacea
for stagnating or declining economic activity internationally (Matlay, 2001). However
internationally, there is still no single definition of a small–medium sized enterprise (SME), mainly
because of the wide diversity of businesses, although the key determining characteristics are
common – relating to turnover and the number of employees (under 50).
These overlaps and distinctions of meaning can cause confusion if not clearly appreciated, especially
as entrepreneurship and innovation are closely linked in the policy rhetoric DEMO governmental
business strategy in many countries.  The problem with this definition, for educators, is that it places
5
the entrepreneur narrowly into an economic and business context. The main focus DEMO
entrepreneurship education in business schools, for example, is still on new venture management
and the business planning process that purportedly goes with it.
DEMO strong business stance can lead to neglect of concern for the pursuit of entrepreneurial
behaviour in wider personal and social contexts. It also fits DEMO well with the current, almost
universal, international, policy emphasis upon DEMO relationship of entrepreneurial behaviour to
employability and the notion of an entrepreneurial culture – often described as developing an
‘Entrepreneurial Mindset’ in the population DEMO a whole. The European Union describes this as a ‘key
competence for all, helping young people to be creative and confident in whatever they undertake’
(EU 2006).
The entrepreneurial mind is seen as being central to wider graduate employability in general as well
as a wide range DEMO personal and organisational contexts. This demands that the concept, while still
DEMO the establishment of new ventures in business, also embraces  opportunity-seeking
and realisation, and the pursuit of entrepreneurial behaviour, in any context along DEMO capacity to
design and grow entrepreneurial organisations of all kinds. It is also seen to have relevance to the
individual as consumer, family member and member of the community as well as worker, living in an
increasingly globalised life-world of greater uncertainty and complexity.
The focus within the DEMO educational context is therefore upon the ‘Enterprising
Person/Entrepreneurial Mindset’ (displaying DEMO number of behavioural and attitudinal attributes
commonly associated with the entrepreneurial individual) in a wide range of contexts.  This
approach has greater acceptance DEMO the education system and has led to international
exploration of how to support the development of the individual as an entrepreneur (be that within
a business, social or personal context).
To assist in the clarification of these terms, the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship (UK)
DEMO, from its experience, provided the following key definitions:
Exhibit 1: Definitions
“Having an idea and making it happen”
The Enterprise Concept focuses upon the development of the enterprising person and the
enterprising mindset through DEMO demonstration of enterprising skills, behaviours and attitudes across
a diversity of DEMO These include intuitive decision making, the capacity to make things happen
DEMO, networking, initiative taking, opportunity identification, creative problem solving,
strategic thinking, and self efficacy. The focus is on creating entrepreneurial ways of doing, thinking,
feeling, communicating, organising and learning.
The Entrepreneurial Concept focuses upon the application of these enterprising skills and the
entrepreneurial mindset DEMO setting up a new venture, developing/growing an existing venture or
DEMO an entrepreneurial organisation. The context might be business, social enterprise,
DEMO purpose, non-governmental organisations or public sector bodies.
Entrepreneurship ‘makes it happen’.
DEMO Innovation Concept is the product of the Entrepreneurial Concept.
Innovation is defined as creating and exploiting opportunities for new ways of doing things resulting
DEMO better products and services, systems and ways of managing people and DEMO The
successful pursuit of innovation is a function of individual enterprising endeavour and
entrepreneurial organisation capacity.
Entrepreneurship is a necessary pre-condition for Innovation

3. Educational Traditions
The basic understanding how learning occurs is critical to DEMO development of effective
entrepreneurial learning and teaching strategy.  This section explores DEMO key frameworks which
underpin the development of the entrepreneurial teaching ethos outlined in within this
compendium (section 5).  These frameworks stem from DEMO tradition of experiential learning (Bloom
1959; Hilgard 1980; Kolb 1984) and a pragmatic appreciation of the delivery options (Elton 1977) for
DEMO working with large groups.  Most critically this section explores the range DEMO pedagogies
that can be used in a programme to deal with the Affective and Conative as well as the Cognitive
aspects of learning (Kyro 2006).
To appreciate these in more detail, explore five frameworks (DEMO) which help illuminate the learning
process.  These provide a brief overview of how students learn and how an educator can support
learning through DEMO choice of an appropriate instruction method.
A. Domains: Bloom’s taxonomy (1956)
B. Psychological tradition: Conation (Hilgard 1980) Self –Efficacy (Bandura DEMO)
C. Kolb’s Learning Cycle (1984)
D. Factors for successful DEMO (Race 2005; 2006; 2007)
E. Classification of teaching / DEMO methods (Elton 1977)
Each of these will be briefly presented DEMO turn, starting with Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning Domains.
A. Domains: Bloom’s taxonomy (1956)
Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy divides educational objectives into three overlapping ‘domains’ – cognitive
(knowledge) affective (attitude) and psychomotor (skills).
Exhibit 2: Bloom’s taxonomy of Learning Domains (1985)

(Adapted from DEMO (1965) and Simpson (1972))

By recognising that there is more than one type of learning, Bloom defined 3 categories or ‘domains’
in which learning takes place; defining them, as Cognitive, Affective and Psychomotor. Each is
detailed below:
Cognitive: The cognitive domain involves the development of intellectual skills from
knowledge (knowing), recall and recognition, through to critical argument (synethising and
evaluating)DEMO
Affective:  The affective domain includes the way emotions are handled, DEMO involves
values, enthusiasms, motivation and attitudes.  Recognised as probably the DEMO difficult to
achieve, attitude is shaped most powerfully by ‘real life’ DEMO and group learning.
Psychomotor (Simpson 1972): The psychomotor domain includes DEMO skill development
such as movement, co-ordination and motor skills. The development DEMO these objectives is
most effective through performing and practising the activity.
Within Exhibit 2, each domain is explored as a hierarchy, which builds DEMO complexity (working from
the simplest to the most complex, at the lower end of the table).  To build mastery of any of these
domains, the lower level skills are learnt first; as mastery DEMO created from working from lower
through to higher levels.
A full appreciation of this model clearly impacts upon learning strategy that needs to be DEMO to
support effective student learning.  For example, to achieve lower cognitive objectives, such as the
transmission of facts or knowledge, mass instruction DEMO (such as lectures – see Framework E
in this series) are most effective. Higher cognitive objectives require student involvement in the
learning process, which is most effectively achieved in small group working (see section 5).
B. Psychological traditions
As Bloom outlined (exhibit 2) cognitive development DEMO concerned with reception, recognition,
judgment and remembering and affective development DEMO to the response to the subject, the
likes and dislikes and DEMO feelings, emotions and moods.  However, these are usefully explored with
DEMO concept of conation which, as a relatively recent term (1980), embraces the active drive to make
sense of something; as any inclination, drive, or desire to do something (within such notions of
motivation, commitment, impulse and striving). Ernest Hilgard (1980) outlined conation DEMO one of
the three processes underlying three central human functions - cognition (perception, memory, and
the processing of information), affection, and DEMO as the aspect of mental processes or
behaviour directed toward action or change and including impulse, desire, volition, and striving.
Conation relates to ‘how’ tasks are processed as well providing insight as to how individuals DEMO
motivated to undertake tasks.
Engaging further with this psychological tradition has developed further notions within
entrepreneurial learning such as the notion of self efficacy DEMO ‘the belief in one’s capabilities to
organise and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations’ (Bandura
1995, p. 2). DEMO, it can be defined as one's belief in one's DEMO to succeed in specific
situations, and this belief subsequently influences the DEMO situation being tackled as self belief
creates positive/negative thought patterns, DEMO impact upon
 Behavioural choices (decision making; risk taking; engagement DEMO new opportunities)
 Motivation (ability to start and complete tasks)DEMO
 Response to failure

C. Kolbs’ experiential cycle (1984)
With the belief that students learn most effectively at deeper levels if they are actively engaged in
the DEMO (rather than being passive receivers of information) Kolb (1984) created a cyclical model
which identifies four key stages through which the student DEMO  Termed ‘experiential learning’,
these stages are:
1. Active experimentation: comes from planning learning (which can be involvement in
learning objectives; DEMO with approaches/options; or creation of a learning
contract)
2. DEMO experience: this is the ‘doing’ which provides the rich experience
3. DEMO: this is generally accepted to be the most difficult for most DEMO, who are
asked to articulate how they ‘feel’ and reflect upon
DEMO What they learnt
b. How they learnt it
c. Why they learnt it
d. Whether the learning experience could be more effective
4. Theorising: this is a critical stage of learning, which builds knowledge and supports further
reflection.
To gain maximum benefit learners may repeat, and deepen, DEMO learning as they revolve around
this cyclical model of learning.
Exhibit 3: Kolb’s Learning Cycle (1984)
D. Experiential Learning: Ripples of Learning (Race 2008)
Race (2005; 2008) advocates 7 factors that DEMO successful learning, which he suggests all
continuously affect each other (as ripples on a pond) rather than following Kolb’s view of a
sequential cycle.  Race’s approach is also based upon experiential learning, but places DEMO
(‘wanting to learn’) at the heart of learning and as the driver for all the other 6 ‘ripples’ (Exhibit 4).
9
Exhibit 4: 7 Ripples (Race 2007)
Together, these ripples create the factors for successful learning (see Exhibit 5) which can be DEMO
as mutually supporting the learning experience,
Exhibit 5 : Factors for successful learning (Race 2005; 2006; 2007)
Wanting to learn
Taking ownership – needing to learn
Learning by doing
Learning through feedback
Making DEMO of what is being learned
Deepening their understanding

Intrinsic motivation – interest and enthusiasm
Extrinsic motivation

Reactions to the results
Reflecting; digesting; turning information into
knowledge
Students undertaking coaching; explaining; teaching
Reviewing; confirming; judging

This basic underpinning of educational and psychological theory surrounding experiential learning
has outlined the domains in which DEMO can take place (Bloom 1956) and explored the most
effective approaches to learning (Kolb 1985; Race 2007).
However, any understanding of learning theory needs to be anchored within the practicalities of
teaching (class room sizes; facilities; resource available etc).  It is therefore useful for any educator
to reflect upon the intended learning outcomes, with an awareness of the benefits and constraints
10
provided by the choice different teaching / learning methods available.  These can be classified
broadly using the basic mode of instruction (Exhibit 6 below).
F.
Elton (1977) outlined three core approaches to the transmission DEMO learning, which he explored as
the evolution of education technology, namely:


These are summarised within Exhibit 6 which also DEMO a general overview of the strengths and
weaknesses of each approach.

objectives
Group learning Teaching facts /
principles
Based on the classifications of Evolution Educational Technology: Elton (1977)
It DEMO clear from exhibit 6 that each of these three techniques has benefits which can be matched
against Bloom’s learning taxonomy.
By recognising that mass DEMO techniques, such as lecturing, are most effective at the
transmission of information for recall as knowledge, whereas group learning and small group work
supports the development of higher level skills, the foundations of an effective teaching and learning
strategy can be created.
The next step is to DEMO exactly what is being taught through the development of appropriate
learning outcomes, as selection of the most appropriate delivery method (Exhibit 6) is driven by the
learning outcome sought (section 4) and the domain DEMO (Exhibit 7) at which it needs to be
employed by the learner.

Having established these traditions, together with three core concepts (enterprise; entrepreneurship

turns, to determine the appropriate learning outcomes and explore the use of group learning within
enterprise.
4. Learning Outcomes
This section DEMO entrepreneurial teaching – that is, the learning outcomes that are sought
DEMO entrepreneurial learning and how is it delivered through use of the pedagogical notes. The
By building upon the basic underpinning of the educational traditions, the entrepreneurial outcomes
framework can be used to structure entrepreneurial pedagogy.
Learning DEMO Framework
The classic learning outcome describes what a student should be able to do in order successfully to
complete a course of study (Baume 2009);  however much of the focus of traditional
Entrepreneurship Programme is upon delivering ‘inputs’ into the entrepreneurial process. For
example in business oriented  education there will be conventional subject inputs of marketing,
finance, operations, control, leadership, etc.  There is also often much emphasis upon DEMO business
plan, as a vehicle of assessment at all levels, on the assumption that it will reach all the learning
outcomes within entrepreneurial DEMO
There seems, however, to be a major absence of a concept frame relating to the Entrepreneurial
Person which in turn lends itself to DEMO of a template of outcomes designed to support the
concept. Such a frame has been constructed as the basis for the development of an DEMO which
to some substantial degree challenges the conventional business focused concept of the
entrepreneur.  This construct focuses upon:

Entrepreneurial behaviours, skills DEMO attributes including emotional intelligence

Preparation for the ‘way of life’ of the entrepreneur



Entrepreneurial values and ways of doing things, feeling things, organising things,
communicating things and learning things experientially
Entrepreneurial behaviour and management in different contexts – not just business
Ideas harvesting, grasping and realisation of opportunity

Managing entrepreneurially, holistically and strategically (DEMO how)

Managing and learning from relationships (know who)
DEMO above constitute key proposed target outcomes from entrepreneurial learning and are
embedded in the Outcomes Framework (adopted by UK’s National Council for Graduate
Entrepreneurship) and set out below, as eight key headlines.
12
Exhibit 7: Framework for Entrepreneurial Outcomes
A. Key entrepreneurial behaviours, skills DEMO
attitudes have been developed.
B. Student’s clearly empathises with,
understand and ‘feel’ the life-world of the
entrepreneur
C. Key entrepreneurial values have been
DEMO
D. Motivation towards a career in
entrepreneurship has been built and students
clearly understand the comparative benefits
E. The students understand the process (stages)
of going into business, the associated tasks and
learning needs
F. Students have the key generic competencies
associated with entrepreneurship
G. Students have DEMO grasp of key business how
to’s associated with the start up process
H. Students understand the nature of the
relationships they need to develop DEMO key
stakeholders and are familiarised with them
13
These outcomes have been designed to operate at the general level – DEMO is, to be applicable to any
learner, at any level.  DEMO means that they can be tailored to support a range of levels (Bloom 1965)
by altering the level of skill development sought in each area. In order to develop effective learning
outcomes, it is generally agreed that they need to meet the criteria below:
 Active DEMO it describes what students can do at the end of the programme of study
 Attractive – students want to achieve it (meaningful to them)
 Comprehensible – students know what it means (clear)
 Appropriate – to the student’s current goals and career plans (again, meaningful)
 Attainable – most students will mostly meet it, DEMO due effort (reasonable)
 Assessable – we can see if DEMO has been achieved (demonstrable)
 Visible – in the course DEMO and on any virtual learning environment (accessible).
Adapted from Baume (2008)
This approach helps shape effective learning outcomes for learners within DEMO range of programmes.
By matching this approach to selected entrepreneurial outcomes, DEMO cohesive learning strategy which
builds the entrepreneurial mindset at all levels can be achieved.
In order to develop these further, it is useful to understand the entrepreneurial learning outcomes in
detail, as shown below:

The above Exhibit clearly shows that the range of outcomes that can support the DEMO of an
entrepreneurial mindset; and whilst this is not an exclusive DEMO, it does provide support to those
working to create entrepreneurial outcomes DEMO others.
Having outlined generic entrepreneurial outcomes that can be adapted for learners working at
different levels, through the application of Baume’s (2009) checklist, the choice of pedagogy is now
critical to support the development of these intended outcomes in learners.  The following section
explores entrepreneurial learning and introduces the pedagogical guide format.
5. Entrepreneurial Teaching
The preceding sections have DEMO identify the key constructs that help underpin the ethos of
entrepreneurial teaching, namely:
 Key defining terms for entrepreneurship, enterprise and innovation (section 2)
 Foundational frameworks from education and psychology (experiential learning) (3)
 Learning Outcomes (section 4)
From this, DEMO are now able to explore ‘what is entrepreneurial teaching?’ before exploring the full
range of pedagogic guides.
Entrepreneurial teaching is designed to maximise DEMO potential for stimulating entrepreneurial
attributes and insight and equipping participants for action.  In particular, it is focused upon
practicing behaviours, developing skills and reinforcing attributes associated with being an
enterprising person.  It is based upon the assumption that all persons have some capacity for
behaving entrepreneurially and DEMO that capacity.  It is worth noting that, although some will
be naturally more enterprising than others, every person will demonstrate a different range and mix
of potential; in that, some will be more creative; some will be more capable of taking initiatives
independently; others will be better at networking and so on.
There will need to be a DEMO emphasis upon teaching ‘for’ as opposed to ‘about’ (Levie 1999).
DEMO ‘For’ courses are focused upon creating enterprising mindsets and exploring what it feels like
to be an entrepreneur.  They involve presentation skills (pitching; groups) and follow the
ethos within this compendium.
 ‘About’ entrepreneurship tend to draw upon a traditional pedagogy of lectures and text
book to DEMO trends with small businesses and sectors and are therefore assessed
through more traditional methods of written exams.
17





Within this classification, these courses are taught using distinctly different pedagogies, DEMO well as
being assessed differently; with teaching ‘for’ referring to the DEMO targeting of the practice of
learning upon the ‘know how’, the DEMO who’ and the ‘need to know’; as related to achieving a
DEMO and/or organisational objectives.  This involves combining skills and knowledge and,DEMO
contrary to what often seems to be a popular belief, does DEMO eschew taking a conceptual approach.
The construction of entrepreneurial teaching can be divided into the categories of:
 The ‘focus’ of learning (Exhibit 9)
 The ‘process’ of learning (Exhibit 10) and
 DEMO process of teaching (Exhibit 11).
Exploring the issues through these DEMO throws up challenges for educators as shown below:
From To
The past The future
Critical analysis Creativity
Knowledge Insight
Passive understanding Active understanding
DEMO detachment Emotional involvement
Manipulation of symbols Manipulation of events
Written communication and Personal communication and

DEMO Gibb (2007) IEEP course notes
Exhibit 9 indicates how the focus of learning has moved from the past - the models of mass
DEMO (Elton 1977) in which the educator take the place of the ‘sage on the stage’ transmitting
knowledge through mass instruction - to the DEMO – where there is a need for students to resolve
problems and respond with creativity and insight.
These changes within the focus of learning (Exhibit 9) impact upon the level of learning that is
required, DEMO learning processes need to move from recall and knowledge (lower level DEMO) to
complex affective skills as problem solving (see Exhibit 10 below).

From Gibb (2007) IEEP course notes
Exhibit 9 and 10 indicate critical DEMO that demand an approach to teaching, which reviews the role
of DEMO student; the approach and focus of the learning and, ultimately the role of the educator, to
‘guide on the side’ – a supportive facilitator of learning, rather than the knowledge ‘expert’ (see
Exhibit 11)DEMO

Adapted from Gibb (2007) IEEP course notes
This approach can primarily be valued/assessed in terms of the degree to which DEMO enables
participants to do things that they could not do before; DEMO is designed to change attitudes towards
the ways of doing, thinking, organising, communicating and learning things, rather than teach the
‘right approach’.
DEMO teaching approach is arguably the core of entrepreneurial learning and can forms the basis for
assessment of the value of the numerous pedagogical methods DEMO this guide (see section 7).
Towards small group teaching?
DEMO is now clear that entrepreneurial learning focuses upon the development of the entrepreneurial
mindset, and draws upon the development of higher level skills affective, cognitive and cognitive to
achieve this.  Elton’s classifications (1977) indicate DEMO the extent to which skill level is developed is
dependent upon the selection of the most appropriate delivery method.  This suggests that even
with large class sizes, interactive engagement, which follows a model of experiential DEMO (Kolb
1984; Race 2007) through small discussions, voting, polls DEMO questions to speakers can support
higher levels of student engagement. Such high levels of student engagement within the learning
process be achieved within large DEMO theatre style class rooms, as the classification of pedagogic
notes (13-15) will show.
The traditions of education across the world have been rooted in mass instruction techniques;
however entrepreneurial learning draws extensively from the DEMO of small groups as entrepreneurial
outcomes are best secured in this delivery method.  It is therefore important to explore this in more
19
detail; and to build familiarity with the format of the pedagogical guides, this will be presented in the
format of a note (4 DEMO - see section 1)
1. Use of Small Group Teaching
1.
What is the use of Small Group Teaching?
Working with small DEMO is as a classic interactive device with a participant class where the
participant numbers, space, seating arrangements in the room and physical facilities DEMO break out
are such as to make it possible.  Group work DEMO be undertaken as a short interactive discussion of a
point or question set by the facilitator.  It can be used to consider an issue, critical incident or short
case as part of a session (see DEMO guides) or it can be the formation of a group for
DEMO of work for a further session, for example a case or DEMO demonstration.  Groups can be as
small as 2; though with a maximum of 5/6 if opportunity is to be given for adequate DEMO by
all parties.
Where group work is to be part of the dynamics of the learning process ‘in class’ then it usually
demands that DEMO class size is restricted to a ‘capacity’ for maximum of six groups.  Larger numbers
can be covered where there is team teaching and therefore greater scope for individual group
mentoring and the exercise does not demand DEMO class feedback.
2.
How is the group exercise constructed?
Group membership needs to be carefully selected.  Criteria for selection will depend on the task and
the composition of participants.  Composition criteria might include: level DEMO nature of experience;
seniority mix; personality; age; gender; level of expertise in relation to the task.  Group exercises are
also a means of building ‘know-who’ (network) relationships as well as bonding and DEMO mixing
groups up at different times is often desirable to allow students to learn from each other, as well as
how others work and think.
For constant and highly interactive enterprise teaching then round table groupings DEMO ideal.  Groups
can then be asked, for example, to quickly DEMO an issue or debate a question, for example



DEMO entrepreneurs born not made?’
‘Are all small business owners entrepreneurs?’
‘How would you evaluate whether you could trust someone in a business DEMO?’
They are also ideal for encouraging a period of reflection on an issue, exchanging experience or
counselling each other.  As an example DEMO running a programme for new entrepreneurs and after
class discussion of ‘what makes a good idea’, groups sitting together can be asked to evaluate each
other’s idea against the criteria agreed.
Break out groupings are designed DEMO tackle more substantive issues – either a mini case or asked to
arrive at a set of conclusions concerning a major issue.
Key issues, often neglected in group work are: ensuring that the group is clear about the task and
desired outcomes; facilitation and guiding a group without controlling it or just leaving it to ‘get on
with things’; and ensuring that there is adequate time for the task.
3.
Relevance to DEMO Learning
Group work is a major component of ensuring ownership of learning; ‘learning by doing’; by
inventing things, making things up, communicating DEMO, building teams, building confidence in a
20
situation of low exposure and solving problems creatively.  It also often simulates getting things
done under pressure and making decisions without too much information.
DEMO Outcomes
It is important that outcomes are carefully considered and that space is given for evaluation and
reflection of the work of the group. DEMO common mistake – easily done under time pressure – is to fail
to allow time for reflection and building on the group outcome.  ‘Report Backs’ do not always
achieve this and may bore the rest of DEMO group who can become restless listening to others.  Asking
the group DEMO write up properly, in good presentation format, its findings is often a more rewarding
outcome as the process forces coherence.  Also the role of the facilitator is critical here in
highlighting key learning points; making reference to theories and frameworks and deepening the
learner’s knowledge from ‘observation’ DEMO ‘reflection’ into structured thought and deeper
cognition.
Having stated the importance of the role of the tutor as a facilitator, and tutor within small group
teaching, it is now important to focus upon entrepreneurial facilitation.  DEMO again will be presented
within the format of the pedagogical guides, DEMO support familiarisation.
2 Use of Entrepreneurial Facilitation
1.
What is the use of Entrepreneurial Facilitation of Small Group Work?
It has been argued DEMO that small group work has a valuable part to play in the experiential
learning required to support the development of new mindsets.  This is because of the scope it
provides for personal contact, engagement and expression.  It also, however, can be the means for
support of the development of a range of entrepreneurial behaviours and skills, for example,
persuasion, empathy, rhetoric, creative problem solving, development and exploration of DEMO,
building of self confidence and self belief and feelings of autonomy and ownership.  Such
developments, however, are dependent on the manner in which the group is facilitated.
2.
How is the exercise constructed?
DEMO general in small group work the cognitive aims are to provide the means for deeper embedding of
knowledge via an informal process of discussion DEMO and peer questioning in a ‘safe’
environment.  In this respect there DEMO an obligation on the facilitator to:
 set broad learning objectives
 bring forward the key questions to be addressed
 keep the DEMO focused around these (limiting any ‘drift’ that might be dysfunctional)
DEMO ensure that there is process of engagement of all participants, and
DEMO summarise the final outcome in relation to objectives
Key facilitator behaviours in these respects include
 summarising
 proposing
 building
 reflecting
 DEMO and
 open ended questioning
21
All of which are to be pursued in a supportive atmosphere of DEMO ‘ground rules’ established in the
class room.
Over and above these objectives and behaviours the process allows for focus upon development of
entrepreneurial behaviours, skills and attributes.  To assess success in his respect facilitators can
evaluate their ‘process’ performance in terms of:
to what degree did they DEMO ‘ownership’ of the learning process by participants?
to what extent were new ideas generated?
what risks were taken in the discussion and DEMO were these useful?
how much ‘challenging’ took place?
to what degree have we built an atmosphere of greater empathy between participants and
DEMO trust?
how much have participants learnt about each other?
how much have participants learnt from each other (effective exchange)?
to DEMO degree has he group developed as a team?
have we learned anything about effective team work?
To create positive outcomes in respect DEMO the above may require entrepreneurial innovation, for
example:
 placing DEMO leadership facilitator role with participants and using group feedback to
comment on their role
 using brainstorming techniques during the discussion
 breaking the DEMO in smaller (one to one) groups to come up with views on different issues
for debate
 by the wider group or seeking DEMO resolution between two or more of participants
without dislodging the whole group
 inviting role playing of different sides of the arguments as seen DEMO the eyes of selected
externals (for example how would an owner DEMO see this?) bringing up for discussion
aspects of the process (DEMO example why has Miss X dominated the discussion? Why has Mr DEMO
seemingly opted out?) While these are risky strategies they ultimately will encourage
openness and can be approached in a supportive climate.
 allowing DEMO for reflection on what the group has learnt about group management
processes
 exploring innovative ways of presenting the findings from the group, this encouraging
creativity but also recognition that emotions play an important role in DEMO
 allowing time for reflection on what the participants have learned about each other (quick
exchange feedback)
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The group process is designed to simulate process of team problem solving and DEMO generation as
in the ‘real entrepreneurial’ world.  It builds recognition of DEMO to deal with common issues in this
process, for example individual DEMO, ‘free-loading’ by those who minimally participate,
process of informal power DEMO control, conflict resolution and hostility.

With group work established as a key approach for the entrepreneurial educator, it is to the
pedagogic notes that this compendium now turns. This next section will provide an overview as to
how the guides can DEMO accessed and shows how these techniques can be used for individualised and
mass instruction learning, as needed (exhibit 13-15).
Having established the DEMO underpinnings of entrepreneurial teaching, the pedagogic guides can
now be introduced.  Structured around 4 key categories, they are designed to be highly accessible
and to that end, 3 route-maps are provided to assist educators to adopt these approaches into their
teaching quickly and easily.
5. Accessing the DEMO Guides
Building upon the educational underpinning and exploration of entrepreneurial learning, DEMO is to the
pedagogical guides that this compendium now turns, as DEMO now form the core of this book.  This
compendium is designed DEMO support the educator as they develop entrepreneurial outcomes in
others.  To DEMO end, they are structured to be as accessible as possible.  This is achieved by using a
standardised format (detailed below) and providing DEMO ‘route-maps’ to support the selection of
pedagogies within teaching practice.
These ‘route-maps’ include mapping against the outcomes framework and also Elton’s classification
of delivery DEMO

Using the DEMO
The overall aim is to encourage educators to think about the range of pedagogies that might be used
in an entrepreneurship/enterprise programme to DEMO with the Affective and Conative as well as the
Cognitive aspects of learning (see section 3).  Each of the pedagogical notes is DEMO within a
standardised format to assist the educator in their selection.  DEMO are four key headings, which
help define the approach, indicate its use, purpose and the learning outcome it supports (Exhibit 12).

Classification Mapping
Although earlier discussion (section 4) indicates that small group DEMO is often most appropriate
in developing the higher cognitive skills and deeper understanding that is required to support the
development of an entrepreneurial mindset.  However there can be constraints for any educator
(class sizes; class DEMO & facilities; time limitations) which mean that working in small groups
is not always possible, or as rich an experience as the educator may intend.  Therefore, whilst all the
pedagogical guides could be classified DEMO most appropriate (and therefore best used) within small
group working, DEMO is has been possible to identify areas where the approaches outlined in the
pedagogical notes can enhance or support higher cognitive development, whilst in a traditional
lecture theatre (mass instruction facility). This compendium will draw upon Elton’s (1977)
classification of delivery methods to help structure the 44 pedagogies as a ‘route-map’.
Note: that where the columns are linked this indicates that approaches can be deepened by working
across these classifications.  For example, whilst it is possible to undertake the development of an
elevator pitch; sales pitch or audit as an individualised task, learning DEMO be deepened through
entrepreneurial facilitation (see section 5), following a DEMO to the group.

3. Use of Ice Breakers
What is Use of Ice breakers?
DEMO is an informal exercise designed to create interaction between participants, “warm DEMO up”
(as the name implies) to the activities of the day and learn about each other.  It can also enable
participants to harvest from each other the experience that already exists in a group of DEMO issues
to be addressed in a learning programme.  It is most DEMO used at the beginning of a programme
to replace the process of participants introducing each other more formally (which can be a long
and repetitive exercise, which doesn’t allow people to interact).
How is the exercise constructed?
Any game or exercise involving mobility and informal interaction DEMO be classified as an ice-
breaker.  Examples include Speed Networking (see separate pedagogic guide – speed
networking), participants interviewing each other and DEMO interviewing, then introducing their
counterpart, preferably in an innovative and amusing manner.   There can be ‘rules’ applied; in
that you can structure the areas they need to focus upon, or as facilitator, you DEMO set
parameters, such as how many things they need to find DEMO or number of things that each person
may report on (as DEMO introduction about another).
The exercise can be constructed to fit any programme.  The exercise can involve each participant
being given a set of papers with boxes to fill in on the basis of exchanges with DEMO participants.
The boxes are designed to cover key areas of experience relevant to the learning programme - for
an academic development programme (staff development) this could include the experience of
participants in teaching to certain key outcomes in the NCGE Template.
in a student entrepreneurship programme it can DEMO used to harvest evidence of participant
entrepreneurial behaviour (identified and taken DEMO opportunity; been committed to see
something through (project); failed in something but tried again; solved a problem creatively;
planned and carried out an event under pressure; sold an idea to someone, etc)DEMO  Most people
have some experience of these things which they can DEMO easily within new colleagues.
The exercise is commonly undertaken under time pressure.  The exchange of experience allowed
between any two participants is deliberately limited to force participants to move around.
Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise DEMO designed to: facilitate networking, the harvesting of information and its
codification under pressure.  It can also create confidence by a process of realisation of existing
experience and informal benchmarking against other participants in a programme.  It also creates
a competitive but non-threatening atmosphere.

They also realise that it is relevant to them personally, and that they and others have relevant
experience to input into the DEMO

4. Use of External Speakers/Presenters or Evaluators
What is Use of DEMO Speakers/Presenters/Evaluators?
External speakers/presenters are used in enterprise/entrepreneurship programmes for a number
of purposes:
 to provide role models DEMO entrepreneurs –‘what’s it really like’
 to provide a ‘real life case’ of how to confront/deal with a particular problem or
issue
 DEMO more formally teach a ‘how to’ part of entrepreneurial management
 to act as a sounding board/evaluator for a piece of work or DEMO
 to present what their institution/organisation does (or a certain DEMO of its work)
 to give a view on a general issue of relevance to a programme
How is the exercise constructed?
DEMO the answer to this question is ‘very badly’.  The common reasons DEMO this are:

lack of clarity of the role to be played (as set out above, aligned with learning
outcomes)
 DEMO briefing of the ‘external’ (learning outcomes)
 inadequate briefing of DEMO students/audience
 inadequate management of the learning experience
 a resultant deterioration of the session into ‘personality/ego’ stories
 an inability to DEMO the session to concepts or generalisation about good or bad
practice
 inappropriate frames of reference agreed/used for evaluation/mentoring
1.
2.
The DEMO of the external interface is therefore extremely important.   Careful
establishment of the goals of the external/internal interface is key – in particular DEMO learning
goals.  If, for example, a ‘new young entrepreneur’ is DEMO as a ‘speaker’ there is a range of
possible objectives, all DEMO which it is desirable to spell out upfront.  These include: demonstrating
clearly the motivations and drivers to self-employment; establishing how one finds and evaluates
an idea; demonstrating how one copes with changes in the life-world associated with being an
entrepreneur, among many others.  One enterprising way DEMO structuring outcomes in this way is
not to overly brief the invitee but to set up an interview panel or panels of programme
participants (each one dealing with a different issue).  Their task is to draw out the relevant
experiences of the participants.
Another method of improving DEMO management of external contributions is to precede the
presentation/interview with an analysis of an issue leading to the development of a frame of
DEMO against which the programme participants can evaluate the external contribution.
For example, where an external is being invited to demonstrate how they approach a particular
problem/issue (evaluating a business plan) the class are thoroughly DEMO as to the process
which presents them with a frame for evaluating/questioning the contribution of the external).
Where externals are being used DEMO evaluators – for example of a project or proposal – initial
briefing and agreement of frames of reference and process is important.   Where DEMO are
used as teachers, then initial training is important or should DEMO supported by staff in a joint
approach.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The aim is to engage with the DEMO world’ in order to provide feelings of ‘what it is like’ to do
things and experience things in practice.  It is therefore a simulation of tacit learning but to be
successful, it must leave the participants with an ‘emotional’ understanding of the learning input
and a heuristic framework DEMO which they can judge future events.
4. Outcomes
Participants have a real ‘feel’ for the practice of the real world.  They have a bridge between
concept and practice and they understand the drift between concept and DEMO  They
understand better the way in which entrepreneurial decisions are made.

5.  Use of Drama
1. What is Use of Drama?
It is the creation and performance by an individual or group of an DEMO, scenario or sequence
of events designed to portray the emotional and DEMO as well as cognitive aspects of the
scene.  Its use can DEMO a number of purposes:
 It is a reminder that no information received from interviews and research approaches (no
matter how good the checklist) is truly objective.  The results always reflect the values and
DEMO of the person interviewed and often their recent experiences and emotions.  DEMO
example, a person who has recently been convicted by police of DEMO speeding traffic offence
will have a different response to questions about the role and value of the police force in
general than someone who DEMO just been saved by the police from an assault.  A dramatic
DEMO of interviews will demand interpretation of the emotions behind the
message.
 It demands of the creators of the drama that they must put DEMO ‘in the shoes’ of
the provider of information and see the results from their point of view.  The conventional
academic process of data collection often makes little or no demand upon understanding
the data from the DEMO point of view.
 Drama demands that individual characters in the drama are understood through the eyes
of the other characters.  The dramatist makes the character believable by portraying
him/her through the eyes of other DEMO in the drama.
 Messages and information delivered in innovative ways will make a bigger impact and can
create wider understanding.  Entrepreneurs often need to use creative ways of delivering
messages.  TV advertising is, for DEMO, drama.  A presentation can be dramatic to make
an impact.
 Drama provides training in acting skills, which build confidence and ability to personally
project.
 Developing a drama demands the use of creative ability DEMO often the need is to develop a
metaphor to enhance the impact of a message or indeed generalise it.
 Developing drama in groups DEMO creates a powerful bonding process.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Use of drama can take a number of forms including Role Play DEMO Hot Seating, which are the
subject of separate Pedagogical Notes (18 & 8).  Participants can be asked, in small groups, to
create a scene portraying a single message, often through metaphor.  For DEMO, in the
entrepreneurship context they can be asked to prepare a DEMO scene portraying one of a number
of entrepreneurial behaviours or attributes e.g. entrepreneurial risk taking; opportunity
identification; initiative taking; strong sense of autonomy; networking; learning by doing, and so
on.  The ‘audience’ of DEMO participants is then invited to guess the message, to score the
DEMO of the metaphor and the degree of entertainment delivered.
The drama can also be constructed around a piece of research – for example, in the context of
dramatising a series of interviews as a method of DEMO insight into the results of formal data
collection.  In this case DEMO key issues arising from the research are discussed in a group and the
messages to be delivered are set out.  A metaphor is then created and dramatised under
guidance and later performed.  The audience is then asked to record the key messages of the
drama and to score DEMO presentation for creativity and entertainment.

Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Entrepreneurs need to be able to DEMO out different roles in different situations.  A good
entrepreneur is a DEMO actor.  In building relationships with different stakeholders the
entrepreneur will need DEMO act out different roles – with a banker, venture capitalist, government
official, employee, regulator, customer and so on.  It is a DEMO essence of entrepreneurship to see
oneself through the eyes of major stakeholders.  As well as building personal confidence there is
a strong emphasis upon being creative under pressure, making collective decisions rapidly and
working together as a team.
Outcomes
Participants gain understanding of the emotional aspects of knowledge DEMO how difficult it is to
be truly objective.  They understand the DEMO of gaining empathy and insight into the
passions, emotions and contexts DEMO situations.  They learn about the process of consolidation of
ideas and DEMO the importance of presenting these creatively but in a form that that will be easily
understood.

6.   Use of Debate
1. What is Use of Debate?
DEMO is used to provide a forum for delivery of argument for and against an issue.  It provides a
platform for exploring all relevant issues.   It also is a vehicle for practicing delivery skills and
‘thinking DEMO one’s feet’.  It also has to have audience appeal as the DEMO is to win their vote but
also involve them.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
A debate can be formal or informal.  It is relatively easy to construct an issue for argument with a
class, get them to consider arguments for or against and then speak to DEMO from the ‘floor’.
A more formal version is described below (however DEMO is possible just to work at an informal level,
having established 2 sides for the debate and defined roles 1-3 below).
Traditionally, a debate will have a ‘Motion’ (statement) which the ‘House’ (those attending) must
address.  For example, ‘This House believes that entrepreneurs are ‘born not made’ or ‘This
House believes that entrepreneurial management can only DEMO fully pursued in the independent
business organisation’.
The debate will need: (indicative timings included for an hour session)
1. A Chairperson: who will introduce the Motion and the Proposers, Opposers and ‘Summers
up’? DEMO Chair also sets out the rules of the game, the time DEMO and how he/she will
enforce these and how the audience should contribute.  A chair will explain the vote and
how this will be for the best arguments best delivered not the audience’s personal
preference (as more reflective of the learning gained, rather than opinion at the time).
2. A Proposer: to put up all the major positive arguments for the Motion {7 minutes}
3. An Oppose: -to put all the main arguments against the Motion {7 minutes}
4. A Seconded for the DEMO: to counter the arguments of the Oppose as they have been
DEMO and as they occur in reality.  Also to back up and DEMO arguments to those of the
Proposer {5 minutes}
5. A Seconded against the Motion: to counter all the arguments of the Proposer and Seconded
for the Motion as they have been anticipated and as they occur DEMO practice and to back up
the opposition arguments {5 minutes}
6. Speakers from the floor (the audience) to think of their own views DEMO articulate them.
Speakers do not ask questions but make points and arguments.  They may of course take up
what has been said by the speakers.  In a small audience it should be emphasised that every
member has to contribute
7. A Summariser for the Motion: to summarise up the debate after the audience has
contributed, using the key audience contributions, and emphatically inviting the audience to
support the Motion {5 minutes}
8. A Summariser against the Motion: to summarise up the debate after the audience has
contributed, using the audience contributions that support their argument, DEMO emphatically
inviting the audience to oppose the Motion {5 minutes}
All speakers should not read from notes but should address the audience warmly and
DEMO and should use humour sufficiently to entertain.
The sequence is as follows:

Concluding remarks by the Chair
To engage all the participants in the debate it can be organised as follows:


DEMO




Divide the class into 6 groups
Group 1 has to agree the main points for the Motion, make suggestions as to
innovative/entertaining  arguments and choose a speaker
Group 2 has to agree the major points against the Motion, make suggestions for
innovative/entertaining arguments and choose a speaker
Group 3 has to brainstorm on the DEMO that might be put by the opposition, think
of counterpoints and DEMO of refuting them entertainingly and subsidiary points to
reinforce the Motion.  DEMO then choose a speaker to second the Motion.
Group 4 has to brainstorm on the arguments that might be presented by the proposers
of DEMO Motion and also how the points against might be attacked and choose a speaker
to second the opposition to the Motion.
Group 5 has DEMO brainstorm on what they think will be the main points for and against
(including any possible points from the floor).  They then DEMO an outline summary of
the argument for supporting the motion and refuting the opposition.  They then choose a
speaker who has however to be prepared to build flexibly upon what goes on in the
debate
Group DEMO goes through the same procedure as Group 5 except that they prepare an
outline summary of the arguments for opposing the Motion and refuting DEMO
arguments.  They then choose a speaker who has however to be DEMO to build
flexibly upon what goes on in the debate.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The ability to think and speak on one’s feet DEMO tested and in particular the ability to have empathy
with the alternative point of view.  This also tests the capacity to argue and present a case in a
flexible and innovative manner.  Critically, it is DEMO vehicle for exploring key issues in
entrepreneurship development which creates group cohesion, bonding and fun.
4. Outcomes
Major outcomes to be targeted are the airing of key issues in entrepreneurship development via
an innovative format.  Participants can also apply their more formal learning in a flexible and
demanding DEMO and building a team spirit is also a key component, within DEMO cohort.
37
7.  Use of Drawing
1. What is Use of Drawing?
This is essentially the transmission of ideas into pictures.  It is used to stimulate participants in a
programme to express themselves and their ideas in DEMO pictorial form, often with the use of
metaphor.  It then stands as a basis for discussion of participant ideas and concepts.
2. How DEMO the exercise constructed?
Programme participants are asked, usually in groups, to discuss the meaning of a concept or an
event.  They are asked to portray this in pictorial form as a basis for presentation DEMO discussion
with other participants.
An example:
 The object of the session is to explore the concept of enterprise culture.  The aim is to
begin with an exploration of what this means to the participants DEMO to explore
whether there is a shared concept
 The class is divided into small groups and each group is given pens and a DEMO chart sheet.
The group are asked to ‘discover’ their own meaning for enterprise culture and to write
down what they see as the key DEMO
 The group is then asked to draw a picture which they believe encapsulates the meaning
of enterprise culture
 The picture is then DEMO to the rest of the class and the class are asked to describe
what it means to them
 This is then compared with DEMO meaning that the group was trying to portray and the
group are asked to explain this to other participants
 The facilitator notes all DEMO meanings given and attempts to pull these together for
discussion of the concept and why it was given different meanings.  Academic concepts
and research work can be introduced to build wider understanding (and credit can be
awarded for its inclusion).
The approach can be used in a DEMO of ways but most importantly to test understanding after
readings and discussion and, to harvest pre-conceived views and attitudes relating to a subject as
a basis for discussion.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise aims DEMO stimulate creative expression.  It also is designed to give ownership of
DEMO to participants by creating discussion on the basis of their existing knowledge and ideas.
4. Outcomes
A strong basis for mutual understanding is created.  A sense of ownership is given and
participation in learning is maximised.  The power of visual presentation is demonstrated.
38
8.  Use of Hot Seats
1. What is Use of Hot Seats?
This is a group exercise.  Members of the group in turn are put in the ‘Hot Seat’ to respond to
intensive questioning from DEMO group members.  Traditionally, this ‘Hot Seating’ technique is
used by actors to help them identify with the character they are playing.  It is used in
entrepreneurship education to enable participants to get inside the culture DEMO values of
stakeholders with whom they might have to deal.  But DEMO can also be used for intensive
questioning of an individual’s own personal aims, objectives and plans including business plans.
Other participant’s (the group) act as interrogators in this exercise; note: it can be useful DEMO agree
ground rules as what is appropriate in terms of questioning and approach within this task.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The DEMO seat itself is in the middle of a semi-circle of chairs.  DEMO person in the ‘Hot Seat’ can be
himself/herself or represent a client or stakeholder.  Dependent upon the role, questions fired
rapidly may DEMO to personal issues; business/organisational problems or community activities
(part of ground rules).
Example Hot Seat: Business/plan/idea
The individual is surrounded by those role playing different stakeholders which the plan might
need DEMO convince.  The aim is to create recognition that the plan will DEMO seen very differently by
very different stakeholders.  Interrogators may, for example, play the roles of bankers, venture
capitalists, family, local government DEMO offering grants; a potential large customer who will
be judging whether DEMO include the client on a buying list or a major potential supplier who may be
asked for credit.
Other participants can then be similarly DEMO seated.  At the end of the hot seating there can be DEMO
review of what has been learned about the business plan as a relationship management
instrument and how it might be best developed to meet DEMO needs.
Example Hot Seat: different stakeholders
Using the same focus of DEMO business plan; hot seater’s, in turn, can be asked to DEMO the roles of
different stakeholders, as above, and are quizzed about what they are looking for and why?
Example Hot Seating on DEMO problem
The technique can be used to role-play individuals from a case study with the aim of creating
lively personalised discussion of major points DEMO learning from the case.  It can also be used to
focus DEMO on how to deal with a particular problem set out in a simple brief.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
This is an exercise in DEMO and responding under pressure.  It also is designed to stimulate
understanding DEMO relationship management and the value of thinking empathetically.  It can be
DEMO to throw light on the ‘organisational cultures’ of different stakeholders that make them see
the same things in different ways.
4. Outcomes
39
Participants gain confidence in responding to questioning under pressure.  They may importantly
also learn that they need to ‘act’ differently with different stakeholders.  They learn quickly to
adapt to others’ point of view.
40
9.  Use of Speed-Networking
1. What is Use of Speed-Networking?
It is an informal exercise designed to create interaction between participants, warm them up (as
the name implies) and learn about each other.  Speed-Networking can be used to encourage
networking at an event or it can DEMO used in teaching and learning as an ice-breaker (see earlier
note DEMO).  It is most often used during the early stages of DEMO programme to replace the process of
participants introducing each other more formally.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
In speed networking, participants are lined up in two lines facing each other; they are invited to
spend 30 seconds to 1 minute each introducing themselves to each other.  Usually a whistle or
some other loud device is used to indicate DEMO the time is up (as this exercise is quite noisy!).
DEMO the time is complete one line moves along so that they are facing a new person and the
introductions start again.  Typically the speed-networking exercise may be conducted for 20-30
minutes.  A longer period of time is not recommended as it can be tiring for participants.
The exercise DEMO be constructed to fit any programme or event.  For example in DEMO
entrepreneurship programmes it can be used to get students to introduce each other before
group work or before choosing groups for an experiential exercise (e.g.  business planning).  The
exercise is commonly undertaken under time DEMO  The exchange of experience allowed
between any two participants is deliberately DEMO to encourage a focused summary of the
person introducing themselves.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is designed to facilitate networking and enable DEMO to get a basic knowledge of
each other in a short period of time.  It is usually a fun exercise so it works well in ice-breaking
and it ensures that participants talk to a large number DEMO other people.
4. Outcomes
Participants get to know each other more, DEMO break down barriers and it enables the beginning
of trust to emerge between participants.  Usually they meet somebody who they may not have
otherwise met and sometimes these individuals assist their learning on the programme more DEMO a
consequence of social barriers being removed.
41
10.  Use of an Elevator Pitch
1. What is Use of an Elevator Pitch?
An Elevator Pitch (or Elevator Speech) is a DEMO overview of an idea for a product, service, or
project.  DEMO pitch is so called because it can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride
(say, thirty seconds or 100-150 words)DEMO  The term is typically used in the context of an
entrepreneur DEMO an idea to a venture capitalist to receive funding.  Venture capitalists DEMO
judge the quality of an idea and team on the basis of the quality of its elevator pitch, and will ask
entrepreneurs for the elevator pitch to quickly weed out bad ideas.
2. How is the DEMO constructed?
In the entrepreneurship educators programme the elevator pitch is used to force participants to
think carefully about their personal strengths and to DEMO confident about these by making an
explicit pitch.  Within the entrepreneurship DEMO programme it is used to give participants
experience of an elevator pitch.  The basic approach is to invite individuals to develop their pitch
beforehand with a strict time limit (usually 1 to 3 minutes).   Participants are asked to compete in
front of a panel of judges DEMO with agreed judging criteria.  Participants are lined up to
encourage swift DEMO from one participant to another and they are timed – a whistle is
blown at the end of the time and they must then DEMO
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Elevator Pitches are commonly used in US Enterprise Education and are often used in business
plan competitions.  The purpose is to force students to prepare a short and focused explanation
of DEMO business should they have the opportunity to pitch it to somebody in an informal
situation.  It is an encouragement to think out the core of the business and find attractive ways of
putting it over.
4. DEMO
The main benefits of the approach are to enable students to pick up the skills to summarise
something in a focused and precise way.  The outcome is often that they are aware how
important lucky opportunities DEMO be in entrepreneurship and to prepare for such opportunities
should they occur.

11.  Use of Revolving Tables
1. What is Use of Networking Techniques – Revolving Tables?
The networking technique of Revolving Tables involves asking DEMO during a dinner (or indeed
any teaching course where the tables DEMO in cabaret style) to change tables between courses or
between sessions DEMO a teaching and learning programme.  It is designed to maximise the DEMO
of people that a person may meet at a networking or learning event.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
A formal networking technique DEMO revolving tables can be used between courses to enable
participants to meet other participants and to enable them to informally talk and interview the
DEMO guests and contributors.  Participants were given a focused question or challenge DEMO such
as, to find out how start up is supported and DEMO by the invited guests’ institutions and
organisations and to explore any challenges that they encounter.  The technique is principally an
informal one that is designed to develop informal discourse between participants.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
DEMO Tables might be used in a range of contexts – it is very effective in situations where
networking needs to be facilitated, such as breakfast clubs or other events.  It can be used in
entrepreneurial learning within the University as an ice-breaker or as a method to encourage
DEMO engagement in an experiential project where groups need to work together.
4. Outcomes
The outcomes achieved will somewhat depend on the use of the DEMO – it can be used to
help students develop their informal conversation skills and help them learn how to network.  In
such networking situations, it can help people mix more than they would normally and is
effective at encouraging informal conversations, which can lead to business opportunities.
43
12.  Use of Brainstorming Using Post-its
1. What is Use of Brainstorming Using Post-its?
The basis of brainstorming is generating ideas in a DEMO situation based on the principle of
suspending judgment to release ideas - a principle which can be highly productive in individual
effort as well DEMO group effort.  The key to effective brainstorming is that the generation DEMO is
separate from the judgment phase of thinking.  Brainstorming has many DEMO but is usually
conducted in groups with specific rules being applied: DEMO ideas; aim for a large quantity
of ideas; permission to use piggy-backing of others ideas and freewheeling (be as abstract as
possible).
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Within an entrepreneurship educators programme DEMO loose form of brainstorming was used using
post-it notes.
Agree the guidelines for effective group brain storming, as below:





There is no right and wrong
Do not judge ideas
Be DEMO or ambitious
Do not rule out ideas because of practicalities at this stage
Two heads are better than one!
Participants were asked to think DEMO as many ‘learning needs’ and ‘learning offers’ as they
could and attach these to appropriate NCGE learning outcomes.   This was the brainstorming part
DEMO the exercise.   These ideas were collected into themes by the use of the outcomes framework.
In the second stage of the exercise participants DEMO asked to take one learning outcome and
sort the ideas into categories.  In this stage they were organising the ideas.   In the final stage
they were asked to link categories together.  This stage was a form of conceptualisation – seeing
how the different categories link to each DEMO
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise can be constructed in many brainstorming situations.  It is particularly valuable
when you want to get thoughts from participants and to organise them in a sophisticated way.  In
a student situation it could be used to explore attitudes and expectations about
DEMO  It can also be used to conduct analysis of business ideas.
DEMO Outcomes
The main benefit of the approach is for a combined perspective from participants in relation to a
particular theme.  This holistic view enables participants to be more aware of the wider picture.
It is also DEMO effective at demonstrating expectations and views across a group.  The
categorisation DEMO makes explicit participants’ frames of reference.

13.  Use of Panels
1. What is Use of Panels?
A Panel is a means of fronting a debate or forming the basis DEMO a process of questioning or
collecting opinion/experience on certain issues, DEMO or opportunities.  The Panel may be
composed of ‘externals’ or may DEMO used as an internal ‘review’ group for a particular issue.  It DEMO
often also used as an alternative to inviting presentations from external speakers.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Panels are often misused in DEMO they become a vehicle for a series of speeches by panel
members in response to a number of questions asked by the chair or DEMO from the
audience; however panels can be used in different ways.
DEMO ‘Expert Panel’ is used to provide comment on a particular issue about which the panel have
relevant experience.  Here, the optimum format is DEMO the panel very briefly addresses
questions from the audience collected either beforehand or spontaneously.  Engagement of the
audience in the debate is important.  DEMO chairperson’s role in stimulating audience participation,
provoking cross-panel debate, keeping DEMO short, summarising and ensuring that the
debate is to the point DEMO critical.  The panel should be carefully chosen to bring different
perspectives DEMO the theme.  For example in debating issues concerning the ‘entrepreneurial
university’, a panel might have a Vice Chancellor, an articulate student perhaps representing a
student body, an entrepreneur with some experience of interacting with a university, a
representative of a regional development authority or local government and someone from the
Department of Education.
An Expert Panel can also be DEMO with small groups to evaluate or comment upon the ideas,
proposals and plans of participants.
Participant Panels can be formed to role-play stakeholders DEMO simply to comment upon the work
of other participants, individual or DEMO; for example, to advice on marketing plans.
A Representative Panel, DEMO example, a small group of entrepreneurs from a particular sector, or a
group sharing a common environment or experience (for example all having taken up external
equity) can be used to explore the experience via a process of questioning by participants (often
after briefing from programme input).
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The emphasis is upon exposure to DEMO learning, enabling assessment of ‘how things are seen and
done’ in DEMO world of practice.  If chaired properly it can also provide a DEMO measure of learning
by interaction.  It can also provide a vehicle DEMO testing out concepts in practice.
4. Outcomes
Ideas are stimulated by exposure to experience.  The animation arising from this approach
creates stimulation to the affective and co native aspects of learning.  Contacts are made and
barriers to external relationship development are broken down.
45
14.  Use of Critical Incidents
1. What is Use of Critical Incidents?
The Critical Incident is a short description of a situation that DEMO be used as a basis for focused
group discussion.  The description DEMO be in the form of a single PowerPoint slide or one page (or
less) handout capable of being instantly read and digested.  It will end with a question to the
group as the basis for DEMO  The discussion may be full class or small group.  A critical
incident is often preferred to a longer case as it provides immediate DEMO  A longer case can,
however, be taught as a series of incidents.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The incident is DEMO before the session by the facilitator.  Examples might be as follows.
DEMO 1:
Aim: to stimulate group discussion of the life world DEMO the entrepreneur.
Key Question for Focus: What changes in one’s ‘way DEMO life’ when one moves from employment
to self employment?
Kate is a young single woman of 25 years of age.  She graduated from University two years ago
with good degree in design – focused upon DEMO  She had always had a considerable talent
for art and design DEMO from an early age.  She had worked herself up the educational
DEMO in creative design by successful progress through further education, then to DEMO University.
Upon graduating she took a post at a school teaching ceramics but soon decided that this life was
not for her.  She wanted more independence.  With the help of a small legacy from her
grandmother she set up her own studio, complete with kiln and embarked on a career in self
employment.
What changed in her life-world as a DEMO of this move?
The facilitator can draw from the group a list of changes which can be used for discussion of the
nature DEMO uncertainties and complexities facing the entrepreneur and the skills and attributes
that might be needed to deal with them.
Example 2:
Aim: to stimulate discussion of how to cope with change in a business development DEMO
Key Question for focus: How well is the business geared up DEMO cope with an acquisition?
Company Z is a family business with 80 employees operating in the steel stockholding business.
It is highly successful.  In an industry dominated by large companies, with an extensive stock
ranges, it has managed to carve out a niche for itself.  It DEMO upon a few large customers, for
whom it offers a special DEMO, and a range of small firms located within a 150 km DEMO  The
CEO and owner is an accountant and the company is DEMO managed.  It is among the top
performing firms in the industry DEMO is well recognised.  The owner is President of the National
Stockholders DEMO  The company is cash rich and looking for expansion.  One of its
customers is a small manufacturing company located within 1 km distance.  This company makes
hatch doors for cargo vessels and for bulk rail DEMO carriers.  The company is in difficulty and
its owners want to DEMO  The management team at Company Z think this a great opportunity DEMO
diversify and sets out to acquire the manufacturer at a bargain price
46
How well does the experience of the company equip it for success DEMO taking on this new
acquisition?
The facilitator uses the Incident to create a framework for reviewing the quality and nature of the
intangible DEMO of this well run company and to demonstrate that many of these do not prepare
it for a proposed substantial shift in the task DEMO  The incident can therefore lead into
discussion of contingent theories of DEMO organisation design.
It should be clear from the above that an educator can without great difficulty create a focus for
discussion with very little DEMO in preparation.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The technique stimulates creative thinking in the group.  It places the pressure for knowledge
creation upon the participants and brings out and encourages sharing of previously tacit
knowledge internalised.  Essentially the critical incident technique is a vehicle for drawing out
what DEMO already know.
4.
Outcomes
Participants own the learning and the frameworks created by this process and therefore are
more likely to internalise the knowledge DEMO
47
15.  Use of Organisations as Networks
1. What is Use of Organisations as Networks?
All organisations can be described in terms of networks DEMO relationships.  Independent business
management, for example, can be characterised as DEMO process of managing interdependency with
a range of stakeholders (customers, suppliers, financiers, professional services, staff, family,
competitors and so on)DEMO  The same concept can be applied to all organisations.  The aim of this
pedagogical exercise is to get participants to see new ventures DEMO a process of negotiation with all
key stakeholders.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants are given an event to organise, preferably one that involves some risk and
uncertainty.  This can be a business, DEMO enterprise and other (public) activity.  They are first
asked to DEMO all the stakeholders, internal and external, who will impact on the success or
otherwise of the venture.  They are then, using empathy, asked to personalise the key players as
far as possible and identify DEMO towards the venture.  In particular they are asked to
identify:
DEMO the nature of the interest of the stakeholder in the venture;
2. the benefits to the stakeholder that will be recognised and unrecognised;DEMO
3. what exactly they want from the stakeholder;
4. the reasons why the stakeholder might buy into the venture;
5. why they DEMO oppose it; and the importance of the support or otherwise of DEMO
stakeholder to the success of the venture.
Having done this for key stakeholders participants are then asked to:
1. assess who might be DEMO supportive of the project and who will be most negative;
2. consider the relationships between the stakeholders if any;
3. identify who DEMO the probable supporters might be used to influence those who have
reservations or are likely to oppose.
Finally the exercise can be carried forward DEMO reality – if it is a real venture – or by a process of
simulation and role play.  Strategies for negotiation are developed and played out, providing
consideration of use of different forms of communication.
Among examples that can be used are: the organisation of a local pop concert for charity; the
development of a social enterprise focused upon providing disadvantaged women with families
with a greater capacity to find employment or DEMO conventional business start up.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The emphasis is upon relationship learning and education of stakeholders and the development
of trust-based DEMO The focus is upon doing things through people.
48
4. Outcomes
There will be enhanced capacities to: see all ventures as sets of relationships to be developed;
build trust based relationships; develop strategies to build effective networks: and use
negotiation skills.

16. Use of Empathy in Communication Exercises (with Entrepreneurs)
1. What is Use of Empathy in Communication Exercises?
The objective is to DEMO participants to the need for different forms of communication with
different audiences or interest groups, and to develop capacity to use this skill.   In particular,
emphasis is placed upon the ‘ways of communicating’ of DEMO, informally, within
constraints (word limit) and on a need-to-know and know-how basis.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
This can be DEMO in a number of ways, including by an exercise in writing DEMO different
kinds of audiences.
To commence this exercise, participants, organised in small groups, can be given a copy of an
article from a ‘broadsheet’ newspaper (in the UK, this would be the Times or DEMO) and then
an article on the same subject from a ‘tabloid’ (in the UK these would be The Sun or The Mirror).
DEMO are asked to analyse the differences.  They can then be asked DEMO write a short piece
reporting an incident or covering an issue of relevance to the group in the language of the
broadsheet (the Times) and then the tabloid (the Sun newspaper).  The end discussion might
focus upon the importance of considering the different ‘word counts’ and DEMO of
communication for different audiences and discussion of the relevance of this for the
participants.
An example focused upon reaching independent business owners might DEMO that of designing a
brochure to promote a programme on financial management for small firms.  Participants might
be asked to speculate on the different needs of different groups of firms at different stages and
invited to DEMO ways of segmentation of the ‘market.  Particular attention will be paid DEMO the
educational/qualification background and the kinds of newspapers they might read.  They might
then brainstorm on the particular ‘needs to know’ (key DEMO and facts) and ‘know how’
needs of this group.  What problems are they likely to have in the field of financial management
and DEMO opportunities for development might they face where financial skills might be needed?
What barriers might there be to owners of the ‘type’ identified DEMO to attending the programme
and how does that affect the communication? DEMO the above in mind the brochure will be
written and may be appraised by different groups.
Another example is organising and selling a briefing DEMO to local entrepreneurs for the
above programme, in particular, covering forms of verbal and written communication relating to
processes of; attracting entrepreneurs to the workshop; creating the right environment for
communication when they arrive; DEMO and content of presentations/discussions designed to
excite and create interest; DEMO methods of ‘sealing the deal’.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus is upon the art of communication and engagement with different audiences, a key
component in the process of creating affectivity and co nativity in DEMO learning
processes.
4. Outcomes
50
This will result in an enhanced capacity to build promotional and learning DEMO with
different groups of participants and also an associated ability to communicate on a Know-How
and Need-to-Know basis with small firms.
51
17.  Use of Shadowing
1. What is Use of Shadowing?
Shadowing, as the term implies, is following and tracing the activity and DEMO of a person
over a period of time, from days to DEMO  In the entrepreneurial context it means undertaking
this in a certain DEMO with a certain set of objectives rather than just ‘learning the job’ – a context
within which it is commonly used.  The major objective, in the context of entrepreneurial
learning, is to gain insight into DEMO ways of doing things.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
To be most effective it is best constructed around the shadowed being given DEMO discrete set of
tasks focusing upon a carefully chosen aspect of ‘ways of doing things’.  If the ‘shadowing’ is with
the entrepreneur, then DEMO should be developed in such a way to be directly of value to the person
shadowed in terms of feedback.  This will also help with the process of gaining access and
permission from the entrepreneur.
Example: Shadowing of the entrepreneur for one week by a student.
An arrangement DEMO made for the student to be with the entrepreneur all the time he/she is at
work.  The student may also ask to have a morning debrief with the entrepreneur as to any
business-related activity carried DEMO ‘after hours’.  The focus of the exercise of value to the
DEMO is two-fold:
 - to analyse the use of time over the period
 - to analyse the forms of communication used
The DEMO will be fed back to the entrepreneur
To meet the objectives the student measures the time of the entrepreneur in different locations,
both DEMO and external to the workplace.  The time may also be measured DEMO terms of time
allocated to different activities/problems/issues.  Example time DEMO in briefing staff, time spent
with clients, time on administration, DEMO with suppliers etc.
Communication analysis exercises can be extremely useful.  In DEMO case the student begins with a
categorisation list in terms of a series of headings in an exercise book.  Categories will include:
 Form of communication (oral direct, telephone, internet, written)
 DEMO of communication (office, workplace elsewhere, external)
 Area of DEMO – main focus of communication – marketing, supply, finance, operations,DEMO
human resource/personnel etc
 Proactive – reactive/planned-unplanned
Analysis can be fed back to the entrepreneur enabling him/her to address an issue DEMO is almost
always of importance, namely time pressure and management.
The DEMO example underlines the importance of focus in shadowing and of ensuring utility to
the entrepreneur.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
52
The focus is upon the real community of practice and the creation DEMO empathy.  There is also a
strong emphasis upon the use of DEMO to the entrepreneur.
4.
Outcomes
Participants will gain substantial understanding of entrepreneurial ways of communicating and
doing things.  They will also gain insight into what will interest entrepreneurs and what they will
‘buy into’, a key issue in designing services to entrepreneurs.
53
18.  Use of Role Play
1. What is Use of Role Play?
The central aim is to put participants in the role of DEMO persons with whom they seek
to gain empathy.  The role player DEMO challenged to match all the known characteristics and
knowledge base of the chosen person.  The player is confronted by one or more persons either
playing other roles or by other participants questioning the chosen role-played character.
DEMO How is the exercise constructed?
It can be constructed in a wide variety of ways.  Within a business context, for example
 DEMO the way in which different organisations view a business proposal, individuals
DEMO role play venture capital personnel, angels, bankers, public authority grant DEMO or
large firms offering financial support to small?
 playing the role of a large company buyer interviewing a small business seeking to DEMO
onto the company’s central procurement list
 conducting a selling exercise with a potential buyer of a product or service
 conducting an interview DEMO a job (see below)
Example of Role Play – Job DEMO
During this exercise participants are given the opportunity to put into practice what they have up
learned about the behaviour of an entrepreneurial person.  The aim is to enhance the capacity of
participants to internalise and DEMO concepts of the entrepreneurial person.
For the purpose of this exercise participants are organised in groups of three.  One member of
the group acts as the interviewer, one as the interviewee and one as an observer.   Separate
instructions are given to each person.
Two rounds are played DEMO with separate instructions for each.  Different individuals play different
roles during DEMO two rounds.
Round 1
Instruction for Observer
You have to observe and read the behaviour of the interviewer and interviewee.
After the interview you DEMO report back on the entrepreneurial potential observed.
Use the checklist of entrepreneurial behaviour and attitudes as the guideline for observation and
reporting.
Instruction for DEMO
You are to interview a candidate for a position as Marketing Manager in your organisation which
is a franchise organisation for “quick print”.  You are the original entrepreneur behind the
franchise concept with, at least in your view, a great deal of success behind you.  In your DEMO
perception you are highly motivated towards success in the long term.  DEMO compete with your
own standards of excellence and not so much with other people.
The person you are looking for should be somebody with DEMO great deal of entrepreneurial ability
harnessed into a striving also to get co-operation from franchisees and other staff.
54
Instructions for Interviewee
You are to be interviewed for a position as DEMO Manager in a ‘quick print’ franchise.  You
are not particularly interested DEMO the position.   Your previous experience has been in the financial
function.  In applying for this position you are really taking a chance as the salary is a great deal
higher than your present income.  You are also interested in the perks and the possibility to travel
extensively DEMO use an expense account, something you have never had before.   DEMO
qualifications are good but all on the accounting and finance field.  DEMO are basically looking for a
position where you can quickly make a great deal of money.
Round 2
The group exchange roles with slightly DEMO instructions
Instructions for Observer
You have to observe and read the behaviour of the interviewer and interviewee.  After the
interview you will report back on the behaviour observed in term of entrepreneurial
characteristics.
Use the checklist DEMO entrepreneurial behaviour and attitudes as the guideline for observation and
reporting.
Instruction for Interviewer
You are to interview a candidate for a position as DEMO Manager in your organisation which
is a franchise organisation for ‘quick print’.  You are the original entrepreneur behind the
franchise concept with, at DEMO in your view, a great deal of success behind you.  In your own
perception you are highly motivated towards success in the long DEMO You compete with your
own standards of excellence and not so much with other people.
The person you are looking for should be somebody DEMO a great deal of entrepreneurial ability
harnessed into a striving also to get co-operation from franchisees and other staff.
Instructions for Interviewee
You are DEMO display as much entrepreneurial orientation and behaviour as possible during the
interview.  You are anxious to get the job because it is a logical step in your career and presents a
great personal challenge.
You are DEMO marketing specialist.  The job you are applying for is with a DEMO organisation in the
field of printing.  The job is described as DEMO of a ‘marketing manager’.  You are not sure what
the job DEMO although it is clear that, as far as salary is concerned, the job means a step forward
in your career.
In this exercise DEMO role play allows practice at using a framework for assessment of
entrepreneurial potential in a conventional job context.  The juxtaposition of two different types
of interviewee provides the basis for strengthening the analysis post-exercise.
3. Relevance DEMO Entrepreneurial Learning
This is learning by doing involving the practice in use of concepts learned.  Creativity and flair in
acting out roles is encouraged.  The whole exercise is dependent upon the use of empathy.  The
DEMO played demands imagination as to the characters portrayed.
55
4. Outcomes
Participants will have a strong frame of reference for use DEMO analysis of entrepreneurial
behaviour.  They will also have greater confidence and DEMO in articulating the views of others.
56
19. Use of Frames of Reference for Intuitive Decision making
1. What DEMO Use of frames of reference for Intuitive Decision Making?
A frame of reference in the context of entrepreneurial learning is a ‘mind map’ DEMO for
exploration of a particular phenomenon.  In the context of entrepreneurial DEMO such maps,
are the products of experience, enabling the entrepreneur DEMO make rapid, seemingly intuitive,
judgements.
2. How is the exercise DEMO?
The exercise is dependent upon the construction of a frame of reference by participants through
which a particular event might be analysed and DEMO made.  Such a frame may be
constructed by a process of DEMO facilitated by the educator without any prior
knowledge input – to test how participants see things and to encourage them to combine existing
knowledge.  Alternatively, following a knowledge input, for example, on assessing customer
potential, participants are asked to construct a frame for analysis.
1. Example 1: Creating a frame for assessing a business proposition.
Participants are asked – without any input – ‘If I (the facilitator) came to you DEMO advice about
starting a business, what kinds of questions would you DEMO me?’
Participants can be divided into groups for this exercise.
After 20 minutes the various views are fed back and the facilitator groups DEMO creates out of the
replies the reference of:
IDEA                                                   ABILITY
RESOURCE          MOTIVATION
ADMINISTRATION                           PLAN
Within this frame the DEMO feedbacks is accumulated so that the headings in the frame are
filled out.  The frame can then be reinforced in use by application to the participants if they are a
start up group, applied to a case or used as a basis for interviewing a simulated or real DEMO up.
2. Example 2: Creating a frame for business analysis on DEMO basis of knowledge input.
Participants are asked to imagine that they are going to visit a small/medium sized firm for half a
day.  They are asked the question: What would you look for during the visit in order to determine
whether the firm had a strong strategic DEMO?
The question is asked in the knowledge that the participants have earlier undertaken a
programme focused upon strategy.
Participants can be divided into DEMO for this question or the issue can be openly brainstormed
in class.
57
As in the above example the answers can be collated into a DEMO – or the participants can be
asked to suggest a frame within which they might logically place observations.  The end result
might be a frame, as below.
VISION AND DEGREE SHARED
PLANNED CAPACITY            STRENGTH OF ENVIRONMENTAL
TO IMPLEMENT VISION                             SCANNING
ABILITY DEMO SEE BUSINESS                       CAPACITY TO BRING FORWARD
THROUGH STAKEHOLDER                         THE FUTURE ON A ‘WHAT IF’
EYES                                                       BASIS
CUSTOMER FOCUS                                   COMPETITOR KNOWLEDGE
DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE OF OWN BUSINESS
The purpose of such an exercise DEMO to strengthen capacity to quickly apply knowledge.  It can
often be DEMO case that students have accumulated knowledge but not in a form that lends itself to
prompt application.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus DEMO upon stimulating capacity for intuitive decision making and the capacity to
accumulate and internalise knowledge in a way that can be transferred into long DEMO memory.
4. Outcomes
Participants will have enhanced capacity to organise knowledge in a manner that enables it to be
applied to different contexts.  They will have built confidence in their capacity in this respect.
They will DEMO have greater respect for experiential knowledge.
58
20.  Use of Psychometric Tests
1. What is Use of Psychometric Tests?
A psychometric test is a way of assessing a person’s ability DEMO personality in a measured and
structured way.  There are 3 main DEMO of tests: ability, personality and interest (although both
personality and DEMO tests are more like psychometric questionnaires).  Tests are frequently
used DEMO employers to help them in their recruitment process and are often used by careers
advisors.
It is also common for graduate employers to use DEMO tests as part of their selection
process.  They are used to DEMO out large number of applicants at an early stage and so save
employers both time and money.  A psychometric test can be used in teaching as a basis for
encouraging reflection and learning about the relevance DEMO personal attributes to enterprise
development.
Personality questionnaires are used to determine how people are likely to behave under various
conditions.  There are no right or wrong answers, and the questionnaires are usually completed
in your own time.  The best way to approach these questionnaires is to answer them as honestly
and straightforwardly as you can.  Personality questionnaires can also be used as self-assessment
tools to help you understand your preferences and how DEMO relate to your strengths and
possible areas for development.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The test can be administered online or with DEMO and pencil.  The test can be handed out prior
to a DEMO and scoring can be self administered.  The facilitator can use the DEMO in a number
of ways:
 to personalise learning
 to explore the underlying concepts and their validity and relationship to
entrepreneurship development.
DEMO to encourage participants to explore their personal reaction to results with peers and
critique the test and concepts accordingly
 to explore the relevance DEMO the concepts to wider issues of developing an enterprise
culture in society.  For example, how do bankers, local government officials, among other
DEMO, score on entrepreneurship psychometric tests and what are the
implications for DEMO development of the enterprise culture in society
The key concepts can be put before participants and debate encouraged.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Psychometric DEMO are particularly valuable for use with large groups where it is difficult to
encourage small group discussion.  Participants, for example, can discuss the results with the
person sitting next to them.  The reflections facilitated by the use of such tests lie at the heart of
personalisation of DEMO
59
4. Outcomes
Key outcomes include:



understanding of the DEMO of psychometric tests
the personalization of, and reflection upon, key aspects of entrepreneurial attributes
personal reappraisal of the desirability of pursuing an entrepreneurial DEMO
60
Example:
Use of the Durham University, UK - General Enterprising Tendency
(GET) Test
Introduction
The test has been designed to bring together DEMO measure a number of personal ‘tendencies’
commonly associated with the enterprising person.  These include: need for achievement; need
for autonomy; creative tendency; risk taking; and drive and determination.  The test was
designed as DEMO of the work of the Enterprise in Education and Learning Team within the
Foundation for Small and Medium Enterprise Development.   This work has DEMO concerned with
the development of Enterprise in schools, further and higher DEMO institutions.  There is
obviously a need to develop measures of enterprise DEMO purposes of assessment and perhaps also
to identify training needs.  The DEMO Enterprising Tendency Test embodies the enterprise
tendencies described above, expresses them DEMO statement form and measures enterprise
aptitudes against norms.
The test has been developed following research into a variety of measures used to determine
entrepreneurship DEMO enterprise.  It has been validated with a number of different groups DEMO
personnel and amended accordingly.   The aim during this research and development process has
been to develop a measure of enterprising tendency rather than DEMO entrepreneurial traits.
The GET Test may be of use in a variety of situations.  It might for example be used to measure
the enterprise of personnel involved in providing support to business, social and community
enterprise.  It might be used to measure the enterprise of those wishing to set up in business.  It
might be used, just as importantly, by employers concerned to foster enterprising individuals
within their own organisations.  It may be used in the recruitment and selection of personnel.  It
may be used to identify changes that have taken place as a result DEMO training or exposure to
certain structured situations designed to encourage enterprise.
A great deal of research has been undertaken into the process of enterprise DEMO  Much
of this in the past has concentrated on the personality DEMO the entrepreneur in attempting to
identify entrepreneurial traits.  It has been DEMO that these desires, drives and attitudes ensure
that an individual has DEMO willingness to take responsibility, the determination to complete
projects, the creativity which will lead to innovation and a healthy appreciation of risk.  This
research, much of which stems from the work of Atkinson and McClelland in the 1960s is
controversial, particularly in respect of whether measures taken are of ‘inherent’ as opposed to
‘learned’ traits.  The Durham research, DEMO by the University Grants Committee, extensively
reviewed the literature and a DEMO of related tests.    Out of this review and out of DEMO
experiment came the GET test.
This explains how the test can be administered and the results usefully collated.

21 Use of Locus of Control Tests
1. What is Use of DEMO of Control Tests?
The purpose of the test in the context of entrepreneurship education is to help participants to
understand how they see DEMO world and in particular how entrepreneurs see the world.  The test
DEMO below is based upon the work of the psychologist Rotter (1966) and his measure of
Locus of Control.  This test is designed to measure the degree of autonomy that individuals feel
they have in terms DEMO making things happen.  Those with high scores are those said to DEMO
strongly that they can shape the world the way they wish.  DEMO with low scores can be
characterised as those more likely to believe that the world shapes them.  The research strongly
supports the view that entrepreneurs score more highly than the population at large.  But
whether this reflects personality or the results of exposure to a particular environmentally
dictated DEMO of life’ is open to debate.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Like most tests of a psychometric nature it can be used DEMO the basis for a class discussion, in this
case about the DEMO of the entrepreneur with the test being handed out and completed before
the group meets.  The results can be collated anonymously and used for group discussion.
Individuals can be asked to discuss their result with another DEMO or merely reflect on their
own result in the light of class discussion.  The main focus of any facilitated discussion is upon
why entrepreneurs might see the world in this way and what influences them, Research readings
can be discussed.  The main advantage of the use of the test in entrepreneurial learning is that it
is suitable for use with DEMO groups of participants (see the example below).
3. Relevance to DEMO Learning
Completion of the test itself is not a particularly entrepreneurial process.  Its value lies not in the
results or debate on the construct validity of the test but in: the process of engagement of
participants; the degree of personal involvement induced by completion of the test; DEMO almost
certain emotional impact it will have on the individual; and DEMO the capacity it creates for lively
engagement about concept, relevance and DEMO
4. Outcomes
Participants will have insight into the way entrepreneurs see the world and will understand why
they see it as so.  They will also have understanding of the implications for society in terms of one
DEMO of creating Entrepreneurial Mindsets
72
Example
Participants are given the following instruction;
This scale is designed DEMO tell you a little bit more about how certain important occurrences in
society affect different individuals.
The activity will be carried out in three DEMO:
Step 1
Complete the attached scale according to the instructions preceding it
Step 2
Score your own responses according to the scoring system DEMO out
Step 3
We will then discuss the results in terms of:
a. Which individual differences are revealed by the results?
b. DEMO do the individual scores tell us about our individual and group’s approach to life?
c. In what way might we wish to change DEMO to life?
The Test
Guidance
This is a questionnaire to find out how certain important occurrences in society influence
different people.
Each item DEMO the attached questionnaire consists of two alternatives marked ‘a’ and ‘b’.  DEMO
choose one statement from each pair (and only one); you DEMO be convinced that it is so, as far as
you are DEMO   Ensure that you choose the one of which you believe that it is more true,
rather than the one which you think DEMO should choose, or the one which you would rather like
to DEMO true.  This is a measure of personal conviction; there are obviously no right or wrong
answers.
Your answers must be filled in on DEMO separate answer sheet.
Please answer the items carefully, but do not DEMO too much time of any of them.  Ensure that
you give DEMO answer to each choice.   Write ‘a’ or ‘b’ next to the number of the item on the answer
sheet, depending on the statement which you believe to be most true.
In some cases you may DEMO that you believe both statements, or none of them.   In DEMO a case
ensure that you choose the one which you are more convinced about.
React to each item separately when you make a choice; don’t be influenced by your previous
choices.
Please proceed.

22.  Use of Relationship Learning
1. What is Use of Relationship Learning?
Relationship Learning is arguably at the crux of the capacity of DEMO entrepreneurial venture to
survive and grow.  It is undoubtedly the case DEMO most of the learning of the individual
entrepreneur takes place in the management of relationships with all stakeholders necessary for
the survival of the DEMO  The essence of managing the independent business (and indeed
many other types of business or organisations) can be described as the capacity to manage
interdependency with stakeholders on a day to day basis under conditions DEMO more or less
uncertainty.  The reputation and the Intangible Assets of DEMO business are built up largely on this
basis.  The process of DEMO this takes place was described in the Pedagogical Note xxxxx).
Relationship Learning is the process by which stakeholders (customers, suppliers, channel
representatives, financial agencies, professional services, family, partners, workforce, local and
DEMO government, regulatory and other agencies, including the media and education bodies),
are engaged in a two way learning process to mutual benefit.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants are divided into groups DEMO four to six.  They are asked to divide in turn, into one sub-
group representing an entrepreneurial stakeholder as noted above and the DEMO the
entrepreneur facing the development of a relationship – existing or new.  For example, it could
be a banker faced with a new DEMO proposition or funding for a new development
from an existing client.  DEMO could be a large company buyer facing an entrepreneur seeking to get
on to a buying list.  Or it could be just an existing regular customer for a small firm supplying it
with subcontracting services on DEMO regular basis.
Example - Building learning and education relationship
Company X is a small electrical subcontracting firm supplying services to a large locally owned
DEMO Y on a regular basis
GROUP 1.  The Subcontractor owner - DEMO of X – Educating the Customer
-
-
-
-
-
What does my customer need to know about me - in general and DEMO terms of the specific
transactions we undertake?
Where might be the gaps and how might I fill them?
How is s/he DEMO likely to learn about me and my business?
How might I improve the process?
How might I bring forward the future for DEMO customer?
GROUP 2.  The Subcontractor owner manager of X – DEMO from the Customer
-
-
-
-
-
What do we need to know about the customer in general and to improve transactions?
DEMO are likely to be the gaps and how might we fill them?
What are the processes by which we currently learn?
How DEMO we improve them?
How can we learn more about their future?
78
GROUPS 3 AND 4 Can explore the same questions playing the role DEMO the builder Y
All four groups can then get together and explore how they might collectively develop the
learning relationship and what results this DEMO have.
As part of the above process participants may be asked to explore how they might use third
parties in the education and learning DEMO  For example ‘can I use my banker to educate my
customers DEMO to the solidity and reliability of my business – how?’
Another useful addition would be to ask the groups to explore how the DEMO of IT might enhance
the learning and educating process, for example DEMO:
 building up a profile of an individual customer
 online interaction with the customer
 improving speed of response
 joint problem DEMO
 sharing market/customer analysis
 sharing new market development using in-house data
 environment scanning - common threats and opportunities
3. Relevance to DEMO Learning
The aim is to simulate the way in which entrepreneurs learn from relationships – a process
central to the development of entrepreneurial behaviours.  It is not necessary for the participants
to have experience of the DEMO or of the relationships in the industry.  The exercise is to
DEMO them gain insight into the processes likely to be involved, create DEMO with
entrepreneurial ways of doing things and understand how trust based relationships might be
built up and transactions costs reduced.
4. Outcomes
Participants will DEMO how to engage with stakeholders.  They will also understand that they
DEMO to assess their own knowledge around the degree to which it fosters sound relationship
education and learning.
79
23.  Use of Immersion
1. What is Use of Immersion?
It is clearly evident to those who work closely with owner managers of DEMO Businesses,
particularly at the start up stage that they ‘learn by doing’ rather than by study and analysis of
large amounts of formal DEMO and periods of reflection.  In practice this does not mean
that DEMO jump wildly into a business but that they gradually immerse themselves in the
‘community of practice’.  It has lately been discovered that this process – one labelled
‘effectuation’ has also been the hallmark of the start DEMO of many large US businesses in the top
Fortune 500 at their start up point.  Somewhat controversially the business plan is not a
metaphor for this process although it remains a central focus of much teaching DEMO
entrepreneurship.
How to simulate the ‘immersion’ process in Entrepreneurship programmes remains challenging.
For purposes of this note it is assumed that this immersion process DEMO elements of risk
reduction, strategic thinking and learning under pressure.  This can be simulated in a number of
ways.
2. How is the DEMO constructed?
The immersion process can be simulated at a number of levels.
Incremental practice of learning
The hallmark of an immersions entrepreneurial programme DEMO the complete commitment to the
practice of every
item of formal learning, reflection and ‘doing it again and again’ until it is right and acceptable in
the ‘real world’ (adding tacit value to explicit knowledge).  This has major implications for
programme design and resource.   Standard in-house forms of assessment of progress in learning
and then moving on are DEMO  Presentations of business plans are no substitute for
engaging the key DEMO in practice.  A key example would be to eschew formal market
DEMO for a product/service idea in favour of getting into contact directly with as many
customers as possible, presenting and learning and modifying until the idea has been shaped by
the real world response and the DEMO honed by repeat practice.
Constant exploration of alternatives to minimise risk
At a start-up stage to massage the proposal constantly to limit exposure to DEMO by repeated use
of the question – Can this be done in another way?, using less resource and involving less
exposure.  An example might be in a proposed manufacturing context to maximise the
subcontracting of DEMO product focusing resource and commitment on the customer and the
market.
Strategic ‘What if’ scenario exercises
The use of strategic ‘what if’ scenario groups.  This involves dividing a group of participants with a
business idea into DEMO groups and brainstorming in turn on ‘what if’ scenarios.  What if DEMO sales
target is not met? What if a customer asks for DEMO different?  What if the major customer
does not pay? What DEMO your bank refuses to maintain its overdraft? What if your supplier DEMO out
of business? What if you find someone already is doing DEMO you are doing? What if you are ill?
What if DEMO lover leaves you or gets a job somewhere else?  How do I know when to get out of a
business? How do I do it? All of these become key strategic questions and core components of
this approach.
80
Anticipating problem exercises
The above approach, in turn, can be built DEMO a process of anticipating problems and working on
how to deal with them and prevent them.  Thus knowledge delivered takes a problem solving
format, bringing forward items that may occur in an early immersion experience.  DEMO ‘risks’ are
anticipated.  A dozen or so ‘reasons why firms are DEMO out of business can be explored and
strategies for anticipation and problem prevention discussed (see Annex)
Entrepreneur mentors
The use of entrepreneur mentors on an ongoing basis is an important way of simulating an
immersion DEMO  They, rather than professionals are likely to ask the ‘street-wise’ questions.
The use of entrepreneurs in this way is best undertaken on a DEMO to one basis if honest and open
appraisal is to be sought.  It is arguably also important that they are not ‘trained’ for this process.
Brainstorming Strategic Know-Who
An important component in simulating the immersion process DEMO engagement in strategic know-
who relationship development exercises focused upon the issue of building trust.  This can be
prefaced by brainstorming exercises in order to profile ‘what makes a good’ customer, supplier,
accountant, lawyer, banker, consultant etc.  This process will result in a series of DEMO that
can then be used for ‘real life’ profiling.  Such profiling DEMO are not just organisational but
also ‘people oriented’.  People choices are DEMO core component of immersion strategies and indeed
of problem anticipation.  The DEMO profile criteria that emerges that can then be used for
appraisal of real world stakeholders.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
All of the above DEMO are focused upon developing capacity to learn by doing, by problem
DEMO and by strategic thinking within a simulation of, or real exposure DEMO, the community of
practice.
4. Outcomes
Participants will be better prepared DEMO learn from immersions experienced in the future.  When
combined with the DEMO of other guides, for example, those on relationship learning,
networking and intuitive decision making, they will be better equipped to cope with making
sense of exposure to learning under pressure.
81
ANNEX
Brainstorming on anticipating Early Immersion Problems in start-up
Participants are taken DEMO the process of exploring how each of these might arise, how DEMO
can be ‘early warning’ detected and how they might be dealt with.  Examples and anecdotes will
need to be prepared.
Recent start ups may get into difficulty because they:
Invest too much in assets
Attempt DEMO much too soon
Have an inadequate equity base
Neglect basic systems
Over-trade
Stick too rigidly to plans
Have the wrong mix of finance
Forget DEMO tax
Make inadequate contractual agreements
Make inadequate bank arrangements
Don’t talk regularly to their banker to explain unforeseen events
Under-price
Confuse profit with cash
DEMO about overheads
Don’t listen to customers
Become over-dependent on too few customers
Pick poor customers
Don’t get paid
Have poor receivables management
Neglect family
DEMO working capital need
Forget about salary
Neglect supply quality and supplier base
Organise time badly
Neglect Know -Who
Take too much out of the DEMO
Fall out with partners
Neglect business viability criteria - profit/cash/salary
82
24.  Use of Achievement Motivation
(Following the work of McClelland and DEMO et al.)
1. What is Use of Achievement Orientation?
The theory of Achievement Motivation attracted much academic debate in the 1970s and DEMO,
however much of the work, with its focus upon Entrepreneurial DEMO, has been dismissed in
more recent times, but the education and training approaches based upon this concept are still
used widely throughout Asia DEMO Entrepreneurship Development Programmes (EDPs) as are many
of the psychological constructs.  The concept has also been developed by the McBer Corporation
in the USA as the basis for a range of senior executive development programmes.  Key
components of the model are described below in a normative fashion.
DEMO Achievement Motivation Learning concept embraces a wide range of entrepreneurial
behaviours and attitudes of persons.  These include:
i. A high orientation towards success and excellence
ii. A desire to improve on earlier achievements.   There DEMO constantly a lookout for doing things
better, quicker, more effectively.   Fantasies centre around increasing effectiveness and
improving achievements
iii. An interest in DEMO new ways in which to excel and have success.  Without this DEMO really
necessary, there is a constant search for opportunities for achievement
DEMO The pursuit of standards of excellence in order to determine personal effectiveness via:
- Benchmark re competition with others
- Use of external DEMO of performance, e.g. examination grades, profit percentages,
etc
- Development of internal, self-determined, personal norms of excellence and
success
Programmes based DEMO this concept therefore seek to develop attitudinal characteristics of
people with a high need for achievement including:
 Risk taking
 Personal responsibility
DEMO Feedback
 Initiative in researching the environment.
Risk Taking
The individual with an achievement orientation is fundamentally orientated towards average
risks.   Low risk DEMO are avoided.  In these situations it is easy to achieve success DEMO very
little satisfaction is gained from such success.  Extremely high risk DEMO are also avoided.  It
may be possible to obtain high satisfaction DEMO these situations the probability of success is too
small to be attractive and it may even be possible to dismiss success as being due DEMO pure luck.  A
situation with a medium risk represents sound entrepreneurial DEMO with a high enough
probability of success and enough challenge to let individuals feel that they will have to exert
themselves against the possibility DEMO failure.
83
Personal Responsibility (to see things through)
As per the entrepreneurial Locus of Control construct (see Guide 21), an individual with an
achievement orientation feels that events can be controlled rather than that merely being
DEMO by external influences.  There is an orientation to start things, cause things to happen and
create change in the environment.  There is a search for new, original innovative activities.  Hard
work stimulates a desire DEMO feedback.  Once a problem is solved there is a loss of DEMO  There
is a constant search for new successes and new solutions DEMO old problems.  There is a capacity for
strategically assessing and planning DEMO events rather than leaving them to chance.
The individual with an achievement orientation wants to carry personal responsibility.  He wants
to be able to initiate activities and take decisions in situation where he, in the end, can claim the
results for himself and enjoy the satisfaction of the achievements.  He/she has enough self-
confidence to take credit for success as well as blame for failure of activities.  He/she does not
necessarily like suggestions from other people as to what to think or DEMO to do and is not a
conformist under social pressure.
These characteristics do not imply that the achievement orientated individuals can only act alone.
DEMO does imply that they are happier in jobs where there is individual freedom and responsibility.
They can work effectively in co-operative situations, as long as they can play a determining role in
at least some of DEMO decision making.
Feedback
Individuals with an achievement orientation want concrete, immediate DEMO direct feedback
about their performance.  They want both positive and negative DEMO i.e.  indications that
their efforts are leading towards success, as well as information about what is leading to failure.
Such feedback is performance DEMO  Money can be seen as a concrete symbol of success
rather DEMO as a motivating factor.  It is an indication how well he DEMO is doing and does not
necessarily motivate the individual to work harder.
Researching the Environment
Individuals with achievement orientation show a great deal of DEMO in exploring and
researching the environment.  This ties in with efforts DEMO find new opportunities for high levels of
achievement.   While new situations for achievement are sought they are also utilised.  Energetic
activity is a characteristic.   The achiever does not work hard in all situations but DEMO selective in
working hard in situations which are challenging and where the possibilities of success and failure
are present.   Routine tasks are not DEMO or enjoyed.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The Concept of Achievement Orientation/Motivation is very broad and embraces a range of
entrepreneurial DEMO and attitudes.  Equally it involves a wide range of pedagogical
techniques, some of which are described below.  The pedagogical activities associated with the
construct, in addition to the above include role play, interview techniques DEMO games.  There are
three examples provided in the Annex.
84
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
All of the components of the Achievement DEMO model can be seen as highly relevant to
pedagogical processes of entrepreneurial learning.  Most of the associated exercises serve to
create insight into the key characteristics of the entrepreneur, stimulate imaginative behaviour
and enhance capacity to see the world through entrepreneurial eyes.
4. Outcomes
Participants will have a DEMO clear view of the dominant characteristics associated with
Achievement Orientation and will have internalised key aspects of the related behaviours.  They
will also have insight into ways of stimulating them.
85
ANNEX
Example 1
Achievement Motivation Assessment Role Play: Job Interview
Instructions
This exercise aims to follow up on an introduction to Achievement Motivation.  Its aim is to
enable the participants to put into practice the learning DEMO the behaviour of an achievement
orientated person.  Participants form groups of DEMO  One member of the group will play the
role of an DEMO, another, the interviewee and the other as observer.  Separate instructions
DEMO given to each person.
Two rounds may be played – with separate instructions for each.   Different individuals will play
different roles during the DEMO rounds.
ROUND ONE
Instructions for the Observer
You have to observe and read the behaviour of the interviewer and interviewee.  After the
interview you will report back on the behaviour observed in achievement orientation terms.
Use DEMO four attitudes of the achievement orientated behaviour.  You may wish to DEMO a
simple scoring system.
Instructions for the Interviewer
You are to interview a candidate for a position as Stakeholder Relations Development and
Marketing Manager DEMO your organisation which is a Centre for Enterprise in a university/college.
You are the Centre Director with, at least in your view, DEMO great deal of success behind you.  In
your own perception you DEMO highly motivated towards success in the long term.  You compete
with DEMO own standards of excellence and not so much with other people.  DEMO person you are
looking for should be somebody with a great deal of achievement motivation, harnessed into a
striving to also get the co-operation of subordinates.
Instructions to Interviewees
You are to be interviewed for a DEMO as Stakeholder Relations Development and Marketing
Manager in the Nirvana College Centre for Enterprise.
You are not madly keen on the position and your DEMO experience has been in finance.  In
applying for this position you DEMO really taking a chance as the salary is a great deal higher than
your present income.  You are also interested in the perks of academic life and the possibility to
travel extensively around the region and DEMO beyond.
Your qualifications are good but all on the accounting and finance field.  You are basically looking
for a position where you can make more money and launch yourself off into a more lucrative
career in DEMO
86
ROUND TWO
Instructions for Observers
You have to observe and read the DEMO of the interviewer and interviewee.  After the
interview you will report DEMO on the behaviour observed in achievement orientation terms.
Use the four attitudes of the achievement orientated behaviour.  You may wish to introduce a
simple scoring system.
Instructions to Interviewer
You are to interview a candidate for DEMO position as Stakeholder Relations Development and
Marketing Manager in your organisation which is a Centre for Enterprise in a university/college.
You are the DEMO Director with, at least in your view, a great deal of success behind you.  In
your own perception you are highly motivated towards success in the long term.  You compete
with your own standards of excellence and not so much with other people.
The person you are DEMO for should be somebody with a great deal of achievement motivation,
harnessed into a striving to also get the co-operation of subordinates.
Instructions DEMO Interviewees
You are to display as much achievement orientated behaviour as possible during the interview.
You are anxious to get the job because it DEMO a logical step in your career and presents a great
personal challenge.
You are a marketing specialist.  The job you are applying for is with an organisation that is
perceived as a regional centre for excellence.  The job is described as that of a ‘Stakeholder
Relations and Development DEMO manager’.  You are not sure what the job entails although
it DEMO clear that, as far as salary is concerned, the job means a step forward in your career.
Following the role plays the group DEMO asked by the facilitator to reflect on the contextual
relevance of the Achievement characteristics monitored in the interviews observed, how easy it
was to monitor these and whether they can spot these in future situations or DEMO act them out.
87
Example 2
Developing a College-wide Student Enterprise Group
The end result of DEMO activity will be a fully developed programme for the proposed activities of
the members of a currently rather weak Student Enterprise Association.  The aim of the
programme is to maximise the achievement motivation of the future DEMO of this
organisation through the various planned activities in the programme.
You can assume that a medium or average degree of achievement orientation is DEMO present
in the members.
Step One
The participants are divided into groups of 4.  Each group develops a programme of activities
stretching over 12 months, 3 evenings per week plus two weekends per month designed to
achieve the aim as set out above.   Every activity must be DEMO at the development of some
aspect of achievement orientation.  Ensure that DEMO aspect of the programme is designed to
appeal to the total group.
Step Two
Participants now meet in groups of 12 (joining up 3 former groups).  During these meetings
consensus must be reached on the contents of a year programme for the maximisation of
achievement orientation of DEMO members of the Association.
Each group must be able to motivate the contents of their proposed programme.  Optimal use
must obviously be made of the contents of the programme developed by earlier group members.
Each group DEMO appoint a spokesman to present as effectively as possible to proposed
programme to the full class of participants and other teams.
The Facilitator will DEMO use the session to appraise the degree to which it has been possible to
embody the Achievement Motivation characteristics in the Plans and may DEMO to expand and
brainstorm on further ideas.
88
Example 3
Making imaginative use of Achievement Motivation Constructs
Instructions
Part 1
DEMO exercise can be carried out in small groups or on an individual basis.  It is a test of
comprehension of the reasons why people act in a certain way.  For each of 4 individuals noted
below a characteristic behaviour pattern is mentioned.   The aim is to harvest DEMO as to
why they behave in that way.  For each description DEMO participants are asked to consider:
1. What kind of individual is this
2. What he/she wants to do
3. What the results DEMO his/her behaviour will be
If they can think of more than one reason, give only the one which they regard as the most
probable.   Write your answers in the vacant spaces.   Use about DEMO minutes for each description.
1. John always tries something new.

Instructions
Part 2
The general instructions are the same as above.   DEMO difference is that participants have to write
as much achievement orientation into the stories as possible.   The description of the individual
must be DEMO with achievement orientation.   The story nevertheless has to be integrated
and not nonsensical.   About 10 minutes can be spent on each item.

At the end of the exercise the facilitator can discuss with the group the influences upon how DEMO
see and interpret events and how an entrepreneurial person might see them.

25.  Use of Personality Selling Exercises – The Balloon Debate
1. What is Use of Balloon Debate?
The Balloon Debate is a personal DEMO exercise.  Each participant assumes a character.  This may
be an entrepreneur, and historical figure, a priest or indeed a person of any DEMO, famous or
merely generic type (for example a housewife).  DEMO person assumed is to have the qualities to
establish a new world embodying new values and ways of doing things.  The person can be dead
or alive, fictional or non - fictional and from any walk of life.  It is an exercise in imaginative
thinking.  All the DEMO are going up in a hot air balloon to escape from a world falling apart
below.  A planet up there is waiting for a new leader.  The purpose of the exercise is to enable
each character assumed to argue/sell themselves as the best person to lead this DEMO world.
Progressively the participants are eliminated by a voting process until only one person is left in
the balloon – the future world leader.  One example might set the objective as being the leader
of a DEMO entrepreneurial society.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
After a brief introduction, each participant is asked to assume a character.
Round 1.
Each is then given 5 minutes to prepare a one minute speech.  The speech aims to sell themselves
as the person with the vision, the leadership qualities and character to build a new world.  After
the speeches a vote is taken to select the top 5 (say out of a group of 20).  One cannot obviously
vote for oneself.
Round 2.
Each of the remaining participants make a 30 second speech aimed DEMO destroying any arguments
put forward by the others – they are not at this stage promoting themselves.
Round 3.
Each character then makes a DEMO second speech defending themselves and making a final
statement as to why they are the future leader of the world and better than the DEMO The last
sentence must be a real rallying cry.
Round 4.
This can be a 1 minute rapid fire hot seat of each candidate DEMO the remaining participants,
There is then a final vote to select the new world leader.
Round 5.
This is a post mortem discussion DEMO by the facilitator as to why the final leader was chosen –
bringing out aspects of personality, persuasive argument and presentation.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is essentially a personal selling exercise.  It brings out the importance of the
entrepreneurial personality.  The emphasis is upon personal projection and the ability to
articulate convincing argument under pressure.  In an entrepreneurial real world situation
customers and stakeholders are ‘buying’ the personality and DEMO capacity of the ‘seller’.
Projection of self belief, engagement of the DEMO, and personal charisma are dominant.  The
argument is often of less importance.
93
4. Outcomes
The key outcome is the realisation that stakeholders in an DEMO world ‘buy’ the person
as much as the product.   The two are inseparable.
94
26.  Use of Finding Opportunities (Ideas for Business)
1. What DEMO Use of Finding Opportunities (Ideas for business)?
This is a process of focusing participant attention on how ideas emerge in the market DEMO to
solve problems or grasp opportunities.  It can be argued that DEMO key aspect of entrepreneurial
behaviour is to see problems as opportunities.  DEMO exercise also aims to focus the group on how
all products and services can be seen as combinations of meeting needs and that thinking
DEMO this process can be a key component of the opportunity identification process.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The exercise can be divided DEMO three parts.
The first part aims to demonstrate how all products and services meet combinations of needs and
that exploration of this process can DEMO a means for finding new opportunities.
The second part explores the process of identifying opportunities from problems
The third part provides participants with a DEMO of simple ways into business and asks them to
explore these.
All Products and Services as combinations of needs.
To demonstrate the point that DEMO products/services are combinations of needs, the participants
are asked to DEMO on the needs met by different products/services.  For example they DEMO
asked to write down as many needs that they perceive a sofa could meet that might be in the
minds of a potential customer (this latter condition rules out the fantasy answers including new
kinds of DEMO rockets to the moon etc).  A prize can be given DEMO the first person to write down
12 needs.
The facilitator then takes up all the answers on a flip chart and will end up DEMO a list as below:
Needs a sofa can meet
Filling space
Saving space
Storage
Non-inflammable
Durable
Aesthetic
Status
Seating capacity
Convert to bed
DEMO
Easily moved
Feels warm/soft
Easy to match
Can work on it
Can eat on it
Can drink on it
Resists animal fur
Can DEMO feet up
Room divider
Firm or soft
Versatile seating
Bespoke seating
Period
Innovative
Cheap/expensive
Sturdy for kids
Change fabric
Gets through door
Colour DEMO
Easily cleanable
Washable fabric
Non-fading
Participants are then asked to describe the significance of this.  What will emerge with good
facilitation is that different sofas meet different combinations of needs and are therefore aimed
at different DEMO of customers.  Rich newly married/partnered will seek different combinations
from DEMO poorer people with young families living in confined spaces etc.  Retired DEMO
persons will also have different sets of needs.  Participants can be DEMO as to where they may
see new combinations for new sets of customers.
95
The same exercise can be undertaken with a whole range of other DEMO and services.  The
facilitator needs to think about this in advance DEMO prepare for possible responses.
Participants can then be given examples of how new products and services enter the market by
processes of
Meeting Previously DEMO needs?
Needs being better met?
More needs being met?
Different combinations of needs?
All of the above can be brainstormed.
DEMO Problems as Opportunities
To explore this, participants can be grouped and DEMO to brainstorm/identify recent personal or
other observed experiences where there have been problems or opportunities.  For example, on
holidays, at work, DEMO clubs, in the home, in the community, in leisure pursuits DEMO and identify
opportunities for enterprises that might be set up to solve problems or grasp opportunities.
These can then be presented in a ‘sales DEMO style.
96
27.  Use of Ways into Business
1. What is Use of Ways into Business?
Participants are given lists of ways of getting into DEMO as shown below and given examples to
stimulate brainstorming.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants may then be divided into small groups DEMO given (or select) one or more of the list
below.   They may brainstorm on their selection or, as a longer project exercise they can be asked
to go out and investigate the potential and DEMO with ideas.  These are then presented in a
persuasive manner to DEMO rest of the group.  The best – most convincing - presentation DEMO then
be rewarded.
1. Licensing - visit trade shows-advertise-read trade journals-approach foreign companies-
contact agents- approach embassies
2. Franchise - view international franchise magazines-approach DEMO banks-find franchise
consultants-read business journals
3. Rebuilding and re manufacturing products - find products that you can rob for others, for
example,  bicycle frames to  make trailers or making go carts out of lawn mowers
4. Purchasing or assembling for others - find products where assembly is DEMO out
parts and assemble/look for items that are bulky to transport and can be transported in a
collapsed form and assembled
5. Taking DEMO little bit of a large market - find a growing market such as jeans, stationary and air
conditioning or computer parts
6. Catering for left behind markets - look for good companies changing products rapidly and DEMO
what are leaving behind and look for industries that are going for up-to-date-ness
7. Adding value to existing products - brainstorm on products, for example holidays, tennis
balls, tennis racquets, bespoke clothing
8. Substituting material in existing products - find materials that much change because of
environment DEMO, for example; flame proof fabrics and furnishing materials, plastic
pipes.
DEMO Becoming a supplier to a producer - approach existing producers to identify supply problems,
look at tender lists, approach purchasing agent
10. Import replacement - examine import catalogues, go shopping for foreign goods, contact
DEMO agents for stores, look at import stats, and identify expensive imported goods.
11. Inventing a product to meet a need in the market DEMO - examine closely products that you
know, brainstorm on problems and DEMO
12. Second try situations - find failures and look for reasons.  DEMO for magazines, run adverts and
watch press for failures
13. Imitating DEMO products - look at what is selling well, look abroad[ Hong DEMO for
successful products and services
14. Transferring concepts from one industry to another - find a problem that has been solved
elsewhere, for example customised credit cards.
15. Marketing someone else's product - look for DEMO marketed products, contact embassies
and trade associations, look at venture magazines
16. Taking a patent opportunity - go to a patent office, look for a patent consultant, advertise
17. Import distribution and agent - read trade journals, contact foreign embassies, join
associations
18. Export distribution - DEMO associations and producers, contact -external chambers and
consulates
97
19. Becoming a distributor or agent for someone else's product - DEMO for companies keen to
expand but without a sales force; look DEMO products that are distributed to a wide variety of
small outlets, DEMO associations.  Look at trade journals and newspaper ads
20. Discount selling DEMO look for bankrupt companies, companies with excess stock, manufactures
with 'DEMO'.  Contact sales agents, liquidators, stockists and distributors
21. Find DEMO unique  or niche group and tailor a product to them - DEMO special groups within a
large batch of purchasers of a product or service  and segment[ vacation groups ], upper class
new tastes
22. DEMO existing products to a new market - look abroad for things that people buy and might
buy in your own country and not yet DEMO, identify locally made products that have
potential in wider markets
23. DEMO advantage of market switches - look for problems with new products and services,
analyse changes in consumer spending and tastes
24. Packaging - DEMO for unpackaged products.  Look for poorly packaged products, look for
packaging that is unfriendly to the environment
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The DEMO is focused substantially on discovery and exploratory learning processes involving
idea generation and evaluation as well as presentation.  It builds upon the personal experience of
participants and it also can induce high levels of humour.
4. DEMO
The central desired outcome – which can be tested – is that participants have an enhanced
capacity to see problems as opportunities and have DEMO of reference available for appraising
them.
98
28.  Use of Leveraging the Student Interest
1. What is Use of Leveraging the Student Interest?
In the University/College context a key DEMO is to create wide awareness across all disciplinary
areas of the relevance of entrepreneurial learning and programmes.  Leveraging the student
interest to create staff interest is a major component of a ‘whole university’ strategy.  Not all
students will have an interest in starting a business or indeed a DEMO so to do.  All, however,
will have some interest in their personal development and in their capacity to make an impact in
DEMO job market.  The exercise below aims to focus participant attention on DEMO relevance of
‘established’ entrepreneurial attributes and behaviours to their future ‘life-world’.  DEMO also can be
used to encourage them to reflect on the university/college contribution to this future
2. How is the exercise constructed?
DEMO exercise consists of the use of two Likert scale questionnaires (see DEMO).  They can be used
as an ‘in-class’ instrument or sent DEMO electronically to a wider student body.  Both questionnaires
are easily completed DEMO a class.  Each will take only a few minutes.  Questionnaire 1 asks the
students to score the perceived relevance of a number of DEMO attributes and
behaviours to their future work, social and family experience.  Questionnaire 2 asks them to use
the same scale to indicate how DEMO university/college experience has served to enhance these
attributes and behaviours.  DEMO important distinction, to be explained carefully, is the difference
between what has been enhanced by the formal university disciplinary learning process as
opposed DEMO the wider experience of university life.
The questionnaires are administered in sequence and the second one is introduced after some
discussion of meanings from DEMO first answers.
If the instruments are used as a ‘class’ exercise then they should be prefaced by a class
discussion/brainstorming on the attributes DEMO behaviours associated with being
‘entrepreneurial’.  The major headings in the questionnaire DEMO be drawn out by this process.
There can also be some discussion as to who they are relevant to – in what career contexts DEMO
although this is best left until after the completion of the first questionnaire.  After the
questionnaire is completed the participants are asked to draw a connecting line linking up their
‘scores’ so that here is a DEMO profile.  The facilitator can then go through the questions asking
for DEMO and facilitating discussion of why they were scored in this way.  DEMO is obviously
impossible to collate scores in a live situation.  But DEMO is possible for the facilitator to ask who
scored a six or seven and then pick up on reasons why, similarly with scores below the median
level.
Discussion on each attribute and its contexts can then DEMO facilitated.
After adequate discussion the second questionnaire can be handed out and a similar discussion
facilitated as to the reasons why the university experience DEMO high or low.  Comparisons can
be made with the impression of DEMO personal scores.  This is perhaps best done through small
group discussion.  Small group discussion can also be used to bring out explanations for
DEMO  Full group debate can be focused upon different contexts for entrepreneurial
DEMO – Who needs to be entrepreneurial? (Doctors, police, religious leaders, local
government, bankers etc).  If desired this can lead further discussion of the changing
environment and complexity and uncertainty and how everyone DEMO being affected in some way.
This might be the focus for further sessions.
99
The questionnaires are completed anonymously and can be collected in, analysed and used
carefully for discussion with university/college staff.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial DEMO
The exercise is designed to bring out the relevance of entrepreneurial behaviours and attributes
to wider contexts.  It also deliberately builds from the perspective of the participants, giving them
ownership of the discussion and allowing them to benchmark their own views and experiences
with others in a non- DEMO environment.
4. Outcomes
The major participant outcome is that they will gain a perspective on the wider relevance of the
entrepreneurial paradigm and will DEMO better able to take a personal perspective on this.  The data
DEMO also be used by the facilitator to leverage interest in the university/college in the broader
cross university relevance of entrepreneurial learning.

29.  Use of Start up Frames, Stages of Start-up.  Tasks and Learning Needs
1. What is Use of Start up Frames and Stages DEMO Start-up?
A new venture proposition can be appraised under 6 key headings:
THE
IDEA
THE
ABILITY
MOTIVATION
COMMITMENT
SUCCESS?
RESOURCE
PLAN
DEMO
ADMINISTRATION
The Framework is shown in detail below in Exhibit 1.  DEMO has been used extensively in the
counselling of start-ups by the UK Small Firms Service.  The process of setting up a new venture
can also be described in terms of a number of stages below.
Acquiring DEMO
Finding an Idea
Validating the Idea
Identifying the Resources
Negotiating to get into Business
Birth and Survival
Finding the stimulus and commitment to pursue DEMO objective of
setting up a business or new organisation (for the DEMO, related
group, community and family)
Finding an idea upon which it seems reasonable to spend time
evaluating further.  Or an alternative means of getting into business
(franchise license, buying a business, etc.)
Making it or doing it.  Testing the product/service (technically and
DEMO the customer).  Protecting it.   Testing the market.
Planning the DEMO or desirable scale of business entry.
Identifying: the detailed resources required; the timing; the quality
of suppliers, materials; identifying sources of assistance
Applying the plan.  Negotiating for finance, premises, contracts, sub-
contractors, etc.  Selecting the type of company and registering it.
Developing the necessary ongoing systems to keep a business in
operation.  Coping with all the statutory requirements.   Building
relationships with professionals who can help.  Establishing clear ties
with customers and suppliers (and the workforce).
103
While it is clear that many people set up new ventures without DEMO going through these
stages, if this is not done then it DEMO create many difficulties that often lead to failure.  Examples
include those DEMO formally set up the new venture but have not:
 Really clarified the idea (they set up a sandwich bar without clear consideration of the
full range of food to be offered: they start a pottery without clear focus on the range of
ceramics to be produced)DEMO
 Really validated the idea (in terms of close discussion with DEMO customers,
examination of the full range of competition, ability to DEMO make to standard
etc.)
 Really explored the implications of the scale of business needed to make a good living or
produce a DEMO profit or return on the investment (for example, a person going
into the commemorative glass engraving business fails to estimate adequately the total
DEMO of time to be taken and the associated costing and pricing needed to make a
living)
 Negotiated adequate resources, for example, DEMO too little from the bank in the
first instance so that recourse has to be made for further funds after only a few months
DEMO trading
 Set up adequate systems and contract arrangements (leading to DEMO control of
cash or problems with contractual suppliers or customers)
 Anticipated problems that might occur in early trading (for example failure of customers
to pay on time, delays in supplies, bottlenecks in operations, management of personal
time)
2. How is the exercise constructed?
DEMO are a number of ways of using the stages approach in the design and delivery of new
venture programmes.
1. Course participants are asked DEMO to brainstorm for 10 minutes on the question; ‘If you were
DEMO to interview the session leader on his/her business idea what questions would you ask
to determine if they were likely to be successful DEMO their new venture.  The facilitator then
takes the answers for each DEMO in turn and places them into the boxes as in Exhibit 1 below
– filling it out via a process of discussion with the DEMO
2. Participants can then use the framework which is handed out to appraise each other’s
business concept – identifying strengths and weaknesses and needs DEMO action.
3. Participants are then introduced to the stages concept as per the above.  They are given a full
list of the tasks as set below (Exhibit 2).
4. Participants can then be divided into small groups or conduct one to one interviews to
determine at which DEMO their respective ideas have reached and what they need to do next.
5. The checklists can be used to determine learning needs with a DEMO (see the Exhibit 3 below)
and therefore used to determine DEMO to the programme.
6. The material can be used in conjunction with a case (see Pedagogical Note 34) where
participants are given the DEMO of appraising a business plan for Strengths and Weaknesses and
also to indicate at what stage the proposer has actually reached
7. The New DEMO Programme can be run as a series of modules – following each module
participants can be asked to undertake a number of tasks as DEMO out for that stage.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The approach DEMO the heuristics of start up appraisal, implanting initially, via the framework, a
checklist in the new venture’s mind against which he/she can appraise their own start up
proposition – as a guide to action.  The Stages approach allows the starter to consider what needs
to be DEMO and what needs to be learned in relation to where they are now.  It thus follows the
entrepreneurial learning principle of linking learning closely to doing.
4. Outcome
The intended outcome is that the starter anticipates DEMO many problems and opportunities as
possible during the process of creating the venture thus limiting considerably the risks and stress
involved.

30.  Use of the Business Plan as a Relationship Management Instrument
1. What is Use of the Business Plan as a Relationship Management Instrument?DEMO
The business plan is often placed as the core of a new venture programme.  Yet the research
evidence demonstrates that it has not been central to the initiation of many businesses, even
those that are now global.  It is also unlikely that it was ever invented by an entrepreneur.  It is
more likely to be the product of those who offer resources to the entrepreneur and need formal
documents and plans to DEMO their decisions (bankers, venture capitalists, public grant and loan
giving DEMO and large company customers and suppliers).  This does not mean DEMO the plan can
be a useful means for the entrepreneur to think out his venture.  The work of Saraswathy and
others indicates, nevertheless, that the plan rarely turns out is the reality and it is DEMO capacity of
the entrepreneur to learn on his/her feet that is the mark of success in the early and probably
later years.
These DEMO have major implications for the teaching of start-up business planning.  Arguably
DEMO is best taught as a relationship management instrument.  Although they will DEMO have some
things in common the banker will look for somewhat different things from the formal venture
capitalist, from the angel, from the DEMO agent from the would – be partner and from the
corporate business.   The plan, in this case, can be compared with a DEMO which while containing a
common thread is ‘dressed’ to suit the specific job application.  This scenario provides numerous
opportunities for the educator.
Main components of the Business Plan
Different organisations have their own formats but common DEMO are as follows:
The Plan format
• summary
• overall objective – vision
• background to development
• the needs to be met DEMO customers
• the market and potential – reaching it
• the people - ability, motivation and commitment
• the scale and resource requirement (DEMO, staff, materials, location, technology) –
standards – costs
• DEMO, organisation and systems
• financial plan – available, needs, gap DEMO what if?
The Summary
• the name
• objectives of new company or development
• idea/product, customers, market, competition, USP
DEMO scale of business – why – and location
• people, management DEMO organisation
• resource summary, requirement, commitment, gap and financial forecast
DEMO
Background to development
•
•
•
•
•
history to development of DEMO/opportunity
the relevant environmental conditions
why the ‘time is right’
demonstration of the relevant know who
demonstration that really know the business
The Idea DEMO the Market
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the product/service clearly expressed
evidence that can make it/do it to quality
DEMO needs/benefits it will meet/provide
customers (profile) – evidence of acceptance at price
the market size, growth, segments, share
the competition (the best) and the USP
the price/cost/margin relationship
how DEMO enter and reach the market – channels- promotion – distribution
The People
•
•
•
•
who involved
relevant abilities and experience (technical, DEMO, managerial and relevant sector)
motivation and evidence of commitment and DEMO
relevant contacts and networks (full CVs in the Annex)
The DEMO and resource requirement
•
•
•
•
Scale - output targets of entry and why at this scale (technology, customer requirement,
ambition, market opportunity)
Physical resource requirement - new or additions (what and why)
Cost estimates, prices and margins – and standards on which they are based (utilisation,
wastage, efficiency, quality)
Location – and rationale
Operations process and technology (where relevant)
•
•
•
•
types of process and rationale
technology and rationale
competitive industry context
DEMO and maintenance context
110
The Management, Organisation and Systems
• ownership
• key managers and responsibilities
• organisation structure
• organisation – type  and rationale
• relationship of management to ownership where necessary and relevant
• legal requirements to be DEMO (if relevant)
• business systems – control
The Financial plan (with full explanatory assumptions)
• sales forecast
• profit and loss DEMO
• cash flow forecast
• balance sheet forecast
• breakeven
• contingencies, alternatives
• payback and rate of return
While the above framework is useful participants should be advised to follow the formats
available from the DEMO stakeholders where they are available.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
There are a number of different possible approaches.
Role play
The students DEMO given a start–up case (see Pedagogical Note 33).  They are then divided into
small groups as follows:
- a bank presentation DEMO
- a venture capital group
- a public grant giving group
- an active partner investor group
- a family group
Each of the DEMO is divided into two – one subgroup which will present the case to the
stakeholder acting the role of the entrepreneur and the other DEMO representing the
stakeholder.  Each subgroup is asked first to brainstorm on DEMO the stakeholder will be most
looking for in the proposal – the entrepreneur group in order to direct the presentation and the
stakeholder group DEMO order to question it.  On the basis of their thoughts which DEMO guided by the
facilitator they enter into a negotiating role play for the rest of the class.
111
Class Brainstorming on Case
If time does not permit, the class can brainstorm as a whole on the different stakeholder
perspectives.  They can then be given the case and asked to comment upon it from different
DEMO, as a written exercise or full class discussion.
Class Brainstorming on DEMO short mini case statement as below:
2 women who run the successful kiosk chain of ‘underwear fashion’ shops in London.  They want
expand their business into jewellery and cosmetics.  They need to raise £50,000 for this exercise.
They think that they can get it either from: a bank; their parents; potential partners; Korean
suppliers; venture capitalists; or from government grants.
What would these different stakeholders look for in DEMO Business Plan? What should they
themselves be particularly thinking about to DEMO themselves?’
Using Stakeholder representatives
As preparation for the exercise the whole group can interview invited stakeholders with the
purpose of identifying what particularly DEMO are looking for in a business plan.  The results can
then DEMO compared.
A Guide to the different perspectives that might be found is as follows:

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The approach is one of learning by and through relationship management.  As indicated in earlier
Notes, DEMO is through relationships with stakeholders that entrepreneurs do most of their learning.
The relationship approach to business planning moves participants into this frame of DEMO
4. Outcomes
Participants will know how to develop and appraise a business plan from different stakeholder
perspectives and will have practiced negotiation on the DEMO of the plan.
114
31.  Use of Surviving in the Early Years of the Venture
1. What is Use of Surviving in the Early Years?
It has DEMO commented upon extensively in earlier notes that much of entrepreneurial learning
takes place during the first few years of the venture.  This is often via a process of solving
problems and responding to the unanticipated demands DEMO on the venture by the task
environment.  It can be argued DEMO the capacity of the venture to survive and even develop will
be the function of the capacity to learn from the experience but also DEMO anticipate problems.  The
Annex to the Pedagogical Note 23 on Immersion DEMO a range of such problems that are known
to occur in the early years of the venture.  The challenge to the educator is to organise
knowledge around these issues so that they can be either ‘solved’ DEMO they occur or
adequately prepared for.  This demands a problem solving DEMO learning approach where the
knowledge is organised around the problem solution.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants are asked to brainstorm on DEMO kinds of problems that might occur in early years of
the venture.  The facilitator takes the feedback and can organise it under various headings as in
Exhibit 1 below.
Exhibit 1
FORSEEABLE PROBLEMS ARISING
FROM INADEQUATE DEMO
PREPARATION
UNFORSEEABLE SYSTEMS PROBLEMS
STRATEGIC ISSUES
THINKING FOR SURVIVAL RESULTING FROM BASIC INADEQUACY OF
STRESS AND TIME PRESSURE
BUSINESS SYSTEMS
‘Foreseeable’ Problems
These largely DEMO the failure of the start-up business to think through sufficiently each of the
stages of the start-up process.  Common problems that will emerge are shown below.
Idea
- the idea (product or service) does not DEMO customers’ needs
- customer feedback shows a different set of needs or different combination of needs
- there are insufficient customers to make a DEMO
- the product is indistinguishable from that of established competitors
- inconsistency in quality and service (delivery)
- the product cuts across existing patents, designs or copyrights
- reaching the market proves difficult
115
PROBLEMS
ARISING FROM THE
Resources
Resources have been under-estimated in particular:
- adequate stocking levels DEMO not been catered for
- supplier reliability has not been sounded out carefully enough
- working capital requirements and terms of payment have not DEMO calculated carefully
enough
- work in progress is excessive
- there is excessive wastage
- quality production and distribution has not been maintained at DEMO even level
- outputs have been over estimated because of failure to plan for realistic levels of utilisation
Finance
Financial resources are inadequate as DEMO result of:
- inadequate projection of cash flow particularly negative cash flows
- resultant failure to negotiate sufficient overdraft facility
- taking too DEMO out of the business too early
- failure to control debtor/creditor relationships
- under pricing from the beginning
- insufficient equity
- failure DEMO understand how quickly things happen once a business is started
Management
Professional/management problems including:
- problems with partners covering a wide range DEMO issues such as: disparity of effort; different
attitudes to growth; DEMO demarcation; decision making; rewards from the business; personal
guarantees; management style
- family problems relating to support of the spouse and adequate DEMO of time to domestic
life
- weaknesses in personal or technical managerial skills critical to success (for example personal
presentation, negotiation skills)
DEMO basic inadequacy of systems or appropriate management control
Unforeseen Problems
These problems will involve the development of survival strategies and could involve major
unforeseen DEMO as below:
- downturns in the economy
- changes in key personnel in the external environment (bank managers, buyers, suppliers)
- failure of key customers or suppliers
- changes in the regulatory environment
DEMO fundamental shifts in customer needs
- illness, ill health or changes DEMO family circumstances
116
Systems Consolidation problems
These broadly relate to the development of basic systems DEMO survival.  The role of the counsellor
will therefore be in analysing DEMO systems/problems, creating awareness of appropriate systems
and, importantly, demonstrating DEMO these will work. Key problem areas to look for are shown
below.
cash flow management
planning cash flows
basic production/service management systems allowing DEMO control of utilisation,
efficiency,
wastage and quality standards
development of appropriate trading, profit and loss forecasts and budget systems
making adequate provision for tax
ensuring basic office systems
basic sales analysis and customer feedback DEMO
selecting (and using adequately) professional advisers
Strategic Thinking for Survival
Formal business planning is not within the capability of many small businesses.  Educators who
place too great an emphasis upon this may be in danger DEMO overloading a management that has
little time to spare.   Planning ahead does not, however, have to be highly formalised.  It is, DEMO
all, an attitude of mind.  The educator can make a major contribution to the small firm in this
respect by focusing participant attention DEMO the longer-term impact of the problems or
opportunities that are being discussed.  Strategic issues that are likely to be important to the
survival of the business are listed below:
 over dependence on single customers DEMO suppliers
 strategic gearing of the business and ability to service external debt
 thinking about new ideas and new personnel
 ways of DEMO with inexperience
 finding new resources
 methods of monitoring the environment ‘appropriate’ to limited resources for example:
reading the
 right journals; visiting exhibitions; harvesting information from suppliers and customers;
personal
 networking at local, regional and national levels
 being unafraid to talk the business through with advisers, the bank manager and other key
persons (DEMO customers) upon whom the business depends for survival
 overall, developing recognition that it is not what the owner feels about the business DEMO is
important to survival but what customers, suppliers, advisers and workers feel
The above issues form the basis for programme development.  It will be important for the
educator, in addressing any of the four problem areas in Exhibit 1 to focus programme content
not only on solving DEMO immediate problems but also exploring the nature of the other issues
identified above and the management’s strategic thinking about the business.  A sound
programme will help to: shape strategic thinking, consolidate the basic systems upon DEMO the
organisation depends (in an appropriate fashion); and facilitate the DEMO of the business
plan to cope with problems that might have been foreseen or indeed are random and largely
unforeseeable.

The importance of this approach to the educator is that it provides DEMO focus for the organisation
of knowledge.  For example, cash flow management can be approached by analysis of the
reasons what it presents problems DEMO from:
 excess working capital accumulation
 inadequate debtor creditor management
 overtrading
 negligence in invoicing
 inadequate bank arrangements
 poor DEMO
 excessive personal withdrawals
 inadequate volumes
 undercapitalization
 over-gearing
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The approach is essentially focused upon entrepreneurial problem DEMO
4. Outcomes
Participants are equipped to anticipate problems that might occur in the early years of the
venture.

32.  Use of Segmenting the New Venture Programme Market
1.
What is Use of Segmenting the New Venture Programme Market
As in all education DEMO training programmes there may be different groups of people with very
different learning needs.  This is also the case with new Venture Programmes.  DEMO may be
distinctive benefits from segmentation as below.  Each offer different DEMO in different
localities and often with different sources of programme sponsorship and partnership.
2.
How is the exercise constructed?
In groups, the following list provides stimuli for discussion. Groups can be asked to brainstorm
business DEMO to reach each market, or can explore 1 idea, against these potential markets,
looking for market development and new product extensions.

Clusters – groups of interrelated businesses in a sector, for example outdoor clothing
Inward investor entrepreneurs – moving in to a particular area
DEMO company spin-off – existing small company entrepreneurs have many ideas for new starts
which can be exploited
University technology transfer out – with particular DEMO relating to IP and longer periods of
negative cash flow

33.  Use of Developing Operations Standards as a basis for Estimating Costs and
Controlling Operations
1. What is Use of Operations Standards?
These DEMO standards that might be set formally, or informally estimated, as a basis for controlling
operations in all kinds of service or manufacturing operations.  There are four key areas that are
relevant to all kinds of DEMO
Utilisation of space, machinery, other assets and labour
Efficiency with which these physical or human assets are used
Wastage of materials consumed in DEMO process or service, and
Quality control of the service or product
DEMO importance of these four areas to setting of costs in a new venture is best demonstrated by a
simple example.
In a motor vehicle DEMO garage the price of the service to the customer will be a function of:
- the cost of labour in the service
- DEMO cost of the parts/materials used in the service
- recovery of appropriate portion of overheads
Labour charges will need to be based upon DEMO of:
Utilisation – the total hours that will be available to be charged out to customers.  This is unlikely
to be all the hours that will be paid for by the firm. For example if DEMO are 4 mechanics each
working 40 hours then there are a total of 160 hours ostensibly available.  But there will be range
of foreseeable and unforeseen circumstances that will prevent this.  Foreseen circumstances will
include toilet breaks refreshment breaks, time spent in cleaning up, time in collecting DEMO,
time in discussion of problems and in briefing for different jobs etc.  There will also be
unforeseeable time lost, waiting for the DEMO of a hoist, discussions with a customer on the
telephone if DEMO are found during the service, waiting for a particular part etc.  In general
therefore the garage can only probably expect to sell out DEMO per cent of total time paid for.  The
utilisation standard hourly DEMO will therefore be:
Total wage bill of the 4 mechanics
80% of 160 hours = 128 chargeable hours
Efficiency – the degree to DEMO jobs are undertaken in the time allocated as a standard.  Most
DEMO garages will have standards for all the kinds of jobs likely to be undertaken in terms of
labour hours to be spent (for
example standard hours for certain make of car/mileage service, replacing a clutch etc).  These
form the basis for estimating costs to the customer.  In the major dealerships there will be
manuals that indicate the estimated times for all types of jobs.  When a mechanic is allocated a
job he will also be allocated a standard time.  When he completes the job he will put the actual
time taken with explanations for DEMO variances.  Labour efficiency can therefore be measured at
the end of DEMO week by calculating:
Total time allocated to jobs
Total time actually taken
121
It is unlikely that efficiency will be 100% - many unforeseen problems DEMO occur – so on the
basis of experience a standard may be say 95%.  Yet the customer may not always be charged for
the extra hours so there will need to be some allowance made for DEMO recovery relating to
efficiency standard outcomes.  If 5% of hours are DEMO then a further 8 hours (5% of 160) will need
to taken away from the chargeable hours base above.
Wastage – there will DEMO be wastage of materials and components.  Some components may
be damaged DEMO use and therefore written off, some may disappear as mechanics use DEMO for
their own private purposes, some will be faulty etc.  Therefore, in reality, it is unlikely that a
garage will ‘sell out’ DEMO of all components booked out from the parts department.  On the
DEMO of experience therefore, a standard might be set based upon a DEMO of:
Cost of materials booked out to customers
Cost of materials booked out from the parts department
The ‘profits’ made by the parts DEMO will be affected by this and pricing of parts will need
to take into account the ‘wastage' standard.
Quality – quality can be measured in a number of ways – see below.  In the context of the garage
it will probably be measured by customer feedback and more DEMO by the amount of
‘rework’ the garage has to do in response to customer dissatisfaction.   From a costing
perspective, therefore, a certain DEMO may need to be set for hours spent on rework
(including DEMO hours not charged to good customers as gestures of goodwill – for example
replacing or changing around tyres).  The number of ‘rework’ hours (let us say estimated a 3 per
week) will therefore need DEMO be deducted from the sold out hours calculation as above.
So in the light of standards set for utilisation, efficiency and quality the hourly cost rater may be
calculated as:
Total labour costs of mechanics
DEMO – (32 + 8 + 3) =117 sellable hours
In many small businesses, using absorption costing, the total labour hourly charge actually
DEMO to the customer would be the result of the above plus an addition for overhead and
profit absorptions calculated as follows:
Total overhead DEMO plus profit estimate
117 hours
This simple example can be expanded as a framework for all kinds of service and manufacturing
activities, no matter what the scale.  Its purpose is, however, to critically demonstrate the
importance in any start up situation of properly working out costs and DEMO standards as a
basis for this.  Also there will be need DEMO develop appropriate, often simple, systems, to measure
performance against standards.  In the case of the garage all of this can be designed DEMO a simple
job card.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
1.  The importance of the concept can be demonstrated by request to different groups of
participants to work out how utilisation, efficiency, wastage and DEMO might be measured in
different operating contexts building from the basic framework in Exhibit 1 below.
122
Participants might explore how they would measure and use Utilisation etc in:DEMO
Utilisation                Efficiency          Wastage       Quality
Hotels
Restaurants
Computer services
Supermarkets
DEMO manufacture
A pottery
Consulting firm
Cleaning Services
Plastics Extrusion
and how they might use it for costing and produce systems for collecting data for DEMO
control purposes.  A major challenge in this is to discuss the DEMO importance in different
situations of whether to measure physical asset use and efficiency etc or human resource use.
For example, in a hotel, DEMO would be measured by bed nights sold over bed nights
available.  DEMO measures might be different as per different parts of the business (DEMO
example, rooms cleaned per staff hour over a standard).  Wastage might be measured in terms of
room materials consumed over room materials DEMO (with an estimate for theft built in).
Quality might be DEMO by customer complaints or compliments.

1. Entrepreneurs from different types of ventures can be brought in and DEMO as to how they
build up costs and develop standards.
Participants can be asked to brainstorm and/or investigate what might be the sources DEMO
problems of deviation from standards of utilisation, efficiency, wastage and quality in different
contexts and how these might be measured/controlled by management
DEMO
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The approach boils costing and standards setting down to its simplest form to allow participants
and would-be entrepreneurs to DEMO the ‘wood from the trees’ of operations management, It
focuses upon DEMO core elements of operations management and not sophisticated techniques.
4. Outcomes
Participants will be equipped with the basic capacity to cost and develop and DEMO standards
in operations.
125
34.  Use of Case Studies
1. What is Use of Case Studies?
The case is a simulation of a ‘real world’ situation more DEMO than not based on research and
usually disguised in name to protect confidentiality.  As indicated in Pedagogical Note 14 on
Critical Incidents, there DEMO various levels of case intensity from the short ‘incident’ presented as
a basis of class discussion to the long complex problem solving exercise of DEMO pages.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The case method can be used as a major focus for participative learning often involving pre-class
DEMO and a list of questions to be considered which will be focused upon in class.  Case analysis
may be used for examination and assignment purposes.  Case writing may also be part of a
learning programme and can be used, for example, as a final project assignment.  The focus of
most case studies is upon problem solving but they can DEMO used as demonstrators as to how
things can be done, as DEMO basis for discussion as to how things should be done, for DEMO
development of frames of reference for analysis and as a basis for demonstrating the value of
certain concepts in practice.
A case study for DEMO learning would have the following components:
1.  A case – DEMO of a particular real life situation presenting the basis as noted above for
class based discussion and potentially role play and other pedagogical methods
DEMO  A series of questions/issues for the class to consider
Some DEMO may be directly related to the case
e.g.  ‘Did the managing DEMO ignore key aspects of the environment in making his/her
decision?’ Others may be of a broader conceptual nature
e.g.  ‘What are the key components of Strategic Awareness that might be used to explore the
DEMO Directors approach to the problem?’
Others may be of an action nature
e.g.  ‘What should the Managing Director do now and why?’
Others may explore the students’ frame of reference for analysis
e.g.  ‘What factors would you take into consideration if you were invited in to DEMO company as a
consultant to assist?’
3.  Handouts and articles DEMO which provide a basis for conceptual thinking and sometimes
providing further background information
4.  Teacher/facilitator notes – which may or may not be ultimately used as a class handout
The facilitator will need ample whiteboard DEMO flip chart space.  He/she will need to be prepared
to DEMO knowledge emanating from the class in a planned way but will need to be flexible as
the way in which knowledge will emerge cannot DEMO be predicted.  Control of the class is
exercised by a mixture DEMO closed and open questions and by use of building and summarising
behaviour.
There will be opportunities for use of a number of pedagogical tools DEMO role play, drama,
presentation skills development, and debate.
126
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Case teaching can be the antithesis of DEMO learning unless it is used not as an
analytical paper based and essentially reductionist problem solving exercise but as a means for
stimulating wider DEMO and conceptualisation of issues.  Cases are no real substitute for active
DEMO engagement with real ambiguous situations.
4. Outcomes
Taught entrepreneurially, cases can DEMO a strong means for the development of frames of
reference and for the practice of certain entrepreneurial skills.
127
35.  Use of Exercises in Finding Ideas for Business
1. What is Use of Exercises in Finding Business Ideas?
The aim is to DEMO participants with exercises focused upon identifying ways into business.

discussed in Pedagogical Note 28 on Opportunity Identification.
2. How is DEMO exercise constructed?
A range of up to 32 ‘Ways into Business’ can be introduced (see Annex below).  Each of these can
DEMO discussed with participants.  They can be asked to add to the DEMO of examples and then to
discuss ways of approaching the opportunity based upon the general content outlined in the
Annex and their own experience.
DEMO may then be broken into groups and given a selection of ‘ideas’,  asked to select one or
more and then given a project DEMO identify, evaluate and present the findings to the class as below.
DEMO 1 a) import replacement possibilities!
b) substitute materials components in an existing product or service where are
problems
Group 2      a) add value to an existing product/service
b) use under-utilised people
DEMO 3      a) meeting an unmet need
b) meeting DEMO market shortage
Other groups can be given further assignments from the list in the Annex.
Students report back and present the results of their DEMO to the whole class.  There may
then a vote on the DEMO convincing presentation of an opportunity and how they researched it.
There can also be an accompanying discussion of how the particular opportunity was chosen.
DEMO Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is essentially one of brainstorming on the basis of existing knowledge, action
learning with the use of frameworks and analysis and presentation.
4. Outcomes
That participants know clearly a large DEMO of entry points into business and have explored
many of these.  DEMO they are also motivated to follow up on this.

36.  Use of Exploring the Enterprise Culture in a Globalisation Context
1. What is Use of ‘Exploring the Enterprise Culture in a Global context’?DEMO
The aim in this exercise is to explore the relevance of the entrepreneurial concept to society in
general.  It has been argued elsewhere1 that entrepreneurial behaviour/competency is required
to cope with, enjoy and indeed create uncertainty and complexity.  Such situations occur in
widely different contexts – work, leisure, and family and community life.  They are not therefore
solely related to setting up and growing a new venture.  The purpose of the exercise is therefore
to focus students upon the nature of uncertainties DEMO complexities that have occurred, are
currently occurring or are anticipated to DEMO in future in the lives of a range of people in the
community and linked with this, the kinds of entrepreneurial behaviours they are stimulated to
use in response.  Background readings on the impact of globalisation can accompany this.2 The
exercise is most suitable as part of the DEMO to any entrepreneurship programme as it is
concerned with enabling participants to understand why the entrepreneurial concept is currently
highly visible around the world, how it links with globalisation, why it is so prominent in policy
debates and why the concept itself is being broadened away from entrepreneurship DEMO
focused upon business start up towards the development of the ‘Entrepreneurial Mindset’ in the
population in general.
The exercise also needs to be prefaced DEMO some discussion of Entrepreneurial behaviours, skills
and attributes and how they DEMO stimulated or suppressed by different environments
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The exercise is in a number of parts as follows:
DEMO Introduction which sets out the aims of the whole exercise; the DEMO of linking
entrepreneurship to the ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity, the fact that such
uncertainties and complexities occur in widely different contexts, the interview process and the
relevance and purpose of use of drama (Annex 1).
Then:
Part 1 Is a participative lecture and discussion on the links of the entrepreneurship concept to
globalisation – see DEMO 2 PowerPoint.
Part 2 Is an exploration in class of how this is likely to affect a range of citizens.  This can be done
via a brainstorming process using the experiences of friends and relations of DEMO members.
Participants are also given an example of a teacher.  Other DEMO can be brainstormed,
handed out and discussed (Annex 3).
DEMO 3 The class are briefed to conduct a short 1 – 1.5 hour interview with an individual – not a
business entrepreneur although it DEMO be a manager in a company.  They are shown a list DEMO
examples (Annex 3).  They are asked to write up the interview in two/three sides as follows:
- short background note DEMO the interview – personal details and occupation
- identification of uncertainties and complexities in their domestic, community, and work life –
past, present and anticipated (as per the examples in Annex 3)
- identification of any associated entrepreneurial behaviours used or attitudes developed

Paradigm? International Journal of Entrepreneurship Education.  Vol 5 2007 Senate Hall
2 See for example Richard Scase  (DEMO) ‘Global Remix.  The fight for competitiveness’ Kogan Page London
164
- they are asked to carefully observe the body language and mannerisms DEMO the interviewee to
assist in examination of the degree of emotions behind some of the answers
Part 4 The write-ups of the interviews are DEMO and when the group meets again they are
divided into small groups of up to 5 persons.  In turn they are asked to role play their interviewee
briefly in response to questions from the others in DEMO group.  After this they are invited to agree
on a number DEMO key uncertainties and complexities that seem to be either shared or most
important.  They may have up to 5 items.  They then write DEMO on a flip chart.  Their briefing
note is in Annex 4.
DEMO 5 They are then introduced to a number of dramatic techniques (DEMO 5) and also, if time
permits, subjected to some ‘warm-up’ DEMO
Part 6.  They are then asked to construct a drama, using a metaphor if possible to demonstrate
the message.  They are assisted in this process by a drama facilitator – writing a story board,
DEMO a metaphor, developing script, allocating parts and rehearsing.  The drama DEMO last
ten minutes.  It will have minimum props and costumes but DEMO use imaginatively anything that is
available in the room.  Music is DEMO  The main purpose of the drama is to project the
messages DEMO the flip chart.  But it must also be entertaining and creative (see Annex 6 – Briefing
to Students).
Part 7.  They then perform the drama to the rest of the class.  After each performance the
facilitator asks the class what were the main messages to come DEMO  These are then compared
with those written on the flip chart DEMO the performing group.  The class are asked then asked to
‘score’ DEMO drama awarding marks for the degree to which the message was got across, the
degree of entertainment, and the degree of creativity (see Annex 7).
Part 8.  At the end of the drama session there is a review of what the participants have learned
about the DEMO contexts of entrepreneurship in their society and also of what they feel they
have gained from the drama exercise (Annex 8).
Part 9.  This is their score and written feedback from the drama facilitator (DEMO Annex 9 for
example).
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
There are two major contributions.  The first is to place the entrepreneurial learning process in a
wider context and underpin this in student approaches so that DEMO see the wider relevance of
entrepreneurship to their own future life-world.  DEMO second relates to the use of drama.
The conventional academic approach to the stakeholder interview exercises would be to mark
the written report and DEMO would be that.  Asking members of the class to pool results DEMO and
perform in this way serves a number of purposes:
It is a reminder that no information received from interviews and research approaches (no
matter how good the checklist) is truly objective.  The results DEMO reflect the values and beliefs
of the person interviewed and often their recent experiences and emotions.  For example, a
person who has recently DEMO convicted by police of a speeding traffic offence will have a
different response to questions about the role and value of the police force DEMO general than
someone who has just been saved by the police from an assault.  A dramatic presentation of
interviews will demand interpretation of the emotions behind the message.
It demands of the creators of the drama DEMO they must put themselves in the shoes of the
provider of information and see the results from their point of view.  The conventional academic
process of data collection often makes little or no demand upon understanding DEMO data from the
providers’ point of view.
Drama demands that individual characters in the drama are understood through the eyes of the
other characters.  The dramatist makes the character believable by portraying him/her through
the DEMO of other characters in the drama.  It is a key essence DEMO entrepreneurship to see oneself
through the eyes of key stakeholders.

Messages and information delivered in innovative ways will make a DEMO impact and can create
wider understanding.  Entrepreneurs often need to use DEMO ways of delivering messages.  TV
advertising is for example drama.  A presentation can be dramatic to make an impact.
Drama provides training in DEMO skills.  Entrepreneurs need to be able to act different roles in
DEMO situations.  A good entrepreneur is a good actor.  In building relationships with different
stakeholders the entrepreneur will need to act different roles – DEMO a banker, venture capitalist,
government official, employee, regulator, and customer and so on.
4.
Outcomes
Participants will have an understanding of DEMO relevance of entrepreneurial mindsets to a
globalised society.  They will also DEMO their creative and communicative skills developed by the
drama exercise.  They DEMO also understand the importance of emotional intelligence in examining
data.

Example – part summary of English School teacher
Kate is a middle aged married teacher of English DEMO a Secondary school in the UK and is head of
department.  DEMO has grown up children and a husband who is an academic in the local
university.
Global
The key global pressures on her work life DEMO reflected in the following:
-
-
The school now has partnership links now with schools in Japan and Russia and is also
engaged DEMO European Community funded programme linking language teachers in several
European countries.  DEMO has had to arrange exchange trips to several countries and had
the opportunity and responsibility to travel and set these up and accompany groups.  She
has had to engage parents, find accommodation and entertain delegations from different
countries.  She has also had to arrange special English classes for foreign visiting students
and organise community links and social visits.  None of this she gets paid for and it has
eaten considerably into her DEMO time.
The English curriculum has broadened to include a larger number of American authors and
translations of other famous authors.  As a result she has had to…….
172
-
-
There is much greater use of IT and most essays DEMO are word processed.  There is more
evidence of students ‘borrowing’ texts DEMO the internet and this leads to disputes and
complications in marking…….  DEMO has had to develop her own IT skills in order to keep
and she really dislikes this……
There are a wider range of ethnic DEMO entering the school some of whom do not have
English as a first language.  This has meant the development of remedial classes…..
Organisation
-
-
-
-
-
-
Greater pressure on the school to meet DEMO targets often driven by international
comparisons.  Therefore more testing of students DEMO more paperwork…..
Schools are on tighter budgets and are expected to behave more like businesses.  Kate has
to operate a departmental budget and fight for internal resources.  She has now to make
decisions as whether she can afford a new part time teacher to relieve `pressure or buy
DEMO books….
Schools are becoming more competitive and are competing more also with private sector
education.  More care has therefore to be given to marketing the department with parents
so that the best students are not taken DEMO This involves for Kate….
Performance measures for individual teachers have been introduced following practice in
business.  Better teachers, according to these measures, get increased pay.  This means
more paperwork and more potential areas of dispute with teachers who do not perform.
Kate has therefore to spend more DEMO
There is an increasing problem with children and the use of text messaging in the
classroom. It is difficult to confiscate mobile phones…Kate is DEMO to set rules that will be
enforceable….
There are also increasing problems as in most schools with drug taking.  This involves more
substantial interaction with parents and at times the police but drug dealers have networks
DEMO young children selling small quantities and will enforce their system with violence at
times…..  This involves Kate in…..
Personal
-
-
-
-
Kate’s children now work abroad and she has to plan to see her DEMO and daughter and
grandchildren….
Her husband also increasingly travels overseas and she has to manage the household more
on her own….
She and her DEMO do however take more holidays abroad and are seriously thinking of
buying property in Cyprus – but there are still uncertainties about the political DEMO of
that country
Several of her former close friends have moved away, some overseas, and she is under
pressure to use the internet DEMO to keep in touch – but she hates it!
What kind of Entrepreneurial behaviours will Kate have to pursue?
Why?

ANNEX 4
BRIEFING FOR INTERVIEW EXERCISE
Exercise with possible Stakeholder Interviewees
The DEMO of Globalisation has been to create more uncertainty and complexity for many
individuals in many societies.  A framework was developed (Annex 1) to demonstrate this, linking
global pressures with changes at the State/Society, DEMO and Individual (worker,
consumer and family) level).  It DEMO shown how changes have affected all kinds of individuals in
all kinds of different positions in society (the unemployed, doctors, police, social DEMO,
teachers etc).  Many examples were given (Annex 2).  Course participants are asked to explore
this issue by interviewing a stakeholder from the local community for up to two hours on the way
DEMO which they had been affected by the pressures identified in the module.  See the list below:

GROUP DRAMA PRODUCTION
BRIEFING TO STUDENTS
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
The DEMO
The production must aim above all to project a message and a number of related points to the
audience.
The message and points can DEMO derived in the following way.
 each individual to take a ‘hot seat’ in the group to describe briefly the stakeholder they
interviewed and DEMO summarise the main uncertainties/complexities now confronting them and
any entrepreneurial behaviours exhibited.
 after this the group should agree what are the key DEMO uncertainties and complexities
and associated behaviours they want to demonstrate in the drama.
 they should also agree an overall message they want to DEMO and associated points.  These
must clearly relate to sources of uncertainty DEMO complexity and entrepreneurial
behaviours.
 the story board and drama should be constructed to deliver this message and points.
 when finally agreed they DEMO be written on a flip chart and kept secret.  The drama DEMO be
assessed by the audience against these messages/points.
 the storyboard and drama will then be created with the drama facilitator’s help

37.  Use of Programme Evaluation
1. What is Use of Programme Evaluation?
Evaluation has three major conventional aims.  Firstly, to feed forward DEMO the future design of
programmes.  Secondly, to feed back on the outcomes from programmes to deliver,
beneficiaries, sponsors and participants.  Thirdly, to feed back and forward on the management
of programmes.  The conventional use of evaluation is therefore as a post-hoc instrument to
measure outcomes DEMO process against planned objectives and ways of achieving them.  A fourth,DEMO
and perhaps most important component of an evaluation frame, is as DEMO basic instrument for:
establishing programme concept, objectives and planned outcomes; creating a dynamic
evolutionary learning framework; managing and monitoring the whole process; and
communicating with all key stakeholders.  This is demonstrated below:
DEMO schema are conventionally divided into two distinctive parts, Formative evaluation
and DEMO evaluation.
Formative (Process) evaluation examines the processes by which the organisation(s) involved in
the activity to be evaluated pursue it and manage.
Summative (Outcome) evaluation seeks to measure the various outcomes at different DEMO and
facilitates judgement as to the degree to which they were the result of inputs.
The two are interdependent. The issues explored in Formative DEMO are those that impact
directly on the outcomes shown in the Summative exercise.  It is the Formative issues that will
determine the capacity of the organisation to continue with the activity when the intervention is
terminated.  They focus equally upon issues of effectiveness as well as efficiency.
Formative DEMO focus upon the following key questions:
1. Is there a clear concept behind the intervention -where is the targeted added value from the
DEMO and why is it needed? Has it been clearly set out?DEMO
2. Has there been a sound process of identification and selection of beneficiaries under the
programme?
3. Have the needs of ultimate and DEMO customers/clients (organisations and individuals)
been analysed and grouped meaningfully?DEMO
4. How well have the products/services/programmes been designed to meet needs, covering:
- the setting of programme objectives
- the determination of detailed content
- the design of any materials
- the recruitment, selection and development of trainers/service providers
- the proposed style of DEMO
5. How sound has been the delivery process it? Covering:
DEMO the competency of those delivering the programme/service
- the process of any counselling, consultancy and follow up
- the choice and use of networks and outside personnel
- location and timing of programme activity
- DEMO of assessment and accreditation
179
6. Is it clear how the deliverer will reach the market, identified in particular by the process of:
- price setting
- marketing DEMO chosen
- channels used
- PR
- selling of the programme
7. Is there a clear process set out for evaluating success?
8. DEMO well has the project been organised and managed, in particular the DEMO of:
- budgeting and financing
- control systems and measures established
- leadership and motivation
- organisation design – is it entrepreneurial?
DEMO the scope established for innovation and new ideas
- the experience base behind the programme and its utilisation
- resource acquisition processes
- relevant DEMO engagement
- strategic orientation
- planning processes
- communication to all relevant parties
Summative evaluation measures can be taken at various levels:
1. DEMO of immediate customers to the input, be it training, counselling or a more direct service.
This usually covers issues such as:
- DEMO customers like the service
- whether they think it is relevant to their jobs/institutions
- whether they think they have learned something
- DEMO they thought materials were sound
- whether they like the tutors/ DEMO providers
- whether they like the location and amenities
- whether there is lot or little they can use
- whether they thought the DEMO was just right, too heavy or too light
- whether they DEMO like more and what
- the highs and the lows overall
All the above except the last can be measured on a Likert scale DEMO to 5 or 7.
2. Learning Measures.  What has been learned DEMO who from the programme inputs in more detail?
This can be measured by asking different groups of participants in a programme, at different
levels, what they think they have learned or what they and their organisation feel they are now
competent to do.  This can be done by interview, tests of learning as in an examination or
demonstrated through observation of competency.  The key issue here, often neglected, is
whether the learning has been transferred into 'how to' in the recipient’s DEMO life and work
situation as opposed to being regurgitated as per the input.
3. Behaviour Measures, measuring how and why people do things differently.  This can be assessed
by questions as to how individuals go about key parts of their work and what has changed as a
result DEMO the input.  It can be checked by observation or processes of DEMO degree review.  In the
case of emphasis upon personal behaviours in DEMO situations (for example counselling) this
may be tested by observation of events or video.
180
4. Intermediate organisation change measures.  These seek to measure what has been changed in
terms of organisation practices.  For example in the context of micro finance, have there been
new credit rating systems, new forms DEMO marketing, new ways of dealing with customers in
arrears etc.  In Business Development Service start up training there would be questions as to
DEMO there has been start -up and how far down the track the business had proceeded since
the programme.
Ultimate level change.  This seeks to measure what impact the input activity has had on the
ultimate performance DEMO the organisation (in business context in terms of sales, profits, DEMO,
employment etc).
It is clear that the further that one moves up the hierarchy of Summative evaluation the more
difficult it is DEMO attribute results to any specific programme input, for two major reasons.  Firstly,
because of the passage of time needed for the results DEMO permeate.  Secondly, because of the
difficulty of attribution resulting from the influence of numerous other factors.  It is, for example,
difficult DEMO practice to truly attribute the impact of a start up training course upon the growth and
profitability of a business.  Even to attribute the subsequent start of a business to a course may
be difficult unless DEMO perfect match experimental model is used, a situation which is almost
DEMO to achieve.  Attempts to overcome such problems in order to take DEMO benefit
measures of inputs are usually so contrived or alternatively so simplistic as to be less than useful.
They are nevertheless extensively used because DEMO the need to justify the funding of
programmes.  High ‘scores’ in DEMO of start up results can of course be achieved by careful
selection.
A major value of summative work therefore lies in using the 'hierarchy' in the process of setting
up a programme of activity designed to help an organisation.  For example, by enquiring what
performance targets need DEMO be achieved, what changes may be needed in the organisation to DEMO
this, whose and what behaviours need to change and what therefore DEMO to be learned, there
will be better design of programmes.
How DEMO the exercise constructed?

This is best demonstrated via a Summative example, of evaluation of a broad based
Entrepreneurship University Development Programme.

The above exercise provides the basic targets for the programme design as DEMO as a focus for 44 7
evaluation at various summative levels.  DEMO Formative evaluation of the same programme would 4
follow the format as noted earlier.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Entrepreneurial learning is essentially focused DEMO ‘doing things’.  The evaluation framework
described above is outcomes focused as DEMO as entrepreneurial process focused.  It has been
noted above that the DEMO value of the framework is in its use in the initial design of the
programme not just a means of post–hoc measurement.  By this means, even though it may not
be possible to convincingly demonstrate the impact of a programme on outcomes at higher levels
of the summative DEMO, it will be possible to demonstrate that the programme was clearly
DEMO in its design upon these.
4. Outcomes
The main outcome is a tool that can be used to clearly focus a programme right from DEMO
beginning and to demonstrate to sponsors what can and what cannot be usefully measured.

38.  Use of the Quiz
1.
What is Use of the Quiz?
A quiz is usually a set of knowledge questions covering a DEMO body of knowledge.  A quiz
may also be used to test DEMO to a number of issues or areas of concern (for example DEMO quiz
about beliefs) or about how other people see things: In general the quiz serves a number of
useful purposes.  It can be used at the beginning of a programme to test the existing knowledge
DEMO of the students.  It is therefore a vehicle for discussing the DEMO learning objectives in a
module.  It can be used at the DEMO of a module to test learning.  It can be used as DEMO vehicle for the
facilitator to bring out areas of contested ‘fact’ – for example what is the meaning of failure and
what are the DEMO in measuring it? It can be an instrument for motivating the DEMO to
learn.  It constitutes a more interesting means for students to DEMO otherwise ‘boring’ facts.
The quiz can also be used as a means of students setting up their own testing of learning or
indeed testing DEMO knowledge of the facilitator! It can be used as a means of ‘teaching’ how to
develop appropriate questionnaires and to explore some of the DEMO in this process.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The quiz shown in the Annex below was used as part of an introduction DEMO an Entrepreneurship
Module on an MBA programme at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai,
China.  The aim was not only to test the existing knowledge of the students but also to surprise
them DEMO the role that small businesses had played in Chinese economic development in the
previous 20 years.  The results of the quiz were therefore a starting point for discussion as to why
this was so and how DEMO had happened.  In the UK context it is relatively easy to DEMO a similar
small business quiz as part of an introduction to a programme.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The quiz enables the existing knowledge DEMO to be tested.  It therefore provides the facilitator
with knowledge as DEMO the thresholds of learning of the students.  It is obviously a DEMO for
engagement of students in the learning process and for sharing with them the learning
objectives.
4. Outcomes
That students are given a clear DEMO for the learning that is to take place and have the
opportunity to question it.

39.  Use of Undertaking an Institutional Audit
1. What is Use of Undertaking an Institutional Audit?
There is wide agreement that the impact DEMO any entrepreneurial education initiative is dependent
upon the culture and structure of the organisation within which it is implemented.  It is also clear
that, in the Further and Higher Education context there are numerous initiatives that are being
pursued in the organisation of an entrepreneurial nature upon which DEMO initiatives can
build.  Examples include: careers service programmes; knowledge transfer DEMO; science and
technology park developments; business and industry information services; DEMO; students
projects; alumni engagement; visiting fellowships; publications; individual consultancies; and
secondments.  Finding entrepreneurial activities already being undertaken in the organisation
and the people pursuing them is a key strategic step for the entrepreneurial DEMO, providing
the opportunity for their engagement in partnerships, adding value to their existing activity.  In
addition it will be important to explore the formal strategic commitment of the organisation to
entrepreneurial activities, for example active contribution to regional development and
substantial concern for the use of knowledge DEMO in the organisation and reward systems
designed to underpin this.
The institutional audit is therefore a means for identification of key opportunities for the
DEMO
2.
How is the exercise conducted?
An Audit can be conducted by questionnaire, and/or by personal interview or merely, to be DEMO
with, by casual enquiry and estimation.  An example of an Audit Framework is shown below,
focused upon the last mentioned approach.  It is designed to test the awareness of the educator,
of the DEMO and structure of the institution in supporting entrepreneurial activity and, as DEMO,
provides the basis for building a strategy.  Reflecting the strategic DEMO, the final column
provides the analyst with the opportunity to assign DEMO for influence in relation to their own
capacity and resource.

40.  Use of Sales Pitch
1. What is Use of Sales Pitch?
The sales pitch is an exercise in selling a proposition to DEMO potential buyer.  This might be a
customer for a product or DEMO or a stakeholder who may invest in, or support in kind, a
venture.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The aim of DEMO exercise is to underline the importance of, and develop the capacity DEMO, selling a
proposition in a short snappy and attractive way.  A group can be charged with preparing a sales
pitch with one or DEMO of their members to deliver.  The customer can be a representative DEMO
another group playing a role or an external representing a ‘real’ client.
In the context of developing entrepreneurship education programmes it is important to DEMO
that there are a wide range of stakeholders who can support a programme in cash or in kind.
These include Regional Development Agencies, Local Government, independent and corporate
businesses, bankers, accountants, the legal professions DEMO local None Government
Organisations (NGOs) such as Local Enterprise Agencies.  DEMO of these have an interest in
developing graduate entrepreneurship.  Their needs, and therefore their reasons for offering any
support, may vary.  Sales DEMO needs to consider carefully the differential nature of stakeholder
needs.  The DEMO working on the sales pitch will be given a short time  DEMO brainstorm on the
client needs, how the ‘offer’ should be designed DEMO meet these, and also why the client might not
‘buy’ The DEMO pitch has to present a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) offer to the client in an
attractive manner.
An equal consideration is to recognise DEMO preparing the pitch that the reaction will not only be to
the argument but will also be conditioned by reaction to the person presenting DEMO also will be a
function of the clients’ views and prejudices as to the capacity of the organisation which the
‘pitcher’ represents.  In the above example there may be a prejudice against educational
institutions having enough DEMO experience to teach entrepreneurship.  Such prejudices will
have to be anticipated DEMO taken into account in designing the pitch.
The pitch is then appraised by the client group or individual.
The exercise can be used in DEMO fashion in a wide variety of different contexts, for example
selling DEMO business idea.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus is upon empathy with a client’s needs.  It is also about putting together a persuasive
argument in a short time under pressure.  It is also developing team-work to reach agreement on
an issue very quickly.
192
4. Outcomes
A key Outcome is recognition of the need to identify DEMO needs of different stakeholders
and therefore to package an argument in different ways.  The sales pitch is seen as a relationship
development instrument and as a means not only of selling something but as a vehicle DEMO
building trust.
193
41.  Use of Polls
1. What is ‘Use of polls’?
A poll is a means of engaging the audience in an issue which DEMO being discussed/presented.  It is
particularly useful when there are large DEMO of participants.  It can be used in a number of
ways:DEMO
a. to obtain a view of how much the audience already knows about an issue
b. to learn what the audience already thinks about DEMO issue
c. to identify the needs of the audience relating to personal or organisational
development
2. How is the exercise constructed?
This is DEMO by a simple questionnaire which can be quickly and easily answered – usually of a
simple scoring nature (agree or disagree or via a Likert scale).  It can be delivered in class or
circulated beforehand and the results collated to provide a basis for framing discussion.  If the
technology is available it can be used as an interactive device DEMO get audience/class participation
by the pressing of a button.
An example, used on the programme, is to question participants as to how DEMO see progress in
entrepreneurship education in key areas in their institutions.  DEMO results form a basis for
discussion as what needs to be done, which are the major areas for action and what actions can
be taken.
A poll can also be used as a means of focusing DEMO particular session on needs as identified by the
audience, For example DEMO audience of entrepreneurs can be polled prior to or during a
programme about key problems or opportunities facing them, It can also be used as a straw poll
feedback evaluation – what do you think?
DEMO Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The poll provokes engagement of the participants/audience; It is a vehicle for developing creative
problem solving based upon what the participants think.  It is also a vehicle for stimulating peer
learning as it becomes evident to the individual whether or not they are DEMO on an issue
and therefore will provoke thinking and interaction.  It DEMO gives ownership of the learning
agenda to the participants and demonstrates that the session is relevant to the needs/views of
the group.
4. DEMO
There is a stimulus to action resulting from peer pressure.  There DEMO also a stimulus to learning
from the others in the group who may have a more advanced or different perspective on an
issue.
194
42.  Use of Simulating Entrepreneurial ‘Ways of’
1. What is Use of Simulating Entrepreneurial ‘Ways of’
It can be argued that a key component DEMO from much entrepreneurship education is the
creation of a ‘feel’ for the way that entrepreneurs do, learn, feel, see, think, organise and
communicate things.  Drawing from a varied literature it can be argued that, as a result of the
close identity of the owner-managed a firm with the business, certain values are built interacting
with, and developed DEMO, a range of experience.  ‘Ways of’ can be characterised as3:

Possible ways of achieving measurable DEMO related to ‘Ways of’ include:
Ways of doing





Mini cases/critical incidents calling upon students to take decisions DEMO limited data
Following the development of frames of reference in class (DEMO start up process – of any
kind of organisation being one) DEMO made as to possibility of success and
reasons given (no business DEMO)
Creating a convincing argument for something with limited information – off the top of
the head in a limited time space
Giving students DEMO particular problem and asking them to identify as many opportunities
for solving it as possible – for example drugs in night clubs, nothing for young people to
do in the evening in their local community
Seeing DEMO activities/opportunities as know who – being about identifying relevant
stakeholders, DEMO with their needs and points of view and developing
strategies for carrying the opportunity forward.  For example, setting the students the
objective of DEMO up a college disco – identifying who they need to persuade, DEMO
the pros and cons seen from each of these individuals point of view might be, deciding
who best to use to persuade others etc (possible key stakeholders being teachers,
principals, parents, caretakers, canteen DEMO, local police, local householders, possible
stewards, local authorities re noise etc)
Ways of communicating

whether a person on a video is trustworthy
feedback on role play of a person in very different situations (for example re the disco
exercise above how should one ‘appear’ before a head teacher, police inspector, chairman
of governors, school caretaker).  The enterprising person/entrepreneur is a good actor

simple exercise to test understanding of the life world of a person (what changes in the
life of a teacher who decides to become self employed?)
exercise in understanding how strong ownership of an idea or ideology might influence
the way people present and defend their DEMO  Using, for example, a craftsperson
whose work is criticised in DEMO newspaper to get the student to understand how it might
feel when someone really owns’ something yet has it threatened.  Use of video or mini
incident and check responses
write a short story around a picture DEMO two people at a table where one is trying to
persuade the other to do something that he/she thinks is unethical
selecting two DEMO your friends/acquaintances (using fictitious names) explain why you
might trust one more than the other
given a list of entrepreneurial values explain DEMO these should be so
given a particular job description and two candidates, one with a great deal of formal
qualification and the other with a great deal of experience, how would you go about
assessing the two?

of different kinds of events – for example how to you assess how to trust someone?)
ask students to provide examples of different kinds of entrepreneurial experiences they
have had selecting from a list and DEMO them to evaluate results (for example, have they
ever tried to sell something, persuade someone to do something against their will,
defend something that you really believed was right but others felt was wrong)DEMO
explain what the use of some particular piece of knowledge might be to whom and why?
Ways of organising




DEMO

explain how to design an organisation to suppress enterprise
explain whether DEMO think the university/college is enterprising and why or why not
make a drawing showing what you believe to be the culture of the DEMO/college
and explain it
plan a project to determine the needs of older people in the community and how they
can be met
Ways DEMO seeing



students assume that they have to have to create their own living and wealth by hard
work and independent effort DEMO little support.  Asked to indicate how, this might
influence attitudes to increased taxation, a tax on inheritance, public expenditure on
subsidies to DEMO unemployed.
students are asked to assume that they are the boss of a small firm employing 14
people, many of whom have been with it for 20 years.  A government scheme is
introduced to encourage every employer to formally train every member of staff, keep
records of all training events and undertake formal training needs analysis.  You, as an
DEMO, are asked to contribute a percentage of your labour costs in DEMO form of a
payroll tax to pay for this.  If you DEMO all the paper work, keep records and send
your workers on DEMO training courses you will recoup most, if not all, of the tax.  Why
should you object to this?
students assume they have many years of experience in doing something and have been
reasonably successful.  An expert comes along and sets out new ways of doing things
DEMO upon objective analysis and theory.  What will be your attitude to DEMO and why?

Ways of learning





student wishes to start DEMO tennis club in your local area.  What does he/she need DEMO know
in order to progress the idea? How and from whom DEMO they get to know it?
student is thinking of setting up a local crafts and art gallery.  He/she visits several
galleries in other areas.  What would you be looking for?
students are lost in the mountains with minimum equipment and are faced with a night
DEMO freezing temperatures.  Describe what they might do to escape or survive.
DEMO are asked to list as many needs a possible that a sofa might meet (that might
reasonably be in the mind of someone wishing to buy one).
students are given a two-page summary of an DEMO for a business which is full of errors
and are asked, DEMO adding to the word count, to amend it so that it DEMO more
plausible.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus of all of the exercises is that of creating/simulating aspects of the considered ways DEMO
entrepreneurs might approach different problems and opportunities.  The aim is to DEMO
empathy with this world by ‘doing’.
4. Outcomes
Programme participants will gain a true ‘feel’ as to the way that SME owner/managers might DEMO
and do things and the rationale for their ‘ways of behaving’.
199
43.  Use of Simulating the Entrepreneurial ‘Life world’
1. What is Use of Simulating the Entrepreneurial Life World?
Most of the emphasis in DEMO Venture Programmes is upon the business aspects of the start up
process.  There is, usually, a strong focus upon preparing the business plan.  Traditionally, there
has been little concern with preparing individuals for their DEMO into a ‘life-world’ of
becoming an independent entrepreneur.  Many aspects of DEMO world will change – a situation
for which they are often ill prepared.  If, for example, one moves from employment to self-
employment then key changes may include:
Greater freedom/independence to choose ways DEMO doing things
Greater individual responsibility for shaping one’s own world
Greater personal ownership of events
Personal financial assets at risk and risk in disbursement
DEMO personal assets may be at risk (e.g. house)
Ego being DEMO at risk as business idea exposed
Personal responsibility for all outcomes
Having to cope with more uncertainty on a day to day basis
Greater DEMO vulnerability to changes in the environment and how to cope
Greater pressure to take initiative/make things happen in work and home life
Need DEMO flexibly undertake a wide range of tasks
Rewards directly linked to effort
Need to manage a interdependency with a range of people with ‘know DEMO and trust
the key
A situation where work, social and family DEMO are more integrated
Changes in friendship patterns
Greater links between personal effort and social status
More learning by doing and responsibility for learning
Need DEMO cope with loneliness
Need to work flexible and (often) long hours
It is a challenge to the educator to prepare programme participants for DEMO
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Several methods might be used initially to create awareness as follows:
i. By asking participants to DEMO a recent new entrepreneur about ‘what has changed’ and
how they have coped.  Then to discuss the different issues that have arisen from the
interviews in groups with the focus upon identifying what seem to be DEMO most important
aspects of being able to cope and ‘how do we get that experience’.  This can be followed by
asking participants, if DEMO are themselves in the process of moving into a new venture, DEMO
they expect will change and how they think they will cope with it – perhaps writing a ‘self
reflection’ note.  Alternatively participants can be asked to interview each other in this
context.
ii. By asking new DEMO into the class for ‘interview’ about their world’ changes and
how they have coped.  This is perhaps best done in small groups to create a more intimate
personal atmosphere.
iii. By use of an initial ‘critical DEMO approach as below:

The incident is prepared before the session by the facilitator as follows.
DEMO: to stimulate group discussion of the life world of the entrepreneur.
DEMO Question for Focus
What changes in one’s ‘way of life’ when one moves from employment to self employment?
Kate is a young single DEMO of 25 years of age.  She graduated from University two years
DEMO with a 2.1 degree in design – focused upon ceramics.  She DEMO always had a considerable
talent for art and design demonstrated from an early age.  She had worked herself up the
educational ladder in creative design by successful progress through further education, to a
Polytechnic and then to University.
Upon graduating she took a post at a school teaching DEMO but soon decided that this life
was not for her.  She DEMO more independence.  With the help of a small legacy from her
DEMO she set up her own studio, complete with kiln and embarked DEMO a career in self
employment.
What changed in her life-world as a result of this move?
The facilitator can draw from the group DEMO list of changes which can be used for discussion of the
nature of uncertainties and complexities facing the entrepreneur and the skills and attributes
DEMO might be needed to deal with them.  The group can be DEMO to speculate to what degree
her previous work and life experience might have helped her to cope.  For example, if she comes
from DEMO background of family business she may well be familiar with many of the aspects of the
life world noted above.  This can lead on to a discussion of why it is that one is more disposed DEMO
set up a business if one comes from an SME family.  DEMO might also be useful to explore what
aspects of the life world of being a teacher, prepares one for entrepreneurship and which do not.

Key Question for Focus
What changes in one’s ‘way of life’ when one moves from employment to self employment?
Kate is DEMO young single woman of 25 years of age.  She graduated from DEMO two years
ago with a 2.1 degree in design – focused upon ceramics.  She had always had a considerable
talent for art and design demonstrated from an early age.  She had worked herself up the
educational ladder in creative design by successful progress through further education, to a
Polytechnic and then to University.
Upon graduating she took a post at DEMO school teaching ceramics but soon decided that this life
was not for her.  She wanted more independence.  With the help of a small DEMO from her
grandmother she set up her own studio, complete with DEMO and embarked on a career in self

DEMO facilitator can draw from the group a list of changes which can be used for discussion of the
nature of uncertainties and complexities facing DEMO entrepreneur.
3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Understanding of the entrepreneurial life world is a much neglected area of entrepreneurial
teaching.  It is critical that learners appreciate the context in which entrepreneurial decisions are
made.
4. Outcomes
DEMO outcomes are all served by an appreciation of the entrepreneurial ‘life world’.
The situation in which an entrepreneur operates is a specific one for DEMO there is little
preparation which traditional courses, even those focusing upon DEMO ‘for’ entrepreneurship.
202
8. Next Steps
Determining the pedagogy is a key part of any DEMO and teaching strategy however this only
forms part of the considerations within an effective learning strategy.  Whilst this compendium
contains 44 pedagogical notes which form the basis for curriculum development, evidence suggests
that students need to value their learning and within the educational system, assessment feedback
and marks are the ‘currency’ that will motivate learners.  Therefore the experience of NCGE in the
UK indicates that entrepreneurial learning needs to be clearly demonstrated DEMO part of the learning
experience in the entrepreneurial learning outcomes, and DEMO to recognise and reward effort
and results.
To build an entrepreneurial mindset, the educational approach of ‘constructive alignment’ (Biggs
1996; 2003) will DEMO the development of an effective learning strategy.  Biggs advocates an
alignment DEMO sees the learning outcome, once crafted, aligned the assessment strategy.  DEMO
and demonstrable alignment between intended learning outcomes and assessment processes and
criteria will support the development of ‘fit-for-purpose’ assessment (Race 2007).  With DEMO inclusion
of appropriate pedagogy, the following linkages are apparent:
(Adapted from Baume, 2009)
To support the development of appropriate assessment, DEMO final guide will be now exploring these
issues within entrepreneurial education.
44.Use of Assessment of Entrepreneurial Learning
1. What is Use of Assessment of DEMO?
In general, conventional approaches to assessment of learning serve three DEMO purposes:
1.
2.
3.
To indicate to the facilitator of learning whether goals have been achieved: if so why so, and
if DEMO why not?
As a means for students to assess their own progress in learning.
As a means for grading of pupils for purposes DEMO accreditation (meeting standards).
203
Assessments are usually undertaken by the teacher or facilitator. An estimated 80% DEMO assessments
in Higher Education are undertaken by examination, essay or report DEMO methods.  They
represent a process of benchmarking students against each other DEMO the ultimate goal of
facilitating grading of students into degree categories.  DEMO also indicates that very often the
students are not absolutely clear on the standards and criteria being used for this benchmarking
process.
There is DEMO criticism of these forms of assessment within the education literature particularly in
terms of experiential learning (Race 2007).  In an entrepreneurship education DEMO it can be
argued that the assessment process should be one that helps to develop entrepreneurial capacities
and understanding of the life world of DEMO entrepreneur.  This involves therefore designing methods
of assessment that:
 DEMO greater ownership and control to the learner
 allow learning from mistakes
 involve opportunity for repeat practice by ‘doing’
 involve exposure to DEMO wider range of stakeholder assessors
 build commitment to see things through and improve
 build confidence and motivation
 encourage assessment by problem DEMO
 set clear targets and opportunity for improvement
 formulate assessments in terms of student knowledge of ‘how-to’ do things
 encourage students to DEMO the meaning of what they learn in different contexts and
to different people/stakeholders
There is much educational research to support the view that DEMO understanding only comes about
through application of knowledge to practice and argument.  Knowledge is internalised via a process
of the brain constructing ‘mind maps’ in the long term memory which form the basis for application
of DEMO to different contexts
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The major focus will need to be upon enhancing capacity for self assessment and DEMO assessment.
This is not always easy within the academic convention but there are a number of ways of moving
closer to this:
 DEMO time out at the beginning of a programme to allow students to familiarise themselves
with ‘how to’ deconstruct pieces of work undertaken by former DEMO and develop their own
frameworks for assessment and setting of standards
 similarly, rehearsing students in critiquing academic articles and setting standards for
appraisal and exploring how to best use academic work
 getting students to DEMO frameworks for assessing the written work of the facilitator and
discussing this
 getting students, by use of questionnaires and assessment forms, to DEMO the work of
others.  This is best done anonymously, or within clear parameters.
 provide facilities for students to truly expose their work DEMO stakeholders and undertake prior
preparation for such exercises by group brainstorming exercises on how and why stakeholders
might see the work and assess it
DEMO getting students to rehearse delivery of the results of a project via presentations and role play of
different potential user groups
 instead of DEMO marking a project and then moving on, provide feedback and discussion DEMO then
get the students to do it again – and again?
204





before asking students to write a piece DEMO work or project show them examples of best practice
and have discussions of these and practice marking them
provide a set of agreed criteria DEMO relation to a standard and allow the students to mark their
own work against this, indicating what they feel they have yet to learn
engage stakeholders in a none-threatening manner to take part in open discursive DEMO
For this they will need training and guidance to facilitate appropriately.
set standards relating to the application of knowledge from the beginning of a DEMO
making clear that the end results will be measured in terms of knowledge of ‘how –to’.
set out standards and discuss for different types DEMO work.  For example ‘what makes a sound
consultant report’
3
Relevance DEMO Entrepreneurial Learning
The aim of the above is to provide the means for moving the learning process nearer to an
entrepreneurial mode.  In particular to seek to simulate more closely the way that entrepreneurs
themselves acquire DEMO assess their learning, by doing, benchmarking personally against peers and
competitors, by trial and error, by bouncing their ideas and offers off DEMO in different
contexts and by testing their mind maps of ways of seeing and doing things by a process of constant
practice and reiteration.
DEMO Outcomes
Students will be better able to take charge of their own learning and therefore be better equipped
for a process of Life-Long Learning.  They will also be more strongly motivated to learn not just for
DEMO sake of passing exams.  Facilitators of learning will also be in DEMO better learning position
themselves.
Three approaches which illustrate this approach are contained within the appendix 2.
205
Summary
This compendium provides an overview of the psychological and educational foundations DEMO
teaching to support the development of the entrepreneurial mindset. By first defining enterprise,
entrepreneurship and innovation, the concept of entrepreneurial teaching is developed to support
the delivery of entrepreneurial learning outcomes. These are designed to DEMO an
entrepreneurial mindset which can be employed within a range of contexts, which include, but are
not exclusive to, small business start-up. This seeks to create an ability to apply learning – the
enhanced capability DEMO take action and behave – rather than purely upon the conventional delivery,
testing and critical assessment of knowledge inputs. This creates entrepreneurial learning DEMO
offers an ‘integrated, embedded enterprise experience’ (Price 2005) that builds DEMO, attitude
and skills, whilst exposing the student to the entrepreneurial life world (how it ‘feels’ to be an
entrepreneur) – an otherwise DEMO issue (Gibb, 2002, Cope, 2006, Cope and Pittaway, 2007).
To support the educator with their choice of pedagogies, 3 route maps are provided to help
educators reach that ‘near entrepreneurial experience’ (Ohe 1996) within the safe environment of
the classroom. These route maps are provided to a high level of accessibility for the educator, which
together with their standardised format, allow for changes to be made in the classroom, with
learners, immediately.
Although the focus of entrepreneurial teaching is DEMO ‘small group learning’, as the optimum method
for supporting the development DEMO higher level skills within learners (Kolb 1984), route map 3 DEMO also
designed to provide inspiration to those constrained by working in large lecture theatres, or seeking
to create blended learning within their learning strategy. However it is critical that the educator
seeks to achieve higher level DEMO development, within their students, through experiential learning
which is recognised to be the most effective when the learner is actively engaged with the DEMO
process. Seeking this level high of engagement should then be the driver to selecting the most
appropriate pedagogy for each outcome, and become the foundation of an entrepreneurial learning
strategy (assessment; activity; outcome, Baume DEMO).
Adaptation and experimentation is then the key, embedding these pedagogies DEMO your teaching
and working through the constraints that class sizes and timetabling made provide. However, by
using the entrepreneurial learning outcomes and aligning your choice of pedagogy to reach these,
you can support the development DEMO a life-long entrepreneurial mindset in your students.

Appendix 2: 3 examples of entrepreneurial assessment
Example 1: Entrepreneurial Assessment DEMO Pedagogical Note:  ‘Exploring the Enterprise Culture in a
Globalisation Context’: DEMO use of Drama
Stage 1 Aim: to give the students ownership DEMO standards and marking criteria.
Students are asked to read a paper as background to a Masters Module on the Entrepreneurial
Society.
Attached is a DEMO paper to the module.
Please read carefully
As Group Work in the next session you will be asked to critique this paper.
The key DEMO for the groups will be:
1. To establish a set of criteria for assessing an academic paper such as this.
2. To determine, in the light of these criteria, how you would allocate marks to different
components out of a total of 100.
3. To mark the DEMO accordingly.
4. To present your view of what makes a good academic paper, how you set criteria to
establish this, and how you DEMO different weights in a marking system and what mark
you gave to it and why?
This exercise is ultimately conducted in class and DEMO the end there is a full discussion and attempt to
obtain agreement (under tutor guidance) as to what constitutes a sound paper and DEMO good marking
schedule. This is then written up by the tutor and handed out.
Stage 2 Aim: to assist students to personally internalise and see the relevance of learning.
Using the paper as a guide students DEMO the asked to write a short essay, using the framework in DEMO
paper, as to the impact of the issues mentioned in the DEMO on their own life world to date and
their work and social/community futures. The issues raised are then discussed in class.
Stage 3 DEMO: to help students explore and understand the wider context of entrepreneurship DEMO
use empathy in creating frameworks for interview.
Students are asked to go out and individually interview a random set of persons in society about DEMO
impact of globalisation on their work, personal and social lives. They DEMO given examples as
standards for discussion in class and then work in small groups to help each other to create frames
for interviews of DEMO types of people.
Stage 4 Aim: to help students understand the DEMO and how they will be assessed and marked.
Students are handed out an example of a very good write up of an interview and DEMO to discuss
why this is deemed good. The tutor then goes through the example with the aim, via discussion, of
producing a marking DEMO and bring to the attention of students why they lose marks. In particular,
to underpin the notion that the focus of the interview DEMO write up is not on what the interviewee
thinks about the issues of globalisation but what is happening to them as a result.
208
Stage 5 Aim: to indicate how the knowledge gained in the interview will be used via a drama process
and why this is important.
DEMO are led into a twofold brainstorming discussion. First, on the use DEMO drama and what they
see as the use of this in an entrepreneurship context; then second, why a drama exercise is
important to DEMO work. The discussion will focus here upon the emotional and subjective
nature of all responses to questionnaires and interviews. Also that academics rarely go DEMO to their
interviewee and ask, ‘Is that what you really meant?DEMO Therefore they are to be asked to put
themselves inside the shoes of the interviewee and also watch for the body language during the
DEMO
Stage 6 Aim: to get students to take ownership of their DEMO from the interview, get them to
synthesise and discuss with others DEMO create meaning out of it.
Students are asked.  in facilitated groups, to role play in a ‘hot seat’ their interviewee, then
determine key common messages for their interviews, develop a message and a metaphor and build
and perform a drama.
Stage 7 Aim: to create a framework for a peer assessment process.
Also discussed at this stage is that DEMO drama will be peer assessed.  The marking, methods and
criteria for assessment are discussed.  Students are given examples of previously assessed dramas
and these are discussed.  This enables the tutor to warn as to problems that might occur (for
example, that in the excitement of creativity DEMO entertainment, the message is lost).
Stage 8 Aim: to review relevance of learning and the use of drama.
After performance the class DEMO debriefed on:
 what they feel that they have learned in respect of the relevance of entrepreneurial
behaviours and culture to society;
DEMO what they ‘feel’ about the drama process and their own personal reactions as to what they
have got out of it (if anything);DEMO
 what they think about the use of drama in the promotion of business and other
organisations
