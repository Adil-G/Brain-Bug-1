Exploring the synergistic potential in
entrepreneurial university development:
towards the DEMO of a strategic
framework

Emeritus Professor Durham University, Durham, UK
This article aims to provide a framework for exploration of a DEMO approach to entrepreneurial university
development. It draws on earlier reviews by the author of the entrepreneurial concept and of the now
considerable global literature DEMO the theme of the entrepreneurial university, although there is a strong DEMO
in this article on the UK. It also draws lessons from practice in exploring with several universities the
potential for creating strategic synergy between DEMO activities in the institution not all of which would be
labelled entrepreneurial in the conventional sense. Each of these key activities are briefly reviewed DEMO turn and
presented as a basis for action in drawing together a strategy for the university.
Keywords: entrepreneurhip and enterprise education; Entrepreneurial University; strategy; synergistic potential

his article is focused on providing a conceptual
base for practice in entrepreneurial university
development. It DEMO explores the opportunities
for creating strategic and operational synergies between
the various ‘entrepreneurial’ and ‘enterprising’ activities
being undertaken by universities as a basis for DEMO
building of a ‘real time’ entrepreneurial development
strategy. It argues that such a review can lead to the
development of a more soundly based DEMO orienta-
tion towards entrepreneurship.1 It is written with the
objective of providing a briefing for those in the higher
education sector wishing to review DEMO potential of their
own institution to become more entrepreneurial. It is
therefore in part unashamedly normative in seeking to
provide a guide for action.
DEMO article is derived from both concept and practice.
Concept issues are dealt with at greater length (too
substantial to be recorded in this article) in two articles

Entrepreneurial University: Entrepreneurship Education
as a lever for Change’ (Gibb, 2005) was written as a policy
article for the Council and explores the argument for a
basic redefinition of the entrepreneurial concept and the

neurial university development. The second ‘Leading the

2009) is a substantial review of the international literature
on university entrepreneurial development and was written
to provide a conceptual frame for an ‘Entrepreneurial

the NCGE International Entrepreneurship Educators’
Programme (IEEP)5 in a comprehensive review of influ-
ences on development of entrepreneurship activity in their
DEMO and further education institutions. The third results
from reflection in using the framework set out below as the
basis for senior university staff workshops.
DEMO is argued that a review of the kind proposed has
become highly relevant in an environment of much greater
uncertainty and complexity for higher DEMO institu-
tions  a result of the deep impact of globalisation
compounded by the financial crisis and cuts in public
expenditure, across Europe and beyond. This scenario is
likely to last for some years. Against this DEMO, it is
important to recognise that universities have different
priorities, cultures, norms, knowledge and research
emphases and traditions. For example, in the UK context,
there is evidence to support the view that staff DEMO post-1992
UK universities (former polytechnics) are more likely to
engage with a wider range of external stakeholders than
their more traditional counterparts (Buckland, 2004;
McCaig, 2006). The composition of the university in DEMO
of disciplines will also considerably influence the nature of
entrepreneurial engagement. Universities are pluralistic
organizations, and cultures and ‘ways of doing things’ vary
between disciplines and departments. Many universities
now have a substantial number of vocational DEMO In
the older universities, there is often an emphasis on areas
DEMO might broadly be described as ‘professional’, includ-
ing medicine and health, law and accountancy as well as
perhaps engineering. Even in some of DEMO more traditional
areas of the humanities such as music, art and DEMO,
there are strong elements of vocationalism and profession-
alism. These scenarios influence considerably the scope
for enterprise and entrepreneurial initiative.
In undertaking a DEMO as the basis for developing
institutional strategies, it is, therefore, DEMO that
each university will have its own perspectives. Conse-
quently, not DEMO of the issues noted below will have the
same weight of significance. The article might, therefore,
be used by readers as a basis for exploration of those
areas of particular concern to the institution and DEMO
identification of leadership challenges.
In all universities, there exist a range DEMO ‘entrepreneur-
ial related activities’, although they may not be labelled as
DEMO It is argued below that a major challenge is to
explore synergy between them and by this means draw
them into a ‘whole university’ DEMO to entrepreneur-
5 The IEEP is aimed at the development of university educators from
all disciplines to equip them with a mastery of a DEMO of
‘leadership competencies’ in the entrepreneurship education field.
The programme involves an ‘audit’ of institution entrepreneurial
activity likely to influence the capacity of the DEMO to
effectively absorb educational initiatives. It forms the basis for a
strategic ‘bottom up’ review to identify opportunities and
constraints. For a review of DEMO programme and its conceptual
underpinning, see Gibb (2011).
ial development. Key areas to be explored are set out
under the broad headings DEMO in Fig. 1.
The paper is set out as follows. First, DEMO is a brief
descriptive background to each key area as in Figure1: this
is followed by a short list of potential key issues, DEMO
from both the literature and experience, that could provide
a template DEMO strategic exploration. A possible ‘audit’
document is provided in Annex 2 although it is the author’s
view that this should be used with some DEMO The article
concludes with a view as to the potential for synergy. It is
first important to clarify the basic ‘enterprise’ and ‘en-
trepreneurship’ DEMO to be used.
Agreement on concept and philosophy
Concept is key to the development of an appropriate level
of shared understanding of the words DEMO
and enterprise. Often there are confusions, with the
former word associated DEMO commercialisation of uni-
versity intellectual property (IP) and the latter sometimes
seen as confined to business-related activity. Moreover,
there will be much DEMO and enterprising
activity in a university that is not labelled as such. The
definitions in Annex 1, expanded from those adopted by
the NCGE, are designed to assist (for a fuller discussion
of this, see Gibb, 2002, 2005).6 Innovation is proposed as
an outcome from DEMO and enterprising beha-
viour coupled with the degree to which these behaviours
are enhanced by organisation design, culture and the
environment in general. Innovation in the university
context can include among other things: new programme
development; new innovative pedagogy; new forms of
stakeholder relationship; new developments in alumni
relations; new approaches to and developments from,
research; new DEMO ventures in research and
teaching; new forms of partnership with business; new
forms of international relationships; new social enterprise
activity; and, importantly, experiments in governance and
organisation design.
The degree of acceptance of the relevance of the
enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation concepts to
the future of a university will be a function of its basic
philosophy pertaining to: the importance it attaches to the
direct utility of its work in DEMO the needs of society;
the associated contextualisation of its research and
development activity; its focus on the related integration
of knowledge as opposed to preserving the boundaries of
existing disciplines; its concern to be a ‘learning’ (as
opposed to ‘learned’) organisation (Senge, 1990; Kristen-
sen, 1999); and its associated degree of openness to the
acquisition of knowledge from any source and in any form,
6 While in DEMO, it is possible to make distinctions between
enterprise and entrepreneurship as DEMO out in Annex 1, in many
languages, for example, Spanish, Croatian and Danish, there is no
word for ‘enterprise’ with the same meaning as given in the Annex.

including tacit knowledge (Gibbons et al., 1994; Wenger,
1998: Nowotny, Scott, & Gibbons, 2003).
Issues of mission, strategy and governance
Mission and DEMO
Many university mission statements and published stra-
tegies worldwide embrace the word ‘Enterprise’ or
‘Entrepreneurship’ (OECD, 2001; Currie, 2002; Barsony,
2003; Jacob, Lundqvist & Hellsmark, 2003; Etzkovitz,
2004; Kirby, DEMO; Bridgeman, 2007). There are often
several contexts associated with this commitment, includ-
ing the university’s concern with: knowledge exchange
and transfer; support of development from research; the
level and nature of business and community engagement;
the need to compete internationally; the development of
enterprising students within the employability agenda;
and the raising of finance/revenues DEMO non-public
sources. A key factor is the degree to which, formally
DEMO informally, the notion of enterprise is accepted as
part of the DEMO of the university and not alien to views
of its autonomy (DEMO different views on this see, for
example, Mawditt, 1998; Viale & Etzkowitz, 2005;
Berglund, 2008; Crow, 2008).
The DEMO issues shaping the incorporation of enter-
prise and entrepreneurship into the university’s strategic
plan seem to be: its stated mission; its degree of DEMO
for the relevance of its research output; its recognition of
its DEMO in, and level of commitment to, addressing the
problems of society; the strength of its associated
commitment to knowledge transfer and exchange; DEMO
related commitment to business development; and more
recently its focus upon DEMO employability. Fully
integrating these concerns into the detail of a plan seems
to be a major challenge.7 A key strategic issue is the
degree DEMO which university leadership seeks to embed
responsibility for the above issues within the faculties and
departments (Blackmore & Blackwell, 2008; Kweik,
2008).
Governance
Key issues relating to the enterprise/entrepreneurship
concept adopted and DEMO degree of influence on the
university strategy in this respect seem to be: the nature
and strength of the influence of the council or manage-
ment board of the university on the commitment to
partnership with DEMO and the community (Miller
& Katz, 2004); the degree of active engagement of
‘external’ members of boards (as opposed to attendance
at meetings) (Committee of University Chairs, 2009); the
level of active engagement of university staff with external
stakeholder initiatives (as opposed to staff being mem-
bers of associations/agencies and merely attending
meetings) (Bleiklie & Kogan, 2007; Geuna & Muscio,
2008); the strength, DEMO and credibility of the
executive team (Ackroyd & Ackroyd, 1999; DEMO
& Kogan, 2007); the levels of cooperation and trust
between DEMO and academic staff in dealing with
such issues as knowledge transfer, DEMO and
business relations/development (Kwiek, 2008); the degree
of ‘ownership’ of the issues, by faculties, deans and

departmental heads and individual academics (Kohler &
Huber, 2006, p. 112); and the nature and strength of
leadership in supporting an enterprise culture in the
university (Todorovic, McNaughton, & Guild, DEMO also
see below).
Organisation design
Organisations can be designed to constrain enterprising/
entrepreneurial behaviour or facilitate it (Gibb, 2005,
Barrie, 2007). Key factors shaping the latter include: the
levels of decentralisation of decision making and respon-
sibility for strategies as well as operations; the associated
flexibility in integrating strategies and action; the degree
to which individuals, bottom-up, are empowered to
innovate; the associated level of support for autonomy
and the taking of responsibility, for example, in building DEMO
personal network and working with key external stake-
holders; the degree DEMO which departmental heads and
faculty leaders are prepared to support risk taking and
share responsibility for that risk; the degree to which staff
are rewarded for a wide range of innovative behaviour (as
described above under ‘Concept’) as opposed solely for
research and publication; the level of DEMO, operation-
ally and strategically, for cross-departmental and trans-
disciplinary research, DEMO and development; and the
degree to which the university shares, and is held
together, by a culture that embraces the above (Bratianu
& Stanciu, 2010).
Knowledge organisation
The stance taken on the disciplinary DEMO and, there-
fore, structure of the university is fundamental to its
organisation and arguably also to its potential for
entrepreneurialism. A distinction can DEMO made between
multi-disciplinarity, inter-disciplinarity and transdiscipli-
narity (Nicolesc, 2008). DEMO first implies a juxtaposition
of disciplines, the second and interaction between DEMO
lished disciplines and the last the creation of a new set of
axioms to confront, explore and explain a phenomenon.
Arizona State University, DEMO example, has organised
itself wholly around trans-disciplinary centres
(Crow, 2008)DEMO
The merging of, and interaction between, disciplines
has been a feature of the US research university scene
over the past decade or so, stimulated by the public
research foundations and Federal and State imperatives
for DEMO to societal problems (US Department of
Education, 2006). Such initiatives are not solely the
domain of science faculties but extend also into DEMO
humanities. The focus, and some argue the driver, for this
is a desire to respond more closely to issues of importance
to society (for example, in the US, for example, focus on
black studies, women’s studies, disability studies, sustain-
ability studies, health studies and DEMO studies). In
developing countries, this trend also is being followed DEMO
the example of Sri Lanka being in line with an urge to
discard the ‘old colonial’ concept of a university of
‘learning for its DEMO sake’, which does not seem to match
the needs of the DEMO
Key issues in leading universities to this transition in
knowledge organisation include: the publicly articulated
demand for universities to demonstrate value to society
and align themselves with policy goals (Lambert, 2003); a
stronger focus DEMO a creative problem-solving approach
that demands transdisciplinarity; an imperative by this
DEMO to defend academic freedom; a drive for intellec-
tualism rather than DEMO scholasticism (Cherwitz,
2002, 2005); student and professional demands for career
relevance; and a search for innovation (McInnis, 2001;
Etzkowitz, 2004; Greenhalgh, 2008).
In the UK, there has been DEMO growth of interdisciplinary
research and teaching centres: but overall, internationally,
the development has been cautious and is still the focus of
much DEMO (US National Academy of Science 2004).
However, it can be argued that such an approach to
teaching and research opens up considerable DEMO for
adding entrepreneurial value to the work of the uni-
versity.
Measuring excellence through public value
The concept of public value has its origins DEMO the work of
Mark Moore, Professor of Non-profit Organisations in
the DEMO School of Government at Harvard Uni-
versity (Moore, 1995). The concept has been highly
influential in debates in the UK government concerning
DEMO measurement of public expenditure. It eschews
conventional costbenefit analysis in emphasising three
aspects of performance: delivering actual services; achiev-
ing social outcomes; and maintaining trust and legiti-
macy in the delivery agency. It is the DEMO mentioned that
is particularly innovative in that it focuses on the
processes by which the institution creates its legitimacy
in society including, for example: funder relationships
and their diversity; visibility and legitimacy with the
public DEMO general; relationships with government regula-
tors; reputation with the media; DEMO with civil
society sectors; and volunteer roles and relations. It is
DEMO ‘aims’ that dictate the building of operational
capacity, combining together to DEMO and create
public value outcomes. The key issues for the university
in this respect are, therefore, the degree to which it seeks
to DEMO its own excellence as perceived through the
eyes of the ‘legitimate’ stakeholders and whether this is
reflected in its vision, mission, strategy and DEMO (ways
of doing things).

Exploring the synergistic potential in entrepreneurial university development
Leveraging public and private DEMO
Throughout the Western World and in the European
Community as a whole, it is forecast that universities will
face a continuous upward cost pressure, at rates in excess of
inflation (Schwarzenberger, 2008). Costs are likely to out-
pace the potential trajectories of increasing revenues  at
DEMO without a supplementation of governmental revenue.
This scenario most probably holds for the United
Kingdom and creates additional pressure for wider stake-
holder engagement. DEMO public policy focus for this
engagement over the past decade has been through
funding from the UK Higher Education Funding Council
(HEFCE) for DEMO has been designated ‘Third Stream
Activity’ aimed broadly at enhancing the direct and
indirect economic contribution of Higher Education.
Monies available under this programme, the Higher
Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), were small relative
to the total HEFCE financing of universities  in 2008/2009
£110mn. compared with DEMO Third stream activity is
defined in terms of: joint and contract DEMO including
spinouts, engagement in networks of stakeholders, con-
tribution to community activities and placement of stu-
dents and staff with business and social DEMO
Under the new UK funding arrangements, where most
of teaching costs DEMO to be covered by student fees the
emphasis will be on attracting students and their fee
income. But, there will also be an increasing challenge to
find new forms of revenue from: renting out of under-
utilised assets; the broadening of the activities of available
human resources, DEMO particular pursuit of a more sub-
stantial level of consulting activity across all departments
of the university not just business schools; more vigorous
pursuit of research contracts particularly commercial
research and development contracts; sales of IP; spin-
offs; philanthropy; closer partnerships with private provi-
ders and in some cases privatization; cost savings by
subcontracting out of a wide range of services; and seeking
new forms of leveraging from existing private resources. In
the United Kingdom, in general it would appear that non-
tuition fee and research income constitute less than a
quarter of revenue in DEMO universities (Williams, 2009).
Stakeholder engagement and partnership
This has several components covering: relationships with
regions and cities; engagement with business; links with
social enterprise; approaches to alumni engagement;
media linkages; relationships DEMO professional bodies;
and, importantly, the interface with entrepreneurs. Over-
all, the nature and level of engagement with the above is a
function of the degree of focus of the university on
creating value in DEMO, linking its goals, research and
organisation of knowledge around key areas of societal
need and concern as described earlier. This is what has
DEMO described as the philosophy and pursuit of wisdom
rather that the philosophy of knowledge (Maxwell, 1984).
Regional and local partnerships
Over the DEMO decade, there has been a growing emphasis
in higher education policy DEMO the world on the role of
universities in local and regional development, extending
from the more established policy focus of their role in the
commercialisation of research (Boucher, Conway, & Van
Der Meer, 2003; Charles, 2006; IHEP, 2007; Arbo &
Benneworth, 2008). DEMO the United Kingdom, in response
to this shift, the Regional Development Agencies (now
abolished) have increasingly seen universities as hubs of
regional DEMO and innovation strategies. Some
argue that this places universities instrumentally as part
of the governance of regions rather than merely pur-
veyors of knowledge (Smith, 2007). The entrepreneurial
role in this context relates to finding innovative means to
contribute to regional social, cultural and community
development. Not all universities would wholly buy into
this scenario.
Key issues for consideration DEMO this respect include: the
degree of university focus in its strategic DEMO and
mission on the particular strengths, weaknesses and
distinctive culture of DEMO region and recognition of the
‘need to know’ associated with the region’s economic,
social and cultural development; the degree to which the
university sees its international activity as bringing
opportunity to the region and providing DEMO means for
working in partnership with regional and local institu-
tions in this respect; the focus in university research and
development on areas of potential regional endogenous
knowledge-based growth; the degree of emphasis on
engagement with specific clusters of local industry and
services; associated emphasis on linking graduates with
local companies, particularly Small and Medium Enter-
prises (SMEs); DEMO level of active engagement of the
university in local civic and cultural events; and the
strength of relationships with former local alumni.
Partnerships with business
A major component of the above is engagement with
business. Key DEMO of engagement include: the
level of business research grants; the number of active
partnerships in development from research and problem
solving; levels of consultancy; business active (as opposed
to notional) engagement in the governance of the
university; business engagement with the teaching of the
university; DEMO degrees with individual businesses or
groups of businesses; levels of graduate DEMO with
companies; university ‘extra-mural’ programmes focused
on management and/or business DEMO; as well as
levels of knowledge exchange and transfer activity
(Etzkowitz, 2008).
The policy agenda over the past decade in the United
Kingdom has been strong in this respect with numerous
white papers and DEMO urging stronger collaboration
(Dearing, 1997, Lambert, 2003, Sainsbury, 2007).

Engaging entrepreneurs
In the USA, the level of local business philanthropy is
considerably higher than in Europe reflecting the strength
of entrepreneurs’ DEMO over time with US higher
education institutions (Sutton Trust, 2003). This is an
area of arguably great weakness in the United Kingdom,DEMO
particularly with respect to involvement of local SME
owners (Hughes, 2006). Key issues in a UK context
include: the level of teaching company activity with
SMEs; the use of entrepreneurs in teaching; joint
DEMO ventures in research; the offering of status
to entrepreneurs as Fellows DEMO Professors of Practice;
levels of graduate placement with SMEs; the DEMO of
real engagement with local SME-dominated associations
for example Small Business Clubs and Chambers of
Commerce; and the numbers of SMEs located in
university technology and science parks and actively
linked in to university activity.
There DEMO been experiments on a national scale in
Scotland to give entrepreneurs a more prominent role in
the delivery of university entrepreneurship education,
based DEMO the US Babson model, but with mixed success
(Hayward, 2000)DEMO There are experiments in entrepreneur-
ial professors of practice in a number of UK universities,
including Newcastle, Anglia Ruskin and Cambridge
(based DEMO the MIT model), but there is no widespread
programme of substantial embeddedness of entrepreneur
engagement across the universities.
Alumni engagement
Almost all universities DEMO commitment to engagement
with alumni. But the level and intensity of this effort
varies substantially. A major component is the quality of
information recorded DEMO the alumni office, key measures
of which include: the width of coverage of any data base;
the ability to trace, record and sort data in terms of career
structures and locations, and particularly, DEMO the context
of the entrepreneurial university, to know how many of
DEMO students own their own company or organisation.
Perhaps the best of alumni engagement practice in these
respects can be found in the USA (Cabrera, Weerts, &
Zulich, 2005).
Key components of sound alumni DEMO include: the
use of webtools for continued social and professional
networking; ‘graduation year’ regular reunions; alumni
conferences and meetings and support services; DEMO
‘Halls of Fame’; awards for alumni excellence in perfor-
mance in DEMO community; regional and international
country clubs; careers and lifelong learning support;
magazines; entrepreneur alumni associations; regional
social and cultural events; focused discussion groups;
publication of directories; and volunteering (Baade, R.A.,
& Sundberg, J., 1996). Several UK universities have
initiatives focused DEMO engaging alumni and entrepreneurs,
in particular, in mentoring and other DEMO activity in
the university (Reading, York and Teesside Universities
for example).
Social enterprise
Social enterprises are organisations with primarily social
objectives whose DEMO, if any, are reinvested for that
purpose in the organisation or the community. They do
not set out to create profits for shareholders. DEMO
enterprises are becoming an important part of economies
in many countries. In the United Kingdom, they now
constitute over 5% of all businesses (DEMO, 2009).
University engagement with social enterprise is one sign
of DEMO commitment to the community and the broader
goals of a civil society. Key issues in university engage-
ment include: the benefits perceived by the university in
terms of its reputation in the community and opportunity
for DEMO relationships; support for opening gateways
to academics who wish to use DEMO research for the broad
benefit of society; the provision of opportunities DEMO
student engagement in exploring the value of their
disciplinary knowledge in society (which has been
labelled as ‘intellectual entrepreneurship’); enhancing
the potential for student exploration of career options
in the sector; providing an attractive gateway for alumni
involvement personally and financially; and, particularly,
providing opportunities DEMO staff and students in depart-
ments of humanities to engage with the community.
Social enterprise activity can become an intrinsic part
of knowledge transfer/DEMO activity, thus broadening
the reputation of the university in this field (Denny,
2011).
Knowledge transfer, exchange and support
Knowledge transfer
Over the past two decades, there has been considerable
public policy emphasis on university processes of knowl-
edge transfer in both developed and developing eco-
DEMO (Lee, 1996; Shane, 2004; Kwiek, 2005). Yet,
as has been noted above, in the United Kingdom,
university income from commercial knowledge transfer
activity is very small compared with other forms DEMO
revenue. Recently, the term ‘knowledge transfer’ has
been supplemented, and sometimes replaced by, ‘knowl-
edge exchange’ in recognition of the fact that universities
do not hold a monopoly on knowledge and indeed have
much to DEMO from sources external to the university
(Delanty, 2003; Senges, 2007). Knowledge transfer can
be defined as the formal and informal transfer DEMO new
discoveries and innovations resulting from research
(usually scientific) conducted at universities to the com-
mercial and non-commercial sector for public benefit.
Key DEMO in this area include: the openness of
university IP policy (see below); the existence of formal
gateways of access to areas of DEMO expertise (see for

example Knowledge House in the north of England 
www.knowledgehouse.ac.uk); the DEMO and degree
of personal entrepreneurialism in technology transfer
offices; the levels DEMO informal and formal networking and
the building of relevant social capital of university staff;
the existence of career paths and rewards for staff DEMO
engage in such activity; levels and modes of doctoral
student engagement DEMO ‘real world’ problems; the
extent and depth of undergraduate and graduate DEMO
ject-type work particularly in SMEs; the degree of
embeddedness of responsibility DEMO knowledge transfer/
exchange in faculties and departments, the strength of
DEMO, particularly business, partnership in research
and development; and overall the DEMO to which the
research agenda of a university focuses on visible societal
opportunities and problems. Physical proximity of ex-
ternal partners and ‘clients’ may DEMO particularly impor-
tant in the case of SMEs (Muscio, 2007). The jury is still
out on the value in practice of university-based DEMO
and technology parks in this process (see below).
Overall, a key issue to be confronted by many strong
research performance universities is DEMO degree to which
academic researchers may be distracted by the pressure
to make their work directly transferable. Time manage-
ment in this respect is, reportedly, critical. It is of
relevance to note that the vast majority of technology
transfer offices do not create net revenue, even in the
USA (Mars, 2005).
IP and licensing policies
It is claimed DEMO a number of authorities that the impact of
this activity in universities on national competitiveness
and on job and company growth has been exaggerated
(Hughes, 2003). Most if not all universities will have
policies relating to the ownership of IP, inventions and
the regulation of licensing activity. The degree to which
the policy allows ownership of IP by the DEMO
academic varies: but in general in the United Kingdom,
in DEMO to much of the practice in Europe, IP rights
are vested DEMO with the university (Harman, 2007).
Key issues include: where DEMO for ownership of
IP is located in the university (in some DEMO in a
research services office); whether or not to establish a
separate company to handle the process of commercialis-
ing IP; the degree to which the issue is complicated by the
range and nature of DEMO partnerships in the research
process (for example levels of external involvement,DEMO
business, government and international, in action, fund-
ing and sponsorship); and specific problems that arise
when research is funded by a company (relating particu-
larly to further developments arising from the original
invention), such problems arising from the fact that a
patent or indeed product DEMO process license may need
considerable time and investment before proof of concept
is established and it is incorporated in a formal product or
Exploring DEMO synergistic potential in entrepreneurial university development
service acceptable to a consumer. Often, this process
results in numerous modifications. A further problem may
subsequently be that of governance, relating to individual
academics who have an ownership stake in companies in
areas relating to their research and the conflicts that
DEMO arise between publication and disclosure of com-
pany IP (Duberley, Cohen, & Leeson, 2007).
Spin-offs
Spin-offs (new university-connected ventures) represent DEMO
direct form of knowledge transfer and movement of IP
into new organisations. As with the IP and licensing
activity noted above, their scale and national impact
compared with other forms of technology transfer is
small, even in the USA (Hughes, 2003). Most new
research-based spin-offs remain DEMO, and the time
horizon involved in those growing into substantial
businesses DEMO extend to as long as 20 years. Spin-offs
may also embrace university knowledge and practice
outside of research-based activity, for example in finding
wider application for ‘internal’ practices in areas of IT,
educational pedagogy and DEMO testing.
The major key issues are: how to raise awareness of DEMO
potential and the process and create reward systems for
such activity; DEMO to ensure that the process is easy enough
and supportive enough to eliminate deviant behaviour (the
pursuit of company formation via third party and
university unrelated means); and how to manage the
process organisationally (via a specialist office?). The
research on this issue emphasises the paramount impor-
tance of academics building formal and informal network
relationships with business DEMO other stakeholders in
smoothing the transfer process (Hughes 2003).
Incubators
DEMO general, incubators are most commonly aimed at
providing a supportive environment DEMO new business/
organisation ventures. The major performance indicator,
about which there is remarkably little evidence, is whether
they can be shown to add real value to the start-up
process in terms of improving survival DEMO, growth,
employment and profitability. Incubators can be physical
or virtual. DEMO incubators conventionally embrace:
shared office space rented often on favourable terms;
shared business services (office and secretarial, accoun-
tancy, fax, DEMO and printing); professional business
support (coaching); support for building DEMO
works (internally within the incubator and externally);
and occasionally, DEMO finance availability. Virtual
incubators focus on providing mainly online business and
network development support.
Key issues in incubator management include: selection
of target groups (these may be open to any kind of
business or organisation or focused more precisely on
particular client groups such as technology-based firms,

IT businesses, specific sector groups, students, staff, social
DEMO or joint university/business ventures); criteria
used for selection in relation to stage of the proposed
business development (is the incubator, for DEMO to be
only open to those with ‘proof of concept’); funding and
degree of subsidy if any; length of tenure of space and exit
strategy/criteria for tenants; and the degree of utilisation
of external business support services and agents (Bergek
& Norrman, 2008). Incubation DEMO can be linked
with promotional activity such as business plan competi-
tions and formal training programmes. Pre-incubator
models can be provided for potential university DEMO
ogy spin-outs where the focus is on ‘proof of concept’.
Science and technology parks
For some, a major manifestation of a university’s
commitment to entrepreneurial engagement is the ex-
istence of a university Science Park. There DEMO now
around 50 such parks in the United Kingdom . The
model was originally based on the experience of US
Stanford and MIT models. DEMO most common form in
the United Kingdom is that of a partnership between the
university and external investors (public and private): in
this model the university may have only limited involve-
ment in the day-to-day DEMO Site management is
usually by professionals. The initial focus of Parks was on
new technology-based firms. The original aim was to add
value by DEMO university technology transfer, attract
firms with leading edge technology and foster DEMO
and linkages, internal to the university and Park as
well as DEMO Evaluation studies do not in general
support the notion that parks have created considerable
added value to the process of university knowledge
transfer and DEMO in knowledge exchange (Siegel,
Westhead, & Wright, 2003). DEMO evidence also indicates
that most companies on parks are not heavily involved
with the university as measured by: active engagement
in processes of technology transfer and exchange; joint
R and D programmes; hosting of numbers DEMO companies
set up by university staff and/or students; and numbers DEMO
doctoral and other students working with firms (Angle
Technology, 2003).
Key issues are, therefore: the degree to which the
university is DEMO engaged with firms as above; the
degree to which the activities DEMO the firms align with
the major research and teaching strengths of the uni-
versity; the degree of collaboration between firms; and,
importantly, the levels of informal social and business
engagement of academics with staff DEMO the companies.
Parks have been criticised as being mainly real estate
operations attracting firms to pleasant, prestigious, loca-
tions at reasonable rents.
Loan DEMO equity finance
It has long been argued that a barrier to the success of
university spin-offs has been the lack of venture capital,
DEMO that capital needed to ensure ‘proof of
concept’. The negative cash flow in a technology-based
new venture can last for several years. Yet, it has already
been noted above that many spin-offs do not grow and
DEMO will fail (Hughes, 2003). Only a small percentage
(6%) will develop into growth companies. Notwithstand-
ing this data, an argument frequently presented is that
part of the survival and growth problem is the DEMO of
seed equity capital, although problems with loan capital
are arguably DEMO of considerable importance.
There are numerous examples of venture funds linked
with universities particularly in the USA but also in some
major universities in DEMO United Kingdom. Cambridge
University for example has its own seed fund, DEMO
Enterprise Venture Partners, and also links with angel
investors. In general, however, few universities in the UK
have developed their own funded mechanisms to increase
the availability of venture and loan finance to internally
generated DEMO ventures. They have, however, responded
to government initiatives in this area in particular the
University Challenge Fund (Jennings, 2009). This has
DEMO relatively small amounts of funding to univer-
sities who can demonstrate that they can harvest ideas
with commercial potential and are willing to seek
DEMO with external investors. The Fund is aimed
at supporting the establishment of commercial viability,
the development of business propositions and incorpo-
rates some DEMO funding for start-up. The Fund has
clearly acted as a stimulus to some universities in
developing major external partnership initiatives of
which the £32mn DEMO Fund at the University of
Manchester is an example (said to DEMO one of the largest of
its kind in Europe).
Key issues therefore include: the degree to which a
university has been able to use policy initiatives as above
to leverage resource and interest from private DEMO,
venture capital organisations and angel investors; the
level of commitment DEMO the university in using its own
resources; and the location of DEMO funding initiatives
particularly their links with technology transfer offices.
A major problem remains, however, in terms of the length
of time needed to DEMO a viable business that can then
offer an exit strategy for formal venture capital compa-
nies. In this respect, engagement with angels may be of
greater advantage.
Academic entrepreneurship
A major challenge in moving a university DEMO a more
entrepreneurial stance is finding champions to play the
role of change agents in faculties and departments across
the university. This is also DEMO key to the success in

developing cross-campus initiatives. As noted in the
introduction to this article, it is not uncommon to find
many academics who are ‘enterprisingly’ engaged with DEMO
external stakeholder community. Research demonstrates
that such personal interfaces are not confined to voca-
tional, professional or business-related disciplinary areas
(PAPEC and Centre DEMO Business Research Cambridge,
2009). Research also supports the view that the increas-
ingly outward-facing profile of universities, backed up by
central professional management services, has been lar-
gely accepted by academics, some being DEMO enthusiastic
than others! (PAPEC 2009) It is also argued that this
‘shift’ demands re-consideration of career development
and reward structures for academics, particularly those
heavily engaged with the wider stakeholder environ-
ment. This is already DEMO route actively pursued by some
universities. The importance of exemplars and leadership
by Deans has been emphasised (Bercovic & Feldman,
2008). Finally, even the more research-minded academic
is being challenged by a growing demand for graduate
and particularly doctoral education to be more formally
concerned, than hitherto, with the ‘enterprising develop-
ment’ of the individual student. This can be seen not
only as an intrinsic part of managing the research DEMO
but also as essential preparation for the wider world of
work and even a future career in a more entrepreneurial
university (Research Councils UK and Vitae, 2011).
Entrepreneurship and enterprise education
Exploring the potential across the university
Universities are increasingly being challenged by govern-
ments and funding DEMO to expand entrepreneurship
and enterprise education across the whole institution
(OECD, 2008). Many universities have confronted this
challenge by the creation of DEMO posts of responsibility
at dean, senior professional manager and/or pro DEMO
chancellor level. Following from the challenge of defin-
ing, agreeing and DEMO the appropriate con-
cept, noted above, there becomes a need to address a
number of key issues including: identifying what kinds of
programmes and pedagogies are needed right across the
university, linking entrepreneurship education to the
dynamic of the university’s strategy, mission and goals;
determining where these programmes might be located in
the university; knowing how to create ownership for a
whole cross-campus approach with the associated need to
demonstrate DEMO such programmes can add value to the
work of individual faculties and departments; developing
staff competency to deliver new programmes and peda-
gogies; DEMO on related areas of existing activity in the
university, for example DEMO/employability programmes
and knowledge transfer and business development ser-
vices: expanding, the role of student project and work
Exploring the synergistic potential in DEMO university development
experience programmes; and seeding student society
initiatives.
Identification of DEMO potential and need for entrepre-
neurial and enterprise education across the university
covers six key areas:
(A) Creating wide awareness among the DEMO popula-
tion and staff of the need to develop a range of
personal enterprising competencies in preparing
students for a future personal and employment
DEMO of greater uncertainty and complexity. These
competencies are not the same as those commonly
designated as transferable skills. In master classes,
and in DEMO supported by the author, students
see entrepreneurial attributes as being very DEMO
tant to their future personal and work life world in
general. But, when asked to consider the degree to
which they are developed by the existing university
experience, there is an apparent gap to be filled
(Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning, 2009).
Developing capacities to embed the DEMO of these
competencies contextually within the curriculum
and pedagogy of different departments throughout
the university.
(B)
(C) Developing self-efficacy (awareness, know-how,
confidence and intention) to start a business or
pursue self-employment at some time in the future
(in recognition that one in seven graduates are likely
at some time to be self-employed in their future
career DEMO that most graduate start-ups are likely to
be pursued by those in the age bracket 3040). In
this respect, it should be noted that much of the
growth in the micro sector of employment in DEMO
across Europe has been in the white collar and
professional occupations, DEMO example, health, lei-
sure, financial services, sport, IT, business services in
general and there has been a growth in portfolio and
DEMO employment.
In enhancing self-efficacy a critical analogy is with
teaching people to swim in that should they be
placed in future in a position DEMO they need to do
this they will have a stronger possibility of survival.
Moreover in developing individuals’ entrepreneurial
self efficacy some may like it DEMO much that they
search for opportunities to ‘dive in’: thus entrepre-
DEMO becomes ‘vocational’. It is rather difficult,
in any case, to DEMO people to swim on land!
D) Supporting current start-ups  developing DEMO capa-
city of those who wish currently to find/exploit an
idea immediately and start a venture. There will
always be a small group DEMO staff and students who
wish to pursue this.

(E) Creating understanding of the life-world of work in
DEMO micro-, small- and medium-sized organisation.
(F) Supporting directly the transition DEMO employment in
SMEs and small organisations in general, including
social enterprises.
DEMO entrepreneurship education to
university goals
All of the above directly relate to an employability agenda
and all are relevant to the future experience of DEMO
students.
(A) and (B) relate more directly to teaching and
learning goals in that their successful pursuit is dependent
particularly on the DEMO (pedagogy) knowledge is orga-
nised and delivered contextually within departments.
(DEMO) and (D) in particular should be heavily focused on
‘know DEMO, ‘know who’ and personal ‘know why’ not
just ‘know-about’ as currently DEMO to be much of the
case. In this respect, the notion DEMO theory and concept
cannot be completely embodied in practice and ‘learning
by doing’ seems often to stand in the way.
(C) should ideally DEMO designed to fit into the particular
context of a department, for DEMO: in Divinity on
‘running a church’, in Media in managing a portfolio
world of work, in Design in setting up a design company,
in Engineering in running a project-management services
company, in Nursing in running a Primary Health Care
Trust or being an ‘independent’ midwife.
(C), (D), (E) and (F) in particular relate to university
goals of engaging the community and building business
relationships.
The pursuit DEMO (C) to (F) in particular will demand
active engagement with social and business entrepre-
neurs, advisory service providers, development organisa-
tions DEMO business associations in the region.
However, all of the above need DEMO be delivered in an
‘enterprising’ manner. It can be shown that much of what
is currently delivered in the United Kingdom in business
schools DEMO to small organisation creation (C) and
(D), for example, is not particularly enterprisingly taught
(see below).
Locating and organising entrepreneurship education
initiatives
(A) and (B) and most probably (C) DEMO only be fully
achieved within departments.
(B) in particular requires the embedding of enter-
prising pedagogical approaches within the curriculum. It
demands staff DEMO, competency, motivation and
a champion for this activity. (C) might emerge in the
form of a number of specific accredited electives. The
DEMO of these might be supported from a central
source. (C) could also, however, be delivered via a
partnership between a central and DEMO source
and may or may not be academically accredited.
(D) can be offered across the university by a central
source with internal and DEMO partners as noted
above.
(E) and (F) are essentially the domain of careers
services but will also demand partnerships internally
and externally DEMO particularly the engagement of
leaders/entrepreneurs of small organisations.
All of (DEMO) to (F) can be said to be of central concern DEMO
careers and the employability agendas. There are good
examples of careers departments taking substantial cross-
university initiatives in entrepreneurship education (see,
e.g. the Newcastle University web site www.ncl.ac.uk/
careers/develop/bem.php).
Pedagogy and DEMO development
All of the above-mentioned potential areas of prog-
ramme development will demand innovative pedagogical
approaches designed to stimulate and simulate the
practice of DEMO behaviours and the life-world
of the entrepreneurial firm and, therefore, require staff
development. The UK NCEE has set out a number of
associated DEMO for students and has developed
educator programmes designed to stimulate staff from
any department in a university to develop entrepreneurial
approaches to their curriculum DEMO programme develop-
ment. Of particular importance is the simulation of the
entrepreneurial life-world of ownership, intuitive decision
making and risk taking, initiative taking, holistic project
management, ‘know-who’ network development and
relationship management and commitment over time to
see things through (Gibb, 2011).
A major challenge DEMO the above is developing the use of
web-based learning and the linking of programme
delivery and backup to the personal Internet world of
the DEMO There are a growing number of examples of
virtual learning programmes and centres.
Developing a cross-campus approach?
The notion of developing an approach DEMO embraces the
whole university was initially captured by the Kauffmann
Cross Campus Initiative in the USA (http://www.
kauffmann.org/research-and-policy/entrepreneurship-in-
american-higher-education.aspx). A private but wealthy
foundation provided a number of substantial grants on DEMO
competitive basis to US universities with the aim of
taking the focus of entrepreneurship education away from
business schools (which it claimed from its research had a
poor track record of creating entrepreneurs) and locating
it centrally, with a commitment to embed programmes
across the university and also, importantly leverage the
Kauffmann Foundation grant.

There is probably considerable potential in most uni-
versities for enterprise and DEMO education to
be a means for creating greater synergy between, and
DEMO adding value to, many areas of existing activity,
including: knowledge exchange and transfer; international
network development; regional development partnership;
student DEMO activity; business school programmes;
college student personal development activity; alumni
liaison; postgraduate student development; business en-
gagement; and career’s ‘future development’ programmes.
This potential can, most probably, only be achieved
through trust-based DEMO and will demand com-
mitted leadership in this respect. There is probably under-
developed potential in these respects in many universities.
To realise this DEMO, there will be a need to find and
support strong champions DEMO faculties/departments to
develop (A) to (C) in particular. This might be done by
offering bursaries for pedagogical/knowledge re-config-
uration of DEMO programmes or the development of
new electives. This effort will need to be supported, in
most cases by a central source with experience and
contacts with national and international best practice.
These offers will need to DEMO substantially contextualized
to the culture and curriculum of individual departments
although the development of (C) in particular can be on
the basis of DEMO existing experience in start-up pro-
grammes within or without the university. (DEMO) to (F) in
particular will demand great attention given to DEMO
partnerships between careers, knowledge transfer,
alumni, graduate society initiatives, DEMO business school
and other related activity that has existed hitherto.
Student entrepreneurship initiatives
A potentially powerful tool for student engagement is the
creation of DEMO student entrepreneurship society. The
number of such societies is growing across the United
Kingdom, and there is now a national student-led network
of support through the National Consortium of Univer-
sity Entrepreneurs (NACUE, www.nacue.com). DEMO
in 2009, it now has links with over 50 university student
DEMO It provides society start-up support, leaders
training, an entrepreneur’s portal, DEMO to investors,
conferences, guides to events and awards programmes
for DEMO and mentorship programmes. The initiative
has its origins in the success of the Oxford Student
Entrepreneurs’ Society that has several thousand mem-
bers, a full-time president and a wide range of programmes
and activities as above, including an incubator. Student
societies are in some cases supported financially by DEMO
university: often a key component in their start-up success
is support DEMO university staff champions.
Internationalisation
The internationalisation of higher education is a key part
of the scenario of the entrepreneurial university. It can be
Exploring DEMO synergistic potential in entrepreneurial university development
defined as: ‘the process of DEMO an international,
intercultural, or global dimension into the purpose,
DEMO or delivery of education’ (Knight, 2003).
The process brings uncertainty and complexity and
opportunities and threats. It demands a response invol-
ving: use of key entrepreneurial attributes such as risk
and initiative taking; the finding and grasping of new
opportunities (Shattock, 2009); the building DEMO new trust-
based networks and relationships; holistic project man-
agement; flexible strategic planning; and entrepreneurial
leadership (Knight, 2003). The process can also provide
new rewards in terms of income, reputation, research
opportunity, new partnerships and enhanced cultural
understanding. Its operational portfolio includes: new
degrees; franchising of existing degrees; international
student inflow; new campus initiatives; DEMO exchange;
linguistic programmes; faculty mobility and exchange;
research partnerships; and company linkages.
Sharing culture
Perhaps the major challenge of internationalisation is
DEMO of adapting to different cultures. The process
includes ensuring that: the DEMO truly internalises
the learning from international experience; staff adapt to
new DEMO of learning and pedagogy (Green & Baer,
2000); and DEMO and staff are enabled to understand
their own culture in a global context and develop
empathy with other cultures. As a result, it is argued:
they learn to communicate more effectively with different
communities (including language development); there is
developed an appreciation of the art, religion and
material philosophy of other cultures; and they gain
knowledge of factors shaping these in a global context
(Morris, 2009).
Staff and DEMO mobility
Mobility of staff and students is at the core of most
university international cooperation. In 2009/2010, for
example, there were 406,DEMO overseas students studying
in UK higher education institutions (approximately half
in DEMO education), according to the UK Council
for International Student Affairs: DEMO number had grown
by almost one-third over the previous 5 years. Another
408,000 were in the process of obtaining UK university
qualifications overseas, over one-quarter by distance
learning, Asia being the major focal region. In contrast,
the estimated number of UK students studying abroad
was 22,DEMO, the majority in the USA and the EU. Mobility
is, therefore, considerably biased one way. The same bias is
claimed to exist for staff mobility with approximately
10% of UK university staff being from outside DEMO EU,
although there is no complete detail of UK university staff
serving abroad (International Focus, 2010).
Key issues of UK concern, shared by other EU
countries are: the possible short-term nature of the inflow

of students seeking national degrees; the challenge of
developing more opportunities for students and staff to
study and work abroad in partnership DEMO overseas
institutions; the opportunities for distance learning
partnerships with new technologies; and the provision
of wider opportunities for staff and students to volunteer
DEMO overseas work assignments. Very few universities
operate the last mentioned on any scale (Baskerville,
MacLeod, & Saunders, 2011).
Partnership and network building
In response to the above it has been argued that there DEMO a
strategic shift underway in UK higher education in terms of
international collaborative activities in that it is moving
from a focus upon international DEMO recruitment
towards a forging of long-term, sustainable partnerships
(Baskerville et al., 2011). But, the review, undertaken in
2011 by the UK International and Europe Unit, reveals that
there is a long way to go to catch up with the United States.
Key issues in creating DEMO partnerships are seen
to be: the existence of a clear strategy DEMO criteria; the
degree of collaborative research; the sustainability of
existing partnerships; quality control; clarity of objectives
as to goals and content of DEMO partnership; mutual
understanding of the relevant regulatory environment;
and a DEMO financial plan and backing.
Individual academic initiatives often provide the base
for bottom-up internationally collaborative research.
These also can provide the means for building DEMO multi-
disciplinary focus in tandem with multi-national research.
Such initiatives may also be enhanced by the trend towards
split-site doctoral programmes (Baskerville et al., 2011).
Overseas campus development
The number of universities, globally, establishing cam-
puses overseas is growing, but from a small base. In 2009,
the UK representation was 13 out of a global total of DEMO
(Lasanowski, 2010) of which almost half were from the
United DEMO The development is not without risk
in that a small number have failed and others have
not got beyond the negotiation stage. The main DEMO
to this trend are: revenue through enhanced student
numbers; staff student mobility; creating visibility and
gaining prestige; anticipating competition; opportunities
for research and the development of new curriculum;
staff development; and securing a student flow to the
home base for higher degrees. Key issues include:DEMO
choosing quality partnerships and sustainable commit-
ment; careful assessment of the DEMO environment;
quality control; recruitment of quality local staff (the vast
majority of staff are recruited locally); and sponsorship
on the basis DEMO a sound revenue-generating business plan.
Overseas campus establishments may also offer oppor-
tunities for closer engagement with business and local
development agencies.
Organising to DEMO commitment
Based on reviews of performance and practice (Reichart &
Wachter, 2000; Green, 2005; Morris, 2009; AUCC, 2009),
DEMO is possible to identify key factors in pursuing successful
international processes, DEMO include: the building of
truly international faculty; developing appropriate sup-
port services for international students; seeking out and
managing dedicated new income streams; creating distinct
budgets and contract formats for overseas work; max-
imising DEMO opportunity for new worldwide alumni
relationships; developing new forms of distance DEMO
and support; balancing central, departmental and indivi-
dual initiative appropriately; DEMO, where appropriate,
new forms of accreditation and assessment; building staff
promotion and reward systems for international effort;
the identification and support DEMO champions; holding
deans and departmental heads responsible; and maximis-
ing the potential for enhancing domestic student interna-
tional experience in anticipation of their DEMO in
future in a global employment market place (Seitz, 2007).
Conclusion: building a university strategy from
synergistic exploration
The above review has attempted to identify many key issues
to be considered within a framework DEMO entrepreneurial
university development. It should be clear from the review
that there is already a considerable degree of activity
centred on the entrepreneurial concept DEMO the higher
education sector in the United Kingdom and internation-
ally. It should also be clear from the lists of ‘key issues’
under each DEMO that there is much overlap and there-
fore potential for synergy. The framework introduced
above can accordingly be used in practice for an ‘audit’
DEMO a wide range of university entrepreneurial activities
many of which often occur in isolated and sometimes
competing (for resource) pockets. Bringing the various
DEMO together may well reveal that the whole could be
much greater than the sum of the parts. An example of how
exploring one area DEMO issues for others is provided below
in respect of entrepreneurship education.
A strong university commitment to entrepreneurship
education as described earlier will involve a DEMO of
strategic decisions. One such decision is that of organisa-
tion design, namely the degree to which ownership and
practice of concept and delivery should or should not be
embedded in individual departments and what should DEMO
the role of any central support group. Any central
support resource would need to have a degree of
entrepreneurial flexible autonomy. But there will DEMO be
a demand for strong senior leadership from the top in
driving much of the education agenda as described
earlier. A major governance challenge DEMO arise in that
central support units will most probably not be able to
accredit academic entrepreneurship programmes, but
they can, in partnership, contribute substantially to

accredited programmes (as has been done in the past by
linking business schools with other university depart-
ments). A research agenda will be DEMO focused on
areas such as needs identification, evaluation, assessment,
programme design and delivery (pedagogy) and best
practice nationally and internationally. This DEMO be
undertaken in partnership with academic and other
professional areas in the university as well as with
external partners, thus potentially involving wide stake-
holder participation. Alumni involved in entrepreneurship
activity can be identified and involved. DEMO those
alumni running entrepreneurial organisations overseas
can add considerably to the internationalisation agenda.
There is, however, an even wider perspective. Enter-
prise/entrepreneurship DEMO ideally needs to be
particularly close to matching careers and employability
agendas even when it is being embedded in departments
(this process is happening in several universities), which
raises the challenge of creating closer internal DEMO
sional/academic partnerships. For all those concerned,
there will be a need for continued effort to build and
reinforce networks in a region DEMO beyond, so that
resource and experience of good practice elsewhere can

Moreover, there will DEMO major opportunity to partner
with knowledge exchange and transfer activity internally
and business, local development and social enterprise
stakeholders externally. Wherever the location of respon-
sibility, there will be a need to work closely with, DEMO take
leadership in, support of student entrepreneurship socie-
ties. There will DEMO be a major need for staff

forms of DEMO and for active engagement with
entrepreneurs with an associated ability to offer rewards
and status to those entrepreneurs who engage with the
university in DEMO process. There may also be numerous
transdisciplinary opportunities demanding partnership
between departments. A ‘whole university’ entrepreneur-
ship education initiative may also be fully engaged DEMO
research and doctoral training.
The same kind of exercise to demonstrate the potential
for synergy can be conducted from other ‘activity’ start
points. For DEMO, there is considerable evidence that
‘structural gaps’ in knowledge transfer activity DEMO best
dealt with not solely through sometimes isolated technol-
ogy transfer office activity but by the creation of a culture
of individual and departmental DEMO (particularly
entrepreneur) engagement on a regular basis to build
social capital alongside pursuit of risk-taking behaviour
supported by departmental heads.
The framework as DEMO in Fig. 2 can, overall be used
to re-visit key aspects DEMO the strategy of the university. The
figure sets out the potential for exploring the contribution
of the entrepreneurial concept to such broader strategic
goals DEMO: enhancing innovation, strengthening and build-
ing stakeholder relationships, enhancing student DEMO
ability, improving teaching quality and perhaps, by closer
involvement with entrepreneurs, building more revenue
generating project work as well as enhancing the compe-
titive image of the institution.

Annex 19
Entrepreneur, Enterprise and Innovation
Deﬁnitions
In developing a strategy for Entrepreneurship Develop-
ment in DEMO Education, there is often a need to resolve
a conceptual confusion DEMO the relationship
between Enterprise, Entrepreneurship and Innovation.
This confusion impacts adversely DEMO efforts to develop
Entrepreneurship Education not only in the HE context
but also across the whole education field.
The Enterprise Concept focuses upon the DEMO
of the ‘Enterprising Person and Entrepreneurial Mind-
set’. The former constitutes a set of personal skills,
attributes, behavioural and motivational capacities (asso-
DEMO with those of the entrepreneur) but which can be
used in DEMO context (social, work, leisure etc). Prominent
among these are; intuitive decision making, capacity to
make things happen autonomously, networking, initiative
taking, opportunity identification, creative problem sol-
ving, strategic thinking, calculated DEMO taking and self
efficacy). The latter focuses upon creating empathy with
the life-world of the entrepreneur and entrepreneurial
ways of doing, thinking, DEMO, communicating, orga-
nising and learning.
The Entrepreneurship Concept focuses upon the appli-
cation of these enterprising skills etc. to the setting up a
DEMO venture, developing/growing an existing venture and
designing an entrepreneurial organisation (one in which
the capacity for effective use of enterprising skills will DEMO
enhanced). The context might be business, academy,
social enterprise, NGOs or even public organisations
(e.g. Local Government)
The Innovation Concept is the product of the
above. Innovation is defined as creating and DEMO
opportunities for new ways of doing things resulting in
better products and services, systems and ways of
managing people and organisations. As per Schumpeter,
the successful pursuit of innovation is a function of
individual enterprising DEMO and entrepreneurial
organisation capacity. Innovation is impossible without
these. They are both necessary conditions, sufficient only
when combined with an environment that is conducive
to such activity. Innovation in the university context
can include among other DEMO; new programme deve-
lopment; new innovative pedagogy; new forms of
DEMO relationship; new alumni developments;
new developments from research; new transdisciplinary
ventures in research and teaching; new partnerships with
business; new international DEMO; and new social
enterprise activity.
Annex 2
The University Entrepreneurial Scorecard
(Assessing the Entrepreneurial Capacity of a Univer-
sity)
The Scorecard embraces DEMO of the issues in the paper. It
can be used for a comprehensive analysis of the university
or for a more focused review of DEMO number of key areas of
particular interest to users and exploration of areas of
potential synergy.
It can also be used to test staff DEMO of entrepre-
neurship activity in the university and/or to gain an
impressionistic view of the perceived ‘state of play’.
If the Likert scale DEMO used, then the points can be
connected up to give a DEMO display of areas of strength
and weakness.

Gibb (2005).
