Although nascent ventures DEMO not yet developed a performance-based reputation, the
individual reputations of their DEMO, based on the performance of their earlier ventures, can
function as important signals to investors. Selection system theory distinguishes between
different types of DEMO as well as different types of investors, in order to analyze DEMO
particular types of reputations affect the investment behavior of particular types of investors.
The empirical setting of this paper is the Dutch film industry, in which we study the impact of
different types of reputations of DEMO and directors on the investment decisions of the
three main investors.

1. Executive summary
Nascent ventures ﬁrst DEMO to acquire essential resources, especially investment capital, before they can compete in
product markets. This paper studies the decision making behavior of investors DEMO respect to nascent ventures, and in particular
the role that the DEMO of the nascent venture plays in determining the size of the investment. Of course, nascent ventures
cannot yet have a performance-based reputation. However, DEMO nascent venture's founding members are likely to have individual
reputations derived from the performance of earlier ventures in which they have been involved. DEMO turn, investors can evaluate the
viability of the current nascent organization DEMO the basis of the individual reputations of these founding members.
While earlier studies focused on the general effects of corporate or individual reputations on DEMO investment capital, a major
contribution of this study is to distinguish DEMO different types of reputations and different types of investors, and then DEMO how
particular types of reputations have an effect on particular types of investors. We do this by applying selection system theory, which is
an approach to understanding competitive processes by focusing on the identity of the DEMO makers whose evaluations determine
the outcome of these competitive processes. The three basic types of selectors are: market selectors, peer selectors and expert DEMO
This tripartite classiﬁcation allows us to categorize types of reputations on the basis of their sources. First, if a reputation is based
on success in consumer markets, for example (end-) consumers' quality perceptions of DEMO speciﬁc brand of shampoo, it can be
linked to market selection. DEMO, a reputation type can be linked to expert selection if it DEMO from expert judgments. An
example is a credit rating agency such as Moody's. Third, if the reputation is based upon success among peers, for example winning
an award at the ‘Oscars’ where the jury largely consists of other ﬁlmmakers, it can be linked to peer selection.
At the same time types of investors can be categorized by considering both DEMO characteristics and the goals of the investors
making the investment decisions. First, if investors back a venture because they primarily hope that many consumers will like and

buy the product they can be identiﬁed as market selectors. DEMO, if investors are (industry) peers of the founding members of DEMO
new venture they can be identiﬁed as peer selectors. Third, if DEMO are neither market nor peer selectors they can be categorized as
expert selectors. This tripartite categorization opens the way to the main argument of DEMO paper: nascent organizations will be
more successful in attracting investment capital DEMO an investor if their founding members have performance-based reputations
of a type that matches the type of the investor.
In the empirical section of DEMO paper we test this argument by studying the impact of the reputations of producers and directors
on the investment decisions of the three main DEMO in the Dutch ﬁlm industry: distributors, television broadcasters and the
Film Fund. We ﬁnd support for our main theoretical argument, namely, distributors, representing market selection, are indeed
affected by market reputations, although only DEMO of producers. Broadcasters, representing expert selectors, attach the greatest
importance to expert reputations of directors but not producers. Reputations of non-matching types can DEMO have a negative
impact on the willingness of investors to provide investment capital. Only the Film Fund's investment behavior does not show
results DEMO conﬁrm our hypotheses.
Although the Dutch ﬁlm industry has many case-speciﬁc aspects, the arguments in this paper seem applicable to nascent
ventures competing for investments in other contexts in which the founding members of new ventures DEMO performance-based
reputations. The results of this study could create awareness among entrepreneurs about the beneﬁts of matching different types
of reputations of the key DEMO members of nascent venture with the types of investors and their respective evaluation criteria.
In turn, this could help new entrepreneurs to improve their chances of ﬁnding adequate ﬁnancing by composing the founding
team in such DEMO way that the particular reputations of its' members have the greatest DEMO impact on investors' willingness to
provide start-up capital.
2. Introduction
An DEMO resource base (Brush et al., 1993; Davidson and Honig, 2003; Parker and van Praag, 2006), and especially adequate
ﬁnancing (Ueda, 2004) is essential for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs who are setting up new DEMO can attempt to access different
sources of investment capital, ranging from DEMO members (e.g. Bates, 1997) to venture capitalists (VCs) (e.g. Franke et al., 2006). In
order to ﬁnd external ﬁnancing for their nascent venture, entrepreneurs have to favorably impress potential investors. This suggests
that entrepreneurs should be able to beneﬁt from knowing the particular evaluation DEMO that potential investors use in their
investment decisions. A number of earlier studies analyzed the evaluation criteria that are used in the decision making DEMO of
particular types of investors, especially VCs (Hall and Hofer, DEMO; Franke et al., 2006, 2008; Petty and Gruber, 2011)DEMO
Hall and Hofer (1993) found that the characteristics of the founding members of a new venture did not seem to play a role DEMO
VCs evaluations. However, Franke et al. (2006) found that similarities DEMO the personal characteristics of VCs and members of
new ventures lead to a bias in the selection process. They found that especially educational background DEMO professional
experience biased this selection process. Additionally they assert that this similarity has a positive effect on evaluations of start-up
teams. Our study builds DEMO these earlier studies by showing how different types of reputations of a new venture's founding members
inﬂuence the investment behavior of different types DEMO investors in relation to this new venture.
Earlier research shows the importance of corporate reputation on the behavior of stakeholders in general (Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990), and investors in particular (Stuart et al., 1999; Certo, 2003; Higgins and Gulati, 2006). This creates a DEMO for an
entrepreneurial venture that is nascent and in the stage of acquiring ﬁnancial capital, since it will not yet have a corporate
reputation at the organizational level. However, the key individuals setting up the new venture can have individual-level
reputations derived from the performance of other organizations DEMO which they are, or have been, involved. Our study focuses on
the effect of performance-based reputations of a new venture's founding members DEMO different types of potential investment
capital providers. We build speciﬁcally on studies that investigate the impact of top management team characteristics on investor
behavior (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Gorman and Sahlman, 1989; Muzyka et DEMO, 1996; Cohen and Dean, 2005; Franke et al., 2006,DEMO
2008; Beckman et al., 2007; Pollock et al., 2010).
Reputations, however, are multidimensional constructs (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Rhee and Valdez, 2009), and the
evaluation of reputations can vary across different stakeholders (Fisher and Reuber, 2007). In this study we DEMO distinguish
between different types of reputational signals. These are an expression of evaluations by different types of selectors, namely:
market reputation signals, DEMO reputation signals, and expert reputation signals. We study the relationship between DEMO three
types of reputations and these three matching types of investors by employing selection system theory (Wijnberg and Gemser,
2000; Wijnberg, 2004; Priem, 2007; Gemser et al., 2008).
Selection system theory DEMO between three basic types of selectors: market, peer and expert. The theory aims to explain
the outcome of competitive processes by identifying the DEMO type of selector in a particular competitive arena, as well as DEMO
ways in which selectors and selected interact. It is possible to identify to which type of selector particular investors in new ventures
belong. This DEMO focuses on the question whether investors, that can be identiﬁed as DEMO types of selectors – market, peer or
expert, are indeed more strongly inﬂuenced by reputational signals – market, peer and expert – that are of a matching type.
Earlier studies applied selection system theory to DEMO competition in product markets. For example, how winning or being
nominated DEMO an award impacts box ofﬁce revenues of mainstream or art-house ﬁlms (DEMO et al., 2008). Employing selection
system theory to better understand DEMO ﬁnancing stage further tests the usefulness of this framework and also extends the theory itself.
Our empirical setting is the Dutch ﬁlm industry, where producers and directors attempt to ﬁnd investment capital for their ﬁlm
projects. DEMO earlier studies focused on the determinants of competitive success in the ﬁlm industry (e.g. Eliashberg and Shugan,
1997; Basuroy et al., 2003). However, these studies focused predominantly on the last stage of the competitive process, when the
374
J.J. Ebbers, N.M. Wijnberg / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (DEMO) 372–384
ﬁlm has been made and competes for ticket sales at DEMO box ofﬁce. Our study will be the ﬁrst to focus completely on the ﬁrst stage
of acquiring the necessary investment capital needed to produce DEMO ﬁlm in the ﬁrst place. Selection system theory offers an
appropriate framework to differentiate between types of investors and explain their investment behavior.
Film DEMO, in their role as ﬁlm investors, can be classiﬁed as market selectors, because they try to predict what the market, in
terms DEMO end-consumers, likes. Therefore the question arises: do distributors attach a disproportionate weight to the market
reputation of ﬁlmmakers in terms of their past DEMO' box-ofﬁce success? A subsequent question in the context of this investment
decision is: do distributors differentiate between the market reputations of the producer versus that of the director of the proposed
ﬁlm project? Moreover, DEMO do distributors – being market selectors – value a reputation among peers? A reputation, for example,
that derives from being nominated or DEMO an award, constitutes a peer reputation when the jury consists of DEMO ﬁlmmakers.
In the theory section we review the literature on selection system theory and reputation, on the basis of which a number of
hypotheses will be proposed. This will be followed by a description of the DEMO setting and the data. The paper will be rounded
off with a conclusion where we discuss the limitations of our study, the implications of our ﬁndings, and possible interesting areas
for future research.
3. Theory and hypotheses
3.1. Setting up new ventures
There are a myriad of factors DEMO determine whether individuals will attempt to set up an entrepreneurial venture. However,
before a new venture can compete in the eventual product market, it ﬁrst needs to convince stakeholders that it is a legitimate
venture (Delmar and Shane, 2004) that is worthy of receiving crucial resources, especially investment capital. This means that the
process of becoming a successful DEMO organization consists of two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the nascent DEMO has to
compete for factors of production or the opportunity to actually produce something by ﬁnding adequate resources. In the second
stage, the new venture has to compete for end-users or consumers based on what is DEMO in the ﬁrst stage.
These two stages often can be neatly distinguished in highly innovative and uncertain industries such as the creative industries
(Caves, 2000). Particularly the ﬁlm industry is characterized by one-off project organizations that are set up to produce a single
product (Jones, 1996)DEMO Distinguishing between these two stages does not necessarily mean that the second stage always follows
the ﬁrst. There are examples of nascent ﬁrms that DEMO (conditional) commitments from customers to convince investors to provide
capital, DEMO even in those settings where the stages overlap, it can still DEMO sense to distinguish between the two competitive
processes, precisely to get DEMO better understanding of why and how, in these circumstances, customer commitments could be
considered start-up resources (Aldrich and Martinez, 2001; Reuber and Fisher, 2005). This paper will focus on the competition of
ﬁnding adequate resources to start production. We will do so by applying selection DEMO theory.
3.2. Selection system theory
Selection system theory (Wijnberg and Gemser, 2000; Wijnberg, 2004; Priem, 2007; Gemser et al., 2008) analyzes competitive
processes by focussing on the evaluations that attribute value to DEMO and producers. In each competitive arena there are the
competitors or selected and the individuals or ﬁrms whose evaluations of products and producers determine DEMO performance
differentials between the selected. These are referred to as selectors. Usually, the focus in selection system theory is on how
evaluations inﬂuence the behavior of customers in the ﬁnal product market. However, the theoretical framework can just as well
be applied to the situation in which (potential) producers compete for initial resources for setting up new ventures, and DEMO
external quality evaluations inﬂuence the behavior of resource-providers, such as investors.
DEMO system theory distinguishes between three ideal types of selection systems. Market selection is when the consumers
themselves are the selectors, peer selection is when other producers are the selectors, and expert selection is when evaluations by
third parties – who are neither producers nor consumers – are the DEMO factor in determining which producers are successful.
For example, everyday consumer DEMO such as detergents are usually market selected, academics compete in a DEMO selection
environment, and bidders at an art auction base their consumer DEMO largely upon the opinions of experts (e.g. is the painting
by DEMO or just “from his school”).
It is important to note that the term expert only denotes an individual's type of role in DEMO exchange process between the
consumer and the product or producer that is evaluated. It does not necessarily mean that someone has more knowledge than
DEMO about the evaluated product. In order to identify someone as an expert selector, it is necessary that this person is a selector.
This means that his or her opinions must have a real impact on customer DEMO, as well as the outcome of the competitive
process among producers. DEMO this person cannot at the same time be one of the producers or consumers involved in this
competitive process when the evaluation takes place.
DEMO example, if a former entrepreneur has become a full-time advisor of DEMO government agency awarding subsidies to software
entrepreneurs, this person is considered DEMO expert selector in respect to the competitive process in the software industry. Also, a
television celebrity can be identiﬁed as an expert selector in the competitive process concerning over-the-counter (OTC) drugs if
the opinions of DEMO celebrity cause large numbers of consumers to buy particular drugs. This person is even considered an expert if
his or her pharmaceutical knowledge of DEMO drugs is minimal or wrong.

375
There are three possible complications to this basic model of DEMO systems: actual selection systems can be a mix of the
above-mentioned DEMO, competitive processes can proceed in multiple stages with its own set DEMO selectors, and decision
makers who may look like selectors of one DEMO can actually be representing selectors of another type.
First, it should DEMO emphasized that the aforementioned selection systems are ideal types. Particular competitive processes can
be governed by a combination of selection systems in which selectors DEMO different types operate alongside each other. For instance,
Mol and Wijnberg (2007) argue that new musicians can become better-known by simultaneously beneﬁting DEMO becoming a
support act to an established artist (representing peer selection), as well as from being granted air time by radio DJs (DEMO
expert selection).
Second, it is possible that the complete selection DEMO consists of multiple stages. Since, there is competition for the
opportunity DEMO actually compete in the relevant market, new venture entrepreneurs must initially DEMO for ﬁnancial resources
from investors in the capital market before they can actually compete in (end-) consumer markets. The decision-makers in the
ﬁnancing DEMO (Ueda, 2004) may well be of a different type and DEMO different preferences than the decision-makers in the second
stage (i.e. where DEMO products enter the market). Using Hsu and Hannan's (2005) terminology, the audiences can be signiﬁcantly
different in the two stages. In that case, entrepreneurs may need to possess different types of reputations in each of the two stages
in order to favorably impress the selectors.
DEMO, the apparent selectors may be representing the real selectors. These apparent DEMO evaluate not on the basis of their
own preferences, but as DEMO of the preferences of others. Representation in this case is not meant in a formal sense,
rather it suggests that the competitive success DEMO the ‘representative’ selector derives from his or her ability to correctly guess or
predict the preferences of the party that the selector represents. This DEMO often occurs between subsequent stages in a value
system. If market selection dominates the competitive process in the ﬁnal stage, distributors and retailers – under the assumption
that they lack the market power or means to DEMO shape or inﬂuence consumer taste (Mol et al., 2005) – DEMO products to
match the preferences of their consumers and not their own. For example, a furniture retailer buys furniture with the expectation
that customers, in turn, will buy the furniture. However, if the furniture retailer's guess of actual consumer preferences is wrong,
revenues will be DEMO to competitors.
One can consider these two complications in combination by applying them to the decision making process of ﬁnancial capital
providers. If a DEMO, for example, values a client's creditworthiness based on expert rating agencies, then decision making in this
stage is dominated by expert selection. However, if a bank is more impressed by a product's potential, and therefore bases their
investment decision on a guess of how well consumers will respond, then this stage is represented by market selection, DEMO
though the bank is typically not a market selector for that particular product.
3.3. Reputation and selection
Many studies show that reputations of individuals DEMO/or organizations are quality signals (Podolny, 1993) that serve to
DEMO stakeholders and are valuable in acquiring resources (Stuart et al., 1999; Certo, 2003; Higgins and Gulati, 2006). Signals
that can DEMO used as proxies of missing information are important determinants of the outcome of competitive processes (Shapiro,
1983; Podolny, 1993; Rindova et DEMO, 2005). For producers, reputational signals based on past performance (DEMO and Shanley,
1990; Rindova et al., 2007) are of DEMO importance because they can inﬂuence the behavior of audiences (Hsu and DEMO, 2005).
The importance and value of reputations increase when competitive DEMO take place under conditions of high uncertainty and
imperfect information (Shapiro, 1983).
New ventures, especially if they are still in the process of being founded, will not have reputations at the ﬁrm level. Since
investors are often approached for capital by the founding members of the DEMO organization, this implies that the individual
reputation of founding members can DEMO as a quality signal. Earlier studies show that the reputations of core organizational
members, such as CEOs (D'Aveni, 1990), top management teams (Cohen and Dean, 2005; Higgins and Gulati, 2006), DEMO board
members (Certo, 2003; Musteen et al., 2010) or DEMO afﬁliates (Pollock et al., 2010) have an impact on a DEMO's ability to
attract investment capital, particularly with respect to start-up DEMO of new ventures (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Gorman and
Sahlman, 1989; Muzyka et al., 1996; Franke et al., 2006, 2008).
A performance-based reputation is a multidimensional construct (Fombrun and Shanley, DEMO; Rhee and Valdez, 2009) that
besides past market success can DEMO based on many signals from many different sources. These signals include contests (Rao, 1994),
awards (Anand and Watson, 2004; Gemser DEMO al., 2008) reviews (Basuroy et al., 2003; Eliashberg and DEMO, 1997), ratings
(Podolny, 1993), and even the mere DEMO of media attention (Pollock and Rindova, 2003; Rindova et al., 2007).
Reuber and Fisher (2005) propose that, depending on the complexity of the purchase process and the extent to which the
product DEMO customized, the importance of reputational signals could be more or less DEMO to certain domains of endorsement
which are more or less relevant to speciﬁc audiences or stakeholders (Fisher and Reuber, 2007). Pollock et DEMO (2010) look at the
differential effects of various sources of reputations when they distinguish between different types of prestigious afﬁliates of a new
DEMO as well as the additive value of each afﬁliation in attaining investment capital. Selection system theory allows us to
combine, extend and further operationalize the arguments of Reuber and Fisher's (2005), Fisher and Reuber (2007) and Pollock
et al. (2010), because it suggests that the relative importance of each type of reputational signal depends on the DEMO
environment and its concomitant selection system – market, peer or expert DEMO in which the selected ﬁrms or individuals operate.
The selectors whose decisions determine which nascent ventures will be successful in the competition for start-up DEMO are
the decision makers in the organization that provide investment capital. Franke et al. (2006) studied the rating behavior of venture
capitalists with DEMO to the business proposals that they accept. They ﬁnd that VCs prefer start-up teams whose members have
376 J.J. Ebbers, N.M. Wijnberg / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (DEMO) 372–384
similar professional backgrounds in terms of having work experience in DEMO small or large ﬁrms and similar background in
professional training. This tendency of investors to favor ventures with management teams that are similar to DEMO in the
above-mentioned respects, suggests that investors might also favor ventures DEMO members score highest along the reputational
dimensions that are most important to the selectors themselves.
To test this suggestion, the ﬁrst step is to identify to which type of selectors the decision makers belong to. In DEMO where
the decision makers are – or represent – market selectors, DEMO in the eyes of consumers will count heavily. Such a market
reputation could be derived from a number of possible market-reputational signals, such as opinions on consumer forums or previous
sales to consumers. In environments dominated DEMO expert selectors, past performance, as perceived and rated by experts, DEMO
constitute the most signiﬁcant part of a reputation. In environments where peer selectors dominate, peer-reputational signals should
play a decisive role. In academia, DEMO example, peer-reputational signals, such as a citation index score, can DEMO investment decisions
such as hiring new faculty. We would expect that a reputation of a particular type – market, expert and peer – will be more important if
the decision makers can be identiﬁed as belonging DEMO a type of selector that matches the type of reputation.
Hypothesis 1a. The market reputation, compared to the other types of reputation, of DEMO founding team member of an
entrepreneurial venture, has the strongest effect DEMO obtaining investment capital if the investors are market selectors.
Hypothesis 1b. The expert reputation, compared to the other types of reputation, of a DEMO team member of an
entrepreneurial venture, has the strongest effect on DEMO investment capital if the investors are expert selectors.
Hypothesis 1c. The peer reputation, compared to the other types of reputation, of a founding DEMO member of an entrepreneurial
venture, has the strongest effect on obtaining DEMO capital if the investors are peer selectors.
In the next section we present an empirical study in which selectors of different types are confronted DEMO reputational signals
of different types.
4. Data and method
4.1. Research setting and data
The empirical setting of our analysis is the Dutch ﬁlm DEMO Our focus is on the roles of ﬁlm producers and ﬁlm directors,
whose track records or reputations are important in the search for DEMO capital. The ﬁlm industry is characterized by
project-based organizations (PBOs). DEMO PBO is a temporary organization that is disbanded once the task for which it was speciﬁcally
set up is completed (Jones, 1996). DEMO ﬁlm industry is characterized by high sunk cost and high demand uncertainty (Caves, 2000).
Performance-based reputations are relatively valuable in such uncertain DEMO because they seem to offer at least an
indication of the likelihood of future success.
In our analysis Dutch ﬁlms are operationalized as ﬁlms DEMO a theatrical release by producers and directors that have a Dutch
nationality or who have attended the Dutch Film Academy, the main ﬁlm school in the Netherlands. This resulted in 271 ﬁlms that
were released in DEMO ﬁlm theaters between 1992 and 2009. The 76 ﬁlms released between 1992 and 1998 are used for constructing
independent – market, peer and expert – reputation variables. The remaining 195 ﬁlms released between 1998 and 2009 DEMO used for
analyzing actual investment behavior for each type of investor. Investment data were collected at the Dutch Film Fund, a government
agency that is responsible for implementing the policy of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to stimulate the production of
Dutch ﬁlms. The Film Fund DEMO in 161 of the ﬁlms released between 1998 and 2009, and DEMO a record of the investments of the
other main investors in these ﬁlms. These are the public television broadcasters and the ﬁlm distributors. After DEMO the 20 cases for
which the investment of the broadcaster or distributor was missing, our ﬁnal sample amounts to 141 ﬁlms.
4.2. Dependent variables
Our study analyzes the effect of performance-based reputations of founding members – DEMO and directors – of new ﬁlm projects
on investors. In the Netherlands there are three crucial ﬁlm investors that each have the opportunity to DEMO as an investor. Each one
can be identiﬁed as (mainly) representing one of the three types of selectors: market selectors, expert selectors DEMO peer selectors.
First, ﬁlm distributors are predominantly interested in the future DEMO performance of the ﬁlms for which they provide
capital. They will attempt to guess the taste of the ﬁnal consumers that buy tickets at DEMO box-ofﬁce (Eliashberg et al., 2008). They
can therefore be considered to represent market selectors.
Second, state supported public television broadcasters invest in ﬁlms on the basis of the decisions of experts – see below DEMO
further details – and investment from this source can, as a DEMO, be considered to be governed by expert selection.
Third, the Dutch Film Fund is a public institution that aims to promote the quantity, quality and diversity of Dutch ﬁlms. The
decision of the Film Fund DEMO invest in certain ﬁlms is based on the advice of an advisory committee in which peers – in other words,
other ﬁlmmakers – DEMO This selection environment can therefore be described as peer selection.
4.2.1. Distributor investment (market selection)
The distributor investment is the absolute size of the minimum guarantee (MG) of a ﬁlm distributor. Distributors invest in DEMO
productions by providing so-called minimum guarantees (MG) in exchange for the distribution rights. The MG is an upfront

compensation for expected future earnings that producers can directly invest in the production of a DEMO The investment decision of a
distributor is driven by their evaluation of a ﬁlm project's future earnings in the market. Distributors can therefore DEMO considered to act
as representatives of market selectors, even if they DEMO might not want to view any of the ﬁlms they distribute.
4.2.2. Broadcaster investment (expert selection)
The broadcaster investment is the absolute size of the public television broadcaster's investment. The broadcaster's investment
decision DEMO be classiﬁed as performed by agents that in the framework of selection system theory can be identiﬁed as experts.
Public broadcasters are largely ﬁnanced DEMO the state, and in return have to abide by strict content DEMO that control the quality and
share of national cultural productions. The investment decision is based on the evaluation of the potential merits of a DEMO project
by drama experts and executives within the broadcasting organization itself and in the closely related CoBO and Stifo funds (for
more details see Appendix A).
4.2.3. Film Fund investment (peer selection)
The Film Fund investment is the absolute size of the Film Fund subsidy. The DEMO mission of the Film Fund is to stimulate Dutch ﬁlm
production, DEMO both quality and diversity, and creating a favorable climate for Dutch DEMO culture (Nederlands Fonds voor de
Film, 2009a). In selecting projects the Film Fund draws on an external advisory committee that is largely DEMO of professionals from
the Dutch ﬁlm industry that can be considered to be peers (other ﬁlmmakers) of the applicants. This committee assists the DEMO Fund by
giving advice on which projects the Film Fund should support. Next, the Film Fund administrators decide on the basis of the advice of this
committee. Investment decisions, in other words, are predominantly based DEMO peer selection, although the committee also includes other
types of selectors. DEMO 1 shows that a majority of advisory committee members are peer selectors. The committee, however, also includes
afew ﬁlm distributors and ﬁlm theater DEMO (who can be classiﬁed as market selectors) and a few expert selectors.
4.3. Independent variables
In order to measure the effect of reputations DEMO the investment stage we operationalized reputation as the average performance
of an actor's previous three ﬁlms. Our data on individual ﬁlm characteristics are DEMO related to the release year. There is, however, on
average a two year time lag between the capital investment decision and the eventual DEMO of a ﬁlm in the theaters. In the
meantime a ﬁlm is produced, marketed and distributed. For example, for a ﬁlm released in DEMO the investment decision is likely to
be made in 2002. We therefore coded the reputation at the time of the investment decision of a DEMO released in 2004 as the average
performance of the last three ﬁlms made before 2002. In the cases where producers or directors have made DEMO or more ﬁlms in
the same year, we coded the average DEMO of those ﬁlms.
In addition, producers and directors making their ﬁrst DEMO do not have a track record. This means that they either do not have a
reputation or – and more likely – they have DEMO reputation that we are incapable of measuring. Someone, for example, may have had
a career in neighboring industries such as television or theater DEMO he or she made the switch to ﬁlm. Others may have just
started their careers after graduating from the Film Academy, but the short ﬁlms they have made for their ﬁnal exam may already
be known DEMO investors. This makes it unlikely that these new entrants should be considered as having no reputation. We therefore
coded new entrants in the ﬁlm DEMO as having an average reputation for each type: market, expert and peer.
4.3.1. Market reputation
Box ofﬁce success is an often used construct DEMO measuring market performance of ﬁlms (see for example Sorenson and
Waguespack, 2006; Delmestri et al., 2005). For each ﬁlm we used DEMO cumulative box ofﬁce revenues in terms of ticket sales over
all consecutive years that each ﬁ lm ran in the theaters. The market reputation DEMO producers and directors is the average box-ofﬁce
performance of his or her last three ﬁlms before the investment decision. Box ofﬁce data of ﬁlms DEMO in the time period 1992–
2009 were obtained through the Dutch Film Distributors Association.2

4.3.2. Expert reputation
The expert reputation of producers and directors DEMO based on the average ﬁ lm critics' reviews of their last DEMO ﬁlms at the time
of the investment decision of the focal ﬁlm. Critics' reviews have been used in earlier studies of the ﬁlm industry as a construct to
measure artistic merit of individual ﬁlms (Eliashberg and Shugan, 1997; Basuroy et al., 2003; Ebbers and Wijnberg, 2010). Critics'
reviews are measured by the number of stars on DEMO scale from 0 to 5. The more stars, the more positive DEMO critic's review. We used
the average of all the star rated ﬁlm reviews in the four largest national newspapers – Algemeen Dagblad, Volkskrant, NRC
Handelsblad and Telegraaf – to rate the expert performance of individual ﬁlms, and in turn, expert reputations. The review data in
these DEMO are collected by and published in the Filmkrant, a Dutch magazine DEMO to ﬁlm.
4.3.3. Peer reputation
Peer reputation is derived from the average number of awards a producer or director has won at the Dutch DEMO Festival for his
or her last three ﬁlms prior to the current ﬁlm for which investment is needed. Winning – or being nominated for DEMO awards is
considered to be an important quality signal contributing to reputation (Anand and Watson, 2004), the effects of which on
performance DEMO the ﬁlm industry have been studied before (Gemser et al., 2008). The Dutch Film Festival is the most important ﬁlm
festival in DEMO Netherlands, and awards that are won at this festival are considered DEMO contribute to peer reputation since the
members of the jury are fellow ﬁlmmakers. Peer reputation of producers is derived from the award category ‘Best DEMO, and peer
reputation of directors from the category ‘Best Director’.
4.4. DEMO variables
First, the budget of a ﬁ lm is expected to DEMO an important predictor of the size of the investment of the Film Fund, the broadcaster
and the ﬁlm distributor. The higher the budget, DEMO more investment capital is needed to produce the ﬁlm. Budget data were
provided by the Film Fund.
Second, the experience of ﬁ lm professionals, in our case producers and directors, could be an important predictor DEMO the size of
the investment. Experience is measured as the number of years since an individual made his or her debut in the industry. DEMO
experience is measured in relation to the particular role they perform in the ﬁ lm for which they search investment capital. Film
professionals that DEMO been active for many years are more entrenched in industry networks, DEMO can increase their legitimacy
(Cattani et al., 2008), while inexperienced professionals suffer from a liability of newness (Freeman et al., 1983)DEMO For Film Academy
graduates, experience is measured as the number of DEMO since graduation. For those individuals that did not graduate from the
Film Academy we took the year of their ﬁrst ﬁlm credit on IMDb DEMO their debut year.
Third, we included two variables to control for DEMO budget of the previous ﬁlm project of producers and directors. Large budget
ﬁlm projects are more prestigious, and at the same time may also be an indication of experience. The latter might give investors a
lower DEMO of risk and more conﬁdence in the chance of success of the focal project.
Finally, we included a genre dummy for comedy ﬁlms. The comedy dummy includes (romantic) comedies and romantic ﬁlms.
Comedies are a DEMO genre to export to foreign markets since they are often very culture speciﬁc(Friedman, 2004). Dutch ﬁlm
investors could therefore be expected to ﬁll this gap in the Dutch ﬁlm market.
5. Results
5.1. Seemingly DEMO regression
We conducted a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analysis to test our hypotheses. SUR allows us to estimate a similar
speciﬁcation for each DEMO of investor in a single procedure. In other words, instead of DEMO three separate models for market,
peer and expert selection, we DEMO one single SUR regression including all three types of selectors or investments. By
estimating the speciﬁcations jointly in SUR – instead of estimating the DEMO on an equation-by-equation basis – one gains
efﬁciency since the error terms across the equations are expected to be correlated (Zellner, 1962). DEMO interpreting the results
we checked for multicollinearity. There were no multicollinearity problems since we found no signiﬁcant variance inﬂation factor
(VIF) values (Mean VIF=1.41 and largest VIF=1.68).
Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics and DEMO With respect to the dependent variables, it should be noted that DEMO
average distributor investment – market selection – is € 143.612. The average amount of a television broadcaster's investment –
expert selection – is DEMO 577.637. Finally, the average Film Fund investment – peer selection – DEMO €505.186. This shows that in absolute
investment share the television broadcaster is the most important investor of the three, followed by the Film Fund and the ﬁlm
distributor.
Table 3 shows that the residuals of the DEMO of three dependent variables are indeed signiﬁcantly correlated (pb 0.05).
DEMO supports our choice for applying SUR. Table 4 shows the results of the SUR analysis estimating the investment size of three
types of investors DEMO selectors.
First, model 1 (R2 =.55, pb 0.001) tests Hypothesis 1a stating that a market (compared to peer or expert) reputation DEMO the
strongest positive effect on the investment size of a distributor or market selector. With respect to the control variables, we see that
a ﬁlm project's budget and the fact that it is a comedy DEMO have a positive and signiﬁcant effect on the willingness of the
distributor to invest. We ﬁnd partial support for Hypothesis 1a since there is DEMO positive effect when the type of reputation matches
the type of selector, but only with respect to the market reputation of the producer (DEMO =.25, pb 0.01), not the director. It is

interesting to note that the distributor, as market selector, does not DEMO to take into account any of the reputation signals of the
director. There is no signiﬁcant effect of either market reputation (past box-ofﬁ ce success), expert reputation (past reviews) or
peer reputation (past awards) with respect to the director. More importantly, the non-matching peer reputation DEMO a producer
actually has a negative and signiﬁcant effect (β=−.13, pb 0.05) on the investment size of the distributor/market selector.
Second, DEMO 2 (R2 =.45, pb 0.001) tests Hypothesis 1b that there DEMO a strongest positive relation between expert (compared to
market or peer) reputation and the investment size of the broadcaster that can be classiﬁed DEMO expert selector. With respect to the
control variables we see that only the size of the budget has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on DEMO size of the broadcaster
investment. Most importantly, however, we ﬁnd partial support for Hypothesis 1b since there is a positive effect when the DEMO of
reputation matches the type of selector (expert) with respect to the expert reputation of the director (β =.20, pb 0.05). DEMO
addition, it is interesting to note that broadcasters or expert selectors DEMO seem to take into account another non-matching type of
reputation of the director since there actually is a weakly signiﬁcant negative effect of a DEMO's market reputation (β=−.16,
pb 0.1).
Third, model 3 (R2 =.36, pb 0.001) tests Hypothesis 1c that there is a strongest positive relation between peer (not market or
expert) reputation and DEMO investment size of the Film Fund that predominantly constitutes a peer selector. With respect to the
control variables we see that the controls for DEMO current ﬁlm's budget and the size of the budget of a director's previous ﬁlm have a
positive and signiﬁcant effect on the DEMO of the investment. We do not, however, ﬁnd support for Hypothesis 1c. In other words,
we ﬁnd no positive effect on the DEMO of the investment of the Film Fund, when the type of DEMO matches the type of selector
(peer). This applies to both DEMO peer reputation of the director and the peer reputation of the producer. In addition, none of the
non-matching types of reputation of neither the producer nor the director have an effect on the willingness of the DEMO selector/
Film Fund to invest in their projects.
5.2. Robustness checks and alternative model
We performed a number of robustness checks. First, we ran three separate ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for market,
DEMO and peer selection, to compare the coefﬁcients of these three models DEMO our SUR regression. We found the coefﬁcients to
be exactly the same while the signiﬁcance scores of the OLS regression were lower. This is DEMO we expected since SUR produces
more efﬁcient coefﬁ cients by taking into account the correlation in the error terms of the three separate models (Zellner, 1962).

Second, we ran a SUR regression where, instead of DEMO absolute investment size, we used the relative size of the investment.
DEMO was done by dividing the absolute investment of each particular type by the absolute budget of the ﬁlm. This led to three
dependent variables DEMO relative investment size for all three types of investors. With respect to the main variables, the results only
affected our ﬁndings related to Hypothesis 1b or expert selection and reputation. While the expert reputation of the DEMO
became slightly less signiﬁcant (p=0.051, instead of pb 0.05), the expert reputation of the producer became weakly signiﬁcant as
well (pb 0.1). This provides additional support for Hypothesis 1b. All other types of DEMO that did not match the type of
selector – market and peer – were not signiﬁcant.
Third, we ran the analysis after recoding new entrants in the ﬁlm industry with a different reputation score. Instead of DEMO
them with an average reputation, we coded them as 0.5 times DEMO average reputation, to take the possibility into account that new
entrants' reputations are systematically below average. This slightly affected the main ﬁndings related DEMO Hypothesis 1b
concerning expert selection. While the sign and signiﬁcance of the expert reputation of directors remained to same, the effect of
expert reputation of the producer also became signiﬁcant (pb 0.01). In other words, this model provided full support for
Hypothesis 1b. Of the non-matching types of reputations the only change we found was a positive and signiﬁcant DEMO for expert
reputation of the director (pb 0.05) in relation to peer selection by the Film Fund.
Fourth, we ran a SUR regression with the reputations of producers and directors based solely on the success DEMO their previous
single ﬁlm instead of the last three ﬁlms in our main model. The results linked to our hypotheses were only slightly different DEMO
respect to market selection or the investment by the distributor (model DEMO), where the positive effect of market reputation of the
producer became less signiﬁcant (from pb 0.05 to pb 0.1). We also found a number of interesting effects for non-matching types of
reputation. First, with respect to market selection we found that the negative effect of peer DEMO of the producer became
insigniﬁcant, and instead found a positive signiﬁcant DEMO (pb 0.01) of the peer reputation of the director. Second, DEMO respect to
expert selection (model 2), we found that the DEMO reputation of the producer turned positive and signiﬁcant (pb 0.01). DEMO,
in comparison with peer selection (model 3) we found a positive and weakly signiﬁcant effect for the expert reputation of the
director (pb 0.1).
Fifth, we included interaction effects between different types of reputations (market, peer and expert) to see how scoring well
on more than one type of reputation simultaneously inﬂuences investor behavior. We indeed DEMO a few signiﬁcant interactions
but these did not affect the results linked to our main hypotheses.
Finally, we ran the same analysis with only those cases in which all three investors participated (n=96). This did not affect our
results with respect to the matching type of reputations DEMO selectors. It did weaken the signiﬁcance levels (still all p levelsb DEMO),
but that is likely to be related to the lower DEMO of this regression.
6. Discussion
In our empirical case we studied the value of market, expert and peer reputation of directors and producers, DEMO obtaining
investment capital for ﬁlm projects from three main investors. These three investors, the ﬁlm distributor, television broadcaster,
and the Film Fund, can be described as belonging (mainly) to one of the types DEMO selection system theory distinguishes, namely:
market, expert and peer. We argued that the positive effect between reputations and the size of the DEMO in a new venture
would be the strongest when the type of reputation matches the type of selector and tested three hypotheses, one for each type of
reputation.
The results supported the three hypotheses to a DEMO different extent. The ﬁrst hypothesis (Hypothesis 1a) about the effect
of market reputation was partially conﬁrmed. More speciﬁcally, we found clear conﬁrmation of what the theory led us to expect
concerning the effect of the DEMO reputation of producers on the behavior of distributors (market selectors). DEMO also found that
the peer reputation of the producer had a weakly signiﬁ cant negative effect. In combination with the negative effect of market
DEMO of the producer in obtaining investment capital from broadcasters, this suggests DEMO the match between the type of
reputation and the type of selector is not only important in a positive sense but also in a DEMO sense. This is especially visible
when the type of reputation does not match with the type of selector and actually decreases the appreciation by DEMO selector.
Concerning the reputation of the director however, we found no DEMO signiﬁ cant effect regardless of type. This may indicate
that distributors leave the judgment about the qualities of the director to the producer. As DEMO as a producer has a positive track
record of picking new ﬁlm projects that sell enough tickets at the box-ofﬁce, the distributor trusts that this producer will
collaborate with those directors that help her/him to DEMO similar results in the future.
The hypothesis about expert reputation (Hypothesis DEMO) was also partially conﬁ rmed by the data. We found that DEMO expert
reputation of a director signiﬁcantly helps the new venture in which they are involved to obtain investment from public television
broadcasters (expert selectors). Contrary to what we expected, we did not ﬁnd a positive effect for the expert reputation of
producers. A possible explanation could be DEMO to the different roles and concomitant responsibilities of directors versus
producers (DEMO and Faulkner, 1991). In the ﬁlm industry the director is DEMO responsible for the artistic aspects of the
ﬁlm and since expert evaluations mainly focus on these aspects, it is possible that the expert reputation of a producer is given less
weight by the expert selectors. This DEMO in line with what we found regarding the market reputation of a producer in Hypothesis 1a,
since the producer's role and responsibilities DEMO mostly related to the commercial aspects of the ﬁlm project.
The third hypothesis (Hypothesis 1c) is the only one that was not supported DEMO our results. Peer reputation does not seem to
increase the size of the subsidies received from the Film Fund, where decisions are predominantly based on advisory committees
consisting of peers. In addition, none of the non-matching types of reputations had a signiﬁcant effect on the investment by the
DEMO Fund. This can be explained by the fact that while we identiﬁed the Film Fund as a peer selector, there are also representatives
382
J.J. Ebbers, N.M. Wijnberg / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (DEMO) 372–384
of other selection systems (market and expert) among the DEMO makers and this might have diluted the effects of the particular
types of reputations.
A ﬁ rst possible explanation for the inconclusive results concerning DEMO effects of peer reputation on the Film Fund investment
could be that market and expert selectors, although a minority in the Film Fund's advisory committee, play a greater role than their
numbers would suggest. In addition, it is uncertain to what extent the Film Fund's administrators, who might also be characterized
as expert selectors, inﬂuence the selection DEMO ﬁlm projects during the advisory process. An alternative explanation could be that
the actual peers who are members of the advisory committee usually are DEMO from the ranks of successful ﬁlmmakers. As we
have seen above, DEMO the three investors studied, the expert-selecting broadcasters are the most important DEMO terms of ﬁlm
investment share. This could have led to a ﬁltering dynamic in the ﬁlm industry towards ﬁlmmakers with high expert reputations
who, although being peers, also attach a relatively high value to expert reputation.
Another possible explanation could be that the Film Fund, apart from its' other aims, would like to legitimize its' existence by
subsidizing projects that without support would not have been produced. Directors and producers who DEMO already won the
highest Dutch ﬁlmmakers award – and thus score high on peer reputation as it is measured in this study – could DEMO assumed to
have less trouble getting new projects ﬁ nanced through other sources, and therefore the Film Fund might be less willing to
subsidize them. In this way, the positive effects of a high peer reputation would be at least partially canceled out, leading to the
inconclusive results that we have found.
7. Conclusion
The core objective of this paper DEMO to differentiate between different types of performance-based reputations and study the
extent to which these different types of reputations have an impact on the DEMO making processes of different types of
investors towards new ventures that are still in the process of being set up. The importance of corporate DEMO in attracting
investment capital has been ﬁrmly established (Stuart et al., 1999; Certo, 2003). In addition, the reputation of key individuals or
core members afﬁ liated with an organization has been found to DEMO a similar role (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Gorman and
Sahlman, 1989; Muzyka et al., 1996; Cohen and Dean, 2005; Franke et al., 2006, 2008; Beckman et al., 2007; Pollock et al., 2010).
Our study builds on Reuber and Fisher (2005) who argued that reputation often is domain-speciﬁc and Pollock et al. (2010)
who found a distinction between the signaling effects towards investors of DEMO types of prestigious afﬁliates of new ventures.
We especially extend Franke et al. (2006) who focus on the similarity between investors and the DEMO members of new ventures.
We used the framework of selection system theory (Wijnberg and Gemser, 2000; Wijnberg, 2004; Priem, 2007; Gemser et al.,
2008) which suggested the general argument of this paper that particular types of reputations matching the evaluation criteria
and preferences of DEMO types of selectors, will prove to be more valuable to the DEMO In this context we understand the
concept of value similarly to how Barney understands the value of a resource as far as it serves DEMO “exploit opportunities or
neutralize threats in a ﬁrm's environment” (Barney, 1991: p. 106).
Selection system theory also served to distinguish and categorize the types of reputations and the types of investors. This way
DEMO could test a number of speciﬁc hypotheses about the value of different types of reputations in the competition for investment
capital from different types DEMO investors.
First of all, we distinguish between different types of reputations DEMO founding members of new ventures and different types of
investors. Second, DEMO show that the ability to raise investment capital by these founding members is affected by the match
between their reputation types – market, expert and peer reputations – and the types of investor – market, expert and peer
selectors. We found the strongest positive effect between the market (as opposed to peer or expert) reputation of founding
members of new ventures and the size of the investment they receive from market selectors. DEMO addition, we found a similar
relationship between expert reputation and investors, characterized as expert selectors. In some cases, reputation types that did
not match the type of investor actually had a negative effect on investors' willingness to provide capital to the nascent venture.
Our study has a DEMO of limitations pointing the way forward towards areas for future research. Our empirical study relied
on data collected by the Film Fund. We could DEMO only study the behavior of the investors included in this data set and not
other sources of investment, such as investments in projects by the ﬁlm makers themselves and/or other private investors.
Explaining investments from DEMO sources would be a useful extension of our project, although collecting DEMO requisite data is
difﬁ cult. We also did not include other variables that could explain the behavior of investors, such as the quality of the script and
star presence of actors and actresses. The former is DEMO to measure and we did not have any information about stars having been
contracted at the time the investment decisions were made.
Second, we studied the Dutch ﬁ lm industry over a limited time period. Comparison DEMO using data from other industries
and/or in other countries would be of evident interest, to provide further tests of the arguments advanced in this paper as well as of
the usefulness of selection system theory DEMO an explanatory framework. An especially interesting industry to further test our
theory could be biotech. The biotech industry, similar to the ﬁ lm industry, is also very risky because of high sunk costs in new
product development, a strong reliance on outside (venture) capital, difﬁcult to DEMO consumer demands, and a strong reliance
of investors on top management DEMO a signal of the new venture's potential (Higgins and Gulati, 2006).
Third, this paper focused on one stage of the competitive process among new ventures — the competition for investment
capital. It is DEMO that if a nascent organization does not survive this phase it will not be able to compete in the second phase of the
product DEMO However, another possible next step could be to study both stages DEMO In the second stage a study on
the effects of the same types of performance-based reputations on success in the product market could be DEMO This would
J.J. Ebbers, N.M. Wijnberg / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (2012) 372–384
383
enable to study the extent to which the investment decisions DEMO different types of investors are good predictors of eventual success
in the product market (Baum and Silverman, 2004).
Fourth, it would be interesting to focus more on interactions or the extent to which non-matching DEMO signals increase
or decrease the effect of the reputations of the matching types. In addition, these interactions would also be interesting with
respect to different type investors since Steier and Greenwood (1995) found that investment DEMO are dependent on the prior
investment decisions of other investors in the new venture. Unfortunately, we did not have information about the temporal
sequence of the investment decisions by the different types of investors in our DEMO setting. Future studies could further build
on these ﬁndings by studying when, and in what order, the investment decision by one particular type DEMO investor – market, expert
or peer – is dependent on the DEMO investment decision of the other types of investors in the same new venture.
The general argument of this paper has clear practical consequences for DEMO management of nascent ventures. If a particular
type of reputation of a particular founding member determines the willingness of investors of a matching type DEMO provide
investment capital to the new venture, then this can help DEMO to make more optimal decisions. These can include for
example, decisions DEMO their own investments in building particular types of reputations, or about DEMO costs and beneﬁts of
enlarging the founding team with members who can contribute reputations that make the new venture more attractive to
particular investors.

Appendix A
The average direct share of public broadcasters is only 5% of a ﬁlm'DEMO budget. However, they have a gatekeeper role in providing
ﬁlmmakers access DEMO the CoBO and Stifo funds that on average invest another 22% of the total budget and access to these funds
depends on or automatically DEMO broadcasters' investment. First, the CoBO3 fund divides revenues received from cable
companies in Germany and Belgium that carry Dutch television content, among Dutch broadcasting organizations. The CoBO fund
does not make an independent value judgment DEMO projects but automatically participates when a Dutch public broadcaster
endorses a ﬁlm project in which it participates as a co-producer with an independent ﬁlm DEMO company (Stichting Co-
productiefonds Binnenlandse Omroep, 2009). Second, the DEMO is a government agency that distributes part of the advertising
income earned on public broadcasting channels. Their objective is to stimulate the production of DEMO high quality
audiovisual content by providing project subsidies exclusively to Dutch public broadcasters. The Stifo fund has an advisory
committee of experts from the DEMO sector that aid in selecting projects that will receive subsidies (Stimuleringfonds
DEMO Culturele Omroepproducties, 2009). In this study the variable broadcaster participation DEMO includes the
additional capital from the CoBO and Stifo funds, which DEMO average amounts to 27% of the total budget.
