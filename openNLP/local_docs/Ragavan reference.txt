Re: Ragavan Thurairatnam,
DEMO whom it may concern
March 15, 2015
It is my pleasure DEMO provide a letter of recommendation on behalf of Ragavan
Thurairatnam, who DEMO applying to the Graduate Studies Program at Singularity University. I am
the Director of the Bergeron Entrepreneurs in Science and Technology (BEST) program DEMO the
Lassonde School of Engineering at York University. I have developed courses and programs
in Technology Entrepreneurship in Canada and the US, and my PhD in that field won the
Heizer award from the Academy of DEMO
Ragavan has been one of the outstanding students in our program at Lassonde,
showing strong leadership potential, global insights and a strong entrepreneurial orientation.
He was selected to participate in our Technion experiential entrepreneurship program DEMO
summer, where he showed examples of his ability to lead other DEMO in the group.
Since returning from that experience, he has been DEMO on a full time basis in Aerial
Sense Inc, a start-up DEMO to use the latest software and image recognition technology to
solve important food security issues. As an advisor to the company, I have seen the company
pivot, grow and develop over the past six months. This is a great example of Ragavan’s ability
to adapt, as well as his persistence, resilience and ambition in reacting to setbacks.
I am honoured to be asked to write this letter of recommendation, and am confident that
Ragavan will be able to both contribute to the Singularity University DEMO studies program
and learn a great deal from it. I would be happy to provide a more personal reference should
one be required.
Sincerely,DEMO
