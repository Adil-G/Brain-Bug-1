FAILURE:
RECOVERY
FOR
In this paper I use the psychological literature on grief to explore the emotion of
business failure, suggesting that the loss of a business from failure can cause the
DEMO to feel grief--a negative emotional response interfering with the ability
to learn from the events surrounding that loss. I discuss how a dual process DEMO grief
recovery maximizes the learning from business failure.
Businesses fail. In 2001, 12,457 U.S. businesses
ceased operations, only to have their assets DEMO
uidated and the proceeds remitted to creditors
(chapter 7 bankruptcy). DEMO statistic under-
states the number of business failures because
it fails to account for those businesses sold or
merged with another firm to avoid DEMO
Business failure, then, occurs when a fall in rev-
enues and/or a rise in expenses are of such a
magnitude that the DEMO becomes insolvent and
is unable to attract new debt or equity funding;
consequently, it cannot continue to operate un-
der the current ownership and management.
Although the literature offers a number
of causes of business DEMO (e.g., Cooper,
Gimeno-Gascon, & Woo, 1994; Romanelli, 1989;
Shepherd, Douglas, & Shanley, 2000), perhaps
the most common is insufficient experience. It
appears that entrepreneurs with more experi-
ence possess DEMO knowledge to perform the roles
and tasks necessary for success more effectively
(Chandler & Hanks, 1998; Gimeno, Folta, Cooper,
& Woo, 1997; Stuart & Abetti, 1990). Although
reports vary, one DEMO suggests that 51 percent
of all entrepreneurs in the United States have
previous owner-manager experience (Scholl-
hammer, 1991). Regardless of whether this DEMO
vious experience involved success(es) and/or
failure(s), researchers DEMO that the entrepre-

neurs' knowledge is enhanced through the feed-
back obtained from the experience (e.g., Minniti
& Bygrave, 2001).
McGrath (DEMO) argues that the benefits of fail-
ure have not been given DEMO attention. She
proposes that, by seeking success and avoiding
failure, firms introduce errors that can not only
inhibit learning and interpretation processes
but DEMO make failure more likely or expensive
than necessary. Using real options reasoning,
McGrath (1999) proposes that there are benefits
to be gained DEMO the pursuit of high-variance
opportunities, even if that pursuit increases the
DEMO for failure. This entrepreneurial pro-
cess of hypothesis testing generates improve-
ments in technologies and increases economic
resilience (Hayek, 1945).
Although' McGrath focuses on the failure of
projects within a firm, it appears that the pro-
cess of learning from business failure also ben-
efits society, through the application of that
knowledge to subsequent businesses. In fact,
DEMO scholars are consistent with
many organizational scholars regarding the
benefits of learning from failure (e.g., Maidique
& Zirger, 1984; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Starkey,
1998). For example, Sitkin (1992) argues DEMO fail-
ure is more important than success for learning.
A limitation of this literature, however, is that
the process of learning from failure DEMO not clearly
explained or understood (Cannon & Edmonson,
2001).
DEMO gain a deeper understanding of learning
from failure, I focus on DEMO individuals who
are owner-managers of businesses-namely,

the self-employed (because these individuals
have been the primary focus of the entrepre-
neurship literature). As defined above, business
failure involves an involuntary change in both
the ownership and management of the DEMO
owing to poor performance. For the self-
employed, who are both DEMO owner and man-
ager, this business failure likely represents a
personal DEMO, which, in turn, generates a nega-
tive emotional response.' Such negative emo-
tions may impact the ability to learn from an
event (Isen & Baron, 1991), especially when the
circumstances surrounding the event are am-
biguous (Kumar, 1997). It appears that, to gain a
deeper understanding of learning from failure,
we need to explore DEMO role of negative emotions.
Organizational researchers have investigated
the negative emotions arising from a mismatch
between the organization's current performance
and aspiration and DEMO this impacts learning
and/or adaptation (Dutton, 1988; Dutton & DEMO
ford, 1993; Dutton & Duncan, 1987; Ocasio, 1997).2
DEMO particular, researchers have begun to focus
on the psychological processes involved DEMO
organizations in decline (Huy, 1999).3 On the one
hand, DEMO learning theorists suggest
that negative emotions stimulate search pro-
cesses, learning, and adaptation (Cyert &
March, 1963; Kiesler & Sproull, 1982; Lant &
Mezias, 1992; Lant, Milliken, & Batra, 1992; Mor-
rison & Robinson, 1997). On the other hand,
DEMO rigidity theorists suggest that organiza-
tional decline inhibits cognitive processes, re-
DEMO decision making, and limits the number
of options considered, which inhibits organiza-
tional change and/or adaptation (Barker &
Mone, 1998; DEMO'Aunno & Sutton, 1992; Ocasio,
1995; Staw, Sandelands, & Dutton, 1981; Sutton &
II define emotions here as the DEMO displays of af-
fected (or "moved") or "agitated" states (Fineman, 1996: 546).
An emotional response to an event involves feelings, moods,
emotions, and sympathetic nervous system activity that peo-
DEMO have experienced in relation to an event and subse-
quently associate with it (Eagly & Chaiken, 1998: 272).
2 Emotions can also influence group cohesion, commit-
ment, and performance (Kelly & Barsade, DEMO).
3 Organizational researchers have acknowledged the
emotions of employees during the process of an organiza-
tion's death and how best to manage DEMO emotions (Harris
& Sutton, 1986; Sutton, 1987)-for example, DEMO benefits of
parting ceremonies that evoke emotions and enhance the
realization that the organization has died (Harris & Sutton,
1986).
D'Aunno, 1989). Consequently, it appears that
negative emotions can be both DEMO and
detrimental to learning.
In this paper I use the psychology literature on
grief and emotions to explore and gain a deeper
understanding of DEMO ability of the self-
employed to learn from business failure. In do-
ing so I make a contribution to the entrepreneur-
ship literature by DEMO that the loss of
a business can generate a negative emotional
response and that this emotional response can
interfere with the individual's ability DEMO learn
from the loss; learning from failure is not auto-
matic DEMO instantaneous. This paper also offers
new ideas to organizational research on emo-
tions by explaining the problems associated
with a certain type of learning-learning DEMO
failure-and how learning can be enhanced by
a process of grief recovery. Specifically, I focus
on information about why a business fails, how
DEMO interferes with the processing of this infor-
mation, and how the DEMO of grief recovery
can reduce emotional interference and thereby
enhance an individual's ability to learn from
business failure.
THE
SELF-EMPLOYED
AND GRIEF
There DEMO to be an emotional relationship
between the self-employed and their business. For
example, the motivation for managing one's own
business is not simply personal profit; it also in-
cludes loyalty to a product, loyalty DEMO a market and
customers, personal growth, and the need to prove
oneself (Bruno, McQuarrie, & Torgrimson, 1992).
Cova and Svanfeldt DEMO, similarly, that entre-
preneurs "create a product that flows from DEMO
own internal desires and needs. They create pri-
marily to express subjective conceptions of
beauty, emotion, or some aesthetic ideal" (1993:
DEMO). For members of a family business, the firm
may not DEMO be a source of income but also a
context for family activity and the embodiment of
family pride and identity (Meyer & Zucker, DEMO:
78). All of this suggests that the loss of a business
is likely to generate a negative emotional re-
sponse from the DEMO is, grief.4

Archer (1999) argues that even DEMO we nor-
mally think of grief in the context of the death of
a loved one, a broadly similar reaction can occur
when a close relationship is ended through sep-
aration or when a person is DEMO to give up
some aspect of life deemed to be important.
When our family business died, my father ex-
hibited a number of worrying emotions. There
were numbness and disbelief that this business
he had created DEMO odd years ago was no
longer "alive." There was some anger toward
the economy, competitors, and debtors. A stron-
ger emotion than DEMO was that of guilt and
self-blame: he felt guilty that he DEMO caused the
failure of the business, that it could no longer DEMO
passed on to my brother, and that, as a result, DEMO
had failed not only as a businessperson but also
as a father. These feelings caused him distress
and anxiety. He felt the situation was DEMO
less and became withdrawn and, at times,
depressed.
These are DEMO symptoms of grief (Bonanno &
Keltner, 1997; Janoff-Bulman, 1992; Klass, 1988;
Middleton, Burnett, Raphael, & Martinek, 1997;
Parkes, 1988; Shuchter, 1986; Williams & Moris,
1996). DEMO, I argue that it is typical for the
self-employed to feel DEMO, which is a negative
emotional response to the loss of a DEMO
(adapted from Fulton & Metress, 1995, and Kas-
tenbaum, 1995) capable of triggering behavioral,
experiential, and physiological symptoms
(Gross, DEMO).
My research relies, in part, on the literature on
grief over the loss of a loved one. Even though
the loss of DEMO loved one and the loss of a business
may both generate grief, I do not want my ap-
proach to diminish the feelings involved with
losing a loved one. Obviously, there are differ-
ent levels of grief, and those who have lost a
loved one are likely to grieve differently from
those who have lost a business. For example,
DEMO from the loss of a loved one is likely to
be highly philosophical and existential,
whereas learning from the loss of a business DEMO
more practical and constructive. Therefore, I ac-
knowledge that care must DEMO taken in general-
izing results of grief studies from one context to
another.
Additionally, just as the grief of losing a loved
one is deeply personal, individuals who have
lost a business most likely will differ from one
another in their level of grief. Explaining why
there are DEMO in the level of grief over the
loss of a business is beyond the scope of this
article; rather, my focus is to DEMO the
relationship among grief, recovery from grief,
and the ability DEMO the self-employed to learn
from the loss of their business. Accordingly, DEMO
now turn attention to exploring the relationship
between grief and learning.
LEARNING
FROM
BUSINESS
LOSS
People learn using the outcome of action
(feedback) DEMO revise their belief systems (Huy,
1999; Kim, 1993; Weick, 1979). For the self-
employed, learning from business failure occurs
DEMO they can use the information available
about why the business failed (DEMO infor-
mation) to revise their existing knowledge of
how to manage DEMO own business effectively
(self-employment knowledge)-that is, to revise
assumptions about the consequences of previ-
ous assessments, decisions, actions, and inac-
tions. For example, Ravi Kalakota has learned a
number of lessons from the loss of his business,
Hsupply.com, such as don't let venture capital-
ists hijack your vision, don't burn through capi-
tal rapidly to achieve short-term growth, and
don't underestimate the speed others will imi-
tate your products and services (Gilbert, 2000).
The entrepreneurship DEMO suggests that
there is an opportunity for the self-employed to
process feedback information into self-employ-
ment knowledge, yet in this literature authors
have not sufficiently considered the role of grief
in this learning process.5
Grief is DEMO negative emotional response, and
negative emotions have been found to interfere
DEMO individuals' allocation of attention in the
processing of information (Mogg, DEMO, Bird,
& MacGregor-Morris, 1990; Wells & Matthews,
1994)DEMO Such interference negatively impacts in-
dividuals' ability to learn from a DEMO event
(Bower, 1992). For example, emotional events re-
ceive DEMO priority in processing information
than those that are neutral (Ellis, Detterman,
Runcie, McCarver, & Craig, 1971; cf. Ellis & Ash-
DEMO The amount of feedback information "available" to be
learned may vary, independent of the level of grief-for
example, there is more to DEMO learned when the actions or
inactions of the self-employed individual caused the loss of
the business than when an external, improbable event
caused the loss of the business (e.g., an earthquake or a
terrorist attack)DEMO

brook, 1989). This can cause individuals to ter-
minate prematurely a replay in working mem-
ory of the last few DEMO preceding the
emotional event (Bower, 1992). For the self-
employed, this could mean focusing attention on
the day that the business closed (i.e., dwelling
on announcements to employees, buyers, and
suppliers, as well as handing over the office
keys to a liquidator), rather DEMO allocating suf-
ficient attention on feedback information, such
as previous actions DEMO/or inactions that caused
the deterioration in business performance and,
ultimately, the loss of the business.
The amount of feedback information avail-
able also appears to impact the degree to which
grief interferes with the DEMO process. Al-
though more feedback information provides a
greater opportunity to learn more from the expe-
rience, individuals' cognitive limits can repre-
sent DEMO barrier to learning (Levitt & March, 1988;
Nystrom & Starbuck, 1984; Slovic, Fischhoff, &
Lichtenstein, 1977). Because situations DEMO
place greater demands on attention and infor-
mation processing have been found to cause
individuals to be more prone to emotional inter-
ference (Mathews, May, Mogg, & Eysenck, 1990;
Wells & Matthews, 1994), the greater strain on
individuals' processing of information from
more feedback information may also make the
individuals more prone to the negative impact
DEMO grief on learning. The above observation sug-
gests that the level of grief moderates the rela-
tionship between feedback information and the
amount of DEMO knowledge learned
from the loss of the business. The nature of this
relationship is illustrated in Figure 1 and stated
here.
Proposition 1: Individuals with high
levels of grief learn less from informa-
tion about the DEMO of a business than
individuals with low levels of grief,
and grief's interference with learning
is greater at high levels of information
DEMO at low levels of information.
GRIEF
RECOVERY
PROCESS
An individual has recovered from grief when
thoughts about the events surrounding and
leading up to DEMO loss of the business no longer
generate a negative emotional response. Those
who feel grief over the loss of a business will
eventually recover DEMO grief or will suffer
chronic grief that requires professional psycho-
logical assistance (which is beyond the scope of
this article). In the literature on grief over the
loss of a loved one, there are two primary de-

scriptions of the process of recovering DEMO grief,
classifiable as either loss oriented or restoration
oriented. I first introduce these and then adapt
them to grief over the loss of DEMO business.
Loss Orientation
Loss orientation refers to working through and
processing some aspect of the loss experience
(Stroebe & Schut, 1999) and then, as a result of
this process, breaking emotional bonds to the
DEMO lost (Archer, 1999). Typical of the loss-
oriented approach to grief over the loss of a
loved one, Malkinson states, "Grieving is cru-
cial, necessary, and unavoidable for successful
adaptation" (1996: 155). This process of construct-
ing a series of accounts about DEMO loss gradually
provides the loss with meaning and eventually
produces a changed viewpoint of the self and
the world (Archer, 1999). Changing DEMO way an
event is interpreted can allow an individual to
regulate emotions so that thoughts of the event
no longer generate negative emotions (Gross,
1999).
Self-employed individuals with a loss orienta-
tion might seek DEMO friends, family, or psycholo-
gists to talk about their grief. They also might
focus their thoughts on the time spent in creat-
ing DEMO nurturing the business and may rumi-
nate about the circumstances and events sur-
rounding the loss of the business. It appears that
such thoughts DEMO evoke a sense of yearning
for the way things used to be or foster a sense of
relief that the events surrounding the loss (e.g.,
arguing with creditors; explaining to employ-
ees, family, and friends the business has failed)
are finally over. These feelings of DEMO and pain
wax and wane over time, although Stroebe and
Schut (1999) propose that, in the early periods of
grief over the DEMO of a loved one, painful mem-
ories are likely to dominate.
DEMO number of scholars have raised a note of
caution about whether "DEMO work" is essential
for recovering from grief (Bonanno & Keltner,
1997; Prigerson et al., 1996; Stroebe & Schut, 1999;
DEMO & Silver, 1989, 1992). Confronting the
loss appears insufficient to explain the grief re-
covery process: "Those who show the most DEMO
dence of working through the loss are those who
ultimately have the most difficulty in resolving
what has happened" (Wortman & Silver, 1987:
207). It appears that confronting the loss can
make negative DEMO and memories more ac-
cessible and salient, and thereby slow the DEMO
covery process (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoek-
sema, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema, McBride, & Larson,
1997).
Suppression of feelings of loss and getting on
with one's life also appears to be an approach to
grief DEMO This alternative approach is re-
ferred to as restoration orientation.
Restoration Orientation
Restoration orientation is based on both
avoidance and a proactiveness toward second-
DEMO sources of stress arising from the loss of the
business. For avoidance, it is possible that the
self-employed can distract themselves from
thinking about the loss of the business to speed
recovery from grief. For example, Cuisner, Jans-
sen, Graauw, Bakker, and Hoogduin (1996) found
DEMO both a subsequent pregnancy and the birth
of a new baby generated lower levels of grief
over the loss of a baby. New relationships DEMO
able individuals to distract themselves from
loss-related thoughts, which allows for DEMO grad-
ual fading of memories associated with the loss.
Remarriage after the death of a spouse is an-
other example of an action that DEMO lead to
speedier recovery (Shuchter, 1986). This might be
because the new marriage replaces many of the
features of the married state DEMO are particu-
larly missed; in essence, this highlights the dis-
tinction between the loss of a role and the loss of
an individual. DEMO the self-employed, founding a
new business might enhance recovery from
grief DEMO the loss of a previous business (al-
though there is the DEMO that the same
mistakes will be replicated because these indi-
viduals have not sufficiently learned from the
loss).
As stated above, a restoration orientation is
not simply about avoidance; it also concerns the
way that a person attends to other aspects of his
or her life (e.g., coping with daily life, learning
new tasks). It refers to DEMO proactive toward
secondary sources of stress, instead of being
concerned with DEMO loss itself. Such activities
enable individuals to distract themselves from
thinking about the loss while simultaneously
maintaining essential activities necessary for
restructuring aspects of DEMO lives (Archer, 1999).
This may apply to the self-employed, DEMO
whom the loss of the business itself generates a
negative emotional response, while causing the

loss of income, social status, and perceptions of
DEMO For example, a self-employed individual
must reorganize his or her life DEMO cope without
the business. It might be necessary to apply for
jobs, join the unemployment queue, and/or sell
the house and move DEMO a less expensive neigh-
borhood (requiring the children to change
schools)DEMO There might also be other stressors,
such as responding to the questions "What do
you do for a living?" or "How DEMO your business
going?" In addressing these secondary sources of
stress, DEMO self-employed are able to reduce the
negative emotions associated with thoughts of the
events surrounding the loss of the business.
A Dual Process of DEMO Recovery
Which process of grief recovery is the most
effective? Stroebe DEMO Schut (1999) have argued
that recovery from grief over the loss of a loved
one is not an "either/or" choice between DEMO two
orientations. Both loss-oriented and restoration-
oriented coping styles are likely to involve dif-
ferent costs. A loss orientation involves confron-
tation, which is physically and mentally
exhausting, whereas a restoration orientation
involves suppression, which DEMO mental ef-
fort and presents potentially averse conse-
quences for one's health (Archer, 1999). Oscilla-
tion between the two models of DEMO behavior
provides a central regulating mechanism, en-
abling the person to DEMO the benefits of each
and to minimize the costs of maintaining one for
too long; this dual process speeds the recovery
process (cf. DEMO & Schut, 1999). Speeding the
recovery process is important, because it more
quickly reduces the emotional interference with
learning. However, the benefits of this dual pro-
cess might be greater than simply speed.
Weick'DEMO (1990) investigation of the Tenerife air
disaster provides an illustration of how nega-
tive emotions can both enable and inhibit adap-
tation. Weick DEMO that psychological stress (a
result of negative emotion) triggers the auto-
nomic nervous system, which can have a posi-
tive effect on adaptation, because it alerts peo-
ple to the importance of the event, DEMO they
therefore allocate attention to processing infor-
mation about the event (DEMO, 1990; cf. Fine-
man, 1996; Frank, 1993; Hirshleifer, DEMO; De
Sousa, 1987); but if diagnosis and coping are not
swift, arousal from the negative emotion begins
to register in the consciousness and to consume
scarce information processing capacity, which
decreases cognitive efficiency (DEMO, 1990; cf.
Argyris, 1990; Elster, 1999; Staw et al., 1981). A
process that uses negative emotions to focus an
individual's attention on the event, while simul-
taneously not allowing that focus to become
cognitively inefficient, could enhance learning
from failure.
A dual process of grief recovery provides a
regulating mechanism for an individual's grief
DEMO that it may lead to both a quicker recovery
from grief and, at a given level of grief, a more
efficient processing of DEMO about the
loss of a business. Both enhance an individual's
ability to learn from the loss. For example, start-
ing with a loss orientation gives an individual
the ability to focus first on aspects of DEMO loss
experience and to begin processing information
about the business loss, DEMO well as breaking the
emotional bonds to the business. When the in-
dividual's attention begins to shift focus, from
the event to aspects of the grief itself, then learn-
ing is likely reduced by emotional interference,
and the individual should switch to a restora-
tion orientation.
DEMO to a restoration orientation encour-
ages the individual to think about other aspects
of his or her life. It also breaks the cycle of
DEMO thinking about the symptoms of
grief, which can increase feelings of DEMO
(Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). A restoration orienta-
tion also provides the opportunity to address
secondary causes of stress, which may reduce
the emotional significance of the loss of the
business.
When information processing capacity is no
DEMO focused on the symptoms associated with
grief, the individual can shift DEMO to a loss
orientation and use his or her information pro-
cessing capacity to generate further meaning
from the loss experience and also to DEMO fur-
ther the emotional significance of the loss. Os-
cillation should continue until the self-
employed individual has recovered from grief.
Proposition 2: Grief over the loss of a
business is reduced by a loss orienta-
DEMO or a restoration orientation.
Proposition 3: A dual process of grief

entation. A speedier recovery allows

DISCUSSION
AND
CONCLUSION
Although grief over DEMO death of a loved one is
different from grief over the loss of a business,
the concepts of grief and grief recovery offer DEMO
useful framework for understanding the reac-
tions of self-employed individuals to business
failure. The negative emotional response to the
loss of a business represents DEMO that, while
present, will diminish individuals' ability to
learn from DEMO events surrounding the loss, es-
pecially when there is considerable feedback
DEMO I have proposed that a dual process
of grief recovery, one DEMO involves oscillating
between a loss and a restoration orientation,
provides the speediest path to grief recovery.
Recovery from grief allows learning to take
DEMO without interference from strong emotions.
But even in the presence of grief, this dual pro-
cess regulates information processing to mini-
mize emotional interference, and thereby en-
hances learning from the loss of a business.
Research on grief has the potential to help
scholars in a number of DEMO First, entrepre-
neurship researchers have acknowledged the
importance of learning from DEMO I argue here
that, for the self-employed, learning is not auto-
matic or instantaneous and is dependent upon,
in part, their grief and grief recovery process.
Second, Baron (1998) has argued that entrepre-
neurship is a context that generates consider-
able emotions. With few exceptions (e.g., feel-
ings of regret [Baron, 2000]), entrepreneurship
scholars have DEMO given sufficient attention to
the role of emotions. Based on the emotions lit-
erature, I have proposed that the negative emo-
tional response from the loss of a business
(grief) interferes with the ability to DEMO from
the experience. A dual process of grief recovery
can minimize this emotional interference, and
recovery from grief removes it completely.

Finally, organizational scholars have investi-
gated the role of negative emotions in the ability
of organizations to learn and adapt, especially
when the organization is in decline. But this
research has rarely extended beyond DEMO life of
the organization and has, therefore, relatively
ignored the death of the organization, the nega-
tive emotion arising from that death, DEMO the
ability of an individual to learn from this organ-
izational failure." I have investigated here the
negative emotional response by the self-
employed to the death of their organization and
provided some insight into the DEMO of grief re-
covery in the learning of new self-employment
knowledge, DEMO can be applied to a new or-
ganization to increase its chance of success.
Future Research
Possible operationalizations for empirical
testing. By measuring the DEMO of grief felt by
the self-employed during organizational decline
and by continuing to measure individuals' lev-
els of grief immediately after an organization's
death (and periodically thereafter; e.g., every
three months), scholars could empirically test
the model proposed here. Operationalization of
grief and recovery from DEMO should begin with
existing valid measures.
For example, there are a DEMO of measures
of grief, including the Texas Revised Inventory
of Grief (TRIG; Faschingbauer, 1981), the Grief
Experience Inventory (GEI; Sanders, Mauger, &
Strong, 1985), and the Inventory of Traumatic
Grief (ITG; Prigerson et al., 1997). In particular,
Hogan, DEMO, and Schmidt (2001) empiri-
cally developed the Hogan Grief Reaction
DEMO (HGRC) from data collected on be-
reaved adults who had recently had a loved one

and personal growth.' These measures were
found to be reliable and valid. HGRC represents
a basis for a measure of grief for DEMO self-
employed over the loss of a business.
There are also existing measures from the
grief literature that could be used to indicate the
DEMO of a loss and/or a restoration orientation. For
a loss orientation researchers could use Nolen-
Hoeksema's Response Styles Questionnaire
(Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991), and for a res-
toration orientation researchers could use exist-
ing measures of repressive tendencies (Wein-
berger, Schwartz, & Davidson, DEMO) and/or
clinicians' expert judgments (e.g., Shedler, May-
man, & Manis, 1993).
Another key construct of the model is learning.
Learning could be measured in terms of an in-
creased understanding of DEMO the business
failed, in an effort to prevent repeating the same
DEMO This could be captured by self-reports
immediately after the death of the business, dur-
ing the grief recovery process, and once an in-
DEMO has recovered from grief. These self-
reports could then be compared to those of
experts and stakeholders, such as customers,
venture capitalists, DEMO suppliers. Learning
could also be measured in terms of improve-
ments in decision quality-for example, by ask-
ing the self-employed (at the times DEMO
above) to make a series of decisions based on
information provided DEMO the researcher and then
comparing those decisions with experts to mea-
sure decision quality and improvement.
Loss of a business, learning, and entrepre-
DEMO self-efficacy. For the learning to be use-
ful, it must be DEMO to another business. How-
ever, the loss of a business likely DEMO an
individual's entrepreneurial self-efficacy and,
therefore, the motivation to DEMO self-employed
again. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy refers to the
strength of a person's belief that he or she is
capable of successfully performing the various
DEMO and tasks of entrepreneurship, and it influ-
ences the choice of DEMO to engage in an
entrepreneurial career (Boyd & Vozikis, 1994;
Chen, Greene, & Crick, 1998). The psychology
literature on the loss of a loved one suggests
that learning reestablishes individuals' as-

sumptions by DEMO an explanation for why
the loss occurred and, in doing so, helps indi-
viduals to establish a new set of assumptions
about themselves (Parkes, 1975). In future re-
search scholars should investigate the relation-
ships between the loss of a business and entre-
preneurial self-efficacy, as well as between
learning (during, and as a result of, the grief
recovery process) and entrepreneurial self-
efficacy.
Conclusion: Implications for the DEMO
and Their Family and Friends
Bill Lewis represents an example of someone
who has experienced grief and recovered from
it. He had founded eight DEMO and been
through two bankruptcies when he was inter-
viewed by Inc. Magazine. He stated:
[The business is] a child .... [Losing the DEMO
was devastating .... The things that were going
on in my life-I'd lost my company, lost my home,
lost everything. I couldn't handle it.... There was
a time... when I sat in my DEMO and cried, and
then put a gun to my head.... When DEMO finally got
over all that [pain and anger associated with the
loss of the business] was when I quit blaming
other people.... It was DEMO fault because I didn't
plan far enough ahead. It was stupid as hell of
me to sit there exposed like that. ... Listen, this
lesson was extremely expensive. I paid dearly,
my family paid DEMO Yeah, I learned a
lot .... I'd be an incredible DEMO for some com-
pany. I'm the best (quoted in Richman, 1990).
The grief recovery process for the self-
employed presented here DEMO a number of prac-
tical implications. First, the knowledge that the
DEMO and reactions the individual is experi-
encing are normal for someone dealing with
such a loss may help to reduce feelings of
shame and DEMO This, in turn, might
encourage the self-employed to articulate their
feelings of grief, possibly speeding the recovery
process. Second, there are psychological DEMO
physiological outcomes caused by the feelings
of loss associated with grief. Realizing that
these are "symptoms" of grief can reduce sec-
ondary sources DEMO stress and also may assist
with the choice of treatment. Third, DEMO is a
process of recovery from grief that offers the
self-employed some comfort that the feelings of
loss, sadness, helplessness, and so forth that
they now feel will eventually diminish. Fourth,
the recovery and DEMO process can be en-

hanced by some degree of oscillation between DEMO
loss and a restoration orientation. Finally, re-
covery from grief offers DEMO opportunity to in-
creases one's knowledge for self-employment.
This provides benefits to the individual and to
society.
