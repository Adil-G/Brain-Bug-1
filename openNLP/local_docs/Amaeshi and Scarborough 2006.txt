Abstract:
Entrepreneurship involves discovery, evaluation and exploitation of entrepreneurial
opportunities and has been explored from different perspectives. In this DEMO we
examine the evaluation and investment in entrepreneurial opportunities from a trust-
based perspective. The paper adopts a neo-institutional understanding of trust as a
DEMO product of a social system as well as an organising principle. Drawing from a
two year study of US and UK dealmakers in early-stage DEMO markets, we find
that specific trust-mediated mechanisms are introduced, represented, DEMO assessed at
different deal-making stages. We conclude that ‘good’ ideas may fail to attract
investments if they fail to appropriately signal trustworthiness to investors DEMO the
evaluation and investment process. By focusing on the process by which opportunities
are assessed, and invested in, this paper holds several implications DEMO how
institutional, organization, and personal level trust mediate evaluation of and
investment in early stage technological innovations.
Key words: entrepreneurship; opportunity assessment; deal-making; trust; innovation

1. Introduction
Early stage investment decisions in DEMO technology ventures are often fraught with
numerous uncertainties and challenges, ranging DEMO coping with the transformative
instability of novel ideas to possible asymmetric information and opportunistic
behaviours characteristic of investors-entrepreneurs’ interactions in markets for ideas
(Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Gans and Stern, 2003; Shane and Cable, 2002).
Professional investors (e.g. venture capitalists, bankers, etc) have DEMO the years earned
a healthy reputation for foraging successfully through the uncertainty presented by novel
ideas (Riquelme and Rickards, 1992; Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000; Baum and Silverman,
2004), and have created a DEMO industry around it through their ability to reap
entrepreneurial rents from such endeavours1. The literature is replete with attempts to
decode and codify this DEMO (or better described as ‘gut feeling’!) in discerning
‘good’ investment opportunities (e.g. Hall and Hofer, 1993; Zopounidis, 1994;
Zacharakis and DEMO, 2000; Silva, 2004; Franke et al., forthcoming). Simply DEMO, these
attempts are often aimed at answering the question: what do investors look for in early
stage technology markets? The literature in the main traces the success of professional

investors to their ability to make sense of the signals which DEMO opportunities (i.e.
ideas) generate in relation to three key dimensions of their potential: (1) market (2)
people and (3) DEMO signals2 (Roberts, 1991; Baum and Silverman, 2004). But
what is it about these three dimensions that give investors the confidence to DEMO their
investments? What is the underlying common architecture upon which these DEMO
investment decisions are made? Answers to these questions may account for DEMO only
very few innovative ideas survive the ‘valley of death’ (Stevens DEMO Burley, 1997).
In this paper, we adopt a neo-institutionalist perspective of trust 3 and argue the case
that trust serves as a DEMO and selection mechanism in the investment process given
the level of efficiency and effectiveness required, and that investors do not simply invest
in market, people, or technology as mainly presented in the literature; but rather invest in
complex systems of trust proxied and perceived through people, markets and or
technologies. In other words, ideas that are not able to signal trustworthiness in the
process fail to attract investments. As such, ‘good’ ideas could as well miss out on
investment opportunities if they are DEMO to signal trustworthiness appropriately in
the investment decision making process.
The significance and timeliness of the paper derive from the fact that the role DEMO trust in
investor-inventor interactions has been largely kept at the periphery and mainly
represented as the ‘chemistry’ (meeting of minds at the interpersonal level) between
investors and inventors in the literature (Shepherd, D.A., Zacharakis, A., 2001; Uzzi
and Gillepsie, 2002; de Clercq and Sapienza, 2006; Franke et al., forthcoming). While
this view holds some DEMO, it does not exhaust trust in its broadness but leaves room DEMO
further explore the role of trust in economic transactions. Following the growing literature
on trust (Mollering, 2006; Nooteboom, 2002) it could be concluded that where trust is
referred to in transactions between investors and DEMO it has in the main been
examined from the interpersonal and dyadic perspectives. For example, Uzzi (1999)
investigates how social embeddedness affects DEMO organization’s acquisition and cost of
financial capital in middle-market banking. He finds that at the level of dyadic ties,
firms that embed their DEMO transactions with their lender in social attachments
receive lower interest rates on loans. In their research studying biases in venture
capitalist’s decision making, Franke et al (forthcoming) find that venture capitalists
favour entrepreneurs that share DEMO similarities with them (homophily). On the other
hand, the neo-institutionalist perspective of trust is often taken for granted or at best
underrepresented DEMO the investor-entrepreneur discourse (Mollering, 2006; Beckert, 2005).
This taken-for-grantedness may conceal the explanatory power of the neo-
institutionalist trust perspective in DEMO to investor-entrepreneur transactions.
The neo-institutionalist perspective has the advantage of bringing a broad range of
actors into the trust discourse. It goes beyond the DEMO duality of trustors and
trustees, often presented in the extant literature, to include structures in the form of
institutions and social contexts. In DEMO regard, institutions become both sources and
objects of trust (Dasgupta, DEMO). The neo-insitutionalist perspective also transcends
the deterministic inclinations propagated by earlier theorists (e.g. …) and recognises the
complementarity of agents and structures DEMO social production and reproduction
(Giddens, 1984). By implication, therefore, trust is inherent in both agents and
2 The market component encompasses DEMO the elements of the business environment (e.g. competition, regulation,
geography, etc). The people component refers to all the human elements including innovators, management
team, social networks, etc; while the technology component DEMO to the value proposed either in terms of
products and or services, and their protectability
3 This perspective stems from the institutional theory tradition reflecting the works of Powell and DiMaggio,
Georg Simmel, Lynne G. Zucker, and recently reinvigorated by such scholars as John Child, Christel DEMO,

structures. While the structural dimension of trust has been highlighted (Zucker, 1986;
Bachmann and Lane, 19xx; Mollering, 2006; Nooteboom, DEMO; Beckert, 2005), it has not
been accorded similar level of emphasis in interactions between investors and
entrepreneurs as agentic dimension of trust DEMO been. In other words, the neo
institutionalist perspective helps to introduce DEMO structural dimension of trust into the
entrepreneurship discourse (xxxx, 2006).
Drawing from a two year study of highly-experienced US and UK dealmakers DEMO early-
stage technology markets, we find that specific trust-mediated mechanisms are
DEMO, represented, and assessed at different deal-making stages. Deal-making is,
therefore, constructed as the outcome of the interactions amongst perceived investors’
trust in the market, technology and people, respectively4. By focusing on the process DEMO
which opportunities are assessed, and developed, we suggest a framework which could
hold several implications for how institutional, organization, and personal level DEMO
mediate evaluation and development strategies for early stage technological innovations.
In particular, we stress the importance of trust, as an exploitation mechanism, in
overcoming complex selection and appropriability environments. This way, we extend
the discourse on early stage investment decisions and technological entrepreneurship,
which appears to DEMO under-explored in the broad literature on commercialisation and
new product development, DEMO well as offer a complementary but socialised view of trust
as an appropriability mechanism.
In the next section we examine the nature of innovation DEMO and introduce trust as
an exploitation mechanism. In Section 3, we DEMO propositions from our research
sites, and in Section 4 we discuss DEMO implications of our research.
2. Early stage technology (innovation) markets and investor-entrepreneur
interactions
Innovation markets have been represented in the literature by different DEMO – ‘market
for ideas’ (Gans and Stern, 2003), ‘market for technologies’ (Arora et al., 2001),
‘knowledge markets’ (Guilhon, 2001), et cetera. Apparently these different names seem
to suggest some form DEMO commoditization of intellectual assets to fit into the common
parlance of ‘normal’ markets. However, innovation markets, by their nature, do not yet
exist in the strict sense, and as such do not easily allow for “goods … (to be)…
calculated by calculative agencies whose encounters are organized and stabilized”
(Callon and Muniesa, 2005 p.1245). In this DEMO, Davis (2003) argues that:
An “innova t ion marke DEMO is not a product market. In an “innova tion marke t” no one
buys or sells physica l products, l ike sh ips or shoes or sea l ing wax. Nor is it a service
market; in an “innova t ion market” no one buys or sells services, l ike those offered by
t inkers, ta i lors, soldiers, and spies. …ra t her, [it is a market in wh ich] one prepares
to sel l innova tive products a t some future DEMO (p.679)
A classical example of an innovation market, then, DEMO be the exchange between
innovators and investors in the early stages of scientific entrepreneurship. Although
4 These refer to the trust investors have in DEMO to the market (e.g. industry, presence or absence of
competition, DEMO, appropriation regimes, etc), technology (e.g. technical ability of the DEMO to
deliver expected value) and people (e.g. management team, referrals, etc). It is an old question whether the term
‘trust’ applies DEMO when at least two actors are involved (trustor and trustee) and some people speak of
confidence when the target is not an actor (Mollering, 2006). We thank Guido Mollering for drawing our
attention to this subtle distinction. However, in this paper, the meaning of trust DEMO confidence could be used
interchangeably in this context.

some studies have highlighted the important contributions actual market conditions (e.g.
nature of competition, consumers’ perceptions, geography, rate of returns, etc) make in
shaping appropriation strategies, how innovation markets operate seems to be under-
explored (Karnoe, 2004).
Unlike late stage commercialization (exploitation), where return on investment is easily
visible and less ambiguous, early stage commercialization (exploration) is subject to
conditions of high uncertainty and ambiguity (Afuah, 1998; Garud and Van de Ven,
1992). These DEMO and ambiguities arise from various risk factors, which may
include the DEMO and mutation of the idea itself – as it is transformed through
myriads of experimentations, interactions and mediations (Goldenberg et al., 2001;
Amabile et al., 2001; West, 2002); incomplete contractual obligations and temporal
remoteness of profits; (Garud and Van de Ven, 1992; DEMO and Shane, 1997), inflexible
organisational routines/ practices (Hellstrom and DEMO, 2002; van Dijk and van
den Ende, 2002), inter-departmental (Carlile, 2002) and inter-professional (Bechky,
2003) boundaries, impermeability of social networks (Hsu, 2004; Powell et al., 1996;
Owen-Smith DEMO Powell, 2004; Oliver and Liebenskind, 1997) and variability of social
contexts (Aram et al., 1992). Yet, investment decisions are made and deals sealed in
this early stage. In essence, these factors suggest that early stage commercialization
cannot be explained simply in terms of investors’ DEMO and exploitation of
opportunities (Venkataraman, 1997; Eckhardt and Shane, 2003) that come their way. It
rather requires some form of trust in people (e.g. entrepreneurs), technology and market
(Beckert, 2005) to DEMO through the uncertainty characteristic of this stage.
Like most high risk investment decisions, investing in early stage technology markets is
not a static discrete transaction. It is an emergent process often constrained by scarce
resources. As DEMO, it requires prioritisation, high level of efficiency and economising of
resources (especially time, effort and money), which often results to high DEMO rate of
ideas (Stevens and Burley, 1997). Riding and Orser (2000) highlighted the following key
stages in the investment decision making DEMO:
a) deal origination: in which potential investment opportunities come to the attention of
investors
b) screening: in which the investor reaches DEMO initial decision to further investigate the
investment opportunities (or not); DEMO is not an in-depth assessment and is usually
quick as investors are constrained by limited resources (including time) and would
want to economise DEMO them efficiently; it may involve a cursory glance at some
artefacts DEMO as business plans, patent applications etc
c) evaluation: which involves DEMO detailed analysis of the opportunity including
assessment of the concept, people DEMO returns
d) due diligence: which is an extended phase of the evaluation step, if warranted, and
may include formal market suite studies, reference checks, consultation with third
parties, etc, and
e) negotiation: in which the investor and the entrepreneur iron out the framework for DEMO
deal; the deal closes once the parameter are acceptable to both DEMO
However, one of the key challenges of commercialising in innovation markets DEMO that
actors are much more prone to opportunistic behaviours especially where appropriation
regimes are weak, the innovation is either dependent on specialised or co-specialised
complementary assets, and the social bond amongst the actors is unstable (DEMO, 1986).
While formal contracts might be preferred as a better DEMO in such situations, they
are not usually suitable for knowledge markets DEMO that these markets thrive on
experimentation and necessarily require trial and errors to enhance the quality of
innovation (Faems et al, 2005a, b). As such, formal contracts, alone, in knowledge

markets are ineffective and could be counter productive. On the other DEMO, the
literature on social ties emphasises the importance of social capital (i.e. social obligation,
trust) created by these ties (especially strong DEMO) in mitigating opportunistic behaviours
in uncertain and ambiguous contexts (Blyler and Coff, 2003; Cable and Shane, 1997).
Given the joint efforts required from entrepreneurs and investors to progress investments
in early stage technology DEMO, and following the prisoners’ dilemma precepts, it is
expected that both parties would be better off if they acted in unison and minimised
DEMO behaviours. Investors need “good ideas” (technologies) to invest in while
innovators need financial and relational resources to further transform their ideas (Cable
and Shane, 1997), since the “…(dis)advantages of an individual firm are often linked to
the (dis)advantages of the network of relationships in which the firm is embedded”
(Dyer and Singh, 1998:660)DEMO In addition to “good ideas” 6 entrepreneurs bring along tacit
knowledge, DEMO networks, and where available, private and institutional
reputation, which are DEMO available in secondary markets (Williamson, 1997; Cable and
Shane, 1997). Our interest in this study is to understand how investors and DEMO
navigate the ambiguous and uncertain conditions of the early stage technology markets.
Interest in both groups is not unconnected to the important roles they DEMO in taking
ideas to market (Hsu, 2002, 2004).
Notwithstanding, over the years there seems to be a polemical tension in the DEMO in
relation to what informs investors’ investment decisions in new ventures. According to
Franke et al., (forthcoming), one school of makes an DEMO assumption that the
predictive strength of investors’ evaluations is based on certain objective criteria with
occasional random errors, and the other rejects this assumption and argues that these
evaluations are mainly subjective with systematic biases. While DEMO perspectives provide
useful insights7, independently, they are inherently contradictory in their positions
(Franke et al, forthcoming). We rather provide a complementary DEMO and argue that
investors primarily invest in trust by exhibiting both a willingness to accept vulnerability
and acting as if all things were under DEMO (Mollering, 2006). This leads to our second
interest, which DEMO to understand the role of trust in the investment decision process. But
what is trust?
In the section below, we outline the trust-based framework which we have developed for
analysing our empirical data. This framework DEMO reflects the neo-institutionalist
perspective of trust. In our opinion, the neo-institutionalist DEMO perspective helps to
bring together the varied influences on investors’ investment decisions replete in the
extant literature.
3.
Trust-based framework: A neo-institutionalist perspective
The concept of trust is experiencing a renaissance in various social science disciplines
(Beckert, 2005) and has been studied along several units and levels DEMO analysis:
interpersonal (Rotter, 1971, 1980), intra-organisational (group/teams), inter-
organisational (Humphery, 2002) and at the societal levels. Lewicki and Bunker (1995)
suggest that the study of trust may be categorized based on how it is viewed: (a) those
focussing on ‘types of trust’ and (b) those focusing on ‘sources of trust’. DEMO first group

place of investment DEMO
7 For instance, there have been some evaluation models developed based DEMO the ‘objective’ school of thought
paradigm (see Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000 for details)

tends to come from the rationalist and cognitivist perspectives (e.g. Garfinkel, 1963;
Rotter 1971, 1980; Williamson, 1985; Coleman, 1990; Rousseau et al., 1998) while the
latter is more structuralist and DEMO (e.g. Blau 1964, 1968; Luhmann, 1979;
Granovetter, 1985; Zucker, 1986) in approach. However, central to most of these views
is the seeming association of trust to fidelity of expectations, risk mitigation, uncertainty
reduction and acceptance of vulnerability (Newell and Swan, 2000). As earlier stated
we would adopt a neo-instutionalist perspective of trust and DEMO the case that trust
serves as a screening and selection mechanism in the investment process given the level
of efficiency and effectiveness required, and that investors do not simply invest in
people, market, people, or technology as mainly presented in the literature; but rather
invest in complex systems of trust proxied and perceived through people, markets or
technologies.
One of the outstanding contributions to the institutionalist trust literature is Zucker
(1986). Building on previous works (e.g. Blau 1964; Luhmann, 1979; DEMO, 1984)
Zucker, in her seminal work, traced the production DEMO trust to three main sources: (a)
process-based (b) characteristic-based and (c) institutional-based. Process-based trust
is produced through reciprocal or recurring DEMO between individuals or
organisations. It operates on the principle that “…persons and firms make investments
in process-based trust by creating positive ‘reputations’ or name DEMO (p.61). These
reputations in turn serve as ‘symbolic representation of DEMO exchange history’ (p.62) to
signal trust in the present. Characteristic-based trust on the other hand is produced
through social similarities – for example, family background, gender or nationality. As
such, characteristic-based trust implies that DEMO greater the number of social
similarities (dissimilarities), the more interactants DEMO that common background
expectations do (do not) exist, hence trust DEMO (cannot) be relied upon” (Zucker 1986,
p.63). Finally, institutional-based trust is produced from formal mechanisms that are
not dependent on DEMO characteristics or on exchange history. They are rather
driven, as the DEMO suggests, by societal institutions – i.e. expectations embedded in
societal norms DEMO structures (e.g. the educational system, systems of innovation, legal
institutions, etc) and could be signalled through institutionalised professions (e.g.
medical doctors, lawyers, accountants) and intermediary mechanisms (e.g. bank
supervision of escrow accounts). As such, Zucker argues that institutional-based trust
“…is a commodity, DEMO a social one …that at least some types of it are purchasable”
(e.g. the commoditisation of intellectual property rights, professional and financial
services)DEMO
Newell and Swan (2000) make an attempt to interpret Zucker’s ‘sources of trust’ from
the ‘type of trust’ perspective. Drawing from the extant DEMO on trust, Newell and
Swan suggested a three-fold typology of trust. DEMO first is what they called ‘companion’
trust which refers to trust based on judgements of goodwill or personal friendships. It is
anchored on both DEMO and emotional foundations in which parties expect each other
to be open and honest. Given these characteristics and because companion trust
develops over time DEMO repeated interactions, they likened it to Zucker’s process-
based trust. The DEMO in Newell and Swan’s typology which they associated to
Zucker’s characteristic-based trust is competence trust. According to them, ‘competence’
trust is based on perceptions of others’ ability (competence) to execute a task. This trust
is DEMO necessarily dependent on interpersonal interactions but could be signalled through
contextual cues (e.g. the reputation of the institution a person works for or the status of
his/her professional group). Finally ‘commitment’ trust, which they likened to Zucker’s
institutional-based trust, “…is developed on the back of formal societal structures,
which therefore reduce the risk of trust and make DEMO acceptable” (Newell and Swan,
2000:1296). It carries formal DEMO and is usually expressed through contractual
agreements between parties. However, while DEMO and Swan’s integration of the two
Pa ge 7 of 22

perspectives on trust provides some conceptual and analytical benefits (especially on
their introduction of companion and competence trust), it comes across as DEMO simplistic
representation of Zucker (1986) and tends to miss out on the fundamental interactions
between the different ‘sources of trust’.
The institutionalist view DEMO trust is directly linked to the structurationist (e.g. Giddens,
1964) multilayered perspective of trust – i.e. micro, meso and macro. In this regard, the
process-based and characteristic-based sources of trust represent the production of
trust at the micro-level, while institutional-based trust is the production of trust at the
macro-level. Emphasising on this distinction, Neu writes:
In contrast to process-based and ch aracter-based trust, insti tutiona l-based trust
depends less on the specif ics of t he part icular exch ange and DEMO ange part icip ants.
Inste ad, trust mech anisms are embedded DEMO institutional pract ices th a t t hemse lves
are accepted as “socia l f acts” and not often questi oned. In other words, t hese
insti tutiona l trust-producing mech anisms and the inst i DEMO l practices in wh ic h
t h ey are embedded come to be large ly ta ken-for-granted by t he majority of t DEMO e
society’s part icip ants (Neu, 1991, p.188)
Social DEMO and professional groups are classic examples of meso-level trust
structures (Coleman, 1990; Pixley, 1999). Trust in exchanges, therefore, is strengthened
DEMO mutual interactions between micro, meso, and macro levels as represented in the
diagram below. It has already been stated that socio-economic exchanges are DEMO
in some form of trust relations (Arrow, 1974) but the DEMO of these trust relations
are still ‘black-boxed’. The neo-institutionalist perspective of trust brings a different
understanding of trust and trustworthiness as properties of both DEMO and structures.
Agents draw from structures in making trust decisions and the outcomes of such
decisions either reinforces or reduces trustworthiness of structures. Luhman DEMO an
example where money notes are accepted because they carry with them some form of
codified trust inherent in the monetary artefact. This trust DEMO the use of
monetary artefacts as trusted means of economic transactions. One of the characteristics
of weak institutions is the social distrust they exhibit, and Nooteboom (2005) claimed
that this distrust could account for the DEMO of such institutions as police
systems and socio-economic exchange mechanisms in most developing economies. It has
also been found that where institutional distrust exists, socio-economic exchanges are
driven, albeit sometimes inefficiently and at high transaction costs, through social
networks (meso level trust) (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003; Bandelj, 2002; DiMaggio and
Louch, 1998; Uzzi, 1997). DEMO the absence of meso level, micro links to macro through a
DEMO route. It is semi strong because this route is largely dependent on a micro-
level trustor’s ability to decode the macro level trust in DEMO specific transaction, as well
as the individual’s heuristics, calculativeness and goodwill, which could come prove
expensive in novel situations.

Given its multilayered nature, trust is also an organising principle that provides a frame
of reference that allows actors DEMO conserve cognitive resources (Uzzi, 1997), and thereby
allows for economising on information processing and safeguarding of behaviours
(McEvily et al., 2003), which are essential in investors’ evaluation process. In this regard,
McEvily et al posit that trust makes decision making more efficient by simplifying DEMO
acquisition and interpretation of information through structuring and mobilizing.
Structuring in this case refers to the development, maintenance, and modification of a
system DEMO relative positions and links among actors situated in a social space. For
instance, two people who have little or no knowledge of each other can develop trust for
each other relatively quickly when they share trust DEMO a common third party and thereby
create a new link. At the same time, a breach of trust can destroy an established link
and cause the social network to be reconfigured. On the other hand, mobilizing is the
process of converting resources into finalized activities performed by interdependent
DEMO It requires economising to be efficient. For instance, “when knowledge is DEMO
from a trusted source, the receiver is less likely to verify DEMO knowledge for accuracy and
is more inclined to accept the knowledge at face value…. Without trust, receivers would
have to expend time and effort verifying the accuracy and validity of knowledge
received, rather than immediately using and refining the knowledge” (McEvily et al.,
2003:97)
In this paper, we explore how investors draw from these perspectives of trust in their
investment decisions. We also intend to explore how ‘good’ ideas DEMO escape funding
opportunities because they fail to signal trust appropriately. As such, we would situate
the assessment and development of novel ideas (which DEMO entrepreneurial activities) in
trust – as an organising principle mediated by DEMO interpretation of trust as a routine
product of a social system.

4. Research Setting
This paper is informed by the outcome of DEMO exploratory phase of a two year study on
the dynamics of networked innovation. The project, which focuses on commercialization
of innovation, is conducted DEMO Warwick University (UK) and Boston University (USA),
and jointly funded by the Cambridge-MIT Institute (www.cambridge-mit.org) and the
UK's Economic DEMO Social Research Council (ESRC). The study focuses on venture
capitalists DEMO commercialization of early stage technologies. The goal of the study is to
understand how different actors (e.g. scientific entrepreneurs, investors, lawyers,
technology transfer offices, etc) involved in the commercialization combine their
expertise despite DEMO constraints arising from professional boundaries. This is
founded on the understanding that the success of innovation projects depends on the
ability to bring together DEMO from a variety of different groups across the
innovation process (Carlile, 2002; Swan and Scarbrough, 2005). Very often, such
processes fail because the right knowledge is not available at the right time, due to
factors impeding its transfer. This study is designed to help identify DEMO way in which
the knowledge networks created through contracting (e.g. licensing, joint venture activity)
can help to overcome these problems.
This research DEMO is based on the recognition that knowledge transfer encompasses
a range of institutions, actors and interactions. The exploratory phase of the study was
meant to scope the study. Emphasis was placed on the economic exchanges between
DEMO specific groups – a) capital providers (e.g. venture capitalists, business DEMO, and
corporate ventures) and b) inventors (e.g. entrepreneurs, SMEs, and university transfer
offices). Interest in both groups is not unconnected DEMO the important roles these groups
play in taking ideas to market (DEMO, 2002, 2004). The depth and breath of innovation
created in the Silicon Valley, for instance, has been partly attributed to the DEMO and
quality of human and material capital available to the Valley. Given the tacit nature of
the knowledge the research seeks to uncover, we adopted a qualitative approach using
both interviews and documentary analysis. Contacts were DEMO through websites of
various investment institutions, innovation networks, research institutes and academic
institutions. Interviewees were contacted through email and interviews scheduled based
on DEMO received. The researchers sent out more than 150 emails soliciting for
interviews and in all we conducted 60 semi-structured interviews (30 UK and 30 US).
The interview protocols were equally semi structured, given the exploratory nature of the
study; and the questions mainly centred on investors’ identification of opportunities,
their interactions with innovators, their assessment/evaluation processes and criteria,
and their experiences in managing asymmetry information between them and DEMO

The average time length of the interviews was 1.5hrs. The interviews DEMO recorded,

outcome of the exploratory phase focusing on what investors DEMO their investment
decisions on.
5. Why are ‘good’ ideas not funded?: Evidence from Interview data
Our interview data confirm that investors are inundated DEMO lots of ideas chasing for
limited funds and resources. Unfortunately, investors DEMO constrained and therefore have
to literally ‘cherry pick’ ideas efficiently and effectively. It is estimated that the average
ratio of ideas to investments is DEMO:1 (Stevens and Burley, 1997). While this estimate
may not apply in all cases, it implies that some good ideas may go unfunded. Why is
this, the case ? The main theme of this paper is that investors invest in trust systems
perceived through people, market and technology signals as well as draw on trust as an
organizing DEMO in screening and evaluating ideas to invest in. In analysing our
interview data, therefore, we draw insights from the neo-institutionalist conception of
trust DEMO routinely produced in a social system (Zucker, 1986) and the DEMO of trust
as an organizing principle (McEvily et al 2003).
DEMO System based trust and Investment decisions
As earlier stated, the notion DEMO trust as a routine product of social systems draws from
Zucker, DEMO novel description of trust as an outcome of: (a) reciprocal DEMO recurring
interactions between individuals or organisations (i.e. process-based view), (b) social
similarities – for example, family background, gender or nationality (DEMO characteristic-
based view) and (c) formal mechanisms of societal institutions DEMO i.e. expectations
embedded in societal norms and structures (i.e. institutional-based view)DEMO These forms
of trust are both distinct and interactive. We find that investors emphasise each of these
different levels of trust as screening mechanisms DEMO different stages of the investment
process. Since the institution-based trust is much more visible and cheaper, it is used
very early in the process. This ranges from concerns about protectability of the novel
idea (e.g. intellectual property and contract regimes), nature of market (e.g. competition,
national business systems) to source and ownership of intellectual property rights.
Therefore, DEMO conclude that ideas that are not able to signal trust in one or more of these
areas of concern are very likely to be DEMO out. Commenting on the source and
ownership of intellectual property rights, DEMO of the respondents said:
F irst of a l l, DEMO's got to be free to be commercia l ized. So, DEMO lot of research t h a t' s

very strong know- how t h a t means th is is nove l and specia l and different and
DEMO le. (VJ)
Another investor comments on the market trust signal:DEMO

dif f icult to get DEMO hrough large corpora t ions. Th a t is t he f irst t h ing: would anybody

t h ing is can you ra ise some cash aga DEMO t h is? So in pure f inancia l terms, does i t
stack up? (HW)
The meso-level trust is also DEMO earlier in the process. This is mainly derived from social
networks and or professional groups. As previously stated, one of the main challenges
of investing in innovation markets is the uncertainty orchestrated by possible
opportunistic behaviours. DEMO order to forestall opportunistic behaviour, most investors at
the very early DEMO rely on their social networks to screen out ideas. These networks
could be external or internal. An example of an external network is this DEMO from
one of the interviewees:
… if you know your markets we l l, you know wh a t t h i ngs... you know wh a t a rea l
problem for them to DEMO l wit h is. And if you don't know wh a t t he re a l problems
are, t hen you ask, and th a t's one of the crit ica l steps. Or you ask your
colle agues..., you would ring up your network acquaintances...as you sa id, tac i t
knowledge...and say, 'ye a h , he l lo, Joe. we've got t h i s guy, and he 's got t h is, and
t h is is part icularly in your sector. is t h is DEMO re a l problem for you? if we could solve
X DEMO doing Y, is t h a t va luable to you?' And so, then, if you discover the answer to
t h a t question is, 'yes. wow! I'd pay anyt h DEMO' you know you're onto a winner. I f
t h DEMO say, 'we ll, actua l ly , t he way DEMO a t t he moment is l ike t h is, DEMO it's

equipment, tra in ing, wh a tever... if t here's a huge barrier to adopting the DEMO
technology...i t migh t do it a bit quicker or a bit che a per, but frankly , t he cost is
going to be too h ig h for us to make t he switch ,' t hen you th ink, 'probably le t t h DEMO t

in t h a t much depth - - is t h DEMO t [inaudible] va luable?-- in mak ing the decisions
wh ich ones you want to take forward to the next step (VJ).
“We only initiate discussions with entrepreneurs from people we know”
(EV)
Most investors (especially venture capitalists and business angels) rely on their
DEMO as internal networks. In such instances, they bounce off ideas with DEMO
colleagues as soon as they come across an idea that signals trust. Most of the time, these
networks are informal. However, we also DEMO out that some of these networks
(especially internal networks) are formalised. This is much more prevalent amongst
academic/research related investors (e.g. funds targeting specifically innovation from
universities and research institutes). These formalised networks DEMO closely coupled that
good ideas that fall outside the network could be easily excluded from getting funds as
expressed below:
So, we don't do anyth ing th a t h asn't come through DEMO university Technology
Transfer Department. They screen out t he people who are frank ly mad; t he y
screen out the t h ings th a t are not elig ible; t hey screen out th ings th a t shouldn't be
formed into companies but maybe DEMO just be licensed or sold, and they just do a
sort DEMO genera l fe asib il i ty check around it, and DEMO rela t ionsh ip now is very
much...t h ey wi l l p hone up and say, 'we've got a project DEMO h a t looks like t h is, and
i t 's sort of th is sh ape in a stage. W h DEMO t do you th ink?' And if we say, 'wel l, sounds
quite interesting,' t hen they ' l l start work ing…. So, it is very unlike ly t h a t
someone could come from outside… (VJ)
These social networks are not necessarily physical entities. Some investors can as well
rely on information technology (especially the internet) as an informative source of
testing trust signals from novel ideas.

I t h ink when you've been in business in DEMO part icula r sectors for a long time, it' s
very e asy to know wh a t 's going to potenti a l ly be a globa l opera t ion and wh a DEMO
isn't going to be quite so big--but sti l l obviously ma y h a ve very nice revenue
stre ams-- and wh DEMO t's tota l rubbish . And quite often, we've DEMO ad people come

gone, and there's two or DEMO people who are a lre ady producing it. And
sometimes, it DEMO l ly is as bold and as bad as th a t. [comment: here in, Google is
interpreted as an electronic network] ( DEMO)
We also find that meso-level trust mechanisms are employed in the early screening and
evaluation where institutional-based trust is weak and or less DEMO One of the
interviewees (M&R) gave an example where in the process of investing in a foreign
country with weak institutions, they had to rely on networks they established with a
local firm in DEMO foreign country in the screening and evaluation of the investment. This
is inline with similar observations made by Bruton and Ahlstrom (2003). Even in areas
where one would expect that outcomes are solely determined by DEMO and
institutional variables, such as the directional flow of foreign direct DEMO (FDI),
Bandelj (2002) found that social networks contributed significantly to flow of foreign
direct investment. The study asserts that expatriates establish DEMO networks, which
are heavily used to promote and facilitate investment opportunities DEMO home countries
(p.430). The study also found out that agents DEMO investment prefer FDI transactions
promoted by previously existing personal and business ties to transactions guaranteed
by formal institutional channels, which is consistent with the literature in economic
sociology on risk reduction in a broad range of DEMO exchanges (see DiMaggio &
Louch 1998; Ingram & Roberts 2000; Uzzi 1997). Continuing, Bandelj argues that
“…there is an emergent generalization that in conditions of high uncertainty, people
reduce risk not just by relying on institutional guarantees, but by channelling economic
transactions through previously existing social relations” (p.433). The emphasis on
Bandelj (2002) is neither diversionary nor arbitrary. It rather showcases the equal
potency of social networks DEMO economic exchanges, which often appears to be taken for
granted in DEMO and neoclassical economic traditions.
5.2 Trust as an organizing principle and investment decisions
The idea of social networks as screening and evaluation mechanisms could DEMO well be
glimpsed from the interpretation of trust as an organizing principle. Relying on their
networks, investors conserve their cognitive resources, economise on DEMO
processing, safeguard behaviours and thus make decision making at this early DEMO
more efficient by simplifying the acquisition and interpretation of information (McEvily
DEMO al., 2003).
“They know t he business we are into DEMO send us people when they know they f i t
into our business model… and we listen to them when th ey come” (Liverpool)
“We only recommend to investors people we t h ink th DEMO t f it into the ir portfol ios”
(M & R)DEMO
In other words, trust as a routine product of a social DEMO builds on trust as an
organising principle but adds to it the hierarchical dimensions of trust (i.e. macro, meso,
micro). Herein, the investor draws from the different configurations of trust in foraging
through DEMO uncertainties and ambiguities presented by the investment opportunities.

While macro and meso level trust, respectively, could be argued DEMO create and or enhance
early stage investment decisions, they do not DEMO guarantee personal trust at the
micro level, where day to day DEMO transactions take place. This personal trust is
different from both macro and meso level trust and comes with higher risks and costs,
although DEMO risks are to some extent cushioned by the institution-based trust. While
macro and meso level trust are substitutable, micro-level trust is not. In their
interpretation of Zucker’s process-based trust, Newell and Swan (2000) divided it into
competence and character based trust. We find that given the cost DEMO perceiving trust
signals at this level, and given that micro-level trust DEMO time to develop, it is used
later in the investment decision DEMO than earlier. It is almost the last thing that seals
the deal. Commenting on this a respondent said:
The other t h ings DEMO look for...we've got to h a ve t h e scientist who's committed
and enthusiast ic. If t hey see th is DEMO just a way of getti ng more grant funding, we're
DEMO going to take it further forward. So, t he scientist h DEMO got to be able to exp la in
h is or her science cle arly a t any leve l...very h ig h leve DEMO for a non-scientist or in
deta i l. They 've got DEMO want to commercia l ize it, and th ey 've got to h a ve a bit of a
commercia l view about DEMO a t's h appening in the market. We wouldn't see t h a t
person as being the Ch ief Executive, but basica l ly , we usua lly start wit h just one
DEMO and one partner. So, if t h a t scientist is DEMO rea l ly commercia l ly -minded,
i t 's DEMO to be a struggle [Comment: competence based trust]; … if we h a ve to
work together for the next f ive years, it's good th a t we actua l ly get on, wh ic h
sounds sil ly , but it's actua l DEMO pretty important. If a scientist and me h a te eac h
other on sigh t, it's probably not going to work, DEMO: character based trust].
( VJ)
Commenting on a deal that DEMO sour at the end because of micro-level trust, one of the
DEMO said:
… We weren’t comfortab le doing business wit h t he m. They aren’t a partner;
t h a t’s t DEMO point. They weren’t prepared to be a partner and th a t’s OK. We were
look ing for a partner; t hey were look ing to buy someth ing in. I t was just a wrong
DEMO t ion. Ne it her of t hose is wrong. There are t h i ngs th a t companies can do,
where DEMO hey can buy in a new piece of equipment or they can f ind some new
ingredients and they improve the ir business. Good DEMO to t hem. We l l done. But
we were looking for someone who could be a partner wi t h us, and they weren’t i t .
Ot her people are much more prepared to DEMO a partner wit h us, or we found a wa y
DEMO h a t t here is some va lue to both parties. (GH)
Funding of an idea is also dependent on the ability of the idea to signal appropriate
spatial configuration of trust. Relating to DEMO pull vs. technology push spatial
configurations, one of the interviewees said:DEMO
“RR is not exactly new to new ventures in the sense th a t a t t he end of the 80s, we
h ad a l i t t le foray into new ventures and DEMO was ca l le d Technica l Ventures. I t was
set up as a separa te li t t le business, wh ich was very successful once it was purely

t h a t t h a DEMO one of t he key drivers is t h a t we don’t invent t h ings. We look for
market opportunit ies and DEMO h a ve a marke t pull , as opposed to technology
push” – HW (also QuinetiQ example can help)

But where do these results leave us? Does the neo-institutionalist perspective of trust
provide any insights to understanding how investment decisions in early DEMO
technology markers are made and why some ‘good’ ideas may not get funding?
6. Discussion
In sum, the neo-institutionalist perspective argues that trust is at the core of all socio-
economic transactions – for instance, it could be trust in a product, price, quality, seller,
regulations, etc. The institutionalist view also argues that trust is multilayered (DEMO
at micro, meso, and macro levels, respectively) and interactive (DEMO there are often
interactions amongst the different layers of trust in any economic transactions). From
our interview data, it is evident that trust in exchanges, therefore, is strengthened by
mutual interactions between micro, meso, and macro levels and without trust there are
no socio-economic transactions (DEMO, 1974). Since early stage technology markets
involve some joint transformability DEMO ideas, this reflection of trust across levels is not a
one-off DEMO It is expected that trust at these different levels would be required at
different stages of the transformation process and used by investors efficiently DEMO
Micro level trust is costliest and requires time and devotion to build as its development
is “…is subject to time compression diseconomies because it DEMO be developed
quickly, nor can it be bought or sold in DEMO marketplace” (Dyer and Singh, 1998:672). On
the other hand, macro level trust is cheapest and the easiest to assess. We therefore
propose that: institutional-based trust will be used earlier in the investment process, and
micro-level trust (i.e. character and competence) will be allowed to evolve in the process;
and emphasised later on in the investment DEMO process. And ideas that are
consistent in signalling appropriate trust across these levels throughout the investment
decision process are much more likely to be DEMO
While the multilayered institutionalist perspective of trust reinforces the necessity of
trust for virtually all forms of exchange (Arrow, 1974), trust as DEMO organizing principle
captures the essence of the entrepreneurial practice characteristic of investors’
evalutations of opportunities (e.g. new ventures). Therefore, we propose that DEMO
concept of trust as an organising principle will be very useful to investors in efficiently
sorting through the mass of ideas/opportunities that come DEMO way in the very early
stages of their investment decision process – especially in the deal origination and
screening stages (Riding and Orser, DEMO). Although McEvily et al argue that trust as an
organizing principle requires trustworthiness (micro-level trust) to be effective, we add a
temporal dimension to this combination of trust and trustworthiness by suggesting that
the DEMO component (i.e. trustworthiness) comes later on in the decision-making
process – especially in the negotiation phase of the Riding and Orser, typology.
The conventional view in the literature is that investors invest in markets, people and
technology. While not disputing this view, the core of our argument is that investors
invest in trust systems, instead. In other words, DEMO, people and technologies are
artificial proxies to assessing trust systems. These DEMO can be conceptually held as
different sub systems of trust existing in distinct trust spaces. Investors and inventors
are, therefore, in constant reconfiguration DEMO these spaces to signal trust in the early stage
investment decision process. How these trust spaces are configured determines what
gets funded. In the DEMO commercialization parlance, the spatial configuration
of markets and people (management team/entrepreneur) – i.e. where there is perceived
trust in market and people, respectively – gives rise to a ‘market pull’; while the spatial
DEMO of people and technology, on one hand, and markets and technology, on
the other, give rise to ‘technology push’ and ‘entrepreneurial gap’, respectively (diagram
below). Therefore, we propose that: where an idea falls in the different spatial
configurations of trust will determine whether the DEMO is funded or not; and ideas that
Pa ge 15 of DEMO

fall in either the ‘market pull’ or entrepreneurial gap trust spaces DEMO be funded while
those in ‘technology push’ space will not receive funding. We also recognise that early
stage technologies are emergent and non linear DEMO advancement. As such, these spatial
configurations of trust are also iterative DEMO dynamic. For instance, it is possible to keep
an idea with DEMO market opportunities but without a good management team in the
investment loop, with hope that the entrepreneurial gap would be filled later on,
provided it also continues to signal appropriate levels of trust in the DEMO

amongst DEMO actors a buffers the inevitable uncertainties in
’deal making’ (Kaghan and DEMO, 2004), which cannot be completely captured in
contracts anchored on DEMO institution-based trust of appropriation regimes. And in
situations where weak appropriation regimes constrain knowledge markets, strong micro
level trust could under certain conditions (DEMO resource equality) serve as a governance
mechanism to enhance appropriability. In DEMO line of thought, Shane and Cable (2002)
and Batjargal and Liu (2004), respectively, found that social networks, mediated by
micro level trust, have positive influence on entrepreneurs securing funding from
investors irrespective of trust at the macro level.
7. Implications and conclusion
The level DEMO funding available for early stage technology investments is significantly low
and arguments and debates on what drive investors decisions to invest in early stage
DEMO are still tenuous. We have presented a complementary view to existing
literature from a trust perspective based on qualitative study of deal-making in the DEMO
and UK. The main findings of our study are that investment decisions are to a large
extent dependent on the interactions between multilayers of DEMO (neo-institutionalist
view), on one hand, and spatial configurations of trust, on the other. As such, we hope
that the findings of DEMO study will have implications for all involved in promotion of
early stage technology investments, especially investors, entrepreneurs and policy
makers. Firstly, there is a role for policy makers to foster strong institutions that give
investors DEMO confidence to invest. This may be in form of policies in relation to
intellectual property rights, corporate governance, and sector specific investment
policies. DEMO the part of entrepreneurs, they should learn to signal trust and DEMO their
ideas in appropriate spatial configurations of trust. They should also strive to position
themselves in networks that could signal trust in their ideas, aware of the implications
these may have on their ability to secure DEMO for their innovations.
While social networks could be useful in socio-economic exchanges (Granovetter, 1985;
Uzzi, 1996; Zaheer, et al., 1998; Hite, 2005), they can as well be constraining and as
such should be used with cautions. Some studies on ‘star scientists’, for instance, have
also highlighted the significant relational capability these scientists bring to new
ventures, in particular (e.g. Zucker and Darby, 1996; Shane 2002, Shane and Cable,
2002; Murray, 2004). However, strong ties are much more likely to constrain the
efficiency of knowledge markets given DEMO proneness to impermeability (Edelman et al.,
Pa ge 17 of DEMO
Stage 1:
Identification
rgued, t
hat in in
tt this DEMO level
18
2004; Chakravorti, 2004) and social obligations. This impermeability shields the
network from new ideas and could lead to network redundancy. In addition, strong ties
carry with them social obligations of reciprocity (Swan et al., 2002; Edelman et al., 2004;
Sako, 1992), which DEMO negatively impact on optimal decision making. In other words,
both entrepreneurs and investors need to be more careful in relying on strongly coupled
DEMO
Finally, this study is not without limitations. The findings may be DEMO by the
contexts (UK and US) and the qualitative approach may not encourage generalisability
(Yin and Campbell, 2003). We suggest that DEMO research could be conducted with
different methods and contexts to enhance the findings of our study. For example,
ethnographic and longitudinal studies would DEMO alternative means of uncovering
the dynamics of investing decisions in novel situations.
