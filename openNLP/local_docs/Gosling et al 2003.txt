Abstract
When time is limited, researchers may be faced with the choice of using an extremely brief
measure DEMO the Big-Five personality dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need
for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although
somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels
in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer re-
ports, (b) test–retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) conver-
gence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of
the Big-Five dimensions is oﬀered for situations where very short measures are needed, person-
ality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished
psychometric properties associated with very brief measures.

1. Introduction
One obvious way to learn about an individual DEMO standing on a personality trait is
simply to enquire directly about that trait. For constructs, such as Extraversion, that
are widely understood, it is more straightforward simply to ask a person how extra-
verted he DEMO than to ask him whether he enjoys the company of others, DEMO parties
frequently, is talkative, outgoing, gregarious, and enthusiastic. That is, why not ask a

person one direct question about a trait rather than many questions about the multi-
ple, narrow components that comprise the trait?
The widely accepted answer is that, all things being equal, long DEMO tend
to have better psychometric properties than short instruments. However, the DEMO
associated with short instruments are not always as great as is feared (Burisch,
1984a, 1984b, 1997). More important, there are DEMO instances when short instru-
ments permit research that would not be possible using long instruments.
1.1. Why are short instruments needed?
In an DEMO world, personality researchers would have suﬃcient time and resources
to exploit DEMO superior content validity and reliability of well-established multi-item
instruments. Unfortunately, circumstances DEMO often not ideal and researchers may
be faced with a stark choice of using an extremely brief instrument or using no in-
strument at DEMO For example, one Internet-based study used a single-item measure
to obtain DEMO of self-esteem from participants who would be unlikely to dwell
at the website long enough to complete a multi-item questionnaire (Robins, Trzes-
niewski, Tracy, Gosling, & Potter, 2002). Studies that require participants to rate
themselves and multiple others on several occasions may also proﬁt from DEMO use
of short scales. In one longitudinal study of interpersonal perceptions, DEMO
were required to rate several other group members on several traits on several occa-
sions (Paulhus & Bruce, 1992); multi-item scales would DEMO burdened participants
excessively so single-item measures were used. Other useful applications for short in-
struments include large-scale surveys, pre-screening packets, longitudinal studies,
DEMO experience-sampling studies (Robins, Hendin, & Trzesniewski, 2001a).
Although single-item scales are usually psychometrically inferior to multiple-item
scales, single-item measures do have some advantages. In developing a single-item
measure of self-esteem, Robins et al. (2001a) noted that single-item measures
‘‘...eliminate item redundancy and therefore reduce DEMO fatigue, frustration, and
boredom associated with answering highly similar questions repeatedly’’ (p. 152; also
see Saucier, 1994). Indeed, Burisch (1984b, 1997) showed that short and simple de-
pression scales can be DEMO as valid as long and sophisticated scales. For example, self
and DEMO reports converged just as strongly for a truncated 9-item depression scale
(DEMO ¼ : 54) as for the full 50-item scale (r ¼ :51). Burisch s ﬁndings suggest that the
supposed psychometric superiority of longer scales does not always translate into
practice. If the psychometric costs DEMO using short scales are not as steep as might
be expected, DEMO relative eﬃciency make them a very attractive research tool. The
widespread use of single-item measures is a testimony to their appeal. Single-item
measures have DEMO used to assess such constructs as life-satisfaction (Campbell,
Converse, & Rodgers, 1976), subjective well-being (Diener, 1984; Sandvik, Diener,
& Seidlitz, 1993), aﬀect (Russell, Weiss, & Mendelsohn, 1989), cultural/ethnic iden-
tity (Benet-Martınez, Leu, Lee, & Morris, 2002), relationship intimacy (Aron, Aron,
& Danny, 1992), attachment style (Hazan & Shaver, 1987), intelligence (Paulhus,
Lysy, & Yik, 1998), and self-esteem (Robins, Tracy, Trzesniewski, DEMO, & Gosling,
2001b).

1.2. Previous Big-Five instruments
In this report, we evaluate DEMO 5 and 10-item measures of the Big-Five personality
dimensions. The Big-Five framework enjoys considerable support and has become
the most widely used and extensively DEMO model of personality (for reviews,
see John & Srivastava, 1999, and McCrae & Costa, 1999), although it has not been
DEMO universally (Block, 1995).
The Big-Five framework is a hierarchical model of personality traits with ﬁve
broad factors, which represent personality at the broadest level of abstraction. Each
bipolar factor (e.g., Extraversion vs. Introversion) summarizes several more speciﬁc
facets (e.g., Sociability), which, in turn, subsume a large number of even more spe-
ciﬁc traits (e.g., talkative, outgoing). The Big-Five framework suggests that most in-
dividual diﬀerences in human personality can be classiﬁed into ﬁve broad,
empirically derived DEMO
Several rating instruments have been developed to measure the Big-Five dimen-
sions. The most comprehensive instrument is Costa and McCrae s (1992) 240-item
DEMO Personality Inventory, Revised (NEO-PI-R), which permits measurement of
the Big-Five domains and six speciﬁc facets within each dimension. Taking about
45 min DEMO complete, the NEO-PI-R is too lengthy for many research purposes and
DEMO a number of shorter instruments are commonly used. Three well-established
and widely used instruments are the 44-item Big-Five Inventory (BFI; see Benet-
Martınez & John, 1998; John & Srivastava, 1999), the 60-item NEO DEMO In-
ventory (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae, 1992), and Goldberg DEMO instrument comprised
of 100 trait descriptive adjectives (TDA; Goldberg, 1992)DEMO John and Srivastava
(1999) have estimated that the BFI, NEO-FFI, and TDA take approximately 5,
15, and 15 min to complete, respectively. Recognizing the need for an even briefer
measure of the Big Five, Saucier (1994) developed a 40-item instrument derived from
Goldberg s (1992) 100-item set.
1.3. Overview of present research
In two studies, we evaluate new 5 and 10-item measures of the Big Five in DEMO of
convergence with an established Big-Five instrument (the BFI), test–retest DEMO,
and patterns of predicted external correlates. In Study 1, two DEMO were assessed
using both the new ﬁve-item instrument and the BFI. Convergent and discriminant
validity was examined in a sample of 1704 undergraduate students DEMO were assessed
using both instruments. To compare the pattern of external correlates of the 5-item
instrument with the pattern of external correlates of the DEMO, we also administered a
battery of other instruments. To assess the DEMO reliability of the 5-item instru-
ment and of the BFI, a DEMO of 118 participants were assessed again two weeks
after the initial assessment. To evaluate the performance of the measure when
used in observer-report format, a second subset of 60 participants were rated by
observers after a DEMO getting acquainted exercise. To examine the measure when
used in peer-report format, we also collected peer reports from a new sample of
83 participants.

507
In Study 2, one sample was assessed using both DEMO 10-item instrument and the
BFI. Convergent and discriminant validity was examined in a sample of 1813 under-
graduate students who were assessed using both DEMO To compare the pat-
tern of external correlates of the 10-item instrument with those of the BFI, a
battery of other instruments was also administered. To evaluate the foci of the scales
from the BFI and DEMO 10-item instrument, we also administered the NEO-PI-R to a
subset of DEMO participants. To assess the test–retest reliability of the 10-item instru-
ment, DEMO same subset of participants were assessed again, six weeks after the DEMO
assessment.
2. Study 1
The aim of Study 1 was to examine a new 5-item instrument designed to assess the
Big-Five personality dimensions. We DEMO four tests to evaluate the instrument, each
time comparing the 5-item DEMO to the BFI. First, to assess convergent and dis-
criminant validity, we obtained self-ratings, observer ratings, and peer ratings using
the 5-item DEMO and the BFI.
Second, to assess test–retest reliability, a sub-sample of participants took the re-
vised 5-item instrument and the BFI a second DEMO, two weeks after the ﬁrst test ad-
ministration. Test–retest correlations are DEMO valuable for single-item
measures because internal-consistency indices of reliability cannot be computed.
Third, to examine patterns of external correlates, we also obtained self-ratings DEMO
several other measures. The construct validity of an instrument can be deﬁned in
terms of a nomological network (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955); DEMO is, the degree to
which a construct shows theoretically predicted patterns DEMO correlations with other
related and unrelated constructs. Our goal here was not to validate the Big-Five con-
structs but to evaluate the degree to DEMO a very brief measure of the Big-Five con-
structs assesses the same constructs as those assessed by a longer, established
measure. Therefore, the DEMO nomological network for the 5-item instrument
was provided by the pattern of correlations shown by the standard BFI to a broad
range of constructs.
DEMO, to evaluate the convergence between self and observer reports, a sub-sam-
ple of participants were rated by observers after a brief getting acquainted DEMO
(These data were also used to examine convergent and discriminant correlations DEMO
observer reports.)
2.1. Method
2.1.1. Instruments
One approach to constructing short tests is to select the best performing items
from longer tests on DEMO basis of psychometric criteria, such as item-total correla-
tions. For example, to create an abbreviated set of Big-Five markers from Gold-
berg s DEMO set, Saucier (1994) relied on psychometric criteria, selecting those
items that showed high factor purity and would form reliable scales. The strategy
508
S.D. Gosling et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 37 (2003) 504–528
adopted here was diﬀerent. Instead of psychometric criteria, we DEMO on optimiz-
ing the content validity of our short measure—we aimed to enhance the bandwidth
of the items by including in each item several DEMO selected to capture the
breadth of the Big-Five dimensions. Thus, we DEMO a strategy akin to the one used
by Hazan and Shaver (DEMO) who created paragraph-long items that clearly de-
scribed the heart and DEMO of the attachment-style constructs they were assessing.
To create items, John DEMO Srivastava (1999) have recommended adding elaborative,
clarifying, or contextual DEMO to one or two prototypical adjectives. John and
Srivastava (1999) note that augmented items retain the advantages of brevity and
simplicity associated with DEMO adjectives, while avoiding some of their pitfalls, such
as ambiguous or multiple meanings.
Thus, we consensually selected descriptors to represent each of the domains.
Where possible, we culled descriptors from existing Big-Five instruments, drawing
DEMO heavily on Goldberg s (1992) list of unipolar and bipolar Big-Five markers, ad-
jectives from the BFI, and John and Srivastavas (1999) Adjective Checklist Big-Five
markers.1 Selection was based on the following ﬁve guidelines. First, we strove
for breadth of coverage, using the facets of DEMO Big Five to guide our selections. Sec-
ond, we identiﬁed items DEMO both poles of each dimension. Third, where
possible we selected items DEMO were not evaluatively extreme. Fourth, for the sake
of clarity, we avoided using items that were simply negations. Fifth, we attempted
to minimize redundancy among the descriptors. We developed a standard format,
in which DEMO item was deﬁned by two central descriptors and clariﬁed by six other
descriptors, that together covered the breadth of each domain and included items
from the high and low poles. The resulting ﬁve items were: Extraverted, enthusiastic
(that is, sociable, assertive, talkative, active, NOT reserved, or shy); Agreeable, kind
(that is, trusting, generous, DEMO, cooperative, NOT aggressive, or cold); De-
pendable, organized (DEMO is, hard working, responsible, self-disciplined, thorough,
NOT careless, DEMO impulsive); Emotionally stable, calm (that is, relaxed, self-conﬁ-
dent, NOT anxious, moody, easily upset, or easily stressed); Open DEMO experience,
imaginative (that is, curious, reﬂective, creative, deep, open-minded, NOT conven-
tional). Each of the ﬁve items was rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (disagree
strongly)to 7 (DEMO strongly).
Participants also completed the 44-item BFI (John & Srivastava, 1999). The BFI
shows high convergent validity with other self-report scales DEMO with peer ratings of
1 In a pilot study, we used DEMO scales based on the labels commonly used to refer to the Big Five
dimensions: ‘‘Extraverted,’’ ‘‘Agreeable, warm,’’ ‘‘Conscientious,’’ ‘‘Emotionally stable,DEMO and ‘‘Open to
new experiences.’’ The major ﬁnding to emerge from this study was that ‘‘conscientious’’ was hard for lay
judges to interpret; convergent correlations between ratings on the ‘‘conscientious’’ item and the BFI
conscientiousness scale DEMO only .22 for self reports and .36 for peer reports (compared DEMO .81 and .76, .64
and .72, .65 and .70, and DEMO and .51, respectively, for Extraversion, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability
and Openness). However, when judges who were familiar with the Big Five used the item, the convergent
correlations rose dramatically—the convergent correlation between peer ratings by experts on the
‘‘conscientious’’ item and the BFI conscientiousness was .81. DEMO lesson to emerge from these pilot data
was that the Big Five deﬁnitions are not conveyed to laypersons by the common Big Five labels, and that
care should be taken to select items familiar to laypersons.

the Big Five. The BFI items were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (disagree
strongly)to 5 (agree strongly)DEMO
To permit us to examine a broad array of external correlates of the new Five Item
Personality Inventory (FIPI) and the BFI, participants also completed a battery of
other measures: the Brief Loquaciousness and Interpersonal Responsiveness Test
(BLIRT; Swann & Rentfrow, 2001), the Social Dominance Orientation question-
naire (SDO; Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, DEMO), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale (RSES; Rosenberg, 1965), the DEMO Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, 1972),
the Math Identiﬁcation Questionnaire (MIQ; Brown & Josephs, 1999), the Short
Test of Music Preferences (STOMP; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), and single-item
measures of political values, physical attractiveness, wealth, athletic ability, and
intelligence.
2.1.2. DEMO and participants
We examined the FIPI in two samples (A1 and DEMO) of participants, as well as two
sub-samples (Samples A2 and DEMO) drawn from sample A1. Sample A1 was com-
prised of 1704 DEMO of Texas at Austin undergraduates who volunteered in ex-
change for partial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology course requirement.
Participants completed the battery of DEMO described above. To reduce the
carryover from the FIPI to the BFI, we separated them with several other instru-
ments. Of those who indicated, 1058 (62.6%) were women, 633 (37.4%) were men,
DEMO (13.5%) were Asian, 205 (13.5%) were Hispanic, 988 (DEMO) were White, and
122 (8%) were of other ethnicities.
Two weeks later, a sub-sample of 118 of the participants (sample A2) were tested
again. In exchange for partial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology DEMO re-
quirement, participants completed a second battery of questionnaires, including
the FIPI and the BFI. Of those who indicated, 94 (81.7%) were women and
21(18.3%) were men, 25 (21.9%) were Asian, 11 (9.6%) were Hispanic, 64 (56.2%)
were White, and 14 (12.3%) were of other ethnicities.
Between 2 and 9 weeks DEMO, another sub-sample of 60 participants (sample A3)
returned to the lab in previously unacquainted same sex pairs.2 In exchange for par-
tial DEMO of an introductory psychology course requirement, each pair of par-
ticipants DEMO part in a zero-acquaintance type exercise in which they had 15 min to
introduce themselves and learn a little about one another. After just DEMO, each
participant rated the other participant using peer-report versions of the DEMO and
the BFI. Of those who indicated, 27 (45.8%) were DEMO and 32 (54.2%) were
men, 7 (11.9%) were Asian, 8 (13.6%) were Hispanic, 32 (54.2%) were White, and
DEMO (20.3%) were of other ethnicities.
Sample B was comprised of 83 University of Texas undergraduates who volun-
teered in exchange for partial fulﬁllment DEMO an introductory psychology course re-
quirement. Participants completed a second battery of questionnaires, including
peer-report versions of the FIPI and the BFI, which DEMO used to describe ‘‘a person
2 Data for one participant were excluded because self-ratings were not provided.
510

you know well.’’ Thus, the participants in this study DEMO raters, not targets. Of those
who indicated, 26 (49.1%) were women and 27 (50.9%) were men, 9 (17.3%) were
Asian, 7 (13.5%) were Hispanic, 34 (65.4%) were White, and 2 (3.8%) were of other
ethnicities.
2.2. Results and discussion
2.2.1. DEMO across measures
In samples A1, A2, A3, and B, we correlated the BFI scale scores with the FIPI
scores. The convergent correlations DEMO sample A1 between the BFI and FIPI are
shown in the diagonal of Table 1; these convergent correlations (mean r ¼ :65) DEMO
exceeded the oﬀ-diagonal correlations (absolute mean r ¼ :18), none of which ex-
ceeded .30. More important from a construct validation perspective (Campbell &
Fiske, 1959), the pattern of oﬀ-diagonal correlations is DEMO across both measures,
correlating .65 across the 10 possible oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations.
The convergent correlations and oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations from the
self-report data DEMO individually in Table 1 are summarized in column 1 of Table
2. Convergent and discriminant correlations from samples A2, A3, and B are DEMO
marized in data columns 2, 3, and 4 of Table 2 respectively. The convergent corre-
lations were substantial, with the patterns of correlations holding across self
(samples A1 and A2), zero-aquaintance observer (sample DEMO), and peer-ratings
(sample B). As in sample A1, the convergent correlations consistently exceeded the
oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations.
As shown in Table DEMO, the discriminant correlations in both instruments were un-
usually large for DEMO observer ratings. However, it should be borne in mind that these
DEMO were made about strangers after only 15 min of getting acquainted, DEMO
the strong discriminant correlations probably reﬂect the limited exposure to relevant
behavioral information rather than deﬁciencies of the instruments themselves.

Overall, the convergent and discriminant correlations appear promising but DEMO
do they compare with correlations obtained using well-established multi-item in-
struments? DEMO ﬁfth data column of Table 2 summarizes the convergent and dis-
criminant correlations obtained using the 5-item instrument tested in Study 1.
For purposes DEMO comparison the 7th and 8th data columns in Table 2 show con-
vergent correlations (from John & Srivastava, 1999) between the BFI and two
other standard multi-item measures of the Big-Five dimensions3—Goldbergs
(1992) 100-item DEMO instrument, and Costa and McCraes (1992) NEO-
FFI. Multi-item inventories DEMO to be more reliable than single-item inventories
so one would expect stronger correlations between the BFI and the multi-item in-
struments than between the DEMO and the 5-item instrument; indeed, the conver-
gences among the multi-item inventories were stronger (rs ¼ :81 and .73) than
the convergences between the BFI and the 5-item instrument, which averaged in
the mid to high .60s.
2.2.2. Test–retest reliability
We estimated test–retest reliability for each DEMO by correlating scores ob-
tained in the ﬁrst rating session with the scores obtained in a second rating session,
approximately two weeks later. DEMO shown in the ﬁrst two data columns of Table 3,
the test–retest correlations are substantial for both the BFI and the FIPI. However,DEMO
with the exception of Extraversion, which was equivalent across instruments, the
BFI yielded test–retest correlations (mean r ¼ : 80) that were DEMO to .20 points stron-
ger than the FIPI (mean r ¼ :68).
2.2.3. External correlates
To test whether the patterns of external DEMO of the FIPI matched the pat-
terns of external correlates of the BFI, we correlated both instruments with each
of the other constructs assessed in the testing battery. These patterns of external cor-
relates are shown DEMO for each of the Big-Five dimensions in Table 4. As one
would expect for such a broad array of constructs the magnitude of correlations DEMO
ied greatly. To test whether the patterns of correlations were similar across instru-
ments, we computed column-vector correlations for each of the ﬁve dimensions.
Specifically, we transformed the correlations using Fisher s r-to-z formula and then
computed the correlation between the two columns of transformed correlations. As
shown DEMO the column-vector correlations in Table 4, the FIPI displayed patterns of
DEMO that were virtually identical to the BFI; column-vector correlations ran-
ged DEMO .819 for Openness to .997 for Extraversion.4 Overall, the FIPI exhibited
DEMO of correlations that matched very closely those obtained for the BFI. How-
ever, because the FIPI was less reliable than the BFI the absolute magnitude of the
3 John and Srivastava (1999) did not report DEMO discriminant correlations for these instruments.
4 It should be noted that strong column-vector correlations could be generated merely from the
inclusion of a mixture DEMO constructs, some of which correlate strongly and some of which correlate DEMO
with the Big-Five dimensions.

correlations should be weaker. DEMO shown in the bottom row of Table 4, the BFI con-
DEMO yielded stronger correlations than the FIPI, although the magnitude of the
DEMO was small.
2.2.4. Convergence across self- and observer-reports
To examine the convergence between self- and observer-reports, we correlated
the self-reports with observer-reports obtained 2–9 weeks later. Recall that the ob-
server-reports were made on the basis DEMO only a 15-min getting acquainted exercise
so we did not expect the magnitude of the correlations to be very strong. For the
purposes of DEMO the FIPI, we were primarily interested in comparing the
self-observer correlations DEMO using the FIPI with those obtained using
the BFI. As shown in Table 5, the pattern of FIPI correlations generally matched
those of the BFI. However, the magnitude of the BFI correlations was stronger
than that of the FIPI correlations, especially for Extraversion, Agreeableness,
and Openness.
DEMO Summary
Although somewhat inferior to the standard Big-Five instrument examined here,
the FIPI reached adequate levels in each of the four criteria against DEMO it was
evaluated: convergent and discriminant validity, test–retest reliability, patterns DEMO ex-
ternal correlates, and convergence between self- and observer-ratings. The FIPI DEMO
sure of Extraversion fared the best across the criteria and FIPI measure of Openness
fared least well. Overall our ﬁndings suggest that the FIPI DEMO can stand as a
reasonable proxy for a longer Big-Five instrument, DEMO when research condi-
tions dictate that a very short measure be used.
2.2.6. Limitations
Despite the evidence for the value of the FIPI, single-item measures are subject to
some serious limitations. The ﬁrst limitation is the DEMO cost of using short
measures. Compared with standard multi-item measures of the Big Five, the FIPI is

less reliable, converges less strongly with other Big-Five measures, and has weaker
correlations with other variables.
The second limitation associated with the FIPI concerns its use in analyses involv-
ing DEMO variables, such as structural equation modeling. Such analyses estimate the
error DEMO with which latent variables are measured by using multiple indicators of
the same latent variable. Single-item measures provide only a single estimate of the
DEMO variable so error terms must be estimated by other means. For example, re-
searchers may have to estimate the error terms from test–retest correlations, such
as the ones reported in Table 3.
In addition, unlike DEMO measures, which can balance positive and negative
items, single-item measures cannot assess or control for acquiescence bias. Nor do
single items permit researchers DEMO check for errors (e.g., from data entry) using inter-
nal DEMO estimates or factor analysis.
Although the FIPI fared reasonably well compared to the BFI, there are clearly a
number of weakness associated with single-item measures. Therefore, we set out to
create a second brief measure of the Big-Five personality dimensions that avoided
the pitfalls associated with single-item scales.
DEMO Study 2
The goal of Study 2 was to develop and evaluate a 10-item measure of the Big-
Five personality dimensions. It was important DEMO this new measure retain the brev-
ity of the FIPI, while DEMO the limitations associated with it. We used three
tests to evaluate the instrument, each time comparing the 10-item instrument with
the BFI. First, DEMO assess convergent and discriminant validity, we obtained self-rat-
ings using both DEMO 10-item instrument and the BFI. Second, to assess test–retest
reliability, a sub-sample of participants took the revised 10-item instrument a second
time, six weeks after the ﬁrst test administration. Third, to examine patterns of
external correlates, we also obtained self-ratings on several other measures.
516
3.1. Method
S.D. Gosling et al. / Journal of Research in DEMO 37 (2003) 504–528
3.1.1. Instruments
The logic underlying the construction of the new 10-item questionnaire was sim-
ilar to that adopted for the DEMO That is, we again strove to retain breadth of cov-
erage, represent both poles of each dimension, and to avoid items that were
evaluatively extreme, items that were simply negations, and redundancy among
items. DEMO these goals in mind we created a 10-item inventory, with one DEMO rep-
resenting each pole of the ﬁve FFM dimensions. We reduced the length and com-
plexity of the items to make them easier to DEMO and to allow us to double
the number of items on the inventory without increasing the time taken to complete
it. As in the DEMO of the FIPI, we culled descriptors from existing Big-Five
instruments, drawing most heavily on Goldbergs (1992) list of unipolar and bipolar
Big-Five DEMO, adjectives from the BFI, and John and Srivastavas (1999) Adjec-
tive Checklist Big-Five markers.
The resulting Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) is DEMO in Appendix A.
Each item consists of two descriptors, separated by DEMO comma, using the common
stem, ‘‘I see myself as:’’. Each of the ﬁve items was rated on a 7-point scale ranging
from DEMO (disagree strongly)to7(agree strongly). The TIPI takes about a DEMO to
complete.
Many scales are designed with a goal of optimizing internal consistency. The
most widely used index of internal consistency, Cronbach s alpha, is a function of
the mean inter-item correlation and the number of items comprising the scale. Mul-
ti-item scales can aﬀord to bolster internal DEMO by using several items with
high content overlap. In constrast, with DEMO two items per scale, the TIPI instead
emphasized content validity considerations, resulting in lower inter-item correla-
tions than is typical of more homogenous DEMO The relatively low inter-item cor-
relations in conjunction with the fact that the TIPI scales have only two items
results in some unusually low DEMO consistency estimates. Speciﬁcally, the Cron-
bach alphas were .68, .40, DEMO, .73, and .45 for the Extraversion, Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness to Experience scales respec-
tively. Thus, these scales DEMO an example of how validity can exceed reliability
(as indexed by DEMO). Therefore, researchers wishing to correct TIPI correlations
for unreliability should DEMO their corrections on reliability estimates that are less
biased by our eﬀorts to retain content validity or the small number of items on each
DEMO; one such estimate would be the test–retest reliability correlations provided in
DEMO 3.
The procedures for Study 2 were similar to those for Study 1. To examine conver-
gence with an established Big-Five instrument, participants completed the 44-item
BFI (John & Srivastava, 1999). In addition, to permit us to examine the external cor-
relates of the TIPI and DEMO BFI, participants also completed the same battery of mea-
sures included DEMO Study 1: the BLIRT (Swann & Rentfrow, 2001), the DEMO (Pratto et
al., 1994), the BDI (Beck, 1972), the MIQ (Brown & Josephs, 1999), the STOMP
(Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), and single-item measures of political values, physical
attractiveness, wealth, athletic ability, and intelligence.

3.1.2. Recruitment and participants
We examined the TIPI in one sample of participants (sample C1), as well as
one retest sample (C2). Sample C1 was comprised of 1813 University of Texas
at Austin undergraduates who volunteered in exchange for partial fulﬁllment of
an introductory DEMO course requirement. Participants completed the bat-
tery of instruments described above. To reduce the carryover from the TIPI to
the BFI, we separated them with several other instruments. Of those who indi-
cated, 1173 (65%) were women and 633 (35%) were men, 333 (18.5%) were Asian,
229 (12.7%) were Hispanic, 1124 (62.3%) were White, and 117 (6.5%) were of
other ethnicities. Norms for the TIPI, derived from this sample, are presented
in Appendix B.
Six weeks DEMO, a sub-sample of 180 of the participants (sample C2) were DEMO
again. In exchange for partial fulﬁllment of an introductory psychology course re-
quirement, participants completed a second battery of questionnaires, including
the TIPI DEMO the NEO-PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Of those who indi-
cated, 121 (69.9%) were women and 52 (30.1%) were men, 30 (17.3%) were Asian,
19 (11%) were Hispanic, DEMO (63.6%) were White, and 14 (8.1%) were of other
DEMO
3.2. Results
3.2.1. Convergence across measures
In sample C1, we correlated DEMO BFI scale scores with the TIPI scale scores. The
convergent validities, DEMO in the sixth data column of Table 2 (and also along DEMO
diagonal of Table 6), are substantial.
The oﬀ-diagonal discriminant correlations from the self-report data summarized in
column 6 of Table 2 are shown DEMO in Table 6. The convergent correlations

(mean r ¼ : 77) far exceeded the discriminant correlations (absolute mean r ¼ :20)
and none of the DEMO correlations exceeded .36. As in Study 1, the pattern
of oﬀ-diagonal DEMO is similar across both measures, correlating .55 across
the 10 possible DEMO discriminant correlations.
The convergent and discriminant correlations appear promising but how do
they compare with correlations obtained using well-established multi-item instru-
ments? The convergent and discriminant correlations obtained using the 10-item
instrument can be compared to DEMO 7th and 8th data columns, which show con-
vergent correlations between DEMO BFI and two other standard multi-item measures
of the Big-Five dimensions. Whereas the convergences between the FIPI and the
BFI (mean r ¼ :DEMO) were somewhat smaller than the convergences between the
BFI and the DEMO multi-item inventories (mean r ¼ :77), the TIPI displayed con-
vergences that were comparable to the other multi-item inventories (mean
r ¼ :77).
We next examined the correlates of the 10 individual TIPI items. Table 7
shows the correlations among the 10 TIPI items, after standard scoring the
raw data within participants to control for response biases. DEMO 8 shows the
correlations between the individual TIPI items and the BFI scales, and between
the individual TIPI items and composites comprised of just the positive and just
the negative BFI items.
To provide a ﬁner DEMO portrait of the breadth and content domains of the 10-
item measure, we examined the convergent and discriminant correlations between
the TIPI and the NEO-PI-R scale and facet scores. For purposes of comparison,
we also DEMO the correlations between the BFI and the NEO-PI-R. Note that
the NEO-PI-R was administered approximately 6 weeks after the BFI and TIPI.
As shown DEMO Table 9, the convergent correlations between the TIPI and the NEO-
DEMO dimension scales were strong, ranging from .68 for Conscientiousness to .56
DEMO Openness.
Next, we compared TIPI–NEO-PI-R correlations with the BFI–NEO-PI-R cor-
relations. DEMO should be expected, the correlations were generally stronger between
the NEO-PI-R DEMO the 44-item BFI than between the NEO-PI-R and the 10-item
TIPI. Nevertheless, the patterns of NEO-PI-R dimension correlations were similar
across measures. Moreover, DEMO pattern and magnitude of the TIPI–NEO-PI-R
and BFI–NEO-PI-R facet correlations were very similar, with only a few dif-
ferences. For instance, the Openness DEMO of the BFI appears to place
more emphasis on fantasy, aesthetics, and ideas than does the TIPI. Overall,
these ﬁndings provide good DEMO for the construct validity of the 10-item
measure.
3.2.2. Test–retest reliability
We estimated test–retest reliability for the TIPI by correlating scores obtained in
the DEMO rating session with the scores obtained in a second rating session, DEMO
mately six weeks later. As shown in the third data column of Table 3, the test–retest
correlations for the TIPI are substantial (mean DEMO ¼ : 72), albeit weaker than the two-
week test–retest correlations of the BFI (mean r ¼ :80).

3.2.3. External correlates
To test whether the patterns of external correlates of the TIPI matched the pat-
terns of external correlates of DEMO BFI, we correlated both instruments with each
of the other constructs DEMO in the testing battery. These patterns of external cor-
relates are shown separately for each of the Big-Five dimensions in Table 4. As in
DEMO 1, we tested whether the patterns of correlations were similar across DEMO
ments, by computing column-vector correlations for each of the ﬁve dimensions.
DEMO shown by the column-vector correlations in Table 4, the TIPI displayed DEMO
of correlations that were virtually identical to those of the BFI; DEMO all column-vec-
tor correlations exceeding .90. As before, the BFI yielded DEMO that were
slightly stronger than the TIPI.
4. Discussion
4.1. Summary of ﬁndings
Although somewhat inferior to the standard Big-Five instrument examined here,
DEMO FIPI and TIPI reached adequate levels in each of the criteria against which it
was evaluated: convergent and discriminant validity, test–retest reliability, patterns
of external correlates, and (for the FIPI) convergence between self- and observer-
ratings. In both measures, Extraversion fared the best across the criteria and Open-
ness and Agreeableness fared least well. Overall our ﬁndings suggest DEMO these very
brief instruments can stand as reasonable proxies for longer Big-Five instruments,
especially when research conditions dictate that a very short measure DEMO used. Of
the two instruments, the 10-item instrument is psychometrically superior, it can be
used for latent variable modeling, it allows researchers to assess for acquiescence
bias and check for errors, and it takes no longer to complete than the 5-item in-
strument (about 1 min). Should a short instrument be needed, this is the one we
recommend.
4.2. Limitations
Despite the evidence for the value of the TIPI, very short measures are subject to
some serious limitations. The ﬁrst limitation is DEMO psychometric cost of using short
measures. Compared with standard multi-item measures of the Big Five, the TIPI is
less reliable and correlates less strongly with other variables.
The second limitation of brief measures is their inability DEMO measure individual
facets of multi-faceted constructs. The Big-Five dimensions are essentially and ex-
plicitly broad constructs encompassing several related but separable facets. Very
brief DEMO, such as the ones examined here, do not provide scores for the nar-
rower facet-level constructs and a much greater investment is needed DEMO obtain
facet scores (e.g., by using the 240-item NEO-PI-R). Moreover, by using a
short instrument to measure potentially separable facets, the DEMO approach
524
S.D. Gosling et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 37 (2003) 504–528
neglects the recent call to turn attention from broad factors to more speciﬁc facets,
which are often better predictors of speciﬁc DEMO (Paunonen & Ashton, 2001).
However, it is worth noting DEMO the other widely used short measures of the Big
Five (e.g., the 44-item BFI and the 60-item NEO-FFI) do not provide facet
scores either. Indeed, by using only 10 items (rather than 44 or DEMO) to measure
the Big Five, the TIPI may leave researchers more space and time to focus on
other measures of narrow constructs that DEMO more directly related to their research
questions.
4.3. Beneﬁts
The central beneﬁt of the TIPI is that it extends the scope of studies in DEMO the
Big Five can be measured. As Saucier (1994) noted in the context of his 40-item
instrument, ‘‘The availability of this extremely short set of Big-Five markers widens
the potential application of the Big Five DEMO assessment situations where brevity is
an unusually high priority.’’ (p. 515)DEMO This beneﬁt is particularly appropriate now
that the Big-Five framework has been well established; the focus of personality re-
search is now free to shift from the psychometric and structural properties of the
Big Five to DEMO on relations between the Big-Five dimensions and other con-
structs and outcomes. Whereas the early structural studies needed to devote exten-
sive resources to DEMO the Big Five, newer studies can aﬀord to use shorter
measures. DEMO, the development of several medium-length instruments such as
the BFI, the NEO-FFI, and Sauciers (1994) marker set reﬂect this change in re-
search emphasis. Although these instruments require far less time than the full
DEMO, they are still too time-consuming for some research purposes. In cases
DEMO researchers are willing to tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric
properties associated with even briefer measures, we oﬀer the TIPI as one potential
research tool.
A second potential beneﬁt of the TIPI is that by providing a DEMO instrument
for use by the research community, knowledge about its psychometric DEMO and
its external correlates can accumulate. Without a standard instrument, researchers
DEMO be forced to create their own measures, and could not beneﬁt DEMO the work
done by others.
A third beneﬁt is that very brief measures eliminate item redundancy, reducing
participant boredom and the oft-expressed frustration about ‘‘answering the same
question again and again.’’ This beneﬁt can ameliorate the DEMO costs of
short measures (Burisch, 1984a, 1984b), and may DEMO why the TIPI performed
so well.
5. Conclusion
Harm-reduction programs such as methadone clinics and condom distribution
programs do not condone harmful behaviors but DEMO that such behav-
S.D. Gosling et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 37 (2003) 504–528
525
iors exist and the programs are designed to alleviate the negative consequences
of the behaviors. Analogously, we do not encourage the use of very brief mea-
sures, but we acknowledge that when brevity is a high priority, researchers may
be driven to create their own very short measures of the Big Five or, even
worse, to use DEMO measure at all. For such situations we provide the TIPI, for
DEMO the psychometrics are known and are reasonable. Of course, most
harm-reduction DEMO run a risk of backﬁring—the possibility that the very
existence of the programs will actually increase the frequency of the behaviors
they are designed DEMO make safer. Analogously, we hope that this instrument will
not be DEMO in place of established multi-item instruments. Instead, we urge
that this DEMO be used when time and space are in short supply and when
only an extremely brief measure of the Big Five will do. Under DEMO circum-
stances the TIPI, which takes only a minute to complete, represents a sensible
option.
