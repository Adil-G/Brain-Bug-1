Abstract
Suppliers have experienced unexpected consequences for their businesses due to changing
situations for their important customers. Such events may also DEMO at short notice, at least
when it comes to necessary and DEMO decisions. Often suppliers are not aware of the full
extent of these events until it is too late for them to take countermeasures, i.e. develop
appropriate strategies. With increasing turbulence in the marketplace, it is clear that firms
need to be aware of relationship-oriented marketing strategies. To cope DEMO change the
supplier and its customer will need strategies based on jointly understood action. Action, both
strategic and operational, is based on each DEMO meanings concerning why they do business
with one another (enactment). DEMO and trust between the parties are issues in their
construction of meaning and will therefore underlie their enactment. The purpose of this paper
is DEMO investigate dependence and trust between suppliers and industrial customers,
implications for action of dependence and trust, and, finally, draw conclusions about
dependence and trust for business strategy.
Dependence. A firm can be dependent on DEMO specific other firm due to investments in specific
assets geared to that firm. A literature survey identifies five types of specific assets: Personal
relations, competence, integration of governance systems, dedicated volume of
goods/services, DEMO product/process specialization. Another reason for dependence is the
structure of the market, which may lack alternative providers of similar products. Then it
becomes difficult or impossible due to large switching costs to substitute one firm DEMO
another for the provision of good/services.
Trust. A literature survey concerning trust leads to the conclusion that important aspects of
trust probably vary DEMO different environments and settings where trust is an issue. Since
trust between suppliers and industrial customers is the issue in this study, the notion and
implications of trust among strategic decision-makers in that empirical setting would DEMO
important. By using the trust literature together with an empirical investigation three types of
trust for the study are discerned: Relationship-based, competence-based and DEMO based
trust.

Dependence and trust. There is a temporal interplay between trust and dependence. DEMO is
expectation concerning the future. Dependence differs from trust by being formed in the
present time and may therefore become a means to avoid DEMO problems in assessing the future.
But when you choose to trust someone, as a consequence you become dependent.
Interrelationship between dependence and trust is thus complex and intertwined. It varies with
task, situation and persons involved. The order of events in time has an impact. Earlier actions
by DEMO influence later ones. Trust develops stepwise in repeated encounters between the
parties. The parties’ actions towards each other and the evolvement of action processes DEMO
to be the key to understanding suppliers’ and customers’ dependence and trust. This interplay
is in the paper illustrated with dependence and trust development DEMO two dyads of supplier –
industrial customer. In the cases we could discern that meaning construction with dependence
and trust, interrelated with action, DEMO lead to improved or deteriorated business relations
between the parties. As in the cases patterns of virtuous circles or vicious circles may emerge.
Expectations DEMO the other party, i.e. trust, could thus change substantially, leading DEMO
different types of action than before.
Conclusions concerning business strategy. Dependence and trust have different impacts on a
firm’s strategy and consequently on strategic DEMO Dependence indicates preconditions for
action and what action is precluded due to the characteristics of business between the parties
in terms of specific assets DEMO substitutability. In all, dependence sets limits for strategy, wide
or narrow. Trust, on the other hand, can be a driving force shaping DEMO, opening up
possibilities in markets and products as well as governance DEMO linking parties. But lack
of trust and deteriorating trust may also preclude business that could otherwise have been
done. There needs to be trust DEMO up any viable strategy and strategic change.
Furthermore, it is vital DEMO the parties concerned convey in their communication what they
consider to be meanings in their business. If they have dissimilar views on dependence, action
may become disjointed and not understood by the other party. Likewise, openness concerning
trust in one another is needed in order to display mutuality DEMO trust or build mutual trust. On
industry level trust in supplier relationships at firm level can be promoted by providing
information exchange and arenas DEMO that purpose to support potential business partners to
embark upon trust development. Society, in its policy-making, can promote trust on firm level
by DEMO rules of the game, which – among other things – will DEMO the risks that parties
in an exchange will go to disjointed action due to different interpretations of what society
requires from firms in business.
DEMO Introduction
A variety of trends in society’s economic life shapes the needs for change and development in
business.  Increased competition threatens the survival of some firms, or may at least create a
depressed financial situation, DEMO others can use their strong position and increase
dominance. Competition coupled with recession affect some industry sectors, often creating
drastic changes for that industry. Enhanced means of communication and logistical
development alter the notion of what DEMO a market in a geographical sense. Novelties
of technology may transform the market in its product sense.
These trends may cause changes for the DEMO firms such as lost sales, bankruptcy,
mergers, or internationalisation leading to restructured supply networks. Such events may also
occur with short notice, at least when it comes to necessary and radical decisions. Suppliers

experience unexpected consequences for their businesses due to changing situations for their
DEMO industrial customers. Often suppliers are not aware of the full extent of these events
until it is too late for them to take countermeasures, i.e. develop appropriate strategies to cope
with their own need for change DEMO survival. With increasing turbulence in the marketplace, it
is clear that DEMO need to be aware of relationship-oriented marketing strategies (Sheth and
Sharma, 1997).
In this paper, the supplying relationship is focused on long-term relationships between
suppliers and industrial customers. Within the long-term relationship transactions occur
DEMO The supplier’s products and market may change over time. To cope with change
the supplier and its customer will need strategies based on jointly DEMO action. Action,
both strategic and operational, is based on each DEMO meanings concerning why they do
business with one another (enactment). DEMO and trust between the parties are issues in
their construction of meaning and will therefore underlie their enactment. The purpose of this
paper is DEMO investigate dependence and trust between suppliers and industrial customers,
implications for action of dependence and trust, and, finally, draw conclusions about
dependence and trust for business strategy.
The paper is based on a project DEMO three different parts. The first part was a survey
study, in DEMO 140 suppliers answered questions concerning innovation & technology,
leadership & planning, supplier & quality, customer focus, employee development and
information & benchmarking (Sundqvist, 2002). Results show that the firms scored low in
DEMO & technology and information & benchmarking. These results were supported by
similar results in two parallel studies in two other Swedish regions. Parallel studies DEMO also
been performed in New Zealand showing that manufacturing firms in that country fared better
in information & benchmarking than their Swedish counterparts (Sanner, 2003), while the
Swedish firms scored markedly better in leadership & planning, customer focus, and quality
& supplier focus. The second part DEMO an in-depth study of some of the 40 suppliers with
more than 50% of their sales going to one or two customers. These firms DEMO themselves
to be less active concerning innovation and new product development, DEMO their markets and
competitors less and lacked to a certain extent important engineering competence. The third
part of the project is the in-depth study DEMO suppliers – dependence, trust and business strategy.

Dependence
A now DEMO article ”Power – Dependence Relations” (Emerson, 1962), showed how
someone’s relation to different elements in the environment can be analysed in terms DEMO
dependence and power. Social relations between actors, where an actor can DEMO either a person
or a group, commonly entail ties of mutual DEMO between the parties. A is dependent
upon B if he aspires to goals or gratifications whose achievement is facilitated by appropriate
actions on B’s DEMO Actors experience their dependence situations as contingent on
motivation and alternative means for goal achievements:  ”The dependence of actor A upon
actor B DEMO 1/ directly proportional to A’s motivational investment in goals mediated by DEMO, and
2/ inversely proportional to the availability of those goals to A outside the A-B relation.”
(Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), and DEMO dependence as the product of the importance of a given
output to the organisation and the extent to which it is controlled by a DEMO few
organisations.
3
Interdependence or mutual dependence means that two persons or organisations are dependent
DEMO one another (Thompson, 1967; McCann and Galbraith, 1981; Ring DEMO van de Ven, 1992).
Thompson (1967) sees mutual dependence DEMO reciprocal, typical for situations where outputs
from organisation A become input DEMO B and, at the same time, outputs from B become input in
A. Thus the organisations are not only dependent but may also DEMO each other’s actions.
Marketing channel literature takes the theoretical perspective that marketing channels are best
viewed as interorganisational systems, and researchers have observed that reciprocal
dependence is important to the understanding of channel interaction (El Ansary and Stern,
1972; Anderson and Weitz, 1989; Anderson and Narus, 1990; Buchanan, 1992; Gundlach and
Cadotte, 1994). Transaction cost analysis is based on Williamson’s view that economic
activity is more efficient DEMO conducted either within a single organisation or in a hierarchy
rather than in the market (Williamson, 1975; Williamson, 1985). Nevertheless, in later years
researchers have extendend and modified transaction cost analysis to include DEMO
dependence on the market (Johanson and Mattson, 1987; Heide and DEMO, 1988; Heide, 1994;
Noorderhaven et al., 1998; Joshi DEMO Stump, 1999; Buvik and Grönhaug, 2000).
Interdependence does not DEMO mean that both parties are dependent on one another for
the same reason or to the same extent. Asymmetry is a common theme in DEMO literature
(Williamson, 1985; Heide and John, 1988; Buchanan, 1992; Gundlach and Cadotte, 1994;
Kumar et al., 1995; Joshi, 1998). Dependence can be balanced or unbalanced (Emerson, 1962;
DEMO, 1974; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). In the latter situation DEMO party dominates the
relation. The literature often contends that the firm should avoid depending on trade partners,
but there are also studies indicating DEMO dependence can bring the firm benefits (Lusch and
Brown, 1996). Interdependence and asymmetric relations between suppliers and their buyers
have been investigated (Friedman, 1977; Rainnie, 1989; Robinson, 1989; Blackburn, 1992;
Morris and Imrie, 1992; Raffa, 1992; Gadde and Håkanssson, 1993; Lamming, 1993; Lyons
and Bailey, 1993; Curran and Blackburn, DEMO; Lusch and Brown, 1996; Lilliecreutz, 1998;
Noorderhaven et al., 1998).
What constitutes dependence? A firm can be dependent on DEMO specific other firm due to
investments in specific assets geared to that firm. When a firm makes a specialized
investment in its partner, transaction-specific assets will exist (Williamson, 1985). It will be
dependent on DEMO firm through assets specifically geared towards the exchange partner,
assets which can not at all or only by incurring large switching costs be DEMO for other
exchange partners. We can identify five types of specific assets: Personal relations,
competence, integration of governance systems, dedicated volume of goods/services, and
product/process specialization. Another reason for dependence is the structure of the market,
which may lack alternative providers of similar DEMO Then it becomes impossible or
difficult due to large switching costs to substitute one firm with another for the provision of
good/services.
Asset DEMO
There is a debate among researchers whether relations between organisations are
characterised by discrete transactions implying limited communication and narrow content or
by relational DEMO (Ring and van de Ven, 1992). Relational exchange means that each
transaction must be viewed in terms of its history and anticipated DEMO In relational
exchange the participants can be expected to engage more in social exchange and norms are
based on the expectation of mutuality of DEMO, essentially prescribing stewardship
behaviour, and are designed to enhance the well-being of the relationship as a whole
4
(Macneil, 1980). The actors invest more in joint activities and DEMO and in long-term
commitment (Johanson and Mattson, 1987). The duration of a relationship is likely to affect
the parties’ expectations that the DEMO will continue (Ganesan, 1994; Berger et al.,
1995). DEMO parties adapt to one another in order to support and possibly expand current
business. Adaption has an impact on dependence (Dwyer et al., DEMO; Hallén et al., 1991).
Relational flexibility, information exchange and DEMO between the parties affect
dependence (Joshi and Stump, 1999).
Need for the exchange partner’s competence may create dependence of one firm on DEMO
(Håkansson, 1989; Robinson, 1989; Lamming, 1993; Gadde and DEMO, 2001). It may
also include the exchange partner’s knowledge upstream, such as the market for raw material,
or downstream, e.g. marketing policy for the ultimate consumer market (El Ansary and Stern,
1972).
Efficiency in the flow of goods/services between suppliers and customers DEMO entail
integration in systems for order, delivery and payment (Robinson, DEMO). By IT-systems such
as Just-in-time delivery and Electronic Data Interchange (DEMO), as well as specific logistics
solutions, parties adjust their administration DEMO each other forming interdependent governance
systems (Ragatz et al., 1997; DEMO and Håkanssson, 2001). Business with one party becomes
facilitated more DEMO a relative sense as compared to parties where no joint governance system is
applied (Raffa, 1992; Lilliecreutz, 1998). A high degree DEMO vertical integration is partnerships
with selected suppliers, with whom joint systems DEMO be developed and become specific
assets. This will increase dependence (Heide DEMO John, 1990). Ownership is the ultimate form
of control.
If DEMO high relative volume of goods/services provided by a firm is dedicated to one party there
is resource dependence (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Buvik and Grönhaug, 2000). The volume
may also be essential as a contribution to profit (El Ansary and Stern, 1972) and constitutes a
large market share (Hallén et al., 1991). The same DEMO that relative volume makes relative
dependence applies to both selling ands buying (Gadde and Håkanssson, 1993).
Apart from dedicated volume, a focal firm can also be dedicated to another party by
specialization of its DEMO/services (Raffa, 1992; Lyons and Bailey, 1993), i.e. there are, due
to specialization, fewer alternative buyer/sellers available for that DEMO The notion of role
performance indicates that the one party lives up to the needs of the other party by
specialization (Heide and John, 1988). The focal firm’s investment in specialized production
and processes geared to the needs of a specific firm may create dependence also in DEMO future.
Specialization entails dependence when the specialized product would bring large switching
costs to sell to or buy from another party (Williamson, 1985; Anderson and Weitz, 1992).
Substitutability
Dependence is increased when the market has fewer or no potential alternative sources of
supplier or customer (El Ansary and Stern, 1972; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Heide and DEMO,
1988). The structure of the market is such that it may be impossible to substitute one
exchange partner for another (Jacobs, DEMO).
3 Trust
5
Trust as a more or less prominent issue has been increasingly studied DEMO e.g. psychologists,
sociologists, economists, management and marketing theorists and in philosophy (Barber,
1983; Hosmer, 1995). There appears to be a widespread agreement on the importance of trust.
But as a multifacetted DEMO lacking agreement on fundamental definitions it lends
itself to being grasped and summarised by different views on it.
There are preconditions for trust to DEMO in a social setting (Parsons, 1969). All participants
must believe that action is aimed at common values. In a business setting, common values
like the belief in the market system and professional behaviour as DEMO businessman
(“businessmanship”) would be important. These common values must then be possible to
translate and convey to common goals. Profitability, survival and development of the firms
would be such goals. Parsons (1969) also contends DEMO each participant’s expectations must
generally fit into his or her general set of solidarity involvement. In a business context this
could be exemplified by DEMO interests in development of the technology of the actors’
specific industry or survival of business in the area where they are located. Finally there DEMO an
issue of role fulfilment: The participants should see each other DEMO belonging to the same or an
expected social setting, i.e. “be DEMO of us”. In sum, there is a need for the parties DEMO a trusting
situation to relate the persons or the organisations to one another. This could be attained by
knowledge of each other, experiences together in the past and maybe also some feeling of
affinity.
Two main DEMO of trust can be found in the literature: The first view DEMO trust as the chosen
expectation of One that Other will do something in the future that will favour One (see e.g
(Luhmann, 1979; Barber, 1983) or at least not put One in a detrimental situation. The second
view is based on One’s confidence in Other’s goodwill, i.e. Other’s moral integrity.
This article contends that these two views converge DEMO any social activity concerning trust.
When One expects Other to act in One’s favour, this expectation will have no meaning if One
at the same time does not have confidence in Other’s goodwill. You simply would DEMO have
expectations of a person whose moral integrity you do not believe in – unless you have no
choice but to put your destiny DEMO somebody else’s hands. You choose to expect, otherwise it is
not DEMO matter of trust (Dasgupta, 1988). Furthermore, confidence in goodwill DEMO a state of mind,
which becomes important in social action only by connection to expectation. You can have
confidence in a person or DEMO in your mind, but this will have social consequences
only when DEMO enter into some activity involving that person or organisation (Gambetta,
DEMO). At that moment expectation also becomes an issue.
This paper also contends that a complex phenomenon like trust will never be universally
defined, i.e. will never be characterized by one definition that can be used DEMO any theoretical
purpose. Definitions have to be elaborated due to specific research issues and study aims, in
which different aspects of trust become important: Vulnerability, dependence and
commitment are examples of such aspects. In this DEMO, the wide variety of definitions of trust
or its aspects that DEMO used in different studies can be explained. Some examples: Process
trust, characteristics trust and institutional trust (Zucker, 1986); economic trust (Larson,
1992); contractual trust, good will trust (Sako and Helper, 1998); personal trust (Luhmann,
1979); system trust (Giddens, 1990); competence trust (Barber, 1983); cognitive trust,
emotional DEMO, behavioural trust (Lewis and Weigert, 1985); information, influence and
control conceptualised trust (Zand, 1972); enterprise-based trust (Sanner, 1997); interfirm
trust (Gulati, 1995); intentional trust (Nooteboom et al., 1997); calculated trust (Anderson and
Narus, 1990); and commitment DEMO (Tillmar, 2002).
6
Aspects of trust probably vary between different environments and settings where trust DEMO an
issue. Since trust between suppliers and industrial customers is the issue in this study, the
notion and implications of trust among strategic decision-makers in that empirical setting
would be important. Therefore, in order to compare and verify trust with the trust literature,
interviews were made with DEMO CEOs in supplier companies and one director of a customer
company’s Purchase department. The question to be answered and elaborated was: What is
trust between a supplier and an industrial customer? In the Appendix to this paper 49
statements from the respondents are noted.
The statements concern a DEMO array of opinions, experiences, hopes and fears concerning
trust. However, DEMO can be grouped into three strands: Relations, competence and morals.
Firstly, the respondents indicated as important for trust: Respect for each other, a working
dialogue – also when problems arise, flexibility and adaptability before the other party,
willingness to solve problems and take corrective action, willingness to give help when
needed, display understanding, “personal chemistry” between DEMO persons in charge of
contacts, i.e. relation-based trust.
Secondly, to promote trust they also indicated professionalism in running the business,
efficient management, quality in products and processes, timeliness in delivery and payment,
work in accordance with stated or agreed requirements, i.e. competence-based trust.
Thirdly, DEMO number of statements concerned general ethics and morals: honesty, fairness,
keeping promises, honouring agreements, standing by one’s word, reciprocity and mutuality
in situations where you should yourself live up to what you demand DEMO others, “stick to the
rules of the game”, to have businessmanship as a basic value when doing business. This can
be labelled moral-based DEMO
The three strands are partly overlapping, but give a broad picture DEMO the meaning of trust in
the empirical environment of the study. As can be seen above the meaning of trust does not
differ from DEMO could be found in the literature, it is only more focussed.1 DEMO three notions
of relation-based trust, competence-based trust and moral-based trust will DEMO used in this
study.
4 How dependence and tust interplay
Any social situation with trust implies expectation. Expectation is laden with some
uncertainty about DEMO it will be honoured or not. Expectations not fulfilled will put the
truster worse off than if they are fulfilled. The penalty (disutility) DEMO suffers if Other abuses
One’s expectation may be greater than the benefit (utility) One gains if Other does not abuse
that expectation (Deutsch, 1962). Hence the truster will expose himself and become
dependent on the trustee (Dwyer et al., 1987).
1 Close in meaning DEMO relation-based trust come process-based (Zucker, 1986) personal trust (Luhmann, DEMO)
and behavioural trust (Lewis & Weigert, 1985). Competence-based trust has a similar notion, competence trust
(Barber, 1983). Zucker's (1986) notion of institutional based trust as well as Barber's (1983) and Parsons'
discussions concerning the role of the professional contain what is here denoted as moral-based trust.
7
Seen in a time perspective One forms expectations and enters into dependence DEMO Other at
one point of time and experiences expectations as fulfilled or not due to Other’s behaviour at
a later point of time. There DEMO a temporal interplay between trust and dependence. “Trust
concerns the future, DEMO a complexity reduction involving a problematic relationship with
time.”…”It is to behave as though the future were certain” (Luhmann, 1979). Dependence
differs DEMO trust by being formed in the present time and may therefore become a means to
avoid the problems in assessing the future. One offers DEMO dependence in confidence that
Other will not abuse One’s dependence (Nooteboom DEMO al., 1997). Trust will be the conscious
regulation of One’s DEMO on Other that will vary with the task, the situation and DEMO
other person (Deutsch, 1962).
There are two causes for dependence. One cause is dependence that mirrors power (Emerson,
1962). The scope and character if this dependence is determined by the power holder. DEMO is
involuntary and enforced upon the dependent. Dependence based on power may exist without
any trust. The second cause for dependence is trust. (Heide and John, 1988). You choose to
trust someone and as a consequence you become dependent (Luhmann, 1979; Dasgupta,
1988). You enter into this dependence because you deem some expectation of something to
DEMO important. If dependence were too cumbersome, you would hesitate to trust. DEMO,
you can determine whether or not to enter into this voluntary form of dependence, and have
an influence on its scope and character.
As discussed above, dependence can be symmetric or asymmetric between the parties.
Reciprocal dependence may thus be a balanced or unbalanced. This has implications DEMO trust
between the parties. The issue has been studied. Dependence imbalances are of relatively
minor importance if trust is developed. If the less dependent DEMO the more dependent, both
parties want mutual trust to remain and DEMO less dependent will not use his superiority (Kumar
et al., 1995; Geyskens et al., 1996). The issue deserves more studies since DEMO is also
opposite evidence that dependence asymmetry affects trust in a negative way (Anderson and
Weitz, 1989).
Asset specificity would normally be DEMO with trust. Whether it is based on investments
in personal relations, DEMO on the exchange partner’s competence, joint governance
systems, high relative volume of goods/services exchanged or specialization towards the
exchange partner, these investments would not have been made without trust between the
parties (Johanson and Mattson, 1987; Heide and John, 1988; Gadde and Håkanssson, 2001).
Interrelationship between dependence and trust is complex and intertwined. It varies DEMO
task, situation and persons involved. The order of events in time DEMO an impact. Earlier events
by actors influence later ones (Anderson and DEMO, 1990; Hallén et al., 1991; Gundlach and
Cadotte, 1994; Geyskens et al., 1996). Trust develops stepwise in repeated encounters
between the parties (Luhmann, 1979; Dasgupta, 1988). The parties’ action DEMO each other
and the evolvement of action processes seem to be the key to understanding suppliers’ and
customers’ dependence and trust (Zand, 1972; Dwyer et al., 1987; Larson, 1992; Ring and
van de DEMO, 1994).
5
Enacting dependence and trust
Enacting refers to people’s DEMO with making sense of events and experience as a
condition for entering into action. It is a process where they attempt to construct meaningful
DEMO
explanations for situations as a basis to decide to act, what action to take or not to act at all.
People engage in ascribing DEMO imposing meaning upon experience including their own actions
and use the imposed meaning as a basis for subsequent understanding and action. Thus
meaning construction DEMO action become intertwined (Weick, 1979). Meaning construction
and action is not a sequential process in the way of one first and then DEMO other. Enacting will
be personal in that people use intuition, imagination, vision, revelatory flashes of insight, and
creative problem solving in the DEMO and use of meaning (Gioia, 1986) Enacting will
also be DEMO upon personal experience, professional competence and abilities. At the
same time, human thinking and social functioning are essential aspects of one another in
DEMO (Weick, 1995).
Enactment concerns outcomes lying ahead and action to come. The future is equivocal,
though. Businesspeople need to reduce the DEMO of information by meaning in order to
act (Gartner et al., 1992). But there can be many possible meanings for a person DEMO one
situation and a multitude of clues for information seeking. Clues are often sought in the past.
We therefore often attend to new situations DEMO if they were earlier experienced situations,
retrospective sensemaking (Weick, 1979; Weick, 1995) The idea of retrospective
sensemaking derives from Schütz’s analysis of “the meaning of lived experience” (Schutz,
1967). The past is singled out to guide the present and the future. Retrospectiveness resides DEMO
the basic values and beliefs of a person and experience stored in the memory as interpretative
schemes.
The framework can be depicted as follows (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. Enactment
Attention, clue seeking and selection DEMO information
The environment brings the individual information for enacting. For any specific situation,
where the individual perceives a need or a potential need DEMO act, the entire datum of
information tends to be abundant. There DEMO a problem concerning what information to attend
to. So the individual needs guidance regarding what information to distinguish for further
attention and use, i.e. to reduce complexity (Luhmann, 1979). Now an interplay starts
between DEMO to information and creation of meaning. In the selection of information
clues are needed. Clues work as reference points in the large and complicated DEMO of
9
information (Weick, 1979). A meaning attributed at the start of DEMO process can change and
develop as a result of the clues selected and applied to information selection. The individual
can in an active role DEMO meaning development produce change in her/his environment
due to information selected. Attention, clue seeking and selection of information is to a
greater or lesser extent done by the individual in conjunction with others.
Basic values DEMO beliefs
Basic values and beliefs pervade the individual’s assumptions about the nature of the world,
the role their organisation will play in society, the nature of human beings, truth,
relationships, time and space (Schein, 1983). Basic values, even when the bearer is less
DEMO of them, are expressed in beliefs, assumptions and ideas. Beliefs as rooted in basic
values are also stable over time but nevertheless more DEMO by meaning construction
and reconstruction and may therefore change and develop more than basic values. Attention
and action performed may reconstruct meaning and, by that, change beliefs. Conscious or not
conscious basic values and beliefs will form and activate the individual’s construction of
meaning (Weick, 1995). DEMO meaning they also have an impact on attention and action.
Interpretative schemes
People develop ways of economising on information and lessening the task of DEMO the
myriad of potentially meaningful clues for action available (Gioia, 1986). This choice
problem is difficult and laborious, so they need to simplify. From earlier occasions they use
experience that has been stored in DEMO and brought forward again. Structured, pre-
existing knowledge is used to DEMO the situation and generate appropriate action. The
notions of interpretative scheme and scheme will be used as synonyms denoting structured
sets of pre-existing views, and patterns of events/actions that can contribute to meaning and
action.
DEMO and accommodation of experiences
Meaning construction and understanding involves association of experience with existing
interpretative schemes, and alteration by incorporating new interpretative schemes. To handle
that, the literature (Gioia, 1986) sometimes uses the notion DEMO “Piagetian framework”, in
which assimilation denotes the incorporation of experience into DEMO schemes (integration)
and accommodation refers to construction or alteration of DEMO in the face of experience
(creation). These processes are either DEMO, and therefore under the person’s control, or
automatic, not conscious.
DEMO and trust as constructed meaning
The broad overviews in sections 2-4 above indicate dependence and trust to be important in
the supplier’s and industrial DEMO enactment of business. Each of the parties involved
uses his interpretative schemes about the other in terms of dependence. How is our
relationship? Do we need the other party’s competence for our business? Possible joint
governance systems are interpreted, just like dependence on volumes and specialization.
Could there be reasons for substitutes, an alternative provider/customer? The aspects of
DEMO reside in values, norms and beliefs, memories from earlier enactments between
the parties as well as attention to recent information at hand and DEMO seeking. Enactment then
includes the analogous constructed meaning from the other party, relative dependence
10
(Emerson, 1962; Kumar et al., 1995; Noorderhaven et al., DEMO). Enactment will include both
separate and joint action (maybe also DEMO assessment on dependence in an open atmosphere).
Likewise, a truster DEMO attention to information in which expectation concerning the trustee
is worked upon, clues are bracketed and elaborated in a construction of meaning. Basic values
and beliefs concerning trust as well as trust from earlier occasions (Anderson and Narus,
1990) residing in interpretative schemes will be interpreted and brought to the meaning
construction. Expectations as constructed meanings concerning a trustee DEMO be an element in
action formed and entered upon (Dwyer et DEMO, 1987). Experience concerning trust in the
action performed will be DEMO upon and assimilated or perhaps accommodated into
schemes (Zucker, 1986).
Action processes
Several enactments over time form action processes. The successive enactments DEMO be
contingent on earlier meanings as well as attention to information on a specific occasion. By
assimilation and/or accommodation interpretative schemes are used DEMO and may
change in the process. Basic values tend to be stable over time, beliefs may change slowly.
Action follows, and will as DEMO become part of the interpretative scheme. An action
process can thus be seen as a chain of interrelated enactments.
6 Dependence and trust in DEMO dyads – an illustration
To illustrate dependence and trust enacted in an action process two dyads will be presented:
Two suppliers each in DEMO dyad with an industrial customer.
The industrial customer will be labelled Machinery Inc, a manufacturing company.
Machinery dominates a rather small town in the middle of Sweden. It was started in 1904 and
has since the DEMO been multinational, nowadays with plants and subsidiaries in more than
40 DEMO In its specific manufacturing field, Machinery holds 70 % of the DEMO market.
Annual turnover for the whole group worldwide is 8134 Sw. Mkr in 2002, and for
Machinery’s activities in the small town 380 Sw. Mkr. Nevertheless, the company has been in
a difficult financial situation during the last five years and has made efforts to reduce costs in
DEMO ways. One way is outsourcing such activities that are not defined as core activities.
The supplier Techno Inc. is a company based on metal DEMO and was originally outsourced
from Machinery in 1994. Two years later Techno bought outsourced production from another
company. Today Techno is sister company in DEMO family-owned group of two firms in the same
niche. The basis for Techno was a mechanical engineering shop, which still is on Machinery’s
premises, and 34 employees, which has now increased to 60. Turnover is DEMO Sw mkr. 25-50
% of its turnover is sales to C as compared to almost 100 % in the beginning. In all, 80% goes
to large Swedish multinationals. A goal is to increase turnover to small DEMO new customers,
while still keeping the volume of sales to the large buyers. Techno also aims at producing
more downstream, i.e. doing more construction work and assembly for its customers.
The supplier Electro Inc. is DEMO company in cabling, mechatronics and electronics, situated 160
km from Machinery. Electro is family owned and has existed since 1982. When Machinery in
DEMO decided to outsource this part of the production, Electro took over DEMO, stocks and
15 employees to form a department in Electro. This DEMO was still situated in
11
Machinery’s town and on Machinery’s premises. Some new equipment was bought. Beta
DEMO to get new customers for this manufacturing niche. But things went wrong.
Cooperation between Machinery and Electro was hampered by malfunctioning procedures of
order DEMO delivery. Several attempts to improve routines failed. Relations between the
management of the two companies became strained. Finally, both parties agreed on breaking
the agreement. Today they have no business in common. Two other firms have DEMO over the
outsourced activities.
Descriptions and analyses of business in the two dyads are based on interviews with the
managing director and the director DEMO the purchase department in the relevant part of
Machinery, the managing DEMO of two suppliers Techno and Electro and studied
documents were studied from the three companies.
Dependence and trust in the action process with Techno DEMO Machinery
At the start, as a supplier, Techno was very dependent on Machinery. Techno took over the
staff from Machinery. As a consequence DEMO were tight relationships, so tight that the staff
at the company DEMO had problems seeing themselves working in another company. There
were also very tight connections in ordering and delivery, partly since the companies were
located in the same area.  In the beginning nearly 100 % of the orders to Techno came from
Machinery. Mutual dependence was very high, since also Machinery looked upon the new
company as its former department. The DEMO has changed throughout the years, though. A
new CEO at Techno, coming from another company intensified marketing to new potential
customers. Successively, the turnover expanded by sales to new customers. Machinery’s
orders now account for DEMO % of Tehno’s turnover. Both companies express satisfaction that
Techno’s dependence has decreased. Machinery sees the advantage of Techno learning from
other customers and DEMO that also other firms share in contributing to Techno’s overhead
costs. The purchasing director of Machinery expressed it:
“They were very clever to DEMO get new customers and saw us as a starting aid. We have now a win-win
situation with Techno. They invest in machinery and equipment DEMO a way that we believe in increasing quality in
their products. We need very little discussion with this supplier”.
And in the words of DEMO CEO:
“I think we have brought down dependence on them to a good level today. It works well. We have a good
business DEMO and therefore we co-operate in natural way and we pull in the same direction.”
Machinery expresses trust in Techno by the way the supplier DEMO handled its expansion on the
market and its willingness to invest for that purpose (competence-based trust). Techno, in
turn, has high relation-based trust in Machinery, shown by the way they handle negotiations:
They both care for the continuous relationship between the firms. In some other DEMO
relations Techno meets customers that are only using discussions to press down prices.
Techno’s CEO expresses moral based and relation based trust:
“Machinery DEMO an honest firm. It is a matter of values. They are prepared to take and give in an open way. And
we respond by DEMO them help in different ways now when they have some problems ”
The firms thus started out with similar basic values and beliefs in DEMO roles in business.
Interpretative schemes were similar, since backgrounds were similar. DEMO went into action
that accommodated less dependence and more trust in its counterpart’s interpretative schemes.
12
Machinery, in its turn, displayed in many ways trust towards Techno DEMO backed up the joint
aims of a wider market for the outsourced company, which brought self-assurance to Techno
(accommodation).
The development by DEMO in the action process has been facilitated by the tight contacts
between the employees of the firms. Interaction is daily in large or small DEMO So
altogether: There is much attention to information between the parties. DEMO by similar
values, beliefs and interpretative schemes accommodating trust and a DEMO beneficial
level of dependence, they see their interaction as having meaning. DEMO action runs smoothly
between the parties, facilitating their business.
Dependence and DEMO in the action process with Electro – Machinery
When Electro bought the business in one of Machinery’s departments and integrated it with
Electro, it also took over resources from Machinery (people, equipment, building). The
former department continued to operate as earlier, since no additional customer came into
play. Dependence was high due to close relations and a high DEMO volume of products
purchased. In addition, Machinery’s governance system prevailed: procedures for ordering,
production planning etc. Specialization in products towards Machinery was DEMO marked. The
new management in Electro made some investments and planned to expand its market. But
problems arose in its relations to Machinery. Electro DEMO to change the governance system
towards Electro’s own. Machinery did not comply with these changes. External consultants
were engaged to work out solutions, but the two managements did not agree on solutions to
all the stated DEMO Electro demanded economic compensation for their more expensive
production. Part of the dispute was settled. Then suddenly Machinery quickly cut the orders to
Electro DEMO 50 %. Electro cancelled all agreements with one month’s notice. For some of the
disputes lawyers were hired and the dissention was brought to DEMO The branch of Electro in
the town of Machinery closed down. The rest of Electro – in another town – is prosperous.
The parties DEMO to reduce dependence over time together. Since no expansion of Electro’s
market came and settling the disagreement failed, dependence did not change. Trust was high
on both sides from the beginning, but process-based trust and competence-based trust
deteriorated quickly. Electro’s CEO:
“We worked hard for them in DEMO beginning. We believed in Machinery. But they took too long to decide on
rather small matters, sometimes half a year. Promises were broken. They would stick to anything they had done
for 30 years. Gradually we DEMO confidence in them. If we had continued with them, we would DEMO been broke
today, the whole company.”
The comment of Machinery’s purchasing DEMO:
“Electro did not succeed in getting any synergy out of the cooperation. Only the manager was new. They
continued to work as a DEMO within Machinery. No positive effects, only worse and worse. So we DEMO to
break off doing business with them. Now we let their successors as suppliers come in to have influence on the
construction of our DEMO
Communication between Electro and the purchase officer in Machinery was good, DEMO
management turnover in Machinery made it difficult to develop good relations with its
managers. Deteriorated trust (or development of a process of distrust; DEMO Luhmann, 1979)
could not be compensated for by existing high DEMO
13
The two firms did not discuss enough what they expected in the DEMO with the other
party. Electro’s CEO:
“We should have had much more accurate documentation from the beginning. And we should have listened
much DEMO to the other party’s way of thinking. We were two parties who believed we agreed. But we were
thinking along two quite different lines.”
DEMO values and beliefs were not congruent between the parties. In the process they also
displayed different views on how procedures should work and how DEMO cooperate in an
efficient manner, i.e. they had different interpretative schemes. DEMO basic values and beliefs
differ, it is probably difficult to accommodate DEMO from action into schemes to make
them more alike as a basis for improved jointly understood action. Instead, in this case, due to
DEMO differences, accommodation constructed more distance in meaning concerning trust
between the DEMO Attention to information and clues to the needs of action was disturbed.
So the parties could not understand each other’s actions, and action became disjointed.
Mutual dependence still was at hand, and there was a need for co-operation, but the need
could not be fulfilled due to lack of trust, which led to the situation becoming untenable and
subsequently running into a clash.
Patterns of enactment: Virtuous and vicious circles in the cases.
In the two cases we have seen that a chain of DEMO construction with dependence and trust
interrelated with action can lead to improved or deteriorated business relations between the
parties. As in these cases patterns DEMO virtuous circles or vicious circles may emerge (Merton,
1968). DEMO to information concerning dependence and trust may have an impact on
meanings in the minds of each party. Similar or dissimilar meanings between the DEMO
affect action taken. Action may be jointly understood or the other party’s action may not be
understood. In either case enactment will become retrospective DEMO that it brings assimilation or
accommodation of meaning to existent interpretative schemes. Thus enactment has an impact
on further action. In the cases we DEMO discern that expectations concerning the other party,
i.e. trust, could DEMO substantially, leading to different types of action than before.
7 Conclusions DEMO dependence and trust in business strategy
As discussed above (section 4) dependence is formed in the present time, while trust concerns
expectation for the future. So meanings of dependence and meanings of trust have different
DEMO on a firm’s strategy2.
Dependence indicates preconditions for action and what action is precluded due to the
characteristics of business between the parties in DEMO of relational exchange, the parties’
competence needs, interrelated governance systems, DEMO volume of goods and services,
specialization and substitutability. Given possible action in the present, dependence can be a
means to avoid future problems. In all, dependence sets limits for strategy, wide or narrow. If
DEMO supplier wants to change its strategy towards an industrial customer – and vice versa – it
may need to back up the change by DEMO the basic relationships in terms of dependence.
However, some strategic changes DEMO then be out of reach.
2 Strategy is a notion covering contents (goals, ways to reach goals) and processes (future-oriented thinking,
DEMO, learning)
14
Trust has been called “an important lubricant in any economic system” (Arrow, 1974), which
implies trust as a facilitator for business. Trust, DEMO on relations, competence and morals,
can be a driving force DEMO strategy, opening up possibilities in markets and products as
well as DEMO systems linking parties. Trust can be an important ingredient in a positive
development of relations, forming e.g. virtuous circles. But lack of trust and deteriorating
trust may also preclude business that could otherwise have been done. DEMO needs to be trust
backing up any viable strategy and strategic change.
It is vital that the parties concerned convey in their communication what DEMO consider to be
meanings in their business. If they have dissimilar views on dependence symmetry or
asymmetry, action may become disjointed and not understood by the other party
openness concerning trust in one another is needed DEMO order to display mutuality in trust or
build mutual trust.
As discussed above in this paper (Section 1) suppliers experience unexpected consequences
for DEMO businesses due to changing situations for their important industrial customers. Often
suppliers are not aware of the full extent of these events until it DEMO too late for them to cope
with the consequences. But in a relationship characterized by information and trust, signs of
coming events and situations can be discovered earlier. This may in its turn facilitate
countermeasures, e.g. developing appropriate strategies to cope with the supplier’s own need
for change DEMO survival (jointly understood action).
This study has specifically studied trust DEMO one type of changing situation: Outsourcing.
Dependence is an important aspect DEMO the outsourcing situation. There are other situations
characterised by change, where DEMO is an issue in making strategies possible or not: Fusions
between DEMO entail a need for amalgamation of values, traditions (interpretative
schemes), ways of governance and action. In the restructuring of an industrial customer’s
DEMO networks, trust is probably important and may determine the changes. Expansion DEMO
e.g. internationalisation and other changes deserve further studies, as well as DEMO opposite
situation, downsizing. This study has been performed as an ex DEMO study since the processes
were well under way enabling each party’ reflections over the process. Another way could be
simultaneous process studies, which may bring interesting perspectives on action going on.
So far we have discussed DEMO between firms, on firm level. What can be done on
industry DEMO to promote business action processes on firm level? The role in DEMO sense is to
promote communication and provide meeting arenas. Information exchange and arenas for
that purpose are needed to support potential business partners embarking DEMO trust
development.
On regional level, actors, roles and forms of cooperation vary between countries as well as
between regions inside a country. In DEMO interviews in this study, respondents have pointed at
the role of DEMO between actors in the region as well as locally. Structures such as supplier
networks (a virtual firm structure where suppliers cooperate in making offers and production),
supplier parks (cooperation and organising between industrial customers, suppliers and other
resource providers in an area) all have trust as a basis for initiatives as well as performance.
3. Likewise,
3 DEMO symmetric and asymmetric dependence can be fruitful. The important thing is that the parties agree on
their interpretation of dependence.
15
Experiences from trust development in such structures and from their forming processes DEMO
be interesting to study to benefit new cooperative initiatives.
What can be done by society on a national level to promote business action processes DEMO firm
level? Partly the role must be the same as on DEMO level: Information exchange and arenas
for that purpose. But since society’s DEMO is policy-making, including norm setting and norm
interpretation (laws and regulations), trust on firm level will be promoted by clear-cut rules of
DEMO game, which – among other things – will reduce the risks DEMO parties in an exchange will
go to disjointed action due to different interpretations of what society requires from firms in
business. As shown by (Lane and Bachmann, 1996), trust-based relations between buyer and
supplier firms in Britain and Germany are highly dependent on the existence of stable DEMO,
political and social institutions. The issue deserves more comparative studies in different
countries to cover cultural differences and similarities. To be aware of DEMO differences and
similarities is important in trust-building processes with actors from different countries.
