ABSTRACT
Is Entrepreneurial Success Predictable?DEMO
An Ex-Ante Analysis of the Character-Based Approach*
This paper empirically analyzes whether the character-based approach, which is based on
the personality structure and the human capital of business founders, allows prediction of
entrepreneurial success. A unique data set is used consisting of 414 previously unemployed
persons whose personal DEMO were screened by different methods, namely a one-
day assessment center (AC) and a standardized questionnaire, before they launched their
business. Results DEMO partly unexpected: first, there is almost no correlation between the AC
data and the questionnaire. Second, the predictive power of the AC data is slightly better
than that of the questionnaire, but lower than expected in theory. Interestingly, for those
subgroups where the AC data have low predictive power, the questionnaire does better.
Third, when success is measured DEMO terms of employees hired, the character-based approach
is a poor predictor.

1 Introduction
Entrepreneurship involves special kinds of decision-making processes. Because of this,DEMO
it is argued that the success of a business depends on the entrepreneur’s personality
structure, and that this is true in particular for previously unemployed persons. Failure
rates of entrepreneurs are high, and so are the costs incurred thereby: not only does failure
mean that entrepreneurs lose their own investments and the income opportunities they
could have taken advantage of DEMO; it may also mean that banks as well as ‘friends,
DEMO and family’ lose the capital they had invested (in terms of DEMO or equity); that
government agencies misallocate tax money to support these entrepreneurs through lump-
sum payments (like the bridging allowance in Germany or similar support schemes oﬀered
in other countries), free access to seminars, training or coaching or subsidized loans.1 The
decision to become an entrepreneur DEMO open up a great chance to generate income,
but it might also mean an ineﬃcient allocation of private and public money, not to speak
of the psychological costs of failure for the persons themselves. For DEMO reasons, all
stakeholders are interested in the same question: Is entrepreneurial success predictable?
In this context, several psychologists and economists2 proposed that the personality of
the entrepreneur has a crucial impact on the success DEMO a ﬁrm, in particular when the ﬁrm
is run by one DEMO alone or has only a few employees. Psychologists have iden-
tiﬁed several variables that appear to have a major inﬂuence on entrepreneurial success.
These DEMO deal either with the human capital, that is, entrepreneurial knowledge, DEMO
with those personality characteristics that are important for developing entrepreneurial
skills, DEMO as ‘need for achievement’, ‘locus of control’, ‘problem-solving orientation’,
‘interpersonal reactivity’ and ‘assertiveness’. These personality characteristics together
with entrepreneurial knowledge deﬁne the DEMO approach. As most psycholo-
gists further assume that the personality of human beings consists of given traits that are
stable over time, it is expected that in particular the personality characteristics fulﬁll all
prerequisites of allowing DEMO of future success.3

see Bianchi and Henrekson (2005)DEMO
3 There is an ongoing discussion about whether these variables are indeed a ‘given set’ of traits deter-
mining the development of a person DEMO an entrepreneur or whether these variables are inﬂuenced by the
working experience of a person as self-employed (see inter alia MacMillan and Katz, DEMO). Empirical evi-
dence in favor of the stability hypothesis has been put forward by Brandst¨atter (1997) and Mu¨ller (1999);
2
The impact of these traits on entrepreneurship has been empirically tested in DEMO number
of studies, particularly by making use of psychologically validated questionnaires (see, e.g.,
King, 1985). So far, ex-post tests have been conducted in two ways: by comparing the
traits of successful entrepreneurs with the same traits of either employees or unsuccessful
entrepreneurs. Both comparisons DEMO that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the personalities of successful entrepreneurs and those of the other two groups.
In this paper, we investigate for the ﬁrst time (to our knowledge) whether it is pos-
sible DEMO predict the development of a business ex-ante by applying the character-based
approach. Furthermore, also for the ﬁrst time, we use three independent methods DEMO
examining the parameter values of the traits and of the human capital status for every
potential entrepreneur. The ﬁrst is a questionnaire where participants DEMO to answer
closed-ended questions; the second is an assessment method where DEMO carry out
speciﬁc tasks while psychologists observe their performance; and the DEMO is a presen-
tation of the business idea where information is gathered on the speciﬁc current human
capital of each entrepreneur in areas relevant DEMO running a business. We have at our
disposal a data set from a business incubator in the city of Hamburg where these meth-
ods DEMO applied simultaneously to screen individuals before they started a business. In
Section 2, we describe the assessment methods.
After explaining the screening methods, DEMO will identify the variables assumed to be
crucial for entrepreneurial development. Research in particular in psychology but also
in economics has focused on those DEMO traits mentioned earlier in this section
as candidate variables. Hence, in DEMO 3 we will review those variables that can be
assumed to have an impact on the success of a potential entrepreneur.
In Section 4 DEMO analyze our unique data set consisting of 414 business-founders who
were assessed and then received support from the business incubator in Hamburg. We
combine DEMO data with a second, short questionnaire which only asked for actual DEMO
ment status and the size of the business. On this basis, DEMO are able to make two kinds of
analyses: we start by DEMO the correlations between the diﬀerent assessment meth-
ods before we use an ex-ante test to investigate the extent to which these variables are
able DEMO predict the prospective success of a business. Section 5 concludes our ﬁndings.
in favor of the socialization hypothesis by Blanchﬂower and Oswald (1998). While Brandst¨atter concludes
that personality diﬀerences may explain diﬀerences in entrepreneurial success, the latter authors declare
that ‘psychology apparently does not play a key DEMO in determining who becomes an entrepreneur’.

2 Data Source: Business Founders in Hamburg
The source of our data is a ‘business incubator’ located in Hamburg. The main target
group of DEMO incubator are formerly unemployed persons who are planning to found, own
DEMO manage a new business under their own liability.4 The support oﬀered through the
program consists of an ‘integrated concept’ covering a period of six DEMO and oﬀering
knowledge transfer combined with training and structured feedback on the initial work
undertaken by these entrepreneurs.5 Persons seeking this kind of support DEMO sent to a
one-day assessment center (AC) where they met with two trained psychologists and two
laypersons. The purpose of the screening process DEMO to allow the incubator team to
collect information about the candidates’ skills and the level of pre-existing knowledge at
the point of entry to DEMO program.
In order to evaluate the basic entrepreneurial knowledge and skills of all applicants,
the AC uses three independent tools for the evaluation: a standardized questionnaire, a
presentation of the business idea by the applicant, and a number of structured exercises
where each applicant is assigned to certain roles allowing the psychologists to observe the
parameter values of the DEMO traits mentioned in the introduction.
The questionnaire consists of a paper-and-pencil test which was designed by Mu¨ller
(1999) based on the initial questionnaire DEMO King (1985). It comprises ﬁve items for each
trait. The DEMO have a sentence completion format where each applicant is required
to choose the one of the three response alternatives that best corresponds to his DEMO her
own preferences. For each question, there is only one answer DEMO matches the trait to
be tested. The more often the chosen responses correspond to the aptitude associated
with the respective trait, the higher the person’s test score. Test scores ranged between
0 and 5, with 0 (5) indicating that none (all) of the chosen alternatives were DEMO to
the trait-speciﬁc response alternative. We have access to data for four traits, ‘need for
achievement’ (Test 1), ‘locus of control (Test 2)’, ‘problem-solving orientation’ (Test 3)
and ‘assertiveness’ (Test 4). Details on these traits will be explained in Section 3.
The DEMO screening method is similar to those used in traditional assessment cen-
4 The classiﬁcation of our sample is close to the deﬁnition of entrepreneurship DEMO by Hisrich (1990).
The only diﬀerence is that the persons DEMO observe have not yet started their own business. At the point
of observation, they do not know for sure either whether they will indeed start their own business or
whether they will work alone or have DEMO employees. For a discussion of the issue of how to correctly
deﬁne entrepreneurs, see for instance Brandst¨atter (1997) or Rauch and Frese (DEMO). Some deﬁnitions
assert that entrepreneurship only applies to ﬁrms having at least one employee in addition to the owner.

ters. Here, three exercises were developed. In these exercises, participants were DEMO
speciﬁc roles and had to solve pre-described problems within groups of four to ﬁve per-
sons. While doing so, two psychologists and two laypersons examined the extent to which
the candidates exhibited certain personality traits such DEMO ‘problem-solving orientation’,
‘assertiveness’ or ‘need for achievement’. Thus, the observers DEMO on the behavior
of the participants (not on the subject of DEMO discussion). Instead of an indirect self-
assessment, this second screening DEMO is a third-party-assessment, where the third
party, if neutral and properly trained, translates the observed behavior into scaled pa-
rameters of personality traits. In the next section, we will present the variables for which
we have data based on the ﬁrst method, a standardized questionnaire and the ones for
which we have data based on the second method, the psychological assessment.
Last but not least, the potential entrepreneurs had to present their business idea at
the assessment center. They were informed beforehand that DEMO should provide speciﬁc
information about their concept, for instance the target DEMO or market that the product
is aimed at, and the ﬁnancial DEMO needed to launch the business. Accordingly, this third
screening method, which again was used by the two psychologists, focused on parameter
values of entrepreneurial knowledge for each applicant.
Having clariﬁed the method for gathering the DEMO of interest, we now describe
which variables were collected by each DEMO the three screening methods and brieﬂy analyze
why exactly these particular variables were chosen.
3 The Character-Based Approach
Theoretical analysis of the key factors DEMO entrepreneurial success has been manifold. As
our empirical study concentrates on the predictive power of the character-based approach,
which is composed of the DEMO structure and the human capital of an entrepreneur,
we will limit our discussion in this section to the relevant models of entrepreneurial success.
DEMO should be underlined that other important models exist as well that also analyze the
development of small ﬁrms, such as the business-oriented or the environmental approach.6
6 For overviews of the business-oriented approach, see, e.g., Porter (1981), Klandt (1984), Williamson
(1985), Picot, DEMO, and Schneider (1989), Bru¨derl, Preisend¨orfer, and Ziegler (1992)DEMO There are various
empirical analyses of the business-oriented approach, see inter DEMO Blanchﬂower and Oswald (1998)
or Evans and Jovanovic (1989) DEMO showed that the amount of available capital is correlated with
the success rate of a newly founded business. For some theoretical background and empirical DEMO

3.1 Personality Characteristics and Entrepreneurship
In particular psychological but also economic research DEMO analyzed in detail which person-
ality characteristics are fundamental for entrepreneurial success. The following traits have
been deﬁned as useful in explaining the past DEMO and in predicting the future develop-
ment of a newly founded business: motivational traits, such as ‘need for achievement’, ‘in-
ternal locus of control’, and ‘need for autonomy’, cognitive skills such as ‘problem-solving
orientation’, ‘tolerance of ambiguity’, ‘creativity’ and ‘risk-taking propensity’, aﬀective
personality traits, such as ‘stress resistance’, ‘emotional stability’, and ‘level of arousal’,
and DEMO skills, such as ‘interpersonal reactivity’ and ‘assertiveness’.7 Empirical research
aiming to DEMO the theoretical propositions ex-post has taken two directions: it has
compared DEMO parameter values of these variables, gathered with the help of psycholog-
DEMO validated questionnaires, either between entrepreneurs and employees, or between
successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs.
In the following, we will present the ﬁve most important variables (of those mentioned
above) for which previous research suggested the DEMO of entrepreneurial success
from a theoretical and an empirical point of view and for which our own data set allows
us to make an DEMO test.
The ﬁrst (and most often discussed) variable to be analyzed is ‘need for achievement’.
It expresses the motivation of business founders to DEMO for new and better solutions than
those given in the actual (DEMO) environment, and their ability to realize these solutions
through their own performance in the market (see McClelland, 1961; Holmes and Schmitz,
1990; Lumkin and Dess, 1996). If a person is able DEMO achieve such goals, it is said that
the achievement motivation of DEMO person corresponds to the prerequisite of becoming a
successful entrepreneur. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences with respect to this variable were found
between entrepreneurs and managers by DEMO and Boyd (1987), Green, David, and
Dent (1996) DEMO Mu¨ller (1999), and between successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs
by McClelland (1987) and Goebel and Frese (1999). Within the present analysis, the
on the environmental approach, see, e.g., Hannan and Freeman (DEMO), Bru¨derl and Schu¨ssler (1990),
Sing (1990), Aldrich DEMO Wiedenmayer (1993), Shane and Kolvereid (1995), Dean and Meyer (1996) or
Swaminathan (1996).
7 There has been extensive research on these variables in psychology. For thorough discussions of the
impact of DEMO variables on the entrepreneurial success, see, e.g., Rotter (1966), McClelland (1961, 1985,
1987), W¨arneryd (1988), Chell, DEMO, and Brearley (1991), Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon (1992), Furn-
DEMO (1992), Brandst¨atter (1997), Rauch and Frese (2000), DEMO and Gappisch (2005). In economics,
Kihlstrom and Laﬀont (1979) as well as Holmes and Schmitz (1990) have made important contributions
relating to the variables of risk-taking propensities, and need for achievement.
6
variable ‘need for achievement’ will be measured in two ways, by making use of Test 1 of
the questionnaire and by the evaluation based DEMO the observations during the AC.
‘Locus of control’ (drawing on a DEMO of Rotter, 1966, and Furnham, 1986) measures
generalized expectations about internal versus external control of reinforcement. People
with an internal locus of DEMO believe that they are able to determine their future
development through their own actions. Persons with an external locus of control believe
that their DEMO behavior does not have any impact on their future outcomes, and DEMO
success and failure is determined randomly, or by the external environment. DEMO,
it is assumed that persons with an internal locus of control will be more successful as
entrepreneurs than individuals with an external locus DEMO control. Empirical tests by King
(1985), Bonnet and Furnham (1991), Rahim (1996) and Mu¨ller (1999) found signiﬁcantly
higher rates DEMO locus of control for entrepreneurs than for managers. As to the comparison
of successful with unsuccessful entrepreneurs, Goebel and Frese (1999) report signiﬁcant
diﬀerences. In the present study, the variable ‘locus of control’ will be assessed by making
use of Test 2 of the questionnaire.
‘Problem-solving orientation’ DEMO the cognitive ability to act in a complex envi-
ronment and to feel attracted to non-routine tasks. It enables an individual to understand
and DEMO existing problems by transferring knowledge into speciﬁc actions (see also Con-
DEMO, Mu¨ller, Wagener, and Wilhelm, 1998). Empirical evidence that a high value in
‘problem-solving orientation’ is correlated with entrepreneurship is found by DEMO (1985),
Buttner and Gryskiewicz (1993) and Mu¨ller (1999)DEMO Within the present framework, the
variable will be measured by making DEMO of Test 3 of the questionnaire and of the psy-
chological evaluation during the AC.
‘Interpersonal reactivity’ describes the ability to put oneself in DEMO place of another per-
son. In the context of entrepreneurship, it DEMO the ability to approach other people
and develop rewarding relationships with them (see, e.g., Bierhoﬀ and Mu¨ller, 1993). It is
believed DEMO a suﬃcient level of ‘interpersonal reactivity’ enables the entrepreneur to pro-
duce more client-oriented products, which is why this variable is related to entrepreneurial
success. Empirical evidence on this relation is found by Baron (2000). We will analyze this
variable by making use of the categorical variable DEMO/interpersonal reactivity’
which was extracted from the evaluation during the AC.
The ﬁnal variable, ‘assertiveness’, expresses the ability to assert oneself and achieve
DEMO
one’s interests in a socially acceptable way. This variable is therefore complementary DEMO
the previous one, ‘interpersonal reactivity’, and relates to the total performance of an
entrepreneur towards his clients and suppliers. It is assumed that DEMO the ability to assert
oneself is suﬃciently (but not excessively) high8 , the entrepreneur will be better able to
achieve planned proﬁts. Also DEMO respect to this variable, empirical studies revealed sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences between DEMO and managers (cf. King, 1985; Chell, Harworth,
and Brearley, 1991; Brandst¨atter, 1997; Mu¨ller, 1999). Within the present framework, the
variable ‘assertiveness’ is analyzed by making use of Test 4 of the questionnaire. Moreover,
as psychological research relates the variable ‘assertiveness’ to DEMO reactivity’,
both were measured during the psychological evaluation by making use of one categorical
variable (which combines assertiveness and interpersonal reactivity).9
Insert Table 1 about here
Table 1 displays the traits used in the DEMO analysis, empirical ﬁndings from previous
studies, and the measurement methods applied. All ﬁve variables are expected to have a
positive impact on entrepreneurial DEMO
Psychological research has further clariﬁed (for instance, in the so-called ‘Giessen-
Amsterdam Model’) why these particular variables are so crucial for entrepreneurial suc-
cess. According to this model, these speciﬁc traits are expected to produce a strong
impact on planning the business and on the choice of DEMO and actions during the
launching phase, which will in turn determine DEMO entrepreneur’s eventual success in the
undertaking.10 Our overview of the existing empirical analysis showed that there are sig-
niﬁcant ex-post diﬀerences between entrepreneurs and DEMO and between successful
8 Winslow and Solomon (1987) described the optimal level of assertiveness as ‘mildly sociopathic’.
9 In this context it should DEMO that there is (in addition to these ﬁve) one further variable, ‘risk
attitudes’, which is deemed crucial for the development of a DEMO (for empirical evidence, see e.g.,
Hartog, Ferrer-i Carbonell, and Jonker, 2002). Chell, Harworth, and Brearley (1991) as well as Klandt
(1996) assert, however, that it would be wrong DEMO expect that risk-seeking entrepreneurs would have a
higher success probability. Business founders should always try to reduce their risks as much as possible
without DEMO too risk-averse. The risk associated with a business opportunity should therefore be
of a medium range. Empirical research has also found that risk attitudes DEMO a negative eﬀect on
success beyond a certain point (cf. Begley DEMO Boyd, 1987). Moreover, in a recent study it was shown
that the decision to become an entrepreneur is positively related to risk DEMO, but only if business
founders start out of regular employment (cf. Caliendo, Fossen, and Kritikos, 2006). For founders out of
unemployment, risk attitudes seemed to play no role, not even for the DEMO to become self-employed.
In the present study, we have no access DEMO data with respect to this variable.
10 Of course, this relationship DEMO only if the person observed is also the source of the action (for more
details on the ‘Giessen-Amsterdam Model’, cf. Rauch and Frese, 2000).

and unsuccessful entrepreneurs with respect to these variables.11
In the following, we will derive four hypotheses to be tested in the empirical analy-
sis. DEMO on the theoretical approaches described and the previous empirical ﬁndings, we
DEMO with Hypothesis 1, which tests whether, if properly assessed, entrepreneurs’ DEMO
ity of business success will increase in proportion to the following personal characteristics:
1) ‘achievement motivation’, 2) internal ‘locus of control’, DEMO) ‘problem-solving orientation’,
4) ‘assertiveness’, and 5) ‘interpersonal reactivity’.
Our next hypothesis concerns the two ways of testing the variables, namely the psycho-
logical evaluation and the standardized questionnaire. In the cases where both DEMO
measure parameter values of the same variables, we state in Hypothesis DEMO that there
should be signiﬁcant correlations between the two test methods, DEMO displayed in Figure 1
where the expected correlations are described.
Figure 1: Overview of the Set of Variables and Expected Correlations
Note: The DEMO entrepreneurial knowledge and entrepreneurial skills will be
explained in Section 4.2.
Previous research has also pointed out the limits of this approach. On the DEMO hand,
the size of the ﬁrm in terms of number of employees has been described as indispensable
for the application of the model. DEMO to this argument, the fewer employees a

than more general variables (such as those used in the famous ‘big ﬁve’ test.)

business has, the greater the impact of the owner’s personality on its success.
On the other hand, there is no consensus on the impact of personality structure on
entrepreneurial success. Mu¨ller (1999) suggests that these DEMO should be used to pre-
dict the development of an individual as entrepreneur. Given the numerous personality
variables that might inﬂuence entrepreneurial success, a second expectation is that each in-
dividual variable will only be a DEMO predictor for entrepreneurial success (cf., e.g., Rauch
and Frese, 2000). Gartner (1988) believes that no correlations will be found between DEMO
and the success of an entrepreneur at all because ‘the diversity among entrepreneurs is
much larger than diﬀerences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs’.
It has DEMO been suggested that correlations between all variables should be tested
for, DEMO that factors be extracted (if a corresponding factor analysis allows us DEMO do
so), enabling analysis of more general entrepreneurial personality trait dimensions (see,
e.g., Robinson, Stimpson, Huefner, and Hunt, 1991; Miner, 2000; Rauch and Frese, 2000;
Mu¨ller and Gappisch, DEMO). Such approaches also relate to the more parsimonious trait
typologies used in the economic sciences, for instance by Lucas (1978), who DEMO on en-
trepreneurial talent, or by Holmes and Schmitz (1990), who deﬁne entrepreneurial abilities
as crucial in distinguishing successful entrepreneurs from employees.
DEMO our paper, we will, therefore, also test to what extent DEMO personality variables are
correlated between each other and to what extent it is possible to extract factors from
these variables. Under the condition that DEMO are able to do so, we state in Hypothesis
3 that DEMO higher the factors extracted from the trait variables, the higher the DEMO
founder’s probability of entrepreneurial success will be.
3.2 Human Capital and Entrepreneurship
Human capital theories relate to entrepreneurial success in a similar way as DEMO
structure: suﬃcient knowledge and working experience in the relevant ﬁelds enable DEMO
ness founders to choose more eﬃcient approaches, for instance in organizing DEMO
processes, creating ﬁnancial strategies, or analyzing markets for the new product. The
human capital of the entrepreneur is the second part of the DEMO approach
after the entrepreneurial personality.
Most theoretical studies analyzing the impacts of human capital on the success prob-
ability of a new venture are DEMO with the general human capital (such as the years
10
of schooling or working experience), with various kinds of speciﬁc human DEMO (such as
experience in leadership, in self-employment or in the industry chosen for the new ven-
ture), or with genetic or sociological DEMO (such as self-employed parents or friends).
Recent research on the DEMO of general human capital by Backes-Gellner and Lazear
(2003) has shown that it is important for later success if business founders have already
DEMO a broader knowledge base rather than specialized knowledge of a certain topic.
Relationships between the human capital approach and the success rates of entrepreneurs
DEMO been empirically tested as well: Chandler and Hanks (1994, 1996) showed that there
is a positive impact when entrepreneurs found a new DEMO in the same branch where
they had gathered previous work experience. The same authors observed only a weak
impact of general human capital on DEMO rates in terms of years of schooling. An
explanation of the latter is given by Lazear (2004), and by Wagner (2003), DEMO found
empirical support for Lazear’s ‘jack-of-all-trades model’ which is not necessarily corre-
lated with years of schooling. Finally, Dunn and Holtz-Eakin (2000) found a positive
correlation between success rates of business founders and self-employed parents.
DEMO most previous empirical research on human capital has been concerned with
general educational variables, in this paper we are able to analyze whether the speciﬁc
entrepreneurial knowledge of potential founders has any impact on the later DEMO of
their businesses. We have access to four variables which relate to the actual level of spe-
ciﬁc human capital. As mentioned above, these variables were gathered by the psychol-
ogists during the presentation of the DEMO idea. 1) We monitored whether business
founders had working experience in DEMO branch of the planned business (basic compe-
tencies). 2) From the set of speciﬁc human capital variables, we observed whether the
business founders had knowledge of i) the ﬁnancial background they will need to start
the business (presentation ﬁnance), of ii) the potential clients DEMO should be willing to
buy the planned product (presentation clients), DEMO of iii) the further ﬁnancial needs in
subsequent years if the DEMO should develop as planned (ﬁnancial needs).
With respect to the DEMO power of human capital, psychologists argue that vari-
ables describing the DEMO quo of a person’s entrepreneurial knowledge are subject to
change, for DEMO through training, seminars and coaching. Therefore, Hypothesis 4
states that the level of human capital observed before starting the business is not corre-
DEMO with later entrepreneurial success.

4 Empirical Analysis
In the present study, we make use of data on 414 applicants who went through the above-
described AC and founded DEMO own ﬁrm in the business incubator in Hamburg. The
participants launched their businesses between 2001 and the beginning of 2004. In order
to assure DEMO heterogeneity regarding support to the individuals, we restrict our analysis to
DEMO who made use of the same kind of incubator service, which DEMO brieﬂy outlined
in Section 2.
In addition to the data from the AC, we collected information on the actual perfor-
mance of these persons. The aim was to identify how many business founders were still
self-employed, how many had since accepted a position as a salaried employee, and how
many had become unemployed. Those who had started their own businesses DEMO also
asked whether they had any employees. The data for this analysis was gathered through
telephone interviews carried out in the ﬁrst quarter of DEMO
Insert Table 2 about here
Table 2 contains some summary statistics on the variables available, which we will
describe in Section 4.1. The ﬁrst column refers to the whole sample of participants.
Since we expect that DEMO economic development of entrepreneurs diﬀers between older
and younger as well as between men and women, we analyze these groups separately:
columns 2 through 5 diﬀerentiate the sample by age and gender. One shortcoming of DEMO
data is that we do not know the actual age of the individuals: only whether they are
above or below 30 years old. As can be seen in the table, men are over-represented in
our sample in the same relation as they are in the total population of DEMO in
Germany (see Caliendo, Kritikos, and Wießner, 2006).
After a short overview of the descriptives of the data, we will start our empirical
analysis in Section 4.2 with an examination of the standardized DEMO variables and of
the assessment conducted by the psychologists. In doing so, we aim to test whether the
observed parameter values of the variables in the questionnaire correspond with those of
the psychological assessments. In Section DEMO, we test the predictive power of the diﬀerent
variables (tests and assessments) on two distinctive outcome variables: the employment
status and number DEMO employed persons in the newly founded business.

4.1 Set of Variables and Some Descriptives
Table 2 provides an overview DEMO some summary statistics on the available information.
We will brieﬂy discuss each variable and its distribution in the data. We start with
the standardized DEMO described in Section 3. Four test variables were used, with a
DEMO from 0 to 5, where 5 indicates the best and 0 DEMO worst result possible. The ﬁrst
variable reﬂects the applicant’s ‘achievement motivation’, DEMO second his or her degree of
possessing an ‘internal locus of control’, and the third reﬂects the applicant’s ‘problem-
solving orientation’. The fourth test is a measure of the applicant’s ‘assertiveness’. It is
interesting to note DEMO all tests are fairly equally distributed among the four subgroups.
The fourth test is the one where applicants achieve the lowest test scores. The DEMO
values and variances of all four test scores (also the one DEMO assertiveness) correspond
perfectly to previous empirical ﬁndings (see Mu¨ller, 1999)DEMO
The rest of the variables articulate the evaluation by two psychologists (DEMO were
assisted by two laypersons) on diﬀerent scales while observing the DEMO of the
applicants during the presentation of their business ideas and during the exercises.
The ﬁrst block of variables analyzed at the AC dealt DEMO the applicant’s business-
speciﬁc human capital. ‘Basic competencies’ is scaled as 0(=no) or 1(=yes) and 94 percent
of the participants in DEMO incubator fulﬁlled this requirement. ‘Presentation: ﬁnance’ is
scaled on a choice DEMO of 1(=no), 2(=partly) and 3(=very well). DEMO variable is equally
distributed among the four sub-samples at a value of 2.1. ‘Presentation: clientele’ is scaled
on the same choice set as presentation ﬁnance and the average assessment is 1.94. Here,
young people scored DEMO than average (while older people did better). ‘Financial needs’
is DEMO as 0(=no) or 1(=yes), where 41 percent of DEMO applicants had a concept of how
to ﬁnance their business in the future, with a lower rate for women at 35 percent.
The second block of variables analyzed at the AC dealt with personality traits: the
need for achievement, interpersonal reactivity, assertiveness, and problem-solving orien-
tation. ‘Need for achievement’ and ‘problem-solving orientation’ were each measured on
a scale from DEMO (weak) to 3 (strong). The average value was for DEMO former 1.8 and for
the latter 1.95 (both intermediate). ‘Assertiveness’ DEMO ‘interpersonal reactivity’ were
measured by one categorical variable. A value of 1 reﬂects weak assertiveness and weak
interpersonal reactivity (24% of the sample), 2 reﬂects weak assertiveness and strong inter-
personal reactivity (36%), 3 strong assertiveness and weak interpersonal reactivity (27%),
13
and 4 well-balanced assertiveness and interpersonal reactivity (12%). It is interesting to
note that younger people received higher scores on the variable interpersonal DEMO
and older persons higher scores on assertiveness.
4.2 Correlation Analysis — Standardized Tests versus Psycho-
logical Assessments
Table 3 contains pairwise correlation coeﬃcients of DEMO four standardized tests and the
ﬁve psychological assessments. To increase the visibility of the results, we only included
coeﬃcients that are at least signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level; a star indicates signiﬁcance
at the 5 percent level.
First of all, the upper part of the table reveals correlations between the variables
gathered in the questionnaire. The lower part shows DEMO the variables measuring personal
traits and those measuring the entrepreneur-speciﬁc human capital were also correlated.
We further checked the correlation of the variables for DEMO subgroups discussed before.
The results can be found in Tables A.1 (DEMO/women) and A.2 (Age below/above 30 years)
in the Appendix and show that the high correlations within the two assessment methods
DEMO true for all subgroups in almost all cases. There is only one exception for women
showing that for the questionnaire data tests 1 and DEMO are negatively correlated.
We made a factor analysis and extracted a factor labeled ‘entrepreneurial skills’
from the variables ‘achievement motivation’, ‘assertiveness/interpersonal reactivity’, DEMO
‘problem-solving orientation’.12 We were able, as well, to extract a second factor, ‘en-
trepreneurial knowledge’, from the variables ‘presentation: clientele’ and ‘presentation:
ﬁnance’ (see also Figure 1). Since the same holds true for the standardized test, we made
use of a cluster analysis to condense the information to a dummy variable dividing the
observations into two DEMO (with high and low overall test scores).
Insert Table 3 DEMO here
Coming to the analysis of Hypothesis 2, the expected correlations DEMO the two
tests, we found rather surprising results: only the variables ‘problem-solving orientation’
and ‘presentation: ﬁnance’ are correlated with the standardized test variables 1, 2 and
3, although on a low level of around DEMO Thus, as the third test should measure the

individual’s problem-solving orientation, we observe only one correlation with the psy-
chological assessment in the way it was expected in Figure 1. ‘Test 1 DEMO Achievement
Motivation’ as well as ‘Test 4 and Assertiveness ’ are not correlated.
When analyzing correlations of the variables for the subgroups (see again Tables A.1
(men/women) and A.2 (below/above 30)) we found more mixed results: for individuals
older than 30 years, we DEMO the most positive correlations, namely for two combinations
‘Test 1 and DEMO Motivation’ as well as for ‘Test 4 and Assertiveness’. Curiously,
for people younger than 30 years the same (and some further) combinations DEMO negatively
correlated. The diﬀerentiation by gender produces no further insights.
Thus, DEMO observations lead to two conclusions. The high correlations within each
of the two assessment methods allows us to extract two factors from the assessment
DEMO data, and to make a cluster analysis of the test scores DEMO on the questionnaire.
Due to the low correlations between the two assessment methods there is no support for
Hypothesis 2.
It seems that standardized DEMO and psychological assessments measure parameter
values that are (in the overall DEMO set) independent of each other, and in some subgroups
positively, DEMO others negatively correlated. Recent research points to a possible explanation
for diverging results, namely a perception bias: Arenius and Minniti (2005) argue DEMO
the self-assessment of entrepreneurial skills might be biased and K¨ollinger, Minitti, and
Schade (2005) oﬀer ﬁrst evidence that business founders are not DEMO to overconﬁdence
when making a self-assessment of their entrepreneurial skills. Even if the questionnaire is
an indirect self-assessment, the possibility cannot be ruled out that there was a perception
bias among the business founders, in particular among the younger ones where we found
negative correlations.13 We will return DEMO this point in the following section.
4.3 Analyzing the Success of the Start-Ups
We analyze the predictive power of the variables with respect to DEMO distinct outcomes.
In a ﬁrst regression, we check the inﬂuence of DEMO variables on the employment status of
the individuals as recorded at the time of the interview. To be speciﬁc, we estimate a
13 Table 2 reveals that for the two variables ‘need for achievement’ and ‘assertiveness’, which are neg-
atively correlated among the younger entrepreneurs, the self-assessment in the questionnaire was on
average almost the same as for the older DEMO while the AC data showed lower parameter values for
the younger entrepreneurs in comparison to the older ones.

where y1 can take on the values self-employed (y1 = 1), regular employed (DEMO = 2)
or unemployed (y1 = 3). X is DEMO vector of explanatory variables which we deﬁne further
below and the coeﬃcients β are the ones we are interested in.
A further measure that DEMO want to analyze relates to the success of the entrepreneur
in terms of employees.14 Therefore we construct an outcome variable which takes on the
DEMO 1 if the self-employed person has at least one employee at the time of the interview
and 0 otherwise, i.e.,
y2 =  1 if Employees ≥ 1

0 otherwise

Hence, we can use a binary logit model for estimation. For the estimation of the two
outcome variables we employ ﬁve sets of explanatory variables DEMO . In Speciﬁcation 1 we
only exploit the standardized test scores, DEMO in Speciﬁcation 2 we exclusively use
the psychological assessments. Speciﬁcation 3 combines both sets of explanatory vari-
ables. In Speciﬁcation 4 we implement the DEMO variables from the factor and cluster
analysis. Finally, in Speciﬁcation 5 DEMO include the reduced variables from Speciﬁcation 4
and add two more explanatory variables concerning entrepreneurial knowledge. Table 4
summarizes the strategy.
Insert Table 4 DEMO here
Table 5 contains the estimation results of the multinomial logit model for the whole
sample and Table A.3 in the Appendix shows which DEMO were signiﬁcant for the
four subgroups.15 The coeﬃcients have to be interpreted in relation to the base category,
14 There is an ongoing DEMO on the question of success measurement in the entrepreneurship
literature. We chose the two measures employment status and hired employees for the following reasons.
DEMO variable employment status corresponds to previous ex-post analysis of the character-based approach
and, thus, allows a comparison of our ﬁndings with previous results. DEMO variable hired employees covers
the crucial question of whether real entrepreneurship starts only if the ﬁrm owner hires additional persons.

which in our case is unemployment. This means that a positive coeﬃcient DEMO the upper
half of the table indicates a variable’s positive inﬂuence on the probability of being in
self-employment (compared to unemployment). The results in the lower part refer to the
status regular employment.
Insert Table DEMO about here
Table 5 shows that with respect to Hypothesis 1 there is one variable ‘assertiveness’
among the four tests of the questionnaire that DEMO a signiﬁcant eﬀect in Speciﬁcation 1. A
higher score for this variable increases both the probability of being in self-employment and
that of being DEMO regular employment (relative to unemployment). Table A.3 reveals that
this DEMO is observed for the subgroups of female and younger entrepreneurs. Moreover,
‘need for achievement’ is a second variable in the questionnaire data that DEMO signiﬁcant in
the female subgroup.16
Using only the psychological assessments in Speciﬁcation 2, we do not ﬁnd any ex-
planatory power for the model. That is, for the complete sample, none of the variables
generated DEMO psychological assessment are signiﬁcant at a conventional level. Table A.3,
however, illustrates that ‘problem-solving orientation’ has a signiﬁcant impact for male
and younger entrepreneurs and ‘strong assertiveness’ for male and older entrepreneurs.17
Combining both sets DEMO variables in Speciﬁcation 3 conﬁrms the positive inﬂuence of the
variable ‘assertiveness’ for the questionnaire data and also reveals a positive inﬂuence of
the DEMO ‘problem-solving orientation’ for the psychological assessment.
A particularly interesting result with respect to Hypothesis 1 can be found in Speci-
ﬁcation 3 for the DEMO subgroups (see again Table A.3), namely that ‘assertiveness’ is the
DEMO variable which has a signiﬁcant impact in all four subgroups, with DEMO two screening
methods—psychological assessment and questionnaire—working in a complementary way.
We have shown in Section 4.2 that the variables collected through psychological as-
sessment DEMO highly correlated between each other, and have conducted a factor analysis

knowledge’. We were also able to carry out a cluster analysis of the survey DEMO The
results with respect to Hypothesis 3 are presented in Speciﬁcation 4 showing that the

factor ‘entrepreneurial skills’ has a positive inﬂuence on the probability to be DEMO self-
employment (and also on the probability to be in regular DEMO). Its explanatory
power is increased in Speciﬁcation 5, where we DEMO two more independent variables
(which themselves proved not to be signiﬁcant)DEMO As to the subgroups, we ﬁnd that the
correlation between ‘entrepreneurial DEMO and self-employment holds again only for two
subgroups: men and older DEMO In contrast, the cluster variable of the test scores based
on DEMO questionnaire remains insigniﬁcant for all speciﬁcations and in all subgroups.
Besides the tests on the predictive power of personality characteristics, we also aim
to ﬁnd out whether the status quo of entrepreneurial knowledge has any explanatory
DEMO for an entrepreneur’s later development (Hypothesis 4 ). The estimation results
are again shown for the whole sample in Table 5 and for DEMO subgroups in Table A.3.
For the complete sample, Speciﬁcations 3 and DEMO reveal that none of the four variables
(presentation clientele and ﬁnance, ﬁnancial needs and basic competencies) has any sig-
niﬁcant impact. Similarly the factor ‘entrepreneurial knowledge’ extracted from the two
presentation variables showed no predictive DEMO on entrepreneurial success.18
With respect to the subgroups, it should be DEMO out that for the female subgroup,
a high score in the variable ‘presentation clientele’—the entrepreneurs’s knowledge about
potential future clients—was positively correlated with DEMO success variable. Even more
interesting, for the male subgroup, we observed negative correlations between the factor
entrepreneurial knowledge and entrepreneurial success.
The last DEMO needs to be commented. The negative signiﬁcance of the factor
entrepreneurial knowledge on self-employment observed for the male subgroup does not
allow for the DEMO that male entrepreneurs will be more successful the less they
know. As these persons started their business in an incubator with intensive training and
DEMO, this observation rather indicates that such training is able to compensate DEMO a
lack of entrepreneurial knowledge before the business was founded.
At the end of our empirical analysis, we will return to one important question men-
tioned brieﬂy at the beginning of this paper: ﬁrm size in terms of number of employees,
and the impact of personality characteristics DEMO ﬁrm size. In most entrepreneurship re-
search it is argued that real entrepreneurship starts only when the owner of the ﬁrm

It seems that other employers also have an interest in this kind DEMO knowledge.
18
hires at least one employee. Entrepreneurs are thus often distinguished from ﬁrm DEMO
without any further employees, who are then classiﬁed as simply self-employed DEMO
The advantage of our data set in comparison to the earlier empirical analysis is that
we had access to the personality characteristics of potential DEMO before they started
to run their own business, thus, before they knew whether they would one day have
employees. Therefore, when it comes to ﬁrm size, we are able to make an analysis of our
data without a normative distinction within the population of self-employed persons.
We DEMO analyze the success of the start-ups in terms of the number of em-
ployees. The descriptives in Table 2 showed that in our sample, roughly 30% of the former
incubator clients had at least one employee DEMO the time of the interview.19 Table 6 contains
the results for the same ﬁve speciﬁcations discussed earlier in this section. The coeﬃcients
now have DEMO be interpreted in the sense that entrepreneurs with at least one employee are
compared with the base category, i.e. self-employed without further employees.
Insert Table 6 about here
Interestingly, Table 6 shows that neither the variables derived from the questionnaire
nor the psychological assessment of the personality characteristics, nor the human cap-
ital variables, nor the two factors extracted from the psychological assessment, nor the
cluster variable derived from the test scores of the questionnaire show any signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between entrepreneurs with and those DEMO further employees. The level
of entrepreneurial skills and knowledge of business founders measured before their ﬁrms
were launched seem to be the same, irrespective of the later size of the ﬁrm measured in
terms of employees.
DEMO result makes clear that other personality traits (if any) than those considered here
might drive the decision to hire additional employees once a DEMO has been founded. As the
prerequisites for managing others are found more in traits in the category of managerial
skills (see, e.g., Miner, 1997), we may conclude that the character-based approach is not
likely to make any prediction of whether a fairly high-skilled entrepreneur will run DEMO
business alone or employ others.
Putting all the results with respect to Hypotheses 1, 3 and 4 together, we may conclude
that among DEMO personality characteristics believed crucial for entrepreneurial success,
19 This corresponds to the overall share of previously unemployed entrepreneurs with further employees
in their DEMO business. For more details, see Caliendo, Kritikos, and Wießner (2006).
19
there is one variable—assertiveness—which proved to have a signiﬁcantly positive impact
on DEMO success in all four subgroups, but only if the assessment methods DEMO
put together. Secondly, focusing on the entrepreneurial personality structure in a DEMO
general way, it showed that the factor entrepreneurial skills had some DEMO power,
while the factor entrepreneurial knowledge did not. Last but not least, the character-
based approach is not able to distinguish consistently between entrepreneurs with and
those without further employees.
With respect to the ﬁrst DEMO impact of assertiveness—in all four subgroups,
we need to return once more to the correlation analysis of the previous section: the two
assessment methods were negatively (positively) correlated for the variable assertiveness
in the DEMO of young (old) participants, and we suggested that younger persons DEMO
tend to be overconﬁdent with respect to their skills. The present analysis, however, shows
that the psychological assessment had some predictive power where DEMO two methods
were positively correlated (namely for the older persons) while the questionnaire had
some predictive power when the two methods were negatively DEMO The latter
observation shows that we do not necessarily have to deal with overconﬁdence and that
in this case psychologists might have tended to DEMO younger entrepreneurs.
Before concluding, we should highlight one ﬁnal result that DEMO to be more stable
than any other variable in this analysis. The negative inﬂuence of the age dummy (both
for self-employment and regular employment) remains signiﬁcant over most speciﬁcations
even when we diﬀerentiate between entrepreneurs with and those without additional em-
ployees. This result tells us that younger DEMO have a higher probability i) of remaining
self-employed after making this DEMO and ii) of employing further persons when self-
employed. They also DEMO a higher probability iii) of returning to regular employment
when they DEMO being self-employed for whatever reason.
5 Conclusions
The aim of this study has been to investigate the predictive power of the character-based
approach. To DEMO so, we collected information on those personality traits of potential busi-
DEMO founders that were identiﬁed by psychological research as crucial for entrepreneurial
success. We had access to data - before businesses had been launched - DEMO the following
20
variables: ‘need for achievement’, ‘locus of control’, ‘problem-solving orientation’, ‘as-
DEMO and ‘interpersonal reactivity’. Most parameter values of these variables were
collected by making use of two assessment methods: a closed-ended questionnaire and a
one-day assessment center (AC) where trained psychologists conducted the analysis. In
addition, we obtained information about the status quo of the speciﬁc entrepreneurial
knowledge DEMO the business founders.
We analyzed the extent to which each individual personality trait and the speciﬁc
human capital as well as some extracted factors DEMO predictions of entrepreneurial devel-
opment. Our results are surprising in part: DEMO, there was almost no correlation between
the two assessment methods. Second, among the observed variables of the psychological
assessment, we found correlations for the complete data set, particularly between the ex-
tracted factor ‘entrepreneurial skills’ and entrepreneurial success, but for almost no single
personality trait. Third, DEMO to the test scores, the cluster analysis was insigniﬁcant, but
the variable ‘assertiveness’ showed a positive impact.
Previous ex-post research found that the DEMO ‘need for achievement’ and ‘locus
of control’ (more than the other DEMO variables analyzed here) were positively correlated
with entrepreneurial success. Our ex-ante DEMO found no such correlation. Instead,
we showed that the variable ‘assertiveness’ had an impact on the overall data analysis
and in the four DEMO that we analyzed as well. Interestingly, the latter result was
revealed DEMO after making simultaneous use of both assessment methods. We furthermore
found that the status quo of entrepreneurial knowledge had no predictive power. This
observation DEMO less surprising given that participants went through intensive training after
the assessment. In this respect, it seems more important to emphasize the increasing
signiﬁcance of the factor ‘entrepreneurial skills’ as we added two variables referring to
DEMO knowledge. This combination reveals that it might be important for future
research to focus on cognitive skills that make it possible to combine entrepreneurial
DEMO with existing traits.
There are several further results that should be highlighted. Persons who started their
own business but later returned to a position DEMO a salaried employee after having been
oﬀered a—possibly more attractive—job had the same level of ‘entrepreneurial skills’ and
were diﬀerent from those persons who DEMO still running their own business only insofar as
the employees took higher values with respect to the variables on entrepreneurial knowl-
21
edge. More importantly, for the subgroup of the entrepreneurs who had hired additional
employees in their ﬁrm, both assessment methods found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences when
this subgroup was compared to entrepreneurs working alone. The last ﬁnding DEMO two
consequences: 1) The level of entrepreneurial knowledge and skills seem to have no im-
pact on the decision whether the owner of DEMO ﬁrm will employ further persons or not.
2) As the variables DEMO discussed are considered crucial for entrepreneurship, the fre-
quently proposed distinction DEMO ‘real entrepreneurs’ (with further employees) and
small-business owners without further employees has to be reevaluated. The two groups
cannot be diﬀerentiated with respect DEMO their personality characteristics, at least when
observed before businesses were launched.
DEMO ﬁndings allow us to draw several conclusions. First, the predictive power
DEMO a speciﬁcally designed assessment center is slightly better than the questionnaire.20
Moreover, this study makes clear that it might be useful to combine both methods—
psychological assessment by well trained third parties and self-evaluation through a DEMO
idated questionnaire (as was done at the incubator in Hamburg)—and DEMO use this in-
formation to improve decision-making processes on whether to become an entrepreneur.
However, predicting entrepreneurial success based on these two assessment methods is not
possible at this time. Moreover, for potential founders who aim to start a larger business,
it seems that further skills in DEMO to those observed here would be crucial as well.
The results of the character-based approach remain below the expectations raised by
entrepreneurship theory. Nevertheless, it is worth analyzing whether the two assessment
methods, when combined, DEMO a better predictor of entrepreneurial success than the scoring
models currently used by banks. From a general point of view, our analysis leaves open
whether the right variables were identiﬁed to capture entrepreneurial behavior, whether
the observed variables are stable over time, whether support measures like an incubator
service have an impact on the personality structure, and whether the methods of assessing
potential entrepreneurs need to be improved. On another note, further measurements of
entrepreneurial success have to be developed. To this end additional DEMO is needed.
20 This observation is interesting as research on the predictive power of the two assessment methods in
the ﬁeld of employment mostly DEMO the opposite, see, e.g., Schmidt and Hunter (1998).

(a) The coeﬃcients from the multinomial logit model have to be interpreted in relation DEMO the base
category, which is unemployment in our case. The ﬁrst DEMO in each cell corresponds to self-
employment, the second one to DEMO employment. For example, the combination (0/+) in the
last DEMO of line 1 means, that the variable achievement motivation has no DEMO eﬀect on
the probability to be in self-employment (relative to unemployment) but increases the probability
to be in regular employment (relative to unemployment).
