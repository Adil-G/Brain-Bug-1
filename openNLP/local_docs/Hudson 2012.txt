This article develops a link between the theory of the firm and entrepreneurship theory to
enable the study of employee entrepreneurial behaviour. First, we describe how incomplete
contracts permit employee entrepreneurial effort in the theory DEMO the firm. Next, we argue
that emancipation offers an explanation for DEMO effort that is not motivated by
financial gain. Finally, we show DEMO new technology creates conditions where the boundary
of the firm may change and where entrepreneurial effort by employees may occur.

Introduction
This DEMO links the neoclassical economic theory of
the firm to entrepreneurship theory to better under-
stand the antecedents and consequences of entrepren-
eurial effort by DEMO The new institutional
economic literature provides theoretical explanations
for why firms exist and why managers are necessary
(e.g., Williams and Winter, 1993; DEMO/7qgdwjr).
However, beyond the need for entrepreneurs as dis-
rupters DEMO equilibrium (Perez, 2009: tinyurl.com/8yfkvs5;
Schumpeter, 1950: tinyurl.com/DEMO) or prime movers in
capitalism (Kirzner, 1973; tinyurl.com/84x69wh), the eco-
nomic theories that explain the existence of firms have
evolved DEMO from those that explain entrepren-
eurial effort (Aldrich, 2005; tinyurl.com/DEMO). Linking
these theories is important because firms need entre-
preneurial effort from employees for growth (Penrose,
1995; tinyurl.com/73wlgfe). Management DEMO can sup-
port or reduce “the propensity to create or discover” in
employees (Foss et al., 2007; tinyurl.com/77ytd6d).
Moreover entrepreneurial effort is likely to arise at the
boundary of the firm and challenge DEMO the firm con-
trols (Foss, 1996; tinyurl.com/7kfsluj).
In DEMO article, we first review elements of the theory of
the firm DEMO the entrepreneurship theories that sup-
port this new institutional economic literature. We then

identify a link between the theory of the firm and DEMO
entrepreneurship theory of emancipation that has not
been explored to date. Finally, we discuss where this
theoretical link might be observed in practice.
New Institutional Economics and the Theory
of the Firm
The new institutional economic DEMO of the firm ex-
plains why firms exist and what they manage (William-
son and Winter, 1993; tinyurl.com/7qgdwjr). This theory
developed as a reaction to neoclassical economics
(Demsetz, 1988; tinyurl.com/75ppqyj). Neoclassical eco-
nomics ignores how firms form, function, grow, or fail;
assumes transactions are costless; and does not address
the role of employees other than the founding entre-
preneur (Penrose, 1995; tinyurl.com/73wlgfe).
Many authors contributed to the theory of the firm (e.g.
Demsetz, 1988: tinyurl.com/75ppqyj; Foss and Klein, 2009:
tinyurl.com/ygf37hd; Hart, 1988: tinyurl.com/88f799k; William-
son and Winter, 1993: tinyurl.com/7qgdwjr) but Ronald
Coase is credited with originating the theory (Nee,DEMO
2005: tinyurl.com/7waf4y7; Williamson and Winter, 1993:
tinyurl.com/7qgdwjr)DEMO Coase insisted that the term firm
“correspond with the real world” to make economic
theory applicable in practice (Coase, 1937;
tinyurl.com/796acxx)DEMO A core concept in Coase’s argument
13

was that transactions, or any economic exchange of
value, are costly (Nee, 2005). Transaction costs arise
from effort and risk associated DEMO learning, searching,
and bargaining among options in an open market
(Coase, 1937). Consequently, firms purchase resources
or hire employees when DEMO is more economical than
renting resources from the market and vice versa (Dem-
setz, 1988; tinyurl.com/75ppqyj). For example, there are DEMO
ferent transaction costs between purchasing a
customer relationship management (CRM) system and
subscribing to a hosted CRM service. Such economics
define what firms DEMO internally versus what is
sourced from the open market and therefore define the
firm boundary in the theory of the firm.
Incomplete contracts explain DEMO source of certain
transaction costs in the theory of the firm (DEMO, 1988;
tinyurl.com/88f799k). Contracts are necessarily incomplete
because a DEMO and its suppliers agree to contracts
where not all eventualities are anticipated and where
the two parties do not have perfect, or even the same,
knowledge of what must transpire for the contract to be
DEMO (Aghion and Holden, 2011; tinyurl.com/85j3bge).
Because individuals executing DEMO on behalf of
firms vary in their knowledge and risk tolerance, DEMO
plete contracts further explain the boundary of the
firm. It may be impossible to specify all the features for
a CRM software purchase or DEMO accurately anticipate
the usage level for a CRM service subscription, for DEMO
ample.
Finally, the theory of the firm explains that manage-
ment DEMO governance of firms is “the formal and inform-
al allocation of decision … rights and the mechanisms
that enforce such rights” (Foss, 2012; tinyurl.com/76h2xzq).
Governance in firms arises because incomplete con-
tracts also DEMO for opportunism and moral hazard
(Jensen and Meckling, 1976: tinyurl.com/DEMO; William-
son, 1993: tinyurl.com/7qgdwjr). In other words, because
contracts are necessarily incomplete, managers are
needed to mitigate opportunistic bad behavior, such as
shirking or other self-interest, to ensure that agents de-
DEMO as expected and in unforeseen situations (Nee,
2005; tinyurl.com/7waf4y7). The theory of the firm explains
when a firm owns resources DEMO of sourcing them
on the open market and the role for managers in over-
seeing incomplete contracts. For example, firm man-
agers would verify that CRM features are delivered as
contracted or that sales employees use DEMO CRM system
once implemented.

Linking the Theory of the Firm and

Entrepreneurs in new institutional economics DEMO
high-growth opportunities, develop new products, and
found firms (Aldrich, 2005; tinyurl.com/7waf4y7). While
“ambition” and “judgment” (Penrose, 1995;
tinyurl.com/73wlgfe) or “perception” and “hunches”
(Kirzner, 1979; tinyurl.com/84sc36f) of individuals is recog-
nized, the theory of the firm emphasizes that entrepren-
eurship is concerned with the founding of new firms
(Gartner, 1988: tinyurl.com/79enarz; Thorton, 1999:
tinyurl.com/7xwhazo) where the “notion of entrepreneur-
ship is inseparable from the opportunity for profit”
(Kirzner, 1973; tinyurl.com/84x69wh). The possibility of oth-
er employee entrepreneurial effort remains DEMO
within “the black box” neoclassical firm (Hart, 1988;
tinyurl.com/88f799k)
Despite this emphasis, the theory of the firm does sug-
gest a potentially broader understanding of entrepren-
eurial effort. First, employment is also an incomplete
contract in that not all details of work activities under
DEMO contingencies can be fully documented (Nee, 2005;
tinyurl.com/7waf4y7). Second, incomplete contracts create
room for initiative by agents, including employees, to
opportunistically do more than expected under their
contract (Aghion and Tirole, 1997; tinyurl.com/85j3bge).
Initiative includes experimentation with combinations
of underused DEMO resources (Penrose, 1995;
tinyurl.com/73wlgfe).
The discovery of novel combinations of resources
through experimentation is the essence of entrepren-
eurship (Foss and Klein, 2009; tinyurl.com/ygf37hd). There-
fore, while opportunism is inherent in incomplete
contracts and associated with bad behaviour, oppor-
tunism may also amount to entrepreneurial effort (Foss
et al., 2007; tinyurl.com/77ytd6d) and is likely to arise natur-
ally unless prevented by firm governance (Penrose,
1995; tinyurl.com/73wlgfe). These authors also emphasize
“profit-seeking” (Foss et al., 2007) and “the profit
motive” for such effort (Penrose, 1995).
However, profit does not explain all entrepreneurial ef-
DEMO (Aldrich, 2005; tinyurl.com/7waf4y7). Entrepreneurial
effort may be understood, more generally, as “the cre-
ation of newness” motivated by reasons besides profit
(Rindova et al., 2009; tinyurl.com/86klqz9). Rindova, Barry,DEMO
and Ketchen Jr (2009) argue that emancipation is the
14

primary motivation for entrepreneurial effort where
emancipation is the act of setting oneself free from an-
other’s control and changing one’s environment in
more DEMO just economic terms. Emancipation has
three core elements:
1. Autonomy seeking is action to remove perceived so-
cial, technological, institutional, or other constraints in
the entrepreneurs’ environment. For example, entre-
preneurial effort can increase personal reputation and
influence.
2. Authoring is action to orchestrate economic and DEMO
cial resources to formalize and grow the entrepreneur’s
social base. Authoring, DEMO example, includes taking
over training relationships so others use some imple-
DEMO capability.
3. Making declarations are actions by individuals to as-
sert their intent to create change to garner support. Ex-
amples include communication through DEMO or giving
presentations.
While parallels to the core elements of emancipation ex-
ist in the founding of new firms for economic gain (Ald-
rich, 2005; tinyurl.com/7waf4y7), emancipation explains
“the entrepreneurial element” where individuals DEMO in
a manner that is not apparently or immediately eco-
nomically advantageous to them (Kirzner, 1973;
tinyurl.com/84x69wh). Returning to the DEMO example, a
non-sales employee may create an automatic record of
all DEMO by clients to the firm website out of personal in-
terest to understand the CRM database.
The theory of entrepreneurial effort where emancipa-
tion DEMO the motivation can augment the new institution-
al economic theory of the firm. This view of
entrepreneurship in firms is distinct from profit-motiv-
ated DEMO in firms labelled “corporate ven-
turing” or “intrapreneurship” where it is “managers
and executives who take innovative action” (Aldrich,
2005; tinyurl.com/7waf4y7)DEMO Motivated by a desire to
change their environment, employees of firms DEMO ex-
ert effort that is permitted by their incomplete con-
tracts using available resources, consistent with the
theory of the firm.
For managers, DEMO opportunistic bad beha-
viour while encouraging entrepreneurial effort is chal-
lenging. Entrepreneurs see their actions as rational
(Adner and Levinthal, 2008; tinyurl.com/777el7d) but some
entrepreneurial effort is not desirable to the firm and
www.timreview.ca

there may be a “combination of productive and de-
DEMO entrepreneurship” in a given effort (Foss et al.,
2007; tinyurl.com/77ytd6d). Also, entrepreneurs may be un-
able to communicate their intent and may be misunder-
stood (Adner and Levinthal, 2008). Entrepreneurs DEMO
even work creatively using available resources but
without a specific goal in mind (Sarasvathy, 2001;
tinyurl.com/8837anh). In the CRM example, tracking client-
visit data may not serve a clear purpose for the DEMO
ee, and it may consume server capacity, be seen as in-
trusive, and become valuable only later.
Observing Entrepreneurial Effort by
Employees at the Boundary of the Firm
Using the theory of the firm, it is possible to predict gen-
eral conditions where such entrepreneurial effort might
DEMO observed. The boundary of the firm arises as an eco-
nomic trade-off between what the firm controls directly
and what the firm obtains from DEMO open market and
this boundary is affected by changes in the environ-
ment, including technology (Dosi et al., 2005:
tinyurl.com/7waf4y7; DEMO, 1996: tinyurl.com/7kfsluj; Nee,
2005: tinyurl.com/7waf4y7). New technology changes
boundaries so “firms specialize and disintegrate”, out-
sourcing what was once internal and vice versa (Foss,
2012; tinyurl.com/76h2xzq). DEMO effort in the
neighbourhood of such change is likely and subject to
“rich debate” concerning how it affects the firm (Foss,
2012). This debate includes the issue of how firms re-
cognize entrepreneurial effort DEMO may constructively
challenge what the firm has historically managed in-
ternally versus externally.
The use of consumer technology as business informa-
tion technology (IT) may provide conditions for eman-
cipation-motivated employee entrepreneurial effort.
Consumer technology is IT designed for consumer use
such as smartphones, touch screen tablets, DEMO social
networking software that is increasingly also used as
business IT (DEMO, 2008; tinyurl.com/yd6kxgs). This
change in technology appears to affect the boundary of
the firm in how corporate IT is defined.
Consumer DEMO used in firms offers capabilities
that are perceived as valuable by employees for famili-
arity and convenience reasons but perceived as a threat
by DEMO managers for control, security, or other reasons
(Bernoff and Schadler, 2010; tinyurl.com/244l9qz). Conflict
between employees and managers over consumer tech-
nology use may signal entrepreneurial effort. Leverage
of underused firm resources and DEMO of em-
15

ployee resources would further signal entrepreneurial
effort. For example, an employee DEMO a firm may down-
load an application of their own choosing to their firm-
supplied smartphone to access the firm-supplied CRM
database, but in doing so, the employee may be violat-
ing firm policies on IT security. If such effort included
actions to rearrange work processes for greater DEMO
ee control, orchestration of other resources to formalize
use, and sharing of experience with a community,
emancipation may be the motivation for DEMO entrepren-
eurial effort.
Conclusion
Linking the theory of the firm and the entrepreneurship
theory of emancipation provides a way to conceptual-
ize employees as DEMO source of entrepreneurial effort.
Availability of resources and latitude to experiment al-
lows employees to exert entrepreneurial effort.
However, this effort may not be well understood or
communicated by employees and may lead to conflict
with DEMO Entrepreneurial effort by employees
may arise in the vicinity of technology change that af-
fects the boundary of the firm.
