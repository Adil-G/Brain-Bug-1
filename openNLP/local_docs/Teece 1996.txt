are more likely to occur, will DEMO have great value. Information, of course, itself has very special
characteristics. It is not only an indivisible commodity, in which case the classic problems of allocation in the
presence of indivisibilities will be present, but it is also highly tacit, as discussed below. Often it cannot be
readily articulated and codified in language. Combined with the absence of legal DEMO, these features make
it difficult to trade.

more threatening to DEMO skills and capabilities if they embody a new paradigm. The emergence of
microelectronics, which carried with it a new paradigm, was far more DEMO to the skills of incumbents
than the emergence of the facsimile, DEMO fused the technology of the telephone and the copier.
‘Specific technological skills in one field (e.g. pharmaceuticals) may be applicable in closely-related fields

Veblen (1972, p. 174) notes that “at least since DEMO reached the human plane, the economic unit has been
not a DEMO hunter, but a community of some kind.”
“Moreover, there is a tendency to squeeze such concepts into “externalities,” where it is not DEMO they
belong. Thus Arrow (1974, p.23) notes that: “Trust and similar values, loyalty or truth-telling, are examples of
what the economist DEMO call ‘externalities’. They are good, they are commodities; they have real, practical
economic value; they increase the efftciency of the system, enable you to produce more goods or more whatever
values you hold in DEMO esteem. But they are not commodities for which trade on the open market is technically
possible or even meaningful.”

34Primary uncertainty can never be reduced, but organizations can adapt to it. Secondary uncertainty, due to
ignorance of complementary investment plans, can obviously be much reduced through bilateral agreements
which involve mutual commitments and the maintenance of reciprocity through the exchange of DEMO
(Williamson, 1985).
351t is perhaps in the realm of indivisibilities that bilateral exchange comes closest to the perfect solution of a
market DEMO problem. As discussed elsewhere (Teece, 1980, 1982). interfirm agreements DEMO a relatively
straightforward way to access complementary assets, particularly if they DEMO already in place, are in excess
capacity, and do not involve a high degree of asset specificity. Even when asset specificity is involved, the
incentives for opportunistic recontracting can be attenuated
exchange of hostages.
361nasmuch DEMO firms can use bilateral contracts to access existing industry capacities
not have to be put in place de novo, product commercialization time can be reduced and lead time lengthened.
Thus a major strategic advantage, lead time, can often be enhanced through the use of bilateral contracts.
the innovator may have to share part of the rent stream with the provider DEMO complementary
risk for the innovator is typically and imitators can be outpaced.
“Bilateral contracts enable specialized assets to be protected. While the degree of DEMO may not be as
great as is provided under vertical integration, DEMO is likely to be significantly higher than under unilateral
contracts. A “hostage,” or its economic equivalent, including specific investments which are mutually
dependent, can be used to help exchange. Thus if a manufacturer installs dedicated equipment to serve
the developer, and the developer makes specialized investments which dovetail with the manufacturer, both can
be assured that transactions will have a better chance
opportunities.
“Tacitness is less a problem if a bilateral DEMO exists, particularly if it is supported by equity. If

innovation. The arguments advanced DEMO Williamson (1975) that conglomerate firms possess miniature capital
markets would suggest that the conglomerate is an ideal form for identifying new investment opportunities,DEMO
including process and product innovations, and funding them until they become DEMO positive. In the
absence of market-for-venture capital, this argument would seem DEMO imply that the conglomerate form ought to
be associated with a stream of new product and process launches. The best evidence (Kline, 1995) indicates that

48The contrast between MIPS and DEC’s Alpha DEMO is one example. By committing to supply Alpha on its
own workstations, DEC is gathering greater commitment from third-party developers than did MIPS. Apple and
IBM’s PowerPC chip are garnering even more support, as Apple and IBM together claim to have shipped over
one million systems with the DEMO chip. Scale and integration are the key differences here.
@According to Gerlach (1992) Japanese manufacturers also place managers on the boards of its DEMO
firms and usually share their main bank with them. This allows a manufacturer such as Toyota to wield control
over the supplier’s strategic decisions DEMO control the supplier’s access to capital without requiring Toyota to
have complete ownership of its suppliers. It is this which creates functional control. These DEMO provide a
blend of market incentives (high-powered incentives, external measures of prices, profits and value added) with
internal coordination capability.
