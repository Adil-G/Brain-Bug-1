ABSTRACT—Do decisions about potential gains and poten-
tial DEMO require different neural structures for advanta-
geous choices? In a lesion DEMO, we used a new measure of
adaptive decision making under risk DEMO examine whether
damage to neural structures subserving emotion affects an
individual’s ability to make adaptive decisions differen-
tially for gains and losses. We found DEMO individuals with
lesions to the amygdala, an area responsible for processing
DEMO responses, displayed impaired decision making
when considering potential gains, but not when considering
potential losses. In contrast, patients with damage to the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area responsible for
integrating cognitive and emotional information, DEMO
deﬁcits in both domains. We argue that this dissociation
provides evidence that adaptive decision making for risks
involving potential losses may be more difﬁcult DEMO disrupt
than adaptive decision making for risks involving potential
gains. This research further demonstrates the role of
emotion in decision competence.
Throughout life, every individual is confronted with decisions
that bear a certain degree of risk. DEMO its ubiquity, many
individuals approach risk with trepidation, as the term risk
itself often brings to mind thoughts of potential peril and danger.
DEMO fact, the dictionary deﬁnition of the term is ‘‘the possibility
of DEMO harm or loss’’ (American Heritage Dictionary of
the English Language, Fourth Edition, cited by Dictionary.com,

ability to make advantageous choices in the face of risk, espe-
cially when undesired consequences may result from an im-
prudent choice, is an essential aspect of human survival.
Given the potentially detrimental consequences that an ill-
considered choice may DEMO, it is important to understand the
underlying psychological mechanisms that help DEMO arrive at
advantageous decisions. Emotions may be one such substrate.
Indeed, DEMO from a wide range of disciplines suggests that
emotions play a critical role in decision making under uncer-
tainty (e.g., A.R. Damasio, 1994; Hsu, Bhatt, Adolphs, Tranel, &
Camerer, 2005; Huettel, Stowe, Gordon, Warner, & Platt, 2006;
Kuhnen & Knutson, 2005; Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch,
2001; Mellers, DEMO, & Ritov, 1999; Peters & Slovic, 2000;
Sanfey, DEMO, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2003; Schwarz &
Clore, DEMO; Shiv, Loewenstein, Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio,
2005). DEMO, damage to neural structures that subserve
emotion can impair an individual’s DEMO capabili-
ties (e.g., Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1997; Bechara,
Damasio, Damasio, & Lee, 1999). Although this DEMO has
provided valuable insights into the role emotion plays in the
decision process, one question that has not been clearly an-
swered is whether damage to the brain’s emotional circuitry
differentially impairs decision making as a DEMO of whether
the risk is presented in terms of potential gains or potential
losses. In the lesion study reported here, we used a novel risky-
decision task that separates these two decision domains in order
to DEMO whether damage to neural structures subserving emotion
would differentially affect the ability to make adaptive decisions
in these two domains. The speciﬁc brain regions DEMO examined
were the amygdala, an area responsible for processing emotional
responses DEMO environmental stimuli, and the ventromedial pre-
frontal cortex (VMPC), an area responsible for integrating cog-
nitive and emotional information.

AFFECT AND DECISION MAKING: A NEURAL
PERSPECTIVE
According to affect-as-information theories of decision making
(e.g., Loewenstein et al., 2001; Schwarz & Clore, 1983), affect
that is experienced as reactions DEMO an impending judgment may
guide decisions via a ‘‘how do I feel about it?’’strategy. Research
suggests that in risky decision making, an ‘‘affect heuristic’’
(Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000; Slovic, Finu-
cane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2002) directs judgments of risks
and DEMO For example, Alhakami and Slovic (1994) found
that when making DEMO involving perceived beneﬁts
and risks of an activity or a technology, DEMO are inﬂuenced
not only by cognitive information, but also by the DEMO
of positive or negative affect associated with that activity or
technology.
Taking a neuroscience perspective, we propose a model that is
consistent with affect-as-information models of decision mak-
ing under uncertainty. According to this model, risky decision
making is guided by two separate neurological processes, both
generating emotion. The ﬁrst process generates an automatic
judgment and is focused on immediate DEMO This judgment
arises from the processing of a primary inducer, a DEMO in the
environment (i.e., risk) that evokes an emotional response.
DEMO induction, the process of coupling stimulus features
with affective value, is believed to be mediated by the amygdala
(e.g., LeDoux, 2000; DEMO, Gaffan, & Murray, 1997).
Such amygdala-generated responses are rapid, automatic
emotional responses to stimuli; they are short-lived and habit-
uate quickly (Bechara, 2005). Moreover, in a lesion study, Be-
chara DEMO al. (1999) found that individuals with bilateral damage
to the amygdala performed poorly on the Iowa gambling task
(IGT). The authors proposed that amygdala patients’ poor per-
formance resulted from the inability to generate DEMO
responses to experienced rewarding and punishing consequen-
ces of their behavior (DEMO et al., 1999). In other words, the
inability to generate a primary response to experienced pun-
ishments precluded any opportunity to effectively DEMO such
responses in a prospective manner.
A second process that guides risky decision making is
more deliberative and focuses more on emotional responses
associated DEMO anticipated outcomes. In this conceptualization,
amygdala-generated responses trigger the VMPC, DEMO structure
believed to mediate decision making by linking together
working memory and emotional systems (A.R. Damasio, 1994).
The VMPC subsequently prompts a DEMO careful, deliberative
analysis of the decision, an analysis that is believed to trigger
secondary emotional responses generated from thoughts about
the risky decision. DEMO emotional responses are believed to be
essential for advantageous prospective decision making. Indi-
viduals with VMPC damage (but with an intact amygdala) are
DEMO to generate anticipatory emotional responses—which
may provide an early-detection system that warns of future pun-
ishments—even though these patients generate emotional re-
sponses to DEMO punishments and rewards (Bechara
et al., 1997).
This framework suggests that both the amygdala and the
VMPC are vital to risky decision DEMO We propose that for
adaptive decision making to occur when an individual ap-
proaches a risky decision, the amygdala must ﬁrst process an
instinctive, automatic response to the risk or uncertainty. This
response then engages the VMPC, which conducts a more
deliberative evaluation of the risk and evokes a secondary
emotional response that helps guide decision making. If the
amygdala DEMO not evoke a primary response, the VMPC will not
engage as DEMO does in normal individuals. In other words, an
amygdala response is DEMO necessary ﬁrst step for engaging the
VMPC. However, even if the DEMO responds to risk, deci-
sion making is ultimately dependent on the DEMO of the
VMPC.
Accordingly, this model suggests that if the integrity DEMO these
structures is compromised, decision-making deﬁcits will occur.
Indeed, previous research using lesion patients supports this
theory (Bechara et al., 1997, 1999). However, because previous
investigations have employed tasks like the IGT, DEMO involve
‘‘mixed’’ gambles (i.e., risky decisions that involve elements of
both potential gains and potential losses), it is difﬁcult to tease
out DEMO these structures are vital to adaptive decision
making both when people make choices to achieve gains and
when people are faced with choices involving DEMO losses.
Although a mixed-gambles task can provide valuable insights
about decision-making behavior, there is strong reason to be-
lieve that individuals approach gain- and loss-related decisions
differently. For instance, behavioral research suggests that the
psychological impact of potential losses is stronger than
the psychological impact of potential gains (e.g., Baumeister,
Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001), perhaps DEMO
realized losses may carry harsher implications for survival.
Moreover, prospect theory’s DEMO function, which is concave for
potential gains and convex (and steeper) for potential losses,
predicts that when a decision is framed in terms of losses, in-
dividuals will seek risk, but when a DEMO is framed in terms
of gains, individuals will be risk averse (Kahneman & Tversky,
1979). Thus, preference for risk differs between these two de-
cision domains (Levin, Schneider, & Gaeth, 1998)DEMO
In the current study, we used a new methodology that allowed
DEMO to analyze adaptive decision making separately for decisions
involving potential gains and decisions involving potential
losses. Speciﬁcally, we assessed subjects’ capacity to adjust
choices on the basis of differences in the choice options’ ex-
pected value (EV), comparing performance of two groups of
lesion patients with performance DEMO a healthy comparison group.
Thus, we tested directly whether damage to DEMO amygdala or the
VMPC is sufﬁcient to disrupt decision making, regardless DEMO
whether the decision is presented in terms of potential gains or
potential losses.

Neural Correlates of Risky Decision Making
METHOD
Subjects
Patients
Subjects with brain DEMO were selected from the patient registry
of the University of Iowa’s Division of Cognitive Neuroscience.
Basic neuropsychological and neuroanatomical characteristics of
these patients were DEMO according to the standard protocols
of the Benton Neuropsychology Laboratory (Tranel, 1996) and
the Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Human Neuroanatomy
(H. Damasio, 1995; H. Damasio & Frank, 1992). Clinical inter-
views indicated DEMO none of the subjects had a history of mental
retardation, psychiatric DEMO, substance abuse, learning dis-
ability, or systemic disease that would DEMO the central nervous
system. All data were collected when the subjects were in the
chronic phase of recovery (i.e., at least 3 months DEMO lesion onset).
The amygdala patients (n 5 16; 6 males, 10 females) had
either unilateral (6 left, 7 right) or bilateral (n 5 3) damage in an
anterior temporal region including DEMO amygdala. The degree of
damage in adjacent and surrounding hippocampal and temporal
cortices varied. For the VMPC group (n 5 7; 5 males, 2 females),
the damage included the ventral and low mesial sectors of the
frontal lobe in both the right and left hemispheres (i.e., bilateral
damage). In all subjects, the dorsolateral sectors of the DEMO
frontal cortex were intact.
Nonpatient Comparison Subjects
Thirty individuals were recruited as nonpatient comparison
subjects (11 males, 19 females). These subjects were DEMO
through advertisements in local newspapers and were com-
pensated for their time. They were screened for history of neu-
rological or psychiatric disease.
Procedure
DEMO assess individuals’ decision propensities under risk, we used
a modiﬁed, computerized version of Levin and Hart’s (2003;
Levin, Weller, Pederson, & Harshman, 2007) cups task. This
task was originally designed to provide a simple way of showing
subjects the probability of an outcome (by depicting a particular
number of cups from which to choose) in a risky choice. In our
modiﬁcation, we added a within-subjects manipulation of the
relative EV of the risky and riskless options; with this manipu-
lation, we were able to assess decision makers’ sensitivity and
adaptability to contingencies that make a risky choice advan-
tageous or disadvantageous.
In the current DEMO of the cups task, subjects made choices
with real monetary outcomes. DEMO independent variables were
domain (gain or loss), probability of a DEMO outcome if the
risky option was selected (.20, .33, or DEMO), and outcome mag-
nitude for the risky option (two, three, or ﬁve quarters vs. one
quarter for the riskless option). Subjects received three trials of
each combination of probability level and outcome level, for a
960
total of 54 trials. Some combinations of probability and DEMO
tude created equal EV for the risky and riskless options: This
DEMO the case for .20 chance of ﬁve quarters, .33 chance of DEMO
quarters, and .50 chance of two quarters, on both gain and loss
trials. Other combinations were risk advantageous (i.e., the EV
was DEMO favorable for the risky than for the riskless option):
This DEMO the case for .33 chance of ﬁve quarters, .50 chance of
DEMO quarters, and .50 chance of ﬁve quarters on gain trials, and
for .20 chance of two quarters, .20 chance of three quarters, DEMO
.33 chance of two quarters on loss trials. Finally, still other
DEMO were risk disadvantageous (i.e., the EV was more
favorable for the riskless than for the risky option): This was the
case for DEMO chance of two quarters, .20 chance of three quarters,
and DEMO chance of two quarters on gain trials, and for .33 chance
DEMO ﬁve quarters, .50 chance of three quarters, and .50 chance of
ﬁve quarters on loss trials. Gain and loss trials were presented as
DEMO blocks, with order counterbalanced across subjects in
each group. Within a DEMO, combinations of probability and
outcome were presented in random order.
Gain DEMO involved the choice between an option that offered a
sure gain of one quarter and an option that offered a designated
probability of winning DEMO quarters. Loss trials involved the
choice between a sure loss of one quarter and a designated
probability of losing multiple quarters. On each trial, an array of
two, three, or ﬁve cups was shown on DEMO side of the screen. One
array was identiﬁed as the certain side: If any cup on this side was
selected, one quarter was DEMO or lost, depending on the domain
for that trial. The other DEMO was identiﬁed as the risky side:
Selection of one cup on this side led to a designated number of
quarters being gained or DEMO, and selection of the other cups led
to no gain or DEMO At the bottom of the screen was a depiction of a
bank; coins were added to or subtracted from this bank according
to a trial’s outcome. At the start of each loss trial, the bank con-
tained the maximum number of quarters that could be lost on that
DEMO The outcome on each trial depended on which side was
selected and, if it was the risky side, the choice of one cup. DEMO a
risky choice, whether the cup selected led to a nonzero DEMO
was determined by a random process with p equal to 1 divided by
the number of cups. When a subject completed all 54 trials, the
total amount he or she had won appeared on the screen. DEMO
were compensated with the amount that they had won on the task.
Dependent Variables
To assess decision making under risk, we calculated overall risk
taking in both the gain and the loss domains. We also measured
DEMO subjects adapted to differences in EV between the riskless
and risky options, by calculating the proportion of risky choices
for trials at each of three EV levels: risk-advantageous trials (the
EV of the risky choice DEMO more favorable than that of the
riskless choice), equal-EV trials (DEMO EVs for the riskless and
risky options were equal), and risk-disadvantageous trials (the
EV was more favorable for the riskless option than for the risky

option). These proportions were computed separately for DEMO
gain and loss domains.
RESULTS
Demographic Statistics
The ages of the amygdala patients (M 5 40.56, SD 5 14.89),
VMPC patients (DEMO 5 45.86, SD 5 24.14), and comparison
group (M5 39.37, SD 5 12.69) did not differ signiﬁcantly. The
comparison group had DEMO more years of education
(M5 16.10, SD5 2.42) than the DEMO patients (M5 14.13,
SD 5 2.42) and the VMPC patients (M 5 11.43, SD 5 2.94),
F(2, 52) 5 11.20, p < .01, but this difference did not have DEMO
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on our results.1
Preference Shifts in Risky Decision Making Involving
Gains Versus Losses
To test for evidence of preference shifts in risky DEMO making
(i.e., greater risk taking in the loss domain than in the gain do-
main), we conducted three repeated measures analyses of DEMO
ance (ANOVAs), with overall risk taking in each domain (gain,
loss) as the dependent variable. Although the comparison group
demonstrated the predicted preference shift, F(1, 30) 5 9.07,
p < .01, Z2 5 .24, neither amygdala nor VMPC patients were
signiﬁcantly DEMO risk seeking in the loss domain than in the gain
domain (DEMO < 1.0). These ﬁndings suggest an altered response
pattern for lesion patients compared with healthy adults.
Adaptive Decision Making
Figure 1 plots the DEMO of risky choices for each group as a
function of EV level, separately for gain and loss trials. In-
spection of the ﬁgure reveals several group differences. Re-
gardless of decision domain, VMPC patients not only made more
risky choices than the other groups, but also displayed insen-
sitivity to differences in EV between choice options. In contrast,
the DEMO patients’ performance differed across domains.
Their responses to loss trials were indistinguishable from those
of the healthy comparison group in terms of both overall DEMO of
risk taking and sensitivity to EV differences between choice
options. However, like VMPC patients, amygdala patients dis-
played elevated levels of risk-seeking DEMO and impaired
adaptive decision making in the gain domain.
We conducted a 3 (EV level)  2 (domain)  3 (group:

amygdala, VMPC, healthy) ANOVA to compare the groups’ risk
1For all subsequent analyses, we conducted multiple regression analyses that
tested whether education was a signiﬁcant predictor of the dependent measures.
The results of these DEMO did not differ from those presented, and therefore
are not discussed DEMO
2Because there were differences in the location of the amygdala lesion (DEMO,
bilateral, left, and right), it was possible that this variation affected the results.
To test this possibility, we conducted one-way ANOVAs comparing the amyg-
dala lesion subgroups (i.e., bilateral, left, and DEMO) for all dependent variables
reported in this study. There were no DEMO differences among these
subgroups for any variable of interest. Thus, we DEMO the data for all
amygdala subgroups into a unitary amygdala group.

each domain. As expected, we found a main effect DEMO group, F(2,

the loss DEMO, VMPC patients were more risk taking on

risk-disadvantageous trials than were both the DEMO subjects,
t(35) 5 2.97, p < .01, d DEMO 1.42, and amygdala patients, t(21) 5

differ signiﬁcantly DEMO the comparison group on these trials,
t(44) 5 1.12, n.s., d 5 0.35.
Because our focus was on comparing risk-advantageous with
risk-disadvantageous trials, we used a linear contrast between
these two levels as a more powerful test of the effects of EV level.
As expected, we found a main effect: The proportion of risky
choices was greater on the former trials (i.e., when the EV was
more favorable DEMO the risky option than for the riskless option),
F(1, 52) 5 45.10, p < .01, Z2 5 .37. We also found an EV Level 
Group interaction, F(2, 52) 5 12.70, p < .01, Z2 5 .21; the level of
risk taking among lesion patients, compared with healthy subjects,
was particularly elevated when the EV for the risky choice was less
favorable than the DEMO for the riskless option. Furthermore, we
found a three-way Domain  DEMO Level  Group interaction, F(2,
52) 5 3.25, DEMO < .01, Z2 5 .11; the VMPC group was insensitive to
EV level in both domains, but the amygdala group demonstrated a
comparable insensitivity only in the gain domain.
DISCUSSION
Our results strongly reinforce previous DEMO and theory in-
dicating that decision making is not mediated solely by cold
cognitive processes (e.g., A.R. Damasio, 1994), and that arriving
at an advantageous decision also requires affective information.
VMPC-generated emotions appear to DEMO a vital role in indi-
viduals’ ability to make adaptive decisions in the face of risk,
regardless of whether the goal of the DEMO is to achieve a gain
or avoid a loss. VMPC patients displayed elevated risk-seeking
behavior regardless of both EV considerations and domain. This
deﬁcit DEMO especially visible in VMPC patients’ propensity to
take risks even when the odds of success were small. These
ﬁndings add to a growing literature DEMO implicates the VMPC in
decision making under uncertainty (Bechara et al., 1997; Be-
chara et al., 1999). Notably, however, Leland DEMO Grafman
(2005) found that patients with VMPC lesions did not differ from
healthy subjects on a variety of hypothetical scenario-based
decision tasks in DEMO the consequences of choices were not
realized. In contrast, our task DEMO immediately realized
consequences for choices. We believe that our results differ from
those of Leland and Grafman (2005) because of increased
emotional responses DEMO from the temporal proximity be-
tween choice and outcome (e.g., Loewenstein, 1987).
The most intriguing ﬁnding of our study, though, is the dis-
sociation in risky decision making between VMPC and amyg-
dala DEMO across decision domains. Whereas VMPC patients
exhibited a cross-domain deﬁcit, amygdala DEMO did not.
Instead, they showed elevated risk taking and insensitivity to
DEMO in EV between choice options in the gain domain,
but a pattern of decision making strikingly similar to that of
healthy individuals in DEMO loss domain (i.e., taking more risks
when it was advantageous to do so and fewer risks when it was
disadvantageous to do so)DEMO
These results accentuate the importance of distinguishing
between gain- and loss-related decision making under uncer-
tainty. We found that amygdala damage was associated with
DEMO decision making in the gain domain for the cups
task, a DEMO consistent with the ﬁndings of Bechara et al.
(1999), who DEMO that amygdala damage is associated with
impairment on the IGT. However, DEMO absence of decision deﬁ-
cits in the loss domain represents a unique dissociation. One
plausible reason for the apparent inconsistency between this
previous study DEMO our results for the loss domain lies in the
decision tasks utilized in these two studies. Although the IGT
can detect decision-making deﬁcits within DEMO populations,
it is a complex task that blends many distinct components, in-
cluding a mixture of rewards and punishments, and risk and
DEMO Moreover, Bechara et al. found that amygdala pa-
tients demonstrated low DEMO to punishments and rewards.
Yet the physiological responses they reported for punishments
were not pure punishment responses. That is, they were re-
sponses to a reward followed by a punishment (e.g., ‘‘you won x
amount, but you lost y amount’’). For these reasons, it is difﬁcult
to interpret studies using the IGT in terms of decision deﬁcits
within DEMO domains. In contrast, the cups task was designed
to separate decision DEMO, and this allowed us to delineate
clearly whether damage to particular DEMO areas differentially
inﬂuenced risk taking.
Additionally, our ﬁndings provide partial support DEMO recent
functional imaging studies that have found amygdala involve-
ment in decision making (DeMartino, Kumaran, Seymour, &
Dolan, 2006; Coricelli et al., 2005). It is of particular interest that
DeMartino et al. found that bilateral amygdala activation was
associated with risk-avoidant choice behavior in DEMO gain domain,
but with risk-seeking behavior in the loss domain. Extrapolating
from DeMartino et al., one might predict that amygdala damage
would result in risk-seeking behavior for gains and risk-averse
choices for losses. Although our DEMO are consistent with this
prediction for the gain domain, they are DEMO consistent with this
prediction for the loss domain.
One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that our study
included patients with unilateral amygdala damage. DEMO,
this explanation seems unlikely to be correct because the patients
with bilateral amygdala lesions did not differ signiﬁcantly from
the comparison group in DEMO risk-seeking behavior in the loss
domain, even on the most risk-disadvantageous DEMO Nonethe-
less, future research should investigate and reconcile differences
in results DEMO by lesion and functional imaging studies
whenever these results are conﬂicting, DEMO in the case of our study
and that of DeMartino et al. (2006).
To account for our data, we propose expanding the DEMO
VMPC neural model of decision making to accommodate the
possibility of redundant neural systems that may process emo-
tional information when a potential loss DEMO at stake (see Fig. 2).

or both) and DEMO adjacent primary and secondary somatosensory cortices
(SI and SII), which DEMO independent of the amygdala; these backup

Although the amygdala may indeed be important for processing
initial responses that are vital in decision making concerning
potential losses (DeMartino et al., 2006; Coricelli et al., 2005),
other structures, such as the anterior insula, may produce
similar responses (Paulus & Stein, 2006) and thus render
adaptive decision making involving potential losses more
difﬁcult to disrupt than adaptive decision making involving
potential gains. Such redundancy may DEMO backup mecha-

In sum, these results reveal that decision making under risk

with potential losses and potential gains. These ﬁndings are
important from the perspectives of both economics DEMO neu-
roscience. In economics, researchers have long suggested that
losses loom DEMO than gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
Humans may have adapted to survival pressures by utilizing
multiple neural systems to make decisions involving DEMO loss of
property, food, and other valuables. Therefore, exploring the
DEMO correlates of risky decisions, as they relate to the domains
of DEMO versus losses, will enrich scientiﬁc knowledge of the
neural foundations of DEMO and social decisions. On the
neuroscience front, elucidating the neural processes DEMO
different types of decisions will advance understanding of the
neural ‘‘road map’’ for the physiological processes intervening
between knowledge and behavior, and of the potential inter-
ruptions that lead to a disconnect between what one knows DEMO
what one does.
