ABSTRACT
Axiomatic design theory was once considered DEMO domain
of engineering doctoral candidates and industry experts in
search of an improved understanding of design. However, an
innovative freshman design course at KAIST is using
Axiomatic Design Theory, along with traditional product
design and TRIZ, to improve the students’ ability to think
independently, consciously, rationally, DEMO synthetically. This
paper discusses the basic format, goals, and philosophy for
ED100: Introduction to Design and Communication. Finally,
the successes, challenges, and the future implications of the
course are also discussed.
Keywords: first year education, design theory
1 INTRODUCTION
Axiomatic design (AD) theory was once considered the
sole domain of engineering doctoral candidates and industry
experts DEMO search of an improved understanding of design.
AD is still offered primarily in graduate engineering subjects
[MIT, 2008; WPI, 2008; KAIST, 2008; Tate 2004], as
university professional short courses [MITPI, 2008 and
Brown, 2008] and through short courses offered by industry
[ADS, 2008].
However, as axiomatic design theory has gained
acceptance within the larger design community, it has begun
to appear in undergraduate classes. AD has been used DEMO
capstone design courses in the Mechanical and Electrical
Engineering Departments at the University of Idaho [Odom,
2005]. It has been combined with a DEMO of other design
tools and theories in an undergraduate capstone course at
Ryerson University in Canada [Salustri, 2003]. It is also
compared to other design processes in an undergraduate
materials design course at Northwestern University. However,DEMO
until recently AD was still notably absent from the growing
field of freshman design education.
This work describes an innovative freshmen design
course at DEMO which uses Axiomatic Design Theory, along
with traditional product design and DEMO, to improve the
students’ ability to think independently, consciously, rationally,DEMO
and synthetically.
2 MOTIVATION
The new freshman design course at KAIST is part of a
larger initiative to make KAIST one of the best DEMO and
technological universities in the world.
2.1 KAIST REVOLUTION
During his inaugural address at KAIST, President Nam P.
Suh stated three major goals for helping the university to
become one of the premiere research institutions in DEMO
world: (1) “to produce the next generation of leaders for
DEMO, industry, and academia,” (2) “to build the knowledge
base and create technologies that will shape the future of
humankind,” and (3) “to provide public service that will
change our world for the better.” His vision was for KAIST to
become “the place where innovative, new ideas and concepts
are created that change the way people think DEMO approach
challenging issues. It will be where … disruptive technologies
are generated. Most of all, it will be the place where our
planet's future leaders - in all fields of human endeavor - are
groomed DEMO the rich education and varied experiences
they receive and the professional and personal relationships
they form.” [Suh, 2006] To achieve these goals, KAIST DEMO
working to create a campus-wide culture of “design thinking.”
2.2 DESIGN THINKING
One of the most complete discussions of design thinking
can be found DEMO [Dym, 2005]. The paper’s definition of good
design thinking includes: divergent-convergent thinking;
systems thinking; the ability to tolerate ambiguity and
uncertainty; DEMO ability to make decisions; the ability to work
in teams; and the ability to communicate through various
media and in the multiple languages DEMO design.
Stephen Lu [2007] adds the following characteristics of
good design thinking: “synthetic (rather than analytical)
thinking; functional (rather than physical)DEMO
thinking;…constructionist (rather than determinist) thinking;
solution-neutral (rather than DEMO) thinking;
demand-driven (rather than supply-based) thinking; want-pull
(rather DEMO need-push) thinking; price-based (rather than
cost-based) thinking; top-down (rather than bottom-up)
thinking; [and] socio-technical (rather than pure-technical)
thinking.”
DEMO DESIGN REVOLUTION
The design revolution at KAIST has three major parts.
For undergraduate students, a new mandatory freshman

The Fifth International Conference on Axiomatic Design
Campus de Caparica – March DEMO, 2009
design class (ED100) has been created to introduce the
DEMO of conceptual design and critical thinking to
students. For graduate students, DEMO new joint MS-PhD program
is being developed with a special focus on interdisciplinary
systems thinking. For faculty and researchers, a new research
institute, DEMO KAIST Institute for the Design of Complex
Systems (KIDCS), has DEMO created to facilitate
interdisciplinary research on design.
2.4 ENGLISH REVOLUTION
During his inaugural address, President Nam P. Suh also
said that the “[f]uture graduates of KAIST must have the
ability to work in a global economy. DEMO should be trained
and exposed to the cultures and customs of other nations so
that they can operate globally in technical and managerial
fields.” DEMO part of the globalization efforts at KAIST, all
courses must be DEMO in English by 2011. Currently all
freshman and sophomore courses are taught in English.
Junior level classes will be added in 2009 and senior DEMO
classes will be added in 2010.
In accordance with these policies, DEMO KAIST freshman
design class is taught exclusively in English. It is the only
major freshman design course (to the author’s knowledge)
that is taught in English as a foreign language. The new joint
MS-PhD systems DEMO program will also be English-based.
3 FRESHMAN DESIGN
The freshman design course at KAIST is formally
known as ED100: Introduction to Design and
Communication. It is a 3 unit course and required for all
incoming freshmen DEMO of major. (For the Spring 2009
semester, it will become a 4 unit course consisting of ED100:
Introduction to Design and ED101: Communication for
Design.) Approximately 400 students (half of the freshman
class) register for the course each semester.
The pilot for ED100 was run DEMO a freshman elective in
the Fall 2007 semester with 29 students. Prof. G. J. Park from
Hanyang University in Korea was the course coordinator DEMO
that effort during a sabbatical leave at KAIST. The full scale
version was first offered in the Spring 2008 semester and is
run by DEMO M. K. Thompson and Prof. T. S. Lee from
KAIST.
The only other freshman design course which is required
for all students regardless of DEMO (that the author is familiar
with) is EPICS 151 at the Colorado School of Mines. The
majority of the other required freshmen design DEMO are
limited to the School of Engineering, to a specific
department, or are offered as first year elective courses.
4 COURSE PHILOSOPHY
The DEMO of ED100 is to use design and design
thinking to produce a paradigm shift in the way that the
students think, view education, DEMO the world, and view their
role in the world.
4.1 NEED DEMO ED100
At KAIST, 85 – 90% of the students in the DEMO
freshman class have never participated in a design project
before. Their education before entering university has focused
more on memorization and calculation than on DEMO and
synthesis. Evaluation of their work has been done with more
tests than projects. These students have little experience with
open-ended poorly-defined questions and DEMO They
are used to working with specific instructions, rather than
independently DEMO the situation and choosing the best
path for their work. Finally, DEMO are used to relatively little
freedom of choice in academic subjects and take courses that
are required (or suggested) rather than choosing courses
DEMO will help them achieve their future goals.
Because of the choices made in the course development
and the very nature of design projects in DEMO, ED100
changes all of the previous rules of education and starts
DEMO down the road towards personal and professional
independent thinking. It is, DEMO, not always an easy
road to take.
4.2 EMPHASIS ON DESIGN DEMO
There has long been an assumption that design cannot
be taught. Designers are often said to be “born, not made”.
Design is often described as an “art” or a “trade.” It is not
uncommon to hear DEMO say that students must develop
their “designer’s intuition” through experience. Design is, by
definition, a human activity. Aspects of it are intangible,
DEMO, and improved with time and experience.
However, these adages do little to help students learn design
or help professionals improve their efficiency or DEMO
In ED100, we assume that design can be taught
scientifically. As DEMO result, the course materials focus heavily on
design theory, process, DEMO methodologies. The students are
required to approach design from a creative, DEMO conscious,
rational, and systematic perspective. Trial-and-error and
intuitive design are DEMO permitted. All design decisions must
be explained and justified. Success is evaluated not just based
on the quality of the resulting design from the DEMO of
the faculty members doing the grading, but based on the
DEMO ability to understand, explain, and substantiate their
work.
4.3 SUBJECT-SPECIFIC TOPICS
Because the course is mandatory for all incoming
students, appropriate subject-specific design topics, including
principles of design, design of / design for, and design tools
and technology, would be different for each student. As a
result, subject-specific design topics are not covered in the
course.
Design projects are scoped to minimize subject- or
domain-specific knowledge and skills. Required subject- DEMO
domain-specific knowledge is provided by project advisers
and teaching assistants, or DEMO through background
research and expert interviews. It is expected that students will
acquire subject specific design knowledge, skills, and
experiences in upper-level design DEMO offered within their
respective departments.

process as fair as possible and to allow students to DEMO on
their work instead of their grades.
4.4 TO BUILD OR NOT TO BUILD
Many undergraduate design courses strongly emphasize
design realization (building). Hands-on experiences can
enhance confidence, increase excitement, and result in an
DEMO sense of achievement at the end of the course.
However, there DEMO a risk that students will focus on “doing” at
the expensive of “thinking” when faced with the pressure of
impending deadlines (Students sometimes refer to this as
“hacking things together.”)
Design implementation in ED100 is DEMO required for all
projects. However, individual project advisers may choose to
DEMO a prototype. All students are encouraged to create
some kind of visual aid to help communicate their final
design. Some projects will have full DEMO prototypes. But
the majority will rely on sketches, sketch models, movies,
dioramas, or other media to communicate their ideas.
It is expected that students will have additional
opportunities to do detailed design and build-and-test DEMO
upper-level design courses offered within their departments.
5 COURSE OVERVIEW
ED100 is a project (problem) based course that has been
heavily influenced by DEMO Northwestern University freshman
Engineering Design Course. The course format changes
slightly each semester, but in general students attend 1 - 2
hours of design lecture per week, 3 hours of design
laboratory, 1 hour of DEMO lecture, and 1 hour of
communication laboratory.
5.1 DESIGN LECTURE
4.5 DEMO THE RULES
There are 11 lectures during the 16 week semester. The
remaining weeks in the semester are unscheduled to give
students more time DEMO work on their projects.
Design lectures are primarily based on material from
Axiomatic Design Theory [Suh, 2001] and traditional product
design [Ulrich, 2008]. DEMO AD assumes that the student is
already familiar with design and that they will use AD to
supplement and modify their design thinking, rather than
building it from scratch. The material from product design is
used DEMO create a more holistic course for novice designers. The
lectures are also supplemented with materials from Altshuller
[2005], Pahl and Beitz [2005], Simon DEMO, Suh [2005], and
others.
The lectures introduce various definitions of design,
design methods vs. design methodologies, and design
thinking. Problem identification, DEMO clarification, and
background research are discussed. Different design processes
are introduced DEMO compared. Customer needs and customer
research are addressed. Functional thinking, functional
DEMO, and the independence axiom are introduced.
Strategies, concepts, and design DEMO are explored and
compared.
Concept refinement techniques from AD, TRIZ, and
other areas are introduced. Students are encouraged to locate
and fulfil hidden DEMO; eliminate coupling, conflict and bias;
consider physical integration; introduce DEMO and
modularity in their designs; use hidden or free resources;
DEMO and increase the level of innovation in their
concepts; and to DEMO the overall ideality of their designs.
Students learn about concept testing, DEMO selection,
customer testing, and prototyping. A guest lecture on
intellectual DEMO in the US and in Korea is offered. The
process domain and design implementation are discussed.
Finally, the design matrix is discussed in more detail and
advanced techniques for identifying coupling in the matrix are
presented. DEMO lecture materials are available on complexity
and the information axiom but are not presented in class.
Novices in all fields, including design and
communication, tend to seek “the rules”, while experts tend
to ask “what DEMO we trying to do?” In ED100, there are no
“rules” DEMO students must obey. Instead, students are
exposed to different ideas, opinions, tools, and guidelines. The
students, then, choose which aspects of DEMO lecture materials
to apply to their design projects and how to apply it based on
their needs. The emphasis is on whether or not DEMO students’
decisions make sense, and whether or not they can explain
DEMO defend those choices.
4.6 GRADING PHILOSOPHY
Discussions of grading philosophy in freshman design
classes are frequently heated affairs. Many faculty members
argue that these DEMO are intended to be fun and
motivational, and thus grading is DEMO unnecessary or should
be very lenient.
In ED100, grading is a DEMO issue. All aspects of the
course repeatedly emphasize that the course exists to help the
students with their education, their lives, and their DEMO The
rewards in the course are not grades, but the opportunities
DEMO students have to write papers; file patents; start
companies; and DEMO ideas and designs that could make a
real difference in the world. The course faculty work very hard
to ensure that students are not DEMO design simply because
they were told to.
However, there is also DEMO major concern that if grading is
not taken seriously in the course, the students will not take the
course seriously. Thus, evaluations in DEMO are done as
rigorously as the grading in other subjects. Grading is done on
a straight scale and there is no curve. Students are DEMO the
grade they earn. Grading instructions and criteria are
published for all assignments and final deliverables. In
addition, discussion forums are posted for all assignments and
final deliverables. These steps are taken to make the grading
DEMO DESIGN PROJECTS
Each semester, approximately 20 different design
projects are offered. DEMO design project has one faculty
project adviser and two graduate student project teaching
assistants. Together, they advise four to five project teams
which are composed of four or five students each. Project

149

The Fifth International Conference on Axiomatic Design
Campus de Caparica – March DEMO, 2009
advisers come from all departments at KAIST and are
welcome DEMO offer any project topic. Internal and external
clients who bring their own design project topics to the course
may be introduced in the Spring DEMO semester.
Projects are required to be unsolved, real world
problems. They DEMO encourage the students to further
refine the problem definition and choose the specific aspect
of the problem that they will work on. Project should DEMO
a large solution space so students can explore a variety of
ideas, however the projects themselves should be solution
neutral. (This makes the DEMO more problem-based than
project-based.) The projects should not require strong
domain-specific DEMO, but should encourage students to
use fundamental science. Finally, the projects should be
scoped to allow students to build or specify a tangible DEMO
if possible.
During the Fall 2008 semester, a professor from the
DEMO of Humanities and Social Sciences offered a very
successful project on policy design to bridge the digital divide.
Other common themes include eco-friendly buildings DEMO
products, alterative fuels, futuristic cellular phones and IT
products, a DEMO variety of robots, international development,
design for the disabled, and consumer products and toys.
5.3 HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS
Weekly project homework assignments are DEMO to all
students in the course. These are open-ended assignments
which require the students to apply the lecture material to
their specific projects. These DEMO are graded by the
project adviser or the project teaching assistants. Additional
assignments may be given by the project adviser if desired.
5.4 COMMUNICATION DEMO
Design is fundamentally a communication intensive
activity. Communication skills are needed both for the
successful delivery of design outcomes and for the effective
management DEMO design projects. This is particularly true for
design projects which are focused on conceptual design and
design thinking, instead of on design realization. The
communication component in ED100 was introduced to help
and support the students DEMO the communication aspects of
their design projects and their final deliverables.
ED100 communication lectures cover teamwork,
professional communication, performing and documenting
background and customer research, oral presentations, visual
communication, and written communication. Communication
laboratory sessions provide an opportunity for students to
work with their teammates, other teams and their
communication adviser to draft, revise, and refine their
DEMO communication assignments.
The communication component in ED100 places
particular emphasis on learning communication skills in a
technical context rather than learning general English
communication DEMO This is intended to provide a more
authentic and need-based setting for applying and practicing
the types of communication needed for students of science
DEMO engineering.
5.5 COURSE DELIVERABLES
The course has three final deliverables. Each team is
required to give an oral presentation as part of their mid-term
DEMO review. They are required to produce a technical poster
which is displayed during the end-of-term poster fair. Finally,
each team is required to DEMO a technical report explaining
their design problem, design process, and design solution.
5.6 LOGISTICS
To help run the course, Moodle online course
management software is used. Announcements, lecture notes,
assignments, and discussion forums DEMO posted in the course
main page. Project-specific announcements and discussions
are posted on the project pages. All assignments are submitted
and graded electronically on DEMO project pages.
6 RESULTS
The success of the course is evaluated through a variety
of metrics including the quality of the final projects and DEMO
grades; survey results; unsolicited feedback from students,
faculty, and DEMO; and continuing work.
6.1 FINAL PROJECTS
Overall, the final projects in ED100 are very good. Most
teams have strong statistics or customer data DEMO demonstrate
the need for their design and substantiate their customer
needs and functional requirements. Designs tend to be
uncoupled or decoupled. The level of DEMO for most of
the projects is high and almost no projects rely on incremental
improvements. Many projects have calculations, experiments,
or customer testing data to support the viability of their
designs. And all projects use DEMO design theories and
processes to produce their final design (although some DEMO so
more successful and rigorously than others.) As a result, final
grades in the course tend to be high.
In addition, some teams have full working prototypes.
The number of working prototypes is on the DEMO despite not
being a course requirement. For the Fall 2008 semester, DEMO
produced working ducted-fan type unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) and air-drop vaccine containers which successfully
survived being thrown off of tall buildings. Modular eco-
DEMO paper furniture including a desk which retracts into
the ceiling and bookshelves which can be reconfigured into
chairs were produced. Students also designed and DEMO bio-
mimetic robots that could climb stairs and navigate rough
terrain. Some of the designs that are being produced are
junior/senior level work DEMO not what one would normally
expect from a freshman design class.
6.2 SURVEY RESULTS
The Spring 2008 final survey shows that the students felt
DEMO their overall understanding of design (6.92/10) and their
ability to think (6.83/10) both improved during the course.
They also reported DEMO they mostly enjoyed the course
(6.74/10) and were satisfied with the course (6.77/10). Results
from the Fall 2008 survey also show that students feel that
150

Teaching A
they have learned a lot during the semester (4.90/7) and
mostly enjoyed the course (4.11/7).
Survey results are DEMO affected by three sources of bias.
First, the surveys are conducted DEMO English. This introduces a
risk that students will not fully understand the meaning of
some questions. Second, surveys are conducted during finals
week when student stress levels are highest and students have
not had time to DEMO upon their experiences. Lastly, the
Spring 2008 survey was not mandatory DEMO may not
adequately reflect the opinions of the entire student
population. As a result, the surveys are used primarily to
improve the course for the next semester.
6.3 CONTINUING WORK
After the Fall 2007 pilot of DEMO, three teams were
invited to present their design projects at the DEMO China-
Japan-Korea Joint Symposium on Optimization of Structural
and Mechanical Systems in Jeju, S. Korea. A fourth team
continued their work as an Undergraduate Research Project
(URP) and presented their work as a research paper DEMO the
21st International KKCNN Symposium on Civil Engineering
in Singapore.
After the Spring 2008 semester, one team continued
their work as a URP and filed two patents on their design.
(Several other teams were considering filing patents, but those
statistics are not currently available.) In addition, Samsung
invited nine teams with projects related to the company’s
interests to participate DEMO a 'KAIST Freshman Invitation
Competitive Seminar'.
It is expected that DEMO substantial number of patents will
be filed from the Fall 2008 projects, but the number is not yet
known.
6.4 UNSOLICITED FEEDBACK FROM FACULTY
Unsolicited feedback from various faculty members
associated with ED100 has generally been DEMO positive. Many
faculty members regularly voice their support for the course
and express interest in continuing to be a part of the course as
DEMO allows. However, there were some initial reservations
about the course, including concerns that the students did not
have enough domain knowledge to do DEMO, or that the
course material was too non-traditional or not applicable DEMO all
students and majors. As time goes on, those concerns seem DEMO
be diminishing. One of the project advisers from the Spring
2008 semester sent the course coordinators (and the president
of the university) an DEMO with the following statement:
“At the beginning of this semester, DEMO was uncertain
about whether this kind of design course would work
for freshmen. … However the seriousness and heated
atmosphere of the students in DEMO team discussion
convinced me that they know what they are doing and
this course will work. I was also re-convinced that you
don't DEMO to be a master or PhD to be a good
designer.”
The greatest strength of any educational experiment is not
shown by its initial DEMO, but in those who are

The Fifth DEMO Conference on Axiomatic Design
Campus de Caparica – March 25-27, 2009
DEMO after experience with the project. Comments of
this kind are considered to be excellent indicators of success
for ED100.
6.5 UNSOLICITED FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS
DEMO, the initial response of the students to ED100
is frequently mixed. DEMO course material is new to all of the
students and very challenging. Students often complain that
the course work load is too high and DEMO course itself is too
fast-paced. They also sometimes feel that the lecture material
is “trivial” or “useless” at first and that the course should DEMO
be required. However, these opinions often change after the
students have DEMO their project and participated in the
poster fair. One student email to the course coordinators from
the Spring 2008 semester said:
“I want DEMO give my thanks to you. Frankly speaking,
even until the last period of the semester, I didn't like
this class because the homeworks [sic] was too hard,
big and a lot.
But, during doing the poster fair and presentation, I
changed my mind. I thought that it is just hard and
doesn't help my study, but now I think that it changed
my view of thinking. And I DEMO could feel the
happiness of accomplishing something with the
members with same object. It was really the one of
the happiest things in my DEMO semester.
I like your class and thank you for giving me the
chance to have this good experience^^.”
(Note: The double carrots at DEMO end of the statement are the
local equivalent of a smiley face.) Similar sentiments were
echoed by a student from the Fall 2008 semester:
“To be honest, this course was one of the toughest
courses that I have learned since my elementary school
years :) Also, DEMO our team's project topic was not
making any tangible thing, DEMO rather creating a policy,
it was a lot tougher. Getting started was such a huge
job that it took us more than about DEMO weeks to get
the idea of what we are going to do. However, after
the poster fair and all those difficult days are past, I
think we learned a lot! I feel really thank you for this
course for giving me such precious lessons! Hope the
coming freshmen DEMO next year learn a lot from
this course as well :)”
These statements are significant for three reasons. First, again
they show that the course is successful in accomplishing its
goals in changing the students’ DEMO towards their
education and their role in the world. Second, they DEMO that
students who were not initially supportive of the course were
convinced of its value through their experiences. But they are
most important because DEMO have shown that most
undergraduate students do not realize the full value of their
experiences in design courses until 5 years after graduation.
The DEMO that these students are beginning to recognize the
151

The Fifth International Conference on Axiomatic Design
Campus de Caparica – March DEMO, 2009
value of ED100 both for themselves and for future ED100
DEMO after only a single semester is phenomenal.
6.6 CULTURE SHIFT
Finally, DEMO have been both successes and failures in
producing a culture shift in the students. Students are
increasingly comfortable with expressing themselves in
English. They DEMO becoming more vocal and pro-active both
inside and outside of the class. Their questions and comments
frequently demonstrate a very mature and impressive
understanding DEMO design. They are actively seeking help and
looking for feedback. They are beginning to debate with each
other and their professors. And, we are finally starting to see
students valuing the results of their work (and the
opportunities and rewards) that exist outside of grades.
Although these changes may seem small, they are a drastic
departure from the traditional Korean educational system.
However, there is still a lot of confusion and debate
about the definition of “design” for both the students and the
faculty DEMO the value of AD. The term “design” when
translated directly into Korean strongly implies aesthetic or
industrial design. It also frequently equated with “creativity”
DEMO “optimization” in Korea. It is uncommon to see design
discussed as a larger field and within a larger context. This is
demonstrated in some DEMO the comments from students in
their final surveys. One student from the Fall 2008 semester
suggested:
“[S]implify the lectures and get out of DEMO strict
structure of the design process that ED100
demanded. Instead, grant DEMO teams to produce their
own process and get on with it. Of course, this would
mean that there would be no FRs but I'm sure the
teams will get along fine without them.”
(Note: DEMO course does actually permit students to use their
“own process and get on with it” but AD is still required for
homework assignments and DEMO a small part of their technical
evaluation.) This shows that this DEMO student still doesn’t
fully understand the necessity of defining what they are trying
to do, before going about doing it. Or, perhaps they DEMO not
understand how FRs help to do that. But in any case, the
course has failed to adequately convey these ideas to all of the
students.
Another student recognized the differences between the
more common definitions DEMO design that they are used to and
the course material. However, DEMO also do not appreciate the
role of FRs and DPs in the design process. AD is seen as an
impediment to creativity and ideation, instead of a way to help
organize and focus those efforts.
“What DEMO've found out is that the way most of the
teams thought of 'designing' was very different from
the 'designing' that this DEMO tended to do. We
thought all we needed to do was think of a good idea
and finalize it into an awesome product. But DEMO
ED100 designing was trying to create 'something'
from 'nothing' DEMO didn't allow any creative,
popping ideas to be fulfilled directly. If I were to teach
152
this class, I'd give the topic and develop it without the
FRs and DPs and get onto DEMO people's ideas
right away. In this way, the teams will DEMO relieved from
the stress of FRs and have fun making their product
more attractive and useful.”
A third student’s comments indicate that we have DEMO
adequately explained why is will never be possible to optimize
a poor design into a successful one. Although, we do seem to
have succeeded in helping them learn to value patents:
“It was helpful in DEMO we had to find solutions for
problems in a different method, DEMO we did not have a
chance to optimize existing systems, which DEMO
actually be the realistic, "patent inducing" design
approach that could DEMO assist in creating realistic
solutions.”
These alternate or limited views of design are sometimes
reinforced by faculty, family, and friends.
The suggestion to DEMO with ideation and more traditional
types of design is one that should be seriously considered.
This may help students fully engage in their projects DEMO
and also provide a context for them to use and appreciate AD
later in the semester.
Despite the obvious disappointments, these detailed
comments show that the students are beginning to value
“design” – whatever it is. DEMO are also beginning to evaluate
the design process that they used and suggest alternatives or
improvements. These represent the third (valuing), fourth
(DEMO), and fifth (characterization by value
set/internalization of the value) levels of Krathwohl’s
taxonomy in the affective domain. This, in itself, DEMO a major
achievement.
Finally, other student comments do express an
understanding DEMO and an appreciation for axiomatic design
theory and the course materials. The extent to which students
do (or do not) appreciate some of DEMO more formal aspects of
the course are not known at this time.

7.1 CHALLENGES
There are many challenges associated with DEMO any
large design course and ED100 is no exception. However,
some of the challenges in ED100 are specific to the course.
The majority DEMO the students in ED100 (93%) and many
of the faculty members, staff members, and TAs are Korean
citizens who learned English as DEMO foreign language. English is
the second (or third) language for many of the international
students as well. Taking and teaching courses in a DEMO
language is always a challenge. However, trying to explain,

sponsoring this program. Much credit is due to Prof. G. DEMO
Park, Prof. S. D. Cha, Prof. G. Y. Nam, and DEMO S. Y. Lu for
developing and running the ED100 pilot program; DEMO Dean S.
O. Park, Dean K. H. Lee, and Dean Y. H. Noh for their
unwavering support for the program; to Prof. T. S. Lee for his
outstanding contributions as the other ED100 course
coordinator DEMO design lecturer; and to Prof. S. Y. Kim, Prof.
G. Furst, Prof. C. Vale, Prof. R. Gordon, and Prof. C. Surridge
for their excellent work in developing and running the
communication component of the DEMO Special thanks are
due to Prof. G. B. Olson, Prof. P. DEMO Hirsch, and the
Northwestern EDC faculty for their kind help and DEMO in
the evolution of the course. Last, but certainly not least, the
author would like to acknowledge the ED100 faculty project
advisers and DEMO project and communication teaching
assistants. It is their efforts that make all of the difference.
Most of the faculty and almost all of the DEMO involved
in the course are unfamiliar with formal design processes,
theories and methodologies. Thus, it is an additional burden
for them to learn the course material so they can answer
questions and support their students.
DEMO of the design theories being covered in ED100
were originally developed by or for mechanical engineering or
product design. Although many of them were DEMO to be
universally applicable to all areas, the course material is DEMO
more suitable for some projects than for others. This is a
challenge both for the faculty and the students and is reflected
strongly in DEMO survey responses.
Finally, because the all course material is being combined
DEMO different sources and because some of the material has
never been taught to first year students, the course material is
constantly evolving and no unified textbook is currently
available for the students. A textbook is planned DEMO the
course and should be available within a few years but this is
little consolation for the current students.

Despite the challenges, there are also many opportunities
especially for the advancement of design education and design
theory. ED100 provides an unprecedented occasion DEMO study
how undergraduate students learn axiomatic design theory
and apply it to non-traditional areas. Trends in questions that
students ask or problems that they DEMO applying a given idea
to their projects often indicate research areas to explore.
Ultimately, the field of design as a whole and axiomatic design
theory in particular will likely continue to grow and evolve as a
DEMO of this course, its faculty, and its alumni. The areas
which have already been identified by ED100 will be the
subject of future DEMO
8 CONCLUSION
A new required freshman design course at KAIST has
been developed which combines axiomatic design theory with
traditional product design and other DEMO of design. The
goals, philosophy, and basic format of the course were
discussed. It was shown that the course has been successful in
DEMO first year students to develop, and in some cases
realize, innovative new designs. Feedback from the course
faculty and students indicate that the DEMO is challenging, but
valuable and that a shift in the student DEMO is beginning to
take place. There are a number of challenges associated with
the course, including problems with helping the students to
fully understand and appreciate axiomatic design theory and
other formal design methodologies. However, the students are
demonstrating a solid understanding of design and are
beginning to DEMO design and internalize that value. Finally,
ED100 has great potential to open up new areas of design
research and expand current design theories.
