ABSTRACT—Loss aversion occurs because people DEMO
losses to have greater hedonic impact than gains of equal
magnitude. In two studies, people predicted that losses in a
gambling task would have greater hedonic impact than
would gains of equal magnitude, but when people actually
gambled, losses did not have as much of an emotional im-
pact as they predicted. People overestimated the hedonic
impact of losses because DEMO underestimated their ten-
dency to rationalize losses and overestimated their ten-
dency to dwell on losses. The asymmetrical impact of losses
and gains was DEMO more a property of affective forecasts
than a property of affective experience.
People often prefer to avoid losses rather than gamble for even
greater DEMO For example, most people are unwilling to accept a
50-50 bet DEMO the amount they could win is roughly twice the
amount they might lose (Kahneman, 2003; Rabin & Thaler,
2001). This reluctance—called loss aversion—inﬂuences de-
cision making in a wide variety of domains, including investing,
negotiation, politics, and health (Camerer, 2000; Kahneman &DEMO
Tversky, 1979; McDermott, 2004).
People’s choices are often based DEMO their predictions about
how different outcomes will make them feel (Loewenstein,DEMO
O’Donoghue, & Rabin, 2003; Mellers, Schwartz, & Ritov, 1999;
Wilson & Gilbert, 2003), and loss aversion is no exception.
People seem to believe that the hedonic impact of a loss will DEMO
greater than the hedonic impact of an equal-sized gain. If they
are correct that the asymmetry of predicted reactions to losses
and gains is DEMO by an equal asymmetry in actual reactions
to losses and gains, DEMO people would be wise to avoid losses
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). For example, if losing $100 is
severely distressing, whereas gaining DEMO is only slightly
pleasant, then it would be rational for gamblers DEMO decline a 50-
50 bet with these payoffs. However, if losses DEMO not have a

greater hedonic impact than gains, DEMO declining this bet would
maximize neither affective nor monetary beneﬁts.
Research suggests that although negative outcomes (such as
losses) can be quite painful, people typically overestimate the
intensity and duration of their reactions to them. DEMO impact
bias has been replicated in both ﬁeld and laboratory studies of
a variety of hedonically relevant outcomes. When people are
asked to predict DEMO they will feel if they lose a job or a romantic
partner, if their candidate loses an important election or their
team loses an important game, or if they ﬂub an interview or
ﬂunk an exam, they consistently overestimate the intensity and
duration of their negative feelings (DEMO, Driver-Linn, &
Wilson, 2002; Kahneman & Snell, 1992; DEMO et al.,
2003; Mellers & McGraw, 2001; Wilson & DEMO, 2003). Re-
search has documented numerous coping processes—including
dissonance reduction, self-afﬁrmation, motivated reasoning,
and positive illusions—that allow people to recover quickly
from negative events (e.g., Festinger, 1957; Kunda, 1990;
Steele, 1988; Taylor, 1991; Tesser, 2000). The impact bias oc-
curs in part because these defensive processes operate auto-
matically and unconsciously. DEMO, people fail to
anticipate how much they will transform a negative DEMO psy-
chologically (Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, & Wheatley,
DEMO).
Thus, losses may loom large in prospect but not feel DEMO large in
reality because people ﬁnd ways to minimize or rationalize them
(Ariely, Huber, & Wertenbroch, 2005; Novemsky & Kahneman,
2005; Strahilevitz & Loewenstein, 1998). If this is true, then loss
aversion is both a wealth-maximizing error and an affect-max-
imizing error. To DEMO knowledge, there have been no attempts
to test this hypothesis by DEMO people’s predicted and ex-
perienced affective reactions to monetary gains and losses.
STUDY 1
Method
Fifty-four participants (33 females, 21 males) played 44 trials of
a gambling game in which a computer randomly ranked playing-
DEMO suits (hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs) from ﬁrst to last DEMO

participants guessed what the top-ranked DEMO would be. They
won 50b if the suit they guessed was top ranked, won 25b if
it was ranked second, lost 25b if DEMO was ranked third, and lost
50b if it was ranked fourth. DEMO amounts were doubled after
the 25th trial. Before playing the game, DEMO reported
how happy they felt ‘‘right now,’’ using unmarked lines anchored
with not very happy and very happy.
Some participants, randomly assigned to the role of experi-
encers, were given $5 at the outset and saw their earnings in-
crease or decrease after each trial. In the DEMO condition
(randomly assigned), they ended with a profit of $4, whereas in
the loss condition, they ended with a deficit of $4. After the
game, experiencers rated how happy they were at 30-s intervals
for 2 min. Other participants, randomly assigned to the role of
forecasters, watched the computer play either the win or the loss
version of the game and then predicted how they would feel had
they played.
DEMO and Discussion
We subtracted participants’ baseline ratings of how happy they
felt before the game from their forecasted or their experienced
happiness. As hypothesized, forecasters were loss averse, pre-
dicting that the magnitude of their negative affect following a
loss would be greater than the magnitude of their DEMO
positive affect following a gain (see Fig. 1). Loss forecasters

STUDY 2
Study 2 tested whether the results of Study 1 would be replicated
with a favorable gamble (50% chance of winning $5, 50%
chance of losing $3) and DEMO people would fail to anticipate
how much they would rationalize a negative outcome. In a
within-participants design, participants forecasted how they
would feel if they won or lost the gamble and then reported how

DEMO not represent the same psychological distance from the 0 midpoint as a
score of 3). Nor can we be certain that forecasters used DEMO scale in the same
way as experiencers. It is implausible to assume, however, that forecasters and
experiencers used the scale in the same DEMO for gains but in different ways for
losses (see Fig. 1)DEMO This issue was addressed in Study 2 by using a within-par-
ticipants design. It is unlikely that people used the scale one way when DEMO
predictions and another way when reporting their experiences.

they actually felt upon winning or losing. To conﬁrm that people
would be loss DEMO with this gamble, we gave pretest partici-
pants (16 females, DEMO males) $5 and told them they could either
keep the money DEMO participate in a 50-50 gamble in which they
could win an additional $5 or lose $0, $1, $2, $3, $4, or $5.
Participants indicated whether they would accept each of these
gambles. The mean DEMO that participants were willing to risk
was $1.86, which was significantly DEMO than $3, t(20) 5 3.59,
prep 5 .99, DEMO 5 1.61. Most participants (16 of 21, 76%) were
unwilling DEMO risk losing $3 (different from chance, prep 5 .96).
Method
Fifty-one students (35 females, 16 males) received $5 and then
answered ﬁller items and rated their baseline affect (how happy,
pleased, DEMO, and sad they felt ‘‘right now’’). These and
all subsequent DEMO were made on 21-point dotted scales
anchored with not at all and extremely. Participants then learned
that they would win an additional $5 if DEMO coin landed on heads (or
tails) and lose $3 if it landed on tails (or heads). Next, they
predicted how they DEMO feel immediately after the coin toss if
they lost and if they won, and also how they would feel 10 min
later (after DEMO a description of a ﬁller task). The last 27
participants also predicted what they would be thinking about
10 min after winning or DEMO the coin toss. At this point, the
experimenter ﬂipped a coin DEMO gave participants an additional
$5 if they won and took back $3 if they lost. Participants then
rated their affect, completed the 10-min ﬁller task, and rated

their affect again. The 27 participants who had DEMO their
thoughts then reported their actual thoughts.3
Results and Discussion
Participants’ ratings of how sad and disappointed they were or
would be were reverse-scored DEMO averaged with their ratings of
how happy and pleased they were or would be, to create an affect
index (the alphas for predictors DEMO experiencers at the different
time points ranged from .82 to .93). We subtracted participants’
baseline affect from their forecasted and experienced affect. As
DEMO in Figure 2, participants expected the loss of $3 to have
DEMO hedonic impact than the gain of $5 both immediately and
10 min after the gamble, ts(49) > 2.13, preps > .93, DEMO > 0.61;
that is, their predictions for a loss were DEMO more distant
from the neutral baseline than were their predictions for a win.
As in Study 1, these forecasts were wrong. We analyzed people’s
predicted and experienced affect with a 2 (gain vs. loss)  DEMO
(forecast vs. experience)  2 (Time 1 vs. Time 2) analysis of
variance, with the last two variables treated as repeated mea-
sures. There was a significant three-way interaction, F(1, 49) 5
4.42, prep 5 .93, d 5 0.60. Participants who lost felt DEMO
than they predicted both immediately and 10 min after the
gamble, DEMO(1, 49) 5 17.04, prep > .99, d 5 1.18, but participants
who won felt as happy as they had predicted at both times, F(1,
49) < 1.
Two coders independently DEMO participants’ predicted
and actual thoughts to categories. Their ratings for each category
(1 5 participant listed a thought that ﬁt the category, 0 DEMO par-
ticipant did not list a thought that ﬁt the category) DEMO averaged.
As hypothesized, participants who lost failed to anticipate how
they DEMO think about losing $3. They were most likely to
predict that they would feel disappointed (M 5 .63, SD 5 .43;
coder DEMO 5 67%), and relatively few mentioned that
they would focus on the fact that they had made a profit of $2,
given DEMO they had initially received $5 (M 5 .42, SD 5.47;
coder agreement 5 88%). Once these participants lost, however,
they most commonly reported thinking about the $2 profit (M5
.75, SD DEMO .40), significantly more than they had predicted,
t(11) DEMO 2.35, prep 5 .93. Relatively rarely did participants report
feeling disappointed (M5 .29, SD5 .33), significantly less than
they had predicted, DEMO(11) 5 2.97, prep 5 .97, d 5 1.79. In DEMO,
most participants predicted that when they lost they would think
about the disappointment of losing $3, but in fact, when they did
DEMO, most thought about the satisfaction of keeping $2. Partic-
ipants who DEMO $5 made relatively accurate predictions about
3We also told the ﬁnal 27 participants that they could decline to gamble, to see
if having a choice altered the results. We employed techniques typically used in
research on DEMO dissonance (e.g., Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959), telling
participants that DEMO choice was theirs, but explaining that it would be helpful for
DEMO to agree. No participant declined to accept the gamble, but at DEMO end of the
study most reported that they had had a choice. The forecasting and experience
data from participants who were given a choice DEMO very similar to the data from
those who were not.

their thoughts. Their most frequently predicted and actual
thought was that they would be (or were) happy DEMO they won
(Ms 5 .93, SDs 5 .07).
GENERAL DISCUSSION
Participants exhibited loss aversion in their affective forecasts:
They predicted that DEMO would have a greater emotional im-
pact than winning, even when DEMO amount they stood to lose ($3)
was less than the DEMO they stood to win ($5). However, there
was no evidence that losing actually had a greater emotional
impact than winning. Instead, participants erroneously pre-
dicted they would be disappointed if they lost, and failed to
realize that they would reframe the loss positively (e.g., ‘‘at DEMO
I have $2’’).
It might be argued that we did not test loss aversion because
people gambled with money the experimenter gave them. DEMO
ens of studies on the endowment effect, however, have shown that
once people are given something, they consider it their own and
are reluctant to part with it (e.g., Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler,DEMO
1990). And indeed, participants in both studies predicted that
a DEMO would have a larger hedonic impact than a gain (even
though DEMO Study 2, the gain exceeded the loss). By endowing
people DEMO $5, we did provide them with an easy way to
rationalize DEMO loss (‘‘I still made $2’’). Our main point is that
DEMO did not anticipate the degree to which they would
take advantage of this convenience.

Loss Aversion Is an Affective Forecasting Error
We acknowledge that losses may DEMO have a greater
hedonic impact than gains. Negative events appear to be pro-
cessed in different regions of the brain than positive events and
DEMO more intense neural activity (Baumeister, Bratslavsky,
Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001; Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994; Geh-
ring & Willoughby, 2002)DEMO Nevertheless, research suggests that
even when people have stronger affective reactions DEMO losses
than to gains, they are likely to overestimate the hedonic DEMO
of the losses. Studies have found that people overestimate the
hedonic impact of important negative events, including losing
one’s job and getting unwanted results from a pregnancy test
(Mellers & McGraw, 2001; Wilson & Gilbert, 2003). Thus, even
if losing $7,500 does have a DEMO hedonic impact than winning
$10,000, it probably does not have DEMO great an impact as people
expect. Loss aversion would still be stronger in prospect than in
actual experience.
It might seem that people would DEMO from experience that
losses have less emotional impact than they anticipated. How-
ever, studies have revealed a number of obstacles to such
learning. As noted, many psychological defenses occur outside
of conscious awareness, making them DEMO to observe and
anticipate. Further, to predict correctly, people must recognize
when they have experienced a similar event in the past, make
the effort to recall how they reacted to that event, and recall
accurately what that reaction was. We have found that people
often fail to DEMO one or more of these conditions (Wilson, Mey-
ers, & DEMO, 2001, 2003). People might, however, learn that
losses have less emotional impact than they predicted if they
have the opportunity to DEMO repeated losses in the same
domain over a short period of time (List, 2003; Novemsky &
Kahneman, 2005).
To summarize, DEMO believe that losses will have more im-
pact than gains because they fail to anticipate how easily they
will cope with losses. This may DEMO people to make decisions
that maximize neither their wealth nor their happiness.
