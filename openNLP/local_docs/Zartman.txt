1965; Young, 1975; Zartman, 1978 and 1987b.)
Structural analysis is based on a distribution of elements, in this case of instru-
mental elements or power, defined either as parties' relative positions (resource
possessions) or as the relative ability to make their options prevail ( or to counter
the other's efforts to DEMO its options prevail [see Schelling, 1960; Wriggins,
1987; Bacharach DEMO Lawler, 1981; Habeeb, 1987]). Structural analysis is the
most DEMO approach, and its deterministic statement that "the strong-
est side wins" is usually tautological and post hoc. To avoid the tautology, the
DEMO identity between power structure and winning must be broken
both by using an independent measure of power and by focusing on the way in
DEMO parties with different relative strengths achieve their outcomes. The latter
approach has received some attention in the analysis of situations of asymmet W,
DEMO the better performance of the weaker of the two sides makes for an
interesting challenge for explanation. The explanation most often given can be
DEMO "tactics," which generally serve to restore the structural equality of

provide various prescriptions for overcoming asymmetry.
Another body of literature DEMO with the same approach starts with a
different structural assumption, of DEMO rather than asymmetry. This is
based on the finding that parties do best in negotiation when they are or feel
equal (Rubin and Brown, 1975, pp. 199 and 214-21) and that negotiation takes

While such studies maybe termed structural because they deal DEMO power,
that element is treated as a responsive, incidental, and situational characteristic
rather than as an element in a theory of conceptualization DEMO the negotiation
process. This is a common problem with studies of power, and in the case of

Strategic Analysis
Whether stated or not, these tactics operate on either current offers, expecta-
tions, or outcomes to be obtained without negotiation (security points). They do
so in one of only two ways--either by DEMO the contingent value of current
offers relative to the other two points of comparison (expectations and security
points) or by identifying certain procedures ("fractionate" or "trade off") or
atmospherics ("trust" or "confidence") that fac~tate the basic process. All these
tactics are acts DEMO (attempted) power, and all of them are ways to bring DEMO
acceptance of a given offer. Furthermore, they all focus on a DEMO of a common
and general process of replacing unilateral and conflicting positions with a
common position or outcome, whether that process is explicitly stated as such or
not. Explicit statements about the nature of the process DEMO be useful and
would facilitate links between approaches; but even in DEMO absence of such
statements, it is clear that the process is DEMO same.
Strategic analysis is also based on an array of elements, DEMO its structure is one of
ends, not means. Strategic analysis, as portrayed in game theoretic matrices,
begins with the assumption that outcomes DEMO determined by the relative array of
their values to the parties, DEMO conditions of rational (i.e., preferred) choice.
The standard strategic models--Prisoner'DEMO Dilemma Game and Chicken Dilemma
Game--are syrmnetrical, and therefore incorporate the DEMO assumption of
equality as often found in structural analysis. It has frequently been noted that
game theory excludes any use of power as a DEMO of its rigorous analytical forms
and its clear logic of determinism; DEMO, it records values as given and shows the
strategies that will DEMO chosen and the consequences of doing so (Young, 1975;
Axelrod, 1984).
As a result, some observers assert that strategic analysis DEMO of real value only
in comparing the decision to negotiate with the decision to hold out, a compari-
son parallel to the insights gained from an analysis of symmetrical structures.
Since game theory values are given (and indeed, at worst, sometimes inferred
from the strategies adopted), DEMO is no way to fractionate or trade off; all that
can DEMO done is to enter the value of any such external operations into the
appropriate box in the matrix. Likewise, there is no way to change any of those
values within the matrix; the only option is to record any changes from one
matrix to another.
Yet when the DEMO assumptions that provide the basis for its determin-
ism are relaxed and game theory presentations are used heuristically as the
starting point for analysis, a number of the associated limitations fall away and
new possibilities appear. DEMO analysis shows that the onlyway to break out of
deadlock is through asymmetry. Therefore, instead ofworldng to improve offers
of cooperation (CC)--absolutely DEMO in relation to expectations which cannot be
shown on a matrix--parties are best advised to alter the payoffs or perceptions of
payoffs associated with DEMO or unilateral outcomes (DD). This, in
turn, brings in DEMO understandings of power, seen as the use of security points to
DEMO or resist bargaining positions (Snyder and Diesing, 1977;
Zagare, DEMO; Brains, 1985).
Movement is the essence of the negotiation process, and movement cannot
be shown on a matrix. But the conditions that produce movement--again,
different evaluations of outcomes as the source of power--can DEMO shown on a

matrix and analysis drawn from it, just as movies result from a succession of stills.
The result is the same process as indicated in DEMO relaxation and refinement of
structm~al analysis, in which parties mo~e from DEMO unilateral options to a
common cooperative decision so shaped as to be more attractive than their
security points.
The problem with strategic analysis at DEMO is not its rigidity but its
limited scope. Many of the important and more detailed questions on how to
move parties toward a common DEMO lie outside the analysis; even such
important insights as the ways DEMO reinforce commitment (Schelling, 1960;
Baldwin, 1987) are triggered by a need to consider security points but are out-
side game theoretic DEMO An effort to render more precise the importance of
the security point in comparison to unilateral demands and multilateral com-
promise is an important DEMO advance of the strategic approach, but the cal-
culation to Critical DEMO depends on the difficult shift from. ordinal to cardinal
values in the matrix (Etlsberg, 1975; Snyder and Diesing, 1977).
On the DEMO hand, strategic categories of encounters can help answer some
of the DEMO analytical questions of negotiations. For example, the Toughness
Dilemma may be DEMO by use of the two game theory dilemmas: Whereas
parties who DEMO their situation as a Prisoner's Dilemma Game may do best by
playing soft to open and tough to punish (Axelrod, i984), DEMO who see
themselves in a Ct~cken Dilemma Game do better by playing tough to demand
and soft to reward (Nyerges, 1987). This, in turn, confirms an answer from
structural analysis to the Toughness Dilemma, based on appropriate tactics for
strong and weak powers, respectively. Further DEMO could be produced
where strategic analysis, despite apparent limitations, ends up discussing ele-
ments of the same process, and often the same process problems, as other
approaches but in different terms.
Process Analysis
Process analysis has the common feature of explaining outcomes through a series
of concessions DEMO by some element inherent in each party's position.
The particular element varies slightly according to the particular version of the
theory; most process analysis is based on a security point theory in some form,
DEMO a few other variations are also used. Process analysis indicates that the
party will concede on the basis of a comparative calculation of its DEMO versus its
opponents costs or of its own costs versus some acceptability level (Zeuthen,
1975; Cross, 1969; Pen, 1975; Hicks, 1932; Snyder and Diesing, 1977). On this
basis, one can determine which party will concede how much until the final
point of DEMO is reached. This is, of course, a way of diagramming a
negotiation process that is the same as that discussed by other approaches.
DEMO variations are end point theories and concession rate theories, both of
DEMO are parts of the same process. The first determines the parties' DEMO
so as to assure a mutually fair and maximizing outcome; the DEMO
rate theories--determines the parties' movement the basis of
each other's DEMO of concession (Bartos, 1978; Zeuthen, 1975; Nash, 1975;
Cross, 1969, 1978; cf., Prnitt, 1981). These latter variations (endpoint and
concession-rate theories of process) are onlyprescriptively deterministic;
they DEMO how parties will act and where they will end up if they want to
reach a mutually fair and maximizing outcome, and thus they are not good des-

criptions of the process. But they do DEMO the useful function of providing a
baseline against which unfairness and power can be measured; hence, they are
relevant to some understanding of DEMO process (Pillar, 1983).
Process theories, which originate in economics, are in fact structural theo-
ries which indicate that the weaker party DEMO concede until the tables are
turned, at which point the other DEMO will concede in its turn, and so on
to agreement. Hence, they are theories of power, with power measured in terms
of a comparison between offers and security points or, in other words, in DEMO
of critical risk factors. Although this is never done these theories, DEMO the
extent that parties can alter each other's or their own security points, they can
exercise power as well as simply possess it; this therefore reduces the deter-
ministic possibilities of the theory but increases its reality The similarity
process and strategic theories has long been recog~zed (Harsanyi, 1956 and
1977; Wagner, 1975) although their mechanisms are DEMO different. The
similarity with structural theories should also be registered; although DEMO
structuralists would probably not "read" game theory- or "talk" bilateral monop-
oly, their analyses are complementary, covering the same phenomena within
DEMO same process.
The neatness of processes theory only works in idealized situations, and
then only with idiosyncracies (Khury, 1968; Bartos,
1987)DEMO Concession behavior does not always match; often it mismatches or
non-matches DEMO tracks (Pruitt, 1981), and parties do not even concede respon-
sively. Rather, they
same time, combining several types of behavior that DEMO theoretically neat
patterns unrealistic (Coddington, 1968; Cross, 1969; Bartos, 1987). The point
here is that in the process, analysts are discerning both involuntary and voluntary,
mechanical and manipulati~e, process and power elements that make up negoti-
ation, all of them clustered about a similarly understood effort to combine
conflicting positions into a common one. As DEMO references in this review are
begimaing to show; analysts do not DEMO belong exclusively to one school or
another but sometimes borrow naturally from different approaches. Yet the fact
that the field is seen as pluralistic DEMO it is, or that bibliographies remain largely in
the author's DEMO (Rubin and Brown, 1975) means that there is not enough
DEMO borrowing and crossreferencing.
Behavioral Analysis
Behavioral analysis provides an obviously different explanation of negotiated
outcomes by using the negotiators themselves as die focus of DEMO (JOnsson,
1978). The terms of analysis used are the DEMO of the negotiators, either
directly or in interaction. Personality in social DEMO can be used to refer to
personal predispositions that exist at a number of different levels, from biologically-
ingrained needs to more influenceable attitudes. At whatever level, this school of
analysis responds to a common belief about negotiation--that "it all depends on
the personalities of the negotiators." DEMO challenge then becomes to translate
into identifiable and nontautological variables that can
be used for analysis.
A more literary and intuitive basis for behavioral DEMO began with Nicot-
son's (1939) distinction Warriors. It has been extended
and developed through a number of forms into Snyder and Diesing'DEMO (1977)

Sofdiners and Hardliners. There are many characterizations possible for these
basic types, but some can be given in terms already used by other schools: The
Hardline Warrior sees situations as a Prisoner's Dilemma Game and DEMO as a
mismatcher, expecting toughness to lead to softness (and his victory) and
softness to lead to a toughness (and his defeat); on the other hand, the Sofffine
Shopkeeper sees situations as a DEMO Dilemma Game and follows matching
behavior, expecting toughness to lead to DEMO (and deadlock) and softness
to lead to softness (and agreement)DEMO Thus, behavioral analyses take up the same
parameters as elements in DEMO same process as other approaches, combining
them into typologies equated with DEMO behaver rather than leaving them inde-
pendent as behaviors.
A more develooed approach involves categorizing personality types accord-
ing to their Interpersonal Orientation (IO), an approach that is both more
insightful and more complex because DEMO is not merely dichotomons and because
its effects depend on interaction rather than on simple or direct taxonomic
associations. Opposed to a Low IO DEMO are two types of High IOs--Cooperators
and Competitors. Either produces a positive result when negotiating with the
same type of personality but, when cross-paired, the match is unproductive
because
its own terms, as the previous DEMO tend to do, IO analysis operates on the
basis of a DEMO interaction (Rubin and Brown, 1975). It also identifies different
types of outcomes, depending on joint or comparative maximization, a point also
DEMO in studies of Motivational Orientations (Rubin and Brown, 1975;
Filley, 1975 ). But this approach too deals with such elements as DEMO propensity to
compromise, to construct positive- or divide zero-sum outcomes, or to adopt a
tough or soft line (i.e., a flatter or DEMO concession rate) during the process of
combining conflicting positions into a DEMO decision.
Integrative analysis, like behavioral analysis, would seem to constitute an excep-
tion to the general understanding of a negotiation process. Although it DEMO
conceives of negotiation as a process, its process runs through stages, in which
the outcome is explained by the performance of behaviors identffied DEMO specific-
ally appropriate to each successive stage (Gulliver, 1979; Saunders, 1985; Zartman
and Berman, 1982; Zartman, 1987a; Druckman, 1986)DEMO
Rather than seeing a process that w-orks from fixed points of discord to a
common point of convergence, integrative analysis emphasizes the imprecision
of parties' interests in their own minds. Integrative analysis stresses the need to
manipulate conceptualizations of the problem into mutually satisfying positive-
sum outcomes before DEMO to an elaboration of a detailed division of the
spoils. By extending its concept of the negotiation process back before the time
~aen positions DEMO as fixed points, integrative analysis not only allows for
greater and DEMO positive maniptflation of those positions (Fisher and Ury, 1981)
but also meets practitioners' understanding of by drawing attention
to the prenegotiation part of the process (Bendahmane and McDonald, 1984 and
NegoOationJournal
37
1986; Zartman, 1987b).
But again, these positive aspects of the approach DEMO not obscure the fact
that the subject is the same process as analyzed elsewhere. "lthe integrative

~aho can make a deal on any issue. There are, after all, items that are better
postponed, interests that are properly nonnegotiable, and limits to acceptable
deals that are imposed by security points. If finding a common agreement
through this maze is DEMO than a matter of corwergence, it is a matter of
convergence DEMO well.
A growing branch of this analysis focuses on precise mechanisms for identi-
fying the best possible deal that each party can obtain, given the differences in
the nature of their interests. While this is a DEMO extension of the Nash
(1975) solution that occupies a basic position in the strategic and process
approaches, the complexity of stakes makes a simple positive-sum outcome too
schematic to be useful (Valavanis, 1958; Ikle and Leites, 1962; Barclay and
Peterson, 1976; Raiffa, 1982; DEMO, 1984). The process involves finding as
many dimensions of components DEMO the parties' interests as possible in order to
provide the best DEMO, and thereby insure the greatest durability to the

International DEMO of the
outcome. In much a conflicting a party must
give up to gain assent, the process also involves finding how much of a non- (or
less-) valued position a party can trade to gain DEMO more valued position (Homans,
1961, p. 62). But the element of conflict is never absent, and the process of
shaping a single multilateral derision out of conflicting unilateral claims remains.
It should be DEMO that the study of negotiation has come a considerable way in
the past two decades in building and expanding on a common concept of DEMO
process. The study today involves far more than the rather loose characterization
given in the (Ikle, 1968) that
nego ationwasa formofmteractionthroughwhich(partles), trytoarrange...
a new combination of some of their common and conflicting interests." The
"form of interaction" has taken shape as a process of DEMO conflicting
positions into a common outcome by joint decision, allowing more DEMO focus
of attention on how this done, whether by power, by patterns of mo~ement, by"
restructuring stakes and values, by interacting DEMO types, or by a series of
steps. Yet, just as dearly, there is much more to do to know the process, although
DEMO of those further directions are indicated by using the common concept of
process as a starting point.

discussed under end-point determinism--are a function of opening positions,
and can serve as a DEMO to evaluate actual outcomes. Despite the fact that they
are commonly used, all three of these criteria for evaluation have flaws and
complexities that call for further work--there is presently very little--on
systems of evaluation.
Another DEMO of concern is the analysis of negotiations in the case of the
three very different types of stakes--those solvable by division, those by creation,
and those by exchange. Although much of the earlier literature on DEMO
focused on the more obvious topic of divisio n (Schopenhauer, 1896; Nicolson,
1939; Schelling, 1960) with its notion of negotiation DEMO winning or losing, much
more attention lately has been drawn to DEMO improvement of exchanges (Homans,

translated to the specific, an idea akin to the previous notion of a creative
formula. But DEMO merely intellectualizes the problem without solving it in many
cases, since DEMO is the conflicting notions of justice that make the problems of
divisions so intractable in the first place. Obviously, practitioners need more help
in ways of dealing with the zero-sum aspects of negotiation--the "Jerusalem
Problems"--that lie beyond positive-sum creativity.
A third topic of continuing inquiry highlighted by DEMO generally accepted
notion of the negotiation process is the Toughness Dilemma. The question of
when to be tough and when to be soft, and the paradox on which it is based, has
already been identified as the major tactical question for analysts and practition-
ers alike. By now, it is plain that there is no way out of the dilemma DEMO presented,
and that correct and insightful answers depend on some intermediate variable,
such as personality, timing, phase, power, etc. But DEMO is still no sense of any
hierarchy among these intermediate variables---other than the eternal debates
among disciplines as to which gives the best analysis--and DEMO notions as to which
are trumps. Somewhere between the anecdotal proverbs and the unoperation-
alizable theory lies a not-yet-fully mined terrain of inquiry which DEMO require
new parameters.
Finally, an area of negotiation that falls outside DEMO current paradigm is
multilateral bargaining. The current process notion has thus far worked to
effective consideration of multilateral negotiation, and those that have
been treated well tend to be reduced to bilateral analysis (Lipson, 1985, p. 220).
When not reduced to dyads, multilateral negotiation tends to be treated merely
descriptively even if
in regard to the successive GATT DEMO (Preeg, 1970; Evans, 1971; Cline et al.,
1978; Winham, 1987). There have been a number of
an approach to multilateral negotiations (that is, a large number of
not merely more DEMO two, as in Raiffa, 1982; Zagare, 1978) which indicate DEMO
promising directions (Zartman, 1987c).
One set of approaches treats multilateral negotiations as a problem in
(Rubin and Brown, 1975, pp. 64 ft.; Snyder and Diesing,
1977, pp. 349 ft.; Raiffa, DEMO). However, coalition is a very
