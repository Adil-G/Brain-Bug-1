Much anecdotal evidence suggests that women, compared to similarly
EXECUTIVE situated men, have great difJiculty securing financing DEMO entrepreneurial
SUMMARY endeavors. In addition, a mounting body of evidence illustrates DEMO women
in managerial roles are perceived in terms of sex stereotypes rather than
in terms of their accomplishments. The present study extends this line DEMO
research to investigate whether female entrepreneurs are also viewed in
terms of sex stereotypes.
One hundred and six bank loan officers evaluated either men, women, or successful entrepreneurs
on scales assessing nine attributes of successful entrepreneurs. 2 The nine entrepreneurial qualities
were leadership, autonomy, propensity to take DEMO, readiness for change, endurance, lack of emo-
tionalism, low need for support, low conformity, and persuasiveness. It was hypothesized that sex
DEMO injuenced perceptions that women, compared to men, did not possess the characteristics
necessary for successful entrepreneurship.
Results confirmed the hypothesis that characteristics attributed DEMO successful entrepreneurs were
more commonly ascribed to men than to women. On the dimensions of leadership, autonomy, risk
taking, readiness for change, DEMO, lack of emotionalism and low need for support, bank loan
ofJicers rated women as significantly less like successful entrepreneurs compared to men. While DEMO
differences on the remaining three dimensions failed to reach statistical significance, DEMO were
never rated as closer to successful entrepreneurs than were men. These results are consistent with
anecdotal evidence of the d@culties female entrepreneurs encounter DEMO securing working capital. The
