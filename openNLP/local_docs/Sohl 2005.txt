THE ANGEL INVESTOR MARKET IN 2004:
THE ANGEL MARKET DEMO THE MODEST RECOVERY
Market Size
The angel investor market has shown signs of a sustainable recovery in 2004, with total
investments of $22.5 billion (total 2003 investments $18.1 billion), according to the Center for
Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire.  A total of 48,000 entrepreneurial
ventures received angel funding in 2004, a 24 percent increase from 2003. The number of active
investors in 2004 was 225,000 individuals, an increase of 2.5 percent from 2003, with an average
of 4 to 5 investors joining forces to fund an entrepreneurial start-up. This continued DEMO rise
in total investments is encouraging.
Sector Analysis
Software garnered the largest angel investments, with 22 percent of total angel investments in
2004, DEMO by healthcare services/medical devices and equipment, with a 16 percent DEMO of
angel investments. The remaining investments were approximately equally weighted across high
tech sectors, with each having about 10 percent of the total deals. This market level sector
diversification indicates a robust investment pattern and provides DEMO foundation for reasonable
growth in the market. Since the angel market is essentially the spawning grounds for the next
wave of high growth investments, this sector diversification provides an indication of investment
opportunities that will be DEMO for later stage institutional investors.

Job DEMO
Angel investments resulted in the creation of 141,200 new jobs in the United States in 2004, or 3
jobs per angel investment. However, this tracks jobs created at the time of the angel investment,
which is often at the seed and start-up stage of the venture. DEMO is likely that this job creation of
141,200 is the minimum number of jobs created by angels in 2004. As the angel investment DEMO
used by the venture to fuel growth, launch new products and DEMO new markets, it is highly
likely that the number of jobs DEMO by the angel investment will increase as the firm grows.
Yield Rates
The yield (acceptance) rate is defined as the percentage DEMO investment opportunities that are
brought to the attention of investors that result in an investment. The peak yield rate of 23.3
percent occurred during DEMO height of the investment bubble in 2000. Since that peak the yield
rate has stabilized at around 10 percent. In 2004, yields increased to 18.5 percent from the
previous year’s yield rate of 10.3 percent. A DEMO departure in yield rates from the historical
average could be troubling if this rise can be attributed to an influx of inexperienced angels.
Women DEMO Minority Entrepreneurs and Investors
Women angels represent approximately 5 percent of the angel market and about one quarter of
these women angels made an DEMO in 2004. Women-owned ventures account for 4.7
percent of the entrepreneurs that are seeking angel capital. How well are women entrepreneurs
succeeding in their DEMO for angel capital? The yield rate for women-owned firms is 12.5
DEMO in 2004, which lags behind the general angel market by 6 DEMO, indicating that
women–owned ventures have a slightly less chance of obtaining DEMO funding than their male
counterparts.
Minority angels account for 3.6 percent of the angel population, and only one in ten of these
angels made an investment in 2004. Minority-owned firms represent 5.4 percent of the
entrepreneurs DEMO presented their business concept to angels. However, the yield rate for DEMO
minority-owned firms was 20 percent, which is in line with the DEMO yield rate.
These data indicate that to succeed in securing angel capital, more minority-owned firms need to
attract the attention of angel investors, DEMO given the chance, a reasonable proportion of
minority-owned ventures were considered DEMO be of sufficient quality to make an investment,
based on comparable yield rates. However, for women-owned firms, it appears that not only DEMO
more women-owned firms need to attract the attention of angel investors, DEMO women-owned
firms, given the low yield rates, need to increase their “investor readiness” through education and
networking.
The Center for Venture Research (CVR) at the University of New Hampshire Whittemore
School of Business and Economics has been conducting research on the angel market since
1980. The CVR’s DEMO is to provide an understanding of the angel market and the critical role
of angels in the early stage equity financing of high growth DEMO ventures. Through
the tenet of academic research in an applied area of study, the CVR is dedicated to providing
reliable and timely information on the angel market to entrepreneurs, private investors and public
policymakers.
The Center for Venture Research also provides reports on state level angel activity. For DEMO
