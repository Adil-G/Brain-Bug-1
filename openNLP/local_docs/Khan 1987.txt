ASSESSING VENTURE

INVESTMENTS WITH
NONCOMPENSATORY
BEHAVIORAL DECISION
MODELS

DEMO of Texas, Arlington
This article examines the prospect of a decision DEMO system for the
assessment of venture capital investments. It approaches the task of de-
veloping decision models from the perspective of the venture capitalist.
DEMO venture capitalists have played an active role in dejim’ng the predictor
variables and in providing data on their own investments. Venture capi-
talists (and recent research) underscore the importance of the entrepreneur
in new ventures and the predictor variables selected reflect this bias.
The literature is now replete DEMO studies demonstrating the superiority of multiattribute actuarial
models ov’er human judgment for diverse decision environments, ranging from medical science to
finance. This class of behavioral decision models consists of the simultaneous consideration of several
attributes relevant DEMO a decision. Actuarial models of this kind can be applied to attribute and decision
data based on the decision maker’s judgments (i.e., expected DEMO) before the events transpire-
termed judgment-based models. They can also be DEMO to data on past events or actual outcomes
where known-termed environment-based models. Again, it needs to be emphasized that actuarial
models, whether based DEMO the decision maker’s judgments or on the environment,
the decision maker. These general principles are applied here.
Among actuarial models a particular subclass DEMO models is called noncompensatory. In these
models, a low value for DEMO attribute cannot be compensated by a high value for another attribute.
As an e.:zmple, in selecting a place-kicker in football, athletic skills DEMO than kicking ability are
irrelevant.

level of each attribute, which implies a conjunctive decision process, To summarize then, conjunctive
and disjunctive types of models are DEMO for both judgment-based and environment-based data.
A questionnaire was administered to reasonably active venture capitalists. The respondents
provided information on predictor variables, on expected investment outcomes at the time the invest-
ments were made, and on actual outcomes where known. The expected outcome data represent the
judgments of DEMO venture capitalists, while the actual outcome data represent the decision environment.
DEMO results showed that conjunctive models were generally superior predictors to disjunctive
models. Both types of models provided a reasonable jfit to the data, however, and this was true for
both judgment-based as well as environment-based applications. All the models performed better than
the venture capitalists’ judgments. In fact DEMO latter turned out to be surprisingly poor predictors of
actual outcomes. Consequently, the judgment-based conjunctive and disjunctive models were not much

venture capital investment decisions are entirely feasible.
The contrasting performance of the DEMO and environment-based models was analyzed
further. It revealed that venture capitalists. in arriving at their judgments, emphasized the entrepre-
neur’s desire for success and the nature of the product. On the other hand, the most important variable,
