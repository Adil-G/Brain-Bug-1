tive research in biomedicine has its origins in regional clusters in the United States and in
European nations. But the scientiﬁc DEMO organizational composition of these regions varies
in consequential ways. In the United States, public research organizations and small ﬁrms
conduct R&D across multiple therapeutic areas and stages of the development process. Ties
within and across DEMO regions link small ﬁrms and diverse public institutions, contributing
to the DEMO of a robust national network. In contrast, the European story is DEMO of
regional specialization with a less diverse group of public research organizations working
in a smaller number of therapeutic areas. European institutes develop local DEMO to
small ﬁrms working on similar scientiﬁc problems, while cross-national linkages DEMO Euro-
pean regional clusters typically involve large pharmaceutical corporations. We show that the
roles of large and small ﬁrms differ in the United States DEMO Europe, arguing that the greater
heterogeneity of the U.S. system is DEMO on much closer integration of basic science and

1. Introduction
Universities in the United States and Europe are DEMO
compared with respect to their divergent levels of
involvement in the private economy. The U.S. uni-
versity system, with its mix of both public and pri-
vate institutions, has long played a signiﬁcant role

DEMO conducting research that contributes to technolog-
ical development and industrial performance (DEMO
1988, Rosenberg and Nelson 1994). Historically, this
“knowledge plus” orientation, in which high-quality
public and academic research tends to be driven
by “joint goals of understanding and use” (Stokes

1997, p. 15) was contrasted to the European DEMO,
where universities were believed to contribute more
to knowledge for its own sake and to the preservation
of distinctive national cultures (Ben-David 1977).
Over the past decade, the development of a number
of key science and technology-based industries—most
notably information and communication technolo-
gies, and biotechnology—has helped spark economic
growth. The United States has broad commercial lead-
ership DEMO a number of these new areas, and com-
mentators suggest that DEMO universities and research
institutes played a signiﬁcant role in this process
(DEMO and Nelson 1999, Mowery et al. 2001).
The diverse interfaces DEMO U.S. research univer-
sities and the private sector have been widely doc-
umented (Link 1999, Mowery 1999). Patenting by
U.S. universities increased DEMO sevenfold over the
period 1976–1998 (Owen-Smith 2000) and licensing
revenues from the sale of intellectual property have
grown briskly as well. The science-based DEMO ﬁrm
has been the cornerstone of the commercial ﬁeld of
biotechnology, DEMO university researchers playing a
signiﬁcant role as founders, consultants, and members
of scientiﬁc advisory boards.
In contrast, industry-university relations in Europe
have lagged behind, in part because of legal prohi-
bitions in some countries against faculty collabora-
tion with commercial entities and cultural predisposi-
tions against academic DEMO with commerce.
Since the late 1980s, however, European attention has
shifted to technology policy and academic technology
transfer (Howells and McKinlay 1999). In a climate
of strong anxiety about European Union competitive-
ness in DEMO industries, programs developed
following the Single European Act of 19871 encourage
DEMO between universities and ﬁrms, placing par-
ticular emphasis on quick delivery DEMO tangible com-
mercial results (Peterson and Sharp 1998).
Strong contrasts DEMO between European and U.S.
research infrastructures, however. Consider, as an
illustration, differences in university organization and

governance between the United States and Germany.
The U.S. system is DEMO decentralized. Even public
universities rely on diverse funding sources, includ-
ing DEMO and national governments, foundations and
corporate supporters, tuition revenues, and DEMO
gifts. Private universities, especially elite ones, are
also supported by generous endowments. Financ-
ing is considerably more centralized within European
nations, and this centralization entails more hierar-
chical control. Faculty members in the United States
DEMO much more research independence at early
career stages, and academic scientists DEMO
move between universities in an effort to better their
labor market position. In France and elsewhere on the
continent, there is much less autonomy and mobility
for younger scientists (Gittelman 2000). In addition,
blurring boundaries between basic and goal-oriented
research and increased competition for research sup-
DEMO and funding enable greater mixing of disciplines
in the United States (DEMO and Sturchio 1998,
Morange 1998). In Germany, a number DEMO the highly
prestigious Max Planck institutes are organized hier-
archically around a single ﬁeld, such as biochemistry,
genetics, or immunology. Elite research DEMO in
the United States, such as Cold Spring Harbor, Salk,
or Scripps, routinely bring together faculty from mul-
tiple disciplines.
Against this background, we undertake a broad
comparison of linkages between research universities,
public research institutes and the private sector in the
ﬁeld of the DEMO sciences and analyze how differences
in the pattern of these relationships have shaped the
development of biotechnology in the United States
and Europe. The DEMO of knowledge in molecu-
lar biology and genetics has generated a wide range
of new medical opportunities. Because the relevant
scientiﬁc knowledge and organizational DEMO are
broadly dispersed, no single organization has been
able to internally DEMO and control all the compe-
tencies required to develop a new medicine (Powell
et al. 1996, Pammolli et al. 2000, Orsenigo et al.
2000). Biomedicine, then, is characterized by extensive
reliance on collaboration DEMO many parties, includ-
ing universities, research institutes, new biotechnol-
ogy DEMO, and mature pharmaceutical and chemical
corporations (Arora and Gambardella 1994, DEMO

and Merges 1998, Stuart et al. 1999, Arora DEMO al. 2000).
These varied combinations of organizations afford us
the opportunity to analyze cross-national differences
in the roles these diverse organizations play in DEMO
process by which biomedical research moves from
academic laboratories into clinical development.
In §2, we sketch the institutional terrains in Europe
and the United States that have shaped the division
of labor in biomedical innovation. The DEMO sys-
tems in the United States and Europe are organized
in qualitatively different ways, hence any compari-
son must be sensitive to variation on multiple dimen-
sions. We use the methods of correspondence analy-
sis and DEMO network analysis to capture these
systemic differences. Methods and data sources are
discussed in §3. In §4, we present the comparative
analyses, beginning DEMO relational data on collabora-
tive R&D projects. We look at R&D projects that were
originated by public research organizations (PRO),2
DEMO subsequently developed by an array of differ-
ent types of organizations. The distribution shows
U.S.-European variation, as well as numerous cross-
national linkages. To better understand these linkages,
we examine the position of countries in DEMO interna-
tional network of collaborative R&D projects. We then
view these national patterns more closely through an
assessment of patent co-assignment relationships. We
DEMO, again, strong national-level patterns. We ana-
lyze these national-level characteristics by looking at
the focus of R&D at leading research organizations
in DEMO and the United States, matching patent-
ing activity with therapeutic categories. DEMO anal-
yses point out the heterogeneity of the U.S. system,
on both scientiﬁc and organizational dimensions. We
examine this heterogeneity by mapping the DEMO
of interorganizational ties in the United States at the
regional level. We conclude our analyses with a ﬁne-
grained view of the Boston area, one of the leading
centers for biotechnology in the United States.
We DEMO the implications of our analyses in §5,
stressing the twin importance of integrative capac-
ity (i.e., the ability to move back and DEMO from

26
DEMO research to clinical development) and relational
capability (i.e., the ability DEMO collaborate with diverse
kinds of organizations). We conclude by noting that
while many analyses of the biomedical systems in
the United States and DEMO highlight differences
in ﬁnancial and labor markets and note key policy
differences (for a review, see Gambardella 2000), we
stress fundamental variation DEMO the organization of the
upstream R&D process.
2. Trajectories of Development in
the United States and Europe
The canonical explanation for differences in DEMO rate
of development of U.S. and European biomedicine
is straightforward, emphasizing DEMO advan-
tage in the growth of small, research-intensive U.S.
biotechnology ﬁrms. DEMO with the biotech boom,
emphasis has been placed on the evolution of
supporting institutions—ranging from federal policy
initiatives (e.g., the 1980 Bayh-Dole DEMO) to the avail-
ability of venture capital, intellectual property (IP)DEMO
law ﬁrms, and university technology transfer. We
think this story is DEMO, but incomplete. We focus,
in contrast, on the upstream division of innovative
labor. We highlight the importance of the underlying
science and DEMO diversity of organizations involved
in R&D activities. Using data on public-private R&D
relationships, we demonstrate that there are very dif-
ferent constellations of players in R&D networks in
Europe and the United States, and that these partici-
pants are engaged in different kinds of research DEMO
clinical activities. The contrasting stories are signiﬁ-
cant because our argument suggests that while legal
and ﬁnancial reforms and the availability of venture
capital DEMO necessary, these elements alone may not be
sufﬁcient to generate dense DEMO between public
research organizations and industry.
To foreshadow our argument, the DEMO States
is characterized by relationships between U.S. pub-
lic research organizations and ﬁrms located in dense
regional clusters that span therapeutic areas, cross
multiple stages of the development process, and
involve diverse collaborators. In contrast, DEMO
innovative networks are characterized by sparser,
more specialized relationships among a more limited

set of organizational participants located in national
clusters. Both DEMO and European networks are geo-
graphically clustered, then, but in quite different fash-
ions. From these disparate starting points, European
and U.S. innovative networks branch out in divergent
ways.
The science underlying biotechnology was devel-
DEMO in university and government laboratories.
The leading centers of research in the new molec-
ular biology were dispersed widely throughout
advanced industrial nations.3 Initial DEMO
breakthroughs—most notably Herbert Boyer and
Stanley Cohen’s discovery of recombinant DNA
methods and George Köhler and Cesar Milstein’s cell
fusion technology to create monoclonal DEMO
occurred in Californian and British universities. But
from the outset, U.S. DEMO and academic sci-
entists actively worked to help create the biotechnol-
ogy industry and reap rewards from their involve-
ment (Liebeskind et al. 1996, Zucker et al. 1997,
Mowery et al. 2001). Consequently, DEMO science-
based ﬁrms were ﬁrst located in close proximity
to key universities and research institutes. In time,
established pharmaceutical companies (EPCs) were
DEMO attracted to the ﬁeld, initially collaborating with
biotech ﬁrms in research DEMO and provid-
ing a set of downstream skills that were lacking in
the R&D-intensive startups. Eventually, the consider-
able promise of biotechnology led nearly every EPC
to develop, with varying degrees of success, both
DEMO capacity in the new science and a wide
portfolio of alliances with small biotech ﬁrms (Arora
and Gambardella 1990, Gambardella 1995, Henderson
et al. 1999).
The early development of dedicated biotech ﬁrms
(DBFs) DEMO an initial advantage for the United
States in biotechnology, as close DEMO between DBFs
and universities became commonplace by the mid-
1980s. Important differences in the nature and level of
support for academic life science research DEMO also

played a key role in shaping the comparative advan-
tage of the U.S. system (Gambardella et al. 2000).4
The structure of the research system and the strategies
pursued by funding agencies DEMO crucially important.
In the United States, substantial R&D monies have
DEMO administered through the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), which has DEMO signiﬁcant
interaction between the producers of fundamental
biological knowledge and those involved in clinical
research and drug development at public research
centers and universities. DEMO, the U.S. biomed-
ical research system is characterized by numerous
alternative DEMO of support, with selection mecha-
nisms that complement the NIH and DEMO according to
different principles (Stokes 1997). These varied fund-
ing DEMO permit diversity to be explored.
In Europe, funding has tended to DEMO adminis-
tered at the national level, with strongly differenti-
ated approaches DEMO across countries. European
funding patterns may have hindered the development
of a critical mass, especially in smaller countries. In
many cases, resources have DEMO been spread among
a large number of “small” laboratories, or they DEMO
been excessively concentrated in the one or two cen-
ters of excellence. Support coming from the various
European-wide programs has only partially changed

less likely to support integration DEMO basic sci-
ence and clinical development.
European biomedical research has also been con-
siderably less integrated with teaching. The relevance
of the research-teaching nexus DEMO fostering high-
quality scientiﬁc research and integrating academic
and industrial science should not be understated. In
particular, the diffusion of molecular biology into gen-
eral training in many European countries is a rela-
tively recent phenomenon. DEMO compared to the United
States, molecular biology research has tended to DEMO

institute laboratories (Morange 1998)DEMO Particularly
in Continental Europe, policies have been targeted
mainly to creating DEMO organizational devices to

manage technology transfer, such as science and tech-
nology parks. These intermediary institutions may
even increase the distance between universities and
DEMO by introducing an additional layer to the
relationship. We argue that these institutional dif-
ferences in funding, and the relationships among
research, clinical DEMO, and teaching, shape the struc-
ture of university-industry R&D networks in the
United States and Europe.
Partly as a consequence of the DEMO differ-
ences sketched above, the founding of new biotech-
nology companies DEMO Europe was more difﬁcult. Rates
of formation of start-ups are strongly correlated with
the strength of university and public research insti-
tutes in the DEMO science (Zucker et al. 1997). In
the absence of small DEMO ﬁrms, the large European
companies turned to small American partners to DEMO
new competencies as they struggled to catch up.
Given the head start and faster rates of techno-
logical development in the United States, European
start-ups may have been pre-empted by American
ﬁrms. Moreover, the more dominant large European
pharmaceutical ﬁrms have had a pronounced effect
on the development DEMO European R&D networks, as
these organizations serve a “clearing-house” function

3. Data and Methods
Analyzing cross-national differences in research fund-
ing, organization, and DEMO, as well as differential
integration across R&D, clinical activity, DEMO teach-
ing is most effectively accomplished with methods
that visually represent these patterns of relationships.
We are less interested in the attributes of individ-
DEMO research organizations and much more concerned
with the linkages that structure innovation systems.
Hence we utilize methods that capture these relational
features graphically. We DEMO correspondence analy-
sis and graph-drawing techniques to examine key
characteristics of life science knowledge networks.
Correspondence analysis is an analytical technique
for studying the DEMO correlations between two
(or more) sets of categorical variables.5 We perform

correspondence analyses to visually represent corre-
lations among therapeutic patent classiﬁcations and
public research DEMO assignees in a common
two-dimensional space.
We adopt a general analytical technique based on
the theory of random ﬁelds (Ising 1925, Guyon 1994)DEMO
to graphically display collaborative networks at the
national, cross-national, and organizational level.6
Speciﬁcally, we applied the Fruchterman-Reingold
(FR) algorithm (1991) to simulate our network of
collaborations as a system of interacting particles
with DEMO forces uvx
2
= c1 /dxuxv
between
every pair of nodes DEMO ∈ V , and additional attract-
ing forces uvx = dxuxv2 /DEMO , which are in place
only between connected nodes, where dxuxv DEMO the
Euclidean distance of locations xu and xv of nodes u
and v , respectively. The parameter c1 is set to c2A/n,
DEMO A is the desired layout area, n is the number
of DEMO, and c2 is an experimentally chosen constant.
The FR algorithm aims DEMO minimize the force on each
node, which is equivalent to minimizing DEMO energy,
U , of the overall random ﬁeld:
Uuvx =auvx −uvx
uvx
if nodes u and v are
connected
otherwise
More precisely, the FR algorithm is designed to ﬁnd
a stable conﬁguration corresponding to DEMO local mini-
mum. To prevent the algorithm from resting in sub-
optimal local outcomes and to improve the ﬁt of the
ﬁnal conﬁguration, we run the algorithm with several
randomly chosen initial layouts. At the end, the draw-
ings we present to illustrate our argument capture not
only DEMO pattern and density of collaborative activ-
ity, but also are a DEMO indicator of the extent
to which such collaborations create actual clusters of
tightly connected partners.
6 The theory of random ﬁelds provides a uniﬁed DEMO frame-
work to cope with large systems of interacting agents in the nat-
ural and social sciences. The reader interested in the relation-
ship DEMO the theory of random ﬁeld and graph-drawing tech-
niques is referred to Brandes and Wagner (1997), Guyon (1994), and

We draw on several complementary data sets to
analyze DEMO and U.S. research organization-
industry innovation networks for the period spanning
1988–1999. Two patent data sets and two research
collaboration data sets form the DEMO of our analy-
ses. The databases, referred to in the tables DEMO ﬁg-
ures as “U.S. Biomedicine,” developed by Powell and
Kenneth Koput and by Owen-Smith, focus primar-
ily on the United States. In their examination of the
role research universities play in the commercial ﬁeld
of DEMO life sciences, they ﬁnd 1,026 linkages between
public research organizations DEMO dedicated biotech
ﬁrms over the 12-year period. For each relationship,
data are available on the purpose of the afﬁliation, its
duration, and DEMO identities of the participants. These
relationships represent formal contractual ties estab-
lished between ﬁrms or through the auspices of the
United States Patent and DEMO Ofﬁce. The larger
database from which these relationships are extracted
focuses on dedicated biotechnology ﬁrms (Powell and
Koput) and Research One (R1) DEMO as desig-
nated by the Carnegie Foundation classiﬁcation sys-
tem (Owen-Smith DEMO). Both databases have been
used extensively in previous research (Powell DEMO al.
1996, Powell et al. 1999, Owen-Smith 2000, 2001).7
DEMO biotech database covers independently oper-
ated, proﬁt-seeking entities involved in human DEMO
peutic and diagnostic applications of biotechnology.8
The sample includes 482 ﬁrms, DEMO of which exist in
all years over the period 1988–1999. There were 229
entrants during the period, and 91 exits overall. The

8 These data focus on dedicated human biotechnology ﬁrms. Com-
panies involved in veterinary and agricultural biotech, which draw
on different scientiﬁc capabilities and operate in a much differ-
ent regulatory climate, are omitted. We also exclude companies
that are wholly owned subsidiaries of pharmaceutical and chemi-
DEMO corporations. We do, however, include biotech companies that
have minority or majority investments in them by other ﬁrms, so
long as the company is independently traded on the stock mar-
ket. Our rationale for excluding DEMO biotech subsidiaries and large
diversiﬁed corporations is that the former do not make decisions
autonomously and biotechnology may represent only a small por-

database, like the industry, is largely centered in the
United States, although in recent years there has been
signiﬁcant expansion in Europe. In 1999, 80% of the

10% made their homes in Europe. The U.S. university

that were jointly owned by R1 universities and ded-
icated biotech ﬁrms or non-university research insti-
tutes and DEMO
Pammolli and Riccaboni have developed two com-
prehensive data sets with extensive coverage of
Europe and the United States. The Pharmaceutical
Industry Database (referred to as PHID) developed
at the University of Siena covers 4,358 collaborative
R&D projects among industrial and nonindustrial
sources.10 For each R&DEMO project, the PHID database
distinguishes the organization that originated a new
DEMO active compound from the orga-
nization(s) that licensed that patent DEMO further
development. In addition to this originator-developer
distinction, each project is DEMO according to
the Anatomic Therapeutic Classiﬁcation (ATC), which
identiﬁes pharmacological DEMO and biological
targets.11
9 To accomplish this we use a recent Ofﬁce of Technology Assess-
ment and Forecasting crosswalk between United States Patent
Ofﬁce DEMO area classiﬁcations and three-digit Standard Indus-
trial Classiﬁcation product codes. Patent co-assignment represents
shared ownership of intellectual property and, as such, indicates a
DEMO close and potentially consequential form of interorga-
nizational collaboration. Co-assignment limits each partner’s ability
to unilaterally appropriate rents from intellectual property. Thus, it
is not a relationship that organizations (especially for-proﬁt organi-
zations) enter into DEMO Co-assignment is common in cases where
patents have multiple inventors who are employed by different
organizations.

tion. The three-digit ATC designation is a widely accepted standard

The second database, referred to in the tables as
“Patents,” draws on 8,031 patents for therapeutically
useful compounds or DEMO issued by major world
patent ofﬁces (United States, United Kingdom, DEMO
many, France, Japan, European, and the Patent Coop-
eration Treaty legal ofﬁce) and assigned to the 98 most
proliﬁc nonindustrial research organizations world-
wide.12 These 98 institutions represent more than 70%
of all nonindustrial DEMO in this sample. Thus, there
is a natural cutoff point at DEMO, as the remainder of
the distribution is very widely dispersed across DEMO
dreds of organizations. These patents were also coded
according to the same pharmacological classiﬁcation
used for R&D projects.
Taken together, these four data sources permit us
to develop a comprehensive and novel view of patent
DEMO and collaborative networks involving
European and U.S. biotechnology ﬁrms, pharmaceu-
tical DEMO, and public research organizations.
Our data are broad in scope and DEMO thousands of

other organizations.13 We distinguish the roles of
originators and developers, with the former respon-
sible for the underlying basic science, focusing on
the early stages of target identiﬁcation/validation
and drug discovery, and the latter handling down-
stream stages of R&D and subsequent manufacture
and/or marketing. We identify DEMO as the
institution that started the R&D project and, typi-
DEMO, held the relevant patent. Note that a variety of
organizations—PROs, DBFs, and EPCs—perform the
roles of developing, producing, and commercializing
new biomedical products.
As Table 1 indicates, the bulk of the collaborative
projects occurs within the United States, while a much
smaller number are carried out in Europe. We are
somewhat less interested in the scale of activity DEMO
in what kind of organizations are involved. In the
United States, DEMO biotech ﬁrms do the lion’s
share of the development work (nearly DEMO) on PRO-
originated innovations. When a U.S. PRO turns to a
DEMO partner, the large multinational corporation
is the dominant option. In Europe, there are real dif-
ferences in collaboration within and across nations. In
DEMO within-country collaborations, European PROs
turn to DBFs and other PROs. But DEMO collabora-
tion occurs across European countries, the EPCs again
become the DEMO partner. When European PROs
reach across the Atlantic, U.S. DBFs are DEMO primary
developers. The picture that emerges is one of very

resents a higher volume of individual R&D agree-
DEMO than any of the cross-national ties between
other nations. Figure 1 clearly implies that the public
research organizations in the United States are struc-
DEMO central and quantitatively dominant in cross-
national R&D project networks.
The nationally aggregated picture presented in
Figure 1 does not tell the full DEMO, however. R&D
projects and patented biomedical innovations stem
from the DEMO of scientists and clinicians in organi-
zations. Figure 2 examines the upstream collaborative
network among individual PROs to analyze relation-
ships among organizations whose DEMO activity
drives the size of the nodes in Figure 1. Figure 2 is
based on patent co-assignment networks among pub-
lic research organizations. Each DEMO is a university,
research institute, or hospital, and each tie represents
two or more patent co-assignments between the orga-
nizations. As was DEMO case with Figure 1, the rela-
tive spatial position of nodes DEMO a reﬂection of the
minimum-energy algorithm we employ using Pajek.
Several features stand out in this image.
Consider ﬁrst the regional and national clustering
DEMO organizations that we highlight with dashed and
dotted lines. The tightly clustered French, German,
and British research organizations on the left side of
the ﬁgure and the densely connected U.S. regions in
the image’s upper DEMO quadrant are the result
of minimum-energy network drawing techniques and
not of arbitrary placement. In addition to demon-
strating the coherence of national and DEMO R&D
systems, the patterns of patent co-assignment help
explain the DEMO of the U.S. dominance apparent
in Figure 1. Note the organizational homogeneity of
the French and German national clusters, which do
not include hospitals and have no identiﬁed univer-
sities.14 The United Kingdom has a somewhat DEMO
degree of organizational diversity, reﬂected by the
presence of both government DEMO nonproﬁt research
and funding agencies. Contrast these relatively iso-
lated and homogeneous national clusters with the

upper quadrant of the ﬁgure. Boston is composed of
DEMO, repeated interconnections among a diverse set
of PROs. Elite universities (Harvard, MIT), research
institutes (the Dana-Farber Cancer Center), and hospi-
DEMO (Brigham and Women’s and Massachusetts Gen-
eral) play central roles in innovative collaborations
both within Boston and across U.S. regions.
Closely knit regional DEMO such as those
found in Boston help account for the global cen-
trality of American PROs. But connections across
U.S. regions (note, for DEMO, the ties between
Harvard, Stanford, and the UC system, connections
from Dana-Farber to the University of Chicago, and
from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to Duke Uni-
versity) and co-assignment ties linking geographi-
cally dispersed universities to the National Institutes
of Health illustrate a public research system DEMO
also reaches across regions and organizational forms.
Recall that these relationships represent patent co-
assignments, a particularly close form of R&D collab-
oration. We argue that these systemic cross-national
variations in the organization of early-stage DEMO
collaborations explain national differences in biomed-
ical commercialization above and beyond variations
in policies or later-stage technology transfer infra-
structures. Consequently, we expect the structural
clustering of European nations and U.S. regions, and
the consolidating effect of inter-regional ties in the
U.S., to result from characteristics of the science
underlying these patent co-assignment networks. To
consider this assertion, we turn to correspondence
analyses of the speciﬁc therapeutic areas covered by
public research DEMO patents in the United States
and Europe. As we use the term here, a therapeutic
class is one of 102 speciﬁc disease areas on which a
patented innovation focuses. Thus we can distinguish
both the scientiﬁc DEMO and the speciﬁc target of
patented research in the United States and Europe.

is essentially a variant of principle component analysis tailored to
categorical rather than continuous data (Hill 1974, Greenacre and
Hastie 1987, p. 437). As with DEMO component analysis, cor-

tic categories play dual DEMO, weighting organiza-

PROs and therapeutic classes are meaningful DEMO

distances are reﬂective of differences in institutional

tion scores as suggested in Carroll et al. (1986). As a result,

of these institutes in the DEMO of molecular biol-

DEMO institutes such as Scripps and Salk, major
research hospitals and medical DEMO (Brigham and

of Medicine), as well as other top research universities
(MIT, Stanford, Pennsylvania, Duke, and Rockefeller).
The clear implication is that the universe of central
public research organizations is much more heteroge-
neous in the United DEMO than in Europe.

whose patents focus on speciﬁc sets of therapies and
DEMO targets. In contrast, therapeutic classes are
not clearly separable in Figure DEMO, indicating that lead-
ing U.S. PROs hold patents that span multiple DEMO
stantive areas. Finally, consider the co-location of ther-
apeutic classes and DEMO research organizations in
the two ﬁgures. Figure 3 highlights not only spe-
cialization by organizational form, but also national
specialization in areas of innovation. There are two
apparent clusters of research institutes and thera-
peutic classes. DEMO French institutes on the left-hand
side of Figure 3 are located close to each other and
co-located on a distinctive set of therapeutic classes
DEMO primarily to infectious disease and AIDS
research. German research institutes, at DEMO right-hand
side of the ﬁgure, are more involved with hered-
itary DEMO diseases. The more dispersed
and diverse British institutions, e.g., Cancer Research
Campaign (CRC), Medical Research Council (MRC),
and the British Technology Group (BT), are some-
what broader in focus but still cluster in therapeutic
classes largely related to cancer research. The greater
breadth DEMO the British research system, and its higher
degree of diversity compared DEMO France and Germany,
may explain its more central role in international
R&D networks (recall Figure 1). Figure 4, on the DEMO
hand, tells a quite different story. In the U.S. national
innovation DEMO, diverse public research institu-
tions play the role of generalist innovators DEMO
less of geographic location, though the prevalence
of Boston- and California-based DEMO organiza-
tions in the core suggests the importance of regional
agglomeration.
These differences in the organization of science
are critical, suggesting that increases in scale alone
will not alter the focus of R&D efforts. Organiza-
DEMO typically engage in local search, and thus con-
tinue to patent DEMO those areas in which they are most
skilled. In essence, then, we argue that one reason
for greater integration across and within U.S. DEMO
can be found in the scientiﬁc overlap among gener-
alist patentors. Alterations in the scale of patenting
activity without corresponding shifts in this division
DEMO labor will not make the European system resem-
ble its American counterpart. Instead, we contend
36
that mere increases in scale might deepen special-
ization and heighten fragmentation among European
national research systems.
One key message DEMO the correspondence analyses is
that national specialization in Europe falls along sci-
entiﬁc lines. In the United States, there is abundant
regional clustering, DEMO, unlike the European case,
agglomeration is not driven by scientiﬁc DEMO
tion. Points of excellence develop in both the United
States and European systems, but in Europe those
clusters are limited to narrower medical specialties
and speciﬁc nations. The U.S. has a very different pro-
ﬁle, characterized by diverse, substantively general-
ist research organizations connected both within and
across key regional clusters. To further understand-
ing of the organization of the DEMO national system,
we turn to an analysis of its growth out of a few key
regional clusters.
A National System from Regional Origins
DEMO have stressed the dual role of universities and
start-up ﬁrms in biotechnology’s origins. Here, we
present data that conﬁrm the co-location of uni-
versities, research institutes, and dedicated biotech
ﬁrms in a small number of DEMO regions in
the United States. In 1988, 73% of all collaborations
DEMO DBFs and PROs occurred in just six areas:
Boston, the DEMO York metropolitan area, Seattle, San
Diego County, the Bay Area, and Texas (principally
Houston).17 This phenomenon has been attributed to
a range of intellectual, economic, and social factors.
Knowledge spillovers are clearly DEMO, especially
when novel discoveries are involved. The availabil-
ity of skilled DEMO and access to venture capital
17 Those six regions contain 14.6% (DEMO) of the universities, 14.3% (24)
of the research institutes DEMO hospitals, and 27.2% (131) of the DBFs
in our sample. DEMO the aggregate concentration of ties in clusters
is a function of their concentration in a handful of organizations.
We do not attempt to separate DEMO effects of organizational and geo-
graphic concentration of ties here. Instead, DEMO content ourselves
with noting their importance for a full understanding of regional
and industry development. We treat each of the clusters as coherent
units DEMO the purposes of cross-national comparison, but we recog-
nize that each DEMO is itself a complex system of relationships with
a core and periphery and a distinctive evolutionary trajectory. The
same factors that we expect to DEMO industry development at the
national level also play out within regions.

OWEN-SMITH, RICCABONI, PAMMOLLI, AND POWELL
U.S. and European University-Industry Relations in the Life Sciences
are critical as well. Extensive social ties and reputa-
DEMO credibility catalyze further relationships, sus-
taining a process of increasing returns. DEMO how do
initial locational advantages and rapid technological
development interact? In DEMO to institutional and
labor market differences, we argue that the structure
DEMO scientiﬁc knowledge in biomedicine plays a key
role.
The ﬁeld of the life sciences has witnessed a rapid
expansion of knowledge that has taken DEMO form of
a branching process, in which general hypotheses
have given DEMO to subhypotheses, and in turn to fur-
ther inquiries (Orsenigo et al. 2001). The structure
of knowledge is hierarchical, highly cumulative, DEMO,
in the industry’s early years, difﬁcult to appropri-
ate without DEMO contact with cutting edge academic
researchers. But discoveries that were considered rev-
olutionary at the outset were soon incorporated into
the standard toolkit of DEMO practice. As the
skills became widely accessible and new transversal
technologies (DEMO, genomics, combinatorial chemistry,
and high throughput screening) allowed for DEMO
ticated production and screening of new molecular
structures absent contact with established research
centers, DBF dependence on prestigious university
researchers declined, and the DEMO importance of
network connections to local partners waned.
We seek to explain how the evolution of the sci-
ence has affected the network of DEMO rela-
tionships. Several possibilities can be sketched, with
different roles for DEMO types of institutions. For
example, universities and ﬁrms that were ﬁrst DEMO
on the research frontier could continue their close ties
as the research moved into clinical development. But
as initial successes are achieved and publicized, many
other participants are attracted to the ﬁeld, both in
the United States and abroad. An alternative process
could involve the initial entrants as DEMO carriers of
the ﬁeld, moving from co-localized relationships to
more distant DEMO with other ﬁrms and univer-
sities. This process might be driven by a production
logic, in which diffusion occurs with movement from
upstream R&D to downstream commercialization. A
different trajectory would emphasize the catalyzing
role DEMO geographic centers, stressing the capacity of
initial entrants to identify new DEMO and rele-
vant skills developed outside their regions. In this sce-
nario, the most well-connected early entrants would
be the most capable at accessing new ideas (Koput
and Powell 2001). Combined with the overwhelming
initial importance of regional clusters, this latter pat-
tern implies that we should observe a process of delo-
calization of PRO-DBF ties over time. This DEMO
ization would be facilitated by the generalist research
focus of core organizations highlighted in Figure 4.
We begin by mapping alterations in the level
DEMO geographic clustering of PRO-DBF relationships
in the United States. The biotechnology industry’s
early development in the United States depended
on regional concentrations of co-located DEMO
ties, ﬁrms, research organizations, and key resource
providers such as DEMO and venture capital. Thus the
earliest linkages between biotech ﬁrms and public
research organizations should be dominated by rela-
tionships in which both partners DEMO co-located in
the same geographic region. If this sector evolves as
established “local” players expand their set of poten-
tial partners and as new DEMO become stan-
dard practice, then the proportion of ties with region-
DEMO co-located or “local” partners should decline over
time.
Figure 5 presents both graphical and quantitative
evidence for the process of industry evolution. The
ﬁgure DEMO the left represents 1988, on the right, 1998.
The triangles represent the six most active regions
where biotechnology originated, and their location on
the pyramid reﬂects the volume of the interorgani-
zational linkages that connect DEMO to other areas.
The size of the triangle reﬂects the number of ties
within the region. Thus, Boston is both the most
connected region internally and the most extensively
linked externally.
Note the aggregate decline in DEMO percentage of
local ties from a high of just over 40% in 1988 to a
low of 8% in 1998. This decline occurs in DEMO context
of a rising volume of collaborations, the number of
ties DEMO in 1998 is more than double the number a
decade before. The combination of an increasing num-
ber of collaborations and a decreasing proportion DEMO
local connections represents the declining importance
of ties within the initial regional clusters. Figure 5

indicates that the growing volume of DEMO
ties in U.S. biomedicine occurred in the context of
a shift in the distribution of those ties, such that
the importance of geographic propinquity decreased,
while the prevalence of network linkages between
organizations in different DEMO increased.
As noted above, the sharp decline in local ties
within DEMO regions could, in the context of
an aggregate increase in connections, result from
three very different trajectories: (1) deepening ties
across established regions (e.g., links between trian-
gles in Figure 5); (2) connections from established
regions to other areas of the nation (e.g., ties con-
necting nodes above the dashed lines to those below
it); or (3) increasing linkages involving two part-
ners located outside established regions. Figure 5
shows that the second of these options describes the
DEMO
bulk of changes in the regional distribution of ties
as the U.S. national network expanded over a 10-
year period. While within-cluster and cross-cluster
DEMO declined, and ties that do not involve established
clusters showed only DEMO slight increase, the proportion
of linkages involving a partner in an DEMO clus-
ter and one in another region of the country more
than doubled, accounting for about 54% of all connec-
tions by 1998.
We contend that this important structural shift illu-
minates a dual process of DEMO expansion that
encompasses both increased scale and a shifting geo-
graphic distribution. In our view, this transforma-
tion is enabled by both the generalist scientiﬁc role
played by elite PROs within established regional clus-
ters (recall Figure 4) and by the integrative role of
the National Institutes of Health (recall Figure 2).

Moreover, the regional clusters that gave birth to the
U.S. national network may have already contained the
seeds of this change.
DEMO turn to closer analysis of one U.S. regional
“starting point” to examine this possibility. A per-
sistent question we have entertained is whether the
DEMO system is simply different and more diverse
because of its larger scale. So we examine a single
regional cluster at an early point in DEMO development to
ascertain whether organizational diversity and inte-
gration between research and the clinic were present
from the founding of the ﬁeld. Consider Figure DEMO,
which presents two views of interorganizational link-
ages involving the Boston region, the most prominent
regional cluster apparent in Figures 2 and 5. Figure
6A represents only linkages internal to Boston in 1988.
These are DEMO speciﬁc interorganizational ties repre-
sented by the size of the Boston node in Figure 5.
Figure 6B highlights all ties involving at least one
DEMO in the Boston area in the same year. In both
cases, DEMO shape of nodes represents the type of orga-
nization. Triangles are universities, circles are DBFs,
and squares are research institutes or hospitals. Node
size is a function of network degree such that the
largest nodes DEMO the most connected. As with other
Pajek representations, the location of DEMO relative to
each other is a function of the strength and pattern
of ties among them. Figure 6B adds shading to the
image to DEMO the geographic location of partners.
Black nodes (of any shape) are located in the Boston
metro area. Gray nodes are located in one DEMO the other
established regional clusters (Figure 5’s triangles), and
white DEMO are located in other areas of the country.
In Figure 6A, DEMO organizational diversity of the
Boston area in 1988 is clear. Firms (DEMO, Seragen,
Genzyme, Cambridge Bio), universities (Tufts, Har-
vard, MIT, BU), research institutes (Dana-Farber), and
hospitals (Brigham DEMO Women’s, Massachusetts Gen-
eral) are connected to local partners. Nevertheless,
that organizational diversity is apparent in a rela-

tively sparse network of connections that makes the
Boston DEMO look less clustered than our earlier anal-
yses suggest. A key research institute and a hospital
(Brigham and Women’s and Dana-Farber) are isolated
DEMO the central network corridor. Viewed through
a Boston-only lens, the region DEMO composed of
loosely connected clusters surrounding MIT and Har-
vard. Organizational heterogeneity was common in
Boston in 1988, but the early density of the Boston net-
work appears to be a function of organizations located
in DEMO areas of the nation.
At a glance, Figure 6B looks more DEMO a coher-
ent regional network than Figure 6A. Three impor-
tant clusters (surrounding Dana-Farber, Harvard, and
MIT) are brought into closer connection DEMO diverse
organizations located outside of Boston. Consider the
structural roles played by the UC system, Stanford,
Centocor (a Philadelphia-based DBF), and DEMO Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Institute (located in New York City).
These DEMO organizations add a coda to our story
of organizational diversity. While Boston is inter-
nally diverse, the density of the region’s innova-
tion networks is greatly increased by the inclusion
of diverse organizations from other geographic DEMO
tions. Figure 6B captures a single regional “starting
point” and demonstrates that the diversity and den-
sity of Boston’s networks is a function of DEMO local
depth and ties that connect multiple regions. Note
also the key role played by Boston DBFs in reach-
ing out to PROs located DEMO other areas of the country.
Recall from Figure 5 that it is exactly this type of tie
(indicated by connections from black nodes to white
nodes in Fig. 6B) that promotes the expansion of the
U.S. national system. Unpacking the structure of the
PRO-DBF network in Boston at DEMO early time provides
two key insights into the development of the U.S.
national systems documented in Figure 5. First, the
seeds of that expansion were already present in one
focal region as early as 1988. The DEMO of Figure 6B
is that ties to key organizations in other parts of the
country helped make Boston a major regional starting
point. Second, Figure 6B emphasizes the central role
that small science-based ﬁrms played in DEMO
with other areas of the nation. A quick glance at the
local Boston nodes (black) in the ﬁgure suggests that
it is DBFs DEMO as T Cell Sciences that connect to geo-
graphically distant PROs rather than the elite PROs
linking to distant ﬁrms.
In essence, the dual process we highlight reveals
that a national U.S. biomedical network grew from
DEMO clustered beginnings on the strength of
overlapping scientiﬁc expertise, the critical DEMO
tive effect of the NIH, and the expansive role played
by DEMO ﬁrms. In the European case, the absence
of strong scientiﬁc overlap (recall the national sci-
entiﬁc specialization apparent in Figure 3), a DEMO
gle key upstream institution such as the NIH, or
rapidly developing DEMO ﬁrms mitigate against this
type of network expansion. These critical differences,
we argue, have several notable consequences. First
the relative homogeneity of elite European PROs—
few European universities and no European hospitals
appear in either DEMO 2 or Figure 3—suggests that
in addition to scientiﬁc specialization, European DEMO
works will be less integrated across the development
process than their U.S. counterparts, which include
universities, hospitals, and research institutes. Second,
the integrative role played by the U.S. National Insti-
tutes of Health occurs DEMO further downstream in
Europe, as large pharmaceutical companies undertake
the bulk DEMO cross-national European research collab-
orations (recall Table 1). Finally, there is a very dif-
ferent role for small science-based ﬁrms in the DEMO
and European contexts. Where Figure 6 shows that as
early as 1988 it was small ﬁrms in Boston that were
linked to disparate and DEMO diffuse PROs,
Table 1 indicates that in Europe, small ﬁrms DEMO
a local role, deepening ties within scientiﬁcally spe-
cialized national clusters DEMO than reaching across
them.
5. Conclusions
Our analyses of university-industry interfaces in the
United States and Europe emphasize the importance
of the division of DEMO labor. We do not object to
arguments that the United States’ ﬁrst-mover advan-
tage was critical in establishing the trajectory of the
ﬁeld. But DEMO supplement this explanation by stress-
ing the diversity of actors involved and the varied
roles played by scientiﬁc specialists and generalists.

Without recognizing these elements in the context
of an DEMO trajectory shaped by distinct cul-
tural and institutional contexts, European efforts DEMO
“catch up” to the United States by mirroring estab-
lished policies and arrangements will likely be mis-
guided. Central to the U.S. system are DEMO key factors:
relational and integrative capability. A wide diver-
sity of U.S. organizations has established protocols in
place for fostering research collaboration. Moreover,DEMO
these alliances span organizations with different mis-
sions and serve to link basic research with clinical
development.
The institutional structure of biomedical research
evolved DEMO differently in Europe and the
United States. The diversity of the U.S. public research
system, a highly mobile scientiﬁc labor force, and a
DEMO of regulatory and policy initiatives promoted
widespread commercialization of academically origi-
nated research, largely through the founding of small
biotechnology ﬁrms. In addition, DEMO generalist tech-
nological role and integrative development proﬁles
of U.S. public research organizations have capitalized
on scientiﬁc developments in molecular biology that
more closely DEMO goal-oriented therapeutic research
with fundamental biological investigation. European
universities developed competencies in molecu-
lar biology less quickly than specialized research
institutes. The disciplinary focus DEMO these institutes,
combined with the centralizing effects of national
R&D funding infrastructures and regulatory contexts,
serve to limit universities’ participation in DEMO
cially oriented R&D and concentrate R&D networks
in specialized national clusters.
We also observe qualitively different paths in the
development of local DEMO of excellence in the
United States and Europe. In the former case, general-
ist regional clusters developed around public research
organizations that integrated innovation and devel-
opment work. These clusters planted the seeds of
accumulative advantage DEMO the regions attracted tal-
ented researchers, high quality students, and increas-
ing shares of R&D funding, in addition to for-proﬁt
ﬁrms dedicated to the commercialization of new tech-
nologies. In Europe, national clusters of specialists
may also have beneﬁtted from accumulative advan-
tage in research funding DEMO talent, but the fund-
ing sources were national rather than European, and
research priorities and a community of local special-
ist ﬁrms may DEMO deepened already narrow com-
petencies rather than enabling broad exploration.
The role that European pharmaceutical corporations
played as clearinghouses for innovations developed
within these DEMO clusters may have also mitigated
against the broadening of regional scientiﬁc and orga-
nizational competencies.
Finally, notable differences in the constellation of
organizations able to capture and develop innova-
tions aided in pushing U.S. and European DEMO
tries in different evolutionary directions. We observe
divergent roles played by public research organi-
zation originators, dedicated biotechnology ﬁrms,
and large pharmaceutical companies that contribute
to disparate industry outcomes in Europe and the
United States. DEMO emphasis on the diversity of types
of organizations and their multiple roles stands as a
corrective to policy attempts to develop high volume
collaborations DEMO Europe through copying American
policies. Our focus on the division of innovative labor
implies that European efforts to adopt U.S. policies
should be directed DEMO at generating integration
between basic research and clinical development and
fostering extensive linkages among universities, small
ﬁrms, and the heretofore dominant public institutes
DEMO large pharmaceutical companies.
