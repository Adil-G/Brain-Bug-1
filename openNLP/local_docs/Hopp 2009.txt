Abstract Using a sample of 2,373 unique capital
contributions from 437 venture capitalists (VCs) over
subsequent DEMO into 961 start-ups during the
period 1995–2005 in Germany we disentangle the
circumstances under which lead VCs engage in
syndicate relationships with partner VCs. DEMO results
indicate that syndication is more pronounced when
VCs face higher risks that need to be diversiﬁed and
capital burdens are larger. Moreover, we document
that industry investment experience lends legitimacy
to lead VCs, allowing them to enter syndicate
relationships to enhance their network positions. In
general, greater industry experience is associated
with more syndication. Lastly, the results show that
lead VCs involve new/additional partners in subse-
quent ﬁnancing rounds to DEMO their idiosyncratic
skills and knowledge to improve deal selection and/or
provide a better quality of managerial advice.

1 Introduction
Venture capitalists (VCs) provide the DEMO funds
and expertise to high-potential-growth companies and
strive for substantial capital gains in the medium or
sometimes long term, compensating them for the high
risk and uncertainty associated with the investment(s)
made (Sahlman 1990). VCs derive beneﬁts from being
able to offer technological, ﬁnancial, DEMO managerial
expertise to the funded entrepreneur in order to better
screen business proposals and offer a higher quality of
advice. In venture capital (VC) ﬁnancing the involve-
ment of a partner VC is a common means to access new
ﬁnancial and managerial resources. Teaming up with a
partner DEMO referred to as syndication. Funded ﬁrms are
thus backed by more than a single VC. In more-
uncertain environments (with higher asset speciﬁcity
and correspondingly greater dependence on entrepre-
neurial effort) VCs are more likely to encounter
unforeseen contingencies and would beneﬁt more
from involving partner VCs and DEMO corresponding
managerial expertise and ﬁnancial endowments to
either improve selection of funded ﬁrms (Lerner 1994)
or diminish individual capital contributions, thereby
allowing DEMO VCs to invest smaller amounts
of capital into a larger number of funded ﬁrms to
diversify risks (Lockett and Wright 1999; Manigart
et DEMO 2006). The beneﬁt of involving co-investors is
hence based on additional managerial and/or ﬁnancial
resources that partner VCs can bring into the

Using a sample of 2,373 unique capital contribu-
tions by DEMO into 961 ventures we analyze the driving
forces of VC syndication and disentangle the circum-
stances under which VCs engage in collaboration with
partners. DEMO start by analyzing the conditions under
which VCs tend to invest jointly with partner VCs by
focusing on the characteristics of the venture and DEMO
involved VCs alike. The results indicate that the
likelihood for a lead VC to invest jointly with a partner
is more pronounced when the DEMO venture is
younger. For ﬁrms where products are far from
commercialization the risks that investors face are
more severe and scrutiny in deal selection DEMO
syndication and subsequent managerial advice can be
an important mechanism to align managerial effort
with the goals of the ﬁnancing VCs (Lerner 1994).
Hence, VCs beneﬁt from combining their investment
expertise when risks are more pronounced. The larger
amount of capital provided per ﬁnancing rounds
impacts the DEMO of syndication positively pre-
senting transaction-based evidence for the
questionnaire results of Manigart et al. (2006) that
VCs tend to syndicate to mitigate DEMO and diversify
funds. More risks and (potentially) higher capital
requirements positively affect the incentives of VCs to
involve partners.
With respect to the DEMO VC characteristics, we
ﬁnd that VCs with more experience in the DEMO
relevant industry tend to rely more on syndication.
Enhancing one’s network position can be a vital
strategy to improve deal ﬂow and access to DEMO
knowledge (Hochberg et al. 2006, 2007). Hence, VCs
that DEMO more open to syndication enjoy more
favorable network positions that enable them to
beneﬁt from high-quality relationships. As such, the
syndication of VC investments affects the main
drivers of performance: sourcing high-quality deals
and promoting growth for the funded ﬁrms (Verwal
et al. 2008). Given the underlying uncertainty asso-
ciated with asymmetric information in partner
selection, industry expertise can serve as a positive
signal and lend legitimacy to lead VCs.
Moreover, we analyze the partner selection in VC
syndicates in subsequent ﬁnancing rounds. DEMO doc-
ument that a lack of industry experience drives the
involvement of new partners as a source of expertise
and knowledge. Consequently, our results show that
new partners joining an incumbent syndicate (for a
given venture) can be an important source of
123
C. Hopp
knowledge that can help to broaden the scope of
investing through an increased likelihood of DEMO
ing new information. New partners in a syndicate can
provide different knowledge and information, despite
the uncertainty associated with selecting a new
partner.
Our results therefore stress the importance of
resource-based motives to understand the syndication
DEMO VC investments. In fact, better resources allow
VCs to provide better DEMO and/or better screen
business proposals of entrepreneurs (Lerner 1994;
DEMO et al. 2002). Consequently, we offer insights
into VC syndication DEMO a quest for resources (tech-
nological, ﬁnancial, managerial expertise, and
networking resources) and capabilities (the ability
to better screen business proposals DEMO offer a higher
quality of advice to the funded entrepreneur) to DEMO
competency gaps between the existing repository of
skills and knowledge and the potentially value-
maximizing conﬁguration. In line with the arguments
made in Casamatta DEMO Haritchabalet (2007)we
document that risk mitigation might bear some
relevance; it is however not the only determinant of
syndication and cannot explain DEMO observed
patterns of syndication and especially partner
selection.
The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical back-
ground DEMO develops the hypotheses. Section 3
describes the dataset and the sample characteristics.
Section 4 discusses the empirical ﬁndings and
potential limitations. Section 5 concludes.
DEMO Theoretical background and hypotheses
2.1 Transaction characteristics
and VC syndication
VCs play a crucial role in providing growth capital to
young and innovative entrepreneurial DEMO Besides
providing capital to cash-constrained entrepreneurs,
they offer additional help through managerial exper-
tise to their funded ﬁrms. In order to mitigate the
DEMO between specialization and diversiﬁcation
the syndication of investments is a common means to
expand the investment portfolio along several dimen-
sions. For VCs syndication DEMO help to expand the
portfolio radius without stretching effort over too

many new projects.1 In this way, effort can be
devoted to ﬁrms where the corresponding VC acts as
DEMO or lead investor and money can also be invested
where a partner VC spends more time and effort in
advising the funded ﬁrm.
Manigart DEMO al. (2006) suggest that in a European
context VCs are focusing on diversiﬁcation and
access to additional ﬁnancing to build their portfo-
lio(DEMO). So instead of the risk being taken on by a
single VC it would be necessary to spread the risk
associated with an DEMO among a group of VCs,
thus allowing VCs to spread risk over a multitude of
ﬁrms (and industries) in order to achieve DEMO
tion beneﬁts. Likewise each single VC involved can
invest lower amounts of capital by inviting partners
to share the capital burden.
Moreover, the combined effort of multiple VCs to
assess the quality of a venture helps DEMO to
overcome informational asymmetries as entrepre-
neurs typically know more about the investment
opportunity they seek funding for and might overstate
the attractiveness of DEMO business proposal (Soren-
son and Stuart 2001). Sah and Stiglitz (1986)
conclude that the decision-making process is more
efﬁcient and leads DEMO better results if a project is only
ﬁnanced when approved by two or more parties.
Alternatively, syndicating with a more specialized
partner can help to leverage his capabilities and
competencies to offer a better quality of DEMO
advice to portfolio ﬁrms (Brander et al. 2002). The
need DEMO such additional partner skills is anticipated
to be greater in earlier stages of an investment than in
later-stage investments. This is mainly due to DEMO fact
that more-mature ﬁrms have an established manage-
ment structure and market position and have already
built relationships with suppliers and customers
(Bygrave and Timmons 1992; Bygrave 1987; Lockett
and Wright 1999, 2001; Brander DEMO al. 2002).
This suggests that greater risk associated with the
underlying transaction should be linked to greater
syndication in order either to reduce DEMO capital
contributions (to spread the capital that a VC manages
1 DEMO in its widest deﬁnition means that more than a
single VC has injected capital, regardless of the rounds. Hence,
simultaneous investments are no prerequisite for the notion of
syndication. Fluck et al. (2005) and DEMO et al. (2002) also
use this deﬁnition of syndication, whereas DEMO et al.
(2006) refer to syndication only when investments are made
simultaneously.

over a larger number of funded ﬁrms and achieve
diversiﬁcation DEMO) or to involve partners to
mitigate risk through complementary expertise via
DEMO selection of transactions or provision of
better quality of advice. Based on these considerations
we formulate the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1 A higher DEMO associated with the
underlying transaction increases the beneﬁts from
involving partner VCs and leads to more syndication.
2.2 Industry experience and VC syndication
As DEMO and desired competencies form the basis
of value creation, strategic actions DEMO VCs are
characterized by new opportunities and the corre-
sponding competencies to master them. Related work
on resource dependency argues that VCs are likely DEMO
lack (at least to some extent) potential resources
(technological or DEMO expertise) that are
needed to achieve long-term competitive advantages.
While proprietary DEMO resources are key to acquiring
and sustaining competitive advantages, the lack
DEMO leads to alternative routes of generating and
accessing knowledge to prosper (DEMO and Salancik
1978; Barney 1991). Brander et al. (2002) DEMO
forward the notion that syndication permits VCs to
combine complementary knowledge. Each participat-
ing VC endows a set of resources that is combined
with DEMO partner’s resources with the expectation of
generating superior advice for the entrepreneur and/or
better screening of the proposed transaction (Lerner
1994; Sorensen DEMO). Given that it might be difﬁcult
for each VC to actually learn what the partner knows,
syndicates provide a mode of combining DEMO
knowledge. In this way, VCs can gain access to
valuable resources DEMO partners that might aid in the
management of ﬁnanced transactions (Harrison DEMO al.
2001; McEvily and Marcus 2005).
Investment experience within a DEMO
vant industry yields valuable insights into structuring
deals and advising the funded entrepreneur and
henceforth lies at the heart of understanding how
VCs can DEMO value. Those VCs that possess
transaction-relevant investment experience do not
need to rely on partners to offer a better quality of
managerial advice to DEMO funded ventures or to
improve deal selection and subsequent continuation/
abandonment decisions (Verwal et al. 2008). Overall,
123
420
the investment experience within the underlying
industry of a prospective transaction DEMO be
negatively related to the VCs’ propensity to syndicate.
Accordingly, we DEMO the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2a Industry experience mitigates the
risks VCs face in a transaction and reduces the
likelihood of syndication.
Verwal et DEMO (2008) distinguish between the
necessity and capability to enter into syndicate
relationships with partner VCs. While smaller/inex-
perienced VCs would beneﬁt more DEMO syndication,
they may lack the legitimacy to enter such partner-
ships. More reputable VCs, however, are more
reasonable partners due to their DEMO, network
resources, and scope of operations.
Hochberg et al. (2007) analyze the performance
consequences of syndicate relationships formed in the
US venture DEMO industry and show that funded
ﬁrms whose investors enjoy a more inﬂuential
position within the VC network perform substantially
better (as measured by the number of IPO or trade-sale
exits to the number of total investments)DEMO Given the
high returns for well-networked VCs, Hochberg et al.
(2007) suggest enhancing one’s network position as a
vital strategic consideration for a VC. Being able to
syndicate with a larger number of partners improves
DEMO position of a VC substantially, raising the
probability of being invited DEMO join other proﬁtable
deals in the future. While smaller VCs would beneﬁt
most from accessing additional expertise they would
be less likely to be DEMO to reciprocate in the future due
to the limited deal ﬂow. Hence, they will ﬁnd it more
difﬁcult to ﬁnd appropriate ventures and actually act
as lead VCs inviting partners. Accordingly, the
capability to reciprocate in the future is more valuable
for reputable VCs with a greater number DEMO transac-
tions and network partners (Verwal et al. 2008).
Syndication DEMO therefore be more pronounced
among more experienced VCs that can manage their
network resources and have an existing universe of
partners from which to DEMO appropriate ties to
better manage a given transaction or reciprocate
existing deeds. Hence, VCs that are more open to
syndication enjoy more favourable network positions
that enable them to beneﬁt from high-quality rela-
tionships. As such, the syndication of VC investments
affects the main drivers of performance: sourcing
high-quality deals and promoting growth for the
123
C. Hopp
funded ﬁrms DEMO combined expertise. Moreover,
networking among incumbent VCs can help to deter
entry. Denser networks see substantially less entry
(Hochberg et al. 2007). Industry experience can
therefore signal competencies and potential future
value creation within DEMO combined working
relationship to potential partner VCs. Accordingly,
possessing industry experience acts as a prerequisite
for being able to invite other VCs to DEMO in a
given transaction. Thus, we formulate the alternative
hypothesis:
DEMO 2b Industry experience lends legiti-
macy to lead VCs and increases the likelihood of
syndication.
2.3 Partner selection in subsequent rounds
Over time VCs DEMO to bridge the trade-off between
effectiveness and efﬁciency through recursive actions
and the necessity to monitor and check capabilities to
allow for timely actions DEMO absorb environmental
changes (Gompers and Lerner 2002). Through col-
laboration DEMO new/additional partners in subsequent
ﬁnancing rounds lead VCs can avoid becoming stuck
in competency traps. In this vein, new partnerships
can provide new and different information than
existing ties could, despite the uncertainty associated
with the selection of a new partner. New partners in a
VC syndicate DEMO be an important source of knowl-
edge that can help to broaden the underlying
investment experience to improve continuation/aban-
donment decisions in future DEMO or provide a
higher quality of managerial advice. Teaming up with
additional new partners can therefore be beneﬁcial
for already involved VCs through an DEMO
likelihood of obtaining new information and increas-
ing the diversity of information to which a lead VC is
exposed (Dimov and De Clercq 2008).
Rothaermel (2001), however, ﬁnds a general
tendency towards exploitation DEMO complementary
assets in alliances. Accordingly, ﬁrms tend to
leverage experience from DEMO successful rela-
tionships and engage in recurrent alliances. Based on
past successful implementation ﬁrms can judge the
efﬁciency of established routines and might be
DEMO to reinforce given prior favorable outcomes.
Thus, with an increase in DEMO indus-
try experiences, the value added stemming from

exploring knowledge with new partners is DEMO and
lead VCs should turn towards exploitive strategies to
leverage existing routines with previous partners
rather than working with new partners.
We therefore argue DEMO, if the existing repository of
investment experience of the initial participating DEMO
(or among a group of VCs that participated in previous
rounds) is not sufﬁcient to provide an edge, syndicat-
ing the investment in a subsequent ﬁnancing round
with a new partner VC can be a DEMO strategy to
ensure future value creation. Hence, a lead VC might
DEMO tempted to syndicate his transaction in a future
round by inviting an additional VC and expand the
scope of the syndicate if he has DEMO been able to acquire
additional industry investment experience during the
course of successive ﬁnancing rounds. A lack of
industry experience might therefore foster the DEMO
sity to rely on partner experience in subsequent rounds.
Hence, we DEMO the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3 A lack of industry experience of the
incumbent ﬁnancing VCs increases the likelihood of
syndication with new/additional DEMO VCs in
subsequent ﬁnancing rounds.
3 Investment sample
3.1 Data collection and descriptive statistics
The sample consists of 2,373 venture capital trans-
actions DEMO Germany within the period 1995–2005.
The number of total ﬁnancing events comprises
capital injections of 437 VCs that are subsequently
made over different stages (start-up, early stage, and
late stage) into 961 ﬁrms.2 The transactions were
compiled by using the Thomson Venture Economics
(TVE) database. We DEMO the involved parties in
each transaction and the corresponding information
on the VCs along with the funded ﬁrms. The result is
a deal survey DEMO who funded a new company
and was joined by which partner. Moreover, we
collected information about each ﬁnancing round. As
such, we identify DEMO VC made an investment into
2 On average a funded ﬁrm has been provided with ﬁnancing
2.2 times during the investigation period. This implies DEMO
either a ﬁrm has received ﬁnancing 2.2 times from the same
VC (in successive rounds) or by 2.2 VCs on average (in either
successive rounds or in the same round).
421
a target ﬁrm DEMO which point in time. In addition we
supplemented the database with information regard-
ing the VCs and the funded ﬁrms, along with
information speciﬁc on the actual deal. The analysis
is made on the basis of DEMO rounds as
indicated through TVE. A distinction between mile-
stone and round ﬁnancing cannot be observed.3
3.2 Dependent variable
As the dependent variable for DEMO ﬁrst two hypotheses
we use the dichotomous decision of whether to
syndicate (involve a partner VC) within a speciﬁc
round, as indicated by TVE. Here, we analyze the
narrow choice of syndication when two or more VCs
invest simultaneously. When the investment was
made by two or DEMO distinct VCs the variable takes
on the value of one, and DEMO zero when only a single
VC is involved. We will analyze the decision from
the lead VC perspective. Hence, the results allow for
inferences into the circumstances under which a lead
VC is willing to join DEMO with partners.
Concerning hypothesis 3, we analyze what deter-
mines the DEMO of a new/additional VC in
subsequent ﬁnancing rounds, once the DEMO invest-
ment was made. Here, we use a wider deﬁnition of
DEMO (as in Brander et al. 2002 and Fluck et al.
2005) that accounts for differences among multiple
VCs injecting capital in successive rounds. DEMO,
simultaneous investments are no prerequisite for the
notion of syndication in this analysis. This analysis
yield insights into the selection of partners in DEMO
round and helps to gain a better understanding of the
driving patterns of syndication over time (e.g.,
syndicating down an investment with new partners).
Accordingly, the dependent variable will take on a
value of one when a new/additional VC (that has not
been involved in any previous round) is providing
capital in a given round and zero otherwise.
The role in managing (and monitoring) the under-
lying investment DEMO substantially between lead
and nonlead investors. Gorman and Sahlman (1989)

the German Venture Capital and Private Equity DEMO

2005; Bascha and Walz 2007).
123
422
more effort (time) on monitoring and managing the
investment. We DEMO included a measure of a leading
role of VCs for each transaction. Hochberg et al.
(2007) deﬁne the lead investor as the investor DEMO
acquires the largest stake in a portfolio company.
Megginson and Weiss (DEMO) and Sorensen (2007)
use a similar argument. As TVE only reports the total
amount invested per round and does not distinguish
between DEMO sum invested by each VC involved on a
stand-alone basis, we DEMO for the lead investor(s)
using two criteria that have to be fulﬁlled simulta-
neously: the maximum number of rounds and the
involvement in the initial ﬁnancing round. The lead
investor is deﬁned as the DEMO that has participated in
the maximum number of rounds among all investing
VCs and was also involved in the ﬁrst round of
ﬁnancing. This DEMO is identical to that adopted
in Hopp (2008). Underlying this DEMO is the
same argument as in Megginson and Weiss (1991)or
DEMO (2007) that the lead investor usually has the
largest amount of money at stake and therefore an
incentive to take a more active DEMO in managing the
syndicate and advising the portfolio company. A lead
VC is therefore the VC that has participated in the
highest number of DEMO rounds among all
involved VCs. There can be multiple VCs or even
no lead VC at all (in which case the venture drops
from the analysis). Accordingly, the lead VC is
assumed to invite partner VCs to take part in a
speciﬁc transaction. For all transactions with DEMO single
VC involved the lead investor naturally is equal to the
only participating VC. The study for hypothesis 1
and 2 thus analyzes syndication DEMO the side of the
leading VC. For hypothesis 3 information on all
previously involved VCs enter the analysis.
3.3 Independent variables
Given that we DEMO track the investment experience
that VCs accumulated over time and in speciﬁc
industries we can infer how the existing resource
conﬁguration (and the potential erosion) impacts the
decision of which partners to team up with and
whether resource gaps warrant network expansions to
generate reconﬁgurations. The VC attributes DEMO
based on the cumulative cooperation behavior until
the end of the year prior to the given year. The
resulting structure is a cross-section of DEMO
over time, with varying covariates over the years. All
123
C. DEMO
measures are either calculated as the cumulative
number until the end of the year prior to the given
year (in which the deal takes place) or by just using
the relevant information from events happening in the
year prior to the given year (t - 1 analysis). In this
way, issues of causality between the dependent and
independent variables are circumvented; for example,
the total number of transactions that a VC has made
in (or until the end of the year) DEMO is used to
explain his syndication decisions in 2005. Hence,
syndication decisions in 2005 cannot inﬂuence the
independent variables in 2004. We will DEMO
experience and contacts on the basis of the VC ﬁrm
level rather than for speciﬁc funds (of the same VC
ﬁrm) separately. Underlying DEMO assumption is the
argumentation that ties and experience acquired carry
over to a VC’s next fund (Hochberg et al. 2007). The
following explanatory variables are used in the
estimation procedure:
3.3.1 Industry experience (in the previous year)
To measure the effect of industry experience on
DEMO behavior, we calculated the total experi-
ence that the corresponding VC(DEMO) acquired during
the course of the previous year in the given DEMO
in which a deal takes place. We used information
from TVE to identify the industry of a particular
venture and make use of the DEMO Economics
Industry Classiﬁcation (VEIC)—a Venture Economics
proprietary industry classiﬁcation scheme. DEMO order to
draw more distinct conclusions we further split the
industries in the sample, which results in ﬁner
industry clusters. Namely, we divided DEMO medical/
health classiﬁcation into two separate categories.
Moreover, we split DEMO industrial sector into industrial
products (such as chemicals and industrial equip-
DEMO) and industrial services (such as transportation,
logistics, and manufacturing DEMO). We created a
category for Internet ﬁrms to cope with the particu-
larities of investments into ‘‘new economy’’ ﬁrms
over the period.4 Accordingly, industry experience
measures the previous number of transactions that the
corresponding VC DEMO out throughout the

Firms that were solely focusing on the Internet to sell DEMO
market products were included in the separate Internet/
e-commerce category.

previous year. We do not include DEMO industry
dummies as these would be highly correlated with the
experience of VCs in overrepresented industries, such
as biotechnology and software. For the analysis of
syndication patterns, industry experience within the
previous year allows for more variation in the
independent variables and circumvents problems of
autocorrelation. Even for DEMO VCs we see more
variation from year to year and hence can get more
insights into the changing syndication patterns by
using a rolling DEMO of industry experience.
Especially for hypothesis 3, this measure is more
DEMO to test the impact of generation and
dilution of expertise over time and the necessity to
syndicate in subsequent ﬁnancing rounds.
3.3.2 Increase in DEMO experience
Concerning hypothesis 3 we also account for a
possible change in the level of industry experience
among the VCs involved in a previous DEMO We
only measure the additional industry experience that
the incumbent VCs have gained between the last time
ﬁnancing was provided and the given round. DEMO,
we would expect that, if incumbent VCs have only
made DEMO few transactions (or no transaction at all) in
the meantime, DEMO likelihood that they will invite a
new VC for a subsequent round is higher. The change

in industry experience is calculated for all incumbent
VCs that participate in a subsequent DEMO and over
the interval between the current and the preceding
round of ﬁnancing.
Table 1 gives a brief overview of the industry
distribution of DEMO investments during the investiga-
tion period. We can infer that biotechnology and
software are the industries with the highest number of
ﬁrms ﬁnanced. They DEMO top, with 142 and 215
funded ventures, respectively. Additionally, there DEMO
some 100 transactions in electronics, industrial pro-
ducts, and Internet. Concerning the use of syndication,
biotechnology is the industry with more pronounced
DEMO Almost 61% of all ﬁrms funded (regard-
less of the rounds) have more than one investor.
Among the other industries, industrial products and
service exhibit a lower level of syndication, with
slightly below 20% of the ﬁrms being backed by
more than a single investor.
3.3.3 Type DEMO current ﬁnancing round (dummy)
Additionally, TVE gives information about ﬁve
different stage categories: start-up/seed, early stage,
expansion, later stage, and other. Similar to Gompers
(1995) who labels the categories for bridge, second,
and third stage ﬁnancing as ‘‘late-stage’’ ﬁnancing,
we combined the TVE categories of expansion, later
stage, and other to DEMO a new category, which we
also label ‘‘late stage’’. As there DEMO no clear distinction
between expansion ﬁnancing that almost always
occur in later phases and other ﬁnancing activities,
namely bridge ﬁnancing or special-purpose ﬁnancing,DEMO
from the ‘‘later-stage’’ category, this combination
appears to be the most DEMO classiﬁcation
scheme.
3.3.4 Funded ﬁrm age
With respect to hypothesis 1, DEMO that with a
higher risk of investing VCs should rely to a larger
extent on syndication, we gathered data about the
funded ﬁrms founding date and combined that
information with the investment date to arrive at DEMO
age of the funded ﬁrm at the date of each capital
infusion. As pointed out by Bygrave (1987) younger
ﬁrms are more likely DEMO fail and consequently ﬁrm
age at investment can serve as a proxy for the
riskiness of a venture.

3.3.5 Amount of ﬁnancing provided
According to Lockett and Wright (1999) the size of
an investment plays an important role in the decision
to syndicate. When VCs want to avoid clustering of
risks or when DEMO venture under consideration is
simply too large for the corresponding VCs the
chances are higher that a deal will be carried out by a
DEMO These elaborations are supported by the
ﬁndings of Manigart et al. (DEMO) that mitigation of
risk is predominantly important for VCs. In order DEMO
test for the impact of the size of an investment we
include the total amount provided for a given round
(regardless of whether a syndicate or a single
investor provided the ﬁnancing) into the empirical
analysis.
3.4 Control variables
3.4.1 Type of VC investor (dummy)
As shown by Cumming (2006) the heterogeneity of
VCs plays a signiﬁcantly more DEMO role in
providing growth capital to entrepreneurial ﬁrms in
other countries than in the USA. Given the diversity
of VC types in Germany we DEMO control for the
various afﬁliations of lead VCs (see, among others,
Tykvova 2004). We classify the VC as being
independent if DEMO are no links to other ﬁrms or
banks. Secondly, we classify DEMO as bank dependent
when a private bank founded them or a private bank
holds more than 50% of the shares. Thirdly, we
classify a VC as public if the shares are hold by either
the German DEMO or one of the German public
banking associations, i.e., Sparkassen or Landesbanken.
Additionally, we classiﬁed a VC as being a corporate
VC when there were links to a large corporation or
when a larger corporation DEMO the corresponding
VC. Lastly, we include a dummy for cooperative VCs
DEMO one of the German cooperative banks holds more
than 50% of the shares.
Moreover, the German VC market is characterized
by a vast number of foreign investors playing a
signiﬁcant role in providing growth capital (Achleitner
and Klo¨ ckner 2005). The data also allows meaningful
conclusions to DEMO reached on the use of syndication to
access specialized market knowledge for VCs more
unfamiliar with the market and cultural environment

DEMO which they are acting by controlling for the origin
of the corresponding VCs. Hence, we control for the
origin of the various VCs using a dummy variable for
foreign VCs. An investor is recorded as foreign DEMO he
comes from a foreign origin and did not operate from
a German branch.
3.4.2 VC investment focus (dummies)
We included three different investment focus vari-
ables for the VCs to control for experience within DEMO
focus industry, which proxies for more speciﬁc
knowledge acquired. TVE includes DEMO different
investment domains. The respective dummies take on
the value of one if the corresponding VC invests
mainly in high technology, medical/health, DEMO non-
high industries or has no stated investment focus,
respectively, DEMO zero otherwise. A distinction using
percentages is not carried out. We do, however,
include the number of total investments into the given
industry (in which the venture is active) as an
explanatory variable into DEMO analysis to allow for a
more ﬁne-grained analysis.
3.4.3 (Cumulative) capital and funds managed
In order to proxy for experience acquired through the
DEMO of capital over the past years we include
a variable indicating the cumulative capital and
speciﬁc investment funds that the corresponding lead
investor has DEMO until the end of the previous
year. These measures are calculated using VC fund
information from Thomson Venture Economics. Due
to the high correlation DEMO these variables, both
will enter the regressions separately. Both variables
are DEMO as the log.
3.4.4 Previous round syndication (dummy)
In order DEMO rule out any dependencies between the
given and the preceding rounds, DEMO control for the
syndication behavior of VCs during the preceding
round. We would expect that, if the preceding round
has been ﬁnanced by a syndicate, the chances for a
continuing joint effort are higher. Hence, DEMO include
a dummy into our analysis for subsequent ﬁnancing
rounds, controlling DEMO the preceding round was
carried out by a syndicate, regardless of DEMO size.
When do venture capitalists collaborate?
3.4.5 Days between subsequent ﬁnancing rounds
DEMO account for the time between subsequent ﬁnancing
rounds we count the number of days between when the
previous ﬁnancing was provided and the current DEMO
This should control for a possible erosion of industry
knowledge beyond the experience gathered in the
previous year and between successive ﬁnancing rounds.
3.5 DEMO methodology
The empirical part of this paper consists of two
separate analyses looking at syndication patterns
within speciﬁc investment rounds and partner selec-
tion DEMO later rounds that are used to test the impact of
VC (DEMO funded-ﬁrm) characteristics on the propen-
sity to syndicate and into the DEMO with whom to
syndicate. First of all we ﬁt a logistic regression with
the 1/0 decision to syndicate/invest alone. Thereby
we control DEMO year effects using yearly dummy
variables (not tabulated) and also allow for clustering
in the error terms over the VC investors, to cope with
overrepresented VCs in the sample. Secondly, we ﬁt
another set of logit regressions with the 1/0 variable
representing the decision to involve DEMO new VC partner
that has not invested in the previous round.
4 Analysis and results
Table 2 presents the summary statistics for the
variables DEMO in the empirical analysis. Concerning
the stages one can infer that around 12% of the
investments are done in the start-up stage, 25% in
early-stage ﬁrms, and that the main bulk of the
investments were carried out in late-stage invest-
ments. Due to the larger number of syndication DEMO
later stages (Table 3) the summary statistics might be
slightly misleading a ﬁrst glance. Due to double
counting of investments (when more than a single VC
provided ﬁnancing and when more than a single
round DEMO provided) the actual number of ﬁrms
initially ﬁnanced in either stage DEMO around 25% for
both the start-up and the early stage. The remaining
50% of investments were made at later stages.
Apparently, all ventures that run through subsequent
stages are accounted for in the summary statistics as
DEMO as they receive ﬁnancing (depending on the
number of rounds and DEMO involved).
425
With respect to the origin of the VCs one can infer
that around 23% of the capital contributions stem
from a DEMO with a foreign headquarter. Moreover,
independent VCs account for the main body of the
transactions and were involved in more than 60% of
DEMO individual capital contributions. The remainder is
split among banking-dependent VCs (with DEMO) and
public VCs (with 13%). Cooperative and corporate
VCs account for only 1% and 7%, respectively.
Additionally, the main body of DEMO has no speciﬁc
investment focus (around 50%) whereas the other
VCs concentrate on information-technology ventures
(37%) and medical and health products (around
12%). Due to the low number of data points for some
DEMO dummy variables (namely cooperative and corpo-
rate VCs as well as DEMO focusing on non-high-
technology ﬁrms, these dummies had to be dropped
DEMO part of the empirical part when additional
covariates were added). Noticeably, VCs managed on
average ﬁve funds and had an average capital
invested of some 40 million Euros and provided
some 1.8 million Euros in DEMO speciﬁc round on
average. Again, these numbers are in the aggregate
DEMO towards overrepresented, larger VCs in the
dataset. In fact, standard errors in the following
empirical part were adjusted for clustering on the
lead DEMO level to avoid a bias from overrepresented
VCs.
With respect to hypothesis 1, arguing that a higher
risk associated with the investment inﬂuences the
decision to syndicate positively, we ﬁnd in speciﬁ-
cations two to ﬁve (Table 3) that the age of the
funded ﬁrm has a DEMO negative effect (at the
1% and 10% level, respectively) on DEMO to
syndicate. Younger and more risky companies call
for a higher level of syndication. Accordingly, when
the investment is provided to an older ﬁrm, less
partner involvement is required and lead VCs syndi-
cate to a lesser extent. Moreover, we can see that the
amount provided in a given round is positively
associated with the likelihood of syndication (at the
1% level). The more capital that is provided, the more
the lead VC will invite partners to share the capital
burden. The required DEMO amount can have a
negative effect on the size of the overall portfolio and
larger companies require VCs to take a much higher
exposure DEMO acquiring a sizeable equity stake,
leading to a higher incentive to syndicate due to the
intensiﬁed need to spread ﬁnancial risks.

The table reports a logit model estimating the likelihood of lead VCs to involve partners during a speciﬁc round DEMO investment. The
table reports the coefﬁcient estimate in the ﬁrst line along with robust standard errors in the line below for each variable. Intercepts
DEMO not shown. Year dummies have been included in all regressions but are not tabulated. The year dummies 2004 and 2005 are
positive and signiﬁcantly DEMO from the omitted 2000 year dummy in all regression speciﬁcations. The capital and funds managed
enter the regression as the log. The variables ‘‘corporate’’ DEMO ‘‘no focus’’ have been dropped to avoid perfect collinearity. Standard
errors are adjusted for clustering on the VC level. Missing values for coefﬁcients indicate DEMO the corresponding variables have been
omitted from the regression due to the low number of data points available
*, **, *** denotes signiﬁcance DEMO the 10%, 5% or 1% level, respectively
With respect to the industry experience of the lead
VCs, the results show support for hypothesis 2b,
indicating that VCs with more industry experience
syndicate to a DEMO extent. The coefﬁcient associ-
ated with industry experience that lead VCs have
gained during the course of the preceding year is
123
428
positive and signiﬁcant in all ﬁve regressions (sig-
niﬁcance levels vary, however). Hence, industry
experience does not mitigate investment risks faced,DEMO
but rather acts as a certiﬁcation argument for
potential new partners. Only those VCs that possess
industry experience can make use of syndication.
Accordingly, our ﬁndings stress the importance of
enhancing a VC’s network position as DEMO vital strategy
to improve deal ﬂow and access to new knowledge
(DEMO et al. 2006, 2007). Moreover, the results
show that syndicate ﬁnancing seems to be rather
stable over time. If a preceding round DEMO been
ﬁnanced through a syndicate the likelihood that a
future round will be ﬁnanced by a group of VCs is
signiﬁcantly higher. The coefﬁcient DEMO with
the dummy variable indicating whether the previous
round has been subject to syndication is positive and
signiﬁcant (at the 1% level). This indicates that in
general syndication for a given venture is not a DEMO
time event. VCs investing in syndicates tend to build
upon their joint effort and rely on partner efforts in
future rounds.
Concerning the control DEMO, Table 3 reveals
that among the various VC types independent VCs
DEMO signiﬁcantly less (when compared with the
omitted corporate VC dummy). DEMO coefﬁcient
associated with the dummy for independent VCs is
negative and signiﬁcant in four out of ﬁve regression
speciﬁcations (at the 5% level the least). Moreover,
foreign VCs are also more likely to work DEMO
partners when ﬁnancing investments. The coefﬁcient
associated with the foreign VC dummy is highly
signiﬁcant in four out of ﬁve regression speciﬁcations
estimated. This DEMO that due to the nonfamiliar-
ity with the local market foreign VCs face a higher
risk when investing and hence beneﬁt more from
involving DEMO to access new expertise.
With respect to stage of development, Table DEMO
indicates that more syndication occurs in the early-
stage category. The coefﬁcient associated with this
variable is positive and signiﬁcant (when compared
with the omitted late-stage dummy). This indicates
that, when investments are made in earlier stages (and
investors face more risks), syndication is more
pronounced. However, for the start-up dummy this
effect cannot be conﬁrmed with the dataset. The start-
up dummy is not statistically signiﬁcant at conven-
tional DEMO Lockett and Wright (1999, 2001) point
out that the capital DEMO for transactions are
123
C. Hopp
lower in the earliest stages of company development.
Accordingly, a lower capital burden in the start-up
stage might offset the generally more pronounced risk
and lower a VC’s incentive to DEMO Conse-
quently, lead VCs beneﬁt more from inviting partners
in the DEMO stage where ventures are still very risky but
capital burdens become more intense. Thus, individual
capital contributions could become more heavily
clustered into single risky ventures and/or industries.
Hence, the involvement of a partner VC might be a
valid means to limit individual investment exposure.
For hypothesis DEMO we would expect VCs to rely on
previously established ties (partners DEMO present in
the syndicate) when industry experience is sufﬁcient
to make DEMO/abandonment decisions and
provide a higher quality of managerial advice. Hence,
new partners should be invited in later rounds when
leads VCs (and the partners that were invited previ-
ously) do not have enough industry knowledge or
have not gained additional experience over the course
of successive DEMO rounds. From the results in
Table 4 we can infer that the industry experience of
incumbent VCs is negative and signiﬁcant (at the 1%
level), indicating that those syndicates that possess
industry expertise are likely DEMO reinforce their rela-
tionship and do not expand their partner radius. On the
contrary, these results imply that networks are likely
to be expanded when incumbents lack relevant
industry experience. Moreover, the increase in indus-
try experience (measured between two subsequent
ﬁnancing rounds) shows the same negative DEMO and
is also signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Hence, new partners
DEMO a valid alternative if the existing repository of
knowledge and information that different incumbents
can contribute to the management of the funded
venture are DEMO sufﬁcient to add value through better
continuation/abandonment decisions and/or a higher
quality of managerial advice.
Concerning the stage variables, we do not ﬁnd any
evidence that the involvement of new partners differs
between subsequent DEMO of development. None of
the dummy variables is signiﬁcant at conventional
levels. VC characteristics seem to be the main driving
force of partner selection DEMO here, and charac-
teristics of the underlying transaction do not
signiﬁcantly DEMO the likelihood of inviting a new
partner to join a subsequent ﬁnancing round. How-
ever, when a previous round has been subject to
syndication this signiﬁcantly reduces the chances of a

The table reports a logit model estimating the likelihood of lead VCs inviting new partners during a speciﬁc round of investment. DEMO

new partner joining; the coefﬁcient is negative and
highly signiﬁcant. Accordingly, DEMO VCs gen-
erally aim at providing money in subsequent rounds
within the existing syndicate structure and only aim
at new partners/knowledge when the DEMO repos-
itory does not sufﬁce to provide an edge, as indicated
DEMO the industry experience variables. Moreover, the
amount provided positively inﬂuences the DEMO to
invite a new VC. The variable is highly signiﬁcant.
Again, DEMO higher the capital contributions become,
the more likely a concentration of capital towards
speciﬁc investments and industries becomes. For this
123
430
reason, the incentives for incumbent VCs to share the
capital burden with new investors increase. Among
the different groups of VCs, independent VCs tend to
invite new partners to a lesser extent (when compared
with the omitted cooperative dummy variable). This
coefﬁcient is negative and highly DEMO in all
regression speciﬁcations. Concerning the focus vari-
ables, none of DEMO coefﬁcients is signiﬁcant at
conventional levels. None of the VCs focusing on
certain industries seems to differ in their partner
selection behavior. Lastly, the coefﬁcient associated
with the age variable is negative and signiﬁcant in
three DEMO ﬁve regressions, but becomes insigniﬁcant
when we control for other variables DEMO the
development of the ﬁrm. Hence, there is weak
evidence that DEMO ﬁrm risk (as measured by the
age variable) negatively affects the need to invite new
partners.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we shed DEMO on the syndication behavior
of VCs in Germany. Using a sample of 2,373 unique
capital contributions from 437 VCs over subsequent
rounds into DEMO start-ups during the period 1995–2005
in Germany we hypothesize investment behavior and
test the potential consequences against the actual
empirical outcome of the data DEMO We provide
evidence that, for funded ﬁrms where products are
far DEMO commercialization, the risks that investors
face are more severe and scrutiny DEMO deal selection
through syndication and subsequent managerial
advice can be an important mechanism to align
managerial effort with the goals of the ﬁnancing VCs.
DEMO, VCs beneﬁt from combining their investment
expertise when risks are more DEMO
We believe that situating the necessity to engage in
interﬁrm relationships and the partnering choices of
VCs in the dynamic environmental context by
focusing DEMO partnering decisions over time and
rounds yields a better understanding of the impor-
tance of industry knowledge for the involvement of
partners and especially DEMO expansion of syndication
networks to new partners. Industry experience in
general is associated with more syndication. While
we cannot distinguish between deal-ﬂow reciproca-
tion DEMO management resources directly, the proxies
illustrate the overall tendency of more DEMO
123
C. Hopp
VCs to enter to a larger extent into syndicate
relationships. This provides evidence for networking
motives and the legitimacy of more DEMO VCs
with respect to syndicate formation. More experi-
enced lead VCs can capitalize on their previously
acquired expertise and further expand their network
through DEMO In line with the results of
Hochberg et al. (2006, 2007) we ﬁnd that syndication
appears to be a vital strategy to enhance one’s
network position.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that syndication in subsequent
rounds serves as a means to combine industry
experience to better select ventures and/DEMO offer a
higher quality of managerial advice. Hence, one can
see DEMO VCs tend to team up with new partners if the
current network might not provide the necessary
repository of skills and investment knowledge that
DEMO be needed to successfully ﬁnance and guide
new ventures. By tracking the VC networks over time
and industries, we open up the black box of network
expansion strategies and show how a quest for partner
resources DEMO explain the dynamic patterns in VC
collaboration by paying attention to the combination,
generation, and dilution of investment experience.
Syndication networks will only be broadened if
potential new partners can offer additional value
beyond the DEMO composition of incumbent syndi-
cate members.
Our results provide initial evidence that different
forms of relationships matter for venture ﬁnancing.
Nevertheless, we need to gain further insights into the
formation and closure of networks within the DEMO
industry in order to gauge new perspectives on how
and why ﬁrms syndicate. It might be interesting to
investigate further with whom VCs syndicate DEMO in
which sense later-stage syndication involves more
reputable partners in order to cushion potential
transaction costs owed to more intense monitoring
among the parties. DEMO timing of partner involvement
in certain stages and the reputation and the rank
within the VC network could therefore yield more
valuable insights into DEMO mechanics of VC syndica-

ties and the impact of reciprocity and expected deal
ﬂow would present an interesting avenue for future
research.
As the decision of whom to DEMO to participate in
VC transactions lies at the heart of understanding
why syndication might add value to the funded ﬁrm it
When do venture capitalists collaborate?

partners VCs tend to team up with and under which
circumstances these relationships are established.
