Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Abstract
Although the organizational literature is increasingly DEMO on common definitions and
theoretical conceptualizations of trust, it is unclear DEMO the same is true for the measures
used to operationalize trust.  DEMO this paper, we review the organizational literature to assess the
degree DEMO sophistication and convergence across studies in how trust has been measured. Our
analysis of 131 papers published over the past 45 years revealed that DEMO state of the art of trust
measurement is rudimentary and highly fragmented. In particular, we identified a total of 102
unique measures of trust.  Moreover, in only 19 instances were we able to verify that DEMO
previously developed and validated measure of trust had been replicated verbatim, DEMO 10 of
these replications were by the same authors who originated the measure. In the vast majority of
cases, researchers are either developing anew a measure of trust or materially altering an
existing measure.  In addition to the limited degree of replication, the measurement of trust in the
organizational literature is characterized by weak evidence in support of construct validity DEMO
limited consensus on operational dimensions. What makes these findings even more surprising
is that our review also identified several measures of trust that have DEMO carefully developed
and thoroughly validated.  We profile those measures with strong DEMO properties,
summarize how they were developed, and report the results DEMO construct validity analyses.  We
also present a framework for measuring trust DEMO provides guidance to researchers for selecting
or developing a measure of trust and proposes an agenda for future research with an emphasis
on resolving DEMO debates in the literature.

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
THE NEED FOR A REVIEW
Research on DEMO role of trust in an organizational context has expanded considerably in
recent years.  Apart from the increasing number of journal articles, there have DEMO been several
special issues1 and books2 devoted to the topic of trust in and between organizations.  While this
literature has made important theoretical and conceptual advances, the literature as a whole is not
well integrated and lacks coherence (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer 2003).  In part, this may be
due to the fact that most research tends to DEMO trust into existing theories of organizations,
resulting in a diverse and eclectic mix of findings.  However, we believe this is also due DEMO a
fragmentation in the literature in the way that trust is measured.
Although the organizational literature is converging on common definitions and
theoretical conceptualizations DEMO trust, it is unclear whether the same is true for the DEMO
used to operationalize trust.  From a conceptual standpoint, organizational research is
increasingly adopting the view that “Trust is a psychological state comprising the DEMO to
accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviors of another”
(Rousseau et al., 1998: 395). As others have noted (Colquitt et al. 2007; Ferrin et al.
forthcoming), the DEMO stresses two key elements – the willingness to be vulnerable and the
expectation of favorable treatment by another party – as well as their DEMO (willingness is
based on expectation). The organizational literature on trust DEMO cites this definition
(over 360 times according to the Web of DEMO) along with the closely related
conceptualization upon which it is based DEMO Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995) (over 700
times according DEMO the Web of Science). However, from an empirical standpoint it DEMO unclear if a

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
widely accepted and used measurement instrument for DEMO has emerged.  Anecdotally, it
appears to be the case that different researchers use different measurement instruments to meet
the idiosyncratic purposes of a DEMO study.  More accurately, however, we simply do not
have a DEMO sense of how much consistency there is in approaches to measuring trust since there
has yet to be a systematic review of the organizational DEMO
Earlier reviews of trust measures by Stack (1978) and Wrightsman (DEMO) provide
thorough and careful evaluations of instruments designed for research in DEMO psychology.
Given these reviews one might question the need for a review of trust measures specific to the
organizational literature.  There are two important reasons, however, that we believe that such a
review is critical.  First, the earlier reviews in social psychology are somewhat dated. At a
minimum it would be useful to bring these reviews up-to-date by determining DEMO extent to which
the trust measures reviewed by Stack (1978) and Wrightsman (1991) have been adopted in
organizational research and if researchers DEMO developed other more recent scales of
comparable quality.  As noted previously, the organizational literature on trust has expanded
considerably in recent years and DEMO of this growth may include important advances in
measurement.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, it is not clear how relevant and useful
trust measures from social psychology are for organizational research.  Consider, for example,DEMO
the following survey items from Rempel, Holmes and Zanna (1985), included in Wrightsman‟s
(1991) review:

Though times may change and the future is uncertain, I have faith that my partner
will always be ready and willing to offer me strength, come what may.
It is sometimes difficult for me to be absolutely certain that my partner will always

My partner has proven to be a faithful person.  No matter who my partner was

chance of being caught.
If I have never faced a particular issue with my partner before I occasionally worry
DEMO he or she won‟t take my feelings into account.
I occasionally find myself feeling uncomfortable with the emotional investment I
have made in our DEMO because I find it hard to completely set aside my
doubts about what lies ahead.
Would it be reasonable to use survey items such DEMO these to measure trust in an
organizational context?  The emphasis on reliability in the first two items would certainly seem
to be appropriate DEMO a number of organizational scenarios (e.g., a supervisor who is
contemplating delegating a task to a subordinate or group members that depend on DEMO other).
The focus in the next two items on faith, DEMO, and caring may be relevant to some
organizational settings (e.g., DEMO in leaders), but perhaps fewer than the first two items.  DEMO,
the emphasis on infidelity and emotional investment in the last three items is likely to be
applicable to even fewer organizational situations.  Would it be useful for gauging trust in, for
instance, a study DEMO buyer-supplier relationships to ask purchasing managers and supplier
representatives about their levels of emotional investment in their relationship?
Regardless of how one responds DEMO this question, in general it seems reasonable to
conclude that some DEMO are more readily transferred to an organizational setting than others.

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Given that the items above are from DEMO instrument developed to measure trust in close, intimate
(e.g., marital) relationship, this should come as little surprise.  It does, however, DEMO the
question of whether trust scales developed for one specific type of relationship can be
meaningfully applied to other kinds of relationships.  One option, of course, is to simply modify
or eliminate those items that DEMO most suspect from an organizational perspective.  Doing so, of
course, DEMO concerns about whether the modified scale is still measuring the trust construct and
its dimensions as it was originally conceptualized.  A second option is to simply develop a
measure of trust that is designed with the DEMO organizational context of a study in mind.  The
rationale for doing DEMO is based on the idea that trust is inherently context-dependent (Hardin
DEMO; Rousseau et al. 1998).  Yet, taken to the extreme, such an approach would result in a
completely unique measure of trust DEMO each study, thereby making it exceedingly difficult to
compare and integrate DEMO across studies in a way that leads to a cumulative body of
knowledge. Without a systematic review of organizational research on trust there is DEMO way to
know how consolidated or fragmented the literature is, the DEMO to which organizational
research is using or building on existing instruments versus devising entirely new and different
scales, and what the overall quality is of the measures being used.  To the best of our knowledge
there has yet to be a detailed review of the state of the DEMO in measuring trust in organizational
research, which is the purpose of DEMO paper.3
We envision three primary outcomes from this review.  First, we will provide an
assessment of the current state of trust measurement in DEMO research.  This assessment
will document the degree of fragmentation and convergence DEMO studies in the use of trust
3 Recent papers by Dietz and Den Hartog (2006) and by Seppänen, Blomqvist and Sundqvist (2007) also provide
insightful reviews and evaluations of trust measurement, but concentrate on a more focused segments of the
literature than our review.  Whereas Dietz and Den Hartog (2006) review 14 studies on trust in the DEMO

scales (e.g., most commonly used scales, proportion of scales adapted from existing instruments,
proportion of scales newly DEMO).  Second, we will profile those instruments with strong
measurement properties, summarize how they were developed, and report the results of whatever
DEMO validity analyses were performed on them. The third outcome from the review will be
a set of guidelines for measuring trust going forward. Taken DEMO, we believe that the results
will prove valuable to future research DEMO trust and facilitate the development of a cumulative
body of knowledge.
REVIEW OF ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH ON TRUST
Scope of the Review
This review focuses DEMO organizational research using psychometric techniques to measure
trust. The psychometric approach to measurement typically takes the form of a multi-item
survey that includes a DEMO of questions intended to capture different theoretical dimensions of
trust.  For DEMO, people may be asked the extent to which they trust a DEMO other, how
much confidence they have in a group of people, or whether a partner organization fulfills its
obligations.  The psychometric approach is particularly well-suited to operationalizing
conceptualizations of trust similar to the one presented DEMO that emphasize the psychological
foundation of trust, specifically the expectations and DEMO stemming from vulnerability
(Rousseau et al., 1998). The widespread use of psychometric measures of trust by organizational
researchers is another reason we DEMO our review to studies using this approach.
Focusing on psychometric measures of trust and adopting Rousseau et al.‟s (1998)
definition of trust necessarily excludes several types of measures from our review.  Specifically,
organizational context, Seppänen, Blomqvist and Sundqvist (2007) limit their focus to 15 DEMO on trust in the
6
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
our review focuses on studies that measure DEMO extent to which one party places trust in another
individual or collectivity (e.g., group or organization), consistent with the relational nature of
DEMO  Therefore, we do not consider dispositional instruments (see for example DEMO 1967;
Costa & McRae 1992; Yamagishi 1986) that are designed to measure differences in individuals‟
propensity to trust society at large or DEMO in general, and treat trust as a relatively stable
individual trait. DEMO also adopt the view that trust is a psychological state and is inherently an
individual level phenomenon.  Thus, while it is meaningful to DEMO collective entities (i.e.,
groups or organizations) as the object of trust, the same is not true for the source of trust (DEMO,
McEvily, & Perrone 1998).4 For this reason we primarily DEMO on studies measuring trust at the
individual level.  Our emphasis on DEMO instruments also excludes behavioral measures.
For instance, we do not include DEMO in experimental economics using the investment/trust
game (Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe 1995).5 Also beyond the scope of this review are measures of
distrust, which has been argued to be conceptually distinct from trust (Lewicki, McAllister, &
Bies 1998; Sitkin & Roth 1993; DEMO 1996; Cook et al., 2004).  Lastly, because we adopt the
perspective that trust is a multifaceted concept (Corazzini 1977) we DEMO not include in our review
network-based measures (Burt & Knez 1995; Ferrin, Dirks & Shah 2006), which tend to treat
trust as a unidimensional construct.  By excluding dispositional, collective, behavioral, and
network-based DEMO measures we do not mean to suggest that these other forms of trust are
irrelevant for organizational research.  On the contrary, we believe DEMO each represents an
important and fruitful approach to studying trust.  At DEMO same time, however, we believe that
inter-organizational context.
4 For a thoughtful argument that presents an alternative viewpoint and a framework for studying DEMO across levels
of aggregation see recent work by Currall and Inkpen (DEMO, 2002, 2006).  Closely related is work by Janowicz and
DEMO (2006) that develops a framework for conceptualizing and measuring trust across levels that takes
into account different organizational roles and responsibilities.

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
each measurement approach raises a different set DEMO evaluation issues that would substantially
complicate our task and we leave it for future research to expand this review to provide a
comprehensive discussion DEMO measuring trust in organizational research.
Review of Psychometric Trust Measures
Our review of the organizational literature on trust proceeded as follows.  We began our
search by referencing two recent reviews of the organizational trust literature.  Dirks and Ferrin
(2001) identified 46 papers published over the past 40 DEMO that studied interpersonal trust as an
antecedent to various organizational outcomes.  DEMO the criteria for inclusion in their review,
trust had to be defined as a psychological state.  To compile their review the authors searched
electronic databases (PsycINFO, ABI Inform, Social Science Abstracts), referenced prior
reviews, conducted a manual review from 1980 to 2001 in leading organizational journals
(Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Applied
Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Organization
Science), DEMO reviewed the reference sections of articles identified in prior steps.  Dirks DEMO
Ferrin (2002) conducted a second review, specifically focused on trust DEMO leaders.  Once again
trust had to be defined as a psychological DEMO for inclusion in their review and the same search
process was used.  The second review identified 94 studies of trust, some of which DEMO
with the earlier review.  After eliminating those studies that were not DEMO in a peer
reviewed journal (e.g., working papers, conference papers, doctoral dissertations, edited
volumes) we were left with 61 studies of DEMO
Since the Dirks and Ferrin reviews were focused on outcomes of interpersonal trust and
trust in leaders, they may have omitted some studies of trust in organizational contexts (e.g.,
8
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
studies focusing on the antecedents of trust DEMO on trust placed in a group or organization).  For
this DEMO, we supplemented the Dirks and Ferrin reviews with our own searches DEMO identify
other studies of trust.  Using the Pro-quest Direct and Web DEMO Science databases we did a
comprehensive search of the organizational literature on trust to identify other empirical papers.
We then did a manual search DEMO journals excluded from the Dirks and Ferrin reviews that had
published studies of trust in an organizational context – including Journal of Economic Behavior
DEMO Organization, Journal of Marketing, Management Science, and Strategic Management
Journal DEMO and we updated Dirks and Ferrin‟s reviews searching for studies published after 2001
in Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of DEMO
Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Organization
Science.  DEMO, we circulated our preliminary bibliography of trust studies to colleagues
familiar DEMO the trust literature to see if we had overlooked any published articles.  Our review
identified an additional 70 studies of trust.  The combined DEMO of our search and those of Dirks
and Ferrin yielded a total of 131 published empirical papers measuring trust in organizational
contexts.  Studies included in our review are listed in the Appendix.  It is important to note that
several of the papers report more than one measure of DEMO (e.g., buyer and supplier, different
experiments, etc.), which we treat as separate.  Therefore, the total number of measures included
in DEMO review is 156.
We reviewed each of the studies we identified and summarized key information about the
way trust was measured.  Specifically, our DEMO recorded the following details: (1) the
definition of trust presented, (2) whether the trust measure was adapted from a previously
published DEMO or was a newly developed instrument, (3) the number of DEMO in the
measure, (4) the type of response scale used DEMO evaluate the items, (5) the construct validity
9
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
statistics reported, (6) the different dimensions of trust measured, (7) the sample size, (8) the
DEMO population, (9) the source of trust, and (10) the object of trust.  Based on this information
we were able to discover a number of discernible patterns in the way that organizational
researchers have DEMO trust and to identify several instruments with strong measurement
properties.
SUMMARY OBSERVATIONS
Degree of Replication
The first thing that we observed from the review DEMO that there is a tremendous
proliferation of measurement instruments in the literature. We identified a total of 102 unique
measures of trust in the DEMO papers we reviewed.  More specifically, more than half of the
measures we reviewed (60 of 102), were newly developed instruments rather than replications of
a previously developed and validated instrument (see Figure 1).  Less than half of the measures
we reviewed (42 of 102) were based on an existing instrument.  Even among these, however,
DEMO is considerable heterogeneity in the frequency of replication.  Of the existing DEMO
that were replicated, the majority of cases (26 of 42) DEMO instances of a single replication
(i.e., a previously published measure appeared in exactly one other study). We found a much
smaller set DEMO existing instruments that had been replicated more than once.  In total, of the 102
unique measures we found that only 16 had been DEMO more than once (see Table 1).  Taken
together, these DEMO different measures appear in less than 42% (55 out of 131) of the papers we
reviewed, suggesting little replication.

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
A more detailed analysis of how accurately DEMO have been replicated reveals that
the actual degree of replication is in fact, much lower. In particular, we examined how
accurately studies replicated DEMO instruments by conducting, whenever possible, an item by
item comparison between the original and the replicated measure. Since several of the papers
included DEMO measures of trust, we identified a total of 96 instances where DEMO of the 42
existing instruments was replicated.  Table 2 below lists DEMO 42 existing instruments replicated
along with an analysis of the accuracy of replication.
We coded a replication as verbatim if an item by item DEMO revealed that:
-
the exact same number of items and exact same wording were used,
-
-
or the exact same number DEMO items were used and wording changes were limited to
modifying the description of the trustor or trustee (e.g., “we” instead of “I”, or “other
party” instead of “business units”),
or the exact same wording was used and a single item was removed based on the
results DEMO construct validity analyses.
We coded a replication as not verbatim if an item by item comparison revealed that:
-
the wording of the DEMO items was materially altered
-
-
and/or more than one item was removed from the original measure
and/or one or more items DEMO added to the original measure.6
When a study did not report enough information to make a definite determination of the
accuracy of replication (e.g., no items reported or sample items reported) we coded it as
DEMO information.
6 We used one item as a criterion for categorizing a replication as verbatim because it provided a clear point of
differentiation among DEMO replicated measures.  Of the adapted measures modifying the number of items DEMO an
existing instrument, a small number added or removed one item DEMO the vast majority added or removed four or
more items.

The most DEMO finding of this analysis is that there is very little „true‟ replication in the
literature.  In only 19 instances (20% of the 96 DEMO) were we able to confirm that an existing
instrument had been DEMO verbatim.  Moreover, this is probably a fairly generous estimate
of the degree of replication given that half (10 out of 19) of DEMO verbatim replications were by the
authors that first published the existing instrument.  Equally striking is the fact that in more than
half of the cases (49 out of 96) we noted that the changes in DEMO wording and/or number of the
items were substantial enough to question whether the existing instrument had been replicated at
all.  Indeed, we DEMO struck by how different from the original source many of the “not
verbatim” replications were.  Typical of these cases were measures that adopted fewer than half
13
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
of the original items, measures that combined items from two or more existing instruments, and
measures that added several new items to items from one ore more existing instruments.
It is DEMO interesting to note that of the paper‟s adopting an existing instrument, DEMO one
in three (28 out of 96) did not provide enough information to assess the accuracy of replication.
Even in the unlikely case DEMO all 28 of these cases were verbatim replications, that would still
DEMO that less than half (47 out of 96) of those studies adopting an existing instrument were
„true‟ replications.7 Taken together, these observations suggest that there appears to be very little
accuracy in the way that DEMO of trust are replicated in the organizational literature.  Figure 2
below DEMO the breakdown of the existing instruments replicated in terms of type of
replication using the same categories reported in Table 2.
7 A more DEMO estimate of the number of cases not reporting sufficient information that were potentially
verbatim replications is based on the ratio of verbatim (19) DEMO not verbatim (49) cases, or 39%.  If we apply this
estimate to the 28 cases of insufficient information, it would suggest that nearly 11 are verbatim replications
bringing the total to 30, or just 31%.

Construct Validity
DEMO review also revealed that most studies report minimal information about construct
validity.  For instance, for 13 of the measures we reviewed we found DEMO statistics reported about
the psychometric properties of the instrument.  Most of DEMO remainder of the measures we
reviewed (80) were accompanied by internal consistency/reliability statistics (typically
Cronbach‟s Alpha), but no additional construct validity information.  Only 63 of the measures
reviewed included both internal consistency/reliability statistics and the results of analyses for
construct validity.  These analyses most often took the form of exploratory or confirmatory
factor analyses, although a few (11) also reported the results of convergent or discriminant
analyses.  The level of detail provided about construct validity varied widely from no
DEMO
Frequency
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
information, to detailed information about loadings, DEMO, and fit indices.  Taken
together, these observations suggest that the DEMO of confidence that can be inferred about the
validity of trust measures used in the organizational literature is highly uneven.  For most of the
studies we reviewed, the information reported is insufficient for evaluating how accurately trust
has been measured.
Dimensionality
A closely related concern regards the dimensionality DEMO trust.  As noted previously, trust
is considered a multifaceted construct.  DEMO its complexity, it would seem appropriate to
operationalize trust as a DEMO construct and empirically assess the extent to which
distinct dimensions exist, DEMO the nature and degree of their relationship to each other.  The DEMO
majority of measures we reviewed, 79% (124 out of 156) DEMO treat trust as a
unidimensional construct.  To the extent that trust DEMO in fact multi-dimensional, it is unclear
which dimension(s) are being represented by a unidimensional construct.  It may also be the case
that inconsistent findings across studies are a result of differences in the dimensions DEMO trust
being captured by a unidimensional construct.  Some of the measures DEMO reviewed do, however,
treat trust as a multifaceted construct (see Figure 3).

In particular, we noted DEMO 21% (32 of 156) of the measures we reviewed are

no DEMO than four dimensions.  Three studies operationalized a 12-dimensional measure
developed by DEMO (1991).  More so than the number of dimensions, we DEMO a considerable
degree of variation across the multidimensional measures in terms of the types of dimensions
operationalized.  Specifically, we counted a total of DEMO different dimensions of trust across the 32
multidimensional measures identified (see DEMO 3).

We should DEMO that we did not group or consolidate dimensions that may be similar, except in
unambiguous cases (e.g., promise fulfillment and keeping commitments, DEMO and
competence).  Hence, our compilation may overstate the number of trust dimensions
18
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
operationalized in the literature.  However, we DEMO that any overestimation is slight.
Consider Table 3 and whether there is a reliable means of condensing the dimensions listed.
Setting aside the issue DEMO the precise number of dimensions operationalized, we believe it is
worth DEMO the heterogeneity in how these dimensions are labeled and described.  At DEMO
minimum, it appears as though there is little consensus in the DEMO about how to describe the
different dimensions of trust.  More broadly, it appears as though the organizational literature has
yet to embrace the DEMO that trust is multifaceted, not only in terms of conceptualization,
DEMO also in terms of empirical evaluation.
Taken together, the lack of DEMO, the weak evidence in support of construct validity,
and the DEMO consensus on operational dimensions suggest that the state of the art of trust
measurement in the organizational literature is still rudimentary and is growing DEMO
fragmented.  The disjointed state of trust measurement may be due in DEMO to the context-specific
nature of trust, as noted earlier, and due to the fact that trust is increasingly being studied by
organizational researchers DEMO a wide variety of fields that are not well-integrated.  It may DEMO be
the case that “necessity is the mother of invention” and that organizational researchers have
devised idiosyncratic measures of trust due to the lack DEMO availability of carefully designed and
validated instruments.  Our review of the DEMO, however, leads us to conclude that such is
not the case and in the next section we focus on five noteworthy measures of DEMO that were
developed and tested with a great deal of rigor and care.
NOTEWORTHY MEASURES OF TRUST
Given that there may be other well-developed DEMO validated trust measures that we are
unaware of we do not mean to suggest that the following are the only high quality instruments
19
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
available.  Rather, we hope that by DEMO attention to these five measures that future research
will make better use of the more advanced measures of trust that we identified from our DEMO
We selected measures to profile based on several criteria. First, we DEMO on studies for
which the primary, if not the sole, objective was the development and validation of a measure of
trust, in contrast to studies that were primarily concerned with testing theoretical predications
pertaining to DEMO antecedents or consequences of trust.  In addition, all five measures adopted a
multi-dimensional conceptualization and operationalization of trust, consistent with view that
trust is a multi-faceted concept (Corazzini 1977; Mayer et al., 1995; DEMO et al., 1998).
Most importantly, each of the five measures reviewed below undertook extensive analyses to
assess the construct validity of the DEMO instrument.  In particular, the five measures share a
common emphasis on confirmatory factor analysis involving the testing of a theoretically derived
measurement model DEMO the estimation and evaluation of competing measurement models
(Anderson and Gerbing DEMO; Bagozzi, Yi and Phillips 1991). The five instruments we profile
are listed in chronological order in Table 4 below.

It is worth noting that only three of these five measures – McAllister (1995), Cummings
& Bromiley (1995), and Mayer & Davis (1999) – are also included in the list of measures most
replicated (see Table 1).  Moreover, as Table 2 shows, the accuracy with which these three
measures are replicated is quite low, similar to the other replicated measures, suggesting that
20
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
even these measures are not being used DEMO in the literature. Although the degree and
accuracy of replication are factors we could have used as selection criteria, we decided that
replication per se was not necessarily a clear indication of the quality of a DEMO  For instance,
several of the measures included in the list DEMO those most replicated (Table 1) only report basic
statistics about their psychometric properties (e.g., reliability) without providing details about the
procedures used to develop the instruments (e.g., item generation and purification) or the
construct validity properties (e.g., discriminant, convergent, nomological) of the measures. The
measures we summarize below, in one form or another, all DEMO such details.
Managerial Interpersonal Trust
McAllister (1995)
Construct
This instrument DEMO designed to measure a focal manager‟s trust in a specific peer.
Interpersonal trust is defined as “the extent to which a person is confident DEMO, and willing to act
on the basis of, the words, DEMO, and decisions of another” (McAllister 1995: 25). This
definition DEMO both the willingness and positive expectation elements of trust identified
in the Rousseau et al. (1998) definition presented at the outset of this DEMO Two principal
dimensions of interpersonal trust are conceptualized.  Cognition-based trust emphasizes DEMO
knowledge and evidence upon which a rational decision is made to make leaps of faith.
Competence, responsibility, reliability, and dependability are among the criterion used to judge
the trustworthiness of another.  Affect-based trust consists of the emotional bonds between
individuals and relate to expressions of care and DEMO for the welfare of another. Cognition-
based and affect-based trust are conceptualized as related but distinct dimensions of interpersonal
trust.
21
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Items
The author drew on available measures DEMO the social psychology literature (Cook & Wall
1980, Johnson-George & Swap 1982, Rempel et al. 1985, and Rotter 1971) and adapted them for
the organizational context.  The resulting initial pool of 48 items were then evaluated by 11
organizational behavior researchers to determine if they tap DEMO trust, affect-based
trust, both forms of trust, or neither.  Based on an analysis of the expert evaluations, the author
then selected 10 items each for the two dimensions of trust.  The number of items was further
reduced based on exploratory factor analysis of data collected from DEMO MBA and
undergraduate business students to the 11 best items: six DEMO the cognitive dimension and five for
the affective dimension.  The final DEMO of items is listed below:
22

Cognition-based Trust
1. DEMO person approaches his/her job with professionalism and dedication.
2. Given this person‟s track record, I see no reason to doubt his/her competence
and preparation for the job.
3. I can rely on this person DEMO to make my job more difficult by careless work.
4. Most people, even those who aren‟t close friends of this individual, trust and
DEMO him/her at work.
5. Other work associates of mine who must interact with this individual consider
him/her to be trustworthy.
6. If DEMO knew more about this individual and his/her background, they would
DEMO more concerned and monitor his/her performance more closely.*
Affect-based Trust
1. We have a sharing relationship.  We can both freely share our ideas, feelings,
and hopes.
2. I can talk freely to this individual about difficulties I am having at work and
know that (s)he will want to listen.
3. We would both feel a sense of DEMO if one of us was transferred and we could
no longer work together.
4. If I shared my problems with this person, I know (s)he would respond
constructively and caringly
5. I would have to say that we have both made considerable emotional
investments in our working DEMO

Sample
Data to evaluate the measurement instrument were gathered from a sample of 194
managers enrolled in an executive MBA program.  Each manager nominated two peers with
whom they worked to participate in DEMO study.  Managers were instructed to generate one list of
three to DEMO people with whom they “worked the best” and a second list of three to five people
with whom the manager “worked less well” and DEMO select one peer from each, making sure that
the peers interact DEMO each other at work. Nominated peers were not enrolled in the MBA
program. Of the 197 peers nominated, 80 (41%) agreed to participate.  Overall, respondents
were comparable to the broader population of executive MBA DEMO and alumni in terms of
23
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
age, education, and organizational experience.  The manager and two peers nominated formed a
triad from which survey data DEMO collected.  Within each triad the author randomly assigned the
manager and DEMO peer to report on the trustworthiness of a counterpart in one relationship and to
report on behaviors (described below) towards a counterpart in DEMO second relationship.  This
method allowed the author to make efficient use DEMO the respondents while maintaining
independence of observations.  The data collection resulted DEMO a total of 175 complete manager-
peer dyads.
Reliability
The author estimated the internal consistency of each dimension of trust using
Cronbach‟s alpha.  The reliability for cognition-based trust was .91 and the reliability for affect-
based DEMO was .89.
Validity
The author assessed convergent validity by conducting confirmatory factor analysis of
the two trust measures along with four behavioral response measures (affiliative citizenship
behavior, assistance-oriented citizenship behavior, need-based monitoring, and monitoring and
defensiveness) using structural equation modeling.  Overall, the model fit the data well
(comparative fit index = .90).  Factor loadings for cognition-based DEMO ranged from .69 - .90 and
for affect-based trust from .66 - .89, with all loadings statistically significant (p < .05).
Structural DEMO modeling was also used to assess the discriminant validity of the trust
measures.  The analysis followed guidelines developed by Anderson & Gerbing (1988) and
Bagozzi & Yi (1988) that involves estimating a series of DEMO measurement models, each
with a single phi coefficient estimating the relationship DEMO dimensions constrained to unity,
and comparing the chi-square fit of those models to an unconstrained model. The results showed
24
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
that cognition-based trust could not be empirically DEMO from monitoring and
defensiveness.  As a result, the author excluded the monitoring and defensiveness measure from
further analyses.
The author then assessed nomological DEMO by testing a structural equation model of
the antecedents and behavioral consequences of managerial interpersonal trust.  The results of
this analysis showed that cognition-based and affect-based trust are strongly correlated at .63 (p
< .001), providing further support for the convergent validity of the instrument.  At the same
time, these analyses also support the distinction between the two dimensions of trust.
Specifically, there were considerable differences in the pattern of relationships observed between
the two forms of trust and the other variables in DEMO Whereas the results supported the
predicted relationships for the antecedents and behavioral consequences of affect-based trust,
none of these relationships were supported for DEMO trust.
Comments
There are several strengths of this measurement instrument.  The DEMO used a rigorous
and theoretically-driven process to generate and purify items.  DEMO from different samples were
used for exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.  DEMO subjects reported on trust in real, on-
going work relationships.  The research design included relationships that varied in their
strength.  And, the DEMO included assessments of convergent, discriminant, and nomological
validity.
Given that the measurement instrument was designed for peer relationships among
managers, its applicability to relationships that vary in terms of authority and power is unknown.
Dirks DEMO this measure verbatim in two studies (1999, 2000) and found DEMO both cases that
trust was best represented by a single factor that combined the cognition-based and affect-based
25
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
dimensions.  The observation of a single dimension also raises a question regarding the extent to
which the measure reflects DEMO willingness or positive expectation element of the trust definition.
The wording of some items in this instrument also raises a question about the ability DEMO
respondents to accurately report on behalf of a counterpart in a relationship (e.g., “We have a
sharing relationship”) or on behalf of others‟ view of the counterpart (e.g., “Most people … trust
and respect DEMO/her”). The conditions under which respondents are able to make such
assessments accurately are unknown.
Boundary Role Persons Trust
Currall & Judge 1995
DEMO
This measure was designed to capture trust between individuals working across
organizational boundaries, what the authors refer to as boundary role persons. More specifically,
the instrument is a measure of interpersonal trust: the trust that a focal boundary role person has
for a particular target boundary role DEMO with whom s/he has a relationship.  The measure is
unique DEMO that it focuses on the willingness to engage in trusting behaviors, DEMO the authors
argue is a more proximate antecedent of trust than measures that rely on a focal person‟s
perception of a counterpart‟s characteristics (i.e., a counterpart‟s trustworthiness).  Therefore, the
authors define trust as “an individual’s behavioral reliance on another person under a condition
of risk” (Currall & Judge 1995: 153), which is primarily oriented toward capturing the
willingness aspect of the Rousseau et al. (1998) definition of trust, without also reflecting the
positive expectation element.  A multidimensional measure is developed in order to allow for the
possibility that trusting behaviors are manifest DEMO across individuals.  Based on a review
of the interorganizational and boundary-spanning DEMO the authors identified four
26
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
dimensions of trusting behavior: communicating openly and honestly, relying on informal
agreements (instead of formal safeguards such as DEMO), maintaining surveillance (indicating
lack of trust), and coordinating interdependent DEMO
Items
The authors used a two-stage process to develop survey items.  DEMO the first stage, the
authors interviewed and surveyed a group of DEMO school district superintendents and presidents.
The interviews were open-ended asking respondents to give examples of behaviors manifesting
trust in their counterpart.  After completing a preliminary survey, the authors then conducted
group interviews, using the four DEMO derived dimensions of trust to prompt respondents
to provide items reflecting specific trusting behaviors. Respondents generated a total of 26 items
across the four DEMO  In the second stage of developing items the authors asked two DEMO
groups of superintendents and presidents (the size of these groups was DEMO reported) to indicate
the extent to which each behavior described by DEMO item reflected trust in their counterpart.  This
resulted in a final DEMO of 20 items; five items for each of the four dimensions. DEMO for
superintendents and presidents were identical, except for the task coordination DEMO, which
the authors argued varies by organizational context.  The complete set of items is reported below:

Sample
The authors gathered data on the relationship between school DEMO superintendents and
presidents of local teachers‟ unions.  The sample consisted of DEMO matched dyads that include
survey responses from both the superintendent and president in a given relationship.  Response
rates were 61% for superintendents and 51% for presidents.  The authors were able to determine
that there were no differences between superintendent respondents and nonrespondents in terms
28
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
of gender, but were otherwise unable to evaluate the representativeness of superintendents and
had no data for assessing the DEMO of presidents.
Reliability
Using Cronbach‟s alpha, the authors estimated the internal DEMO of each dimension
of trust for both superintendents and presidents.  The DEMO for communication were .72 in
the superintendent sample and .71 in the president sample, for informal agreement were .73 and
.68, for surveillance DEMO .79 and .82, and for task coordination were .70 and .74, respectively.
Validity
The authors assessed convergent validity with confirmatory factor analysis.  Using
structural equation modeling the authors first estimated separate measurement models for the
DEMO and president samples.  Each model corresponded to the four factor trust DEMO
proposed.  The authors characterized the fit of the superintendent model to DEMO data as “adequate
(albeit not exemplary)” (p. 160), with fit indices ranging from .70 - .91. The fit indices for the
DEMO model were also slightly sub-par ranging from.68 - .88. Factor loadings for the
superintended model averaged .59 and were all statistically significant (p < .001), but varied
from a low of .19 to a high DEMO .85. The president model revealed similar factor loadings with an
average of .60 (p < .001), and a range from .41 to .83. Additional evidence in support of the
convergent validity of the instrument is DEMO by the correlations among trust dimensions
(e.g., communication with reliance, DEMO with surveillance, etc.).  For the
superintendent sample the estimated coefficients were in the predicted direction and ranged from
.14 - .74 (p < .05).  For the presidents the estimates were also in the prediction direction and
varied less ranging from .44 - .66 (p < .01).
29
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
To assess discriminant validity the authors estimate DEMO series of competing measurement
models. First, for each of the two DEMO the authors compared the fit of a four factor trust
model to the fit of a single factor model.  In the case of both the superintendent and president
samples the fit of the four factor model DEMO found to be superior.  The authors also estimated a
third model DEMO each sub-sample that combined the two dimensions that were most strongly
related.  Again, the four factor model for both the superintendent and president DEMO
demonstrated superior fit.  As a second test of discriminant validity, the authors estimated a
model that related a set of four predictor variables (attitudes toward trusting counterpart,
perceived norms, past trustworthiness of counterpart, DEMO disposition to trust others) to the four
trust factors.  For each of the two sub-samples the authors compared the fit of a model DEMO the
correlations between individual-level predictor variables and trust dimensions estimated to the fit
of a model with the correlations fixed equal to one.  If the fit of the two models is no different it
suggests that DEMO predictor variables relate similarly with all four dimensions of trust.  Contrary
DEMO this and consistent with the multidimensional view of trust proposed, the DEMO found the fit
of the constrained models to be substantially worse for both the superintendent and president
sub-samples.  The authors then constrained the relationships between the predictor variables and
each dimensions of trust, one dimension at a time, and similarly found the fit of the constrained
models to be significantly worse in all cases.  As a final test of discriminant validity, the authors
performed a similar analysis, this time with dyad-level DEMO (e.g., average of
superintendent‟s and president‟s attitude toward trusting, etc.)DEMO  For all models except one
(anticipated future longevity of relationship) DEMO fit of the constrained models were significantly
worse, further supporting the DEMO validity of their trust measure.
30
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
To evaluate the generalizability of the four DEMO trust model the authors performed a
multi-sample test with structural equation modeling.  The model specified four trust factors each
for superintendents and presidents along with a common parameter between the two samples.  If
constraining the common parameter to equal one yields an inferior fit, this suggests that the
factor loadings are significantly different across samples.  Of the 14 loadings expected to be
equivalent, the authors found that 10 actually were.  The DEMO also observed that the
correlations between the surveillance and informal agreements dimensions and the surveillance
and task coordination dimensions differed across samples.
The authors DEMO assessed the nomological validity by estimating one structural equation
model that included separate trust factors and individual-level predictors for superintendents and
presidents and a DEMO structural equation model that combined superintendent and president
data to form dyad-level trust factors and predictors.  The individual-level model provided broad
support for the predictions with 10 of 16 hypothesized relationships supported.  The president‟s
attitude toward trusting the superintendent was not related to communication, informal
agreement, and DEMO and neither the superintendent‟s nor the president‟s view of
perceived norms were related to informal agreement, surveillance, or task coordination.  Past
trustworthiness and disposition to trust showed the strongest results with all but one correlation
(superintendent‟s disposition to trust and informal agreement) to the four dimensions of
superintendent‟s and president‟s trust being significant.
Comments
This measurement instrument has a DEMO of virtues.  The authors developed and
refined items in a way DEMO was both theoretically-grounded and practically relevant to the
research context. The multiple dimensions allow for the measurement of aspects of trust that are
31
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
both common across and specific to the DEMO context. The use of two sets of subjects
during the piloting of the instrument and a separate set of subjects during the testing and
DEMO is another strength.  And, all subjects were drawn from, and DEMO on, actual
interorganizational working relationships.  The validation process was quite comprehensive
covering convergent, discriminant, generalizability, and nomological validity.  Further, the
inclusion of data from both parties to a relationship allowed the authors to DEMO additional
analyses of construct validity.
A unique feature of this measurement instrument is the deliberate emphasis on the
willingness to engage in trusting behavior.  Apart from providing a proximal indicator of trust,
the focus on DEMO provides an approach to measuring trust that is potentially „scalable‟ with
regard to more aggregate levels of analysis.  As the authors have argued elsewhere (Currall and
Inkpen 2002) trust as an action is much more DEMO to measurement at multiple levels of
analysis.  At the same time, this approach raises an important question about the consistency of
trust conceptualized DEMO an action and as an expectation, consistent with the definition of DEMO as a
psychological state (Rousseau et al. 1998).  A somewhat related issue is the inclusion of
surveillance as a (negative) dimension DEMO trust and whether it is actually tapping into distrust,
which as noted earlier has been argued to be distinct from trust (Lewicki, DEMO, & Bies
1998; Sitkin & Roth 1993; Kramer 1996). DEMO review of the literature did not identify any
studies that have replicated this instrument.
Organizational Trust Inventory
Cummings & Bromiley (1996)
Construct
32
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
This instrument was designed to measure trust DEMO the level of collective entities.  In
particular, the authors focus on “the degree of trust between units of an organization or between
organizations” (p. 302).  At the same time, the authors view trust DEMO having its basis in
individuals.  Specifically, trust is conceptualized as “an individual‟s belief or a common belief
among a group of individuals that DEMO individual or group (a) makes good-faith efforts to
behave in accordance with any commitments both explicit or implicit, (b) is honest in whatever
negotiations preceded such commitments, and (c) does not take excessive advantage of another
even when the opportunity is available” (p. 303).  The three dimensions of trust – good-faith
effort, honesty in exchange, and limited opportunism – define beliefs about negotiating behavior
and execution of DEMO agreements.  The definition is primarily oriented toward capturing
the positive expectation DEMO of the Rousseau et al. (1998) definition of trust, without DEMO
reflecting the willingness element. The authors explicitly conceptualize organizational trust in a
way that is directly contrary to the assumptions of Williamson‟s (1975) DEMO cost
economics.  The authors also view trust as a belief as DEMO manifested as an affective state, as a
cognition, and as an intended behavior.  Combined the three dimensions of trust and the three
components of belief result in a 3 x 3 definitional matrix of trust DEMO the  organizational trust
inventory contains survey items tapping each of the DEMO cells of the matrix.
Items
The authors developed an entirely new set of measurement items using an extensive
process.  First, the authors instructed DEMO group of five doctoral students to generate items
following a specific protocol.  The items could not include the word trust.  An equal number DEMO
items should be developed for each dimension.  Questions should reflect the DEMO (e.g., we
feel …), cognitive (e.g., we think …), and intended behavior (e.g., we will …) components.
33
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Items should be as simple as possible.  And, items were to be phrased at the group or unit level
(i.e., using the pronouns “we” and “they”).  The doctoral students generated an initial list of 273
items, which was reduced to 121 items after the group reviewed the items for face validity to
ensure DEMO they all understood the items similarly.  Next, a second set of three doctoral students,
who had no prior involvement with the first DEMO or knowledge of work in the area,
independently sorted the items into separate categories based on the definition of each
dimension.  Fifteen items from a previously validated measure of organizational commitment
(Mowday, Steers, & Porter 1979) were included with the trust items in order to determine if the
trust items could be distinguished from items for a related DEMO  Of the 136 items (121 trust
+ 15 organizational commitment), all three sorters placed 116 (85%) items into the same
categories DEMO for the remaining 20 items (15%) two of the three sorters agreed, suggesting a
high degree of initial reliability and discriminant validity.  DEMO order to create a survey instrument
that could be administered on a large scale the number of items was reduced to 62 by eliminating
DEMO with similar wording while retaining an equal distribution of items across dimensions and
belief components. Since even this reduced set of items may be DEMO long for many uses the
authors also developed a “short form” version of the measurement instrument that consists of 12
items.  To develop the short form the authors retained those items with the highest item-to-factor
correlations, which resulted in the elimination of the intended behavior items.  The final set of
items for the short form is listed below:

Reliability
In addition to the item sorting performed during the item generating and refinement
process, the authors also estimated the reliability of the both the long form and short form trust

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
instrument with structural equation modeling.  For the long form, a measurement model
estimated with structural equation modeling was specified that assigned each item to its
appropriate dimension.  The associated composite reliabilities obtained were .95 for good-faith
effort, .95 for honesty in exchange, DEMO .96 for limited opportunism in the long form and .94, .94,DEMO
and .90 respectively on the short form.
Validity
The authors assess convergent validity by means of confirmatory factor analysis using the
same measurement model DEMO above.  For the long form, the model had “adequate” fit with
a comparative fit index of .81, all items were significantly associated with their relevant factors
(p < .05 to p < .001), but the loadings varied considerably from .12 to .92 (all but 11 loadings are
above .60).  For the short form, the fit of DEMO model was substantially better at .98, the items
again were significantly DEMO to their relevant factors (p < .001) and loadings ranging from .64
to .87.  Further evidence of the convergent validity is provided by the high correlations among
factors ranging from .80 to .93 for the DEMO form and .76 to .92 for the short form. Additional
analyses of convergent validity of the long form were conducted that examined the three
DEMO of trust for each component of belief (affective, cognitive, and DEMO intent)
separately.  Results of these analyses showed that affect and DEMO belief components provide
very similar factors, while the behavioral intent component DEMO to be less reliable.
As a check of nomological validity the authors use structural equation modeling to
examine the relationship between the three dimensions DEMO trust and a composite factor of group
behavior.  Overall, the trust dimensions were strongly related to behavior with correlations of .80
for good-faith DEMO, .84 for honesty in exchange, and .86 for limited opportunism in the long
form and .67, .72, and .74, respectively, for DEMO short form.
36
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Comments
A principal strength of the organizational DEMO inventory is the careful and rigorous
process used for developing and refining its measurement items.  In addition, the strong
theoretical foundation of the DEMO dimensions in the transaction cost literature make the
instrument particularly useful for studying the role of trust in relationships involving negotiation
and exchange (e.g., interorganizational relations).  At the same time, whether the measurement
instrument can be readily adapted to other organizational contexts remains an open question.  A
novel feature of the organizational trust inventory is the fact that DEMO not only conceptualized
distinct dimensions of trust, but also identified different DEMO that trust belief components can be
manifested.  The resulting 3 x DEMO definitional matrix provides a sophisticated means of capturing
the complexity of trust.
The array of dimensions and belief components does, however, raise some DEMO
about the distinctions among the measure‟s various facets, which are all DEMO related.  An
assessment of the measure‟s discriminant analysis, by estimating and comparing nested structural
equation models for instance, would provide some insight into this question.  In addition,
discriminant analysis that considered all of the organizational trust measures in the context of a
broader theoretical model would DEMO for examination of whether and how the different
dimensions and belief components of trust are linked to theoretically related constructs, thereby
broadening the evaluation of nomological validity. Further, since the measure was explicitly
designed to capture the expectation aspect of trust raises a question about the extent to DEMO it
also reflects the willingness element stressed by Rousseau et al. (DEMO). Finally, the wording of
the items in this instrument also DEMO a question about the ability of respondents to accurately
report on behalf of other members of his or her group or unit.  The conditions under which
37
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
respondents are able to make such assessments DEMO are not well known and potentially
limit the use of the instrument to certain organizational contexts.  Naquin and Paulson (2003)
replicated the DEMO Trust Inventory verbatim and report “acceptable” reliability (i.e.,
Chronbach‟s alpha DEMO .70), but provide no additional information about construct validity.
Organizational Trust
Mayer & Davis (1999)
Construct
This measurement instrument was designed to operationalize the integrative model of
organizational trust proposed by Mayer, Davis & Schoorman (1995).  The development and
validation of the instrument was DEMO reported in an unpublished working paper by
Schoorman, Mayer & Davis (1996).  Since this paper did not report the measurement items and
remains unpublished, and since a subsequent paper by Mayer & Davis (DEMO) does present the
measurement items along with additional validity analyses, we summarize both papers here.
The integrative model of organizational trust defines trust DEMO “the willingness of a party to
be vulnerable to the actions of another party” (Schoorman et al., 1996: 10; Mayer & Davis DEMO:
124). Thus, the willingness aspect of trust is featured DEMO the expectation element identified in
the Rousseau et al. (1998) definition.  At the same time, this conceptualization differentiates trust
from its antecedents DEMO the propensity to trust others in general (i.e., dispositional trust) DEMO the
perception that another party is trustworthy, which may reflect in DEMO the expectation element.
The conceptualization also distinguished trust from its outcomes, DEMO actions whereby the
trustee takes risks in the relationship with a trustor.  Hence, the integrative model of
organizational trust identifies dispositional trust, trustworthiness, trust, and risk-taking in the
relationship as related, but distinct concepts.
38
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
The model further specifies that trustworthiness of DEMO counterpart is assessed along three
dimensions.  Ability is the first dimension DEMO represents the skills, competencies and other
characteristics that allow a counterpart DEMO have influence in some domain.  The second dimension
is benevolence, defined as the belief that a counterpart wants to do good to the DEMO, not
solely from an egocentric profit motive.  Integrity is the third dimension and reflects the belief
that the counterpart adheres to a set DEMO principles that the trustor finds acceptable.
The instrument was designed to be relevant to a variety of organizational relationships.
Schoorman et al., (1996) use the measure to study managers‟ trust in subordinates and Mayer &
Davis (1999) use the instrument to study employees‟ trust in top DEMO
Items
The process through which the items were generated for the trustworthiness dimensions
is not described in either study.  Schoorman et al., (1996) pilot tested a preliminary
trustworthiness measure (number of items not reported) with independent samples of 50
veterinary doctors and 35 executive MBAs.  Based on these samples, the initial instrument was
refined and resulted in a total of 35 items: 10 for ability, 12 for benevolence, and 13 for integrity.
These authors also adopted eight items from Rotter‟s (1967) dispositional trust measure.  For
trust, Schoorman et al., (1996) DEMO four items.  To generate items to measure risk-taking in
relationship the DEMO used two sets of focus groups.  In the first set of DEMO focus groups, six
veterinary doctors were instructed to generate a list DEMO tasks to be delegated and rate the level of
risk involved in assigning the task to a subordinate.  The tasks were then arrayed along a five
point scale ranking from low to high.  A second set of focus groups then independently
replicated scales, and arrived at a similar set of behavioral points.  As noted previously, the
actual items generated DEMO not reported by Schoorman et al., (1996).  The study DEMO Mayer &
39

Davis (1999), however, does implement DEMO shortened versions of the instruments, which are

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Sample
Schoorman et al., (1996) gathered data from veterinary doctors working at 109 clinics via
a mailed survey.  A total of 259 responses were received, representing 45% (109) of the clinics
surveyed.  The authors provided no information to indicate the representativeness of the sample.
Mayer and Davis (1999) used onsite surveys to DEMO data from production employees at a small
nonunion manufacturing firm in the plastics industry.  The authors collected three waves of data
over a 14 month period.  A total of 166, 170, and 193 employees were surveyed across the three
waves representing 68%, 75%, and 82% of DEMO full-time employees, respectively.  In between the
second and third waves of surveys the firm implemented a new appraisal system, creating a
naturally occurring quasi-experiment that the authors use to test a theoretical model of trust DEMO
management.  The authors treat the data gathered during the first wave DEMO a pre-test to rule out
selection-maturation effects.
Reliability
Schoorman et al., (1996) estimated the internal consistency of the organizational trust
measures using Cronbach‟s Alpha.  The reliabilities for the dimensions of trustworthiness were
.93 for ability, .95 for benevolence and .96 for integrity, while the reliability for DEMO
trust was .71 and that of trust was .82.  Given that DEMO in relationship is measured with a
single item (comprised of tasks DEMO in risk), reliability is not relevant.
Mayer and Davis (1999) also report Cronbach‟s Alpha reliability statistics calculated for
their trust measures in DEMO second and third waves of data collection.  The reliabilities for the
DEMO dimensions were .85 and .88 for ability, .87 and .89 for DEMO and .82 and
.88 for integrity, for waves two and three, respectively.  Reliabilities for dispositional trust were
41
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
.55 and .66 and for trust .59 DEMO .60 during waves two and three, respectively.  Since these
authors collected data in panels, they were able to also evaluate the test-retest reliability of their
trust measure, which was .75 between waves one and two (a 5-month lag) and .66 between
waves two and three (a 9-month lag).
Validity
Schoorman et al., (1996) assessed convergent validity by conducting confirmatory factor
analysis of the three dimensions of trustworthiness using DEMO equation modeling.  While
the details of factor loadings were not reported, overall the model fit the data well with a
confirmatory fit index DEMO .90.  In addition, the strong positive correlations among factors ranging
from .65 - .85 also provided evidence in support of convergent validity (although not described
as such by the authors).  Mayer and Davis (DEMO) perform the same analysis, but also include
trust as an additional factor.  Once again details of factor loading were not provided, but DEMO
the data fit the model very well with a confirmatory fit index of .96 in wave 2 and .94 in wave 3.
The correlations DEMO trustworthiness factors were again very high, ranging from .64 - .69 DEMO
wave two and from .73 - .78 in wave three.
To assess discriminant validity Schoorman et al., (1996) estimated a series of competing
structural equation models.  The authors compared the fit of a three factor model, corresponding
to the three dimensions of trustworthiness, to that of DEMO one factor model with all items loaded
onto a single factor.  DEMO results showed that the fit of the three factor model was superior.  An
analysis of a two factor model, with the benevolence and DEMO dimensions combined, also
showed that the three factor model was superior.  Mayer and Davis (1999) performed a similar
analysis, comparing a four factor model (three dimension of trustworthiness and trust) to a single
DEMO model, and found that the four factor model provided a better DEMO to the data.
42
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Little evidence regarding the nomological validity of DEMO organizational trust measures is
provided in Schoorman et al. (1996).  The authors do report the results of a regression of trust on
DEMO three trustworthiness dimensions and disposition to trust, which are all highly DEMO and
collectively explain 73% of the variance, but no other predictor DEMO are included as controls
and the potential for multicollinearity among the predictors is not addressed.  Schoorman et al.,
(1996) also regressed risk-taking in relationship on trust and trustworthiness, but do not report
specific results except that the addition of trust to the model added significantly to DEMO variance
explained.  A more in-depth analysis of nomological validity is provided DEMO Mayer and Davis
(1999) where the authors estimated a structural equation model of the effect of change in
performance appraisal system on trust, mediated by the three trustworthiness dimensions using
wave three data.  By comparing the fit of a model that specified both direct and indirect (through
trustworthiness) effects of the performance appraisal system on trust to a model with only
indirect effects, the authors were able to show that trustworthiness mediated the relationship
between performance appraisal and trust.  The authors do not indicate if the strong correlations
among trustworthiness dimensions are controlled for in DEMO model and it is unclear how sensitive
the results are to this alternative specification.  Although not discussed by the authors, the
structural equation DEMO provides additional insight into the discriminant validity of the
trustworthiness dimensions.  DEMO, the pattern of relationships between performance
appraisal and trustworthiness differed across DEMO three dimensions.  Whereas both performance
appraisal factors were related to benevolence, only one was related to integrity, and neither was
related to ability, suggesting that the three dimensions are distinct.
Comments

Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
A strength of the organizational trust measures DEMO that they can be applied to a wide
variety of organizational relationships.  At the same time, the measure for risk-taking in
relationship provides DEMO means of incorporating context-specific aspects of trust.  Moreover, the
risk-taking measure was carefully developed with two sets of pilot groups.  The trustworthiness
and trust items, however, do not appear to have been developed with DEMO same sort of detailed
process.  In addition, given that only 1 of the 17 items for trustworthiness is negatively worded,
there is DEMO potential for some response-mode bias.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the
DEMO trust measures is that they are directly linked to Mayer, Davis DEMO Schoorman‟s
(1995) theoretical model of trust.  Another strength of this DEMO of measures is that they are
fairly comprehensive in their inclusion of dispositional trust, trustworthiness, trust, and risk-
taking in relationship.  The DEMO also incorporate both the expectation (i.e., trustworthiness
and trust) and DEMO (risk-taking in relationship) aspects of trust.
This constellation of measures does, however, raise some questions about the distinctions
among the various factors, particularly trustworthiness and trust.  Additional discriminant
analysis that compared a model where the relationship between trustworthiness and trust is
estimated with a model constraining DEMO relationship to equality would provide some insight to
this question.  In DEMO, discriminant analysis that considered all of the organizational trust
measures in DEMO context of a broader theoretical model would allow for examination of
differences in the pattern of relationships between the organizational trust measures and other
DEMO related constructs.  Mayer and Gavin (2005) replicated the Organizational Trust
DEMO (trustworthiness and trust) verbatim and report Chronbach‟s alpha reliabilities
ranging from .85 to .92 for the trustworthiness dimensions and .72 and .81 (for two different
respondents respectively) for trust.  The results of confirmatory factor DEMO also supported the
44
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
validity of the measurement model including three DEMO of trustworthiness and trust. A
final issue that has yet to be addressed by research is the extent to which the Mayer & Davis
(1999) family of measures capture not only the willingness, but also DEMO expectation, element of
trust emphasized in the Rousseau et al. (1998) definition.
Behavioral Trust Inventory
Gillespie (2003)
Construct
This instrument was DEMO to provide a measure of trust in working relationships that
is applicable across multiple domains of organizational activity.  Consistent with the
organizational literature, DEMO author adopts the widely cited definition of trust as “a psychological
state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the
DEMO or behaviors of another” (Rousseau et al., 1998: 395). DEMO, the definition explicitly
incorporates both the willingness and expectation elements emphasized DEMO Rousseau et al.
(1998). A unique feature of this instrument DEMO its explicit focus on measuring the willingness to
be vulnerable to the actions of another party, as evidenced by behaviors which would objectively
open the trustor to being harmed if trust was violated.  The author points out that despite the
general agreement in the organizational literature on the DEMO features of trust, few studies
actually operationalize trust as the willingness DEMO be vulnerable by engaging in trusting
behaviors.  In contrast, she argues, studies often measure perceptions of trustworthiness, which is
a more distal DEMO less accurate indicator of trust.  She goes on to observe that DEMO instruments
that do seek to directly measure trust are limited to specific contexts (Currall & Judge 1995,
Cummings & Bromiley 1996) or DEMO not adequately developed the dimensionality of the
willingness to be vulnerable (DEMO & Davis 1999).
45
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
After reviewing the organizational literature, the author concluded that behavioral
expressions of trust were largely captured by Zand‟s (1972) model of trust which emphasizes
two dimensions.  Reliance represents one domain DEMO trusting behavior wherein an individual
depends on “another‟s skills, knowledge, judgments or actions, including delegating and giving
autonomy” (Gillespie 2003: 10).  Disclosure is a second domain of trusting behavior that
involves “sharing work-related or personal information of a sensitive nature” (Gillespie 2003:
10). The author also conducted a qualitative investigation involving 96 interviews with members
DEMO a public R&D organization to determine the appropriateness of the two domains of trusting
behavior.  Team leaders and two of their members were asked to identify trusting and distrusting
behaviors, and interview transcripts were examined to extract trusting behaviors.  The author
observed that the behaviors identified fell into two categories corresponding to reliance and
disclosure.
Items
The interview transcripts DEMO also used, along with existing instruments, to generate an
initial pool of 50 items tapping reliance and disclosure behaviors.  A pilot test of the preliminary
item pool was conducted with 15 individuals working in project DEMO in different organizations
and industries.  Respondents were asked to respond to DEMO items and report whether engaging in
each behavior reflected trust and whether any items were confusing.  A total of 11 items were
deemed difficult to understand or not indicative of trust and were eliminated.  The remaining 39
items were pilot tested a second time with a sample of DEMO R&D team members who were asked
to respond to the items with regard to the project leader, a team member they trusted the most,
and a team member they trusted the least.  Subjects were also asked to report if they had the
opportunity to engage in DEMO behavior with each target of trust, and if so if they DEMO had
46
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
engaged in the behavior.  Based on the responses the author eliminated those items that failed to
distinguish between high DEMO low trust relationships and those tapping uncommon trusting
behaviors, resulting in DEMO reduced set of 15 items. After validity analyses a final set of 10 items
were retained, which are listed below:

Sample
Data to evaluate the measurement instrument were collected from R&D project members
at two DEMO of a large public R&D organization.  Project leaders completed questionnaires
DEMO reference to two randomly selected team members.  Team members responded to DEMO survey
with regard to the project leader and a randomly selected team member.  A total of 311
completed questionnaires were obtained; 77 from DEMO (89% response rate) and 234 from team
members (59% response DEMO), creating 88 matched leader-member dyads and 39 matched peer
47
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
dyads.  An examination of demographic characteristics of respondents and non-respondents
revealed no significant differences.
Reliability
The author estimated the DEMO consistency of each dimension of trusting behaviors
using Cronbach‟s Alpha.  The DEMO in the team members rating leaders sample were .92
for reliance and .95 for disclosure, in the leaders rating team members were .90 and .89
respectively, and in the team members rating peers were .92 and .93 respectively.
Validity
To assess the convergent validity of the measures, the author began by conducting an
exploratory factor analysis using Principal Components extraction DEMO Promax rotation.  The
analysis was performed on team members rating their DEMO, team members rating peers,
leaders rating team members, and then on the combined sample.  Across the four analyses two
factors were consistently extracted, corresponding to the reliance and disclosure dimensions.  In
the full DEMO, loadings ranged from .66 to .99 for reliance and from .72 DEMO .97 for disclosure
and the two factors together account for 69% of the variance.  Next, a confirmatory factor
analysis was performed using structural DEMO modeling in order to compare the fit of
competing models.  Specifically, a null model (assuming no relationship among items), a single-
factor model, and a two factor model (assigning items to the appropriate DEMO). The results of
these analyses showed that the two factor model provided a significantly better fit to than the
alternative models, with a confirmatory fit index of .96.  In addition, all items loaded onto DEMO
hypothesized factors, were greater than .72, and were significant at the p < .01 level. Another
indication of the convergent validity of the DEMO is the high correlations between the two
trusting behaviors; .71 in DEMO team members rating leaders sample, .61 in the leaders rating team
DEMO
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
members sample and .65 in the team DEMO rating peers sample, all significant at the p < .01
level. DEMO addition, regression models of satisfaction with leader and leader effectiveness were
DEMO with trustworthiness and the trusting behaviors as predictors.  In both models, the
addition of trusting behaviors resulted in a statistically significant, albeit modest (change in R-
squared = .09 and .07, respectively) increase in the variance explained.
Next, the author assessed the discriminant validity of the measures of trusting behaviors
using three sets of competing structural equation models.  First, five different version of a model
including reliance, disclosure, trustworthiness and distrust were estimated and showed in all
cases that specifying a DEMO factor model with reliance and disclosure as separate factors yielded
a superior fitting model than combining the trusting behaviors (separately and together) with
DEMO or disclosure.  These analyses were conducted on the member rating leader DEMO
leader rating member sub-samples.  Second, in an analysis of peer relationships, disclosure was
found to be moderately reciprocated, whereas reliance was not.  In the same analysis of leader-
member dyads, both reliance and disclosure were reciprocated. Third, in leader-member
relationships, reliance was found to be DEMO strongly related to trustworthiness, overall trust, and
satisfaction with performance than disclosure.  In peer relationships, there were no differences in
the correlations DEMO the two dimensions with these factors.  Moreover, for leaders rating members
reliance had a stronger relationships with trust in the team and effectiveness DEMO the relationship
than did disclosure.  Taken together, these analyses support the assertion that reliance and
disclosure are distinct dimensions of trusting behaviors.
To DEMO the nomological validity of the instruments the author used correlation analysis
that related the two measures of trusting behaviors to a theoretical model of DEMO antecedents and
outcomes of organizational trust including: perception of trustworthiness, distrust, strength of the
49
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
relationship, common values, satisfaction with performance, effectiveness of the relationship,
trust in the team, and disposition to trust.  Across the three sub-samples 44 of a possible 49
relationships with reliance were significant, and 45 of a possible 49 relationships with disclosure
were significant. A second dyad-level analysis was performed that included measures of DEMO
behaviors from one dyad member and related factors from a second dyad member.  Of a possible
18 relationships, 12 were significant with reliance, and 11 with disclosure. Overall, these results
show that the measures of trusting behaviors operate in ways that are consistent with theory.
Finally, a cross-validation study was conducted with a separate sample of 67 leaders and
DEMO of their direct reports in a large public transport company and an energy firm.  Once again,
exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis supported the convergent validity of the two
factors.  Moreover, reliance and disclosure were DEMO related to strength of relationship,
frequency of interaction, social interaction, duration of relationship, and extra effort.  Regression
models of satisfaction with DEMO leader and leader effectiveness also showed a significant increase
in the variance explained with the addition of the trusting behavior measures (change in R-
squared = .07 and .13 respectively).
Comments
Overall, the behavioral trust inventory was developed and validated with an impressive
level of care and DEMO  The dimensions and items were carefully generated based on theory and
DEMO interviews and an extensive array of validity analyses were performed using data from
several different samples. One limitation of the process used to develop DEMO is that it did not
produce any negatively worded items, raising DEMO possibility of response-mode bias.  In addition,
while the assessment of DEMO validity did examine the measures in the context of an
integrative model of organizational trust, many of these analyses are based on bivariate
50
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
correlations and the multivariate models estimated include DEMO one other predictor variable
besides the trusting behavior measures.  These points DEMO, the author marshals a considerable
volume of evidence in support of DEMO construct validity of the proposed instruments. Moreover,
the author makes a compelling case for adopting a direct approach to evaluating trust based on
DEMO willingness to be vulnerable by taking trusting behaviors. The advantages of doing so are
that such a measure is generalizable to a wide variety DEMO organizational settings, is a highly
proximal indicator of actual trust, and is potentially transferable to more aggregate levels of
analysis (see similar comments in the discussion of the Currall and Judge (1995) measure). DEMO
the same time, the exclusive emphasis on the willingness aspect of DEMO necessarily omits the
expectation element highlighted in the Rousseau et al. (DEMO) definition.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Given the care and rigor with DEMO the five trust measures profiled above were
developed, it would truly DEMO a waste not to capitalize on these efforts.  Moreover, in light of the
limited overlap and convergence in the measurement of trust thus DEMO in the organizational
literature, it would seem doubly important to adopt DEMO, reliable, and valid instruments in
the future to generate a cumulative body of work and facilitate comparisons across studies.  It is
our hope that this review will make these important goals more feasible by drawing DEMO to
the need for such consistency and to the availability of high-quality measures.
At the same time, we recognize that researchers may question which of the five measures
profiled is best for their particular study. We DEMO suggest that the choice is contingent upon
the specific research question addressed and theoretical model proposed. In particular, it is
important to be clear about which form of trust is the focus of a theory.  Trust has been theorized
51
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
to operate as: an expectation or belief about another party8, which is perceptual or attitudinal; a
willingness to DEMO oneself vulnerable, which is intentional or volitional; and a risk-taking act,
which is behavioral (Mayer et al., 1995; McKnight et al., 1998). These three constituent
components of trust have been referred to as perceived trustworthiness, the decision to trust, and
trusting behaviors, respectively (McEvily et al., 2003; Dietz & Den Hartog, 2006). DEMO our view,
the five measures profiled tap into different components of trust as summarized in Table 5
below.  Therefore, depending on the DEMO of trust featured in a theoretical model, the set
of measures DEMO are most appropriate for a particular study will vary.

8 Although we treat expectations about another party and beliefs about DEMO as synonymous, Ferrin et al.
(forthcoming) suggest that they may DEMO conceptually distinct since positive confident expectations (McAllister 1995)
refers to DEMO about how someone will behave, rather than a person‟s internal character. DEMO et al. (2007),
however, concluded that some operationalizations of DEMO are more similar to perceived trustworthiness than
a distinct construct.  Given DEMO lack of additional evidence, we believe this is an important area DEMO future research.
52
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
For theories focusing on perceived trustworthiness, or the individual characteristics upon
which a subjective evaluation of a trustee‟s motives DEMO intentions is made, the measures
developed by McAllister (1995), Cummings and Bromiley (1996), and Mayer and Davis (1999)
are DEMO relevant options. Each of these three measures emphasizes different characteristics of the
trustee. McAllister‟s (1995) measure primarily emphasizes beliefs about competence and
responsibility (i.e., cognition-based trust), as well expectations about the extent to which the
counterpart expresses care and concern for the welfare of the trustor (i.e., affect-based trust).
Cummings and Bromiley‟s (1996) measure, on DEMO other hand, focuses on beliefs about whether
the trustee makes good-faith DEMO, is honest, and refrains from opportunism. And, the Mayer
and DEMO (1999) measure captures perceptions about a trustee‟s ability, benevolence, and
integrity.  Although there is some overlap between the measures by McAllister (DEMO) and
Mayer and Davis (1999) (i.e., competence/responsibility with DEMO, and care and concern with
benevolence), the three measures are DEMO distinct.
Whereas some theories stress the trustee‟s characteristics, others focus on DEMO trustor‟s
decision to trust.  Here, trust is treated as a heuristic (Uzzi 1997), or a frame of reference, that
simplifies the DEMO and interpretation of information used to make decisions about the
willingness to assume vulnerability. Given that this component of trust is at the heart DEMO Mayer
et al.‟s (1995) Integrative Model of Organizational Trust, and DEMO Mayer and Davis (1999)
developed the Organizational Trust Instrument specifically DEMO operationalize that theoretical
model, their measure is clearly a relevant option. DEMO would also suggest that the measures
developed by Currall and Judge (DEMO) and Gillespie (2003) are suitable for measuring the
decision to DEMO Although these authors are ultimately interested in behaviors that reflect trust,
53
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
they developed their measures to capture the DEMO to engage in trusting behavior, since it
is considered “the most DEMO antecedent of trusting behavior” (Currall and Judge 1995 152).
Indeed, the fact that the instruments respectively prompt respondents to report “…what you
DEMO actually do…” (Currall and Judge 1995, emphasis ours) and “how DEMO are you to
[undertake specified actions] (Gillespie 2003, emphasis ours) DEMO reinforces our belief that
these measures are more indicative of the decision to trust than trusting behaviors per se.  A key
benefit of adopting these instruments to measure the decision to trust is that they are
DEMO, which is particularly important if decisions regarding the willingness to be
DEMO can be manifest in different ways.
Although we believe the Currall and Judge (1995) and Gillespie (2003) measures are
best-suited to capturing DEMO decision to trust, they may also be suitable for capturing trusting
DEMO  For instance, by changing the item prompts from “would” to “have” the focus shifts
from intentional and hypothetical, to actual and past, DEMO  At the same time, this raises an
important question about how best to measure behaviors.  One the one hand, a drawback of DEMO
survey-based instruments to measure past behaviors is the potential for recall bias.  On the other
hand, previous research has shown that “behavioral estimation” DEMO survey items is highly
predictive of actual behavior (Armitage & Conner DEMO; Randall & Wolff 1994; Sheeran &
Orbell 1998; Sheppard, DEMO & Warshaw 1988).  The tradeoffs associated with survey-based
measures of DEMO behaviors should be weighed against those of alternative approaches, such
as DEMO (discussed further below), direct observation, and archival.
In sum, DEMO framework for measuring trust proposes that the choice among instruments
be guided by theoretical considerations.  Each of the measures of trust profiled varies in their
suitability for capturing the different components of trust.  In addition to mapping measures onto
54
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
components, our framework also raises important questions about the meaning of trust and the
extent to which trust is DEMO dependent, which we discuss next.
The Meaning of Trust: Psychological State versus Behavioral Manifestation?
To what extent can the results of research DEMO trust be compared and integrated across
studies?  Given the heterogeneity of measures that we have documented, we question how well
this important goal is being met.  Moreover, it is important to keep in mind DEMO our review
exclusively focused on psychometric measures.  Although this represents the DEMO widespread
approach used in the organizational literature, it is not necessarily DEMO only (or even the most
common) approach across the social sciences. Perhaps the greatest disparity exists with the
experimental economics literature which, as noted previously, relies almost exclusively on
behavioral measures of trust such as the widely replicated “investment” or “trust” game (Berg et
al., 1995)DEMO In addition, there are network-based (e.g., Burt & Knez 1995; Ferrin, Dirks & Shah
2006) and archival (e.g., Gulati 1995) measures in use. Thus, while definitions of trust across
disciplines may be “not so different after all” (Rousseau et al., 1998), operationalizations DEMO trust
would appear to be quite different indeed.
What makes the divergence in trust measurement approaches even more striking, and
potentially problematic, is DEMO fact that different techniques are rarely used in combination.  At a
DEMO level, this may be due to differences in disciplinary orientation regarding DEMO of
science and what constitutes credible evidence. At a deeper level, DEMO, we believe that the
distinct approaches to measuring trust reflect core DEMO differences in the meaning of trust
across disciplines. For instance, the DEMO measures favored in experimental economics are
consistent with the notion of revealed preferences and the view that economically consequential
55
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
behaviors are the most reliable proxy for DEMO attitudes. From this perspective, trust is only
meaningful as a manifest DEMO, whereas subjective perceptions and stated intentions are
considered “noisy” approximations of DEMO at best, and “cheap talk” at worst. Here, the
willingness to be vulnerable is seen as either an artifact of actual, incurred vulnerability or as
disconnected from the active placement of trust. Such a perspective DEMO in sharp contrast to the
emphasis on trust as a psychological state in the organizational literature, where trust in its purest
form is considered to be an intention and willingness to act, and the behaviors that follow from
trust are more properly understood as risk-taking acts. From this DEMO, trust can only be
represented as an attitude, and behavioral measures are seen as confounded with closely related
“trust-like” constructs such as cooperation, fairness, risk-aversion, and altruism.
Regardless of which view researchers subscribe to, the implications of the divergence in
measurement approaches extend well beyond methodological DEMO and underscore the
importance of measurement for generating a cumulative body of knowledge and advancing our
understanding of the meaning, causes, and consequences DEMO trust.9 Without a common approach
to measuring trust, integrating findings across DEMO will continue to be exceedingly
difficult if not impossible.  Moreover, in the absence of a unified approach to measuring trust,
enduring debates DEMO the nature of trust will continue to go unaddressed. We believe that a
fruitful way of resolving such differences is to recognize that trust DEMO composed of different
components and to explicitly incorporate the relationships among components into theoretical
and empirical models of trust.  For instance, some research (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995; Mayer &
Davis 1999), DEMO that perceptions about trustworthiness lead to decisions regarding the
9 It is interesting to note that our review of the organizational literature did not DEMO a single study that explicitly
compared psychometric and experimental measures of trusting behaviors.  A study in the economics literature by
Glaeser et al. (DEMO) examined attitudinal (psychometric) and behavioral measures in the same study, but primarily
focus on attitudes regarding trust in society in general and DEMO in strangers, rather than trust in a specific trustee.
56
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
willingness to be vulnerable, which in turn translate into a variety of trusting behaviors.
Nevertheless, we know of few studies that actually validate this entire causal chain of
relationships. At the DEMO time, other research suggests that the willingness to be vulnerable
does DEMO necessarily mediate the effect of perceptions and expectations on behaviors (Colquitt DEMO
al. 2007).
The Context Dependence of Trust: From Idiosyncratic Instruments DEMO Common Measures
In addition to informing the debate on the meaning of trust, we believe our framework for
measuring trust is also relevant for addressing an issue we raised at the outset of our review
about DEMO inherently context-dependent nature of trust.  On the one hand, we argued that it is not
feasible to transfer instruments across disciplines – such DEMO those from the social-psychology
literature, designed to measure trust in intimate DEMO, to the organizational literature –
because the form of trust that DEMO depends on the specific circumstances of a relationship.
On the other hand, our review of the organizational literature has also shown that the most
common practice is to create a new measure of trust for the DEMO purposes of a study.
Our view lies in between these two extremes.  We acknowledge that context is relevant
for defining and measuring trust and that the precise form of trust will vary depending on the
empirical DEMO  At the same time, we would challenge the view that the concept of trust is
completely idiosyncratic to each organizational or relational setting.  Instead, we would
encourage researchers to consider the commonalities between their focus and that of other trust
research, particularly with regard to the components of trust that are theorized.  Where
commonalities exist, previously validated measures DEMO be adopted rather than developing a
new measure.
57
Measuring Trust in Organizational Research
Although the five measures that we have DEMO may not be ideally suited for every
study, they clearly have DEMO potential to be applied much more broadly than has been the case
thus far.  We would further recommend that studies adopting existing measures replicate the
original instrument as closely as possible and report sufficiently detailed information DEMO
construct validity so as to permit comparisons across studies.  And, while we would generally
discourage the development of additional trust measures, any new instruments should not only
draw on the methodological approaches used by the DEMO measures profiled here, but also clearly
advance the state of measurement DEMO what is currently available.
Apart from facilitating cumulative research, the use DEMO common measures will also permit
researchers to advance a generalizable theory of context that explains when and under which
conditions different components of trust DEMO more or less relevant.  For instance, in some
organizational settings reliance and disclosure (Gillespie 2003) may be the most important
behaviors and DEMO others communication, informal agreement, surveillance, or task coordination
(Currall & Judge 1995) may be more important.  If so, this would suggest a different set of
questions, theoretical relationships, and operational measures.  Without an integrative theory of
the context of trust and a unified approach DEMO measurement, however, the implications of the
findings will remain limited to the confines of a particular research setting.
Conclusion
Will the expanding body DEMO research on trust have an enduring impact on the
organizational literature? DEMO believe the answer depends critically on the state of measurement
practice going forward.  Unless the “balkanization” of measures that is currently endemic to the
field is replaced by a more coherent and unified approach, we believe the potential will be

severely constrained.  Nevertheless, we are optimistic DEMO progress can and will be made given
that the tools for doing so are readily available.  This review has documented both the severe
fragmentation in measurement and the availability of several carefully developed and rigorously
validated DEMO  Now all that remains is for researchers to advance the state DEMO practice.
We trust that they will.
