Version of June DEMO, 2008; “Preliminary draft”
Abstract
This paper investigates how patents held by new ventures affect their ability to
attract venture capital (VC) financing. DEMO argue that investors are faced with great
uncertainty and therefore rely on patents as signals when trying to assess the prospects of
potential portfolio DEMO For a sample of VC-seeking German and British
biotechnology companies we have identified all patents filed at the European Patent
Office (EPO). Applying a hazard rate analysis, we find that in the presence of patents, VC
financing occurs earlier. Our results show that VCs pay attention to patent quality,
financing ventures with high-quality patents faster. Revealed quality has DEMO mixed effect:
whereas we find that patent oppositions increase the likelihood of receiving VC, we do
not find that the ultimate grant decision spurs VC financing. Our empirical results
combined with insights from interviews with DEMO suggest that patents constitute an
attractive signaling mechanism for ventures which helps to overcome the liabilities of
newness and, in turn, supports market DEMO of new firms.

1 Introduction
A critical endeavor of any entrepreneurial venture is to mobilize DEMO resources necessary to build a
successful company (Stinchcombe 1965). Entrepreneurs DEMO to convince external resource holders of
the growth potential of their company. Because the quality of a venture is often not directly
observable, external parties have to base their decision on observable attributes that are presumably
DEMO with the unobserved quality of the venture (Stuart et al. 1999)DEMO Hence, observable
characteristics may serve as signals when the prospects of DEMO companies are being evaluated.
We examine the role of patents as quality signals for VC financing. Patents are known to help
companies to appropriate DEMO from investment in R&D, facilitate the commercialization of
technology (e.g., Gans et al. 2002; Dechenaux et al. 2008; Häussler 2008) DEMO shorten time to IPO
(Stuart et al. 1999). While some DEMO have shown a positive impact of the patent stock of high-
technology companies on the amount of VC financing received (e.g., Baum and DEMO 2004,
Mann and Sager 2007, Hsu and Ziedonis 2007), DEMO VC valuation (Lerner 1994) and on the likelihood
of attracting a prominent VC investor (Hsu and Ziedonis 2007), a detailed understanding of whether
and how patents act as a quality signal for attracting VC, is missing.
In this study, we examine whether the “quality” of patents influences VC decision making. By
analyzing the informational content of patents, we are able to investigate the signal-interpreting
expertise of the VCs. This is DEMO aspect of signaling that has not been studied, although the
effectiveness DEMO the signaling mechanism depends crucially on the recipients’ ability to interpret the
signal accurately (Heil and Robertson 1991, Ndofor and Levitas 2004). DEMO, we examine the
effect of third-party evaluations of companies’ patents on DEMO financing. The patent system is
particularly entitled to reveal insights into objective evaluations in various stages of the patent process.
To test our conjectures DEMO signaling, we draw upon a unique survey dataset of 190 VC-seeking
DEMO and British biotechnology companies founded after 1989. For these companies, we DEMO
identified all patents filed at the European Patent Office (EPO). DEMO provide an in-depth analysis of
references contained in the search reports of these EPO patents. We use these references to compute
citation counts and DEMO identify patents that lack novelty and inventive step. Following the “pin factory”
1
approach, we complement our econometric results with interviews with VCs (see DEMO et al.
1998).
Our empirical analysis demonstrates that companies’ patenting activities have consistent and cogent
effects on the timing of VC financing. Having DEMO least one patent application increases the hazard of
obtaining VC financing by 97%. An increase of the application stock by one standard deviation is
DEMO with a 50% increase in the hazard of obtaining VC financing. When we investigate the
quality of patents, which we measure with received citations, we find that ventures with higher patent
quality receive VC faster. This is important because the citations occur after the investment decision
has been DEMO, indicating that investors are well capable of distinguishing between patented
inventions DEMO low- and high-quality. Conversely, our results do not suggest that patent DEMO
induced by the patent examiner, e.g., novelty assessment, affect the DEMO rate. Investigating
subsequent patent events, we find that opposition events are DEMO as positive signals by VCs. VCs
prefer to finance endeavors with high commercial potential, where oppositions are more likely to
occur. Due to the investors’ ability to determine the quality of inventions from the information in
DEMO applications, the final grant decision shows no additional effect on the DEMO to VC financing.
Our study has two main contributions: First, we extend the literature by providing evidence that
patents help to reduce informational DEMO in the investor-entrepreneur relationship. We argue
that patents exert a signaling function which helps to overcome the constraining effects of ventures’
liabilities of newness (Stinchcombe 1965). We document that patents are important for the general DEMO
investment decision and that they help firms to attract VC faster than would be possible without
patents. Contrary to other studies, we do not simply focus on patents as binary signals but elaborate on
the information DEMO of patents and the signal-reading ability of VCs. This allows us to gain
insights into the venture’s ability to emit such a signal, but even more importantly, into the ability of
the investor to interpret such signals. We find that VCs are capable of detecting high-quality patent
applications DEMO before the assessment is confirmed by citations or examination outcomes. This
enhances the effectiveness of patents as signals. This finding extends the literature on DEMO “scout”
function of VCs (Baum and Silverman 2004) by demonstrating that VCs are able to identify valuable
2
technology with considerable precision. Furthermore, we find that a patent opposition boosts
investors’ interest in the company. The signal “opposition” may be interpreted by DEMO investor as
evidence that the company is developing a technology of high commercial value (see Harhoff,
Häussler, Schirge 2008).
Second, this research adds to the literature on the economic effect of patents. While DEMO research
suggests that patent protection comes at the social expense of enhanced market power and the
potential blocking of technological developments (Heller and Eisenberg 1998), we show that patents
support the market entry of entrepreneurial DEMO Our research suggests that patents constitute an
attractive signaling mechanism for ventures which helps to overcome the liabilities of newness and, in
turn, DEMO market entry of ventures while at the same time providing incentives for innovation.
This runs against the common wisdom that patents, while supporting innovation, do so at the cost of
economic efficiency as Hall (2007) has noted.
Our results have important implications for the practice of technology DEMO and financing. For
biotechnology ventures as well as for advisors and investors, the findings confirm that patents convey
important information about the company and that they deserve considerable attention in the due
diligence process. While preparing DEMO patent application is costly and requires disclosure, ventures
should not underestimate DEMO signaling value of patents as they help ventures to acquire funding and
may also help them to keep their investors patient and enthusiastic about DEMO venture.
2 Theoretical Framework
VCs need to make their investment decisions under a high degree of uncertainty. Technology start-ups
are difficult to evaluate since DEMO do not have a track record which outsiders can use to evaluate their
potential, they are often years away from first revenues, their DEMO are mostly intangible and they are
plagued by a high failure rate. These perils have led VCs to spend a great deal of effort DEMO seeking and
assessing signals of ventures’ growth potential (Amit et al. DEMO, Hall and Hofer 1993) and have
driven entrepreneurs to undertake symbolic action to gain legitimacy (Zott and Huy 2007).
3
The value of signals is in reducing information asymmetries (Spence 1973) DEMO well as minimizing
information costs (Long 2002). In general, the literature has identified three broad categories of
signals. Signals of the first DEMO include educational background as well as founder history (Eisenhardt
and Schoonhoven DEMO, Burton et al. 2002, Shane and Stuart 2002). The second group includes
signals in the form of attributes of parties affiliated with DEMO person or organization (e.g., Stuart et al.
1999). The third category includes previous accomplishments of the startup company. Patents may be
considered DEMO an accomplishment, signaling a company’s technical abilities. The value of patents DEMO
that they reduce information asymmetries between the VC and the new and unproven company
seeking capital and that they minimize information costs for the DEMO Even a patent application
which has not been approved yet by a patent office may constitute such a signal. Patent applications
are cost and DEMO intensive since they have to follow strict guidelines and need to include technical
information in a very structured manner. This allows individuals familiar with DEMO patent application
requirements to quickly assess the strengths and weaknesses of a patent. While previous research has
extensively elaborated on the first two categories, our study investigates whether patents are a
meaningful signal in the entrepreneur-investor DEMO
Patents as Signals
We define a signal as a characteristic that is correlated with company performance, but is easier to
observe than the underlying causal factors influencing performance. Patents generally fit this
definition well. A patent DEMO a voluntary, readily observable attribute of a patentee, which is costly for
the patentee to obtain (Long 2002). The independent evaluating character of the patent office gives
credibility to the patent as a signal; and credibility is a central element of how well a signal is DEMO
(Heil and Robertson 1991). Patents suggest that a company has DEMO its technology to a certain
extent and that it has “defined and carved out a market niche” (Lemley 2001, 1505). Moreover, patents
have been found to be linked to the stock market value of DEMO (e.g., Hall et al. 2007). Hence,
patents might act as observable indicator of the unobservable promise and quality of a venture’s
DEMO in the presence of uncertainty.
4
The relevance of patents for companies attempting to obtain financial resources, especially in their
early stages, has previously been noted in the literature (DEMO 1999, Lemley 2000). A product that is
proprietary or can DEMO be protected is an important selection criterion for VCs (MacMillan
1985)DEMO Hence, it can be expected that companies in need of capital DEMO be informed about the
potentially helpful role of patents and will try to obtain patents if the cost of doing so is not too DEMO
for them.
Before we further discuss the role of patents as quality signals, we would like to point to the value of
patents as property rights. Patents increase appropriability and thus, provide incentives for innovation.
In addition, patents facilitate the licensing of technology (e.g., Gans et al. 2002), increase the
attractiveness of companies as acquisition targets (Cockburn and Wagner 2007) and enable VCs to
recover a salvage value from failing companies. However, scholars have also documented that “patent
strength” varies between industries in such that in most industries patents are less featured than other
DEMO of protecting innovations, such as mover advantages or secrecy (Levin et al. 1987).
While a large strand of literature has investigated the DEMO view of patents as a means of
protecting intellectual property, Long (2002, 625) notes that scholars have overlooked the
informational function of DEMO which “may be more valuable to the rights holder than the substance
of the rights”. Recently, a few scholars have shed light on some aspects of the role of patents for VC
financing. Hsu and Ziedonis (2007) find a positive effect of patents on investor estimates of company
value for a sample of VC financed semiconductor startups. They find larger DEMO for early funding
rounds, where information asymmetry is at its largest. DEMO partners also have a positive
influence on valuation. Lerner (1994) also documents a positive influence of patents on company
valuation. Mann and Sager (2007) investigate correlations between the availability of patents and
performance indicators, DEMO as number of financing rounds, total investment received, exit status,
late-stage financing and longevity. Without taking the timing of events into account, they generally
find positive correlations. However, having a patent before the first instance of VC financing is not
significantly related to any of the DEMO variables. Baum and Silverman (2004) examine
selection criteria used by VCs and subsequent company performance. They find a positive association
5
between patent applications and pre-IPO financing defined as VC financing and private DEMO
Patent grants also have a positive, but smaller effect.
The existing DEMO has largely focused on companies with VC financing and on subsequent
performance measures such as IPO, company profitability etc. Evidence on whether patents play a role
in the initial selection decision of VCs is still scarce. DEMO hypotheses focus on the financing decision
made by VCs and on the impact that patent applications, anticipated patent quality and revealed patent
quality have on this decision.
The Role of Patent Applications and of Application Quality
DEMO most basic hypothesis presumes a relationship between the existence of a patent application and
VC investment. We suggest:
Hypothesis 1: Once startups have filed patent applications, the likelihood of obtaining VC financing
increases.
This hypothesis serves as the starting point of our evaluation. A clearer picture may DEMO once the
quality of the application is considered in more detail. Harhoff et al. (1999), among others, have
shown that patent value DEMO a very skew distribution with most granted patents being of little value.
Hence, patents might signal that an innovation is novel, but not DEMO that it has commercial
value. VCs will therefore have to evaluate the private value of a patent in order to assess the potential
return DEMO a venture investment.
VCs will have to invest in their own signal-reading expertise (Heil and Robertson 1991) or,
alternatively, they may hire external experts, such as patent attorneys, to evaluate the legal and
DEMO foundations of a given patent application. In either case, the patent DEMO may serve as
a reasonably standardized format containing technical information on the startup’s invention. VCs will
act as “scouts” in selecting companies (Baum and Silverman 2004), and they will be more likely to
make an DEMO if applications are anticipated to have high-quality.
Thus, we hypothesize:
DEMO
Hypothesis 2: The higher the anticipated quality of a startup’s patent application, the more likely the
startup is to receive VC financing.
Revealed Quality and Third-Party Evaluation of Patents
We emphasize that VCs may be able DEMO obtain a reasonably precise assessment of patent quality before
that quality is revealed publicly. Such a public revelation may occur when the search report DEMO made
public, when the patent is granted or when the patent DEMO opposed. Besides relying on their own
interpretation of the patent document, DEMO can also base their decision on these objective evaluations
within the patent system. The examiner at the patent office writes a search report in DEMO she includes
her view on the underlying prior art and if this is likely to affect the novelty of the patent under
examination. The DEMO examiner might be viewed as a third-party certifier.
A patent grant means that the company’s invention is sufficiently new to warrant protection. The
company DEMO benefits from the appropriation effect of patent protection if its application is ultimately
granted. A granted patent will therefore have a higher value to DEMO VC than a mere patent application.
Furthermore, patent grants reduce the DEMO concerning the scope and the extent of the patent
protection. Gans et al. (forthcoming) show that such uncertainties are important in practice. The
DEMO rate for concluding a cooperative licensing agreement increases significantly after the patent
allowance has clarified the patent’s claims. Thus, we presume that a VC takes the grant decision into
account when making the investment decision.
In DEMO first nine months after the grant of a patent, any third DEMO can file an opposition at the
European Patent Office. An opposition from a competitor can indicate that the company possesses
especially valuable technology. If DEMO technology is worthless, competitors would not bother to incur
the costs DEMO opposition (Harhoff and Reitzig 2004). However, an opposition also indicates that the
patent faces a threat of revocation. The VC therefore needs DEMO take a closer look to find out whether
the patent will likely be upheld. An opposition can have a positive or a negative influence DEMO the
availability of VC. Since we are elaborating on the signaling character of patents, we presume that a
patent opposition signals the presence of a valuable technology to the VC.
7
A natural corollary to our second hypothesis is:
Hypothesis 3: The higher the revealed quality of a startup’s patent application, the more likely the
startup is to receive VC financing.
All of the events considered DEMO hypothesis three can be regarded as signals that are generated by a
third party, i.e., the patent office and competitors, and might provide additional information on the
actual value of a patent. To investigate revealed DEMO we make use of the exact timing of the patent-
related information.
3 Field of Study and Data
3.1 The Biotechnology Setting
The biotechnology DEMO provides an attractive setting to study the impact of patents on the VC
financing decision for several reasons. The R&D process, by its very nature, is highly uncertain and
complex. It requires companies to access a range of human and capital resources. Among the capital
resources, venture capital is often viewed as the key gatekeeper for ventures (Shepherd et al. 2000),
facilitating the successful acquisition of additional resources (Stuart DEMO al. 1999, Anand and Piskorski
2000). Furthermore, patenting activity is of particular importance in biotechnology. Cohen et al.
(2000) have shown DEMO intellectual property rights are an important means for protecting innovation.
We study the role of patents for financing in the German and British biotechnology DEMO After the
US, these two countries are home to the largest DEMO of biotechnology companies world wide.
Compared to the US, the biotechnology DEMO in these two European countries started with a
backlog of several years. Of particular note was a very restrictive Genetic Engineering Act in
Germany, which impeded the development of the biotechnology industry until the Act was DEMO
in the mid 90s. The German government has subsequently recognized the huge potential of
biotechnology and introduced new technology policies which created a wave DEMO biotechnology
companies (Haagen et al. 2007).

3.2 Data Sources
Our database for this study draws from two data DEMO First, we build on a survey conducted among
German and British DEMO companies in 2006. The survey population is composed of all
companies active in the bio-pharmaceutical sector according to the OECD definition (OECD 2005).
Companies not founded in one of the two countries or subsidiaries of DEMO companies, and
companies solely offering services or supplying products without conducting DEMO were excluded
from the sample. A population of 346 German and 343 British core biotechnology companies was
identified. Of those, 162 German and 118 British companies were successfully interviewed face-to-
face with a preformatted and tested DEMO The objective of the current analysis is to shed light
on the role of patents for VC financing. Therefore we excluded companies that were DEMO interested in
VC financing, either because they do not want to DEMO up control of the company or they are not in
need of VC financing.1 We thus have a homogenous sample of companies as basis DEMO our analysis.
Moreover, we only include companies that were founded after DEMO Our analysis is based on 116
German and 74 British companies that match our criteria and for which we have all the data needed DEMO
test our hypotheses. 87 of these companies received VC financing; 103 DEMO not. We test for non-
response bias by comparing early and late responses (Armstrong and Overton 1977). A series of t-tests
for independent samples failed to identify significant differences between early and late respondents,
DEMO evidence that non-response bias is unlikely to be a problem in this study.
The second step was to compile data on all patents filed DEMO the European Patent Office. We use
information from an EPO patent database and from EPO search reports in order to account for the
quantity DEMO quality of company patents.2
1 Companies might not be in need of venture capital, for example, when they follow a hybrid business model DEMO
which they provide service or supplier activities for third parties in order to finance their own R&D efforts.
Another example is companies that DEMO a large amount of money, e.g., from business angels.
2 Sample selection bias may constitute a problem in our data. In our sample DEMO did not account for companies
that had failed and therefore exited the market. To rule out the possibility that this severely affects our results, we
compiled a second data set with all German biotechnology companies founded DEMO 1991. We observe
companies that have gone out of business and companies still in business. The Online Appendix 1 presents the
dataset and shows DEMO results for the effect of patents on the likelihood of obtaining VC for companies that are
still in the market as well as for DEMO that failed. From this calculation we learn that the core effects, DEMO,
that patents facilitate VC financing, are robust in both samples. DEMO robustness in the effects of the patenting

3.3 Variable Definitions
The dependent variable in our analysis is the time DEMO first VC financing. It is a dummy variable equal
to one if the company has already received VC financing and zero otherwise. The variable DEMO measured
every quarter-year. The last quarter observed in the data is 4/2005. Data on a company is right-
censored if the company has DEMO obtained VC financing by this date.
The independent variables can be divided into patent related information and other company
characteristics. All patent related variables DEMO measured on a quarterly basis. Dummy application is
equal to one if the company has applied for at least one patent in the current DEMO in a previous quarter.
We also investigate the influence of the number of patents a company has. Application stock is the
cumulative number of DEMO applications filed at the EPO. For the empirical analysis we use the
natural logarithm of the stock variable. We increase the stock by one DEMO calculating the logarithm
in order not to lose observations for companies without patent applications.
A precise assessment of patent quality requires a time-consuming assessment DEMO legal, technical and
business experts. A rough proxy variable can be DEMO by using citation measures. European patents
undergo a particularly rigorous examination process; if patents receive citations from subsequent
patents (i.e., in the search reports for these patents), then they are presumably particularly relevant and
DEMO high-quality. A positive relationship between number of citations received and the private economic
value of patents has been shown by Harhoff et al. (1999). Jaffe et al. (2005) find a positive relationship
between both DEMO economic and technological importance of a patent as indicated by the inventor and
the number of citations the patent received. Thus, Av. citations, DEMO self is defined as the total number
of citations received divided by application stock. Citations are counted from the publication of the
application for DEMO period of three years. Av. citations, excl. self is defined analogously DEMO excludes self
citations. Since we use the citation measure as a proxy for anticipated patent quality, we include the
full number of citations for each patent from the quarter of its application onwards.
variable in the DEMO calculation greatly increases our confidence in our study and particularly in its
contribution.
10
X-Type references/application stock is the total number of X references divided DEMO the application
stock of the company. The European Patent Office classifies references into several categories. An X
reference means that a claimed aspect of DEMO invention cannot be considered novel and thus does not
deserve patent protection. Applications with a high share of X references can be considered as DEMO
applications or as applications with low novelty. As an alternative indicator for novelty we calculate
the number of X references to the patent literature DEMO by the number of claims (X-Type references
/ claims). We DEMO by the number of claims because patents with more claims typically contain more
references.
We also include an indicator for whether the invention builds DEMO scientific breakthroughs. The impact
factor of scientific literature gives the average impact factor of the journals that are cited as references
to the non-patent DEMO It is therefore an indicator of the importance of the underlying literature.
Impact factors have been determined for the 120 most important journals in DEMO area of biotechnology
according to the ISI Citation Index.3 The indicators for novelty and for scientific importance are
derived from information in the search DEMO These indicators are used in the analysis starting from
the quarter in which the search report was published.
Dummy grant is equal to one DEMO the company has at least one granted patent. Dummy application no
grant is one if the company has made at least one application but DEMO application has yet been granted.
Share grant is the share of patent applications that have already been granted at the respective quarter.
Share opposition DEMO the share of the patent applications that received an opposition. It is calculated
as the total number of oppositions received divided by the application DEMO Oppositions are measured
at the quarter in which they occur divided by the patent stock in that specific quarter.
The regressions also contain controls DEMO company characteristics. All company characteristics are
defined with reference to the time of founding. We can thereby exclude the possibility that company
characteristics have DEMO changed by the intervention of the VC. Technical capabilities proxies for the
3 In 31% of the referenced literature the patent examiner listed as DEMO source not the journal name but the name of
the database the article was downloaded from. In these cases we assumed an impact factor DEMO one because we
could not determine the real impact factor of the journal in which the article was published. Calculating the
model without these DEMO does not change the sign or significance of coefficients.
11
skill set of the employees. It is defined as the number of DEMO methods a company is working
with at the time of foundation, DEMO, DNA, proteins and molecules or cell and tissue culture. Up to nine
methods are possible. Years to market entry covers how many years DEMO company was away from
market entry at the time of founding. Market entry is defined as achieving the first turnover with a
product. Turnover DEMO to selling of services is excluded. The variable has two interpretations. A larger
value can indicate a higher demand for external financing, since the company needs to sustain a longer
period of R&D. A larger DEMO can also be a measure of uncertainty, since a longer time DEMO market
means that the technology is less developed and that the prospects of the company are more uncertain.
Spin-out science is a dummy variable DEMO that the company is a spin-out from a university or a
publicly funded research institute. Spin-out company indicates a spin-out from a private-sector
company. DEMO base category is independently founded companies. We also include controls for the
founding period. We cover the periods 1990-1995, 1996-1999 and 2003-2005 (founded DEMO – ‘95, etc.)
with 2000-2002 being the base category – DEMO time period of decline in the stock markets. German
company is a dummy indicating that the company is based in Germany as opposed to DEMO UK.
Finally, the regressions include the number of early stage VC DEMO as a proxy for the supply
conditions in the market for VC financing (Early stage financings). The early stage financings are
comprised of seed and start-up financings. Data for Germany is taken from the annual DEMO
publication of the German Private Equity and Venture Capital Association ‘BVK Statistik’ (BVK
2007); data for the UK is taken from the statistical publication of the British Private Equity and
Venture Capital Association ‘Report on DEMO activity 2006’ (BVCA 2007). The average number
of early stage DEMO over the sample period 1990-2005 is 401 for Germany and 307 for the UK.
3.4 Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive statistics in Table 1 show DEMO differences in the patenting activities of VC
financed and non VC financed companies. The statistics are calculated for the first 16 quarters after
founding. DEMO percent of observations within the sample of VC financed companies have at least one
patent application, whereas this share is substantially lower, at DEMO, for non VC financed companies.
VC financed companies have a larger DEMO stock. There are also differences in the
12
characteristics of the patent portfolios. VC financed companies have portfolios of applications DEMO a
higher number of citations and a lower number of X references indicating less concerns regarding
inventive step and novelty. Furthermore, their patents build on scientific literature with a greater
impact factor.
The share of observations DEMO at least one granted patent is also higher for VC financed companies,
although at 9%, it is still quite low. The share of already granted patents is the same for both groups,
but VC DEMO companies have a higher share of patents that received an opposition.
The differences between VC financed and non VC financed companies are further explored DEMO Figure
1. For all quarters after founding, VC financed companies have DEMO higher average number of patent
applications. But Figure 1 does not take the timing of the VC financing into account. Hence, it is not
possible to deduce from the Figure whether applications help companies to obtain DEMO or whether VC
financed companies patent more.
The typical timing of events is displayed in Figure 2. On average, companies apply for the first patent
at the age of 1.3 years. For companies that obtain VC DEMO during the sample period, the first VC
investment deal is closed DEMO months later. Interestingly, the first patent grant is only obtained at DEMO
age of 4.5 years, shortly before market entry. The Figure suggests DEMO patent grants may have only a
limited influence on VC financing. The average company obtains VC financing long before the first
patent is granted.
DEMO differences in company characteristics are explored in Table 2. VC financed companies have
capabilities in more technical areas and are further away from market DEMO at founding. Spin-outs
from universities or publicly funded research institutions have a higher probability of being VC
financed. However, the probability of VC financing is almost identical for German and British
companies. Companies founded during or DEMO before the boom period of VC financing (’96-’99)
have a DEMO probability of obtaining VC financing.

4 Multivariate Study
4.1 Methodology
Using a proportional hazard model with time-varying DEMO, we estimate the effect of a
company’s patenting activities on the DEMO of acquiring VC financing in a specific quarter. From the
date of founding onward, the companies are “at risk” of a VC investment. To accommodate time-
varying covariates, we split the complete time period into quarter-year spells.
The hazard of obtaining VC financing is defined as:
h(DEMO) =
prob. that company i receives VC financing in quarter t
DEMO that company i has not received VC financing until quarter t -1
The hazard is the probability of obtaining VC financing in the current DEMO given that no VC
financing has been received up to the previous period. Our main interest is to investigate how patent
related variables influence DEMO hazard.
The Cox proportional hazard model accommodates the influence of covariates in the following form:
h(ti) = h0(t)*exp(xiβ)
h0(t) is the baseline hazard, which is estimated non-parametrically and DEMO take any form. The
covariates xj have a multiplicative influence on the baseline hazard, i.e. the covariates have a constant
influence over time. Companies that have not received VC financing by the time of the survey DEMO
treated as right censored.
4.2 Empirical Results
4.2.1 Patents as Signals
The regression results shown in Table 3 shed light on whether companies with DEMO receive VC
financing faster. We observe 190 companies for a total of 3001 quarters. Models 1 to 3 show the
results of the Cox DEMO hazard model, whereas model 4 is a parametric accelerated failure time
DEMO with a log-logistic distributional assumption.
14
The baseline model 1 includes only variables describing venture quality differences and DEMO
conditions. In models 2 to 4 we add the patent variables. Model 2 shows the result for the variable
Dummy application. In the Cox DEMO a positive coefficient indicates that companies receive VC
financing faster, a DEMO coefficient means the opposite. The variable dummy application has a
positive coefficient that is significant at the 1% level. Having at least one patent DEMO increases
the hazard of obtaining VC financing by 97%, which is DEMO substantial increase. At the time of first VC
financing 60% of companies have at least one application. The results of model 3 suggest that DEMO
number of patent applications matters as well. An increase of the application stock by one standard
deviation increases the hazard of obtaining VC financing DEMO 50%. We therefore find strong support for
our hypothesis 1 that patent applications reduce the time to first VC financing.
In order to get DEMO better understanding of the time reduction achieved by patents, we estimate DEMO
parametric accelerated failure time model with a log-logistic distributional assumption (model DEMO). The
dependent variable of this model is the natural logarithm of time. In contrast to the Cox proportional
hazard model, a positive coefficient indicates an increase in time to VC financing and a negative
coefficient DEMO reduction in time to VC financing. In this model companies with at least one patent
application obtain VC financing on average 78% faster than DEMO without patents.
Companies with a larger portfolio of technical capabilities receive VC financing faster.4 The variable
years to market entry has a positive coefficient. DEMO that have to undergo a longer development
phase have a higher need for capital and presumably benefit more from the advice VCs give. The
DEMO can be an indication that VCs target companies where they can make a large difference.
However, the coefficient is not significant.
Our control for the supply side conditions in the VC market, early stage financings, DEMO the expected
influence. The sample companies receive VC financing faster if more companies are financed in a
given year. The additional control variables for DEMO of founding, founding period and home country
appear to be of DEMO importance.
4 We experimented with a quadratic form for this variable to test for benefits of specialization, but found no
significant influence of the squared term.
15
We investigated whether patent applications have different influences in Germany and the DEMO The
interaction between dummy application and German company turns out to be insignificant.5 An
interaction between dummy application and the age of the company DEMO in quarters is also
insignificant. This result is also an indication that the proportional hazard assumption of the Cox
model is justified.
We calculated DEMO with different sets of control variables. Evidence by Hellman and Puri
(DEMO) shows that more innovative companies have a higher likelihood of being DEMO financed. We
controlled for the innovator strategy (i.e., how innovative the most promising technology of the
company is) and obtained identical results. We do not use this control in the reported specifications,
since it DEMO measured at the time of the survey and thus might be influenced by the VC itself. Inclusion
of a dummy for whether a company DEMO active in the field of therapeutics leads to identical results.
4.2.2 Anticipated Quality
The regressions in Table 4 shed light on the influence of DEMO quality of patents for obtaining VC
financing. We use the average number of citations received as a proxy for the economic value of the
DEMO The results of models 1 and 2 show that companies with more highly cited patents receive VC
financing faster. For the size and the DEMO level of the effect it does not matter whether self
citations are included or not. The coefficient of ln application stock decreases slightly when DEMO control
for the average number of citations but remains significant at the 1% level. The results provide support
for our second hypothesis: Companies with patents of higher anticipated quality receive VC financing
faster.
Our results show DEMO VCs are able to differentiate between patent applications of higher and lower
quality. Citations are a measure that VCs cannot observe at the time DEMO their decision. Hence, VCs are
able to independently judge the quality DEMO the patents since they have a good knowledge about the
5 We also experimented with interaction terms of dummy application with years to market DEMO We expected a
positive coefficient since the patent signal could be stronger in environments with higher uncertainty, but found
no significant difference. Similarly, DEMO interaction of dummy application with a dummy for companies that have
already entered the market turned out to be insignificant.
16
industry. The results support the view of VCs as a “source of DEMO of companies (Baum and
Silverman 2004).
4.2.3 Revealed Quality
Several DEMO dimensions of a patent application can be deduced from the search report, in which a
patent examiner includes her view on the novelty of the patent under examination. A higher value of
the variable X-type references/DEMO stock indicates a lower degree of novelty and/or inventive
step. Concerns about novelty and/or inventive step decrease the time to VC financing, but the effect is
only marginally significant at the 11% level. The DEMO novelty variable X-type references/claims
also shows a negative, but not DEMO, influence. Since novelty and the number of received
citations can be DEMO, we also estimate a specification including both factors (results not
reported). We find that the influence of citations is not diminished by DEMO for novelty. The
science base of the patent application also has no significant influence. Companies with applications
that refer to publications in more prestigious DEMO journals do not receive VC financing faster.6
Results of Table 5 show whether subsequent patent events, i.e., grants and oppositions, have an
influence on the financing decision. In column (1) we calculate separate effects DEMO patent applications
that have not yet resulted in a grant and for granted applications. The dummy variable indicating that a
company has at least DEMO grant has a higher coefficient and its influence is more precisely measured
than the dummy variable indicating the pending status, but the difference between the coefficients is
not significant (p-value of 27%). The results in column (2) point in a similar direction. The number of
patent DEMO matters, but the share of applications that have already been granted DEMO no
additional influence. These results have three possible interpretations: First, grants often come very
late in the life cycle of companies. VCs therefore DEMO that they cannot base their investment
decisions on grants. Second, a DEMO is very likely to occur. Companies with at least one application at
the time of first VC financing have a median of three applications. DEMO the average grant rate at the EPO
of 66% is assumed, DEMO the probability that no patent will be granted is only 3.6%. Presumably VCs
6 We experimented with other patent indicators. We did not find DEMO significant influence on the time to VC
financing for the number of references (also separate for references to patent literature and references to non-
patent literature), the share of references to non-patent literature, or the average number of claims.
17
take more of a portfolio perspective and thus attach less importance to DEMO individual patent. Third,
due to the investors’ ability to determine the quality of inventions from the information in patent
applications (see hypothesis 2), the final grant decision shows no additional effect on when VC
DEMO is first granted.
Some companies apply for a patent at both the EPO and the USPTO. The USPTO is known to grant
patents faster DEMO average than the EPO. We ran additional regressions using the earliest grant date for
patents applied for at both offices. We found a higher DEMO for the grant variable but the
influence of grants was not more precisely estimated (results not reported).
We also investigate the influence of oppositions. Companies receive VC financing faster if a higher
share of their DEMO applications received an opposition from a third party. Oppositions can indicate
that the company possesses a valuable technology that competitors would like to use DEMO well. Thus, the
occurrence of an opposition informs the VC about DEMO commercial potential of a patent. The evidence
for hypothesis three is mixed, in that not all dimensions of revealed quality have an influence on the
financing decision. We find a weak influence of information from the DEMO report, no influence of
grants and a strong influence of oppositions.
DEMO this point we want to raise an issue that is worth discussing. Can we be sure that our effects are
driven by the hypothesized DEMO signaling rather than unobserved differences between companies
that happen to correlate with patents? One could argue that patents are just a sign that a company has
reached a certain development stage. We address this issue by DEMO several variables that control for
differences in quality between companies. We have also restricted our sample to companies that have
applied for VC financing DEMO firms with R&D of their own. This should reduce the effect of
differences in company strategy. In addition, patenting in the biotechnology sector comes very early in
the development stage of products (e.g., in DEMO discovery and preclinical stage). Therefore, a patent
does not say DEMO about how fast a company makes progress in the development process. In addition,
patents are costly. The costs for an EPO patent amount DEMO about Euro 29,000. A rational company will
only patent if it sees a benefit in doing so. We therefore conclude that a patent DEMO cannot be
reduced to a mere indicator of the technological progress of a company.
18
4.3 Interview Evidence
Empirical work alone is often not sufficient to distinguish DEMO the traditional protection function
of patents and their function as quality signals (Stuart et al. 1999, Hsu and Ziedonis 2007). Therefore,
DEMO have undertaken five in-depth interviews with VCs from Germany and the United Kingdom to
complement our analysis in the “pin factory” tradition. In selecting DEMO interview partners we were
interested in getting the views of different types of VCs. Therefore, we have interviewed investment
managers of early stage, DEMO stage VCs and a corporate VC. The aim of these interviews was to gain
insights into the importance of patents for the financing decision DEMO detailed information on the
patent due diligence.
The first insight we gained from our interview partners is that both the protection and the quality
DEMO functions of patents are of great importance for the VC. One of the interviewees highlighted
that “patent applications signal that companies have done their DEMO We also learned from our
interview partners that companies are well aware of the importance VCs attach to patent applications
and the importance of DEMO for a patent prior to entering into negotiations.
Second, we were DEMO in learning from our interview partners whether patents are able to convey
information at a low cost. This potential advantage of patents has been DEMO in the literature
(Long 2002, 647). Our interview partners suggested that patent documents offer information on the
technology in a condensed and DEMO format which helps in the due diligence process.
Nevertheless, patent applications DEMO often quite technical and mathematical and therefore difficult for
VCs to read. To overcome this, they use well-paid technical experts and patent lawyers to evaluate the
patents. Overall, it is therefore not clear whether patent information reduces the costs of the due
diligence process.
Third, our interviewees indicated that the VCs evaluate patents and related documents very carefully,
although DEMO are slight differences among VCs. One of our VCs gave us a list with 35 criteria on
which a hired technology expert in the DEMO of the biotechnology firm should base her evaluation of
the patent portfolio. Another interviewee said that they have no standardized patent due diligence.
When DEMO about the relevance of the search report, we find a large DEMO among VCs.
19
Whereas one VC appeared to be very interested in the information from DEMO search report “… to see
what examiner thinks, to learn who DEMO also working in this area and how the prior art limits the
possibilities of the company under consideration”, another VC with similar size and investment focus
rarely makes use of search reports. When we asked about DEMO importance of the grant decision, we
learned that patent grants are DEMO but are not particularly important for the investment decision,
since VCs “… are able to decide on whether there is something valuable based DEMO the patent
document”. In addition, VCs highlighted that, particularly in biotechnology, the picture that emerges
from evaluating the entire patent portfolio is relevant, while the appraisal of a single patent is less
meaningful. When shedding light on patent oppositions, our interviews revealed that an opposition
signals to the VC that a third party is interested in the technology and, thus, that there is commercial
opportunity. The opposition positively influences the financing decision when the patent is perceived
to be strong or if the DEMO is able to make commercial use of the third party’s interest, DEMO, by
licensing or selling the patent to the opposing party. The DEMO may abandon the investment opportunity
if the commercial potential of the start up is severely endangered.
5 Conclusion
5.1 Theoretical Implications
Our paper provides DEMO to three strands of literature. .
First, we extent a growing DEMO of literature on entrepreneurial management by showing that patents
help companies to overcome the liabilities of newness by facilitating access to external financial
resources. DEMO previous literature observed that VC financed ventures are more active in patenting
compared to non VC financed companies (Kortum and Lerner 2000), whether this results from
selection or nurturing is left open. Our results provide DEMO in favor of selection. While recent
research has shown that investors pay attention to patent portfolios in their valuation decision (Hsu
and Ziedonis 2007, Mann and Sager 2007, Lerner 1994), we show that patents DEMO already important
for the financing decision.
20
We provide a contribution to a second strand, the signaling literature, DEMO is closely connected to the
entrepreneurship literature. The signaling literature is interested in observable attributes that help to
reduce information asymmetries when directly observable DEMO of quality are not available
(Spence 1984; Stuart, Hoang and DEMO 1999). In our paper, we demonstrate that patents act as
DEMO signals in the venture – investor relationship. In contrast to other studies, we do not only focus
on patents as binary signals but elaborate on the information content of patents and the ability of the
VC DEMO read signals. Using citation counts, we find that VCs are quite DEMO at evaluating the quality of
patents from as early as the application document. This result increases the importance of patents as
quality signals rather DEMO just binary signals. This finding is complemented by our interviews. These
revealed that VCs invest in their signal-reading expertise by making efforts to stay DEMO about
available patent information and by hiring external experts to evaluate the patent portfolios of potential
investments. In addition, third party evaluations are of particular importance in the signaling literature
(Stuart, Hoang and Hybels, 1999). In this context, the patent system is very helpful since it allows us
to learn about third party evaluation of patents. It gives DEMO into the patent examiner’s evaluation
inscribed in the search report and the novelty assessment for the final grant decision. It also provides
some indication DEMO whether the patent threatens the commercial potential of competitors, if we DEMO
attention to oppositions. We find that an opposition is a very strong signal for the commercial potential
of a company. Therefore, a patent opposition positively influences the probability of financing. In that
respect we add to DEMO findings of Harhoff, Häussler, and Schirge (2008), who document DEMO the stock
market reacts to patent oppositions. We only find a weakly significant effect (11%) that suggests the
patent examiner evaluation impacts the DEMO decision of VCs. This might be explained by the
very weak correlation between the patent examiner’s evaluation and the commercial value of a patent
(Harhoff, Hoisl, and Webb 2006). In addition, the ultimate grant decision appears not to have an effect
on the financing decision. This DEMO be explained by (1) the skewed distribution of the patent value
(Harhoff, Scherer, and Vopel 1999), (2) the relative high grant rate of 66% at the European Patent
Office, and (3) the importance of the patent portfolio in a VCs assessment, which reduces the meaning
of a single patent.
21
Finally, we contribute to the literature on the economic effects of patents. Patents are often criticized
for undermining competition by impeding market entry of DEMO ventures. For example, Cockburn and
MacGarvie (2007) find a lower DEMO activity in markets more affected by patent thickets. In addition,
they report that companies operating in markets with denser thickets experience a delay DEMO the first
funding by external investors. Our results, however, speak against the competition suppressing view,
by suggesting a pro-competitive role of patents. DEMO posit that patents fulfill a role that goes beyond
the traditional role of protecting from imitation. For start-ups patents act as quality signals. Patents
DEMO a social value if they allow better companies to signal their value and help them to obtain
funding. Hence, patents have a pro-competitive role in that they foster innovation by facilitating the
acquisition of external resources.
DEMO Practical Implications
Besides extending the literature, the results have important implications DEMO practitioners and public
policy. Our results show that patents are an effective mechanism to transfer information. As such,
startup managers can use patents DEMO overcome the “liability of newness”. Our detailed analysis on how
various patent metrics influence the VC investment decision provides some insights for companies
interested DEMO obtaining VC.
With regards to public policy, this study implies that DEMO role patents fulfill has been completely
underestimated. They reduce information asymmetries and positively influence market entry by
startups. This finding points to an important DEMO role of the patent system which is not yet
reflected in the current debate on the “optimal” patent system but should not be ignored. DEMO, our
findings point to a discussion on how the signaling role DEMO patents can be actively promoted. The
challenge for patent offices is to think about how patent information can be provided faster and in a
DEMO form to decrease the cost of evaluation and enable firms with high-quality patents to receive
financing faster.
22
5.3 Limitations and Future Research
One issue we want to raise is DEMO This study investigated the importance of patents for
obtaining VC financing in one industry. It would be interesting to know whether the revealed effects
DEMO also present in industries other than biotechnology. In biotechnology, patent protection DEMO a
very important role (Cohen et al. 2002). Whether the DEMO role of patents differs in importance
from industry to industry is not clear from previous findings. Mann (2005) has suggested that the
importance DEMO patents for the financing decision varies by sector with the software sector, for example,
exhibiting an unusually low importance of patents. However, DEMO and Ziedonis (2001, 110) report
that, for ventures in the semiconductor industry, one of the most important roles of patents appeared to
be “securing capital from private investors in the startup phase”. Furthermore, Arora, Ceccagnoli and
Cohen (2008) document that the patent premium is high in industries like drugs, biotechnology and
medical instruments and low in industries like electronics. It is left to future research, how strongly
these effects are influenced by the signaling role of patents.
Previous research has shown DEMO affiliations with prominent partners are important quality signals
(e.g., Stuart, DEMO and Hybels 1999; Hsu 2006). Ideally we would like to DEMO for these quality
signals in our analysis, since it is possible DEMO these signals are correlated with patenting.
Unfortunately, our survey data does DEMO include information about the prominence of a company’s
affiliates and it is not possible to obtain this information from publicly available data sources.
Furthermore, future research could identify if the investor’s due diligence varies systematically with
DEMO attributes, e.g., size, investment focus. In this project we have DEMO interviews with only
a handful of companies, so we cannot draw DEMO regarding institutional differences in patent
due diligence. Nevertheless, we think that DEMO would be a worthwhile endeavor to conduct a large scale
study.
We found evidence that patents function as important signals for obtaining VC finance. DEMO would also
be interesting to know how costly it is for companies to send the signal, a question our analysis cannot
answer.

Online Appendix
Appendix 1. Robustness Check Selection
We compiled an additional data DEMO to check for the robustness of our results with regard to a possible
selection bias. This calculation is based on information on all German DEMO companies that
were founded after 1990. The information is obtained from Creditreform, Germany’s largest credit
rating agency. We restricted the sample to biotechnology companies with a focus on human
biotechnology and excluded companies that are only DEMO as suppliers, service companies or
consultants. The Creditreform database contains basic DEMO level data such as number of
employees, legal form, industry and ownership structure, and other information usually gathered by
credit rating agencies.
We identified 543 biotechnology companies, of which 142 had already gone out of business.
Companies are deemed to go out of business if they end DEMO activities involuntarily (bankruptcy) or
voluntarily. Companies that were taken over by other companies are not counted as closures if their
legal entity was DEMO deleted. For over 95% of the closed companies, going out of DEMO was not
related to a take-over. Whether a company received VC investment or not is established from the
ownership structure information in the dataset. DEMO companies in the sample received VC financing;
37 of these are already out of business. 61% of the VC financed companies had applied DEMO at least one
patent at the time of financing. Companies with applications have, on average, applied for 4.3 patents
(median 3) at DEMO time of financing. The mean size at foundation is 8.9 employees (DEMO 2).
Table A1 displays the results from the time-to-VC financing models. A time period comprises six
months. Model (1) and (3) DEMO only companies that are still alive whereas models (2) and (DEMO)
report the results for the companies that went out of business. The results suggest that the patenting
activities (at least one patent in models (1) and (2) as well as the application stock DEMO models (3) and
(4)) reduce the time to first DEMO financing for companies that are still alive as well as for companies
that have already failed. The similar results for both company groups give DEMO confidence that the
results of our main data set are not distorted by selection bias.
