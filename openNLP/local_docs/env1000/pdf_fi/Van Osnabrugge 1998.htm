<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
research investigates the differences between experience private investors
('serial angels') in the UK, who have funded three or more unquoted ventures,
and their less experienced counterparts ('non-serial angels'). Using a
theoretical base and data on 141 business angels, this study tentatively
concludes that, relative to non-serial angels, serial angels may be less
concerned with agency risks and more concerned with market risks. In particular,
serial angels limit their investments more to (and conduct slightly more
research on) industry sectors in which they have personal experience, prefer
markets with less competition, choose to co-invest, are slightly less involved
in their investments, and are less concerned with the location of the venture.

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Internationally,
the economic importance of small entrepreneurial firms has been widely
recognized. In the US and other major industrial nations a transition has
occurred from decaying industrial economies to emerging entrepreneurial
economies (Wetzel, 1996). &quot;In the US, from 1979 to 1995, while Fortune 500
payrolls declined by over 4 million jobs, the entrepreneurial economy generated
over 24 million jobs. About seventy-five percent of these jobs were created by
fewer than 10% of small firms.&quot; (Freear, Sohl, &amp; Wetzel, 1997, p. 47)
Likewise in the UK, small firms are a major economic force and have been the
subject of some recent policy initiatives. But all small firms are not alike.
The small minority of firms that have such economic potential are entrepreneurial
ventures that can be distinguished from the others by their growth potential
rather than size. Because they have a vision of rapid growth of at least 20%
annually, they are able to attract external suppliers of equity capital (Wetzel
&amp; Freear, 1994). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Despite
their considerable potential, these entrepreneurial firms often have
difficulties obtaining outside equity capital. Because they are often in the
early stage of development and have little or no track record or collateral,
they are seen as risky investments by banks and other lending institutions
(Mason &amp; Harrison, 1996). For venture capital firms, these firms are also
unappealing since their funding requirements are well below the venture
capitalist's minimum investment threshold. Furthermore, they also require too
much active hand-holding, their returns are risky and uncertain, and any
foreseeable exit route at the time of investment is unlikely (Gupta &amp;
Sapienza, 1988; Norton, 1995). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Primarily
due to the reluctance of banks and venture capital firms to fund early-stage
entrepreneurial firms, an equity gap exists for their funding (Freear et al.,
1997; Mason, 1996a). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>The
Importance of Business Angels </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Business
angels (also known as private equity investors) are the primary source of
finance that is attempting to fill this equity gap (Coveney &amp; Moore, 1997;
Harrison &amp; Mason, 1996; Wetzel &amp; Freear, 1994). They are private
individuals who have substantial sums of finance available to fund
entrepreneurial firms. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>The
potential of business angels and the informal venture capital market is
enormous. They have been identified as the largest single source of risk
capital for entrepreneurial companies, far exceeding the venture capital
industry (Wetzel, 1993; Wetzel &amp; Freear, 1994; Mason &amp; Harrison, 1993).
In the US, it is estimated that business angels finance 30-40 times as many
firms as the institutional venture capital community (Gaston, 1989; Wetzel
&amp; Freear, 1994). Business angels invest around $10-20bn per annum in around
30,000 businesses, whereas venture capitalists fund around $3-4bn per annum in
around 3,000 businesses (Wetzel, 1996). Similarly in the UK, business angels
are estimated to invest about [pounds]2bn per annum in small entrepreneurial
firms, compared to about [pounds]1bn per annum for the institutional venture
capital market (Mason &amp; Harrison, 1992, 1993). However, more recent
research shows that the amount provided by business angels may be significantly
greater than these estimates (Van Osnabrugge, 1998; Stevenson &amp; Coveney,
1994). But, due to the invisibility of the business angel marketplace, these
are only 'ball park' estimates and should not be regarded as definitive (Freear
et al., 1997: Mason, 1996b). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>In
addition to the already greater influence of the informal venture capital market
over the formal venture capital market, business angels have even greater
unutilized finance potential than these figures suggest (Mason &amp; Harrison,
1993, Coveney &amp; Moore, 1997). Research shows that angels have up to three
times more capital available for investment than what they have already
invested, but what primarily restricts them is the availability of good
investment opportunities and the right policy incentives (Mason &amp; Harrison,
1993; Freear et al., 1997; Stevenson &amp; Coveney, 1994). Even though business
angels have substantial financial power, it is their hands-on involvement and
sharing of business expertise that makes them an especially valuable asset to
entrepreneurs (Wetzel, 1983). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Despite
their importance, business angels are still not fully understood. It is hoped
that through a greater understanding of the attitudes, behaviors, and
characteristics of business angels it may be possible to gain insights into
ways of harnessing some of their untapped potential so that this may aid the entrepreneurial
economy by putting these resources to work for entrepreneurs (Freear et al.,
1997). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>One
key conclusion that has emerged from previous research on business angels is
that they do not constitute a homogeneous group (Coveney &amp; Moore, 1997).
The remainder of this article will use theory and UK data to consider one of
the most important dimensions by which active angels differ - the number of
investments they make. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>The
Importance of Serial Angels </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>A
number of studies have researched this diversity and identified different types
of business angels (Stevenson &amp; Coveney, 1994; Kelly &amp; Hay, 1996a, b).
But despite this work, little is known about the characteristics and behaviors
of the most active segment of the business angels market - serial angels. These
investors differ from non-serial angels in that they have made three or more
investments in young unquoted companies, whereas the latter have made two or
less. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Although
serial angels represent a minority of business angels, they have a sizable
influence on entrepreneurial ventures and the market for entrepreneurial
finance and therefore, warrant further investigation. In particular, this
research study concentrates exclusively on serial angels for several reasons.
Firstly, in all likelihood, these investors probably account for a
disproportionately large percentage of actual investment activity (Kelly &amp;
Hay, 1996a, b). Secondly, gaining greater understanding of the most active
segment of the informal venture capital market may serve to stimulate
additional investment activity from relatively inactive investors (Kelly &amp;
Hay, 1996a, b). Thirdly, since serial investors are usually experienced
investors, it may be reasonable to suggest that experience effects may be
operating and thus we may be able to learn from them (Kelly &amp; Hay, 1996a,
b). In particular, the investment experience of serial investors may enable
them to: choose safer and better investment opportunities; negotiate a fair
investment deal more effectively; write better investment contracts; and
monitor less actively but still as effectively. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Thus
far, only one study has investigated serial angels and this was by means of an
exploratory study with eight investors (Kelly &amp; Hay, 1996a, b). Although
this exploratory study rendered some valuable insight into the topic, further
questions still remain. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>THEORETICAL
BACKGROUND </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Inherent
in the nature of small entrepreneurial firms is considerable uncertainty and risk
(Pettit &amp; Singer, 1985). Because small firms have a high failure rate,
highly uncertain growth potential, potential management problems that impose
additional monitoring costs, and provide risks that are not commensurate with
returns, they are often unattractive equity investments for investors
(Landstrom, 1992). In particular, when investing in a new venture, two primary
types of risk are evident: market risk and agency risk (Fiet, 1991; Hart,
1995). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Market
Risk and Agency Risk </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Market
risk is the degree of uncertainty associated with unforeseen competitive
conditions. This may depend on size, growth, accessibility of the market, and
on the existence of a market need (Fiet, 1991, 1995a, b). Although market risk
is not always directly observable, the following factors can serve as good
indicators: technical obsolescence; many competitors; many potentially new
competitors; many substitute products/services; weak customer demand for a
product or service; and market attractiveness (Fiet, 1995a, Porter, 1980).
Thus, the variables indicative of market risk mirror those presented by Michael
Porter in his five forces model for competitive advantage (Porter, 1980). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Agency
risk, however, is risk that is caused by the possibility of divergent interests
between fund providers and the entrepreneur running the firm (Jensen &amp;
Meckling, 1976; Fiet, 1995a). When the interests and incentives of the
entrepreneur differ from those of the fund providers (business angels), the
entrepreneur may be seen as making decisions that the business angels may not
believe are in their mutual interest (Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976; Fama &amp;
Jensen, 1983). Agency problems tend to arise particularly in small firms
because their levels of asymmetries of information, the differences in knowledge
available to entrepreneurs and outside equity providers, are greater. The
greater these asymmetries are, the easier it is for the entrepreneur to make
decisions to the detriment of the outside fund providers (Landstrom, 1992;
Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Controlling
Market Risk and Agency Risk </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>According
to classical finance theory, market risk, the risk associated with unforeseen
competitive conditions in the market and business environment, can be reduced
by holding a diversified portfolio of investments (Wagner &amp; Lau, 1971).
Doing so largely eliminates the unique risk of each investment, although the
systematic market risk of the portfolio will still be evident (Ross, 1978; Roll
&amp; Ross, 1994). Under this assumption, we might expect business angels to
prefer a portfolio of investments that is diversified across industry segments
and development stages (Gupta &amp; Sapienza, 1988). Holding such a portfolio
would significantly decrease the diversifiable market risk of each investment
opportunity and the investor's primary effort could then be spent on the
selection of investments (which complement the diversified nature of the
portfolio) rather than on active participation in these portfolio firms (which
may not be deemed to affect the portfolio returns) (Wagner &amp; Lau. 1971;
Kelly &amp; Hay, 1996b). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Conversely,
agency risk, which is largely dependent upon the divergent views between the
investor and the entrepreneur, may be reduced through two primary approaches:
1) formulating contractual agreements that align the incentives of the fund
provider with those of the entrepreneur: and 2) monitoring by the fund provider
(business angel) of the entrepreneur's activities and expenditures (Jensen
&amp; Meckling, 1976). These contracts (written or unwritten) usually specify
the rights of the entrepreneur, the performance criteria upon which the
entrepreneur will be evaluated, and the payoff functions they face (Fama &amp;
Jensen, 1983). The thoroughness of these contractual agreements, in turn,
determines the level of monitoring undertaken by the fund provider. Since
contracts can never incorporate all future contingencies (i.e. contracts are
never perfect), there will always be some degree of monitoring (Hart, 1995). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>In
addition to these two ways of reducing agency risk, the informal venture
capital literature suggests that business angels can limit their investments to
entrepreneurs or investment referrers, they know personally (Haar, Starr, &amp;
MacMillan, 1988; Harrison &amp; Mason, 1991; Landstrom 1990; Kelly &amp; Hay,
1996a, b). Unfortunately, in this study no direct information was acquired on
this particular aspect, especially because most of the business angels
interviewed for this study used a business introduction service to locate the
investment opportunity. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Clearly,
investors will try to reduce both market and agency risks by utilizing
information (general and deal-specific) and the expertise they have acquired
over the years. Fiet (1995a) suggests that the importance an investor may
attach to a particular type of risk could be inversely related to that
investor's ability and competence to control that type of risk. Therefore, it
is possible that the type of risk that an investor may evaluate more is the
risk that he/she wants to avoid. For example, if an investor has greater
ability in monitoring the entrepreneur, rather than in screening the market,
the investor may be less concerned about making an agency mistake because the
investor can structure the deal to protect himself from the risk, or the
investor can get more actively involved as a means of monitoring agency risks.
What this investor would have to avoid, however, would be committing to a deal
in an unattractive market in which he/she may have little control (Fiet,
1995a). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>In
this paper, this notion of risk controllability will, thus, be loosely linked
to the level of an investor's investment experience as a possible indication of
that investor's ability to control one type of risk better than another. In
particular, we may assume that serial angels have climbed further up the learning
curve (than non-serial angels), since they have made more unquoted investments.
They have, in all likelihood, experienced a few past losses and may now be less
naive and more realistic in the screening/due diligence and investment
processes. This idea of the benefit of experience is echoed by Wetzel who
states: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>the
intensity of an individual's interest in venture investing appears to be
dependent in part upon the investor's familiarity with the techniques of
successful venture investing, as well as upon the availability of opportunities
. . . . Learning the tricks of the trade takes time and time is scarce (Wetzel,
1987, p. 311). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>It
might also be assumed that, on average, serial business angels have more
experience in dealing with entrepreneurs and agency issues. This may make them
more adept at negotiating and formulating an investment deal that better aligns
the incentives of the entrepreneur with those of the serial investor. This
implies that they may have more control over, and are better able to regulate
agency issues contractually, rather than through active participation and
monitoring. This is similar to the behavior of venture capitalists, who
&quot;may worry less about agency risk because they are able to protect
themselves through the use of boilerplate contractual terms and conditions that
they append to each venture capital agreement&quot; (Fiet, 1995b, p. 556): This
issue of contract completeness has received little attention in previous
articles on agency theory and venture capital suppliers, but can certainly shed
more light on business angels. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Thus,
since serial angels may formulate better contracts to reduce agency risks and
have more experience in dealing with entrepreneurs and agency issues, we might
propose that they are (relative to non-serial angels) less concerned with
agency issues. Conversely, market risk is influenced by macroeconomic
variables, and therefore may be particularly challenging to control and
evaluate. Thus, with less agency concerns, serial angels may place more
emphasis on reducing market risks in the investment process. Indeed, in
interviews with angels, serial angels certainly appeared to stress market risk
issues more than their less experienced and more naive counterparts. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Serial
Angels' Greater Concern for Market Risk </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>To
reduce market risk, it was previously stated that diversification of
investments is a sound strategy. However, in the entrepreneurial environment,
research has shown that business angels (serial and non-serial) tend to invest
in non-diverse industry segments (Freear &amp; Wetzel, 1988, 1990; Aram, 1989;
Ehrlich, Noble, Moore, &amp; Weaver, 1994). This implies that they do not hold
a diversified investment portfolio, which could reduce market risk. Thus,
limiting their exposure to these risks is particularly paramount. Fortunately,
there are two other methods that serial angels, especially, may wish to employ
to reduce market risks. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>The
first method involves investing in market sectors in which the investor has
previous experience (Sullivan, 1991; Mason, Harrison, &amp; Chaloner, 1991;
Landstrom, 1993; Harrison &amp; Mason, 1991; Aram, 1989: Kelly &amp; Hay,
1996a, b). Supporting this notion, Fiet (1991, 1995a, b) suggests that business
angels may be more comfortable dealing with market risk (and more concerned
about agency risk) due to their previous experience in the industries in which
they have invested. Fiet also presents empirical evidence to support that
venture capitalists are more concerned with market risk than business angels in
general, who give more importance to agency risk. However, my research(1) has
found that venture capitalists (who are generally more concerned about market
rather than agency risk) tend to have significantly more experience than
business angels in the sectors in which they invest (p [less than] .001).
Therefore, I would like to argue that an investor's prior industry experience
may not necessarily indicate that the investor is less concerned (and more
comfortable dealing) with market risk (relative to agency risk), but that the
investor uses his/her prior industry experience to reduce the level of market
risk. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Based
on this and previous arguments, it is proposed that experienced investors may
be more concerned with controlling market risks by limiting investments to
sectors in which they have experience. Indeed, Harrison &amp; Mason (1992, p.
13) state that it is often the &quot;active investors in particular (who) have
a preference for investing in sectors or activities in which they have
experience.&quot; These investors may feel that their efforts are better
focused on deals in which they have an information and skill advantage (Norton,
1995). This idea is also supported by the authors of the only other specific
paper on serial investors, Kelly &amp; Hay (1996b), who found that: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>a
number of investors commented that they became somewhat more selective in the
subsequent investments they made after a negative event by investing in
industrial sectors in which they had direct experience and, more importantly,
by backing people known to them personally or to their syndicate partners (p.
171). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>A
second method a business angel may use to reduce market risks is to conduct
research in the market sectors in which he/she invests. Although it might be
argued that those with more experience in a sector will be less inclined to
conduct further research in it, I would like to contend that although two
ventures might be in the same industry sector, and thus have similar general
market risks, they will each have more unique risks within the market which
need to be investigated prior to investment (especially since angel investors
do not follow a diversification approach). In this sense, this research
proposes that, relative to non-serial angels, serial angels act more like
venture capitalists in their due diligence of risk. Like venture capitalists,
serial angels have less concern about agency risk factors (which they have
experience in controlling) and focus more on the preinvestment evaluation of
market factors. This is not to say that serial angels closely mirror venture capitalists
(in fact they still behave rather differently), but relative to non-serial
angels, serial angels place less emphasis and concern on agency factors and
more on market risk factors. based </p>

relative to non-serial angels, will now be given. </p>

Angels' Lesser Concern for Agency Risk </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>To
reduce agency risk. it has been stated that two possible approaches are
contract formulation and investment monitoring. In this section, it will be
shown more fully that due to the investment experience of serial angels, they
may have better command of these two risk-reduction methods and therefore may
be, compared to non-serial angels, less concerned about agency risk. This
argument will now be more fully analyzed for each risk-limiting approach. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>With
respect to contract formulation as a means of agency risk reduction, a notion
was proposed earlier that serial investors (with more unquoted investment
experience) are more thorough in their investment deal negotiation and
formulation. In all likelihood, their past investment experiences (both positive
and negative) have taught them to reduce their risks. This study's interview
results certainly indicate that most serial investors have experienced past
investment losses and (with their acquired investment experience) now prepare
more comprehensive contracts than nonserial angels. Conversely, some non-serial
investors mentioned that their investment contracts were basically a
&quot;friendly handshake.&quot; This finding is supported by Mason, Harrison,
and Allen (1995) who found that only 38% of business angels use professional
assistance, and in only 70% of investments was an investment agreement drawn
up. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>With
respect to monitoring as a means of risk reduction, serial investors may have
fewer incentives (than non-serial angels) to monitor closely. This is partly
because they may have better investment contracts but also because they have
more experience (and possibly more skill) in dealing with entrepreneurs of
unquoted companies, and therefore may be less concerned about possible agency
risks, compared to the less experienced non-serial angel. A number of
researchers also support the notion that there is a learning or experience
curve to the monitoring of portfolio firms (Norton, 1995; Ruhnka, Feldman,
&amp; Dean, 1992). Another explanation may be that because serial angels have
larger investment portfolios, and the time commitments required to actively
monitor each investment is large (Neiswander, 1985), it would be less likely
that they would have time to be actively involved in their unquoted
investments. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Based
on all the aforementioned assumptions, the following hypothesis is formulated: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>H3:
Serial investors are less actively involved in their unquoted investment
portfolio companies, compared to non-serial angels. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>With
less involvement, serial investors may prefer to co-invest as a means of risk
reduction. With more investor eyes on the entrepreneur, there is less need for
each individual investor to actively monitor. This leads us to the next
hypothesis: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>H4:
Compared to non-serial angels, serial angels prefer to co-invest more. </p>

the relationship between co-investing and monitoring may not be clean Kelly and

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>(i)t
is reasonable to suggest that it is not necessary for a given investor to be
actively involved with all the ventures in which he has invested, rather a
member(s) of the syndicate whose background is best suited to the task can
assume an active role while other members are only passively involved. (p. 164)
</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Although
this might seem plausible, it has the potential to create a free-rider problem.
This occurs when an individual shareholder does not have an incentive to
monitor management, since the gains from improved management are enjoyed by all
shareholders, whereas the costs are borne only by those who are active (Hart,
1995). One adverse result of this is that there may be less incentive for
individual fund providers to monitor the entrepreneur and this may reduce the
entrepreneur's constraints on pursuing his/her own goals (Hart, 1995). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>In
this article more emphasis is placed on the contractual agreements that serial
angels have formulated and their more limited time availability for monitoring
as more probable reasons for their less active monitoring. Since this study has
taken a more contractual view of the agency risk issue, this argument may be
classified more as a principal-agent research approach rather than the
positivist approach to agency theory (Landstrom, 1992; Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983;
Eisenhardt, 1989). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Building
on some of the assumptions already made, we might assume that if serial
investors are going to be less actively involved in their investments, they
will be less concerned with investing in ventures that are geographically
close. Indeed, many investors prefer to invest locally precisely because of
monitoring considerations (Mason et al., 1995). This allows the next hypothesis
to be formulated. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>H5:
With less active involvement in the venture, serial investors are less
concerned than non-serial angels about the geographical location of the firm
they are funding. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>In
the previous sections, the notion of unquoted investment experience and
experience curves was applied to the theoretical issues surrounding investment
risks. It has been assumed (primarily based on the interview findings and
theory) that greater experience in making unquoted investments has motivated
serial investors to take a more thorough approach to contract formulation and
thus a more &quot;laissez-faire&quot; approach to the active daily monitoring
of their investments, relative to non-serial angels. Since, thus far, it has
been assumed that greater unquoted investment experience has positive effects
on the investment process, we might also expect that these more experienced
serial investors may also have a higher rate of return on their investments. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>H6:
Because serial angels have more experience and expertise in making unquoted
investments, all other things being equal, we might expect them to have higher
rates of return on their investments compared to non-serial angels. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
relationship between experience and returns is discussed by Kelly and Hay
(1996b, p. 171) who ponder whether: &quot;(o)ver time, . . . an investor
enhance(s) his ability to identify 'winners'?&quot; Hopefully, this paper's
findings will shed more light on this issue. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>METHODOLOGY
</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Due
to the diverse, dispersed, and confidential nature of most business angel
investment transactions, it is extremely difficult for researchers to identify
these investors for research purposes (Wetzel, 1982). Their preference for
anonymity adds further challenge to the researcher's task. These difficulties
limit the researcher to four main methods for tackling this problem. Firstly,
the [TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 1 OMITTED] researcher can use a convenience or a
random sample of firms from a database and encourage them to provide information
on their informal investors (Aram, 1989; Freear &amp; Wetzel, 1990; Freear,
Sohl, &amp; Wetzel, 1994a). Secondly, a sample of high-net-worth individuals
can be identified from a database (such as those with mortgages above a certain
threshold) and these individuals can be targeted in the hopes that they have
made informal investments (Freear, Sohl, &amp; Wetzel, 1994b). Thirdly, since
business angels usually are closely connected to other angels, a snowball
technique can also be utilized to increase sample size (Wetzel, 1983).
Fourthly, with the help of business introduction services (BISs) - firms which
match entrepreneurs seeking funding with potential investors looking for
investment opportunities - business angels who subscribe to these services can
be targeted as a convenience sample. This last approach is not widely used in
the US, but is more commonly used in the UK (Mason &amp; Harrison, 1992;
Stevenson &amp; Coveney, 1994; Coveney &amp; Moore, 1997). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>For
this research study, the fourth approach was utilized to empirically test the
theoretically based hypotheses. Business angels were identified through their
membership with certain business introduction services, and those services made
initial contact with the angel to notify them of the research study. A
two-phased approach was then adopted for the data collection. In the first
phase, semi-structured and open-ended questions were administered in 25
personal interviews. At the end of each interview session, a quantitative
questionnaire was also administered. In the second phase, the first phase
interview responses were used to formulate a two-page postal questionnaire,
which enabled a larger sample to be targeted for greater generalization of the
results and as a means of triangulating the data findings. This questionnaire
contained a series of 5-point Likert-scale questions, which allowed respondent
to rate the attractiveness of particular features of their last investment, and
some short-answer questions. Thus, this approach ensured that the data
collected would be deal-specific and based on actual investments made rather
than on general investment preferences. Using a total of eleven business
introduction services around the UK, 252 active business angels (who had each
made an unquoted investment within the last three years) were targeted, for
[TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 2 OMITTED] a total response rate of 51%, and a total of
141 usable business angel responses. This response rate is much higher than
that received in other studies, which may be due to the shortness of the questionnaire
and the referral sources used. Using SPSS software, the quantitative data were
analyzed for statistically significant differences between the two investor
types. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>RESULTS
</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Using
the serial investor classification proposed by Kelly and Hay (1996a, b), the
total sample of business angels was divided into those who had made three or
more unquoted investments and those who had only invested in two or less. The
former were then considered, for the purpose of this research, to be serial
angels, and the latter, non-serial angels. Since dividing the data at three,
rather than four or five, 'unquoted investments made' might seem a bit
arbitrary, some correlation results (of the number of 'unquoted investments
made' with certain variables) will be presented throughout the results section
to show relationships that are evident regardless of the cutoff mark used for
subject classification. Unfortunately, this study does not consider the time
period over which these investments were made. This is recognized as another
potential variable that can be used for classification, and its omission here
may certainly be a limitation. Thus, out of the 141 angels in this study, 91
(65%) were considered to be serial investors and 50 (35%) non-serial investors.
On average, serial angels have made a total of 7.2 unquoted investments, while
non-serial angels only 1.5 investments (the median number is five and two
respectively). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Investors
Characteristics </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Due
to their propensity to invest in a larger number of firms, serial investors
might appear to be more entrepreneurial in their investment behavior than
non-serial investors. This is confirmed by statistical analysis, which shows
that serial angels have founded considerably more ventures as entrepreneurs
than non-serial angels. On average, serial angels have founded 3.04 firms while
non-serial angels have started 1.08 firms; the difference is statistically
significant (p [less than] .001). Running a correlation, across the total
sample, between 'the number of firms founded as an entrepreneur' and 'the
number of unquoted investments' produces a very strong correlation of
[.6490.sup.**].(2) One potential explanation of this result may be that a
number of respondents might have considered some of their unquoted investments
as entrepreneurial ventures. However, the question on the questionnaire was
clearly stated so as to ask for the number of businesses founded as an
entrepreneur, not those funded as an investor, although the potentially low
degree of care afforded to questionnaire completion by some respondents should
not be over-looked. This result is also supported by some previous research
that compared the characteristics of entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. One
of the conclusions of this work was that: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>there
is reason to believe that entrepreneurs who are investing in the business
venture of another tend to identify with the person and the process. This
identification with or empathy for a fellow entrepreneur may manifest itself in
more readily investing in earlier stage ventures and in making a greater number
of informal investments (Sullivan, 1991, p. 466). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Since
these more entrepreneurial (serial) investors have more empathy for the
entrepreneur and seem to understand him better, it may be possible to assume
that these investors worry less about the entrepreneur as a source of risk.
This would support the assertion made earlier that serial investors are less
concerned about agency risks and more about market risks, relative to their
more inexperienced counterparts. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Sector
Experience </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>During
the 25 interviews conducted with business angels it became clear that there is
a considerable learning curve when making unquoted investments. based on this
premise, Hypothesis 1 supposed that because serial angels have more experience
investing in risky unquoted firms (and are more likely to have experienced a
potential loss) they are more likely to restrict their unquoted investments to
industry sectors in which they have experience and understanding (and are more
comfortable investing in). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
hypothesis (H1) is supported by the empirical data. There is a statistically
significant difference between the amount of specific industry sector
experience that serials have, compared to non-serial investors, in the ventures
they funded (p [less than] .050). A correlation for the whole angel sample of
'the number of unquoted investments made' by 'investor experience of the
investee firm's industry sector' also showed a significant positive correlation
([.1875.sup.*]). Thus, compared to nonserial investors, serial investors have
more experience in the industry sector of the unquoted portfolio firms they
fund. This may also add some strength to the assertion that because serial
investors have more concern for market risk, compared to non-serial investors,
(and less concern for agency risk) they tend to reduce their potential market
risks by restricting their investments to sectors with which they are familiar.
However, this does not imply that serial angels have more concern for market
risk as they get more experience, but that due to their experience they have
less concern about agency risk, and so may be more able to focus on market
risk. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Sector
Research </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>In
the second hypothesis it was suggested that because serial investors are more
concerned about market risk than serial angels, they are also more likely to
conduct pre-investment research in the sector of the investee firm, relative to
non-serial angels. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
hypothesis (H2) is only partly supported by the empirical data. Serial, rather
than non-serial, investors were more likely to conduct pre-investment research
in the sector of a potential investee firm. Although this finding was not
significant at the 10% significance level, it was at the 12.6% level (p [less
than] .200). Compared to non-serial investors, serial investors might view
their greater inclination to invest in venture sectors they know (and
conducting more research in those sectors) as their most effective way of
reducing market risk. One researcher contends that business angels, in general,
may get frustrated in obtaining market risk information themselves and
substitute agency information for it, and thus rely on the entrepreneur to
evaluate market risk for them (Fiet, 1995b). Experienced business angels may
have discovered that such relationships do not always lead to a positive
outcome and may now feel more inclined to conduct the market research
themselves. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>The
empirical result presented here may offer very loose support to the assertion
that serial investors are more concerned with controlling market risks ex ante
investment than are non-serial angels. However, other data show that serial
angels are more attracted than non-serial angels to ventures in industries with
less competition (p [less than] .100). This may thus add slightly more support
to the notion that serial angels are more concerned about market risks. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Post-investment
Involvement </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>It
was suggested earlier that due to their more restricted time availability for
active participation (Kelly &amp; Hay, 1996b) and better investment contracts
to protect their interests in the investee firm (Norton, 1995; Hart, 1995),
serial business angels may be less inclined to get actively involved in their
investments. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
hypothesis (H3) is not supported by the empirical regression data but is given
weak support by the correlational data. Although the variable that measured an
'investor's desire for involvement' was not significantly different based upon
the cut-off for the classification set (i.e. those with [less than] 3 unquoted
investments are non-serial angels), there was a statistically significant
negative relationship across the whole angel sample for 'the number of unquoted
investments made' and 'desire for involvement' (correlation [-.1951.sup.*]). Likewise,
the degree to which investors actively monitor their investments did not
significantly differ for the two angel groups classified. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>However,
there was a statistically significant negative relationship across the angel
sample between 'the number of unquoted investments made' and 'the degree to
which the investor actively monitors the investment' (correlation
[-.1783.sup.*]). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>On
average, serial investors telephone their portfolio firms 7.1 times per month,
while nonserial angels call 9.1 times per month (p = .267). But when the degree
of telephone contact is considered across the non-serial investor population,
there is a strong negative relationship between 'telephone contact' and 'the
number of unquoted investments made' (correlation [-.3127.sub.*]). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Similarly,
the average number of visits per month for serial investors is 2.7 times per
month and 3.8 times per month for non-serial investors, which was not
significantly different (p = .209). But like the number of telephone calls per
month, there is a statistically significant negative relationship across the
non-serial angel sample between 'the number of unquoted investments made' and
'the number of visits per month' to the portfolio firm (correlation
[-.3127.sup.*]). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Although
the opportunity to get involved is rarely one of the most influential factors
that attracts investors, the empirical results do show, to some degree, that
serial angels are less involved in the monitoring of their unquoted portfolio
firms than non-serial angels. But, because serial angels have (by definition)
more ventures to monitor, we might expect that the amount of hands-on
monitoring will decrease with an increase in investments. But this does not
imply that serial angels' monitoring effectiveness also decreases, in fact, the
opposite may be true. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Preference
for Co-investing </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>In
addition to their greater industry sector experience and sector research,
serial investors might consider co-investing with other business angels as
another means of risk reduction. With more investments to cater to in their
investment portfolio, serial investors have less available time to monitor each
venture. Although they might have more developed investment contracts aligning
the actions of the entrepreneur with their own, one business angel stated that
&quot;the quality of the investment contract is only as good as the
business.&quot; With this in mind, serial investors may be prone to finding
other ways to reduce agency and market risks. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Co-investing
may render these more seasoned investors the knowledge that &quot;if two other
investors are investing in the firm, then it must be a good investment
opportunity.&quot; Thus, safety in numbers may be seen as a way to reduce
market risk due diligence, but also by having more coinvestors to monitor the
investment, agency risk may also be reduced. Past research in the US has shown
that over half the business angels prefer to co-invest, while it has been
suggested that UK business angels prefer to invest alone more than their US
counterparts (Freear et al., 1994). based on the belief that serial angels
might be slightly less active in monitoring the firm, it was hypothesised that
they might prefer to co-invest in order to share the monitoring responsibility.
</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
hypothesis (H4) is supported by the empirical data. Serial investors show a
significant preference over non-serial investors for co-investing (p [less
than] .050). When analysed across the whole angel sample, there is a strong
positive relationship between 'liking to co-invest' and 'the number of unquoted
investments made' (correlation [.1850.sup.*]). However, since hypothesis 3 did
not conclusively show that serial angels are less &quot;hands-on,&quot; an
additional explanation for the serial angel's greater preference for
co-investing, compared to the non-serial angel, may be due to the former's
greater opportunity to co-invest. Indeed, with more investment experience and
market familiarity, a serial angel may know more players in the market with
whom he/she might prefer to co-invest. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Geographical
Locality Preferences </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>With
greater unquoted investment experience, slightly less active involvement in
their investee firms, and more co-investing, serial investors may feel less
inclined to restrict their search for a good investment opportunity in their
local geographical area, whereas individual investors (not co-investing) seem
to have a preference for investments relatively close to home (Wetzel &amp;
Freear, 1994). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
hypothesis (H5) is supported by the empirical data. There is a statistically
significant difference between a serial investor's concern for investing
locally compared to that of the non-serial investor (p [less than]. 100). When
this is analyzed across the whole angel sample, there is a strong negative
relationship between 'the number of investments made' and 'the preference for
investing locally' ([-.1847.sup.*]). There is also a positive correlation for
'desire for involvement' and 'preference for a local venture' (correlation
[.3700.sup.**]). Forty-four percent of the serial angels indicated that the
location of the venture was a very important or important attraction, while
almost 60% of the nonserial angels thought so. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>One
explanation may be the lesser degree of active involvement by the serial angel
as his/her number of investments grows. A second explanation(3) may be that due
to the serial angel's greater level of investment activity, he/she will more
likely have saturated a local area in the search for suitable investment
opportunities and may search further away from home. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Returns
on Investment and Venture Performance </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Although
investment performance of small unquoted entrepreneurial ventures is dependent
upon many factors beyond the investor's and entrepreneur's control, all other
things being equal, one might expect that more experienced investors in these firms
will have greater expertise in making successful investments. Furthermore, the
past entrepreneurial experience of serial angels may imply that they &quot;have
acquired the kind of experience (street smarts) that it takes to start, manage
and harvest a successful entrepreneurial venture&quot; (Freear, Sohl, &amp;
Wetzel, 1992, p .379). Research on venture capitalists has shown that they have
an above average tendency to pick winners (Hall &amp; Hofer, 1993) - could this
be the case for serial angels too? </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
hypothesis (H6) is supported by the empirical data. When asked to list the
annual rate of return initially expected on the venture, serial investors
stated an average rate of 33%, while nonserial angels gave 22.9%, a difference
that is statistically significant (p [less than] .050). The median rates of
return initially expected are 20% and 30% respectively, adding further support
that serial angels appear to be more optimistic in their investment returns
than non-serial angels. These findings are relevant because little research has
been conducted on the returns from investing in the informal venture capital
market (Mason et al., 1995; Freear et al., 1997). When comparing the annual
rate of return that the business angels now expect (an average of 1.2 to 1.5
years since the investment for the serial and non-serial investors
respectively), the serial angels stated an average return of 29%, while the
non-serial angels stated an average return of 18%, a difference that is
statistically significant (p [less than] .200). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>However,
since the median returns are 17.5% and 20% respectively, it is clear that
serial angels have more investors at the high end of the return rate spectrum.
Thus, although serial angels do appear to have better-performing investments,
one must be careful not to firmly conclude that they make significantly larger
rates of return than non-serial angels. To actually realize these investment
returns, an investor must have an exit route. Comparing this criterion for the
two groups shows that 36% of the serial angels thought that identification of
an exit route before investment was essential, whereas it was only of similar
importance for 24% of the non-serial angels. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Whether
past investment (and possibly entrepreneurial) experience in unquoted companies
is responsible for the slightly higher returns for serial investors cannot be
determined, but it could certainly be the case that when investing in small,
risky, entrepreneurial ventures, experience may count. Past research has shown
that certain entrepreneurs are able to utilize experience gained from starting
previous ventures to enhance the survival chances of their businesses (Carter,
Williams, &amp; Reynolds, 1997). In this way, serial investors may also use
their past entrepreneurial experience to make better unquoted investments. A
second explanation may be that non-serial investors do not reduce risks (and
steer the venture) as actively, and with as much effect, as they might have
hoped when initially entering the investment. This suggestion is supported by
previous research: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>(p)erhaps
the most straightforward interpretation is that unsuccessful investors have an
inflated opinion of the value of their hands on contribution, whereas
successful investors recognise that the entrepreneur is in the driving seat and
hence an external investor's influence is, inevitably, relatively marginal to
the success or otherwise of the business. (Lumme, Mason, &amp; Suomi, 1996) </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Alternatively,
serial investors may just be more confident investors (as the larger sample of
firms in their portfolio shows) and therefore may be inherently more optimistic
about the realized returns they will receive, as may be shown by the high
correlation between 'initial returns expected' and 'returns now expected to
realize' (correlation [.5311.sup.*]). This is partly supported by a previous
study, which found that with regard to their investment practices,
&quot;entrepreneurs perceived their downside risk to be less&quot; than did
non-entrepreneurs (Sullivan, 1991). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>CONCLUSIONS
</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
is the first large-scale attempt to study the investment characteristics of the
most influential group of informal equity investors - serial angels. Due to the
exploratory nature of this study, and some of the inherent methodological
limitations, the results presented in this paper should not be considered as
firm conclusions, but rather as findings that can be used as building blocks
for future research. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Some
the empirical and theoretical findings on the differences between serial and
non-serial angels presented in this paper now follow. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Compared
to non-serial angels, serial angels: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>*
have founded more firms as entrepreneurs themselves. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>*

</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>*

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>*

higher rates of return. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>*

agency risks (than non-serial angels). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>[TABULAR
DATA FOR TABLE 3 OMITTED] </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>But
what main conclusion can be generated from these findings? The findings
presented in this paper may shed some light on the question: &quot;(to) what
extent does a 'play money' mentality set in whereby investors are prepared to
back ventures competing in an unfamiliar industry lead by an entrepreneur
unknown to them or to other investors in the deal?&quot; (Kelly &amp; Hay,
1996b, p. 171) The results presented in this paper indicate that with more unquoted
investment experience, business angels may take on less of a 'play money'
mentality because their past gains and losses on unquoted investments have
taught them to be less naive and potentially more careful with their financial
investments. One indication of this may be their greater propensity, than more
inexperienced investors, to invest in industry sectors in which they have prior
experience. For these more experienced serial investors, the market risks may
seem less controllable than agency risks, and may therefore take on a greater
importance in the investment process. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>IMPLICATIONS
</p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>As
the most influential private investors in small entrepreneurial firms, serial
business angels need to be understood better to determine what attracts this
segment of the informal capital market to invest so frequently. Although both
serial and non-serial angels invest similar amounts on average per unquoted
investment (in this study, each group invested an average of [pounds]55,000),
serial investors make a greater number of investments and therefore have a much
greater economic impact than any other informal investor type. The research
findings presented in this study may have beneficial implications for
entrepreneurs, business angels, business introduction services, and policy. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Entrepreneurs
may benefit from this research by gaining greater understanding of how serial
angels assess an investment proposal and behave as investors. In addition,
having a better understanding of the different types of business angels allows
entrepreneurs to assess which investor will best match their firm's needs and
enable them to specifically target that angel type. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Business
angels may also benefit from this research by learning &quot;the tricks of the
trade&quot;; better knowledge of the investment behavior of experienced
investors can be of great benefit to more inexperienced angels who want to
learn (Riding, Dalcin, Druxbury, Haines, &amp; Safrate, 1993). The comparison
of non-serial with serial angel, may highlight some important areas of potential
improvement for both angel types, but especially for the more inexperienced
non-serial angel. A greater understanding of serial and non-serial investor
behavior and preferences may also shed more light on how to motivate virgin
angels. These are individuals with an inclination and enough discretionary
wealth to fund an entrepreneurial firm, but who have not yet done so. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Business
introduction services may use this research to gain a better understanding of
how the most active segments of business angels differ, especially in respect
to their initial review procedures and preferences. This will provide valuable
information to them on the types of information they should include, or not
include, in their investment databases, and the ordering and layout of their
materials (Mason &amp; Harrison, 1994). Information on business angel behavior
can also identify areas where these investors need assistance, so that these
needs can be better met by the services offered by the business introduction
service (Mason et al., 1995). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Policy
to promote entrepreneurial ventures and their procurement of financial backing
may also benefit from this research. A better understanding of the informal
venture capital market may allow policy to be better formulated, with
potentially more success. Although the UK has led the way in policy initiatives
(Freear et al., 1997), it has been pointed out that, thus far, policy may be
running ahead of knowledge (Mason, 1996a). </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>DIRECTIONS
FOR FUTURE RESEARCH </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Although
in this study qualitative data from the 25 personal interviews was used to
enlighten the quantitative findings, a number of facets were not fully explored
across the rest of the respondents. One of these facets was the degree to which
the investor has prior knowledge of the entrepreneur (Kelly &amp; Hay, 1996a,
b). Future studies may want to investigate this closer and link it with the
general findings presented in this paper. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>This
paper also suggests that serial investors, relative to their non-serial angel
counterparts, may place more weight on market risks than agency risks in the
investment evaluation process. Although this was based on a theoretical
overview and circumstantial empirical evidence, these possible relationships
need to be explored more fully. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Likewise,
this paper has shown that serial investors have higher initial expected rates
of return and higher expected realized rates of return than those of non-serial
investors. Whether this is due to their better knowledge and experience of
investing in (and starting) unquoted investments, or whether this is due to
greater optimism by the average serial angel, also needs to be further
explored. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Throughout
this paper, certain assumptions were formulated based upon the greater unquoted
investment experience of serial angels relative to that of non-serial angels.
Although the interviews conducted clearly showed that there is a steep learning
curve when making business angel investments, there is uncertainty as to when
this curve starts to even out and if it differs greatly depending upon the
investor's industry background or industry sector preferences. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>One
of the most interesting findings from this research was that serial investors
have a preference for co-investing. This is an important aspect of business
angel investing that needs to be investigated further. Kelly and Hay (1996b)
echo this sentiment: </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>(a)
clear need also exists to examine issues related to investment syndication and
co-investment activity. If the most active segment of the population
disproportionately invests as part of a group, it is imperative to understand
the dynamics of syndication. (p.172) </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Closely
related to the issue of co-investment is the issue of geographical location and
how a preference for local investing differs depending upon the level of investment
activity and co-investment. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>Lastly,
although a theoretical background supports this research, there is little
application of theory to the study of informal venture capital (Freear et al.,
1997). Unlike past theoretical approaches (Fiet 1991, 1995a, 1995b; Landstrom,
1992), this paper alludes to the quality of investment contracts as one
possible manner of reducing potential agency costs. A more definitive study of
the relationship between the completeness of investment contracts and an
investor's business angel experience may add more support to the principal
assertions made in this paper, which, with respect to this issue, were heavily
based upon the data from the business angel interviews. One goal of this paper
is to forward this issue of contract incompleteness for consideration and
further examination in the business angel context. </p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0cm'>1.
The research finding is discussed more fully in a forthcoming paper. </p>
