Introduction
The voyage of spacecraft to the moon in the late 1960s and early 70s brought back an image of
the living Earth against the lifeless cold blackness of outer space. It was the unintended cargo of
those voyages: intending to revolutionize our views of the moon, the voyages instead
revolutionized our views of the Earth. It still hangs on bedroom walls, is pasted on refrigerators
and on the bumpers of SUVs, and enlivens the covers of annual reports by multinational
corporations. A symbol of all things green, it nevertheless ushers us into paradoxes. For to get
that picture required what was until then the most stupendous technological achievement of
modern times, and was driven by the military and propaganda needs of the Cold War between
the United States and Russia.
Figures and Grounds; Problems and Mysteries
But the image is even more iconic and mysterious than that. At first glance, it appears a lonely
image -- devoid of human reference, at least when seen from the distance of the moon. Yet the
nagging question is: Where are we in this picture? The easy answer is that we are in there
somewhere, maybe waving or drowning. More intriguing is the answer that we are the picture -that it took all of science and technology to get us to the point where we could take such a
picture, and all of the arts and history to get us to the point where a human being thought it
would be a good idea to take such a picture.
The Canadian literary critic, Marshall McLuhan, made a typically prophetic remark in 1970,
when he said:
whereas the planet had been the ground for the human population as figure; since
Sputnik, the planet has become figure and the satellite surround has become the new
ground....Once it is contained within a human environment, Nature yields its primacy to Art.
Here McLuhan invokes the classic “figure-ground” reversal, where faces turn into vases and
back again, or ducks into rabbits and back again. This perceptual shift, as he says, now means
that the Earth is emerging as a human work-of-art. Before now, human beings were the
creations of the Earth; we are beginning to take over that role partly because of our increasing
power over parts of the biosphere, our ability to affect natural systems, but more significantly
because now that we can grasp the Earth in our mind’s eye, we increasingly see that we have it
in our grasp, period.
This encroachment on the Earth and its systems has been a long time coming, though human
beings have affected substantive parts of the Earth before (for example, in processes of
desertification and in the extinction of large mammals at the end of the last Ice Age); but we

<-----Page 1----->have begun something on a scale so new and so massive in its scope and implications that it
should completely alter our ways of thinking, doing, and being.
I have been exploring recent suggestions about this need to alter our ways, and in this context I
find it useful to distinguish between “problems” and “mysteries” -- taking up a suggestion made
long ago by the French philosopher Gabriel Marcel.
A “problem” is something that is in front of us, placed or thrown in our path to solve (the
original Greek word, problemata, means “that which is thrown in front”). Students are
constantly faced with problems on exams, and “problem-solving” is essential to our
technological way of life. These are things that are in theory or in practice solveable, if we can
come up with a solution.
Different from this is a “mystery”. A mystery is a problem that, as one begins to try and solve it,
starts to involve the solver, begins to implicate the solver, to the point where the solver is so
involved, so woven into the problem, that he or she can no longer pretend to stand aside from it
and take a neutral stance. To solve a mystery one must often solve oneself. A couple of
examples must suffice here: sex is a problem; love is a mystery. Other people have “problem
children” ; why one’s own children act the way they do is a mystery that calls into question
everything a parent has and is.
The distinction between “problems” and “mysteries” seems to me to hold quite well for the
evolution of the modern environmental movement, which was characterised until the last few
years with solving problems. These problems -- smog, industrial pollution, strip mining,
chemical waste -- were of a size and scale that with political will, money, and engineering, they
could often be quickly solved, and the impacts reversed. Many of these were what
environmentalists call “point-source” pollutants: the place, people, company, whatever, who
were doing these things could be pointed out and stopped. But beginning in the 1980’s and
accelerating since then, we have been confronted with issues and contexts that have involved
longer time scales (e.g. climate change), possible irreversible losses (e.g. loss of species), and
problems that could not be automatically attributed to individual industries or culprits. These
were not “point-source” problems, but “non-point source” problems, where the finger points at
everyone -- entire dynamic processes of modern society, life styles, and perhaps the very burden
of the human presence on the earth. When the finger points at everyone, it points at us, and
moves into the realm of mystery.
I believe that the problem-solving component still predominates in environmental action;
however, we now increasingly find ourselves having to deal with issues of environnmental
ethics: what ought we to do? what are our responsibilities to ourselves and other members of the
planet? Who are we?
The Deepening Mystery
We can see this shift from problems into mysteries in many domains, of which perhaps the most
interesting is the way in which many natural scientists, whose whole training has been in neutral
observation now find that they must get out of the laboratory in order to ensure the continuing

<-----Page 2----->existence of their own research subjects. More and more, the most eminent scientists, botanists,
naturalists, ecologists and others are pleading for assistance for species and the preservation of
the fabric of the natural world in the face of the human onslaught. Extraordinary innovations in
the mobilization of science can be found everywhere, of which perhaps the most obviously
influential are the scientific reports that underpin the Conventions on the Protection of the Ozone
Layer and the Climate Convention (to which the Kyoto Protocol is the working blueprint).
Without the urging -- and presentation of fact -- by the scientific community, neither of these
global agreements would have been achieved.
These two global agreements highlight the most unsettling aspect of our emerging situation,
which is the arrival of a series of what I call “ontological assaults” -- assaults that attack the
fabric of being ( “ontos” is the Greek word for “being”), the fabric of life itself, like someone
slashing at a canvas. An early sign of this was the discovery that mother’s milk was a carrier of
radioactivity from above ground nuclear testing in the 1950’s and 60’s; and later we were
confronted with acid rain -- the discovery that something as beautiful as rain could actually be
poisoning lakes and rivers. These are only two examples of the terrifying idea that things so
familiar and so symbolic of nourishment and health could become carriers of death. The
destruction of species is another kind of example of an ontological disturbance. The tigers,
elephants, butterflies, and other creatures that are on their way to being irretrievably lost seemed
to be part of an assumed basic furniture. Their loss leaves a gap in the world: as the writer Paul
Aird once said, it is like walking down a basement staircase in the dark, and finding a step
missing. Similarly, ozone depletion -- punching a hole in the ozone layer -- threatens a human
right so basic that no one ever thought before that it needed defending: the right for you to go out
into the sun on a nice summer’s day without worry.
Global warming threatens the rhythm of the seasons; genetic engineering threatens to mix up
fireflies and tobacco plants, and so on. The ground erodes out from under us. It is true that the
earth’s environment is always changing: but it is the rate and dimensions of the change that are
of immediate concern. Also that it is our fault: it is not natural processes that are doing these
things, it is humanity.
This sense of uncertainty, of anxiety is a sign of the shift from problems to mysteries. It is an
expression of the puzzle we must solve of where we are to stand in relation to the Earth if we are
to survive. Is the Earth to continue to be seen as external to us, a problem to be managed from
“on high” -- now with the help of satellites -- from the same elevation that used to be God’s eye
view on the Earth, but which we are now usurping? Are we to continue to bring it under that
neutral and neutralizing gaze that has made science and technology so successful until now? If
that is the trajectory of our “problem-solving”, then we are faced with one last “problem”, the
problem of human beings.
For we are now seeing the encroachment of problem solving onto ourselves through the
prospects for biotechnological innovation and the redesign of us. The unlocking of the
biological codes to life has brought a further, internal, dimension to the current project of
“managing the biosphere”. It may be that the ironic, ultimate aim of this project is to finally
solve the “problem” of humanity by stamping out all the mystery of it. But then the questions
are more demanding: Why? What for? What kinds of beings do we want to create? What is

<-----Page 3----->wrong with us that we wish to make better? Are we only a stepping stone to a better creature?
What is our goal? So even the ultimate problems are shadowed by deeper mysteries.
Conclusion
We have reached a turning point in human and Earth history, where we are faced with ultimate
choices and deep issues. For environmentalists, these issues invade and saturate our work and
our practice. As global change forces us to take more and more account of our own stance
towards the Earth, the arts and the humanities become proportionately more important, and their
relationship to the sciences of the Earth changes as well. The facts affect us; we affect the facts.
How are we to position ourselves in this situation? The environmental movement speaks
sometimes of “shallow ecologies” (which are essentially problem solving strategies), and
sometimes of “deep ecologies” (the stance of mystery involving strategies). We lack what
might be called a “middle ecology” -- after the Buddhist “middle way” -- where we live in the
creative tension of our curious borderline existence as human beings, where we are able to flip
inside and outside of ourselves as figures and as grounds, where we are both outside and inside
our environment, thanks to the mystery of consciousness in a physical body.
It is the creative tension of this border existence that is the place that environmentalists inhabit,
as we wrestle with the paradoxes of inside and outside, of problem and mystery, of figure and
ground. But central to the environmental movement in our time is our orientation towards the
great issue: that while we are sometimes merely figures on a global ground, we are more and
more emerging as a ground that figures globally.
