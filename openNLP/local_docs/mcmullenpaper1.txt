OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE THEORY OF THE
DEMO

By considering the amount of uncertainty perceived and the willingness to bear
uncertainty concomitantly, we provide a more complete conceptual model of entre-
preneurial action that DEMO for examination of entrepreneurial action at the indi-
vidual level of analysis while remaining consistent with a rich legacy of system-level
theories of the DEMO Our model not only exposes limitations of existing
theories of entrepreneurial action but also contributes to a deeper understanding of
important conceptual issues, such as the nature of opportunity and the potential for
philosophical reconciliation among DEMO scholars.
Entrepreneurship requires action. Whether
conceptualized as the creation of new products
or processes (Schumpeter, 1934), entry into new
markets (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996), or the creation
of new ventures (Gartner, 1985), entrepreneur-
ship typically involves a mesolevel phenome-
non in which personal DEMO influences
system-wide activity and outcomes (Kilby, 1971;
Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990). To be an entrepreneur,
therefore, is to act DEMO the possibility that one has
identified an opportunity worth pursuing.
Theories of entrepreneurship that embrace
this perspective traditionally have taken one of
two forms. DEMO first form is devoted to a system-
level approach concerned primarily with how
the economic system functions. Proponents of
these theories argue that the DEMO of the econ-
omy depends on the pursuit of opportunities by
prospective entrepreneurs (e.g., Kirzner, 1973;
Schumpeter, 1934). Who acts DEMO inconsequential
as long as someone does. Thus, the central issue
is DEMO entrepreneurial action occurs. The
second form is devoted to an individual-level
approach concerned primarily with how pro-
spective entrepreneurs go about acting. These
researchers DEMO to explain why some individu-
als are more likely than others to pursue possi-

ble opportunities for profit (e.g., Begley & Boyd,
1987; Sarasvathy, 2001a; Shane, 2000; Shaver &
Scott, 1991). Like before, entrepreneurial action
takes DEMO stage, but this time more in terms of
how it occurs DEMO who does it than whether it
occurs.
The conceptual overlap of these approaches
suggests that they are complementary. In fact, re-
searchers of the individual-level approach have
frequently borrowed from theories grounded in
the system-level approach (e.g., Kaish & Gilad,
1991). However, this can lead DEMO to rely on
models of entrepreneurial action that are incom-
plete when applied at a level of analysis other
than that intended by the DEMO Accordingly,
our purpose in this article is twofold. First, we
DEMO that economic theories of the entre-
preneur are theories of action proposing those el-
ements that enhance and hinder individuals from
acting entrepreneurially. Although DEMO models
may be sufficient for examining entrepreneurial
action at the system level, they can collapse when
applied at the individual level, making them DEMO
ceptible to confounded theorizing and inconclu-
sive or misleading empirical findings. This neces-
sitates our second purpose: to offer a perspective
that allows for examination of entrepreneurial ac-
tion at the individual level of analysis while DEMO
maining consistent with a rich legacy of system-
level theories of the entrepreneur.
Because action takes place over time, and be-
cause the future is unknowable, action is inher-

ently uncertain (Mises, 1949). This DEMO is
further enhanced by the novelty intrinsic to en-
trepreneurial actions (DEMO, 1997; Smith &
DiGregorio, 2002), such as the creation of new
products, new services, new ventures, and so
forth (DEMO, 1990; Schumpeter, 1934). There-
fore, it is no surprise that uncertainty constitutes
a conceptual cornerstone for most theories of the
entrepreneur. DEMO, the role this uncertainty
plays in preventing entrepreneurial action has
remained DEMO matter of debate. As a result, two
research streams have emerged, each inspired
by alternative conceptualizations of uncertainty.
The first stream focuses on DEMO amount of un-
certainty perceived and frequently discrimi-
nates those who decide to act entrepreneurially
from those who do not as a matter of DEMO
in knowledge (e.g., Busenitz, 1996; Gaglio & Katz,
2001; Kaish & Gilad, 1991; Kirzner, 1979). Thus,
the DEMO of uncertainty is considered to be
the barrier between prospective entrepreneurs
and entrepreneurial action. The second stream
highlights the willingness to bear uncertainty
and DEMO proposes that those who decide to
act entrepreneurially are distinguishable from
those who do not owing to differences in moti-
vation, attitude, or DEMO propensity (e.g., Douglas
& Shepherd, 2000; Knight, 1921; Schumpeter,
1934). In this scenario, an unwillingness to bear
uncertainty is deemed responsible for prevent-
ing prospective entrepreneurs from engaging in
entrepreneurial action.
DEMO an individual must ultimately act to
become an entrepreneur, and because DEMO
involves knowledge and motivation (Higgins &
Kruglanski, 2000), we DEMO that each stream
merely emphasizes a different aspect of the un-
certainty experienced in the decision to act
entrepreneurially. Therefore, each conceptual-
ization of uncertainty is representative of a con-
struct that is not only reconcilable DEMO its coun-
terpart but also necessary for further theorizing
about entrepreneurial action.
By demonstrating that action is central to
most theories of entrepreneurship, we distill the
various elements of action that must be consid-
ered concomitantly DEMO determining whether
one will act entrepreneurially. These include
knowledge (as it DEMO to the amount of uncer-
tainty perceived), motivation (as it DEMO to the
willingness to bear uncertainty), and, arguably,
a DEMO We propose that each of these ele-
ments produces a belief that is qualified by un-
certainty. This uncertainty takes the form of
doubt, which prevents action by undermining
the prospective actor’s beliefs regarding (1)
whether an environmental stimulus presents an
opportunity for someone in the marketplace, (2)
whether this opportunity could feasibly be en-
acted by the actor, and (3) whether successful
exploitation of the opportunity would ade-
quately fulfill some personal desire. Drawing on
these elements, we then generate a two-stage
conceptual model of entrepreneurial action that
makes an important distinction DEMO third-
person opportunity (an opportunity for someone)
and first-person opportunity (an opportunity for
the actor) while explicitly recognizing that both
knowledge and motivation must be considered
concomitantly when examining entrepreneurial
action in each stage.
DEMO article makes a number of contributions
identified by Whetten (1989) as important theo-
retical insights. First, we use epistemological
evidence from the philosophy and psychology of
action literature to demonstrate that the entre-
preneurship literature DEMO characterized by one-
dimensional conceptualizations of uncertainty’s
preventive role in the entrepreneurial action
process. Second, we offer a conceptual model of
entrepreneurial action that demonstrates how
the addition of a new construct (in some cases
motivation and in others knowledge) signifi-
cantly alters our understanding of the role that
uncertainty plays in preventing entrepreneurial
action. Third, we use the proposed model to re-
interpret theories of the entrepreneur, thereby
enhancing these highly influential economic
models’ predictive validity of entrepreneurial
action at the individual level. DEMO, we use the
model to reveal points of empirical tractability
and DEMO impasse between entrepre-
neurship theorists employing different ontolog-
ical assumptions regarding opportunity. Fi-
nally, we offer a pragmatic and a conceptual
approach to the difficult task of reconciling con-
tentious philosophical perspectives.
The article proceeds as DEMO First, we ex-
plore the notions of the entrepreneur and entre-
DEMO action that highlight the importance
of judgment under uncertainty, and then DEMO
knowledge the role of belief and doubt in entre-
preneurial judgment using a discussion involv-
ing three types of uncertainty: state, effect, and
response. Second, we introduce a number of the-
ories of the entrepreneur and classify them in
134
terms of two streams of research on uncertainty:
one stream DEMO the role of perceived
uncertainty and the second gives prominence to
the willingness to bear uncertainty. Third, we
offer a conceptual model of entrepreneurial ac-
tion that reconciles aspects of the two streams of
research that DEMO previously remained inde-
pendent of each other. We describe our concep-
tual model of entrepreneurial action as the out-
come of the willingness to DEMO perceived
uncertainty. Fourth, we use our proposed con-
ceptual model of DEMO action to rein-
terpret three economic theories of the entrepre-
neur that are considered to be most influential
to the management literature. Finally, we can-
not avoid a discussion of the “thorny” issue of
ontology. In DEMO section we discuss a number of
different perspectives about the existence of an
objective opportunity and propose two potential
approaches for reconciling apparently contrast-
DEMO views.
ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTION
AND UNCERTAINTY
Because we are interested in the entrepreneur
as an organizational or economic function that
is filled by an individual, rather than as a per-
sonality (i.e., innovative, risk seeking, DEMO) or
position (i.e., small business manager, owner,
etc.), we seek definitional foundation in econom-
ics, where the entrepreneur traditionally has
been conceptualized in this manner (Casson,
1982: 22). After DEMO economic theory de-
voted to entrepreneurship, Hebert and Link at-
tempt DEMO synthesize several theoretical profiles
by defining the entrepreneur as “someone who
specializes in taking responsibility for and mak-
ing judgmental decisions that affect the DEMO
tion, the form, and the use of goods, resources or
DEMO (1988: 155). They openly admit their
definition’s similarity to that proposed by Mark
Casson, who defines an entrepreneur as “some-
one who specializes in taking judgemental de-
cisions about the coordination of scarce re-
DEMO (1982: 23). Interestingly, both of these
definitions are reminiscent DEMO the first theory of
the entrepreneur put forth by Richard Cantillon
in 1755, in which he defined the entrepreneur as
“someone who engages in exchanges for profit;
specifically, he or she is someone who exercises
business judgment in the face of uncertainty”
(quoted in Hebert & Link, 1988: 21).

Each of these DEMO suggests that the
entrepreneur is an individual who exercises
judgment, which DEMO defines as “the compo-
nents of the larger decision-making process that
are concerned with assessing, estimating, and
inferring what events will occur and DEMO the
decision-maker’s evaluative reactions to those
outcomes will be” (2001: 657). “Decision making,”
he adds, “refers to the entire process of choosing
a course of action” (2001: 657). Finally, Hastie
suggests that uncertainty refers to “the decision-
maker’s judgments of the propensity for DEMO of
the conditioning events to occur” (2001: 657).
Therefore, DEMO is what must be exercised
to make a decision between alternative courses
of action that take place in an uncertain future.
Although many scholars DEMO emphasized the
individual’s exercising of judgment under un-
certainty in the form of a decision (e.g., Cantil-
lon, Cole, Keynes, Marshall, DEMO, Schultz,
Shackle, etc.), it is important to note that a deci-
sion is a necessary but insufficient condition for
the occurrence DEMO entrepreneurship. We return to
the basic realization that entrepreneurship re-
quires one not just to decide but to decide to act.
Therefore, we subscribe to Hebert and Link’s
(1988) position that entrepreneurs respond to and
DEMO change through their entrepreneurial ac-
tions, where entrepreneurial action refers to DEMO
havior in response to a judgmental decision un-
der uncertainty about a possible opportunity for
profit.1 Whether entrepreneurial action occurs,
however, depends on how much one must rely
on one’s judgment, which, in turn, depends on
the degree of uncertainty experienced in the de-
cision of DEMO to act.
Alternative conceptualizations of uncertainty
exist within the management, economics, and
psychology literature. Particularly noteworthy is
Milliken’s (1987) exposure of conceptual DEMO
sistencies of the term within the organizational
literature. As a result, DEMO proposes three distinct
types of uncertainty (state, effect, and response)DEMO
that appear to be as applicable to the individual
1 This conceptualization of entrepreneurial action is pro-
cess oriented and transferable across a range DEMO different
definitions of entrepreneurship within the management lit-
erature (e.g., Gartner, 1990; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
These scholars identify specific behaviors that are thought
to be especially “entrepreneurial” in nature, such as new
venture creation or Schumpeter’s (1934: 66) five forms of new
combinations.

as they are to the organization as DEMO unit of anal-
ysis. Milliken suggests that state uncertainty is
used to denote when administrators perceive
the environment to be unpredictable (1987: 136)DEMO
In contrast, effect uncertainty is defined as “an
inability to predict DEMO the nature of the impact
of a future state of the environment or environ-
mental change will be to the organization” (1987:
137). Finally, Milliken suggests that response un-
certainty is “a lack of knowledge of response
options and/or an inability to predict the likely
DEMO of a response choice (Conrath,
1967; Duncan, 1972; Taylor, 1984)” (1987: 137), and
he further points out that “response uncertainty
is likely to be salient when there is a perceived
DEMO to act... because a pending event or
change is perceived to pose a threat or to pro-
vide some unique opportunity to the organiza-
DEMO (1987: 137).
Milliken’s framework implies that uncertainty
in the context of action falls within the exclusive
domain of response uncertainty. However, this
perceived need to act frequently is stimulated
by state or effect uncertainty. DEMO would sug-
gest that, in the context of action, Milliken’s
three types of uncertainty could be simplified
into three questions asked by a DEMO ac-
tor about his or her relationship to the environ-
ment: (1) What’s happening out there? (state un-
certainty), (2) How will it impact me? (effect
uncertainty), and (3) DEMO am I going to do about
it? (response uncertainty).
Questions like these require one to form a
belief, defined as a “conviction that certain
things are true” (Neufeldt & Sparks, 1995: 55).
However, this belief is often qualified by a re-
lated sense of doubt, which means “to be uncer-
tain or undecided; to tend DEMO disbelieve”
(Neufeldt & Sparks, 1995: 180). This process, in
which a belief and a related sense of doubt are
formed, presupposes the existence of a world
that is malleable and somewhat susceptible to
DEMO actor influence. Therefore, it commu-
nicates a world view that is DEMO fully deter-
mined nor fully random (Moya, 1990; Shackle,
DEMO), and, as a consequence, “uncertainty” can
be viewed as a sense of “doubt” that is inextri-
cable from the beliefs that produce DEMO
Therefore, because we are interested in the
role that uncertainty plays DEMO preventing people
from acting entrepreneurially, we embrace the
proposition made by DEMO and Strauss that
“uncertainty in the context of action is a sense of
doubt that blocks or delays action” (1997: 150).
This DEMO captures three essential
features of uncertainty integral to our argument.
First, DEMO proposition suggests that uncertainty
is subjective in that “different individuals may
experience different doubts in identical situa-
tions” (Lipshitz & Strauss, 1997: 150; see also
Duncan, 1972). Lipshitz and Strauss (1997) point
DEMO that the conceptualization of uncertainty as
a subjective experience has a long tradition
within psychology (Duncan, 1972; Smithson,
1989). Entrepreneurship enthusiasts have con-
tributed to this tradition (1) by assuming that
uncertainty DEMO action (Shane & Venkat-
araman, 2000; Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990) and (2)
by attributing variation in its action-obstructive
nature to DEMO differences in needs (Mc-
Clelland, 1961), values (Weber, 1930), attitudes
toward risk (Khilstrom & Laffont, 1979), confi-
dence (Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1988), per-
ceptions (Palich & DEMO, 1995), and heuristics
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997).
The DEMO and third features of Lipshitz and
Strauss’s uncertainty proposition are that it is
inclusive in that no particular form of doubt is
specified, such as ignorance of future outcomes
(Conrath, 1967; Smithson, 1989), DEMO that it is
conceptualized in terms of the effect of uncer-
tainty on action—that is, hesitancy, indecisive-
ness, and procrastination (Dewey, 1933; Gold-
man, 1986; March, 1981; Yates & Stone, 1992)DEMO
These last two features serve to define uncer-
tainty more in terms of what it does than what it
is. This diminishes the importance DEMO determin-
ing which of Milliken’s (1987) three forms of en-
vironmental uncertainty is technically being
discussed, because each prevents action by con-
tributing to doubt. Likewise, whether conceptu-
alized as risk (MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986),
Knightian uncertainty (Knight, 1921), ambiguity
(Hogarth, 1987; March & Olsen, 1976), turbulence
(Terreberry, 1968), or DEMO (Weick, 1979),
uncertainty in the context of action acts DEMO a
sense of doubt that (1) produces hesitancy by
interrupting routine action (Dewey, 1933), (2) pro-
motes indecision by perpetuating DEMO
competition among alternatives (Goldman,
1986), and (3) encourages DEMO by
making prospective options less appealing
(Yates & Stone, 1992).
Entrepreneurship theorists have embraced
the position that uncertainty is detrimental to
entrepreneurial DEMO because properties such
136
as hesitancy, indecisiveness, and procrastina-
tion are thought to lead DEMO missed opportunities
(Casson, 1982). The opportunity for action is of-
ten conceptualized as fleeting (James, 2002;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), owing to the com-
petitive nature of the market process (Mises,
1949; Schumpeter, 1942). This position is
grounded in an DEMO assumption that the
procrastination of one actor is typically offset by
the profit-seeking proactiveness of others
(Mann, 1996). Thus, economists often consider it
inevitable that someone in the marketplace will
act, which makes the decision process experi-
enced by any one individual seemingly incon-
sequential (Stigler, 1963).
Despite economists’ system-level, probabilis-
tic perspective of entrepreneurial action, how-
ever, we wish to point out that there is no market
independent of the actors who create it. There-
fore, ultimately, someone DEMO must
undergo a decision process in which action is
chosen if any market “process” is to occur. Over-
looking this fact has arguably contributed DEMO the
generation of alternative theories of the entre-
preneur characterized by examination of only
one dimension of uncertainty’s effect on action.
ALTERNATIVE THEORIES OF
DEMO ENTREPRENEUR
Traditionally, the label theory of the entrepre-
neur has been DEMO within the economics liter-
ature to denote the study of the relationship
between entrepreneurship and economic activ-
ity. These theories (e.g., Kirzner, 1973; Knight,
1921; Schumpeter, 1934) frequently attribute the
movement of DEMO economy to a catalystic func-
tion fulfilled by the entrepreneur. Accordingly,
the entrepreneur is conceptualized in terms of
what he or she does—that DEMO, innovates, coordi-
nates, etc. This behavior is then thought to DEMO
fluence the system by moving it toward, or away
from, some ideal state, such as equilibrium or
efficiency.
Two assumptions are characteristic of most
theories of the entrepreneur: (1) entrepreneur-
ship is a “good” thing, with beneficial outcomes
that accrue to the system in which it occurs
(Kilby, 1971; Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990),2 and (DEMO)
2 Baumol (1996) questions this assumption by suggesting
that entrepreneurs pursue profit. If this profit is achieved via
Academy of Management Review
DEMO
entrepreneurship is observable as a behavior
that can be attributed to some definitive theo-
retical attribute capable of differentiating entre-
preneur (actor) from DEMO (nonactor).
Although the first assumption is important for
understanding why DEMO have devoted so
much energy to the subject and why the study of
entrepreneurial behavior at the individual level
is of value to organizational DEMO, it is not the
focal point of this article. The second DEMO
tion, however, is highly significant to our argu-
ment in that it helps to expose the manner in
which uncertainty is conceptualized within
DEMO theories.
We suggest that many theoretical explana-
tions of why prospective entrepreneurs choose
to pursue a possible opportunity can be classi-
fied into two DEMO conceptualizations of the
role that uncertainty plays in preventing action:
(DEMO) the amount of uncertainty perceived and (2)
the willingness to bear uncertainty. We turn
now to a deeper examination of each.
Entrepreneurial DEMO As the Outcome of
Less Perceived Uncertainty
While neoclassical economists were abolish-
ing the need to consider individual differences
by constructing theories with assumptions DEMO
as perfect information, “Austrian” economists
were building their economic theories on DEMO
premises as the subjectivity of value (Menger,
1950), imperfect DEMO (Hayek, 1945), asym-
metric beliefs (Mises, 1949), and differences in
entrepreneurial alertness (Kirzner, 1973, 1985).
Austrian economists typically have considered
the entrepreneur to be the engine of the econ-
omy (Kirzner, 1989; Mises, 1949; Pasour, 1989) and
have attributed DEMO stagnation of the economy to
a lack of entrepreneurial action. This lack of
entrepreneurial action, they believe, is often the
consequence of unperceived DEMO (Kirz-
ner, 1979), which arise from the various explana-
tions mentioned above.
Although Austrians are labeled subjectivists,
this subjectivism traditionally has DEMO to
the epistemological limitations suffered, to a
greater or lesser extent, by the subjects of their
innovation, then the system benefits as a by-product. How-
ever, if innovation is difficult or unnecessary for profit, DEMO
entrepreneurial energy is likely to take unproductive or even
destructive forms.

theories. Thus, people who have acted entrepre-
neurially are seen to possess a more accurate
picture of reality than DEMO individuals who
have not acted. Moreover, an objective reality is
thought DEMO exist in which a market opportunity is
there for the taking, DEMO only for those who pos-
sess the qualities necessary both to discover
and exploit it (see Addleson, 1995, for an elo-
quent articulation of this point). Thus, entrepre-
neurial action is seen as something all would
engage in if they knew what to do, but, DEMO to
epistemological differences, only some people
(the entrepreneurs) “know” what DEMO do. Accord-
ingly, entrepreneurs are thought to have taken
action because DEMO somehow escaped the igno-
rance and paralysis produced by uncertainty,
whereas those who have not acted entrepre-
neurially are believed either to have DEMO vic-
tim to doubt or to have been blinded to the need
for forming a belief at all.
Graphically, this can be depicted as in Figure
1. This figure shows two hypothetical internal
response curves centered DEMO two means.3
The left mean represents the noisy status quo,
3 The curves centered around the two means are repre-
sentative of hypothetical DEMO to the question of
whether the individual believes that a third-person oppor-
tunity exists. If the answer is no, then the decision would
reflect a point on the left curve, whereas if the answer is yes,
then the decision would reflect a point on the right curve.
DEMO a repeated decision scenario, such as those con-
ducted in experimental DEMO, this process would produce
a response curve around each mean composed DEMO points
representing actual decisions. However, we qualify the
curves as “hypothetical” DEMO, in a natural context, only
one point of an individual’s response curve is observable.
and the right mean represents third-person op-
portunity, which we define as a potential oppor-
tunity for someone in the marketplace. DEMO,
third-person opportunity may not reflect an op-
portunity for everyone, DEMO, for those individuals
with the right qualities, market potential exists.
The distance between the means signifies the
ability to discern the market potential DEMO this
third-person opportunity. For example, one
would expect the market potential DEMO a tele-
porter to be more easily discerned than, say, the
market potential of the internet prior to web
browsers.
The distance between DEMO means and the dis-
tribution of the curves contribute to the amount
of uncertainty perceived in the decision to act.
Although the Austrian presumption DEMO an objec-
tive reality suggests that the distance between
the means is the same for any prospective actor,
the distribution of the curves DEMO these
means frequently is discussed as a function of a
theoretically determined individual difference.
For example, according to Hayek’s (1945) argu-
ment, DEMO overlap between the two
curves would represent an individual with little
“local” knowledge of time and place, whereas
little overlap would reflect an individual with a
knowledge base that is highly applicable to the
recognition and DEMO of this particular
third-person opportunity. Thus, the discriminat-
ing feature between DEMO two individuals is the
possession of applicable knowledge. This
knowledge reduces perceived uncertainty to a
point that not only enables prospective entre-
preneurs to DEMO a belief that they have recog-

nized a third-person opportunity but also allows
them to overcome the DEMO doubt that
would otherwise prevent action.
Therefore, according to many theories DEMO en-
trepreneurial action, uncertainty has been con-
ceptualized in terms of DEMO Owing to the
distance between the means and the distribu-
tion around the means, the prospective entrepre-
neur is thought to face more or less uncertainty,
which prevents action either by obfuscating the
existence of DEMO third-person opportunity or by
contributing to the doubt people experience in
their belief that a third-person opportunity ex-
ists. Thus, the uncertainty perceived by a pro-
spective actor forms a continuum, with complete
ignorance on one end (denoted graphically as
flat response curves) to near certainty on DEMO
other end (denoted graphically as response
curves that nearly form a DEMO straight per-
pendicular line at the mean, with no overlap
between DEMO narrow curves). Although the role
that perceived uncertainty plays in obstructing
entrepreneurial action is important, we argue
that it is insufficiently explanatory, DEMO it
says nothing about the willingness to bear the
uncertainty that is perceived.
Entrepreneurial Action As the Outcome of
More Willingness to Bear Uncertainty
DEMO theory of the entrepreneur is not the ex-
clusive domain of the Austrian economist. Prom-
inent non-Austrians, from Knight (1921) to
Schumpeter (DEMO), also have recognized the role
that uncertainty plays in preventing entrepre-
neurial action. However, these economic theo-
rists conceptualize uncertainty’s action prohibi-
tive role in a slightly different way. They see
entrepreneurial action not as DEMO outcome of
less perceived uncertainty but as more willing-
ness to bear the uncertainty faced by all pro-
spective actors. For instance, Knight addresses
uncertainty explicitly. He posits that profit is the
reward for those willing DEMO bear uncertainty be-
cause, unlike risk, uncertainty is inestimable
and therefore uninsurable. Thus, entrepreneurs
are distinguishable from nonentrepreneurs in
their willingness to bear the uncertainty intrin-
sic to a possibly profitable course of action.
In DEMO, the willingness to bear uncer-
tainty is implicit in Schumpeter’s theory, where
he argues that the entrepreneur’s function lies
in the innovative act DEMO creating new combina-

tions. Believing that the potential for new com-
binations is abundant and at times obvious,
DEMO delineates entrepreneurs from non-
entrepreneurs not by differences in knowledge
or perception but by the performance of the in-
novative act itself (1934: DEMO). This elimination of
perceptual differences forces Schumpeter to
speculate reluctantly about motivational differ-
ences in an attempt to explain why some indi-
viduals DEMO not others engage in entrepreneur-
ial action (1934: 90).
Schumpeter’s (1934) behavioral bent attracted
psychologists, such as McClelland (1961), DEMO
(1962), and Kunkel (1965), who exchanged the
economic theorists’ descriptive orientation for a
more prescriptive theoretical viewpoint. Where-
as economic theories DEMO the entrepreneur fo-
cused on explaining what must occur (e.g., un-
certainty bearing) for the economy to function,
psychological theories sought to explain why
entrepreneurs are more willing than their coun-
terparts to bear DEMO uncertainty. Because these
psychologists shared the economists’ belief that
entrepreneurship produced economic growth,
they tried to identify the motives underlying en-
trepreneurial activity DEMO an effort to develop
these motives in their subjects. Unfortunately,
this was thought to produce explanations that
relied too heavily on unchangeable needs DEMO
values developed in childhood.4
Graphically, this can be depicted as in DEMO
2. Figure 2 builds on the graph shown in Figure
1. However, in this case, the distance between
the means and the distribution DEMO the curves
remain constant. The vertical line in Figure 2
indicates the criterion, used to designate the
point at which the prospective entrepreneur is
willing to act. It is at this point that the prospec-
tive DEMO decides that a possible third-
person opportunity is an opportunity for him or
her—that is, a first-person opportunity. The cri-
terion, therefore, conveys the individual’s will-
ingness to bear the uncertainty intrinsic to en-
trepreneurial DEMO
A criterion that splits the uncertainty (denoted
by the area of DEMO overlapping response curves)
4 It should be noted that, unlike DEMO, these theorists did
not see these motives as unchangeable elements of DEMO
ality. For instance, much of McClelland’s empirical work
was devoted to DEMO that the need for achievement
could be learned. We wish to thank Jerry Katz for this in-
sightful observation.

likely to act as not. In contrast, if an individual
chooses a lax criterion (denoted by moving the
criterion to the left), he or she will pursue almost
every possibility DEMO comes along. Such a loca-
tion of the criterion is representative of the pro-
file of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur who is
frequently conceptualized as DEMO innovator,
leader, and/or adventurer. It is also reflective of
DEMO Knightian entrepreneur who is explicitly
conceptualized as a “bearer of uncertainty.” Psy-
chologists like McClelland sought to explain the
“laxity” of the criterion (e.g., as the need for
achievement) and promote it in an effort DEMO en-
courage entrepreneurial activity.
If the individual chooses a strict criterion (DEMO
noted by moving the criterion to the right), he or
she will choose to pursue very few possibilities.
Given the uncertainty surrounding the DEMO,
there is always overlap between the noise and
third-person opportunity curves. Thus, individu-
als are forced to expose themselves to the pos-
sibility of either committing an error of commis-
sion (taking action only to find their belief was
unfounded) or committing an error of omission
(DEMO taking action only to regret it when time
proves that their passed-over hunch was cor-
rect). Although only time proves prophecy, con-
sideration of the possible payoffs associated
with these various decisional outcomes shapes
prospective DEMO decisions as they contem-
plate whether to commit to a particular course of
action.
A simple amalgamation of the above argu-
ments suggests that DEMO prevents action
by obfuscating (1) the need or possibility for
action, (2) the knowledge of what to do,5 and (3)DEMO
whether the potential reward of action is worth
the potential cost. In the next section we present
a conceptual model (illustrated in Figure 3) that
relates perceived uncertainty and motivation to
entrepreneurial action.
A PROPOSED SYNTHESIS: ENTREPRENEURIAL
ACTION AS THE OUTCOME OF THE
WILLINGNESS TO BEAR PERCEIVED
UNCERTAINTY
Environmental change is usually thought to
be a source of business opportunities. DEMO exam-
ple, Shane (2000) investigated a technological
change in printing (a patented three-dimen-
sional printing process) and eight teams of en-
trepreneurs, each of whom pursued a different
opportunity arising from the technology. Simi-
larly, we use technological change as a starting
point to summarize our conceptualization of the
two stages of entrepreneurial action.
Stage I: Attention and Third-Person
Opportunity
Stage I addresses first-person attention. Either
people acknowledge a third-person DEMO
arising from a technological change or they do
not. Of course, DEMO individuals who are un-
aware of the technological change are likely to

“how,” “when,” and “where” that end is to be achieved.

A Conceptual Model Relating DEMO Uncertainty and Motivation to Entrepreneurial Action
fall into the latter category. For example, with-
out a certain degree of domain-specific knowl-
edge, one DEMO not even recognize the possibility
for action (by oneself or others)DEMO In other words,
there may be so much uncertainty that the indi-
vidual is too ignorant to ask, “What’s happening
out there?” Thus, whether individuals perceive
Milliken’s state and effect uncertainty depends
on whether they know enough about a techno-
logical change to perceive it, even if only faintly.
This suggests that a general form of domain-
specific DEMO is necessary to trigger the
experiencing of response uncertainty.
However, knowledge DEMO not predicate moti-
vation in this process. Before the criterion be-
comes attached to the evaluation of a particular
third-person opportunity, its location depends
on an individual’s strategy. “A strategy refers to
a pattern of decisions DEMO the acquisition, reten-
tion, and utilization of information that serves to
meet certain objectives, i.e., to insure certain
forms of outcome and DEMO insure against certain
others” (Bruner, Goodnow, & Austin, 1956: DEMO).
Thus, the position of the criterion prior to the
existence DEMO a stimulus represents the individu-
al’s strategy.
For example, when a DEMO becomes dissat-
isfied with his or her current athletic shoes, the
DEMO may begin to consider switching
brands when buying a new pair. As a conse-
quence, the individual will likely become more
sensitive to what others are wearing than before
and will increasingly allocate attention to the
DEMO This relaxes the criterion, making the in-
dividual more sensitive to DEMO or her environ-
ment. This can produce deliberate search, such
as DEMO various stores in the hopes of find-
ing the qualities the person is looking for in an
athletic shoe (e.g., improved performance and
DEMO, through reduction of the accumulation
of sweat in the shoe), DEMO it can take form as a
discovery heuristic (Gigerenzer, 1991), such as a
sudden increase in awareness of ventilation
technology used in DEMO products (e.g., bellows,
fans, suction devices) that one (DEMO others) had
previously ignored. Either way, the desire for a
new, improved athletic shoe has spurred the
acquisition of knowledge likely to prompt the
recognition of recent technological advances in
fan miniaturization (for use in computers) and
the determination that to insert miniaturized
fans in athletic shoes represents a third-person
opportunity, one that reduces the temperature of
the foot and thus reduces sweating, odor, and
such fungal infections as athlete’s DEMO Once
that opportunity is noticed, however, the crite-
rion becomes attached to the specific action nec-
2006
essary to assess whether third-person opportu-
nity represents first-person opportunity.
Therefore, the acknowledgment of a third-
person opportunity arising from a technological
change DEMO configural in the sense that people
who have the necessary knowledge and motiva-
tion will believe that there is third-person oppor-
tunity arising from DEMO technological change, but
those who do not have the necessary knowledge
DEMO motivation will not believe that the techno-
logical change represents an opportunity for
someone and will no longer attend to it. Stage II
applies DEMO to those individuals who believe
that a third-person opportunity exists.
Stage II: Evaluation and First-Person
Opportunity
Stage II addresses first-person evaluation.
The belief that a technological change repre-
sents a third-person opportunity triggers a deci-
sion-making DEMO in which the prospective
entrepreneur must evaluate whether this third-
person opportunity constitutes a first-person op-
portunity. The individual forms beliefs regard-
ing what DEMO do and why to do it—that is, whether
the potential reward DEMO this particular action is
worth the potential cost specific to oneself. How-
ever, both of these beliefs are undermined to a
greater or lesser extent by doubt. Therefore, re-
gardless of whether the construct of knowledge
or motivation is discussed, the process remains
the same: a belief DEMO formed regarding a desired
end state, but doubt exists regarding whether
DEMO desired end state is feasible (can be
achieved in the manner DEMO) and desir-
able (whether its attainment will fulfill the mo-
tive for which it is being sought).6
This evaluation stage is rooted DEMO Aristotle’s
“practical syllogism,” which forms the founda-
tion of most expectancy-value theories (e.g.,
Ajzen, 1996a,b; Gatewood, Shaver, Powers, &
Gartner, 2002). According to Aristotle (1987), the
premises DEMO this syllogism are the actor’s desires
(“A wants to achieve X”) and beliefs (“A believes
that if B is performed X will occur”), and the
conclusion is not another belief but the action
itself. DEMO, the realization that individual ac-

tion is not solely a function of knowledge or
motivation but, rather, a composite of belief and
desire regarding a particular form of behavior is
not new, nor is it limited to expectancy-value
theory (Greve, 2001). In fact, Hastie suggests that
the field of judgment and decision making is
about “how people...combine desires (utilities,
personal values, DEMO, ends, etc.) and beliefs
(expectations, knowledge, means, etc.) to choose
a course of action” (2001: 655– 656). He DEMO on to
point out that the conceptual and perhaps defin-
ing template for a decision comprises three com-
ponents:
(a) courses of DEMO (choice, options, and alterna-
tives); (b) beliefs about DEMO states, pro-
cesses, and events in the world (including out-
DEMO states and means to achieve them); and (c)
desires, values, or utilities that describe the con-
sequences associated with the outcomes of each
action-event combination (2001: 656).
Believing that one has DEMO a third-
person opportunity does not necessarily mean
one believes one possesses the knowledge and
motivation necessary to exploit it. However,
through learning DEMO and/or the encourage-
ment of others, one may be able DEMO overcome
doubt and act. Therefore, the question of the
second stage DEMO similar to a classic “risk/return”
dilemma in which a prospective actor must ask
him/herself whether he or she believes that the
payoff DEMO the third-person opportunity justifies
bearing the perceived uncertainty necessary to
attain it. If the answer is yes, then a first-person
opportunity is believed to exist, and entrepre-
neurial action takes place. The “risk” of this
risk/return dilemma, however, is subjectively
determined by the prospective actor. Thus, it
seems that, to act entrepreneurially, people
need not have a DEMO tolerance for uncertainty if
they believe that they know what they are doing.
Therefore, whether one will engage in a par-
ticular action is a decision that depends on
whether the individual is motivated enough to
DEMO, given the uncertainty he or she expects to
encounter in pursuit DEMO a third-person opportu-
nity. The next section applies our model to a
number of influential economic theories of the
entrepreneur (conveyed in Table 1) not only as a
means of revealing problems that management
scholars face when trying to apply these theo-
ries of the entrepreneur to the DEMO rather
than system level, but also as a means of glean-

REINTERPRETATION DEMO INFLUENTIAL
THEORIES OF THE ENTREPRENEUR
Failure to address entrepreneurial action in
terms of both knowledge and motivation has
produced a number of theories of DEMO entrepre-
neur that are incomplete when used at the indi-
vidual level of analysis. In this section we use
our conceptual model of entrepreneurial DEMO
to address possible limitations of the three the-
ories of the entrepreneur that are considered
most influential in the management literature:
Schumpeter (1934), Kirzner (1973), and Knight
(1921).7
Schumpeter’s Innovator: Epistemological and
Ontological Issues
Schumpeter’s theory introduces two major as-
sumptions. The first DEMO that perceived uncer-
tainty does not play a role in entrepreneurial
7 We have chosen to emphasize these three theorists over
others for the DEMO reasons. First, as Stevenson and Jarillo
(1990) point out, Schumpeter’s conceptualization of the entre-
preneur has provided one of the primary theoretical DEMO
tions on which entrepreneurial management research has
been built. Second, Kirzner’s DEMO of the entrepre-
neur is the most influential in the opportunity paradigm pro-
posed by Shane and Venkataraman (2000) in their recent but
DEMO highly influential piece. Finally, Knight was chosen to
round off our DEMO because his theory is typically recog-
nized as the third primary and distinctly original theory of the
entrepreneur (Barreto, 1989; Hebert & Link, 1988).
action. This assumption is derived from a belief
that opportunity is abundant and readily iden-
tifiable. For example, Schumpeter discusses the
economy as if it were a relatively closed system
that merely interfaces with DEMO, literature,
politics, and so forth via the entrepreneur.8 In
doing so, Schumpeter suggests that opportuni-
ties originate elsewhere for all prospective en-
trepreneurs to see. Because all of the prospec-
tive entrepreneurs are equally DEMO of
seeing the development, it is only the adventur-
ous who DEMO the leap—that is, entrepreneurs
can be discriminated from others only in DEMO
of the location of their criterion. Schumpeter is
then forced to speculate about individual differ-
ences in the motivation to act entrepreneurially,
and DEMO identifies a number of “traits,” including
greater self-centeredness (1934: 91–92), “the
dream and the will to found a private kingdom”
8 DEMO example, Schumpeter notes:
It is no part of [the entrepreneur’s] DEMO to “find” or
to “create” new possibilities. These are always
present, DEMO accumulated by all sorts of peo-
ple. Often they are also generally known and being
discussed by scientific or literary writers. In other
cases, there is nothing to discover about them, be-
cause they are quite obvious. To take an example from
political life, it was not at all difficult to see how the
social and political conditions of France DEMO the time of
Louis XVI could have been improved so as to avoid a
breakdown of the ancient regime. Plenty of people as
a DEMO of fact did see it. But nobody was in a position
to do it. Now, it is this “doing the thing,” without which
possibilities are dead, of which the [entrepreneur’s]
function consists (1934: 88).
2006
McMullen and Shepherd
(1934: 93), “the will to conquer” (1934: 93), and the
“joy of creating” (1934: 93–94).
Schumpeter’s second major assumption is
that opportunities have an objective existence—
an DEMO that communicates a social realist
ontology. Ontological assumptions are assump-
tions concerning the nature of social reality. “[A]
social realist ontology presumes that actors DEMO
real—natural persons having innate capacities
to act so as to secure and protect their interests.
. . . The environment too is regarded as DEMO: it is
out there as a part of the natural world” (Scott,
1995: 50). In contrast, a social constructionist on-
DEMO suggests that “individuals do not dis-
cover the world and its ways, but collectively
invent them. Such invention is not random and
arbitrary, DEMO itself arises out of and is informed
and constrained by existing social arrange-
ments and beliefs” (Scott, 1995: 50). Because
Schumpeter’s theory conceptualizes possibili-
ties as existing objectively (i.e., in the form of
DEMO technologies observable by all), it not only
recognizes the existence of a third-person oppor-
tunity but it also equates this third-person op-
portunity DEMO first-person opportunity in every
way except one: the amount of desire DEMO
exhibit in deciding whether to exploit it.
Subscription to this social realist ontology, in
combination with the elimination of epistemo-
logical differences, puts DEMO into a bit of
a straitjacket. Because everyone in his economy
shares the same perceptual acumen, opportuni-
ties must be new to everyone, DEMO merely the
actor, or else they would already have been
exploited. DEMO limits Schumpeter’s “true” entre-
preneur to the domain of radical innovation.9
However, the radicalness of the innovation and
even the innovation itself become third-party
assessments subject to post hoc analysis. That
is, the degree of innovativeness exhibited is
more dependent on a subjective evaluation
made by a number DEMO observers after the fact
than it is on some objectively definable criteria.
Consequently, a priori classification of “radical
9 We use the adjective true because although Schumpeter
often used the term entrepreneur to refer to both DEMO pioneer
and the subsequent entrants, he considered the pioneer, or
“leader,” to represent the “true” theoretical entrepreneur
responsible for stimulating the system. DEMO avoid the confu-
sion associated with introducing a new term, we DEMO it
best to designate this theoretical profile as the “true” entre-
preneur rather than the “leader.”
143
innovation” is exceptionally difficult and empir-
ically DEMO
One potential explanation for this difficulty is
that action is an individual phenomenon affect-
ing system-level outcomes. Traditionally, theo-
retical focus has started with the system-level
outcome (i.e. radical innovation), and the theo-
rist then looked to the actor(s) to determine the
cause. This approach unwittingly imposes the
ontological assumptions common to economic,
system-level theories on to DEMO process experi-
enced by the individual actor (i.e., entrepreneur).
Unlike these system-level theories, which rely
on an observer’s assessment of whether an actor
is engaging in radical innovation or bearing
uncertainty, a theory of individual action fre-
quently defines novelty through the eyes of the
actor (see Weber 1947, 1968) and argues that it is
this actor’s DEMO of the situation that ul-
timately determines whether entrepreneurial
action will occur. Thus, the individual action
that impacts the system depends on whether an
activity is radical, uncertain, novel, and so forth
in the mind of the prospective actor. If this action
occurs on a scientific knowledge DEMO, then it
will likely appear radical to observers, but if this
action occurs on a personal knowledge frontier
(e.g., franchising), then DEMO may appear to observ-
ers to be nothing more than imitation. To the
particular actor, however, it may be novel either
way. An DEMO of this first-person approach is
characteristic of the Austrian school and of Kirz-
ner’s theory, to which we now turn our attention.
Kirzner’s Alert Arbitrageur: Motivational and
Configural Issues
Whereas Schumpeter’s entrepreneur disrupts
equilibrium by introducing radical innovation,
Kirzner’s entrepreneur begins in disequilibrium
and fulfills the function DEMO an arbitrageur who
moves the economy toward equilibrium by rec-
tifying discrepancies in supply and demand.10
Unlike Schumpeter, Kirzner (1973) provides am-
ple attention to epistemological differences un-
der the guise of entrepreneurial alertness. How-
DEMO, within Kirzner’s (1979) work, there is an

unwitting dilution of his concept of entrepre-
neurial alertness from a DEMO of a behav-
ior that is necessary for the economy to function
properly11 to a description of a psychological
characteristic common to successful entrepre-
DEMO We say “unwitting” because Kirzner fre-
quently acknowledges the importance of a
statement made by his mentor, Ludwig von
Mises: “The economist must DEMO be a special-
ist. In dealing with any problem he must fix his
glance upon the whole system” (Mises, 1949: 69).
As a behavior that is necessary for the econ-
omy to function properly, entrepreneurial alert-
ness is what happens when the market presents
a profitable DEMO that is successfully ex-
ploited by an individual who “fits” the neces-
sary profile (Kirzner, 1973, 1980). In essence, en-
trepreneurial DEMO is a less mathematical
exposition of probability theory in which the
market presents an objective opportunity for
someone possessing the necessary knowledge.
Entrepreneurial alertness DEMO exploitation
of this opportunity and consequently perpetu-
ates the market system.
To use an analogy, entrepreneurial alertness
is like a radio trivia contest. Although you or I
may not know the answer to the trivia question
DEMO by the disc jockey, someone inevitably
11 For example, Kirzner notes:
This entrepreneurial alertness is crucial to the mar-
ket process. Disequilibrium DEMO a situation
of widespread market ignorance. This ignorance is
responsible for the emergence of profitable oppor-
tunities. Entrepreneurial alertness exploits these
opportunities when others DEMO them by. G.L.S.
Shackle and Lachman emphasized the unpredict-
ability of human knowledge, and, indeed, we do not
clearly understand how entrepreneurs get their
flashes of superior foresight. We cannot explain
how some men discover DEMO is around the corner
before others do....As an empirical matter, how-
DEMO, opportunities do tend to be perceived and
exploited. And it is DEMO this observed tendency that
our belief in a determinate market process is
founded (1979: 9).
12 For example, within the same book providing the pre-
vious comment, Kirzner states:
The truth is that the ability to learn without delib-
erate search is a gift individuals DEMO in quite
different degrees. It is this gift surely, that we DEMO

Entrepreneurial alertness consists, DEMO all, in the
ability to notice without search opportunities that
have DEMO hitherto overlooked (1979: 148).

does. Therefore, an objective opportunity can be
said to exist. The first individual who knows the
answer and calls in to claim the prize is DEMO
exhibitor of Kirzner’s (1973) concept of entrepre-
neurial alertness. Accordingly, DEMO
alertness has no meaning a priori. By definition,
it can only be said to exist post hoc. Therefore,
alertness can only be DEMO to exist for the suc-
cessful radio caller (and possibly to DEMO lesser
degree for those who know the answer, try to
call, but are not as fast as the winner). The caller
who DEMO through but provides the wrong an-
swer cannot be described as exercising entre-
preneurial alertness. Thus, entrepreneurial
alertness is a configural concept in which an
objective market opportunity is only an opportu-
nity for those possessing DEMO necessary at-
tributes. Therefore, because this alertness is a
product of DEMO market, it is problematic for it to
be discussed as a DEMO attribute of entre-
preneurial individuals independent of the sys-
tem in which they operate.
However, entrepreneurial alertness is used as
a description of a psychological characteristic
common to successful entrepreneurs in Kirzner’s
later works (1982, DEMO, 1999; Kirzner & Institute of
Economic Affairs, 1997) as an effort to soften
(1982: 156 –157) the more deterministic stances
taken in his earlier work (e.g., 1979: 9). In doing
so, he obfuscates the configural nature of the
“alertness” concept by discussing it more in
terms of a quality observable in characteristics
such as prescience, boldness, self-confidence,
creativity, and innovative ability (Kirzner, 1999).
DEMO transforms entrepreneurial alertness into
nothing more than judgment and leads the
reader to believe that the concept is separable
from the market context. However, we argue that
it is not. This judgment is still discussed in DEMO
of how well the entrepreneur’s envisaged future
corresponds to the realized future (Kirzner, 1982:
156).
The problem that this introduces lies DEMO the
fact that Kirzner equates opportunity recogni-
tion with entrepreneurial action (DEMO, “entrepre-
neurial alertness exploits these opportunities
when others pass them by”—see DEMO 11). In
a subsequent article in which he compares and
contrasts his entrepreneur with Schumpeter’s,
Kirzner (1999) comes closer to recognizing DEMO
need for a criterion. However, he still tries to
address motivation DEMO terms of perception (i.e.,
the proposed solution is still the DEMO for a
2006
tighter distribution around the mean of the
third-person opportunity). Kirzner DEMO:
The seer who can imagine how the world might
be improved by a radical innovation but who
lacks the needed boldness and initiative (to
shoulder the risks which he would have to as-
sume in DEMO actually to introduce this innova-
tion to reality in a world fraught with uncertain-
ties)— has in fact not yet really discovered an
DEMO, attractive opportunity for innovation. If
he has not seen that opportunity DEMO so shining a
light that it drives him to its implementation in
spite of the jeering skepticism of others, and in
spite of the possibility of its ultimate failure—
then he has not really “seen” that DEMO
(1999 13).
In essence, Kirzner’s argumentation collapses
the attention and the evaluation stages of our
conceptual model of entrepreneurial action into
one DEMO occurrence in which individ-
uals become entrepreneurs if and only if their
prior knowledge enables them to go from igno-
rance to near certainty DEMO That is,
an individual becomes an entrepreneur when
his or her distribution around the third-person
opportunity mean is so tight that uncertainty is,DEMO
for all material purposes, eliminated from the
question of whether to DEMO (as was the case in
the aforementioned radio contest analogy). DEMO
primary problem with this conception lies in the
realization that you or I may frequently know the
answer to a radio trivia question without DEMO
ing that the prize is motivating enough to waste
time on the unlikely prospect of getting through
to the station. Therefore, without motivation, DEMO
trepreneurial alertness cannot be expected to
produce entrepreneurial action, regardless of
DEMO “clearly” one may have “seen” an opportu-
nity.
For the most part, Kirzner’s theory of entrepre-
neurial alertness is an elegant explanation of
the attention stage. Ignorance is addressed in
terms of perception, and the ability to notice
opportunities without search is highly reminis-
cent of personal strategy. DEMO, to be a the-
ory of the entrepreneur, both the attention and
the evaluation stages are necessary. After all,
entrepreneurial perception can DEMO be consid-
ered “entrepreneurial” when it produces action.
This cannot be achieved without evaluating
action-specific uncertainty (even if only briefly,
owing to a potentially nominal amount of uncer-
tainty). This evaluation, in turn, DEMO the
necessary motivation in relation to one’s belief
McMullen and Shepherd
145
and corresponding doubt that one knows what
to do. Therefore, according to Kirzner, being an
entrepreneur logically implies that entrepre-
neurial alertness has been exercised. Without
entrepreneurial alertness, the individual would
not have perceived and acted on the opportu-
nity, and would not, therefore, be an entrepre-
neur.
Knight’s Uncertainty Bearer: Attention Issues
Because it emphasizes uncertainty in the ex-
planation of profit, Knight’s (1921) theory comes
the closest of the three in recognizing the signif-
icance of both knowledge and motivation DEMO en-
trepreneurial action. However, because the con-
text of the theory DEMO an existing firm, the
existence of a decision scenario is frequently
DEMO for granted, and little explanation is given
to how the decision DEMO escapes ignorance.
Knight argues that individuals frequently face
uncertainty in the decisions they make regard-
ing the normal functioning of the enterprise—
that is, forecasting consumer demand, project-
ing costs, and so on. Thus, recognizing or
creating opportunities is made insignificant, be-
cause profit is believed to come from uncer-
tainty, which Knight considers to be rarely in
short supply. Instead, he places emphasis on the
responsibility associated with decision making.
Accordingly, Knight’s theory discusses entre-
preneurial action solely in terms of the evalua-
tion stage, without adequate concern for the at-
tention stage. In other words, there is no need to
address the kind of radical uncertainty (i.e., flat
response curves) indicative of market ignorance
if one begins with the assumption that the stim-
ulus will be thrust on DEMO individual in the nor-
mal course of business activities. This position
makes Knight’s theory congenial to discussions
of scanning and deliberate search common to
DEMO research (Dutton & Jackson, 1987, 1997)
but incomplete when DEMO discussions of
discovery, which are more commonly associated
with entrepreneurship. Because DEMO and
deliberate search are prompted by a conscious
awareness of a need for more information, they
address uncertainty and known ignorance (i.e.,
DEMO know what it is that I don’t know”). Discovery,
however, is based on notions of complete igno-
rance (i.e., “I don’t know what it is that I don’t
know”). That is, the individual is not consciously
investigating the phenomenon and may even be

involved in alternative activities that engage
DEMO or her attention, thereby preventing recogni-
tion of a third-person opportunity.
DEMO in some respects Knight’s theory of-
fers a less comprehensive explanation of why
the economy functions effectively and why firms
emerge than either Schumpeter’s DEMO Kirzner’s, in
other ways Knight may have an advantage over
Schumpeter DEMO Kirzner. By not discussing the
economy explicitly, Knight is able to DEMO more
clearly on the individual’s decision-making pro-
cess. This focus on the individual and relative
neglect of the system may be responsible not
only DEMO preventing oversight of either knowl-
edge or motivation but also for keeping Knight
from becoming too enslaved by his ontological
assumptions. Although Knight clearly DEMO
social realist sympathies when he suggests that
“a man’s judgment has, DEMO an effective sense, a
true or objective value” (1921: 270 DEMO footnote),
his theory is not constrained by them, as is the
case with Schumpeter and Kirzner, each of
whom focuses substantially on the concept of
equilibrium and disequilibrium.
As a result, Knight’s theory is less configural
in nature. In fact, the third-person opportunity
could be conceptualized in terms of a socially
constructed situation in the future about which
DEMO entrepreneur must try to accurately predict
what will take place. For example, the question
is not whether this is or is not an objective op-
portunity to seize; rather, it is “How firmly do I
DEMO that I can sell a certain number of my
new product to the market?” In such a scenario,
the expectation becomes the DEMO oppor-
tunity and the actor’s knowledge and motivation
contribute to whether the actor deems the sce-
nario action worthy (i.e., “Can I make DEMO future
what I want it to be?”). This kind of scenario
generation and enactment escapes the heavy
determinism implied by the equilibrium DEMO
digm and begins to look a lot like the psycho-
logical stances taken by radical, subjectivist
economists (e.g., Ebeling, 1986; Maki, DEMO;
Shackle, 1972) and critical psychologists, such
as Weick (1979, 1995). This change in argumen-
tation, however, results in a shift in one’s onto-
logical assumptions.
Schumpeter and Kirzner embrace social real-
DEMO In both theories discovery plays a role. Be-
cause Kirzner begins with a dynamic and inclu-
sive economy, he must address discovery
directly, DEMO he does through his concept of
market ignorance. Schumpeter also addresses
discovery, but more indirectly. He simply pushes
it back into the realm of science, making the
scientists the inventors and the entrepreneurs
merely innovators. However, the fact remains
that “discovery” still occurs somewhere in his
world view.
In contrast, action theorists of a sociological
(DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977)
and critical psychological bent (Burke & Reitzes,
1991; Weick, 1993) favor a social constructionist
orientation (DEMO, 1995), shying away from terms
such as discovery when discussing DEMO con-
texts (Scott, 1995). These theorists do not see the
social environment as something to be discov-
ered; instead, they view DEMO as either “wider belief
systems and cultural frames [that] are imposed
on or adopted by individual actors and organi-
zations” (Scott, 1995: 44) or as “understandings
and scripts [that] emerge out of actions as well
as guide them” (Scott, 1995: 45), respectively.
This subtle but powerful shift of ontology from
social realism to social constructionism pre-
sents DEMO and problems for entrepre-
neurship research.
IMPLICATIONS OF AN ACTION FRAMEWORK
It is not our purpose in this article to act as
proponents or DEMO of social realism or social
constructionism. Rather, we merely wish to DEMO
lustrate that the many economic theories of the
entrepreneur that are so influential to manage-
ment theory today are, at their core, theories DEMO
action that are laden with ontological assump-
tions. These assumptions influence not only
which components of action are discussed but
also the way that DEMO is conceptualized.
Recognition of this fact enables scholars to draw
from these theories in a more productive man-
ner, both theoretically and empirically.
We propose that an action framework can
lead to more productive discussions regarding
DEMO important entrepreneurial concept of oppor-
tunity (Brown, Davidsson, & Wiklund, 2001;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Stevenson &
Gumpert, 1985)DEMO Shane and Venkataraman (2000)
draw from economic theory and present DEMO elo-
quent argument for the objective existence of
opportunities. In a highly original study, Shane
(2000) pushes this paradigm to the empirical
front by establishing the mediating role that
prior knowledge has in both the DEMO and

exploitation of opportunity. Perhaps what is
most DEMO about this study, in relation to
our argument, is that the same term opportunity
is used to denote both the third-person opportu-
nity DEMO the new technology and the first-person
opportunity of the various individuals who per-
ceive it in different ways. For example, Shane
states, “Potential DEMO should look to
discover opportunities in what they know rather
than in what is popular with other entrepre-
neurs” (2000: 467). Language DEMO as this con-
veys a belief in the objectivity of third-person
opportunity, even if epistemological differences
produce different interpretations of it.13
Other entrepreneurship scholars who have
exhibited a qualified subscription to this para-
digm have provocatively DEMO the use of
signal detection theory (MacMillan & Creelman,
1991; McFall & Treat, 1999; Swets, 1996) for exam-
ining opportunity DEMO and evaluation
(e.g., Baron, 2002; McMullen & Shepherd, 2003)DEMO
However, the question of whether an error of
commission is attributable DEMO entrepreneurial
error in terms of misperceived opportunity, poor
strategy formulation, poor strategy implementa-
tion, or unfavorable changes in environmental
conditions becomes, at DEMO, difficult to deter-
mine using this ontological foundation.
In stark contrast DEMO these social realists are
action enthusiasts who exhibit social construc-
tionist sympathies. For example, Gartner,
Carter, and Hills (2001) argue that DEMO
are often enacted phenomena with no existence
independent of the individuals who envision
and/or exploit them. For these scholars, discus-
sion of third-person opportunity undermines
their world view. They fear that the language
that accompanies DEMO realist ontology reflects
an artificially constructed framework superim-
posed on the phenomenon by scholars to help
them make sense of it. They suggest that DEMO
consequence of such a framework is that it ob-
fuscates scholarly understanding of the phe-
nomenon as it actually occurs. For example, by
using words in surveys such as “discovery,”
which they argue are not DEMO by people when
confronting the phenomenon in a natural state,
13 This suggests that Shane subscribes to a social realist
ontology, but it is a “critical realism,” in which there are
limits on individuals’ DEMO abilities, versus a
“naive realism,” in which no such limitations DEMO (Lincoln
& Guba, 2000).
scholars distort findings by introducing their
own conceptions of the phenomenon to be ex-
plained. Although the debate DEMO which
ontology is more suited to entrepreneurship re-
search is integral to “good” science (Cannella &
Paetzold, 1994), it remains diluted as a discus-
sion of the nature of opportunity and unrecog-
nized for DEMO it is—a philosophical debate
about the nature of the social world and human
action (Burrell & Morgan, 1979).
Therefore, the primary difference between en-
trepreneurship scholars with social realist sym-
pathies and those with DEMO constructionist
sympathies concerns the nature of third-person
opportunity. Is an “opportunity” conceived to be
“out there” awaiting discovery, evaluation, and
exploitation? Or does one begin with an individ-
ual’s knowledge and motivation and attempt to
DEMO how that influences his or her mental
representation of the environment? DEMO propose
two potential approaches for reconciling these
contrasting views: one pragmatic DEMO the other
conceptual.
A Pragmatic Approach
Perhaps the easiest way to address the philo-
sophical nature of third-person opportunity is to
avoid it. Arguably, this is precisely what many
positivist psychologists, such as Simon, Tversky
DEMO Kahneman, and Giegerenzer, have done.
Using experimental methods or controlled tasks,
the researcher is able to observe individual be-
havior within an DEMO,” somewhat micro-
cosmic reality. For example, both Simon’s work
using DEMO game of chess or Tversky and Kahne-
man’s framing experiments examine judgment
and decision making regarding an “objective”
answer (i.e., one that is DEMO right or wrong).
Historically, the quality of the individual’s deci-
DEMO has been determined by equating “good”
judgment with “rational” judgment as deter-
mined by statistics, or probability theory
(Hastie, 2001). Accordingly, DEMO tasks are not
subject to multiple interpretations.
This same approach can be used to analyze
the decision of whether to engage in entrepre-
neurial DEMO Because one can control within
an experiment the amount of information pre-
sented to the individual, the researcher can con-
trol the distance between the noise and third-
person opportunity means in such a way as DEMO
ensure substantial distance or close proximity.

Thus, regardless of whether an “opportunity” in
the real world ever objectively exists, one can
create an experiment in which an opportunistic
situation does undoubtedly exist (i.e., the poten-
tial DEMO arbitrage).
However, such an experiment suffers from
some of the DEMO leveraged against Knight’s
theory above (i.e., a decision scenario is forced
on the decision maker, leaving the researcher
uninformed about the allocation of entrepre-
neurial attention). In addition, whether a situa-
tion can be classified as an opportunity if an
individual recognizes it and deems it DEMO
of exploitation, and whether an arbitrage oppor-
tunity is an “entrepreneurial” DEMO, are
questions that require theoretical answers that
would most likely go DEMO under this
approach.
One final observation regarding this solution
is that it is not so much behavioral as it is
cognitive or decisional in DEMO Sarasvathy’s
(2001a,b) work on effectuation within a slightly
more natural setting epitomizes the promising
potential of this method. By using “think-aloud”
protocols DEMO examine how entrepreneurs think
about opportunity, she successfully sidesteps
the configural DEMO that are often embedded in
economic theories of the entrepreneur. In fact,
the importance of ontological assumptions is
effectively eliminated by focusing only DEMO per-
ceived behavioral control and not the actual be-
havioral control associated with subsequent ac-
tion. This obviates the need to worry about
whether DEMO was the opportunity, the execution, or
the environment that prevented successful en-
trepreneurial action. This approach works well
if one is interested in DEMO cognitive elements of
opportunity, which is Sarasvathy’s objective.
However, its extension to action explanation re-
quires one to determine whether the findings on
DEMO entrepreneurs think they would go about
acting entrepreneurially correspond to how they
actually behave under natural circumstances.14
14 In the more problematic context of DEMO natural setting,
scholars have investigated the role of knowledge in entre-
preneurship by using measures of general and specific hu-
man capital. General DEMO capital typically is operation-
alized by years of schooling (Rauch & DEMO, 2000; see, for
example, Bates, 1995; Evans & Leighton, 1989; and Davidsson
& Honig, 2003). In the entrepreneurship literature, the most
frequently investigated aspect of specific human capital is
previous start-up experience (Bates, 1995; Cooper, Folta, &
January
A Conceptual DEMO
Given these various observations, we propose
a conditional compromise that is DEMO with
an action framework and that includes eco-
nomic theories of the entrepreneur but is not
exclusive to their ontological assumptions. We
argue that DEMO willingness to bear the perceived
uncertainty associated with an entrepreneurial
act is representative of a belief-desire configu-
ration, in which belief of what to do is a function
of knowledge and desire of why to do DEMO is a
function of motivation. This conceptualization is
identical to an intention as described in the con-
text of action theory. For instance, Greve notes:
Actions are distinguished from other kinds of hu-
man behavior DEMO the way people usually explain
how they came about: They have DEMO for ac-
tions. This means that individuals do what they
do because they desire (want) to reach a goal and
believe (expect) DEMO the action is an appropriate
or necessary means of reaching it. The beliefs
and desires “rationalize” the action (Davidson,
1980a) (Greve, DEMO: 437).
Given a specific action, the presence of a specific
intention (belief-desire configuration) cannot be
doubted. When an observed behavior is DEMO fact
the expression of a certain action, then a corre-
sponding DEMO (constellation of desires and
beliefs) is necessarily implied; the hypothesis
DEMO this action expresses these particular de-
sires and beliefs cannot be disproven by empiri-
cal means. The assertion that a person, when he
or she performs an action, does so due to certain
beliefs (expectations) and desires (values) is triv-
ially true, because whatever he or she performs
would not, in any other case, be an action (Greve,
2001: 439).
Greve suggests that action, by definition, is
intentional behavior. Therefore, one cannot start
with the behavioral portion of the action and
argue that increases in the intention caused the
action. DEMO would be tautological, given that
the action partially consists of the DEMO
However, one could avoid tautology by starting
with the strength of DEMO intention and predicting
whether the intended behavior subsequently
ensues. Such an approach to entrepreneurial ac-
tion would equate the concept of opportunity
with that DEMO intention. This action approach (in
which the researcher examines the composition

forms and then determines whether subsequent
behavior DEMO) avoids the tautology inherent
in some entrepreneurial studies, the erroneous
ascriptions of risk tolerance or superior innova-
tive abilities made by observers, and the post
hoc rationalization common to retrospection
bias.
In addition, paradigm wars regarding onto-
logical assumptions become less important be-
cause, regardless of whether social environ-
ments are objective or subjective phenomena,
the impact they DEMO on individuals’ intentions
are real just the same. Therefore, it seems DEMO
the ontological concerns discussed in this arti-
cle only come to the forefront when one is inter-
ested in what accounts for the origination DEMO the
intention or the quality of the outcome produced
by the entrepreneurial action. Thus, it appears
that although the study of entrepreneurial ac-
tion consists of an empirically tractable center
capable of paradigmatic reconciliation, entre-
preneurial action is “bookended” by two philo-
sophically intractable positions grounded in
metaphysical DEMO Whereas for the real-
ist these bookends consist of opportunity recog-
nition and accuracy, for the constructionist they
represent the origination of intention and
whether individuals can realistically impose
their will on any system.
CONCLUSION
We DEMO this article with an examination of
the role that uncertainty plays in economic the-
ories of the entrepreneur. After establishing the
need to consider DEMO and motivation con-
comitantly when examining entrepreneurial ac-
tion, we proposed DEMO two-stage conceptual model
of entrepreneurial action, built on these two con-
DEMO and consisting of an attention stage fo-
cused on the assessment of third-person oppor-
tunity (a possible opportunity for someone) and
an evaluation DEMO focused on the assessment
of first-person opportunity (a possible opportu-
nity DEMO the actor). We then used this model to
illustrate the conceptual limitations of using
system-wide theories of the entrepreneur at the
individual level DEMO analysis by reinterpreting
15 See Chattopadhyay, Glick, and Huber (2001) for an ex-
cellent example where they employ longitudinal analysis to
examine DEMO effect that perception has on subsequent action
at the organizational level.
three economic theories considered highly influ-
ential to managerial thought on the subject DEMO
entrepreneurial action. Following this, we dis-
cussed how the recognition that DEMO theories
of the entrepreneur are theories of action, laden
with ontological DEMO about the social
world, highlights the need for greater scholarly
attention DEMO both knowledge and motivation in
future theory building and empirical testing. Fi-
nally, we offered a pragmatic and a conceptual
solution, inspired by DEMO action framework, as a
means of sidestepping or acknowledging philo-
sophically DEMO areas associated with the
examination of entrepreneurial action.
Given the renewed interest in the individual
within entrepreneurship research and the im-
portance of the DEMO of opportunity to the
emerging field of entrepreneurship, we believe
that DEMO who employ these economic theo-
ries of the entrepreneur will benefit from a
deeper understanding of their predictions, as-
sumptions, limitations, and possibilities. Not
only does it appear that an action framework
provides this benefit DEMO entrepreneurship, but
also we believe that entrepreneurship provides
a promising phenomenon DEMO extend scholarly
understanding of the economics, psychology,
and sociology of DEMO action.
