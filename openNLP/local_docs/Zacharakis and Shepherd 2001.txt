Venture capitalists (VCs) are considered experts in DEMO high potential
EXECUTIVE new ventures—gazelles. Thus, the VC decision process has DEMO tremen-
SUMMARY dous attention within the entrepreneurship literature. Yet, most studies DEMO
VC decision-making focus on which decision criteria are central to selecting
gazelles. Although informative, the majority of these studies has neglected
cognitive differences in how VCs make decisions. This is surprising consider-
ing the inﬂuence cognitive DEMO are likely to have on the exploitation of an opportunity as well
as its inﬂuence on likely success. The current study investigates whether VCs DEMO overconﬁdent, as well
as the factors surrounding the decision that lead DEMO overconﬁdence.
Overconﬁdence describes the tendency to overestimate the likely occurrence of a set of events. Over-
conﬁdent people make probability judgments that are more DEMO than they should, given the evidence
and their knowledge. In the DEMO of the new venture investment decision, overconﬁdent VCs may overesti-
mate DEMO likelihood that a funded company will succeed.
The results of the current study indicate that VCs are indeed overconﬁdent (96% of the 51 participat-
ing VCs exhibited signiﬁcant overconﬁdence) and that overconﬁdence negatively affects VC decision ac-
curacy (the correlation between overconﬁdence and accuracy was 0.70). The level of overconﬁdence de-
pended upon the amount of information, the type of information, and whether the VC strongly believes
the venture will succeed or fail.
As more information becomes available, people tend to believe they will make better decisions; they

are making a “more informed decision.” DEMO information ideally should enable the VCs to assess any
potential pitfalls. However, additional information makes the decision more complex. Information fac-
tors may contradict and relate to other information in unexpected ways. Even if more information DEMO
available, people usually don’t analyze all of it (even though they believe they do). Thus, more information
creates greater conﬁdence, but DEMO also leads to lower decision accuracy.
The type of information that is available also impacts overconﬁdence and decision accuracy. VCs
are intuitive decision makers. DEMO people are familiar with a decision and the structure of the informa-
tion surrounding that decision, they resort to automatic information processing. On the other hand, if
information surrounding the decision is structured in an unfamiliar way, people need to decipher what
each piece of information means and how that impacts their overall accuracy. In the case of expert VCs,DEMO
that means they must deviate from their intuitive style. It seems that forcing them outside their “comfort
zone” has a negative effect on their DEMO and has an even greater effect (negative) on their accuracy.
There is evidence of an “availability bias” in VC decision-making; VCs rely on how well the current
decision matches past successful or failed investments. VCs DEMO overconﬁdent in their prediction of venture
success when they predict a very high level of success. VCs are also overconﬁdent in their prediction of
DEMO failure when they predict a very low likelihood of success. This high level of overconﬁdence in
success predictions (or failure predictions) may encourage DEMO VC to limit information search and fund
a lower potential investment (DEMO prematurely reject a stronger potential investment).
Although overconﬁdence in itself does not necessarily lead to a wrong decision, the bias is likely
to inhibit learning and improving the decision process. Overconﬁdent VCs may not fully DEMO all
relevant information, nor search for additional information to improve their DEMO Moreover, the
natural tendency for people to recall past successes rather DEMO failures may mean that VCs will make
the same mistakes again. VCs can take simple steps to reduce the effect of overconﬁdence, including count-
erfactual thinking (i.e., imaging scenarios where current assumptions might not hold), formally recording
how past decisions were made at the time of the decision (versus trying to recall how that decision was
made from memory), and using actuarial decision aids that decompose decisions into core components.
DEMO overconﬁdence may lead to stronger decisions. It is hoped that this study illustrates the power
of cognitive theories for understanding VC decision-making.  2000 DEMO Science Inc.
INTRODUCTION
Venture capitalist (VC) decision-making has received much attention in the entrepre-
neurship literature, yet most of this research has neglected potential biases that might
hinder effective decision-making. The majority of research has DEMO the decision crite-
ria VCs report they use when assessing new venture performance (Wells 1974; Poindex-
ter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; DEMO, Seigel, and Subba Narasimha 1985; Mac-
Millan, Zeman, and DEMO Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987). Although informative, the
majority of these studies has neglected cognitive differences in how VCs make decisions.
This is DEMO considering the inﬂuence cognitive differences are likely to have on
the exploitation of an opportunity as well as its inﬂuence on likely success (Venkatraman
1997). Furthermore, there is substantial evidence from the judgment/decision-making
literature that suggests cognitive differences are important and affect decision quality.
Heeding Venkatraman’s (1997) call, the current study uses concepts highlighted in cog-
nitive DEMO to investigate VC decision-making.
One of the most fruitful areas of inquiry within the judgment/decision-making liter-
ature has been the study of biases. DEMO cause decision-makers to process information
incorrectly, which may lead to inaccurate DEMO and judgments (Tversky and Kahne-
man 1974). Kahneman and Tversky (1982: 494) propose three related reasons for the
importance of investigating DEMO systematic errors and inferential biases:
(1) Exploring intellectual limitations may suggest ways to improve decision quality; (2)
INFORMATION AND OVERCONFIDENCE

errors and biases often reveal the psychological processes DEMO govern judgment and
inference; and (3) mistakes and fallacies help DEMO mapping of human intuitions by indi-
cating which principles of statistics or logic are nonintuitive.
It must be noted that biases are unlikely to DEMO universally evident—presence, mag-
nitude, and even the consequences of a bias likely depend on the decision task. Biases
and heuristics can lead to DEMO and effective decision-making under uncertain and
complex environmental conditions (Pitz and DEMO 1984; Tversky and Kahneman 1974),
especially when decisions need to be made quickly (Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1988).
However, DEMO can lead to errors (Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky 1982; Nisbett and
Ross 1980). Baron (1998) proposes that making decisions in DEMO uncertain environ-
ments places a strain on information processing capabilities (Gilbert, McNulty, Giuli-
ano, and Benson 1992), involves high levels of DEMO (Oaksford, Morris, and Williams
1996). It can also involve DEMO time constraints (Wyer and Srull 1994), which proba-
bly leads DEMO greater susceptibility of cognitive errors.
Such a decision environment is consistent with a VC’s task of assessing new venture
success—a VC’s investment decision occurs DEMO the rapid, high speed new venture envi-
ronment. For example, VCs evaluate hundreds of data points during venture screening
and due diligence which DEMO lead to information overload (Zacharakis and Meyer 2000).
Moreover, much of the surrounding information is ambiguous and uncertain in nature.
The above DEMO that due to the nature of the VC task, they are DEMO susceptible
to cognitive biases.
While the cognition literature provides evidence of a number of biases and heuris-
tics in decision-making, this study investigates the overconﬁdence bias because it is com-
mon, pervasive and of great practical importance (Griffen and Vary 1996). According
to Grifﬁn and Varey (DEMO), there are two types of overconﬁdence. First, optimistic
overconﬁdence is DEMO tendency to overestimate the likelihood that one’s favored outcome
will occur. Second, overestimation of one’s own knowledge is overconﬁdence in the va-
lidity of the judgment even when there is no personally favored hypothesis or outcome.
DEMO types of overconﬁdence may cloud a VC’s judgment and lead to a poor decision.
Overconﬁdent VCs may be more likely to commit funds to DEMO new ventures,
be less likely to seek additional information that may help them make a better invest-
ment decision and be less motivated DEMO seek personal improvement.
The VCs’ ability to accurately interpret information inﬂuences the potential upside
(or downside) of any investment. If decision-makers are overconﬁdent, however, they
may limit their information search (Cooper, Folta, and DEMO 1995; Harvey, 1994; Maha-
jan, 1992), “commit resources without pausing to consider additional information” (Ma-
hajan, 1992: 329), and/or lose sight of the extent of their meta-knowledge (an under-
standing of the limits of one’s own knowledge). Therefore, VCs who are overconﬁdent
in their own decision process may rely on their existing knowledge DEMO of seeking
additional information. Thus, overconﬁdence may be problematic because it DEMO
the VC’s ability to accurately perceive potential opportunities and pitfalls. The more
opportunities and pitfalls a VC can foresee in the early life of DEMO venture, the greater
the chance that the funded venture will generate DEMO returns because the VC can imple-
ment needed changes or reject the investment proposal altogether. Generally, overcon-
ﬁdence has a negative effect on decision quality.
Therefore, it is important to apply the theories of biases and heuristics to reveal
the psychological processes (speciﬁcally those relating to overconﬁdence) DEMO govern
VCs in their assessments of new venture success. This increased understanding of VCs’
314
A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND D.A. SHEPHERD
cognition may provide important insights into DEMO decision quality. This study
investigates the following research questions: Are VCs DEMO? Does overconﬁ-
dence inﬂuence decision accuracy? Under what circumstances would we expect VCs to
exhibit greater levels of overconﬁdence?
The study proceeds DEMO follows: First the judgment/decision-making literature is re-
viewed and applied DEMO the nature of the venture capital investment decision and hypoth-
eses generated around the above research questions. Second, data-collection is dis-
cussed including a description of the sample and survey instrument used. Third, conjoint
analysis and analysis of variance are used to determine if the hypothesized factors do
DEMO overconﬁdence. Fourth, the results are reviewed and discussed in terms of DEMO
judgment/decision-making theory and our understanding of VCs’ decision-making. Fi-
nally, DEMO implications of this study for future research and for VCs and entrepreneurs
are discussed.
NATURE OF THE INVESTMENT DECISION
To assess the viability of DEMO investment proposal, VCs typically seek and compile infor-
mation. During the DEMO stage of the evaluation process, VCs study the entrepre-
neur’s business DEMO, which represents a compilation of information. If the proposal is
worthwhile, VCs gather and analyze more information in subsequent evaluation stages
(Tyebjee and Bruno 1984) before making the ﬁnal investment decision. Most studies
into VCs’ decision-making have investigated the information that VCs report they use
when assessing DEMO venture performance (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and
Bruno 1984; MacMillan, et al. 1985; MacMillan, et al. 1987; Robinson 1987)DEMO The pur-
pose of such studies is to tap into the expertise VCs appear to have in selecting those
new ventures that are going DEMO be “home runs”—highly proﬁtable investments.
Cognitive science suggests that researchers need to investigate more than just the
information content to understand the judgment being DEMO Researchers also need
to understand how that information is used to form a judgment. Biases, and in this case
the overconﬁdence bias, affect DEMO information is obtained and compiled in order to
make a judgment. As discussed above, the VC task is one that requires decisions be
made in a highly uncertain environment, placing a strain on information processing
capabilities and involving high levels of emotion and extreme time constraints. Baron
(1998) proposes that for such tasks we can expect a greater susceptibility to cognitive
errors. Moreover, Busenitz and Barney (1997) found that entrepreneurs are more prone
to biases, including overconﬁdence, than managers in large organizations. DEMO overconﬁ-
dence problematic for VCs as well?
Kunze (1990) argues that if VCs fully analyzed every potential investment, they
would never fund any ventures. In essence, the more a VC analyzes a potential invest-
ment, the more reasons (s)he will ﬁnd for the venture DEMO ultimately fail; paralysis by
analysis sets in. Moreover, as the number of VC ﬁrms and the size of their funds has
increased, VCs feel added pressure to make larger investments more quickly so that
they DEMO leverage the return on their fund (Kunze 1990). Kunze (1990) implies that VCs
face considerable time pressures and often have insufﬁcient time to complete a full anal-
ysis of each investment opportunity.
These time DEMO described by Kunze (1990) might be the reason for Ginger
More’s recent description of VCs as more like money managers than company builders
(More 1999) (Ginger More is a founder of the Oak Partners DEMO capital ﬁrm). If
INFORMATION AND OVERCONFIDENCE 315
VCs view themselves more as money managers than DEMO builders, they are more
likely to be overconﬁdent in their decision DEMO to choose the “right” investment
rather than be optimistically overconﬁdent in their ability to actively inﬂuence the out-
come of their decision (over and above the resources invested). Furthermore, as dis-
cussed in the introduction, overconﬁdence may hinder VC decision-making because it
impacts how VCs gather and use information. This discussion leads to the following
hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1A: VCs are overconﬁdent.
Hypothesis 1B: Overconﬁdence adversely affects decision accuracy.
The remaining hypotheses will explore contextual factors that we propose affect
the level of DEMO Overconﬁdence is operationalized as the person’s conﬁ-
dence level minus the accuracy of her/his decision (Mahajan 1992). Contextual factors
inﬂuence the decision environment thereby impacting a person’s conﬁdence level.
Moreover, contextual factors may make it more or less difﬁcult to derive a correct an-
swer; contextual factors impact accuracy. Therefore, contextual factors may inﬂuence
overconﬁdence (i.e., the context differentially affects conﬁdence and accuracy).
We propose that the nature DEMO the information being used to make a prediction
about future success differentially affects the level of conﬁdence and accuracy and there-
fore affects overconﬁdence. DEMO nature of information refers to the amount of informa-
tion, the DEMO (framing) of information, the VC’s historical information (experiences),
DEMO the vividness of the information to the VC. Each is now addressed and hypothe-
ses developed.
Amount of Information
Conﬁdence increases as the amount DEMO relevant information increases (Oskamp 1982;
Elstein and Bordage 1988). DEMO believe that more information improves
the accuracy of their decision, but DEMO does not signiﬁcantly change (Castellan
1977) and may even decrease (DEMO 1981). For example, Oskamp (1982) had 32 sub-
jects (8 psychologists, 18 graduate students and 6 undergraduates) evaluate a scenario
DEMO an individual seeking counseling. As more information became available, the partici-
DEMO became signiﬁcantly more conﬁdent (p 5 .001) across all expert levels (Oskamp
1982). However, accuracy in determining the correct prognosis did DEMO signiﬁcantly, nor
consistently, improve with more information. Zacharakis and Meyer (DEMO) found that
VCs’ decision accuracy actually decreased when they had more DEMO to assess
venture potential. Why would decision accuracy decrease?
One plausible explanation is that decision-makers utilize fewer cues than they think
they do (Brehmer and Brehmer 1988; Stewart 1988) ignoring the additional information
or DEMO some cases using it inappropriately. Zacharakis and Meyer (2000) suggest that
the decrease in accuracy might be a function of cognitive overload. Because DEMO is
more information to evaluate, VCs are drawn to the more DEMO information factors
and may ignore other factors that are more pertinent to the decision. Therefore, more
information does not lead to improved decision accuracy, just increased conﬁdence.
Since conﬁdence increases and accuracy decreases, overconﬁdence increases. DEMO
above discussion leads to hypothesis two:
316
A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND D.A. SHEPHERD
Hypothesis 2A: VCs with access to more information are more conﬁdent in their
decision than those with access DEMO less information.
Hypothesis 2B: VCs with access to more information are DEMO accurate in their de-
cision.
Hypothesis 2C: VCs with access to DEMO information are more overconﬁdent.
Framing of Information
People possess a multitude of mental models (Medin and Ross 1996; Rumelhart and
Ortnoy 1977), DEMO can be called into action depending upon the situation. Thus, when
DEMO VC perceives a somewhat familiar situation that requires action, an appropriate
DEMO model is summoned from long-term memory. In unfamiliar situations, the VC
DEMO a particular evaluation strategy (a mental model of how to approach DEMO situations)
to formulate the information into a mental model, which DEMO then manipulated to make
a decision. We propose that a VC’s perception of familiarity is, in part, determined by
how the investment proposal DEMO framed. If the investment is framed in terms of criteria
VCs believe are important predictors of performance then this situation will seem more
familiar DEMO the same new venture proposal framed in terms of criteria that are unfamil-
iar yet are as predictive (or more predictive) as the DEMO criteria. We propose VCs
are more conﬁdent with decisions based on information framed in a familiar way than
information framed in an unfamiliar way.
DEMO Judgment Theory (SJT) (Brunswik 1956) from cognitive psychology pro-
vides a framework for understanding how different types of information impact the deci-
DEMO process. SJT suggests that people make decisions using cognitive information fac-
tors or cues. Cognitive cues are decision criteria that expert VCs deem as DEMO
discriminating between success and failure. In other words, cognitive cues are DEMO in-
formation factors that VCs say they use to make a decision. Cognitive cues are how
VCs “frame” a decision. A multitude of studies DEMO identiﬁed a variety of important
cognitive cues (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan et
al. 1985, 1987; Robinson DEMO). Cognitive cues, however, may not be optimal in distin-
guishing between outcomes.
Task cues, on the other hand, are statistically derived DEMO those information factors
that best distinguish between possible outcomes. These cues are not necessarily in the
form with which the decision-maker is familiar or DEMO Task cues would be out-
side the VC’s typical “frame.” Roure and Keeley (1990), for example, derived task cues
for 38 high-tech DEMO from the Silicon Valley. The cues are completeness of team,
product superiority, and time to product development and buyer concentration. These
task cues are proxies for information that VCs deem important, but not in a format in
which VCs are necessarily familiar. For instance, team completeness is a measure of
how many ﬁve top management roles are ﬁlled at DEMO funding (Roure and Keeley 1990).
VCs, on the other hand, like to examine individual characteristics of the entrepreneurial
team (i.e., familiarity with market, past start-up experience, etc.). Thus, VCs may not
ﬁnd the parsimonious task cues complete or intuitively appealing. Therefore, using task
information may decrease VC conﬁdence in her/his decision and have a DEMO
effect on decision accuracy. For example, VCs using cognitive cues were DEMO to more
accurately predict success or failure of the new venture than those VCs that were re-
quired to use task cues—VCs using task DEMO were half as accurate (Zacharakis and
Meyer 2000).
INFORMATION AND OVERCONFIDENCE 317
We argue above that VCs are experts in DEMO new venture investment decisions
and they start with a high base level of conﬁdence. We propose that even if the form
(frame) of DEMO information changes and makes a decision much more difﬁcult, VCs’
conﬁdence DEMO “sticky” and they will make insufﬁcient adjustments in their conﬁdence
level to changes in decision accuracy. From a theoretical perspective, this “sticky” con-
ﬁdence level could be a function of an anchoring and adjustment bias.1 For DEMO,
VCs’ conﬁdence level for familiar information would represent an anchor for conﬁ-
dence, and when the form of the information changes decreasing accuracy there will
be an insufﬁcient downward adjustment in conﬁdence to compensate for DEMO decrease
in accuracy. In other words, “if a person’s beliefs are DEMO, biases that favor conserva-
tism generally will maintain positive illusions” (Taylor and Brown, 1988: 202). There-
fore, VCs using task cues will be more overconﬁdent. Hence:
Hypothesis 3A: VCs presented with task cues are less conﬁdent in their decisions
than VCs presented with cognitive DEMO
Hypothesis 3B: VCs presented with task cues are less accurate in DEMO decisions than
VCs presented with cognitive cues.
Hypothesis 3C: VCs presented DEMO task cues are more overconﬁdent in their deci-
sions than VCs presented with cognitive cues.
Personal Historical Information
Human behavior is a function of DEMO decisions (Nelson and Winter 1982). Hence, out-
comes of past decisions will inﬂuence the interpretation of information surrounding new
decisions. Experience, according to Hambrick and Mason (1984), affect one’s decision-
making. For example, Trumbo, Adams, Milner, and Schipper (1962) found experienced
judges DEMO be more conﬁdent, but not necessarily more accurate. As VCs gain DEMO,
they become more secure in their ability and eventually rely on an intuitive decision-
making process—a “gut” feeling as to whether a venture DEMO succeed or fail (Khan 1987;
MacMillan et al. 1987). DEMO intuitive decision-making may lead to a false sense of secu-
rity in that VCs believe they are fully evaluating all available information. Therefore,
DEMO propose that while accuracy may increase with experience, conﬁdence increases at
DEMO greater rate, and therefore experienced VCs will demonstrate more overconﬁdence
than DEMO less experienced counterparts. Hence:
Hypothesis 4A: The more experienced the DEMO, the more conﬁdent (s)he will be.
Hypothesis 4B: The DEMO experienced the VC, the more accurate (s)he will be.
Hypothesis 4C: The more experienced the VC, the more overconﬁdent (s)he will be.
Vividness of Information
The decision-maker’s past experience inﬂuences his perception DEMO future events. Those
situations that occur frequently are more salient and more available or easily recalled
to bear on current decisions (Tversky and Kahneman 1973; Bazerman 1994). This avail-
1 Slovic and Lichtenstein (1971) suggest that: (a) an arbitrarily chosen reference point (anchor) will
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence value estimates and (b) value estimates will be insufﬁciently DEMO away from the
reference point toward the true value of the object of estimation. This ﬁnding appears robust across a number
of contexts (Hogarth 1988; Northcraft and Neale 1987).
318
A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND D.A. SHEPHERD
ability heuristic often serves decision-makers well DEMO those events that occur more
frequently in our mind are often those that also occur more frequently in reality. How-
ever, this is not always the case. Factors other than the objective frequency of an event
DEMO affect the availability of information and these irrelevant inﬂuences may inappro-
priately affect VC judgment. For example, a VC’s recall of information is likely to be
affected by past events that are more vivid and evoke DEMO This might explain the
tendency of decision-makers to recall past successes rather than past failures (Dawes
1988; Dawes, Faust, and Meehl 1989); a VC’s successes may be more vivid and evoke
more emotion than failures, especially “home runs.” A “home run” that provides astro-
nomical returns and makes a portfolio successful is likely to be highly vivid in DEMO VC’s
mind. VC’s may view current prospects in terms of how well this investment matches
certain attributes of those past glories.
Tversky and Kahneman (1973) propose that the assessment of frequency or proba-
bility of an event is less likely to be affected by events that are unemotional DEMO nature,
difﬁcult to imagine, and/or vague. New ventures with DEMO performance (i.e., the
ﬂoating dead) may not evoke as much DEMO or be as easily recalled because those
that are either big winners or big losers. We know that successes and failures are less
common DEMO average performance.
Grifﬁn and Tversky (1992) propose that extremes of available evidence are likely
to be assessed with higher conﬁdence (holding all other things equal). Tversky and Kah-
neman (1974) suggest this leads DEMO overestimating unlikely events. We propose that the
implications for VC decision-making is that they will be more conﬁdent with success
predictions than failure predictions. DEMO predictions will have certain attributes that
match past “home runs”. However, DEMO will be more conﬁdent with success or failure
predictions than predictions of average performance. Just as “home runs” are vivid,
spectacular failures may DEMO be easily recalled. Thus, VCs may be more conﬁdent in
failure DEMO than moderate performance predictions because these ﬁrms exhibit
attributes that VCs recall from past failures. Moderate predictions may have one or
two attributes congruent DEMO a “home run” or dramatic failures, but other attributes
may not DEMO well with the VC’s mental model of success or failure, thereby DEMO
the venture ambiguous.
Although conﬁdence in success and failure predictions will be more vivid than mod-
erate predictions, we propose that success predictions will be more vivid than failure
predictions. People tend to attribute success to DEMO own actions, but failure to uncon-
trollable external events (Bettman and Weitz 1983). In fact, Zacharakis, Meyer, and
DeCastro (1999) ﬁnd that VCs attribute failed ventures to uncontrollable external fac-
tors (versus poor management). Thus, they rationalize that failure was beyond their
(DEMO the entrepreneur’s) control. On the other hand, Zacharakis et al. (DEMO) ﬁnd that
VCs attribute success to internal factors. Thus, success predictions are likely to be more
vivid than failure predictions.
Accuracy should improve DEMO with predictions at the extreme (i.e., success
or failure versus an assessment of moderate performance). Ventures at the extreme
better match past DEMO or failures; thus, VCs are using more appropriate mental
models for making those decisions. We propose that while conﬁdence will increase with
the DEMO of the information, accuracy increases at a greater rate. Therefore, VCs
will demonstrate less overconﬁdence when making decisions involving vivid informa-
tion, i.e., overconﬁdence is greater for failure (rather than success), for moderate (rather
than success), and for moderate (rather than failure). Hence:
INFORMATION AND OVERCONFIDENCE
319
Hypothesis 5A: VCs are more conﬁdent in success predictions than failure pre-
dictions.
Hypothesis 5B: VCs are more accurate in success predictions than failure pre-
dictions.
Hypothesis 5C: VCs are less overconﬁdent in success predictions than failure pre-
dictions.
Hypothesis 6A: VCs are more conﬁdent in success predictions than they are in mod-
erate performance predictions.
DEMO 6B: VCs are more accurate with success predictions than they are DEMO
moderate performance predictions.
Hypothesis 6C: VCs are less overconﬁdent in success DEMO than they are in
moderate performance predictions.
Hypothesis 7A: VCs are DEMO conﬁdent in failure predictions than they are in mod-
erate performance predictions.
Hypothesis 7B: VCs are more accurate with failure predictions than they are with
moderate performance predictions.
Hypothesis 7C: VCs are less overconﬁdent in failure predictions than they are in
moderate performance predictions.
In sum, due to the nature of a VC’s task, they will be overconﬁdent in their assess-
ments of venture potential and this overconﬁdence will adversely affect decision DEMO
racy. However, we hypothesize that the level of overconﬁdence depends on DEMO amount
of information, the framing of information, historical personal information (DEMO)
and the vividness of information. Speciﬁcally, VCs with greater access DEMO information,
presented with unfamiliar task cues, and who have considerable DEMO will be more
overconﬁdent than those with less information, presented familiar DEMO cues and
have less experience. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the vividness DEMO the information
(i.e., success, failure and moderate performance predictions) will also affect the level
of overconﬁdence—VCs are more overconﬁdent in failure predictions DEMO success pre-
dictions, as well as more overconﬁdent in moderate performance DEMO than in
success and failure predictions. The research method to empirically test the hypothe-
sized relationships is now described.
METHOD
A policy capturing experiment, a real-time method common in cognitive psychology,
was used on 53 DEMO to examine their investment decision process. Two of the 53 partici-
pants were removed (one because the PC crashed during the exercise and the other
because he did not wish to continue past the ﬁrst few DEMO). The participating VCs
were from two entrepreneurial hotbeds, Denver/Boulder DEMO the Silicon Valley. Ap-
pendix A details the sample demographics.
Each of the participants made 50 investment decisions using from four to eight
information DEMO depending upon treatment (see Table 1). The cognitive cues in
DEMO 1 and 2 were derived from previous post hoc research (Wells DEMO; Poindex-
ter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan et al. DEMO; MacMillan et al. 1987; Rob-
inson 1987). Cue frequency across studies and reported importance within each study
were the criteria for including DEMO particular cue in the experiment. Additionally, cues
that were highly correlated DEMO other cues were removed (Lewis, Patton, and Green

1988) retaining the cue that DEMO deemed most important in the literature. A consulting
expert VC also veriﬁed that the retained cue was valid and important. Although the
list is DEMO exhaustive, it is more probable that the identiﬁed cues in this DEMO include
unimportant factors rather than exclude important factors, because experts typically
DEMO far more cues than they actually use (Stewart 1988).
Treatment DEMO (the Base Cognitive Cues Treatment) presented ﬁve information cues
commonly cited in past VC decision-making studies. Treatment 2 (Additional Cognitive
Cues Treatment) DEMO the effect of added information; it used the original ﬁve cues
DEMO three others. Treatment 3 (Task Cues Treatment) investigated how the VCs reacted
to information cues that supposedly best distinguish between ultimate success and DEMO
ure. Unlike the previous two treatments, Treatment 3 cues were those DEMO de-
rived (by Roure and Keeley 1990). As such, these cues were not in a form with which
the VC was familiar. DEMO were sent letters asking them to participate. Once they agreed,
they were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments.
Decision scenarios were DEMO once the pertinent cues had been identiﬁed. Coop-
erative VCs outside the sample of the study (primarily VCs based in Chicago and the
East Coast) provided actual investment decision scenarios. A stipulation for using the
actual cases was that the entrepreneur, venture, and any associated ﬁrms or DEMO
remain unidentiﬁed. Such a provision does not impede this study in any way. In fact,
identifying the venture or entrepreneur might bias the DEMO decisions. For exam-
ple, personal knowledge of an entrepreneur’s reputation might DEMO the subjects to judge
that case without fully evaluating other supplied information. Products also are not iden-
tiﬁed, because many of the actual ventures included products identiﬁed with unique
ﬁrms. Moreover, identifying the product might also narrow the available sample size.
A VC may be hesitant to make DEMO decision about a biotechnology ﬁrm if (s)he specializes
in computer DEMO storage. Although a proposed venture may not ﬁt a particular VC
ﬁrm’s investment criteria, VCs within those ﬁrms often screen such ventures and, DEMO they
have potential, refer them to a more suitable VC. For DEMO same reasons, ﬁnancial cues

are not included in this experiment. Different VCs DEMO different hurdle rates. Since this
experiment focuses on the screening stage it is appropriate to minimize any preset biases
regarding unique ﬁrm investment criteria (i.e., industry, etc.).
Value ranges given to each cue allow DEMO to be compared across scenarios (Stewart
1988). Concrete values are DEMO (e.g., market size) for cue values when possible, but
purely representative distributions are appropriate for subjective cues (Stewart 1988).
A uniform coding system for subjective information factors allows consistent coding
across the business DEMO used in building the experiment. For instance, the subjective
information factors DEMO the Cognitive Cue Treatments were rated on a ﬁve-point
scale. For example, the proprietary product cue value rated from 1 (lowest protection)
DEMO 5 (highest protection). Likewise, competitor strength was also rated on a ﬁve-point
scale. Within the Task Cue Treatment, Roure and Keeley’s (DEMO) subjective rating scale
was used.
The lead researcher pulled information factors DEMO the business plans of the actual
cases. To ensure inter-judge reliability, DEMO colleague unfamiliar with the business plans
or their outcomes also coded all appropriate cues. The lead researcher provided the
second coder with the entire DEMO and description of the information factors of interest.
Overall inter-judge reliability equates to 87.5%. Berelson (1952) reports that inter-
judge reliability typically ranges DEMO 66 to 95%. As such, the coding is deemed reliable.
A DEMO to further decrease multicolinearity while maintaining strong external
validity is to combine actual and statistically derived cases. A random case generator
from Policy PC DEMO package (Stewart 1991) creates a manageable number of statis-
tically derived cases. MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) veriﬁes that the
statistical cases DEMO from the same population as the actual cases. The independent vari-
ables (decision cues used in the three treatments) have equal variance between DEMO and
generated cases, and the multivariate means are equivalent. Furthermore, a consulting
expert VC identiﬁed those cases that were not feasible (i.e., DEMO of cue values
that rarely occurs in reality). Unfeasible scenarios were dropped from the sample of
potential candidates.
The investment decisions were presented DEMO a notebook computer brought directly
to the VC’s ofﬁce. VCs were assigned to the three treatments with 20 VCs completing
Treatment 1, 17 completing Treatment 2, and 14 completing Treatment 3.
After the VCs viewed each decision case, they gauged how likely the potential ven-
ture was to succeed on a seven-point scale—7 equated to very likely to succeed and DEMO
equated to very unlikely to succeed. Next, the participants recorded their DEMO
in their success assessment using another seven-point scale. The conﬁdence scale was
anchored by high conﬁdence (the venture exhibits all of the characteristics of a resound-
ing success/failure) and low conﬁdence (no more conﬁdent DEMO venture will succeed or
fail than in predicting a head or a tails in a coin ﬂip). In sum, the conﬁdence level that
the VC records should equate with the expected outcome of the venture. DEMO VC clicks
7 if (s)he is certain that the venture DEMO either succeed or fail. If, on the other hand,
the DEMO is so ambiguous that the VC cannot accurately gauge whether the ven-
ture will succeed or fail, (s)he clicks 1. A pre-experiment DEMO requested both
personal and ﬁrm characteristics including years of experience in the venture capi-
tal industry.
To assess the base level of overconﬁdence, the predictive ability (accuracy) for each
VC was calculated as the proportion DEMO correct VC responses (i.e., a comparison of the
predicted performance with actual performance). Because the exercise included 25 ac-
322 A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND D.A. SHEPHERD
tual funded ventures that had achieved DEMO outcome (i.e., venture harvested with some
return or failed providing no return on investment), we can compare participating VC
predictions with the DEMO actual outcome. Coding of the VC response to success
or failure was conducted as follows: 5 to 7 (success probability is high), DEMO (VC is unsure
or doesn’t know), 1 to 3 (failure probability is high). Likert responses of 4 were not
included in DEMO analysis. When measuring actual outcomes, a venture was considered
a success DEMO it had a return on investment of 15% or greater (Dean DEMO Giglierano 1990).
The venture was coded a failure if its return was less than 15%2. The number of correct
predictions out of the DEMO number of possible ventures was the accuracy rate. Although
lots of things can inﬂuence a venture’s ultimate success after funding (i.e., changes in
DEMO conditions, management decisions, VC involvement, etc.), Roure and Keeley
(1990) assert that the initial investment decision is highly correlated with venture out-
come. In other words, ultimate venture success is predictable from characteristics of the
new venture at prefunding, such as the quality of the entrepreneurial team, the nature of
opportunity, and potential market growth.
Conﬁdence, accuracy and overconﬁdence were only measured using the 25 cases
derived from DEMO ventures, not the 25 statistically generated cases. The appropriate-
ness of DEMO VC’s conﬁdence (overconﬁdence, under-conﬁdence, or perfect calibration)
is determined DEMO comparing the “conﬁdence in the accuracy of a prediction” with the
“accuracy of prediction” (Mahajan 1992). An individual is overconﬁdent when their
conﬁdence is signiﬁcantly higher than their accuracy rate. Under-conﬁdence represents
a conﬁdence level DEMO one’s accuracy.
To analyze the data, an overconﬁdence index was calculated. DEMO represents a ratio
of conﬁdence over accuracy. Conﬁdence is measured as a mean of conﬁdence ratings
for that person and converted to a percentage (i.e., from a scale out of 7 to a scale out of
100). Accuracy was measured as the percentage of accurate predictions for DEMO person.
Therefore, we had an overconﬁdence index for each VC. If DEMO overconﬁdence index
was one then the person was appropriately calibrated, i.e., their conﬁdence is appro-
priate for their level of accuracy. An index DEMO one indicated under-conﬁdence, and
an index was above one represented overconﬁdence.
DEMO hypotheses 2, 3, and 5 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was used to determine
if the differences hypothesized were signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 3 used DEMO VCs that used
cognitive cues. To test Hypotheses 6 and 7, DEMO following were calculated: (a) conﬁdence
level, (b) accuracy level, and (c) overconﬁdence index for each person for all three levels
of success predictions—success, failure, and moderate performance predictions. Again
ANOVA was DEMO to determine if the differences were signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 4, like
hypothesis DEMO, used regression analysis.
To compare conﬁdence in success predictions with conﬁdence DEMO failure predic-
tions, each individual’s mean conﬁdence for predictions of success (scores of 5, 6, or
7 on the seven-point scale) was matched with that individual’s conﬁdence in their failure
predictions (scores of 1, 2, or 3 on the seven-point scale).
RESULTS
The mean DEMO index across all VCs was 2.91 with a standard deviation of
2.42—on average, VCs are overconﬁdent. Figure 1 demonstrates that 96% of the partici-

FIGURE 1
Scatterplot of conﬁdence against accuracy.
pating DEMO have a conﬁdence level that is greater than their accuracy rate, DEMO, VCs’
conﬁdence in their predictions are above the diagonal line (the diagonal line represents
perfect calibration—the appropriate level of conﬁdence). ANOVA indicates DEMO VCs’
conﬁdence is signiﬁcantly higher than their accuracy (p 5 0.0001)DEMO This provides support
for Hypothesis 1A—VCs are overconﬁdent.
So what if VCs are overconﬁdent? We have argued using theory that overconﬁ-
dence could have a detrimental effect on accuracy. We used regression analysis to ana-
lyze DEMO effect of overconﬁdence (using the overconﬁdence index) on accuracy (percent-
DEMO of predictions that were accurate). If everyone were perfectly calibrated, DEMO the
overconﬁdence index would explain none of the variance in accuracy.
The results for hypothesis 1B and hypotheses 2–7 are presented in Table 2. DEMO 2
demonstrates that the level of overconﬁdence signiﬁcantly predicted accuracy (p DEMO
0.000). An R 2 of 0.496 indicates that almost half of the variance in accuracy amongst
VCs can be explained by their differences DEMO overconﬁdence. The regression coefﬁcient
was negative indicating that the higher the VC’s overconﬁdence, the lower the decision
accuracy. The correlation between overconﬁdence and accuracy is -0.704. This provides
support for hypothesis 1B.
The majority of hypotheses DEMO supported (see Table 2). The amount of informa-
tion and DEMO of information (cognitive cue or task cue) affected VC decision-making as
expected. However, Hypothesis 2A, which suggested that more information would in-
DEMO VC conﬁdence, is not supported (although in the expected direction). Nonetheless,
more information had a signiﬁcantly negative impact on accuracy (p 5 0.020). Thus, more
information leads to higher overconﬁdence (p DEMO 0.027). The type of information also im-
pacts conﬁdence, accuracy DEMO overconﬁdence, although Hypothesis 3A, which suggests
task cues lead to decreased conﬁdence, received only marginal support (p 5 0.087).

DISCUSSION
This study used theory from the judgment/decision-making literature to investigate the
factors that affect DEMO presence and/or magnitude of overconﬁdence bias for VCs as-
sessing likely new venture success. Consistent with this literature, the current study
found VCs were overconﬁdent. Furthermore, the level of overconﬁdence did vary de-
pending on the amount of information provided and how that information was framed.
Such DEMO provided the opportunity to use theory to help us understand which
factors affect VC overconﬁdence and why. For example, VCs’ overconﬁdence is higher
(DEMO) for task cues (unfamiliar cues) than for cognitive cues (familiar cues), (b) for failure
predictions than for success predictions, and (c) for moderate performance predictions
than for success and failure predictions.
DEMO ﬁndings that suggest VCs are more overconﬁdent with decisions utilizing unfa-
miliar decision cues (as expected) result from their decrease in decision accuracy DEMO
greater than the decrease in conﬁdence (an insufﬁcient downward adjustment of DEMO
dence to reﬂect the substantial decrease in accuracy). The fact that VCs are more conﬁ-
dent when using cognitive cues is consistent with DEMO that suggests VCs are intuitive
decision-makers (Khan 1987; McMillan et al. 1987). When people are familiar with a
decision and the structure DEMO the information surrounding that decision, they resort to
an automatic information DEMO style (Koriat, Lichtenstein, and Fischhoff 1980).
On the other DEMO, if information surrounding the decision is structured in an unfamiliar
way, people need to decipher what each piece of information means and how DEMO im-
pacts their overall decision (Shiffrin and Schneider 1977). In DEMO case of expert VCs,
that means they must deviate from their intuitive style. It seems that forcing them out-
side their “comfort zone” DEMO a negative affect on their conﬁdence and has an even
greater affect (negative) on their accuracy.
While there is evidence to suggest that DEMO are susceptible to an availability bias
(i.e., making a decision about a current venture on the basis of how it matches past
successful DEMO failed funded ventures), VCs are less overconﬁdent with their success pre-
dictions than with all other predictions (as hypothesized).
Hypothesis 4, DEMO suggests that greater experience leads to greater overconﬁ-
dence, was not DEMO A possible explanation is that VCs progress up the learning
curve rapidly. After a year or so as an associate, the VC may already be conﬁdent in
their ability. They may also already be intuitive decision-makers.
DEMO Implications for VCs
The ﬁndings of this study suggest that VCs are overconﬁdent. The practical implications
of such overconﬁdence may be an overreliance on DEMO knowledge resulting in only
326
A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND D.A. SHEPHERD
a limited information search instead of DEMO additional information (Mahajan 1992).
This may result in backing ventures DEMO should not have been funded and/or passing
on opportunities that should have been grasped. Recognition of the overconﬁdence bias
represents an opportunity for DEMO to improve their decision accuracy—they can more
carefully scrutinize those “high risk of overconﬁdence” decisions with the goals of reduc-
ing the negative implications DEMO with the overconﬁdence bias. We propose a
number of techniques that reduce automatic processing, force VCs to more critically
analyze key pieces of information, and possibly reduce overconﬁdence (and potentially
other biases). It should DEMO pointed out that through trial and error many VC ﬁrms al-
ready use one or more of these techniques. We propose that the use DEMO counterfactual
thinking, the “humbling effect,” and decision aids are potentially DEMO most useful tech-
niques—they are brieﬂy described below.
First, VCs can DEMO counterfactual reasoning (Fischhoff and MacGregor 1982;
Mahajan 1992; Russo and Schoemaker 1992). Counterfactual reasoning refers to imag-
ining scenarios where the DEMO decision assumptions might not hold. What factors
might suggest that the present decision is incorrect? Has all the available information
been correctly analyzed? DEMO there additional information that has yet to be uncovered?
Might it suggest a different “story,” one of venture failure? Many VC ﬁrms have weekly
meetings where each VC gives a status report of the DEMO that (s)he is considering.
Arkes, Christensen, Lai, and Blumer (1987) suggest that this exercise of justifying one’s
decision in front DEMO a group will force counterfactual information to be addressed.
Whether the individual VC develops counterfactual information himself or whether col-
leagues raise counterfactual scenarios, this questioning of the reasons behind a decision
should decrease overconﬁdence and DEMO decision quality.
Second, VCs can use the “humbling effect” (Mahajan 1992; Russo and Schoemaker
1992). The humbling effect refers to receiving negative feedback from past decisions.
Unfortunately for VCs, the ultimate source of feedback (whether a venture succeeds
or fails) typically takes years to come DEMO Delayed feedback makes it more difﬁcult for
decision-makers to learn from their mistakes (Shanteau 1992). As time passes, decision-
makers suffer from DEMO hoc rationalizations and recall biases (Barr, Stimpert, and Huff
1992; Sandberg, Schweiger, and Hofer 1988). One method that VCs can DEMO to increase
the effect of feedback is to keep a record (DEMO and MacGregor 1982), or “score-
card” of what criteria they considered when initially making the decision. Comparing
scorecards of successful and failed ventures DEMO potentially a great learning tool and could
reduce overconﬁdence in future decisions. However, follow-up discussion with the VCs
in this study found that only 24% utilize such tools.
Finally, VCs can use actuarial decision aides (DEMO and Bordage 1988). An actu-
arial model decomposes decisions into component parts and then optimally combines
relevant information to derive an answer. Thus, an actuarial model of the VC’s decision
forces the VC to systematically DEMO each component independently and then com-
bine these independent analyses to obtain an investment decision. Zacharakis and
Meyer (2000) found that actuarial decision DEMO signiﬁcantly improve decision effective-
ness of VCs. Improvement in the investment decision may in part be attributed to a
reduction in the VCs’ overconﬁdence. DEMO empirical investigation of the effect that the
use of decision aids has on the level of overconﬁdence would be an important re-
search pursuit.
DEMO sum, VCs, as do all expert decision-makers, need to be DEMO of the threat of
overconﬁdence and the associated reduction in decision quality. We propose to VCs that

awareness that you are likely to be overconﬁdent and, second, through applying some
of the above techniques to reduce the negative impact DEMO the bias.
Limitations of Study
This study utilizes policy capturing as its primary technique for empirical analysis. As
with any technique there are limitations. DEMO of these limitations and the means by
which they were addressed are now described. One such issue might be that the informa-
tion within DEMO decision exercise does not perfectly mirror the “real life” decision. Such
“paper tests” affect the external validity of many lens model experiments (Brehmer
and Brehmer 1988). Nevertheless, policy-capturing experiments are still a valid method
for deriving what information decision-makers actually use (Stewart 1993). Brown
(1972) ﬁnds that under even the most contrived cases, the decisions reﬂect actual deci-
sions. Moreover, because the VC decision has a large “paper” component in the real
world (i.e., much of the VC’s information comes DEMO business plans), correlation be-
tween the experimental task and the “real world” decision should be higher than most
policy capturing studies.
Coded cues DEMO eliminate perceptual elements from the task, pushing it into a
more DEMO domain and placing less emphasis on judges’ ability to extract cue in-
formation (Brehmer and Brehmer 1988). VCs’ real decision environment is information
rich and often captured in voluminous business plans. For practical purposes, a full exec-
utive summary of a business plan could not be presented, and the number of cues needed
to be reduced. The cues chosen DEMO justiﬁed by numerous VCs’ decision-making studies,
and discussions with VCs, DEMO, and academics indicate that the instrument
has face validity. We propose DEMO this limitation was more likely to increase the chance
of rejecting this study’s hypotheses. For example, maybe the additional three cues pre-
sented in Treatment 2 were not a sufﬁciently strong manipulation of an increase in DEMO
mation (not sufﬁciently representative of the information load sometimes facing a DEMO).
Thus, the current design could be considered a conservative test DEMO the impact of infor-
mation on conﬁdence.
Future Research Opportunities
There are a number of research opportunities that arise from this study. For example,DEMO
can VCs use the information in this study (namely, VCs are overconﬁdent and that over-
conﬁdence negatively affects accuracy) to improve their decision process (i.e., reduce
the level of overconﬁdence or employ people who DEMO less overconﬁdent)? Judgment/
decision-making scholars would likely respond in the afﬁrmative, and we have described
techniques that may be used to reduce overconﬁdence. Alternatively, is there greater
complexity in the relationship between overconﬁdence and a VC’s performance?
Maybe overconﬁdence is not always dysfunctional. Maybe the DEMO between
conﬁdence and a VC’s performance is not linear but an inverted U shape where the
optimal level of conﬁdence is not perfect calibration DEMO at some other level of overcon-
ﬁdence.
Busenitz and Barney (1997) propose that optimistic overconﬁdence is useful for
entrepreneurship; otherwise they might not start the business. If entrepreneurs fully
evaluated all available information, they might miss the “window of opportunity” or
328
A.L. ZACHARAKIS AND D.A. SHEPHERD
freeze from “paralysis by analysis.” Moreover, a more “rational” decision process might
increase the perceived risk of a DEMO venture and lead VCs to reject many promising
ventures. This discussion leads to the following research question: Is there an optimal
level of overconﬁdence?
Although optimistic overconﬁdence likely increases the VC’s proclivity to fund
new DEMO and work hard to make sure those funded ventures succeed, reducing DEMO
negative effect of overconﬁdence may increase decision quality without unduly dimin-
ishing the VCs faith in funded ventures. In other words, implementing some of the tech-
niques for reducing overconﬁdence cited earlier should improve decision quality, which
in turn should give the VC greater faith in her/his DEMO and generate some of the
positives of optimistic overconﬁdence without the negative effects of systematic biases.
This discussion leads to some intriguing research questions: Do VCs who use techniques
that reduce overconﬁdence make better decisions? Do these VCs reject more venture
proposals? Is their commitment as measured by active involvement in funded ventures
less than their peers who do not DEMO overconﬁdence reducing techniques?
CONCLUSION
VCs are commonly recognized as experts in predicting new venture success. However,
this paper indicates that VC investment DEMO are biased by overconﬁdence. This
overconﬁdence negatively affects decision accuracy. Overconﬁdence varies with the
amount, form, and vividness of the information used in DEMO decision. Speciﬁcally, VC
overconﬁdence increases with more information, unfamiliar framing of information,
and also with moderate performance predictions relative to all other DEMO extreme
(more vivid) predictions, and with failure predictions relative to DEMO success predic-
tions. VC overconﬁdence will likely lead to a reduced information search, decreased
motivation for self-improvement, and the funding of inappropriate ventures. DEMO
of overconﬁdence bias provides a basis for improving the quality of VCs’ invest-
ment decisions.
