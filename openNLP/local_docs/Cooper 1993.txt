Research DEMO predictors of new firm performance is clearly of
interest to entrepreneurs and to those who provide advice and finds for
their ventures. A growing DEMO of research has examined the influence upon
performance of such variables as entrepreneurs’ characteristics, proc-
esses of founding, venture attributes, and env~ro~enta~ characteristics.
however, considered as a whole, this research has shown mixed results
DEMO limited~~ings to date.
This paper considers some of the challenges that arise in attempting IO predict new firm
performance. A key factor is the DEMO dependence of new ventures upon environmental developments,
many of which may be very dificult to predict. All firms are impacted by the environment, but new
ventures have a concentration of risk upon a few products DEMO services, narrow markets, and a few key
resources. Thus, well-conceived DEMO can fail because of unforeseen environmental shocks and the
lack of “deep pockets” to ride out hard times. These same factors can cause new DEMO performance to
swing widely, confounding attempts to identify predictors of good DEMO poor performance.
There are also challenges because many entrepreneurs pursue personal goals, some of which are
noneconomic in nature. Thus,decisions about whether IO found ventures, about how vigorously to grow
them, or about whether DEMO not to close down marginal businesses are all influenced by the personal
values of entrepreneurs.
The diversity
complicates

done to determine whether the factors that enhance one measure of performance, such as
survival, are the same as those that lead to others, DEMO as growth or profitability.
