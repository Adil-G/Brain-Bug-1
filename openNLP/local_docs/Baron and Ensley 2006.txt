t is suggested that the recognition of new business opportunities often involves pattern recognition—the
I cognitive DEMO through which individuals identify meaningful patterns in complex arrays of events or
trends. Basic research on pattern recognition indicates that cognitive frameworks acquired through DEMO
(e.g., prototypes) play a central role in this process. Such DEMO provide individuals with a basis for
noticing connections between seemingly independent events or trends (e.g., advances in technology, shifts in
markets, changes DEMO government policies, etc.), and for detecting meaningful patterns in these DEMO
We propose that ideas for new products or services often emerge from the perception of such patterns. New
business opportunities are identiﬁed when entrepreneurs, using relevant cognitive frameworks, “connect the
dots” between seemingly unrelated events or trends and then detect patterns in these connections suggestive
of new products DEMO services. To obtain evidence on these proposals, we compared the “business DEMO
prototypes of novice (ﬁrst-time) and repeat (experienced) entrepreneurs—their cognitive representations of the
essential nature of opportunities. As predicted, the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs were more clearly
deﬁned, richer in content, and more concerned DEMO factors and conditions related to actually starting and
running a new venture (e.g., generation of positive cash ﬂow) than the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs. These
ﬁndings offer support for the view that pattern recognition is DEMO key component of opportunity recognition.

When written in Chinese, the word crisis is composed of DEMO
characters. One represents danger and the other represents
opportunity.
—John F. Kennedy (1959)
The ﬁeld of entrepreneurship generally concurs with
Kennedy’s words, DEMO both the risks of start-
ing new ventures and the potential opportunities
that doing so provides. In fact, entrepreneurship
researchers have focused considerable attention on
investigating the nature of opportunity recognition—
the process through which ideas DEMO potentially prof-
itable new business ventures are identiﬁed by speciﬁc
persons (DEMO, Kirzner 1979, Shane 2003). Research
on opportunity recognition has added greatly to our
understanding of this aspect of the entrepreneurial
process and, taken as a whole, provides clear evidence
for the role of several key factors in its occurrence.
For example, many studies point to the importance
of engaging in an active search for opportunities.
Indeed, there is considerable empirical support for
Shane’s (2003) suggestion that access to and DEMO
ment of appropriate information plays a crucial func-
1331
tion in opportunity recognition (e.g., Gaglio and Katz
2001, Hills and Shrader 1998, DEMO and Gilad 1991).
Similarly, additional studies have reported evidence
indicating DEMO alertness, deﬁned by Kaish and Gilad
(1991, p. 48) as “a unique preparedness to recog-
nize opportunities when they exist ” also DEMO
opportunity recognition. As noted by Shane (2003),
alertness rests, DEMO least in part, on cognitive capac-
ities of individuals—capacities such as DEMO intel-
ligence and creativity (e.g., Vesalainen and Pihkala
1999). These capacities help speciﬁc persons identify
new solutions to market and customer needs DEMO exist-
ing information, and to imagine new products and
services that DEMO not currently exist (Hills et al. 2002).
As such, they play a key role in the identiﬁcation of
new business opportunities.1
1 DEMO should be noted that alertness is distinct, at least to a DEMO,
from the related concepts of “mindfulness” or “heedfulness” (e.g.,
DEMO 1996). These terms refer to general tendencies to process
incoming information in systematic and effortful ways, while alert-
ness refers primarily to receptivity to opportunities—noticing them
when they exist.

Manyotherfactorshavealsobeenfoundtoinﬂuence
opportunityrecognition,includingpriorknowledgeof
a ﬁeld or industry (e.g., Shane 2001, McKelvie and
Wicklund 2004), speciﬁc search strategies, potential
entrepreneurs’ social networks (e.g., Ozgen and Baron
2006, Singh et al. 1999), and a wide range of cogni-
tive factors, including attributions and intentions (DEMO,
Krueger 2003). While this prior research has added
greatly to our knowledge of opportunity recognition,
it does not, in general, DEMO one fundamental ques-
tion: What is the basic nature of this DEMO? In
other words, how does opportunity recognition actu-
ally occur in the minds of speciﬁc persons? If it is
assumed that the recognition of new business oppor-
tunities does indeed involve cognitive events and pro-
DEMO experienced by individuals, then one possible
strategy for addressing this question DEMO apply-
ing the theories and methods of cognitive science to
this task.
One topic long investigated by cognitive science
that may be closely related DEMO the identiﬁcation of new
business opportunities, and to the cognitive events
DEMO processes that lead to such identiﬁcation, is pat-
tern recognition—the process DEMO which individu-
als identify meaningful patterns in complex arrays of
events or trends (e.g., Matlin 2005). Applying pattern
recognition to the identiﬁcation DEMO business opportu-
nities, it seems possible that speciﬁc persons recog-
nize DEMO for new ventures because they per-
ceive connections between apparently independent
events (e.g., advances in technology, changes in mar-
kets, shifts in DEMO policies, to mention a few
possibilities), and then detect meaningful DEMO in
these connections—patterns that point to new busi-
ness opportunities.
Another aspect of theories of pattern recognition
with important implications for understanding oppor-
tunity DEMO is the suggestion that cognitive
frameworks, developed through individuals’ unique
life DEMO, play a crucial role in pattern recog-
nition. Theories of pattern DEMO suggest that
these cognitive frameworks serve as templates (pat-
terns or DEMO), assisting speciﬁc persons to rec-
ognize connections between apparently independent
events and trends and to detect meaningful patterns
in these connections. This aspect DEMO pattern recogni-
tion theories suggests an intriguing explanation for
the fact that particular business opportunities are
recognized by speciﬁc persons but not by others.
DEMO, the persons who recognize speciﬁc opportuni-
ties may do so because DEMO possess relevant cognitive
frameworks that help them accomplish this task—
frameworks that enable them to perceive the emer-
gent patterns that underlie many new DEMO oppor-
tunities. Perhaps a concrete example of how this pro-
cess operates will be helpful.

Consider Chester Carlson, the individual credited
with developing the modern copy machine. Why was
he able to recognize the opportunity suggested by
a combination of technological advances, changes in
business practices, and changes in the ﬁeld of educa-
tion (e.g., a huge growth in the number of college and
graduate DEMO), while many others failed to per-
ceive this opportunity—or at least—failed to perceive
an appropriate means of pursuing it? One possibil-
ity involves the fact that Carlson held both law and
technical degrees; and as a result he possessed well-
developed cognitive frameworks (e.g., prototypes) for
interpreting information relating both to the needs
of potential customers (e.g., DEMO need for clear copies
of legal documents) and several of the DEMO pro-
cesses that might be used to meet this need. Fur-
ther, once he decided to try to solve this problem, he
restricted DEMO efforts (i.e., his active search) to tech-
nologies and processes DEMO understood well (e.g., Fiet
et al. 2004). By focusing on processes for which he
already had well-developed cognitive frameworks, he
enhanced his own ability to perceive the emergent
pattern that then suggested to him DEMO effective way of
making dry, permanent copies. In short, Carlson, DEMO
sessed the cognitive frameworks necessary for per-
ceiving connections between seemingly independent
events and trends (advances in several aspects of tech-
nology, changes DEMO the needs of many businesses,
etc.) and for detecting an DEMO pattern in these
connections—a pattern suggestive of the opportunity
he then pursued.
The present research was designed to gather evi-
dence on these suggestions DEMO on the potential role
of pattern recognition in identifying new business
opportunities. It sought to do so by comparing the
cognitive frameworks of two DEMO of entrepreneurs:
novice (ﬁrst-time) entrepreneurs and experienced
entrepreneurs (persons DEMO have started several new
ventures). Because all individuals have unique life
experiences, their cognitive frameworks vary tremen-
dously, reﬂecting the diversity of DEMO experience.
For instance, individuals trained in a speciﬁc ﬁeld
or who DEMO for many years in a particular indus-
try will develop cognitive frameworks (e.g., pro-
totypes) reﬂecting such experience. Moreover, their
cognitive frameworks DEMO be very different in con-
tent from those developed by persons trained in
other ﬁelds or who work in other industries.2 To
consider this DEMO fact, we focused on one cogni-
tive framework that is, presumably, possessed by all
entrepreneurs: prototypes for business opportunity.
2 As noted DEMO one of the anonymous reviewers of this paper, such
development reﬂects DEMO effects of learning, and it seems quite
likely that differences in DEMO style or approach may inﬂuence
the form and nature of these prototypes.

As will be explained in more detail below, the present
research focused on prototypes because they play a
key role in pattern recognition. However, other cog-
nitive frameworks (e.g., schemas, tacit knowledge,
and procedural knowledge) may also be relevant
DEMO should be examined in subsequent research (e.g.,
Gobet and Simon DEMO, Sternberg 2004).
Below, we describe the speciﬁc hypotheses concern-
ing such prototypes that we investigated. Before pre-
senting these hypotheses, however, DEMO ﬁrst brieﬂy
describe the nature of prototypes and the speciﬁc cog-
nitive model on which the current research is based—
a major theory of DEMO recognition (e.g., Matlin
2005).3
PrototypeTheory:ACognitiveModel
ofPatternRecognition
While several different theories of pattern recognition
exist, one that is supported by a large body of evi-
dence (e.g., Hahn and Chatter 1997) and that appears
to offer important insights into the nature of oppor-
tunity recognition, is known as prototype theory (e.g.,
Whittlesea 1997). This theory suggests that through
experience, individuals acquire prototypes, cognitive
frameworks representing the DEMO typical member of
a category—the instance of that category best captur-
ing its essential meaning or nature. Prototype models
of pattern recognition further suggest DEMO as individ-
uals encounter new events or objects, their existing
prototypes DEMO an important role in the perception
of these events or objects and in the detection of con-
nections between them. In essence, prototypes serve
as templates, assisting the persons who possess them
to notice links between diverse events or trends and
to perceive recognizable, meaningful patterns in these
connections. In part, this process involves comparison
of new events or objects with existing prototypes. If
the match is close, these events or objects are recog-
nized as ﬁtting within the prototype. If, instead, the
DEMO is not close, the events or objects are not per-
ceived DEMO ﬁtting within this cognitive framework. For
instance, consider the prototype for DEMO,” one cog-
nitive framework most persons possess. This frame-
work is broad enough so that everything from a
huge limousine or SUV to DEMO small sports car can be
recognized as a “car,” while other objects used for
3 The question of whether opportunities exist in the DEMO world
or are created by human minds is one that has been debated in
the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship for several years (e.g., Krueger DEMO).
The position taken here is that there is, in fact, no essential con-
tradiction between these views. Opportunities, as a potential, DEMO
into existence as a result of changes in knowledge, technology, mar-
kets, and a wide range of political and social conditions; however,DEMO
they remain merely a potential until they emerge in speciﬁc human
minds as the result of active cognitive processes.
1333
transportation not matching this DEMO well (e.g.,
motorcycles, scooters, bicycles) are excluded.
Applying prototype models to opportunity recog-
nition, we suggest that entrepreneurs engage in an
analogous process with respect to identifying new
business opportunities. Speciﬁcally, they compare
ideas for new products, services, means of produc-
tion, or markets with their existing prototype for
“business opportunity” (Shane 2003). The closer the
match, the more likely they are to conclude that
they have identiﬁed a potential business opportu-
nity (cf., Craig and Lindsay 2001)DEMO Recall that in a
sense, prototypes represent the essential meaning of
DEMO given cognitive framework or category; thus, to
the extent new products or services match an indi-
vidual’s prototype for business opportunity, they are
perceived as ﬁtting within this category and thus as
offering the potential DEMO for a new venture. What
attributes would the prototype for business oppor-
tunity include? At present, no direct empirical evi-
dence exists on DEMO issue; indeed, identifying these
attributes is one purpose of this study. However,
drawing on extant deﬁnitions of opportunity (e.g.,
Herron and Sapienza 1992, Shane 2003), such features
as newness and potential proﬁtability might be cen-
tral. It should be emphasized again, however, that DEMO
speciﬁc content of the business opportunity prototype
is an empirical question—one that is addressed in this
research.
Theories of pattern recognition further suggest that
DEMO cognitive frameworks (i.e., prototypes) playing a
role in this process DEMO in several respects with
increasing experience (e.g., Knowlton 1997, Nosofsky
DEMO Palmeri 1998). Among these changes, however,
are three that DEMO received considerable emphasis—
shifts in clarity, richness of content, and degree of
focus on key attributes of the content domain. We rea-
soned DEMO changes in these respects would be visible
in the business opportunity prototypes of novice and
experienced entrepreneurs. In other words, reﬂecting
differences in their experience as entrepreneurs, the
“business opportunity” prototypes of the two groups
would differ in several respects. We further reasoned
that to the extent such DEMO were found to
exist, this would provide evidence for the role DEMO pat-
tern recognition in the identiﬁcation of new business
opportunities.
With respect to clarity, previous research on pro-
totypes (e.g., Matlin 2005) DEMO that these cogni-
tive frameworks become more clearly deﬁned with
increasing experience. One index of such clarity is the
degree to which the prototypes DEMO different individu-
als converge on the same set of basic dimensions—in
other words, the extent to which the prototypes pos-
sessed by different persons agree on basic attributes.
1334
For example, when automobiles were a new prod-
uct, different DEMO might well have included
different attributes in their prototypes for this new
method of transportation. As experience with auto-
mobiles increased, however, these DEMO would
be expected to show increasing agreement on basic at-
tributes (DEMO, all automobiles are self-propelled, have
a system for steering, a DEMO system for stopping,
etc.). Agreement with respect to basic dimensions is
generally interpreted as one indicant of increased pro-
totype clarity (e.g., Knowlton 1997). On the basis of
this previous research, we DEMO the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. The business opportunity prototypes of
experienced entrepreneurs will be more clearly deﬁned than
the opportunity prototypes of novice ( ﬁrst-time) entre-
preneurs; that is, experienced entrepreneurs will show
greater DEMO on the basic dimensions of this prototype.
Turning to richness of content, basic research on
prototypes indicates that this, too, increases with
growing experience. One measure of such richness
is the number of different dimensions DEMO in
the prototype; this increases with growing experience
in the prototype DEMO Considering the prototype
for automobiles once again, the number of attributes
DEMO dimensions included in this prototype would be
expected to be relatively small initially—when auto-
mobiles were a new means of transportation—but
then to increase DEMO individuals gained experience with
them. For instance, such attributes as “has DEMO,”
“possesses a windshield,” or “includes a control for
changing gears,” might be added to the basic dimen-
sions described above. On DEMO basis of this reasoning,
we propose the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2. The business opportunity prototypes of
experienced entrepreneurs will be richer in DEMO than the
opportunity prototypes of novice entrepreneurs (i.e., they
will include more discrete dimensions).4
Finally, additional research ﬁndings (Matlin 2005)
DEMO that as individuals acquire experience in a
given domain, their prototypes DEMO increasingly
focused on key attributes of that domain—attributes
related to the primary function or process of the
item or domain. With respect to prototypes DEMO busi-
ness opportunities, this suggests that such prototypes
would become increasingly DEMO on attributes of
4 As noted by one reviewer, it is DEMO that the relationship
between the number of dimensions in prototypes and experience
might be curvilinear in nature, with the number of dimensions
rising at ﬁrst but then decreasing after individuals become truly
expert in a given DEMO However, recent research in cognitive
science on the topic of exceptional DEMO (e.g., Ericcson 2006)
suggests that this function might well be linear until extremely high
levels of expertise are attained.

opportunities related to actually starting and running
a new DEMO (e.g., meeting customer needs, capacity
to generate cash ﬂow, manageable risk, etc.) and less
focused on other attributes less central to DEMO or
running a new business (e.g., newness, uniqueness,
or DEMO feelings of excitement). This reasoning
suggested the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3. The business opportunity prototypes of
experienced entrepreneurs will be more concerned DEMO
those of novice entrepreneurs with factors or conditions
related to actually starting and running a new ven-
ture; in contrast, the opportunity prototypes DEMO novice
entrepreneurs will more strongly emphasize attributes less
directly related to business processes (e.g., the novelty or
uniqueness of new products or services)DEMO
With respect to Hypothesis 3, it should be noted
that several DEMO studies indicate that focusing on
the “novelty” or “uniqueness” of opportunities may
be detrimental to the success of new ventures because
focusing on these DEMO can divert entrepreneurs’
attention from factors relating to the feasibility of
successfully developing speciﬁc opportunities, and in
fact, away from the question of DEMO the perceived
opportunities offer the potential for ﬁnancial gains or
are, DEMO, mainly illusory (“false alarms” in the lan-
guage of signal detection theory; Archdivili et al. 2003,
Baron 2004a).
Method
To assess and compare the opportunity prototypes of
experienced and novice entrepreneurs, we asked care-
fully matched groups of experienced and novice (ﬁrst-
time) entrepreneurs DEMO respond to two open-ended
questions: “Describe the idea on which your DEMO ven-
ture was based,” and “Why did you feel this was
a good idea—one worth pursuing?” Replies to these
items were then DEMO analyzed (see below), and the
results of these analyses provided DEMO primary data
for determining the content of the opportunity pro-
totypes of novice and experienced entrepreneurs, and
for comparing these prototypes.
In addition, DEMO obtain further information on the
cognitive frameworks employed by entrepreneurs to
identify new business opportunities, we also asked
participants in the study to describe ideas for new
products or services they had considered but ulti-
mately DEMO (“Describe an idea for a new product,
service, etc., DEMO you considered but then ultimately
rejected”) and to indicate why they DEMO rejected
such ideas (“Please indicate why you rejected this
idea”). DEMO these data were considered subsidiary
to the data concerning identiﬁed opportunities, DEMO
were analyzed in the same manner and are described
below.

SampleofEntrepreneurs
We obtained samples of both experienced and ﬁrst-
time entrepreneurs through the assistance of entre-
preneurial networking DEMO in three major
southeastern U.S. cities. The executive directors of
these organizations sent our questionnaire to the
members of the networking organization (via e-mail
in PDFformat) along with an accompanying cover
letter. Because most entrepreneurs have been involved
in only one new venture (Wright et al. 1997), we made
special efforts to obtain a sizeable sample of expe-
rienced DEMO Such persons, identiﬁed from
membership data provided by the entrepreneurial
networking DEMO, were sent a second and
third e-mail requesting their participation in DEMO
study. Through these procedures, we obtained the
cooperation of 88 experienced DEMO and 106
novice entrepreneurs. A total of 521 entrepreneurs
were invited to participate in the study for an effec-
tive response rate of 39%.
DEMO an effort to assess the possible impact of response
bias, we DEMO 50 randomly selected nonrespon-
dents directly on the telephone and requested input.
Thirty-two of them complied with the request. Com-
parison of respondents and DEMO indicated
that they did not differ with respect to any of the vari-
ables of interest in the present study.
Experienced Entrepreneurs. Eighty-two percent DEMO
the experienced entrepreneurs were male, while 18%
were female; their average age was 39 years. The age
range was 22 to 54 years DEMO and had a standard devi-
ation of 4.2 years. Ninety percent were founders, and
86% held at least 10% of the equity in their respec-
tive companies. Experienced (repeat) entrepreneurs
had started an average of DEMO companies. Virtually
all (98%) considered themselves entrepreneurs. With
respect to education, 14% held only high school diplo-
mas, 10% held associates degrees, 40% had received
bachelors degrees, 21% had masters degrees, and 3%
DEMO doctoral degrees. The ﬁrms these entrepreneurs
headed were drawn from 37 different industries,
ranging from light manufacturing to retail and also
included companies DEMO business activities focused
on information technology and on biotechnology.
These ﬁrms averaged 4.8 years of age with a range
of 2.6 years to 8.9 DEMO with a standard deviation of
1.9 years.
NoviceEntrepreneurs. Seventy-four percent of the
novice (ﬁrst-time) entrepreneurs were male and 26%
were female; their average age was 31 years. The age
range of the novice entrepreneurs was DEMO to 44 years
with a standard deviation of 5.6 years. Ninety-ﬁve
percent were founders, and over 90% held at least
10% of the equity in their respective companies. All
of them considered themselves entrepreneurs. With
1335
DEMO to education, 11% held only high school diplo-
mas, 7% held associates degrees, 54% had received
bachelors degrees, 33% had masters degrees, and 6%
held doctoral degrees. The ﬁrms headed by these
entrepreneurs were DEMO from 42 different indus-
tries, including light manufacturing, retail, and DEMO
biotechnology and information technology compa-
nies. These ﬁrms averaged 4.2 years of age with a
range of 1.2 years to 5.3 years with a DEMO devia-
tion of 1.5 years.
Comparison of the Two Samples. In an effort to
examine potential differences between the novice and
experienced entrepreneurs aside DEMO their experi-
ence in starting new ventures, we compared them
with DEMO to age, founding industry, race, and sex.
We conducted a DEMO -test for age, and appropriate chi-
square tests of the categorical DEMO of founding
industry, based on NAICS (North American Indus-
trial Classiﬁcation System codes), race, and gender.
All tests were nonsigniﬁcant at the 0.05 level except
for respondent age. The experienced entrepreneurs
were signiﬁcantly older DEMO the novice entrepreneurs
(39 versus 31 years; t =291, p<DEMO). Because differ-
ences were observed for age, we included this DEMO
able in subsequent analyses (see below).
DataReductionandDerivationofPrototypes
Because the data DEMO by our open-ended ques-
tions were both voluminous and complex, we DEMO
ployed methods of data reduction similar to those
used in basic research on the nature of prototypes
and pattern recognition to determine the content DEMO
entrepreneurs’ opportunity prototypes (e.g., Chi et al.
1994, Matlin 2005, Ward et al. 1997). These procedures
involved the following steps:
DEMO 1. Entrepreneurs’ replies to the two questions
concerning their current company (DEMO the idea
on which your venture was based” and “Why did
you feel it was a good idea—one worth pursuing?”)
were ﬁrst DEMO by Ethnograph 5.0, a program
speciﬁcally designed for purposes of content DEMO
sis. Ethnograph 5.0 reports frequencies of words and
word phrases, and DEMO frequencies are then used to
identify patterns in the responses provided by partic-
ipants.
Step 2. Results provided by the Ethnograph 5.0 pro-
gram DEMO then discussed in detail by a panel of
three graduate students trained in methods of content
analysis and use of the Delphi technique for DEMO
decisions. Panel members, who were unaware of the
entrepreneurs’ identities and DEMO not know whether
they were novice or experienced entrepreneurs, then
met DEMO attempted to identify distinct ideas or
attributes present in the entrepreneurs’ responses.
Step 3. Following these initial efforts to identify key
attributes or indicators DEMO entrepreneurs’ responses,

panel members met with the researchers to dis-
cuss DEMO preliminary results. After these discussions
(which served to clarify and reﬁne DEMO initial data),
the panel met again and discussed each attribute DEMO
unanimous agreement was reached about its presence
and meaning. These procedures yielded 47 distinct
attributes included by entrepreneurs in their descrip-
tions of the DEMO for their new ventures and in their
explanations as to why they viewed these as good
ideas. Examples of these attributes include unique-
ness DEMO the idea, extent to which it is based on innova-
tive DEMO, length of the sales cycle, the ease with
which sales can be developed, and ﬁnancial charac-
teristics of the situation.
Step 4. In an additional step, panel members re-
ported the number of times each entrepreneur men-
tioned a particular attribute during the interview
(interviews lasted, DEMO average, two hours). This pro-
cedure was used to enhance DEMO psychometric prop-
erties of the ﬁnal dependent measure over and above
what would be obtained with a simple binary count
(e.g., “mentioned” or DEMO not mention” a particular
dimension). The panelists then met once again and
discussed the counts for each entrepreneur on each
dimension. The ﬁnal DEMO generated by these pro-
cedures, therefore, were frequencies—the number of
times each entrepreneur mentioned each dimension
during the interview—based on consensus among the
DEMO members.5
These procedures (Ethnograph 5.0 in conjunction
with deliberations by panel DEMO) yielded a score
for each participating entrepreneur on each of 47 DEMO
cators mentioned in their answers to the two open-

to which entrepreneurs mentioned each dimension. Analyses indi-
cated that these ratings yielded results statistically DEMO to

are less subject to potential sources of bias than ratings.

ended DEMO (“What was the idea for your busi-
ness?” and “Why DEMO you think it was worth pur-
suing?”). These were the primary data employed in
further analyses. (As noted earlier, data for DEMO ques-
tions relating to rejected ideas were analyzed in the
same manner.)
Results

study variables are DEMO in Table 1. The variables

ing the nature of these variables is presented below.)
IdentifyingtheContentofEntrepreneurs’
Prototypesfor“BusinessOpportunities”:DEMO
AnalysisofPanelRatingData
To determine the actual content of entrepreneurs’ pro-
totypes for “business opportunity,” the 47 attributes
identiﬁed through the procedures described earlier
were DEMO divided, by the panel of graduate students,
into two groups. DEMO group of attributes related to
the nature of the ideas entrepreneurs had identiﬁed
and were developing, while the second group related
to the reasons why they viewed these as good ideas,
worth developing. The 47 DEMO dimensions were
divided into these two groups to consider the possi-
bility that as a result of their growing experience in
starting new ventures, entrepreneurs might well alter

idea, extent to which a liquidity DEMO was possible,
the market impact of the technology, and an DEMO
to dominate the market). Twenty-four attributes were
rated by the judges as pertaining primarily to the rea-
sons entrepreneurs viewed these as good DEMO, worth
pursuing (e.g., short sales cycle, unique technology,
few direct competitors, and advice from friends or a
ﬁnancial advisor). Separate factor analyses employ-
ing Quartimax Rotation were then performed on
these two DEMO of indicators (see, e.g., Kerlinger and
Lee 2000, Nunnally and Bernstein 1994). We used
Nunnally’s criterion for factor loadings of greater DEMO
0.4 and the Eigenvalues greater than one criterion
(Kaiser’s Rule) for developing factors. The results of
these analyses (see Tables 2 and 3) indicated that ﬁve
clear factors related to the question, “Describe the
DEMO on which your venture was founded,” and ﬁve
clear factors related to the question, “Why did you
feel it was a good idea—one worth pursuing?”
As shown in Table 2, the following factors emerged
from the data for the question, ”Describe the idea
for your new venture”: (1) solving a customer’s
problems, (2) ability to DEMO positive cash-ﬂow
(+NCF), (3) manageable risk, (4) superiority of prod-
uct/service, and (5) potential to change the industry.
As shown in Table 3, a different set of factors emerged
for the question, “Why did you feel it was a good
idea—one worth pursuing?”: (1) a favorable ﬁnancial
model, (2) positive DEMO or advice from oth-
ers (friends, ﬁnancial advisors, and industry DEMO),
(3) how novel the idea was, (4) the existence of a
large untapped market, and (5) intuition or gut feel-
ing. These factors, which can be viewed as reﬂecting
the basic dimensions of the entrepreneurs’ business
opportunity prototypes, were then used as the basis
for testing the major hypotheses. It important to note
that these DEMO emerged from data provided by all
entrepreneurs who participated in the study. In other
words, they relate to the content of “business oppor-
tunity” prototypes generally, across both novice and
experienced entrepreneurs. Differences in the oppor-
tunity prototypes of these two groups are described
below.

implies that DEMO entrepreneurs will show
greater agreement concerning the basic dimensions

novice entrepreneurs. (Such agreement on key dimen-
sions has often been used as a measure of proto-
type clarity in DEMO cognitive research on this topic;

e.g., Knowlton 1997, Matlin 2005.) To assess such
agreement, DEMO employed a measure of within-group
agreement developed by James et al. (DEMO), known
as the reliability within groups on j procedure, rWGJ	.
DEMO rWGJ	yields a value between 0 and 1.0, with
scores above 0.70 DEMO acceptable agreement.
We calculated rWGJ	for both experienced and ﬁrst-
time entrepreneurs, DEMO then compared the resulting
indices by means of appropriate t -tests. We calculated
rWGJ	for each factor created by the factor analysis and
then averaged DEMO rWGJ	for these factors, for response
to each of the two open-ended DEMO
Results indicated that consistent with Hypothe-
sis 1, rWGJ	was indeed signiﬁcantly DEMO for expe-
rienced entrepreneurs than ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs
for both questions. For experienced entrepreneurs,
rWGJ	was 0.77 for the descriptions of the ideas on
which DEMO based their new ventures, and
0.81 for what they considered a DEMO idea. The cor-
responding values for ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs were
considerably lower, DEMO and 0.53, respectively. T -tests
indicated that both differences (0.77 versus 0.41 and
0.81 versus 0.53) were signiﬁcant, p<0001. Thus, as
predicted, the opportunity prototypes of experienced
entrepreneurs were indeed clearer, in DEMO sense, than
those of novice entrepreneurs.
As a check on the DEMO of the rWGJ	measure, we
calculated Interclass Correlation Coefﬁcients (ICCs).
These coefﬁcients ranged from 0.76 to 0.83 for expe-
rienced entrepreneurs and from DEMO and 0.57 for
novice entrepreneurs, a pattern very similar to that
DEMO with the rWGJ	measure. Finally, as a fur-
ther check on the DEMO of the rWGJ	measure, we
used SAS to calculate Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen 1968),
an index of the extent to which agreement within
groups of people is greater than would be expected on
the basis of DEMO For both experienced and novice
entrepreneurs, the level of agreement was DEMO to
be beyond chance (Cohen’s Kappa ranged from 0.36
to 0.42 DEMO novice entrepreneurs and from 0.66 to 0.74
for experienced entrepreneurs).
Hypothesis 2 predicts that the business opportu-
nity prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs will DEMO
richer in content (i.e., involve more discrete dimen-
sions) than DEMO business opportunity prototypes of
novice entrepreneurs. To test this hypothesis, we
DEMO the number of dimensions employed by
entrepreneurs in both groups in describing the ideas
for their new ventures and why they felt these
were DEMO ideas (i.e., viable). Each dimension men-
tioned was scored as 1, thus generating a possi-
ble range of 0–23 for descriptions of ideas for new
ventures, and 0–24 for descriptions of why these
were viewed by the entrepreneurs are being good
ideas. (Recall that 47 distinct attributes were previ-
ously identiﬁed in the entrepreneurs’ responses to
the two DEMO questions.) Separate chi-square

tests were then conducted for each of the two open-
ended questions. Results indicated that for both ques-
DEMO, the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs
did indeed involve more discrete dimensions DEMO
the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs. That is,
the “business opportunity” prototypes of experi-
enced entrepreneurs included a signiﬁcantly larger
number of different dimensions (chi squareideas =
2041, p< 005, df = 1156; chi DEMO = 2793,
p<aged nearly 14 different dimensions in their pro-001, df = 1326). Experienced entrepreneurs aver-
totypes, versus approximately four DEMO for
novice entrepreneurs.
Hypothesis 3 suggests that the business oppor-
tunity prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs will
be more clearly focused than those of novice DEMO
preneurs on factors and conditions related to actu-
ally starting and running a new venture. To test this
hypothesis, we conducted two discriminant analyses.
(Such analyses indicate the extent to which individ-
uals can be grouped or identiﬁed on the basis of a
given set of factors.) In the ﬁrst analysis, age was
included as a variable, along with DEMO 10 basic fac-
tors identiﬁed earlier (Tables 2 and 3). DEMO the second
discriminant analysis, age was not included as a vari-
DEMO This two-stage assessment allowed us to test the
change in canonical R2 using the technique suggested
by Cohen and Cohen (1987). This test indicated that
the change in R2 produced by including age in the
DEMO was not signiﬁcant; F =117, p>010. When
age was included in the analysis, the canonical R2
was 0.72 (Wilks’s lambda = DEMO, p< 0001). When
age was not included in the analysis, the canonical
R2 was 0.67; this reduction in R2 was not DEMO
(p>005; see Table 4). This suggests that age was not
a signiﬁcant factor in the contrasting prototypes of

nant technique utilized was suggested by Hand (1981)

dents in both samples to assess the extent DEMO which it
could correctly classify the entrepreneurs as “novice”

correctly classiﬁed in this manner. These ﬁndings
provide DEMO support for Hypothesis 3, suggest-
ing that entrepreneurs can be accurately DEMO as
experienced or novice on the basis of the proﬁles of
their responses to questions asking them to describe
the ideas for their new DEMO and why they viewed
these ideas as good. The discriminant proﬁle for
the experienced entrepreneurs included the following
dimensions: solving a customer’s problems, DEMO to
generate positive cash ﬂow, manageable risk, speed of
revenue generation, and others in their network with
whom to develop the venture. In contrast, the dis-
criminant proﬁle for ﬁrst-time entrepreneurs included
the following dimensions: how novel the idea was,
whether it was based on new technology, superiority
or product/service, potential to change the industry,
DEMO intuition or gut feel (see Table 5). In other words,DEMO
as suggested by Hypothesis 3, the business opportu-
nity prototypes of DEMO entrepreneurs seemed
to focus—to a greater extent than the business oppor-
tunity prototypes of novice entrepreneurs—on factors
and conditions directly related to actually starting DEMO
running a new venture (e.g., the ability to generate
positive cash ﬂow and meeting customers’ needs).
In contrast, the business opportunity prototypes of
novice entrepreneurs tended to emphasize the “new-
ness” or “uniqueness” of DEMO product or service and
their “gut-level” belief in its potential.
RejectedIdeas:FurtherComparisonsof
NoviceandExperiencedEntrepreneurs
As noted earlier, entrepreneurs participating in the
study were also asked to describe ideas for new
products, services, etc., they had considered but ulti-
mately rejected, and to indicate why they had rejected
1340
these ideas. The data from these items were ana-
lyzed in DEMO same manner as described previously
for ideas entrepreneurs decided to pursue. We pre-
dicted that the contrasting cognitive frameworks for
business opportunities of novice DEMO experienced
entrepreneurs would be reﬂected in their reasons for
rejecting various ideas. Speciﬁcally, we expected that
novice entrepreneurs would reject ideas for new prod-
ucts or services because they did not seem to be suf-
ﬁciently DEMO,” were not based on new technology,
did not offer the potential to change an industry or
market in a major way, or were simply not sufﬁciently
“new” or “unique.” In contrast, we expected expe-
rienced entrepreneurs to reject ideas for new prod-
ucts or services because DEMO did not offer sufﬁcient
promise of favorable ﬁnancial returns, short sales
DEMO, manageable risk, and so on. Findings provided
support for these predictions. The discriminant proﬁle
for novice entrepreneurs indicated that they rejected
ideas they DEMO not perceive to be sufﬁciently “novel,”
based on “new” technology, DEMO that were not intu-
itively appealing. In contrast, the discriminant proﬁle
DEMO the experienced entrepreneurs indicated that they
ultimately rejected ideas for new products or services
that did not offer clear potential for favorable ﬁnan-
cial DEMO, short sales cycles, manageable risk, and
the potential for obtaining DEMO input from advi-
sors. In short, novice entrepreneurs appeared, again,
to emphasize the “novelty,” “newness,” or “personal
excitement” of identiﬁed DEMO, and to reject as poten-
tial opportunities ideas for new products DEMO services
that were not high on these dimensions. In contrast,
experienced (repeat) entrepreneurs emphasized fac-
tors relating to ﬁnancial returns, and rejected ideas
that they perceived to be relatively low on such
dimensions.
Discussion
DEMO, results offer support for the suggestion that
the basic cognitive process DEMO pattern recognition
may indeed play a role in identifying new business
opportunities. By extension, theories of pattern recog-
nition suggest that the cognitive frameworks (proto-
types) used by experienced and novice entrepreneurs
to identify business DEMO will differ in pre-
dictable ways—speciﬁcally with respect to clarity,
richness of content, and focus on factors or con-
ditions directly relevant to starting and running a
new venture. Results are consistent with these pre-
DEMO Experienced entrepreneurs showed greater
agreement than novice entrepreneurs concerning the
central attributes or dimensions of the concept “busi-
ness opportunity”—one indication that their proto-
DEMO are more clearly deﬁned (Hypothesis 1). In
addition, the “business opportunity” prototypes of
BaronandEnsley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns
Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, ©2006 INFORMS
experienced entrepreneurs were richer in content—
they included more distinct dimensions than those of
novice DEMO (Hypothesis 2). Finally, experi-
enced entrepreneurs appeared to focus more attention
than novice entrepreneurs on factors and dimensions
closely related to actually DEMO and running new
ventures—to converting identiﬁed opportunities into
realized ﬁnancial gains (DEMO, manageable risk, meet-
ing customers’ needs, and generation of positive DEMO
ﬂow; Hypothesis 3). Consistent with the opening
quotation of this DEMO, and with research concern-
ing environmental threats and opportunities (e.g.,
Dutton and Jackson 1987), experienced entrepreneurs
included awareness of “danger” as DEMO as “oppor-
tunity” in their thinking. In contrast, the opportu-
nity DEMO of novice entrepreneurs were more
focused on “newness,” “novelty,” perceived superi-
ority of the entrepreneurs’ new products or services,
and intuition (i.e., “gut-level feelings”). In light of
these ﬁndings, it is, perhaps, far from surprising that
a large proportion of new ventures fail—especially
new ventures started by novice entrepreneurs (e.g.,
Azoulay and Shane 2001, Thornhill and Amit 2003).
If their founders are, in a DEMO, “cognitively dazzled”
by the novelty and perceived potential of the ideas
DEMO their new businesses, they may fail to devote
sufﬁcient attention to DEMO ﬁnancial and business
factors that strongly affect the success of new ven-
tures; lack of attention to these factors can indeed
prove fatal. One reason why novice entrepreneurs
may place so much emphasis on these factors DEMO that
lacking experience with respect to actually starting
new ventures, their DEMO of business opportu-
nities are strongly shaped by stories in the popu-
lar business press—stories that often emphasize the
“newness” or “uniqueness” business entrepreneurs
DEMO developed into highly successful new ventures
(Baron and Shane 2006).
DEMO, these differences between the opportunity
prototypes of experienced and novice entrepreneurs
DEMO that, as might be expected, experienced entre-
preneurs are much more concerned with issues and
processes that would be of interest to major DEMO
holders in their new ventures. In other words, they
think about DEMO in more sophisticated and
pragmatic ways from a business-model point of view,
than novice entrepreneurs. In this way, their expe-
rience in starting new ventures does appear to be
highly beneﬁcial to them.
Findings for DEMO entrepreneurs rejected offered
additional support for this overall pattern. Again,
novice entrepreneurs emphasized newness, novelty,
and intuition in rejecting ideas for new products,
services, etc. In contrast, experienced entrepreneurs
tended to focus DEMO factors pertaining to ﬁnancial suc-
cess, rejecting ideas for new products DEMO services that
BaronandEnsley: Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns
Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, ©2006 INFORMS
did not appear to offer manageable risk, the capacity
to generate positive cash ﬂow, and so on. DEMO,
the ﬁndings for ideas entrepreneurs did identify as
constituting business opportunities and ideas they
rejected as falling outside this category suggest that
the DEMO frameworks employed by entrepreneurs
do indeed develop with increasing experience, as DEMO
ories of pattern recognition suggest (e.g., Whittlesea
1997).
Another reason why the tendency of novice entre-
preneurs to emphasize newness, uniqueness, DEMO
intuition in their prototypes of “business opportu-
nity” may have negative consequences for their new
ventures is suggested by a large body of evidence
DEMO the impact of emotional states on cogni-
tive performance. This research indicates that when
individuals experience strong, positive affect (posi-
tive emotions or DEMO), their capacity to think sys-
tematically and evaluate information carefully may
be signiﬁcantly reduced (e.g., Ruder and Bless 2003).
It seems DEMO that novice entrepreneurs tend to
“fall in love with their own ideas,” and so experi-
ence extremely high levels of enthusiasm, optimism,
and positive affect. While these intense affective states
can sometimes contribute to DEMO (Estrada et al.
1997), they have also been found, in many studies, to
strongly interfere with the ability to engage in sys-
tematic thought (e.g., Forgas 2004).
At this point, it should be emphasized, once again,
that experienced entrepreneurs acquire these well-
developed cognitive frameworks through processes of
learning—processes that occur as they gain experi-
DEMO in the intricacies of starting new ventures. The
importance of learning in key organizational pro-
cesses has been emphasized in a large body of DEMO
research (e.g., Honig 2001, March 1991, Moorman and
Miner 1998, Miner et al. 2001), and it certainly plays
a role—along with pattern recognition—in equipping
entrepreneurs with the “cognitive raw materials” on
which to DEMO opportunity recognition. In fact, it
seems reasonable to suggest that learning DEMO the pro-
cess through which individuals acquire the cognitive
frameworks they then use in identifying viable busi-
ness opportunities. In this respect, we are reminded
of the words of one experienced entrepreneur with
whom we are DEMO individual who has
started numerous companies in a wide range of
industries. As he puts it: “When I look at many situa-
tions, DEMO think, ‘There has to be a better way.’ And then
I DEMO on my experience to ﬁgure out what that could
be.” In other words, this entrepreneur’s experience
helps him to “connect the dots” and recognize oppor-
tunities he can then develop. It should also be noted
that DEMO prototypes are not necessarily
an unmixed blessing where identifying new business
opportunities are concerned. Such frameworks can
1341
indeed assist individuals in noticing links DEMO
various changes or events in the external world; how-
ever, they can also inhibit individuals from noticing
such connections by directing their thinking DEMO spe-
ciﬁc, well-established channels that are, in one sense,
inimical to innovation (e.g., Garud and Rappa 1994).
Thus, it should certainly not be assumed that devel-
opment of increasingly strong, developed prototypes
is beneﬁcial in all respects or all instances.
One interesting implication of DEMO present ﬁndings
relates to the question of what, speciﬁcally, experi-
enced entrepreneurs acquire from their growing expe-
rience in starting new ventures. While DEMO seems clear
that they obtain many forms of knowledge and a wide
array of skills, the results of this study suggest that
one key thing they acquire is increasingly focused and
reﬁned mental frameworks for identifying DEMO
opportunities. In other words, through their experi-
ence in founding new DEMO, repeat entrepreneurs
acquire cognitive frameworks (e.g., more fully devel-
oped DEMO) that are increasingly helpful to them
in “connecting the dots” between DEMO unrelated
changes or events and in detecting meaningful pat-
terns in these links. In short, the cognitive frameworks
developed by experienced entrepreneurs assist them
in recognizing opportunities that others overlook, and
in selecting those opportunities most likely to yield
positive ﬁnancial outcomes.6
At this point, it is interesting to note that in several
respects, experienced entrepreneurs may be similar
to experts in any ﬁeld. Research on expertise sug-
gests that as individuals DEMO experience in a given
domain, they learn to focus attention primarily DEMO key
dimensions—the ones most relevant to the activity
they are performing (DEMO, Choo and Trotman 1991).
Similarly, they also gain increasingly reﬁned, well-
developed, and useful mental frameworks (e.g., cat-
egories and DEMO) for performing many tasks
(e.g., Gobbo and Chi 1986). DEMO addition, recent ﬁnd-
ings (e.g., Ericsson 2006) suggest that through partic-
ipation in prolonged deliberate practice, experts may
actually enhance their basic cognitive systems. For
instance, they may acquire closer links between work-
ing memory and long-term memory and, as a result,
be better able to draw on previously acquired infor-
mation when making current decisions or DEMO
6 As suggested by reviewers, it would be interesting to compare
DEMO entrepreneurs with ones having moderate experience (e.g.,
entrepreneurs who have DEMO 2–3 companies), and ones hav-
ing more extensive experience (e.g., four or more companies).
Such comparisons would provide information on the DEMO at which
entrepreneurs acquire, through learning, increasingly reﬁned pro-
totypes for “business opportunities.” Unfortunately, the number of
entrepreneurs in the present sample who had started four or more
companies was very small (a total of only 16), so such analyses
were not feasible with the present DEMO set.
1342
(e.g., Ericsson 2006). It seems reasonable to suggest
that DEMO processes may be at work among experi-
enced entrepreneurs who, in DEMO sense, become experts
in recognizing opportunities and in starting new ven-
DEMO These and related possibilities can be readily
examined in future research.
TheoreticalImplications
The present ﬁndings appear to have important the-
oretical implications. As noted DEMO, the results of
this study underscore the potential value of apply-
DEMO existing theories of cognitive science—and espe-
cially, theories of pattern identiﬁcation—to DEMO
aspects of the entrepreneurial process. This conclu-
sion is consistent with a large, rapidly growing litera-
ture on entrepreneurial cognition, research focused on
DEMO potential role of cognitive factors and processes
in entrepreneurship (e.g., Baron 2004b, Gaglio 2004,
Busenitz and Arthurs 2006, Krueger 2003, Mitchell
et al. 2004). This previous research has been based, to
a large degree, on the ﬁndings and theories of cog-
nitive science. The present ﬁndings suggest that fur-
ther insights into various aspects of entrepreneurship
DEMO be gained through careful application of addi-
tional ﬁndings and theories of cognitive science, for
instance, from basic research on the cognitive founda-
DEMO of expertise (e.g., Ericsson 2006) or from research
on the DEMO of creative thought (e.g., Ward 2004).
Similarly, research on DEMO detection theory, one cog-
nitive theory of decision making, may provide impor-
tant insights into the mechanisms through which
entrepreneurs distinguish between bona DEMO opportu-
nities and false alarms—opportunities that are more
illusory than real (DEMO, McMullen and Shepherd 2006).
In short, extant theories and principles of cogni-
tive science may provide the ﬁeld of entrepreneur-
ship with DEMO, principles, and research meth-
ods useful in understanding important aspects of the
entrepreneurial process (e.g., Baron and Ward 2004).
LimitationsofthePresentResearch
Before DEMO, several limitations of the present
research should be carefully noted. First, although we
attempted to match experienced and novice entre-
preneurs as closely DEMO possible, the two groups dif-
fered in one respect aside from DEMO experience in
starting new ventures: The experienced entrepreneurs
in our sample DEMO somewhat older than the novice
entrepreneurs. Given that age and experience are
often highly correlated, and that starting new ven-
tures requires signiﬁcant amounts of time, this differ-
ence is not surprising. However, its presence DEMO
the possibility that differences in the cognitive frame-
works (i.e., prototypes) of experienced and novice
entrepreneurs observed in the present research might
have derived—at least in part—from this factor. Two

Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, ©2006 INFORMS
ﬁndings suggest that cognitive differences between
experienced and novice entrepreneurs did DEMO stem
from differences in age: (1) the discriminant anal-
yses DEMO which age was, and was not, included as
a variable produced very similar results (canonical
R2 of 0.72 and 0.67, respectively, which did not dif-
fer signiﬁcantly); and (2) classiﬁcation accuracy was
DEMO increased (by only 1%) when age was included
in the discriminant function. However, future stud-
ies seeking to compare the cognitive frameworks of
experienced and novice entrepreneurs to determine
how these frameworks change as a DEMO of increased
experience should make strenuous efforts to minimize
any age disparity between these groups.
Another limitation of the present research is that
all DEMO data collected are retrospective in nature:
Both novice and experienced entrepreneurs reported
on events that had occurred in the past. Cognitive
scientists have DEMO that memory is subject to con-
siderable distortion and change over time. Informa-
tion entered into memory is frequently altered over
the course of DEMO, months, or years through selec-
tive forgetting and other processes (DEMO, Seamon et al.
2002). Given the scope and breadth of DEMO memory-
distortion processes, the present data must be inter-
preted with DEMO To minimize such effects, we
focused, in this study, on DEMO descriptions
of events relating to their current companies. Because
both groups (DEMO and experienced entrepreneurs)
reported on the company they were now running,
memory distortion would be expected to be relatively
equal in both DEMO Thus, it seems unlikely that
the differences between the two groups DEMO respect
to their prototypes stemmed primarily from this fac-
tor. However, DEMO all retrospective data are sub-
ject to potential sources of distortion, DEMO additional
research speciﬁcally designed to examine the impact
of such factors can provide direct evidence on their
effects or eliminate them as potential contributors DEMO
the present ﬁndings.
Third, we should note that in this research, we
did not include industry or type of new venture
(e.g., DEMO versus nontechnology) as a variable.
Because the process of new venture DEMO may well
vary as a function of such factors, this, too, is a limi-
tation with respect to generalizing the present results.
Fourth, as noted by one reviewer of this paper, the
tendency of DEMO entrepreneurs to focus their
business opportunity prototypes on factors or condi-
tions related to actual business processes to a greater
extent than novice entrepreneurs DEMO reﬂect, in
part, that these persons have left previous companies
to start new ones. This could lead them to emphasize
such factors as DEMO ﬂow and risk to a greater extent
than novice entrepreneurs lacking such experiences.
The present ﬁndings may reﬂect this factor rather

Management Science 52(9), pp. 1331–1344, ©2006 INFORMS
than differences in prototype development. Finally,
we should note that the novice entrepreneurs in this
study headed DEMO that had existed for several
years. Thus, in a sense, they were not “raw begin-
ners;” rather, they had already achieved at least mod-
est success because the companies they had founded
were still DEMO
Despite these limitations, the ﬁndings of the present
research do appear DEMO offer several useful contribu-
tions. First, they suggest that opportunity recognition
DEMO be related to pattern recognition. This, in turn,
provides a DEMO means for applying well-developed
theories of cognitive science to the task of understand-
ing the basic nature of opportunity recognition. Sec-
ond, the present results shed new light on why some
persons are better at recognizing DEMO than
others: In essence, they may possess better-developed
cognitive frameworks for accomplishing this task.
Finally, and perhaps most important, the ﬁndings of
DEMO research suggest that experienced entrepreneurs
do indeed acquire increasingly reﬁned cognitive
frameworks (prototypes) for identifying new business
opportunities. As a result, they may gain an impor-
tant advantage over novice entrepreneurs in terms
of choosing DEMO opportunities most likely to lead to
proﬁtable new ventures. To put it succinctly, one rea-
son that experienced entrepreneurs may be more suc-
cessful than novice entrepreneurs in identifying excel-
lent business opportunities may be that DEMO
entrepreneurs have learned to think in ways that help
them keep their eyes ﬁrmly on what is “feasible” and
“potentially proﬁtable,” while avoiding DEMO potential
trap of being swept away by what is merely “new”
or “unique.”
