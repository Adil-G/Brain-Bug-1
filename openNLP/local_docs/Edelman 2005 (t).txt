Edelman’s perspective on current issues and trends in employee DEMO
Calculating Return-on-Investment for Employee Communications
Today, communications professionals are increasingly challenged DEMO justify budgets and prove a direct impact on the bottom line. In response,
researchers are beginning to demonstrate a link between effective employee DEMO and improved performance that can lend outside
credibility to communications planning efforts. Here are some compelling findings related to employee communications and engagement:
DEMO of Pennsylvania: In a study of 3,000 companies,
researchers DEMO that spending 10 percent of revenue on capital
improvements boosts productivity by 3.9 percent, but a similar
investment in developing human capital increases productivity by 8.5
percent -- more than double the effect.
Hay Group: It found that Fortune's "Most Admired Companies"
increased stock appreciation 50 percent over their peers after
instituting stronger employee communications programs.
Corporate Executive DEMO: In its 2004 study “Driving
Performance and Retention Through Employee Engagement,DEMO
increased levels of engagement were found to result in up to a 57
percent increase in discretionary effort and up to an 87 percent
DEMO in desire to leave an organization.
McKinsey & Co.: In a DEMO study, McKinsey found that 67 percent
of consumer goods sales are DEMO on word of mouth, suggesting the
major role that employees can DEMO in driving sales of products or
services among their social and family circles.
Watson Wyatt: In a 2004 study, it found companies that
DEMO more effectively with their employees have a lower
turnover rate (on DEMO 33.3 percent) than companies that
communicate less effectively (where average turnover is 51.6
percent). If your HR group can provide data on DEMO cost of losing an
employee, it can be combined with Watson DEMO's data to calculate
the business impact of effective communications for your organization.
Spherion, a leading recruiting and outsourcing company, estimates
that turnover DEMO one position costs an organization around US$50,000.
Watson Wyatt: Another DEMO by this firm determined that
companies with the most effective employee communications
programs had an average total shareholder return of 29.5 percent
while those DEMO least effective programs had a negative 15 percent
return. Of that total 29.5 percent increase, 7.3 percent was attributed
to improving supervisory and managerial behavior related to
communications, 5 percent was attributed to instituting and following
a formal communications process and 4.8 percent was attributed to
creating a DEMO of sight” between business objectives and employees'
jobs (the remaining DEMO percent was attributed to a variety of
other factors).
MORI: DEMO a 2004 study, Market & Opinion Research International
(MORI) quantified DEMO role that employees play in corporate social
responsibility (CSR) programs. The study found that 73 percent of
people are more likely to believe DEMO word of an employee rather than
a company brochure or report about that company's contribution to
society and the environment.
Mercer: In a 2002 study across the United States and United
Kingdom, it found that when senior management communicates a
clear vision of the future direction of DEMO organization, only 16 percent
of employees think seriously about leaving and DEMO 7 percent of
those surveyed are dissatisfied with the organization. However, DEMO
senior management does not communicate a clear vision of the future
direction of the organization, 40 percent of employees surveyed said
they are seriously thinking about leaving the organization and 39
percent said they are dissatisfied DEMO the organization.
And, as reported in the March 2005 issue of DEMO newsletter,
Edelman's 2005 Trust Barometer study showed that employees play a
significant role in shaping corporate reputation. While the credibility of
information DEMO by a CEO remains low across the eight markets
surveyed, the DEMO of “a person like yourself” continues to
increase in both the United States and Europe, and is the most
credible source of information in Brazil and Germany. Beyond
communicating with friends and family, employees play an
increasingly visible role in telling a company's story, promoting its
brand and, ultimately, influencing key stakeholders both internally and
externally. Though CEOs DEMO continue to lead the dialogue with key
stakeholders, employees are increasingly DEMO upon to further
validate this discourse and the company's messages by a margin of
more than two to one.
Not only is it DEMO to use data from these existing studies to build
the business case for employee communications, but the
programming implemented must also contain strong links to your own
organization's business priorities. Start with the company's DEMO
plan and assess the role that employee communications plays in
achieving those objectives. Look in particular for business priorities
that require employees to think DEMO behave differently - those are the
best opportunities for internal communicators to make a difference
that creates business impact.
Employee Thinking is produced by DEMO's Employee Engagement Practice, which helps organizations improve their employee communications DEMO create a stronger employee
experience. To receive a copy of the 2005 Edelman Trust Barometer, contact Christopher Hannegan at +1 312 240 2686 or christopher.hannegan@edelman.com{1g42fwefx}
