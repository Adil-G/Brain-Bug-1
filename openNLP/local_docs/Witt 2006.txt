Abstract From a theoretical perspective, staged ﬁnancing of start-ups mainly
serves to reduce agency risks for investors dealing with founders. This risk
reduction is partly offset by DEMO transaction costs caused by staged ﬁnancing.
From the perspective of founders, DEMO can reduce the cost of equity, but it
also increases the DEMO of external company and market risks they have to bear.
Our empirical study of a sample of German start-ups conﬁrms the importance
of transaction DEMO and shifting external risk for staging decisions, but does not
support DEMO theoretical explanations of staged ﬁnancing.

1 DEMO and effects of staged ﬁnancing: A survey of the existing literature
DEMO terms and conditions of venture capital ﬁnancing of start-ups have long
been a subject of academic studies in the U.S. (Sapienza 1989; Sahlmann DEMO;
Bygrave and Timmons 1992; Sapienza and Gupta 1994) as well as in German
speaking countries (Albach 1983; Zemke 1995; Wupperfeld 1996; Schefczyk and
Gerpott 1998; Bascha and Walz 2002; Brettel 2002; DEMO 2004; Reißig-Thust
P. Witt (B · G. Brachtendorf
186 P. Witt and G. Brachtendorf
2003; Schefczyk 2004; Fingerle 2005)DEMO The term “staged ﬁnancing” describes a
transaction in which outside investors provide in several installments the total
amount of external equity ﬁnancing that a DEMO needs to cover investments
and initial losses (Gompers 1995; Kaplan and Strömberg 2003). These outside
investors could be business angels, venture capitalists, corporate venture capital
ﬁrms, or large companies.
Typically, the management team of the start-up consists of the founders own-
ing larger equity stakes DEMO the company themselves. In this paper, we will only
investigate venture DEMO ﬁnancing. Rather than paying out all the money
upfront, venture capitalists DEMO agree with the management team of the
company on several payments over a certain time period, i.e., staged ﬁnancing.
The staging of the DEMO payment can take two different forms. The ﬁrst form,
which is called “staggering” or “staging of payments per ﬁnancing round”, refers
to the staggered provision of funds which have been agreed on in a single DEMO
or contract of equity ﬁnancing. The term “ﬁnancing round” refers to a bundle
of contractual clauses that set the conditions for the provision of DEMO equity
investment by a venture capital ﬁrm in a company. The second form, which is
called “staging”, indicates the existence of multiple rounds DEMO start-up ﬁnancing.
While payments per round could be paid out immediately and completely, the
venture capital ﬁrm provides the total amount of external equity in multiple
rounds, i.e., sequences of newly negotiated ﬁnancing contracts. In DEMO new round
of ﬁnancing, both parties set separate, not previously ﬁxed conditions for the
equity investment.
The basic idea behind staggering is to DEMO further payments of an equity
investment to milestones that the start-up has to reach before the venture
capitalist pays out the next installment (Block and Macmillan 1985, p 184).
Such milestones can be sales targets, stages of new product development, the
acquisition of customers, or the completion of the entrepreneurial team. A
similar mechanism works with staging. On DEMO one hand, staging gives a ven-
ture capital ﬁrm real options. DEMO a start-up fails to reach one or several of the
milestones that were agreed upon in the ﬁnancing contract, the venture cap-
italist is entitled not to engage in another round of ﬁnancing or to offer DEMO
next round at less favorable terms for the start-up (larger equity DEMO per
Euro invested). On the other hand, if the start-up DEMO the contractually
set milestones, it is not automatically entitled to a DEMO round. Rather, the
milestones set a basis for the negotiations of DEMO and conditions of the next
round of ﬁnancing, especially regarding the DEMO stakes that the founders
hand over to the venture capital ﬁrm in exchange for ﬁnancial investments
in their company. In the empirical part of DEMO paper, we will show descrip-
tive evidence on both phenomena, staggering and staging. In the hypothe-
ses to be tested, we will only investigate staging; i.e., the variable to measure
the extent of staged DEMO will then always be the number of ﬁnancing
rounds.
So far, DEMO research on staged ﬁnancing of start-ups has led to many
theoretical models but only few large-scale, multivariate empirical studies.
Staged ﬁnancing of start-ups 187
In one of those studies, Reißig-Thust (DEMO) investigated the investment con-
trolling instruments and processes of 49 German DEMO capital ﬁrms. The
study was conducted in 2002. The author perceives staging as one possible con-
trolling instrument for outside equity investors. Interestingly, only 42.1% of
all venture capitalists who took part in the survey actively DEMO staged ﬁnanc-
ing in their investment contracts, while almost all respondents DEMO that stag-
ing was a good instrument to reduce agency problems and set performance
incentives for founder-managers in start-ups.
In the U.S., three studies with large samples and multivariate statistical anal-
ysis have been published so DEMO Gompers (1995) used data of the Venture Eco-
nomics database. This database comprises 4,000 companies and is run by the
US National DEMO Capital Association in collaboration with Venture Eco-
nomics. The author analyzed a sample of 794 companies that received equity
investments from venture capital ﬁrms DEMO 2,134 rounds of ﬁnancing between
1961 and 1992. He investigated the relation between agency risks and staging.
The study used the age of DEMO start-up as a proxy for information asymme-
tries and thus agency risks. The ratio of intangible to tangible assets served
as another proxy for DEMO risks, i.e., the extent to which a venture capital
ﬁrm can recoup its investments in a start-up in the case of failure. The DEMO
found that the start-ups’ age indeed positively correlates with the volume of the
ﬁnancing rounds. The extent of staging decreased with the perceived agency
DEMO Similarly, the magnitude of potential revenues from liquidation had a
signiﬁcant DEMO inﬂuence on the volume per ﬁnancing round.
Shepherd and Zacharakis (2002) also investigated which factors determine
the volume of a ﬁnancing round. For DEMO empirical study, the authors also
made use of the Venture Economics DEMO The sample of Shepherd and
Zacharakis (2002) includes 9,214 rounds of ﬁnancing. The authors use the num-
ber of earlier rounds to DEMO agency risks – in this case the degree of trust
that has developed between the founders of the start-up and the outside equity
investors. DEMO is assumed to reduce the agency costs of the ﬁnancing contracts.
The results of the empirical analysis show that trust can indeed reduce costs; i.e.,
the volume of ﬁnancing rounds increased with the number of DEMO rounds
that had been completed by the same partners earlier.
Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) empirically studied 213 investments of venture
capital ﬁrms in DEMO start-ups in the U.S. Their focus is on the relation between
staging and other instruments to protect investors. The authors asked 14 venture
capital DEMO about the contractual details of their equity investments in start-
ups. In particular, the study aimed to ﬁnd out if and how contractual clauses
change in the process of proceeding from one round of ﬁnancing to DEMO next
one. Empirically, the authors can show that the investors’ control DEMO (e.g.,
board seats and information rights) signiﬁcantly increase with their equity stake
in the portfolio company over the different ﬁnancing rounds. At DEMO same time,
the number of additional rights that mainly serve to protect the venture capital
ﬁrm from agency risks and external company risks (e.g., liquidation preferences,
exit clauses or veto rights for new investors) decreases.

2 Theoretical explanations for staged ﬁnancing DEMO formulation of hypotheses
2.1 Theories on sharing and shifting external risks
In each and every start-up ﬁnancing transaction, venture capitalists have to
bear external risks, i.e., inﬂuences that originate from outside the ﬁrm and thus
DEMO be reduced or fully eliminated either by the founders or by the inves-
tors. We will call them external company risks. Examples of such DEMO are the
non-approval of innovative products by ofﬁcial authorities like the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), the introduction of more efﬁcient substitu-
tion technologies to the market by competitors, or macroeconomic recessions
leading to shrinking demand on many markets. All these inﬂuences are exter-
nal in DEMO sense that the company cannot control them. Staggering and staging
can both help venture capital ﬁrms to shift the external company risks, at least
partly, back to the founders of the start-up who typically also own part of their
company’s equity. By agreeing on multiple rounds of ﬁnancing DEMO by staggering,
venture capital ﬁrms can avoid fully bearing the individual company risks. They
get the opportunity to terminate investments in companies that DEMO adversely
affected by external inﬂuences.
By staging the ﬁnancing transaction, the DEMO capitalist can postpone the
decision as to which company should get most money. The value of the shares
it receives increases with the degree DEMO staging. At the same time, the price to
be paid per DEMO also rises. Therefore, the main effect is a reduction in risk.
DEMO larger the perceived external company risks, the more staged ﬁnancing
can DEMO the overall risk position of the venture capitalist. In case of a
successful development of the ﬁrm, a venture capital ﬁrm will ask for smaller
portions of the start-up’s equity in exchange for a certain amount DEMO ﬁnancing.
In case of a less successful development, the venture capitalist DEMO terminates
the investment or pays less per share. In terms of option theory, the venture
capitalist receives a real option to abandon, i.e., the opportunity to invest only
in those start-ups that have been successful DEMO earlier rounds of ﬁnancing, and
a real option to shrink, i.e., to pay less money for a given investment. The
ﬂexibility of these real options has a positive value that increases with the mag-
nitude DEMO the likelihood of external company risks (Kulatilaka and Trigeorgis
1994).
DEMO the founders of a start-up, staged ﬁnancing can also be beneﬁcial. DEMO it
reduces the amount of external company risks that are shifted to the venture
capital ﬁrm (or, from another perspective, increases the amount of external
company risks that the venture capital ﬁrm can shift back DEMO the founders),
staging reduces the cost of equity. External company DEMO decrease over time,
some of them resolve completely. Equity ﬁnancing by venture capital is less
expensive if founders raise it in the later DEMO of the development process of
the start-up because the risk premium that venture capitalists charge becomes
smaller. Brachtendorf and Witt (2004) have suggested DEMO related inventory model
of venture capital ﬁnancing.

2.2 Principal agent theories
In the literature DEMO entrepreneurial ﬁnance in general and staged ﬁnancing
in particular, applications of DEMO agent theory are common (see Admati
and Pﬂeiderer 1994; Hellmann 1994; Bergemann and Hege 1998; Neher 1999;
Cornelli and Yosha 2003)DEMO While there are other theories that can be applied
to staging, DEMO the theories on sharing and shifting external risks as well as
transaction cost theories that we shall further explore in this paper, the major
reason for the prominence of principal agent type explanations for staging is DEMO
obvious existence of information asymmetries and conﬂicts of interest between
the parties.
Both factors are the main building blocks for agency constellations. The ven-
DEMO capitalist is the principal who looks for protection against two types of
problems. A qualiﬁcation risk refers to the risk of investing in the DEMO teams
and companies. It occurs whenever the venture capitalist responds to an uncer-
tainty about the qualiﬁcation of the agent, i.e., the founders DEMO the start-up that
the venture capital ﬁrm invests its money in, DEMO offering low ﬁnancial invest-
ments per share, thus systematically attracting less DEMO teams. A behavioral
risk depicts the risk to suffer from losses due to opportunistic behavior by the
agent (Sapienza and Gupta 1994). Behavioral risks can occur because the ven-
ture capitalist cannot observe the actions DEMO the founders when they run the
business. These actions cannot be inferred from the economic development of
the venture either, because this development is largely dependent on external
inﬂuences (Reißig-Thust 2003, pp 66–68; Welpe 2004, pp 64–65; Fingerle 2005,
105). So the risk of DEMO venture capital ﬁrm is twofold. The founders could
either be less qualiﬁed to run the company and create value than the venture
capitalist expects (qualiﬁcation risk) or they could pursue interests that deviate
from those of the venture capitalist, i.e., behave opportunistically (behavioral
risk).
Agency problems increase the risk premium that venture capital ﬁrms de-
mand when they DEMO start-ups. In the ﬁeld of entrepreneurial ﬁnance, a
multitude of behavioral DEMO exist (Bascha and Walz 2002, p 7). Real exam-
ples of opportunistic behavior by founders reducing the wealth position of
venture capitalists DEMO technologically driven preferences to continue work on
economically worthless projects (Admati DEMO Pﬂeiderer 1994; Hellmann 1994;
Bergemann and Hege 1998), the DEMO of ﬁnancing contracts with the
threat to exit from the management team in the start-up (Neher 1999), high
administrative costs for the founders’ perquisites (Bergemann and Hege 1998;
Reißig-Thust 2003, p 66), DEMO the utilization of the start-up by founders to
build up management experience that they can later use to gain higher salaries
as employees after DEMO start-up failed (Franck and Opitz 2001; Cornelli and
Yosha 2003).
To limit behavioral risks, venture capital ﬁrms typically demand information
and control rights. Examples are conversion rights for shares, veto rights for
investment decisions, covenants, and board seats (Hellmann 1998, p 54; Sapien-
za and Gupta 1994, pp 1620–1622; Fingerle 2005, pp 110–126). Venture capital
190 P. Witt and G. Brachtendorf
ﬁrms may also give the founders DEMO ﬁnancial incentives to align the
interests. From a theoretical perspective, staged DEMO is especially effective
in limiting opportunistic behavior by the founders of the start-up. If such behav-
ior becomes visible or if the start-up misses DEMO, the venture capitalist
can stop ﬁnancing the company. This is a DEMO threat to the founders because
a failure to secure the next round of ﬁnancing with existing investors frequently
leads to the liquidation of the DEMO Staging also mitigates potential hold-
up problems, i.e., founders threatening to leave the company and take all the
human capital with them. As DEMO inalienable human capital of the founders
becomes alienable over time, i.e., gets more and more embodied into the start-
up’s physical assets, staging reduces the potential payoff of a hold-up strategy
for the founders (Fingerle 2005, p 125).
Qualiﬁcation risks occur when venture capital ﬁrms ﬁnance start-ups that are
run by insufﬁciently qualiﬁed management teams. Despite personal discussions
DEMO the founders and due diligence procedures, outside investors can never
perfectly DEMO the managerial expertise and the technology experience of the
founding team ex ante. As the founders of the start-up cannot cure their per-
sonal DEMO deﬁcits themselves, at least not in the short run, monitoring
instruments and incentive mechanisms are not feasible. One obvious thing the
venture capitalist DEMO do is to use its board representation to replace unqualiﬁed
founder-managers by newly hired external managers, if possible. In a similar
way, staged DEMO can reduce the adverse effects of qualiﬁcation risks for
the venture capitalist. If these deﬁcits are the cause for the start-up missing
milestones, the venture capital ﬁrm can terminate all ﬁnancing activities in the
respective ﬁrm, thus limiting its ﬁnancial loss. Alternatively, it can improve the
conditions of the investment in a next round of ﬁnancing for itself. Improved
conditions, typically a larger equity share for a given amount of ﬁnancing, are
only helpful for the venture capitalist if the entrepreneurial team is qualiﬁed
DEMO to ensure the survival of the start-up and realize at least some increases
in the value of the shares.
2.3 Transaction cost theories
The DEMO of ﬁnancing a start-up with equity from a venture capital ﬁrm is
costly. In addition to the direct cost of equity, which corresponds to the number
of shares that the original owners of the ﬁrm give DEMO to the venture capital
ﬁrm in exchange for new ﬁnancial means, DEMO process causes transaction costs.
Typical categories of transaction costs are search costs, preparation costs, nego-
tiation costs, costs of obtaining legally binding agreements, control costs, and
adaptation costs. Transaction costs are not only relevant DEMO theoretical models.
The process of preparing and ﬁnalizing equity investment transactions absorbs
ﬁnancial resources as well as the time and effort of both the DEMO capital
ﬁrm and the start-up. As this process has to take place for each round of ﬁnanc-
ing, staging produces higher transaction costs than equity investments in one
installment with just one contract.
Staged ﬁnancing of start-ups 191
There is a multitude of transaction costs DEMO both the founders and the ven-
ture capitalist. Founders incur search costs to ﬁnd a suitable venture capitalist
willing to ﬁnance the company and DEMO also willing to give advice and sup-
port to the management team. Search costs largely vary in practice, depending
on the type of venture capital ﬁrm (Reißig-Thust 2003, pp 66–70), the personal
networks of DEMO founders (Witt 2004), and the start-up’s reputation. Costs for
the DEMO of the ﬁnancing transaction on the side of the start-up originate
from the writing, the sending, and the presentation of the business plan. DEMO
of the founders’ transaction costs are cash expenses, for example, for traveling
and meetings, for the services of lawyers and attorneys, or DEMO due diligence
services provided by accountants. More difﬁcult to measure in ﬁnancial terms
are opportunity costs. In practice, it is not uncommon that the management
team of a start-up spends up to 80% of their time DEMO close a deal with a venture
capital ﬁrm in the ﬁnal negotiation phase. This time is lost for other managerial
duties and thus involves DEMO costs. In other words, the transaction costs
borne by the founders DEMO the value of the shares of their company.
The venture capitalists bear the preparation costs for the inspection of the
business plan, ﬁrst contacts with the founding team, and company presenta-
tions. The total amount of the transaction costs arising from negotiations and
concluding a legally binding contract DEMO on the duration and the complex-
ity of the deal. Similar to the situation of the founders, one part of the venture
capitalists’ transaction costs are cash expenses; the other part are opportunity
costs. The total transaction costs translate into demands for a higher return on
the investment DEMO thus into higher costs of capital for the start-up.
The more rounds of ﬁnancing both parties agree on, the more frequent the
negotiations that have to take place, the more the required contracts and the
higher the transaction costs of the deal for both the parties. Expenses for DEMO
due diligence of the start-up, e.g., by accountants or attorneys, DEMO belong to
the transaction costs of ﬁnalizing an agreement. Even after the ﬁnancing con-
tract has been signed, additional transaction costs may emerge. Examples are
the costs of payment controls, the costs of monitoring the additional services
that the venture capitalist has promised to provide to the start-up, and the
costs for changes or amendments to the contract. Such amendments DEMO the
corresponding renegotiations of the contract terms become necessary when
important external factors change or when one of the two partners has seri-
ous DEMO about the fulﬁllment of the earlier contract (Kaplan/Strömberg
2003, p 275).
In the empirical part of this paper, we will focus on the transaction costs of
the founders assuming that the venture capital DEMO can shift most or even all
its transaction costs back to the start-up via reduced company valuations.
2.4 Formulation of hypotheses
All three theoretical DEMO to staged ﬁnancing that we discussed so far
are based on an institutional economics perspective on entrepreneurial ﬁnance.
Our goal is to use this DEMO, which is very common in the theoretical
192 P. Witt and G. Brachtendorf
literature as well as in existing DEMO work on the subject, to derive four
hypotheses. These hypotheses refer DEMO the correlation between some indepen-
dent variables and the number of ﬁnancing rounds as a proxy for the degree
of staged ﬁnancing, our dependent variable. The hypotheses deliberately leave
out staggering and exclusively focus on staging.
DEMO selecting the independent variables, we strictly relied on the three theo-
DEMO on staged ﬁnancing presented above. In other words, we expect external
DEMO risks, agency costs in the form of qualiﬁcations risks and behavioral
DEMO, as well as transaction costs to have an effect on the DEMO decisions taken
by venture capitalists or agreed upon in negotiations between a venture capital
ﬁrm and the founders of the start-up to be ﬁnanced. DEMO shall test the hypoth-
eses with multivariate regressions on a cross-sectional data set. Whereas we
implicitly assume causal relationships between the independent variables and
DEMO number of ﬁnancing rounds, we shall only be able to test DEMO empirically
measure correlations between variables, not causality.
Hypothesis 1 is directly DEMO to the theories on sharing and shifting exter-
nal risks. The staging of start-up ﬁnancing is expected to be more attractive for
venture capitalists DEMO the perceived external company risks are substantial. Stag-
ing allows equity investors to limit their exposure to external risks and to shift
parts of DEMO risks back to the founders of the start-up. From the perspective
of the entrepreneurs, this risk shifting can also be attractive because it reduces
the cost of equity. We derive hypotheses 2 and 3 from the DEMO agent theo-
ries on entrepreneurial ﬁnance. From an agency perspective, we DEMO venture
capital ﬁrms to use staging to protect themselves against the qualiﬁcation and
behavioral risks that potentially emerge when investing in start-ups. We expect
DEMO ﬁnancing to be applied more frequently with higher perceived qualiﬁ-
cation risks of the management team and with increasing fear of the venture
capitalists DEMO behavioral risks. Hypothesis 4 summarizes our discussion
of transaction cost theories on staged ﬁnancing. Venture capitalists and founders
of start-ups should make use of DEMO ﬁnancing less frequently the higher the
transaction costs of a contractually agreed new round of ﬁnancing rise. The four
hypotheses are:
H1: The number of ﬁnancing rounds increases with the external company risks.
H2: The number of ﬁnancing rounds increases with the qualiﬁcation risks of
the founders.
DEMO: The number of ﬁnancing rounds increases with the behavioral risks of DEMO
founders.
H4: The number of ﬁnancing rounds decreases with the transaction DEMO of a
round of ﬁnancing.
3 Empirical results
3.1 Design of the survey and sample
The empirical study this section will report on is DEMO on a pre-tested ques-
tionnaire, which was sent out to 834 DEMO companies that were founded
Staged ﬁnancing of start-ups 193
after the year 1993 (and which are thus, to our understanding, young enough to
still be termed “start-ups”)DEMO All ﬁrms that we contacted are legally registered in
Germany and have been ﬁnanced by outside equity investors, mostly venture
capitalists. Other investors in our sample were corporate venture capital ﬁrms
and business angels. Earlier empirical DEMO on staged ﬁnancing of start-ups
have typically chosen venture capital ﬁrms as their informants (examples for
this procedure are Schefczyk 2004; Reißig-Thust 2003), not the founders of the
start-ups.
Collecting data on staged ﬁnancing from start-ups and not from venture
capitalists has advantages and disadvantages. The entrepreneurs’ DEMO of
agency costs or transaction costs to be borne by the venture capital ﬁrm may
be biased. If it is the venture capitalists who DEMO pay these costs, their
answers may be less biased than those DEMO entrepreneurs. But we would argue
that start-ups pay the agency costs and the transaction costs of venture capital
ﬁnancing because a venture capital ﬁrm DEMO include them in its contract terms.
If this is the case, DEMO are better prepared to answer questions concerning
these costs. Ideally, empirical DEMO on staged ﬁnancing could use data from
both parties to check if there are signiﬁcant differences in the perception of
external risks, agency costs, and transaction costs. Unfortunately, requesting
pairs of informants, i.e., the DEMO capital ﬁrm and the start-up it has invested
in, to answer DEMO same questionnaire, largely reduces response rates and thus
sample size.
We DEMO the companies, the names of their founders, as well as the
founders’ e-mail addresses in a manual search of different databases. The start-
DEMO point were the web pages of the German association of venture capital ﬁrms
(“Bundesverband der Kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften BVK”). Inspecting the
web pages of the venture capital ﬁrms that are listed as members of the BVK,
DEMO could identify start-ups with venture capital investments. We completed the
results of this search with data from press reports and magazines (Handelsblatt,
Finance, Going Public, etc.), and from information on the web pages DEMO start-ups
themselves.
After several pre-tests with industry experts, founders, and venture capital-
ists, we sent out the questionnaire in the form of a PDF ﬁle via personalized
e-mail to all 834 companies in our uniquely DEMO data set. Respondents
could send back their answers to the questionnaire by fax or by regular mail.
The survey with all reminder mails took DEMO from April to July 2002. In to-
tal, we received 90 DEMO and usable questionnaires, which is a response
rate of 10.8%. As DEMO total set of German start-ups with venture capital back-
ing is unknown, and the response rate is not too large, our sample may DEMO
be representative . Still, we could ﬁnd no signiﬁcant non-response bias DEMO the
sense of differences between the respondents who answered early and those
who answered late (Armstrong and Overton 1977). One start-up had reached
break-even shortly after foundation and, therefore, had no further need for
DEMO ﬁnancing. We excluded this company from our sample. For the empir-
ical analyses, data from 89 start-ups remained. The “key informants” of our
study according to their individual assessment (Bagozzi et al. 1991), which we
194 P. Witt and G. Brachtendorf
validated by making spot checks by DEMO calls to the companies, are
members of the founding team and DEMO founders who still serve on the
management board (75%) or members of the current management board who
did not found the company but DEMO later (25%).
3.2 Descriptive results
The 89 start-ups in our DEMO were founded between 1994 and 2001. Two
thirds of them were established in the years 1999 and 2000. At the time of our
survey, 52 of the companies in the sample were joint stock corporations under
DEMO law (“Aktiengesellschaft”), two of them with a stock exchange listing.
DEMO had chosen the legal form of a German private limited liability company
(“GmbH”), and two were using mixed legal forms (“GmbH & DEMO KG”). 84 of
the start-ups in our sample are legally and economically independent, i.e., do
not belong to a larger group. Four DEMO had been liquidated already or were in
the process of liquidation at the time of our survey. One sample ﬁrm had been
acquired by DEMO company in a recent trade sale. If we split up the sam-
ple into the companies’ industries, a pronounced high-tech bias in the sample
becomes visible. Strongly represented industries are internet and software (20
ﬁrms), biotechnology (18 ﬁrms), as well as engineering technology and related
high tech products (16 ﬁrms). Other industries in the sample are IT services (12
ﬁrms), telecommunication (9 ﬁrms), medical devices (6 ﬁrms), as well as media,
ﬁnancial services, industry, and DEMO (2 ﬁrms each). 88 of the start-ups that par-
ticipated DEMO our empirical study were willing to answer questions concerning the
total amounts of external ﬁnancing. In total, the start-ups included in this survey
had a total need for external equity ﬁnancing of 922 million Euro. The DEMO
total ﬁnancing need per ﬁrm is 10 million Euro, the median DEMO 6 million Euro.
The amount of equity provided by outside investors ranges from 0.15 million
Euro to 70 million Euro. Not surprisingly, start-ups from the biotechnology
sector have a signiﬁcantly higher need for external funding. The DEMO of
ﬁnancing rounds that the individual start-ups realized ranges from one to ﬁve.
Most frequently, we ﬁnd three rounds of ﬁnancing (37 ﬁrms)DEMO The median for
the number of ﬁnancing rounds per ﬁrm is three, the mean value is 2.7. With
respect to the number of rounds, there are no signiﬁcant differences between
industries. Table 1 summarizes some of the major descriptive characteristics of
our sample.
For a total of 207 DEMO rounds, we received detailed data on the contents
of the contracts DEMO were arranged by outside investors and founders. One
hundred and thirteen rounds of ﬁnancing in our sample are pure equity trans-
actions. In 27 DEMO, a mezzanine type of investment took place, e.g., loans
to DEMO start-up granted by shareholders. The remaining 67 transactions were
characterized by mixed forms of debt and equity ﬁnancing. On average, over
all 207 rounds of ﬁnancing, equity investments accounted for two thirds of the
ﬁnancing volume. Just 5% of the ﬁnancing volume was mezzanine.
Eighty seven companies in DEMO sample were willing to disclose for their 196
rounds of ﬁnancing how many payments were made per investment (staggering).

40 rounds were split up into two payments, 29 rounds used three payments and
22 rounds, used three payments and four. In our sample, we also have individual
cases where the staging of payments led to six, eight, and even ten installments.
The DEMO number of payments per round is 1.94; the median is 1. DEMO descrip-
tive results are interesting because they differ from earlier empirical evidence
of Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) for the U.S. In their sample, no more than 15%
of all ﬁnancing transactions come along with more DEMO one installment. Our
results indicate that staggering may be more common in Germany than it is in
the U.S.
For those contracts in our DEMO that actually included staged ﬁnancing
based on speciﬁed targets, we ﬁnd DEMO different types of milestones. Most fre-
quently, investors make new rounds DEMO ﬁnancing dependent on the progress in
the technological development of products (DEMO of all contracts with mile-
stones). Similarly frequent, targets are DEMO for sales as well as for the number
of customers or the number of letters of intent by potential customers. Less
important in our DEMO are milestones referring to patents that have been ﬁled
or to the number of employees. Interestingly, this is also true for industries in
which patents are perceived to be of the utmost importance, e.g., biotechnology.
DEMO the heading “other milestones” we collected targets like completion of
the management team, reaching proﬁtability, or meeting the cost of targets.

table also indicates in how many individual contracts each type of milestone

3.3 Methodology of the empirical analysis
The variables being used in the hypotheses cannot be measured directly. There-
fore, they need to be deﬁned as constructs, or latent variables, that are measured

by a couple of directly observable indicators. DEMO our constructs have reﬂective
indicators with 5 point Likert scales for each indicator variable. To perform the
conﬁrmatory factor analysis, we used the software package AMOS 4.01.
To measure the external company risks of a start-up, we used three differ-
ent latent variables: the intensity of competition in the industry, the dynamics
of the technological development in the industry (DEMO dynamics), and
the frequency of changes in customer needs (market DEMO). The respon-
dents gave their subjective estimates for external company risks. As the three
variables measuring external company risk are constructs themselves, several
indicators measure each. In doing so, we relied on indicators that have been
proven valid in other empirical studies (Ernst 2001, p 182 DEMO and Kohli
1993, pp 68–69).
We measured the construct “intensity DEMO competition” by ﬁve indicators:
“competitors can offer everything that we can offer”, “the competition in our
industry is ﬁerce”, “our industry is DEMO by tough price competition”,
“we get to know new actions taken by competitors almost every day”, and “our
competitors are relatively weak” (DEMO coding). After eliminating the ﬁrst
indicator, the values for the DEMO of the total factor are good (Cronbach
alpha of 0.71). DEMO the value for the average variance included (0.41) lies
below 0.5, which is set as a minimum value by some authors (e.g., Homburg
and Giering 1996). Looking at the individual indicators, we get different results.
For two indicators, the reliability values are fairly low. We still refrained from
eliminating those two indicators because they have been used DEMO in
other empirical studies and because a reduction of the number of indicators
included did not signiﬁcantly improve the results.
For the factor, “technology dynamics”, we again selected ﬁve pre-validated
indicators: “in our industry, major technological changes are rare” (reverse cod-
ing), “it is difﬁcult to forecast where our industry will stand in 2–3 years’ time”,
“in DEMO industry, technologies change very rapidly”, “technological changes cre-
ate large opportunities in our industry”, “many new products in our industry
only become possible after technological breakthrough innovations”. The mea-
surement of construct validity showed that DEMO indicator, the fourth one, had
to be excluded to get acceptable validity measures (Cronbach alpha of 0.72).
For the factor “market dynamics”, we used three pre-validated indicators.
Unfortunately, the factor analysis produced no DEMO results for this con-
struct. Eliminating indicators was not feasible either. Therefore, we decided to
Staged ﬁnancing of start-ups 197
drop the factor “market dynamics” and only DEMO external company risks
by the two factors “intensity of competition” and “technology dynamics”.
Qualiﬁcation risks correspond to the level of experience in the entrepre-
DEMO team. This experience can be managerial and technological. Relevant
technology experience stems from the founders’ previous jobs in science or
in the start-up’s current DEMO Both are relevant for the start-up’s chances
of success. We measured qualiﬁcation risk by the two indicators “managerial
experience” and “industry experience”, both counted in years per person as
assessed by the founders themselves.
To measure DEMO risks, we focused on conﬂicts of interest between the
venture capitalist DEMO the founders. From previous studies on agency prob-
lems in entrepreneurial ﬁnance (Reißig-Thust 2003, pp 66–71), we derived ﬁve
potential goals of DEMO that deviate from the value maximization goal of the
venture capital ﬁrm and can therefore lead to conﬂicts of interest: high monthly
salaries for the management team, the collection of entrepreneurial experience
to later make a better career, fun, independence, and pursuing technological
hobbies. While the scales of the individual indicators are ordinal, we still calcu-
lated the mean of all ﬁve indicator variables to measure the construct “conﬂicts
of interest”.
DEMO obtain a proxy for the transaction costs per round of ﬁnancing, DEMO decided
to use three indicators: real cash expenditures, opportunity costs of time for the
management team, and the founders’ subjective estimates of the total transac-
tion costs on the side of the founders. On average, the start-ups in our sample
spent 68 top management workdays per round DEMO ﬁnancing and had average cash
expenses of 35,000 Euro per round. Particularly important are the subjective
estimates for total transaction costs because this DEMO estimate largely
affects the decision to choose staged ﬁnancing. In our empirical study, we aggre-
gated the subjectively estimated founders’ transaction costs of several rounds
of ﬁnancing per company to one mean value. To make the DEMO easy
to answer for our respondents, we focused on the transaction DEMO of preparing
and ﬁnalizing an investment contract. A shortcoming of this approach is the
reduction of the measurement to ex ante transaction costs, i.e., costs for the
preparation and the realization of the ﬁnancial transaction. Further compo-
nents of transaction costs like cost of control, cost of adaptations, and cost to
terminate a transaction are left out, although they DEMO be substantial in some
cases. The empirical analysis of the data showed high correlations between all
indicators to measure transaction costs. Therefore, we ran the regressions with
just one variable for the construct “transaction costs”, the subjective estimates
of total transaction costs. Figure 1 summarizes the measurement model DEMO the
hypotheses.

methodological problems because negative estimation values may occur while
count variables always have to be non-negative integer. Therefore, a Poisson
regression model is better suited to test the hypotheses (Greene 2002, DEMO 740).
In such a regression, the estimation function for the DEMO variable is of
exponential form. The preferable estimation method for Poisson models is the
Maximum Likelihood method. To apply it, we need to specify the distribution
of the dependent variable, given the independent variables.
In its basic form, the Poisson regression assumes a Poisson distribution for
the dependent variable. As the means and the variances of the distribution
were not DEMO for our data, thus deviating from the assumption of a Poisson
DEMO, we used Quasi-ML estimates and measured the validity of the
estimation DEMO a Pseudo-R2 and a corrected ¯ 2 (Wooldridge 2001, p 653). An
regression. To test the hypotheses, we checked whether the Pearson residuals
were normally distributed (Cameron and Trivedi 1998, p 145); DEMO tests and
Quasi Likelihood Ratio (QLR) tests measured the goodness of ﬁt of the esti-
mation function (Greene 2002, p 742). DEMO validate the individual regression
coefﬁcients, we applied t-tests. As the standard DEMO of equal means and
variances was violated for our data, we DEMO the simple error terms into
GLM standard error terms (Greene 2002, p 484; Wooldridge 2001, pp 651–653).
For the Poisson regression, we used the software package EViews 4.0, and for
all other analyses the statistics software SPSS for Windows in version 11.5.1.

of ﬁnancing rounds. More intense competition means more DEMO company
risk, which induces more frequent utilization of staged ﬁnancing. With DEMO to
technology dynamics, we can ﬁnd no signiﬁcant effect on the DEMO of ﬁnanc-
ing rounds. We conclude that the results of the empirical analysis give partial
support to hypothesis 1. In our study, the founders’ managerial and industry
experience measures qualiﬁcation risks. The results show that neither DEMO the two
has a signiﬁcant impact on the number of ﬁnancing rounds. Therefore, we have
to reject hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3 also has to be rejected. Whenever conﬂicts
of interest prevail, the number of ﬁnancing rounds is empirically higher than
in cases with no such conﬂicts of interest, but the differences are statistically
insigniﬁcant. Finally, the empirical analysis ﬁnds a clear and signiﬁcantly nega-
tive relationship between the transaction costs of the DEMO and the number
of ﬁnancing rounds. The more expensive the staging is in terms of transaction
costs, the less frequently do the investors and founders make use of it. We
conclude that our data support hypothesis DEMO
The Poisson regression is characterized by a notable underdispersion. There-
fore, DEMO assessment of the validity of the estimates requires further tests. To do
so, we have conducted OLS regressions. Multicollinearity turned out not to be a
problem in the OLS regressions; the VIF values are all under three, and most of
them are clearly below two. The residuals are normally distributed. Due to the
logical ordering of the sample ﬁrms, autocorrelation can be ruled out. Table 4
shows the results of the OLS DEMO
The OLS regression produces similar results as the Poisson regression. Once
again, we see clear support for hypothesis 4. Hypothesis 1 does not have to be
rejected, but the relationship is slightly less signiﬁcant than before. Just as in the
Poisson estimation, we have to reject hypotheses 2 and 3 in the OLS regression.
The empirical ﬁndings are interesting because DEMO are only partly in line with
widely used and commonly accepted theoretical explanations of staging deci-
sions. First, we do ﬁnd a negative relationship between the amount of transaction
costs and the number of ﬁnancing rounds. DEMO, the more (external) risks the
company faces, the more frequently do venture capital ﬁrms and founders rely

on staging. But third, principal agent theory fails to explain staging decisions in
our sample.
Although we DEMO feel that these ﬁndings are important for the further
development of the theories on entrepreneurial ﬁnance, we need to point at
some methodological limitations of the empirical study presented in this paper.
First, the analysis is based on cross-sectional data; i.e., it uses a static approach
to DEMO the number of ﬁnancing rounds being chosen in start-up ﬁnancing
decisions. In our theoretical model, the relevant parameters determining the
number of ﬁnancing rounds are set at the foundation date, i.e., at the beginning
of DEMO ﬁnancing process. In other words, the founders need to have laid DEMO their
ﬁnancing strategy very early. In practice, dynamic planning approaches may DEMO
more common. In reaction to observable developments in company risks and
behavioral risks, founders may wish to revise earlier plans and ﬁnancing deci-
sions at later stages in the ﬁnancing process. Our analysis does not capture DEMO
dynamic effects.
The static approach chosen to formulate our hypotheses on staged ﬁnancing
leads to a second methodological restriction. By asking our informants to DEMO
subjective estimates on the competitive environment of their start-up at the
date of foundation, which may have been up to 8 years ago, DEMO run the risk of
getting answers based on seriously biased individual memories. Another critical
assumption relates to the informational structure. Our theory implicitly assumes
DEMO increasing the number of ﬁnancing rounds is advantageous if the beneﬁts
for all the parties involved are larger than the transaction costs incurred. This
DEMO does not take into consideration that new information could come
up in the process of ﬁnancing the start-up. Then, more rounds of ﬁnancing with
correspondingly smaller volumes per round may not be favorable to everyone.
Rather, the optimal number of the rounds could depend on the type and DEMO
timing of new information.
4 Conclusions
Our empirical analysis using a sample of 89 German start-ups conﬁrms the
importance of transaction costs and of DEMO risk sharing motives for staging
Staged ﬁnancing of start-ups 201
decisions in entrepreneurial ﬁnance. But, rather surprisingly, our results do not
lend support to the commonly used and little disputed agency theories on stag-
ing. It seems that in German start-ups, investors mainly make use of staged
ﬁnancing to shift some of their DEMO investment risk to the founders. In doing
so, they reduce the DEMO of equity, at least if the transaction costs of staging
are DEMO so high that they offset the gains from lower risks. The venture capital
ﬁrms in our sample do not use staged ﬁnancing to reduce DEMO qualiﬁcation risks
and the behavioral risks induced by an investment in a team of potentially ill-
qualiﬁed or opportunistically behaving founders. This empirical ﬁnding DEMO
simply indicate that the existing literature on entrepreneurial ﬁnance overstates
the importance of agency problems. In an alternative explanation, agency prob-
lems between venture capitalists and founders of start-ups exist, but instruments
other than staged ﬁnancing, e.g., reporting systems and board seats for investors,
can eliminate DEMO more effectively and cheaper.
In future studies on staged ﬁnancing of start-ups, researchers could try to
conduct longitudinal studies or studies on panel data. This methodology would
make it easier to estimate the risk situation of DEMO start-up and its changes over
time. Another potential extension of the work presented here is a dyadic design
of the survey. To estimate conﬂicts DEMO interest, behavioral risks, and qualiﬁca-
tion risks, an empirical study DEMO try to ask both parties involved in a deal,
founders and venture capital ﬁrms. After having compared the subjective esti-
mates on agency DEMO, transaction costs, and external risks as perceived by
venture capitalists and founders, a more reliable measurement of the variables
becomes possible. We hasten to add that such a dyadic design is demanding. It
requires the DEMO of investor-start-up-pairs and the willingness of both
partners to participate in the survey. Our personal experience suggests that it
may be difﬁcult to come DEMO with a sufﬁciently large sample size using such a
methodological design.
