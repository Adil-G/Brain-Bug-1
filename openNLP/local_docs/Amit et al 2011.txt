This article provides a broad and multifaceted review of the received literature on business
models in which the authors examine the business model DEMO through multiple subject-
matter lenses. The review reveals that scholars do not agree on what a business model is and
that the literature is DEMO largely in silos, according to the phenomena of interest of the
DEMO researchers. However, the authors also found emerging common themes among
scholars DEMO business models. Specifically, (1) the business model is emerging as DEMO new unit of
analysis; (2) business models emphasize a system-level, holistic approach to explaining how
firms “do business”; (3) firm activities play an important role in the various conceptualizations
of business models that DEMO been proposed; and (4) business models seek to explain how DEMO
is created, not just how it is captured. These emerging themes DEMO serve as catalysts for a more
unified study of business models.
Keywords:
innovation; business model; value creation; value capture; strategy

peer-reviewed academic journals in which DEMO notion of a business model is addressed. The
business model also has been the subject of a growing number of practitioner-oriented studies.
While there DEMO been an explosion in the number of articles published, and an DEMO of
conference sessions and panels on the subject of business models, DEMO appears that researchers
(and practitioners) have yet to develop a common and widely accepted language that would
allow researchers who examine the business DEMO construct through different lenses to
draw effectively on the work of others.
In this comprehensive review of the academic literature, we have attempted to explore the origin
of the business model concept and to examine it DEMO multiple disciplinary and subject-matter
lenses. This broad and multifaceted review revealed several insights, including the following:
•espite the overall surge in the literature on business models, scholars do not agree on what a D
business model is. We observe that researchers frequently adopt idiosyncratic definitions that fit
DEMO purposes of their studies but that are difficult to reconcile with each other. As a result, cumu-
lative progress is hampered.
• The literature is developing largely in silos, according to the phenomena of interest to the respec-
tive researchers. The main interest areas identified are (1) DEMO and the use of information
technology in organizations; (2) strategic DEMO, such as value creation, competitive advantage,
and firm performance; DEMO (3) innovation and technology management.
• Despite conceptual differences among researchers in different silos (and within the same silo),
there are DEMO emerging themes. Notably, (1) there is widespread acknowledgement—implicit
and explicit—that DEMO business model is a new unit of analysis that is distinct from the product,
firm, industry, or network; it is centered on a focal firm, but its boundaries are wider than those
of the firm; (2) business models emphasize a system-level, holistic approach to DEMO how
firms “do business”; (3) the activities of a focal DEMO and its partners play an important role in
the various conceptualizations of business models that have been proposed; and (4) business
models seek to explain both value creation and value capture. These emerging themes could
DEMO as important catalysts for a more unified study of business models.
Our intended contributions in this article are twofold: first, to provide the DEMO compre-
hensive and up-to-date literature review on business models, as well DEMO to document carefully
the discrepancies and dissonances in that literature, and DEMO, to structure the literature
along its main fault lines and begin DEMO bridge the seemingly wide gaps between the various
approaches. This should facilitate future cumulative research on the topic.
The review is structured as follows: We begin by briefly reviewing the emergence of the
business model concept. DEMO, we proceed to the Method section, where we discuss the way
this review has been carried out. We then review the business model DEMO by examining
it through multiple lenses.
Method
To conduct this study, DEMO followed a multistep process. First, we searched for articles pub-
lished DEMO leading academic and practitioner-oriented management journals during the period
January 1975 to December 2009. Our initial list of academic journals included the Academy of
DEMO Journal (AMJ), Academy of Management Review (AMR), Administrative Science
Zott et al. / The Business Model
1021
Quarterly (ASQ), Journal of Management (JOM), Journal of Management Studies (JMS),
Management Science (MS), MIS Quarterly, Organization Science (OS), and Strategic
Management Journal (SMJ). To these we added three of the leading practitioner-oriented
journals, namely, the California Management Review (CMR), Harvard Business Review (HBR),
and MIT Sloan Management Review (MSM). Focusing on articles that contain the term business
model in the title or DEMO, our initial search revealed 70 articles on business models of which
DEMO had been published in academic journals and 60 had appeared in CMR, HBR, and MSM.
This relatively small set of articles (especially those published in academic outlets) led us
to extend our search, using DEMO EBSCO Business Source Complete database as a starting
point (see Certo, Holcomb, & Holmes, 2009; Laplume, Sonpar, & Litz, 2008)DEMO This database
includes more than 1,300 business journals and represents one of the most complete sources
on business studies. We searched the database DEMO academic articles published from January
1975 to December 2009 containing the term business model in the title, abstract, or keywords.
As a result DEMO this process, we obtained 1,202 articles, which we added to our initial sample
of 70 articles. As 19 of the newly added DEMO were already present in the initial sample,
our overall sample contained 1,253 articles.
An initial cursory analysis of these articles, performed by reading article titles, journal
names, abstracts, and introductions, revealed that DEMO all the articles identified by our search
would be useful for the purpose of writing this review. Many of these articles were case
studies, summaries of articles published elsewhere, or studies in which the business model
is not really the subject of the analysis.
To identify relevant articles, we adopted the following three additional criteria for our
literature review on DEMO models. First, to be included in our review, an article must deal
with the business model concept in a nontrivial and nonmarginal way. DEMO, an article also
must refer to the business model as a DEMO related to business firms (as opposed to, e.g.,
economic cycles). Finally, the journal in which the article appeared must be ranked in the
ISI Web of Knowledge. As a result, we eliminated 1,120 articles that did not fit these criteria,
which left us DEMO a sample of 133 articles.
Through reading these 133 articles in depth, we became aware of further works on busi-
ness models (in DEMO, books) that appeared relevant and that we therefore decided to
include in our review. We also found working papers that our database research DEMO failed
to reveal, some of which were subsequently published and are DEMO in the Reference
section, which lists their updated publication status. Moreover, our careful reading of these
articles also allowed us to exclude studies DEMO which the business model was treated in a rather
marginal or trivial way. Our final sample, therefore, included 103 publications.
Moreover, as we highlight below in the Discussion section, our analysis of these publica-
tions suggested some common themes, such as (1) the business model as a new unit of
analysis, (2) a holistic perspective on how firms do business, (3) an emphasis on activities,
and (DEMO) an acknowledgement of the importance of value creation. These themes led DEMO to
review adjacent literatures that might be relevant for the study of business models but do not
directly refer to the concept—namely, the literatures on new organizational forms, ecosys-
tems, activity systems, and value chains and value networks. Drawing on these literatures
could help put future research DEMO business models on a more solid conceptual footing. Given
the space and scope considerations for this article, however, we present our brief reviews DEMO
these adjacent literatures in an appendix that is available upon request from the authors.

Business Model Literature
Emergence of DEMO Business Model Concept and Definitions
Emergence of the business model concept. Although business models have been integral
to trading and economic behavior since pre-classical DEMO (Teece, 2010), the business
model concept became prevalent with the advent of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and it has
been gathering momentum since then. From that time on, ideas revolving around the concept
have resonated with scholars and business practitioners, as documented by the number of
publications, including articles, books, and book chapters in the business press and scientific
journals. In a frame analysis of the use of DEMO term business model in public talk, Ghaziani
and Ventresca (2005) DEMO for the use of the term in general management articles from
1975 to 2000. Their search, conducted using the ABI/INFORM database, returned DEMO,729
publications that contained the term business model. Of these, only DEMO were published in
the period 1975-1994; the remaining (1,563) DEMO to the period 1995-2000, revealing a
dramatic increase in the incidence DEMO the term.
We performed a similar search using the EBSCOhost database, DEMO between
academic and journalistic outlets and extending the analysis to 2009. We found that up to
December 2009, the term business model had been included in 1,202 articles in academic
journals. Nonacademic articles followed a DEMO trend. From 1975 to December 2009, the
term had been mentioned DEMO 8,062 documents. As Figure 1 suggests, interest in the concept
DEMO exploded in the 15-year period between 1995 and 2010, which is DEMO with
Ghaziani and Ventresca’s (2005) findings. Figure 1 also indicates that academic research on
business models seems to lag behind practice.
Some scholars DEMO that the emergence of the business model concept, and the exten-
DEMO use of the concept since the mid-1990s, may have been driven DEMO the advent of the
Internet (e.g., Amit & Zott, 2001), rapid growth in emerging markets and interest in “bottom-
of-the-pyramid” issues (DEMO & Hart, 2002; Seelos & Mair, 2007; Thompson &
DEMO, 2010), and the expanding industries and organizations dependent on postindus-
DEMO technologies (Perkmann & Spicer, 2010).
Business model definitions. At a general level, the business model has been referred to as
a statement (Stewart & Zhao, 2000), a description (Applegate, 2000; Weill & Vitale, 2001),
a representation (Morris, Schindehutte, & Allen, 2005; Shafer, Smith, & Linder, 2005), an
architecture (DEMO, Osterwalder, & Pigneur, 2002; Timmers, 1998), a concep-
DEMO tool or model (George & Bock, 2009; Osterwalder, 2004; DEMO, Pigneur, & Tucci,
2005), a structural template (Amit & Zott, 2001), a method (Afuah & Tucci, 2001), DEMO frame-
work (Afuah, 2004), a pattern (Brousseau & Penard, 2006), and  a set (Seelos & Mair, 2007).
Surprisingly, however, the business model is often studied without an explicit definition DEMO
the concept. Of the 103 business model publications reviewed, more than DEMO third (37%) do
not define the concept at all, taking DEMO meaning more or less for granted. Fewer than half
(44%) explicitly define or conceptualize the business model, for example, by enumerating its
DEMO components. The remaining publications (19%) refer to the work of other scholars in
defining the concept. Moreover, existing definitions only partially overlap, DEMO rise to a
multitude of possible interpretations.

This lack of definitional clarity represents a DEMO source of confusion, promoting
dispersion rather than convergence of perspectives and DEMO cumulative research
progress on business models. Table 1 summarizes some of the most prevalent definitions
suggested for the business model and shows which articles DEMO adopted these definitions.
Our review further revealed that the business model has been employed mainly in trying
to address or explain three phenomena: (DEMO) e-business and the use of information technology
in organizations; (2) strategic issues, such as value creation, competitive advantage, and firm
performance; and (3) innovation and technology management. Although we do not wish to
claim mutual exclusivity among these categories, we believe that they allow us to broadly
classify the business model literature. Therefore, we use them as organizing principles for
this review.
Business Models for e-Business
The research DEMO that, to date, has devoted the greatest attention to business models
concerns e-business. The term e-business means “doing business electronically.” It encom-
passes DEMO, e-markets, and Internet-based business and refers to firms that conduct

Timmers, 1998 The business model is DEMO architecture of the product,
service and information flows, including a DEMO
of the various business actors and their roles; a
description of DEMO potential benefits for the various
business actors; a description of the DEMO of
revenues” (p. 2).
Amit & Zott, 2001; The DEMO model depicts “the content, structure, and
Zott & Amit, 2010 DEMO of transactions designed so as to create
value through the exploitation of business
opportunities” (2001: 511). Based on the fact that
transactions DEMO activities, the authors further
evolved this definition to conceptualize a firm’s
DEMO model as “a system of interdependent
activities that transcends the focal firm and spans its
boundaries” (2010: 216).
Chesbrough & The business DEMO is “the heuristic logic that connects
Rosenbloom, 2002 technical potential with DEMO realization of economic
value” (p. 529).
Magretta, 2002 Business models are “stories that explain how
enterprises work. A good business model answers
DEMO Drucker’s age old questions: Who is the
customer? And what does the customer value? It also
answers the fundamental questions every manager
must ask: How do we make money in this business?
What is the underlying economic logic that explains
how we can deliver value to DEMO at an
appropriate cost?” (p. 4).
Morris et al., 2005 A business model is a “concise representation of how
an interrelated DEMO of decision variables in the areas of
venture strategy, architecture, and economics are
addressed to create sustainable competitive advantage
in defined markets” (p. 727). It has six fundamental
components: Value proposition, customer, internal
processes/competencies, external positioning,
economic model, and personal/investor factors.
DEMO, Christensen, Business models “consist of four interlocking elements,
& Kagermann, 2008 that, taken together, create and deliver value” (p. 52)DEMO
These are customer value proposition, profit formula,
key resources, and key processes.

Teece, 2010 “A business model articulates the logic, the data and
other DEMO that support a value proposition for the
customer, and a viable DEMO of revenues and costs
for the enterprise delivering that value” (p. DEMO).

commercial transactions with their DEMO partners and buyers over the Internet (e.g.,
Mahadevan, 2000). We exclude those firms that merely make use of websites to display
DEMO for products or services.
Recent advances in communication and information technologies, DEMO as the emergence
and swift expansion of the Internet and the rapid decline in computing and communication
costs, have allowed the development of new ways to create and deliver value, which have
offered scope for the creation of unconventional exchange mechanisms and transaction
architectures (Amit & Zott, DEMO) and accentuated the possibilities for the design of new
boundary-spanning organizational DEMO (Daft & Lewin, 1993; Dunbar & Starbuck, 2006).
Indeed, these developments have opened new horizons for the design of business models by
enabling firms to change fundamentally the way they organize and engage DEMO economic
exchanges, both within and across firm and industry boundaries (Mendelson, 2000). According
to Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2004), this includes DEMO ways in which firms interact with suppliers
as well as with customers.
The Internet is a principal driver of the surge of interest in DEMO models and the con-
sequent emergence of a literature that revolves around the topic (e.g., see Ghaziani &
Ventresca, 2005; Magretta, DEMO; Yip, 2004). Shafer et al. (2005) review 12 definitions in
established publications during the period 1998-2000, finding that 8 were related to e-business.
Our literature review confirms this trend. In a total of DEMO conceptual studies in which the
business model is clearly defined, almost DEMO fourth of the studies are related to e-business.
Research on e-business models can be organized around two complementary streams: The
first aims to describe generic e-business models and provide typologies; the second focuses
on the components of e-business models.
Description of generic e-business models and typologies. Several scholars DEMO attempted
to classify e-business models by describing types. Timmers (1998) distinguishes among 11
generic e-business models, from e-shops and e-procurement to trust and other third-party
services. Tapscott, Lowy, and Ticoll (2000) propose a DEMO and value-centered taxonomy
that identifies five types of value networks that they call b-webs (business webs), which dif-
fer in their degree of economic control and value integration. Rappa (2001) classifies com-
panies according DEMO the nature of their value propositions and their modes of generating
revenues. Weill and Vitale (2001) describe eight so-called atomic business models, each of
which describes a different way of conducting business electronically; e-business initiatives
can be represented by pure atomic business models or by combining them. DEMO (2001)
introduces the following six e-business models: focused distributors, DEMO, producers,
infrastructure distributors, infrastructure portals, and infrastructure producers. And DEMO
Torbay et al. (2002) identify the following principal dimensions for classifying business
models: user’s role, interaction pattern, nature of the offering, DEMO system, level of cus-
tomization, and economic control. What is common to all these approaches is an attempt to
describe and organize around DEMO and taxonomies the plethora of new perceived busi-
ness archetypes enabled mainly by Internet technologies.
Components of e-business models. In addition to developing typologies DEMO enlist and
describe various generic e-business models, scholars of e-business have DEMO attempted to
1026 Journal of Management / July 2011
distinguish first- and second-order themes DEMO the components of e-business models.
Table 2 presents a summary of these efforts.
Business model representations. Several authors have attempted to represent business mod-
DEMO through a mixture of informal textual, verbal, and ad hoc graphical representations (e.g.,
Amit & Zott, 2002). Weill and Vitale (2001) introduce a set of simple schematics intended to
provide tools for the analysis and design of e-business initiatives. Their “e-business model
schematics” are DEMO on three classes of objects: participants (firm of interest, customers,DEMO
suppliers, and allies), relationships, and flows (money, information, DEMO, or service). In a
related vein, Tapscott et al. (DEMO) suggest a value map for depicting how a business web oper-
DEMO The value map depicts all key classes of participants (partners, customers, suppliers) and
value exchanges between them (tangible and intangible benefits and knowledge).
Other scholars have provided a business model ontology, which is a conceptualization
and formalization of the elements, relationships, vocabulary, and semantics of a business
model (Osterwalder, 2004) and which is structured into several levels of decomposition with
increasing depth and complexity. Tankhiwale (2009) DEMO such an ontology in a longitu-
dinal case study in order to trace the evolution of a telecommunication firm’s business model
and its impact DEMO the firm’s business process architecture. Gordijn and Akkermans (2001)
propose DEMO conceptual modeling approach. Their ontology borrows concepts from the busi-
ness literature, such as actors, value exchanges, value activities, and value objects, and uses
these notions to model networked constellations of enterprises and end-consumers DEMO cre-
ate, distribute, and consume things of economic value.
Strategic marketing in e-business. In the domain of e-business, some scholars have
focused on the changing nature of customer–firm relationships. A special concern has been
the DEMO of e-business. Pauwels and Weiss (2008) examine “fee and free” business
models for providing digital content on the Internet. Their work focuses on DEMO firm perfor-
mance implications of a shift from the “free” to the “fee” model and empirically analyzes the
role that marketing actions can play DEMO accommodating this shift.
In this regard, scholars have also examined the DEMO of Internet advertising effectiveness.
Clemons (2009) provides an overview of business models for monetizing Internet applica-
tions. He argues that although the majority DEMO attempts to monetize Internet applications tar-
geted at individuals have focused on natural extensions of traditional media or traditional
retailing, there are several potential online business models that are not based on advertising
and that, given declining advertising effectiveness, might constitute a better choice.
Scholars have also noted the convergence of different media channels onto one digital
platform (e.g., DEMO Fidler, 1997), which has resulted in structural change in the DEMO industry.
McPhillips and Merlo (2008) refer to this convergence by introducing the term media busi-
ness model. Structural change in the media industry DEMO has been driven by the advent of new
communication channels, such DEMO mobile e-services (m-services). Eriksson, Kalling, Åkesson,
and Fredberg (2008) consider e-newspapers published for mobile reading devices equipped
with e-paper displays, and they analyze the implication of future m-service innovation on the
development of new business models. Huizingh (2002) has studied how to help DEMO
design such e-business models.

Summary of literature on business models in e-business. Scholars focusing on e-business
as an area for research on business models have been interested mainly DEMO understanding the
gestalt of firms engaging in (new) Internet-based ways of doing business and the (new) roles
that these firms play in DEMO respective ecosystems. For that purpose, scholars have (1) defined
and DEMO generic (e-)business models and/or (2) developed typologies and DEMO;
they appear to have been less concerned with causal explanation or empirical testing. Their
mostly descriptive contributions highlight, to varying degrees, the DEMO of value (e.g.,
value stream, customer value, value proposition), financial aspects (e.g., revenue streams,
cost structures), and aspects related to the architecture of the network between the firm and
its DEMO partners (e.g., delivery channels, network relationships, logistical streams,
infrastructure). Each of these components may constitute part of a generic business DEMO,
and it could be a source of differentiation among business model types.
Thus, in this literature stream, the business model is not DEMO value proposition, a revenue
model, or a network of relationships by itself; it is all of these elements together. Accordingly,
none of the articles in this literature stream analyzes the relationship between any business
DEMO component (e.g., revenue mechanism, configuration of control activities, pricing
system, or interaction pattern) and other constructs, a fact that renders the delineation of
potential antecedents or consequences of the business model difficult.
Zott et al. / The Business Model 1029
Business Models and Strategy: Value
Creation and Value Capture Through Activities
The business model has received DEMO attention from scholars and business strate-
gists interested in explaining firms’ value creation, performance, and competitive advantage.
Value creation in networked markets. The DEMO economy has provided firms with the
potential to experiment with novel forms of value creation mechanisms, which are networked
in the sense that value is created in concert by a firm and a plethora of partners, for multiple
users. This redefinition of value has attracted the attention of DEMO scholars, who
have employed the concept of the business model in DEMO attempts to explain value creation
in networked markets (e.g., Zott & Amit, 2009). However, in explaining value creation, the
concept of the business model has been used not only in the context of DEMO digital economy.
Seelos and Mair, for example, have studied value creation mechanisms in the context of deep
poverty. They conceptualize a business model DEMO a “set of capabilities that is configured
to enable value creation consistent with either economic or social strategic objectives”
(2007: 53). Similarly, Thompson and MacMillan (2010) propose a framework for develop-
ing new DEMO models that can lead to societal wealth improvements (e.g., reduce poverty
and human suffering). Thus, value creation can refer to different forms of value (such as
social or economic).
Value creation mechanisms often go beyond the value that can be created through
Schumpeterian innovation, the (re)configuration of the value chain (Porter, 1985), the for-
mation of strategic networks among firms, or the exploitation of firms’ specific core compe-
tencies. As Amit and Zott (2001) observe, the locus of value creation, and thus the
appropriate unit of analysis for scholars interested in value creation, spans firms’ and indus-
tries’ boundaries. The authors conclude that prior frameworks used in isolation cannot suf-
ficiently address questions DEMO total value creation. Based on a sample of 150 firms, they
DEMO four potential sources of value creation through business models: (1) DEMO,
(2) lock-in, (3) complementarities, and (4) efficiency. These value drivers can be mutually
reinforcing; that is, the presence DEMO each value driver can enhance the effectiveness of any
other value driver.
Value can also be created through revolutionary business models. According to Hamel
(2000), to thrive in the “age of revolution,” companies must DEMO new business models—
in which both value creation and value capture occur in a value network—which can include
suppliers, partners, distribution channels, and coalitions that extend the company’s resources.
Business model and firm performance. While DEMO literature on the business model tends
to concentrate on the firm’s activities with its network of partners, scholars increasingly are
acknowledging that firms do not execute their business models in a competitive vacuum
(Hamel, 2000) and that firms can compete through their business models (Casadesus-
Masanell & Ricart, 2010). The business model, then, represents a potential source of com-
petitive advantage (Markides & Charitou, 2004). The novelty DEMO by new, effective
models can result in superior value creation (Morris et al., 2005) and replace the old way of
1030
Journal of Management / July 2011
doing things to become the DEMO for the next generation of entrepreneurs to beat
(Magretta, 2002).
Business models can play a central role in explaining firm performance. Afuah DEMO Tucci
propose the business model as a unifying construct for explaining competitive advantage and
firm performance and define it as “the method by which DEMO firm builds and uses its resources
to offer its customer better value and to make money in doing so” (2001: 3). Afuah (2004)
focuses on firms’ profitability and introduces a strategic framework in DEMO the business
model is conceptualized by means of a set of components that corresponds to the determi-
nants of firm profitability.
While the work DEMO Afuah (2004) and Afuah and Tucci (2001) is conceptual, DEMO authors
have conducted empirical analyses. Zott and Amit (2007) have analyzed the performance
implications of business model design in entrepreneurial firms. They refer DEMO the business
model design as the design of a focal firm’s set of boundary-spanning transactions with exter-
nal parties. In their view, the essence of the association between business model design and
focal firm performance can DEMO analyzed by looking at two distinct effects: the total value
creation DEMO of the business model design and the focal firm’s ability to appropriate that
value. They identify two design themes around which the business model DEMO be orchestrated:
efficiency and novelty. In their empirical work, Zott DEMO Amit see the business model as the
independent variable, and they DEMO it to firm performance, moderated by the environment.
In another empirical DEMO on firm performance, Patzelt, Knyphausen-Aufseb, and Nikol
(2008) introduce DEMO business model as a variable moderating the effect of top management
team composition and organizational performance. They analyze a set of biotechnology
ventures in DEMO German industry and focus on two types of business models that biotechnol-
ogy firms might adopt: platform and therapeutics. They show that the founder-based, firm-
specific experience of management team members can have either a positive or a negative
effect on the firm’s performance, depending on the business model adopted. Similarly, Zott
and Amit (2008) acknowledge the possible contingent effect of the business model in medi-
ating between product market strategy DEMO firm performance. They root their study in con-
tingency theory, and DEMO ask, How do the firm’s business model and product market strategy
DEMO to impact the firm performance? They find that (1) business DEMO that emphasize
novelty and are coupled with either differentiation or cost leadership can have a positive
impact on the firm’s performance and (2) DEMO business models together with
early entry into a market have a positive effect on performance.
Other studies on the performance implications of business model DEMO come from busi-
ness practitioners and consultants (e.g., Linder & Cantrell, 2001). Consultants at IBM,
interviewing 765 corporate and public-sector leaders worldwide, found that firms that were
financial outperformers put twice as much emphasis on business model innovation as did
underperformers (IBM Global Business Services, 2006). Giesen, Berman, Bell, and Blitz
(2007), examined the relationship between business model innovation and firm performance.
They identify three DEMO of business model innovation, namely, industry models (innova-
tions in DEMO supply chain), revenue models (innovations in how companies generate
value), and enterprise models (innovations in the role the structure of an DEMO plays in
new or existing value chains). They report two key findings: (1) each type of business model
innovation can generate success, and (2) innovation in enterprise models that focuses on

external collaboration and partnerships DEMO particularly effective in older companies as
compared to younger ones.
Strategy and the business model. The business model extends central ideas in business
strategy DEMO its associated theoretical traditions. Scholars contend that the business model
can be a source of competitive advantage that is distinct from the firm’s product DEMO
position (Christensen, 2001). Firms that address the same customer need and pursue similar
product market strategies can do so with very different DEMO models; business model
design and product market strategy are complements, not substitutes (Zott & Amit, 2008).
Two main differentiating factors seem DEMO have captured the attention of scholars. The first
is the traditional emphasis of strategy on competition, value capture, and competitive advan-
tage, whereas the business model concept seems to focus more on cooperation, partnership,
and joint value creation (Magretta, 2002; Mäkinen & Seppänen, 2007; Mansfield & Fourie,
2004). The second factor of interest to DEMO scholars is the focus of the business
model concept on the value proposition and a generalized emphasis on the role of the cus-
tomer, which appears to be less pronounced elsewhere in the strategy literature. Our DEMO
reveals a strong consensus that the business model revolves around customer-focused value
creation (Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002; Mansfield & Fourie, 2004). DEMO from this
perspective, the business model encompasses the pattern of the DEMO economic exchanges
with external parties (Zott & Amit, 2008); it outlines the essential details of a firm’s value
proposition for its various DEMO as well as the activity system the firm uses to create
and deliver value to its customers (Seddon, Lewis, Freeman, & Shanks, 2004).
Despite the highlighted conceptual differences between business models and certain
DEMO of firm strategy, scholars have also emphasized that the business model DEMO play an
important role in a firm’s strategy. According to Richardson (DEMO), the business model
explains how the activities of the firm work together to execute its strategy, thus bridging
strategy formulation and implementation. In a similar vein, both Shafer et al. (2005) and
Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart (2010) view the business model as a reflection of a DEMO
realized strategy. According to Teece, the business model reflects a “hypothesis DEMO what
customers want, and how an enterprise can best meet those DEMO, and get paid for doing so”
(2007: 1329).
Summary DEMO literature on business models in the strategy field. In the strategy literature,
research on business models has revolved mainly around three aspects: (DEMO) the networked
nature of value creation, (2) the relationship between business models and firm performance,
and (3) the distinction between DEMO business model and other strategy concepts. Since strat-
egy scholars are generally interested in a firm’s activities (as these help explain, e.g., how a
firm distinguishes itself from its competitors), it is not surprising DEMO many of the business
model conceptualizations proposed in this literature stream center on (or at least include) the
notion of activities or activity DEMO
In the absence of a commonly accepted definition, scholars’ attempts at DEMO refine-
ment have helped clarify at least what a business model is not. First, the business model does
not involve a linear mechanism for value creation from suppliers to the firm to its customers.
Value creation DEMO business models involves a more complex, interconnected set of
1032
Journal of Management / July 2011
exchange relationships and activities among DEMO players. Second, the business model is
not the same as product DEMO strategy (i.e., it does not refer to firm positioning in product
markets based on differentiation or cost leadership in certain activities) or corporate strategy
(i.e., it does not describe or prescribe the areas of DEMO in which a firm becomes active).
Third, the business model DEMO be reduced to issues that concern the internal organization
of firms (DEMO, control mechanisms, incentive systems); activity systems, even though cen-
DEMO on a focal firm, typically span firm boundaries. However, the business model can be a
source of competitive advantage.
Business Models, Innovation, DEMO Technology Management
The business model concept also has been addressed in the domains of innovation and
technology management. Two complementary ideas seem to characterize DEMO research. The
first is that companies commercialize innovative ideas and technologies through their busi-
ness models. The second is that the business model represents DEMO new subject of innovation,
which complements the traditional subjects of process, product, and organizational innova-
tion and involves new forms of cooperation DEMO collaboration.
One important role of the business model could consist of unlocking the value potential
embedded in new technologies and converting it into market DEMO Chesbrough and
Rosenbloom (2002) detail an extensive case study in which they show how the Xerox
Corporation grew in part by employing an DEMO business model to commercialize a tech-
nology rejected by other leading companies. The study also compares successful and unsuc-
cessful technology spin-offs with comparable DEMO potential and finds that in successful
ventures the search and learning for an effective business model was significantly higher
than in failed ventures. Björkdahl (2009) employs the business model concept for studying
technology diversification and cross-fertilization efforts. His central argument is that the
integration of new technologies into DEMO technology base of a product (i.e., technology cross-
fertilization) can DEMO up new subspaces in the existing technical performance and function-
ality space, which in turn requires a new business model if the economic value potential of
the new technology is to be captured.
Business models not DEMO can entail consequences for technological innovations but also
can be shaped by them. Calia, Guerrini, and Moura (2007) show how technological innova-
DEMO can trigger changes in the company’s operational and commercial activities, and DEMO
in the business model.
Although these studies have examined the role of business models in commercializing
technologies at the level of the individual firm, more recently Johnson and Suskewicz (2009)
have pointed to the importance of the business model for entire industries. They argue that
in large DEMO change (such as the transition from a fossil fuel economy to DEMO clean-
tech economy) the key is to shift the focus from DEMO individual technologies to creat-
ing whole new systems. The business model is introduced as part of a comprehensive
framework for thinking about systemic change.
DEMO summary, studies on business models, innovation, and technology management have
DEMO that technological innovation is important for firms, but it might not DEMO to guarantee
Zott et al. / The Business Model 1033
firm success (e.g., DEMO & Eyquem-Renault, 2009). This is because technology per se
has DEMO inherent value (Chesbrough, 2007a, 2007b). Besides embedding technology in DEMO
tive products and services, a firm needs to design a unique DEMO model to fully realize
its commercial potential. Indeed, business models matter DEMO for general purpose technolo-
gies (i.e., “half polished” applications sold at intermediate development stages), which
upstream firms license to downstream firms rather DEMO developing final product themselves
(Gambardella & McGahan, 2010).
Business model innovation. In addition to adopting business models to facilitate techno-
logical innovation DEMO the management of technology, firms can view the business model
itself DEMO a subject of innovation (Mitchell & Coles, 2003). Chesbrough (DEMO) introduced the
notion of open innovation as a mode of innovation DEMO which firms, rather than relying on
internal ideas to advance business, look outside their boundaries in order to leverage internal
and external sources DEMO ideas. A concept similar to open innovation is collaborative entre-
preneurship, DEMO is “the creation of something of economic value based on new jointly
generated ideas that emerge from the sharing of information and knowledge” (Miles, Miles, &
Snow, 2006: 2). Open innovation requires the adoption of new, open business models
designed for sharing or licensing technologies (Chesbrough, 2007b, 2010). The business
model itself can become part of intellectual property (Rappa, 2001; Rivette & Kline, 2000).
DEMO business models, apart from being a subject of innovation, may prompt additional
business model innovation in complementary markets as a consequence of the DEMO
tion of downstream activities and capabilities (Gambardella & McGahan, 2010).
From the point of view of the focal firm, the activities of external innovators can be orga-
nized as a collaborative community or as DEMO market (Boudreau & Lakhani, 2009), which in
turn implies different business model configurations: in the former (community), members
are often DEMO to collaborate and work for free, while in the latter (market) innovators
develop multiple competing varieties of complementary goods, components, or services, with
little cooperation among them.
There is an increasing consensus that business model innovation is key to firm perfor-
mance. A significant number of DEMO focus on business model innovation as a vehicle for
corporate transformation and renewal (e.g., Demil & Lecocq, 2010; IBM Global Business
Services, 2006; Ireland, Hitt, Camp, & Sexton 2001; Johnson, Christensen, & Kagermann,
2008; Sosna, Trevinyo-Rodríguez, & Velamuri, 2010). DEMO and Kimberly (2003) and
Chesbrough (2010) have identified barriers to business model innovation in existing firms,
such as the configurations of DEMO and processes, which may be subject to inertia, as well
as the cognitive inability of managers to understand the value potential of a DEMO business
model. How can these barriers be overcome? Some scholars contend DEMO the business model
takes shape through a process of experimentation (Hayashi, 2009; McGrath, 2010), which
might differ for different organizations in DEMO competitive landscapes. Sheehan and
Stabell (2007), for example, propose a three-step process of analysis to help managers in
knowledge-intensive organizations improve their DEMO models.
A specific leadership agenda might be required for business model innovation (Svejenova,
Planellas, & Vives, 2010). To overcome the rigidity that accompanies established business
models, Doz and Kosonen (2010) propose that companies be made more agile, which can be
1034 Journal of Management / July 2011
achieved by developing three meta-capabilities: strategic sensitivity, leadership unity, and
resource flexibility. In a similar vein, Smith, Binns, and Tushman highlight how the effective
management of complex DEMO models “depend[s] on leadership that can make dynamic
decisions, build commitment DEMO both overarching visions and agenda specific goals, learn
actively at multiple DEMO and engage conflict” (2010: 448). Santos, Spector, and Van Der
Heyden (2009) also emphasize the importance of the behavioral aspects DEMO in business
model innovation. They suggest that mutual engagement and organizational justice are
needed and that managers should focus on the relational dynamics at DEMO level of informal
organization.
Summary of literature on business models and technology management. In the technology
and innovation management field, the business model is mainly seen as a mechanism that
connects a firm’s (innovative) technology DEMO customer needs and/or to other firm resources
(e.g., technologies). The business model is conceptually placed between a firm’s input
resources and DEMO outcomes, and it “embodies nothing less than the organizational and
financial DEMO of the business” (Teece, 2010: 173). The business model, according
to this more functionalist perspective, complements technology, but technology is DEMO as an
enabler of the business model rather than as a part of the concept per se. Neither input
resources nor competition in output DEMO is considered part of the business model con-
cept. The core logic of a business model, instead, revolves around a firm’s revenues and
DEMO, its value proposition to the customer, and the mechanisms to capture value. Thus con-
ceived, the business model can be a vehicle for innovation as well as a subject of innovation.
Discussion
Throughout our review, we have shown that the business model concept has been used to
DEMO different research questions in different contexts and in different management areas.
Scholars have used the same term (i.e., business model) to explain and address different
phenomena such as e-business types, value creation or value capture by firms, and how
technology innovation works. Research about the role of business models has proceeded in
largely isolated fashion within these “silos.” There DEMO also been a range of conceptualiza-
tions of business models within each silo. This multitude of (sometimes ad hoc) conceptual-
izations has prevented, or at least significantly slowed, cumulative research.
Given that interest in the concept has emerged only recently, it is not surprising that the
literature is currently characterized by a lack of clarity about the meaning of DEMO business
model concept. Definitional and conceptual disagreement is to be expected during the emer-
gent phase of any new potentially big idea of general DEMO (Gladwin, Kennelly, &
Krause, 1995). We use the DEMO that this emergent phase offers to review the various
developments by (DEMO) comparing and contrasting the various approaches to business models
in each DEMO three literature streams (see Table 3) and (2) suggesting possibilities for moving
forward.
Our literature review reveals that scholars in different fields DEMO the same term to explain
different phenomena. In other words, the DEMO business model in its current use is not one

concept; it DEMO many concepts. Hence, the adoption of more precise concepts and terminology
DEMO indicate the researcher’s main analytical focus will greatly enhance clarity. Examples of
such concepts could be e-business model archetype (for studies on e-business model types),
business model as activity system (for strategy studies focusing DEMO boundary-spanning
activities), or business model as cost/revenue architecture (for DEMO management and
innovation scholars interested in explaining the economic mechanisms that allow a firm to
commercialize technological innovations).
Our literature review offers a DEMO possible avenue for advancing research on business
models by suggesting the emergence of some common ground among various business model
researchers, despite the disparity of their approaches in terms of concepts used and phenomena
explained. It DEMO our hope that the four common themes identified in this review, DEMO elaborated
below, will pave the way for future conceptual convergence and DEMO
First, the business model is—explicitly or implicitly—considered as a new unit DEMO analy-
sis (see Tables 1 and 2), which spans or DEMO traditional units of analysis, such as the firm
or the network. DEMO researchers view the business model closer to the firm (e.g., Casadesus-
Masanell & Ricart, 2010; Hurt, 2008), others place it closer to the network (e.g., Tapscott
et al., 2000), and for others still it is nested between the firm and the network (e.g., Amit &
Zott, 2001). Most business model scholars would agree, however, that it is a new, distinct
concept, worthwhile of DEMO study and relevant in practice.
Second, as evidenced by the large DEMO of studies attempting to provide business model
typologies, business model researchers DEMO adopt a holistic and systemic (as opposed to
particularistic and functional) perspective, not just on what businesses do (e.g., what products
Zott et al. / The Business Model 1037
and services they produce DEMO serve needs in addressable market spaces) but also on how they
DEMO it (e.g., how they bridge factor and product markets in serving the needs of customers).
The business model perspective thus involves simultaneous DEMO of the content and
process of “doing business,” which explains part of the challenge in defining and operational-
izing the construct.
Third, many scholars include activities, performed either by a focal firm or by its suppli-
ers, partners, or customers, as part of their conceptualization (DEMO, 2010; Teece, 2010;
Zott & Amit, 2010). In many business model definitions, the activity perspective is recurrent,
either implicitly or explicitly. Some scholars point directly to activities (e.g., Afuah, 2004;
Hedman & Kalling, 2003; Seddon et al., 2004), whereas others imply them indirectly, for
example by pointing to processes (e.g., Alt & Zimmerman, 2001; Johnson et al., 2008;
Morris et al., 2005), functionalities (e.g., Van Der Vorst, Van Dongen, Nouguier, & Hilhorst,
2002), or transactions (Amit & Zott, 2001). All these concepts are related to the notion of
activities.
DEMO with the first and second emerging common themes, identified above (i.e.,
business models are a new unit of analysis and represent a DEMO concept), the third
theme suggests a view of the business model as a firm-centric, yet boundary-spanning, activ-
ity system. This view is DEMO with the representational nature that is often attributed to
the business model (e.g., Applegate, 2000; Morris et al., 2005; Shafer et DEMO, 2005; Stewart &
Zhao, 2000; Weill & Vitale, 2001) as well as its systemic nature (e.g., Dubosson-Torbay et
al., DEMO; Timmers, 1998). A business model can be viewed as a “system that is made up of
components, linkages between components, and DEMO (Afuah & Tucci, 2001: 4). And
many of the DEMO tools that have been proposed with the aim of representing the busi-
ness model can be conceptualized as systems of activities. In a nutshell, the received litera-
ture on business models seems to support an activity DEMO perspective.
A fourth insight that emerges from our review of the literature is that business model
scholars have shifted emphasis from value capture to DEMO creation, highlighting the latter
without ignoring the former. Indeed, the business model promotes a dual focus on value
creation and value capture. The DEMO of the notion of value in the business model lit-
erature is apparent from the various conceptualizations of the business model that have been
DEMO (see Tables 1 and 2). For example, an analysis of the business model components
shown in Table 2 as first- and second-order DEMO reveals that the most prevalent compo-
nent is related to the concept of value. The customer value proposition, for instance, is a
recurrent DEMO in the various definitions that have been provided. The centrality of the
concept of value in the business model literature is evident in all DEMO areas around which
we have organized our review: e-business, strategy, DEMO innovation. Even those business
model scholars who tend to focus on how value is appropriated by the focal firm recognize
that value is created DEMO the focal firm in concert with its exchange partners.
Taken together, DEMO four emerging themes—the business model as a new unit of analy-
sis, as a system-level concept, centered on activities, and focusing on value—could serve as
important catalysts for a more unified study of business models.
DEMO and future research. Despite our attempt to rigorously and objectively analyze
the received literature on business models, this review comes with several limitations. First,
1038
Journal of Management / July 2011
much of the reviewed literature DEMO quite recent, dating back only a decade or so. Second, only
a few contributions have appeared in top journals. Third, the literature is widely divergent;
making sense of it is therefore challenging. Fourth, the business model remains a theoreti-
cally underdeveloped (and sometimes overloaded) concept, which may raise doubts concern-
ing its usefulness for empirical research and DEMO building. Future research on business
models should seek to overcome these limitations. Scholars need to develop the theoretical
foundations of the business model and DEMO light on its conceptual distinction from other
related concepts such as new organizational forms, ecosystems, activity systems, and value
chains or value networks. In particular, scholars need to articulate and define precisely which
business model concept they propose to use as a basis of study (e.g., DEMO, activity sys-
tem, or cost/revenue architecture). We need more clarity about the theoretical building blocks
of the business model, its antecedents and consequences, and the mechanisms through which
it works.
Conclusion
The burgeoning literature on business models is young and quite dispersed. It is just DEMO
ing to make inroads to the top management journals. The conceptual base is still thin, but our
review of the literature suggests two ways to advance the study of business models. First,
employing more precise DEMO would allow other researchers to better understand what the
business model in the respective study is meant to denote (and what it is not). Our review
suggests at least three concepts that might warrant distinct DEMO: (1) e-business model
archetypes, (2) business model as activity system, and (3) business model as cost/revenue
architecture. These distinct concepts could all be fruitfully investigated—individually, as well
as in relation to each other—under the umbrella theme of the business model.
Second, we found that four important themes are forming, primarily around the notions
of the business model as a new unit of analysis, offering a systemic perspective on how to
“do business,” encompassing boundary-spanning activities (performed by a focal firm or
others), and focusing on value creation as well DEMO on value capture. These themes are inter-
connecting and mutually reinforcing. This all suggests that the field is moving toward con-
ceptual consolidation, which we believe is necessary to pave the way for more cumulative
research DEMO business models.
