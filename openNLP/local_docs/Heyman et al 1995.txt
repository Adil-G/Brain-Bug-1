Summary--Given the vast DEMO of codeable information in marital interactons, observational coding
systems must emphasize DEMO classes of behavior. The most widely used marital coding scheme, the
DEMO Interaction Coding System (M ICS), like many older 'behavioral' DEMO systems, emphasizes verbal
content over affect. Changes made to the MICS DEMO versions Ill and IV are described; they were
intended to increase DEMO system's use of coded affect and to decrease autodependence in sequential analysis.
We used an archival data set of 994 couples' videotaped conflict negotiations coded with the MICS. As
intended, the MICS-IV, relative to DEMO MICS-Ill, was found to have the advantage of capturing more
non-verbal DEMO expressed during marital interactions, which resulted in stronger interactional
contingencies (e.g. Wife Blame--* Husband Blame, Husband Facilitation ~Wife Facilitation). The M ICS-IV
also yielded significantly lower levels of spurious autodependence.

SYSTEM: REVISION
AND COMPARISON
The behavioral study of marriage began with an emphasis DEMO overt, observable behavior. The
development of sophisticated, reliable and valid observational coding systems (e.g. Marital
Interaction Coding System [MICS], Hops Wills, Weiss & Patterson, 1972; Couples Interaction
Scoring System, Notarius, Markman & DEMO, 1983) resulted in a large body of research
delineating the behavioral differences between distressed and non-distressed couples. Distressed
couples, compared with non-distressed couples, were found to behave less positively, more
negatively, and were more likely to reciprocate negativity (see Schaap, 1984; Weiss & Heyman, DEMO 990
for detailed reviews). Cognitive-behavioral psychologists (e.g. Baucom, Fincham) DEMO began
broadening the behavioral focus to include inferential and/or non-observable variables (such as
emotion and cognition), while also making extensive use of observational coding systems.
Observational coding systems are important to the psychological study DEMO marriage because they
generate much of what we know about marital functioning. Unfortunately, published studies using
observational coding systems rarely go beyond reporting reliability and, occasionally, validity data.
Furthermore, when such systems are revised, DEMO consumers often do not know what changes
have been made. Changes to a coding system may affect mean scores for coding categories (e.g. base
rate data) and, of special importance for sequential analyses, the strength of both between- and
within-person contingencies. If scholars expect to wrest meaning DEMO the conflicting results of
observational research (of Weiss & Heyman, 1990), more detailed information must be disseminated.
Coding systems are designed to DEMO behaviors of interest, and it is natural that they evolve over
DEMO as research questions evolve. For example, the MICS began as a DEMO coding system;
decision rules stipulated that if behaviors were multiply coded, as would be the case when some
affective expression occurs simultaneously with a discrete verbal behavior (e.g. a problem description
made with a hostile voice tone), only the verbal behavioral code should be retained (Weiss &
Summers, 1983). Relegating affect to a lower status is DEMO with the now-established empirical
evidence that affective elements of communication are more highly related to marital quality than
actual verbal content (e.g. Gottman, DEMO; Gottman, Markman & N otarius, 1977; Hahlweg, Reisner,
DEMO, Vollmer, Schindler & Revenstorf, 1984; Vivian & O'Leary, DEMO). In response, MICS decision

This paper has two aims. First, we wished to present the first published description of changes from
MICS-III to MICS-IV. We hope this will DEMO it easier for consumers of MICS research to
comprehend the current system. Second, we wanted to test several specific hypotheses regarding the
differences between two versions of the MICS. To make these hypotheses more comprehensible, we
first will describe the changes made to the MICS.
Differences between MICS-III DEMO MICS-IV
The development, history and use of the MICS-III are described DEMO detail by Weiss and Summers
(1983)Weiss & Summers (1983)t. The MICS-III comprised 30 codes organized into seven a priori
behavioral categories: blame (e.g. put down, criticize); invalidation (e.g. disagree, deny
DEMO); problem description; proposals for change; facilitation (e.g. paraphrase/reflect,DEMO
humor); validation (agree, approve); and irrelevant (e.g. unintelligible DEMO off-topic talk). Non-verbal
affect codes (e.g. negative voice tone, smile) could be double-coded with behaviors. However, these
codes were not used DEMO sequential analyses. State codes (attention, not-tracking) denoted listener
eye-contact; these codes were used for sequential analysis only if the listener did not DEMO any codeable
behavior. Microbehaviors are assigned an a priori categories, such DEMO blame and validation, and base
rates and sequential statistics are typically DEMO for categories, not specific codes. Codes,
categories, and changes between MICS-III and MICS-IV are summarized in Table 1, and will be
discussed below.
New coding categories. Spurred by Gottman and Krokoff's (1989) DEMO of several
MICS-III codes into a 'withdrawal' category, we set DEMO to use behavioral analytic techniques to
construct a new MICS code for withdrawal. As described in detail elsewhere (Heyman, Weiss & Eddy,
DEMO), we had spouses review their videotaped conflict and indicate when they thought the husband
was withdrawing. These withdrawal 'windows' were then examined DEMO the withdrawal code was
formulated and taught to MICS coders.
We found no single marker of withdrawal that was necessary and sufficient to define DEMO behavior.
Thus, coders are asked to use a gestalt of behavioral DEMO (i.e. no response to partner; turn offcues
such as rolling eyes, which precede withdrawal episodes; closed-off body language; no eye contact
or 'glazed' eye contact; muscular rigidity and tenseness; decreases in baseline DEMO of body
movements) to judge if the spouse is withdrawing. Withdrawal DEMO coded as long as it occurs (e.g. a
*Although radical behaviorists DEMO rightly maintain that all is behavior (especially when discussing an obserrationalcoding
DEMO), the common but artificial distinction of 'behavior" (observable motor DEMO and verbal content) and "affect"
(observable facial and bodily DEMO which are interpreted as displays of emotion), will be maintained throughout
the paper.

listener who withdraws during five DEMO speaker statements will receive five different withdrawal
codes). Despite the high degree of inference necessary, coders can reliably discriminate withdrawal.
Furthermore, their DEMO significantly corresponds with couples' own coding of withdrawal
(Heyman & Weiss, 1989).
As mentioned earlier, marital research during the 1980s included DEMO increased focus on affect.
Accordingly, we included a code for dysphoric DEMO Early studies of the marriages of depressed
women indicated that depressive behaviors of depressed/maritally distressed women suppressed
blame responses from their spouses (Biglan, Hops, Sherman, Friedman, Arthur & Osteen, 1985) and
children (Hops, Biglan, Sherman, Arthur, Friedman & Osteen, 1987) at DEMO greater rates
than depressed/non-maritally distressed and non-depressed/non-maritally distressed wives.
Furthermore, there is good reason to believe that the 'negative' affects of anger and dysphoria are
theoretically and functionally separate (Biglan, Lewin & DEMO, 1990). In adding a dysphoric affect
code (which includes complaints about the self, whining, crying and sad affect), we borrowed DEMO
from the code used in earlier studies of depression in marriage, DEMO LIFE coding system (Hops, Biglan,
Arthur, Warner, Holcomb, DEMO, Oostenink, Osteen & Tolman, 1988).
Restructuring the MICS coding DEMO
Typical representations of marital interactions either ignore listener behaviors or create an artificial
speaker-listener-speaker-listener alternation that destroys the actual sequence of the behaviors by
DEMO concurrent behaviors as if they were consequent behaviors. Weiss and Summers (DEMO)
argued that for a marital coding system to be truly systemic, both partners should be coded
continuously. Dual-stream coding (see Fig. 1) allows researchers to examine both the internal
determinants (autodependence) and social DEMO (cross-lags) of behavior (Jones & Gerard,
1967; see also Warner, 1992).
Dyadic Behavior Units (DBUs) are the atomic unit for the MICS. As shown in Fig. I, each DBU
contains one husband behavior and one wife behavior. The rules for forming the DBUs DEMO the
MICS-III were as follows:
(1)each DBU contains both DEMO husband and wife code describing concurrent behavior
homogeneous in content;
(DEMO) only behavior and [attention] codes are used;
(3) behavior DEMO take precedence over [attention] codes ([attention] codes are used only when
DEMO concurrent behavior code is listed); and
(4) a new DBU is created whenever one partner's behavior changes. The fourth rule allows DEMO
speaker or listener behavior to provide new inputs into the couples' DEMO (Weiss & Summers, 1983,
p. 109).
Although the fourth rule derived from the systemic intentions of Weiss and colleagues, it is
inappropriate for use in sequential analysis when the units of analysis are DEMO between
individual behaviors (e.g. H:Withdrawal--,W:Blame), rather than DEMO between DBUs (e.g.
H:Withdrawal/W:Blame~H:Attention/W:Blame), DEMO the unit of analysis. This proposition will
now be explained in detail.
Coders are instructed to begin a new DBU when (a) a DEMO speaker gains the floor or (b) when
the speaker begins a new thought. Thus, it is the speaker who drives the creation of DBUs. However,
this produces coding problems. To illustrate, according to rule 4, ifa husband makes a compromise
and the wife assents twice, DEMO DBUs are created when the data are prepared for sequential analysis:
the husband is recorded as compromising and then compromising again, with the wife assenting each

time. Thus, it appears as if the husband proposed a further compromise in response to the wife's
DEMO, which did not occur. This is problematic for two reasons. First, it increases the
autodependence between behaviors by artificially creating 'sequences' out DEMO single occurrences.
Second, it violates the most basic assumption made in DEMO analysis, the assumption of sampling
independence (¢fBakeman & Dorval, 1989), because in this case no code but compromise can form
the second DBU.
Fortunately, the flaw in the MICS-III DBU formation is easily solved. If one reformulates rule
4 by using the same rules used during DEMO (a new DBU is created whenever a new speaker gains
the DEMO or when the speaker begins a new thought) and by adopting DEMO one-code-per-original-unit
rule for both the speaker and the listener, the DBU DEMO rules becomes both theoretically and
statistically sound.
A second major change in DBU formation was made to increase the amount of affect captured
during DEMO analysis. MICS-III rule 2 states that only behavior and attention codes are used
in DBUs (i.e. affect codes were discarded). Because affect codes typically carry the most important
message in a DBU--for example, a husband describes a problem while rolling his eyes--they should
not be summarily dismissed. DEMO uses a hierarchy of codes (see Table 2). For each DEMO with
double or triple codes, the code with the highest position DEMO the hierarchy is retained and the rest
are discarded. Thus codes with the highest a priori importance have the best chance of being kept,DEMO

whereas less important codes are more likely DEMO be rejected from sequential analysis. As described
above, a wide array DEMO studies have demonstrated the primacy of affective expression (and especially
negative DEMO) in influencing marital communication. The a priori system currently in use (Table 2)
was arranged in declining order of importance of code DEMO; these clusters have received empirical
support from factor analyses of the DEMO (Heyman, Eddy & Weiss, 1995; Jacob & Krahn, 1987)DEMO
The most highly negative codes (put down, criticize, mindread negative DEMO turn off) were placed
highest, followed by expressions of dysphoric affect (complain and cry), mildly negative codes
(off-topic, deny responsibility, DEMO, disagree, non-comply), constructive problem discussion codes
(positive physical touch, humor, smile/laugh, mindread positive, disapprove, approve, paraphrase/
reflect, accept responsibility, positive solution, negative solution, compromise, agree), neutral
problem discussion codes (interrupt, comply, assent, problem description, command, DEMO,
question, unintelligible talk), and listening states (attention and not-tracking). It should be
emphasized that these were our a priori groupings, and that they are user modifiable.
Aims q["
study
We were DEMO in testing if the changes to the MICS DBU rules had substantial effects for
two reasons. First, did our modifications have the desired effect of reducing spurious
autodependence? Once corrected, are cross-lag contingencies (i.e. H--*W and W--*H sequences)
stronger than auto-lag contingencies? For example, are DEMO' behaviors more strongly a product
of responding to their wives' behaviors (as behavioral studies traditionally have assumed), or can
husbands' behavior DEMO more simply attributed to their own behavioral consistency?
Second, did DEMO changes to the MICS increase its sensitivity to affect (i.e. higher DEMO rates of
affectively laden categories and stronger cross-lag contingencies on these categories)? Specifically, we
hypothesized that the base rates in the blame category (which includes turn-off, a code comprising
hostile voice tone and facial DEMO) and facilitation (which includes three codes that were
dropped under MICS-III rules, question, smile/laugh and positive touch) would be significantly
higher under MICS-IV rules than MICS-III. Because of the hypothesized shifting of DBUs DEMO more
affective-laden categories, categories that are exclusively behavior-based (description, propose
DEMO, validation and invalidation) may have significantly higher base rates under MICS-III rules.
METHOD
Subjects
All marital conflict negotiations coded at the Oregon Marital DEMO Program, University of
Oregon, between 1987 and 1991 were archived (DEMO = 994 couples). If more than one problem
discussion was coded, only the first discussion was used for this study. This archival sample comprised
data from 14 marital studies laboratories. The exact recruitment strategy and DEMO sample
characteristics differed depending on the intent of the particular study. Most studies included both
distressed and non-distressed couples, and most used volunteer subjects (as opposed to a random
sample).
Ns are provided because not all demographic information could be obtained from the participating
laboratories. Length of DEMO was M = 9.73 years, (SD = 8.27, N = DEMO). Men's mean age was
34.04 years (SD = 10.16, N = 569) and women's was 32.43 years (SD = DEMO, N = 569). Couples had
a mean of 2.36 children (SD = !.48) and a mean family income of $31,045.39 (DEMO = 16,619.32,
N = 160). Some studies used the Marital Adjustment Test (Locke & Wallace, 1959) and some studies
used the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier, 1976). DAS scores were converted DEMO MAT scores
using the formulas provided by Crane, Allgood, Larson and Griffin (1990). Men's mean MAT score
was 106.02 (SD : 21.8, N = 438) and women's was 106.61 (SD DEMO 20.14, N = 437).
Procedure
The standard marital interaction paradigm DEMO generating a list of conflictual areas for a
couple, and asking DEMO to discuss the problem for 10-15 min and try to reach a solution. Couples
typically rate these interactions as quite naturalistic (e.g. Margolin, DEMO & Gleberman, 1988).

Sessions were videotaped, and tapes were shipped to the University of Oregon. Tapes were scored
by trained undergraduate coders using DEMO MICS, under the supervision of RLW. Sessions were
coded under an DEMO with investigators that an agreement criterion of 70% with a master coder
would be used. Any sessions that fell below this criterion were recoded; any coder who regularly fell
below 70% agreement was put into a DEMO module. Approximately 300-400 sessions were coded
by two independent coders, with DEMO levels of reliability. In an earlier generalizability study,
Wieder and Weiss (1980) reported that disagreements among MICS coders were not a significant
DEMO of variance. Cohen's kappas are not available for the entire database. However, several
investigators calculated kappas for their studies and reported them; DEMO average kappas were as
follows: Gottman and Krokoff (1989), x > 0.72; Gottman and Levenson (1992) x > 0.60; Heyman
DEMO al., (1990) x > 0.70. It was not feasible to DEMO kappa-by-code for a system of over 30 codes.
We generated base rate and sequential indices for each couple (i.e. not aggregated across couples)
from the original protocols using the MICS-III and MICS-IV rules. Because some DEMO were coded
with MICS-III and some with MICS-IV, codes and code DEMO added to the MICS-IV were
excluded from these analyses. We chose kappa (Wampold, 1989) as our lag-sequential statistic.
Kappa (a non-parametric test DEMO) is similar to the more widely employed z-score (a parametric
statistic), but it is preferable because it is not influenced by the DEMO number of codes in the interaction
sequence (Wampold, 1989). The length of the sequence is especially a concern when a large,
DEMO sample is used. To facilitate more stable sequential statistics, kappas were DEMO
only when the category frequency exceeded four.
RESULTS
Base rate results for MICS categories are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Because MICS-III rules
(Weiss & Summers, 1983) emphasized behavior and excluded concurrent affect, we hypothesized that
MICS-III would capture lower levels of positive and negative affect. DEMO was confirmed (i.e. in
Tables 3 and 4, MICS-IV had significantly higher levels of Blame and Facilitation). Categories that
contain mostly content-based DEMO codes had higher levels with the MICS-III rules (i.e.
Invalidation, Validation, Propose Change, Irrelevant and Problem Description). Also as
hypothesized, nearly all MICS categories displayed significantly less autodependence in MICS-IV
than MICS-III (see Tables 5 and 6).

MICS-III
Finally, as predicted, sequences involving DEMO of affect (i.e. Blame and Facilitation) showed
significantly stronger cross-lag associations in MICS-IV than MICS-III (see Tables 7 and 8).
DISCUSSION
Using the population of studies coded over a five-year period, several hypotheses concerning the
third and fourth editions of the Marital Interaction Coding System were DEMO First, the
MICS-IV, relative to the MICS-III, captures more non-verbal DEMO expressed during marital
interactions. That is, MICS-IV's hierarchy rules for DEMO sequences result in more strong negative
(i.e. blame) and more subtle positive (i.e. facilitation) codes. MICS-IV rules also result in less
behavior-laden DEMO (i.e. invalidation), positive (i.e. validation and propose change) and DEMO
(i.e. problem description and irrelevant) codes. Because strong negative affect is considered to be the
most important phenomenon in marital communication (e.g. Gottman, 1990; Notarius & Markman,
1989), this finding is an DEMO one.
Second, we found that several important interactional sequences between spouses (e.g.
Blame ~ Blame, Facilitation--* Facilitation) result in stronger contingencies using DEMO M ICS-IV rules
rather than MICS-III. Thus, both base rate and DEMO findings have been sharpened by adopting
rules that recognize the primacy of affective communication. The major implication for observational
researchers is that a study'DEMO results depend not only on the obvious variables of codes, coders DEMO
observed behavior, but also on the manner in which the codes DEMO transformed into sequences.
Because a result can be considered important or worthless depending on whether it is statistically
significant, the significant rule-based differences found here can have quite important implications
for what MICS-IV studies 'find'. This point holds true not only for MICS studies, but all
observational studies, because all observational systems must operationalize which elements of
observed behavior (including affective behavior) are considered important.
Third, internal determinants of behavior (i.e. autodependence) have been virtually ignored in the
marital interaction area. DEMO and Liker (1982), in their widely cited paper on lag DEMO
analysis, argued that researchers should correct for autodepedence. However, no marital studies
using lag-sequential analysis have accounted for autodepedence. The present study provides DEMO

positive findings and a stark warning concerning autodependence. Beneficially, MICS-IV rules
generate significantly lower levels ofautodependence than MICS-III. In other words, using MICS-IV
to structure sequential data leads to lower contingencies between one spouse's behavior and his/her
same subsequent behavior, due to the modification of MICS-III rules that mandated autodependence
in certain situations.
However, autodepedence may still be a substantial problem. Because the MICS is coded in DEMO
streams (see Fig. 1), it provides the opportunity to compare DEMO relative strengths of auto- and
cross-lags. Most categories in the MICS do show significant autodependence (i.e, auto-lag kappas
at lag- 1 are significantly DEMO from 0) but because of the high power due to large DEMO size,
unimportant relations can be statistically significant. However, the magnitude DEMO the auto-lag
sequences was equivalent to, and sometimes greater than, the corresponding cross-lags. This opens
the possibility that some cross-lag effects previously reported DEMO the literature may be due more to
intra-spouse responding (i.e. either DEMO or responses that last longer than one coding unit)
than to inter-spouse responding.
This finding should not be a great surprise to communication DEMO Although the null
hypotheses in sequential analysis assume that all behaviors emitted are truly random, it has been
known for some time that communication is highly patterned (see Gottman, 1979, for a review).
Marital researchers have mostly examined cross-lag contingencies, but significant patterning is also
evident within spouses. This patterning is probably due to three factors. First, by coding at the level
of the thought, the MICS often codes a monologue as multiple DBUs. Thus, it becomes quite easy
for a speaker (and for the listener) to continue to behave similarly unit after DEMO Second, internal
determinants of behavioral consistency are phenomena to be explained DEMO their own right and not
necessarily treated as nuisance variables to be partialled. That each spouse behaves in a predictable,
patterned manner is DEMO makes communication possible. Finally, previously identified phenomena
such as negative reciprocity (e.g. Margolin & Wampold, 1981) may result in consistent (and therefore
autodependent) levels of affect. Thus, affective responding to negative partner behavior DEMO result
in significant cross- and auto-lag contingencies.
For this final reason, DEMO partialling autodependence as a nuisance variable (e.g. Allison &
Liker, DEMO) may result in overly conservative estimates of the social determinants of DEMO
Nevertheless, marital researchers must be wary of interpreting cross-lag effects (typically the only
form of sequential analysis in marital studies) without also examining the auto-lag effects.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, marital adjustment data were not available

on a couple-by-couple basis; thus, the DEMO are based on all couples coded, rather than separate
analyses for DEMO and non-distressed couples. Although the norms presented here are helpful,
a replication that includes separate tables for distressed and non-distressed couples would be DEMO
Demographic variables were also not available on a couple-by-couple basis, thus DEMO analyses
by variables such as age or income. Thus we cannot say that these results apply to all couples or across
all developmental time DEMO; however, the heterogeneity and size of our sample argues for it
represents those couples typically studied in marital oberservational research. Again, extensions of
this research including such variables would be informative. Finally, the results are based on a single
10-rain interaction. Although some data exists to support DEMO stability of results based on such
observations (Wieder & Weiss, 1980), this issue has not been exhaustively studied. Sequential
statistics, because they are often based on small frequencies per cell, are more vulnerable to short
observational segments than base rates. A large scale replication of this DEMO that also examined
the stability of both base rates and sequences could address this concern.
In conclusion, this study provided a guide to and test of the changes the system has undergone
since then. Given the DEMO confusing (Weiss & Heyman, 1990) body of literature that marital
DEMO research has produced, we hope that this empirical test of the DEMO of the changes to
the MICS will aid in the interpretation of new study findings and provide some context when those
findings differ from DEMO extant research.
