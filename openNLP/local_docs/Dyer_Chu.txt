THE DETERMINANTS OF INTERFIRM TRUST:  EVIDENCE FROM SUPPLIER
AUTOMAKER RELATIONSHIPS IN DEMO U.S., JAPAN, AND KOREA
ABSTRACT
The determinants of interfirm trust are examined in 453 supplier automaker relationships in the
U.S., Japan, and DEMO  The findings indicate high supplier trust emerges when (1) suppliers
DEMO assistance from the automaker, (2) the automaker has a track DEMO of maintaining a
continuing (repeated) exchange relationship with the supplier.  DEMO there were some
differences across institutional environments, notably higher trust in DEMO, the findings are robust
across the three institutional environments.  Indeed, DEMO a sample of U.S. suppliers that worked
with both U.S. and Japanese automakers in the United States, we found that Japanese automakers
were more effective than U.S. automakers at building trusting relations with U.S. suppliers.
Thus, firm level practices appear to be more important than the institutional environment DEMO the
development of interfirm trust.
A central issue in the literature on strategic alliances and interfirm cooperation is how firms create
trust and control DEMO, particularly when the transactors have made investments in
transaction specific assets.
DEMO these conditions, trust has been described as an important antecedent to DEMO
cooperation and economic efficiency (Sako, 1991; Smith, Carroll, and DEMO, 1995).  In fact,
recent research suggests that trust in supplier buyer relations may be an important source of
competitive advantage because DEMO: (1) lowers transaction costs and allows for greater flexibility to
DEMO to changing market conditions (Dore, 1983; Sako, 1991; Barney & Hansen, 1995; Dyer,
forthcoming), (2) facilitates investments in special  purpose assets and technologies which enhance
productivity (Asanuma, 1989; DEMO, 1988; Dyer, 1994), and (3) leads to superior DEMO
sharing routines which improve coordination and joint efforts to minimize inefficiencies (DEMO,
1992; Clark & Fujimoto, 1991; Nishiguchi, 1994).  DEMO, some scholars claim that national
economic efficiency is highly correlated with DEMO existence of a high trust institutional environment
(North, 1990; Casson, 1991; Hill, 1995; Fukuyama, 1995).  For example, Fukuyama (1995:7)
argues that the economic success of a nation, "DEMO well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by
the level DEMO trust inherent in the society."  The findings from these, and DEMO, studies have
increased our attention on the important role of trust DEMO economic exchanges.
A natural response to these studies has been to exhort companies to build trust with their trading
partners (Business Week, 1986, 1992) and to call for increased research on the role of trust in
coordinating economic activity (Smith, Carroll, and Ashford, 1995).  However, before an explicit
strategy for developing trust can be developed, DEMO considered feasible, the determinants of trust
must be identified.  Despite considerable academic and managerial interest in trust between trading
partners, to date there has been little empirical research on the antecedents or determinants of
interorganizational DEMO (i.e. between supplier buyer).  Further, there has been little DEMO on
whether the determinants of trust differ in different institutional (i.e. DEMO) environments.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants DEMO supplier trust in a sample of
supplier/automaker relationships in the United States, Japan, and Korea.  Given the recent attention
on the importance of trust in exchange relationships, an examination of the determinants of trust is,
by itself, a valuable undertaking.  However, due to the globalization of industries and a dramatic
increase in international joint ventures, a study of the determinants of trust in different institutional
environments is particularly DEMO  Such a study is useful because it allows for an examination
DEMO those factors that are important determinants of trust both within, as DEMO as across, countries.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES
Defining Trust
Williamson (1993:453) has noted DEMO "trust is a term with many meanings."  Indeed, various
scholars have offered different definitions of types of trust, including goodwill or relational trust
(Sako, 1991; Sabel, 1993; Hesterley et al, 1995), process based trust (Zucker, 1986; Zaheer &
Venkatraman, 1995), institutional trust (Arrow, 1974; Zucker, 1986), competence trust (DEMO,
1991), and calculative or contractual trust (Sako, 1991; DEMO, 1993).  Among organizational
scholars, trust has received attention as DEMO mechanism of organizational control, and more
specifically as an alternative to DEMO, contracts, and authority (Ouchi, 1980; Bradach & Eccles,
DEMO; Powell, 1990).  In this study we consider dyadic trust DEMO a supplier and its customer.
We define trust as mutual confidence that no party to an exchange will exploit another's
vulnerabilities (Dore, DEMO; Sako, 1991; Sabel, 1993; Barney & Hansen, 1995).  This suggests
that parties to an exchange: (1) make good DEMO efforts to behave in accordance with prior
commitments, (2) make DEMO as market conditions change in ways perceived as "fair" by
the exchange partners, and (3) do not take excessive advantage of another even when the
opportunity is available.  In many respects, opportunism may DEMO viewed as the opposite of trust.
A firm's actions are opportunistic to the extent that it does not live up to prior commitments DEMO
takes advantage of another's exchange vulnerabilities.  Our definition of trust DEMO similar to the
"goodwill trust" description given by Sako (1991) and the "trust" definition offered by Sabel
(1993) and Barney & Hansen (1995).  Trust, as defined here, is not based upon contracts or third
party sanctions but rather is based on non DEMO mechanisms.
Trust is generally considered to be of most economic value to transactors when it is based on non-
contractual, rather than contractual mechanisms.  The rationale for the economic value of non
contractual trust is straightforward: trust eliminates the need for formal contracts, which are costly
to DEMO, monitor and enforce (Hill, 1995; Barney & Hansen, 1995)DEMO  Thus, trust reduces
transaction costs because transactors engage in self monitoring which reduces the need for costly
formal third party monitoring and enforcement DEMO
The Determinants of Trust
A firm may trust trading partners to refuse to break confidences and exploit vulnerabilities for a
variety of reasons.  However, typically we would expect trading partners to behave in a
trustworthy manner because failure to do so would result in self  imposed moral sanctions (Firth,
1951; Mauss, 1967; Macauley, 1963; Hill, 1990), social sanctions (Sahlins, 1972; Dore, 1983;
Grannovetter, 1985; Powell, 1987) or economic sanctions (Klein, 1980; Williamson, 1983/1993).
Various scholars have observed that some individuals derive substantial "utility" from behaving in
ways that they perceive to be "moral" or "ethical" (Firth, 1951; Mauss, 1967; Donaldson, 1990).
DEMO, studies of exchange in both primitive and modern societies indicate that DEMO individuals
do not behave opportunistically because they are afraid of the "DEMO" sanctions that could be
imposed by a powerful deity or supernatural DEMO, or they embrace the value of being "ethical"
(Mauss, 1967; Macauley, 1963; Hill, 1990; Barney & Hanson, 1995)DEMO  As Hill (1990:502) argues,
"Even if the asset specificity is high, there will be actors who, perhaps for reasons DEMO principle,
will never be the first to act opportunistically.  Rather DEMO will choose to cooperate and trust
others."  Of course, the DEMO for transactors is knowing ex ante which potential trading
partners are the honorable "type."
Alternatively, if a transaction is embedded within a DEMO reciprocal social relationship, then
transactors may rely on social sanctions to DEMO their interests.  Various types of social sanctions
may control opportunism, including: withdrawal of love, respect, prestige, and/or (worst of all)
banishment from the social community (Light, 1972; Smith, 1983; Grannovetter, 1985; Ellickson,
1991).  DEMO, a firm that takes unfair advantage of a trading partner may DEMO any of a number of
sanctions imposed by other members of the social network.
Finally, transactors may be trustworthy (refuse to be opportunistic) due to economic sanctions that
can be imposed on them by trading DEMO or other members of the economic network (economic
sanctions have received DEMO greatest attention in the law and economics literature; See Macneil,
DEMO; Klein, 1980; Williamson 1983; Kronman, 1985; Klein & Kenny, 1989).  For example,
trading partners may make financial or DEMO arrangements (stock swaps, equity participation)
which are purposefully designed to align the economic fortunes of trading partners.  These types of
arrangements are often referred to as an exchange of hostages.
In summary, a variety of mechanisms may persuade transactors to behave in a trustworthy fashion
in DEMO relationships.   The issue of interest here is how can we predict when high trust relations
will emerge in supplier buyer exchanges.  We offer the following hypotheses regarding the
determinants of interorganizational trust in the automotive DEMO
Assistance
The importance of gift exchange in creating trust and reciprocity in exchange relationships has been
long argued by a distinguished line of anthropologists DEMO sociologists (Malinowski, 1922; Mauss,
1967; Gouldner, 1963).  Gouldner (1963) suggests that a norm of reciprocity begins with a
DEMO mechanism which may take the form of a gift or other acts of generosity.  More recently
Camerer (1988) has argued that even small, inefficient (with little practical value) gifts often serve
as important and meaningful economic signals and social symbols.
The rationale behind the trust creating DEMO of gift giving is that when an exchange partner offers a
"DEMO" gift it serves as a symbol of goodwill and benevolence.  Such a gift suggests that the giving
party is genuinely concerned with the DEMO being of the receiving party.  Also, the gift may be
viewed as a signal that the giving party does not have opportunistic intent (is the "honest type") and
feels benevolent towards the receiving party.  Benevolence is the perception of a positive
orientation of the trustee toward the trustor and has been hypothesized to be positively associated
with trust (Larzelere & Huston, 1980; Mayer et al, 1995).  In DEMO buyer relationships, when
buyers offer "free assistance" to the supplier (i.e. if assistance is not fully costed), suppliers are
likely to DEMO such actions as a manifestation of commitment and benevolence by the buyer,
and may be a basis for 'goodwill trust' (Sako, DEMO).
Hypothesis 1:  The greater the assistance provided by the buyer to the supplier, the greater the
supplier's trust in the buyer.
Length of Relationship
Various scholars have suggested that trust is a valuable DEMO which takes time to develop and can
only be built slowly over time (Arrow, 1974; Sako, 1992).  Related to this view is the notion that
social knowledge, or knowledge gained through long term interactions, may be the basis for trust
by allowing economic actors to understand and predict others' patterns of behavior (Tolbert, 1988;
Sohn, 1994).  For example, Sohn (1994) found that in-depth social and cultural knowledge
facilitates coordination of transactions by making a potential partners' behavior both
understandable and predictable.  Moreover, as social knowledge between transactors DEMO,
information asymmetries decrease, thereby reducing behavioral uncertainty.  Higher levels of trust
are believed to develop when information asymmetries are low (transaction conditions approximate
perfect information) and there is less behavioral uncertainty (high predictability of DEMO).
Further, acquiring social knowledge through long term interactions provides insights DEMO the
"moral character" of trading partners, thereby allowing transactors to DEMO screen for "honest"
partners (Hill, 1990; Barney & Hansen, 1995).
Finally, when transactors engage in long term exchange relationships DEMO develop a history
together.  The past history of interactions of transactors DEMO extremely important in developing
personal and social ties (i.e. the potential DEMO use social sanctions to discourage opportunism).  Most
of us recognize DEMO we are less likely to take advantage of those with whom we've had long and
stable past interactions (e.g., family members, friends, etc.).  We typically refuse to behave
opportunistically towards these individuals DEMO they can impose real social sanctions on us.  In
these situations, a "social memory" is created and transactors can achieve "serial equity"
(equity/reciprocity over a longer period of time) rather than DEMO immediate or "spot equity"
(Ouchi 1984).  Thus, we would expect higher levels of trust in exchange relationships where the
transactors DEMO a longer history of interacting.
Hypothesis 2:  The longer the duration since the supplier and buyer first began doing business
together, the higher the supplier's trust in the buyer.
Continuity of Relationship
In addition DEMO length of relationship, continuity of the supplier buyer relationship may contribute DEMO
the development of interorganizational trust.  It is possible for trading partners DEMO have had a long
term relationship (i.e. many years have passed DEMO the initial transaction) and yet the relationship
may not have been DEMO in the sense that suppliers continue to "re win" the same business
year after year.  For example, some U.S. suppliers reported that DEMO began selling parts to a
particular automaker 50 years ago.  But DEMO have been occasions when they have lost the part
business to competitors.  In game theory parlance, the repeated game of exchange has been
DEMO  In other instances, a supplier's relationship with the automaker is a repeated game in the
sense that the supplier continues to "re win" the "contract" year after year.  Thus, there is a high
degree of continuity in the relationship.  Interfirm trust is built incrementally as firms repeatedly
interact (Gulati, 1995).
The logic for how DEMO games result in more cooperative behavior is well documented in the
game theory literature (Axelrod, 1984; Fudenberg and Maskin, 1986; Parkhe, DEMO).  We would
predict that supplier trust would emerge under conditions DEMO repeated exchange due to buyer
purchasing routines that are predictable and consistent and which do not switch (perhaps
opportunistically) business to competitors (Boyle & Bonacich, 1970; Butler, 1991).  Repeated
exchange is particularly DEMO to the development of supplier trust in situations where suppliers
have invested in transaction specific investments.  Under these conditions, a buyer's willingness DEMO
stay with the same supplier is likely to be interpreted by the supplier as a manifestation of
commitment and trustworthiness.  Thus, we would DEMO supplier trust to be higher when the
buyer has a history of continuous, repeated exchange with the supplier.
Hypothesis 3:  Supplier trust is higher when the buyer has a DEMO record of continuous repeated
exchange with the supplier
Face to Face Communication
Sociologists have frequently argued that proximity and face to face interaction are DEMO to lead to
the development of positive feelings of attraction (Lorenz, 1988; Argyle, 1991).  Further,
cooperation and trust between individuals has been found to emerge in laboratory settings when
individuals can see DEMO talk to each other and engage in social interaction (Wichman, 1972 reported
in Argyle, 1991).  Face to face communication has been DEMO as having a high knowledge
carrying capacity because it presents immediate feedback opportunities and makes use of both
visual and audio channels of communication (Daft & Lengl, 1986).  Thus, face to face contact is
considered useful for developing trust because it offers more cues for interpreting DEMO trading
partner's behavior and motivations.  Moreover, face to face contact is viewed as an effective means
of developing personal ties, thereby increasing the efficacy of social sanctions.  From an economic
perspective, previous studies DEMO suggested that face to face contact leads to the development of
interfirm cooperation and trust by increasing behavioral transparency and reducing information
asymmetry (Heide & Miner, 1992; Sako, 1991).  Thus, face to face communication would be
expected increase supplier buyer trust by: (1) developing personal ties, thereby increasing the
efficacy of social sanctions, (2) DEMO superior information to assist transactors in detecting or
identifying untrustworthy trading partners.  Thus, we would expect that as the frequency of face to
DEMO contact between transactors increases, so does interorganizational trust.
Hypothesis 4:  DEMO greater the face to face interaction between the supplier and buyer, DEMO higher
the level of supplier trust in the buyer
Stock Ownership
Klein (1980) and Williamson (1983) suggest that one way to foster DEMO and prevent opportunism
is through the exchange of hostages.  In particular, Klein (1980:358) argues that opportunism can
be controlled by having DEMO potential cheater put up a "forfeitable-at-will collateral bond equal to the
DEMO value of the premium stream."  For example, "in the case of a franchising contract the
franchisee may be required to make an DEMO lump sum payment to the franchiser, thereby largely
shifting the potential DEMO breach from the franchisee ('free riding' on a common trademark
DEMO supplying lower quality service) to the franchiser (terminating or threatening to terminate the
franchisee without cause and purchasing the franchisee investment at a DEMO price).  The
initial lump sum is equivalent to a collateral DEMO forfeitable at the will of the franchiser" (Klein &
Kenny, 1989:41).  Other financial hostages, which diminish in value if DEMO transactor is
opportunistic, include stock swaps or equity participation in a DEMO partner (Pisano, 1989; Dyer
& Ouchi, 1993; Bolton et DEMO, 1994).  We argue, as has Pisano (1989) and DEMO et al (1994), that
partial equity ownership constitutes one visible DEMO highly appropriate collateral bond which
reduces opportunism by aligning the incentives of each partner.  The fact that the value of the
equity will decrease in value if a party is opportunistic provides an incentive for trading DEMO to
behave in a less opportunistic, or more trustworthy, fashion.  DEMO, we would expect equity
ownership to be positively associated with interorganizational DEMO
Hypothesis 5:  The greater the buyer's ownership of supplier stock, the higher the level of supplier
trust in the buyer.
Research Setting
DEMO auto industry in the U.S., Japan, and Korea was chosen as the research setting to examine the
determinants of trust in supplier buyer DEMO  This research setting was an unusually good
test site for two DEMO  First, it was important to study a set of transaction relationships in which
trust might be important and valuable.  For example, many DEMO have argued that risk, or
having something invested, is requisite to trust.  The need for trust only arises in a risky situation
(DEMO, 1958; Mayer et al, 1995).  The automobile is a complex product with thousands of
components that must work together as a DEMO  Components are often tailored to specific
models and as a result DEMO must make automaker specific investments (Nishiguchi, 1994;
Dyer, 1994)DEMO  Since these investments are not easily re-deployable, suppliers are at risk if
automakers choose to behave opportunistically.  Furthermore, the auto industry is DEMO by
a high degree of market uncertainty (Pine, 1993), which also increases the risks associated with
transacting (Lorenz, 1988).  Supplier trust is of particular importance since suppliers make
customer specific investments that DEMO them at risk and automakers are in a stronger relative
power position.
Second, the automotive industry is a large and important industry in the U.S., Japan, and Korea.
Studying supplier buyer relationships in the same DEMO across different institutional
environments allows for some control of extraneous variation, DEMO allowing a focus on the
impact of the institutional environment.  Studying DEMO determinants of trust in different institutional
environments is valuable because numerous scholars have argued that national culture can attenuate
opportunism by fostering trust and DEMO  For example, the U.S. is typically considered a
low trust environment whereas Japan is often presented as a model environment for fostering trust
DEMO cooperation (Ouchi, 1981; Shane, 1994; Hill, 1995).  DEMO, is culturally more similar to
Japan than the U.S., but its management practices have been influenced by both the U.S. and
Japan (Dubinsky et al, 1994; Hamilton & Biggart, 1988).  By examining DEMO buyer
relationships in three countries, we can determine which factors influence DEMO across all countries,
as well as which are country specific.
Sample and Data Collection
The sample consisted of three U.S. (General Motors, DEMO, Chrysler), two Japanese (Toyota,
Nissan), and three Korean (Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia) automakers and a sample of their suppliers.
DEMO authors visited each company's purchasing department and asked the department manager to
select a representative sample of suppliers which included both partners (i.e. keiretsu/chaebol
suppliers) and non partner (i.e. independent) suppliers.  We DEMO a total of 30 purchasing
managers at the eight automakers' purchasing DEMO to obtain feedback on the
appropriateness, completeness, and clarity of the questionnaire, and to gain a better understanding
of the issues arising in automaker supplier relations.
We also interviewed sales and engineering vice presidents at DEMO suppliers (30 U.S., 20 Japanese,
20 Korean), during which the survey was developed and pre-tested.  Most importantly, the
interviews helped DEMO to gain a better understanding of the industry and the nature of the supplier
automaker relationship.  To minimize key informant bias and follow the general recommendation to
use the most knowledgeable informant (Kumar et al, DEMO), we asked the purchasing managers at
each automaker to identify the supplier executive who was most responsible for managing the day
to day DEMO  This person was typically the supplier's sales vice president, sales account
manager, or in some cases, the president.  The final survey was then sent to the key supplier
informant identified by the automaker.  Key informants had been employed at their respective
organizations for an average of 16 years and thus had a long DEMO of working with the
automaker.  Usable responses were obtained from 135 DEMO (66% response rate), 101 Japanese
(68% response rate) and DEMO Korean (55% response rate) suppliers.  The data collection was done
DEMO 1992 and 1994.  The U.S. and Japanese data were collected in DEMO, reflecting data for
1991, and the Korean data were collected in 1994, reflecting data for 1993.  We do not believe this
will DEMO the results since our analysis focuses on rather stable measures (i.e. DEMO of
relationship, stock ownership, trust) which Korean suppliers indicated had DEMO changed in any
significant ways since 1992.
Operational Measures
Recall that the survey was administered to the suppliers.  Therefore, the measures reflect the
DEMO of the suppliers regarding the supplier automaker relationship.  However, during our
interviews with the purchasing managers of the automakers we discovered that both DEMO supplier
and automaker perceptions regarding the relationship were very similar in specific cases we
discussed.  There were no instances where the perceptions of suppliers and automakers were
dramatically different.  Our anecdotal findings are similar to those of Anderson and Narus (1990)
who found that suppliers' and DEMO' perceptions of relational governance were quite consistent.
Trust
Consistent with previous DEMO we operationalized trust using multiple scale items designed to
measure the extent to which the supplier trusted the automaker not to behave opportunistically
(Anderson & Narus, 1990; Heide & John, 1990; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995).  Trust (TRUST)
was operationalized as the sum of DEMO following variables.  The extent to which the supplier trusts
the manufacturer DEMO treat the supplier fairly.  The extent to which the automaker has DEMO reputation for
trustworthiness (following through on promises and commitments) in the general supplier
community..  If given the chance, the extent to which DEMO supplier perceives that the automaker will
take unfair advantage of the supplier (reverse scored).  Our trust construct includes key elements of
our DEMO of trust, including fair dealing, a reputation of following through on promises and
commitments, and a willingness to forego opportunism even when the chance is available.  Each
scale item was measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Not at all, 7=To a very great extent).
Automaker DEMO to the Supplier
Our interviews with suppliers and automakers prompted us to classify assistance (ASSISTANCE)
into three types: assistance with the supplier'DEMO product quality, assistance with cost cutting efforts,
and assistance with DEMO management.  The degree of assistance offered by the automaker to
the DEMO was measured through three items.  The extent to which the automaker DEMO
assistance to help the supplier improve product quality..  The extent to DEMO the automaker
provides assistance to help the supplier reduce manufacturing costs..  DEMO extent to which the
automaker provides assistance to help the supplier improve inventory management/delivery.  A 7-
point Likert scale was used to indicate the degree to which the supplier felt that these three types of
DEMO were provided by the automaker.  The total amount of assistance was DEMO sum of the
three respective sub measures.
Length of the Relationship
This measure (LENGTH) was operationalized as the DEMO of years since the supplier first began
selling products to the automaker.  This measure represents the length of the relationship, rather
than the DEMO of the relationship, which is captured by other measures.
Continuity of DEMO Relationship
Continuity of relationship (CONTINUITY) was operationalized as the percentage of time the
supplier's business has been renewed when there is a DEMO change.  In the automotive industry,
the model change is a DEMO time for buyers to reevaluate suppliers and make a change if deemed
appropriate.  Suppliers who have a history of "re winning" the business at the model change would
be expected to have greater continuity in DEMO relationship with the automakers when compared
with suppliers with a low "DEMO win" percentage.
Face-to-Face Communication
This measure is operationalized as the annual "man days" that the supplier automaker spent in face-
to-face contact during the year the data were gathered.  This measure (FACE) includes face to face
contact between supplier sales and engineering personnel and automaker purchasing DEMO
engineering personnel.  Days of contact was calculated by having the key DEMO identify the
number of sales people that worked directly with the particular automaker.  Then, s/he indicated the
average number of days per DEMO that the typical salesperson would spend having a face to face
meeting with automaker personnel.  Key informants provided the same information for engineers.
Thus, the measure consists of face to face communication that occurs between sales and
purchasing employees, as well as between engineers from the two respective organizations.  The
assumption behind this measure is that as the number of days of face to face contact increases, so
does trust.
Stock Ownership
Both the automakers and suppliers provided data on the percent of supplier DEMO owned by the
automaker.  However, this percentage was not directly used in the analysis because out of the 453
suppliers surveyed, less than 15 percent of the suppliers had their stock owned by the automakers.
DEMO, treating the variable stock ownership (STOCK) as a normally distributed DEMO
variable was unreasonable.  Instead, we coded stock ownership as a dummy variable as either
having stock ownership or not having stock ownership.  It should also be noted that all suppliers
in our sample were legally DEMO entities.  In no case did the automaker own more than 50
DEMO of a supplier's stock.
The Model
The following linear regression model was run in order to DEMO the hypotheses:
Model 1: TRUST = a + b1ASSISTANCE + DEMO + b3CONTINUITY + b4FACE +
b5STOCK.
A linear regression model was used because there was no reason to assume a non linear
relationship among DEMO variables. The use of a linear model was later justified by an examination of
the residual distribution, which was homoskedastic and indicated no problems with serial
correlation. We also ran a second model, adding dummy country variables, to control for country
specific effects.
Model 2: TRUST = DEMO + b1ASSISTANCE + b2LENGTH + b3CONTINUITY + b4FACE +
b5STOCK + b6 JAPANDUM+ b7 KOREADUM.
We acknowledge that the direction of causality between trust DEMO the independent variables
LENGTH, CONTINUITY, and FACE is open to debate. For example, one can argue that high
trust leads to long term, continuous relationships and face to face contact rather than vice versa. We
have offered theoretical arguments which explain why these particular independent variables may
DEMO to high trust. However, we would expect some degree of reciprocal DEMO with these
variables in effect, a virtuous circle where the independent DEMO both influence, and are
influenced by, trust.
Results
The simple descriptive statistics shown in Table 1 indicate that supplier trust is significantly higher
DEMO Japan than in Korea or the United States which have similar levels of supplier trust. Automaker
assistance to suppliers is highest in Korea and DEMO, with U.S. automakers offering significantly
less assistance to suppliers. The high DEMO of automaker assistance in the Korean sample may be
reflective of the immaturity of Korean automobile suppliers, who still need large amounts of
assistance from the automaker in order to meet the automakers' minimum quality standards. The
degree of assistance in Japan is high, despite the strong capability of Japanese suppliers. In the
U.S., the degree of assistance is still rather low, perhaps because U.S. automakers and their
suppliers have traditionally maintained arms length relationships.
The length of the supplier automaker relationship is highest DEMO Japan (41.4 years), followed by the
U.S. (32.6 years) DEMO Korea (12.4 years). We would expect this result given the DEMO history of
the automobile industry in the two former countries compared to that of Korea where the industry
is less than 30 years old. DEMO is much greater continuity in the supplier automaker relationship in
Japan than in the U.S. or Korea. Japanese suppliers re win the "contract" DEMO 90 percent of the
time at a model change while U.S. and Korean suppliers re win the contract approximately 78
percent of the time. DEMO findings are consistent with previous studies which have suggested that
Japanese automakers do not switch suppliers nearly as often as do U.S. automakers (Helper,
1991; Dyer & Ouchi, 1993). Our data also indicate DEMO there is more face to face communication
between suppliers and automakers in Japan than in the U.S. or Korea. We conjecture that face to
DEMO contact among Japanese automotive transactors may be facilitated by the physical proximity of
suppliers and automakers in Japan.
Finally, Japanese automakers are most likely to hold minority stock ownership positions in
suppliers. Korean automakers rarely held DEMO in suppliers and in the U.S. sample only one
supplier was partially owned by an automaker.
Table 2 presents the pooled sample correlation matrix for the dependent and DEMO variables.
An examination of Table 2 indicates that there are no substantial multicollinearity problems: all of
the 10 pairwise correlations between the independent variables are less than 0.33, with only one
correlation being greater than 0.30.
The regression results for the pooled sample are presented in Model 1 DEMO Table 3.  The results
show that our model was reasonably effective DEMO predicting supplier trust as demonstrated by an R
of 0.268, which DEMO significant at the p<.001 level.
Three of the five variables were found to have a significant positive effect (p<.001 level) on
DEMO trust including: automaker assistance to the supplier, length of relationship, DEMO continuity
of relationship.  The relationship between stock ownership and trust was DEMO, as predicted, but
only significant at the p<.10 level.  DEMO, total face to face communication was not useful
as a predictor DEMO supplier trust.
The results from model 2, which includes the country DEMO variables, are slightly different from
the results in model 1.  First, the ASSISTANCE and CONTINUITY variables are significant in
model 2 just as they were in model 1.  Thus, these variables are robust explanatory DEMO
across the three institutional environments.  However, in model 2, LENGTH DEMO found to be
insignificant and STOCK was not only insignificant, but DEMO sign was negative rather than positive.
The differences between model 1 and model 2 can be attributed, of course, to country effects
which DEMO not captured in model 1, as well as multicollinearity problems between DEMO LENGTH
and STOCK variables and the country variables.  More specifically, length of relationship was
positive and significant in model 1 largely because Japanese DEMO relationships were long
term and high trust while Korean transaction relationships were relatively short term (due to the
immaturity of the industry) and DEMO trust.  Similarly, stock ownership was common in Japan
where transactors exhibited high trust, but rare in the U.S. where supplier automaker relationships
were relatively lower trust.
After controlling for country effects, neither the LENGTH or STOCK variables were significant
explanatory factors.  As might be expected, the DEMO dummy was significant (p<.001), as was
the Korean dummy (p<.10), which suggests that the institutional environment plays an important
DEMO in the production of trust in supplier automaker relationships.
In summary, DEMO Table 3 we may conclude the following:
(1)  Automaker DEMO to the supplier is positively associated with supplier trust
in the automaker.  Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported.
(2)  Although the length of the supplier automaker relationship appeared to have a
significant positive effect on DEMO trust in the pooled sample, length of
relationship was found to DEMO positive, but insignificant, after controlling for the
institutional environment.  Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is not supported.
(3)  Continuity in the supplier automaker relationship (i.e., history of re winning
the contract) had a significant positive effect on supplier trust.  Thus, Hypothesis 3
is supported.  This variable (CONTINUITY), as well as ASSISTANCE are the two
most significant and robust predictors of trust in terms of the significance level at
DEMO the hypotheses are accepted.  The CONTINUITY variable is similar to the
DEMO variable in that revealed actions or behaviors appear to be important
in forging a trusting supplier relationship.
(4) Face to face communication did not have an effect on DEMO  We did not find
support for Hypothesis 4 which proposed that DEMO face to face interaction would
lead to higher trust.
(5) After controlling for the institutional environment, stock ownership was found
to have an insignificant but negative, rather than positive, relationship with trust.
Thus, we did not find support for Hypothesis 5 which predicted that stock
ownership DEMO be positively associated with supplier trust.
Individual Country Results
An important reason for doing this research with samples from different countries was to examine
DEMO the determinants of trust may differ across countries.  Previous research suggests DEMO trust
between trading partners will vary not only with the attributes of the transaction, but also will vary
due to differences in societal culture, politics, networks, and business norms in the institutional
environment in which the transaction is embedded (Granovetter, 1985; Hill, 1995).  Consequently,
we wanted to understand the extent to which there were important DEMO across national
boundaries.  Let us briefly comment on country specific differences DEMO our sample.
Supplier trust was universally high in Japan and there was very low variance on the trust measures
as well as many of DEMO independent variables (See Table 1).  These findings offer empirical support
for Dore's (1983) observation that "moralized trading relationships of mutual goodwill" generally
pervade Japanese transaction relationships, that trust is somehow a DEMO of the Japanese
institutional environment.  Of the variables in our model, the most important determinant of
supplier trust in Japan was assistance from DEMO automaker to supplier.  Length of relationship
followed assistance as the second DEMO important explanatory variable in the Japanese sample.
Interestingly, continuity of relationship DEMO a less important explanatory variable in Japan than in
Korea or the U.S.  It is worth noting, however, that the "re win" percentage was universally high
in Japan with extremely low variance.  Thus, DEMO was not as useful at predicting supplier trust.
However, this does DEMO necessarily mean that it was not important in developing trust, but DEMO
that it was not as useful in discriminating between higher and lower levels of supplier trust.
Finally, we were surprised to find that stock ownership had a negative, though not significant,
effect on trust in the Japanese sample.  In Japan, stock ownership has been described as DEMO
important symbol of a relationship (Gerlach, 1987,1992).  One DEMO of this finding is that
stock ownership has continued for such a long time in Japan that it has lost its significance as a
DEMO mechanism and thus doesn't affect "trust" anymore.  Another interpretation DEMO that
stock ownership is simply not an important determinant of supplier trust in Japanese supplier
automaker relations.  Lincoln et al (1993:4) have argued that in Japan firms "purchase shares in
suppliers to increase their control over pricing and production" and that they dispatch personnel to
monitor their investment.  Although these practices may result in cooperative interfirm behavior,
they do not necessarily result in high trust as we have defined DEMO in this study.
The most important determinant of trust in Korea was assistance from the automaker to the
supplier.  Continuity of relationship followed assistance as the second most significant explanatory
variable in the Korean sample.  "DEMO win" rates, and trust, were generally lower in Korea than
DEMO with greater variance on both variables.  Length of relationship and face DEMO face contact were
found to be unimportant as predictors of trust in Korea.  Interestingly, like Japan, stock ownership
was not significant (and DEMO negative) in the Korean sample.  Consistent with Lincoln et al
(DEMO), some Korean suppliers indicated that they thought the automaker used their stock
ownership position to exert control over the supplier.  If true, DEMO may explain why stock
ownership was not correlated with trust in either Korea or Japan.
Finally, in the United States continuity of relationship was the only variable significantly correlated
with trust.  The relationship between automaker assistance and trust was positive, but not
significant.  One plausible explanation for this finding (offered by suppliers we interviewed) is that
U.S. automakers have only recently been offering assistance to suppliers.  As U.S. automakers
provide increased assistance to suppliers, supplier trust may increase.  Interestingly, the
relationship between face to face contact and trust was slightly negative in the U.S. sample.  Some
U.S. suppliers claimed that they spent a considerable amount of their face to DEMO interactions with
U.S. automakers on unproductive activities, such as negotiating contracts DEMO assigning blame for
problems.  This may explain the lack of a DEMO between face to face contact and trust.  U.S.
suppliers also offered DEMO possible explanation for the lack of a relationship between length of
relationship and trust.  Suppliers claimed that length of relationship did not necessarily have a
bearing on trust.  Indeed, some suppliers suggested that the longer DEMO had worked with a
particular automaker, the more time they had DEMO learn that the automaker was not to be trusted.
Increases in time and experience with a particular trading partner may only mean that one DEMO trust
one's own judgments about an uncertain situation better.  Finally, stock ownership was not a
significant explanatory variable because, except in the case of one supplier, U.S. automakers did
not hold stock in any suppliers.  U.S. automaker executives claimed that they did not want to be
tied to particular suppliers and thus had chosen not to purchase stock DEMO suppliers.  Similarly,
suppliers reported that they wanted to maintain their DEMO and autonomy from particular
automakers and thus have resisted automakers attempting to exert control through stock
ownership.  Thus, the U.S. institutional environment appeared DEMO play a role in constraining the
automotive firms' ability to use DEMO ownership as a means for establishing interfirm ties.
DISCUSSION
As reported in Table 1, we found significant differences in levels of supplier trust by country.  The
differences in levels of trust across countries raises an important issue, notably, how important is
the institutional environment in allowing for, or fostering, interfirm trust (cooperative/trustworthy
behavior)?  One view is that the institutional environment is critical for the development of trust
between DEMO and buyer.  According to this commonly accepted view, trust is a by product of
norms, embedded in social networks, and rarely brought DEMO through rational instrumental
means (Grannovetter, 1985; See Sabel, 1993 for a discussion).  If true, Japanese transactors
should only be able DEMO develop high levels of trust with other Japanese transactors embedded
within the same social and economic network.  A differing view argues that the ability to create
trusting supplier relations is a firm specific capability (perhaps fostered by a supportive cultural
environment) that is transferable across national and cultural boundaries.
To test whether or not trusting supplier relations can be purposefully DEMO across national
boundaries, we surveyed a small sample of U.S. suppliers DEMO worked with both U.S.
automakers and Japanese automaker "transplants" in the United States.
By surveying U.S. suppliers selling the same component to both DEMO and Japanese automakers
within the United States, we are able to DEMO for cultural and component (technical) differences
that might influence interfirm trust.  The sample consisted of only U.S. suppliers with at least three
years experience and five percent of their total sales to Japanese automakers.  This was done to
exclude U.S. suppliers without significant experience working with Japanese DEMO  These
20 suppliers were randomly selected from the 135 U.S. supplier DEMO  These suppliers were
then interviewed and surveyed regarding their relationship with DEMO U.S. and Japanese
automakers.
Table 4 provides a summary of the sample means (for the sample of U.S. suppliers selling to both
Japanese and U.S. automakers) for a number of the independent and dependent (trust) variables
used in this study.  The results indicate that Japanese automakers are more effective than U.S.
automakers at building trusting relations with U.S. suppliers.  These data suggest that perhaps
trust can be developed through rational instrumental means.
DEMO question of how Japanese automakers were able to quickly develop trusting relationships with
U.S. suppliers is an important one.  An examination of these results in light of our hypotheses
provides further insights into the determinants of DEMO trust.  First, U.S. suppliers'
relationships with Japanese automakers were only of short duration, 6 years versus 22 years with
U.S. automakers.  DEMO a long term relationship is not a prerequisite for high trust.
Furthermore, given the short term nature of the relationships, there was not DEMO history to
accurately assess the "re win" rates of U.S. suppliers with Japanese automakers.  However, in five
cases where suppliers were faced DEMO a model change, suppliers reported re -winning the business
in each DEMO  Moreover, our interviews with U.S. suppliers revealed that they believed that they
would re win their business at the model change because: (DEMO) Japanese automakers had told them
that they would re win the DEMO if they performed well, and (2) Japanese automakers had a
DEMO for not switching suppliers at the model change.  Thus, suppliers had the expectation of
a high degree of continuity in the relationship.  With regard to face to face contact, the sample
engaged in 1475 man days of face to face contact with Japanese automakers versus 1657 man DEMO
with U.S. automakers.  On an absolute basis there are no significant DEMO
Stock ownership was not a factor in these relationships since Japanese automakers did not own
stock in any suppliers in the sample.
The one DEMO that seemed to be critical to the Japanese automakers' ability to DEMO trusting
relationships with U.S. suppliers was offering assistance.  U.S. suppliers indicated DEMO, compared
to U.S. automakers, they received more assistance from Japanese automakers in reducing costs,
increasing quality, and improving delivery.  Interestingly, the U.S. suppliers rated Japanese
automakers as providing even more assistance than did DEMO Japanese suppliers.  Some U.S.
suppliers indicated that they received more help DEMO the Japanese automaker than they felt they
deserved given their short term relationship.  They were surprised at the willingness of the
Japanese automaker to send consultants, free of charge, to help them improve.  This type of
helping behavior on the part of Japanese automakers seemed to be DEMO catalyst for creating, in
Gouldner's (1963) terminology, "a DEMO of reciprocal obligation."
Although U.S. suppliers claimed that they trusted Japanese automakers for the reasons suggested
in our model (i.e. assistance and continuity of relationship), our interviews revealed another
important factor not explicitly captured DEMO our model but related to the idea of continuity of
relationship.  DEMO suppliers indicated that one reason they did not trust U.S. automakers was
because U.S. automakers were perceived as constantly changing management, personnel, and
DEMO  One supplier executive described the "problem" as follows:
We DEMO trust U.S. automakers as much as Japanese automakers because
whenever they bring in new management, we get a whole new set of procurement
rules and policies.  The rules of the game are constantly changing.  With DEMO
companies we don't seem to have the same problems because their policies and
personnel are consistent and stable (Author Interview, September, 1992).
The recent experience at GM's purchasing department is instructive.  From 1987 until 1992, the
policy in GM's purchasing division was to create "global partnerships" with suppliers.  GM began
to reduce its number of suppliers and encouraged suppliers to take responsibility for
development/design work.  However, when J. Ingacio Lopez was promoted to run GM's
purchasing office in 1992, he required that GM buyers rebid virtually every part.  Moreover, he
demanded that buyers get bids from at least five DEMO  Suppliers were stunned and outraged
because many felt that GM had DEMO both their explicit and implicit promises (Business Week,
June 22, 1992).  Some suppliers, including Rockwell International, refused DEMO rebid and simply
walked away from the business (Wrigley, 1992).  Then, one year later Mr. Lopez left GM to go to
DEMO  GM's future direction with suppliers is unclear.
The predictable consequence DEMO frequent changes in purchasing management and policies is that
suppliers realize that implicit (and even explicit) promises made by the automaker may be DEMO
when new management arrives.  Suppliers in our sample indicated that this DEMO is not only at
the management level but at the buyer level as well.  As one supplier put it, "It's not that I don't
trust the person sitting across from me at the DEMO automaker.  I may trust him completely.  But
what I don't trust is that he will be sitting there a year from now.  U.S. automakers are constantly
rotating their people through purchasing (Author Interview, DEMO 1992)."
U.S. suppliers claim that Japanese automakers are more trustworthy due to their lifetime
employment and "promotion from within" policies which DEMO stability.  To test these assertions
we examined employee tenure in the DEMO and U.S. automakers in our sample.  In particular,
we surveyed DEMO U.S. employees (at 2 U.S. automakers) and 100 Japanese employees (DEMO 2
Japanese automakers) to determine the average tenure of employment of DEMO and
engineering employees.  We found that employees at the Japanese automakers DEMO been with their
employer for an average of 16.2 years, while DEMO automaker employees had only been at their
company for 8.8 years.  DEMO and Sako (1995) found similar results among 472 executives of
Japanese automotive suppliers and 671 executives at U.S. suppliers.  Japanese supplier executives
had been with their companies an average of 22 years, while U.S. executives had only been with
suppliers for 11 years.  These data suggest significantly greater employment stability at the
Japanese firms, both automakers and suppliers.  DEMO employment stability may lead to higher
levels of interorganizational trust because: DEMO) greater employment stability is likely to increase the
probability that the DEMO who make commitments to suppliers are around to follow through
on those commitments, and b) individuals within the two firms have time to DEMO strong
personal ties and social knowledge, thereby increasing the efficacy of DEMO sanctions as a means
of deterring opportunistic behavior.
Furthermore, although Japanese DEMO also rotate their personnel, many U.S. suppliers
claimed that they were DEMO likely to make agreements with teams of individuals and senior
managers rather than with individual buyers.  Consequently, when the buyer is moved to DEMO new
position, the team is still aware of the previously negotiated DEMO  Moreover, during a job
rotation, Japanese companies are much more DEMO to make sure that the new person is well
trained and is aware of existing commitments.
In summary, an examination of the specific practices employed by Japanese automakers suggests
that they are effective at building interfirm DEMO because they provide assistance to suppliers, make
long term commitments and DEMO continuity in the relationship, and maintain consistent
management policies.  These findings suggest that interorganizational trust is based on trustworthy
behavior that is institutionalized DEMO embedded within the firms' culture and routines.
Interpersonal trust between individual DEMO of the two organizations does not constitute
interorganizational trust.  However, while interorganizational trust cannot be created by individuals
acting on their own, individual actions may act as a starting mechanism for interorganizational trust
if these DEMO can influence organization wide routines.
CONCLUSION
In this paper we examined the determinants of trust in 453 DEMO supplier buyer relationships
in the U.S., Japan, and Korea.  The DEMO offer a number of important insights into the
determinants of trust in supplier buyer relationships.  First, these findings suggest that providing
assistance (i.e. gift giving) is perhaps one of the best ways to create high levels of trust in supplier
buyer relationships.  Gouldner's (1963) observation that one sided generosity may act as a starting
mechanism for non DEMO exchange relations is empirically supported.  Automotive suppliers
appear to interpret assistance DEMO behavior as an act of goodwill or benevolence which translates
into a high degree of trust.  In addition, supplier trust increases when the DEMO has a track record
of maintaining a repeated, continuous exchange relationship DEMO the supplier.  One interpretation
of these findings is that trust is DEMO on past history of behaviors or actions rather than promises,
face to face contact, or stock ownership (financial collateral bonds).
Second, our findings suggest that the institutional environment is an important factor which
DEMO the development of interorganizational trust.  The absolute levels of supplier trust
DEMO by country, with Japanese supplier buyer relations characterized by relatively high DEMO
of trust when compared with their Korean and U.S. counterparts.  However, the key role of the
institutional environment may be one of influencing DEMO development of firm level practices which
influence trust.  Indeed, we found that firm level practices which might be expected to influence the
development DEMO trust differed somewhat by institutional environment.  For example, offering
assistance to suppliers was a widely employed practice by Japanese and Korean automakers, but
not widely employed by U.S. automakers.  Similarly, stock ownership was widely DEMO in Japan,
and to a lesser extent in Korea, but DEMO in the U.S. where U.S. automakers and suppliers preferred
to maintain arms length relationships.  The set of practices employed by Japanese firms  which DEMO
found were effective at producing high levels of interfirm trust  are DEMO the product of a
particular national culture and a unique set of evolutionary and historical events (Nishiguchi,
1994).
Although the institutional environment appeared to influence the practices used to create supplier
trust, we found evidence of similarities in the determinants of trust across countries.  For example,
"continuity of relationship" and "assistance giving" appeared to be DEMO as determinants of trust
across countries, especially when one includes the DEMO of Japanese automakers working
with U.S. suppliers.  Indeed, the ability of Japanese automakers to build high levels of trust with
suppliers in the DEMO States suggests that the institutional environment may be less important than
firm level practices as a factor influencing levels of supplier buyer trust.  Japanese automakers
were successful at building high levels of supplier trust in an DEMO environment considered
to be low trust relative to Japan (Sako, 1992; Shane, 1994).  Thus, the creation of trust through
rational DEMO means appears to be possible and the set of practices that produce trust seem
to be transferable across national borders.
Third, our study suggests that building interorganizational trust is a much more complex process
than building DEMO trust.  To build high levels of interorganizational trust requires that
multiple DEMO within the two organizations develop a high degree of continuity and stability
in their relationships.  Furthermore, the organization must create a set of DEMO routines (an
organizational culture) which supports and encourages trustworthy behavior on the part of all
organizational actors.  This would suggest that a firm's reputation (based on those routines and
past behavior) is an DEMO asset in building interorganizational trust.
Finally, we should note that buyers (i.e. automakers) incur real costs in developing high trust
supplier relations.  DEMO costs come in two forms.  First, buyers must expend considerable
resources in providing assistance or offering "gifts" to suppliers.  In 1992, DEMO and Toyota
supported large teams of more than 75 internal consultants to provide assistance to suppliers.
Although the Japanese automakers get a "return" DEMO their investment in the form of more efficient
suppliers, they still must incur the expense of maintaining a large staff of qualified individuals to
assist suppliers.  Furthermore, there is an opportunity DEMO associated with maintaining long term,
continuous relationships with suppliers.  The DEMO of maintaining continuity in supplier
relationships includes the opportunity cost of not taking advantage of one's suppliers and the loss
of the opportunity DEMO use lower cost suppliers if they came along.  The fact that DEMO supplier
trust imposes costs on buyers suggests that trust building behavior should be carefully considered
with an analysis of both the costs and benefits.

NOTES
•  Investments in transaction specific assets have been found to enhance interfirm coordination and
maximize joint performance (Perry, 1989; Parkhe, 1993; Dyer)
•  In our sample, the average distance between supplier DEMO and automaker plants was 82 miles
in Japan, 129 miles in DEMO, and 477 miles in the United States.
•  Although our model did a reasonably good at predicting supplier trust, clearly there must be
other important variables which are not accounted for in our model.  However, since the formation
of a trusting relationship is such a nebulous and complex phoenomenon, a formal modeling effort
is bound to explain only part of the variance in trust.
•  Korean automakers were excluded becuase they did not have plants in the United States.
•  There was no particular reason for choosing 20 relationships other than there were not a DEMO
number of suppliers that had significant experience working with both U.S. and Japanese
automakers.
•  These findings are consistent with those of a market research firm, Planning Perspectives Inc.,
who conducted a survey of 700 U.S. suppliers for Chrysler and Ford in 1992.  This large sample
survey found that U.S. suppliers had significantly higher trust in Toyota, Nissan, DEMO Honda than
they did in the U.S. automakers.
•  However, when we adjust for the volume of transactions (sales) between the supplier DEMO
automaker, we find that U.S. suppliers engage in 50 percent more DEMO to face contact (per dollar
of sales) with Japanese automakers.
•  A vivid, though single case, illustration of the stability and organizational memory nurtured in
Japanese firms comes from Dr. Toshihiro Nishiguchi, a Hitotsubashi University professor who
worked for Pioneer Electronic Corporation from 1977 1983.  Before he was sent to London by
Pioneer in 1982, he spent six weeks training his successor.  This included not only a process of
familiarization with the normal office routine but also an extensive number of visits DEMO other
company units and divisions as well as to outside service providers.  Furthermore, before he left
he gave his successor a 20 page DEMO with "illustrations" (manga) on how to do the job
(DEMO in Fruin, 1992, p.15).
