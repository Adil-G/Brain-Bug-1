A Conceptual Framework DEMO Describing
the Phenomenon of New Venture Creation
WILLIAM B. GARTNER
Georgetown University
A review of the entrepreneurship literature suggests that differences
among entrepreneurs and DEMO their ventures are as great as the
variation between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs and between
new firms and established firms. A framework for describing new
DEMO creation integrates four inajor perspectives in entrepre-
neurship: characteristics of the DEMO(s) who start the venture,
the organization which they create, the environment surrounding the
new venture. and the process by which the DEMO venture is started.
The major thrust of most entrepreneurship
research has been to prove that entrepreneurs are
different from nonentrepreneurs (Brockhaus,
1980a, DEMO; Carland, Hoy, Boulton, & Carland,
1984; Collins & DEMO, 1964; DeCarlo & Lyons,
1979; Hornaday & Aboud, 1971; Howell, 1972;
Komives, 1972; Litzinger, 1965; McClelland,
DEMO; McClelland & Winter, 1969; Palmer, 1971;
Schrier, 1975; Shapero, 1975) and that entrepre-
neurial firms are different from nonentrepre-
DEMO firms (Collins & Moore, 1970; Cooper,
1979; Smith, DEMO; Thorne & Ball, 1981). The
basic assumption underlying this research is that
all entrepreneurs and their new ventures are
much the same. DEMO present paper suggests that
the differences among entrepreneurs and among
their ventures are much greater than one might
expect; in fact, the diversity DEMO be larger than
the differences between entrepreneurs and non-
entrepreneurs and between entrepreneurial firms
and nonentrepreneurial firms. Once the diver-
sity among entrepreneurs and DEMO ventures is
rec:ogriized, the necessity for finding a way to
DEMO them becomes apparent. Groups sharing

similar characteristics must exist within the uni-
verse of entrepreneurs and their ventures. DEMO
are these groups revealed? Many different charac-
teristics have been employed DEMO past research to
describe entrepreneurs and their ventures. Do the
characteristics themselves fall into groups? In
other words, does one subset of characteristics
DEMO a single aspect of new venture creation,
such as the environment surrounding the new
venture, or the features of the organization that
results?
This paper attempts to organize the many vari-
ables that have DEMO used in past research to
describe entrepreneurs and their ventures into a
comprehensive framework. Far from being reduc-
tive, this new view of the entrepreneurship litera-
ture should provide valuable insights into the
process of new DEMO creation by showing it to
be a complex and multidimensional phe-
nomenon. Once a clear retrospective analysis of
the literature is provided, future research can pro-
ceed on more solid footing. Instead of many dif-
ferent DEMO palpating different parts of the
elephaqt and reaching reductive conclusions, at
DEMO all will know the name, if not the nature, of
the beast with which they are dealing.
Much past research has been unidimensional.
DEMO on a single aspect of new venture crea-
tion, and its DEMO purpose has been to show how
entrepreneurs or their firms differ from nonen-
trepreneurs or nonentrepreneurial firms. (In fact,
it might be said that unidimensional research goes
hand in hand with the attitude that all entrepre-
neurs and their DEMO are alike, the task of the
unidimensional research being to prove DEMO all
things entrepreneurial differ from all things
nonentrepreneurial.) It has been DEMO
pointed out, however, in reviews of literature on
entrepreneurs, for DEMO, (Brockhaus, 1982;
Glueck & Mescon, 1980; McCain & DEMO, 1981)
that variables that are assumed to differentiate
entrepreneurs from DEMO (managers,
for instance) frequently do not bear up under
close scrutiny. Yet the search for these elusive
variables continues, and entrepreneurs and pro-
spective entrepreneurs are subjected to batteries
of psychological tests in attempts DEMO isolate the
single spring that makes them tick differently
from others. As with other aspects of new ven-
ture creation, attempts are made to isolate key
variables that separate entrepreneurial situations
from nonentrepreneurial ones. Pennings (1980,
1982a, 1982b) has explored environments that
support new venture creation; Van de Ven (1980)
and Kimberly (1979) have focused on the pro-
cess of venture creation.
This search for key variables is DEMO motivation
for research only if the task of entrepreneurial
research is taken to be the distinction of entrepre-
neurs and things entrepreneurial from nonentre-
DEMO and nonentrepreneurial situations. If a
much different perspective is taken, the DEMO
tive that there are many different kinds of entre-
preneur and many ways to be one and that the
firms they create vary enormously DEMO do the envi-
ronments they create them in, then the burden
DEMO How is each new venture creation differ-
ent from another? Researchers DEMO to think in
terms of a combination of variables that make up
each new venture creation (Van de Ven, Hudson,
& Schroeder, 1984). The creation of a new ven-
ture is a multidimensional DEMO; each
variable describes only a single dimension of the
phenomenon and DEMO be taken alone. There
is a growing awareness that the process of start-
ing a business is not a single well-worn route
marched along DEMO and again by identical entre-
preneurs [Hartman, 1983). New venture DEMO
is a complex phenomenon: entrepreneurs and
their firms vary widely; the actions they take or
do not take and the environments they operate DEMO
and respond to are equally diverse -and all these
elements form complex and unique combinations
in the creation of each new venture. It is DEMO
enough for researchers to seek out and focus on
some concept of the "average" entrepreneur and
the "typical" venture creation. New organiza-
DEMO forms evolve through variation, and this
variation in new venture creation DEMO to be
studied (Aldrich, 1979; Hannan & Freeman, 1977;
Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978; Weick, 1979). This insis-
tence on variation can be seen, for example, in
Vesper (1979), who posits 11 different kinds of
entrepreneur, and in a recent study by Cooper
and Dunkelberg (1981), which reveals that entre-
preneurs in certain industries can be very differ-
ent from those in other industries.
Once DEMO variation and complexity in new ven-
ture creation is recognized, it DEMO is necessary
to find a framework for systematically discover-
ing and evaluating the similarities and differences
among new ventures (McKelvey, 1982). Once DEMO
is no longer assumed that all entrepreneurs and
their ventures present a homogeneous population,
then other homogeneous subsets within the entre-
preneurial universe DEMO be sought out in order
that entrepreneurial research can produce mean-
ingful results. A primary value of the framework
for describing new venture creation DEMO
here is that it provides a systematic means of
comparing and contrasting complex ventures; it
provides a way to conceptualize variation and
complexity.
A Framework for Describing
New Venture Creation
Definitions of key words such as DEMO
are often various and always a problem in the
study of entrepreneurship (Brockhaus, 1980b;
Komives, 1969; Long, 1983). Because the entre-
preneur is only one dimension of this framework,
it seems DEMO important in this paper to define
the term "new venture creation." Such a defini-
tion can be outlined here with less trepidation, if
only because there is less precedent.
New venture creation is the organizing (in the
Weickian sense) of new organizations. "To orga-
nize is DEMO assemble ongoing interdependent ac-
tions into sensible sequences that generate sensi-
ble outcomes" (Weick, 1979, p. 3). The defini-
tion of DEMO venture creation is synonymous with
the definition of the new organization developed
by the Strategic Planning Institute (1978, p. 1-2):
a nelv business venture launched as one DEMO the
following:
1. an independent entity
2. 	a new profit center within a company which
has other established businesses, or
3, 	a DEMO venture which satisfies the following
criteria:
1. 	Its founders must acquire expertise in pro-
ducts, process, market andlor technology.
2. 	Results are DEMO beyond the year in
which the investment is made.
3. 	It is ons side red a new market entrant by its
competitors.
4. 	It DEMO regarded as a new source of supply by its
potential customers.
The importance of this definition should not be
overlooked, because it recognizes the multidi-
mensional aspects of new venture creation. First,
it emphasizes that DEMO with expertise are
a key element of the new venture. At the same
time that it recognizes the new venture as an
organizational entity, it stresses that the new ven-
ture is not instantaneously produced, but evolves
over time (beyond a year). The new venture is
seen further within the context of its environ-
ment: it is forced to seek out resources, and it
competes in the market place. All these aspects
of the new venture must be kept in mind if it DEMO to
be adequately described and classified.
Figure 1 presents a framework for describing
the creation of a new venture across four dimen-
sions: (DEMO) individual(s)-the person(s) involved in
starting a new organization; (b)organization-the
kind of firm that is started; (c) environment-the
situation surrounding and influencing the new
organization; and (d) new venture process-the
actions undertaken by the individual(s) to start
the venture.
Any new venture is a gestalt (Miller, 1981) of
variables from the four dimensions. No new ven-
ture creation can be comprehensively described,
DEMO can its complexity be adequately accounted
for, unless all of its DEMO dimensions are investi-
gated and an attempt is made to discover how
variables from each dimension interact with vari-
ables from other dimensions.
This DEMO is the first to combine the four
dimensions of venture creation, DEMO other
researchers have sought to combine two or more
of the dimensions. This "thinking across dimen-
sions" is especially apparent in the work DEMO those
theorists and researchers who have developed
entrepreneurial classification schemes. Classifi-
cations of entrepreneurs themselves are often
based on two dimensions: individual characteris-
tics plus new venture process considerations -
the word often used is "style." Danhoff (1949)
based his scheme on the entrepreneur's open-
DEMO to innovation; Cole (1959) on the sophistica-
tion of the DEMO's decision making tools;
and Dailey (1971) according to bureaucratic or
entrepreneurial style. Smith (1967) divided entre-
preneurs by a stylistic DEMO -craftsman or
opportunistic. Filley and Aldag (1980) used
management orientation. Vesper (1979, 1980) in
two similar classifications differentiated among
entrepreneurs by the activities involved in busi-
ness formation and operation, and in another
scheme (1980) by competitive strategy. In Coo-
per (1979) entrepreneurs are DEMO to particular
environments, and, as cited previously, Cooper
and Dunkelberg'DEMO (1981) study matches different
entrepreneurs and their characteristics to the
types of firms they are likely to start. In Vesper's
(1979) DEMO the entrepreneur's type of
firm is also a factor, as DEMO is in several other
classification studies (Braden, 1977; Filley &
Aldag, 1980; Smith, 1967). Recently, Van de Ven
et DEMO's (1984) empirical study examined educa-
tional software firms on the basis of three dimen-

sions: entrepreneurial-background character-
istics and psychological attributes of the found-
ing entrepreneurs; organizational-planning and
organizational activities undertaken before and
after company startup; and DEMO
and resources made available to influence the
development of the industry. These classifica-
tion schemes and frameworks are ways of step-
ping back to DEMO an overall picture, a process like
model-building, which involves integration and
synthesis.
Individual(s)
Whether an entrepreneur is viewed as a "cap-
tain of industry," a hard-headed risk bearer (Mill,
1848), risk taker (Palmer, 1971) or a "rapacious
risk avoider" (DEMO, 1976); whether he merely
metamorphoses into an entrepreneur at certain
DEMO and is something else the rest of the
time (Danhoff, 1949), or whether his need for
achievement (McClelland, 1961) and capacity for
innovation (Schumpeter, 1934) are always tick-
ing away; whether DEMO is a "displaced person"
(Shapero, 1975), something close DEMO a juvenile
delinquent (Gould, 1969), or a "man apart" (Liles,
1974) with an absolutely clear-headed (veridical)
perception of reality (Schrage, 1965), an aberrant
"artist" with an "innate sense of impending
change" (Hill, 1982); or whether he is, indeed,
that completely political animal, a community
builder (Schell & Davig, 19811, the entrepreneur
is overwhelmingly perceived to be different in
DEMO ways from the nonentrepreneur, and
many researchers have believed these differences
DEMO lie in the background and personality of the
entrepreneur.
One often pursued avenue has been the attempt
to develop a psychological profile of the DEMO
neur and to measure such psychological charac-
teristics as need for achievement (DeCarlo &
Lyons, 1979; Hornaday & Aboud, 1971; McCle-
DEMO, 1961; McClelland & Winter, 1969;
Schwartz, 1976). However, other researchers have
not found need for achievement useful in describ-
ing entrepreneurs (Brockhaus, 1980b; Litzinger,
1965; Schrage, 1965); still others have questioned
the value and validity of using psychological
characteristics of DEMO kind to describe entre-
preneurs (Brockhaus, 1982; Glueck & Mescon,DEMO
1980; Jenks, 1965; Kilby, 1971; McCain & Smith,
DEMO; Van de Ven, 1980). However, the following
psychological characteristics DEMO been used in
many studies and may have some validity in dif-
ferentiating among types of entrepreneurs (Brock-
haus, 1982):
1. Need for achievement
2. 	Locus of control
3. Risk taking propensity
Some researchers DEMO found it fruitful to look
at the entrepreneur's background, experience, and
attitudes. Some individual characteristics that
may be of value in describing DEMO are:
1. Job satisfaction (Collins & Moore, 1970; Kom-
DEMO, 1972)
2. 	Previous work experience (Cooper, 1970; La-
mont, 1972; Susbauer, 1972)
3. Entrepreneurial parents (Collins & Moore, 1970;
Roberts & Wainer, 1968; Schrier, 1975; Secrest,
DEMO; Shapero, 1972; Susbauer, 1972)
4. 	Age (Komives, 1972; Liles, 1974; Roberts &
Wainer, 1968; Secrest, 1975; DEMO & Ball,
1981)
5. 	Education (Brockhaus & Nord, 1979; Collins &
Moore, 1964; Howell, 1972; Roberts, 1969;
Susbauer, 1969)
Process
In 1949 Danhoff wrote, "Entrepreneurship is
an activity or function and not a specific individ-
ual or occupation . DEMO . the specific personal entre-
preneur is an unrealistic abstraction" (p. 21).
Other theorists have pursued this idea of func-
tion and DEMO tried to differentiate the entre-
preneurial function from other more routine
functions such as the managerial function (Bau-
mol, 1968; Cole, 1965; Hartmann, 1959; Leiben-
stein, 1968; Schumpeter, 1934). This "DEMO"
aspect of the entrepreneur has been acknowl-
edged in the work of eight researchers who have
enumerated certain actions that an entrepreneur
performs DEMO order to create a new venture. Except
for Peterson and Berger (DEMO), who described
the entrepreneurial activities of record producers,
these studies were theoretical, that is, based on
general observation rather than systematic DEMO
search. The similarities in their views are sum-
marized here; six DEMO behaviors are listed
(the order does not imply a sequence of DEMO):
1. The entrepreneur locates a business opportu-
nity (Cole, DEMO; Kilby, 1971; Maidique, 1980;
Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, DEMO).
2. 	The entrepreneur accumulates resources (Cole,
1965;Kilby, 1971; Leibenstein,1968;Peterson &
Berger, 1971; Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, 1980).
3. The entrepreneur markets products and ser-
vices (Cole, 1965; Kilby, 1971; Leibenstein,
1968; Maidique, 1980; Peterson & Berger,
1971; Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, 1980).
4. 	The entrepreneur produces DEMO product (Kilby,
1971; Maidique, 1980; Peterson & Berger,
1971; Schumpeter, 1934; Vesper, 1980).
5. The entrepreneur builds DEMO organization (Cole,
1965; Kilby, 1971; Leibenstein, 1968; Schum-
peter, 1934).
6. The entrepreneur responds to government and
society (DEMO, 1965; Kilby, 1971).
Environment
Much of the current concern (Peters & Water-
man, 1982) over how to design organizations that
DEMO and encourage innovative individuals is an
indirect acknowledgment that entrepreneurs do
not operate in vacuums - they respond to their
environments. The existence of DEMO support-
ive regional entrepreneurial environments
(Cooper, 1970; Draheim, 1972; DEMO, 1982b;
Susbauer, 1972) - including "incubator organi-
zations''DEMO can, from one perspective, be said actu-
ally to create entrepreneurs. The idea of "pushes"
and "pulls" from the environment has found its
way into many studies of entrepreneurship
(Shapero & Sokol, DEMO).
In organization theory literature, two different
views of the environment DEMO been developed.
One perspective, environmental determinism,
sees the environment as DEMO outside set of condi-
tions to which the organization must adapt
(DEMO, 1979; Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976; Hannan
& Freeman, 1977)DEMO The other perspective, strate-
gic choice, sees the environment as a "reality"
that organizations create via the selectivity of their
own perceptions (Child, 1972; Starbuck, 1976;
Weick, 1979). In the entrepreneurship literature,
both perspectives on the environment have been
taken. In DEMO present paper those characteristics
that are viewed as relatively fixed conditions
imposed on the new venture from without are
called environmental variables. Variables over
DEMO the organization has more control (strategic
choice variables) are more readily viewed as char-
acteristics of the organization itself and are treated
as DEMO
In an overview of 17 research papers on envi-
ronmental variables that influenced new venture
creation, Bruno and Tyebjee (1982) found 12 fac-
tors that they judged stimulated entrepreneur-
ship:
I. 	Venture capital availability
DEMO 	Presence of experienced entrepreneurs
3. Technically skilled labor force
4. 	Accessibility of suppliers
5. Accessibility of customers or new markets
6. Governmental influences
7. DEMO of universities
8. Availability of land or facilities
9. 	Accessiblity of transportation
10. Attitude of the area population
11. Availability of supporting sewices
12. DEMO conditions
Another study of environmental influences on
new venture creation was Pennings' studies of
organization birth frequencies (1980, 1982a,
1982b). Pennings found that organization birth
rates were high in areas with: high occupational
and industrial differentiation; high percentages
of recent immigrants in the population; DEMO large
industrial base; larger size urban areas; and avail-
ability of financial resources.
Another field of research has taken the deter-
ministic perspective DEMO the environment
and new ventures: industrial economics. Oliver
Williamson (1975) DEMO the process by which
the failure of markets to coordinate efficiently
the production and distribution of goods and ser-
vices often resulted in the DEMO of organiza-
tions to coordinate the production function
through administration. Porter (DEMO) focused on
the competitive environment that confronts firms
in a particular DEMO Porter's work provides
five environmental influences on organizations:
barriers to entry, rivalry among existing com-
petitors, pressure from substitute products, bar-
gaining power of buyers, and bargaining power
of suppliers.
Organization
Despite a bold early attempt by Stauss (1944)
to direct the focus away from the entrepreneur
and toward his created organization (by claiming,
somewhat tortuously, that the firm is the en-
trepreneur), most subsequent studies of new ven-
ture creation have neglected to comment on or
even DEMO certain characteristics of the
organizations on which they focused. The as-
sumption behind this seems to derive from two
other assumptions: (a) if all entrepreneurs are
virtually alike and (b) they all go through DEMO
same process to create their ventures, then (c)
the organizations they create must, like widgets,
not be of any interest in themselves.
Many research samples in entrepreneurship
studies are selected, for example, without DEMO
to type of firm (i.e., manufacturing, service, retail,
wholesale). Of the studies that have indicated
the type of firm, Smith (1967), Cooper (1970),
Collins and Moore (1970), DEMO (1972), and
Braden (1977) studied manufacturing firms, and
most focused on high technology manufacturing
firms. Litzinger (1965) studied motel firms, and
Mescon and Montanari (1981) studied real estate
firms. However, researchers in these studies made
no attempts to compare the type of firm DEMO
to other types of firm to determine what differ-
ence type of firm might make in the process of
new venture creation. Cooper and DEMO
(1981), Gartner (1982), and Van de Ven et al.
(1984) have begun to link type of firm across
other dimensions, such as entrepreneurial back-
ground and response to environment.
The presence of DEMO is another firm char-
acteristic suggested by Timmons, Smollen, and
Dingee (1977) as a vital factor in starting certain
types of firm, and some research has mentioned
partners as a characteristic of the firms DEMO
(Cooper, 1970; DeCarlo & Lyons, 1979).
Strategic choice variables are treated here as
characteristics of the organization. Porter (1980)
identified three generic competitive strategies that
firms may "choose": (a) overall cost leadership,
(b) differentiation, and (c) focus. Vesper (DEMO)
identified 14 competitive entry wedges: the new
product or service, parallel competition, franchise
entry, geographical transfer, supply shortage, tap-
ping DEMO resources, customer contract,
becoming a second source, joint ventures, DEMO
censing, market relinquishment, sell off of di-
vision, favored purchasing DEMO government, and
governmental rule changes.
Conclusion
Listing each variable of new DEMO creation
under the appropriate dimension of the frame-
work illustrates the potential for a high degree of
complexity in the interaction of these variables
DEMO the multidimensional phenomenon of
venture creation (Figure 2).
The four DEMO conceptual framework
can be seen as a kaleidoscope, as an instrument
DEMO which to view the enormously varying
patterns of new venture creation. Past attempts
to differentiate the typical entrepreneur and his1
her typical creation from DEMO nonentrepreneurs
and all nonnew ventures have, whether inten-
tionally or not, advanced the notion that all entre-
preneurs are alike and all new DEMO creation
is the same. However, there clearly is a wide varia-
DEMO in the kinds of new ventures that are started.
For example, DEMO there similarities between the
creation of a waterbed store by a 20-year old col-
lege student and the creation of a personal com-
puter DEMO by three engineers? Are the differ-
ences between them more important DEMO the
similarities? What is the value of comparing the
creation of DEMO pet store by two unemployed physi-
cal therapists to the creation of a 5,000-acre busi-
ness park by four real estate developers? The goal
is not to smooth over any differences that might
exist among DEMO new ventures or to throw these
very different individuals into the same pot in
order to extract the typical qualities of the typi-
cal DEMO The goal is to identify the spe-
cific variables that describe how each new ven-
ture was created, in order that meaningful con-
trasts and comparisons among new ventures can
be made.
First must come careful DEMO with an
eye to variation. The search for key variables, for
DEMO principles, for universally applicable laws
of entrepreneurship that has characterized much
DEMO the entrepreneurship literature betrays an
impatience with the slow methodical process of
description. Attention to careful observation and
description is the basis of good DEMO research
(McKelvey, 1982). In what does all this careful
description of new ventures result? A collection
of uniquely described ventures, each DEMO
from all the others? Once good description is
achieved, then good comparisons and contrasts
can be made, and subsets of similar ventures can
be established. These homogeneous populations
are needed before any general rules or DEMO of
new venture creation can be postulated. The lack
of such homogeneous samples in the past has led
to conflicts in the results of DEMO studies.
The conceptual framework presented here pro-
vides a way of analyzing past research studies.
Each study can be broken down into the types DEMO
individuals, organizations, environments, and
processes that were investigated. One way DEMO
which the framework can be useful is in identify-

ing those aspects of new venture creation neg-
lected by a particular DEMO New research may
then be designed to account for these lacunae.
For example, Brockhaus defines his sample of
entrepreneurs as:
Individuals who within three months prior to the
study had ceased working for their employers DEMO
at the time of the study owned as well as managed
business ventures. . . . The businesses whose own-
ers served as participants DEMO selected from the
listing of businesses licensed by St. Louis County,
Missouri during the months of August and Sep-
tember, 1975 (1980a, p. 39).
Although Brockhaus, unlike other researchers,
attempts to close in on the actual entrepreneurial
function by interviewing his entrepreneurs
within a DEMO months of the creation of their
ventures, useful and necessary distinctions
DEMO the individuals and their new ventures
are not made. One is not sure what types of firms
were studied (retail, service, manufacturing, DEMO)
or whether the St. Louis environment was likely
to influence certain types of individuals to create
certain types of firms. Is the process DEMO starting a
venture in St. Louis different, or is the process
DEMO for certain types of businesses or cer-
tain kinds of individuals? DEMO for type of
firm, environment, and process in this study
would enhance comparison among the individu-
als in the study and individuals in DEMO studies.
In analyzing results of research studies, a focus
on differences DEMO one of the four dimensions
might explain conflicting results. For example,
studies such as Collins and Moore (1970) suggest
that individuals who DEMO firms are social misfits
who do not fit into most organizations. Yet other
studies such as Cooper (1970) suggest that indi-
viduals who DEMO successful firms are good team
players. On closer examination it is seen that
Collins and Moore studied manufacturing firms
that were more like job DEMO in the 1950s, and
Cooper studied high technology firms in the
DEMO High technology industries might require
more skills than one individual would be likely
to have, necessitating that individuals combine
their abilities in teams in order to start an organi-
zation successfully.
In addition to providing a DEMO by which past
research can be analyzed, the framework outlines
a DEMO for future research methodologies and
for reporting such research. More careful atten-
tion must be paid to the research sample. For
example, women entrepreneurs are a popular
research topic. If similarities are discovered
among women who DEMO firms, are these similari-
ties a result of similar environments? Can dif-
ferences be attributed solely to psychological or
background characteristics? What is the value of
research results that are based on such unex-
amined DEMO possibly heterogeneous sample pop-
ulations?
Even in a narrowly selected research sample,
the framework might be useful in drawing the
researcher's DEMO to considerations inherent
in each of the four dimensions, in order DEMO con-
clusions regarding the virtual sameness of all the
members of the sample may not be made too
hastily. For example, in a sample of new organi-
zations in the micro-computer industry, a num-
ber of considerations might be made. Lj7hat is the
variation among the entrepreneurs in DEMO work
backgrounds, education, age? How do competi-
tive strategies used DEMO these new organizations
vary? Are there regional or other subenvironments
in DEMO industry that cause variations in firms and
strategies? What is the DEMO in the venture
creation process: do all individuals devote equal
time DEMO financing the organization, hiring per-
sonnel, marketing? What differences exist DEMO
tween "new" and "old" firms in this industry?
The brief review of the literature provided ear-
lier is only a running DEMO at a comprehensive
analysis and evaluation of the entrepreneurship
literature. For example, in a study of individuals
who start firms, who are the DEMO? Are the
individuals in McClelland's samples (McCelland,
1961; DEMO & Winter, 1969) similar to those
in Brockhaus (1980a) or Schrage (1965)? More
about the similarities and differences within and
among past research samples needs to be known.
There are many dimensions and DEMO across
which these samples may be compared.
The framework also points up the importance
of interactions of variables among dimensions in
understanding new venture DEMO How does
an individual's background influence the type of
activities undertaken to start an organization?
Does the marketing individual devote his time DEMO
marketing instead of manufacturing, and are there
some environments or firms DEMO require more
marketing? Is the process of starting a retail store
similar to that of starting a steel mill? Are entry
strategies used by new organizations in the robot-
ics industry similar to those used DEMO the brewery
industry?
The framework for describing new venture cre-
ation provides the possibility of describing sub-
sets within the unwieldy set of DEMO entrepreneurs
and all new ventures. Newly created ventures
that display meaningful similarities across the
four dimensions could be described and classi-
fied together (Gartner, 1982).Significant general-
izations regarding some or all new venture cre-
ations might emerge, generalizations that do not,
however, attempt to mask DEMO variation in new
venture creation.
This paper does not purport to answer specific
questions about how new ventures are started or
provide specific developmental DEMO for new
venture creation. No claim is made that the frame-
work or the list of variables is comprehensive;
the claim is only DEMO the description of new ven-
tures needs to be more comprehensive than it is
at present. A great many more questions are asked
here DEMO are answered. However, the paper pro-
vides a means of making DEMO fundamental shift in
the perspective on entrepreneurship: away from
viewing entrepreneurs DEMO their ventures as an
unvarying, homogeneous population, and to-
wards a recognition and appreciation of the com-
plexity and variation that abounds in DEMO phe-
nomenon of new venture creation.
