Although new venture success is frequently investigated DEMO entrepreneurship,
economics, and psychology, the studies published to date vary widely in their
theoretical basis, study design, and research methodology. Based DEMO organizational life-
cycle theory and interactional personality theory, this longitudinal study DEMO
predictors of venture survival. Of 354 small business owners observed over 8 years,
283 (79.9%) still had active businesses at the end DEMO the observation period. A survey
instrument was developed to measure the relevant characteristics of the
entrepreneurs, their resources, and the environment. Logistic regression DEMO
predicting medium- and long-term business survival included these characteristics and
the interactions between them entered stepwise as blocks. Startup decisions (line of
business, DEMO, and size of planned business) were used as control variables. Much of the
variance is explained by our research model (Nagelkerkes R 2 ¼ :36 for survival at
4 years, and .33 for survival DEMO 8 years). Although long-term business survival is
predicted by the individual variables of startup size and social capital (networks), a
larger part of the variance is explained by environment/resource interactions.
Business survival is DEMO constitutive indicator of business success (Bru¨derl & Schu¨ssler,
1990). DEMO is an expression of the ability to react to (rapidly) changing
environmental conditions in order to ensure that the new business does not DEMO
In the case of startups, various parameters (e.g., R&D DEMO, growth intentions,
etc.) will also cause businesses to reach the break-even point at very different times,
which means that relying on DEMO ﬁnancial parameters makes little sense and would
also lower the return rate due to the unwillingness of many founders to provide such
information. Therefore, the question of why some businesses survive and others do not
is DEMO to the study of entrepreneurship (Cooper, 1993).

Most studies in the ﬁeld focus only on single predictors DEMO success (survival) from an
economic or psychological perspective. Only recently has research on ﬁrm
development examined entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics in relation to their
DEMO and environment (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Integrating an economic
perspective into a psychological study not only brings in alternative predictors of
entrepreneurial DEMO; it also allows us to view personal characteristics in the
context DEMO resources and environmental variables. For both the founder of the business
and its stakeholders, it is important to know as early as possible whether speciﬁc
characteristics of the entrepreneur interact with resources and the environment in
DEMO that can help or hinder later venture survival. For the purpose of investigating
ﬁrm survival, the patterns of predictors and their interactions must also be examined
over relatively long time spans. In order to predict business DEMO at very early
stages of the founding process, a study with DEMO appropriate longitudinal design must
track the development of businesses over at least 5 years. Furthermore, a life-cycle
perspective suggests that medium- and long-term business survival is not one and
the same.
The goal of this paper DEMO to develop and test a model which allows the early
prediction of medium- and long-term business survival with three types of predictors:
the DEMO characteristics of the founder, the resources of the new business and DEMO
environment, as well as the interactions between these dimensions.
Study background
DEMO basis: Interactional personality and organizational life-cycle theories
Starting a new business DEMO a challenging long-term process. Founders must make far-
reaching decisions very early, in a poorly structured environment and at a time when
they may have few resources (Gibb & Ritchie, 1982). At this stage, the personal
characteristics of the founder can be decisive, as one wrong decision could hinder
the survival of the business. Later in the process, the founder’s decisions are made in
an increasingly structured environment. Thus, the role of the founder’s personal
traits changes during the process of business DEMO (Baron & Markman, 2007).
For the purpose of examining the role of personal characteristics in entrepreneurship
from a process perspective, interactional personality and organizational life-cycle
theories best capture the process of entrepreneurial development. These DEMO
are especially well-suited because they address the fundamental conditions
surrounding the startup process: the founder is responsible for gaining adequate
support and resources from the environment in order to ensure the survival of the
business, and such activities involve interactions between the person and the
environment. The establishment DEMO development of a new enterprise is associated
with certain generic problems which change over time. Business age represents
accumulated experience, which leads to business development with distinguishable
phases (Aldrich, 1999).
Interactional personality psychology research (e.g., Mischel, 1968) states that
speciﬁc traits predict behaviour only in relevant situations (Stewart & Barrick, 2004).
Traits are most easily DEMO in congruent situations. Traits are expected to show a
stronger inﬂuence in ‘weak’ situations (i.e., in situations providing few cues) as
compared to ‘strong’ situations (i.e., environmental conditions with strong cues). In
their DEMO meta-analysis, Rauch and Frese (2007) not only conﬁrm the role DEMO

personality characteristics in founding a business, but also in the subsequent
management of the business. They emphasize that future research dealing with DEMO
personal characteristics of entrepreneurs should also address the impact of situational
conditions in the course of the business development process. Unfavourable
environmental conditions (i.e., strong situations) may constrain the role of the
founder’s personality in DEMO decisions (Herron & Robinson, 1993). Favourable
environments (i.e., weak situations) may increase the entrepreneur’s latitude for
decision making and thus expand the role of individual characteristics (Rauch & Frese,
2007). In their meta-analysis of the entrepreneurial personality, Zhao and Seibert (2006)
DEMO suggest a process perspective on entrepreneurship for future research.
Life-cycle theory describes the role of entrepreneurs in different stages of small
business development by DEMO a dynamic perspective on the development of
organizations over time. Over the last few decades, several life-cycle models have been
developed and used to describe the development of small businesses in different phases
over time (e.g., Churchill & Lewis, 1983; LeBrasseur, Zanibbi, & Zinger, 2003; LeBrasseur
& Zinger, 2005; Mount, Zinger, & Forsyth, 1993). Differing in the number, length, and
designation of phases, life-cycle models typically describe a cycle of emergence,
adolescence, and post-adolescence as phases of an organization’s development
(e.g., Churchill & Lewis, 1983; Kazanjian & Drazin, 1990; Lester, Parnell, & Carraher,
2003; Scott & Bruce, 1987).
The ‘liability of newness’ hypothesis (Stinchcombe, 1965) postulates that the
younger the business is, the higher its risk of failure, indicating that the highest ‘liability’
would occur in the emergent phase of a new venture. Particular importance is attributed
to entrepreneurs and their DEMO in this early phase of organizational development.
The organizational environment is structured by the founder’s decisions in this phase.
In contrast, the post-adolescent phase is characterized by relatively stable and
structuring environments, as well as routinization and formalization of processes within
the organization. The importance the founder declines DEMO this part of the organizational
life-cycle.
The ‘liability of newness’ hypothesis has been developed further by the ‘liability of
adolescence’ hypothesis, which suggests that business failures follow an inverted
U-shaped pattern over time (e.g., Bru¨derl & Schu¨ssler, 1990; Fichmann & Levinthal,
1991; Mahmood, 2000). It is assumed that business failure rates are relatively low at the
DEMO for young businesses and then increase and reach a peak after a certain period
of time. This peak depends on the initial resources, but is most often reached after 3–4
years (Bru¨derl & Schu¨ssler, 1990)DEMO After that point businesses stabilize, as is indicated by
continuously falling DEMO rates (Mahmood, 2000). Thus, important differences exist
between medium-term DEMO (the emergent and adolescent phases of the business)
and long-term DEMO (the post-adolescent phase of the business), and analyses should
compare DEMO patterns for these two periods.
When we combine organizational life-cycle considerations and interactional
personality theory, the following picture emerges: the stage of the DEMO may
moderate the role of the founder’s personality (Baron, 2007; DEMO & Markman, 2007).
In the emergent and adolescent stages, the entrepreneur acts in a poorly structured
environment. From the perspective of the DEMO, the ‘liability of newness’ describes a
(weak) situational context of DEMO experiences with few external cues and little inherent
structure. As a result, the personal characteristics of the founder are expected to have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence. These characteristics may further interact with the speciﬁc
demands and resources DEMO the new situation in the emergent and adolescent phases.

On the other hand, the post-adolescent phase is a more structured context with
stronger cues where founders have to react to more DEMO environmental
conditions (e.g., dealing with long-term customers). Thus, we DEMO the founder’s
characteristics to have less impact during this phase.
Hypothesis 1a: The personal characteristics of the founder at the time of foundation predict
medium- and long-term business survival.
Hypothesis 1b: This effect is stronger between t0 and t1 than between t1 and t2.
A successful business startup DEMO the acquisition of resources from the
environment. In the course of the founding process, an entrepreneur needs to arrange
for the necessary environmental support, including ﬁnancial and social capital
(Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986; Davidsson & Honig, 2003). Analyses of environmental
variables from a resource perspective DEMO also be found in population ecology
approaches focusing on the muniﬁcence and ‘carrying capacity’ of the business
founders’ environment (Specht, 1993; Tang, DEMO). The previous job experience of the
founders may have taught them valuable skills and increased their speciﬁc human
capital. Environmental and resource variables DEMO expected to predict business survival
in all organizational life-cycle phases, but DEMO of the increasing environmental
constraints in the post-adolescent life-cycle phase, the DEMO of resources and
environmental factors may increase over time.
Hypothesis 2a: DEMO and environmental factors at the time of foundation predict medium-
and long-term business survival.
Hypothesis 2b: This effect is stronger between t1 and t2 than between t0 and t1.
Most of the longitudinal studies of entrepreneurial DEMO take a universal
approach, only analysing single predictors instead of examining DEMO interaction
effects between theoretically justiﬁed variables (Ginsberg & Venkatraman, 1985).
Based on interactional personality psychology, we expect interaction effects between
personal characteristics and environment and resource variables to have additional
effects in explaining business DEMO (Rauch & Frese, 2007). From the perspective of
contingency theories in management literature (DeCarlo & Lyons, 1980; Dess,
Lumpkin, & Covin, 1997; Ginsberg & Venkatraman, 1985), it could also DEMO argued that
including the interactions between groups of predictor variables will increase the
explained variance, that is, speciﬁc personal characteristics in combination with
DEMO environmental and resource conditions may bring about an increase in
explanatory power.
Hypothesis 3a: Interactions (contingencies) between personal characteristics of the founder
and resources and environmental factors at the time of foundation also predict medium-term
DEMO survival.
Hypothesis 3b: Interactions (contingencies) between personal characteristics of the DEMO
and resources and environmental factors at the time of foundation also predict long-term business
survival.
Based on our theoretical framework, we focus on general contingencies between the
personal characteristics of the founder and his/her resources DEMO environmental factors
at the start of the business activities, thus we DEMO not formulate hypotheses regarding
speciﬁc interaction effects.

Predictors of business survival 1029
Study design and selection of predictors: Previous longitudinal studies
A longitudinal study design was necessary to test these hypotheses. In order to DEMO our
objective of predicting business survival at a very early stage, DEMO required predictors
which had proven important in earlier longitudinal studies focusing on personal
characteristics, resources and environmental predictors, and their impact on business
DEMO Thus, we started with a systematic review of the literature and DEMO
studies which fulﬁl the following criteria:
. Truly longitudinal analyses with a prospective research design of active businesses
at the time of the DEMO longitudinal measurement.
. Quantitative empirical research.
. Studies published between 1986 and 2006 in one of the leading entrepreneurship
journals (Entrepreneurship – Theory and Practice, Journal of Business Venturing,
Small Business Economics, Entrepreneurship and DEMO Development, Journal
of Small Business Management) and/or cited in the PSYCLIT database.
. Research in which data were collected at a minimum DEMO two points in time and with
a minimum of 1 year between measurements.
. Primary data analyses.
. Studies investigating predictors of business survival DEMO predictors of business
growth, including employee and/or sales growth. Studies DEMO business
growth were included because business growth presupposes business survival.
Using these criteria, we were able to identify 17 journal articles. Table 1 lists these
studies in chronological order as well as their key characteristics and DEMO results.
The studies are very heterogeneous. Some examine a representative sample of new
ventures in a country or region, whereas others focus on speciﬁc lines of business.
The observation periods vary from 1 to 19 years, with almost all of the studies falling
within a range of 2–5 DEMO The age of the businesses at the time of the ﬁrst
measurement also differs. In most cases, no speciﬁc reasons are given for the choice of
observation period and age of the business. The studies investigate DEMO wide range
of success predictors and differ in their theoretical backgrounds and study methods.
A universal approach is utilized in most studies, as only the main effects of single
predictors are analysed. This suggests that each DEMO variable has a separate,
additive, independent effect on the dependent DEMO of interest, and that this effect is
not contingent upon or DEMO by the values of any other predictor variable/s (Aiken
& DEMO, 1991). Only a few studies also analyse interactions.
In general, the results of these studies broadly conﬁrm that resources, speciﬁcally
human capital, social capital, ﬁnancial capital, and at least some characteristics of the
entrepreneur (age, gender, and speciﬁc personality factors) are relevant to DEMO survival
of a business. Most of these predictors seem to be relevant to both business survival and
business growth.
Conceptual cornerstones of the study
DEMO of a ‘new venture’
In entrepreneurship research, 6 years of survival DEMO less is a conventional deﬁnition of a
‘new venture’ (Brush & DEMO, 1992; Robinson & McDougall, 2001). In studies
addressing success DEMO for new ventures over time, however, this criterion needs to
be narrowed even further. Therefore, a business could not be older than 18 months at
the time of the baseline measurement in order to be DEMO in our study.

Business survival as the dependent variable
The continued existence of DEMO business, deﬁned as business survival over a certain period
of time, is a fundamental success indicator (Bru¨derl & Preisendo¨rfer, 1998; Bru¨derl &DEMO
Schu¨ssler, 1990). Even though non-survival is not a sign of DEMO failure in every case
and survival is not necessarily a sign of business success, there is a high coincidence
between business survival and business success (Cochran, 1981). Success in business is
often deﬁned as DEMO age and longevity of the business (Ibrahim & Goodwin, 1986).
Deﬁnition of the time frame of business survival
Medium-term survival, that is, surviving the emergent and adolescent phases of the
business, is measured DEMO years after the start of business activities. Long-term survival,
or surviving the post-adolescent phase of the business, is measured approximately
8 years after the start of business activities. Such a long observation period also serves DEMO
compensate for possible differences in the speed of business development between
industry sectors.
Integration of predictors into a conceptual model with a clear theoretical DEMO
All of the studies mentioned above conﬁrm the importance of speciﬁc success
predictors. It may be possible to develop a better model of business DEMO by
combining the single success factors into an integrated model. The conceptual
‘conﬁguration approach’ views ﬁrms as complex entities whose success and
development depend DEMO the interaction between structural, strategic, and external
variables (Dess, Newport, & Rasheed, 1993; Ketchen, Thomas, & Snow, 1993). DEMO
therefore used this approach as frame of reference in developing the model (Korunka,
Frank, Lueger, & Mugler, 2003). As mentioned DEMO, interactional personality and
organizational life-cycle theories form the theoretical basis of DEMO study.
The present study
The Vienna Entrepreneurship Studies
The Vienna Entrepreneurship Studies (VES; e.g., Frank, Korunka, & Lueger, 2007; Frank,
Korunka, Lueger, & Mugler, 2005; Korunka et al., 2003) DEMO a research approach which
differs from typical studies focusing on international comparisons, such as the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (e.g., Minniti, Bygrave, & Autio, 2006) or the Panel Study of
Entrepreneurial Dynamics (e.g., DEMO, Shaver, Carter, & Reynolds, 2004). The VES
began in 1998 with the explicit goal of analysing startup and business success in DEMO
longitudinal research design. They are interdisciplinary and aim to combine a business
management approach based on social science with theories from the ﬁelds of
DEMO and sociology. The frame of reference for the VES is the conﬁguration
approach model proposed by Mugler (1998). His model transposes the conﬁguration
ideas of Miller (1987) – which were originally used to explain DEMO development of larger
enterprises – to small- and medium-sized enterprises. The VES applies Miller’s model to
startups and combines it with Gartner’s (1985) DEMO for describing new venture
creation, leading to the following predictor dimensions: personal characteristics,
startup environment and resources, and startup process.
The study presented here is based on the VES data set. Overall, 373 Austrian small
business owner–managers were observed over a time-span of nearly 8 years. DEMO data

were collected in three waves in the years 1998, 2001, and 2005. Since the sample for
this study consists only of existing businesses, the predictor dimension ‘startup process’
is not included.
Research model and variable selection
The model postulates three blocks of predictors: personal characteristics of the
entrepreneur, resources and environment, and interactions of personal characteristics
with DEMO and environment variables. Medium- and long-term business survival are
differentiated on a timeline. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the conceptual model.
We selected DEMO which had proven to be signiﬁcant in prior longitudinal
studies (see DEMO 1) and systematically assigned them places in the conceptual
framework.
Personal DEMO of the entrepreneur
Based on the assumption in interactional personality theory that speciﬁc traits predict
behaviour only in relevant situations (Stewart & Barrick, DEMO), and unlike three recent
studies on personality as predictors of venture success (which were not yet published
then: Baum & Locke, 2004; Ciavarella, Bucholtz, Riordan, Gatewood, & Stokes, 2004;
Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003), we included the ‘classic’ personality traits found in
DEMO literature at the time when our study was launched: internal locus DEMO
control, need for achievement, and risk taking propensity (Brockhaus & DEMO, 1986;
Chell, Haworth, & Brearley, 1991). A recently published meta-analysis (Rauch & Frese,
2007) conﬁrms that these traits (in addition to newer concepts in entrepreneurial
personality research, such as proactivity) are important for entrepreneurship.
Age and gender are widely accepted as important socio-economic factors related
to venture success and are thus also integrated into DEMO model (e.g., Ahl, 2006;
Hellmann, 2007).

Resources/environment
Our selection of resource/environment variables is also DEMO on the signiﬁcant results
of the longitudinal studies. This selection covers the main aspects of environment-based
approaches in entrepreneurship research (Peterson, 1981), DEMO consider the
environment as a potential provider of resources. The resource-providing function of
the environment is part of the resource dependence approach as well DEMO the population
ecology approach (Aldrich, 1999).
The resources necessary for new venture success are commonly categorized into
human capital, ﬁnancial capital, DEMO social capital (Davidsson & Honig, 2003). These
resource categories are also employed in our model. In addition, we included the aspect
of the ‘push environment’, since this constitutes a speciﬁc environmental condition
which was relevant when the study began and may well regain its importance in DEMO
current economic situation.
Undercapitalization has been identiﬁed as a major cause of slower growth and
poor performance in all phases of business development. Therefore, ﬁnancial capital
is an important resource for successful new venture development (Alsos, Isaksen, &
Ljunggren, 2006). Human capital (productive skills and technical knowledge related to
a speciﬁc work context) and social capital (DEMO business connections within the
social networks of the entrepreneur) are also DEMO and empirically conﬁrmed
resources of successful entrepreneurs (Blanchﬂower & Oswald, 1998; Bosma,
van Praag, Thurik, & de Wit, 2004; Davidsson & Honig, 2003). The general positive
impact of human capital on employee performance has been widely accepted since the
classic study conducted by DEMO (1974). In addition, networks have been empirically
conﬁrmed as characteristics of social capital in entrepreneurship (Bru¨derl &
Preisendo¨rfer, 1998).
In addition to ﬁnancial, human, and social capital aspects, a push environment –
environmental hardships under which future entrepreneurs are forced to start their DEMO
ventures (such as loss of job or previous unemployment) – is well-established as a
(disadvantageous) environmental condition for starting a new venture (Amit & Muller,
1996; Bru¨derl & Preisendo¨rfer, 1998; Korunka et al., 2003).
Control variables
Previous research has shown that the size of a business has an impact on survival rates.
Larger businesses show DEMO survival rates, a fact which can mainly be attributed to
better DEMO Full-time businesses and team startups are also important factors
inﬂuencing business success (Aldrich, Reese, & Dubini, 1989; Bru¨derl & Schu¨ssler,
1990; Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1989). Finally, the startup’s line of business may be
the most important factor inﬂuencing business survival (Storey, 1994).
Method
Sampling strategies
In order to ensure a moderately representative sample of entrepreneurs, we contacted
the support institutions that business owner–managers were likely to visit in various
stages of the startup process. First, entrepreneurs were reached through the staff of
general support institutions. These institutions work DEMO nascent entrepreneurs at the
beginning of the startup process and through explicit stages until the start of business

operations. Also, an address database of new business owner–managers was made
available by ﬁnancial support institutions. These respondents were contacted using a
DEMO survey. Because membership in the Austrian Chamber of Commerce is obligatory

DEMO study are associated with the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, this sampling DEMO
can be expected to ensure sample representativeness, at least in terms DEMO age, gender,
and business type.
The ﬁrst wave of data DEMO (t0) took place in spring 1998 as part of a larger
study on nascent entrepreneurs and young business owner–managers. (for details
regarding the distribution mode, sample characteristics, and return rates, see Korunka
et al., 2003). A comprehensive questionnaire measuring the dimensions of the
conceptual model was distributed with the help of the support organizations (i.e., by
DEMO the questionnaire to their customers) or by mail. Surveys were returned DEMO
postage-paid envelopes. Our sample comprises 627 respondents who had opened their
businesses in the 18 months prior to data collection. Of those respondents, 547
voluntarily included their names and addresses on the questionnaire and agreed to DEMO
contacted in later waves of data collection.
The second wave of data collection (t1) took place in fall 2001. A structured
telephone interview DEMO used to collect information about the state of the businesses.
A total of 456 interviews were completed, making for a response rate of 83%.
The third wave of data collection (t2) took place in fall DEMO Again, the business
owner–managers were contacted by telephone. This time 373 DEMO were
completed, yielding a response rate of 82% compared to t1 DEMO 68% compared to t0.
The missing cases were respondents who could not be found, mainly due to address or
name changes. In a few cases, the business owner–managers no longer wished to
participate in the study.
The analyses only included complete data records (t1 and t2) on DEMO that had
the same owner–manager who responded to the questionnaire at t0. Business transfers
to other owners (3 cases at t1, 19 cases DEMO t2) were excluded from the analyses. As a
result, our sample included 370 data records for t0/t1 analyses (model 1) and DEMO data
records for t0/t2 (model 2) analyses.
Measurements
The questionnaire used for data collection at t0 consisted of items and scales measuring
DEMO of the entrepreneur, resources, environment, and control variables (see
Table 2). The control variables (full-time business, team startup, startup size, line of
business) were measured using single items. Internal locus of DEMO, need for
achievement and risk taking propensity were measured with scales DEMO used in German-
speaking countries (Frese, 1998; Krampen, 1991; DEMO, 1977). Financial capital, the
existence of family role models, DEMO the push environment were measured using single
items. For human capital and networks, scales were developed speciﬁcally for this study.
All multi-item scales were transformed into a similar range of values (0–100).
Table 2 provides information about the scales and their statistical characteristics.
All scales show at DEMO acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha between .68
and .82; see Table 2).
Business survival was measured by asking business owners about the DEMO of their
ventures. Thus, the target variable is de facto objectively DEMO Business survival
includes a wide variety of business development patterns, ranging DEMO survival despite

Statistical analyses
As we conceptually separated medium- and DEMO business survival, the hypotheses
were tested by three separate logistic regression DEMO using medium-term (model 1:
t0/t1) and long-term (model DEMO: t0/t2 and model 3: t1/t2) business survival as DEMO
variables. Based on the conceptual model, in the ﬁrst step the DEMO variables were
entered en bloc in the logistic regression analyses, followed DEMO a block of personal
variables and a block of resource and environment variables. The interaction variables
(person £ resources=environment) were included as a DEMO block in the analyses.
For the purpose of testing Hypotheses 1b and 2b, we compared the two respective
logistic regression models (models 1 DEMO 3) by calculating the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC, Raftery, 1995).
Results
Based on the available indicators (line of business, startup DEMO/ﬁnancial capital, gender,
and age of the small business owner–manager), the sample is representative of Austrian
small businesses (see Schwarz & DEMO, 2003).

The full model explains a large portion of the variance DEMO the target variable
(Nagelkerkes R 2 ¼ :36). None of the control variables signiﬁcantly explain medium-
term business survival. The only signiﬁcant DEMO characteristic is a high risk taking
propensity, which decreases the chances DEMO survival. No signiﬁcant effects are found for
resources and the environment. Interactions between personal characteristics and
resource and environment variables explain the largest part DEMO variance.
In summarizing the results of model 1 (medium-term business survival), Hypothesis 1a
(part 1), and Hypothesis 3a can be conﬁrmed. DEMO 2a (part 1) must be rejected.
A closer look at the signiﬁcant interactions between the personal characteristics of
the entrepreneur and the resource DEMO environment variables reveals some especially
disadvantageous combinations: a high risk taking DEMO combined with low
business-speciﬁc human capital, female business owner–managers acting in DEMO push
environment, and younger entrepreneurs founding a business with little ﬁnancial DEMO
lead to signiﬁcantly reduced medium-term business survival rates.
Models 2 and 3: Long-term business survival (t2/t0 and t2/t1)
A t2, 283 of 354 businesses (79.9%) had survived. Table 6 shows the DEMO results of the
logistic regression analysis using survival at t2 as the dependent variable.
Again, a large amount of the variance in the target variable is explained by the full
model (Nagelkerke R 2 ¼ :DEMO), but the ﬁndings differ. Startup size has a positive effect on
long-term business survival, that is, larger businesses show better survival rates.
DEMO characteristics are not found to have signiﬁcant effects. Resources have a
signiﬁcant effect in that the existence of networks in the nascent business phase DEMO a
positive impact on long-term business survival. Again, the largest part DEMO the variance in
the target variable is explained by interaction patterns between personal characteristics
and the resource and environment factors. As in model 1, female entrepreneurs acting in
a push environment and the combination of high DEMO taking propensity and low human
capital reduced the businesses’ chances of long-term survival.
The second part of Hypothesis 1a must be rejected, whereas the second part of
Hypothesis 2a could be conﬁrmed. Hypothesis 3b could also DEMO conﬁrmed.
In order to test Hypotheses 1b and 2b, model 3 (t2/t1) was calculated (Table 7).
Next, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for the person and resources/
environment blocks in DEMO of the two (non-nested) models (models 1 and 3) was
calculated. Following Raftery (1995), a BIC difference of 6–10 provides strong evidence
and a BIC difference above 10 provides very strong evidence that DEMO model with the
lowest BIC value yields the best ﬁt. For the personal characteristics block, the BIC of
model 1 is 536.8 and the BIC of model 3 is 475.1 indicating that model 3 exhibits better
DEMO As a result, Hypothesis 1b must be rejected. For the resources/DEMO
variables, the BIC of model 1 is 283.4 as compared to DEMO for model 3. Thus,
Hypothesis 2b can be conﬁrmed.

Predictors of business survival

Ciavarella et al., 2004). Based on a contingency model anchored in organizational
life-cycle and interactional personality theories, we expected characteristics of the
entrepreneur, resources, and environmental factors (measured in an early stage of the
founding process), and interactions between these variables to predict DEMO and long-
term business survival. We were able to fully conﬁrm three study hypotheses and partly
conﬁrm two study hypotheses. It was shown that DEMO characteristics, resources, and
environmental aspects at the start of business activities explain only a relatively small part
of the variance in business survival. DEMO interactions between these predictors
signiﬁcantly improves the explained variance. As a result, our data indicate that an early
assessment of the chances of business survival is possible at least to a certain extent. The
most important DEMO of long-term business survival is ﬁnancial capital at the start of
business activities (i.e., business size). Larger businesses have substantially higher long-
DEMO survival (‘liability of smallness’, Bru¨derl & Schu¨ssler, 1990).
Combining DEMO life-cycle theory and interactional personality theory, our
paper focuses on the DEMO effects of the predictor dimensions (personal
characteristics and environment/resources). DEMO results of the study conﬁrm at least
partly an interactional personality approach (Stewart & Barrick, 2004), since a
signiﬁcant effect of a DEMO characteristic was found only in the – comparable weak –
situation of medium-term survival, about 3–4 years after the baseline measure.
An enhanced risk taking propensity seems to have negative effects in the ﬁrst years of
DEMO development, where strong cues from a stabilized environment (i.e., regular
DEMO stable customer relationships) are missing. Although the literature provides
evidence of DEMO as well as negative associations between risk taking and
performance (Wiseman & Catanach, 1997), our ﬁnding of a negative effect is in DEMO with
other studies in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship (Naldi, Nordqvist, DEMO, & Wiklund,
2007; Wiseman & Bromiley, 1996).
Furthermore, the combination of a heightened risk taking propensity with low
human capital DEMO to be especially disadvantageous for medium-term business
survival. Increased risk taking propensity combined with a lack of knowledge and
experience does not lead to DEMO business decisions and can cause early
business failure.
Based on organizational life-cycle theory, it was expected that the inﬂuence of
personal characteristics (measured DEMO t0) on business survival disappear over time while
the inﬂuence of DEMO and environment factors increase over time and interactions
between personal characteristics and resources/environment factors inﬂuence medium-
and long-term survival in an analogous manner. DEMO results partly conﬁrm these
expectations: although personal characteristics did not signiﬁcantly DEMO long-term
business survival, based on the differences in BIC values between DEMO two models 1 and
3 Hypothesis 1b had to be rejected. On the other hand, the resources/environment
dimension was not only signiﬁcant in explaining long-term survival and not signiﬁcant
in explaining medium-term survival, the BIC value comparison also conﬁrmed
Hypothesis 2b.
One reason for these results could DEMO that our adapted life-cycle model imposes a
standardized deﬁnition of life-cycle phases. Such a deﬁnition could oversimplify
organizational patterns because ﬁrms sometimes fail to DEMO the common life-cycle
progression (Miller & Friesen, 1984). For instance, Dodge, Fullerton, and Robbins
(1994) found that the level of competition faced by ﬁrms in their environment was more
important for business DEMO than their speciﬁc life-cycle. In a similar vein, Aldrich
(1999) DEMO his evolutionary understanding of business development, places an

Christian Korunka et al.
interactional perspective over a life-cycle approach when he argues that DEMO
organization’s trajectory of development results from the interplay of its actions with
environmental resources and constraints’ (Aldrich, 1999, p. 200). This implies that
businesses probably do not encounter similar generic problems but have speciﬁc
DEMO which differ from business to business. It is therefore not age of business but
the ﬁrm speciﬁc learning experiences with problems encountered that should DEMO
addressed in more detail in future research.
Two other speciﬁc interaction effects which signiﬁcantly explain medium-term
survival were observed: the signiﬁcant interaction between female entrepreneurs and a
push environment is presumably rooted in traditional gender roles. DEMO not only
experience more severe work/family conﬂicts (e.g., Butler & Skattebo, 2004), they are
also impeded by unfavourable ﬁnancial resources when starting their businesses (Alsos
et al., 2006). When these gender DEMO coincide with a push environment (for
example, the unexpected termination of an employment contract), the unfavourable
conditions are exacerbated. The signiﬁcant interaction DEMO age and ﬁnancial
resources may be interpreted in a similar vein. Older business founders often have more
options when it comes to compensating for DEMO in ﬁnancial resources. On the other
hand, due to a lack DEMO private ﬁnancial resources, it may be more difﬁcult for younger
business DEMO to obtain external ﬁnancing and secure the necessary ﬁnancial
support for their ventures.
In general, business survival is partly explained by the characteristics of the venture
and interactions between the founder’s characteristics, business resources and the
environment. Resources and environmental variables have a signiﬁcant effect on long-
term DEMO survival. The early formation of business networks has a bridging function
to the environment and may attenuate unfavourable environmental inﬂuences on
business development, thus having a positive effect on survival (Davidsson & Honig,
2003; DEMO, 2000). Our results indicate that business networks will mainly show
DEMO positive effects in the long run, afﬁrming the ﬁndings of the DEMO longitudinal
studies with similar observation periods (Baum & Locke, 2004; DEMO & McMullan,
2004; Ciavarella et al., 2004) and our DEMO studies (Frank et al., 2007; Korunka, Frank,
& Lueger, 2004).
Strengths and weaknesses of the study approach
With regard to key variables (line of business, business size, age, and gender DEMO the
business owner–manager), the sample is representative of new ventures in Austria.
Compared to the longitudinal studies with a similar time frame (Baum & Locke, 2004;
Chrisman & McMullan, 2004; Ciavarella et al., 2004), the sample size and return rate of
our study are high.
Although we experienced some sample attrition, the distribution of the key variables
(line of business, business size, age, and gender of DEMO business owner–manager) in the
t1/t2 samples is similar to the DEMO sample, indicating that no systematic bias is likely.
Moreover, a comparison with the full t0 sample did not reveal any differences. However,
DEMO positive survival bias that does not affect the distribution of the key variables may be
possible. When comparing the characteristics for the businesses which DEMO not survive
at t1 and/or t2 and the businesses lost from the sample at t1 and/or t2, we found no
statistical differences. Most likely, some of the lost cases were businesses that failed or
closed down, which suggests that the observed survival rates may be overestimated.

Predictors of business survival

As this is a longitudinal ﬁeld study, further possible threats to internal validity (Cook
& Campbell, 1979) should also be considered carefully. The measurement of business
survival by means of telephone interviews at DEMO and t2 is not inﬂuenced by memory
distortions. In addition, considering DEMO these measures are objective indicators (i.e.,
they are not affected DEMO the entrepreneurs’ subjective perceptions), the levels of
explained variance are relatively high (Frese & Zapf, 1988). However, the predictor
variables are largely based on self-evaluations, potentially creating an overestimation
bias as respondents may have exaggerated their achievements or otherwise provided
socially desirable answers.
Implications for DEMO and practice
Our approach could be developed further by including speciﬁc personal characteristics
that have been conﬁrmed in the context of leadership and could DEMO transferred into the
ﬁeld of entrepreneurship (Baum & Locke, 2004; DEMO, Locke, & Smith, 2001). Speciﬁc
traits such as innovativeness, stress tolerance, and the need for autonomy, which were
conﬁrmed in DEMO meta-analysis by Rauch and Frese (2007), should also be included DEMO
further longitudinal studies. The measurement of resources could also be improved.
In addition, speciﬁc interactions between personal characteristics and resources/
environment aspects should also be deﬁned and tested.
This study has also shown that a DEMO approach is superior to a universal
approach in predicting business survival. The next logical step – which is already
implicit in our approach of DEMO predictors along conﬁgurational dimensions –
would be a full conﬁguration analysis. Statistically, this could be realized by including
three-way interactions as an additional block in regression analyses (Wiklund &
Shepherd, 2005). However, such DEMO analysis would dramatically increase the number of
predictors, which would in DEMO require (unrealistically) large sample sizes and
complicate the presentation and interpretation of results considerably.
Future studies based on organizational life-cycle theory in the DEMO of entrepreneur-
ship may be improved by replacing a rigid chronological phase model with an adaptive
model based on evaluating the individual development processes DEMO observed ventures
(Miller & Friesen, 1984). Such an adaptive model approach might lead to a better ﬁt for
life-cycle developments in speciﬁc DEMO sectors and thus improve explanatory
power in evaluating the chances of business survival.
In practical terms, our study shows the potential and limitations of early diagnoses of
business survival. A simple measurement tool (i.e., a DEMO questionnaire) which
could be used as a basis for early forecasts DEMO success explains a good part of the variance
in long-term business survival. As a result, it is possible to develop a simple and reliable
‘early warning system’ for potential business failures. When speciﬁc unfavourable
combinations are DEMO (e.g., female founders in a push environment, younger founders
with DEMO resources), a startup assistance programme tailored to the needs of these
speciﬁc groups could be beneﬁcial.
