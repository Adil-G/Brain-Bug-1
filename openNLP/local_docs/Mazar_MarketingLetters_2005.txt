Abstract
DEMO has typically been the social science of choice to inform public policy and policymakers. In the current
paper we contemplate the role behavioral science DEMO play in enlightening policymakers. In particular, we provide
some examples of DEMO that has and can be used to inform policy, reﬂect on DEMO kind of behavioral science that
is important for policy, and approaches DEMO convincing policy-makers to listen to behavioral scientists. We suggest
that policymakers are unlikely to invest the time translating behavioral research into its policy implications, and
researchers interested in inﬂuencing public policy must therefore invest substantial effort, and direct that effort
differently than in standard research practices.

Keywords: public policy, psychology, behavioral economics
Imagine waking up one morning, turning on the radio and hearing on the NPR news that
the president of the US has issued the following DEMO:
“After consulting my chief psychologist, I am conﬁdent that the DEMO proposed
in the new well-being policy will increase happiness by 34% at almost no cost.”
Although this statement is unlikely to be uttered by DEMO publicly elected ofﬁcial during
our lifetime, this type of statement represents DEMO hope that psychologists and behavioral
economists will one day become more central and substantive contributors to public policy.
Our hope is motivated by two DEMO First, the past two centuries the study of human
behavior has DEMO many important and counterintuitive insights. Second, despite this
accumulating knowledge of DEMO nature and behavior, these ﬁndings rarely ﬁnd their way
to one DEMO their most important potential applications—public policy.
The failure of psychology and behavioral science more generally to inﬂuence public
policy is particularly painful and frustrating DEMO light of the success of its sibling, economics,
as the DEMO for policy recommendations. It is not that economics has nothing to offer
policy—economics indeed provides policy-makers with vital tools. Rather, the success of
economics clearly demonstrates that policy-makers are willing to look to academic ﬁelds
for DEMO in setting their policies. Given this general willingness to accept advice, DEMO is
unfortunate that behavioral scientists are not providing their own perspectives. One striking
example of this failure involves one of the most famous experiments DEMO social science—
Zimbardo’s Stanford prison experiment (1971). Every undergraduate student DEMO psychology
knows of the terrifying behaviors of the participants in this experiment. Yet, the simple link
from these results to the military and civilian penal system has yet to be made. The painful
consequences of not DEMO so are abundantly clear.
Another frustrating aspect regarding the role of psychology in policy is that economics in
general, and its application to public policy in particular, is tightly linked to psychology—
considering and predicting how people will change their behavior as a consequence of
policy or incentive DEMO inherently involves psychology. Although it is easy to see that
economics is at its core a psychological science, it is also easy to see that it is based on
na¨ıve psychology that has not always stood DEMO to empirical scrutiny. From this perspective,
psychologists may play a larger role in public policy by helping economics develop more
valid assumptions and DEMO for the science that would underlie policy in the future.
In this paper we review some examples that illustrate the importance of using more
DEMO psychological assumptions in policy, and consider the possible ways to increase
DEMO impact of behavioral research on public policy by outlining the hurdles and possible
avenues of such inﬂuence.
Example 1: Savings
In the face of continuously declining savings rates in the US, economic research has been
emphasizing the importance of retirement savings programs to the future welfare of workers
PSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY
445
(Ando and Modigliani, DEMO). Perhaps as a consequence of this emphasis, many savings
plans DEMO today aim to enable people to act upon their best interests and save money for
their retirement period. The troubling ﬁnding, however, is DEMO despite the obvious economic
beneﬁt of saving for retirement too many employees without deﬁned beneﬁts type of pension
plans do not save nearly enough DEMO their future (Benartzi and Thaler, 2004).
One explanation of why retirement savings are so low is that people understand the value
of DEMO but that they simply prefer to spend their money rather than save. In contrast,
behavioral scientists point out that many retirement savings programs DEMO unrealistic as-
sumptions about the mental capabilities of the people facing retirement decisions. Empirical
evidence makes it clear that low savings rates are at DEMO partly produced by the complexity
in choosing between different savings options (DEMO et al., 2003), the substantial im-
pact of defaults in DEMO making (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988), the greater impact
of losses relative to gains (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), and the intertemporal DEMO
between the costs and beneﬁts of the decision (Thaler and Shefrin, 1981).
Understanding some of these behavioral antecedents to individuals’ poor decision DEMO
led Benartzi and Thaler (2004) to the creation of an innovative savings policy called “Save
More Tomorrow”—a policy that explicitly builds on the DEMO irrational aspects of
human decision making rather than assuming them away. In this program individuals are
asked to commit to a future saving that DEMO be taken out of an upcoming raise. People
may opt out of this program, but the default is to stay enrolled and continue increasing one’s
savings out of future raises. This program therefore capitalizes on people’s DEMO to care
about the present more than the future (i.e., temporal discounting), to select default options
when making decisions (i.e., the DEMO quo bias), and to adapt to their current circumstances
(i.e., adaptation).
Example 2: Fertilizers
A second example of the importance of behavioral understandings in overcoming individual
shortcomings is based on recent experimental evidence DEMO the usage of fertilizers in Africa
(Duﬂo et al., 2005). In this work the authors examined why poor farmers in Western Kenya
DEMO to use beneﬁcial fertilizers on their crops. The results of multiple controlled experiments
showed that fertilizers were effective in increasing the yield of the DEMO, and that they could
dramatically increase the wealth of the farmers. DEMO the same time, even the farmers that were
educated about these DEMO with actual demonstrations did not systematically utilize these
fertilizers. Duﬂo et al. (2005) demonstrated that the main reason for this “irrational behavior”
was DEMO farmer’s inability to save the income necessary to purchase these fertilizers. The
farming environment in Western Kenya is such that the sellers of the DEMO approached
the farmers toward the beginning of the season when the fertilizers would be most effective.
This also happens to be the time furthest DEMO the harvest season, when the farmers had the
least amount of DEMO
Once Duﬂo et al. (2005) identiﬁed savings as the main barrier to usage, they designed a
new payment timing for fertilizers and with prepayment were able to dramatically increase
the usage of fertilizers. Further increases DEMO the adoption of fertilizers were achieved by
coupling the initial sale of the crop and the purchasing of the fertilizers.

Example 3: Police Lineups
A third example of the importance of understanding the ways in which people make deci-
sions DEMO police lineups. Police lineups in most places constitute of a witness attempt-
ing to recognize one person in a group of potential suspects standing DEMO to each other in
a line (hence the name). Although DEMO lineups are popular, accumulating evidence shows
that they suffer from the DEMO possibility of false recognition—mistakenly identifying
an innocent person as the perpetrator. Using insights about how individuals form judgments,
Gary Wells and colleagues recently DEMO an improvement to the lineup system whereby
suspects would be evaluated sequentially versus simultaneously (Turtle et al., 2003; Wells
et al., 2000)DEMO In a telling example, Lindsay and Wells (1985) convincingly showed DEMO the
probability of a false recognition of an innocent suspect is reduced dramatically when the
presentation mechanisms changes. Instead of the common practice of DEMO multiple
individuals simultaneously (which creates a tendency to identify one of DEMO people as the
suspect), a better approach is to present the individuals one at a time, making sequential
identiﬁcation judgments. This improved methodology is already being used in Ontario and
New Jersey.
What Kind of DEMO Science is Important for Policy?
As the examples above illustrate, DEMO principle it is clear that behavioral science has important
implications for public policy. What is less clear is what kind of behavioral science is DEMO
suited to inform public policy. If the kind of behavioral science that is ideal for policy-making
were different from the behavioral science commonly practiced, how would it need to be
changed in order to better ﬁt DEMO role? In this section we explore how research that informs
public DEMO might be different from the behavioral science as it is usually practiced.
Distinction 1: Vaguely Correct or Precisely Wrong?
The distinction between a theoretical and an applied science is particularly important as
it becomes clearer DEMO the accurate answer to many of the questions concerning how
people behave in certain situations is “it depends.” In fact, as more knowledge about human
behavior accumulates, it becomes evident that situational factors have tremendous impact
on the action of the individual, even seemingly minor situational factors. These situational
factors include the framing of a stimulus (Tversky and Kahneman, DEMO), the relative
attribute value of alternatives in a choice set (DEMO et al., 1982; Simonson, 1989), the type
of response DEMO (Tversky et al., 1988), the number of alternatives provided (DEMO
and Lepper, 2000) or implied (Amir and Ariely, 2004), the temporal nature of the decision
(Laibson, 1997), the emotional DEMO of the decision (Loewenstein et al., 2001; Slovic
et al., 2002; Slovic et al., 2002), the order in which the DEMO are presented (Russo
et al., 1996), and a host of other factors too long to list. Under this “it depends” state of DEMO
world, behavioral scientists are unable to provide policy makers with unqualiﬁed DEMO
to their questions. Yet this is exactly the input that policy-makers need most in order to
PSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY
447
better craft policy. Here DEMO scientists face a difﬁcult tradeoff between providing
an accurate and vague answer that offers no clear recommendations, or an inaccurate and
precise answer that offers a clear policy and might bring about at least some change.
DEMO 2: Theoretical or Applied Research?
A related distinction is whether DEMO best role behavioral scientists could play in the policy
arena is to search for general principles or to concoct exact recipes for how to DEMO
speciﬁc policy issues. Despite Kurt Lewin’s claim that “There is nothing so useful as
a good theory,” and James Maxwell’s claim that “There DEMO nothing more practical than
a good theory,” there is still a large gap between ﬁnding general principles and using
those principles to prescribe DEMO policies. Although theories and general principles
are clearly useful, it is DEMO clear that policymakers themselves are not going to conduct
the research needed to translate these general constructs into speciﬁc policies. Behavioral
scientists who want DEMO work so translated will need to do that work themselves to bridge
the gap between theoretical and applied settings. Taking these extra steps means DEMO only
doing more applied work, but also becoming an expert in DEMO particular policy domains
(savings, healthcare, taxes, education, police lineups, etc.). Without such expertise, the
researcher might not be able to understand important situational nuances (legal limitations,
all affected parties, long-term DEMO, etc.) and may therefore conduct research that
would miss some of the central aspects of the applied domain. Finally, it is na¨ıve to expect
policymakers to read academic journals, and the applied research should be disseminated in
channels that are easily accessed by policymakers—including the popular press DEMO personal
communications.
Distinction 3: What Technology to Use?
A ﬁnal DEMO involves the experimental materials used in research. From a scientiﬁc
perspective, DEMO is almost always better to pick stimuli that would allow the researcher to
directly and unambiguously attribute the effects to the theoretical construct. To DEMO this
goal, scientiﬁc experiments often utilize artiﬁcal stimuli that are uncommon DEMO nonexistent in
everyday life. For example, the use of simple gambles DEMO the form win $x with probability
y has been instrumental in exploring decision making under uncertainty, but is clearly
more abstract than any of the probabilistic decisions people encounter in their daily lives.
Decisions regarding investment DEMO, insurance policies, and lottery tickets are carried
out in somewhat different environments than simple gambles. As a consequence, decisions
about these classes of stimuli have the potential to play out very differently. To make research
DEMO behavioral science more applicable, the stimuli used should reﬂect the richness DEMO the
environment they are meant to represent. Such selection of stimuli will increase the ability
to generalize results to the setting of the policy, and increase the face validity of experiments
making it easier to “sell” DEMO to policymakers. One downside of more realistic stimuli is
that they often simultaneously manipulate multiple factors, making the causal inferences
so central to science harder to make.

Some Possible Directions for Behavioral Policy Research
In DEMO section we would like to point out a few possible directions for policy-oriented
behavioral research. Before discussing such possible directions it is important to DEMO a
few comments about paternalism. To the extent that behavioral research on policy is suc-
cessful, policy-makers will be equipped with tools to increase the effectiveness of policies.
For example, behavioral research might help create policies that would increase savings,
decrease drunk driving, inhibit violence and aggressions, or increase the duration of mar-
riages. Although behavioral research is likely to make such policies more effective, it is still
not clear that the government should implement them. The question of paternalism, control,
and manipulation of the citizens is a complex and delicate issue that is DEMO the scope
of the current discussion—yet at the same time, the DEMO of paternalism is central to
the issue of research into policy because any successful research could potentially increase
paternalism. Individuals who have strong anti-paternalistic DEMO may decide at this point
that they do not want to increase the potential for paternalism and hence do not want to
take part DEMO any research related to policy. This perspective is understandable, but it DEMO worth
pointing out that policies uninformed by scientiﬁc research are no less paternalistic; they are
simply likely to be less effective. To illustrate, DEMO a hypothetical policy that involves
framing of taxation changes as either gains or losses. The use of such framing may invoke
the notions of DEMO interventions, but it is important to note that with or without
DEMO to use framing, and with or without the knowledge of their DEMO, framing
is inherent. The question therefore is not whether to have DEMO or not, but rather whether
it should be considered as a DEMO of the policy or be allowed to be determined outside of the
control of the policy making process. Finally, it is important to note that in many cases it is
not a question of whether a DEMO should be implemented or not, but rather how a policy
should DEMO implemented. Paternalism is obviously a lesser issue in these cases.
Returning to the question of possible directions for behavioral policy research, a beautiful
example of research that is highly related to a policy question is the DEMO on the effects of
defaults of organ donations (Johnson and Goldstein, 2003), showing that the proportion of
people who have organ donor DEMO is over 90% in countries where the default is donation
(and DEMO have to opt out if they don’t want to be a donor), while the proportion of people
who have organ donor status is DEMO 20% in countries where the default is non-donation
(and people have DEMO opt in if they want to be a donor). There are many other cases in which
the power of defaults can be harnessed DEMO do good—it can be used to help people contribute
to their 401K plans, to their Roth accounts, to enroll people in healthcare, gyms, etc. (again
with all the problems related to paternalism).
A DEMO example of research that might be highly applicable to policy questions is the
research on context effects such as the asymmetric dominance effect (Huber et al., 1982),
and the compromise effect (Simonson and Tversky, 1992). The work looking at context
effects has repeatedly demonstrated that the alternatives provided in the choice set, even
if they are not chosen, can have substantial effects on the options that are chosen. In the
domain of policy, these effects could be used to inﬂuence the choices individuals make
on a range of topics from healthcare plans, to the selection of public ofﬁcials, and even to
convince people that they are not paying much income tax.
PSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY
449
A third example could DEMO based on anchoring (Kahneman and Tversky, 1974; Epley
and Gilovich, 2001). It has been repeatedly demonstrated that asking people to answer DEMO
question about their willingness to pay (for example: would you pay an amount equal to
the last two digits of your social security DEMO for this box of chocolate), can have a
substantial effect on their true willingness to pay for the good when elicited later using
DEMO incentive compatible procedure. In the policy domain, anchoring can be used DEMO “help”
people contribute more to charity, increase their savings, etc.
An example that is perhaps more far fetched relates to Duval and Wicklund’s (1972)
notion of objective self-awareness. The idea is that when attention DEMO directed toward oneself
that induces self-evaluation in relation to standards salient or accessible in the immediate
situation, which in turn increases motivation to meet the standard (see also (Carver and
Scheier, 1998). One ﬁnding within this framework has shown that when students sign
an honor code, or when they are simply asked to recall the ten commandments, they are
less likely to cheat on a test relative to a control DEMO Moreover, this effect persists even
when the performance on the test DEMO real ﬁnancial consequences (Mazar et al., 2005). Using
related devices such as awareness, recall, or honor code signatures to increase self-awareness
DEMO have far reaching implications. One could easily imagine applying this principle to
driving (reducing the tendency not to obey trafﬁc rules), to personal tax returns (decreasing
tax evasion), and to dishonesty at the workplace. For example, asking individuals to sign their
tax returns forms at the beginning rather than the end might increase their self-awareness
and decrease deception.
DEMO example of an application of a well-documented result to the domain of policy
involves an examination of the framing of tax reduction on spending. DEMO a recent paper, Epley
et al. (2004) examined why the DEMO of the 2002 tax return on the economy was smaller than
anticipated. Based on a series of experiments the authors conclude that if the DEMO reduction
had been framed as a “bonus” rather than a “rebate,” people would have spent signiﬁcantly
more of it. More generally, framing can be used in many situations ranging from framing
the propositions citizens vote DEMO during election times, to Medicare prescription options,
and even to DEMO question of how to trade-off personal freedom for security.
A ﬁnal example of an application of established results relate to the “hot cold empathy
DEMO (Loewenstein, 1996). This work has demonstrated that when people are in a “cold”
and non-emotional state, they are unable to accurately predict how they themselves would
behave if they were in a “hot” emotional DEMO Drawing on personal experience, it is
commonly observed that people who DEMO food shopping while hungry usually buy too much
food, and moreover DEMO they do not seem to learn from their past experiences. A more
controlled examination of this idea was provided by Ariely and Loewenstein (forthcoming)
where they asked subjects to indicate the likelihood that when aroused DEMO will have safe
sex, and the likelihood that when aroused they DEMO behave themselves immorally in order
to secure sexual gratiﬁcation. The male respondents who answered these questions in a
cold state indicated that they were DEMO to take risks of unprotected sex and that they
would not engage in morally questionable behavior in order to obtain sexual gratiﬁcation.
On the DEMO hand, when sexually roused, the same participants gave dramatically different
responses. Indicating that they would take risks of unprotected sex and engage in DEMO
questionable behavior in order to obtain sexual gratiﬁcation. Such changes of preferences
450
AMIR ET AL.
in the “heat of the moment” coupled with DEMO intra-personal empathy gap (the inability
to fully predict these changes) can have substantial implications for our understanding of
the causes of undesirable behaviors DEMO as crime of passion, date-rapes, and unprotected
sex, and hence DEMO educate policies that are designed to curb such behaviors. For example,
understanding the effects of preferences in the “heat of the moment” should DEMO what
behaviors sex offenders are instructed to avoid, and how sexual DEMO in high schools is
designed.
In summary, there are many aspects DEMO research that could be applicable to policy and
policymaking. In seeking where to start, one approach is to look for research directions
that are likely to create the lowest levels of resistance and opposition from policymakers
DEMO their constituents. One type of interventions that are likely to result in little resistance
is one that in general, people don’t believe would have any effect on behavior. We term
these research directions “small interventions,” DEMO bundle under this title all the possible
effects that lay people, DEMO all of those who are not familiar with the behavioral
literature, DEMO predict not to have any effects on behavior. There is a long list of such
“small interventions,” including most of the ﬁndings noted DEMO this section. For example,
the data suggest that participants in anchoring experiments don’t believe that answering a
hypothetical question about their willingness to DEMO can actually change their willingness
to pay. Anchoring and other interventions that have the feature of unaware-effectiveness
would be therefore classiﬁed under the “small DEMO category. We reason that if
policy makers predict that changes of the small interventions type will lead to no or small
effects, or if they predict that others will predict a low effectiveness they would be DEMO
likely to embrace such policy-mechanisms.
Some Possible Approaches to Get Policy-Makers to Listen
Perhaps more difﬁcult than identifying relevant policy application from behavioral science
DEMO, however, is convincing policy makers to seek the advice of behavioral scientists and
to take this advice seriously. The ﬁrst approach we would DEMO to promote is the grassroots
approach. The idea here is that instead of hoping that someone in Washington DC will
read research papers in DEMO science or invite researchers to provide advice on policy
issues, a DEMO way might be to start at local communities. Starting at the communities
researchers live in has the advantages that they know the environment better, are closer
geographically, the stakes are lower (which should make it DEMO to try something new),
and hopefully the bureaucracy is less DEMO, generating lower hurdles for implementation.
Moreover, to the extent that a change in local policy is successful it could be spread by people
DEMO are using this policy in their day-to-day lives. One example of a successful grassroots
approach is the abovementioned change to the policy of police DEMO promoted by Gary
Wells and colleagues (Turtle et al., 2003; DEMO et al., 2000). Using the grassroots approach,
researchers related DEMO this project were individually involved in educating policemen and
judges about their ﬁndings. Consequently, improved policy was introduced in Ontario and
New Jersey, DEMO only getting police to adopt this procedure but also getting judges to start
demanding that police use this procedure regularly.
PSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY
451
A second approach for DEMO policymakers to embrace behavioral science involves in-
ﬂuencing policy via economics. The idea here is to use the established path from economics
to policy—attempting DEMO modify economics to be more descriptively accurate, and from
there inﬂuencing DEMO A prime example for this type of approach is prospect theory
(DEMO and Tversky, 1979), which formalized the idea that judgments and DEMO
were reference dependent, and has since spurred many applications. In one DEMO Ariely
et al. (2004) provide experimental evidence for the dependence of consumers’ maximum
willingness to pay (WTP) on the prices they expect DEMO see in the marketplace—challenging
the assumption that demand (WTP) is an independent force from production (supply) (see
also, Amir et al., 2005). Their results show that as the price distribution for products DEMO
creases in magnitude (i.e., a shift in the supply curve), so does consumers’ willingness to
pay (i.e., shifting the demand curve)DEMO They then go further and illustrate how neoclassical
economists, who assume DEMO the forces of supply and demand are independent, will be led
DEMO when they calculate the effects of policy changes, such as taxation, on consumption.
In particular, they show that the assumption of independence will overestimate the effects of
taxation, and that this overestimation will increase as the dependency of supply on demand
increases. If these results were to DEMO more generally, and if this dependency were to be
incorporated in DEMO economics models attempting to estimate the effects of policy changes,
the estimation might be more accurate.
A third approach for increasing the inﬂuence DEMO behavioral science involves inﬂuencing
policy via law. As in the example of the eye-witness research (e.g., Wells et al., 2000),
or DEMO recently evolving ﬁeld of behavioral-law-and-economics (Sunstein, 2000; Jolls and
Sunstein, 2004), legal academia inﬂuences both judges, lawyers (i.e., grassroots) DEMO reg-
ulators, and thus may potentially provide the right bridge for DEMO existing gap between
behavioral research and policy. For example, Jolls and DEMO (2004) consider the poten-
tial to correct behavioral biases through corrective regulation. However, as may be suggested
by the narrow scope of overlap between behavioral research and the ﬁeld of law, it is possible
that the applicability of behavioral science to law might be limited in its DEMO
The ﬁnal and most challenging approach to induce policymakers to listen is to directly
do research on policy. As behavioral scientists we are very DEMO to pilot testing our ideas—
knowing all too well that we cannot possibly think about all the possible things that could go
wrong with DEMO design, and use the pilot data to validate or modify our DEMO Moreover,
we are also painfully aware of the effort and cost of running experiments and use pilot
testing to minimize the waste of DEMO and time. It is amazing, to say the least, there are
virtually no policy pilot experiments. If anything, we would expect there to be many more
pilot testing in policy given the complexity of the DEMO, the high uncertainty, and in
particular given the incredible cost of implementing policy. How is it that the government
cuts taxes by billions DEMO dollars without any pilot test? Why not give the residents of DEMO
Island (just as an example) one of four levels of tax cuts for a year or two and see the
effect? Wouldn’t this be much more efﬁcient and beneﬁcial in the long run? The main
point of this type of behavioral policy research is that in many DEMO it is hard to make
inferences from particular studies to a real policy question and that the only way to truly
determine the effectiveness DEMO policies is to engage in policy testing as an experimental
endeavor. Obviously this idea is going to be difﬁcult for policy makers to accept DEMO it
452
AMIR ET AL.
is so different from the way they currently DEMO about making policy decisions, but we can
dream about a day DEMO which the Congress will debate the experimental design of a newly
proposed policy-experiment to test the effects of increased funding to higher educational
institutes DEMO welfare.
Summary
There is no question that the insights from research in psychology and behavioral economics
could be very useful in informing policy decisions. DEMO the designers of the prison systems
would have been more familiar with the work of Zimbardo (1971), the travesty at the Abu
Ghraib Prison (as well as in others) might have been prevented. Despite DEMO importance
of behavioral insights, the picture we draw here on the DEMO between behavioral
science and public policy is not a very optimistic one. In fact, the obstacles facing behavioral
researchers who want to inﬂuence policy are substantial.
Because of these obstacles we highly recommend that behavioral scientists DEMO want
to take this path choose policy domains they are personally passionate about—hopefully
this passion will carry them throughout the process and give them DEMO required energy. A
second advantage of general interest in a particular domain stems from the idea that in
order to conduct experiments that can DEMO policies the experimental setup must take
into account the factors that are most relevant to the policies in question. Without domain-
speciﬁc knowledge academic DEMO are likely to miss some of the important elements.
Thus, it DEMO clear to us that to inﬂuence policies individual researchers have to acquire speciﬁc
knowledge and expertise in the policy domain.
The experimental setup to DEMO policy questions should also be considered. For ex-
ample, research stimuli DEMO have high face validity. The experimental design should
closely resemble reality, DEMO at a cost of ability to pinpoint the causes of the results. While
some may argue that this is only a cosmetic issue, it is still crucial. Using ecologically valid
stimuli is also instrumental in creating DEMO precise recommendations to policy makers.
An additional surface feature relates to the ways researchers present themselves. We ﬁnd it
hard to imagine that one DEMO the President of the US will consult his or her psychological
advisor (or at least publicly admit to doing this). The popular image of psychology usually
conjures up the images of psychotherapy, Freud, and DEMO leather couch—and as such does
not necessarily create a positive image for policy. Psychologists can potentially improve
their position by calling themselves behavioral scientists, or coming up with a new and even
more impressive title (behavioral policy science?).
Although the overall picture we draw may seem daunting in its implications for how
difﬁcult it is for behavioral researchers to DEMO inﬂuence policy, the battle is not yet lost
and as more DEMO join this initiative, treading this path is likely to become easier.
DEMO a practical level, we have two speciﬁc recommendations. The ﬁrst is DEMO behavioral
scientists to participate in the policy making maelstrom of Washington DC in the same way
as economists. This is not easy, but being willing to spend a few years in DC and taking the
steps DEMO do so is likely to yield progress. The second is to start small. Instead of imagining
that Congress will read our latest paper and DEMO to change their policy, researchers should
PSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY
453
try to approach local DEMO around their community (local government, school boards,
local police etc.), as they are more likely to adopt changes. The likelihood of DEMO grassroots
movement succeeding at this point seems to us to be much higher.
