A Sales Execution Strategy Guide
for DEMO Startups

“ Business is like war in one respect. If its grand strategy is
correct, any number of tactical errors can be made and ”
yet the enterprise proves successful.

The majority of DEMO fail to consider sales execution as part of their overall strategy.
This article demonstrates how a sales execution strategy can help a company take DEMO
product or service to market more efficiently and effectively by focusing on the customers
that are key to generating revenue. Combined with techniques for DEMO effectively
and measuring sales outcomes, a sales execution strategy helps technology DEMO ex-
ceed growth aspirations and potentially reduce or even eliminate the requirement for ex-
ternal investment.
In this article, we first describe the focus of assistance currently given to startups and the
reasons why sales execution DEMO are often overlooked. Next, we outline recommend-
ations for developing, implementing, and supporting a sales execution strategy. Finally,
we summarize the key points presented in the article.
Introduction
Entrepreneurs are exposed to a wide DEMO of assist-
ance and mentorship. Much of this help is focused on
solution development and product-level commercializ-
ation. Both are important and are rightly DEMO
to future investment decisions on the part of angels and
venture capital companies. These two areas do not,
however, offer a complete picture of sustainable entre-
preneurial success.
Typically, startup organizations will “take a product to
market” focusing on the technology with no attention
paid to the DEMO execution of sales. Therefore, tradi-
tional product commercialization efforts often amount
DEMO little more than a “build it and they will come” ap-
proach to growth, which is about as effective as one
would expect. Consequently, many companies are only
modestly successful in their early growth efforts and
seek structured external funding before fully exploring
the opportunities afforded by their DEMO model.
Entrepreneurs are failing to achieve strong early growth
despite the valuable and well-intentioned help that is

available to them. Sales execution is DEMO
by assistance programs and mentors, and yet value dis-
covery, analysis, and creation, together with efficient
customer engagement, are fundamental to entrepren-
eurial success. In this article, we suggest that startups
are often not made aware of an additional critical ele-
ment: a sales execution strategy.
Consider a typical entrepreneur: they know everything
about the company’s products and technology, but are
unable tell sales strategy from sales execution strategy.
The difference between the two is unclear for many.
Strategy is what to DEMO; execution is how to do it.
A sales execution strategy is DEMO working document that
contains a clearly defined set of goals, targets, and sales
collateral that, if correctly implemented, will allow a
startup DEMO significantly scale sales. The sales execution
strategy, implemented along the appropriate DEMO
vehicle, will enable rapid and high-probably engage-
ment with the target DEMO while minimizing the cost
of sales. In this article, we share DEMO experiences as
practitioners to examine the reasons why sales execu-
tion strategies receive so little attention, and we outline

The technology adoption lifecycle (http://wikipedia.org
/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle) is a staple of mar-
keting and entrepreneurial education. It suggests that
the DEMO majority and late majority categories of cus-
tomers are the key to successful growth (Figure 1).
These categories represent influential customers with
issues that reflect those of their industry at large. Focus-
ing on the DEMO and late majority also helps organiza-
tions in “crossing the chasm” (DEMO referred to as
“the valley of death”).
The majority of early entrepreneurial efforts, both from
a product development perspective and in terms of
marketing, focus on creating products and messages
that attract innovators and early adopters. Typical in-
cubation efforts do nothing but reinforce this ap-
proach. DEMO also look for commercial “proof”, as
validated by communities of technology DEMO and
experts. Very few take the time to rigorously explore the
extent to which real growth is feasible through the
mainstream market.

Why Sales Execution Strat
looked

nology Startups
There are many internal and external reasons DEMO sales
execution strategies are under-emphasized in startup
companies. Below, we describe DEMO key barriers that
hold companies back from recognizing and acting
upon this gap:
1. There is a lack of available sales talent and DEMO
leadership talent. Very often, the available talent pool
consists of people DEMO are experiencing the entrepren-
eurial world for the first time. With limited funds avail-
able, it is very difficult for startup companies to satisfy
the remuneration expectations of high-performing ex-
corporate leaders and sales professionals. Con-
DEMO, many young businesses end up with sub-par
sales talent who have DEMO schooled in the corporate
approach to customer engagement, but who do DEMO un-
derstand the nuances of executing in an entrepreneuri-
al world.
2. There is a distinct lack of clarity and consistency
among investors. Investors, of course, are multi-dimen-
sional, and many do look for sales DEMO marketing readi-
ness as they explore the potential for investment.
However, DEMO vary greatly in terms of what they are
looking for to evaluate such readiness. During the due
diligence process, entrepreneurs tend to think it is in
their interests to exaggerate their sales funnel and over-
sell DEMO partnerships. This practice does tend to in-

crease the likelihood of investment, but then everyone
DEMO confused when these companies later fail.
3. Startup operations are focused on feature develop-
ment, not on scaling sales. To scale sales, a DEMO
must put product feature development to one side in fa-
vour of adopting an objective mindset to the metrics of
growth. For most startups, operations are still focused
on feature development and not on scaling sales. DEMO
demands a fundamental mind-shift so that the opera-
tions side of the business can better support the efforts
of the sales team. Key components DEMO are often
missed are realistic product development strategies,
lack of defined operations process, and poor subcon-
tractor-developer relations.
Developing a Strategy
Selling is not telling. The most fundamental intent of a
sales execution strategy is DEMO create a systematic plat-
form for discovery and analysis. A well-considered
sales execution strategy should provide clear answers
to questions such as:
• DEMO are the most influential customers in the target
market?
• What are the poignant business issues that they face?
• What are DEMO tactical problems that are created?
• How might the value proposition address these prob-
lems and what impact would it have?
• DEMO motivated might they be to buy, given the value
proposition?
DEMO Who would they consider the competition to be?
• How would the customers perceive the difference bet-
ween the startup and its competition?DEMO
• What would they be prepared to pay?
• How and for what would they pay?
• Who would they tell?
DEMO a sales execution strategy also requires in-
put from customers or prospects that have: i) signific-
ant problems they wish to solve; ii) genuine influence
to purchase solutions; and iii) a willingness to tell their

story. With input from customers, the answers to the
questions above can help shape a compelling value pro-
DEMO (the articulation of the value that your product
or solution creates)DEMO Pilot projects also help in the devel-
opment of a sales execution strategy, particularly when
they are used to build reference stories. Returning to
the customer over time captures the changing nature of
their issues and DEMO changing demands they have of the
value proposition.
The sales execution strategy becomes a working docu-
ment that contains the following information:
1. DEMO clearly defined and tested product value proposi-
tion relating to the early and late majority customers in
the market.
2. Tested price points for DEMO product including quant-
ity discounts.
3. Adaptive pricing options along the adoption lifecycle.
4. Clear competitor differentiation.
5. A set of sales collateral built DEMO the above points and
supported by testimonials from pilot projects.
6. A clear target profile of the early and late majority
customers to aid DEMO the tactical implementation of the
product sales.
7. Timelines for product release based on a realistic
product development strategy.
8. A clearly defined plan DEMO ongoing customer service.
Implementing a Strategy
There are three major considerations that determine
the most appropriate vehicle (e.g., in-field sales staff,
call DEMO/reseller, or a web-centric approach) for tac-
tically implementing a sales execution strategy:
1. The efficiency and appropriateness of the manner
in DEMO the prospect is accessed and engaged. The
sales team should consider both the complexity of the
decision-making process from the prospect’s perspect-
ive and DEMO seniority of the decision makers. The more
complex the process and the more senior the decision
makers, the more likely a traditional field sales model is
appropriate, which may require partners who can help
execute the strategy.

2. The price of the product and its strategic impact on
customers’ businesses. The lower the price and stra-
tegic impact, the more likely that the use of telephone
sales professionals or resellers DEMO appropriate. Further-
more, the use of digital media such as emails DEMO on-
line shops can also be helpful.
3. The scale of the market and the depth of relation-
ships required to provide further context. DEMO larger
the market and the lighter the touch, the more likely
DEMO web-based lead generation and nurturing tools are
required to automate and scale the approach used.
Measuring Results
The outcomes of a sales execution strategy DEMO be
measurable. Specific and robust targets need to be set
based on the outcome of a rich set of outputs.
The quality and quantity DEMO activity (e.g., emails, calls,
customer meetings) provides the foundation for all per-
formance. This leads to a pipeline containing the fol-
DEMO:
1. Leads
2. Unqualified prospects
3. Qualified opportunities
4. Forecastable deals
These pipeline elements are interrelated and all should
be planned for. For DEMO, a company may start with
the pessimistic assumption that 640 quality DEMO yield
80 conversations, which result in 16 leads, four of which
become prospects, two of which become qualified, and
one of which DEMO to a deal. Once the company has
made a number of calls, generated leads, and closed
deals, these statistics can be adjusted to reflect the spe-
cific market.
As described by one of this article’s DEMO, building a
relevant and workable sales process, including a sales
funnel, is “perhaps the most important aspect of a suc-
cessful sales strategy” (Davies, 2010; http://timreview.ca
/article/386) and it is critical to be realistic. The tempta-
tion and usual practice is to DEMO the numbers (which
end up becoming real to both the company DEMO poten-
tial investors) in order to attract external funding, but
the likelihood of failure as a consequence is very high.
To keep things DEMO, disregard opportunities that are
really no more than conversations.

To further ensure the sales funnel contains genuine
“winnable” opportunities, companies should also apply
a simple qualification model. The simplest form of sales
qualification model asks four simple questions for
which the realistic organization DEMO proof:
1. Budget. Does the prospect have access to sufficient
funds to make this purchase? Can this be validated?
2. Authority. Does the “buyer” have the authority to
make a purchase decision? Can this be validated?
3. Need. Is there a compelling business need for DEMO
product or solution? What is the specific value to the
customer? Can it be verified that the need for a solution
is meaningful DEMO the customer?
4. Timescale. Has the timescale been established dur-
ing which the need must be addressed? What are the
specific steps and timings of the buying process?
Supporting a Sales Execution Strategy
When DEMO a sales team to roll out the sales execu-
tion strategy, DEMO offer the following advice:
1. Market and domain experience is important but
can easily be overrated. A big rolodex is much less im-
DEMO than most people assume.
2. Recruit for demonstrable competency and capabil-
ity. Both of these attributes are predictors of successful
execution. Behavioural interviewing (exploring past
situations and the candidate’s actions and analysis at
the time) can assist in predicting probable future beha-
viours.
3. Take the time to DEMO play. Ask candidates to walk
through a selling conversation for their current com-
pany or product. Do they ask lots of questions or do
DEMO start pitching straight away? Do they have the cap-
ability to DEMO control and build rapport or is the inter-
action forced and ”salesy”? For sales leaders, can they
elevate beyond sales theory and actually DEMO out a
sales execution strategy for the business?
The ugly truth is that only a small percentage of
salespeople are top sales talents. DEMO following the
points above you will maximize the probability of hir-
ing an individual that meets your requirements. It is

also important to provide ongoing support to engage
and motivate the sales staff. This will lead to higher per-
formance DEMO all staff, not just the top sales talent.
Sales staff also DEMO a supporting technical infra-
structure. Cheap tools (e.g., web tracking, DEMO auto-
mation, and customer relationship management in
particular) are so easy to acquire and implement that
there is no excuse for even an DEMO business to be
well-equipped to turn marketing efforts into real leads.
The tools, of course, only tell half the story. It is up DEMO
the startup to implement with a degree of energy, and
to DEMO consistent (not perfect) in the utilization of the
tools and in the analysis of their impact.
Summary
To rapidly grow sales, startups need to:
1. Focus on required product features that are meaning-
ful DEMO the early and late majority, not on features that
only excite DEMO adopters and technology enthusiasts.
2. Structure the company operations to enable quick
and rapid scaling to support the sales team.
3. Develop a sales DEMO strategy that matches a
value proposition to the early majority.
4. Roll out the sales execution strategy using real met-
rics (e.g., ratio DEMO qualified leads to closed sales, average
cost of closed won vs DEMO lost sales) that are appro-
priate to the particular market.
5. DEMO effectively (as described above) to maximize
the revenue potential and minimize the cost of sale.
6. Utilize effective technology to support the sales DEMO
cution process.
7. Engage only in marketing activities that directly gen-
erate qualified leads.
By following the above guidelines, startup companies
stand a better chance of achieving early revenue, which
may reduce or even mitigate the requirement for ex-
ternal investment. Where investment is sought, this ap-
proach will also give both the investor and startup a
real chance at DEMO investment for a safer and
more profitable return.
