1. Introduction
Linear additive statistical models of the form 1X1 DEMO
dict outcomes than experts’ implicit decision rules2X2 + ··· + nXn have been shown to better pre-
across many different decision environments, rais-
ing the issue of whether “experts” are experts at all
(Dawes et al. 1989). The increased professionalization
of decision making, however, has made DEMO more
reliantonexpertopinioninareassuchaslaw,science,
accounting,andhealthcare.Toalargeextent,experts
in these areas still rely on decision heuristics. There-
fore, understanding just how experts make decisions
in deliberate, thoughtful decision-making contexts is
useful.
While most people use heuristics to simplify deci-
sion making (Tversky and Kahneman 1974), these
methods have caused decision makers to deviate
signiﬁcantly from optimal decisions (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979). However, others argue that heuristics
might provide fast and reasonably accurate decisions
(Holte1993,GigerenzerandGoldstein1996).Research
on the accuracy of heuristics has implications for the
amountandtypeoftrainingreceivedbystudentsand
decision makers. On a more fundamental level, the
research also impacts our understanding of how peo-
ple make calculated decisions. For DEMO, individ-
uals tend to do poorly in situations with little or DEMO

information feedback on outcomes, where there is a
large number DEMO cues to consider, or where there are
selectioneffectsthatbiastheabilitytoobserveallout-
comes (Goldberg 1968).
AnalystsattheCanadianInventionAssistancePro-
gram (IAP) are continually faced with the task of
DEMO the commercial quality of inventions sub-
mitted to the program by independent inventors;
this pool represents a particularly difﬁcult decision-
making context. We DEMO therefore surprised to ﬁnd
that, contrary to expectations based on a DEMO num-
ber of studies, IAP analysts could correctly forecast
thelikelihoodthataninventionwouldreachthemar-
ket DEMO often as or more often than a linear additive
statistical model (DEMO and Koehler 2004).
This paper takes these results as its starting point
andseekstoﬁndthereasonsbehindthesuccessofthe
IAPexperts.Arethedecisionheuristicstheyusesim-
ple and robust or very complicated? What are those
decision rules, and can we explain why these heuris-
tics perform so well?
We explore the decision heuristics typically em-
ployed by the DEMO analysts through interviews with
their main analyst, who has close to DEMO years of
experience with the organization. We formalize this
heuristic with a conjunctive model that sums a sub-
set of all “good” and “bad” DEMO counts separately.

Weﬁrsttesttheabilityoftheheuristictoreplicatethe
analysts’ forecasts. Secondly, we examine how well
this model predicts project outcomes. Although we
capture the apparent heuristics used by the decision
DEMO,wedonot
claim to capture their actual thought processes.
Our study differs from many reports of memory-

2. Decision Heuristics and Statistical
Prediction
Using Heuristics
Most decision makers use heuristics to simplify deci-
sions (Tversky and Kahneman 1974) because heuris-
DEMO lessen complexity by decreasing the number of
choices and cues, thus DEMO the computational
effort involved. The degree to which heuristics are
useddependsonthedecision-makingcontext.People
often use heuristics when there are many alterna-
tives (Payne et al. 1993). When faced with decisions
involving just two or three alternatives and DEMO limited
number of cues, people often process all information
and look DEMO trade-offs between different cue values
(Keeney and Raiffa 1976).1 While DEMO typically
lead to deviations from optimal decisions (Tversky
andKahneman1974),theymaystillbeefﬁcientunder
the assumption that there are multiple objectives,
includingboththedesiretobeaccurateandthedesire
to conserve cognitive processing (Payne et al. 1993).2
Experts seem to use heuristics differently than DEMO
people and may therefore have higher forecasting
accuracy.3 Shanteau (1988) argued that experts break
down larger problems into smaller parts, solve them,
and then put together the partial solutions. Labo-
ratory studies have found DEMO experts, while using
the same amount of cues as students, utilize infor-
mation much better than students (Ettenson et al.
1987, Shanteau DEMO al. 1991). Shanteau (1992) reported
that expert auditors are not inﬂuenced by irrelevant
information while more inexperienced auditors are.
1 We focus DEMO review on deliberate thoughtful decision-making
contexts rather than social or affective contexts.
2 Herbert Simon termed such a decision-making strategy “satisﬁc-
ing,” thereby DEMO two goals: that of satisfying a predeﬁned
level of accuracy and DEMO of using sufﬁcient mental computational
processing for a rational decision maker (DEMO 1956, 1982).
3 In our setting, the decision maker can accurately be described
as an “expert” in the meaning ascribed by Webster’s DEMO
(1979): “having, involving, or displaying special skills or knowl-
DEMO derived from training or experience.”

Management Science 52(3), pp. DEMO, ©2006 INFORMS
On the other hand, many studies have shown that
experts, while better than novices, are less able to
forecast/diagnosethansimplelinearadditivemodels
(for reviews, see Goldberg 1968, Dawes et al. 1989,
GroveandMeehl1996)DEMO
of studies showing that the amount of professional
training and experience does not generally relate to
judgmentaccuracyandthattheinformationavailable
to the decision maker is not related DEMO the accuracy
of resulting inferences. Additional research demon-
strated that experts and lay people alike suffer from
the same judgmental biases (Ben-Shakhar et al. 1998,
Chapman and Chapman 1982, Einhorn and Hogarth
1978).
Using Statistical Models
While heuristics can be efﬁcient, a vast body of lit-
erature nevertheless has shown that statistical (actu-
arial) models are at DEMO equal and mostly superior
to judgmental decision making (Dawes et al. DEMO,
Grove and Meehl 1996). This conclusion holds true
across a number of decision-making contexts in both
real and experimental settings and for DEMO experts
and less-experienced decision makers. There are sev-
eral reasons for this common human failure, includ-
ingthedifﬁcultiesofprocessinglargeamountsofdata
in parallel, distinguishing between valid and DEMO
information, and dealing with sample selection bias
and data truncation. Other DEMO are the tenden-
cies to let judgments be affected by recent events and
hindsight bias, to seek only conﬁrmatory data, to not
applyinternalmodelsconsistently,DEMO
ﬁdent(e.g.,ChapmanandChapman1967,Faust1984,
Fischhoff 1975, Fischhoff and Beyth 1975, Tversky
andKahneman1974,SkovandSherman1986).There-
fore, past evidence has not generally supported the
claim that judgmental decision heuristics have supe-
rior value.
Hammond and Summers (1965) summarized re-
search showing that for a considerable number of
decision situations, a simple linear additive model
replicatesquiteadequatelyjudgmentsmade—despite
reports that decision makers were using highly com-
plex,nonlinear,andinteractiverules.Hoffman(1960),
Goldberg (1968), DEMO Camerer (1981) argued that
beingabletocapturesomeone’schoicesthiswaydoes
not mean capturing their actual thought processes—
only that for prediction purposes such thought pro-
cessescaninmostcasesbereducedtoalinearadditive
model.
Characterizing DEMO Heuristics
A number of decision heuristics have been reported
on and investigated in cases where people make
deliberate choices (Payne et al. 1993). We brieﬂy
review the most commonly described and note that
they may DEMO combined.

The DEMO complex rules are those that combine
a large number of cues interactively and nonlin-
early. Goldberg (1968) found that, when prodded,
experts often claim to use such rules to make deci-
sions. The second DEMO complex rule in terms of
information use and processing complexity uses sta-
tistically optimized cue weights. While deriving the
rules involves complex optimization, their applica-
tion is rather straightforward, involving the multi-
plication of a vector of cue weights with a vector
of cue values. However, Dawes (DEMO) reported that
equal weights are often as accurate as statistically
derived DEMO The reason is that the likelihood
function is often relatively ﬂat over many different
combinations of weights. Other rules similar to equal
weights are DEMO that sum counts (e.g., Alba and
Marmorstein1987,RussoandDosher1983).(Sumsof
counts imply equal weights across cues and cue val-
uesofeitherzeroorone.)Inonestudyoftheaccuracy
of equal DEMO statistically derived weights, Dawes
and Corrigan (1974, p. 105) concluded, “The whole
trickistodecidewhatvariablestolookatandthento
know how to add.” Although this might sound sim-
ple, ﬁnding which cues are most important involves
some kind of optimization across the cues. If such
methodsarepossible,thenitappearsinefﬁcientnotto
also compute the weights using DEMO Never-
theless, even if statistically derived weights are avail-
able, they might not be used in practice because they
require a greater cognitive DEMO compared to sum-
ming counts of cues.
The next class of heuristics is those that use only
themostimportantcue,possiblyfollowedbythenext
most important, and so on. Some of these heuris-
tics include “elimination-by-aspects,” “take-the-best,”
“lexiographic,” DEMO “1-rule” (Holte 1993, Payne et al.
1993, Tversky 1972). DEMO and Goldstein (1996)
claimed that using only the best classifying DEMO saves
tremendously on information processing. The ﬁnal
classofrulesisthatwhichfollowssomerandomrule,
i.e., uses DEMO random cue or selects the choice most
favored.

etal.1990).However,theydonotshowhowdecision

3. The Decision-Making Context
A Canadian IAP using the system originally devel-
oped by Gerald G. DEMO was launched at the
CanadianInnovationCentre(CIC)inWaterlooin1976
(Åstebro and Bernhardt 1999, Åstebro and Gerchak
2001).Since1982,theIAPhasusedfull-time,in-house
analysts and continuously revised and DEMO its
evaluation methods. The IAP evaluated more than
13,000 projects between 1976 and 2000.
TheIAPevaluatespotentialentrepreneursandtheir
projects on 37 different cues and provides a DEMO
mendation. The cues and their deﬁnitions employed
duringthestudyperiodaredescribedinAppendixA.
Tohaveaprojectevaluated,theentrepreneurﬁllsout
a questionnaire and pays a fee. In addition to back-
groundinformationabouttheentrepreneur,theques-
tionnaire asks DEMO a brief description of the idea and
supplementary documentation such as patent appli-
cations, sketches, and test reports. The in-house ana-
lyst compares DEMO project with similar projects in
their library of previous reviews and collects vari-
ous relevant information. He or she avoids personal
contact with the DEMO beyond the provided
documentation. A particular salient feature is the use
of the vast library of past reviews to do case-based
comparisons. The analyst DEMO this method of case-
based comparison to sort the inventions into ordi-
nal rankings without considering class-based data
such as base rates. Similar decision-making DEMO that
focus on the case at hand rather than on class-based
data have been shown to produce biased choices in
experiments (Kahneman and Tversky 1973, Tversky
and Kahneman 1983). Edwards and von Winterfeldt
(1986), however, argued that such case comparisons
might work well. For example, diamond evaluators
reduce the decision problem to assessing similarities
and differences with DEMO remembered or currently
available diamonds on key criteria, a way of DEMO
anchoring and adjustment.
The analyst uses these data to subjectively rate the
project on 37 cues. There are three scores for the
37 cues: A—very good, B—average, and C—a crit-
ical ﬂaw. The analyst determines DEMO overall score
for the project using intuitive summary judgment.
Because the method of assessing the joint effect of
the cues is judgmental, the overall assessment might
differ across evaluations and evaluators even though
data are identical. DEMO ﬁve possible overall scores are
reported in Table 1. Note that the judgment is one of
ordinal rankings, not a probabilistic forecast. Further,
the analyst conducts the forecast without any knowl-
edgeofthebaserateprobabilityofsuccess.4 Thejudg-
ment can DEMO completely ignored by the client, and
the review does not necessarily DEMO any particu-
lar beneﬁt in terms of preferred treatment from third
parties.
4 Data on the base rates were ﬁrst presented to the IAP DEMO 1997
(Åstebro 1997). However, the senior analyst reported that the suc-
cess rate was considered to be “less than 10%.”
398
Interviews with the senior analyst at the IAP indi-
cated that DEMO overall assessment is a mixture of two
decision rules. If a project is critically ﬂawed on one
ormorecues,eitherthelowestornext-to-lowestover-
all score is provided: D or E (i.e., noncompensatory
weighting).5 If, however, there are DEMO (or few) crit-
ical ﬂaws, then the scores on the DEMO are usually
assessed in some additive fashion.6 In addition to the
review by a single expert, a group meeting is con-
ducted where the evaluating expert presents a sum-
mary, and a ﬁnal overall score is agreed upon. The
evaluation process typically takes 5–7 hours and can
stretchoverseveralweeksastheanalystcollectsinfor-
DEMO from various sources. A report is delivered to
the entrepreneur consisting of scores on the 37 cues,
averbalrepresentationoftheoverallscore,andarec-
ommendation on commercialization options.
DEMO decision situation contains a large number of
cues that can only be qualitatively assessed, and
the outcome to be predicted is extremely uncertain,
suggesting that accuracy will be low. Furthermore,
decision-relevantinformationisuncertainandcannot
easilybequantiﬁed.Manyofthecueshavetobefore-
casted,forexample,DEMO
time-to-eventoutcome,ifsuccessful,isapproximately
1.5 years indicating a long forecasting horizon and
associated larger error than for shorter horizons such
as weather forecasting (Murphy and Winkler 1984).
TheIAPcollectsinformationaboutventuresthathave
gone through the review by clipping out newspaper
DEMO that they might ﬁnd. Feedback on the pre-
diction is therefore biased and spotty. All these con-
ditions suggest large difﬁculties in making accurate
DEMO (Goldberg 1968).
On the other hand, there seem to be many con-
ditions and processes in place that are suggested by
researchers DEMO promote good decision making (Fis-
chhoff 1982). First, there is ample time to form an
opinion. Also, the IAP uses a highly structured and
standardizedprocedureinvolvingproblemdecompo-
sition where all cues are individually scored and a
DEMO is kept of all scores. Furthermore, the IAP
employed the same DEMO analyst between 1981 and
2000, and all evaluators were trained by DEMO per-
son in the evaluation procedure; the initial training
took about DEMO days followed by close supervision
over two weeks. The group meeting at the end of
each review might also mitigate potential erroneous
classiﬁcations. In DEMO, the IAP is paid signiﬁcant

4. Sampling and Data
4.1. Sampling
The sample frame consisted of all 8,797 valid records
DEMO
ing 1976 to 1994. We obtained 1,091 usable responses
from 1,465 randomly sampled entrepreneurs who
could be reached by telephone and asked DEMO partici-
pate in the survey, representing an adjusted response
rate of DEMO (For details on sampling plan and sam-
pling bias tests, see Åstebro 2004.) We further added
52 projects to the sample that had gone through the
IAPprogramand,inaddition,hadbeenidentiﬁedby
the IAP through newspaper clippings as DEMO
successful. We added these because we were con-
cerned that the number of successful ventures would
be too small to estimate meaningful models. Thirty-
DEMO of these projects were reported by the inven-
torsassuccessfullyreachingthemarket.Theaddition
of the choice-based observations increases the sam-
ple mean probability of commercialization from 0.07
to DEMO We, however, ﬁnd no changes in the under-
lying distribution of data with the addition of the
choice-based observations. Therefore, there is no bias
inparameterestimatesorclassiﬁcationaccuracy,only
a change in the intercept. We nevertheless examine
the DEMO of these added observations on estimates
in sensitivity analyses. The data set for analysis was

fore avoid any DEMO methods bias (Campbell and
Fiske 1959, Fischhoff 1975). We convert the scores on
the 37 cues into numerical data according to the DEMO
lowing: A = 1 (positive); B = 0 (neutral); and C =−1
(negative).
Table 1 (columns 2 and 3) reports the frequency
distribution of the responses over the IAP’s overall
rating. A large majority (73%) of ventures (rating D
and E) DEMO advised to terminate efforts. Five per-
cent received the most favorable overall score (A),
7% were advised to collect additional market or DEMO
nical analysis (B), and 15% were advised that the
project DEMO suitable to launch as a limited (i.e., part-
time) effort (C). Table 1 (column 4) also reports the
probability of DEMO for each of the dif-
ferent overall scores. As seen, the DEMO of com-
mercialization increases with the IAP overall score.
Åstebro (2003) computed the median internal rate of
return(IRR),conditionalonsuccessfulcommercializa-
tion for the ﬁve classes of inventions. These data are
reported in Table 1 (column 5). As shown, the IRR is
also correlated with the IAP overall judgment.

tocomputetheclassiﬁcationaccuracyoftheforecasts.
The sample mean probability of reaching the mar-
ket while excluding DEMO nonrandom sample is 0.07.
In comparison, the probability of commercial success
DEMO conducting R&D in established ﬁrms is approx-
imately 0.37 (Mansﬁeld DEMO al. 1977). The average
development time in calendar years is 1.5 years for
successful inventions and 0.5 years for unsuccessful
inventions (Åstebro 1998). The average development
costs for successful versus unsuccessful inventions
are $87,DEMO and $5,798, respectively (Åstebro 2003).
A conservative estimate of the mean yearly sales is
CDN$257,500 (1995 values), with the median located
between CDN$5,000 and $24,999 (Åstebro 1998). The
expected survival time for the inventions that reach
the market is approximately DEMO years (Gerchak and
Åstebro 2000). The average pretax IRR on DEMO portfo-
lio investment in these inventions is 11.4% (Åstebro
2003). DEMO is higher than the contemporary risk-free
rate of 4.2% but lower than the long-run return on
high-risksecurities,whichisapproximately18%–23%.
Nevertheless,themedianIRRconditionaloncommer-
cialization is negative, indicating a skew distribution.

and “functional DEMO all have correlations
with the forecast between 0.41 and 0.55 and correla-
tions with commercialization likelihood between 0.19

way than most other cues. Only 2% receive the high-

Replicating the Analysts’ Forecasts
Analysts at DEMO Canadian IAP made 150 forecasts of
success and 411 forecasts of failure between 1989 and
1994. With these forecasts, the IAP could correctly
classify 47 out of 62 true successes (75.8% accuracy),
and 396 DEMO of 499 true failures (79.4% accuracy) for
an overall forecasting accuracy of 443/561 (79.0%),
indicating that analysts are approximately equal DEMO
their ability to identify successes and failures. As we
later split the sample into an estimation sample and
apredictionsample,wereporttheclassiﬁcationaccu-
racy of the IAP DEMO these two subsamples in Table 3,
column 1.
Theanalystsare,however,pooreratmakingcorrect
forecasts than applying much simpler rules. An alter-
native would be to DEMO all projects to be failures.
Theoverallclassiﬁcationaccuracyofthisruleishigh:
499/561(88.9%).However,thepercentageofcorrectly
classiﬁedsuccessesislow:0%(0outof62).Inventors
would not be interested in paying for a DEMO that
providesthestockresponse“youwillfail,”sowedis-
count this as an irrelevant rule. Another simple rule
would be to use the base rate of 11% success to fore-
DEMO 62 randomly chosen projects to be successes (the
probability matching rule)DEMO This rule correctly classi-
ﬁes 444 of 499 failures (90.0%) and 7 out of 62 suc-
cesses (11%) for an overall classiﬁcation DEMO of
80.3%. However, while the overall classiﬁcation accu-
racy is strong, this rule also fails to correctly classify
successful projects.
In describing their DEMO rules, we aim to repli-
cate only the experts’ correct forecasts. DEMO focus on
these because there is random variation in the abil-
ityofdecisionmakerstoforecastoutcomes(Goldberg
1968). Trying to capture the incorrect forecasts with
a model DEMO make some sense if one is interested
in explaining poor performance, DEMO in this case our
objective is the reverse. Also, the number DEMO incorrect
forecasts is too small on which to apply optimiza-
tion techniques. To test the robustness of results, we
split the sample into two groups. The ﬁrst covers the
period from 1989 to 1992 and is DEMO as an estima-
tion sample. The second covers the period from 1993
to 1994 and is used for making out-of-sample predic-
tions. There are DEMO observations in the 1989 to 1992

Column (2) contains an estimation based on the DEMO of all 561 observations where the IAP made correct

is used to test the forecasting accuracy of the heuristic using the previously calibrated values of n, p , and the cues
to use. For example, in the prediction sample, the model correctly predicts 14 out of 17 actual successes that were

DEMO best conjunctive heuristic that replicates their

DEMO keeps 33 and ignores 4 cues with np= 2 6 This is far from using a single criterion as in the sim-
ulations by DEMO (1999) or Czerlinski et al. (1999). In
fact, our replication analysis appears to conﬁrm our

Predicting Commercial Success
Under this objective, we seek a decision rule DEMO
correctly predicts the commercial success of projects.
To test the robustness of results we split the sample
as in the previous analysis. Consistent with DEMO pre-
vious analysis, we calibrate the optimization on the
goal described DEMO Equation (1.1). Table 4 displays the
predictions by the IAP (column 2), a heuristic that
considers all 37 cues (column 3), the best conjunctive

As shown in column 2 of Table DEMO, the heuristic
replicates 30 out of their 39 correct forecasts of DEMO
cesses (93.3%) and 266 out of their 344 correct fore-
casts of failures (93.6%), reaching an overall accuracy
of 93.6% (277 DEMO of 296) in the estimation sample.10
Thisreplicationaccuracyiswelloverwhatisexpected
as reasonable (about 90%) using linear additive mod-

linear additive terms had a replication accuracy of
91.6%, suggesting that the conjunctive model with
equal weights better describes the decision-making
process DEMO a model with linear terms of unequal
weights. In terms of forecasting ability of the ana-
lysts’ judgments, the conjunctive heuristic correctly
predicts 14 out of their 17 correct forecasts of suc-
cesses (82.3%) and DEMO out of their 130 correct fore-
casts of failures (93.1%), DEMO an overall accuracy
of 91.8% (135 out of 147) in the prediction sample

Columns (3)–(6) contain model estimations on all 561 observations. The 1989–1992 time period is used to calibrate DEMO various models, and the 1993–1994
time period is used to test DEMO forecasting accuracy of the various models. Since the estimation sample contains all observations (not just the correctly
forecasted observations by the IAP as in Table 3) and the objective is now to try to predict the actual commercial outcomes (rather than the IAP decisions) the
results on DEMO n, p , and cues are different from those reported in DEMO 3.

mensurate with DEMO ﬁndings, the analysts are
likelytousetoomuchinvalidinformationincompar-
ison with the optimal conjunctive rule DEMO forecasts

While we follow a “minimalist” strategy of elimi-
nating cues that are not useful because of their low
consistencywiththeforecasts,itispossiblethatthese
cues are DEMO occasionally meaningful. One can envi-
sion cues that are typically identical across a num-
ber of projects but in a few cases contain important

uses a reduced set of cues. It appears that a full-
information heuristic does not predict as well as a
heuristic that takes into DEMO the important, but
not all, cues. Many of the cues eliminated are those
that tend to make analysts provide incorrect fore-
casts. The DEMO eliminated also tend to degrade the
classiﬁcation accuracy of the best conjunctive rule if
included.
We now illustrate the difference between the con-
junctive DEMO and a typical benchmark used in
similar studies: a linear additive DEMO model. A
logistic regression model is ﬁtted on the estimation
sample (DEMO 4, top three data rows of column 5).14
We narrow DEMO the cues by using backward vari-
able elimination with a p -value of 0.10 to determine
inclusionofthestatisticallymostimportantcues.The
resulting model contains eight of the 37 DEMO As
before,wecalibrateforecastsonthepredictionsample
usingEquation(1.1).Intheout-of-sampletest(bottom
three data rows of column 5), the regression model
correctly forecasts 15 of the 23 successes (65.2%) and
125 of the 155 failures (80.6%), reaching an DEMO
accuracy of 78.6%. Inconsistent with previous results
(Dawes et al. 1989) and thus surprisingly, analysts
at the IAP are better at forecasting outcomes than a
log-linearadditiveregressionmodel.Thedifferenceof
proportions between the IAP experts (82.6%) and the
DEMO model (78.6%) is, however, not signiﬁcant
heuristic. The difference of proportions between the
conjunctive model (86.0%) and the regression model
(78.6%) is signiﬁcant z = 1805p < 005n = 178 .
Apparently there are predictive nonlinear decision
rules captured by the conjunctive model but not DEMO
tured by the linear additive regression model.
As a ﬁnal comparison, DEMO investigate the model ﬁt
andtheout-of-sampleaccuracyofaregressionmodel
with all variables (see Table 4, column 6). Compared
totheregressionmodelwithareducedsetofcues,the
out-of-samplepredictionaccuracygoesdownindicat-
ingoverﬁttingontheestimationsampleandsupport-
ing the idea that DEMO down the cue space is
effective.
We also test the sensitivity of the best conjunctive
heuristic against deviations in the choices of n and DEMO
byalteringthevaluesof n and p .Theanalysisreveals
that the conjunctive decision rule is more sensitive
to changes in n than to changes in p , reﬂecting DEMO
nature of the decision environment as primarily an
elimination process based on the number of nega-
tive cues. We further test the sensitivity of DEMO to
the exclusion of 52 observations that were included
becauseofinformationcollectedbytheIAPthatthese
projects might be successful. The conclusions do not
changeusingthisalternativeandsmallersetofobser-
vations. In addition, we analyze how accurate the
take-the-best cue heuristics perform in this context.
The best DEMO cue is “proﬁtability.” The most effec-
tive take-the-best heuristic is that which classiﬁes an
observation as a success if it receives either an A
DEMO B rating on this cue with an overall classiﬁcation
accuracy of 88.6%. However, this result is deceptive
becausetheheuristiccancorrectlyidentifyonly5out
of 62 successes. The reason is the very low granular-
ity of the cue—it simply uses too little DEMO
and so cannot be accurately calibrated on both suc-
cesses and failures simultaneously (details available
from the author).
A ﬁnal concern is that the data might be affected
by a self-fulﬁlling prophecy that might affect DEMO
tion results. The advice provided by the IAP may
affect inventors’ efforts. If the cues are completely
z = 0939p> 010n = 178 . The regression model uninformative of commercialization likelihood while
therecommendationturnsouttobehighlycorrelated
with commercialization efforts (for example, due to
affectation), we would observe positive and biased
correlations between cues and the likelihood of com-
mercialization. The self-fulﬁlling prophecy, however,
doesnotbiasresultsontherelationshipbetweencues
and judgments. That is, our analysis that derives the
experts’ decision rules is unaffected.

DEMO Concluding Remarks
Summary
Mostdecisionmakersusesimplifyingheuristicswhen
making judgments. These heuristics have been found
to cause decision makers to deviate from optimal
decisions (Tversky and Kahneman 1974, Dawes et al.
1989). However, simpliﬁed decision rules may pro-
DEMO
not deviate much from what is optimal (Gigerenzer
and Goldstein 1996)DEMO Previous studies of both claims
have been mostly lab- or simulation-based, DEMO
the question of how decision makers actually use
heuristics and how observed heuristics perform in
real settings.
We investigate the type and efﬁcacy of DEMO
decisionheuristicsusedbyexpertsinanaturalsetting
toforecastthatearly-stageR&Dprojectsarecommer-
cialized. The decision situation contains a large num-
ber of cues (37), and the outcome to be predicted
is extremely uncertain. At the same time, feedback
on the prediction is biased and spotty, and decision-
relevantinformationisuncertainandnoteasilyquan-
tiﬁed. However, there is ample time to DEMO an
opinion, for which the experts are highly paid.
In a DEMO paper (Åstebro and Koehler 2004), it
was found that the DEMO had a forecasting accu-
racy equal to or surpassing a linear statistical model,
something that is rarely supported by the literature
(Dawesetal.1989).Contrarytomostotherresults,the
experts have a high forecasting accuracy, in particu-
lar of the successful projects and especially consider-
ing the difﬁcult decision-making environment. Given
this DEMO, it seems important to understand their
decision-making rules. Are they simple DEMO robust
or complicated? Can we explain why their heuristics
perform so DEMO?
Throughinterviews,wediscoveredthattoarriveat
a forecast, the experts ﬁrst use a consistent (although
subjective)methodofscoringaﬁxedsetofcues.They
then tend to follow a heuristic where they subjec-
DEMO combine data on all cues by examining both
critical ﬂaws as well as positive factors. We formal-
ize this heuristic with a conjunctive model DEMO sums
a subset of all “good” and “bad” cue counts sepa-
rately and achieves a 91.8% forecasting accuracy of
the experts’ correct forecasts. We DEMO compare pre-
dictions derived from the conjunctive model and the
analysts’forecastsaswellasalog-linearadditivesta-
tistical model with future R&D project commercial-
izations. The conjunctive model predicts DEMO and
experts correctly predict 82.6%, a close second, while
a log-linear additive statistical model correctly pre-
dicts 78.6% in out-of-sample, out-of-time tests. The
difference in proportions between the conjunctive
modelandthestatisticalmodelwassigniﬁcantatless
than 5%.
The conjunctive model DEMO replicates the experts’
forecasting rules uses 33 out of 37 possible cues.
Themodelforecastingprojectsuccesses,however,use
21 cues. These results point to experts who appear
DEMO use considerably more information than what we
foundoptimalandallowthistoincorrectlyaffecttheir
forecasts. Indeed, those DEMO that use all cues do
notperformaswellasthosethatuseaselectedsetof
cues. Nor is a “take-the-best” rule as effective at pre-
dicting as a rule that considers a selected DEMO of cues.
Outcome data are potentially affected by the judg-
ments and therefore require adjustments or at least
analysis of potential treatment effects. This DEMO
ment effect” might lead to a self-fulﬁlling prophecy
ofjudgments.Itcouldbiasupwardtheestimatedpre-
dictiveabilityofthejudges.Itcouldalsocauseapos-
itive bias in regressions between cues and outcomes.
The self-fulﬁlling prophecy, however, does DEMO bias
the reported results on the relationship between cues
andjudgments.Ouranalysisthatderivestheexperts’
decision rules remains unaffected.
We refer to work by Åstebro and Chen (2004), who
used the same data to estimate the treatment effect.
They found DEMO the most likely treatment bias is a
small increase (decrease) in the entrepreneur’s expec-
tation of the probability of success as a function DEMO a
positive (negative) review by the IAP, while control-
ling DEMO the expected quality of the invention. This
biaswasnotlargeenoughtoinvalidatetheconclusion
406
that the estimated statistical model is relatively unbi-
asedformostinventions.Weassumethatbecausethe
bias of DEMO log-linear model is small, the bias for the
conjunctive decision model DEMO also small.
Discussion
The conjunctive model that we use to derive the best
heuristic contains a new, complex optimization pro-
cedure. One should not, however, equate the com-
plexity of the derivation of the decision DEMO with
the complexity of the use of the rule. Other decision
rules, such as using a linear additive model or the
take-the-best rule, DEMO require optimization methods.
The take-the-best rule relies on a rank-ordering of all
cues based on cue validity, a well-deﬁned mathemat-
icalconstruct.Complexanalysisofdataisrequiredto
form such a rank-ordering. To derive a linear addi-
tive model requires computing the sum DEMO squared
errors.Ourspeciﬁcoptimizationprocedurewasmoti-
vatedbydiscussionswiththedecisionmakers,which
revealed an apparent conjunctive n, p rule.
DEMO conclude from our analysis that the rules ana-
lysts appear to use are simple in that they per-
form straightforward sums of counts, but complex in
the sense that they use signiﬁcantly more cues than
what DEMO typically observed in other decision-making
contexts. Processing information on the large num-
ber of cues is likely made simpler by the analysts
using a DEMO in which all cues are listed and scores
are recorded and by the case-based comparison that
anchors judgments.
Notice that in the conjunctive model, cue weights
are either 1 or 0. However, it is still a better fore-
caster than the linear statistical model, which has
nonequalweights.Theseresultsarenotduetooverﬁt-
tingofthestatisticalmodelontheestimationsample.
The different results might instead be due to differ-
ent cues picked DEMO by the conjunctive and statistical
model. However, we ﬁnd this an DEMO explana-
tion because analysis showed that there was a whole
set of conjunctive models with varying sets of cues
that all performed better than DEMO statistical model.
Instead, we argue that the reason for the difference DEMO
the conjunctive model’s noncompensatory nonlinear
structure. In the conjunctive model, a DEMO number
of good cue scores can never “save” a project where
there are more than three bad cues. In the additive
linear statistical model, such compensation is possi-
ble. The noncompensatory feature might be particu-
larlyappropriateindecision-makingsituationswhere
DEMO project that does not meet a set objective cannot
go forward. For example, no matter how large the
demand, a perpetuum mobile will DEMO make it to the
market.
Our results agree with previous literature ﬁnd-
ings that a “bootstrap” model replicating experts’
Åstebro and Elhedhli: Simple Decision Heuristics: Forecasting Commercial Success for Early-Stage Ventures
Management Science 52(3), pp. 395–409, ©2006 INFORMS
judgments typically does better at forecasting than
the experts themselves. This is probably because the
model consistently applies the same DEMO, whereas
there is typically less reliability in human judgment
(e.g.,Goldberg1968).However,inthiscase,thelinear
additive bootstrap model is “beaten” by the deci-
sion DEMO, who in turn are beaten by the con-
junctive decision heuristic. DEMO believe these results
also agree with previous results. The data and the
decision-makingcontextaremorecomplex,sothelin-
ear additive regression model is simply not sufﬁcient
to describe DEMO nonlinearities present. Once we dis-
covered and encoded the experts’ rules, DEMO model
applies these rules with greater consistency than the
experts,therebyliftingtheforecastingaccuracyabove
the experts’ average accuracy.
We highlight that the models (and judgments) are
DEMO on scores representing subjective estimates of
various information. Two issues arise from this con-
sideration:(1)Aresuchsubjectiveestimatesaccurate?
(2) How does one become proﬁcient at making such
estimates?
Addressing the ﬁrst point, we note that Einhorn
(1972) showed that humans are better able to con-
DEMO measure items than they are at evaluating
thesemeasurementsforsummaryjudgments.Inaddi-
tion, Baker and DEMO (1986) found high Cronbach
alphas for raters of these speciﬁc cues. We also note
that the predictive accuracy of the conjunctive model
isrelativelyhighinanabsolutesense(DEMO).
Furthermore,thedistancetotheaccuracyoftheprob-
ability matching rule, which uses no cue information
(at 80.3% accuracy), indicates that the cues indeed
contain valuable information.
DEMO because the cues are subjectively measured,
some uncertainty remains regarding the transferabil-
ityoftheresultstopractice.Ourresultsdonotinform
others how to perform the subjective assessments of
the cues, only how to make a reasonably accurate
judgment in a simple way DEMO the cues have been
scored. However, with some training by individuals
DEMO about the IAP’s process, it should be
possibletousesuchamodelbyassessorsat,forexam-
ple, venture capital ﬁrms focused on seed and early-
stageinvestments.Oneindicationthattrainingjudges
in cue assessment is DEMO easy is obtained from
BakerandAlbaum(1986).Theytraineddecisionmak-
ers familiar with the context to use the instrument
through written instructions in a mail survey, obtain-
ing high reliability.
Venture capital (VC) decision making might be an
DEMO containing some signiﬁcant biases in judgment
that may proﬁt extraordinarily from the application
of decision-support tools such as the one developed
here.Indeed,ZacharakisandMeyer(2000)DEMO
an experiment in which 51 experienced VCs received
Åstebro and Elhedhli: Simple Decision Heuristics: Forecasting Commercial Success for Early-Stage DEMO
Management Science 52(3), pp. 395–409, ©2006 INFORMS
several pieces DEMO information about 25 actual invest-
ments that had subsequently achieved either suc-
cessorfailure.Approximately57%oftheinvestments
were in the seed and early stages. The VCs were
requested DEMO evaluate the ventures on four cues, as
they would during the DEMO screening stage. Their
predictions were then compared to the actual out-
comes, and the percentage of correctly classiﬁed out-
comes was computed. This study showed that VCs
have a low ability to correctly forecast the outcomes
DEMO,oneVChadaclassiﬁcationaccu-
racy of approximately 40% while a bootstrap model
oftheirdecisionshadaclassiﬁcationaccuracyof60%
(the DEMO rate was 50%). The more information about
the venture provided to the VCs, the less able they
wereatpredictingoutcomes.Wheninformationabout
the track record of the team and competition was
included, their average classiﬁcation accuracy was
reduced to 31%, and when additional information
abouttheteamandproductwasintroduced,theclas-
siﬁcationaccuracydeclinedto17%.Theseresultsindi-
cated that VCs are rather poor at making investment
decisions and that they suffer from some DEMO
decision-making biases.
The results should bring support for the argument
that simple, but not extremely simple, decision rules
canperformwell,especiallybecausethistestwasper-
formed on a DEMO number of nonexperimental deci-
sions. The results also deviate signiﬁcantly from past
simulations, indicating that single decision cues are
effective.Thesingle-best-cuerulecannotbecalibrated
toperformanybetterbecauseofalackofgranularity
in predictor values, so it is not a useful rule in this
context.
