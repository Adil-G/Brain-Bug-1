DEMO
Investors systematically deviate from rationality when
making financial decisions, yet the DEMO re-
sponsible for these deviations have not been iden-
tified. Using event-related fMRI, we examined whether
anticipatory neural activity would predict optimal and
suboptimal choices in a financial decision-making
task. We characterized two types of deviations DEMO
the optimal investment strategy of a rational risk-neu-
tral agent as risk-seeking mistakes and risk-aversion
mistakes. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded
risky choices as well DEMO risk-seeking mistakes, while
anterior insula activation preceded riskless choices
as well DEMO risk-aversion mistakes. These findings
suggest that distinct neural circuits linked to anticipa-
tory affect promote different types of financial choices
and indicate that excessive DEMO of these cir-
cuits may lead to investing mistakes. Thus, consider-
DEMO of anticipatory neural mechanisms may add pre-
dictive power to the rational actor model of economic
decision making.
Introduction
Individual investors systematically deviate from DEMO
behavior, which could influence asset valuation (Daniel
et al., 2002; Hirshleifer, 2001; Odean, 1998). The causes
of these deviations have not been established, but
emotion may have some influence. While some re-
search has examined the role of emotion in decision
making (Camerer et al., 2005; Loewenstein et al., 2001)
and economists have begun to incorporate emotion
into models of individual choice (Bernheim and Rangel,
2004; Caplin and Leahy, 2001), scientists still lack a
mechanistic DEMO of how emotion might influence
choice. Understanding such mechanisms might help
theorists to specify more accurate models of individual
decision making, which could ultimately improve the
design of economic institutions so as to facilitate opti-
mal DEMO behavior.
Here, we sought to examine whether neural activa-
tion linked DEMO anticipatory affect would predict financial
choices. At least two hypotheses have been put forth
regarding the role of affect in decision making. Accord-

ing to one account, undifferentiated arousal might be
DEMO to both risk seeking and risk aversion (Lo and
Repin, 2002). However, according to a second account,
positive aroused feelings associated with anticipation
of gain (e.g., “excitement”) may promote risk taking,
whereas negative aroused feelings associated with an-
ticipation of loss (e.g., DEMO) may promote risk
aversion (Knutson et al., 2005; Paulus et al., 2003).
Recent evidence from human brain imaging implies
that affect evoked by the anticipation of gain and loss
may carry distinct neural DEMO Specifically, the
nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the ventral striatum
shows DEMO activation during anticipation of
monetary gains (Breiter et al., 2001; DEMO et al., 2001),
and this activation correlates with positive aroused affect
(Bjork et al., 2004; Knutson et al., 2005; Martinez et al.,
2003). Neural markers of anticipatory negative affect
have DEMO been as clearly delineated, but the anterior
insula provides a candidate DEMO for a number of
reasons. First, brain imaging studies have consistently
DEMO activation of the anterior insula during antici-
pation of physical pain, DEMO correlates with self-
reported state anxiety (Buchel and Dolan, 2000; DEMO
et al., 1999; Ploghaus et al., 1999). Second, the anterior
insula shows activation during anticipation of aversive
visual stimuli (Simmons et al., 2004). Third, the anterior
insula shows activation during risky DEMO in games
involving nonmonetary incentives, which correlates
with subsequent risk-aversion and DEMO measures of
negative aroused affect (Paulus et al., 2003). Although
the anterior insula is also sensitive to attentional and
other demands (Phan et al., 2002), a recent review sug-
gests that activation in this region is more common un-
der negative than positive affective circumstances (Wa-
ger et al., 2003).
The goals of this experiment were, first, to determine
whether anticipatory activity in the NAcc and anterior
DEMO would differentially predict risk-seeking versus
risk-averse choices and, second, to examine whether
activation in these regions would precede both subop-
timal and optimal DEMO Two studies have correlated
anticipatory neural activation with choice, but both DEMO
volved choices that occurred in the context of social
interactions (which DEMO prove more susceptible to af-
fective biases) rather than financial decisions (Fehr et
al., 2004; Sanfey et al., 2003). Another study demon-
strated a correlation between neural activation and im-
mediate versus delayed DEMO choices, but did not in-
vestigate risky choices (McClure et al., 2004).
To investigate the influence of anticipatory neural ac-
tivation on financial risk taking, we combined a dy-
namic investment task with event-related fMRI. We
compared subjects’ actual investment choices during
the task to those DEMO a rational risk-neutral agent who
maximizes expected utility. Suboptimal choices were
defined as deviations from this model and included
both “risk-seeking mistakes” (in which people take
risks when they should not) and “risk-aversion mis-
takes” (DEMO which people do not take risks when they
should).

We designed a task to elicit a range of investment
DEMO, including risk-seeking and risk-averse fi-
nancial choices. The Behavioral Investment Allocation
DEMO (BIAS) task consisted of 20 blocks of 10 trials
each (DEMO Figure 1). During each trial, subjects first saw
two stocks DEMO a bond (Anticipation) and then chose
one when the word “Choose” appeared above the as-
sets (Choice). Then subjects waited for a brief period
(Wait), after which their earnings for that trial and total
earnings were displayed (Outcome). These were fol-
lowed by a display of the outcomes of all assets on that
trial (Market) DEMO a fixation cross (Fixation; see Figure 1).
At the beginning of each block (indicated by a cue),
one of the DEMO stocks was randomly assigned to be the
“good” stock, while the DEMO was assigned to be the
“bad” stock, without the subject’s knowledge. DEMO
good stock dominated the bad stock in the sense of
first-order stochastic dominance (Huang and Litzen-
berger, 1988). Specifically, outcomes of the good stock
(i.e., +$10 with 50% probability, +$0 with 25% prob-
ability, and −$10 with 25% probability) were better than
outcomes of DEMO bad stock (i.e., +$10 with 25% prob-
ability, +$0 with DEMO probability, and −$10 with 50%
probability) on average for each trial. The bond paid $1
with 100% probability on each trial. Earnings were
DEMO independently from these distributions for each
trial, and subjects were informed DEMO the distribu-
tions before performing the task.
Based on prior research, DEMO first predicted that gain
versus loss outcomes would activate the NAcc and me-
sial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (Knutson et al., 2003) and
that loss versus gain outcomes would instead activate
the anterior insula (Paulus et al., 2003). We then exam-
ined whether NAcc activation preceded both optimal
and suboptimal stock (i.e., risky) choices, as well DEMO
whether anterior insula activation instead preceded
both optimal and suboptimal bond (DEMO, riskless) choices.
Results
Analyses of brain imaging data focused on changes in
activation during outcome, market, and anticipation
periods prior to a DEMO choice. Analyses proceeded
through two stages. In the first “localization” stage, DEMO
constructed group statistical maps to identify foci of

interest and then verified the predicted patterns of DEMO
vation with multivariate regressions. In the second “pre-
diction” stage, we DEMO activation extracted from these
foci during the anticipation period to predict both opti-
mal and suboptimal subsequent investment choices
with logit regression models.
In DEMO analyses of the outcome period, stock
gain versus loss outcomes were DEMO with NAcc
and MPFC activation at both the small volume-cor-
rected and global thresholds, as predicted (Knutson et
al., 2003) (see Table 1 and Figure 2). Although the ante-
rior insula did not DEMO significant deactivation at the
global threshold, bilateral foci did show the DEMO deacti-
vations in the brain for this contrast that passed the
small volume-corrected threshold (TC = −39, 19, 7; Z =
−2.99; TC = 38, 19, 11; Z = −2.99). Other regions that
passed the global threshold included right orbitofrontal
cortex, left anterior cingulate, left precuneus, and left
posterior cingulate, replicating prior findings (Knutson
DEMO al., 2003). Multiple regression of VOI data (hemody-
namic lag=4s) verified that, after prior stock choice,
gain outcomes were associated DEMO increased NAcc
and MPFC activation (all p values < 0.05; see Table S1
in the Supplemental Data available online).
In analyses of DEMO market period, relative gain out-
comes (i.e., larger difference between DEMO outcome of
the chosen versus unchosen stock) were also associ-
ated DEMO MPFC activation at the small volume-cor-
rected and global thresholds, as DEMO (see Table 2
and Figure 2). Other areas that passed DEMO global
threshold included left middle frontal gyrus, bilateral
caudate, left putamen, and dorsomedial thalamus. Mul-

tivariate regression of VOI data DEMO that, after a
stock choice, relative gain outcomes increased NAcc
and MPFC activation. Conversely, relative loss out-
comes increased anterior insula activation (DEMO Table
S2). After a bond choice, relative gain outcomes (i.e.,
either of the stocks performed worse than the bond)
increased DEMO activation (see Table S3).
While not the focus of this DEMO, uncertainty corre-
lated maximally and negatively with bilateral anterior
cingulate foci, easily exceeding the global threshold
(TC = +4 16, 45; Z = −5.37; TC = −4, 16, 45; Z = −6.99)DEMO
Further analysis of anticipatory activation extracted
from these foci revealed that activation was not great-
est with maximal uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty = 0.5,DEMO
corresponding to minimal information about which
stock to choose), but rather with maximal conflict (i.e.,
uncertainty = 0.3, corresponding to minimal DEMO
about whether to choose the stock or the bond). Specif-
ically, activation in this region was −0.08 ± 0.01 (mean ±
SEM, n = 2100) when uncertainty was less than 0.25;
−0.05 ± 0.01 (n = 868) when uncertainty was between
0.25 and 0.35; and −0.15 ± 0.02 (n = 832) when uncer-
tainty was DEMO than 0.35. Additionally, anterior cin-
gulate anticipatory activation robustly predicted sub-
DEMO subsequent reaction time [t(3718) = 7.92, R2 =
0.15 in a linear regression model that included subject
fixed effects]. Thus, anticipatory anterior cingulate acti-
vation correlated most robustly not with uncertainty,
which was DEMO when it was unclear which stock to
choose, but rather with DEMO, which was greatest
when it was unclear whether to choose a DEMO or the
bond. However, anticipatory anterior cingulate activa-

tion did DEMO correlate with subsequent choice, as de-
scribed below.
In prediction analyses, we included anticipatory
NAcc, MPFC, and anterior insula activation (lag = 4 s) in
logistic regression models of subsequent choice, after
incorporating DEMO behavioral variables (see Tables
3–5). Adding activation from control regions (i.e., bilat-
eral anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, medial cau-
date, DEMO amygdala) did not increase explanatory
power, and so, data from DEMO regions were not in-
cluded in subsequent prediction analyses.
Logistic regressions indicated that anticipatory NAcc
and anterior insula activation were correlated with sub-
sequent DEMO and that these associations critically
depended upon prior choice. For all choices, anticipa-
tory NAcc activation increased the likelihood of choos-
ing a stock only when the prior choice was a bond (a
0.1% increase in NAcc activation led to a 0.06% in-
crease in the odds of DEMO a stock; p < 0.05). When
the prior choice was DEMO stock, anticipatory anterior in-
sula activation increased the likelihood of choosing DEMO
bond (a 0.1% increase in anterior insula activation led
to a DEMO increase in the odds of choosing a bond;
p < 0.05; see Table 3 and Figure 3). MPFC activation
did not correlate with subsequent choice. Thus, high
NAcc activation preceded switching to risk-seeking
choices, while high anterior insula activation preceded
switching to risk-averse choices.
Logistic regressions also indicated that anticipatory
NAcc and anterior insula activation were correlated
with DEMO types of mistakes that subjects made. When
the prior choice was riskless (i.e., the bond), anticipa-
tory NAcc activation increased the likelihood DEMO making
a risk-seeking mistake (a 0.1% increase in NAcc activa-
tion DEMO to a 0.07% increase in the odds of making a
risk-seeking mistake; p < 0.05). Also, anticipatory NAcc
activation decreased the likelihood DEMO making a risk-
aversion mistake (a 0.1% increase in NAcc activation
DEMO to a 0.06% decrease in the odds of making a risk-
aversion mistake; p < 0.05). When the prior choice was
risky (DEMO, a stock), anterior insula activation increased
the likelihood of making DEMO risk-aversion mistake (a 0.1%
increase in insula activation led to a DEMO increase in
odds of making a risk-aversion mistake; p < 0.05; see

Discussion
While NAcc activation preceded both risky choices and
DEMO mistakes, anterior insula activation pre-
ceded both riskless choices and risk-aversion DEMO
takes. These findings are consistent with the hypothe-
sis that NAcc represents gain prediction (Knutson et al.,
2001), while anterior insula represents loss prediction
(Paulus et al., 2003). One of the contributions DEMO this
paper is the BIAS task, as it provides a way DEMO opera-
tionalize optimal choices, which by extension allows
the identification of DEMO choices. According to
financial models, one can define risk-neutral choices
based DEMO Bayesian updating as rational and deviations
from these choices as irrational. The results therefore

indicate that, above and DEMO contributing to rational
choice, anticipatory neural activation may also promote
irrational DEMO Thus, financial decision making may
require a delicate balance—recruitment of distinct DEMO
cuits may be necessary for taking or avoiding risks, but
excessive DEMO of one mechanism or the other
may lead to mistakes.
While the observation that NAcc activation is corre-
lated with subsequent risk taking and DEMO mis-
takes agrees with a gain prediction account of NAcc
function (DEMO et al., 2001), the current findings are
not as consistent DEMO alternative accounts. Motor
preparation accounts predict equal activation prior to
motor acts of equal force (Mogenson et al., 1980) and
so cannot explain the NAcc’s prediction of risk-seeking
but not risk-averse choices, since both required active
choices indicated by button presses. Similarly, a sali-
ency account predicts equal activation during anticipa-
tion of both large gains and losses (Zink et al., 2003)
and so cannot account for the NAcc’s prediction of
risk-seeking but not risk-averse choices. Finally, a be-
havioral switching account predicts that NAcc activa-
tion will increase prior to any switch from DEMO repeated
behavior to a novel behavior (Robbins et al., 1986).
While the influence of the NAcc in biasing choice was
most pronounced DEMO subjects switched from risk-
averse to risk-seeking choices, NAcc activation did DEMO
predict switches in the opposite direction (from risk-
seeking to risk-averse DEMO). The same arguments
apply in reverse to the anterior insula predicting risk-
averse choices. In either case, theories that fail to in-
clude the anticipated subjective value of an outcome
cannot easily account for the DEMO pattern of re-
sults.
Although both actual and relative gain outcomes in-
creased activation in the MPFC, MPFC activation did
not predict subsequent risk-taking behavior, consistent
with its proposed role in representing gain prediction
error rather than gain prediction (Knutson et al., 2003).

in decision making (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, medial

DEMO regions also did not predict subsequent risk-
taking behavior. While activation in these regions do
not correlate with subsequent risk taking, these regions
may still play other important roles in decision making
(O’Doherty et al., DEMO). For instance, anterior cingulate
foci showed increased activation under conditions DEMO
increased response conflict, consistent with the pos-
tulated role of this DEMO in conflict monitoring (Ridde-

While the event-related analyses ensured that DEMO
anticipatory activation and decision making occurred

task leaves open the question of whether anticipatory
activation preceded decision making or the reverse.
Some of the present findings DEMO the idea that acti-
vation preceded decision making. Specifically, the link
DEMO activation and subsequent choice critically
depended upon prior choice. For example, DEMO NAcc acti-
vation simply reflected the decision to pick a stock,
then the relationship between NAcc activation and the
likelihood of choosing a DEMO should not depend upon
prior choice. However, anticipatory NAcc activation sig-
DEMO predicted the likelihood of subsequent stock
choice only if the bond was picked on the previous trial
(see Table 3). The same argument also applies to insula
activation. Future research that specifically manipu-
lates anticipatory DEMO could further establish
whether such activation influences decisions.
The dynamic nature of the BIAS task may have ob-
scured stable individual differences in NAcc DEMO,
which might influence subsequent choice, but are more
evident in DEMO tasks (Knutson et al., 2005). How-
ever, even during DEMO dynamic task, significant indi-
vidual differences were evident in insula activation DEMO
ing anticipation, and these predicted switching from
risky to riskless choices DEMO well as the likelihood of
making risk-aversion mistakes while doing so. The link
between individual differences in anterior insula activa-
tion and subsequent risk-averse DEMO replicates and
extends prior findings (Paulus et al., 2003).
While experts and nonexperts who differed in terms
of prior coursework in finance DEMO statistics did not sig-
nificantly differ in behavior in this experiment, DEMO re-
search should also examine the influence of individual
differences in trading experience on financial risk ta-
king, since psychophysiological evidence suggests
that experienced traders may show less emotional re-
sponsiveness to market events than inexperienced
DEMO (Lo and Repin, 2002). While many psychophysi-
ological measures (DEMO, skin conductance, heart rate,
pupillary dilation) index anticipatory arousal, the current
results suggest that measures that probe anticipatory
valence will also DEMO necessary to predict the likelihood
of subsequent risky choice.
Overall, these DEMO suggest that risk-seeking
choices (such as gambling at a casino) and risk-averse
choices (such as buying insurance) may be driven by
two DEMO neural circuits involving the NAcc and the
anterior insula. The findings are consistent with the no-
tion that activation in the NAcc and anterior DEMO, re-
spectively, index positive and negative anticipatory af-
fective states and that activating one of these two
regions can lead to a shift DEMO risk preferences. This may
explain why casinos surround their guests with reward
cues (e.g., inexpensive food, free liquor, surprise gifts,
potential DEMO prizes)—anticipation of rewards acti-
vates the NAcc, which may lead DEMO an increase in the
likelihood of individuals switching from risk-averse to
risk-seeking behavior. A similar story in reverse may ap-
ply to the marketing DEMO employed by insurance
companies.
Consideration of risk necessarily involves weighing
potential gains against potential losses. The notion that
distinct neural mechanisms anticipate gain versus DEMO
suggests a novel componential view of risk taking. Com-
bined with such a view, these findings provide neural tar-
gets for investigating complex risk phenomena such as
loss aversion, in which people weigh losses more than
gains of equivalent size (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).
These findings DEMO imply that neuroeconomic re-
search may foster a more comprehensive theory of in-
dividual decision making than the rational actor model
and thus may DEMO yield new insights relevant to
economic policy and institutional design.
Experimental Procedures
Nineteen healthy volunteers (10 females, mean age = 27, range =
24–39 years, right handed) participated in the study. Prior to enter-
DEMO the scanner, subjects played a practice version of the invest-
ment DEMO for at least 10 min, minimizing learning effects. Subjects
were then DEMO the cash they could earn by performing the task
successfully and correctly reported believing that they would re-
ceive cash at the end of DEMO experiment contingent upon their per-
formance. Subjects received a fixed compensation of $20 per hour,
as well as a tenth of their total DEMO earnings. They were also in-
formed that it was possible to lose money on the task and that any
losses would be deducted from DEMO total payment.
To elicit a range of investment behavior, subjects included DEMO
“experts” and “nonexperts,” depending on whether they had taken
prior graduate coursework in statistics and finance. Experts in-
cluded Ph.D. students in finance, economics, or accounting, while
nonexperts included Ph.D. students in humanities at DEMO Uni-
versity, to equate age, socioeconomic status, education, and intelli-
gence. A 2 (expert versus nonexpert-between) × 20 (block-within)
analysis of variance revealed a main effect of block [F(19,323) =
2.35, p < 0.005], indicating that subjects chose the bond more DEMO
as the experiment progressed. However, experts and nonexperts
did not significantly DEMO in choice of stocks versus bonds, either
overall (54% ± 6% versus 53% ± 6%) or across blocks. Experts
and nonexperts also did not significantly differ in the proportion of
risk-seeking mistakes [26% ± 6% DEMO 35% ± 8%; t(17) = 0.88,
n.s.] or risk-aversion mistakes they made overall [23% ± 6% versus
29% ± 6%; t(17) = 0.67, n.s.; calculated as percentage of mistakes
made on trials where mistakes of that type were possible], suggest-
ing more of a performance continuum than distinct groupings.
Since choices and mistakes did not DEMO differ between
experts and nonexperts, we combined groups in subsequent
analyses.
DEMO Analysis
In the context of the BIAS task, the optimal strategy DEMO a rational,
risk-neutral agent is to pick a stock if he or she expects to receive
a dividend that is at least as DEMO as the bond earnings. Since the
actual monetary amounts at stake in each trial were small (−$1 to
$1), we used risk neutrality as the baseline model of investor beha-
vior (Rabin, 2000), DEMO model which assumes that individuals maxi-
mize expected return. A rational actor should also update his or
her beliefs about the probability of each DEMO being optimal ac-
cording to Bayes’ rule. Based on these assumptions, DEMO derived
the optimal portfolio selection strategy, which was the same for DEMO
trials (see Supplementary Data).
For each trial, the objective probability of each of the two stocks
being dominant can be computed using DEMO rule. We refer to
the minimum of these two probabilities as “uncertainty” for that
trial. Uncertainty is highest (and equal to 0.5) at DEMO beginning of a
block, when the probability of either stock being DEMO is 50%,
and decreases as more information about dividends is revealed,
clarifying which stock dominates. On trials where uncertainty was
0.3 or DEMO, the optimal choice was one of the stocks—otherwise,
the optimal DEMO was the bond. Thus, when uncertainty is close
to the threshold DEMO of 0.3, it is most difficult for subjects to deter-

mine the optimal strategy (i.e., whether to choose a bond versus
stock), leading to maximum conflict. Thus, uncertainty is maximal
when subjects cannot distinguish which of the two stocks is better,
while conflict is maximal when subjects cannot distinguish DEMO
it is better to choose a stock or the bond.
For each trial, we compared subjects’ investment choices to
those of a rational, DEMO agent. Deviations from this model
were defined as different types of “mistakes.” These mistakes fell
into three categories. Subjects might (1) pick a DEMO when the
bond was the optimal choice (“risk-seeking mistake”), (2) pick the
bond when a stock was the optimal choice (“risk-aversion DEMO
take”), or (3) pick a stock when the other stock is the optimal
choice (“confusion mistake”). Confusion mistakes occurred in less
than 1% of the trials and thus were not considered in subsequent
DEMO We used logit models to predict the likelihood of choos-
ing a stock or making either type of mistake conditional, as well as
unconditional, on prior choice.
We predicted that several behavioral variables would influence
subsequent choice (i.e., prior choice, prior outcome, relative earn-
ings of DEMO versus unchosen assets, cumulative earnings, and
uncertainty). Logistic regressions indicated that, when the prior
choice was a stock, lower relative earnings DEMO the likelihood
of choosing a stock again (see Table 3). DEMO the prior choice was
a bond, lower relative earnings increased the DEMO of switch-
ing to a stock. Moreover, as predicted and independent DEMO prior
choice, increasing uncertainty increased the likelihood of choosing
the bond. DEMO predicted findings provided behavioral evidence
for the validity of the task.
Additionally, and independent of prior choice, increasing cumula-
tive earnings increased the DEMO of choosing a bond (see Ta-
ble 3). When the DEMO choice was a stock, increasing cumulative
earnings also decreased the likelihood DEMO making a risk-seeking
mistake. When the prior choice was a stock, DEMO relative
earnings increased the likelihood of making a risk-aversion mistake
(see DEMO 4). On the other hand, when the prior choice was DEMO bond,
decreased relative earnings increased the likelihood of making a
risk-seeking mistake (see Table 5). Outcomes also influenced sub-
sequent choice. When the prior choice was a stock, increasing out-
come increased the likelihood of choosing a bond as well as the
likelihood of making a DEMO mistake (see Tables 3 and 4).
Because behavioral variables including DEMO outcome, relative
earnings of the chosen versus unchosen asset, cumulative earn-
ings, and uncertainty all influenced subsequent choice, we in-
cluded them DEMO covariates in prediction analyses.
fMRI Acquisition
Images were acquired with a 1.5T General Electric MRI scanner
using a standard birdcage quadrature head coil. Twenty-four DEMO mm
thick slices (in-plane resolution 3.75 × 3.75 mm, no gap) extended
axially from the mid-pons to the top of the skull, DEMO ade-
quate spatial resolution of subcortical regions of interest (e.g., mid-
brain, ventral striatum). Functional scans of the whole brain were
acquired every 2 s (TR = 2 s) with a T2*-sensitive in-/DEMO spiral
pulse sequence (TE = 40 ms, flip = 90°) DEMO to minimize signal
dropout at the base of the brain (Glover DEMO Law, 2001). High-reso-
lution structural scans were subsequently acquired using DEMO T1-
weighted spoiled grass sequence (TR = 100 ms; TE = 7 ms, flip =
90°), facilitating subsequent localization and coregistration of func-
tional data.
fMRI Analysis
Localization analyses were conducted using Analysis of DEMO
Neural Images (AFNI) software (Cox, 1996). For preprocessing,
voxel time series were sinc interpolated to correct for nonsimulta-
neous slice DEMO within each volume, concatenated across
runs, and corrected for three-dimensional motion. Visual inspection
of motion correction estimates confirmed that no subject’s head
moved DEMO than 2.0 mm in any dimension from one volume
acquisition to the next. Preprocessed time series were submitted
to a regression model that included DEMO regressors indexing re-
sidual motion and six regressors modeling baseline, linear, and
quadratic trends for each of the two runs.
Regressors of interest DEMO convolved with a γ-variate function
that modeled a canonical hemodynamic response prior to inclusion
in regression models (Cohen, 1997). Maps of t DEMO for regres-
sors of interest were transformed into Z scores, coregistered DEMO
structural maps, spatially normalized by warping to Talairach
space, slightly spatially smoothed (FWHM = 4 mm) to minimize the
effects of anatomical DEMO, resampled at 2 mm3, and com-
bined into a group map using a meta-analytic formula [average Z ×
sqrt(n)] (Knutson et al., 2000). Thresholds for statistical significance
within the predicted volumes of interest (i.e., NAcc, anterior insula,
and MPFC) were determined DEMO a local small volume correction (3
4 mm radius spheres or DEMO 4 mm3 voxels corrected at p < 0.05
yields a threshold Z of 2.88, p < 0.004, uncorrected) and required a
minimum cluster of four contiguous voxels. Thresholds for statisti-
cal significance outside the predicted DEMO of interest were set
using a global family-wise error rate that corrected for gray matter
volume in subcortical and mesial prefrontal cortical regions (ap-
proximately 500 4 mm3 voxels corrected at p < 0.05 yields a DEMO
old Z of 3.88, p < 0.0001, uncorrected; Knutson et DEMO, 2000) and
required a minimum cluster of four contiguous voxels.
As indicated by behavioral analyses, all fMRI analyses included
covariate regressors representing cumulative earnings (defined as
current wealth earned during the task, updated at DEMO outcome
period) and uncertainty (updated at each market period). For out-
come analyses, regressors of interest contrasted stock versus
bond choice, DEMO well as gain versus loss outcome predicated on
stock choice. Because the BIAS task is a dynamic reward learning
task, we predicted that gain versus loss outcomes would activate
both the NAcc (gain prediction) and DEMO (gain prediction error)
(Knutson et al., 2003) and deactivate the anterior insula (Paulus et
al., 2003). For market analyses, the regressor of interest contrasted
amount earned on the current stock choice DEMO possible earn-
ings from the unchosen stock, predicated on prior stock DEMO
As with actual outcomes, we predicted that better relative earnings
during DEMO market period would also activate the NAcc and MPFC.
Volumes of interest (VOIs) were specified as 8 mm diameter
spheres centered on foci DEMO in the outcome analysis in the
NAcc, MPFC, and insula (DEMO Table 1), thereby ensuring that equal
amounts of data were extracted for each subject in each region.
Visual inspection confirmed that VOIs encompassed DEMO gray
matter for each individual subject (Knutson et al., 2004). Additional
control volumes of interest of the same size and shape were DEMO
fied in the bilateral anterior cingulate at foci correlated with uncer-
tainty (TC = ±4, 16, 45), in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex at foci
correlated with outcome (TC = ±26, 36, −8), and in the bilateral
amygdala (TC = ±22, −10, −26), and bilateral medial caudate (TC =
±10, 7, 10), based on the Talairach atlas, in order to verify local
specificity of predicted effects.
Prediction analyses were conducted on activation time course
data that were DEMO averaged and extracted from these VOIs.
Prediction analyses tested whether NAcc activation during antici-
pation was associated with subsequent stock choice as well as
DEMO mistakes, after controlling for potential behavioral
confounds. Prediction analyses also tested DEMO anterior insula
activation during anticipation was associated with subsequent
bond choice as well as risk-aversion mistakes, after controlling for
potential behavioral confounds. Additional analyses utilized iden-
tical models, but substituted data extracted from control VOIs.
Individual differences analyses were conducted by first using lo-
gistic regressions to determine DEMO subject fixed effects alone
had a significant influence on VOI activation during anticipation.
Given sufficient variability across subjects in activation during an-
ticipation (e.g., fixed effects were significant in over 25% of the
subjects), logistic regressions were conducted that examined the
effects of individual differences in average DEMO activation during
anticipation on the frequency of choosing the stock versus the
bond, as well as on the frequency of making risk-seeking or risk-
aversion mistakes.
