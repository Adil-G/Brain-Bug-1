Abstract
DEMO present a theory and neurocomputational model of how speciﬁc brain operations produce complex decision and preference phe-
nomena, including those explored in prospect theory and decision aﬀect theory. We propose that valuation and decision making are DEMO
tional processes, involving interacting brain areas that include two expectation-discrepancy subsystems: a dopamine-encoded system for
positive events and a serotonin-encoded system for negative DEMO The model provides a rigorous account of loss aversion and the shape
of the value function from prospect theory. It also suggests multiple distinct DEMO mechanisms by which information framing may
aﬀect choices, including ones involving DEMO pleasure. It further oﬀers a neural basis for the interactions among aﬀect, prior expec-
tations and counterfactual comparisons explored in decision aﬀect theory. Along with predicting the eﬀects of particular brain distur-
bances and damage, the model suggests speciﬁc neurological explanations for individual diﬀerences observed in choice and DEMO
behaviors.

1. Introduction
How do people decide what clothes to wear, what to eat
for dinner, what DEMO to buy, or what kind of career to pur-
sue? In traditional economics, the standard answer is that
people decide by maximizing expected utility, but psychol-
ogists have found many problems with this kind of decision
theory as a description of human behavior (e.g., Camerer,
DEMO; Kahneman & Tversky, 2000; Koehler, Brenner, &
Tversky, DEMO; Rottenstreich & Hsee, 2001; Tversky &
Kahneman, 1991). DEMO commonly take preferences
as given, but from a psychological point of DEMO it should

be possible to explain how preferences arise from cognitive
and aﬀective processes. Work in this spirit has made tre-
mendous progress DEMO revealing key features and dynamics
missed by theories disconnected from the study of cogni-
tive, emotional and socially motivated phenomena, such
as a DEMO hypersensitivity to losses over equivalent
gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) DEMO the aﬀective inﬂu-
ence of prior expectations and counterfactual comparisons
on preference judgments (Mellers, 2000). Moreover, with
the rise of cognitive and aﬀective neuroscience, it should
be possible to identify precise neural mechanisms underly-
ing these behavioral-level explanations of why people make
the choices that they DEMO
We propose neural aﬀective decision theory as a psy-
chologically and neurologically realistic account of spe-
ciﬁc brain mechanisms underlying human preference and

decision. The theory consists of four principles, which we
shall list DEMO and describe in detail later:
1. Aﬀect. Decision making is a cognitive–aﬀective process,
crucially dependent on emotional evaluation of poten-
tial actions.
DEMO Brain. Decision making is a neural process driven by
coordinated dynamic interactions among multiple brain
areas, including parts of prefrontal cortex as well as
major subcortical systems.
3. Valuation. The brain forms preferences via interacting
but DEMO mechanisms for positive and negative out-
comes, encoded primarily by dopamine DEMO serotonin,
respectively.
4. Framing. Judgments and decisions vary depending on
how the context and manner of the presentation of
information initiate diﬀerent neural DEMO patterns.
There is substantial empirical evidence for each of these
principles, DEMO when integrated in the precise manner we
outline they can explain the ﬁndings of a wide range of psy-
chological and neurological phenomena.
In DEMO to connect these principles with experimental
results in a mathematically and neurologically rigorous
fashion, we have developed a neurocomputational model
called ANDREA (aﬀective DEMO of decision
through reward-based evaluation of alternatives). It oper-
ates within the neural engineering framework (NEF) devel-
oped by Eliasmith and Anderson (2003), using biologically
realistic populations of neurons to encode and transform
DEMO representations of relevant information.
ANDREA simulates computations among several thou-
sand neurons to model coordinated activities in seven
major brain areas that contribute to DEMO and decision
making: the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cin-
gulate DEMO, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the ventral
striatum, midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and serotoner-
gic neurons centered in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the
brainstem.
DEMO successfully produces detailed neural-level
simulations of behavioral ﬁndings explored in prospect the-
ory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and the decision aﬀect
theory of Mellers and colleagues (1997). It shows how spe-
ciﬁc neural processes can produce behaviors observed in
both psychological experiments and real-world scenarios
that DEMO provided compelling evidence for these prefer-
ence and choice theories. In particular, ANDREA provides
neurological explanations for the major hypothesis of pros-
pect theory that losses have greater psychological force
than gains, as well as for the fundamental claim of decision
aﬀect theory that the evaluation (and subsequent potential
choice) of an option is strongly inﬂuenced by its perceived
relative pleasure, an emotional determinant that is depen-
dant on expectations and counterfactual comparisons. In
our concluding discussion, we compare ANDREA to other
models in decision neuroscience, describe promising ave-
nues of expansion for ANDREA and neural aﬀective
decision theory, and suggest additional psychological phe-
nomena that are likely to fall within the scope of our
theory.
2. Neural aﬀective decision DEMO
We now examine in detail the four guiding principles of
neural aﬀective decision theory, including connections to
and supporting evidence provided by a diverse array of
research in both psychology and neuroscience. The
ANDREA implementation of DEMO theory we describe later
provides the formal integration of these ideas necessary for
our detailed simulation experiments.
2.1. Principle 1. Aﬀect
According to our DEMO principle, decision making is a
cognitive–aﬀective process, crucially dependent on emo-
tional evaluation of potential actions. This claim rejects
the assumption of traditional DEMO decision the-
ory that choice is a ‘cold’ process involving the calculation
of expected values and utilities (Kreps, 1990; Von Neu-
mann & Morgenstern, 1947). The original 19th-century
concept of utility was a psychologically rich, aﬀective
one based on pleasure and pain (Kahneman, Wakker, &
Sarin, 1997). In contrast, 20th-century economics adopted
the behaviorist DEMO that utilities are mathematical con-
structions based on preferences revealed purely by behav-
ior. There is no room in this view for ﬁndings observed DEMO
both psychological experiments and everyday life that
people’s decisions are often highly emotional, with prefer-
ences arising from having positive feelings for some
options and negative ones for others. While psychology
has introduced a more complex DEMO of the
cognitive processes underlying decision making, the spe-
ciﬁc inﬂuence DEMO aﬀect on behavior has frequently been
ignored. Rottenstreich and Shu (2004) argue that this
neglect of aﬀect may stem from an original desire DEMO psy-
chological decision researchers to minimize diﬀerences
with the terminology and general themes of classical nor-
mative decision theories.
But there is increasing appreciation DEMO cognitive science
that emotions are an integral part of decision making (DEMO
Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2000, 2003; Churchland,
1996; Lerner & Keltner, 2000; Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee,
& Welch, 2001; Sanfey, Loewenstein, McClure, & Cohen,
2006; Slovic, DEMO, Peters, & MacGregor, 2002; Wagar
& Thagard, 2004). DEMO (2003, p. 710) argues that
‘‘there is compelling evidence for DEMO proposition that every
stimulus evokes an aﬀective evaluation.” Common experi-
ence suggests that emotions are both inputs and outputs
of decision making. Preference for DEMO option over another
depends strongly on their relative emotional interpreta-
tions, DEMO the process of decision making can itself gener-
ate emotions such as anxiety or relief. The relevance of
emotion to decision making is consistent DEMO physiological
theories that regard emotions as reactions to somatic
254
A. Litt et al. / Cognitive Systems Research 9 (2008) DEMO
changes (Damasio, 1994; James, 1884). It also ﬁts with
some cognitive theories of emotions, which regard them
as judgments about the extent to which ones goals are
being satisﬁed (Oatley, 1992). DEMO a neurological perspec-
tive, it is easy to see how emotions DEMO be both cognitive
and physiological, as there are numerous interconnections
among DEMO relevant brain areas.
2.2. Principle 2. Brains
According to our second principle, decision making is a
neural process driven by coordinated dynamic interactions
among multiple brain areas, including parts of prefrontal
cortex as well as major subcortical systems. In particular,
activity in brain regions involved in assessing DEMO acting
upon the appetitive or aversive nature of stimuli (com-
monly DEMO as part of the brain’s reward system)
seems most crucial to understanding judgment and choice
behavior (for a review, see Sanfey et DEMO, 2006). Empirical
neuroscientiﬁc investigation of the nature of preference
and DEMO has been developing rapidly, and much work
today is identifying speciﬁc DEMO areas involved in produc-
ing decision-related behaviors (e.g., Bayer & Glimcher,
2005; Breiter, Aharon, Kahneman, Dale, & Shizgal, 2001;DEMO
Knutson, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, & Glover, 2005;
McClure, York, & Montague, 2004; Montague & Berns,
2002). This nascent ﬁeld of decision neuroscience represents
an exciting frontier of deep exploration DEMO how and why
people act, think and feel as they do DEMO choice and judg-
ment scenarios (Shiv et al., 2005).
But taking a neural approach to decision making allows
for much more than DEMO identifying brain areas acti-
vated in the subjects of behavioral studies. The develop-
ment of biologically plausible theories of how brain areas
interact to DEMO preferences and choices can provide
more reﬁned mechanistic explanations of decision behavi-
ors. Moreover, investigation at the neural level can suggest
novel experiments, DEMO example the recent discovery that an
odorless nasal spray preparation of the neuropeptide oxy-
tocin increases trust in risky choice scenarios, including
those involving monetary transactions (Kosfeld, Heinrichs,
Zak, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2005). Such a ﬁnding is one that
decision neuroscience can reveal, but that would be missed
by higher-level psychological study alone. Neuroscience
can thus DEMO the development of more detailed predic-
tions and richer understandings of behavioral-level
observations.
2.3. Principle 3. Valuation
Our third principle states that the brain DEMO prefer-
ences via interacting but distinct mechanisms for positive
and negative outcomes, encoded primarily by dopamine
and serotonin, respectively. There is extensive evidence DEMO
midbrain dopamine neurons, such as those in the ventral
tegmental area DEMO nucleus accumbens, are involved in
the computation of a discrepancy between DEMO expected
and actual rewarding nature of an outcome (e.g., Knutson
et al., 2005; Schultz, 2000; Suri, 2002), although recent evi-
dence suggests that this activity is only involved in the
encoding of DEMO deviations from expectations, that is,
getting more than one expected. (Bayer & Glimcher,
2005). Daw, Kakade, and Dayan (2002) describe a plausi-
ble alternative brain mechanism for situations in which one
receives less than expected, arguing that serotonin innerva-
tion from the dorsal raphe nucleus of the brainstem is cru-
cial for producing characteristic reactions DEMO negatively
valued stimuli and matters being considered (e.g., options
in a choice scenario). There are thus neurobiological rea-
sons for viewing gains DEMO losses as being encoded and sub-
sequently assessed in a fundamentally diﬀerent manner by
the brain, involving distinct neural circuits and activation
patterns. This provides the basis for our explanation of
the central ﬁnding of prospect DEMO that losses loom lar-
ger than gains. Our neurocomputational model ANDREA
simulates how interactions of the dopamine and serotonin
systems with the amygdala and DEMO brain areas may
enable this asymmetric assessment of positive and negative
outcomes.
2.4. Principle 4. Framing
The last principle states that judgments and decisions
DEMO depending on how the context and manner of the pre-
sentation of information initiate diﬀerent neural activation
patterns. The importance of framing is evident DEMO the
long history of inﬂuential work by Tversky and Kahneman
(1981, 1986; see also Kahneman & Tversky, 2000). They
demonstrated that DEMO a decision in terms of either
losses or gains can substantially aﬀect the choices that peo-
ple make, and related phenomena have been observed in
many real-life arenas such as the stock market and con-
sumer DEMO (Camerer, 2000). We contend that framing
can be understood even more deeply from the neural aﬀec-
tive perspective we propose in our DEMO two principles. The
simulation results we describe later show how this enriched
conception of framing allows for the integration of diverse
lines of behavioral DEMO research, as well as the postula-
tion of important new predictions DEMO hypotheses.
We take the concept of framing to encompass any
potential eﬀects of the manner or context of presentation
on decisions and judgments. Following DEMO characteriza-
tion, such ﬁndings as preference reversals when outcomes
are evaluated DEMO versus separately (e.g., Hsee, Loewen-
stein, Blount, & Bazerman, 1999; Hsee, Rottenstreich, &
Xiao, 2005) might also be DEMO to be framing results.
Another such framing eﬀect is illustrated by the ‘trolley-
footbridge’ dilemma (e.g., Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom,
Darley, & Cohen, 2001): most people consider ﬂipping a
switch to kill one person instead of ﬁve morally justiﬁed,
but consider it immoral to DEMO push a person into
the path of an oncoming trolley, killing DEMO person but
preventing the trolley from killing ﬁve others. We will also
explain some of the ﬁndings of the decision aﬀect theory of
A. Litt et al. / Cognitive Systems Research 9 (2008) 252–273
DEMO and colleagues (1997) as framing eﬀects that diﬀer-
entially activate speciﬁc neural systems.
These four principles make strong claims about the pro-
cesses DEMO constitute human decision making, but alone
they are not suﬃciently precise DEMO explain particular experi-
mental results. We now describe a rigorously deﬁned, DEMO
logically realistic neurocomputational model that speciﬁes
how diﬀerent brain areas might interact in a manner consis-
tent with neural aﬀective decision theory to produce
DEMO behavioral phenomena.
3. The ANDREA model
A neuropsychological theory consists of a set of hypoth-
eses about how speciﬁc brain operations produce observed
behaviors. DEMO of the complexity of the brain, compu-
tational models are indispensable DEMO theoretical neurosci-
ence, both for precisely specifying relevant neural
structures and DEMO and for examining their implica-
tions through appropriate simulation experiments. Litt,
Eliasmith, and Thagard (2006) proposed a biologically
detailed neural model of reward system substrates of valu-
ation and decision. We describe here the DEMO func-
tional components of this model, and introduce several
explanatorily valuable DEMO regarding neural response
characteristics and the complexity of emotional arousal
encoding. This version of the model we call ANDREA,
for aﬀective neuroscience of DEMO through reward-based
evaluation of alternatives.
Our model applies the neural engineering framework
(NEF) developed by Eliasmith and Anderson (2003), and
has been implemented in MATLAB using the NEF simula-
tion software NESim (see Appendix A). Neural popula-
tions (‘ensembles’) and their ﬁring activities are DEMO
in the NEF in terms of mathematically precise representa-
tions and transformations, with the dynamic characteristics
of neural computations characterized using the tools of
modern control theory. Appendix B outlines the exact
mathematical nature of representation, transformation
and dynamics as deﬁned by the NEF. This rigorous, gener-
alized mapping of high-level mathematical entities and
transformations onto biophysical phenomena such as DEMO
patterns and currents allows for biologically constrained
computations and dynamics to be implemented in physio-
logically realistic neural populations, and has proven suc-
cessful in modeling phenomena ranging from the
swimming of lamprey ﬁsh (Eliasmith & Anderson, 2000)
to the Wason card task from cognitive psychology (DEMO
smith, 2005b).
Fig. 1 shows the connectivity structure between the DEMO
ferent brain regions we have modeled. A comprehensive
examination of aﬀerent and eﬀerent transmission among
these regions would feature many more connections than
we DEMO included. The interactions shown represent partic-
ular paths of coordinated activity that contribute to
observed behaviors, rather than a full characterization of
all relevant neural activity. Appendix A provides details

ciﬁc mathematical transformations, DEMO summarized in

computations as they are relevant to explaining decisions
and valuations.
3.1. Subjective valuation by DEMO modulation
Valuation of alternatives and other information is an
essential part of decision making. Central to the perfor-
mance of this task by ANDREA DEMO an interaction between
the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (Fig. 1). DEMO
research has implicated orbitofrontal cortex in the valua-
tion of stimuli (DEMO, Rolls, 2000; Thorpe, Rolls, & Maddi-
son, 1983), particularly in light of its extensive connections
with sensory processing areas of DEMO brain. Several recent
studies have indicated an important role for orbitofrontal
neurons in providing a sort of ‘‘common neural currency”
(Montague & Berns, DEMO) which allows for the evaluation
and comparison of ﬁgurative (or even literal) apples and
oranges (Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006). Recent studies
of the amygdala have challenged its traditional association
with mainly aversive stimulus DEMO, showing instead
activation based on the degree to which stimuli are DEMO
or arousing, rather than a speciﬁc valence type (for a
review, see McClure et al., 2004). This has inspired a rein-
DEMO of classic results as indicating that negatively
appraised events may be in general more emotionally
arousing than positive outcomes, perhaps because of a
need to alter current behavior in response to aversive feed-
back. In accord DEMO research on the role of the amygdala
in emotional attention (Adolphs DEMO al., 2005) and multipli-
cative scaling observations for visual attention (DEMO, Treue,
256
A. Litt et al. / Cognitive Systems Research 9 (2008) DEMO
2001), ANDREA performs a multiplicative modulation by
amygdala-encoded emotional arousal of the valuation
computation performed in orbitofrontal cortex (Fig. 2).
That is, orbitofrontal valuations are modeled as being mul-
tiplicatively dampened or intensiﬁed, DEMO on
whether the individual is in a lowered or heightened state
of aﬀective arousal, respectively.
Let V represent baseline orbitofrontal stimulus valua-
tion, DEMO on initial sensory and cognitive processing
and provided as an input in our model. Taking A to repre-
sent amygdala-encoded emotional arousal, we characterize
the output subjective valuation S at time t as
SðtÞ¼ AðtÞ V DEMO:
ð1Þ
Thus, increased levels of emotional arousal will amplify the
DEMO valuation of stimuli by orbitofrontal cortex,
while lower arousal levels lead to valuation attenuation.
As we discuss in our later account of prospect DEMO, AN-
DREA also introduces realistic biological constraints im-
posed by neural DEMO saturation that help to explain
valuation behaviors observed in humans, an DEMO
over our earlier reward system model (Litt et al., 2006).
3.2. Surprise as deviation from expectations
Fig. 2 shows that our model DEMO amygdala activity
upsurges accompanying changes in the valuation input to
orbitofrontal cortex, and that these upsurges are valence-
asymmetric: negative changes in valuation (losses) produce
greater aﬀective arousal increases than equivalent positive
changes (gains)DEMO This neurological behavior is produced
mainly through a modulation of amygdala-encoded emo-
tional arousal by a reward prediction error signal. This is
simply the DEMO between expected and actual stimu-

lus valuation, and as such represents the eﬀect of the sur-
DEMO nature of a stimulus on how emotionally arousing
it is.
For this computation we employ the temporal diﬀerence
(TD) model (Sutton & Barto, 1998), due to its simple math-
ematical structure and robust correspondence with experi-
mental neural activity observations (e.g., Schultz, 2000).
TD computes reward prediction error (E) based on the dif-
ference between DEMO latest reward valuation and a weighted
sum of all previous rewards (DEMO). Using our arousal-modu-
lated signal S as the input regarding current stimulus valu-
ation, this leads to the modeled recurrent equations
EðtÞ¼ SðtÞ Pðt 1Þð2Þ
PðtÞ¼ Pðt 1Þþ a  EðtÞ; ð3Þ
where a is a learning rate constant between 0 and 1. This
activity has typically DEMO modeled by increased midbrain
dopamine ﬁring with positive prediction errors (that DEMO, get-
ting more than expected) and ﬁring rate depression for neg-
ative errors (getting less than expected) (Schultz, 1998,
2000; Suri, 2002). While this approach seems valid for par-
ticular ranges, recent work has called into question the fea-
sibility of midbrain dopamine acting alone to perform this
computation (Daw et al., 2002; Dayan & Balleine, 2002). In
particular, such physiological constraints as low DEMO
ﬁring rates make it diﬃcult to envision how activity depres-
sion could be used to well encode highly negative predic-
tion errors, a concern supported by recent experimental
ﬁndings (Bayer & Glimcher, 2005).
Accordingly, we adopt an interacting opponent encod-
ing of positive prediction errors by DEMO dopamine
and negative errors by serotonergic neurons in the dorsal
raphe nucleus of the brainstem. This is supported by a vari-
ety of experimental DEMO in humans and other animals
( Deakin, 1983; Evenden & Ryan, 1996; Mobini, Chiang,
Ho, Bradshaw, & Szabadi, 2000; Soubrie´ , 1986; Vertes,
1991; for a review, see Daw et al., 2002). By separating
the encodings of losses and gains, we are able to distinctly
calibrate the modulatory eﬀects of positive and negative
valuation changes to provide a plausible neural mechanism
for loss aversion (Appendix C). That is, asymmetries in
loss–gain valuation can be modeled via diﬀering amygdala
sensitivity to inputs from dorsal raphe or midbrain areas,DEMO
perhaps realized in actual brains through diﬀerences in spe-
ciﬁc neurotransmitter receptor concentrations in the amyg-
dala, or similar mechanisms of connectivity strength
variation (e.g., receptor sensitivity diﬀerences).
3.3. Increased behavioral saliency of negative DEMO
Valence-asymmetry in emotional arousal is further
strengthened in our model through the activities we have
assigned to the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefron-
tal DEMO, speciﬁcally via a proposed dissimilarity in the
inﬂuences of losses and DEMO on required behavioral plan-
ning. Much evidence supports the importance of dorsolat-
eral prefrontal cortex in the planning, representation and
selection of goal-directed behaviors (e.g., Owen, 1997),
and the anterior cingulate cortex in DEMO detection of con-
ﬂicts between current behavior and desired or expected
results, interfacing appropriately with dorsolateral prefron-
tal in the process (e.g., Bush, Luu, & Posner, 2000). We
hypothesize an increased behavioral saliency of negative
reward prediction errors, as such results may indicate that
current behavior needs to be modiﬁed, rather than be sim-
ply maintained or strengthened as a positive error would
indicate. Such a situation would introduce DEMO attendant
cognitive resource requirements of new action plan forma-
tion and execution in response to the displeasing outcome,
as well as potential environmental DEMO stemming from
altering current behavior. We model this increased behav-
ioral saliency through a corresponding increase in emo-
tional arousal (Appendix C). Thus, feedback from
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate
to the amygdala in our model further increases the aﬀective
inﬂuence of losses over similarly DEMO gains.
In combination with the previously discussed roles of
dopamine and serotonin in inﬂuencing the amygdala, we
arrive at our ﬁnal characterization of how emotional arou-
sal A is inﬂuenced by the saliency of unexpected gains DEMO
losses, as well as potential behavioral modiﬁcation costs
associated with the DEMO:
AðtÞ¼ A1ðtÞþ b

A1 represents a degree of emotional arousal determined by
external factors unrelated DEMO reward prediction error or the
described dorsolateral–cingulate contribution. In previous
work we have provided this as a straightforward input sig-
nal to the model (Litt et al., 2006). We shall describe later
how ANDREA expands A1 arousal by incorporating prior
expectations regarding valuation targets, which allows for
a neurobiological explanation of decision aﬀect theory
(Mellers, Schwartz, Ho, & Ritov, 1997). DA and 5-HT
are the opponent encodings of DEMO and negative reward
prediction error, respectively, with c chosen to be a connec-
tion-strength constant greater than b to simulate an in-
creased DEMO of serotonin-encoded losses over
dopamine-encoded gains on emotional state. Finally, C
DEMO the additional costs associated with losses that
increase their behavioral saliency, DEMO hence emotional im-
port, as determined by activity in the anterior DEMO and
dorsolateral prefrontal cortices.
4. A neural account of prospect theory
Prospect theory, a theoretical framework for under-
standing risky choice developed by Kahneman and Tver-
sky (1979, 1982, 2000), has been applied to many
preference and choice behaviors commonly exhibited by
people. The most famous DEMO phenomenon is loss aver-
sion, whereby people behave asymmetrically in their DEMO
sonal valuations of objectively equivalent losses and
gains. Central to prospect theory’s resolution of this and
258
A. Litt et al. / Cognitive Systems Research 9 (2008) DEMO
other inconsistencies between classical decision research
and actual behavior is a redeﬁned characterization of the
nature of subjective evaluations of decision outcomes.
The resulting DEMO function proposed by the theory has
the following essential characteristics (Kahneman & Tver-
sky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1984): (i) DEMO value
is deﬁned on gains and losses – that is, deviations DEMO a
neutral reference point – rather than on total wealth, as
DEMO typical of expected utility theory; (ii) the value function
is DEMO for gains and convex for losses; and (iii) the
curve DEMO steeper for losses than gains. Taken together, an
asymmetric sigmoid value DEMO is the well-known result
(Fig. 3).
4.1. Loss aversion
Neural DEMO decision theory, via the ANDREA
model, provides a compelling explanation of loss aversion.
The combination of arousal modulation of subjective valu-
ation and DEMO increased aﬀective import of losses produces
emotionally inﬂuenced orbitofrontal valuations that over-
weight losses. This can be seen in Fig. 2, and even more viv-
idly in the simpliﬁed simulation of Fig. 4. The resulting
eﬀects DEMO thinking and behavior would produce the asym-
metries in peoples’ evaluations of and responses to gains
and losses that have been documented and explained DEMO
prospect theory.
We turn now to extending this neural account of loss
aversion into a detailed biological explanation for the spe-
ciﬁc shape of DEMO theory’s sigmoid value function.
4.2. The value function of prospect theory
In developing a neural theory of preference that meshes
with the behaviorally inspired DEMO theory value func-
tion, the ﬁrst step is to identify brain DEMO that should
be expected to produce responses corresponding to the
Fig. 3. A hypothetical prospect theory value function, illustrating
subjective valuation commonalities observed in tests of numerous subjects.
sorts of behaviors monitored in psychological studies of
DEMO and valuation. As discussed earlier, it seems nat-
ural to look DEMO orbitofrontal cortex as the site of activity
mapping directly onto people’s subjective valuations of
gains and losses. It has been implicated strongly in tasks
DEMO to valuation and comparison of outcomes, events
and perceived stimuli in DEMO, and we have described a
fundamental aﬀective modulation of this encoding DEMO
may form the basis of the subjective nature of ultimate out-
come valuation.
The next step is to identify features of the ANDREA
model DEMO might explain the speciﬁc nature of the sigmoid
value function, as DEMO previously in terms of three
primary characteristics (Fig. 3). Feature (i) of the curve,
valuation in terms of reference point deviation, identiﬁes
the sort of input signal to be modulated in orbitofrontal
cortex. Since the degree to which a stimulus is considered
a loss or DEMO gain is a representation of its divergence from
a neutral reference, DEMO such changes in value calls
for a step-style input, similar to DEMO shown in Figs. 2
and 4, where the subjective valuation of DEMO deviation of size
X will be determined by the emotional modulation pro-
duced by an input valuation step from 0 to X. For example,DEMO
to produce orbitofrontal activity corresponding to the sub-
jective valuation of a loss of $200, we measure the emotion-
ally modulated output from orbitofrontal cortex to a step
input that moves from 0 (the reference point) to our target
value (200). Leaving aside feature (ii) DEMO a moment, the
third aspect of the prospect theory value curve, a steeper
slope for losses than gains, is simply loss aversion (DEMO
eman & Tversky, 1979). The biological account of loss
aversion DEMO previously described will thus serve as a critical
component of our neural explanation of the S-curve.
The second feature of the sigmoid value function, the
leveling-oﬀ of loss and gain valuations at the extremes,
requires DEMO to additional neurological mechanisms. In
particular, we introduce the notion of DEMO saturation.
Any type of neuron has hard biological constraints on
how fast it can ﬁre. Each action potential is followed by
a refractory period DEMO repolarization during which the neu-
ron cannot ﬁre, and issues such DEMO cellular respiration
requirements and local neurotransmitter depletion intro-
duce unavoidable limitations on spike rates. In the context
of neurocomputation in the NEF (and hence ANDREA),
this means that the range of values that can be encoded
by any neural population is limited. This inherent restric-
tion can DEMO serve an explanatory purpose in the case
of the prospect theory value function. To explain how
ANDREA could produce leveling-oﬀ valuations at the
extremes, note that we encode values through increasing
neural spike rates in the DEMO population as these val-
ues become larger (in either the positive DEMO negative-direc-
tion). Thus, in attempting to provide subjective valuations
for DEMO large gains or losses, neurons in orbitofrontal cor-
tex will begin DEMO saturate, as they simply cannot ﬁre fast
enough to produce linearly DEMO aﬀective responses
to increasingly large value deviations.

An alternative DEMO of value magnitude through
activated population size, rather than the ﬁring DEMO of a
ﬁxed population, would seem to deny this saturation-based
account DEMO diminishing marginal sensitivity. Such a scheme
might be akin to accumulator models that have been
applied to numerosity encoding in intraparietal regions
(Roitman, DEMO, & Platt, 2007). However, applying this
approach to valuation DEMO seems less plausible from a
neurophysiological resources perspective; while the salient
DEMO areas do have millions of neurons, all of these would
require DEMO connectivity to areas interpreting magnitude
information in order to impart the same information as
naturally rate-tuned transmitter release by a population
which encodes magnitude DEMO ﬁring rates. Indeed, accumu-
lator models generally allow for cardinal value DEMO
on restricted integer scales such as 2-to-32, rather than
the potentially DEMO and quasi-analog scale on which
valuations often lie.
Fig. 5 illustrates the results of running simulations based
on the preceding description. Each data point DEMO X along
the horizontal axes of Fig. 5b and c is the result of measur-
ing a modulated orbitofrontal valuation output in a simu-
DEMO providing orbitofrontal cortex a step input from 0 to
X , in accord with the reference-deviation characterization
of value in prospect theory. As expected, the eﬀects of loss
aversion are clear, with the slope diﬀerential indicating a
greater aﬀective impact of losses over equivalent gains.
The 2:1 DEMO ratio observed here for moderate losses and
gains mirrors behavioral evidence in the decision literature
(e.g., Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1991). Finally, the
concavity features of the value function have been success-
fully replicated in these simulations. Fig. 6 shows the spe-
ciﬁc role of DEMO saturation in this regard. Each row in
these spike rasters represents an individual orbitofrontal
cortex neuron, and each point represents a single action
potential at a speciﬁc point in time produced by the neuron
in question. DEMO, equal changes in the size of a loss or
gain do DEMO necessarily produce similar changes in neural
spiking, particularly as neurons begin DEMO saturate. This
causes a decreasing distinctness in ﬁring response at the
extremes, which we propose as the neurological basis for
the leveling-oﬀ in loss and gain valuation observed in
behavioral studies. Overall, the mechanisms we have out-
lined combine to produce a detailed, biologically plausible
neural explanation of the nature of the value function
described by prospect theory.

explanatory successes of prospect theory. A famous illus-
tration of the power of framing is the presentation of DEMO
diﬀerent choice-sets to subjects regarding the consequences
of diﬀerent plans to handle the outbreak of a disease
expected to kill 600 people (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981,
1986):
Problem 1: Program A – 200 people will be saved.
Program B – 1/3 probability 600 are DEMO, 2/3
probability nobody is saved.
Problem 2: Program C – 400 people will die.
Program D – 1/3 probability nobody will DEMO,
2/3 probability 600 will die.
Faced with the choice in Problem 1, 72% of subjects chose
Program A over B, whereas DEMO 22% of subjects chose
Program C over D when faced with Problem 2. Clearly,
though, Programs A and C are objectively equivalent, DEMO
are their respective alternatives. The framing of situations
in terms of losses or gains may thus cause dramatic rever-
sals of preference in decision DEMO

A. Litt et al. / Cognitive Systems Research 9 (2008) 252–273
DEMO mechanisms implemented in the ANDREA model
provide a realistic neural basis for such framing eﬀects.
We describe means by which objectively equivalent out-
comes DEMO produce markedly diﬀerent subjective valuations
in orbitofrontal cortex, depending on the DEMO in which
each is framed. In particular, note that feature (i) of the
prospect theory value function, the deﬁnition of subjective
valuation DEMO deviations from some neutral reference-value,
points towards an obvious mechanism for the framing of
decisions: variation of the reference value itself. In the dis-
ease example, Problem 1 is framed in terms of lives saved
rather than lives lost, while the reverse is true for Problem
2. Thus, choosing ‘‘zero” reference points from which sub-
jective valuations shall deviate in each case should lead to
diﬀerent values for each problem. For DEMO 1, ‘‘zero
lives saved” would indeed correspond to 0 on a DEMO mea-
suring the total number of people of our original 600 who
are expected to be left alive after the choice of a given DEMO
gram for combating the disease. Crucially, however, the
‘‘zero lives lost” reference point for Problem 2 would cor-
respond to the value 600 DEMO measured on this same scale,
since 600 out of 600 people alive indicates that no lives
have been lost, as required.
Thus, DEMO the case of the Program A option in Problem 1,
a subjective valuation deviation described as ‘‘200 people
out of 600 will be DEMO represents a positive-direction devi-
ation from 0 lives saved to 200 lives saved. In contrast, the
objectively equivalent Program C option in Problem 2,
described as ‘‘400 people out of 600 will die”, represents a
negative-direction deviation from 0 lives lost to 400 lives
lost, that is, from 600 left alive down to 200 left alive. Note
that both deviation construals end at the value 200 on the
scale of people DEMO alive, since they are objectively equiva-
lent outcomes. Nevertheless, because of our multiplicative
modulation of valuation deviations by emotional arousal,
opposite directions DEMO deviation will produce subjective val-
uations that are emotionally ampliﬁed in opposite direc-
tions. Fig. 7 illustrates the results of characterizing this
type of DEMO as a manipulation of the deviation reference
point. We obtain a subjective valuation of orbitofrontal
step input corresponding to Program A that is much DEMO
positive than that of a step input corresponding to Program
C, DEMO because of opposite directions of emotional mod-
ulation. This would explain the preference reversal that
occurs upon switching decision frames, as what was seen
as a gain in comparison to one reference-value is suddenly
evaluated as DEMO loss in comparison to a diﬀerent referent.
Later we will discuss framing eﬀects that operate in ways
other than varying reference-values, and how these diﬀerent
sorts of framing can in combination explain the observed
interactions between DEMO, prior expectations and counter-
factual comparisons explored in decision aﬀect theory.

hypotheses. Litt et al. (2006) outline several such DEMO
tions in relation to loss aversion and the behavioral inﬂu-
ence of serotonin. For example, the extent of a particular
individual’s hypersensitivity to losses is hypothesized to
be correlated with the concentration in the amygdala of DEMO
speciﬁc serotonin receptor subtype, which would inﬂuence
the degree to which DEMO reward prediction errors aﬀect
amygdala activity. As well, degraded connectivity between
DEMO dopamine neurons and the raphe serotonin sys-
tem is predicted to increase emotionally inﬂuenced over-
valuation of both gains and losses, due to mutual
attenuation eﬀects that we have modeled between these sys-
tems. Such correlation DEMO loss and gain sensitivity has
indeed been shown in recent work by Tom and colleagues
(2007). The particular neural activity they describe suggests
the mechanism underlying this relationship may involve
important additions to the computations DEMO in the
ANDREA model, such as the eﬀects of noradrenergic
circuits.
DEMO empirical investigation of the neural correlates
of loss aversion can provide more such tests and potential
falsiﬁcations of the relationships proposed in ANDREA,

gic activity limit the capacity of the approach of the Tom
et al. study in this respect. DEMO, this work and other
explorations of ‘‘prospect theory on the brain” DEMO this team

loss aversion (Tom, Fox, Trepel, & Poldrack, 2007; Trepel,

ously cited that indicate an important role for the amygdala
in emotional valuation, signiﬁcant amygdala activity

directly corresponding to loss aversion has contrastingly
been directly observed in other fMRI experiments (e.g.,
Weber et al., 2007). Such discrepancies DEMO limitations
might be resolved by employing alternative experimental
techniques; for instance, it is possible to temporarily dimin-
ish cerebral serotonin levels by an DEMO of a tryptophan
depleting drink (Cools et al., 2005), which our model sug-
gests would speciﬁcally diminish loss aversion. Depletion
studies of DEMO phenomena hold much promise
for testing the validity of neurocomputational models like
ANDREA, as well as advancing our understanding of the
biological bases of complex behaviors and cognitions. Var-
ious other anomalous choice-related behaviors arising from
DEMO disconnections and damage patterns are also
described by Litt et al. (DEMO). The enriched conceptions
of decision phenomena provided by neural-level exploration
allow for postulation of potential inﬂuences on behavior
that would be missed by DEMO restricted to examining
higher-level psychological processing.
A straightforward set of additional predictions deriving
from our ANDREA simulations would be expectations of
activation of the DEMO regions described in our model
(Fig. 1) to be observed in imaging experiments involving
people performing preference and choice tasks. But a more
DEMO explanatory and predictive utility of the model
involves the study of individual diﬀerences in value func-
tions. While the general features of the curve DEMO been
reproduced by many diﬀerent experiments and in large
numbers of people, the speciﬁc functions of diﬀerent indi-
viduals are known to vary widely (e.g., Kahneman & Tver-
sky, 1982). Because our simulations essentially represent
the value function produced by a single brain (to which
we have complete access, as its designers and builders)
the model oﬀers biological reasons for why and how indi-
vidual value functions vary, while preserving some com-
mon general features. As discussed previously,
connectivity strength DEMO dorsal raphe serotonin and
the amygdala can inﬂuence loss aversion, and DEMO the nat-
ure of the subjective valuations performed in orbitofrontal
cortex. In persons with heightened serotonin sensitivity in
the amygdala, we would expect to see a value function with
an even steeper slope for losses than DEMO of gains. The
opposite also holds, in terms of lessened serotonergic DEMO
ence or stronger midbrain dopaminergic connectivity, with
either of these cases DEMO of less discrepancy in slope
between losses and gains (i.e., reduced loss aversion). The
damaged innervation between the raphe and midbrain
mentioned DEMO would have the eﬀect of steepening both
the loss and gain portions of the curve, although the slope
ratio might be unaﬀected. These connectivity manipula-
tions can be understood psychologically as altering the
extent to which DEMO is emotionally aroused by losses and
gains, with this aﬀective inﬂuence DEMO to producing sub-
jective valuations of these deviations from a reference
point.
We also predict that speciﬁc neural saturation range dif-
ferences between brains DEMO underlie individual diﬀerences
in value function shape, with more readily saturating
DEMO populations prone to producing curves that
level-oﬀ quicker and more markedly. In the NEF, this sat-
uration can itself be modeled asymmetrically around 0, so
we can readily create a neural system of speciﬁc architec-
ture and connectivity that yields signiﬁcant leveling-oﬀ
for losses but much less so DEMO gains, or vice versa. In
sum, the ANDREA model allows for numerous experi-
mentally testable neural-level predictions regarding pros-
pect theoretic behavior.
5. DEMO neural account of decision aﬀect theory
The hedonic inﬂuence of prior expectations and coun-
terfactual comparisons on the subjective valuation of out-
comes is DEMO by the work of Mellers and
colleagues on what they call decision aﬀect theory (Mel-
lers & McGraw, 2001; Mellers et al., DEMO; Mellers, Sch-
wartz, & Ritov, 1999). Its fundamental claim is that
evaluation by an individual of an outcome, event or deci-
sion option is strongly inﬂuenced by the ‘‘relative plea-
sure” it is DEMO to provide (Mellers, 2000). This
relativity derives in part from the eﬀects of counterfactual
comparisons, as illustrated by the ﬁnding that Olympic
silver medalists are more likely to feel disappointed than
bronze medalists because DEMO generally higher personal
expectations (McGraw, Mellers, & Tetlock, 2005).
Another factor is the degree to which an obtained out-
come is DEMO surprising, with greater emotional
impact for unexpected results (either good or bad) than
for expected outcomes. The mathematical expression of
decision aﬀect theory is
RO
¼
J½uO
þ
dðuO

uE Þ ð1

sO DEMO ð5Þ
(cf. Eq. (1) in McGraw et al., 2005). RO is the emotional
feeling associated with the obtained outcome and J DEMO a lin-
ear function relating the felt pleasure to a speciﬁc numeri-
cal response. uO and uE are the respective utilities of the
obtained DEMO expected outcomes, and d(uO  uE) is a disap-
pointment function that models how the obtained outcome
is compared to the alternative DEMO outcome. sO is the
subjectively judged probability of the obtained outcome
actually occurring, so the weighting by the complementary
(1  sO) term models the degree to which the obtained out-
come was not expected (i.e., the subjective probability that
something else would occur). The importance of emotional
inﬂuence becomes clear with the ﬁnding that people will
choose DEMO feels best – that is, make decisions in such a
manner DEMO to maximize average positive emotional experi-
ence (Mellers et al., 1997).
Thus feelings about outcomes and choices, and hence
the decisions people may be expected to make, are greatly
inﬂuenced by the size and valence of the discrepancy
between anticipated and actual results. The expected emo-
DEMO reaction to gaining $20 will be vastly diﬀerent if the
prior expectation is gaining $100, versus the case where the
expected yield is only $1. Indeed, the degree of inﬂuence of
A. Litt et al. / Cognitive Systems Research 9 (2008) 252–273
DEMO discrepancy from anticipated results is such that an
objectively worse outcome can sometimes be morepleasur-
able than one which is better. Consider the easily DEMO
able experience of feeling happier in stumbling across a
20-dollar bill while walking home from work than from
receiving an underwhelming 1% raise the DEMO day, despite
the monetary value of the raise being signiﬁcantly higher
DEMO that of the found note. Decision aﬀect theory thus
describes in a revealing and systematic fashion the nature
of certain situations in which less DEMO actually feel like
more. In describing a neural basis for the theory suggested
by ANDREA, we shall draw upon an integration of the
sort of framing discussed in our examination of prospect
theory with the eﬀects DEMO the emotional-context of informa-
tion presentation on valuation and choice, which DEMO now
explore in depth.
5.1. Framing through direct emotional arousal inﬂuence
Our earlier discussion of framing eﬀects focused on the
type most discussed in DEMO theory, concerning alterna-
tive descriptions of losses and gains. However, framing can
aﬀect decisions in other ways, as in the trolley-footbridge
experiments of Greene and colleagues (2001). These exper-
iments are not reference-value manipulations, and are
therefore not explainable by the neural mechanisms that
we described for prospect theory. The judgment of moral-
ity reversal occurs between two DEMO that are both
described as killing one person to save ﬁve others. The
manipulation involved here is not one of reference point,
but DEMO the personal or impersonal nature of the speciﬁc
action performed that leads to the described outcome. It is
thus diﬀering contexts of choice presentation (i.e., the nat-
ure of the situation story) that produce the DEMO in situa-
tional evaluation, rather than any suggestive presentation
of choices DEMO terms of either losses or gains. We will call this
emotional-context framing, in contrast to the reference-
value framing we discussed in relation to prospect theory.
We propose that emotional-context framing in the trol-
ley-footbridge dilemma DEMO through increased arousal
associated with the direct, personalized action of pushing
DEMO person to their death, compared to the more detached
and impersonal DEMO of ﬂipping a switch that will cause a
trolley to divert from hitting ﬁve people towards hitting a
single person. Such an increase in DEMO engagement
induces greater ampliﬁcation of the subjective evaluation
of causing a death in the personal case, which would pro-
vide a neurological basis for the reversal in typical judg-
ments of the morality of the actions DEMO question. fMRI
experiments by Greene and colleagues seem to support this
neural account of the trolley-footbridge dilemma, showing
increased amygdala and orbitofrontal activity in cases of
highly personal characterizations of morally debatable
actions (Greene & Haidt, 2002; Greene, Nystrom, Engell,
Darley, & Cohen, 2004)DEMO

the emotional-context of the DEMO information. Just
as for reference-value framing, we get diﬀerent subjective
valuations DEMO scenarios that have identical objective val-
ues, which would allow for DEMO reversals to occur
when the decision frame is altered. The primary diﬀerence
is that this mechanism employs a direct manipulation of
emotional arousal state, whereas our neural basis for the
reference-value framing caused emotional modulation
changes DEMO though manipulation of valuation devia-
tion reference points.
5.2. Decision aﬀect theory as an integrated framing
phenomenon
Explanation of the experimental results examined in
DEMO aﬀect theory requires both reference-value framing
and emotional-context framing. The hedonic impact of
counterfactual comparisons can be produced by setting
the reference point of DEMO valuation deviation for an
obtained outcome to the value of the unobtained counter-
factual result, which is exactly reference-value framing.

Then winning $20 when the counterfactual comparison is a
$100 win would be construed as a loss, whereas a counter-
factual comparison to winning only $1 would reframe the
$20 win as a gain. In addition, the degree to which the
obtained outcome was unexpected can have the DEMO of
emotional-context framing. We formally model this in
ANDREA by having emotional-context inﬂuence neural
behavior through the arousal input A1 (see Eq. (4))in a
manner that takes into account the perceived probability
of the DEMO outcome X actually occurring:
A1ðtÞ¼ A0ðtÞþ k ð1

P½outcome X Þ:
ð6Þ
In this enriched conception of emotional arousal, A0 ﬁlls
the previous role of A1 as a base arousal level determined
by DEMO factors and provided as an input to the model.
A1 emotional arousal is now explicitly increased in inverse
proportion to the expected probability of DEMO the
outcome under consideration. Surprising, low-probability
outcomes produce higher arousal than DEMO out-
comes, where 1  P[X] is closer to 0. The DEMO multi-
plier k may be related to the relative aﬀect-richness of the
outcome in question, as this variable seems strongly related
to the degree to which uncertainty aﬀects valuations (Rot-
tenstreich & Hsee, 2001).
DEMO direct manipulation of base emotional arousal is a
formalization of emotional-context framing, in this case a
context related to outcome uncertainty. It and reference-
value framing, implemented in ANDREA by the mecha-
nisms described earlier, DEMO produce the canonical
ﬁnding of decision aﬀect theory that objectively worse out-
comes can sometimes feel better than more advantageous
alternatives (Fig. 9). The mechanisms described above
and illustrated in Fig. 9 allow us to DEMO the standard math-
ematical model of decision aﬀect theory (Eq. (5)) onto spe-
ciﬁc neural structures and computations. The calculation of
subjective DEMO and their subsequent comparison, as
embodied in the d(uO  DEMO) term in Eq. (5), are performed
neurologically through step-functional deviation in orbito-
frontal cortex exactly as we modeled for prospect theoretic
subjective DEMO The ‘disappointment’ eﬀects of com-
paring obtained and expected outcome valuations result
from prediction error computations by dopamine and sero-
tonin networks feeding back DEMO inﬂuence emotional arousal
encoded in the amygdala, which in turn modulates DEMO
frontal valuations. The subjective probability augmenta-
tion to our arousal representation (DEMO (6)) is identical to
the (1  sO) surprise DEMO in the decision aﬀect theory
model of Mellers and colleagues. In combination with
our multiplicative modulation of valuation by aﬀective
arousal (Eq. (1)), it is clear that this enhancement also
has similar mathematical eﬀects DEMO that of for the surprise
term in Eq. (5).
Figs. DEMO and 11 show the results of more comprehensive
simulations of the behavioral ﬁndings of Mellers and col-
leagues (Mellers et al., 1997, 1999). In Fig. 10, the value
of the unobtained counterfactual comparison outcome is
held constant at $0 (i.e., neither losing nor gaining money)DEMO
while the obtained outcome value and the expected proba-
bility of obtaining that outcome are varied. Fig. 11
describes an opposing experiment where the DEMO is the
unvarying obtained outcome – that is, subjects neither lose
DEMO gain any money. What is instead varied is the expected
probability of obtaining this $0 outcome and the value of
the unobtained outcome used DEMO a counterfactual compari-
son. In both ﬁgures and in both the behavioral and
ANDREA simulation results, lower-probability curves
(corresponding to surprising obtained outcomes) produce
more intense aﬀective experiences, as reﬂected by more
extreme emotional response ratings. As well, there are cases
in both the behavioral ﬁndings and our simulation data
where an objectively worse outcome produces a more posi-
DEMO emotional response than one which is objectively
greater. For instance, both DEMO 10a and b show more ela-
tion from winning $17.50 instead of $0 with an expected
probability of such a win of only 0.09 DEMO for winning
$31.50 instead of $0 when the anticipated probability of
this outcome is 0.94. The surprising smaller gain feels bet-
ter than the DEMO larger gain. Our proposed neural
basis for decision aﬀect theory thus provides a plausible
and thorough biological characterization of the
phenomenon.
We have been DEMO to explain the central ﬁndings of
decision aﬀect theory using the same mechanisms that we
applied to the phenomena explained by prospect theory,
DEMO the addition of framing by emotional-context. A
major motivating factor for the exploration of any subject
at more basic levels of explanation is the DEMO to unite
ﬁndings that are disconnected at higher levels of study
through a set of shared lower-level mechanisms. In this
vein, an important undertaking in the neuroscientiﬁc
exploration of the psychology of preference and choice is
DEMO uncover shared underpinnings for phenomena that have
yet to be rigorously tied together at the behavioral level.
ANDREA demonstrates such a means to connect DEMO
aﬀect theory and prospect theory via the two neural mech-
anisms for framing we have outlined.
5.3. Predictions
There are undoubtedly other kinds of DEMO besides
the reference-value and emotional-context types that we
have discussed. Additional brain mechanisms may be
required to explain other cases in which diﬀering modes
DEMO identical information presentation produce divergent

ing mechanism, which in turn causes increasingly ampliﬁed
subjective valuations that would correspond to inﬂated

Further predictions arising from the framing mecha-
nisms we have described relate DEMO how the neural activity
making up these mechanisms, and hence the DEMO of
framing, could be induced without performing explicit
decision framing. For DEMO, it might be possible to
manipulate default subjective valuation reference points
DEMO upwards or downwards via positive or negative
priming, or perhaps even DEMO direct neuropharmaco-
logical intervention to inﬂuence orbitofrontal activity. This
could potentially produce eﬀects similar to reference-value
framing in a less conspicuous manner. Similarly for DEMO
tional-context framing, manipulation of aﬀective arousal
in a manner wholly unrelated DEMO situation context could
cause ‘‘bleed-over” eﬀects identical to those produced by
situation-related arousal modulation. Methods of manipu-
lation include prior exposure to violent or DEMO imagery,
relaxing or stressful preceding tasks, and direct pharmaco-
logical DEMO of amygdala activity. There is a wide
variety of means by which brain activity similar or identical
to our mechanisms of framing can be DEMO either
behaviorally or neurochemically, and we predict that such
alternative routes DEMO produce behaviors in people sim-
ilar to explicit framing eﬀects, regardless DEMO whether or not
they are aware of how they are being inﬂuenced.
6. General discussion
We have shown how neural aﬀective decision theory, as
stated in our four principles and as implemented in the
ANDREA model, can account for the central phenomena
described by prospect theory and decision DEMO theory.
Our view of the general process of decision making is sum-
marized in Fig. 12. People are presented with a decision
problem by DEMO or perceptually experienced descriptions
which they must interpret based on the context in which the
decision is being made, resulting in an overall representa-
tion of the problem that is both cognitive and emotional.
Options, outcomes, and goals can be encoded by verbal
and other cognitive representations, DEMO with an inelimin-
able emotional content; in particular, goals are emotionally
tagged. The translation of the presentation of a problem
and its context DEMO an internal cognitive–emotional

ANDREA has greater explanatory scope than other
neurocomputational models of decision DEMO reward that
have focused on in-depth modeling of more restricted sub-
systems of the brain, and accordingly limited ranges of
behavioral phenomena. Two such examples are the model
of reward association reversal in orbitofrontal cortex by
DEMO and Rolls (2005) and the GAGE model of cogni-

forward diﬀusion decision process implemented in supe-
rior colliculus cells seems able to accurately characterize
accuracy and reaction time in simple two-choice decision

of this sort is important for exploring basic details of neu-
ral mechanisms for DEMO phenomena, but examining
brain processes on a larger scale is required DEMO explaining
more complex and wide-ranging psychological ﬁndings,
such as prospect theory and decision aﬀect theory. Buse-
meyer and Johnson (2004) describe a DEMO model
that they apply to a range of behaviors as diverse as those
explored by ANDREA, including preference reversal
eﬀects and loss aversion. The network model called aﬀec-
tive balance theory (Grossberg & Gutowski, 1987) also
explores a wide range of risky decision phenomena in a
mathematically DEMO fashion, and proposes eﬀects
of emotional-context on cognitive processing that are
DEMO consistent with those implemented in ANDREA.

The main improvement that our approach oﬀers over
these two models is in neurological realism, as reﬂected
by modeled characteristics of individual processing units
(‘neurons’) and the DEMO of proposed computations
onto speciﬁc brain regions and interactions supported by
empirical ﬁndings. The models of Grossberg and Gutow-
ski (1987) and Busemeyer DEMO Johnson (2004) are not
comparable in this respect to either ANDREA or the pre-
viously mentioned works of Deco and Rolls (2005) DEMO
Wagar and Thagard (2004). This of course is not a DEMO
cism of such methods of modeling. Rather, it is more of
DEMO indication of the diﬀerent levels at which theoreticians
can formulate explanations of behaviorally studied psy-
chological phenomena. While the proposed mechanisms
are interesting from DEMO larger perspective of computa-
tional models of decision making, these artiﬁcial DEMO
networks are of a fundamentally diﬀerent nature than
ANDREA and similar models in computational cognitive
neuroscience.
A recent model of decision-related interactions between
basal DEMO and orbitofrontal cortex by Frank and Claus
(2006) recognizes the utility of taking the sort of broad-scale
approach we employ in our design DEMO ANDREA, and main-
tains a similar level of neurological realism and DEMO
Despite certain similarities regarding modeled brain regions
and proposed computations, this DEMO diverges from
ANDREA in several fundamental ways, leading to both dif-
DEMO mechanisms and diﬀerent explanatory targets for each
of our models. After brieﬂy describing the structure of the
Frank and Claus (2006) model, we compare it in detail with
our own model of valuation and choice DEMO
The main focus of the Frank and Claus model is the
means by which basal ganglia dopaminergic activity and
orbitofrontal computations enable adaptive decision DEMO
ing responsive to contextual information. Computation
and representation of expected decision value information
is accomplished through a division of labor between sub-
cortical dopamine DEMO prefrontal networks. A basal gan-
glia dopaminergic network learns to make decisions
based on the relative probability of such decisions leading
to positive outcomes. DEMO process is augmented by orbito-
frontal circuits that provide a working memory representa-
tion of associated reinforcer value magnitudes that
exercises top–down control on DEMO basal ganglia activity,
which allows more ﬂexible response to rapidly changing
inputs. The proposed computations are detailed, elegant
and well-supported by empirical data, and the model is
eﬀective in explaining decision-related behaviors as diverse
as risk aversion/seeking, reversal learning, and peoples’
performance in a variant DEMO the Iowa gambling task in both
normal and brain-damaged scenarios.
While ANDREA does not implement the speciﬁc compu-
tations proposed by Frank and Claus (2006), this is due more
to diﬀering targets of explanation than DEMO any major incon-
sistencies in our respective conceptions of the roles of various
brain regions in decision making. Both models describe
important functional diﬀerences DEMO orbitofrontal-
amygdala networks and dopaminergic activity in line with
empirical ﬁndings demonstrating the involvement of orbito-
frontal cortex in valuation and dopaminergic encoding of
DEMO prediction error. How these subsystems might inter-
act is a question that both ANDREA and Frank and Claus
(2006) address, and one that has been neglected in previous
theoretical modeling of the neurobiology of reward. DEMO
theless, whereas Frank and Claus develop a comprehensive
characterization of how DEMO cortex learns and rep-
resents reinforcer value, our goal is to DEMO how speciﬁc
external inﬂuences diﬀerentially alter the magnitudes of these
orbitofrontal-encoded values, such as via the asymmetric
emotional modulation by losses and gains on valuations that
we describe as the basis of loss aversion in prospect DEMO
As a result, the models are best suited to providing neural
DEMO of diﬀerent psychological phenomena, and
where they address similar phenomena they DEMO so with con-
trasting emphases on speciﬁc relevant brain mechanisms.
The most prominent diﬀerence is that of representa-
tional complexity of amygdala activity. In DEMO models,
the amygdala encodes the magnitude of losses and gains
in proportion to overall activity level, which then inﬂuences
orbitofrontal representations of reward values. Frank and
Claus (2006) do not explore how the amygdala DEMO such
representations of reinforcer magnitude, providing them
instead as direct model DEMO In contrast, ANDREA
models multifaceted means by which emotional arousal
related DEMO outcome magnitude is encoded by the amygdala
(Eqs. (4) and (5)). This allows for the postulation of neural
explanations for phenomena not addressed by Frank and
Claus (2006), such as multiple mechanisms for framing
and the observations of decision aﬀect theory. In addition,
DEMO both models describe loss aversion as resulting from
greater amygdala activation by losses than equivalent
gains, ANDREA oﬀers speciﬁc neurological reasons of
268
A. Litt et al. / Cognitive Systems Research 9 (2008) DEMO
how this might occur through diﬀerential calibration of dis-
tinct loss and gain reward prediction error networks, as
well as feedback to the amygdala from dorsolateral and
cingulate processing of behavioral saliency. Our detailed
characterization of DEMO the amygdala comes to represent
magnitude information thus allows us to both explain addi-
tional phenomena and provide more complete biological
mechanisms for valuation DEMO decision behaviors simu-
lated by both models.
Important structural diﬀerences between the models
result from their diﬀering conceptions of amygdala activity.
The Frank and DEMO (2006) model focuses primarily on
the top–down biasing eﬀect of orbitofrontal activity on
gradual, multi-trial learning in the basal ganglia dopamine
network, DEMO much less emphasis on the reciprocal inﬂu-
ence of relative reinforcement probability computations
on orbitofrontal activation. We are able to explore in depth
such DEMO in ANDREA through feedback of reward pre-
diction error information to the amygdala that inﬂuences
its encoding of emotional arousal, which in turn modulates
orbitofrontal valuations. These valuations have top–down
biasing eﬀects on reinforcement learning and DEMO selec-
tion similar to those modeled by Frank and Claus (2006),
for instance how diﬀering orbitofrontal representations of
identical reward values caused DEMO framing eﬀects produce
diﬀerent activity in dopamine and serotonin prediction
error subsystems.
There are several other issues on which the models diﬀer in
important DEMO Perhaps the most obvious is regarding the
role of serotonin acting in opponency with dopamine in
reward prediction error. Frank and Claus (2006) DEMO that
the low baseline ﬁring rates of dopaminergic cells need not
mean that ﬁring rate depressions are less capable of encoding
highly negative outcomes, as there may exist countervailing
sensitivity diﬀerences in dopamine receptors to ﬁring DEMO
versus dips. While they remain open to a role for serotonin
in negative reinforcement learning and aversive stimulus
processing mediated within OFC, they argue for the central-
ity of dopamine ﬁring dips to negative valuation processing
DEMO by the basal ganglia, even in light of evidence show-
ing DEMO dips are physiologically limited in scope (e.g., Bayer
& Glimcher, DEMO). Our model can be considered structurally
consistent with this line of reasoning, since the mutual bias-
ing eﬀects we have implemented between dopamine and sero-
tonin produce the same dopaminergic ﬁring depressions
utilized computationally by DEMO and Claus in cases where
we describe encoding via serotonergic activity. Clearly,
though, the models diﬀer markedly in the degree to which
they assign explanatory import to dopamine ﬁring dips ver-
sus concomitant serotonergic ﬁring DEMO Further diﬀer-
ences are evident in respective extents of brain region
modeling. Frank and Claus employ more complex concep-
tions of orbitofrontal cortex and DEMO dopamine areas
than are implemented by ANDREA, diﬀerentially utilizing
speciﬁc subpopulations DEMO these broadly deﬁned brain areas.
In contrast, ANDREA includes limited but DEMO con-
tributions from anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefron-
tal cortices. These include involvement in encoding the
behavioral relevance of outcomes, how this encoding may
diﬀer for positive and negative outcomes, and the subsequent
eﬀects of behavioral saliency on emotional arousal. These
are brain regions omitted in the model DEMO Frank and Claus
(2006) that they acknowledge may be crucial to understand-
ing decision phenomena. Finally, ANDREA is the ﬁrst
model to explore a possible role for neural saturation in
explaining the nature of subjective DEMO This eﬀect is
not examined in the Frank and Claus work, DEMO does
not address the leveling-oﬀ of the prospect theory value func-
tion for increasingly extreme losses and gains. Thus, while
these two models are fairly consistent with one another
and share similarities in their large-scale approaches DEMO mod-
eling the neural foundations of decision making, they both
make DEMO contributions to explaining diﬀerent aspects
of relevant behaviors and psychological processes.
One of the most fertile areas for future applications of
neural aﬀective decision DEMO and the ANDREA model
is the burgeoning ﬁeld of neuroeconomics, which DEMO
at the intersection of economics, psychology, and neurosci-
ence (Camerer, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2005; Glimcher &
Rustichini, 2004; Sanfey DEMO al., 2006). Examples of such
applications include the previously mentioned DEMO
regarding preference reversal in joint versus separate option
evaluation (Hsee et DEMO, 1999, 2005) and observed interac-
tions between risk, uncertainty and emotion (Rottenstreich
& Hsee, 2001), both of which seem explainable DEMO the neuro-
logical mechanisms we have modeled. Unlike traditional
economic theory, DEMO do not take preferences as given, but
rather explain them as DEMO result of speciﬁc neural opera-
tions. A person’s preference for A over B is the result of a neu-
ral aﬀective evaluation in which DEMO representation of A
produces a more positive anticipated reward value (or DEMO
least a less negative value) than the representation of B.As
depicted DEMO Fig. 12, the neural aﬀective evaluation of options
depends on their DEMO representation, which
can vary depending on the presentation and context of DEMO
mation. This dependence explains why actual human prefer-
ences often do not obey the axioms of traditional
microeconomic theory. In addition to neuroeconomics, we
are exploring the relevance of our theory and model to
understanding ethical DEMO, the neural bases of which
are under increasing investigation (Casebeer & Churchland,
2003; Greene & Haidt, 2002; Moll, Zahn, de Oliveira-Souza,
Krueger, & Grafman, 2005). Finally, while neural aﬀective
decision theory is primarily intended as a descriptive account
of how people DEMO do make decisions, but it can provide
a starting point for DEMO a prescriptive theory of how
they ought to make better decisions (DEMO, 2006).
Like all models, ANDREA provides a drastically sim-
pliﬁed picture of the phenomena it simulates, and there
are many possible areas for improvement and extension.
These include increasing the complexity of individual pop-
DEMO, adding more brain areas, modeling more relation-
ships between brain areas, and exploring the eﬀects of
neuronal ﬁring saturation beyond simply orbitofrontal

biologically realistic DEMO for fundamental decision
processes, and shown their applicability to explaining sev-
DEMO major experimental ﬁndings in behavioral decision
research. Besides implementing original mechanistic ideas,
such as a role for saturation in explaining diminishing mar-
ginal DEMO in prospect theory, ANDREA contributes
to two important classes of explanation DEMO decision neuro-
science: (1) Generalization and novel syntheses of hitherto
DEMO mechanisms of neural processing (e.g., multipli-
cative models of attention and reward reinforcement learn-
ing); and (2) Speciﬁc and detailed grounding DEMO behaviorally
explored psychological phenomena in such plausible and
realistic neurocomputational mechanisms. The result, we
hope, is a deeper understanding of how and why DEMO
make the choices that they do.

We DEMO spiking activity for a total of 7600 neurons
spread over seven speciﬁc populations (Fig. 1), using the
common and physiologically realistic leaky-integrate-and-
ﬁre (LIF) model for each of our modeled neurons (see
Appendix B). In particular, we use 800–1200 neurons for
simulating each of the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, ven-
tral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, and DEMO
prefrontal cortex, representing one- to three-dimensional
vectors as needed in the DEMO engineering framework
(Appendix B). The areas representing midbrain dopaminer-
gic DEMO and the dorsal raphe nucleus of the brainstem
are each modeled with 1200-neuron ensembles, each with
several discrete subpopulations, in order to capture DEMO
additional complexities involved in the encodings and
transformations we assign to these areas in our model
(recurrent, rectiﬁed, biased-opponent calculation of reward
prediction error; see Appendix C).
Each individual neuron is based on a reduced-complexity
biophysical model that includes features fundamental to
most neurons, including conventional action potentials
(spikes), spike train variability, absolute refractoriness,
background DEMO, and membrane leak currents. The mem-
brane time constant for our DEMO neurons is set to 10 ms, with
a refractory period (a post-spike delay during which the neu-
ron may not ﬁre) of 1 ms. We introduce at simulation run-
time 10% Gaussian, independent zero-mean noise, relative
to normalized maximum ﬁring rates, to simulate the noisy
environment DEMO which our neurons operate. These choices
are based on plausible biological assumptions (see Eliasmith
& Anderson, 2003), and we have made reasonable DEMO to
select neurobiologically realistic values for other network
cell parameters as well. For example, our 5 ms synaptic time
constant for dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons is consistent
with the 3 ms decay constants observed in vivo (Li & Bayliss,
1998). Neurons in the cortical areas we DEMO modeled have
been shown to have maximum ﬁring rates ranging from
20–40 Hz in dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal areas
(Wallis & Miller, 2003) to at least 50 Hz in anterior cingulate
cortex (Davis, Hutchison, Lozano, Tasker, & Dostrovsky,
2000). Thus, our selection of a 10–80 Hz saturation range
for neurons in these model ensembles is DEMO physiologically rea-
sonable compromise to maintain population sizes that are
manageable for simulation purposes. Ensembles must grow
increasingly large to allow for meaningful representation
DEMO slower-ﬁring, smaller saturation-range neurons making
up the ensembles.
Practical considerations nonetheless DEMO necessary
some limitations on biological realism. Principally, the sat-
uration ranges DEMO selected for our modeled subcortical
regions are appreciably higher (by roughly DEMO factor of 10)
than those observed empirically for typical neurons in these
areas. The much larger neural ensemble sizes that would be
required DEMO clean representation and transformation using
the extremely low experimentally observed ﬁring rates
would have made our large-scale simulations computation-
ally impracticable given available resources. DEMO addition-
ally support this compromise of biological realism by
noting that signiﬁcantly higher ﬁring peaks (greater than
100 Hz) are observed in the DEMO behavior of both cer-
tain raphe serotonergic neurons (e.g., Gartside et al.,
2000; Hajo´ s, Gartside, Villa, & Sharp, 1995) and subpopu-
lations of the amygdala (Driesang & Pape, 2000; DEMO &
Gaudreau, 1996), and to less degree in midbrain and stria-
tum dopaminergic neurons as well (Hyland, Reynolds,
Hay, Perk, & Miller, 2002). The speciﬁc activity our model
produces in DEMO subcortical areas seems well-suited to cod-
ing via bursting neurons (large DEMO transient ﬁring upsurges
that interpose lengthier periods of near-zero activity). While
we do not deﬁne here an explicit alternative neuron model to
LIF, Eliasmith (2005a) describes how bursting could be
incorporated into the NEF, and thus NESim simulations.
For the most part, we have chosen neuron ﬁring thresh-
olds (that is, the respective input levels above which DEMO
vidual neurons begin to respond) from an even
distribution over a DEMO represented symmetrically around
zero, with neuron preferred directions in the space DEMO
270
representation also chosen from an even distribution (i.e.,
equal numbers of ‘on’ and ‘oﬀ’ neurons; see Appendix
B). The exceptions to this rule are single subpopulations
of both the dorsal raphe and midbrain DEMO
regions. In these cases, our establishment of minimum ﬁr-
ing thresholds DEMO zero combines with an exclusive use of
positively sloped ‘on’ neurons in these subpopulations to
produce insensitivity to negative values (i.e., rectiﬁed
reward DEMO error encoding). This corresponds well
with experimentally observed physiological limitations in
the computation of reward prediction error in these brain
regions (see Bayer & Glimcher (2005), as well as the discus-
sion of dopamine and serotonin within the main text
description of the ANDREA model).
DEMO B. NEF representation, transformation and
dynamics
The NEF consists primarily of DEMO fundamental prin-
ciples regarding the representation of information in neural
populations, DEMO means by which these representations are
transformed through interactions between populations,
and the control theoretic nature of the characterization of
neural dynamics. Eliasmith DEMO Anderson (2003) present
a rigorous explication and analysis of the NEF, but the
mathematical details we outline here should be suﬃcient
for understanding the fundamental nature and operation
of our neural model of aﬀective choice DEMO valuation.
Consider a neural ensemble whose activities ai(x) encode
some DEMO quantity x(t) mapping onto a real-world quan-
tity (eye position, emotional arousal, etc.). Note that this
quantity need not be DEMO vector; scalars, functions, and func-
tion spaces can be represented DEMO manipulated in the NEF
in a near-identical fashion. The encoding of x involves a
conversion of x(t) into a neural spike train:

tity, such as an encoded stimulus, is related to a scalar sig-
DEMO describing the input current. For scalars, the encoding
vector is either DEMO (an ‘on’ neuron) or 1 (an ‘oﬀ’ neuron).
(B1) thus captures the nonlinear encoding process from a
high-dimensional variable, x, to a one-dimensional soma
current, Ji , to a train of neural spikes, d(t  tin).
Under this encoding paradigm, the DEMO stimulus
vector representation can be estimated by decoding those
activities; that DEMO, converting neural spike trains back into
quantities relevant for explanations of DEMO computation

means of characterizing this decoding is as a speciﬁc lin-
eartransformation of the spike DEMO In the NEF, the origi-
nal stimulus vector x(t) is decoded by computing an
estimate x^ðtÞ using a linear combination of ﬁlters DEMO(t) that

postsynaptic currents (PSCs) in the associated neuron i
for reasons of biological plausibility. Together, the nonlin-

The next aspect of the NEF to examine is the means by
which computations are performed in order to transform
DEMO representations present in a given model. The main task
needed to be performed is the calculation of connection
weights between the diﬀerent populations involved DEMO a
transformation. As an example, let us consider the trans-

in our actual model – all interactions are implemented in a
purely linear fashion, as is typically taken to be the case in
real neural systems (see Eliasmith & Anderson (2003), for

Finally, dynamics play a fundamental role in the overall
operation DEMO our model, such as in our recurrent reward
prediction error computation. DEMO can describe the dynam-
ics of a neural population in control theoretic form via the
dynamics state equation that is at the basis of DEMO con-
trol theory:
x_ ðtÞ¼ AxðtÞþ BuðtÞ; ðB5Þ
where A DEMO the dynamics matrix, B is the input matrix, u(t)
is the input or control vector, and x(t) is the DEMO vector. At
this high-level of characterization we are detached from
any neural-level implementation details. It is possible, how-
ever, to introduce simple modiﬁcations DEMO render the sys-
tem neurally plausible. The ﬁrst step in converting this
characterization is to account for intrinsic neural dynamics.
To do so, we assume a standard PSC model given by
h(t)= s1et/s , and then employ the following derived rela-
tion (Eliasmith & Anderson, 2003):
A0 ¼ sA þI ðB6Þ
B0 ¼ sB
so that our neurally plausible high-level dynamics charac-
terization becomes
xðtÞ¼ hðtÞ½A0xðtÞþ B0uðtÞ:
DEMO
To integrate this dynamics description with the neural
representation code we described previously, we combine
the dynamics of (B7), the encoding of (B1), and the popu-
lation decoding of x and u as DEMO (B4). That is, we take dec-
odings x^ ¼ tjnÞ/ and
introduce neural dynamics into the encoding operation asfollows: Pjnhjðt

Appendix C. Representation/transformation summary
Table C1 encapsulates the complete inputs, outputs and
transformations we use to model speciﬁc interactions
between the brain regions included in our model (see also
Fig. 1 and discussions of equations in the main body for
more high-level, conceptual characterizations of connectiv-
ity and signal transformation). Variable names are as DEMO the
text of the Methods section.
These equations describe explicitly the nature of the con-
nectivity relationships and signal transformation processes
outlined in Fig. DEMO and discussed in the main body descrip-
tion of the ANDREA model.
