Abstract
This study examines the selection behaviour of 68 European early stage DEMO tech VCs.
In particular, we examine whether or not these VCs DEMO heterogeneity in their
selection behaviour. To examine these issues we employ a conjoint analysis
methodology. Our results indicate that VCs exhibit substantial heterogeneity in
DEMO selection behaviour. Employing a cluster analysis three types of investors
emerge: DEMO who focus on technology, those who focus on finance and those DEMO focus
on people. We then examine the drivers of these differences, DEMO the sectoral focus, the
sources of funds and the human capital DEMO the investment manager.

HOW DO EARLY STAGE HIGH TECHNOLOGY INVESTORS
SELECT THEIR INVESTMENTS?
EXECUTIVE DEMO
Quite a lot of researchers have studied selection criteria used by venture
capitalists when assessing a business proposal. Most of these studies were undertaken
DEMO US venture capitalists and used post hoc methodology or verbal protocol analysis. In
this research, we build upon the positive aspects of these methodologies, but use a
conjoint analysis instead, allowing us to both capture DEMO hierarchy of selection criteria
used by VCs and the reasoning of the investment manager during the selection process.
We focus on a specific subset DEMO the European venture capital industry, namely
those VCs investing in early DEMO high tech projects. Next to studying selection
behaviour of these VCs, DEMO look at what drives this selection behaviour. We specifically
look at whether the sources of funds, the human capital of the investment manager and
the sector in which the business proposal is situated are determinants of DEMO selection
behaviour.
Our results indicate that VCs exhibit substantial heterogeneity in investment
selection behaviour. Employing a cluster analysis three clear types of investors emerge:DEMO
those who focus on technology, those who focus on finance and DEMO who focus on
people. We then examine differences between the three groups in terms of their sectoral
focus, the sources of the funds and the human capital of the investment manager. The
results indicate that technology DEMO make most use of public money and invest in
biotech. These investment managers sometimes have an academic background. Finance
investors make the least use DEMO public capital, invest in ICT and their investment
managers are the DEMO experienced. People investors are most often found in the other
sectors and the investment managers combine experience within other VC funds and have
a DEMO education.
The results of this study have important implications for practitioners. Our results
show that the background and experience of investment managers can influence DEMO
individual’s selection behaviour. VCs may build their investment teams with a human
capital consideration in mind. Next to this, it is interesting to VCs to know which VCs
3
have similar selection patterns and thus to know which VCs they will DEMO competing with
on specific deals, or could be potential syndication partners.
DEMO, high tech entrepreneurs can benefit from a better knowledge of
selection DEMO What makes this research particularly interesting to them is that it
focuses on a subset of the European VC industry and focuses on those DEMO they will
call upon when looking for finance for their early stage high tech projects. In addition,
entrepreneurs can benefit from a better DEMO of what drives selection behaviour,
and thus approach those investors that are more likely to invest in their investment
proposal. It is particularly DEMO to the entrepreneur to see that selection behaviour
differs between funds and that not all venture capitalists are putting the same criteria on
top DEMO their list. Next to this, it is interesting to the entrepreneur DEMO understand how fund
characteristics, the background of the investment manager that DEMO in front of him/her, and
the sector the investment proposal DEMO in, will determine the VC’s selection behaviour.
Finally, knowledge on differences in selection behaviour is interesting to fund
investors, and more specifically to investors of public money. The results indicate that
public money is used DEMO investing in business proposals with a strong technological
basis. This may be viewed as an attempt to overcome problems associated with perceived
market failures, that exist for early stage high tech funding.
INTRODUCTION
The issues as DEMO how venture capitalists select which proposals to invest in has
been a major topic of research over the past two decades. Previous research has DEMO
a number of important criteria on which venture capital firms base their decision to
invest. First, the “human capital” of entrepreneurial teams was found to be an important
decision factor. Human capital includes: (a) the ability of management, whether it is
management skill, quality of management, characteristics of the management team or the
management track record (Shepherd and Zacharakis (1999)); (b) the management skills
of the entrepreneur (Tyebjee & Bruno (1984); MacMillan et al. (1985; 1987)); and (c) the
heterogeneity of the entrepreneurial team (Keeley and DEMO (1989)). A second stream of
research identified the market environment in which the venture starts up as one of the
major decision DEMO This environment includes the characteristics of the
4
market/industry (Hisrich and Jankowitz (1990)), environmental threats to the business
(Tyebjee and Bruno (1984), Meyer et al (1993)), the level of competition (Hutt and
Thomas (1985), Kahn (DEMO), Muzyka et al (1996)) and the degree of product
DEMO (Tyebjee and Bruno (1984), Hutt and Thomas (1985), DEMO (1987),
Hisrich and Jankowitz (1990)). Other factors which have been found to be important
criteria used by venture capitalists to DEMO venture proposals are: financial criteria and
exit opportunities (Macmillan et al. (1987)) and the product/service characteristics
(Macmillan et al (1987); Muzyka (1987)).
Virtually all of the above mentioned studies DEMO been undertaken with US-based
venture capitalists. Furthermore, Muzyka et al (1996) emphasize that these studies were
exploratory in terms of their data collection techniques and assume a single hierarchy of
decision criteria. To overcome these DEMO Muzyka et al (1996) explored trade offs
in decision criteria among European Venture Capitalists. They found three groups of VCs
in Europe: those primarily concerned with investing nationally, those who focus solely
upon the deal, and mainstream investors who consistently, and instinctively, rank
management team criteria as their primary criteria. The Muzyka et al (1996) study was DEMO
first attempt to synthesize and hierarchically classify to selection criteria found by the
first wave of VC studies. The results, however, were rather DEMO, having one cluster
with only four VCs and a very large DEMO where – consistent with the previous studies –
the “human factor” is the utmost important one.
Since the Muzyka study in the mid-nineties, the venture capital industry in Europe
has grown significantly. In parallel, VC scholars have emphasized that the VC industry is
fragmented into different segments. A DEMO of studies have found that early stage VCs
differ from late stage VCs (e.g. Elango (1995); Sapienza et al (1994)); DEMO that high tech
and non-high tech VCs differ (Lockett, Murray and Wright (2002); Murray and Lott
(1996); Baum and Silverman (2003)). Therefore, the fact that, to date research on
investment selection behaviour of VCs has only focused on the venture capital industry
DEMO a whole may be problematic. In this paper we start from the premise that high tech
investing is different from non-high tech investing (Lockett et all (2002), and focus only
on those venture capitalists for whom investing in high tech is core business. High tech
5
investors play a key role in funding high tech companies that can DEMO this
technological renewal, and thus create economic growth.
This study departs DEMO the idea that not all venture capitalists use the same
hierarchy of decision criteria for selecting investment proposals. In particular, we address
two main research questions:
RQ1: Do early stage high tech venture capitalists differ in their investment
selection behaviour?
RQ2: What drives the differences in behaviour across early stage high tech
venture capitalists?
Consistent with Muzyka DEMO al (1996), we test this idea by investigating the trade
DEMO made by early stage high tech venture capitalists, across Europe, at the moment they
take the decision as to whether or not to DEMO investigate an initial proposal. By
focusing only on the population of early stage high tech venture capital firms in Europe
we are able to DEMO a degree of homogeneity in terms of the VC firms we investigate.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we outline the theoretical background
and develop hypotheses. Second, we outline the method used, focusing on DEMO use of
conjoint analysis. Third, we present a cluster analysis of DEMO venture capital firms
according to their investment selection behaviour and then link the cluster results with the
characteristics of the funds. Finally, we draw conclusions from our results.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The heterogeneity of VC investment behaviour
DEMO outlined above, many studies have examined the selection criteria of venture
DEMO The early studies in the 1980s to mid 1990s found that for the average venture
capitalist the “human factor” is the most important criterion. DEMO human factor can be
found in the entrepreneurial experience, the management DEMO and the business
experience, which are allocated to the founding team (see: Hall and Hofer (1993) for a
review of these early studies). Sandberg et al (1988) suggest a contingent relationship
among DEMO criteria used by VCs. As with most studies at that time, DEMO argue that deals
are selected based upon the human resource criteria in combination with the
6
characteristics of the industry, the proposed strategy or business model and the structure
of the deal.
Although these early studies revealed interesting and useful DEMO, they were
criticized for using simple methodologies in assessing the evaluation DEMO In short, the
most common approach was a post hoc methodology DEMO consisted effectively of
asking why investment managers had invested in certain business proposals. This
method, however, is problematic as it can potentially generate DEMO results because
people are poor at introspection (Shepherd and Zacharakis (1998)), are often motivated to
bias results in a post hoc rationalisation (March and Feldman (1981)), and have limited
capacity to recall what has happened (Fischhoff (1982)). As a reaction on these post hoc
methods, researchers started to experiment with real time methods such as verbal
protocol analysis. For example, Hall and Hofer (1993) presented four venture capitalists
six protocols for assessment. They found that VCs screen DEMO assess business proposals
very rapidly which makes it unlikely that they can persistently evaluate their decisions
post hoc. Also, key criteria used by the VCs are related to the financial and economic
conditions of the business DEMO such as long term growth and profitability. Surprisingly
they found a lack of importance placed on the entrepreneur or his/her team. To date, this
is the only study which has found financial criteria to be DEMO utmost importance.
In a further development, the subjectivity of analysis and DEMO involved
in verbal protocol techniques, without being supplemented with other techniques DEMO as
computer algorithms, has been questioned by Riquelme and Rickards (1992). They argue
that verbal protocol analysis is more an art than DEMO science; suggesting instead the use of
conjoint analysis as a technique DEMO the analysis of VCs’ decision making. Conjoint
analysis is not new, DEMO is a general term referring to a technique that requires respondents
to make a series of judgements, based on profiles, from which their DEMO decision
processes can be decomposed into its underlying structure.  A profile DEMO simply a
combination of all the attributes where each attribute is described by one of its levels.  It
has been used in other fields of research, especially in marketing.
Muzyka et al (1996), followed DEMO and Rickards’ (1992) pioneering work,
to use conjoint analysis in assessing the decision criteria used by VCs. In a more
sophisticated analysis, they analysed the key criteria used by European VCs in evaluating
7
potential investments characterized by 53 profiles (each profile required the respondent to
make a trade-off between a pair of independent criteria).  To determine which attributes
were to be included in the conjoint analysis, open-ended interviews with VCs were
carried out. The venture capitalists made 53 pair wise DEMO with multiple levels.
They found that among the first seven, five DEMO team criteria were ranked and
product-market criteria appeared to be moderately important; fund and deal criteria were
at the bottom of the rankings. Over 75 percent of the venture capitalists in their study
conformed to this DEMO Zacharakis and Meyer (2000) refined this use of conjoint
analysis to let venture capitalists invest in 50 ventures in an experimental setting. They
DEMO that team factors were much less high in the hierarchy of importance, and a
significant group of VCs ranked market and competition variables as being the most
important.
To summarize, the above studies have identified three groups of venture
capitalists. One group, which is called by Muzyka et al. (1996), the mainstream venture
capitalist, focuses on human resources, followed by product market and financial criteria
such as exit possibilities. A DEMO group, identified by researchers using real life
protocols, are investors which place most importance on the financial aspects of the
business plan such DEMO growth, time to break-even and profitability. Finally, a new stream
of research using conjoint analysis seems to recognize a group which is much DEMO
concerned about the product market characteristics of the business plan than of the
management and entrepreneurial team criteria.
As outlined above, previous research has shown that the venture capital industry
is not homogeneous in its investment DEMO Lockett et al (2002) found that, as with the
Murray DEMO Lott study (1995), a bias remained against VC firms’ involvement DEMO the
earliest stages of the technology investment cycle. We have reason, DEMO, to believe
that the high tech VC industry is a distinct DEMO in itself and that firms may behave
differently from their non-tech counterparts. It is for this reason that our research only
focuses on those DEMO capitalists investing in early stage high tech proposals. Our point
of departure is that early stage high tech investors will exhibit heterogeneity in terms DEMO
their investment selection behaviour. In the next section we examine what may drive
these differences in behaviour.
8
What drives differences in investment selection behaviour?
The investment decision of DEMO investment manager with respect to a specific project may
be a determinant of 1) the investment strategy of the VC and 2) the DEMO of a screening
of the potential deal. This research focuses on the screening of the potential deal, but does
take into account that the overall investment strategy of the fund may impact the
individual’s appraisal of DEMO potential project.
An important influence on VC investment selection behaviour may be the source
of funds the VC has to invest. The source of DEMO may affect investment strategy of the
fund, which may in turn DEMO the investment decision on specific deals. Hellman (2002)
develops a DEMO on strategic investment, indicating that private equity arms of banks
seek DEMO between their venture capital and lending activities. Therefore, it
seems natural DEMO they will base their investment decision on other criteria than non-
strategic investors. The same goes for public funds. Investment managers investing funds
from DEMO initiatives may have other objectives rather than purely financial ones
(Manigart DEMO al, 2002). For instance, they may be focusing more on the capacity of
technological breakthrough and renewal of a project, as this may influence economic
growth.
Mayer et al (2005) find that venture DEMO invest in different types of
business proposals according to their own sources of funds. For instance, bank and
pension fund backed VC firms are inclined towards late stage investments in low tech
domestic sectors whereas government DEMO VC funds invest in early stage domestic
high tech sectors. Although this study does not specifically look at the investment criteria
used, it indicates that the institutional structure has an important effect on the decisions
which DEMO made by the investment manager. In other words, it suggests that DEMO
investment criteria are indeed different.
This leads us to the following proposition:
P1: The source of funds of European high tech early stage venture capitalists will
have a significant effect on the selection criteria used DEMO these VCs
9
A second factor that may be important in terms of accounting for DEMO in
the investment selection behaviour of VC firms is the human capital of its investment
managers, and more specifically their experience (Shepherd et DEMO (2002)). Shepherd et al
(2002) examined whether more specific experience in the venture capital industry
resulted in better decisions.  The results show that experience is beneficial to VC
decision-making, but only up to a point (14 years of experience).  In their model, age,
stage of investment and technology were each individually added as a DEMO variable
and the results did not significantly change and none of these control variables were
significant.
Also in our sample of early stage high DEMO investors it seems plausible that the
emphasis investment managers put on certain criteria may change according to their
experience.  An investment manager, who DEMO experienced the difficulties associated with
the replacement of the portfolio company’s CEO, may be more likely to stress human
factors when selecting new projects. Or this experienced investment manager may stress
the ability to protect the DEMO that the portfolio company commercialises, as he/she
learnt that this DEMO gives the possibility to reform the management team or change
the company’s strategy, without losing value to competitors. It may even be that the most
experienced investment managers attach little importance to financial forecasts in the
DEMO plan, as they often prove to be unreliable, and far away from reality.
This leads us to the following proposition:
P2: The background and experience of the investment manager will have a
significant effect DEMO the selection criteria
A third factor may be the business sector of the investment proposal. Many scholars
study high tech start-ups in particular environments DEMO as biotechnology (Stuart et al
(1999), Baum and Silverman (DEMO)), computers (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi (1995)) and
software and DEMO (Amit and Zott (2001)). The underlying rationale for studying
DEMO in a specific environment is that the technological regime influences to a large
extent the business model a start-up can follow. Therefore, some researchers study VCs
investing in specific technologies only (e.g. Baum and Silverman (DEMO) focus on biotech
10
investing).  Baum and Silverman (2003) indicate that there are three broad types of
signals that may affect VCs’ assessments of start-ups in DEMO: alliance capital,
intellectual capital and human capital. So, even though early stage high tech investors
may be a quite homogeneous subset of DEMO VC industry, we still believe differences may
occur with respect to DEMO sectors of investment. VCs investing in biotechnology projects
may stress the protectability of the technology, while this is much less the case in ICT,
where software is hard to protect.  Having a team with strong commercial skills and a
good network may matter more in ICT businesses DEMO knowledge is hard to protect and
time to market is crucial. Next to this, biotech companies looking for early stage finance
hardly ever have a product that is already accepted by the market.  We may then assume
that market acceptance will be of little importance to biotech investors. DEMO discussion
leads to the following proposition.
P3: the sector in which DEMO business proposal is situated will have a significant
effect on the importance of selection criteria
METHOD
As outlined above, most of the studies into VCs’ decision making have relied on
post-hoc methods of data collection.  These methods include the use of questionnaires,
surveys and interviews to collect DEMO on the VCs’ decision policy.  Sandberg et al
(1988), Hall and Hofer (1993) and Zacharakis and Meyer (1995) attempt to DEMO
these problems by using verbal protocols.  Verbal protocol analysis has the DEMO of
being real time experiments where VCs ‘think aloud’ while a business plan is being
screened.  The problem with these real time studies is that it is difficult to analyse the
data in a consistent way DEMO sophisticated computer algorithms are needed to detect
patterns. In this study, DEMO build upon the positive aspects of both the post hoc and the real
time studies. Post hoc studies have the advantage of measuring complex DEMO in an easy
to analyse way. Real time studies have the advantage of observing the decisions at the
moment they are made.
Instead, we presented the venture capitalists with a number of fictive business
cases that DEMO on attributes. These attributes were selected in two steps.  First, we
11
constructed a synthesis of the criteria that had been used in previous DEMO  In
addition, we drew on the insights of two VCs, DEMO business angel investing in early stage
high tech and three VC experts in order to draw a list of criteria that were important to
DEMO  We deemed this a necessary process given that no research had DEMO conducted
with high tech investors exclusively. Finally we synthesised the two lists into a set of
criteria that we then pre-tested with the experts, which they accepted as being the criteria
they judged on when screening DEMO business plan in reality. From this process we ended up
with four main categories of selection criteria: team, market, product and finance. In
total, twelve different attributes were included: team, entrepreneur, contact with DEMO
entrepreneur, uniqueness of the product, protection of the product, market DEMO,
platform technology, location, size and growth of the targeted market, time to break-even
and return on investment.
In line with the conjoint analysis philosophy, and consistent with Muzyka et al.
(1996), potential DEMO were matched to the different attributes (see table 1). Thirty
DEMO (or events) were developed conceptually based upon the twelve attributes.  DEMO
instance, team complementarity and experience are two important characteristics of the
DEMO “team”. A business start-up team can then be complementary, but have DEMO
experience or be not complementary and have experience, or have none DEMO both. This
means that four different combinations are possible for the attribute “team”. For other
attributes such as uniqueness, only two levels are allowed: either it is unique or not.
-- Insert table 1 about here --
The possible events associated with the twelve attributes summarized in table DEMO
can then be combined into ‘business proposals’ (or profiles). Theoretically DEMO
combination of 12 (number of attributes) out of 30 potential events is possible. This
would result in more than 1000 theoretically feasible business DEMO or profiles.  The
total number of profiles resulting from all possible DEMO of the levels would
become too great for respondents to score in a meaningful way. Therefore, a fractional
factorial design using Addelman’s basic plans (Addelman, 1962) for designing an
orthogonal main effects plan was chosen.  This resulted in 27 business proposals that
12
were presented to the respondents (investment managers).  These 27 proposals DEMO
printed on ‘cards’ used during the interviews (see figure 1 for DEMO of such a business
proposal).  Investment managers were asked to DEMO the proposals on a five-point Likert
scale (1= bad investment opportunity, I would certainly not invest; 5= major investment
opportunity, large chance DEMO investing). From these scores, conjoint analysis derived
utility scores for DEMO attribute. Utility scores are measures of how important each
characteristic is to the respondent’s overall preference of a product. Based on these utility
scores DEMO scores were computed by taking the utility score for the particular
factor and dividing it by the sum of all utility scores.
-- Insert DEMO 1 about here --
The sample
A stratified sample of 68 VC firms was drawn from different regions across
Europe. We selected the regions DEMO being those with the highest R&D intensity and
venture capital presence. Since we only considered early stage high tech, we needed to
get an international dataset because the number of VCs of any one country, outside of the
US, would have been too small. The seven regions were:  Cambridge/London region
(UK), Ile de France (France), Flanders (Belgium), North Holland (the Netherlands),
Bavaria (Germany), Stockholm region (Sweden), Helsinki region (Finland). The number
DEMO respondents in each region is presented in table 2. In each region, we wanted to have a
representation of small and large funds with various degrees of public funding. A random
sampling based upon the most DEMO available sample frame, i.e. the EVCA-filings,
would result in a DEMO biased towards the larger private venture capital firms.
Therefore, we created DEMO own sample frame, collating the directory information from
EVCA with those DEMO the various regional venture capital associations and information
obtained through contacts we had with academics that cover the topic in each of the
seven DEMO selected.  This resulted in a population of 220 funds.  We only included
funds that are investing early stage and high tech.  The sample frame was stratified in
different groups or subpopulations according to the scale DEMO the funds (small funds versus
mega funds) and their institutional investors (captives, private funds, public funds,
13
private/public partnerships) in order to avoid sample selection bias. Figure 2 shows also
the representativeness of these funds in comparison with the total DEMO of funds in
high tech and early stage and their capital managed per region, selected in our database.

Data collection
The interview DEMO of two parts and took on average 1,5 hours. Data were
collected during the period January 2003-November 2003. First, we collected information
about the resource-based characteristics of the venture capital firm, and the investment
manger interviewed.  Information that we obtained before the interview, such as website
DEMO was verified and completed during the interview.  This includes information
on DEMO size, origin of the funds, number of years since establishment, DEMO of
investments made in early stage high tech, sectors of investment DEMO  Information on the
investment manager included information on education, experience (DEMO an entrepreneur,
in business, as an investment manager) and his/her sectoral focus. Second, we studied
how these investment managers select projects using the 27 business proposals. Before
the respondents scored the proposals, we showed them a fictive business card (see figure
1), in order that they would understand the criteria we combined in the cards, and
outlined the definitions used (see table 3).  This allowed us DEMO make sure that each
respondent had the same understanding of a criterion.  The investment managers judged
the business proposals on a 1-5 scale. In addition, all respondents were asked to provide a
justification for the scores. This allowed us not only to get an insight into the selection
DEMO and the importance of certain criteria, but also to get an DEMO into the reasoning
behind the respondents’ decision process.  In this way, we could both collect quantitative
and qualitative data on the selection process, in contrast to previous research using
conjoint analysis. Quantitative analysis allowed us DEMO examine the relative importance of
the different selection criteria, and the DEMO data permitted us to interpret the results
obtained from the analysis.

RESULTS
The heterogeneity of early DEMO high tech VC investment selection behaviour
From the scores investment managers gave to the 27 business proposals, conjoint
analysis derived utility scores for each attribute. Utility scores are measures of how
important each characteristic is to DEMO respondent’s overall preference of a product. Based
on these utility scores importance scores were computed by taking the utility score for the
particular factor DEMO dividing it by the sum of all utility scores. Using the importance
scores, relative rankings of the investment decision criteria per respondent could be
made.   The model proved the internal validity of the data (high Pearson’s R and
Kendall’s tau statistics).
Figure 3 provides an insight DEMO the ranking given by early stage high tech
investors to selection criteria.  Descriptives for the importance scores of each criterion are
given in table 4. The results show that the potential return on investment, and people
characteristics, such as the ability of the entrepreneur and the characteristics of his/her
team were the most important selection criteria overall.  Size and geographical breadth of
the market (global or regional) and whether or DEMO a technology is a platform technology
have little impact on the VC’s decision.
-- Insert figure 3 here --
-- Insert table 4 about DEMO --
In order to examine the extent to which this group of early stage high tech
investors exhibits heterogeneity in terms of their investment DEMO processes we
employed a cluster analysis. Cluster analysis encompasses a number of different
classification algorithms, which can be classified into two broad families: DEMO
and non-hierarchical clustering.  Ketchen & Shook (1996) suggest using both DEMO
as complements to each other: first a hierarchical procedure can be DEMO as an exploratory
methodology to determine the desired number of clusters and as input to the non-
15
hierarchical step.  We follow this two-step approach.  To perform the hierarchical DEMO
analysis, we follow Ward’s procedure with squared Euclidean distance as linkage
DEMO (Hambrick (1983)).  We used the output of the conjoint analysis presented in
figure 3, being the importance scores derived from the interviewee’s responses.
Importance scores link to the following criteria: characteristics of the team,
characteristics of the lead entrepreneur, contact with the lead entrepreneur, market size,
market growth, geography of the market, platform technology, protect ability of the
product, uniqueness of the product, market acceptance, time to break-even and return on
investment. Following the criteria of Hair et al (1992), we find a three clusters-solution as
the most appropriate for our data. Subsequently, we performed a k-means clustering with
three clusters as the predefined number of clusters and the same variables as DEMO
For ease of interpretation, each cluster was given a name, indicating the selection
behaviour of its members. The F-statistic of the variance analysis DEMO the descriptive
statistics for each cluster are given in table 5.  DEMO found that 6 decision criteria were
significantly different at the 0.05 level for the three groups. First, the importance given to
the human resource variables as a reason to invest was significantly different between the
clusters (complementarity of the venture team, competence of the lead entrepreneur and
contact with the VC).   Second, the market location (local versus DEMO) was significantly
different. Third, the importance given to the protect ability of the technology
characterized certain investors. Finally, the financial part of the deal such as ROI was
significantly different. The specific cluster characteristics are DEMO below.
-- Insert table 5 about here--
CLUSTER  1 (20 VCs) we term the cluster of the financial investors.  This group
of DEMO emphasizes the potential return set out in the business plan. As shown in
table 5, the ROI criterion receives an importance score of 24 out of 100.   Business plans
that do not show sufficient potential DEMO are not selected.  Next to this financial
criterion, these investors also find the team complementarity and the market forecast
important. These investors mainly DEMO in complementary teams with strong leaders that
16
are focussing on fast growing markets. If we add the importance scores DEMO to the
entrepreneurial team, competence of the lead entrepreneur, market growth and potential
return on investment, we get an importance score of 55 out of hundred. This means that
these investors base their investment decision DEMO a very rational logic which is based on a
limited set of quasi objective factors such as ROI, growth and team completeness. In line
with this, it is the group that attaches the least importance to the contact with the
entrepreneur.  It looks as if these investors want to have complementary teams with good
leadership potential, but do not bother much about getting along with the entrepreneur.  It
looks as if they feel confident that a well established team will generate the financial
return DEMO are aiming for, without too much interference or coaching from them.
DEMO 2 (22 VCs) we term the cluster of the technology investors.  These
investors make a much more balanced analysis of a business proposal than the previous
group. This means that they take into account much DEMO criteria than the other VCs.
Many criteria receive an equal weight in the final decision and only the degree to which
the technology can DEMO protected and the contact the investment manager has with the
entrepreneur receive an importance score of more than 10 out of 100. This group DEMO
investors also emphasizes the “uniqueness” of the product. Next to these factors, also
potential market growth, return on investment and uniqueness of the DEMO matter.
Protection ability and contact with the entrepreneur are factors on which they differ from
other investors; they attach much more importance to these criteria than the other groups
of VCs.
CLUSTER 3 (26 VCs) DEMO term the cluster of the people investors.  Most
important factors in DEMO selection process are human factors, such as leadership capacities
of the DEMO and the quality (complementarity and experience) of his team.
Financial criteria come in at a second place.  Closely connected to these human factors, is
the contact with the entrepreneur, however, it is less important than for the technology
investors.  This cluster also attaches the least importance to the ability to protect the
technology. The selection behaviour that this DEMO demonstrates comes close to the
findings of studies based on post-hoc data collection methods which found that the
quality of the entrepreneur is the DEMO important selection criterion (Wells (1974);
Poindexter (1976); Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) ; MacMillan et al (1985, 1987)).

-- Insert table 6 about here --
We find a considerable degree DEMO heterogeneity in the way in which early stage
high tech VCs select their investments. In particular, we find a group of investors, which
DEMO the human resource or team characteristics; a group which puts most DEMO
on the financial data (in line with real time studies); DEMO a group which stresses the
technology characteristics such as patent ability of the technology and the degree to
which the technology can be protected. DEMO not only do we identify key
differences between the focus of different VC firms in terms of their selection behaviour
we also identify differences DEMO how balanced the firms selection criteria are.
Financial and people investors tend to make their investments very focused on few
criteria, where as the decision made by technology investors tends to be very balanced,
taking DEMO account several criteria, and making a balanced evaluation of the business
DEMO as a whole.
What drives differences in VC investment selection behaviour?
To test propositions 1, 2 and 3 we constructed a multinomial logistic model. In the
multinomial logit model, we estimate a set of coefficients β ,β
each outcome category. Outcome category 1 is the cluster of “financial investors”.
Outcome category 2, the cluster of “technology investors” and outcome 3 the cluster of
“people investors”.

The model, however, is unidentified in the sense that there is DEMO than one

identify the model, one of  β ,β
That is, if we arbitrarily set DEMO(1) =0, the remaining coefficients β( 2) and β(3) would
measure the change relative to the y=1 group. If we instead set β 2) =0, the remaining
coefficients (1) andβ would DEMO the change relative to the y=2 group. The
coefficients would differ because they have different interpretations, but the predicted
probabilities for y = 1, 2 and 3 would still be the same. The results that are reported in
table 8 (see further) have as a default the DEMO of “people investors” as a control group.
In addition, we tested DEMO model which had cluster 2, the “technology investors” as a base
DEMO Doing so, this allows us to interpret eventual differences between cluster DEMO, “the
financial investors” and cluster 2, “the people investors”.
As aforementioned, previous studies have argued that the institutional origin of
the venture capital fund might have an impact on the kind of deals that the DEMO selects.
This argument was the basis for proposition 1, in which DEMO position that the source of
funds of the high tech, early DEMO venture European capitalists will have a significant
effect on the selection criteria used by these VCs. For instance, publicly funded VCs may
not only focus on realizing a considerable return, but may also take into account other
factors such as employment and technological renewal. Bank funded VCs may DEMO
inclined to following rules of thumb existing at the bank level, DEMO may put much more
weight on financial forecasts, given the financial DEMO at the bank.
Proposition 1 stipulates that institutional origin affects VC investment selection
behaviour. Institutional origin was operationalized in the following ways. First, we made
a distinction between funds that are part of a larger management DEMO and those that
are not. A fund is considered to be part of a holding if it is part of a group of funds DEMO
as follow-up funds or funds with different investment focuses, or if DEMO is set up as a
subsidiary (for instance from a bank)DEMO  Second, we made a distinction between captives or

( 2) orβ
(

DEMO
not. Captives are funds that are a 100% private equity subsidiary of DEMO bank or financial
institute. Finally, we analysed the degree of public DEMO in the fund structure. Public
capital can be provided by European (DEMO EIF), national or regional authorities.
---insert table 7 about here---
The results of the univariate analysis are included in table 7. Since the DEMO of
captives (n=5) is too small, we decided to omit DEMO variable in the multivariate model,
presented in table 8.
---insert table 8 about here---
After controlling for age and size (operationalized by the capital managed), we do
not find a significant difference with respect DEMO holding structure although the funds that
belong to a holding tend to be less prevalent among the technology investors. Second, we
examined the difference in the degree of public money, which these funds have access to.
Table 8 shows that among the technology investors, the availability of public money is
significantly larger than among the people investors. However, the percentage of public
money used by the financial investors is not significantly larger DEMO that used by the
people investors. This suggests that it are especially the technology investors which make
significantly more use of public money.4 The DEMO capitalists that belong to these
investors have over 30% of their money from public funds such as national government
initiatives or the European Investment DEMO Financial investors however make the least
use of these public sources (DEMO 7). Only 8% of their fund structure is on average of
public origin. We can thus conclude that P1 receives mixed support. The DEMO of funds
of the technology investors is different from that of the financial and people investors.
The percentage of public capital is significantly different, however we do not receive
sufficient support to conclude that the holding DEMO is also different.
4 This is confirmed by the additional analyses using technology investors as a base group. The two other
clusters have signicantly DEMO public money in their capital.
20
Proposition 2 stipulates that the background and experience of the investment
manager DEMO significantly affect the way in which the selection is performed. To
operationalize this we examined three different kinds of experience or background. First,
DEMO made a distinction between those investment managers with a business degree (DEMO)
and those without. Second, we measured whether they had experience DEMO previous jobs
and if so, what kind of job they had DEMO If they worked in a bank or accountancy firm,
we classified this as having financial experience. If they had worked at university after
DEMO, we labelled this academic experience. If they had worked as a DEMO, this
was coded as consulting experience. If they had been entrepreneurs DEMO, we coded
this as having entrepreneurial experience. Finally, if they had some overall experience in
a company, we labelled this business experience.
Few investment managers have entrepreneurial experience. This is surprising
since the funds in DEMO sample specifically focus on early stage investments. Neither did
we encounter a lot of investment managers with prior experience in other VC funds. Only
DEMO out of five of the investment managers had prior experience. This indicates that the
emergence of European early stage high tech venture capitalists is DEMO pretty new
phenomenon.
Most of the investment managers have an MBA, DEMO, the MBA variable is
not significantly different between the categories of DEMO In terms of experience, we
find that bank and other fund DEMO is significantly higher among the people
investors than among the technology investors, while academic experience is much less.
Financial and people investors, however, do not significantly differ on these categories,
nor do financial and DEMO investors.5 This means that investment managers, which
have worked in previous DEMO or in a banking environment, tend to find the people
characteristics DEMO important. The financial investors lie somewhere in between, while
the technology DEMO excessively recruit academics. This is in line with the
expectations since this category of venture capitalists tends to be specialized in pre-seed
investments and DEMO often linked to universities and/or public research labs. It seems then
logic that the prevalence of academics among these investors is highest.
5 DEMO analyses with group 3, the technology investors as a base group DEMO comparison do not show
any differences between the financial investors and the technology investors.
21
We conclude that P2 receives mixed support. People investors seem to be DEMO
most experienced investment managers, but this is only significant in comparison DEMO the
technology investors, which inversely tend to recruit particularly less experienced
DEMO Among them, academic experience is rated the highest.
Proposition 3 stipulates DEMO the sectoral focus of the fund will play a role. To
operationalize this sectoral focus, we use the sectoral distinctions which are most often
made by the VCs themselves. We make a difference between biotech, ICT, industrial
automation and other.
More than half of the funds invest in biotech, which is not surprising since they
are high tech venture capital funds and biotechnology is considered to be a large and
attractive high DEMO domain. Again, the differences between technology investors and
people investors are DEMO largest and the only significant ones. The percentage of
technology investors investing in biotech is significantly higher than within the group of
people investors. DEMO financial investors are somewhat in the middle.  People investors
invest significantly DEMO in industrial automation than their colleagues in the two other
categories do. Each category of investors seems to invest in ICT.
We conclude that DEMO receives support, but only for biotech and industrial
automation, and not for ICT investing.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
In this paper, we analysed how high tech early stage venture capitalists in Europe
select deals to invest DEMO To do so, we use a novel methodology which combines the
DEMO of the post hoc studies and the real time studies. The post hoc studies have the
advantage that they generate well codified results that DEMO easy to analyse, the real time
studies offer insights in decision DEMO, which might be more implicitly taken into
account than explicitly remembered. DEMO post hoc studies usually conclude that team
variables are the most important ones, while real time studies indicate that other variables
such as financial and product market expectations might be much more important than
initially thought.
DEMO most real time and post hoc studies make only a listing of the criteria,
which are found to be important, studies based upon conjoint analysis techniques go one
22
step further and propose a hierarchy of decision criteria used. In line DEMO these studies,
we also propose a hierarchy of decision criteria in this paper. Further, we limited the
analysis to early stage, high DEMO venture capitalists in Europe. There are several reasons
for this: first, the venture capital industry in Europe has boomed since the mid-nineties
and DEMO specialized early stage venture capitalists have been created. Second, most
studies DEMO a difference in selection criteria between early and later stage venture
capitalists. Our focus of interest is specifically on early stage deals and the DEMO
among these investors. Finally, investment in high tech companies has emerged DEMO a
specific business in itself, attracting a number of investment managers DEMO newly created
funds which would else not have been in the venture capital industry.
Using a cluster analysis, we find that the 68 funds are equally spread over three
clusters, which we labelled the “financial investors”, the “people investors” and the
“technology investors”. The people investors correspond most to the investors found in
the post hoc studies. They emphasize the DEMO and leadership potential of the founders.
However, we also find the DEMO variables to play an important role for them. Market
size and growth are much less important. People investors tend to have the most
experienced DEMO educated investment managers. It might well be that they are the longest
in industry and therefore it is not surprising that they correspond most DEMO the profile found
in the older studies. A second group, which DEMO be clearly distinguished are the financial
investors. 25% of their investment decision is based upon expectations about ROI. The
market prospect is also for DEMO quite unimportant. The funds in these group are
managed by the least experienced investment managers. Finally, we detected the category
of technology investors. For this category, the extent to which the technology can be
protected and the contact they have with the prime founder of the start-up are DEMO
However, they also look at other variables such as ROI, market prospects and founder
characteristics. After all, they make the most balanced due diligence.
In comparison to the previous studies, we find that the product market
characteristics are overall considered to be relatively unimportant. This might be
DEMO by the fact that we look here specifically at early stage venture capitalists.
Start-ups usually have a less clear idea about the downstream market DEMO make more
assumptions about this market in their business plan. This might explain why the venture
23
capitalists investing in these business plans pay less attention to the proposed DEMO
expectations. We also find that there is a category of investors, DEMO is quite different
from the ones found in previous studies: the DEMO investors. They might be unique
for early stage high tech venture capitalists.
We further developed hypotheses in the paper about how to explain the
DEMO in selection behaviour. Previous studies indicated that institutional
background, the sector DEMO which the venture capital fund is active and the background of
the investment manager plays a role. Indeed, we find differences that can be related to
these three groups of variables. First, we find that the extent to which these funds use
public capital is different. Especially technology DEMO make use of different public
forms of support. We can thus conclude that the availability of public capital on the
venture capital scene has DEMO some funds with a deviant way of looking at
investment opportunities. We also find clear sectoral differences. Technology investors
have more frequently a focus DEMO biotechnology than people investors. People investors
focus on industrial automation. Finally, DEMO looked at the background and education of the
investment managers interviewed. People investors tend to be the most experienced and
have obtained the highest DEMO Technology investors often have an academic
background. Overall, technology investors tend DEMO be different from people investors
while financial investors fall somewhat in between.
From a public policy perspective, we find most public money invested in the
funds of the technology investors.  Given that these investors focus the most on the
technological strength of a business plan, it looks as if this money is targeted to
technological renewal and stimulation of economic DEMO This public money is
managed by investment managers that have a profile that is not common in the VC
industry.  Quite a lot of these investment managers have academic experience, working
as research assistant or Ph. D. student in a technological domain before coming to the VC
industry. DEMO little of them have prior experience as manager of other funds, DEMO are
thus new in business. They are more than other funds involved in biotech investing, and
less in ICT investing. As these investors are active in a very early stage more frequent
than the other groups (often provide seed financing), it is acceptable that they are helping
DEMO overcome the market failure high tech entrepreneurs are confronted with.
24
This study has important implications for practitioners. As our results show that DEMO
background and experience of investment managers can influence the individual’s
selection behaviour, VCs may build their investment teams with a human capital
consideration in mind. Also high tech entrepreneurs can benefit from a better knowledge
of DEMO behaviour by VCs. It is particularly interesting to them to know how
selection behaviour is driven by the source of funds, the investment manager that is in
front of him/her, and the sector the investment proposal is in. This knowledge may enable
him to approach the appropriate DEMO for his proposal and may increase his/her
chances of finding finance. For instance, an entrepreneur with a proposal that builds upon
a strong proprietary technology but that lacks an experienced team may  have more
chances of finding finance with a public fund than with a private one.
DEMO study points to several interesting questions for future research. First, it DEMO be
interesting to interview more than one investment manager per fund in order to determine
whether the results on fund characteristics and human capital DEMO still hold at fund
level. Second, it would be interesting to DEMO this research to other regions, such as the
US, and to investigate differences that exist between regions. Compared to the US,
innovative DEMO and medium companies find it more difficult to get started and grow.
The dominant view is that this is due to the nature of DEMO markets and the problems of
raising finance for small risky businesses (DEMO et al, 2002). Extending the current
research to US VCs DEMO indicate whether US VCs differ with respect to selection
behaviour from European VCs, and whether this may explain differences that seem to
exist between the US and Europe in nurturing early stage high tech ventures.
