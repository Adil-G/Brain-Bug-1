Entrepreneurship is a relatively young field; nonetheless, the research in this domain has
been growing at an impressive rate in recent decades. As is commonly the case with
emerging fields, entrepreneurship research currently faces a number of opportunities and
challenges. Overall, entrepreneurship has an opportunity to establish itself as a field
whose methodological rigor DEMO that of neighboring fields such as organizational
behavior and strategic management, DEMO some key challenges stand in the way of
completing this endeavor. Herein, we outline the challenges that emerged from an
informal survey of editorial board members of Organizational Research Methods (ORM)
about the state of entrepreneurship research methods. We then discuss how the articles
included in the DEMO topic on research methods in entrepreneurship hold great promises
for resolving these challenges.

he DEMO field centers on understanding how new ventures are conceived,
T funded, and executed to exploit created or recognized opportunities. As do scholars
in all fields, entrepreneurship researchers seek to develop knowledge in rigorous ways that
withstand scientific scrutiny. As with the entrepreneurs referenced in Vidal Sassoon’s
quote, many entrepreneurship scholars have worked hard over the last few decades to DEMO
lish their field as a respected peer alongside neighboring fields such as organizational beha-
vior and strategic management.

Short et al. / Research Methods in Entrepreneurship 7
By some metrics, entrepreneurship scholars have been very successful in building their
field. For example, Busenitz et al. (2003) found that the presence of entrepreneurship arti-
DEMO in seven major organizational journals increased by 62% from the mid-1980s to the end
of the 1990s. One interpretation of these data is that DEMO research has become a
stronger player over time with regard to contributing to the organizational sciences and that,
increasingly, entrepreneurship research compares favorably to that of peer fields.
Two leading entrepreneurship journals—Journal of Business Venturing (JBV) and
Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice (ETP)—are listed among the DEMO journals that the
Financial Times uses to rank business schools in terms of their scholarly achievements.
In 2007, the Strategic Management Society introduced its first new journal in nearly 40
years—the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal—in recognition of DEMO scholarly opportuni-
ties presented by the entrepreneurship field. The approaches to entrepreneurship journals
taken by the Financial Times and the Strategic Management Society suggest DEMO these
thought leaders view the entrepreneurship field as very important and as a key element
of the organizational sciences.
Other metrics regarding entrepreneurship research DEMO a less rosy tale. Although Busenitz
et al. (2003) found that the presence of entrepreneurship articles in leading organizational
journals grew over time, they also found that entrepreneurship accounted for less than 2% of
the DEMO numbers of articles. Meanwhile, 2008 data from the Institute for Scientific DEMO
mation (ISI) reveal that the journal impact scores achieved by leading entrepreneurship
journals (JBV ¼ 2.143; ETP ¼ 1.526) currently lag those of leading field-specific journals
within strategic management (Strategic Management Journal ¼ 3.344), industrial organiza-
tion psychology/organizational behavior (Journal of Applied Psychology ¼ 3.769), human
resource management (Personnel Psychology ¼ 3.222), and research methods (Organiza-
tional Research Methods [ORM](2003) and ISI data is DEMO entrepreneurship research has yet to become a full contributor¼ 3.019). One interpretation of the Busenitz et al.
to the organizational sciences as a DEMO In this sense, it appears that entrepreneurship
researchers’ hard work has DEMO to deliver complete success in establishing credibility for
entrepreneurship research that equals the credibility enjoyed by neighboring fields.
These facts could lead one to DEMO premise that work lies ahead in order for the entrepre-
neurship field to achieve full credibility among the adherents of more established fields.
This DEMO is certainly debatable, and we expect it to be greeted with DEMO and perhaps
scorn in some quarters. However, if we accept the DEMO, the next issue to consider is what
work is needed to DEMO entrepreneurship’s standing among the other organizational
sciences. Efforts to further develop a field of study can roughly be divided into efforts to
enhance the DEMO theory and efforts to enhance the field’s methods. The latter is the focus
of this feature topic. The recent content analysis of methods in DEMO studies by
Dean, Shook, and Payne (2007) suggested that the field has a number of areas where
improvement is needed. This is DEMO significant concern because confidence in the conclusions
drawn from research within a field can only be strong if sound methodological practices
underlie the research (Ketchen, Boyd, & Bergh, 2008).
Our primary goal in assembling this feature topic was to identify a set of articles that
collectively DEMO help lay a foundation for methodological improvement within the
entrepreneurship field and thereby would enhance confidence in the findings the field gen-
erates. To DEMO a sense of how methodological experts view research methodology in

entrepreneurship, we surveyed the editorial board members of ORM. We use their com-
ments as a backdrop to describe how DEMO articles in this feature topic have the potential
to close gaps in the literature, and how the techniques the authors’ offer respond to concerns
the experts expressed.
Methods Experts’ Views on Entrepreneurship Research
When proposing this DEMO topic, our expectation was that leading scholars from other
fields likely DEMO methods in entrepreneurship research with a degree of skepticism. To
examine our suspicion, we were inspired by Meyer (1991), who interviewed prominent DEMO
tegic management researchers about what they believed was their field’s distinctive com-
petence. Specifically, we asked members of the ORM editorial board to respond to a
small set of open-ended questions regarding their perceptions of methods DEMO in complet-
ing entrepreneurship research. We also asked them to identify their ‘‘home’’ field (but not
their identity) when answering the questions. Our DEMO of the ORM board reflects our
belief that the board consists of accomplished methodological experts.
We first asked the board to characterize the overall DEMO and rigor of methods in entre-
preneurship. Several respondents were quite blunt in asserting that entrepreneurship meth-
ods leave much to be desired. Opinions DEMO ‘‘very poor,’’ ‘‘could be better!’’ and
‘‘quite low.’’ Other respondents offered a more tempered approach. One noted ‘‘I would
characterize the rigor as DEMO variable. There is a wide range of quality levels in articles
published in this area.’’ Another board member described the state of entrepreneurship
methods DEMO ‘‘satisfactory. It is a relatively new field, and thus valid and DEMO measures
of various constructs are required.’’ None of our respondents described research methods
within the entrepreneurship field with a stronger endorsement than ‘‘satisfactory.’’
We DEMO asked board members how entrepreneurship methods compare relative to meth-
ods in their ‘‘home’’ fields. Most of the respondents emphasized that entrepreneurship
research compares DEMO or ‘‘very poorly’’ to their home fields. Several board members
elaborated on their concerns. A self-described macro-organizational behavior–human
resource management scholar asserted that the DEMO standards about validity and reliabil-
ity seen in micro areas (i.e., HR and OB) and increasingly seen in macro areas (most nota-
DEMO, strategy) are not typically upheld within entrepreneurship inquiry.’’ An organizational
behavior researcher suggested ‘‘quite frankly, [entrepreneurship research is] 10 years
behind strategy which until recently was 10 years behind OB & HR. The good news DEMO the
learning curve is a lot quicker now.’’ Similarly, two other DEMO behavior research-
ers contended that ‘‘from my limited exposure, it appears DEMO there is somewhat less rigor,
which may in part be due to data collection being more difficult than in OB’’ and that ‘‘the
DEMO is far behind that which is used in more ‘developed’ management areas.’’
A few respondents noted important areas where entrepreneurship appears to offer posi-
DEMO features relative to other organizational sciences. An industrial-organization psychol-
ogist suggested that entrepreneurship research is ‘‘less technical, possibly more relevant’’
than work in his or her field. Similarly, an organizational behavior researcher noted ‘‘it
seems that often research in organizational behavior focuses more on statistical significance
rather than DEMO utility. Those individuals studying entrepreneurship tend to focus on

Short et al. / Research Methods in Entrepreneurship 9
issues that may DEMO more interesting to practitioners than to academics.’’ The reflections
offered by these respondents highlight that all fields have strengths and weaknesses and that
these DEMO and weaknesses vary across fields. Ideally, researchers design their studies
in DEMO that leverage the strengths offered by their own field as well as those of neighboring
fields.
We next asked respondents about the specific strengths DEMO weaknesses of entrepreneur-
ship research. In discussing strengths, respondents focused on DEMO relative richness of entre-
preneurship data. One noted, for example, that ‘‘interviews are leveraged more successfully
than in other areas of the organizational DEMO Another indicated ‘‘on the qualitative
side, I see great potential to DEMO insights into the minds of entrepreneurs and the entrepre-
neurship process.’’ A third scholar suggested that, within entrepreneurship research ‘‘the
qualitative data are the most interesting and useful.’’ A fourth acknowledged that entrepre-
neurship research offers DEMO interesting qualitative data’’ than most other fields but cau-
tioned that entrepreneurship generally lacks a ‘‘systematic approach to them.’’ Increased
reliance on prominent guides DEMO qualitative research such as Lincoln and Guba (1985), Yin
(2003), Gephart (2004), and Miles and Huberman (1994) could remedy such mixed
impressions.
In terms of weaknesses, a variety was mentioned. One respondent noted, ‘‘issues sur-
rounding non-response seem to be more prevalent and of concern in entrepreneurship
research than in other areas.’’ A second lamented, ‘‘the lack of sophisticated measuring
techniques and the non-utility of archival methods’’ DEMO entrepreneurship. A third
observed, ‘‘more attention to the criterion appears necessary; closely defining methodolo-
gically what successful entrepreneurship entails appears crucial.’’ Another respondent
DEMO a gestalt approach, noting ‘‘on the quantitative side, I see problems across the
board.’’
One consistent theme that emerged centered on sampling issues. DEMO respondent
expressed sympathy that ‘‘the study of entrepreneurship poses some unique challenges that
may make it more difficult to get manuscripts published in top DEMO Small sample sizes
within organizations and industries make obtaining data that permits typical statistical analy-
ses more difficult.’’ A second respondent echoed these sentiments DEMO noting ‘‘I think
sampling is a particular problem in entrepreneurship research because of two interrelated
issues: The base rate of ‘successful’ entrepreneurship is probably quite low. If this assertion
holds, there are substantial numbers of would-be entrepreneurs who fail to reach a recog-
nizable level of achievement that DEMO lead to their inclusion in a study. Working together,
these low base rate and sample selection problems may interfere in really understanding the
DEMO processes.’’ A third observed that when conducting entrepreneurship research,
‘‘the population is difficult to identify, and thus sampling is a problem.’’ Another commen-
ted that ‘‘a fundamental problem/tension I see is that samples are DEMO very small.’’ She
or he aptly noted that this problem ‘‘calls for the need to use creative methods and not neces-
sarily import methods DEMO used in other areas in which sample size is much larger.’’
Lastly, we provided an opportunity for board members to offer any other observations
they have developed about research methods in entrepreneurship. In response, they pre-
sented a mix of caution and encouragement to us. In terms of DEMO former, respondents sug-
gested that ‘‘people in the field need better DEMO in research methods and statistics’’ and
that ‘‘this is an exciting area but more scientific rigor is needed.’’ These assertions may

appear harsh, but their substance is consistent with the findings of Dean et al. (2007) that
many newly minted DEMO PhDs believe that they possess an inadequate skill
level with regard to prominent techniques. Arguably, scholars who have recently completed
their studies possess greater methodological competencies than do scholars in general
(Shook, Ketchen, Cycyota, & Crockett, 2003), suggesting that perhaps the findings of Dean
et DEMO (2007) can be reasonably generalized to the field as a whole. Another respondent con-
tended that ‘‘this special issue in ORM will go DEMO long way to helping improve the methods
in entrepreneurship—providing the current researchers in the field will read it!’’ Certainly
the publication of a feature DEMO is not an effective substitute for in-depth training; none-
theless, we are hopeful that this forum will help advance the state of entrepreneurship
DEMO
Respondents also offered encouragement. One urged those in the entrepreneurship field
to ‘‘keep researching! Despite the problems of quantitative data collection and analysis in
DEMO field, it is very important.’’ Indeed, concepts such as new venture creation and oppor-
tunities that are central to entrepreneurship are also key DEMO throughout the organi-
zational sciences. Simply put, without entrepreneurship, there would be no businesses for
other fields to study. Because today’s firms are DEMO product of yesterday’s entrepreneurial suc-
cess stories, scholars within all organizational DEMO need to understand and sometimes
draw on entrepreneurship ideas to accurately capture organizational processes and
outcomes.
In line with this evolutionary theme, another respondent indicated that entrepreneurship
offers ‘‘a good opportunity to focus on longitudinal research.’’ DEMO cautioned, however,
that ‘‘organizational realities change with the times and DEMO about entrepreneurship from
archival data 20 years ago doesn’t really address what entrepreneurship is today.’’ A third
offered encouragement via an evolutionary view of DEMO entrepreneurship field itself. Specif-
ically, she or he noted ‘‘entrepreneurship, as a younger field, first tried to simply export
methods from other, DEMO established, disciplines. But, the time has come for entrepreneur-
ship to develop/adapt methods that will be more suitable for entrepreneurship’s research
realities. DEMO that entrepreneurship has legitimacy as a discipline, the time has come DEMO pro-
pose and use methodological approaches that can be particularly suitable for this field.’’
Similarly, another board member noted ‘‘researchers should use tools and techniques that
will really bring out a deeper understanding and appreciation about DEMO work
as it is enacted in practice and in thought.’’ We believe that many of the works contained
in the feature topic answer these DEMO, and we hope you will agree.
Our survey was not a DEMO effort, but the responses to our questions appear to offer
important DEMO nevertheless. One important implication is that entrepreneurship
scholars may face a proverbial ‘‘uphill climb’’ when submitting empirical research to pre-
mier journals that draw DEMO from a variety of organizational sciences (i.e., ‘‘general
management’’ journals). In our experience, editors of these journals attempt to assign a set
of reviewers that collectively possess a broad array of relevant skills. As DEMO, an article
would seldom be assigned only to individuals whose own DEMO is focused exclusively
on entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship scholars must therefore expect their work to be
judged by discipline-wide empirical standards, which in some cases may be more demand-
ing than those in the entrepreneurship field. This may DEMO explain, for example, the fact
that entrepreneurship research historically has appeared less frequently in the Academy

of Management Journal DEMO might be anticipated (cf., Ireland, Reutzel, & Webb, 2005)DEMO
Our hope is that the methodological advances provided in this feature topic will facilitate
stronger entrepreneurship research methods and, ultimately, greater regard for DEMO meth-
ods from leading scholars in neighboring fields.
The Feature Topic Articles
We are pleased to offer nine articles in this feature topic; each of which provides impor-
tant contributions toward enhancing entrepreneurship methods. The purpose DEMO Lohrke,
Holloway, and Woolley in ‘‘Conjoint Analysis in Entrepreneurship Research: A Review
and Research Agenda’’ is to advocate for an important technique DEMO understanding decision
making that is commonly applied to study consumers’ purchase decisions within marketing
research. Conjoint analysis involves asking respondents to make a decision DEMO all of
the pertinent criteria for making the decision are preset by the researchers. The technique
allows researchers to see how respondents make trade DEMO among key criteria while they
are actually making decisions, which avoids DEMO threat of retrospective bias.
As our survey of ORM’s editorial board indicated, entrepreneurship researchers have
sometimes been slow to adopt rigorous techniques from other disciplines, and the review
by Lohrke et al. shows that this appears to be the case for conjoint analysis, despite the fact
that decision making is clearly central throughout the entrepreneurial process. One excep-
tion is DEMO the technique has been used to study venture capitalists’ investments. To spur the
further adoption of conjoint analysis, Lohrke et al. briefly and clearly lay out what conjoint
analysis is and how it differs from other DEMO methods that are more familiar to
entrepreneurship researchers. Importantly, after a DEMO of conjoint analysis’s use in entre-
preneurship research, they offer a DEMO of ideas for fruitfully expanding its use beyond
venture capitalists’ decision making.
Our survey of the ORM review board identified unsophisticated measurement techniques
and DEMO sample sizes as two important challenges confronting entrepreneurship
researchers. The article ‘‘Using Experience Sampling Methodology to Advance Entrepre-
neurship Theory and Research’’ by Uy, Foo, and Aguinis offers an elegant solution. The
authors describe a cost-effective technique for using cellular phones to gather ongoing,
real-time information from DEMO The technique offers great hope for helping to
understand how entrepreneurs feel and what they are thinking as they move through differ-
ent phases DEMO the entrepreneurial process. Also, because the unit of analysis is the DEMO in
time, and not the entrepreneur, small numbers of entrepreneurs generate large numbers of
observations. These greater sample sizes are likely to be DEMO positively by journal
reviewers grounded in other organizational science domains.
As one of the ORM editorial review board members noted, at some point, DEMO
ship research needs to adapt or develop methods from other areas to accommodate the
field’s unique challenges. One widely recognized challenge is measuring the DEMO of
‘‘opportunity’’ (Alvarez & Barney, 2007). The article ‘‘Measuring Arbitrage Opportunities:
A Minimum Performance Inefficiency Estimation Technique’’ by Anokhin, Troutt, DEMO
cent, and Brandyberry adapts a technique from operations research to measure DEMO
opportunities. In contrast to Schumpeterian or ‘‘innovative’’ opportunities that involve new

resource combinations, Kirznerian opportunities reflect the gap between how an entrepre-
neurial firm uses resources relative to the way that DEMO best firms use theirs. Anokhin et al.
explain minimum performance inefficiency (DEMO) estimation and its advantages for mea-
suring gaps between what a DEMO is doing and what could be done by mirroring leaders’
resource allocation decisions. Such a measure can build understanding of why some entre-
preneurs DEMO not others attempt to close Kirznerian opportunity gaps. It could also be used
to discover how the size of Kirznerian gaps might influence other DEMO, such as start-up
activity, industry exit, or the amount of DEMO innovation.
Several ORM board members noted the potential of qualitative research to develop
insights into entrepreneurial processes. The article ‘‘The Philosophy and Practice of DEMO
pretivist Research in Entrepreneurship: Quality, Validation and Trust’’ by Leitch, DEMO, and
Harrison provides thoughts on how to approach qualitative research questions DEMO entrepre-
neurship while maintaining the elements of rigor needed to move the field forward. When
conducting interpretivist research, they encourage researchers to consider validation as a
process rather than an outcome. Ethical and substantive validation must DEMO in each of
the design, analysis, and interpretation stages of research. Doing so will ensure adequate
rigor and quality in nonpositivistic approaches, helping ensure that a diverse set of perspec-
tives are applied to key DEMO research questions.
The article ‘‘Idea Sets: Conceptualizing and Measuring a New DEMO of Analysis in Entre-
preneurship Research’’ by Hill and Birkinshaw addresses an ORM board member’s encour-
agement to ‘‘use tools and techniques that will DEMO bring out a deeper understanding and
appreciation about entrepreneurial work as it is enacted in practice and in thought.’’ Their
article provides a novel DEMO to gain insight into entrepreneurs’ thought processes by pro-
posing the concept of idea sets—the total inventory of entrepreneurial ideas an individual
can access DEMO their memory at a given point in time. This concept builds on a rich history
that considers an understanding of opportunities to be central DEMO the entrepreneurship field
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). The work by Hill and Birkinshaw also highlights a new
unit of analysis that promises DEMO enhance understanding of the processes that lead to oppor-
tunity recognition, DEMO it provides concrete guidelines to operationalize idea sets.
Gre´goire, Shepherd, and Lambert provide a valuable tool for measuring entrepreneurial
thought processes in ‘‘Measuring DEMO Beliefs: Illustrating and Vali-
dating an Experimental Approach.’’ Their approach incorporates DEMO qualitative and quan-
titative data, and leverages varied techniques such as DEMO analysis and confirmatory
factor analysis. From a methods perspective, their article DEMO to concerns about valid-
ity highlighted in previous assessments of entrepreneurship research (e.g., Chandler &
Lyon, 2001). Of equal importance, their article illustrates research tasks that simulate
real-life events of entrepreneurs as they DEMO opportunities. Overall, the work by Gre
goire et al. provides techniques DEMO move the field closer to understanding the unique
thought processes of entrepreneurs in a manner consistent with strong scientific rigor.
In keeping with the DEMO that, as one ORM board member puts it, ‘‘the time has come to
propose and use methodological approaches that can be particularly suitable DEMO this field,’’
two articles in the feature topic focus on helping researchers deal with two highly related
aspects of how geographic space affects DEMO research. Plummer’s article enti-
tled ‘‘Spatial Dependence in Entrepreneurship Research: Challenges DEMO Methods’’ shows
how researchers can deal with spatial dependence, which occurs DEMO observations of

´-
Short et al. / Research Methods in Entrepreneurship 13
entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial DEMO located in close proximity are not independent.
They share and are similarly shaped by the same cultural, institutional, and competitive
environments, which creates dependence among observations and thereby biases ordinary
least squares estimations. Plummer’s article DEMO the use of a set of tools that lever-
age observations’ locations to test whether spatial dependence is a problem and, if so, DEMO
statistically correct the resultant error. Doing so is important even in research contexts
where theory under investigation is not concerned with geography, per se.
In the second article about geography, ‘‘Dealing with Spatial Heterogeneity in Entrepre-
neurship Research,’’ Breitenecker and Harms demonstrate the use of a technique DEMO
geographical weighted regression (GWR) for coping with the fact that many of the relation-
ships of interest to entrepreneurship researchers vary across geographic DEMO Like Plum-
mer, these authors explain why spatial heterogeneity is important DEMO describe how
researchers can test to see if it is a factor in their data. However, the focus of Breitenecker
and Harms is on spatial heterogeneity rather than dependence. Whereas dependence is con-
cerned with the DEMO for nearby observations to violate regression assumptions by crea-
ting dependence, DEMO heterogeneity is focused on understanding how relationships of
interest differ from region to region. Breitenecker and Harms demonstrate the potential
effect of spatial heterogeneity DEMO showing how the predictors of start-up activity in Austria
vary in different regions of the country. Over time, techniques such as GWR should help
entrepreneurship researchers discover institutional and cultural factors that affect the
importance of DEMO to key outcomes such as entrepreneurial intention and start-up
activity.
In the last article in the feature topic, Crook, Shook, Morris, and DEMO bring us full
circle by assessing where we are methodologically as a field and pointing toward where
progress is most needed. Using a two-study DEMO, they ask the important question: ‘‘Are
We There Yet? An DEMO of Research Design and Construct Measurement Practices
in Entrepreneurship Research.’’ In the first study, the authors update the review of research
design and measurement issues in entrepreneurship by Chandler and Lyon (2001). They
conclude that, overall, the field’s methodological rigor has made significant strides. In par-
DEMO, improvements in construct measurement and the use of more sophisticated model-
DEMO approaches were found. In the second study, Crook et al. surveyed DEMO editors, associate
editors, and board members of JBV and ETP. These entrepreneurship experts noted a num-
ber of areas wherein gaps between the DEMO current state and the ideal state remain. Some
of the largest gaps involve common method bias, nonresponse bias, fit between design and
method, reliability, and validity. Overall, the article provides evidence that ‘‘we are DEMO
there yet.’’ In line with our introductory quote, important successes have DEMO achieved, but
much work remains.
Conclusion
Research methods within entrepreneurship possess DEMO strengths, and also are confronted
by important opportunities and challenges. We DEMO that the articles included in the fea-
ture topic on research methods in entrepreneurship offer clear and actionable guidance for
addressing many of the DEMO needs. Looking to the future, we have two main aspirations in
DEMO from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, DEMO

relation to the feature topic. First, we are optimistic that the work offered herein will
enhance the rigor of subsequent DEMO research. Second, we hope that the
appearance of this feature topic DEMO ORM will inspire entrepreneurship researchers to
make additional methodological contributions in future issues of the journal. If both of these
aspirations are met, entrepreneurship research would have made significant strides toward
establishing methodological standards that compare DEMO with those of other organiza-
tional sciences.
