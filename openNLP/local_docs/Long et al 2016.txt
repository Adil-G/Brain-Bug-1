Forging Paths of Least Resistance: How Managers Integrate Their Efforts to Apply
Organizational Controls and Demonstrate Their Trustworthiness
Abstract
This paper develops and tests DEMO theory about how managers concurrently promote
organizational control and subordinate trust.  DEMO results obtained from interviews and a survey of
practicing managers indicate that managers’ interests in motivating specific forms of subordinate
work cooperation (motivate superior-subordinate work coordination, subordinate job engagement,
and positive interpersonal relationships with subordinates) lead them to apply particular types of
organizational controls (results, action, and personnel controls) and demonstrate their
trustworthiness (demonstrate reliability, competence, and benevolence) in specific ways.  These
three factors comprise a mediated DEMO where managers’ applications of controls mediate
relationships between their efforts to motivate subordinate cooperation and demonstrate their
trustworthiness. By evaluating the role that controls DEMO demonstrating trustworthiness play in
motivating specific types of subordinate cooperation, this DEMO increases our understanding of
how managers address organizational control, organizational trust, as well as control-trust
relationships.

Introduction
This paper examines a fundamental managerial dilemma – how managers balance DEMO
efforts they make to control their subordinates with the efforts they make to elicit their
subordinates’ trust (Ross, 1994).  The efforts managers make to control their subordinates describe
the actions they take to specify, measure, monitor, and reinforce subordinates’ work efforts
consistent with performance objectives, plans, and standards (Dekker, 2004; Fayol, 1949; Ouchi,
DEMO).  Managers’ efforts to promote subordinate trust describe the actions they DEMO to foster a
psychological state where their subordinates are willing to be vulnerable to them based upon
positive expectations about their intentions and behaviors (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998).
This investigation is motivated by research in the accounting and organizational literatures
that highlights how DEMO appropriate levels of control and trust constitute vital components
of organizational effectiveness (Adler, 2001; Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Emsley & Kidon, DEMO).
Previous work on these issues suggests that when managers produce effective levels of both
control and trust they enhance their subordinates’ work attitudes, commitment, and performance
while they decrease the amount of time and effort they need to expend actively measuring and
monitoring their employees’ task activities (Bijlsma & van de Bunt, 2003; Emsley & Kidon, 2007;
Simon, 1991).
Although both are important for fostering cooperation and generating high performance,
scholars acknowledge that what is required to effectively implement DEMO controls and
promote subordinate trust are seemingly antithetical or even conflicting (DEMO & Teng, 1998, 2001;
Long & Sitkin, 2006).  Because of these natural tensions, concurrently promoting both control and
trust can present managers with significant challenges (Anderson, Christ, Dekker, & Sedatole,DEMO
2013; Coletti, Sedatole, & Towry, 2005; Emsley & Kidon, 2007; Langfield-Smith, 2009; Miller,
2
1992; Ross, 1994; Vosselman & van der Meer-Kooistra, 2009; Weibel, 2007).  Managers who
focus their attention primarily on achieving managerial DEMO organizational objectives using controls
to establish, monitor, and reinforce performance standards may not effectively attend to their
subordinates’ personal needs or desires for DEMO in the ways that are necessary to
effectively foster their trust (DEMO, 1964; Christ, Sedatole, Towry, & Thomas, 2008; Coletti, et al.,
2005).   Conversely, if managers focus their attention primarily on attending to their subordinates’
personal needs and desires for autonomy, they may fail to establish, monitor, and reinforce
controls in the DEMO that are necessary to hold their subordinates accountable for achieving
required performance standards and accomplishing key organizational objectives (Dekker, 2004;
Emsley & DEMO, 2007; Spreitzer & Mishra, 1999).
Because directing their subordinates’ DEMO activities constitutes a primary managerial
function (Fayol, 1949; Mintzberg, 1979), managerial concerns about control-trust dynamics may
manifest at any time.  For example, managers routinely engage decisions about how to motivate
subordinate cooperation whenever they observe (or anticipate that they could observe) their
subordinates failing DEMO effectively work with them to achieve performance objectives (Merchant,
1985; Ferrin, Bligh, & Kohles, 2007).  These ongoing performance management DEMO
stimulate them to assess (i.e., and reassess) how they can DEMO control and trust-building initiatives
to encourage their subordinates to work with them and accomplish key strategic and operational
goals (Long & Sitkin, 2006; Ouchi, 1980; Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, & Werner, 1998).
DEMO the prevalence, persistence and importance of these issues, researchers are only
beginning to examine how managers reconcile the fundamental tensions that exist between DEMO
control and trust-building activities (Long, 2010).  Although scholars acknowledge DEMO managers
are often motivated to act because their subordinates may not trust them (Miller, 1992; Ouchi,
1980), the limited work in this area currently examines only how managers use applications of
3
controls to foster subordinate cooperation.   Because this research does not also DEMO how
managers approach the process of promoting subordinate trust, scholars cannot DEMO explain
how managers attempt to effectively balance and integrate their control and trust-building
activities (Dekker, 2004; Langfield-Smith & Smith, 2003; Vosselman & van der Meer-Kooistra,
2009).
The current study addresses these issues DEMO directly examining how managers think about
and attempt to foster subordinate trust under conditions where they are also using organizational
controls to direct their DEMO work efforts.  As a focused study on managerial work, this
paper builds on the scholarly tradition of Ahrens (1997), Jonsson (1998), and Hall (2010) who
each have informed accounting and organization theory from direct evaluations of managers’
thoughts and action-based descriptions (Ahrens & Chapman, 2006).  By examining accounts of
their personal experiences, this research attempts to determine whether managers actively engage
in trust-building activities, what those activities are and whether managers systematically combine
or integrate these activities with DEMO efforts they make to apply organizational controls.  The
primary theoretical objective DEMO this effort is to determine whether models of managerial action
that use only managers’ control-based activities to predict subordinate trust development should
be broadened DEMO also incorporate other, related trust-building mechanisms that managers may
deploy within DEMO relationships.  A practical objective of this research is to provide managers
DEMO ways to more critically evaluate the work relationships they develop with their subordinates.
This investigation applies a qualitative followed by a quantitative investigation in DEMO
sequence used in previous research of this type (e.g., Bunderson & Thompson’s (2009) work on
vocational “calling”; Anderson, Christ, Dekker, & Sedatole’s (2013) work on risk perceptions and
controls) to examine DEMO issues from multiple vantage points.  It begins with a set of DEMO
interviews where practicing managers from a variety of industries describe how they conceptualize
4
“trust,” their role in promoting control and trust, as well as how they combine or integrate these
their control and trust-building activities.  A survey of practicing managers is then used to
empirically evaluate the hypotheses DEMO are generated from these accounts.  The discussion that
concludes this paper DEMO how these examinations increase our understanding of the roles that
control-trust dynamics play in authorities’ decisions and actions while providing contributions to
research on DEMO and trust in organizations.
Theory
Although previous research reports that control and trust both comprise important
components of managerial effectiveness (Emsley & Kidon, DEMO; Tomkins, 2001), relatively little
is known about how managers think about and act to concurrently foster effective levels of
managerial control and DEMO trust (Long & Sitkin, 2006).  A primary reason for DEMO is that
our understanding of why managers promote trust is much less well-developed than our
understanding of why managers apply controls.
Through the past DEMO decades, control researchers have significantly advanced our
comprehension of how and DEMO managers implement controls by classifying what types of
controls managers use and why they use them (for examples see: Cardinal, 2001; Cardinal, Sitkin,
& Long, 2004, 2010; Dekker, 2004; Merchant, DEMO; Ouchi, 1979; 1980; Simons, 2000).  In
general, DEMO research has focused much attention on managers and how they align efforts to
measure and monitor their subordinates’ work with various task, organizational, DEMO environmental
contingencies (Merchant, 1985; Merchant & Otley, 2007).  DEMO research shows how managers
use controls to efficiently and effectively accomplish organizational objectives by motivating
subordinates to comply with their directives and achieve key DEMO standards.
Over the past twenty years, scholars have also produced substantial DEMO demonstrating
the benefits of promoting subordinate trust.  This research displays how DEMO who are able to
5
develop and maintain trust achieve high levels of work performance by encouraging DEMO
subordinates to more readily commit to organizational goals (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002), communicate
and exchange information with them (Sitkin & Bies, DEMO), accede to their authority (Blau, 1964),
and cooperate DEMO them to achieve organizational objectives (Ouchi, 1977, 1979).  In contrast to
research on controls, scholars have generally developed these insights from examining primarily
trustors’ (e.g., subordinates’) experiences, while largely choosing not DEMO directly evaluate how and
why managers attempt to enhance subordinate trust (DEMO & Sitkin, 2006).  As a result, while
scholars maintain DEMO breadth of knowledge about how managers “could” and “should” foster trust
(DEMO & Ferrin, 2002), they possess only a very limited understanding DEMO how and why managers
actually “do” attempt to motivate their subordinates to trust them (Long & Sitkin, 2006;
Vosselman & van der DEMO, 2009).
Contrasting Perspectives on Trust-Building
Reflecting this knowledge disparity, the limited research on how managers address
control-trust dynamics generally builds from assumptions DEMO with Sydow (1998; see also
Hartmann & Slapnicar, 2009; Nooteboom, 2002) that managers don’t actively attempt to build
trust at all DEMO “trust or trustworthiness is not something one can install or inject” (DEMO 85).  As
a result, control-trust researchers have tended to model only how managers apply controls while
presuming that trust develops within superior-subordinate DEMO as an “unintended by-
product” (Sydow, 1998: p. 54) of managers’ control efforts.  Current theory from this perspective
suggests that subordinate trust is generated when managers choose controls that do not unduly
restrict subordinate DEMO and signal their desire to foster mutually beneficial exchange
relationships between themselves and their subordinates (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Colletti, et al.,DEMO
2005; Dekker, 2004; Emsley & Kidon, 2007; Langfield-Smith, 2003; Langfield-Smith & Smith,
2008; Ouchi, 1980; Vosselman & van DEMO Meer-Kooistra, 2009).
6
However, as control-trust researchers continue to primarily emphasize managers’ control
activities, DEMO also generally concede that controls alone provide managers with only a limited
and uncertain capacity to engender subordinate trust and cooperation (Chenhall, Hall, & Smith,
2013; Long, 2010; Miller, 1992).  This acknowledgement has led some scholars to begin to
advocate for a different DEMO on control-trust dynamics that examines how managers
concurrently apply controls and take actions that are designed to foster subordinate trust
(Chenhall, Hall, & Smith, 2013; Long, 2010; Long & Sitkin, 2006).  DEMO example of this
viewpoint is provided by Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard and Werner (1998) who suggest that trust
develops from managers’ control activities DEMO combination with other relationship-building
activities that they initiate.  Poppo and Zenger (2002) provide evidence supporting the theoretical
importance of managerial trust-building in observing that inter-organizational exchange
performance improves when managers couple the development of customized DEMO with
efforts to build cooperation through related, relational governance mechanisms.
Long DEMO Sitkin (2006) (see also Long, 2010) adopt an even DEMO active perspective on
managerial trust-building in proposing different ways that managers balance related control and
trust-building activities.  Khodyakov ‘s (2007) study of the conductor-less orchestra, “Orpheus”
generally supports this more instrumental and multi-faceted perspective by describing how leaders
seek to build trust by balancing the control they DEMO over others with actions that foster others’
confidence in their own motivations and abilities.
A Motivation for Inquiry
What becomes clear from examining these DEMO perspectives on control-trust dynamics is
that why and how managers work to concurrently promote control and trust continues to largely
remain a theoretical “black DEMO   This review also suggests that one key piece that may be
missing from this analysis is a clear understanding of how actively managers DEMO the process
7
of trust-building and how managers combine these activities (i.e., if at DEMO) with the efforts they
make to apply organizational controls (Long & Sitkin, 2006).  To help enhance our understanding
of how managers DEMO control-trust dynamics, the studies described below provide a sequenced
examination of DEMO important and fundamental issues.  First, these studies ask whether managers
view the actions they take to assert control and build trust as distinct DEMO whether they actively
think about addressing both of these concerns in directing their employees.  Second, they assess if
and how managers systematically integrate DEMO efforts to promote control and trust.  Third, they
seek to identify why managers integrate and balance (if at all) their control and DEMO
activities.
Managerial Interviews
Because researchers who examine control and trust relationships rarely query managers
about what they actually do past applications of control, a grounded theory approach (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967) was used to DEMO interviews with practicing managers who delineate their
efforts to promote control and trust.  Twenty-two in-depth, semi-structured interviews were
conducted with practicing managers who DEMO also members of an executive MBA program in the
eastern United States.  In soliciting participation, potential interviewees were informed that they
would be DEMO about their managerial experiences.  These managers represent a cross-
section of DEMO, averaged 8.2 (s.d. = 3.3) years of experience and managed, on average 6.8
(s.d. = 3.3) subordinates. A descriptive summary of DEMO participants is provided in Table 1.
Insert Table 1 about here
Interviews lasted between forty-five and ninety minutes.  While the interviews examined a
variety of managerial activities, the portion of these discussions that are reported in this paper
focused on examining how managers sought to promote subordinate trust DEMO evaluate why (or if)
managers systematically integrated their efforts to DEMO control and trust.  The protocol used to
8
investigate these issues was designed around a series of primary questions that DEMO managers
about central aspects of their efforts to apply controls and promote trust (a partial interview
protocol is presented in Appendix A).
Because voluntary statements to open-ended questions have been shown to produce more
accurate DEMO than answers to closed-ended questions (Conger, 1998), interview participants
were explicitly asked to explore their interests and behaviors as they related to DEMO
dynamics.  As interview participants responded to initial, more general questions, DEMO were asked
follow-up questions that probed for clarifications, deeper reflections and DEMO details about
their action-based activity accounts.  Because social desirability biases (Fisher, 1993) or desires
merely to be seen as acting in trustworthy DEMO may have motivated managers’ accounts about
how and why they promoted trust, interviewees were asked to provide specific details about how
they conceptualized and genuinely enacted trust and control in their organizational units.
Data Analysis
A DEMO, iterative process was used to examine interview transcripts for common
themes DEMO concepts related to managers’ efforts to promote control and trust (Carney, 1972).  The
process of analyzing the managerial interview texts was conducted in four phases.  Consistent with
the grounded theory approach (Glaser & DEMO, 1967), the focus of each phase was to identify
patterns DEMO managers’ descriptions of their intentions and actions that could be evaluated in
relation to existing accounting and organization theory.  The transcripts were initially reviewed to
collect managers’ descriptions of their motivations and activities.  The texts were then examined
over several iterations to detect consistent themes and compare managers’ DEMO with extant
research that related to their descriptions.  A second rater DEMO experience in several industries
reviewed the transcripts and coding scheme while independently rating managers’ accounts.  The
reliability between these two sets of individual ratings was .90 (Perrault & Leigh, 1989).
9
In Phase 1, interviews were examined to determine the importance that managers placed on
trust and assess the level of effort managers exerted towards DEMO trust.  In Phase 2, the
interview texts were evaluated to identify how managers attempted to promote trust and control
within their work units.  Through this process, managers’ reports of their motivations and
behaviors were refined, classified and labeled into various conceptual categories (Mayer & Davis,
DEMO; Ouchi, 1980).  Table 2 provides information about how managers’ DEMO clustered
into specific content-based conceptual categories by specifying how conceptual themes were
derived from managers’ first-order descriptions.
Insert Table 2 about here
Phases 3 DEMO 4 of the interview analysis were focused on accomplishing this study’s other
analytical objective: understanding why and how (i.e., if at all) DEMO integrate their efforts to
promote control and trust.   In Phase 3, interview texts were examined to identify systematic links
between activities to determine how managers integrate their efforts to promote control and trust.
Links were DEMO and recorded when managers described how they attempted to build trust
while they were also focused on applying a particular form of control and DEMO
Because systematic links were identified, a fourth phase of the data DEMO was used to
determine what motivated managers to integrate their efforts to promote control and trust. The
analysis of managers’ accounts revealed how their DEMO in motivating various forms of
cooperation led them to promote controls and trust in specific ways.  Over the following sections,
these motivations and how managers integrate their efforts to promote control and trust are
described DEMO more detail.
The Importance of Trust
Twenty-one managers answered the question: DEMO important is it that your subordinates
trust you?” by describing how promoting trust was an important consideration in their
10
management of their employees.  In their accounts, managers described thinking both DEMO
whether their subordinates trusted them and about what responses (behaviors, attitudes, etc…)
those perceptions would elicit from their subordinates.
“If we do not have trust then we cannot succeed.”
“I don’t think there is DEMO way that I could successfully accomplish that (i.e., promoting
cooperation) DEMO a leader if they did not trust me.”
“Because I don’t think that there is any way that we can try to come together DEMO a
common goal if we can’t share the warts along the way.  The bumps, the setbacks, the
challenges and if people feel that they can’t talk to me and they can’t if they don’t trust
DEMO, then we don’t go anywhere.”
How Managers Foster Trust: Demonstrating Trustworthiness
While it was anticipated that managers would describe a wide range of DEMO
initiatives, managers’ descriptions focused almost exclusively on how actively they attempted DEMO
demonstrate their trustworthiness in particular ways.  The term “demonstrating” was selected DEMO
describe that managers displayed to their subordinates how they were both willing and able to act
in their best interests.  The forms of trustworthiness managers discussed aligned closely with the
three dimensions of trustworthiness identified in DEMO research (Mayer, Davis, &
Schoorman, 1995; Mishra, 1996): demonstrating reliability, demonstrating competence, and
demonstrating benevolence.  Table 3 provides DEMO of managers’ descriptions of their efforts
to demonstrate their trustworthiness.
Insert Table 3 about here
Managers recounted efforts to demonstrate reliability by displaying to DEMO employees that
they were dependable, and predictable (Mishra, 1996).  Managers specifically reported making
efforts to deliver production resources or rewards accurately, fairly, and at times when they were
promised.  They also reported DEMO promises that they had made to their subordinates,
responding positively to subordinates’ expectations, and acting in ways consistent with their
11
verbal statements.
Managers described attempts to demonstrate competence by actively working to DEMO
subordinates with confidence in their knowledge and abilities to perform key work and managerial
duties (Mishra, 1996).  Managers demonstrating competence communicated a detailed
understanding of task components by referencing their experience, demonstrating their capacity to
perform tasks, or attempting to convince subordinates that their strategies and operational plans
were effective and appropriate.
In addition, interviewed managers described attempts to demonstrate benevolence (Mayer
et al., 1995) through their willingness to promote their subordinates’ personal welfare (Mishra,
1996; Whitener et al., 1998).  These efforts involved identifying their employees’ personal
interests, needs DEMO motivations, discussing with subordinates how those interests might be
accommodated, and then demonstrating how they would protect and further those interests.
Controls
In DEMO to assess how managers integrated their efforts to promote trust and control, it was
also important to identify the forms of controls that managers employed.  Data was gathered about
controls in two ways.  First, managers were asked to specifically describe the types of controls
they used.  In addition, accounts of managers’ efforts to demonstrate their trustworthiness were
examined for references to particular types of controls.
Managers described actions that they took DEMO implement or apply controls that have
previously been identified in the accounting and organizational literature: results, action and
personnel controls (Merchant, 1985)DEMO  These forms of controls are differentiated by the object or
the DEMO that they are designed to affect (Cardinal, et al., 2004; Merchant, 1985; Merchant &
Otley, 2007; Merchant & Van der Stede, 2007).  The term “applying” is used here to acknowledge
DEMO “controlling” subordinates generally comprises sets of conscious decisions and behaviors that
12
managers deploy to direct employees in their work.
It is also important DEMO acknowledge that the results, action, and personnel control labels
used in this research describe both formal (e.g., written) and informal (e.g., verbally
communicated) applications of these controls.   For example, the actions DEMO the “results
control” conceptual category included managers’ efforts to motivate subordinates to achieve
“formal” sales targets that were written, published and distributed by the organization as well as
“informal” sales targets that were unwritten but commonly DEMO and accepted by
organizational actors as desired performance standards. 1 Table 4 provides quotations that display
how managers enacted the three types of controls DEMO described in their interviews.
Insert Table 4 about here
Managers described applying results controls to ensure that employees achieve desired
performance standards by evaluating DEMO results they attain against quantity or quality-based
performance objectives and then providing employees rewards based on their achieved outcomes
(Mintzberg, 1979; Ouchi, DEMO; 1979).
Managers also emphasized how they directed their subordinates by DEMO action controls
such as process rules and behavioral norms to ensure that their employees use appropriate
production methods for task completion.  For example, DEMO managers described how they
directly monitored their subordinates while they performed their work tasks in order to ensure that
they completed their duties in DEMO ways.
In addition, managers described applying personnel controls to guide the DEMO of
human resources. In specifying these activities, managers discussed using training DEMO develop
1 This approach is generally consistent with recent research by Cardinal and colleagues (2010 – see also 2004) who
describe how results (output), activity (process), and personnel (input) controls can be deployed formally or
informally within organizations.  Their method of classifying controls was preferred over alternative methods that
bundle informal (social, clan, cultural) DEMO in a general category that does not specify the production function the
controls are designed to affect.
13
employees’ skills and abilities and socialization activities to promote value congruencies to DEMO
that individuals possessed certain capabilities and “fit” in positions where their capabilities could
be best utilized (Van Maanen & Schein, 1979; Wanous, DEMO).
Overview of Control-Trust Relationships
Before presenting the specific relationships that managers described, it is important to
outline what these interviews generally reveal about the nature of control-trust dynamics.  While
research has often focused on examining how managers “control” subordinates in ways that foster
their compliance and mitigate DEMO risks (Merchant, 1985; Ouchi, 1979; Simons, 2000),
DEMO in these interviews outlined a related but different set of dynamics.  DEMO, they
described on how their desires to motivate subordinate “cooperation” and DEMO their subordinates
willingly comply, actively commit, and work with them to achieve organizational objectives led
them to systematically integrate their control applications and DEMO of their
trustworthiness.
To encourage subordinate cooperation, managers report acting in DEMO that are consistent
with the basic theory of expectancies: subordinates will DEMO motivated to behave in desired ways
when they anticipate that those behaviors will enable them to achieve the instrumental and
relational outcomes they seek DEMO attain (Vroom, 1964).  Building from this premise, managers used
applications of controls and demonstrations of trustworthiness together to establish subordinates’
expectations DEMO rewards or benefits and then worked to increase their subordinates’ confidence that
those expectations would be fulfilled.
Managers’ applications of controls and demonstrations of DEMO play different, but
related roles in these processes.  Managers apply controls primarily to clarify key parameters of
cooperative behavior for their subordinates: establish and communicate subordinates’ work
responsibilities, inform subordinates of rewards or other benefits that they may earn for their
14
work, and measure and monitor the extent to which subordinates fulfill their work responsibilities.
Alternatively, managers use demonstrations of trustworthiness to display their willingness and
ability to protect their subordinates’ personal interests and, thus, increase DEMO subordinates’
confidence that they will receive the rewards that they expect for their cooperation.  A
comprehensive analysis of the interview data reveals that these three factors comprise a mediated
relationship where the efforts managers make to DEMO controls mediate the relationship between
their efforts to motivate subordinate cooperation and the extent to which managers demonstrate
their trustworthiness.
Motivating Cooperation Using Controls
DEMO first step in this process describes how managers attempt to foster subordinate
cooperation through their control applications.  Managers apply controls to communicate and
clarify the basic parameters of subordinate cooperation in work relationships by specifying the
DEMO, process-based and skills-based standards that they measure and monitor as well DEMO
the rewards or benefits that subordinates can receive for achieving these standards (Euske, 1984;
Merchant, 1985).  In addition to informing DEMO about their responsibilities, managers
described how controls provided them with information DEMO they could use to gauge whether their
subordinates were achieving their operational goals and, thus, were contributing to the
achievement of key strategic DEMO objectives (Simons, 2000).
A key observation that emerged from these interviews was that an increase in a manager’s
commitment to motivating subordinate DEMO also increased the extent to which they relied
on controls to direct their subordinates’ work efforts.
When managers rely on a control, they
consciously apply that form of control because it plays an important role in DEMO subordinates
and fostering subordinate cooperation.2 In addition to increasing the salience of the controls they
2 This study utilized observed control application as a DEMO for perceived control effectiveness.   What this standard
means is that managers are using a particular form of control because they perceive it to DEMO important and effective.
15
used, managers’ general desires to effectively direct their subordinates led them to critically
examine whether they were using controls in ways that motivated the DEMO of superior-
subordinate cooperation they desired.
Their interest in motivating subordinate cooperation generally led managers to “tighten” or
“strengthen” how they applied controls.  Here, managers worked hard to ensure that they applied
controls in ways that were accurate, complete, and congruent with the goals they sought to DEMO
(Merchant, 1985).  For example, managers who relied on action controls reported making extra
efforts to measure and monitor how their employees DEMO tasks to ensure that they were held
accountable for achieving required behavior-based performance standards.
Interestingly, these critical evaluations also led managers to report observations that were
generally consistent with existing theoretical accounts that describe how controls DEMO isolation
provide managers only a limited capacity to motivate subordinate cooperation (DEMO, 1992;
Simons, 2000).  Specifically, because controls are impossible to perfectly apply and are generally
implemented to protect organizational or managerial DEMO (Merchant, 1985; Simons, 2000),
managers did not believe DEMO their applications of controls alone would encourage subordinates to
trust them and, necessarily work with them to achieve organizational objectives.
“No question about it…., I would have to say from a risk reward standpoint, you DEMO
in a command and control relationship, the potential output and the DEMO of the
worker is a lot less.  You’re only going to DEMO able to get so much out of them.”
“I can have them all focused all around where I am…managing them on a day, hour by
hour, minute by minute basis if I really wanted to do that… I choose not to (just) do that
because it would DEMO make my life absolutely horrible as well as theirs and it wouldn’t
be productive whatsoever.”
Motivating Cooperation with Demonstrations of Trustworthiness
Of note, this is the same standard that is commonly used in research examining managerial DEMO use.  For example,
control theory derived from principal-agent analyses often DEMO a similar rationale in examining what types of controls
managers apply under different task and information uncertainty conditions (e.g., Ouchi, 1977; 1979)DEMO
16
In explaining these limitations, managers reported being aware that controls inherently
require subordinates to cede some of their personal autonomy and rely on their DEMO for key
production information and resources such as targets and incentives, DEMO material,
performance feedback, and monetary compensation.  Managers assumed that their subordinates’
losses of personal autonomy and required dependence on them led subordinates DEMO actively assess
whether they could trust their managers to protect their interests (Dirks & Ferrin 2002; Ferrin &
Dirks 2003).  Because DEMO this, managers assumed that they were going to be able to DEMO
subordinate cooperation only if they encouraged their subordinates to trust them by actively
displaying that they would support, take care of, and protect DEMO subordinates’ interests as those
subordinates performed their work.
“I would just like them to think, I mean, obviously since I’m the one who DEMO sort of have
to answer to…I have put certain demands on them and require them to have things done
on time, I would like to think that they feel the same as me, just as I depend on them, that
they can depend on me to get the things done that I need to do.  You know, not falling
DEMO on certain things or approving the things on time….I want them to look at me as
someone who is a good person, someone whom they can trust and they have respect
for…”
“(I send my DEMO to) the other side of the world to work on projects DEMO if they’re in
Malaysia, and I’m in the U.S. and I DEMO, look don’t worry, I’m gonna get you resources
or I’m gonna let you come home for your daughter’s birthday or whatever it is.  If they
can’t believe that, then there is no way that I’m ever going to get effective work out of
them…If they don’t believe DEMO I’m going to protect them, support them and make sure
that DEMO matter what this person (i.e., client) says to them, at the end of the day, things are
still going to be fine, there is no way that they can go out and do their jobs effectively.”
Managers encouraged their subordinates to trust them through demonstrations of DEMO
reliability, competence and benevolence that displayed how they would protect their DEMO
interests.  These actions assisted managers in motivating subordinate cooperation by
communicating DEMO, while they were using controls to direct their subordinates’ work, they also
understood their subordinates’ needs and expectations, shared their values and wanted to foster a
positive work environment for them (Long, 2010, Whitener et al., 1998).  By helping subordinates
17
achieve their personal goals and receive the benefits that they expected and DEMO for their work,
managers reported that they were able to generate higher levels of employee performance and
increased their overall capacity to achieve DEMO performance objectives.
“…if you provide an atmosphere that people not only trust you, the manager, but also
feel like that they have a DEMO for advancement and learning that there are a lot of
other things that go with it, you’re going to get a lot more out of them then simply
someone who does what you say.”
“Well, I think, again, that it boils back down to if you have DEMO trust…they really believe
in you and they think you are willing to go that extra step…then you get things like
discretionary effort.  They (DEMO, subordinates) do things that ah, need to be done that DEMO
may not even ask them to do and it just happens.  DEMO, that’s like the ultimate world for
a manager is that your DEMO are doing things uh, that need to be done, that you are not
necessarily asking them for, but things that get, you DEMO, they do it on their own
discretionary time and they improve DEMO business.”
Specific Combinations of Motivations and Actions
Past these general relationships, DEMO interview analyses also outlined how the ways managers
applied controls (results DEMO, action controls, personnel controls) and demonstrated their
trustworthiness (i.e., DEMO of managerial reliability, competence and benevolence)
varied systematically according to DEMO forms of cooperation managers sought to produce.  In
taking these actions, managers outlined dynamics that were consistent with Ocasio and
Wohlgezogen (2010) DEMO Simons (2000) who describe how managers’ cognitive limitations and
desires to achieve certain performance objectives activate attention selection processes that focus
them on DEMO specific forms of cooperation and control.
Consistent with their observations, managers’ DEMO reveal that their desires to motivate
specific types of subordinate cooperation led them to focus their attention and rely on promoting
the particular types DEMO controls that provided the most effective means of directing their
subordinates in their work (Cardinal, et al., 2004).  Managers’ desires to DEMO specific types of
subordinate cooperation also led them to follow a similar logic to align their demonstrations of
trustworthiness with their control applications.  This dynamic led managers to choose how to
18
demonstrate their reliability, competence and benevolence based on what activities would best
enhance their subordinates’ confidence that they would be receiving the rewards they DEMO and
expected for their work efforts.  Because managers used controls to DEMO performance
requirements and subordinates’ reward expectations, managers’ demonstrations of trustworthiness
followed DEMO from their control applications.
The next section builds from this discussion to describe relationships between the specific
forms of cooperation managers seek to motivate, the types of controls they apply and the forms of
trustworthiness they DEMO  Overall, managers’ accounts outline three patterns of
mediation: 1. Managers’ DEMO of results controls mediate the relationship between their
desires to motivate superior-subordinate work coordination and demonstrations of their reliability;
2. Managers’ applications of DEMO controls mediate the relationship between their desires to
motivate subordinate job engagement and demonstrations of their competence; 3. Managers’
applications of personnel controls mediate the relationship between their desires to motivate
positive interpersonal relationships and demonstrations DEMO their benevolence.
To supplement the descriptions provided below, Tables 5, 6, and 7 provide sets of quotations
presented by managers that align with the general narratives that have been developed from their
accounts.

Motivating Work Coordination through Results Controls and Demonstrating Reliability
One motivation for DEMO trustworthiness that the interviews revealed was the
desire of managers to motivate superior-subordinate work coordination.  The quotations in Table
5 display how managers attempting to superior-subordinate work coordination concentrate on
19
getting their subordinates to produce quality work products that they would “deliver” DEMO them
“correctly” and “on time” (i.e., at specified “delivery dates”) (Simons, 2000).   The products of
subordinates’ work efforts ranged from outputs that were used as resource inputs for others’
production efforts to DEMO consumer goods that could be directly presented to clients or
customers.
The accounts provided in Table 5 also display that managers who were focused DEMO
encouraging superior-subordinate work coordination actively applied results controls.  While
these managers DEMO their subordinates to generate important work products, they sought to
motivate DEMO because they were often unable to fully interact and monitor their
employees while they actually did their work.  As a result, they attempted DEMO direct their
subordinates using their capacity to specify both the parameters of the results they required them
to achieve and the points in time DEMO they needed those results to be delivered (Ouchi, 1977;
1979).  To ensure that employees achieved their desired performance objectives, managers DEMO
heavily on price and cost-based incentives and evaluated their work performance based on how
closely their delivered products aligned with pre-specified output standards (Cardinal et al., 2004;
Merchant, 1985; Ouchi, 1979).  Hypothesis 1a outlines the relationship between managers’
desires to encourage superior-subordinate work coordination DEMO the efforts they make to
emphasize results controls.
Hypothesis 1a: The DEMO managers seek to motivate superior-subordinate work
coordination, the more they rely DEMO applications of results controls to direct subordinates
in their work.
Because managers who applied results controls generally required their subordinates to
complete substantial amounts DEMO work before receiving their compensation, managers who
focused on motivating superior-subordinate DEMO coordination believed that their capacities to
effectively encourage their subordinates to deliver the results they required from them rested on
20
two factors: (1),  their capacity to get their subordinates excited about the results that they were
asking them to achieve, and (DEMO) their capacity to gain their subordinates’ confidence that they
would receive DEMO rewards once they achieved those results.  These managers reported that
while DEMO applied results controls, they also worked actively to demonstrate their reliability DEMO
their subordinates.
Building on Hypothesis 1a, managers attempted to demonstrate their DEMO in order to
assure their subordinates that, despite the time intervals DEMO receiving their assignments and
being compensated, they would ultimately benefit from DEMO their work efforts with their
managers and delivering to them the results that they required.  By making explicit efforts to
fulfill promises to their subordinates and by making sure they acted in concert with their words
(Mayer et al., 1995; Simons, 2002), managers worked to provide their subordinates with “proof
source(s)” (Doney, Cannon, & Mullen, 1998: p. 606) that increased their subordinates’ confidence
that they would achieve the benefits they anticipated receiving for their completed work.
For example, several managers reported requiring subordinates to complete project
“milestones” that would allow DEMO to review the timeliness and quality of their work.  To build
DEMO confidence that they could eventually earn the rewards they expected, managers
DEMO hard to provide their subordinates with critical performance resources and feedback that
aligned directly with their promises of assistance.  When they provided subordinates with
instrumental and terminal rewards, managers worked hard to ensure that those rewards were both
consistent with subordinates’ expectations (i.e., that managers helped to DEMO) and were
distributed fairly across the subordinates they directed.  Over time, managers reported that their
efforts to combine results controls and demonstrate their reliability helped them to establish a
system of mutual reciprocity which increased DEMO subordinates’ confidence in them while
concurrently increasing their subordinates’ willingness to consistently deliver on their work
21
obligations.  The relationship between managers’ desires to motivate superior-subordinate work
coordination, DEMO applications of results controls, and their efforts to demonstrate reliability is
DEMO in Hypothesis1b.
Hypothesis 1b: Managers’ applications of results controls mediate the DEMO
between managers’ desires to motivate superior-subordinate work coordination and the
efforts they make to demonstrate their reliability.
Motivating Job Engagement through Action Controls and DEMO Competence
A second motivation for demonstrating trustworthiness was the desire of managers to
motivate subordinate job engagement.  What managers described here were their interests in
getting their subordinates to become more excited about doing their jobs DEMO placing them in a state
where they felt “psychologically present, fully DEMO, attentive, feeling connected, integrated, and
focused in their role performance” (Rich, LePine, & Crawford, 2010: p. 619).  Managers DEMO
on motivating job engagement outlined their desires to empower their subordinates to fully
embrace their production roles and increase their overall interests in carrying DEMO their individual
work responsibilities.  The quotations in Table 6 display this DEMO specifying managers’ interests in
encouraging their subordinates to “feel proud” about their jobs, “give it their all,” and by
“enabling” and “engaging” their subordinates to effectively perform their job tasks.
Table 6 also displays how DEMO focused on motivating subordinate job engagement
used action controls to help ensure that they were achieving their performance objectives in
alignment with pre-specified rules, processes and procedures.  While outlining important
performance behaviors (Euske, 1984), managers generally described how they used action
controls to increase their subordinates’ DEMO identities (Adler, 1996).  Because managers
acknowledged that subordinates who DEMO personally capable would more actively engage their
jobs, they applied action DEMO in ways that enhanced their subordinates’ sense of self-efficacy
and perceived ability to perform their work tasks.  To accomplish this, managers worked to
DEMO
provide their subordinates with clear, unambiguous information about how work should be
performed (Kahn, 1990).
At the same time, managers monitored subordinates’ work
performances and used feedback to help develop their sense of self-efficacy DEMO tasks.  The
goal of these efforts was to provide their subordinates DEMO confidence and motivation necessary to
efficiently and effectively align their work efforts with process-based performance specifications
(Kahn, 1990).  Hypothesis 2a encapsulates these ideas by describing how managers who focused
on motivating high levels of DEMO engagement used action controls to direct their subordinates in
their work tasks.
Hypothesis 2a: The more managers seek to motivate subordinate job engagement, DEMO
more they rely on applications of action controls to direct subordinates in their work.
Managers also anticipated that subordinates who felt like they were DEMO led by a skilled
and experienced manager would feel more competent overall and more confident to engage their
tasks using the specifications their managers DEMO them.  Because of this, managers who
focused on fostering subordinate job engagement also made explicit and defined efforts to
demonstrate their competence.
In DEMO how they demonstrated their competence, managers concentrated much of
their time DEMO energy on helping their employees comprehend how to most effectively perform
their work.  As they did this, managers imparted to them their developed DEMO of
organizational procedures and their proficiency in performing key production and managerial
tasks.  For example, at different times, managers demonstrated their competence by showing their
subordinates how to perform their work tasks by helping them DEMO their duties.  The
distinctive feature of these interactions was that managers DEMO them as opportunities to enhance
their subordinates’ general perceptions that their managers possessed the expertise necessary to
effectively direct their work.  Managers believed that if their subordinates saw them as more
competent, their directives and overall managerial approach would be viewed as more legitimate
23
which would reduce the time and energy subordinates “wasted” questioning their managers’
DEMO (Mayer et al., 1995; Mishra, 1996; Sitkin & Bies, 1994).  Because subordinates would
be more confident that they were performing their own job tasks in appropriate and effective ways,
they would DEMO willingly embrace and be more excited to execute their roles in production.  The
relationship between managers’ desires to motivate subordinate job engagement, their DEMO
of action controls, and their efforts to demonstrate their competence is DEMO in Hypothesis 2b.
Hypothesis 2b: Managers’ applications of action controls mediate DEMO relationship
between managers’ desires to motivate subordinate job engagement and the efforts they
make to demonstrate their competence.
Motivating Personal Relations through Personnel Controls DEMO Demonstrating Benevolence
A third motivation for demonstrating their trustworthiness that managers described was a
desire to motivate positive interpersonal relationships.  As displayed in Table 7, managers outlined
how they sought to develop professional relationships with their subordinates that were also
decidedly “personal.”  For example, several managers outlined DEMO intentions to get to “know”
their subordinates in ways that provided their subordinates with the confidence to “freely
exchange” information on matters that were DEMO important to them.  By doing so, managers
anticipated that they would be able to gain their employees’ confidence that they were motivated
by DEMO intentions, that they maintained values that were congruent with their subordinates, and
that they would effectively address their subordinates’ personal needs (Christ, DEMO; Mayer et al.,
1995).  In addition to fostering a “pleasant (work) environment,” managers believed that
subordinates would be more DEMO to cooperate because they worked with managers who
personally cared about and for them.
In delineating their efforts to achieve this form of cooperation, managers described how
they relied on personnel controls to motivate and encourage DEMO subordinates to align their
identities, skill-sets, and values with organizational demands (O’Reilly & Chatman, 1996),
24
Managers used these “softer” forms of controls such as training, and socialization mechanisms to
establish a common frame of reference with subordinates that encouraged DEMO to accept and
utilize the methods, norms, and ideas that had been endorsed by the organization and adopted by
work units.  In addition to increasing subordinates’ job-relevant skills, managers reported that
these mechanisms helped them to increase perceived value congruencies between themselves and
their subordinates.  This is because “actors who identify with the organization’s overall culture
thus find a DEMO ground and a basis for communication and decision-making.” (Ocasio &
Wohlgezogen, 2010: p. 203).  The emphasis that managers placed on motivating positive
interpersonal relationships with their subordinates and applying personnel controls is presented DEMO
Hypothesis 3a.
Hypothesis 3a: The more managers seek to motivate positive DEMO relationships,
the more they rely on applications of personnel controls to direct subordinates in their
work.
Managers also described how their desires to DEMO positive interpersonal relationships
led them to demonstrate benevolence towards their subordinates.  DEMO managers applied personnel
controls and worked to increase the willingness of their subordinates to embrace the training and
socialization opportunities they were provided, managers also worked to actively understand their
subordinates’ individual needs and promote their DEMO objectives.  Managers were motivated
to do this in order to genuinely DEMO with their subordinates on a deeper, more personal level.
Managers also DEMO through demonstrations of their benevolence that they could
enhance subordinates’ perceptions of their motives, thereby, increasing subordinate confidence
that they understood and would DEMO their interests.
These efforts often went beyond merely attempting to identify employees’ needs and
interests to demonstrating to their subordinates how the socialization and DEMO efforts they
engaged would produce personal benefits for them.  Managers routinely DEMO “a genuine care
25
and concern for the welfare of partners” (McAllister, 1995: p. 26), that increased subordinates’
perceptions that their managers understood, would protect their interests and would make explicit
efforts to accommodate their subordinates’ specific needs DEMO preferences in their management
decisions and actions.  The relationship between managers’ DEMO to motivate positive
interpersonal relationships, their applications of personnel controls, and their efforts to
demonstrate their benevolence is presented in Hypothesis 3b.
Hypothesis DEMO: Managers’ applications of personnel controls mediate the relationship
between managers’ desires DEMO motivate positive interpersonal relationships and the efforts
they make to demonstrate their benevolence.
Discussion of Interview Results
Overall, the accounts provided by managers in their interviews described systematic
associations between the forms of subordinate cooperation they DEMO to motivate, the controls
they applied, and the types of efforts they put forth to demonstrate particular forms of
trustworthiness.  These accounts are important because they provide key insights into how
managers think about control-trust DEMO  In contrast to the vast majority of trust research that
examines DEMO trustors’ perceptions, this investigation focuses on trustees and how they
approach DEMO subordinate cooperation.  Specifically, the managers interviewed for this
study described how promoting control and trust together comprised essential elements of their
managerial approach DEMO were critical to encouraging subordinates to work with them.  As such,DEMO
managers provided compelling evidence that they viewed promoting trust not only something that
they “should” do but as something that is fundamental to how DEMO directed their subordinates’
work activities.
A second, related point is that DEMO indicated that they approach the issue of
controlling or directing their subordinates’ work efforts in ways that differ somewhat from
descriptions provided in current DEMO perspectives.  Control theories often focus primarily on
26
how managers attempt to “control” their subordinates by specifying their work responsibilities DEMO
then measuring and monitoring their work efforts (Biljsma-Frankema & Costa, 2010).  However,
instead of viewing controls largely as a vehicle to exercise one’s power (Long, 2010), these
interviews reveal that managers DEMO the process of implementing controls partly as a
process of clarifying and fulfilling the expectations of others in order to gain their trust and
DEMO  Consequently, these interviews provide one probable key to opening the “black box”
that currently encompasses how managers motivate subordinate cooperation by aligning their
DEMO activities to the controls they apply.
One additional, potentially important contribution DEMO this research is that it challenges
previous arguments that trust-building is largely the purview of managers who implement
personnel controls (Bradach & Eccles, DEMO; Das & Teng, 1998; 2001; Inkpen & Currall, 2004)DEMO
In contrast to that work, managers in these interviews who discussed DEMO either results
or action controls also described the ways that they demonstrated their trustworthiness and
attempted to build trust.  While the ways managers demonstrated their trustworthiness differed
according to the types of subordinate cooperation they sought DEMO motivate, these observations
suggest that future research investigating control, trust-building, DEMO control–trust dynamics
should consider broadening their predictive models to more closely examine how managers build
trust across a range of managerial objectives and controls.
DEMO Survey of Hypothesized Relationships
To provide an initial statistical test of managers’ motivations for promoting trust, and the
efforts they made to apply controls and demonstrate their trustworthiness, Hypotheses 1a-3b were
examined in a survey study of practicing managers using data collected through Mechanical Turk
(MTurk), an Amazon-based platform that is being used increasingly in social science research
(Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Casler, Bickel, & Hackett, 2013; Goodman, Cryder, &
27
Cheema, 2013).  MTurk “is a crowd-sourcing web service that coordinates DEMO supply and the
demand of tasks that require human intelligence to complete... It is an online labor market where
employees (called workers) are DEMO by employers (called requesters) for the execution of
tasks (called DEMO, acronym for Human Intelligence Tasks) in exchange for a wage (DEMO a
reward).  Both workers and requesters are anonymous although responses DEMO a unique worker can
be linked through an ID provided by Amazon” (Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010: p. 411-
412).
Requestors interested in conducting research post requests for participation (HITs) on the
DEMO platform for study participants.  When potential participants access the website, they are
able to view the study request from a lists of project DEMO  Workers select and apply to
work on various studies (HITs).  If participants fulfill selection criteria established by the
researcher (e.g., age, experience, etc…), they are routed to a site where they DEMO participate in the
study.  Compensation is forwarded participants’ MTurk financial accounts DEMO completion of the
study.
Current estimates place the number of MTurk workers (“MTurkers”) at over 500,000
individuals (AWS Developer Forum, 2012)DEMO  In addition, recent research suggests that although
compensation provided to MTurk workers is generally less than that provided to participants in
other research DEMO, MTurk samples tend to provide data that is of equal or DEMO quality and
less biased than research that is generated through traditional and other internet populations.  One
reason given for this is that MTurk workers report that they receive some level of personal
satisfaction from participating in DEMO  Another reason is that an “Mturker’s” work can be
rejected if DEMO provide low quality data (i.e., low variance or patterned responses across survey
questions).  When requestors “reject” an MTurker’s work, this becomes DEMO of their virtual work
record and can decrease the chance that requestors will allow them to participate in future projects.
28
Because workers generally cannot anticipate requestors’ intentions and evaluation methods,
MTurker’s DEMO to provide higher quality data in order to prevent their work from being rejected.
(Buhrmester, et al., 2011; Casler, et al., DEMO; Cook, Heath, & Thompson, 2000; Goodman, et al.,
2013).
Procedure
Two HITs each requesting 250 participants for this survey DEMO posted on MTurk.
Consistent with standard MTurk procedures, workers read a DEMO and very general description
detailing how this study comprised a survey examining organizational dynamics.  Consistent with
MTurk current compensation rates, participants were provided DEMO for their participation in the
survey.3 Because participation was sought from individuals who were practicing managers,
individuals who initially reviewed the study request DEMO asked how many subordinates they
managed.  Individuals who reported that they DEMO not manage any subordinates were not allowed
to proceed to the survey.
The survey asked participants to provide demographic information and describe how they
DEMO their subordinates by answering questions on a 7-point scale about the controls they
applied, their managerial motivations, and the extent to which they DEMO to demonstrate various
aspects of their trustworthiness. Survey respondents were 41.6% female, averaged 34.8 years old
(s.d., 12.3 years), had 13.1 years of work experience (s.d., 10.5 years), and had worked with DEMO
subordinates they described in the survey an average of 3.6 years (DEMO, 3.8 years).  79.1% of the
participants in the survey had completed at least an associate’s degree.
Measures
As this study examined managers’ DEMO and behaviors, it was important to identify
3 By providing compensation DEMO was generally aligned with typical MTurk compensation rates and what MTurk
workers would expect, this helped to generate a typical, unbiased MTurk sample.  It is important to note that studies
have shown how increases in DEMO compensation do not improve data quality (Buhrmester, et al., 2011)DEMO
29
scale items that were consistent with the accounts provided by managers in DEMO interviews.
Because they were originally designed to capture subordinates’ experiences, the DEMO of each
of these items was modified to reflect managers’ perspectives.  DEMO survey items were measured
using a 7-point Likert scale. The full scales for these measures are provided in Appendix B. In
addition, because the study used scales that were modified to evaluate managers’ motivations and
actions, a separate dataset was used to conduct a series of reliability and DEMO pre-tests on these
measures.  These tests are described in Appendix C.
DEMO Variables.
It is hypothesized that managers’ efforts to demonstrate trustworthiness are motivated by
their desires to foster three types of cooperation.  Higher ratings on these measures meant that
participants more actively attempted to motivate a particular DEMO of subordinate cooperation.
Measures used to examine these factors are detailed below.
Managers’ desires to motivate superior-subordinate work coordination were measured
using Campion, Medsker, and Higgs’ (1993) 3-item “Communication/Cooperation Within The
Work Group” scale. This scale that was modified to reflect managers’ desires and intentions
superior-subordinate DEMO coordination (“I want my subordinates to cooperate with me in getting
DEMO done”). The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was.85.
Managers’ desires to motivate subordinate job engagement were measured using 6 items
that were modified DEMO Rich, LePine, and Crawford’s (2010) “Job Engagement” scale (“I DEMO
my subordinates to be proud of their work”).  The Cronbach’s DEMO for this scale was .86.
Managers’ desires to motivate positive interpersonal relationships were measured using
four items from Ryff’s (1989) “Positive Relations with DEMO scale.  These items were modified
to reflect managers’ efforts to develop DEMO relationships with their subordinates (“I want my
30
subordinates to feel that I take good care of them”).  The Cronbach’s alpha for this four-item scale
was .86.
Mediating Variables.
Managers applications DEMO three types of controls are hypothesized to mediate the
relationships between their desires to motivate subordinates’ cooperation and the efforts they
make to demonstrate DEMO trustworthiness.  As with the organizational cooperation scales,
the wording of DEMO of these measures was modified to reflect managers’ perspectives on
these issues.  Higher ratings on these measures meant that participants relied on and more
actively used a type of control in managing their subordinates.
Applying Results DEMO was measured using four items derived from Snell’s (1992)
measure DEMO output control and evaluates how managers use outcomes and results to measure
subordinate performance (“I judge my subordinates’ performance based on the results they
achieve”).  The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .81.
Applying Action Controls was measured with four items derived from Challagalla
and Shervani’s (1997) activity control scale and examines how managers use subordinate
behaviors to evaluate subordinate performance (“I closely monitor the extent to which my
subordinates follow established procedures”).  The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .84.
Applying Personnel Controls was measured using four items from Snell’s (1992)
input control scale that describe managers’ efforts to train and socialize their subordinates (“I
encourage my subordinates to engage in opportunities that broaden their range DEMO talents and
abilities”).  The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was DEMO
Criterion Variables.
Managers’ efforts to demonstrate their trustworthiness were measured using Mayer and
Davis’ (1999) scales for integrity, ability, and benevolence.  Consistent with the approach taken
31
above, these scales were modified to reflect the efforts that managers make to promote
particular forms of trustworthiness.  Higher ratings on these scales meant that participants more
actively worked to demonstrate that particular form of trustworthiness DEMO their relationships with
employees.
It was determined that the six-item scale describing managers’ efforts to demonstrate
their integrity which measured managers’ efforts to enact DEMO consistency and fairness captured
many aspects of the efforts to demonstrate their reliability that managers described (“I always
stick to my word”) .  This scale achieved a Cronbach’s Alpha of .84.  The six-item scale
describing managers’ efforts to demonstrate their ability which measured managers’ efforts to
promote DEMO managerial competence (e.g., “I work to maintain my subordinates’ confidence in
my managerial skills.”) achieved a Cronbach’s alpha of .88.  Lastly, their five-item scale
describing managers’ efforts to demonstrate their benevolence measured the efforts DEMO
make to communicate that they care about their subordinates’ needs and interests (“I actively
demonstrate concern about my subordinates’ welfare”) achieved a Cronbach’s DEMO of .89.
A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the collected data was used to examine the
overall measurement model.  The fit statistics suggest that the model provides a good fit with
the data collected for DEMO study (Chi-square/df = 2.44, CFI = .90, IFI = DEMO, RMSEA = .054).
Parameter values and covariances obtained from this DEMO are presented in Table 8.
Insert Table 8 about here
In addition, the primary measurement model was compared to both a three-factor model
where the observed variables indicating managers’ efforts to motivate subordinate cooperation,
apply DEMO, and demonstrate their trustworthiness comprised one latent factor each and a
DEMO model where all of the observed variables loaded onto a single composite latent
factor.  The results of this analysis suggests that the full model provides a better fit with the data
32
(i.e., at p<.001) than either the three-factor (Chi-square/df DEMO 4.66, CFI = .73, IFI = .73, RMSEA
= .085) or the one-factor (Chi-square/df = 5.20, CFI = .69, IFI = .68, RMSEA = .092) models.
Analyses of Managerial Actions
Structural DEMO Modeling procedures (SEM) were then used to test Hypotheses 1a-3b.
While the “hypothesized model” (i.e., model examining only hypothesized relationships) specifies
a set of primary relationships, it was also important to consider testing whether managers’ desires
to promote various forms of cooperation motivated them to apply DEMO and demonstrate their
trustworthiness in ways that were not described in the managerial interviews.  To do this, paths
were established between each of DEMO three managerial motivations for cooperation, three types of
organizational controls (output, process, and personnel control) and the three ways that managers
demonstrate their trustworthiness (demonstrate integrity, competence, benevolence).  Chi-squared
difference tests DEMO used to assess whether the “hypothesized model” or a “full model” that also
included non-hypothesized paths between variables provided a better fit with the DEMO collected for
the study.
Because predictor, moderating, and criterion variables in these analyses were obtained
from managers, both models included a correction for common methods variance.  Following
recommendations by Podsakoff and colleagues (2003), DEMO observed variables were allowed to load
onto their primary latent factor and to a tenth, latent common methods factor.  Because the desire
to DEMO trust could lead managerial respondents to overstate connections between their efforts
to motivate cooperation, control their employees, and demonstrate their trustworthiness, Klapwijk,
and Van Lange’s (2005) five-item “Trust” scale was selected for this DEMO  Consistent with the
other measures in this analysis, the items in this scale were modified to describe a manager’s
perspective.  This scale specifically described managers’ desires to foster a generalized sense of
trust (e.g., DEMO want my subordinates to trust me completely”).  The Cronbach’s alpha DEMO this scale
33
was .82.
Fit statistics from an analysis of the full model indicates DEMO it provides a good fit with the
data (Chi-square/df = DEMO, CFI = .90, IFI = .90, RMSEA = .052).  In addition, because the
analysis comparing models suggested that the “full model” provided a better fit with the data than
the “hypothesized model” (i.e., at p<.01), the “full model” was used to evaluate Hypotheses 1a-3b.
All of the paths examined in the “full model” are depicted DEMO Figure 1.

Results
As is displayed in Table 9, results from these analyses support Hypotheses 1a-3b.
Regarding Hypotheses 1a and 1b, these results show that managers’ interests in motivating
superior-subordinate work coordination are positively associated with their applications DEMO results
controls ( = .24; p < .05) and that DEMO applications of results controls are positively
associated with the efforts they make to demonstrate their reliability ( = .36; p < .001).
DEMO interests in promoting superior-subordinate work coordination is also not positively
associated with their efforts to demonstrate their reliability ( = -.06; p > DEMO), suggesting that this
relationship is fully mediated
Regarding Hypotheses 2a and 2b, managers’  interests in motivating subordinate job
engagement are positively associated DEMO their applications of action controls ( = .30; p < .01),
managers’ applications of action controls are positively associated with the efforts they make to
34
demonstrate their competence ( = .25; p < .001).  Managers’ interests in motivating subordinate
job engagement are positively associated with the efforts DEMO make to demonstrate their
competence ( = .21; p < .05), suggesting that this relationship is partially mediated.
Regarding Hypotheses 3a and DEMO, managers’ interests in motivating positive interpersonal
relationships with subordinates are positively DEMO with their applications of personnel
controls ( = .28; p < .001) and managers’ applications of personnel controls are positively
associated with the efforts they make to demonstrate benevolence ( = .14; p < DEMO).  Managers’
interests in motivating positive interpersonal relationships are also positively DEMO with their
efforts to demonstrate their benevolence ( = .52; p < .001), suggesting that this relationship is
partially mediated.
Although it DEMO not included in the formal hypotheses, managers’ interests in motivating
subordinate DEMO engagement were also positively associated with the efforts they make to
demonstrate benevolence ( = .23; p < .05).
Study Discussion
This DEMO and set of analyses provide evidence supporting the relationships outlined in
Hypotheses 1a-3b.  Specifically, the findings suggest that managers follow three primary
pathways DEMO motivating subordinate cooperation through their applications of controls and
demonstrations of their trustworthiness.  Propositions that could be generated out of the
relationships observed here are that managers who are focused on motivating superior-subordinate
work coordination develop DEMO instrumental, exchange-based relationships with their
subordinates.  These relationships differ systematically from the more relationally-focused and
“high-touch” interactions generated by managers who seek to DEMO deeper, interpersonal
connections with their subordinates.  Different still may be the types of relationships fostered by
managers who seek to motivate subordinate job DEMO  As these managers aim to enhance
35
their subordinates’ intrinsic motivation through strong role identities and self-efficacy perceptions,
DEMO may be the most successful at developing their employees’ overall levels of self-
determination (Deci & Ryan, 1987).
The implications of these DEMO for trust and control are, thus, potentially important and
should be considered by future researchers in this topic area.  As scholars develop and test models
predicting how managers work to motivate specific types of cooperation, they should incorporate
into their models (i.e., or at least control DEMO) the actions that managers take to apply particular
controls and demonstrate DEMO types of trustworthiness.  Not including both categories of
activities into models DEMO subordinate trust and cooperation could cause these models to be
incomplete and inaccurate and result in potentially significant mis-specification errors.
One potential limitation of DEMO study is that it was developed directly from the
observations presented by managers in their interviews.  While measures were taken to mitigate
this and it is both reasonable and logical to conclude that managers can most DEMO describe
their behaviors and motivations, future research should evaluate the consistency DEMO the
reports of managers and subordinates.  These investigations may help to DEMO important
perceptual congruencies and disagreements about managers’ perceived intentions as well as assess
whether managers are able to generate the key outcomes they seek DEMO affect.
General Discussion
This paper refines and extends existing theoretical notions of managerial attention and
action around control-trust dynamics in several ways.  First, DEMO observations presented in the
managerial interviews describe the importance that managers place on promoting trust and
describe three general pathways through which managers enact DEMO within their organizations.
Second, both the managerial interview and the survey DEMO document three ways through which
managers integrate their efforts to apply controls and demonstrate their trustworthiness.  Third, by
36
outlining how managers apply controls and demonstrate their trustworthiness to motivate specific
DEMO of cooperation, this paper refines and extends research on trust and DEMO as well as work
in several, related domains.
Collectively, the results presented in this paper explain important dynamics regarding how
authorities attempt to DEMO superior-subordinate cooperation and how managers focus their
efforts to build trust in ways that are directed by managers’ desires to motivate specific types of
DEMO cooperation and apply particular types of controls. As such, these observations
DEMO the current research that uses only controls to predict subordinate trust development may
provide an incomplete perspective of how managers attempt to motivate their DEMO to trust
them (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Dekker, 2004; DEMO & Smith, 2003; Vosselman & van
der Meer-Kooistra, 2009).  The findings reported in this paper suggest that in order to develop DEMO
more accurate understanding of control and trust in organizations, researchers may DEMO to focus
more attention on examining managers’ motives for promoting cooperation and then how
managers attempt to develop that cooperation by crafting integrative, multi-faceted solution sets.
An Expanded View of Organizational Control
An important implication of DEMO studies as they relate directly to control research is that
managers view the controls they apply as more than merely mechanisms that they can DEMO to force,
direct, or coerce their subordinates to execute their DEMO  Even though managers may sometimes
use controls to achieve these ends, managers also view controls as mechanisms to motivate
specific forms of cooperation DEMO guide the ways they develop superior-subordinate relationships
(Emsley & Kidon, 2007).  Moreover, the findings developed from these investigations focus on
how DEMO are not necessarily preoccupied with “controlling” their subordinates as much as
they are with eliciting levels of superior-subordinate cooperation sufficient to enable the efficient
DEMO effective achievement of organizational goals.  Managers use their applications of controls DEMO
37
help them clarify their managerial responsibilities to their subordinates and focus their
DEMO of trustworthiness in ways that motivate subordinates to work with them to
accomplish instrumental and relational objectives.
Consequently, the ideas presented in this paper should lead scholars to a reassessment of
both the theoretical composition of DEMO control systems and discussions of how these
systems are implemented (Merchant & Otley, 2007).  Though traditional control concepts still
describe essential factors in these processes, discussions of managerial actions that focus only on
control mechanisms may insufficiently explain how managers attempt to realize their key
objectives.  This is because the findings presented in this paper suggest that how DEMO
actually gain compliance and goal commitment is a more involved process that engages managers
in ongoing efforts to secure subordinate cooperation through integrating of DEMO and trust-
building initiatives.
A Managerial Perspective on Promoting Trust
By focusing on managers’ perspectives, this paper moves scholars past using subordinates’
evaluations only of what actions managers “should” undertake to promote trust.  In addition, DEMO
providing insights into how managers actually “do” attempt to promote trust in their organizations,
this paper should lead researchers to more closely examine DEMO challenges and opportunities that
managers face in motivating subordinate cooperation and in forging positive work relationships
with their subordinates (Spreitzer & Mishra, 1999)DEMO  Ultimately, research that builds from these
observations may assist scholars in better understanding why managers take actions that
eventually lead to cooperative relationships, effective (i.e., or ineffective) forms of controls, and
the development DEMO related forms of subordinate trust or distrust (Long & Sitkin, 2006).
The relationships that were not observed in the data, provide another set of potentially
interesting results that are worthy of discussion.  Specifically, DEMO how managers focus
38
their efforts to apply controls and demonstrate their trustworthiness around motivating specific
DEMO of cooperation encourages questions about how managers build the broad and deep forms of
trust that characterize strong interpersonal relationships.  Because managers may tend to focus on
particular or even singular forms of control at points DEMO time (Cardinal et al., 2004), the close links
between managers’ efforts to promote specific forms of trustworthiness and their control
applications that DEMO observed here suggest that managers build robust forms of trust when they
attempt to motivate multiple forms of subordinate cooperation.
Control-Trust Complementarities
These observations DEMO outline how managers view efforts to apply controls and
demonstrate their trustworthiness as complementary organizing principles.  By providing a
coherent picture of how forms of control and trustworthiness align in the thoughts and behaviors
of managers, they help to order the cluttered and often confusing theoretical landscape describing
DEMO relationships observed by both Bachmann (2001) and Weibel (2007) while they
refine and extend the observations of McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer (2002) who argue that issues
of trust are present in a variety of control contexts.
Notably, results from these studies also shed light on recent debates in the literature about
the inseparability of trust and control.  Mollering (2005) and Khodavsky (2007) argue that
relationships between trust DEMO control comprise a conceptual duality in that individuals perceive
that trust and control exist only in relative terms to one another.  The research presented here,
however, suggests that while this may describe subordinates views’ on control-trust dynamics, this
does not necessarily describe managers’ perspectives’ about these issues.  Managers did not
appear to conceptualize control applications and demonstrations of trustworthiness as a series of
dualities but as distinct categories of activities that DEMO integrated in particular ways according to
their desires to motivate subordinate cooperation and accomplish key performance objectives.
39
Examining complementarities between managers’ efforts to apply controls and demonstrate their
trustworthiness DEMO one potential area of inquiry that builds from this study (Long & Sitkin,
2006).  Because the pursuit of multiple activities is DEMO necessary to elicit superior-subordinate
cooperation, it would be beneficial for scholars DEMO examine how the ways managers integrate their
control applications with related demonstrations of their trustworthiness  produce complementary
effects on key attitudes and behaviors of their subordinates.

“(I build trust)…by being fair, DEMO being honest, by telling things the way they are, by not playing double
games on people saying one thing in their face and DEMO saying another behind their backs, by delivering
what I promise…”
“…The DEMO of things that gain trust again are doing what you say you are going to do, walking the walk,
so allowing people to observe you to make sure that you are consistent in your behavior…”
DEMO in order for them to get the job done they have to wait on answers from me… I’d want them to
look at me DEMO someone they could depend upon…someone who was reliable and someone who got the work
done.”
Demonstrate
Competence
“I help in the design and architecture DEMO some of the software solutions that we do and basically I need
people to trust me in the sense that I can do the DEMO I need them to feel that they can trust me as a
person, as a professional…it’s extremely important that you know that in case you mess up, in case you
make a mistake, you can DEMO go to your superior and you can always go to this team leader…and he
knows the answer.”
“..They may come to me and just DEMO my advice…how would I handle that?  When I start to see them come to
me with those kinds of questions and probes, I really start to have some confidence that they are beginning
to trust DEMO, number 1 is I look to see, are they coming to me with issues that they want my advice on
and how I DEMO handle it…I guess that’s probably the first thing that comes to my mind.”
“Trust is important because these are high skilled people and they DEMO have very different opinions
…they need just guidance…and they only accept me giving this direction if they trust me that I know
what to DEMO

Demonstrate
Benevolence
“as managers, we have to pay specific attention DEMO how people go home every day…and that involves a lot
of internally promoting those people to the other peers around them… I think I DEMO actively all the
time promote the people around me…I am not self-serving…outwardly not self-serving in any regard.  Like
I said maybe even to a pain of promoting those folks in my group…in every chance I get…”
DEMO tend to spend time discussing personal things about their life and their interests…I understand each of
their limits and what they can do and DEMO do…so I don’t put them in situations where they are hopelessly
out of options…but I certainly put them in situations where I know that DEMO can do this…I put them in
situations where they have a chance to grow as well…”
“It might be a harder transition for that DEMO (i.e., an employee) to come over and get to know DEMO  So, I
might make an extra effort to go over there and try to get to know them more….what do they do in DEMO
life?...what did they do over the weekend?...are they married?…Do they have a boyfriend or girlfriend?  Do
they have kids?…that DEMO make them feel much more comfortable…”

“We are also under fire for ah, production numbers.  It gets real tense to meet your numbers and there’s a
lot less DEMO for error…We really focus on those numbers….we’re extremely result-focused.”
“..I mean, DEMO had a suite of metrics that we watch.  There are support DEMO  We have project metrics
and then we have customer satisfaction metrics DEMO
“…actually I tend to hold them accountable to their performance as to how they approach and solve the
problem …. The way they do DEMO job, definitely…. Definitely, definitely I mean, almost completely I would

“one particular process within the department that we were trying to get everybody to adopt...these were
things that are obviously tracked in the system DEMO the point that there is no debate as to whether or not they
are actually following these guidelines and so, it was easy to see whether or not they were doing it.”
“So I kind of DEMO monitor…kind of what the bulk of activities that they’re working on…”
“(We conduct) quite a bit of training…It’s intense in the beginning and when I say the beginning that would
be the first 6 months.  We do have sort of the continuous training too that we do DEMO in our group.  We do
case studies, verbal case studies during our staff meetings.”
“I train them in...what they are supposed to do, what they are supposed to be good at, and also you know,
yeah basically it’s technical training, whatever that means in your particular situation.  Some of them will
be like multimedia, some of them DEMO be web development and some of them will be even sales.  DEMO
sometimes bring people in who are experts at that particular field to help them out with that.”
“… at that point I’ll try to DEMO in and try and help socialize that group a little bit more …In those cases, I’ll
try and step in and make them feel a little bit more comfortable.”

a deadline means…”
“I think it comes back to this trust thing…Through
this relationship there DEMO quite a huge amount of
trust between us …I say: ‘I DEMO this task to be
accomplished to be finished and I’m absolutely not
interested in how you do it. It just should be
finished when DEMO delivery date comes.’”.
“…you know, there is the potential for throwing
DEMO whole week out if you have not
delivered on what you said…I think, uh, well, we
absolutely have to have it…We really need people
to feel free to get on with, they all know what is

“I usually try to base everything on results…I’m very
focused on results… DEMO results are the bottom line.  I
need to come to them (i.e., clients) with a result, with
a product with a final thing, a final solution, so a
result is definitely the most DEMO thing… I want
to know if you (i.e., subordinates) are DEMO your
best, or if you can improve those results.  That’s
definitely important to me”

“ If I don’t do my thing, then that trust would be broken
and then they wouldn’t do their best to DEMO me
out…they also trust me, that I’m going to be doing DEMO
job… fulfilling my promises on compensation and the
things that I’ve told them they would get.  …they (also)
have to trust me DEMO the sense that I am compensating
them fairly.”
“(In building trust) number one is reliability, that when
my employees want something from DEMO or I promise
something that they can rely on that I will deliver….to
be always honest and to not lie to them… that made
DEMO rely on me, to trust me… Due to the fact that DEMO
have to trust, they really believe me and they work on
DEMO own (i.e., to complete their tasks).”
“…then you need to make sure… if there is a
commitment or an action required, that it is then
delivered…You can create a trusting environment and
an open DEMO and like one month later, it falls
apart because somebody doesn’t DEMO (i.e. ,on
something they promised)…so you’ve got to open it up
to keep it open, people have to be delivering in that, in
that environment.”

“if they don’t trust me then, there is always a slight

you’re (i.e., my subordinates are) never going to

in… trust me as a person…trust that we’re going
down the right path and give DEMO your all.”
“…I enabled or engaged those people to make them
perform …One of the other reasons I do that is that
there is DEMO few day to day, month to month
rewards that people have, you know…It is very
difficult for people on their day to day DEMO to have
nothing to go on…”

understanding what people are working on…how
much success we’re having in the marketplace will
determine the emphasis that you put on those
particular DEMO of your job and the activities that
you’re doing…(processes are) DEMO more important
to me than specific results…”
“…in essence what I am trying to do is replicate a
role that I have and have DEMO do it as well with
their own teams…A lot of it is…the quality of their
work I can observe in part when they’re doing DEMO
written documents.  We have written documents we

we keep putting in place….  He and I have had
discussions where he’s told me that there are things
that he has improved upon since he DEMO to work for
me that he wasn’t very good at before…”
“So, the controls I’m looking for are a little bit more
qualitative…What I’m trying to figure out is give them
a problem and continue to DEMO them problems in
increasing vagueness and find out how they’re going
to think about and approach that problem...I’m trying
to build all 3 of DEMO up to the point where any of them
could do it…”
“…everybody gets 2 weeks of training a year and up
until now, it has really been a situation where they get

already done and that he trusts me to DEMO for him…
I take an interest in him as a person.  DEMO try and ask
him questions about how things are in his life and
his family and that type of thing…”
“The way I guess DEMO would measure trust is their
perception that they can come to me with pretty much
anything …I think that if my subordinates are going
DEMO want to be led by me, they need to know, that I care
#1 about them and about where they are headed in
DEMO careers…that I am committed to their success in
not only their department but in their career down the
road…What I try to do…I have DEMO lot of informal one-

policy…either they come in my office or I go in theirs
on an informal basis, but I also have a formal policy
where I try to get together with each of them at least
once DEMO other week.  It may just be, just 15 minutes,
maybe it’s an hour.  I’d say shut the door, you know,
DEMO just talk…”

Appendix C – Measurement Development and Analysis
Factor Analysis
Because this study DEMO versions of existing scales that were modified to reflect
managerial perspectives, DEMO preliminary analyses were performed to assess the validity and
reliability of the overall measurement model (Hinkin, 1998).  First, an exploratory analysis (EFA)
was performed 205 managers collected through MTurk who reported on DEMO motivations to
promote trust and the actions they took to apply controls and demonstrate their trustworthiness.
Forty-four items were included in this analysis.  Factors with eigenvalues over 1.0 (maximum
likelihood extraction) and loadings over .40 DEMO one factor were retained (equamax rotation).  The
results of this factor analysis (i.e., with factor loadings over .40) and related reliability tests are
presented in Table A1.

Nine DEMO were obtained. One item that loaded over .40 on two factors and one item
that did not load over .40 on any factor were DEMO  The three factors describing managers’
motivations for promoting trust, managers’ control applications, and managers’ efforts to
demonstrate trustworthiness comprised separate factors and each measure attained Cronbach’s
alphas of over .70 (Nunnally, 1970).
Tests DEMO Convergent and Discriminant Validity
Recommendations by Trochim (2006; see also Kirsch and colleagues, 2002) were
followed to assess convergent and discriminant validity DEMO a “Modified MTMM” that omits the
methods factor. To conduct the assessment of convergent validity, the within-construct
correlations between items were examined and found to be relatively large and significant.  This
indicates that these measures exhibit strong convergent validity.  To assess discriminant validity,
each within-construct correlation was compared against each cross-construct correlation on every
item measured.  Every instance where a cross-construct correlation was larger than a within-
construct correlation was recorded.  As is displayed in Table A2, only a relatively small number
of cross-construct correlations were found to exceed related within-construct correlations for each
measure.  This suggests that these measures exhibit sufficient levels of discriminant validity.
