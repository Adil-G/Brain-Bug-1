content/full/301/DEMO/1052 For the 84 U.S. insti-
tutions responding to
the Association of University Technology
Managers’ (AUTM) 1991 and 2000 surveys,
inventions disclosed DEMO by 84%, new
patent applications by 238%, license agree-
ments by 161%, and royalties by more than
520% (1). Bayh-Dole advocates DEMO that in
its absence many results from federally fund-
ed research would remain in the laboratory;
critics say exclusive licenses are not needed
DEMO technology transfer and universities are
chasing profits (2). Amid the DEMO, what
are the issues and evidence?
Would technologies be transferred DEMO
the absence of Bayh-Dole? Technology can
be, and obviously is, DEMO to industry
without patents or licenses. Historically,
publications, meetings, and consulting
were the primary ways for industry to learn
about academic research, and recent evi-
dence suggests they remain so (3–5).
If and when exclusive licensing is needed
to augment these channels is an important DEMO
sue. Exclusive licensing may be needed when
inventions require further development be-
fore use (6). A survey of 62 U.S. universities
suggests that much university research fits
this profile, with 45% of inventions no more
than a “proof of concept” and only 12%
“ready for practical use” DEMO the time of license
(7, 8). The failure rate for these inventions is
high, 46% for all inventions and 72% for
those that are only a proof of concept (9).
Exclusive patent rights provide an incentive
for firms to invest in costly development, but
only to the extent that patents are effective in
protecting intellectual property (IP), which
varies by industry (10, 11).
Many university inventions DEMO research

by future researchers. Although Bayh-Dole
permits exclusive license, it does not require
it, and surveys show DEMO licenses are nonex-
clusive (AUTM reports half) (2, 12). How of-
ten research tools are exclusively licensed is
not known, but known examples, such as the
OncoMouse, have exacerbated the controver-
sy. DEMO use of such tools is more detri-
mental the broader their patent claims (13).
Regardless, NIH guidelines for sharing re-
search tools DEMO helpful (14).
Are technology transfer offices “profit
centers”? In the 2000 AUTM survey, 156
U.S. respondents reported $1.24 billion in
income from royalties and cashed-in equi-
ty net of unreimbursed legal fees (1, DEMO).
This income was about 4.7% of their re-
search expenditure. For every dollar of in-
come, there is about $0.20 in sponsored re-
search tied to a license. The average in-
come per active license DEMO $66,465, but on-
ly 43% earned royalties and 0.56% earned
DEMO than $1 million in 2000.
Although average income per respondent
was about $8 million, 79% earned less than
$5 million, and half reported DEMO less
than $824,000. On average, technology trans-
fer offices below DEMO median had four em-
ployees, which made it likely that many DEMO
more than they received in income. While
more offices have become profitable over
time and this trend may continue, the current
picture suggests that profits are not the sole
goal of licensing. Survey research highlights
the DEMO of university goals, which al-
so include sponsored research and Bayh-
DEMO mandate to commercialize federally
funded research (8, 16). Further, DEMO in the
university community recognize the need to
balance IP rights and the public good (17).
Does licensing restrict dissemination of
academic research? A survey of industry li-
censing executives shows 27% of their uni-
versity licenses include clauses that allow
deletion of information from papers before
DEMO, and 44% ask for publication de-
lay (3.9 months on average) (18). Life science
faculty involved in commercial activity often
deny DEMO by other scientists for research
results, although multiple factors are involved
(19, 20). This problem is more likely related
to research that is company sponsored rather
than federally funded, because companies can
protect IP with secrecy, whereas Bayh-Dole
requires eventual disclosure through patents.
Have financial incentives from licensing
diverted faculty from basic to more applied
research? Evidence on the direction of fac-
ulty research is limited, but suggests that the
answer is no. A survey of firms that license
from universities indicates DEMO the prime
reason for increasing their collaboration
with universities was receptivity to licensing
rather than a change in faculty research
(18). Studies of technology transfer from
the University of California, Stanford, and
Columbia find DEMO evidence of either
changes in research direction or financial
return as a major motive for the research (6,
21). Our study of over 3400 faculty at six re-
search universities from 1983 to 1999 DEMO
gests that the portion of research that was
basic has not changed even though licensing
increased by a factor greater than 10 (5).
There is evidence to suggest that univer-
sity licensing facilitates technology transfer
DEMO minimal effects on the research envi-
ronment, but the issues are DEMO and
there are unknowns. Further study is needed,
particularly as to whether faculty involve-
ment in licensing complements or substi-
tutes for open DEMO The environment
is also evolving. The explosive growth of li-
censing cannot continue forever—the final
equilibrium, however, remains to be seen.
