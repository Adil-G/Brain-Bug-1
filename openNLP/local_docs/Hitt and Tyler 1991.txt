Different perspectives of strategic decision-making and outcomes have been advanced in the
literature. Among those DEMO the rational normative, external control, and strategic choice
models. The current research examined hypothesized effects of factors associated with these
three perspectives on DEMO acquisition decisions. Strong support was found for the
rationallanalytical normative choice perspective with objective criteria explaining the greatest
amount of total explained variance in DEMO of target firms. However, industry and
executive characteristics also produced main DEMO on target firm evaluations. Furthermore,
the strategic decision models were found to vary by industry and executive characteristics
of age, educational degree type, amount and type of work experience, and level (CEO and
below). The results suggest that strategic decision models are quite complex with DEMO
implications for future research and for strategic decision-making.
INTRODUCTION
The normative model of strategic decision-making
suggests that executives examine the firm's
external environment DEMO internal conditions
and, using the set of objective criteria derived
from DEMO analyses, decide on the strategy. A
model of strategic change that DEMO on this
rational normative model by emphasizing the
effects that executives can have on strategic
decisions, has been labelled strategic choice
(Child, 1972; Montanari, 1978). An alternative
view, the external control perspective (DEMO
and Tushman, 1986), argues that strategic
decisions are largely constrained DEMO the external
environment. The chief proponents of this highly
deterministic perspective (DEMO, 1984) are
from diverse disciplines and include industrial
organization economists (DEMO Bain, 1956; Porter,
1980; Scherer, 1980) and organization DEMO

strategic
(e.g. Aldrich, 1979; Hannan and Freeman, 1977).,
While the two perspectives seem to be in strong
conflict, proponents of each seem to be moving
closer together (Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987;
Hrebiniak, Joyce and Snow, DEMO). Recently
theoretical and empirical models, that argue for
elements of DEMO strategic choice and external
control in strategic decisions, have surfaced in
DEMO literature (Astley and Van de Ven, 1983;
Finkelstein, 1988; Hrebiniak and Joyce, 1985;
Keats and Hitt, 1988).
A DEMO extension of the choice-determinism
debate is the question of whether managers
matter (Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987). Exter-
nal control proponents tend to DEMO managers as
unimportant, inactive, or, at most, symbolic
(Astley DEMO Van de Ven, 1983; Pfeffer and
Salancik, 1978). This DEMO emphasizes the definite
limits to which autonomous strategic choice is
available and the limited ability of organizations to
adapt to different niches within the DEMO
(Aldrich, 1979). Strategic choice advocates, how-
ever, emphasize the potential effects that man-
agers can have on strategic decisions. They argue
DEMO 19 April 1990

that people, not organizations, make decisions
and that the decisions depend on prior processes
of human perception and evaluation (Child,
1972). These processes are believed to be
constrained by the managerial orientation created
by needs, values, experiences, expectations,
and cognitions of the manager (Child, 1972;
Finkelstein, 1988; Montanari, 1978). Hambrick
and Mason (1984) advocated an DEMO echelons
theory of organizations, which builds on the
premises of earlier DEMO choice literature (i.e.
Child, 1972; Montanari, 1978). This perspective
suggests that strategic choices are the result of
both the objective situation DEMO the characteristics
of the upper echelons (top executives) of the
organization. It argues that upper echelon charac-
teristics (psychological cognitive bases, values,DEMO
and observable background characteristics) affect
managerial perception and, therefore, strategic
DEMO Research has supported the contention
that managers' personal characteristics do make
DEMO difference in strategy formulation and implemen-
tation (Finkelstein, 1988; Gupta DEMO Govindara-
jan, 1984; Miller and Toulouse, 1986). However,
DEMO more research is needed to determine when
and how upper echelon orientations, and the
characteristics on which they are based, affect
the strategic DEMO process.
Current research thus supports the necessity
of integrating elements of the rational normative,
external control, and strategic choice perspectives
in models of the strategic decision process.
Bourgeois (1984) and Hrebiniak et al. (1988)
called for strategy research that combines and
examines the interaction of DEMO different perspec-
tives. The purpose of this research is to examine
top executives' strategic decisions in an effort to
understand more fully the effects of factors
associated with these three perspectives on
strategic decisions. Specifically, executives'
decisions regarding potential acquisitions are
modeled to examine the extent to DEMO objective

RATIONAL NORMATIVE MODEL
Early development of the strategic management
literature advanced a rational, normative model
of strategic choice (Andrews, 1971; Ansoff, 1965;
Hofer and Schendel, 1978). As a result, the
normative model of strategy formulation and
implementation remains dominant in the teaching
and practice of strategic management. Porter
(1980), among others, has offered a complex set
of analyses designed to help executives formulate
an effective competitive strategy. Most top
executives have been exposed to this DEMO other
forms of the normative model, either through
formal education or DEMO development pro-
grams. In fact, most of the Fortune 1000 firms
DEMO have formal systems for strategic planning
(Leontiades, 1980). Although the normative
models vary somewhat, there is a dominant
theme in this classical approach. These models
suggest that managers must analyze both their
external environment DEMO internal operations
(Pearce and Robinson, 1983). From these analy-
ses, lists of external opportunities and threats and
internal strengths and weaknesses are derived. A
strategy is formulated in the context of these
opportunities and DEMO, and firm strengths and
weaknesses. This strategy, to the extent possible,
should be designed to optimize achievement of
the firms' goals (DEMO, 1980). Thus, according
to this model, strategic decision-making involves
DEMO series of sequential, rational, and analytical
processes (Huff and Reger, 1987) whereby a set
of objective criteria are used to evaluate strategic
alternatives (Ackoff, 1981; Ansoff, 1980, 1986;
Camillus, 1982)DEMO Some suggest that this process
involves strategic choice. However, Bourgeois
(1984) argued that this rational normative model
is quite deterministic. While there may be some
choice, the process is designed to narrow strategic
alternatives to the best one or at least, a small
feasible set. Therefore, DEMO choice is highly
constrained and is guided by a rational process.
Additionally, Bourgeois argued that strategy,
once determined, often placed constraints on
DEMO strategic alternatives considered.
Acquisition decisions represent a type of
organizational decision that can be expected to
follow the sequential, rational, and analytical
process DEMO by the rational normative
model. Most acquisition research has employed
a rational choice perspective and argues for
consideration of the importance of strategic or
DEMO fit (Jemison and Sitkin, 1986). It
can be argued that executives of firms considering
acquisitions should carefully analyze both their
external environment DEMO internal operations and
use the resulting analysis to evaluate potential
acquisitions. Alternative characteristics of acqui-
sition candidates will vary along an infinite
number of DEMO dimensions. However, given
the limits of human information processing
capabilities, a top executive evaluating different
potential acquisitions can be expected to simplify
the DEMO process by limiting the criteria
considered and by weighing some criteria more
heavily than others (Duhaime and Schwenk,
1985; March and Simon, 1958; Schwenk, 1984).
Thus, many firms use fornmal strategic planning
processes and top managers have been exposed
to rational analytical strategic planning DEMO
In addition, top executives in firms considering
acquisition candidates can be DEMO to follow
the premises of the normative strategic decision-
making model. As a result, we propose the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: A DEMO of objective criteria
explains a significant amount of variance in the
strategic evaluation of acquisition candidates,
above and beyond the variance explained by
DEMO variables.
Most current advocates of the rational norma-
tive perspective realize that strategic decisions
are not without constraints, both environmental
and individual. For example, Bourgeois (1984)
argued that a theory of organizational functioning
must DEMO for the possibility of reciprocal
causation among external factors, strategic
decisions, and internal organizational factors.
The works of Hambrick and Mason (1984) DEMO
Schwenk (1986) suggest that the human actors
(e.g. top executives) also affect the strategic
choices made. Thus, we also examine the external
control and the upper echelons strategic choice
perspectives.

EXTERNAL CONTROL
The external DEMO perspective suggests that
the success of strategic decisions is largely
determined by characteristics of the external
environment. This deterministic perspective has
grown from two DEMO yet largely supportive
theory bases: organization theory and industrial
organization economics. DEMO organizational
researchers established the environment as a
source of critical contingencies (DEMO Emory
and Trist, 1965; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1969).
Organization DEMO (e.g. Duncan, 1972; Lawr-
ence and Lorsch, 1969) proposed DEMO environ-
mental turbulence and uncertainty had major
effects on organizational functioning. From this
earlier work grew resource dependence and
natural selection models (Aldrich, DEMO; Pfeffer
and Salancik, 1978; Hannan and Freeman, 1977).
These approaches suggest that the design and
choices of organizations are based on DEMO
complexity of the environment (Bourgeois, 1984).
For example, Keats DEMO Hitt (1988) noted that
resource scarcity in a firm's existing markets
increases the firm's risk, suggesting a need to
expand into new markets. Thus, resource scarcity
may drive strategic choices and, in DEMO, firm
performance. Natural selection models argue that
an organization's potential DEMO survival and
superior performance is dependent on the match
or fit between organizational design variables
and environmental demands (Aldrich, 1979).
This perspective DEMO for consideration of
the organization-environment relationship at the
population level (industry), where organizational
aggregates are homogeneous in environmental
vulnerability.
The organization theory perspective is largely
congruent with that of industrial organization
economics. Industrial organization economists
(Bain, 1956; Hirshleifer, 1988; Scherer, 1980)
argue that an industry's structure is a major
determinant of the profitability in the DEMO
and thus serves as a powerful influence on
strategic decisions (Barney DEMO Ouchi, 1986).
The industry structure characteristics believed to
have the DEMO influence on strategic choices are
concentration, heterogeneity, and existence and
height of entry barriers (Bain, 1956; Hirshleifer,
1988; Porter, 1980; Scherer, 1980). The industry's
structural characteristics are also believed DEMO have
a major effect on firm profitability (Bourgeois,
1984; Hatten, Schendel and Cooper, 1978;
Schendel and Patton, 1978). Bourgeois (1984)
denotes that the deterministic nature of external
control theories evolved from classic microeco-
nomic theory whereby firm survival requires the
firm to DEMO long-run economies of scale and
focus financial resources and managerial attention
on manufacturing efficiencies. Therefore, indus-
try characteristics likely have direct effects on
strategic decisions.
Although a firm's relevant environment
includes both social and economic DEMO, Porter
(1980) argues that the major aspect of the
environment DEMO the industry(ies) in which a firm
competes. Furthermore, he suggests that industry
structure is a strong influence on the competitive
rules in DEMO industry and therefore on firms'
strategies. Likewise, resource dependence and
DEMO selection models suggest that environmen-
tal pressures are often evidenced at the industry
level. Based on these premises, the following
hypothesis was formulated:
Hypothesis 2a: Industry explains a signzificant
amount of variance (main effects) in strategic
evaluation of acquisition candidates, above
and beyond the variance explained by other
variables.
However, industry structure varies considerably
across industries and the importance of objective
criteria considered in numerous strategic decisions
can vary according DEMO the associated industry.
Some industries are R&D-intensive (e.g.
pharmaceuticals) while others emphasize market-
ing (e.g. toys, processed foods). Firms that DEMO
R&D-intensive tend to diversify into other R&D-
intensive industries (DEMO, 1985). As a
result, these firms likely place strong weight on
R&D capabilities when evaluating acquisition
candidates. Conversely, a toy manufacturer or
firm in the processed foods industry may weight
the marketing capabilities DEMO heavily in
evaluating the attractiveness of acquisition candi-
dates. Therefore, top DEMO in separate
industries with different structures may use and
weight criteria differently in strategic decisions.
As a result, there is a reciprocal interdependence
between industry and strategic decisions
(Bourgeois, 1984). Strategic decisions determine
Strategic Decision Models
331
the industries in which a company participates,
DEMO these industries, in turn, affect the objective
criteria relevant in strategic decisions.
In addition, Spender (1989) argued that execu-
tives are involved in a two-step process. While
the decision process has a rational component,DEMO
a process of judgement is used to deal with
uncertainty. He argued that judgement intervenes
in the proposed causal model that links the
executives' objective situation to their decisions.
Under conditions of uncertainty and information
deficiency, executives interpret and add to the
available objective data in order to DEMO
decisions. Often, the burdens and risks of
exercising judgement cause executives DEMO draw
their primary support from other executives
operating in the same industry. These executives
do not seek detailed or prescriptive formulae
because they know DEMO organizations in the
same industries are in different circumstances.
However, executives 'adopt a way of looking at
their situations that are widely shared DEMO
their industry' (p. 188). Spender (1989) labeled
this pattern of judgements the industry's 'recipe'.
An industry recipe is similar to the concepts of
managerial dominant logic (Prahalad and Bettis,
1986) and managerial mind sets (decision-making
orientations) based on a firm's center of gravity
(Galbraith, 1983). Supportive of Spender's argu-
DEMO, Finkelstein (1988) found that industry
moderated the managerial orientation-strategy
relationship. DEMO arguments lead to the follow-
ing hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2b: Industry DEMO the
relationship between objective criteria and the
strategic evaluation of acquisition candidates.
Both the rational normative and external
control models largely reduce the decision DEMO
ing strategic moves to one of mechanics ignoring
the 'human actors'DEMO While both of these schools
of thought have merits as evidenced by the
preceding hypotheses, ignoring the human
element in strategic decisions can lead to inaccu-
rate predictions by the models. Therefore, to
develop a nWore comprehensive and accurate
understanding of strategic decisions, we incorpo-
rate the upper echelons perspective of strategic
choice.
STRATEGIC CHOICE
Child (1972) suggested that DEMO managers make
strategic choices. That is, they make decisions
regarding the DEMO, domains, technologies and
structure of a firm. Keats and Hitt (DEMO) argue
that this perspective suggests that organizations
select and interpret their DEMO, respond
to those elements that are fixed, and attempt to
shape the remaining elements to their advantage.
Hambrick and Mason (1984) and DEMO
(1984) emphasize that executives' strategic cho-
ices should be viewed DEMO to include not only
variables normally associated with strategy (e.g.
domain DEMO) but also those associated
with its implementation (e.g. reward systems).
Regardless of the extent of strategic choice, these
theorists reject the purely deterministic view of
the behavior of organizations taken by some
organization theorists DEMO industrial organization
economists. They also qualify the assumption of
objectivity associated with the classical normative
model of strategic choice.
Some of the early theorists (e.g. Andrews,
1971; Child, 1972) who proferred the rational or
classical models of strategic decision-making
recognized that perceptual and evaluational pro-
cesses DEMO managers played a role in strategic
decisions. More recently, others have DEMO
the link between top management characteristics
and perceptions, objective decision criteria DEMO
strategic choice (Finkelstein, 1988; Hambrick
and Mason, 1984; Schwenk, 1984, 1986). The
theoretical arguments proposed are based on an
extensive literature that has accumulated in the
area of behavioral decision theory (Sebora, Crant
and Shank, 1990; Walsh, 1989). Research prior
to DEMO advent of behavioral decision theory
assumed that rational economic actors maximize
their utility based on full, complete, and perfect
information. Behavioral decision research DEMO
gests that people violate the rational normative
utility-maximizing model (Sebora, Crant and
Shank, 1990).
Much of the work integrating behavioral
decision theory into the strategic decision-
making literature has been based on early notions
DEMO Tversky and Kahneman (1973, 1974, 1981).
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and Slovic,
Fischhoff and Lichtenstein (1977) stated that
when faced with uncertain, complex and/or ill-
structured problems (e.g. strategic DEMO),
332
M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler
individuals develop and use DEMO to simplify
the decision process. Most recent research has
demonstrated that human cognitive processes
attempt to reduce cognitive effort through the
use of heuristics DEMO may create systematic
biases (Barnes, 1984; Kahneman and Tversky,
DEMO, 1987; Schwenk, 1984, 1986, 1988). By
using heuristics, decision-makers can make fairly
accurate interpretations and evaluations without
having to examine DEMO available information
(Nisbett and Ross, 1980; Starbuck and Milliken,
DEMO). The literature in management and cogni-
tive psychology suggests that individuals use these
heuristics or cognitive models to integrate pieces
of information into DEMO single judgement in making
decisions (e.g. Hitt and Middlemist, 1979; DEMO
Crimmon and Taylor, 1976; March and Simon,
1958).
Schwenk (1984) suggested that individual
characteristics affect the heuristics and cognitive
maps DEMO to make strategic decisions, and
proposed three variable categories of individual
DEMO: cognitive style, demographic factors,
and personality traits (Schwenk, 1988). Upper
echelons theory, proposed by Hambrick and
Mason (1984), DEMO argues that strategic
choices have a large behavioral component and
reflect the idiosyncrasies of top executives'
cognitive bases and values. Hambrick and Mason
(1984) argued that, while decision-makers are
exposed to an ongoing stream DEMO potential stimuli,
these cognitive bases and values filter and distort
the decision-maker's perceptions, and thereby
affect strategic choice. They argued, further, that
observable demographic characteristics of top
executives could be used to infer DEMO
cognitive bases and values, and that 'straightfor-
ward demographic data on managers may be
potent predictors of strategies' (p. 205). The
DEMO that they chose to develop included
age, functional tracks, career experiences, edu-
cation, socioeconomic roots, financial position,
and group characteristics.
Work by behavioral decision theorists and
strategists (e.g. Hambrick and Mason, 1984;DEMO
Schwenk, 1984, 1988; Walsh, 1989), therefore,
suggests that executives do not follow a totally
rational model in making strategic decisions.
DEMO, they may not interpret industry
information correctly or utilize all relevant DEMO
available information. Thus, introduction of
human choice into strategic decisions alters DEMO
strategic decision process. More specifically,
Duhaime and Schwenk (1985) suggested that a
number of specific simplifying processes may be
used in acquisition DEMO divestment decisions.
Because individuals approach complex
decisions with previously constructed heuristics
or cognitive models that are reflected in personal
characteristics, the following hypothesis was
developed:
Hypothesis 3a: Executives' personal charac-
teristics explain a significant DEMO of variance
(main effects) in the strategic evaluation of
acquisition candidates, above and beyond the
variance explained by other variables.
Hitt and Barr (1989) found that managers
approach ill-structured decisions with complex
and differentiated DEMO models. That is, the
criteria used and their weightings may vary DEMO
the cognitive model used. As noted earlier,
Hambrick and Mason (DEMO) proposed several
personal characteristics of upper echelon execu-
tives that are DEMO to affect strategic choices.
Additionally, Hambrick and Mason (1984) argued
DEMO the interactions between situational and
demographic variables should be examined to
increase the understanding of the effects of
demographic characteristics of top managers on
DEMO processes. In this study several personal
characterstics-age, level of education, edu-
cational background, total years of work experi-
ence, functional experience, level in the firm (in
relation to CEO), cognitive complexity, and DEMO
propensity-were examined.
Age
Hambrick and Mason (1984) proposed that an
executive's age affects strategic decisions; for
example, younger managers pursue riskier DEMO
egies. Additionally, they speculated that firms
with younger managers experience greater DEMO
and variability in performance. While age effects
may overlap with risk propensity, the effects may
be broader. For example, Hitt and Barr (1989)
found managers' ages affected compensation
decisions. Specifically, younger managers were
DEMO willing to pay higher salaries to executives.
This may be due to evaluations of greater value
as opposed to a riskier posture. Ireland et DEMO
(1987) suggested that individuals of similar age
have similar life experiences and potentially
similar values and beliefs stored as DEMO As
a result they suggest that younger managers may
place greater value on participative management
than do older managers. Research by Schuman
and Scott (1989) supports the contention that the
generational character created by the events
experienced by a cohort during its youth exerts
an important influence on DEMO attitudes. They
found that memories of important political events
and social changes were structured by age, and
that adolescence and early adulthood was the
primary period for generational imprinting.
Thus, younger managers might not only evalu-
ate riskier acquisition candidates more highly
(exhibit, more willingness to take DEMO risks)
but also use and weight criteria differently than
older managers (e.g. criteria related to growth
and type of managerial talent valued) DEMO to
the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3b: An executive's age DEMO
the relationship between objective criteria and
strategic evaluation of acquisition candidates.
Educational background
Hambrick and Mason (1984) suggested that
executives' educational background provides an
indication of their knowledge and skill base. Not
only the amount DEMO also the type of education
are relevant. The type and amount of education
one chooses serve as indicators of her or his
values and DEMO preferences. Thus, based
on personal values, cognitive preferences and
specialized education, we might expect those with
formal education in engineering to utilize different
cognitive models in making decisions than those
with formal education in liberal DEMO or business
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984).
Hitt and Barr (DEMO) found that managers with
higher levels of formal education made different
DEMO compensation decisions from those
with less formal education. Hambrick and Mason
(DEMO) hypothesized that there is a positive
relationship between amount of managers' formal
education and a firm's innovation. That is,
highly educated DEMO are more favorably
predisposed toward, and more likely to promote,
DEMO Furthermore, they proposed that
firms having top managers with less formal
DEMO experience more variability in perform-
Strategic Decision Models
ance. We may speculate that those with less
formal education have greater variance in their
cognitive DEMO because these models are
partially the product of more general educational
training. As the education level increases, training
experiences and paradigmatic perspectives
become more specialized and focused, thereby
creating greater conformity in cognitive models.
Thus, DEMO may conclude that amount and type of
formal education affect the cognitive models
developed and thereby the strategic choices
made. As a result, the following hypotheses were
developed:
Hypothesis 3c: An executive's educational
degree type moderates the relationship between
objective criteria and the strategic evaluation of
DEMO candidates.
Hypothesis 3d: An executive's level of edu-
cation moderates DEMO relationship between objec-
tive criteria and the strategic evaluation of
acquisition candidates.
Experience
Both the amount and type of work experience
are important. The DEMO of one's experience
may affect the strategic choices made and the
models/processes used in making those decisions.
Hitt and Barr (1989), for example, found that
more experienced managers differ from less
experienced managers in decisions regarding
compensation of other executives. Additionally,
Fredrickson (1985) DEMO that the decision
processes of experienced managers differ mark-
edly from those used by inexperienced managers
in making the same strategic decision. Experience
allows DEMO to test and 'fine-tune' a cognitive
model that produces more successful decisions.
Less experienced managers are more naive
(Fredrickson, 1985) and do not have the benefit
of knowledge based on the outcomes of multiple
DEMO decisions. Thius, executives' cognitive models
are based partially on their career experiences
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984).
The type of experience (e.g. function) also may
affect one's cognitive framework and strategic
choices. Hitt, Ireland and Palia (1982), Hitt,
Ireland and Stadter (1982) and Hitt and Ireland
(1985, 1986) found relationships between impor-
DEMO placed on certain functions (distinctive
competencies), strategy and performance. Smith
DEMO
334
M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler
and White (1987) DEMO a relationship between
a firm's strategy and the career specialization of
top executives. This implies that knowledge and
expertise in certain functions may DEMO related to
executives' choices of strategy and resulting
performance. Dearborn and DEMO (1958) found
that executives defined problems largely in terms
of the goals and tasks in their respective functional
areas. However, Walsh (1988) disputed Dearborn
and Simon's (1958) findings. He found that
managers DEMO different functional experience did
not develop different belief structures. On the
other hand, Hambrick and Mason (1984) pro-
posed a more complex alignment. They suggested
that individuals in different groups of functions
develop distinctly different DEMO to the
firm and its environment. Furthermore, they
suggested grouping functional DEMO into
output and throughput functions and those not
integrally involved in the organization's core
activities (e.g. law and finance).
We suspect that the relationship between type
of experience and strategic decisions may be
more DEMO than suggested by previous work.
For example, Walsh's (1988) DEMO seemed to
be dominated by middle managers in mid-careers.
The average age was 38; 80 percent earned less
than $50,000 annually (in DEMO) and all were
enrolled in a two-year, part-time executive MBA
program. While this in no way invalidates his
results, they may not be totally generalizable
to top executives. Top executives often have
experience in multiple DEMO, although they
may have dominant experience in one or two.
Thus, their experience may be broader and richer
for strategic decision-making. Additionally, the
type and weighting of those experiences may well
have helped shape a DEMO model used
for making strategic decisions. Thus, while
distinctions between experience DEMO separate func-
tions may be inappropriate, different combi-
nations of functional DEMO may affect
strategic choices and the criteria on which they
are based. As a result the following hypotheses
were formulated:
Hypothesis 3e: The total amount of work
experience possessed by an executive moderates
the relationship DEMO objective criteria and
the strategic evaluation of acquisition candi-
dates.
Hypothesis 3f: The combination of different
functional experiences possessed by an executive
moderates the relationship between objective
criteria and the strategic evaluation of acqui-
sition candidates.
DEMO of executive
Ireland et al. (1987) found that strategic decision
processes varied by the managers' level in the
firm. They found, for DEMO, that managers at
different levels had distinctly different perceptions
of the DEMO's strengths and weaknesses and of
environmental uncertainty. They speculated that
part of the reason for these differences related
to different decision models based DEMO the
availability heuristic. According to Tversky and
Kahneman (1973), people DEMO make decisions
by using information that can be easily recalled
(e.g. DEMO information). The type and amount
of information available for strategic decisions
may vary by level. However, since Ireland et al.
(1987) examined the differences in top, middle,
and lower level executives and the current study
focused on top executives (i.e. vice presidents
and above), less differentiation may be expected
in this study.
However, Hambrick and Mason (1984) pro-
posed that managerial aspirations (and thus
strategic decisions) DEMO vary based on the
proportion of managers' income tied to the
DEMO of a firm. Many incentive compen-
sation plans closely link top executives' compen-
sation to performance. A larger proportion of
the CEO's total compensation is linked to
performance than top executives below the CEO.
Hoskisson, Hitt and Hill (1989b) found that
differences in incentive compensation affected
DEMO criteria executives used to make strategic
decisions. Thus, executives below the DEMO may
use different models (than the CEO) to make
strategic decisions because of the criteria con-
tained in executive incentive compensation plans.
As DEMO result we may speculate that criteria on
which strategic choices are based may differ by
the level of the executive (below the CEO),DEMO
because of information availability and differences
in incentive compensation (strategic controls)DEMO
Thus, executive level serves as a proxy for
differences in information DEMO and in
incentive compensation. These conclusions result
in the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3g: An executives' level (CEO
and below) moderates the DEMO between
objective criteria and the strategic evaluation of
acquisition candidates.
Although Hambrick and Mason (1984) advo-
cated the use of observable executive character-
DEMO in studies of upper echelons theory, they
acknowledged that the progress DEMO this research
stream could not go far without consideration
of the psychological and social psychological
characteristics that are represented by some
demographic characteristics. Schwenk (1988) sug-
gested that cognitive styles and personality
characteristics represent two additional categories
of variables that reflect individual differences.
One of the cognitive style DEMO that has
received attention in decision-making research is
cognitive complexity. In addition, it can be
argued that risk propensity, a personality charac-
teristic, may greatly affect strategic decision
processes.
Cognitive complexity
Schneier (1979) argued DEMO cognitive complexity
was originally conceived as a variable that denotes
the structural complexity of an individual's
cognitive system. Psychological researchers pro-
pose that DEMO number of constructs that a person
uses in constructing a social perception provides
evidence of structural complexity. Biere (1961)
argued that cognitive complexity is an ability to
differentiate the behavior of other individuals
along a DEMO of personal constructs. Individuals
with relatively complex cognitive systems have a
greater number of personal constructs along
which to differentiate behavior in others than DEMO
those with relatively simple cognitive systems.
The degree of complexity has been used to
predict how specific behavioral information is
transformed into social or DEMO judgements
(i.e. Bonarius, 1965).
We can reasonably expect most top executives
to have certain minimum levels of cognitive
complexity, given the array of factors that they
must consider to fulfill their job responsibilities.
Top DEMO must deal with an incredible array
of problems and most strategic decisions are
quite complex. In addition to greater complexity,
Walsh (1988) DEMO that managers' belief struc-
tures utilized for ill-structured problems were
Strategic DEMO Models
more complex than previous authors suggested.
Thus, the cognitive structural DEMO of even
top managers may be taxed.
Hambrick and Finkelstein (1987) argued that
a manager's discretion is constrained to some
extent by DEMO or her ability to perceive options and
simultaneously to process information regarding
competing alternatives. They concluded that
managers with greater cognitive complexity will
have DEMO discretion in strategic choices
because they are aware of more alternatives and
are able to differentiate between a larger number
of dimensions.
Downey and DEMO (1982) found cognitive
complexity to moderate the relationship between
perceived environmental uncertainty and mana-
gerial performance. In other words, individuals'
cognitive abilities affected the manner in which
they perceived that uncertainty in the environ-
DEMO affected their performance. Therefore, the
effects of cognitive complexity relate to DEMO
processing of information. As a result, it affects
the number and DEMO (complex) of criteria and
alternatives evaluated in the decision. This leads
to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3h: An executive's cognitive com-
plexity moderates the relationship between
objective criteria and strategic evaluation of
acquisition DEMO
Risk orientation
Much has been written about risk and strategic
decisions. In particular, recent strategic manage-
ment research focused on the relationship
between risk and performance (e.g. Aaker and
Jacobson, 1987; Amit and Livnat, DEMO; Barton,
1988; Fiegenbaum and Thomas, 1988; Singh,
1986). Most have assumed rationality in strategic
choices. However, there is a controversy regard-
ing the relationship between a firm's risk and
return (Bowman, 1982, 1984). Fiegenbaum and
Thomas (1988) found that DEMO relationship
between risk and return can be either positive
or negative. Their results supported prospect
theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Laugh-
hunn, DEMO and Crum, 1980) which suggests
that poor performance leads executives to take
higher risks. Baird and Thomas (1985) argued
that the relationship DEMO strategic risk-taking
and performance is quite complex.
335
336 M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler
One reason for this DEMO is that strategic
decisions are made by and filtered through
executives. As a result, strategic decisions may
be partially affected by the managers' DEMO
propensity toward risk (Baird and Thomas, 1985).
For example, DEMO (1965) suggested that
those who have a higher propensity to take risks
are likely to choose more uncertain decision
alternatives. However, others argue that individ-
uals may adopt a mixture of risk-seeking and
risk-averse behaviors (Fiegenbaum and Thomas,
1988; Siegel, 1957). Sitkin, Pablo and Jemison
(1990) suggested that a firm's risk perceptions
and risk DEMO affect merger decision pro-
cesses. Top executives perceive the risk, and
DEMO risk orientations strongly influence the firm's
orientation. While Gupta (1984) argued that top
executives exhibit a greater willingness to take
risks than DEMO general population, Gupta and
Govindarajan (1984) found top executives' risk
propensity to vary. They found that executives
who had a higher tolerance DEMO ambiguity
exhibit a greater willingness to take risks. While
acquisition decisions often involve considerable
ambiguity, the resulting decision may vary some-
what by acquiring firm's executives' risk propen-
sity. Kogan and Wallach (1964) found that
individuals with a lower risk propensity used a
broader categorization of DEMO in decisions,
whereas those with higher risk propensities used
a narrower categorization scheme. Furthermore,
not only the number but the type of DEMO may
vary in these categorization schemes. Therefore,
an executive's risk orientation may affect the type
of criteria used to evaluate strategic alternatives.
DEMO arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3i: An executive'DEMO risk propensity
moderates the relationship between objective
criteria and strategic evaluation of acquisition
candidates.
METHOD
Sample
Data were obtained through a survey instrument
mailed DEMO 122 top executives (chosen randomly
using a random-number generator from a DEMO of
950 top executives in the southwest United
States). Each executive was contacted by tele-
phone and asked to participate in the study.
DEMO phone calls to nonrespondents were
used to ensure a strong response rate. A total
of 69 responses were returned, for a 57 percent
response rate. Four of the responses had missing
data on at least one DEMO the instruments for a
usable sample of 65. The levels (title) and
industries of executive respondents and their firms
were compared to those DEMO the nonrespondents
(including those declining to participate). The
results suggested DEMO systematic differences
between the groups. For example, the percentages
of respondents DEMO nonrespondents by level were
almost identical (President/CEO-respondents 33
percent, nonrespondents 34 percent; executive
or senior vice president-respondents 22 percent,
nonrespondents 22 percent; vice president-
respondents 45 percent, nonrespondents 44
percent). Comparison DEMO industry showed a
slightly higher nonresponse rate from service
firms. However, DEMO analysis of data from
initial or follow-up contacts showed that a number
of the nonresponses (or declines) in service
industries were in highly DEMO services (e.g.
galleries, commodity exchange) or were individ-
uals not DEMO part of the top management team (e.g.
some vice-presidents in financial DEMO).
Therefore, they were not appropriate for this
study. As a DEMO we concluded there was no
effective nonresponse bias.
The average age of the respondents was 47,
with an average of 24 years of DEMO work
experience. The respondents' position ranged
from vice-president to CEO with DEMO mean
position one level below the CEO (e.g. president
and COO)DEMO The firms represented a variety of
industries (20 different two-digit SIC DEMO)
including manufacturing (consumer goods, pro-
ducer goods, capital goods) and services (e.g.
financial and professional services). The average
firm size was $550 million in annual sales.
Instrument
The instrument contained four parts DEMO
30 cases with potential acquisition candidates
described through 15 objective criteria, DEMO measure
of risk propensity, a measure of cognitive
complexity and a DEMO of questions regarding
individual respondent and firm characteristics
(demographics). The DEMO of the components in
the instruments sent to executives was randomly
determined to control for potential order effects.
Strategic Decision Models
337
As noted earlier, industry may affect strategic
decisions (e.g. Dess, Ireland and Hitt, 1990).
Thus, industry was DEMO in examining the
main effects of the other variables.
Objecti've
criteria
The study examines executives' strategic decision-
making. The type of decision chosen for exami-
nation involved the evaluation of firms targeted
for acquisition. The DEMO criteria on which
to evaluate target firms were developed through
a survey of the literature and recommendations
from academic 'experts'. Five academicians
knowledgeable of the strategy and mergers and
acquisitions literature were requested to identify
DEMO used by executives to evaluate target
firms and make acquisition decisions. Basd on
the 'experts' recommendations and the literature
review, 15 objective criteria were identified. The
goal of the development process was to identify
all DEMO important criteria while maintaining
a 'manageable' list for case development. The
target firm criteria chosen include level of
diversification, market share in firm's primary
industry, annual sales, return on investment,
stock price, anticipated discounted cash flow,
projected new products/services to be developed
DEMO the next 5 years, projected demand for
products/services over the DEMO 5 years, level of
management talent, capabilities in marketing,
capabilities in manufacturing, capabilities in
R&D, attractiveness of the firm's DEMO indus-
try, degree of synergy with acquiring firm, and
acquisition price. These objective criteria were
used to develop 30 cases on target firms DEMO
described later.
Risk propensity
Executives' propensity to take risks was measured
DEMO the Job Preference Inventory (Williams,
1965). The inventory consists DEMO eight pairs of
descriptive statements regarding a job. The
respondent is asked to choose the statement
which describes the job s/he would most DEMO
The statements describing a 'risky' job are scored
1 and statements describing a job with little or
no risk are scored as 0. DEMO (1965) found
the reproducibility coefficients to range from 0.83
to 0.90. Further, studies found the scale to be
highly and positively (rank DEMO correlations
ranging from 0.85 to 0.96) related to favorable
perceptions of DEMO in job activities providing
evidence of validity for the scale. The internal
reliability (coefficient alpha) for the scale in this
study was 0.66.
DEMO complexity
Cognitive complexity was measured using an
instrument developed by Bieri et al. (1966),
modified by Vannoy (1965) and validated by
DEMO (1979). Essentially the instrument
involves a 10 x 10 grid DEMO the respondent
is asked to evaluate 10 specific persons (e.g.
boss, person who respondent dislikes, etc.)
including him/herself on 10 bipolar adjectives
using a six-point scale (for a total of 100 ratings).
The higher the score, the more cognitively simple
the person because she/he is using similar
constructs to describe each person. A person who
DEMO more cognitively complex (lowwer score) uses
the constructs differently in discriminating among
people. Schneier (1979) found the instrument to
have a test-retest DEMO of 0.54 (p < 0.01)
for a sample of students DEMO 0.82 (p < 0.01)
for a sample of managers. Schneier DEMO found
evidence of both convergent and discriminant
validity for the instrument.
Demographic characteristics
A number of individual and firm characteristics
were measured. The respondents' chronological
age was requested. Amount of education was
measured on a five-point DEMO ranging from high
school to a Ph.D. (high school, some college,
bachelors degree, masters degree, Ph.D.).
Additionally, the respondents were requested to
denote the major area of study if they held a
DEMO degree (e.g. accounting, engineering,
liberal arts, etc.). Type DEMO education (major area
of study) was coded as a dummy variable.
Respondents were asked to denote the industry
representing the greatest percentage of DEMO firm
sales. This information was used to help classify
the firm into the correct two-digit SIC code. For
analytical purposes (e.g. testing hypotheses), the
firms were further classified into one of six
categories including consumer DEMO (manu-
facturers), capital goods, producer goods, finan-
cial services, professional services and other.
The sample was distributed across the industry
338
M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler
categories in the following DEMO: consumer
goods (7), producer goods (19), capital goods
(10), financial services (8), professional services
(16), other (5). The other category is composed
of firms that could not DEMO classified in one of
the other five categories. Industry was then coded
as a dummy variable.
In addition to the title of the current DEMO,
the respondents provided the number of levels
between them and the CEO (0= CEO). They
also provided the chronological number of total
years of professional work experience.
Finally two measures of functional experience
were DEMO Respondents were asked to
denote whether they had work experience in one
or more of the functional areas (accounting,
engineering, finance, marketing, management,
R&D, personnel, production/manufacturing,
purchasing) or DEMO areas. Each was coded as
a dummy variable (1 = experience, 0 = no
experience). The respondents also provided the
number of DEMO experience in each function
(to the extent that such experience could DEMO
specifically identified). Our sample was composed
of top executives, many DEMO whom had general
manager experience for a number of years.
As such, they had responsibility for multiple
functional areas in the same job. Therefore,
our sample of top executives had broad and
overlapping experience. As DEMO result our measure
of type of work experience is more complex than
has been examined in past studies (e.g. Walsh,
1988). These data presented no problem for
examining general main effects for personal
characteristics DEMO we did not hypothesize
specific main effects for each separate character-
istic. However, to test for the moderating effects
of work experience we needed to examine the
combination of experience across functional
areas. It would not DEMO realistic or appropriate to
examine the effects of experience in each
functional area separately because of their inter-
dependence. While we expected most top DEMO
tives to have a broad experience base, we were
interested in DEMO whether the strategic
decision models of those with somewhat more
specialized experience differed from the others.
Therefore, a clustering technique was used
to differentiate group executives with similar
backgrounds. The clustering procedure used an
iterative algorithm DEMO minimizing the sum of the
squared distances from the cluster means. As a
result it allowed the determination of groups with
the highest within-group DEMO and the
greatest between-group differences (process used
to delineate the six DEMO). Thus, to examine
moderating effects of type of experience, respon-
dents were clustered according to the type and
number of years of DEMO experience.
The cluster analysis produced six distinct
clusters. However, the results DEMO showed that
many of the respondents had similar backgrounds
(as expected DEMO top executives with significant
general manager experience). The first cluster
contained 47 respondents and represented those
with a broad base of experience with DEMO
experience in each of the functional areas (broad-
based experience cluster)DEMO The remaining clusters
(except four and six) while having multifunctional
emphases, were also more specialized, each in
different ways. Cluster two included DEMO with
a fairly broad base of experience but no
experience in finance or personnel (business and
technical cluster). Cluster three includes those
with heavy experience in finance, marketing,
management and personnel but no technical
experience (core business cluster). Clusters four
and six represent one respondent each who has
significant experience in engineering combined
with other experience that DEMO them
significantly from other respondents (technical
clusters). These clusters were DEMO from
further analysis. Cluster five respondents had
dominant experience in engineering, DEMO
and production but little or no other business
functional experience (technical DEMO
cluster). For purposes of the moderated
regression analyses, this variable DEMO coded as a
dummy variable.
Size of the firm was used as a control variable.
In particular, firm size might affect the emphasis
on specific criteria. Thus, to ensure that other
effects examined were not contaminated by firm
size, it was controlled in the primary analyses.
Firm size was measured using total annual firm
sales and total number of employees.
DEMO models
The procedure known as policy capturing (Slovic
and Lichtenstein, 1971; Hobson and Gibson,
1983) was used to obtain and analyze DEMO data.
Such a procedure has been used in past research
to model managers' decision processes (e.g.
Strategic Decision Models
339
Ireland et al., 1987). The method is similar to a
repeated-measures design and allows assessment
of what Argyris and DEMO (1974) described as
'theories in use' as opposed to 'DEMO theories
of action.' Hitt and Middlemist (1979) conducted
post hoc DEMO with superiors of the managers
in their study, revealing that the DEMO
models accurately represented actual decision-
making behavior, providing support for the
DEMO validity of the procedure.
For this study 30 cases were constructed by
randomly varying the level of each of the 15
target firm characteristics (criteria) on a scale of
one (low) to five (high) across the cases (a sample
case is shown in the Appendix). The random
assignment of criteria levels controlled for poten-
tial collinearity among DEMO independent variables.
The highest r between any pair of criteria was
0.37 for a common variance of less than 14
percent.
Executives were asked DEMO examine each case
describing a target firm on the basis of the 15
criteria and rate the attractiveness of the target
firm as an DEMO candidate (on a one to
seven scale) and rate the probability that this
firm would be acquired (on a one to seven scale).
The coefficient alpha for the scale combining
these two questions was DEMO This combined
scale represented the dependent variable.
Each manager evaluated 30 target firms yielding
a sample size of 30 x 65 or 1950 observations.
DEMO assumption of independence between each
of the respondent's 30 observations is consistent
with a within-subjects, repeated-measures design
(Wiiier, 1974). Precedent exists for the assump-
tion that each case represents an independent
observation (Hitt and Middlemist, 1979; Hitt et
al., 1983; Stewart and Gelberd, 1972). To check
on the independence of the observations, we
examined the possibility of serial correlation
among within-person observations (only the
objective criteria varied in the within-person
observations-personal demographics and indus-
try represent between-person effects)DEMO We used
a common procedure to block within-person
variance (dummy variables DEMO each respondent)
and examined the remaining (between-person)
variance explained DEMO the objective criteria.
Using hierarchical regression analysis we found
the objective criteria to explain slightly over 30
percent of the variance (model R2 > 0.40) in the
strategic decisions beyond the control variables
(individual dummy DEMO had an R2 = 0.085).
These results suggest that the data are relatively
free of serial correlation (within respondents)
and support the independence of individual
observations.
Pilot study
A pilot study was conducted with DEMO
involved in a 4-week development program to
evaluate the use of the instruments. The execu-
tives required a minimum of 30 minutes and
maximum DEMO 1 hour to complete all parts of
the instrument. The data were analyzed and
individual results were provided to and discussed
with each executive. DEMO exercise suggested that
the cases were viable and criteria used were
inclusive of those felt important by the executives.
Furthermore, the feedback provided guidance
regarding the type of instructions necessary for
executives to accurately complete the DEMO
RESULTS
The intercorrelation matrices are presented in
Tables 1 and 2. The data were aggregated and
Hypotheses 1, 2a and 3a were analyzed using
hierarchical regression. To control for the effects
of firm size, annual firm sales (sales and number
of employees were highly correlated) was entered
DEMO each regression model. The results of these
analyses are shown in Table 3. The differences
in R2 were tested using a procedure recommended
by DEMO (1968) which accounts for the degrees
of freedom.
As shown in Table 3, Hypotheses 1, 2a and
3a were all supported. The DEMO also shows that
the main effects for objective criteria were by
far the strongest. In Model 1, industry, personal
characteristics, and firm sales accounted for
slightly over 7 percent of the variance in
evaluation of DEMO firms. However, addition of
the objective criteria to the model added DEMO
33 percent to the explained variance. This
provides strong support for Hypothesis 1.
The addition of industry variables to the
hierarchical regression model (Model 2) increased
the R2 by 0.022. This change was statistically
significant and thus Hypothesis 2a was supported.
The addition of personal characteristics to the
DEMO regression model increased the vari-
ance explained by almost 3 percent. The change

was statistically significant, thereby providing
support for Hypothesis 3a.
Hypotheses 2b and 3b-3i were tested using
moderated regression analysis. This DEMO of
analysis yields a conservative estimate of the
moderating effects of one variable (e.g.
industry-Hypothesis 2b) on the relationship
between two or more DEMO variables (in this
case, objective criteria and the evaluation of
target firms) (Darrow and Kahl, 1983). Thus, in
this study, these analyses test the effects variables
have on executives' acquisition decision models.
The same method used for the hierarchical
regression analyses (Cohen, 1968) was used to
test the change in R2 between the restricted (main
effects) and full models (main and interaction
effects). The results DEMO these analyses are pre-
sented in Table 4.
As shown, six DEMO the nine moderated regression
results produced statistically significant changes in
R2. Industry (categories), age, type of education,
amount of work experience, type of work
experience and level of the executive were found
to DEMO statistically significant moderators of the
relationship between objective criteria and evalu-
ations of target firms; thereby providing support
for Hypotheses 2b, 3b, 3c, 3e, 3f and 3g.
An executive's cognitive complexity, level of
education and risk orientation were not found to
be statistically significant moderators. DEMO, no
support was found for Hypotheses 3d, 3h and
3i. These results suggest that the industry in
which a firm competes, executives' DEMO, type of
education, amount and type of experience and
organizational level tend to affect their strategic
decision models. As might be expected, age
and amount of work experience were highly
correlated, with a r = 0.97. Because of this
collinearity, further analyses were conducted in
an attempt to examine their true independent
effects. We partitioned the variance explained by
DEMO variable in moderated regression models.
The results showed that neither age nor amount
of work experience explained a statistically
significant amount of variance beyond DEMO other
in these analyses. As a result, an age/work
experience DEMO was created by standardizing (z
score) each and obtaining a mean of the two sets
of standardized scores for each respondent. Next,
DEMO moderated regression analysis was conducted
using this index as the moderator. As shown in
Table 4, age/work experience index is a statisti-
cally significant moderator (at p < 0.01).
To examine how each of the moderating
variables tended to affect executive strategic
decision models, further regression models were
developed for each category (e.g. different type
of industry) DEMO moderating effects were found.
While interesting, these stepwise regression mod-
els DEMO not presented because they are beyond
the scope of this article. However, these results
may be obtained from the authors.
DISCUSSION
The results showed that elements of the rational
normative, external control, and strategic choice
DEMO of strategic decision-making are
operative. Additionally, the research suggests
that objective DEMO play a prominent role in
executives' strategic decision models. However,
DEMO and executive characteristics also pro-
duced statistically significant but small main effects
on strategic decisions, as well as moderating
effects on the criteria used in those decisions.
While the effects are not large, these findings
appear relevant, considering the conservative
nature of the test used. Therefore, the DEMO
suggests that strategic decisions cannot be accu-
rately modeled with one perspective alone. The
results support Fredrickson's (1985) conclusion
that executives' approaches to strategic decisions
were simultaneously rational and intuitive.
The dominance of the DEMO criteria in
executives' strategic decision models provides
strong support for the DEMO strategic choice
perspective. Almost 82 percent of the total
explained variance in executives' strategic
decisions was attributed to objective criteria.
These results suggest that a rational analytical
approach dominates strategic decision processes.
Additionally, these results are very similar to
those of Rumelt (1991) when he partitioned the
DEMO variance in performance among FTC Line
of Business reporting units into industry factors,
time factors, corporate factors, and business-
specific factors. He DEMO that stable business
effects were six times as important as stable
industry effects in explaining the dispersion of
rate of returns. This suggests that DEMO of
business units differ from one another within
industries to a much greater extent than industries

impediments to the long-term rates of return are
associated with unique endowments, positions,
and strategies of individual businesses.
Interestingly, however, such a rational
approach to strategic decisions is supposed
to DEMO for environmental conditions, yet
industry contributed a statistically significant but
small DEMO to the explained variance above
and beyond that which was explained by other
variables examined. The results support those of
Rumelt (1989), who found small but stable effects
of industry on firm performance. These results
DEMO support for the influence of the external
control perspective. Thus, we DEMO conclude
that the strategic decision process may be, at
least, partially deterministic. Perhaps even more
importantly, however, the results suggest that
the DEMO criteria used in making strategic
decisions may vary by industry. The results
suggest, then, that industry has both direct
Strategic Decision Models
345
and moderating effects on executives' strategic
decisions. Thus, industry characteristics may
contribute to the development of managerial
orientations in the form of an industry recipe
(Spender, 1989). Over time, experience in an
industry may focus an executive's attention on
certain criteria DEMO ignoring others (Starbuck
and Milliken, 1988). Therefore, executives evalu-
DEMO target firms place emphasis on criteria
important in their firm's as well as the target
firm's primary industry. The results support the
DEMO (1984) conclusion that a reciprocal
interdependence exists between industry and
strategic decisions.
The results also provide some support for
Hambrick and Mason's (1984) upper echelons
theory. Essentially, the results suggest that
executives matter DEMO and beyond rational
analytical processes and industry characteristics.
Executive characteristics produced main and
moderating effects on strategic decision models.
The results support contentions by DEMO number of
theorists (e.g. Gupta, 1988; Norburn, 1989) that
DEMO accurate understanding of strategic decisions
requires consideration of the effects of executives'
personal characteristics. While the results did not
support fully all contentions DEMO Hambrick and
Mason's (1984) upper echelons theory related to
specific individual characteristics, they denote
effects of executive characteristics on decisions.
Furthermore, DEMO suggest that upper echelons
theory as originally proposed by Hambrick and
Mason may need some refinement.
While this study was not a complete test DEMO
upper echelons theory as proposed by Hambrick
and Mason (1984), DEMO was found for
the effects of executives' age, years of work
experience, functional experience, and type of
education. However, no support was found for
the effects of level of formal education on
strategic decisions (except in selected subgroup
analyses). The results support Tversky and
Kahneman'DEMO (1981) assertions that decision
frames adopted are controlled partially by the
personal characteristics of the decision-maker.
Furthermore, the results suggest that, while DEMO
cognitive simplification occurs (Schwenk, 1984),
executives' strategic decisions are also incredibly
complex. Executives use rational analytic
approaches but their strategic decisions DEMO also
be affected by their firms' industry and their own
personal DEMO
Upper echelons theory may require modifi-
cation to include executive level as a differen-
tiating variable. The results herein focused on
top executives assumed DEMO be a part of the top
management team (TMT) but found differences
in the strategic models by level (in the inclusion
and weighting of several strategic decision
criteria). Of course, the CEO may be considered
the most important executive in the TMT for
strategic decisions. Robbins DEMO Duncan (1988)
argued the importance of CEOs in the creation
DEMO implementation of strategic vision. However,
a CEO's ability to create and implement a
strategic vision could be affected considerably by
the extent DEMO which other members of the TMT
agree with and support that vision. The effects
of executive level on strategic decisions support
current work on DEMO importance of the homoge-
neity/heterogeneity of the TMT (e.g. O'DEMO
and Flatt, 1989).
Additionally, we found that most top executives
are generalists with broad functional experience.
However, even though most executives had a
broad experience base, there were differences in
the combinations of interrelated experiences (we
found four separate clusters after eliminating
two outliers). Furthermore, we found that the
strategic decision models varied across executives
with different combinations of experience. Thus,
the types and effects of experience may DEMO more
complex than previously suggested.
Risk propensity and cognitive complexity were
not found to be universally important as hypothe-
sized. The results do not DEMO rejection of the
importance of risk propensity and cognitive
complexity. However, DEMO should be examined
in conjunction with other characteristics to obtain
a more accurate picture of their effects on
strategic decisions.
We should recognize that DEMO range of cognitive
complexity among individuals narrows consider-
ably as they move up the managerial hierarchy.
Thus, there may not be significant variance
among top executives' cognitive complexity. In
this study, cognitive complexity ranged from DEMO
score of 91 (high complexity) to 279 (low
complexity). DEMO mean score was 130 suggesting
a distribution skewed toward higher complexity.
Risk taking was significantly negatively associ-
ated with age in some early studies (Vroom and
Pahl, 1971; Wallach and Kogen, 1961). However,
it is interesting to note the significant positive
346
M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler
relationship between age, experience, executive
level (CEO = 0), and risk (Table 2) DEMO
top executives to be unique. As the governing
body of an organization, top executives cannot
afford to exhibit the lack of confidence. Thus,
managers that show confidence and ability to
make necessary but risky decisions DEMO the
top executives of an organization. This suggests
a potential range restriction in risk propensity
among top executives. The mean risk propensity
for executives DEMO our sample was 6.5 and the
mode 8 (22 executives had DEMO risk propensity score
of 8), thereby supporting this notion.
Our findings suggest that selection and sociali-
zation processes for top executive positions likely
DEMO the individual differences between execu-
tives. Top management team members may not
differ greatly in individual characteristics (e.g.
experience, risk propersity). These DEMO sug-
gest a further modification of upper echelons
theory. Yet out findings also suggest that the
differences in individual characteristics that do
exist may DEMO affect strategic decisions. Thus,
while the effects may not be as great as originally
proposed, upper echelons theory remains opera-
tive.
Hambrick and Mason (1984) proposed that the
interrelationship among and effects of executive
DEMO are complex and difficult to disen-
tangle. For example, age and DEMO of work
experience are highly interrelated, similar to
previous studies (e.g. Taylor, 1975). Analysis
suggested that the effects of these two factors
are inextricably interwoven and independent
effects of age and amount of work DEMO
may not be able to be isolated. Thus, it may be
DEMO, in future research, to consider the
combined effects of these two factors.
Finally, while Walsh (1989) suggested that
policy capturing has high investigator involve-
ment, this technique may actually be more
realistic for strategic decisions than techniques
used in past decision-making research. Rarely do
top executives DEMO preliminary analyses on
potential acquisitions. Rather staff members or
other managers assimilate and analyze relevant
data and present executives with summary evalu-
ations of DEMO (similar to the procedure in the
present study). As noted DEMO, policy capturing
delineates models that are effective predictors of
managerial decision DEMO (Hitt and Middle-
mist, 1979).
Additionally, the study focused DEMO a strategic
decision of great importance to strategic manage-
ment academicians and practitioners alike. The
1980s have been labeled by some as the decade
DEMO merger mania. We need to understand
better the models on which strategic acquisition
decisions are made. For example, Duhaime and
Schwenk (1985) suggested that the quality of
the acquisition decision process influences the
subsequent success DEMO failure of the resulting
acquisition. The results of this study support
theory and research on acquisition decisions.
Discounted cash flow was one of the DEMO
important predictors (criteria) of acquisition
decision in our subgroup analyses. This supports
Jensen's (1986) contention that cash flow is the
critical DEMO for diversification and acquisition
decisions.
Additionally, Roll's (1986) 'hubris hypothesis'
of corporate takeovers suggested that hubris on
the part of DEMO decision-makers causes
'mistaken estimates of target firm value' (p. 214)DEMO
If the individual bidder/manager is confident that
the market does not reflect the full economic
value of the combined firms, the bid for the
target will be greater than is economically
justifiable. Thus, pride or overconfidence, bol-
stered by past successes, may bias the bid price.
DEMO 'hubris' may be the result of the manager's
personal characteristics.
Given the potential for individual character-
istics to affect strategic evaluations, some may
argue that opportunity exists for managers to act
consciously against shareholder DEMO (Roll,
1986). While agency problems may exist, the
results of this study suggest that executive
effects do not necessarily represent conscious
DEMO behavior. However, it also does
not preclude the potential for managers DEMO act
in their own interests (i.e. utility functions),
which may diverge from shareholders' interests
(Hoskisson et al., 1989a). An application, in
future research, of agency theory to the cognitive
modeling of DEMO decision processes would
be a valuable contribution (Eisenhardt, 1989).
CONCLUSIONS
A review of research related to environment,
strategy, structure, and DEMO revealed
an emphasis on objective measures with a
Strategic Decision Models
347
disproportionate number of studies based on
quantitative data DEMO from the PIMS and
Compustat data bases (Hrebiniak et al., 1988).
Furthermore, Hrebiniak et al. (1988) argued
that 'the skewing DEMO strategy research in this
measurement direction has tended to underrep-
resent the intentional and cognitive aspects of
strategy.' Stubbart (1987) argued that future
research should focus on middle-range synthesis
of cognitive phenomena, linking them to broader
organizational phenomena. In addition, Stubbart
(1987) and Gupta (1988) concluded that future
research should focus on executive behavior. The
methodology employed DEMO this study allowed
us to examine executives' strategic decision
behavior, use the behavioral data to construct
executive strategic decision models and overcome
some DEMO the limitations of previous strategic
decision research as noted by Robey and Taggart
(1983).
This research provides new insights regarding
a potential source of emergent strategy. Rational
processes may dominate the strategy formulation
process, but industry and executive characteristics
may also affect the decision process. These
effects DEMO be further amplified during strategy
implementation and may help explain at least
some of the variance between intended and
emergent strategy. Research related to DEMO effect
of executives and industry on the strategy
implementation process provides a fruitful area
of future investigation.
Much more research is required before any
DEMO conclusions can be reached regarding
the specific effects of individual executive charac-
teristics on strategic decisions. Furthermore, this
study should be replicated with other types
of strategic decisions. However, this research
provides insight into the complex and multifaceted
relationship between the industrial environment,
objective business-level criteria, executive charac-
teristics, and strategic decisions. Elements of
rational normative, external control, and strategic
choice (upper echelons theory) perspectives were
all found to DEMO to the explanation of
strategic decisions. Barnes (1984) argued that
strategic planners must recognize their cognitive
biases and attempt to formulate strategic decisions
DEMO accurately reflect the firm's strategic situ-
ation. Future research should examine more
precise formulations of upper echelons theory
with the purpose of disentangling DEMO complexity
of strategic decisions. Furthermore, future
research should examine the effects DEMO inertia
on strategic decision making (Fredrickson and
laquinto, 1989) and DEMO industry or executive
characteristics contribute to this inertia. Jackofsky
and Slocum (DEMO) argued that, despite the
importance of CEOs, there is a DEMO of
knowledge about them. We expand this concern
to the top management team. The current
research provides a base on which a better
understanding DEMO executive strategic decision-
making may be developed.
