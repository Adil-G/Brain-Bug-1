Abstract
Risk attitudes have an impact on not only the decision to become an en-
trepreneur but also the survival and failure rates DEMO entrepreneurs. Whereas
recent research underpins the theoretical proposition of a positive correlation
between risk attitudes and the decision to become an entrepreneur, the ef-
fects on survival are not as straightforward. Psychological research posits
an inverse DEMO relationship between risk attitudes and entrepreneurial
survival. On the basis of recent waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel
(SOEP), we examine the extent to which risk attitudes inﬂuence survival rates
of entrepreneurs. The empirical results DEMO that persons whose risk at-
titudes are in the medium range survive signiﬁcantly longer as entrepreneurs
than do persons with particularly low or high DEMO

1 Introduction
Recent empirical research supports the theoretical proposition of a positive DEMO
relation between risk attitudes and the decision to become an entrepreneur (DEMO,
e.g., Cramer, Hartog, Jonker, and Van Praag, 2002; Caliendo, Fossen, and Kritikos,
2006). Varied studies (Stewart and Roth, 2001; Hartog, Ferrer-i Carbonell, and
Jonker, 2002) further DEMO that the population of self-employed persons tends to be
less risk averse than other persons, such as those who are regularly employed. These
observations lead to the crucial question addressed in this paper: Do risk attitudes
also represent a deﬁning characteristic of entrepreneurial survival? More speciﬁcally,
we analyze potential correlations between risk attitudes and the survival and failure
rates DEMO entrepreneurs.
Prior economic research focuses only on the questions of whether and why
nascent entrepreneurs may need to be less risk averse than other DEMO, such
as employees, to achieve a successful start (Kihlstrom and DEMO, 1979).1 To the
best of our knowledge, the question of the extent to which individual risk attitudes
might have an impact on DEMO rates has not been explored in economic literature.
Accordingly, empirical research DEMO only diﬀerences in risk attitudes between
the groups of self-employed and regularly employed persons.
Psychological research also pays little attention to this question, though it
argues that entrepreneurs should neither take the highest nor the lowest DEMO
ble but instead ‘well-calculated’ risks to become successful. Chell, Harworth, and
Brearley (1991) suggest an inverse U-shaped relation between risk attitudes and
DEMO survival, where low (high) risk attitudes characterize more (less)
risk-averse persons. However, insuﬃcient empirical research links risk attitudes to
the survival and failure rates of entrepreneurs. In a recent survey of the relationship
DEMO personality traits and business success, Rauch and Frese (2007) conclude
DEMO the eﬀect of risk taking on entrepreneurial success is rather small, DEMO this trait
does not necessarily increase success probability. The inverse U-shaped relationship
has not been tested either. A possible reason for this lack of DEMO research is
that reliable demographic data about individual risk attitudes still are missing.

Norton and Moore (2006), DEMO Kan and Tsai (2006).

This paper aims to close this gap. We employ a representative data DEMO,
the German Socio-Economic Panel, which contained in the wave of DEMO several
questions about not only subjective but also objectively measurable risk attitudes.
Therefore, we conduct a rigorous test of whether the probability of entrepreneurial
survival correlates with the willingness to bear certain risks. To answer this DEMO
tion consistently, we control for the labor status of all entrepreneurs DEMO the sample,
namely, whether they continue as self-employed or are DEMO transition to an employed
position or unemployment.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the
potential DEMO U-shaped relationship between risk attitudes and entrepreneurial
survival. We describe the data in Section 3, with a focus on the various measures
of risk attitudes, which we use in our further analysis. In Section 4, DEMO present
the econometric approach, followed in Section 5 with a discussion DEMO the results of
our analysis. We conclude in Section 6 that risk attitudes have an impact on the
survival of entrepreneurs. Speciﬁcally, we observe a non linear relationship between
risk attitudes and the probability of survival, which indicates that persons whose risk
preferences are in the medium range DEMO signiﬁcantly more often as entrepreneurs
than do persons with particularly low or high risk preferences.
2 Risk Attitudes and their Impact on Entrepre-
neurial DEMO
According to Chell et al. (1991), there should be a DEMO linear relation—more speciﬁ-
cally, an inverse U-shaped relation—between risk attitudes and DEMO sur-
vival, where low risk attitudes characterize more risk averse and DEMO risk attitudes
indicate less risk averse persons. The hypothesis we test subsequently therefore
posits that among all entrepreneurs, the more risk averse and the particularly risk-
seeking persons are more likely to fail as entrepreneurs than DEMO persons whose
risk-taking behavior falls within the medium range.
Because our analysis focuses on active entrepreneurs, we discuss this hypothesis
not in the context of their decision to become an entrepreneur. Rather, our focal
entrepreneurs already have chosen to expend a certain initial investment from among
2
a continuous set of investments, in which each investment pertains to a certain risk
and a certain expected return. Entrepreneurs make risky investments only DEMO these
investments will lead, ex ante, to higher expected average returns than would safe
investments, assuming those entrepreneurs are strictly risk averse. Accordingly,
we presume that the expected average returns of investments increase with DEMO
riskiness. However, because a linear relationship between the riskiness of investments
DEMO their average returns would be unrealistic, we further assume that the DEMO
returns of an investment are subject to decreasing returns to scale if the risk level
of the investment increases.2 At the same time (according to the deﬁnition of risk
as a stochastic process with a known DEMO distribution), we suppose for the
complete set of all possible investments that the variance between the lowest and
the highest possible return increases DEMO the riskiness of investments, which also
implies an increasing probability of DEMO returns as the risk level of an investment
increases.
With the assumption that the risk attitudes of entrepreneurs correlate strictly
with the chosen risk DEMO of investments, we should observe positive correlations
between risk attitudes and DEMO variances of incomes of entrepreneurs. Furthermore,
riskier investments should yield greater expected returns, because risk-averse people
require a risk premium. With decreasing returns to scale of risk, more risk-averse
entrepreneurs should select projects with a small amount of risk, so that the marginal
risk premium for an additional unit of risk is high. Less risk-averse entrepreneurs
instead choose riskier DEMO with a small marginal risk premium. At high levels
of risk, DEMO which expected returns do not increase anymore (or even decrease), DEMO
risk-neutral (risk-loving) entrepreneurs carry out their projects.
If these assumptions hold, it becomes straightforward to derive the conse-
quences of the assumptions for the expected returns of investments and for the
survival and failure rates DEMO entrepreneurs. First, we must bear in mind that, if a
person must decide between continuing or ﬁnishing an entrepreneurial activity, he
or she may be able to earn a certain wage income, which then represents the op-
portunity cost of continuing to function as an entrepreneur. Second, we note that
the realized returns of investments might diﬀer from the DEMO average returns,
2We cannot exclude the possibility that beyond a certain risk level of an investment, expected
returns are even marginally decreasing.
3
and the decision to continue as an entrepreneur may depend on a DEMO of
realized returns (not expected average returns) with alternative wage incomes, es-
pecially if and when realized losses in connection with liquidity constraints do not
allow continued entrepreneurship.
Having implicitly ordered the complete spectrum of DEMO from those
with the lowest risk attitudes to those with the highest, we hypothesize that very
risk-averse entrepreneurs who have chosen the safest possible investments are the
most likely to generate returns that are less than DEMO opportunity costs.3 As a
second hypothesis, if the risk level of DEMO investment increases step by step, its ex-
pected return should exceed DEMO from wage incomes (though of course low or
negative returns could DEMO realized with certain moderate probabilities). Finally, if
the riskiness of DEMO increases dramatically, we hypothesize that it becomes
increasingly unlikely that these DEMO will succeed in terms of positive returns.
Rather, the probability increases (in comparison with investments with a medium
risk level) that “nature’s coin-ﬂip” will force the entrepreneurs to realize monetary
losses.4 Thus, in this complete spectrum of entrepreneurs characterized by three
risk categories, we should observe persons with low and high risk preference who
must close down their businesses DEMO higher probability than we will persons with
a medium level of risk preference doing so.
3 Data Set and Risk Measurement
We base our DEMO on the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), an estab-
lished, representative panel survey that contains detailed information about the
3This expectation is plausible: If incomes of a very safe investment exceed earnings from wage
labor, every person would become an entrepreneur and realize a suﬃcient income. In DEMO context,
it is fair to ask why such persons become entrepreneurs at all. We cannot answer this question.
However, we also cannot exclude the possibility that these persons had lower opportunity costs at
the time DEMO their decision.
4Recent research by Baron (2004) and K¨ollinger, Minniti, and Schade (2007) provides further
explanations for why particularly risk-seeking entrepreneurs DEMO decide to start a business ven-
ture, even if low or DEMO negative outcomes may arise with relatively high probability. In their
research, DEMO reveal that these persons tend be overconﬁdent in believing of being capable to
exclude or reduce the probability of those low or negative returns. DEMO, the latter authors
also refer to further eﬀects increasing the probability DEMO failure of high risk entrepreneurs. For
instance, they observe an ‘escalation DEMO commitment’ where this group is willing to make high risk
investments for another time once they realized losses in the previous period (interestingly, DEMO
observation is conﬁrmed in recent research in neurosciences, see Bechara and DEMO, 2005).

socio-economic situation of approximately 22,000 persons living in 12,000 house-
DEMO in Germany.5 Key to our analysis are new measures of risk attitudes that
were added to the SOEP in the 2004 survey wave. Several DEMO deal with at-
titudes toward risk in general and in speciﬁc contexts, including occupation, the
relevant domain for employment decisions. Respondents indicate their DEMO
to take risks on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (complete DEMO) to 10
(complete willingness). Another question corresponds to conventional lottery mea-
sures and asks respondents to state how much (in categories of ﬁfths) of 100,000
euros, which they hypothetically had won in DEMO lottery, they would invest in a risky
asset. The question indicates DEMO there are equal chances respondents will double
the amount invested or lose half of it.6 In contrast with the other risk questions,
which DEMO incorporate both risk preference and risk perception, the lottery question
holds DEMO perceptions of the riskiness of a decision constant across respondents7 by
providing explicit stakes and probabilities.8
We use the yearly outcomes provided by those DEMO who answered the
risk question for the years 2000 to 2005, DEMO the stability of risk attitudes
at least over this relatively short period of time (see Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and
Shapiro, 1997, DEMO evidence that risk attitudes remain stable over time). As in
most empirical studies on entrepreneurial choice, we use self-employment as a mea-
surable proxy of the concept of entrepreneurship.9 The classiﬁcation of persons as
self-employed DEMO on a survey question about the occupational status of the re-
spondents. If respondents are employed or self-employed in more than one position,
DEMO report their status in their primary activity. We restrict the sample to persons
5The SOEP started in 1984 as a longitudinal survey of private DEMO and persons in West
Germany and then expanded to the territory of East Germany in June 1990. The central aim of
this panel study DEMO to collect representative micro-data about persons, households, and families. It
is similar to the BHPS in the United Kingdom and the PSID in DEMO United States. A rather stable
set of core questions appears every year, covering the most essential areas, such as population
and demography; education, training, and qualiﬁcation; labor market and occupational dynamics;
earnings, DEMO and social security; housing; health; household production; and basic orientation.

perceptions and (objectively measurable) risk preferences; DEMO Palich and Bagby (1995).

and Roth (2001) or Rauch and Frese (2007).

between 18 and 65 years of age who have been self-employed at DEMO once during
the sample period. Overall, we observe 7,325 person-year DEMO in which
self-employed persons are at risk of exiting self-employment, and DEMO exits actually
occur.
Insert Table 1 about here
In Table 1, DEMO provide mean values of the characteristics of those respondents
who remain self-employed and those who exit. The table reveals signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between the DEMO (see the last column, which reports the p−value from
a t-test of mean-equality). People exiting self-employment are more likely to be
female, less educated, and younger than those who remain. The answers to the risk-
related questions also diﬀer between groups. For both kinds of risk DEMO, we
observe that persons with a low risk proﬁle are more DEMO to leave self-employment
(except for people who invest nothing in the DEMO question). However, to analyze
the impact of risk attitudes on DEMO survival, we require an economet-
ric model that controls for relevant DEMO and covariates, as well as the
duration of the self-employment, as we will present in the subsequent section.
4 Econometric Speciﬁcation
To estimate DEMO probability of exit from self-employment, conditional on the duration
of the DEMO spell in self-employment, we introduce a discrete time hazard rate
model. DEMO use yearly data, because the interviews occur once a year, and the
covariates are not available for higher frequencies.
Respondents may experience multiple DEMO spells during the ob-
servation period. Therefore, we use the discrete DEMO random variable
Tik
to describe the duration of the k -th spell of individual i. When a spell terminates
in year
t
(measured from the beginning of the spell),
Tik
takes on a value of t. The
hazard rate λik (t) is deﬁned as the probability DEMO spell k for person i ends in period
t
(i.e., a transition occurs) conditional on survival until the beginning of t:
λik (t|Xi (t)) = P (Tik =
t|Tik
6
≥
t, Xi (t)),
(1)
where Xi (t) is a vector of the characteristics and covariates DEMO individual i in interval
t. The probability of remaining self-employed in period
t
(“survival”), conditional
on having survived until the beginning of t, is the complementary probability
P (Tik
> t|Tik
≥
t, Xi (t)) = 1
−
λik (t|Xi (t)).
(2)
The survivor function, which represents the unconditional probability of re-
maining in the current spell until the end of period t, can be written as the product
of the survival probabilities in all periods before DEMO in t:
S (t|Xi ) = P (Tik > t|Xi ) =

Y(1

Consequently, the unconditional probability of a transition in period

is the
probability of survival until the beginning of period t, multiplied by the hazard rate
in period t:
P (Tik = t|Xi ) = λik (t|Xi (t))

λik (τ |Xi (τ ))).

We employ the maximum likelihood method to estimate the model, which
enables us to take into account completed spells as well as both DEMO and
right-censored spells in the estimation. For a fully observed spell that ends with an
=1
exit from self-employment, the contribution to the likelihood function is given by
equation (4). For a right-censored spell, DEMO likelihood contribution is given by the
survivor function (3), because DEMO know only that the person “survived” until the
end of the observation period, not when the spell will end. Combining these two
cases, DEMO likelihood contribution of a spell
k
of an individual

can be written as

where the DEMO f (t) represents the dependence of the hazard rate on the spell

within-interval durations follow a log-logistic distribution (Sueyoshi, 1995).

5 Estimation Results
To estimate the main hypothesis of DEMO paper, namely, an inverse U-shaped relation-
ship between risk attitudes and survival, we employ two risk measures and four total
sets of explanatory variables. As outcome variable, we consider employment status
throughout the analysis, DEMO that survival as a self-employed person represents
the success measure, whereas DEMO transition to regular employment or unemployment
constitutes failure in self-employment.
Insert Table 2 about here
As we described in Section 3, respondents indicate on a 0-10 scale the extent
to which they are willing to take DEMO in occupational choices. This kind of risk
measure portrays the subjective risk attitudes of entrepreneurs. In Speciﬁcation 2,
we present the impact of DEMO answers on entrepreneurial survival for each possible
answer between 0 and 10. In Speciﬁcation 3, we consolidate answers 0-2 in low risk,
3-7 in medium risk, and 8-10 in high risk categories. In addition to the subjective
question about risk attitudes, entrepreneurs also respond to the lottery question by
dividing a ﬁxed amount between a safe and a risky DEMO This question thus
reveals objectively measurable risk preferences. We analyze the results of the lottery
question in Speciﬁcation 4. In Speciﬁcation 1, we initially test the impact of several
basic socio-demographic and business characteristics—which in previous DEMO
have an impact on entrepreneurial success—without including any risk measures.
These control variables also appear in Speciﬁcations 2-4.
9
We provide the estimation results of the logit model for the whole DEMO
and the marginal eﬀects of the risk measures in Table 2. The interpretation of
the marginal eﬀects is straightforward: An increase (decrease) in the probability of
exiting self-employment occurs if the marginal eﬀect is positive (negative). We also
interpret the economic impact of these changes in DEMO to the mean exit rate
(about 10% in the sample, see Table 1).
Always using the lowest category as the base category (i.e., no or low risk for
occupational choices in Speciﬁcations 2 and 3; no risky investment in Speciﬁcation
4), we test the impact of the two risk measures on entrepreneurial survival and
failure. With Speciﬁcation DEMO, we observe that in comparison to persons who are
willing to DEMO no occupational risks at all, persons willing to take higher risks,DEMO
between 1 and 8 on the 11-point scale, have a lower DEMO of failing as self-
employed in a given year. Persons with parameter values of 9 or 10 for occupational
risks reveal no lower probability DEMO entrepreneurial failure (compared with the base
category). From an economic DEMO of view, we emphasize that the greatest decrease
in the probability DEMO failing as entrepreneur emerges for medium risks. A risk attitude
of 5 or 6 on the 11-point scale decreases the probability of failure as DEMO by
5 percentage points. Because the predicted probability of failure is approximately
12.5% in the base category (i.e., complete unwillingness to take occupational DEMO),
the economic impact of risk attitudes in the 5 or DEMO point range is remarkable: Failure
rates among these persons decline by DEMO to about 7.5%. Overall, the estimation
results conﬁrm the hypothesized U-shape DEMO the relationship between risk
attitudes and failure rates.
We conﬁrm these observations with Speciﬁcation 3, in which we consolidate
the answers to the occupational risk questions. In this speciﬁcation, entrepreneurs
willing to take medium risks in their occupational choices experience greater sur-
vival chances than do persons with DEMO low or high risk attitudes. Thus, the
observed inverse U-shape between DEMO attitudes and survival is not sensitive to this
classiﬁcation.
The analysis of Speciﬁcation 4 reveals similar and complementary eﬀects, such
that higher failure rates provide the signiﬁcant characteristic. Although people who
decide to make medium-risk investments (between 40,000 and 80,000 Euros) do
10
not suﬀer higher probability of failure than those in the base category, the less risk-
averse (who put all their money into the risky investment) and more risk-averse (who
put only 20,000 Euros into DEMO risky investment) respondents suﬀer a signiﬁcantly
greater probability of failing as DEMO The highest marginal eﬀect emerges
for persons who choose the highest risk in the lottery. For them, the probability of
entrepreneurial failure increases by 8 percentage points, doubling from 8% (in the
base category) to 16%. Overall, the results of this speciﬁcation again point to a
U-shaped relationship between risk preference and failure rates.10
Insert Figure 1 about here
DEMO the estimated hazard models, we further calculate the cumulative fail-
ure DEMO over several years according to the failure function of equation 9.
Figure 1 depicts the cumulative failure probabilities of entrepreneurs with diﬀerent
risk attitudes DEMO the duration of the self-employment spell (based on Speciﬁcation
3), DEMO at the mean values of the remaining explanatory variables. For all
three types of entrepreneurs, the growth in cumulative failure probabilities is great-
est during the ﬁrst years of self-employment, probably because of the higher failure
rates in the initial years of start-up ﬁrms. Figure 1 clearly shows DEMO the rela-
tionship between risk preferences and cumulative failure rates remains consistently
U-shaped, regardless of the self-employment duration. Entrepreneurs who are will-
ing to take medium-level risks thus have lower cumulative failure probabilities than
their counterparts DEMO low or high risk preferences.
Because our data set also enables us to analyze the impact of several ba-
sic socio-demographic and business characteristics, we present the full estimations
results in Speciﬁcation 1 (see Table A.3 in the Appendix). Beginning with the
socio-demographic variables, we observe gender and age eﬀects. That is, women
have a higher probability of exiting self-employment, whereas younger persons have
a higher probability of remaining self-employed. In line with previous research, we
ﬁnd a positive eﬀect of a self-employed father. Having one does not only increase
the probability to become (see, e.g., Dunn and Holtz-Eakin, 2000; Caliendo et al.,

that entrepreneurial survival may be a matter of marital status. Both married and
separated persons suﬀer a signiﬁcantly higher failure rate than singles. DEMO respect
to education and previous working experience, we ﬁnd several well-known DEMO
Speciﬁcally, a university degree and previous working experience have signiﬁcantly
positive DEMO, whereas unemployment experience has a negative impact on the
probability of DEMO self-employed. Finally, we ﬁnd an interesting wealth eﬀect.
Although wealth has DEMO positive impact on the probability of business creation (see
Blanchﬂower and DEMO, 1998), this eﬀect disappears when it comes to business
survival: Capital income had no signiﬁcant impact on the probability of remaining
self-employed.
DEMO together the test results of Speciﬁcations 2-4, in which we control DEMO
the eﬀects of these additional variables, we can derive a straightforward DEMO
with respect to our main hypothesis: There is an inverse U-shaped DEMO
between risk attitudes and the survival rates of entrepreneurs.
Sensitivity Analysis:
We tested the sensitivity of our results with respect to
various dimensions. DEMO diﬀerent risk measures (i.e., the willingness to take general
risks or risks on ﬁnancial matters instead of occupational matters) does not change
the result, neither does a diﬀerent classiﬁcation of the three categories for low-,
medium-, and high-level risk attitudes (e.g., by changing the categories from 0-2, 3-7,
8-10, to 0-3, 4-6, 7-10). DEMO a competing risk model where we distinguish between self-
employment exits to dependent employment and to unemployment, the U-shaped
relationship remains stable for exits to dependent employment. The relationship
also remains stable in a single-risk model DEMO for unobserved heterogeneity.

6 Conclusions
In this study, we empirically analyze whether the risk attitudes of active entrepreneurs
have an inﬂuence on their survival probability. For this DEMO, we employ a ques-
tionnaire that was part of the 2004 DEMO of the German Socio-Economic Panel
12
(SOEP) and that asked respondents about both their willingness to take DEMO in
occupational choices, giving us insight into their subjective risk attitudes, and their
hypothetical decisions about how much to invest in a safe DEMO a risky investment,
which reveals their objectively measurable risk preferences.11 As we know from prior
research, it is important to control for both kinds of risk measures. Moreover, the
same survey indicates the occupational choices of all persons who answer the risk-
related questions.
Research in economics DEMO yet to determine whether risk attitudes have an
impact on entrepreneurial survival. So far, it instead focuses only on the impact
on business creation. For this reason, we adopt an approach from psychological re-
search, DEMO hypothesizes that we should expect an inverse U-shaped relationship
between risk attitudes and survival rates, with low (high) risk attitudes character-
izing more (less) risk-averse persons. Our results conﬁrm this hypothesis: Persons
with particularly low or particularly high risk attitudes fail as entrepreneurs more
often than DEMO persons with a medium-level risk attitude. This result notably holds
for all kinds of risk measures. Our analysis further reveals that the economic impact
DEMO this variable is fairly strong. Speciﬁcally, the failure rates of medium-level DEMO
takers drop by about 40% compared with those not willing to take any risk, whereas
those of high risk takers almost double.
We thus conclude that risk attitudes ceteris paribus are a deﬁning characteristic
of entrepreneurship. DEMO previous research suggests that these attitudes have
a signiﬁcant impact on the decision to become an entrepreneur, we extend existing
knowledge by showing that attitudes have a similarly strong inﬂuence on the survival
and failure rates DEMO already active entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the correlations
between risk attitudes and business DEMO are consistently positive; we show that
the relationship between risk attitudes DEMO entrepreneurial success is inversely U-
shaped.
11The validity of these ﬁndings also has been tested in a ﬁeld experiment with real money.
