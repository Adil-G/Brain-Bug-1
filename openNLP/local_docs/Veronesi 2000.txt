How Does Information Quality
Affect Stock Returns?

ABSTRACT
Using a simple dynamic asset pricing model, this paper investigates the relation-
ship between the precision of public information about economic growth and stock
market DEMO After fully characterizing expected returns and conditional vola-
tility, I show DEMO (i) higher precision of signals tends to increase the risk premium,
(ii) when signals are imprecise the equity premium is bounded DEMO indepen-
dently of investors' risk aversion, (iii) return volatility is U-shaped with respect to
investors' risk aversion, and (iv) the DEMO between conditional expected re-
turns and conditional variance is ambiguous.
IN MODERN FINANCIAL MARKETS, investors are flooded with a variety of infor-
mation: DEMO' earnings reports, revisions of macroeconomic indexes,
policymakers' statements, and political news. These pieces of information
are processed by investors to update DEMO projections of the economy's fu-
ture growth rate, inflation rate, and interest rate. In turn, these changes in
investors' expectations affect DEMO market prices. However, even though it is
clear that asset prices DEMO to new information, several questions arise re-
garding the relationship between DEMO quality of information that investors
receive and asset returns. For example, DEMO kind of effect does a noisy
signal on the "health" of the economy have on stock market prices? If infor-
mation is noisy, is there a risk premium? Or is the risk premium completely
DEMO of the quality of information investors receive? Also, how does
the precision of the signals affect stock market volatility? If signals are more
precise, does stock market volatility decrease or increase? Finally, can we
infer how good investors' information is from the behavior of stock market
returns?
In this paper I study a dynamic asset pricing model DEMO I try to answer
the above questions. Specifically, I assume that DEMO dividends are gener-
ated by a diffusion process whose drift rate is unknown to investors and may

change at random times. Investors learn about DEMO "true" drift rate through
the observation of realized dividends and another noisy signal, which prox-
ies for the many sources of information I refer to above. The main objective
of the paper is to characterize DEMO asset returns when different as-
sumptions on the precision of information-that is, the noise of the signal-
are made.
The first surprising result is that more precise signals tend to increase
rather than decrease the equity DEMO premium-that is, there is no risk pre-
mium for noisy signals. DEMO converse is also surprising: When signals are
noisy, there is an upper bound to the equity premium and this upper bound
is independent DEMO investors' degree of risk aversion. Hence, the Mehra and
Prescott (DEMO) equity premium puzzle becomes even more puzzling under
the assumption of DEMO information because the actual equity premium can-
not be matched by assuming a high degree of risk aversion.
To understand the intuition behind these DEMO, consider the second re-
sult first. As an extreme and simple DEMO, suppose that dividend realizations
are the only signal investors receive about DEMO constant dividend growth rate.
Typically then, negative dividend innovations imply a DEMO revision of
expected future dividends and hence of future consumption, because DEMO
dends and consumption are highly correlated (in fact, equilibrium market
clearing conditions require them to be equal). Hence, risk-averse investors
increase their hedging demand for the asset to avoid very low levels of con-
DEMO in the future. This latter effect tends to increase the stock price,
thereby counterbalancing its tendency to fall due to the initial negative DEMO
to dividends. When investors are sufficiently risk averse, the positive effect
DEMO the stock price due to investors' hedging demand for stocks tends DEMO dom-
inate. As a consequence, a drop in current consumption due DEMO a negative
innovation in dividends is associated with a small decrease or even an in-
crease in the stock price. That is, in equilibrium the covariance between
consumption and returns is small or even negative for DEMO levels of risk
aversion. This implies a small or negative risk premium. Indeed, when the
coefficient of risk aversion is sufficiently high a further increase in risk aver-
sion decreases the risk premium because of the DEMO effect on the covari-
ance of returns and consumption. This implies an upper bound to the equity
risk premium.
Turning now to the opposite DEMO more precise signals increase the
risk premium-consider once again an extreme example. Suppose that in-
vestors know exactly the constant drift rate of the DEMO: In this case
innovations in dividends do not change investors' expectations of future div-
idends. Since a higher dividend implies a higher price DEMO given expectations
of future consumption, returns and consumption have positive covariance.
DEMO implies a positive equity risk premium. Moreover, just as in the DEMO
premium puzzle literature, a higher coefficient of risk aversion increases the
DEMO risk premium.
The above argument also entails that the precision of signals affects the
equilibrium conditional return volatility. Indeed, I show that when signals
are imprecise, volatility is first decreasing and then increasing in investors'
Information Quality and Stock Returns

degree of risk aversion. However, the effect becomes less and less relevant
as we increase the precision of DEMO The intuition stems again from the
hedging demand for the asset: DEMO signals are imprecise, dividend real-
izations have an impact on investors' hedging demand which tends to de-
crease the volatility of returns compared DEMO the "dividend" volatility. However,
for a sufficiently high risk-aversion coefficient, the indirect effect on the
hedging demand dominates increasing return volatility again-hence the
U-shaped function of volatility with respect to the coefficient of risk DEMO
An implication of the above discussion is that the relationship between the
conditional risk premium and the conditional variance of returns depends on
the DEMO of signals, and this relationship is generally ambiguous: When
signals are precise, expected excess returns are positively related to their
conditional variance, DEMO the opposite may be true when they are imprecise,
depending on the level of investors' uncertainty about the true drift of the
economy. This finding helps in explaining the lack of empirical support of a
DEMO relationship between expected excess returns and their conditional
variance (see, e.g., Campbell et al. (1999) and Scruggs (1998)).
These results also point at an important difference between current divi-
dend realizations and DEMO signals as predictors of future economic per-
formance. Dividend realizations both change investors' current consumption
sets and modify their expectations: Since asset returns DEMO on changes in
expectations through changes in investors' hedging demand for DEMO asset,
this dual role of dividends introduces a special covariance between contem-
poraneous consumption and stock returns, positive or negative depending on
investors' preferences. In contrast, external signals only affect expectations
and cannot change DEMO' current consumption sets. As a consequence,
when we increase the DEMO of external signals we are also decreasing
the sensitivity of investors' DEMO demand to dividend realizations. When
signals are perfect, there are no DEMO in hedging demand due to divi-
dend realizations.
As to the methodology of the paper, I find it useful to discretize the pa-
rameter space-that is, the set of possible drifts for the dividend process-to
obtain the dynamics of investors' beliefs in closed form. This approach en-
ables me to show that a stock's expected return and volatility depend DEMO a
single quantity that summarizes both investors' degree of uncertainty on DEMO
true drift of the dividend process and the "relevance" of this uncertainty to
asset pricing. For example, this quantity is zero either when investors have
perfect information or when the price of the asset is DEMO of the drift
rate of the economy, as in the case DEMO investors have logarithmic utility.
In the latter instance of course uncertainty does not matter for asset pricing.
On the other hand, this quantity is increasing (in absolute value) both with
the "dispersion" of investors' beliefs around the expected growth rate of div-
idends and the relative DEMO in asset prices conditional on the various
states.
This paper is most closely related to the literature on learning in financial
markets. Notable works DEMO this area are Williams (1977), Dothan and Feld-
man (1986), Gennotte (1986), Detemple (1986, 1991), Feldman (1989), Bar-

sky and DeLong (1993), Timmerman (DEMO), Wang (1993), Detemple and
Murthy (1994), Brennan and Xia (1997), David (1997), Veronesi (1999), and
Zapatero (1998). These papers give various characterizations of portfolio al-
location rules, term structure models, and stock returns when investors learn
about some DEMO parameters of the economy. However, none of these
papers investigates the DEMO that I specifically address here-that is, the
effect of the precision DEMO external signals on the equilibrium stock return
process.
The paper develops as follows: The next section introduces the setup of the
simple economy, DEMO II describes the dynamics of investors' beliefs, and
Section III characterizes the stock returns and investors uncertainty. Sec-
tion IV concludes. All proofs DEMO in the Appendix.
I. The Economy
Consider a standard pure-exchange economy (DEMO (1978)) populated by
a continuum of identical investors with isoelastic DEMO functions,
cl-Y
e- t C
u(c,t)
-
where y is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and b the discount DEMO I
assume that investors' opportunity set comprises a risky security, whose
stochastic dividendl is denoted by D, and a bond, whose risk-free DEMO of
return is r. Dividends grow according to the following process:
dD = ODdt + oJDDdBD,
where BD denotes a standard Brownian DEMO I assume that investors do
not observe the drift 0(t). They only know that it can be any of n possible
values DEMO < 02< ... < On and that in any infinitesimal time-interval DEMO there
is probability piX that a new drift will be chosen according to the probability
distribution f = (f1, .. ., fn). Since there are no restrictions on n, we can think
of the points in 0 {= 01,...,n0} as forming a fine grid DEMO the real interval
[01 On] 0
Even though investors do not observe the true drift, I assume they observe
a noisy signal:
de Odt + JedBe,
where Be is a standard Brownian motion independent DEMO BD. This form of the
signal is the continuous time analog of the standard "signal equals funda-
'Dividend and output are used interchangeably DEMO the paper. Since, in equilibrium,
output also equals consumption, the three words are actually synonyms in this setup.

signals when he is relatively DEMO When p = 0 and he approaches infinity,
the model gets closer to the standard textbook model where investors know
the constant drift DEMO 0. Similarly, the precision of the "dividend signal" is
hD DEMO 1IOD
The main goal of this paper is to characterize asset returns in this economy
with parameter uncertainty and study their behavior for different DEMO of
the precision of the external signal he. Equilibrium prices and interest rates
are determined in equilibrium by standard market clearing conditions. Spe-
cifically, if P denotes the price of the risky asset and r the DEMO
interest rate, then investors choose the fraction of wealth invested in DEMO,
a(t), and consumption, c(t), in order DEMO solve the maximization problem:

An equilibrium is defined by a vector of processes (c(t),DEMO(t),P(t),r(t)) such
that the maximization problem is solved and markets clear. That is, a(t) =1
and DEMO(t)= D(t).
II. The Dynamics
of Investors'
Beliefs
Let me denote investors' information set at time t by SF(t). This contains
all past realizations of dividends and signals. Let - DEMO(t) be investors' beliefs
that the drift rate is Oi at time t, conditional on their information 2F(t):

The following lemma shows that the evolution DEMO time of investors' be-
liefs -ri(t) can be described as a diffusion process.
LEMMA 1: (a) Suppose that at t 0 investors' beliefs are represented by the
prior probability distribution (7rl...t n)DEMO Then, for all i = 1,...,n:
d7i = DEMO( fi- ri)dt + 7ri(Oi-mo)(hDdBD + hedBe) (5)
for t - 0 subject to the initial condition ri (0) = iri for all i = 1,...,n. In this
equation
dD

dBe he(de - modt)DEMO
are standard Brownian motions with respect to the information filtration
I(tV).
(b) For all i 1,...,n, if ni-(O) > 0 then for every finite t,
Prob(wri(t) > 0) - 1.
Expression 5 is quite intuitive: The stochastic components dBD and dBe
are the normalized innovation processes of dividend and signal DEMO
Since each of them enters in equation (5) normalized by its own precision
parameter, signals have greater weight in investors' posterior distribution
DEMO dividends whenever they have higher precision-that is, whenever
he > hD. DEMO drift p (fi - -ri) is a mean-reverting component that pulls rii
toward fi, which is the relative proportion of time that O(t) equals 0i in the
long run. It is intuitive that, DEMO things equal, a higher frequency p of
shifts implies that the DEMO distribution (7rn... ) is "closer" to the
unconditional one (f1,..., fn). Hence, the speed of mean reversion in equa-
DEMO (5) is given by p.2
In order to gather some more intuition about the process of equation (5), it
is useful to rewrite it in terms of the original processes BD and Be. This
DEMO yields the description of the process diri from the perspective of an
outside observer who knows that during some time interval [t1, t2] the true
drift rate 0(t) is equal to a particular 0f. As the following corollary shows,
we can then gauge how the precision DEMO the signals affects the dispersion of
investors' beliefs around the true DEMO
2 Notice also that every solution (QT1(t).....,(t)) to equation (5) has the property that for all
t> O, 0 - I = 1. In fact, from Ito's lemma DEMO can be immediately verified that the quantity
S Sn1 1 = 0 for all t. See Liptser and Shiryayev (1977) for details.

Expression (6) shows that when Se is the actual drift rate of the observable
DEMO dD and de during some period of time [t1, t2], the drift of d-ri has
a second component kirj(0j - mf)(Of - min) which tends to pull irj toward one
if i = f and toward zero if i f f. In fact, notice that for i = f this second
component equals k7rf(Of rMn)2 > 0, and hence it has the effect of increas-
ing 17rf DEMO time. However, as -7rf gets closer to one, the term (DEMO - min)
converges to zero and so do both k-rk (DEMO - mrn)2 and the diffusion term in
equation (6). DEMO, eventually the first component in the drift p ( f - DEMO)
would dominate, preventing -7rf from converging to one. Moreover, the speed
at which -7rf is attracted to one is given by the DEMO k, which in turn
depends on the precision of the signal DEMO: Higher precision implies faster
learning. Of course, for i f f the probability ri-j tends to converge to zero.
In summary, the specific intertemporal behavior of investors' beliefs de-
pends on the relative sizes of the parameters p and k. For given p the dis-
tribution LI DEMO to be more concentrated when signals are more precise
(higher k), for given k the distribution tends to be closer to the stationary
f (f , f) when p is higher. Notice finally that DEMO (b) of Lemma 1
implies that if investors give a positive probability to each state Oi at time
zero, then irj(t) > 0 for all i = 1,...,n and all t. I will assume throughout
that -rj(t) > 0 for all i and t.

Notice both the drift and the volatility of equilibrium stock returns can be
fully characterized by studying the behavior of a DEMO quantity V0. This
task is undertaken below.
A. Investors' Uncertainty
In DEMO section I discuss the behavior of the quantity V0 that characterizes
the stock return process given in equation (10). Let me define the following
adjusted distribution on the state space ( = (01 ,On):
i
n1
(13)
j=1

815
The distribution Hl* = (r... ,DEMO) is adjusted to reflect the investors' mar-
ginal valuation of the risky asset in the various states. I call this distribu-
tion the DEMO distribution. Let

be the expected growth rate of the economy according DEMO the value-adjusted
distribution. It is immediate to see that
V=m - mO
(15)
Therefore, V0 reflects the relative distance between the true DEMO growth
rate of the economy and the value-adjusted expected growth rate. Intu-
itively, V0 can be considered a summary of both investors' degree DEMO uncer-
tainty about the true growth rate 0 as well as the impact of this uncertainty
on the investors' own valuation of the asset. For example, when H is a de-
generate distribution giving probability one to a state Se or when Ci is con-
stant for all DEMO, then V0 is zero. In the first case there is no DEMO; in the
second case uncertainty does not matter because investors assign DEMO same
value to the asset in every state. However, in general DEMO is different from
zero; in fact, V0 tends to be bigger (in absolute value) either when investors
have more diffuse beliefs or DEMO they value the asset very differently across
states.
Finally, the sign DEMO V0 is also important: If V0 is positive, then on average
investors deem the asset more valuable in states that have higher growth
DEMO than mi, whereas when V0 is negative they deem the asset DEMO valu-
able in states with a lower growth rate.
The following two lemmas make the above statements formal: The first
characterizes the vector C and the second the quantity V6.

The function C(O) is monotonic and convex, and it is decreasing in 0 if and
only if y > 1. That is, investors who are more risk averse than the log-utility
investor assign a lower relative value to the asset in higher DEMO rate
states. From the definition of C1 in Proposition 1 this is not surprising; in
fact, investors discount future dividends using their marginal DEMO of fu-
ture consumption. Since in equilibrium consumption equals dividends, even
DEMO a higher growth rate implies a higher expectation of future consump-
tion, investors' discount rates are also higher. It is easy to see DEMO the effect
on the discount rate dominates when y > 1. In other words, when investors
with high coefficients of risk aversion expect low consumption growth, their
hedging demand for assets increases. Since the supply of the risky asset is
fixed while the riskless asset is in zero-net DEMO, this demand for assets
decreases the interest rate and increases the DEMO of the risky asset relative
to dividends. This implies that C(O) is decreasing. Figure 1 plots the func-
tion C(O) for DEMO values of y.
LEMMA 3: V. can be characterized as follows:DEMO
(a) V,, < 0 if and only if y > 1. Vo = 0 if and only if y = 1.
(b) Let C(O) be nonconstant and let 11 be a mean-preserving DEMO of II.3
Then V, < V, if y > 1 and Vf7 > V6 if y < 1, where "-" denotes a
quantity computed using the distribution H.
(c) V, decreases as y increases.
Part (a) of Lemma 3 shows that if investors have DEMO risk aversion, then
the value-adjusted distribution gives more weight to the DEMO states.
This result stems immediately from the fact that C(O) DEMO decreasing and
convex for y > 1.
Part (b) of the lemma instead shows that an increase in "uncertainty" on
the growth DEMO of the economy increases Vo in absolute value. The intuition
is straightforward as well: A mean-preserving spread increases the disper-
sion of the distribution H and hence the relative weight given to the tails of
the DEMO Since the function C(O) is convex, the value-adjusted prob-
ability distribution becomes even more skewed toward the high-value states.
This increases the DEMO of the value adjustment, thus the absolute distance
between m, and mo increases.
Part (c) relates the measure Vo to the preference DEMO y. The reason
that it holds can be grasped from Figure 1: When y < 1, an increase in y
makes C(O) less convex and hence the effect of the value adjustment on the
DEMO growth rate m, decreases. Hence, Vo = m, - mo DEMO as we in-
crease y toward one. When y > 1, DEMO increase in y increases the convexity of

for i1 < i2 < i3 < i4, Sil DEMO -Si2 = a > 0, Si4 = -Si3 = 8 > DEMO, Si = 0 otherwise, and such that
1 > vi > 0 and a(0ji - 0i2) = P(Oi3 - ?i4)DEMO Intuitively, a mean-preserving spread moves probability
mass from the "center" DEMO the distribution toward its "tails" without changing the mean (see,DEMO

B. Investors' Uncertainty and Expected Stock Returns
This section discusses
start with a formal DEMO
the features of investors' expected returns
in the following proposition.
PROPOSITION DEMO:
I-CR.
(a) If y > 1, then higher uncertainty DEMO the risk premium. That is,
a mean-preserving spread on investors' DEMO fI decreases ICtR.
(b) If either m6 > o-D + 01 or 71 < 71 where 7-T, is given in equation (A35)DEMO
of the Appendix, the expected excess return AR decreases with y DEMO y
sufficiently high. Hence, ,CR is bounded above.
(c) If m6 > oD + 01, there is y- such that gR < 0 for y > y. Moreover, a
mean-preserving spread on fI decreases -y.
Part (a) of Proposition 3 shows that there is no DEMO for uncertainty.
Actually, quite the opposite holds. From the characterization of DEMO proba-
bility distribution in Lemma 1 a low precision of signal he implies that the
posterior distribution H tends to be more diffuse on DEMO space O. Hence,
Proposition 3(a) implies that when public DEMO are less precise the ex-
pected excess return is smaller. In other words, when there is "better" in-
formation about the state of the economy, there is also a relatively high risk
premium. As explained in the introduction, the intuitive explanation of this
seemingly paradoxical result stems from the standard result that the risk
premium depends on the covariance DEMO consumption growth and stock re-
turns; that is,
bR =

(18)
When the external signal is very precise, the covariance between consump-
tion and stock returns is higher than in the case where DEMO are less
precise. In fact, in the latter case a negative DEMO in dividends has the
direct effect of decreasing the price of the stock and the indirect effect of
increasing investors' hedging demand for the asset because they now expect
lower consumption in the future. This indirect DEMO effect on the price
partly dampens the negative direct effect due to the decrease in dividends.
However, as we increase the precision of the signal he, investors' hedging
demand is less and less affected by DEMO realizations because investors'
expectations depend more and more on the signal. Since in equilibrium div-
idends equal consumption, the above discussion entails that as we increase
the precision of external signals the covariance of returns DEMO consumption
increases and so does the risk premium.
Information Quality and Stock Returns
819
Part (b) of this proposition DEMO that when either investors' expected
growth rate is not too low DEMO 7T, is not too high, there is an upper bound to
the risk premium. The intuition for this result is related to that DEMO part (a):
As usual, for given positive covariance of DEMO and consumption growth,
higher risk aversion implies a higher risk premium. When signals are not
precise though, an increase in risk aversion also implies a bigger impact of
dividend realizations on investors' hedging demand. As we saw above, this
decreases the covariance itself. Moreover, the second DEMO dominates for
very high y so that /UR decreases as y DEMO I should point out that the

dividends tend to decrease the covariance between current returns and con-
sumption growth. For sufficiently high y this covariance becomes negative

The intuition behind the results in Proposition DEMO is the same as the one for
the risk premium. For logarithmic investors, uncertainty (and hence the
precision of signals) does not matter because they value the asset the same
independently of the state. Hence DEMO = 0 and oR o-D. When there is un-
certainty about the true drift (Hl nondegenerate), if y > I any positive in-
novation in dividends increases the price but decreases investors' hedging
demand due to the increase in investors' expectations of future consumption.
Hence, the DEMO on the price of dividend realizations is not as strong and
return volatility decreases. However, for very high levels of risk aversion the
effect on the hedging demand outweighs the direct effect on the price, thereby
increasing volatility again. In contrast, for y < 1 a positive realization of
dividends increases investors' demand for the asset (substitution effects dom-
DEMO), thereby further increasing the price of the stock. Hence oR > (oD if
y < 1.
D. The Risk Premium and the Conditional Variance of Returns
From the results about risk premium and return volatility, it is clear that
the relationship between return volatility and expected returns DEMO ambigu-
ous and depends on the degree of investors' uncertainty. This DEMO can
be made precise by noticing that from equations (11) and (19) we can write
IJR =
R2- yVO[1
+ (he + hD)V0].
(20)
It is apparent then that the relationship between the conditional risk pre-
mium and the conditional variance of returns is DEMO but investors' uncer-
tainty biases this relationship through V0 in an DEMO way. In fact, the
second term in equation (20) can DEMO positive or negative depending on the
magnitude of V0. Specifically, for DEMO or when signals are very precise,
Vo is approximately zero and hence a linear positive relationship results.
In contrast, when y > 1 and signals are not precise, the second term
in equation (20) is positive for - 1/(h2 + h2) < V0 < DEMO and negative for V0 <
- 1/(h2 + h2). Since the magnitude of V0 changes over time due to investors'
DEMO level of uncertainty, equation (20) implies that there is no DEMO
cise relationship between expected excess returns and conditional volatility.
Indeed, the DEMO finance literature has long documented that the evi-
dence for a positive relationship between expected returns and conditional
return variance is very weak at DEMO (e.g., see Campbell et al. (1999) and
Scruggs (1998)).
IV. Conclusions
This paper shows that the relationship between the precision DEMO public
information about economic growth and the performance of the stock market
is nontrivial. In a standard Lucas economy where the growth rate of DEMO
is unknown but where investors receive signals about it, I obtain DEMO on
Information Quality and Stock Returns
823
equity premium and return volatility that DEMO be deemed counterintuitive at
first: (i) More precise signals on DEMO true state of the economy-that is,
better information-tend to increase the equity premium. Therefore, poor
information does not demand a risk premium. (DEMO) If information is impre-
cise, then an increase in the risk aversion coefficient does not necessarily
increase the equity risk premium. In fact, there is an upper bound to the
equity risk premium. Moreover, higher uncertainty (i.e., poorer signals) im-
plies that the upper bound is achieved for a lower coefficient of risk aversion
y. (iii) When DEMO are imprecise, return volatility is U-shaped with re-
spect to investors' coefficient of risk aversion. (iv) The relationship between
expected returns and DEMO volatility is ambiguous and depends on inves-
tors' level of uncertainty.
DEMO channel through which the precision of public information affects stock
returns is its influence on the equilibrium covariance between current con-
sumption and returns. DEMO fact, there is a qualitative difference between div-
idends and "other statistics" as signals of future economic performance: Though
"other statistics" DEMO only investors' expectations, dividend realizations also
affect investors' consumption possibilities. DEMO, the implied covariance be-
tween consumption and return is modified as DEMO change the precision of
external signals.
A few final remarks are in order. First, the model implies that when the
external signals are not precise the conditional expected excess return may
become negative when the coefficient DEMO risk aversion is high. This occurs
when investors' uncertainty increases. The DEMO factor also decreases the
dividend yield, thereby generating a positive relation DEMO dividend yield
and expected returns. A very low dividend yield may be associated with a
negative risk premium (e.g., see Lamont (1998))DEMO
Second, the empirical literature has had a hard time determining the DEMO
lationship between expected returns and their conditional variance (see, e.g.,
Campbell et al. (1999) and Scruggs (1998)). Result (iv) justifies this finding:
Investors' fluctuating uncertainty over time about the DEMO growth rate of
the economy makes this relationship ambiguous because it introduces a bias
that is at times positive (for low level of uncertainty) and at times negative
(for high level of uncertainty).
Third, the model developed in this paper assumes that investors have a
power DEMO function. This choice enables me to obtain a simple closed-form
solution for asset prices but it imposes also a specific relationship between
investors' degree of relative risk aversion and their elasticity of intertempo-
ral substitution, the latter being the reciprocal of the former. This strict
relationship makes it DEMO difficult to interpret exactly the comparative stat-
ics results obtained in this paper. Nonetheless, the basic intuition developed
in the model is likely to remain even under a more general utility function.
In fact, an increase in risk aversion would still imply that investors' hedging
demand for assets increases after bad news in dividends, thereby counter-
balancing the negative pressure in prices due to the negative dividend news.
With a power utility DEMO this effect is strong because a higher risk aver-
824
The Journal of Finance
sion implies a lower elasticity of intertemporal DEMO, which in turn
also increases the demand for the assets after DEMO shocks in dividends.
In fact, negative dividend innovations signal lower future DEMO, which
in turn implies higher savings to smooth out consumption. The DEMO bal-
ance between the two effects can only be assessed by using a more general
utility function, such as Epstein and Zin (1989); this investigation is an
interesting topic for future research.
Finally, this DEMO investigates a particular type of quality of information:
information about economic growth. There are other types of information
that are certainly relevant and DEMO are also worth investigating. These may
include information about future volatilities or correlations for example. The
effect of "information quality" on these variables DEMO have different impli-
cations on stock returns than the one discussed here. Also, it would be in-
teresting to study how information quality about different firms' growth
prospects affects their stock returns. The relationship between the cross sec-
tion of returns and investors' information has been already addressed in the
Bayesian CAPM literature (see, e.g., Barry and Brown (DEMO)). However, a
model of intertemporal learning is still missing. One of the effects that we
can reasonably expect is that equilibrium "betas" would tend to change over
time as uncertainty fluctuates and investors' DEMO their hedging demand
for stocks.

(DEMO, see Karlin and Taylor (1975), p. 151). Both g and E can be functions of
X. Then, the proposition of Theorem 9.1 in Liptser and Shiryayev becomes:

dW = (1'< )-1/2 (dX - fdt).
The proof of this claim is identical to that of Liptser and Shiryayev's Theo-
rem 9.1 after DEMO obvious changes are made. Similarly, Liptser and Shiryayev's
Theorem 9.2 DEMO that under some technical conditions equation (Al) ad-
mits a unique nonnegative strong solution.
Finally, in order to obtain equation (5), DEMO define X = (D,e)', ILi = (OiD,Oi)',

Proof of Lemma 3: (a) For given vector (n,. .. O n7 zj= Cj is a con-

i increases from 1 to n, we must have DEMO / j Cj monotonically decreasing
with i. Since we must also have Cj/>jn=j>7Tj Cj > 1 > Cn /j=> 1 j Cj, it follows
that there is a k such that 7iT= (DEMO /Ejn. 7TjCj),7i > 7Ti for i < k and 7T
(Ci1jjn=l 17jCj)G7i < 7-i for i - k. Since 61 < 02 < * < 6n, the average of the
Ois using the distribution ( ...... ,T*) must be smaller than using the distri-
DEMO (lTi ... , rn) because the former gives more weight to low 61s and less
to high Ois than the latter distribution; that is, m* < in. Hence, V=

Ci is monotonically strictly increasing in i.

To conclude the proof of Proposition 3(DEMO), notice that if mo > oD2 + 01 then,
from equation (A32), (dm*/de) > 0, and the result DEMO part (i), a continuity
argument yields the result.
Similarly, if

(7D 7 ( y 1)2 2 -D
where again y* is the upper bound of y implied

by the
?
condition (A14), then
Hence from equation (A32) and the result of part (ii), a continuity argument
yields the result.
(c) The result follows from LR = Y(O-2 + V0) and the fact that m0 = -
MO - 01 - mi. Indeed, if mo > oD2 + 01 by continuity there is a y such DEMO
IR < 0 for y > j/. Moreover, for a DEMO y, part (a) shows that a mean-
preserving spread decreases DEMO Hence, a negative risk premium can be ob-
tained for a DEMO risk aversion coefficient when the distribution is more
diffused. Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 4: Part (a) is immediate from the fact that o-RsiS a pa-
rabola with respect to Vo and the fact that Vo DEMO monotonic decreasing in y.
For part (b) the claims holds if 2 + (he + hD)V6 < 0 for a high enough y.
From the proof of Proposition 3(c), as y increases, Vo -- 01 - mo. Hence, by
continuity, it is sufficient DEMO show that 2 + (h2 + h2) (01- _MO) < 0; that is,
2 ~2(2Joe2_ =
MO- 01 > h2

2 , ).
This condition is satisfied if DEMO > o-D + 01 (the condition in Proposition 3(c))
whenever the expression in parentheses is less than one-that is, when
he> hD. Q.E.D.
