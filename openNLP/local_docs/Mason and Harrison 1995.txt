Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap:
The Role of Informal Venture DEMO
Colin M° Mason
Richard Z Harrison
ABSTRACT. There is evidence from a number of countries
that small firms encounter a shortage of long-term investment
DEMO, particularly at start-up and initial growth. Expea~sion
of the institutional venture DEMO industry has done little to
fill this "equity gap" on account of its preference for making
large investments in established companies and manage-
DEMO buyouts. Moreover, the supply of venture
capital exhibits a high level DEMO spatial concentration. Initiatives
by state/provincial and local governments, most notably DEMO
economically lagging regions, to increase the supply of risk
capital for DEMO and early stage businesses have at best
provided a very partial, DEMO often costly, solution. A more
appropriate approach to increasing the supply DEMO start-up and
early stage finance is to facilitate the more efficient opera-
tion of the informal venture capital market. Informal investors,
or "business angels", are private investors who provide risk
capital directly to new DEMO growing businesses in which they
have no family connection. Most business angels are unable
to find sufficient investment opportunities and so have sub-
stantial DEMO funds available. There is also consider-
able scope for expanding the population of business angels.
The most cost-effective means of closing the equity gap
DEMO therefore for the public sector to underwrite the operating
costs of business introduction services whose objective is to
overcome the two main sources of DEMO in the informal
venture capital market, namely the invisibility of business
DEMO and the high search costs of angels seeking investment
opportunities and entrepreneurs seeking investors, by the pro-
vision of a channel of communication between informal
investors and entrepreneurs seeking finance.

DEMO
Various studies show that the availability and
cost of finance, especially DEMO investment
capital, is one of the most important constraints
on the DEMO and development of small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Oakey, 1984;
Monck et at., 1988; Binks et al., 1992; CBI, t993;
EVCA, 1993a). Obtaining finance is particularly
difficult for new and recently established firms,
fast-growing businesses and technology-based
businesses. Access to DEMO stock markets is
precluded to the vast majority of smaller busi-
nesses because of the high fixed costs involved
(Buckland and Davis, 1989) while reliance on debt
finance leads to dangers of undercapitalisation,
which DEMO the most frequent cause of business
failure (Binks and Vale, 1992).
The expansion of venture capital activity in
most developed countries during DEMO past 10 to 15
years has provided a new source of long-term
investment capital which has contributed to the
closing of this equity gap. DEMO capital cm-~ be
defined as an activity by which corporate investors
provide long-term equity finance, supported by
business skills, to unquoted companies with DEMO
potential to grow rapidly with the aim of making
an evenvaat capital gain commensurate with the
high risk and illiquidity involved in the investment
DEMO than interest income or dividend yield. The
venture capital industry is therefore characterised
by a high rejection rate as very few businesses can
demonstrate DEMO they have the potential to provide
annualised rates of return of 30 to 60 per cent
which are typically sought. Venture capitalists
devote considerable DEMO to evaluating potential
investments and undertaking all possible 'due
154

diligence' in order to filter out poor investments.
Venture capital activity is also a "hands-on"
activity: the venture capitalist will typically have
an active involvement in the management of the
business receiving the finance, both to contain
potential down-side exposure and also to "add
value" to the investment. Finally, venture capital
investments require an identifiable exit route to
enable the venture capitalist DEMO realise their invest-
ment (Lorenz, 1989; Mason and Harrison, 1991;
Murray, 1991 a).
Venture capital activity originated in the USA
immediately after World War Two but expanded
enormously during the 1980s as DEMO result of
changes in tax and securities legislation. In 1979
there were about 225 venture capital firms which
invested $460 million in 375 companies. DEMO its
peak in 1987 over 700 venture capital firms
invested $3.94 billion in over 1700 companies. By
the end of the decade this level DEMO activity had
fallen back a little with over $3 billion invested
in over 1300 companies (Bygrave and Timmons,
1992). A similar expansion in venture capital
activity occurred during the 1980s in a number of
DEMO countries which had little or no prior expe-
rience of this form of financial activity. In Canada,
the venture capital industry expanded between
DEMO and 1990 from 20 firms with a pool of $350
million to about 75 firms and a pool of $3.3bn
(MacDonald, 1991). DEMO the UK prior to 1979
there were about 20 venture capital companies
with a total investment of £20 million. By 1992
there were well DEMO 100 venture capital firms
which invested £1.25bn in 1147 companies (plus
DEMO further £183m in 149 companies in other
countries) (BVCA, 1993)DEMO There has also been
an increase in venture capital activity in other
European countries (EVCA, 1993b). Indeed,
Europe has overtaken the DEMO in terms of venture
capital investments (EVCA, 1993a), with a total
of ECU 4.7 billion ($1 -- 1.13 ECU) invested in
DEMO companies in 1992 (EVCA, 1993b)
Venture capital and the equity gap
The venture capital industry has had a catalytic
role in the DEMO process by identifying,
financially supporting and nurturing growth-
minded businesses with entrepreneurial talent to
start-up and grow. The evidence for this is most
DEMO cut in the USA. Bygrave and Timmons
(1992) note that venture capital-backed companies
have added value through technological and
market innovations, while their economic contri-
butions have included significant job creation, new
R&D expenditures, export sales and payment of
taxes. World class technology companies such as
Digital Equipment Corporation, Apple Computer,
Sun Microsystems, Lotus, Compaq and Prime
Computer as well as market innovators such as
Federal Express and DEMO Inc were backed by
venture capitalists at their start-up. In Europe
too, venture-capital backed companies have, in
aggregate, experienced above average rates of
employment growth, with the EVCA describing
such companies as "engines for DEMO economies"
(EVCA, 1993a, p. 4). At a sub-national DEMO
an active local venture capital industry has played
a critical role in the development of "high-tech"
clusters such as Silicon Valley and Route 128
(Florida and Kenney, 1988a; Bygrave and
Timmons, 1992).
DEMO, the venture capital industry is in a
process of change throughout DEMO developed
world. The industry has contracted in recent years
in terms of the amounts of finance raised and
invested, the investment focus of the industry has
shifted and there are marked spatial variations in
the availability DEMO venture capital. These develop-
ments have raised the concern that developed
economies "'may be losing the unique company
building skills that have been DEMO vital to the entre-
preneurial process" (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992,DEMO
p. 66). Moreover, this has occurred during a period
of DEMO when the need for such skills is at
its greatest. We examine each of these issues in
turn.
Size of the venture capital pool
DEMO first aspect of concern is that the rapid growth
of venture capital activity came to a halt in the
late 1980s. Since then amounts DEMO and invested
have both fallen and there has been a shake-
out in the number of venture capital firms. For
example, venture capital firms in the UK have
experienced difficulties in raising additional funds
since 1989 DEMO a result of the increasing concern
of institutional investors about the future returns
from venture capital activity. Indeed, the longer
Closing the Regional
Equity Capital
Gap
155
term availability of funds is DEMO single most impor-
tant concern of venture capitalists. The immediate
consequence has been greater competition for the
scarce supply of institutional funds. Most venture
DEMO believe that these conditions will result
in a shakeout, with poor DEMO and marginal
funds likely to exit the industry (Murray, 1991a;
1991b). Moreover, given the two or three year
time-lag between creating a new fund and making
investments, it is likely that this drop in new funds
will be reflected in a reduced value of annual
DEMO from the mid-1990s onwards (Murray,
1995). The UK experience DEMO reflected elsewhere
in Europe: new funds raised by the European
venture DEMO industry peaked in 1989 at ECU
5.8m, falling to ECU 4.2m DEMO 1992 (EVCA,
1993b). Similar trends are also apparent in DEMO
USA where venture capital activity has declined
sharply since 1987 (Bygrave DEMO Timmons, 1992).
There was a recovery in 1992, although activity
remains well below the peak levels of the 1980s.
In Canada a DEMO of seasoned venture capital
firms with a proven track-record have also been
unable to raise new funds (Doyle, 1993).
Investment focus
Significant DEMO in the investment focus of the
venture capital industry is the second issue for
concern. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the
emphasis DEMO the venture capital industry was on
early stage and technology-based businesses.
However, the contemporary industry is now
dominated by later stage deals, and DEMO
management buyouts (MBOs)/leveraged buyouts
(LBOs)o In the UK DEMO number of start-up and
early stage investments has fallen from the
400--500 range in 1988 and 1989 to 222 in 1992.
More significantly, start-ups and early stage
investments have fallen as a proportion of all
investments DEMO around 30 per cent in the mid-
1980s to just 17 per cent in 1992 and from 20--30
per cent of the total amount DEMO to just 6 per
cent over the same period. Meanwhile, MBOs
DEMO increased since the mid-1980s to account for
well over half of the total amount invested by
venture capital funds in recent years (65 per cent
of the total amount invested in 1992) (Pratt, 1990;
BVCA, 1993). Thus, the venture capital industry
is increasingly specialising DEMO the provision of
replacement equity, whereby existing shareholders
are bought out DEMO replaced by new shareholders,
while its role in the provision of new equity to
start-ups and early stage businesses has become
increasingly marginal (Murray, 1994).
These trends are a product of two factors.
On the one hand, they reflect the evaluation and
monitoring costs which must precede and accom-
pany venture capital investments. These represent
a significant fixed DEMO element and so makes it
uneconomic for funds to make investments of less
than about £250,000 (indeed, Batchelor (1993)
suggests that initial accountancy and legal fees,
for example, are unlikely to be less than £50,000
to £70,000, irrespective of the size of the prospec-
tive investment). On the other hand, they reflect
the attractions of providing development capital to
larger, established businesses and investing in
management buyouts. Such investments involve
known businesses with a track-record and a
DEMO future, in usually well-understood, and
frequently mature, industry sectors, and the com-
petence of the management teams can be judged
on the DEMO of their track-record (Murray, t 994).
As a consequence, DEMO involve lower risks,
require less appraisal and monitoring, provide
more DEMO for high fee income and have a quicker
exit route than most other types of investment.
Most of the venture capitalists in Murray's DEMO
survey expected that MBOs would continue to
dominate UK venture capital activity during the
1990s (Murray, 1991a).
The sectoral focus of UK DEMO capital funds
has also shifted away from its initial emphasis on
technology-related investments. Since the mid-
1980s technology investments have become a
specialist activity DEMO by a small minority
of venture capitalists. Computer-related and elec-
tronic-related companies accounted for 30 per cent
of the finance invested in 1984 compared DEMO just
4 per cent in 1992, with investments in medical
and DEMO accounting for a further 3
per cent of finance invested. Investments by UK
venture capital funds are now concentrated in
consumer-related sectors (Pratt, DEMO; BVCA,
1993). The reason for this shift is simply DEMO
technology investments are perceived by most
venture capitalists as more risky than the available
later stage investment opportunities. As a result,
technology projects DEMO a higher IRR threshold
156
Colin M. Mason and Richard T. Harrison
when compared with non-technology DEMO at
the same stage of financing and have to demon-
strate a supra-national market potential (Murray
and Lott, 1992).
Similar shifts in DEMO investment focus of venture
capital funds away from early stage deals and
technology-based sectors are also apparent in
continental Europe (EVCA, 1993b), DEMO
(Government of Ontario, 1990; Standeven, 1993)
and the USA. In the USA the number of start-
up financings and the amount DEMO have
both fallen significantly since the early 1980s.
Proportionately, such investments DEMO declined
from 43 per cent of all investments to just 10 per
cent between 1983 and 1989. Other early stage
investments have also declined, although not as
severely. Paralleling this trend has been an
increase in DEMO number of deals and the amount
invested in expansion financings, LBOs DEMO other
later stage deals. Bygrave and Timmons (1992)
attribute these DEMO to the displacement
of "classic" venture capital by "merchant capital"DEMO
funds. Classic venture capital is concerned with
early stage investments and involves skills that
add value in company forming, building and har-
vesting; DEMO capital funds, on the other hand,
are almost entirely dependent DEMO institutional
investors, emphasise financial engineering know-
how, transaction crafting and closing and fee
generation, and are obsessed with short-term
gains. There has also been a shift in the sectoral
pattern of investments in favour of DEMO
related deals (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992),
although the US DEMO capital industry remains
more committed to technology-related sectors than
its European and Canadian counterparts.
Spatial focus
The third issue concerns spatial variations in the
DEMO of venture capital. Studies in various
countries highlight the very high degree of spatial
concentration of both venture capital firms and
investments in core DEMO and the lack of invest-
ments in peripheral, economically lagging regions.
DEMO the UK, 63 per cent of venture capital compa-
nies are DEMO in London (BVCA, 1992). This is
a result of historical and institutional forces.
London has long been the pre-eminent financial
centre in DEMO UK, containing various financial and
related institutions and a diverse range DEMO invest-
ment expertise and business consultancy services.
As the venture capital industry is a further spe-
cialist division of the finance industry it was
DEMO that it should be concentrated in
London. Most of the funds have either been estab-
lished by banks and insurance companies located
in London DEMO else are spin-offs, established by
finance-industry executives and located in London
DEMO reasons connected with the pool of profes-
sional labour and existence of agglomeration
economies (Martin, 1989). The dominance of
London is even DEMO in terms of the proportion
of the total venture capital pool managed by funds
located in the city (Mason and Harrison, 1991;
DEMO, 1992). However, there has been a modest
growth in the number of venture capital funds in
provincial cities, such as Manchester (DEMO,
1991; Mason and Harrison, 1991), but from a very
small base. The South East has also consistently
attracted a disproportionate share DEMO venture
capital investments, accounting for 45 per cent of
the total DEMO invested in 1992. Conversely,
with the exception of Scotland, all DEMO regions
have attracted a lower share of venture capital
investments than "DEMO" on the basis of their
proportion of the national stock of DEMO
(BVCA, 1993; Mason and Harrison, 1991; Martin,
1989; 1992).
Similar spatial patterns are apparent in other
countries. In Canada DEMO capital firms are con-
centrated in Toronto, the main financial centre,DEMO
and, to a lesser extent, in Montreal and Calgary
and investments clearly favour the Toronto region
(McNaughton and Green, 1989; McNaughton,
1991). In the USA venture capital firms are con-
centrated not DEMO in financial centres but also in
centres of high technology industry. Silicon Valley,
California, the Route 128 area around Boston,
Massachusetts and New York City together
account for 70 per cent of the venture DEMO
supply. Less important though still significant con-
centrations of venture capital firms are located in
Chicago, Connecticut, Texas, Minneapolis and
Colorado. Investments are mainly concentrated in
California and Massachusetts which account for
over half of DEMO investments (Florida and Kenney,
1988a; 1988b; Florida and Smith, 1990; 1993;
Florida et al., 1991).
Demand side factors DEMO a major role in
Closing the Regional Equity
Capital
Gap
157
accounting for this spatial pattern. DEMO, the
geography of venture capital investments closely
parallels the locational distribution DEMO rapid-
growth firms (Mason, 1985; Wheeler, 1990).
Some commentators suggest that the lack of
demand for venture capital in peripheral regions
DEMO the greater reluctance of firms in such
regions to seek equity finance (Gibbs, 1991).
Others suggest that demand for venture capital
is DEMO by the dominance of lifestyle busi-
nesses in such regions (Economic DEMO of
Newfoundland and Labrador, 1988). It is also sug-
gested DEMO firms in peripheral regions lack infor-
mation about financing alternatives and have
limited understanding of the role of equity and
how to raise it, a failing which reflects the limited
knowledge of banks, accountants and other pro-
fessional intermediaries in such regions about
sources of venture capital and DEMO factors which
venture capitalists take into account in assessing
investment proposals (DEMO North West Working
Party, 1989).
However, there is also an independent supply-
side influence on the location of venture capital
investments arising DEMO the spatial organisation
of the venture capital industry and the percep-
tion of venture capitalists (Martin, 1989; 1992).
Venture capitalists rely on personalised, informal
and therefore localized information networks
with other venture capitalists, DEMO, large
company contacts, consultants, technical experts
and a range of DEMO actors to identify invest-
ment opportunities, organise deals and mobilize
resources. DEMO a result, most investments are
made in companies located relatively close DEMO
venture capitalist's office. Investing in businesses
located in fairly close spatial proximity also
enables venture capitalists to more easily monitor
their investments, thereby limiting risk (Florida
and Kenney, 1988b). Venture capitalists' per-
ceptions arising from their mental maps of eco-
nomic potential may also exert DEMO influence on
their spatial search for investment opportunities
(Mason, t987). The effect of these explicitly
geographical factors is to constrain the spatial
DEMO of venture capitalists (Thompson,
1989).
The consequence is that DEMO a region has a
well-developed concentration of venture capital
funds of its own, then the further it is away from
the main centre, DEMO centres, of venture capital
activity the more disadvantaged will be its DEMO
entrepreneurs in terms of access to this type of
finance. In the UK context this means that "the
further a region is from London, the more impor-
tant it is for that region to have its own circuit of
venture finance" (Martin, 1992, p. t65).
DEMO
The consequence of these trends is that there
are now various "DEMO" in the supply of venture
capital, Companies at the seed, DEMO and early
stages of development and requiring external
financing encounter great difficulties in raising
equity f;mance from the venture capital industry.
This raises DEMO concern that growth~potential
businesses, particularly those involved in tech-
nology-based activities, will be constrained by the
lack of appropriate sources of risk capital. DEMO
are reluctant to lend to businesses with no assets,
and in any case the financing needs of such busi-
nesses are likely to DEMO inappropriate for debt
finance (Binks et aI., 1992). Alternative financing
options (such as factoring) are typically only
open to more mature DEMO with an ability
to generate cash. This problem is particularly
acute in less developed regions which lack an
indigenous venture capital industry, mad threatens
the viability of regional economic development
policies which are increasingly based on DEMO pro-
motion of indigenous development via SMEs
rather than the attraction of mobile investment.
This is, for example, the main emphasis of
regional DEMO policy in the UK (HM Govern-
ment, 1988; Wren, 1990) and of the Atlantic
Canada Opportunities Agency (Savoie, 1992;
ACOA, 1992).
Mechanisms to close venture capital gaps
State/provincial and local governments, particu-
larly in regions lacking an indigenous venture
capital industry, DEMO responded to these concerns
with a variety of initiatives designed to stimulate
the supply of start-up and early stage finance° The
objectives of this DEMO are, first, to critically
review the impact of such initiatives as mecha-
nisms for stimulating the supply of local sources
of venture capital DEMO start-ups and early stage
158
businesses and for technology-based firms and,
second, to suggest that the promotion of informal
venture capital - i.e. direct investments by private
DEMO, or "business angels", in companies in
which they have no family connection - provides
a better basis for closing both national and
DEMO "equity gaps". In this section we provide
a brief review DEMO "conventional" approaches
that have been adopted, drawing largely upon
examples DEMO policy initiatives in the UK, USA and
Canada. We suggest that DEMO initiatives have had
only a limited impact in closing these various
capital gaps. In the following sections we high-
light the merits of informal DEMO capital and
propose ways in which the supply of informal
venture capital can be stimulated.
Strategies for increasing the regional supply of
equity capital DEMO be classified into three broad
types.
Tax incentive schemes to stimulate private sector
venture capital funds
One approach, which is only possible in countries
where states/provinces have the power to raise
taxes, is the use of tax incentives to encourage
private sources of finance for investment in DEMO,
either directly or indirectly via pooled funds. This
approach has been widely used in Canada where
every province has a provincially-sponsored
venture capital DEMO (PSVCC) scheme,
modelled on Ontario's Small Business Develop-
ment Corporations (SBDCs). A PSVCC is a
pooled investment vehicle which raises money
from investors for investment in approved busi-
nesses. Most schemes provide DEMO in a
PSVCC - who can be private individuals or cor-
porations - with either a cash grant or tax credit.
However, some schemes provide the PSVCC with
an equity loan on the basis of dollar-for-dollar
DEMO with the amount of equity invested by
its shareholders (Moncton Consulting DEMO,
1991).
Globerman and Olson (1986) suggest that such
schemes have had a favourable outcome in terms
of the amounts raised and DEMO, the addition-
ality achieved and the emphasis on start-up and
early DEMO investments. An evaluation of PSVCCs
in Atlantic Canada also concluded that they are an
effective means of enabling small businesses to
Colin M. Mason DEMO Richard T. Harrison
raise venture capital. Indeed, PSVCCs are the
most DEMO source of venture capital in the
region (Moncton Consulting Services, 1991;
ACOA 1992). However, this assessment went on
to conclude that "PSVCCs are no panacea"
(Moncton Consulting Services, 1991, p. DEMO). They
have often been single company investment
vehicles and have tended to make passive invest-
ments. There have also been difficulties in
successfully DEMO from their investments which,
in turn, has hindered their ability DEMO re-cycle their
funds. As a result, PSVCCs have often run out DEMO
funds after making their initial round of invest-
ments. This lack of liquidity also appears to have
deterred some potential investors. PSVCCs have
also DEMO a low propensity to provide follow-on
finance (Moncton Consulting Services, 1991;
ACOA, 1992). A further criticism is that although
PSVCCs were conceived to be market driven, with
governments adopting a hands-off approach, DEMO
practice they have, in some instances, "fallen prey
to political DEMO bureaucratic agendas.., where
'public accountability' has sometimes introduced
other criteria." (ACOA, 1992, pp. 83-84).
Public sector venture capital funds
In many countries local and state/provincial gov-
ernments have little or no DEMO of taxation to
influence the supply of venture capital. A much
more common approach is the establishment of
public sector venture capital funds using DEMO
sources of finance to make direct investments in
companies. In the USA, Thompson and Bayer
(1992) have identified 28 public venture capital
funds in 20 states, predominantly in the Northeast
and Midwest. In the UK, seven public sector
venture capital funds (all of which are in DEMO
or Northern Ireland) are listed in the BVCA
Directory or in DEMO Venture Capital Report Guide
to Venture Capital (Cary, 1993). There are a
further five funds which were originally created
by local authorities, but following the 1989 Local
Government and Housing Act which restricted
local DEMO involvement in various forms of
economic development initiatives, these funds
have DEMO restructured to become independent
of local authorities by widening the number of
investors in these funds (Roberts and Miller,
1993). In Canada, venture capital is provided by
Closing the Regional Equity Capital
Gap
159
provincial Crown Corporations and agencies. DEMO
Atlantic Canada such sources accounted for over
one-third of venture capital investments by value
between 1980 and 1990 (Moneton Consulting
Services, 1991; ACOA, 1992).
Public sector venture capital funds have a
number of significant shortcomings and deficien-
cies which limits their effectiveness in filling these
capital DEMO First, public sector venture capital
funds generally have limited resources. As DEMO
result, their impact has often been modest.
Thompson and Bayer (t992) note that the aggre-
gate activity level and average programme size of
public sector venture capital programmes in the
USA remain very small compared DEMO the private
venture capital sector. Similarly, in the UK public
sector DEMO capital funds represent a very small
proportion of total venture capital activity; for
example, investments by public sector venture
capital funds account for DEMO 2 per cent of the
total amount invested (at cost) by UK venture
capital firms. With the exception of the funds that
are DEMO by Scottish Enterprise (formerly the
Scottish Development Agency) and the Welsh
Development Agency (which represent the major
source of venture capital in their respective
regions), public sector venture capital funds are
small compared to DEMO venture capital funds.
One of the implications may be the inability of
such funds to provide follow-on financing to their
investee businesses.
There must DEMO be doubts about the ability of
the public sector to maintain even this modest con-
tribution as a source of venture capital in the
DEMO Thompson and Bayer (1992) point to the
vulnerability of public sector venture capital funds
in the US to budget cuts because of their DEMO of
a political constituency and possible pressures for
privatisation, with the DEMO that this will
result in a shift away from the current focus of
most funds on small scale, early stage investments.
A similar concern is voiced by MacDonald (1991).
Referring to the Canadian situation she argues that
public sector venture capital funds are "clearly not
a tenable solution over the longer term since
government cannot sustain itself fiscally or DEMO
ically as the primary source of equity capital
for young Canadian technology companies, nor
should it attempt to do so" (MacDonald, 1991,DEMO
p. 14).
Second, in many cases the investment focus of
DEMO sector venture capital funds has not been to
fill the gaps left by private sector funds. Rather,
their investment focus and operation often DEMO
them indistinguishable from private sector venture
capital funds. This is particularly the case in the
UK where the privatisation of the former local
authority "enterprise boards" and government
pressure on Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh
Development Agency to operate their venture
capital funds on a broadly commercial basis DEMO
exacerbated this feature. A detailed breakdown of
the investments of nine public sector venture
capital funds is provided by Cary (1993): seven of
these funds had made the majority of their invest-
ments in established DEMO seeking develop-
ment finance and management buyouts (and so
their average DEMO size is towards the upper
end of the equity gap) and DEMO two funds had
concentrated the majority of their investments in
start-ups and early stage businesses. Moreover, the
appraisal process of UK public sector venture
capital funds is no less rigorous than that of
private sector funds; indeed, they often review a
smaller proportion of the propositions they receive
tban private sector venture capital firms (Mason
and Harrison, 1991).
DEMO, public sector venture capital funds are
generally restricted to making investments DEMO
the jurisdiction which has provided the finance.
However, placing geographical restrictions DEMO the
investment activities of public sector venture
capital funds is likely to constrain the deal flow,
increasing the chance that poor quality invest-
DEMO are made, causing the fund to perform
poorly. However, if no geographical restrictions
are imposed then investment funds may flow to
areas with DEMO investment opportunities, thereby
depleting local resources (Florida and Kenney,
1988a; Florida and Smith, 1990).
Fourth, providing finance is just a small part
of what venture capitalists do. The success of
investing is DEMO contingent upon the suppoA
services that venture capitalists can provide to
their investee businesses (Florida and Kenney,
1988a). New and recent start-ups in particular
require the active participation of venture capital-
ists. Murray (1991a) suggests that start-ups are
likely to require at least 200 hours of input from
a venture capitalist a year - more if the business
160
Colin M. Mason and Richard T. Harrison
is in difficulties. This DEMO the number of invest-
ments that a venture capitalist can handle to a
maximum of five or six. However, public sector
venture capital funds are likely to encounter
difficulties in recruiting sufficient staff with
entrepreneurial and DEMO experience, particu-
larly if, as is likely, they are unable DEMO match the
reward structure of private sector funds which
allows (in DEMO cases, requires) venture capi-
talists to invest their own money alongside the
fund so that they can share in the success of the
DEMO businesses.
Fifth, the activities of public sector venture
capital funds are DEMO to influence by politicians
and bureaucrats. This allows for the possibility
that investment decisions may take into account
political imperatives rather than being made
DEMO on the basis of commercial criteria
(Florida and Kenney, 1988a).
Sixth, there is a risk that public sector venture
capital activity will compete with private sector
funds for good investment opportunities, and con-
sequently driving up valuations, depressing returns
and ultimately crowding-out private sector funds.
Discussing the Canadian situation, Doyle (1993,
p. 20) notes that "DEMO entering the venture capital
field, the provinces felt they would provide DEMO
incentive for other venture capital companies...
to enter the high risk end of the investment
spectrum. However, if an in-depth study were
done, DEMO would probably show that they are driving
them away".
Finally, DEMO and Kenney (1988a) emphasise
that simply enhancing the supply of venture
capital is not sufficient for an increase in venture
capital activity. They DEMO out that venture capi-
talists - whether operating in the public or private
sector - are critically dependent upon technical,
social and financial DEMO to locate invest-
ments, structure deals and support investee busi-
nesses. DEMO, public sector venture capital funds
need a supportive institutional environment of
DEMO support services, notably specialised
law and accountancy firms, in order to be effec-
tive. In support of this argument Florida and
Kenney (1988a) point out that public sector
venture capital funds have been most successful
in regions where there is an active private venture
capital industry.
Subsidising DEMO operating costs of private sector
venture capital funds
Another approach to increasing the supply of seed,
start-up and early stage capital is to DEMO a
subsidy to private sector venture capital funds to
offset their appraisal and monitoring costs. One of
the major reasons for the lack of DEMO sector
venture capital funds specialising in seed and start-
up investments is that such investments require a
very active hands-on role. As a result, they incur
high costs and uncertain returns. The appraisal of
small investment DEMO and the management
of a portfolio of small investments requires almost
as much input of professional and other resources
as those which are several DEMO larger, while the
professional fees that can be commanded are lower
DEMO the risks are much greater. Indeed, the need to
make a DEMO number of investments in order to
get a reasonable spread of risk further contributes
to the high appraisal and monitoring costs of seed
and DEMO funds. The British Venture Capital
Association (BVCA) has estimated that the real
cost of running a seed fund is between £150,000
and DEMO,000, depending upon its location, which
represents an unacceptably high proportion of
the funds under management (BVCA, 1989). It
is therefore DEMO for venture capital funds
specialising in seed and start-up investments to
operate under conventional commercial criteria.
The objective of the subsidy is to make DEMO type
of investment activity an economic proposition for
private sector organisations.
This approach has been adopted by the
European Community by means of its DEMO
Capital Initiative. This initiative, which has initial
funding of approximately ECU DEMO, has sup-
ported the establishment of 24 new seed capital
funds DEMO the Community, including three in the
UK, by contributing towards their operating costs
(up to 50 per cent) and capital resources (up to
25 per cent). The intention was that the funds
would DEMO self-financing within five years.
However, this initiative has had only limited
DEMO Murray (1995) suggests that the funds are
too small to be sustainable without ongoing EC
support and few have the financial resources to
DEMO successive rounds of follow-on finance
that is required by successful and rapidly growing
young companies.
Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap
16 t
An alternative approach is DEMO British initiative,
formally launched in November 1991 by Business
in the Community, to establish a network of
regionally-based development capital funds and
professional advisory networks. The intention was
for each regional enterprise fund to be DEMO up with
a life of ten years and a maximum of 20 corpo-
rate investors drawn from and investing in the
region. The key DEMO of this initiative was that,
in order to alleviate the burden of professional
fees and vetting costs which have previously made
it unprofitable DEMO provide equity finance in small
amounts, professional firms (fund managers,
stockbrokers, solicitors, accountants and bankers)
will waive up to 60 DEMO cent of their fees to
undertake investigative work on serious projects
(DEMO, 1991). However, this scheme - which
has also encountered fund-raising problems - also
seems likely to have only a limited impact on DEMO
equity gap in the UK, firstly, because the number
of investments that are anticipated is limited
(about 15 per region), and secondly, because the
primary investment focus of the funds will be to
provide finance for the expansion of existing busi-
nesses (McMeekin, 1991).
DEMO approach, exemplified by the BJU
scheme in Germany and the PPM DEMO in The
Netherlands, is for government to assume part
of the DEMO of investment losses when venture
capital firms invest in types of businesses or
sectors which are considered to have wider
economic or technical benefits. DEMO, this
approach may encounter the moral hazard situa-
tion, encouraging venture capitalists to make less
prudent investments by removing the "risk" from
DEMO investments.
An alternative approach: Improving the
efficiency of the informal venture DEMO
market
A more promising strategy for increasing the
supply of start-up and early stage venture capital
is the promotion of informal investment which, it
can be argued (e.g. Walker, t989), is more appro-
priate DEMO venture capital as a source of early
stage finance. Informal investors - alternatively
termed private venture capitalists but more
commonly referred to as 'business angels' - are
private investors who provide risk capital directly
to new and growing businesses in which they have
had no prior connection (i.e. it excludes invest-
ments in their own firm or in a family DEMO)°
Comparisons of informal investors in the
USA, UK, Canada and Sweden reveal few signif-
icant differences in their characteristics, invest-
ment preferences and investment activity (Wetzet,
1981; Tymes and Krasner, 1983; DEMO etaL, 1988;
Gaston, 1989; Riding and Short, t987a; DEMO;
Short and Riding, 1989; Venture Economics, 1990;
Harrison DEMO Mason, 1992a; Landstr6m, 1993;
Riding et at., 1993). Business angels are almost
exclusively male and mostly in the 45+ age DEMO
The vast majority are either business owners,
company directors or business-related profes-
sionals (eg accountants, consultants). Most are
also experienced entrepreneurs, often having
founded several businesses. They are generally
self-made and have a DEMO net worth (although rel-
atively few are in the super-rich category) (Table
I). On account of their employment background
angels have a fair degree of financial sophistica-
tion and are capable of evaluating the DEMO and
risks of prospective investments (WetzeL 1987).
There are three DEMO reasons why the informal
venture capital market should be supported by
policy-makers: the nature of the investments made
by business angels, the localized DEMO of their
investments and the overall size of the market.
(i) Business angels invest precisely in those
areas in which institutional venture capital DEMO
viders are reluctant to invest. They typically make
small investments, well DEMO the minimum size
of investment considered by most venture capital
funds. In the UK the vast majority of angels invest
less than £50,000 DEMO a single deal (although deal
sizes that involve investments that are DEMO
between a number of investors are larger) (Mason
et aL, DEMO) (Table !I). A study of sources of
external equity sources used by new technology-
based firms in New England found that private
DEMO provided 84 per cent of financing rounds
under $250,000, compared DEMO 13 per cent by
venture capital funds, but only l0 per DEMO of
rounds of over $1 million compared with 69 per
cent by venture capital funds (Freear and Wetzel,
1988).
Investments by private investors are also rela-
tively more concentrated in start-ups and early
stage DEMO whereas most venture capital funds

provide development DEMO and finance for man-
agement buy-outs and buy-ins (Table II). DEMO,
business angels are often the only source of early
stage equity capital for businesses that have
exhausted personal and family sources. More than
DEMO of investments by Canadian business
angels are in the seed, start-up DEMO early stages
(Venture Economics, 1990). In their study of new
technology-based firms in New England Freear
and Wetzel (1988) found that DEMO investors
outnumbered venture capital funds by two-to-one
at seed and start-up stages. They conclude that
"private individuals and venture capital funds
appear to play complementary.., roles... Private
individuals are most prominent at the early stages
of a firm's development, when relatively small
amounts are involved, and DEMO those later stage
financings involving under $1 million" (Freear and
Wetzel, 1988, p. 353).
Informal venture capital is also "smart money".
Business angels are value-added investors, con-
tributing their commercial skills, DEMO
experience, business know-how and contacts
through a variety of hands-on roles (Table II). One
study of firms that had raised finance from
DEMO investors (Harrison and Mason, 1992b)
identified a wide range of support, monitoring and
~trategic roles played by business angels in their
in vestee companies. Entrepreneurs regarded the
angels' role as a sounding board for the manage-
ment team as being their most valuable "hands on"
contribution. The opportunity to be involved in an
entrepreneurial venture is a DEMO motivating
factor for angels making informal venture capital
investments, as well DEMO a means of protecting their
investment.
(ii) Business angels are much more geograph-
ically dispersed that venture capital funds. Gaston
(1989) suggests DEMO angels live virtually every-
where, although in view of their entrepreneurial
DEMO they are likely to be most numerous
in regions with a large SME sector. UK evidence
indicates that business angels are found throughout
the DEMO although, as might be anticipated,
are over-represented in the south (Mason et al.,
1991a) and have invested larger amounts (£35,DEMO
compared with £19,000 in the three years pre-
ceding the survey). Furthermore, investments by
business angels are characterised by a high level
of geographic localisation. A majority of all such
investments are made in DEMO located within
50-100 miles of the investor's home or office
(DEMO II). This is largely a reflection of the 'hands
on' nature of such investments, although is also a
function of superior information available about
investment opportunities close to home. Thus,
from a regional DEMO perspective informal
investments are valuable because they help to
retain and re-circulate wealth within a region,
counteracting the effect of most investment mech-

(iii) In terms of its size, the informal venture
capital market is the largest single source of risk
capital for entrepreneurial companies, substan-
tially dwarfing the institutional venture capital
industry. Wetzel and Freear (1993) note that in the
USA the DEMO of the informal venture capital
market is at least five times that of the institutional
venture capital market in terms of dollars invested
annually DEMO is at least twenty times larger in
terms of the number of ventures financed. Gaston
(1989) suggests that informal investors provide
capital to DEMO 40 times the number of firms
receiving investments from professional venture
capital funds, and the amount of their investments
almost exceeds all other sources of external equity
capital for new and growing small businesses
combined. Estimates DEMO the UK suggest that
SMEs have raised about £2 billion from the
informal venture capital market. By comparison,
Bannock (1991) estimates that DEMO formal venture
capital industry has some £1.25bn invested in
SMEs in the UK, suggesting that the informal
venture capital market is almost twice as impor-
tant to the SME sector as formal venture capital
(Harrison and Mason, 1993).
The potential scale of the informal venture
capital market is considerably greater than these
figures suggest. First, a number of research studies
confirm that most business angels cannot find suf-
ficient investment opportunities DEMO meet their
criteria and so have substantial amounts of finance
available for informal investments. A survey of
informal investors in the UK found that DEMO
quarters would have invested more in the last three
years if they had come across a greater number
of suitable investment opportunities. On average,DEMO
these investors had a further £50,000 available for
investment. In aggregate, the sample of informal
investors had up to £10 million available for
investment, equivalent to three times the total
amount that they had invested during the previous
three years (Mason et al., 1991a). A DEMO of
business angels in Scotland also found that they
have excess funds. However, it was not possible
to put a figure on the amount available because
the angels questioned in the study claimed not to
set DEMO specific sums for specific investment
purposes (KPMG, 1992). In the USA, Gaston
(1989) found that 54 per cent of investors wanted
to invest more than the volume of opportunities
permitted. The surplus funds DEMO these investors
was 51 per cent more than they had invested;
averaged over all investors the amount of uncom-
mitted finance was 35 DEMO cent more than they had
invested.
Many angels contend that there is a shortage
of good quality investment proposals, although
this may be associated, at least in part, with poor
presentation by entrepreneurs. However, short-
comings in the search process by entrepreneurs
and investors also play a DEMO role in con-
tributing to their lack of suitable investment
opportunities. Most informal investors are not able
to devote significant amounts of time to DEMO is
generally a spare-time activity. As a result, most
adopt a DEMO passive approach to the identifica-
tion of investment opportunities, looking in DEMO ad
hoc, unscientific fashion, placing considerable
reliance on friends and business associates for
referrals and they rarely adopt a pro-active search
(Mason et al., 1991a). Thus, there is a large degree
of serendipity DEMO the number and quality of deals
that come to an investor's attention. Studies in
the USA and the UK indicate that a majority
DEMO informal investors are dissatisfied with their
referral sources and believe that there is a need for
improved channels of communication between
investors and businesses DEMO risk capital
(Wetzel, 1981; Myers and Moline, 1988; Mason
DEMO Harrison, 1992a). New entrants to the
informal venture capital market DEMO have taken
early retirement or redundancy, or are returning
ex-patriots, or in some other way are isolated from
informal referral networks, for example, due to
employment background or location, are often par-
ticularly dissatisfied DEMO the available sources of
deal flow (KPMG, 1992). UK research indicates
that investors in the peripheral regions express the
greatest dissatisfaction with DEMO existing referral
sources. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are hampered
in their search for DEMO sources of venture
capital by the anonymity which most informal
investors strive to preserve. As Gaston (1989,
p. 1) has observed, both the search by a business
for an investor, and the search by an investor for
Closing the Regional Equity
Capital
Gap
165
an investment opportunity "can be... expensive,
time-consuming affair[s]. The search is studded
with pitfalls and dead DEMO that often result in
failure and frustration". This, in turn, leads him
to describe the informal venture capital market as
"a giant game of hide-and-seek with everyone
blindfolded" (Gaston, 1989, p. 4)DEMO
Second, as Freear and Wetzel (1992) note,
"virgin angels" - individuals with the same self-
made, high net worth characteristics DEMO active
angels but who have not, for whatever reason,
entered DEMO informal venture capital market as
individual investors - considerably outnumber
active investors. According to Freear et al. (1992)
the number of high net worth individuals - defined
as a net worth of $1 million or DEMO - in the USA
has been estimated to be about two million, of
whom 80 to 90 per cent are self-made. They go on
to point out that the self-made characteristic of the
high net worth DEMO is significant "because
it implies that many of them have acquired DEMO
kind of experience.., that it takes to start, manage
and harvest a successful entrepreneurial venture.
In a sense, their entire professional careers
have prepared them to conduct the due diligence
necessary to evaluate the merits DEMO the risks of
prospective investments and to add the value of
their know-how to the ventures they bankroll"
(p. 5). However, DEMO and Freear (1993)
estimate that there are about 200,000 DEMO in the
USA. Thus, there are up to ten times as DEMO
virgin angels as active angels. Riding and Short
(1987a) estimate that active angels in Ottawa-
Carleton comprise only 5 per cent of those DEMO
similar demographic characteristics. The number
of active business angels is therefore only a small
fraction of the potential number of private
investors.
Research by DEMO et al. (1992) in New
England indicates that with the right enticements
over half of virgin angels could become active
investors in entrepreneurial DEMO A small-
scale survey of virgin angels in the UK indicates
that their inability to identify firms which require
finance is the main reason DEMO they have never
invested in entrepreneurial companies. Other fre-
quently cited factors are the high risks involved,
concerns about exit routes and their DEMO of exper-
tise to appraise investment opportunities (Mason
and Harrison, 1993a). A slightly different set of
factors for not investing emerge from DEMO virgin
angels that KPMG (1992) briefly discussed in
their study of the informal venture capital market
in Scotland. Their conclusion was that these DEMO
viduals were not active in the informal venture
capital market principally because of unacceptable
risks and a lack of tax benefits. Four factors there-
DEMO seem relevant in seeking to convert virgin
angels into active investors (DEMO and Harrison,
1993a). First, virgin angels would be prepared
DEMO invest in companies where they knew the
management team personally, a DEMO factor in
reducing the perceived risk factor in an investment
(Binks DEMO aL, 1992). Second, virgin angels might
be willing to invest if they received information
from a trustworthy source on companies which
wish DEMO raise finance. The availability of tax incen-
tives is a third factor that might encourage virgin
angels to invest. Both the KPMG (1992) DEMO and
also US findings have noted that reduction in the
capital gains tax would be the most influential
factor in inducing virgin investors to DEMO
active investors (Freear et aL, 1992). Finally, US
evidence DEMO that opportunities to participate
with other, more experienced, investors was
seen by virgin angets as a major inducement to
becoming active (Freear et al., 1992). In contrast,
UK virgin angels were not influenced by this con-
sideration, a finding that is consistent with the
much lower levels of syndication of investments
reported by active informal investors in DEMO UK
compared with their US counterparts (Harrison
and Mason, 1992a).
Research findings from a number of countries
therefore clearly indicate that there DEMO considerable
scope for assisting those angels with substan-
tial uncommitted sums of money available for
informal investments in finding suitable invest-
ment opportunities and DEMO for increasing the
population of business angels. The policy impli-
cation is therefore that efforts to increase the
supply of small amounts of venture DEMO for
start-up and early stage ventures, especially in
areas where institutional DEMO of venture
capital are lacking, should be directed towards ini-
tiatives DEMO will overcome the information gap
between entrepreneurs seeking finance and
business angels seeking investment opportunities.
We consider an appropriate mechanism in the
following section.
166
Business introduction services: A mechanism
for stimulating the informal venture capital
market
The most promising strategy to promote informal
venture capital involves the DEMO of
business introduction services - or "financial
marriage bureaux". There DEMO examples of such
services .in the USA, Canada, the UK and
Scandinavia (see examples in Harrison and Mason,
1995). Business introduction services attempt to
overcome the two major sources of inefficiency in
the DEMO venture capital market, namely the
invisibility of business angels and the DEMO search
costs of angels for businesses and businesses for
angels, by DEMO a channel of communication
between informal investors and entrepreneurs
seeking finance. This enables entrepreneurs to
bring their investment proposals to the attention
of a DEMO of private investors simultaneously
and provides investors with a timely and confi-
dential means of identifying and examining a
range of investment proposals.
The DEMO straightforward approach to "'match-
making" is through the production and DEMO
tion of an investment bulletin giving a brief
description of companies seeking capital which is
circulated to potential investors. Another method
involves investor forums DEMO which entrepreneurs
seeking to raise finance make short presentations
to an audience of potential investors. A more
sophisticated approach involves computer match-
ing which DEMO pioneered by the Venture Capital
Network which was established in New England
in 1984 (Wetzel, 1984; Foss, 1985; Freear and
Wetzel, DEMO).
The experience of business introduction organ-
isations in the USA and Canada suggests that such
services cannot be operated as a profit-making
activity. DEMO creation and rapid disappearance of
a considerable number of private sector match-
making services in the UK in recent years would
also seem to DEMO the difficulty of operating
such an activity on a commercial basis. A business
introduction service requires professional staff to
market the service to businesses DEMO potential
investors and to provide counselling and advice to
businesses seeking to register with the service. A
business introduction service will also require a
DEMO marketing budget. The main source of
Colin M. Mason and Richard T. Harrison
revenue for business introduction services is the
subscription fees levied on DEMO and investors.
Operators have set fees for investors and busi-
nesses in the £100/$200-$300 range on the
assumption that potential clients would be
DEMO to pay significantly higher charges. The
amount of revenue that can be generated from sub-
scription fees is therefore limited and unlikely to
be DEMO to cover the operating costs of a
business introduction service. Thus, DEMO
introduction services have had to rely on govern-
ment funding, or, in its absence, sponsorship from
the corporate sector and their sponsoring organi-
zations (eg chambers of commerce, universities).
Venture Capital Report, a UK private sector
initiative, has sought to operate profitably by
charging the business a "success fee" calculated
on the basis of the risk DEMO raised (defined
broadly to include loans and loan guarantees) in
addition to the standard subscription fees levied
on businesses and subscribers to the DEMO
However, this method of raising revenue has not
enabled VCR to DEMO on a commercial basis
(Cary, t992). Moreover, many US DEMO Canadian
commentators argue that it is inappropriate for
business introduction services to have any finan-
cial interest in the outcome of the negotiations
which DEMO the introduction since it might be
perceived by businesses and investors as com-
promising their impartiality, while any attempt to
run a business introduction service on a for-profit
basis is likely to reduce its credibility amongst
DEMO investors and firms (Mason and Harrison,
1992b).
Business introduction DEMO remain at the
experimental stage and so far most have had only
modest success in unlocking the substantial sums
of uncommitted money that most DEMO angels
have available. This is illustrated by the case of
LINC, DEMO UK initiative which currently operates
through local enterprise agencies in nine localities.
It has a small client base which has recently sta-
bilized at DEMO 200 investors and about the
same number of businesses. This reflects LINC's
low awareness amongst informal investors, small
business owners and professional intermediaries
(e.g. accountants, bankers, solicitors) (Mason
et al., 1991b; KPMG, 1992) which is, in turn, a
function of its lack DEMO financial resources which
has limited its marketing and promotion efforts,
Closing the Regional
Equity
Capital
Gap
167
allied to its patchy geographical DEMO Many
LINC agencies do not even have any dedicated
staff or marketing budget to promote the service
locally. More fundamentally, the scale of informal
investment activity resulting from LINC's endeav-
ours has been limited. Between DEMO and mid-
1993 only about 80 businesses have raised finance
from informal investors to whom they were intro-
duced through LINC, with the total investment
amount-ing to £3.75 million. Thus, participation
in LINC has not significantly enhanced the ability
of investors to find suitable investment opportu-
nities. Indeed, 86 per cent of LINC investors
would have invested more if they DEMO come across
sufficient investment opportunities. They had an
average of £100,000 still available for investment.
In aggregate, the amount that the sample of LINC
investors had available for investment exceeded
the amount that they had DEMO during the pre-
ceding three years by some 40 per cent (DEMO
and Harrison, 1993b).
Computerised business introduction services
in the USA DEMO Canada have also had a limited
impact on the flow of informal venture capital.
With only a few exceptions computerised match-
ing networks have DEMO limited success in attracting
investors and entrepreneurs, with an average
(based on responses from 10 networks) of just 42
investors (ranging from DEMO to 163) and 73 entre-
preneurs (ranging from 3 to 223). These low
figures are attributed partly to the short time
period DEMO most have been operating but primarily
to their limited budgets which has restricted their
marketing efforts to the production of a brochure
and little DEMO (Brown and Stowe, t991).
VCN's performance in recruiting investors and
clients is more impressive, reflecting its longer
period of operation, DEMO demonstrates the poten-
tial of business introduction services. VCN has
attracted a cumulative total of approximately 1200
entrepreneur clients and about 800 im,'estor clients
over the period 1984 to 1990. About 35,000 initial
computer DEMO resulted in about 3500 investor
requests for introductions to entrepreneurs.
Moreover, DEMO out of every four entrepreneurs
have received at least one introduction to a poten-
tial investor, and most have received five or
six introductions. However, only a small number
of successful matches appear to have resulted.
VCN is aware of only 31 companies which have
successfully raised finance DEMO investors to
whom they have been introduced, although it
should be DEMO that this will be an under-estimate
as, under Securities and Exchange DEMO
regulations governing the operation of the service,
VCN cannot do any systematic follow-up of the
results of meetings between investors and entre-
preneurs DEMO must rely on ad hoc word-of-mouth,
third party and press reports of successful matches
(Wetzet and Freear, t995).
Thus, while the concept of a business intro-
duction service remains sound the way in DEMO
it has been implemented has been sub-optimal.
Case studies of various business introduction
services in North America and the UK highlight
four factors critical DEMO their success (Mason and
Harrison, 1992b; Wetzel and Freear, 1995). First,
there is a need to build a critical mass DEMO investor
and entrepreneur clients. Private investors are a
diverse and dispersed group who are difficult to
reach through traditional marketing techniques. A
business introduction DEMO is an unfamiliar
concept. Like all such concepts it does not imme-
diately sell itself and requires to be explained,
ideally on a DEMO basis (Wetzel, t987).
Various studies indicate that when the concept of
a business introduction service is explained, the
majority of business angels express an interest
in participating (Wetzel, 1981; Riding and Short,
1987a). Building a client base of businesses is less
problematic. The DEMO here is to attract
quality business opportunities and filter out busi-
nesses that are obviously "lemons" (Riding et aL,
1993): without a flow of good quality investment
opportunities, it is unlikely that business intro-
duction services will be able to retain their
investor clients for DEMO long. Recruiting investors
and entrepreneurs to a business introduction
service therefore requires energy, creativity and
missionary zeal (Wetzel and Freear, 1995). The
key is to achieve high visibility and credibility
in the local/regional DEMO community, for
example, by speaking engagements at all kinds
of professional and civic organisations, developing
networks with organisations that can be a source
of high quality referrals and maximizing public
relations opportunities that will lead DEMO articles
in newspapers and magazines and coverage on
TV and radio. Inevitably this takes time to
achieve.

Second, business introduction services must be
well resourced. Since it is not possible to run a
DEMO introduction service on the basis of fees
from investors and entrepreneurs alone (Mason
and Harrison, 1992b) they must rely on public
sector support and/or sponsorship. Their effec-
tiveness depends upon the size of their DEMO
Brown and Stowe (1991) have demonstrated
that there is a direct correlation between funding
and the number of investors and entrepreneurs
recruited to DEMO service. Few of the match-making
services that they studied in the USA had suffi-
cient funding to allow any marketing beyond pro-
ducing information DEMO However, without
sufficient funding it is not possible to run an
DEMO high profile marketing campaign which
is necessary to maintain a flow of new investors
and investment opportunities.
Third, a business introduction service should
not rely on passive approaches to match-making.
Successful match-making is a very hands-on DEMO
pro-active process: "passive networks drop the
ball just when the real work begins" (De Jordy,
1992, p. 208). KPMG (DEMO) report that the
business angels in their study would welcome
some DEMO of prior vetting of investment oppor-
tunities. However, Wetzel, who founded VCN,
argues against vetting on philosophical, practical
and regulatory grounds (DEMO and Freear, 1995).
From a philosophical position investors them-
selves DEMO be presumed to be the best judges
of investment opportunities and entrepreneurs
should be advised to do their own evaluations of
potential investors. The DEMO consideration is
the cost of employing qualified staff to screen
investment proposals and investor qualifications.
Finally, the decision not to undertake any screen-
ing enabled VCN to operate without registering
as an investment advisor or broker/DEMO with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, VCN did recognise DEMO investors and
entrepreneurs need information about the process
of making investments. In response to this need,
it has run a series of workshops DEMO to raise
investor and entrepreneur competence and confi-
dence in their ability to negotiate the price and
other terms and conditions of a venture DEMO
ment. Workshops for investors have included such
issues as structuring equity investments, valuation
and exit routes while those for entrepreneurs have
covered the issue of "dealing with investors"°
These workshops have also been effective in
enhancing VCN's visibility and credibility and in
reaching potential clients (Wetzel and Freear,
1995).
Finally, we believe that in order to be credible
with both investors and firms a business intro-
duction service DEMO to be managed by a
respected but disinterested third party with broad-
based community support which operates on a not-
for-profit basis. Examples include DEMO enterprise
agencies, chambers of commerce (as in the case
of COIN in Canada), universities (as in the case
of VCN in the US) and Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) (as in the DEMO of the DTI
informal investment demonstration projects in the
UK). Both entrepreneurs and investors need to
be comfortable that the managers of a DEMO
introduction service are genuinely interested in
fostering local economic development, have DEMO
vested interest in encouragiug inappropriate
matches and would maintain strict confidentiality.
Such organisations also need to have a high profile
in the local community, be well networked and be
perceived by investors and entrepreneurs as acces-
DEMO and approachable (Government of Ontario,
1986).
Conclusion
There is DEMO agreement that an equity gap
exists for companies seeking small amounts of
risk capital which constrains the development of
the SME sector. While this DEMO a national problem,
evident in the UK, USA and Canada, it is par-
ticularly acute in peripheral regions which lack
an indigenous DEMO capital industry. Various
policy initiatives designed to increase the regional
supply of venture capital have, at best, provided
only a partial, and costly, solution. In these
circumstances, encouragement of the informal
venture capital market DEMO an important
option for small firm policy-makers. The pool of
informal venture capital is already significant, and
there is considerably scope for expanding the
size of this pool, but it is largely untapped by
SMEs because of inefficiencies in its operation.
To expand the informal investment market, there-
fore, requires a mechanism which overcomes the
high search costs incurred by investors in seeking
Closing the Regional Equity Capital Gap

investment opportunities and entrepreneurs seek-
DEMO private investors. The most appropriate means
of achieving this objective is through the estab-
lishment of a network of locally or regionally
based business DEMO services. By providing
an efficient channel of communication between
business angels and entrepreneurs this can help
improve investment flow from both active and
virgin DEMO
The experience of existing business introduc-
tion services indicates that their impact is a
function of three key factors. First, they must be
well-resourced. In view of the economics of oper-
ating such services, which are unlikely to be
capable of operating on a non-subsidised, for
profit-basis, DEMO sector support will be required.
This can be justified in terms of the wider
economic and technical benefits that will arise by
enabling businesses DEMO overcome the financial and
know-how constraints to start-up and growth.
Moreover, DEMO financial commitment required is
minuscule compared with the costs of alternative
strategies for closing the regional equity gap.
Public sector support for a business DEMO
services therefore gives "a bigger bang for the
buck". Second, business introduction services
must devote considerable energy and creativity to
the ongoing DEMO of the service to potential
investors and entrepreneurs. Third, they need DEMO
undertake pro-active matching, including pro-
viding training courses to teach investors DEMO
techniques for successful venture investing and
entrepreneurs the techniques for successfully
raising venture capital.
However, it is important that local and regional
efforts to promote informal venture capital by
means of business introduction services are
undertaken DEMO the context of supportive national
government initiatives. First, it is important DEMO
measures are enacted to make the treatment of
equity investment in unquoted companies no less
favourable than other forms of saving and invest-
ment. DEMO treatment of capital gains and the avail-
ability of roll-over relief for capital losses are
particularly relevant in this context. Second, the
regulation of investments (Financial Services Act
in the UK and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the USA) should have sufficient
flexibility so as not to deter informal venture
capital activity.
