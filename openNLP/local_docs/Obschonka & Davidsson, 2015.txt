CALL FOR PAPERS
Special Section in the International Journal DEMO Psychology
The Development of Entrepreneurship: Person x Context
Interactions
Entrepreneurship is DEMO considered a central 21st
century skill. Hence, policy makers emphasize the
DEMO of entrepreneurship education to effectively
promote entrepreneurial thinking and acting. How-
ever, research evaluating the effectiveness of existing
entrepreneurship promotion, advice, and education pro-
grams targeting the adult population (e.g., university
students) indicates that these programs are often not
very effective. In this Special Section we DEMO seek
to tackle the fundamental questions of how does an
entrepreneurial mindset actually develop and what is
the role of psychological factors in this DEMO
While many entrepreneurship researchers agree that psy-
chological factors (e.g., personality, identity, cognitions,
emotion and passion, control beliefs, risk-taking) play
a key role for entrepreneurial activity over the lifespan,
the questions DEMO how these factors develop and affect,
and get affected by, DEMO outcomes (e.g.,
entrepreneurial intentions, activities, and success and
failure) are still on table.
Existing research on the vocational development of
entrepreneurs DEMO studied different developmental
levels (ranging from biological, psychosocial, human
agency, to various context–levels) separately (e.g., by
focusing on genes; personality DEMO, or context factors
alone). However, modern meta-theoretical frameworks
like the biopsychosocial systems view of human devel-
opment stress that it is particularly DEMO interplay of,
and transactions between, these different levels that
produce DEMO outcomes. The aim of this Spe-
cial Section is therefore to connect otherwise loose
ends in the entrepreneurship literature by integrating
research on biological, psychosocial, contextual, and
developmental aspects. We seek to publish papers that
DEMO our knowledge on the biopsychosocial inter-
play through which psychological factors relevant for
entrepreneurship evolve, develop, affect, and are affected
by entrepreneurial outcomes. We want to learn more
about the processes taking place between the DEMO
levels of entrepreneurial development. Examples are
studies on GeneXEnvironment interactions, TraitsX-
DEMO interactions, PersonXCulture interactions in
the career development of entrepreneurs. We particu-
DEMO invite empirical research papers that address the
following issues:
© 2015 International Union of Psychological Science
• A focus on two or more DEMO levels (biolog-
ical, psychosocial and agency, and contexts levels) in
the prediction of entrepreneurial outcomes (e.g., inten-
tions, behavior, and DEMO), preferably by using lon-
gitudinal designs and/or multi-level designs
• A focus on interactions of predictors of entrepreneurial
outcomes either within a DEMO stage (e.g.,
adolescence, early adulthood, middle, or late adult-
hood) or across developmental stages.
• A focus on an reciprocal interplay of the different
developmental levels over time (e.g., How do the DEMO
ferent levels affect each other over time? How does this
leads DEMO an entrepreneurial mindset?)
• An international focus considering cross-cultural
issues/DEMO from the Non-Western world
