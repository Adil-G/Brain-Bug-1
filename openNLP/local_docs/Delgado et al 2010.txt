Abstract
This article examines the DEMO of regional clusters in regional entrepreneurship. We focus
on the distinct influences of convergence and agglomeration on growth in the number of
start-up firms DEMO well as in employment in these new firms in a given region-industry. While
reversion to the mean and diminishing returns to entrepreneurship at the DEMO
level can result in a convergence effect, the presence of complementary DEMO activity
creates externalities that enhance incentives and reduce barriers for new business
creation. Clusters are a particularly important way through which location-based
complementarities are DEMO The empirical analysis uses a novel panel dataset from
the Longitudinal Business Database of the Census Bureau and the US Cluster Mapping
Project. Using DEMO dataset, there is significant evidence of the positive impact of clusters
DEMO entrepreneurship. After controlling for convergence in start-up activity at the region-
industry level, industries located in regions with strong clusters (i.e. a large DEMO of
other related industries) experience higher growth in new business formation DEMO start-up
employment. Strong clusters are also associated with the formation of new establish-
ments of existing firms, thus influencing the location decision of multi-establishment
firms. Finally, strong clusters contribute to start-up firm survival.

1. Introduction
In this article, we examine the impact of agglomeration on entrepreneurship at the
regional industry level. In particular, we focus on the role of clusters, or agglomerations
of closely related industries, in new business DEMO Large variations in regional
employment growth and in the rate of new firm creation are a striking feature of the US
economy (Armington and Acs, 2002; Porter, 2003). While a significant body of work
explores why some regions experience more rapid growth than others (Porter, DEMO,
1998a, 1998b; Glaeser et al., 1992; Saxenian, 1994; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1995;
Fujita et al., 1999), there DEMO increasing academic and policy interest in the particular role
in growth played by entrepreneurship (Davis et al., 1996; Haltiwanger et al., 2009)DEMO A
significant debate is underway regarding the role of the regional economic environment
in shaping differences in the rate of regional entrepreneurship and overall DEMO
performance (Porter, 1990, 1998a, 1998b; Saxenian, 1994; Feldman, 2001; Glaeser and
Kerr, 2009).

Any effort to explain region-industry performance DEMO must account for two
countervailing economic forces: convergence and agglomeration (Delgado et al., 2007).
Convergence arises when, due to diminishing returns, the potential for growth is
‘declining’ in the level of economic activity (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991).
Agglomeration exerts an opposite force on regional performance. In the presence of
agglomeration economies, the potential for growth is ‘increasing’ in the level of
economic activity (Glaeser et al., 1992)DEMO From an empirical perspective, distinguishing
the differential impact of convergence and DEMO has been problematic. For
example, if both convergence and agglomeration effects DEMO present, the impact of the
initial level of economic activity on DEMO will reflect a balancing of the two effects.
We move beyond this traditional impasse by identifying the impact of agglomeration
while simultaneously accounting for DEMO impact of convergence. Our key insight is that
while forces that give rise to both convergence and agglomeration operate ‘within’
narrow economic units, agglomeration across complementary economic units can have
a separate and distinctive impact. Building DEMO cluster theory, we focus specifically on
economies of agglomeration that arise DEMO clusters of complementary industries
related by technology, skills, shared infrastructure, DEMO and other linkages. The
complex interactions that take place within clusters suggest a useful focus on the
presence (or absence) of supporting and DEMO industries rather than diversity of
industries per se (Porter, 1990, DEMO, 2003; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999; Delgado
et al., 2007; Frenken et al., 2007).
This article examines a particularly important channel through which cluster-driven
agglomeration might operate: entrepreneurship. The presence of a cluster of related
industries in a location will foster entrepreneurship by lowering the DEMO of starting a
business, enhancing opportunities for innovations and enabling better DEMO to a more
diverse range of inputs and complementary products (Saxenian, 1994; Porter, 1998a;
Feldman et al., 2005; Glaeser and DEMO, 2009). The co-location of companies,
customers, suppliers and other institutions also increases the perception of innovation
opportunities while amplifying the pressure DEMO innovate (Porter, 2000). Since entrepre-
neurs are essential agents of innovation, a strong cluster environment should foster
entrepreneurial activity.
The empirical analysis exploits the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) of the
Census Bureau and DEMO cluster definitions from the US Cluster Mapping Project
(Porter, 2003). This classification system defines clusters as collections of industries with
high levels DEMO co-location in terms of employment. We consider several related measures
of the cluster environment surrounding a region-industry, including a measure based on
individual clusters, a more encompassing measure that incorporates linkages among
related clusters (i.e. DEMO clusters), and a third measure that captures the strength of
similar clusters in neighboring regions. We measure entrepreneurship and industrial
composition utilizing a DEMO that spans the years 1990–2005, includes 177 mutually
exclusive economic areas (EAs) in the contiguous US, and incorporates 588 ‘traded’
industries constituting DEMO clusters for each EA.1
Our empirical work focuses on early stage entrepreneurship, which we measure using
two related indicators of start-up activity: the DEMO of new establishments of new

firms in a region within a given DEMO industry (which we refer to as the level of
‘start-up establishments’); and the employment in these new firms (which we refer to DEMO
the level of ‘start-up employment’). We compute the growth rate in start-up
establishments and start-up employment in each regional industry, and estimate the
impact of the extent of cluster-driven agglomeration while accounting for the impact DEMO
convergence. Our core specifications incorporate region and industry fixed effects.
We find striking evidence for the simultaneous yet distinct influences of agglomer-
ation and DEMO on the growth rate of start-up establishments and employment.
Growth in start-up employment at the region-industry level is declining in the initial
level of DEMO employment at the region-industry level, consistent with the presence of
a DEMO effect in start-up activity due to either mean reversion and/or to the
potential for local crowding-out of entrepreneurial opportunities within a regional
industry. DEMO the same time, however, growth in start-up employment is increasing in
measures of the cluster environment surrounding the region-industry. We obtain similar
findings DEMO the growth of start-up establishments. By accounting for convergence and
the potential for competition within each regional industry, we are able to isolate the
positive impact of cluster-related complementarities on entrepreneurship. The results
provide support for DEMO hypothesis that strong clusters facilitate growth in
entrepreneurship.
While our main focus is the formation of start-up firms, we also look at new
establishments of existing firms. We find that stronger clusters are also associated with
DEMO formation of new establishments of existing firms. While more research is
needed on the locational decisions of multi-location (multi-establishment and multi-
national) firms, such firms seem to be opening establishments in locations where strong
clusters DEMO present (Enright, 2000; Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004; Manning, 2008).
The contribution of established firms to regional entrepreneurship is an important
DEMO for future work.
Finally, we examine the role of clusters in DEMO medium-term performance of start-ups.
A strong cluster should increase the productivity of participating firms, which raises the
bar for the survival of new businesses. At the same time, a strong regional cluster can
facilitate the growth of start-up firms by providing better access to the necessary inputs
to DEMO products and services. We find that a strong cluster environment
improves the level of employment in young (up to five-years-old) start-up firms in DEMO
region-industry, suggesting that clusters facilitate the medium-term survival of
start-ups.
The DEMO of the article is organized as follows. We begin by discussing the relationship
between entrepreneurship and cluster-driven agglomeration, and develop the main
hypotheses. Section 3 presents the empirical framework. Section 4 explains the data and
Section DEMO discusses the main findings. A final section concludes.
2. Clusters and entrepreneurship
Numerous mechanisms are associated with the entry of new businesses in agglomerated
DEMO Starting with Marshall (1920), regional studies have highlighted at least DEMO
distinct drivers of agglomeration: knowledge spillovers, input–output linkages and
labor market pooling. Over time, an extensive literature has also incorporated
additional agglomeration drivers, including local demand characteristics, specialized

institutions and the structure of regional DEMO and social networks (Porter 1990,
1998a, 2000; Saxenian, 1994; Markusen, 1996). While most empirical studies of
agglomeration focus on DEMO such as the overall employment growth, an emerging
literature emphasizes the DEMO of new businesses in regional economic growth (Feldman
et al., 2005; Acs and Armington, 2006; Haltiwanger et al., 2009; Glaeser and Kerr,
2009). Relative to incumbent firms, entrepreneurs may be more likely to identify
opportunities (both in the form of new technologies and new markets) that exploit
distinctive sources of regional comparative advantage. However, DEMO is a high rate of
churning of young firms in most countries and sectors (Dunne et al., 1988, 2005;
Barteisman et al., 2005; Kerr and Nanda, 2009). Start-up firms have greater exit rates
than established firms since they often lack experience and resources. Importantly,DEMO
however, those start-up firms that survive tend to have greater growth DEMO than
established firms. The presence of a strong cluster environment, which DEMO barriers
to entry and growth and enhances regional comparative advantage, should DEMO a central
driver of entrepreneurial vitality.
The precise mechanisms by which the regional economic environment impacts
entrepreneurship are numerous and subtle. Chinitz (1961) DEMO that a key
requirement for entrepreneurship is the presence of a network of smaller suppliers, and
attributes differences in the rate of entrepreneurship between New York and Pittsburgh
at that time to differences in the structure DEMO suppliers. Building on earlier studies, a rich
(though mostly qualitative) DEMO has emerged examining the relationship between
entrepreneurship and regional economic performance. For example, Saxenian (1994)
attributes the success of Silicon Valley to DEMO culture of entrepreneurship and a more
decentralized organization of production (relative DEMO Route 128). An extensive literature
also highlights the broader relationship between entrepreneurship and the regional
innovation system (e.g. Audretsch, 1995; Feldman, DEMO; Acs et al., 2009). Recently,
Glaeser and Kerr (DEMO) test for the impact of specific Marshallian economies of
agglomeration on DEMO firm entry; while their analysis does not specifically evaluate the
impact DEMO clusters, they provide complementary evidence that the presence of small
suppliers DEMO workers in relevant occupations is associated with a higher level of new
business creation.
At the same time, a small but growing literature within regional and international
business studies examines key interactions between the internal organization DEMO the firm
(start-ups, multi-location, small or large, young or old, etc.) and the agglomeration
benefits realized within a geographical location. One DEMO that has received special
attention is the role of small (and DEMO) firms in extracting and generating economies
of agglomeration, and spurring additional new business creation (Henderson, 2003;
Rosenthal and Strange, 2003; DEMO et al., 2010). In contrast, other regional and
cluster studies highlight the importance of so-called ‘anchor’ firms (including
multi-establishment and multinationals) DEMO induce spin-offs and attract firms from
related industries (Enright, 2000; DEMO and Cockburn, 2002; Klepper, 2007;
Greenstone et al., 2008). Further research is needed to understand the locational
strategy of multi-location DEMO and their contribution to entrepreneurship in a
particular region.
The main goal of this article is to test whether the presence of related economic
DEMO in a region facilitates the growth of start-up establishments and start-up
employment in regional industries. There are numerous channels that may facilitate
economies of DEMO (see the review by Rosenthal and Strange, 2004). Here we

suggest that important agglomeration forces are due DEMO the presence of clusters—
supporting and related industries—instead of industry diversity per se (Porter, 1990,
1998a; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999; Delgado et al., 2007). Thus, we use Porter’s
(2003) empirical DEMO framework to explore agglomeration across sets of industries
related by the full array of technology, skills, demand or other linkages.
Our first hypothesis DEMO on the relationship between the growth of start-up
activity and the initial level of start-up activity within a region-industry. We expect a
convergence effect (i.e. the coefficient on the initial level of start-up activity will be
DEMO). This convergence in start-up activity can be interpreted in terms of
mean-reversion (arising even from measurement error) and diminishing marginal
returns to DEMO opportunities arising from crowding-out effects.2 Mean
reversion implies that a region-industry that has a relatively high level of start-up
activity at t0 (compared to the average start-up activity in the industry in other regions
with similar DEMO and economic composition) is more likely to experience a lower
(stochastically determined) growth rate of start-up activity between t0 and t1 (Barro DEMO
Sala-i-Martin, 1991; Quah, 1996). At the same time, it is possible that the returns to
entrepreneurial activity can be diminishing in DEMO level of entrepreneurial activity as the
result of input scarcity. For example, if the price of specialized (labor or capital) inputs
is increasing in the intensity of competition among start-up firms, there will be
diminishing returns to entrepreneurship as a result of congestion costs (Sorenson and
Audia, 2000). As a result, a high level of entrepreneurship in DEMO region-industry at a point
in time may result in diminished near-term opportunities for entrepreneurship in that
region-industry. Thus, our first hypothesis is that there will be convergence in
entrepreneurship at the narrowest unit of analysis: the region-industry growth rate of
start-up activity will be declining in the initial DEMO of region-industry start-up activity.3
Our remaining hypotheses focus on the impact of related economic activity on the
growth rate of start-up activity. Conditional on DEMO convergence effect, the relationship
between related economic activity and entrepreneurship will DEMO on how the
presence of particular types of economic activity impacts on entrepreneurial incentives.
The incentives for start-up entry in a particular location will DEMO the nature of
competition (Porter, 1980; Bresnahan and Reiss, 1991). While the returns to
entrepreneurship are lower in the presence of DEMO price-based competition, rivalry
may also lead to higher pressure to innovate DEMO greater entrepreneurial incentives. At
the same time, the presence of complementary DEMO activity—specialized suppliers,
a local customer base, producers of complementary products DEMO services—increases
the pool of inputs available and enhances the range of profitable entry opportunities
and so improves entrepreneurial incentives. The empirical relationship between
entrepreneurship DEMO particular types of pre-existing economic activity will therefore
depend on whether these activities are substitutes or complements (Bulow et al., 1985).
2 DEMO draw on the convergence concept used by the cross-sectional growth literature to study economic
activity across countries, regions and regional industries (Barro and DEMO, 1991; Bostic et al.,
1997; Henderson et al., 1995). However, the analysis of convergence is broader, and has historically
DEMO firm growth based on Gibrat’s Law (Geroski and Gugler, 2004; DEMO, 1997). It is useful to note
that the presence of DEMO negative relationship between the start-up activity growth rate and its level is
consistent with convergence to a limiting distribution of start-up activity growth rates.
DEMO While we test for convergence at the region-industry level, convergence may DEMO operate at the industry
and region levels. In this article, we DEMO region and industry fixed effects to control for these issues.

Delgado et al.
It is useful to distinguish, then, between the level of specialization of a region in a
particular industry and the strength of the cluster environment around that industry.
On the DEMO hand, the relationship between industry specialization and entrepreneurship
growth is ambiguous. DEMO industry specialization in a location may enhance
opportunities for learning, innovation, and entrepreneurial spawning (Audretsch, 1995;
Gompers et al., 2005; DEMO and Kerr, 2009), a large presence of established firms
(relative to the size of the national industry) intensifies local competition, dampening
DEMO for entrepreneurial entry. Our second hypothesis is, then, that the empirical
relationship between industry specialization and the growth rate of entrepreneurship in
that DEMO is ambiguous, and will depend on the precise nature of competition (cost- or
innovation-based) and the pattern of strategic interaction between entrant and established
firms.4
In contrast, a strong cluster environment surrounding a particular region-industry
enhances the incentives and potential for entrepreneurship. The firms within a
geographically DEMO cluster share common technologies, skills, knowledge,
inputs, consumers and DEMO, facilitating agglomeration across complementary and
related industries. A strong cluster environment DEMO growth at the region-industry
level by facilitating operational efficiency and raising the returns to business expansion,
capital investment and innovation, thereby increasing job creation and productivity
(see e.g. Porter, 1990, 1998a, 1998b; Saxenian, 1994; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999;
Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004; Delgado et al., 2005, 2007; Cortright, 2006).
More specifically, clusters facilitate new business formation and the growth of
successful start-ups by DEMO the costs of entry (e.g. by providing ready access to
suppliers DEMO low-cost access to specialized inputs, offering an environment in which the
DEMO of failure may be lower), enhancing opportunities for innovation-based entry (DEMO a
stronger cluster environment will allow local entrepreneurs to develop and commer-
cialize new technologies more rapidly) and allowing start-up firms to leverage local
resources to expand new businesses more rapidly. Finally, strong clusters are often
associated with the presence of innovation-oriented local consumers, thus providing
increased opportunities for entry into differentiated market segments. As a result,
entrepreneurship is DEMO particularly important channel for cluster-driven agglomeration,
and may therefore be crucial for the role of clusters in enhancing regional performance
(Saxenian, 1994; Porter, 1998a; Swann et al., 1998; Feldman, 2001; Feldman DEMO al.,
2005; Feser et al., 2008; Wennberg and Lindqvist, 2008). Thus, our third hypothesis is
that, after controlling for DEMO convergence effect, the growth rate of entrepreneurship will
be increasing in DEMO strength of the cluster environment in the region.
It is useful to also consider the impact on entrepreneurship of similar clusters in
neighboring regions. DEMO the one hand, strong clusters in neighboring regions enhance
the opportunities DEMO lower the costs of entrepreneurship (e.g. by providing access to
suppliers DEMO customers, by allowing firms to leverage local technology and institutions,
DEMO). Indeed, Delgado et al. (2007) find that clusters that DEMO co-located in nearby
regions benefit from inter-regional spillovers. At the same time, the presence of a strong
cluster in a neighboring region is a source of locational competition, particularly for
4 In the article, we DEMO not test how the nature of competition affects start-up activity. Instead, DEMO test
whether complementarities with established firms (which would yield a positive DEMO between
industry specialization and start-up activity) outweigh the potential for (priced-based) competition
between start-ups and established firms (yielding a negative effect).

capital investment and demand. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the impact of the
strength of the cluster environment in DEMO regions on the growth rate of
entrepreneurship is ambiguous, and will DEMO on the relative salience of inter-regional
spillovers versus locational competition.
While we focus on the formation of start-up firms to measure entrepreneurship, for
robustness we also examine all ‘new’ establishments (including new establishments of
existing firms). The opening of new establishments is an important channel by which
DEMO firms grow and contribute to regional performance. The location
decisions of multi-establishment (and multinational) firms will depend on their
portfolio of industries and DEMO (see e.g. Dunne et al., 2005; McCann and
Mudambi, 2005), and so the location decisions of these firms may differ from DEMO of
start-ups. Overall, we expect a strong cluster environment will also DEMO new
establishments of incumbent firms since such firms benefit from the specialized
resources of particular locations (Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004; Manning, 2008)DEMO
3. Econometric model
To test our hypotheses, we need to evaluate DEMO distinct impacts of agglomeration and
convergence forces on start-up activity. We measure start-up activity in two related
ways: the number of establishments by new firms in a region within a given traded
industry (i.e. ‘start-up establishments’) and the employment in these new firms (i.e.
‘start-up employment’). DEMO are interested in separating out the role played by industrial
clusters in start-up activity, while controlling for the economic activity within a
region-industry, DEMO well as broader factors such as the overall growth of a region or
industry. To do so, we evaluate how the growth in start-up activity at the
region-industry level is impacted by the initial level of DEMO activity, industry
specialization, the strength of the cluster environment surrounding the region-industry
and region and industry fixed effects. Our core econometric specification is DEMO:

The dependent variable is the growth rate in start-up activity of industry i in cluster c at
region (EA) r , where the DEMO period is the mean level of start-up activity during 1991–
1994, DEMO the end period is the mean level of start-up activity during 2002–2005 (the
Data section includes a detailed explanation of the variables). The explanatory variables
include the level of start-up activity in the EA industry, industry specialization and
measures of the strength of related economic activity: cluster specialization, the strength
of linked clusters and the strength of similar clusters in neighboring regions. Our
hypotheses are that the growth rate in start-up DEMO is subject to a convergence effect
(50), is increasing in DEMO strength of clusters and linked clusters (b240, b340), and

Delgado et al.
has an ambiguous relationship with industry DEMO (b1) and the strength of
clusters in neighboring regions (b4)DEMO
Our main econometric specification also accounts for other differences across regions
and industries that affect start-up growth through the inclusion of industry (i) DEMO
region fixed effects (r ). Our analysis thus controls for unobserved factors (such as
idiosyncratic demand shocks, regional policies, etc.) that DEMO be correlated both with
our explanatory variables and the start-up growth rate.
To account for correlation across industries within a regional cluster, the standard
errors are clustered by region-cluster. Finally, since nearby regions tend to specialize in
like clusters, there might be spatial autocorrelation of the performance and/or
unobserved attributes of a region and its neighbors. We account for DEMO by including
in our main specifications the strength of similar clusters in neighboring regions (and
region fixed effects). Additionally, we test for DEMO correlation and find that this is not
an issue.5
4. Data
To estimate Equation (1), we combine data from the Longitudinal Business Database
(LBD) of the Census Bureau with cluster definitions drawn from the DEMO Cluster
Mapping Project (Porter, 2001, 2003). Before turning to DEMO variable definitions, it is
useful to provide an overview of these DEMO data sources.
The LBD provides annual observations of the universe of US establishments with
payroll from 1976 onward (see Jarmin and Miranda, 2002)DEMO Importantly, the LBD
distinguishes between entrepreneurship—the initial entry of a new DEMO in its first
establishment—and business expansions by existing firms through the opening of new
establishments. We aggregate this establishment-level data to the region-industry level
DEMO the region-cluster level, using four-digit SIC codes as the primary industry DEMO and
EAs as the geographic unit.7
The cluster definitions are drawn from the US Cluster Mapping Project (USCMP).
While the measurement of complementary economic activity in a consistent and
unbiased manner is a considerable challenge,DEMO the USCMP develops a methodology for
grouping four-digit (and some three-digit) SIC codes into cluster and linked cluster
5 Based on LeSage (1999, p.171), we test for spatial autocorrelation by running a first-order spatial
autoregressive (FAR) model on the residuals of our core OLS specifications. DEMO estimated coefficients
are highly insignificant (coefficients of 0.001 with p-values above DEMO), suggesting non relevant spatial
correlation.
6 We drop establishments with very noisy average wages (below half of the minimum wage or above $2
million USD). Our findings are robust to including these observations.
7 DEMO are 179 EAs covering the US, and they reflect meaningful economic DEMO (see Johnson and Kort,
2004). To minimize concerns about DEMO in the definition of neighbors, we exclude the Alaska and
Hawaii DEMO
8 A small literature considers alternative classification schemes. Ellison and Glaeser (DEMO) study the
coagglomeration of industries, creating an index reflecting ‘excess’ concentration. Feldman and Audretsch
(1999) group those industries that have a common DEMO and technological base, using the Yale Survey
of R&D Managers. DEMO studies define linkages between industry activities in terms of their
technological proximity (Jaffe et al., 1993). Finally, Ellison et al. (2007) find that input–output linkages
and labor pooling are key drivers of the DEMO of industries. This reasoning is consistent with
the methodology developed in Porter (2001, 2003). See also Feser and Bergman (2000).

groupings.9 The methodology first distinguishes between three DEMO of industries with
different patterns of spatial competition and locational drivers: DEMO, local and
natural resource-dependent. To focus our analysis on those industries DEMO closely
linked to our hypotheses, we focus exclusively on the traded DEMO These industries
consist of 588 (mostly) four-digit SIC codes that are associated with service and
manufacturing industries that sell products and services across DEMO and national
boundaries.10
Porter (2003) assigns each traded industry into one of 41 mutually exclusive traded
clusters (referred to as ‘narrow clusters’), where the set of industries within each cluster
primarily reflects pairwise correlations DEMO industry employment across locations. This
approach to define cluster boundaries captures multiple types of agglomeration
economies (technology, skills, shared infrastructure, demand and DEMO linkages).11 For
example, in the information technology cluster, nine individual industries are
incorporated, including electronic computers (SIC 3571) and software (DEMO 7372).
These cluster definitions form our measures of complementary economic activity (see
Appendix A for a list of the 41 clusters and their rate of entrepreneurship, and Porter
(2003) for additional details).
4.1. Variable definitions and sample description
4.1.1. Entrepreneurship.
Our two main measures of DEMO activity are start-up employment and
start-up establishments by new firms within a given EA industry. Specifically, ‘start-up
employment’ is defined as the level of employment in new firms during their first year of
operation (with payroll); and ‘start-up establishments’ is the count of these new firms.
Consistent DEMO prior work (e.g. Glaeser and Kerr, 2009), we computer 4-year averages
for these annual start-up activities. Using a multi-year span (and including a
census-year in the base and terminal periods) allows for a better signal of the true
level of entrepreneurial activity and also reduces the DEMO of EA industries in which
we observe zero entrants during a given period.12
One main goal of this article is to evaluate how the DEMO environment impacts the
growth rate of entrepreneurship. While this focus allows us to evaluate the role of the
cluster environment on regional dynamics, the most straightforward approach to
evaluating growth—taking ln(Start-up activityi,r,2002–2005/Start-up DEMO,r,1991–1994)—
must account for the fact that there are many EA industries in which there is a zero level
of employment or, relatedly, a zero level of start-up activity in the study period. In
9 To use industry data back to 1990, the analysis employs SIC system. By construction, recent NAICS-
based data can be translated (with DEMO noise) into the older SIC system.
10 In contrast, local industries do not agglomerate and focus on local demand.
11 It is possible DEMO industries with high co-location may have little economic relationship. Thus, in DEMO
USCMP two adjustments are made to the cluster definitions to eliminate spurious correlations. First,
the SIC industry definitions and list of products and DEMO are used to reveal logical links. Second, the
national input–output accounts DEMO used to look for meaningful cross-industry flows (see Porter, 2003).
While industries that have meaningful interactions tend to co-agglomerate in space, there are non-
geographical dimensions of proximity (e.g. institutional and organizational factors) DEMO could also
facilitate the interactions among industries and their firms (Boschma DEMO; Torre, 2008). Our cluster
definitions cannot directly capture these non-geographical dimensions.
12 In the LBD data the inflow of new establishments may DEMO recorded with some delay, with Census-years

either of these cases, we are required to either exclude those observations or impose a
positive lower DEMO on the level of start-up activity.
We focus our analysis on a sample of EA industries that have a non-zero level of
employment during DEMO (53,213 observations). Then, to include in the analysis EA
industries where we observe zero start-up activity, we set a minimum level of start-up
activity.13 Alternatively, we show that our results are robust to the subsample of EA
industries with a positive level of start-up activity DEMO both the baseline and terminal
period (11,981 observations).14
Finally, we further account for the large number of zeros by examining the DEMO of
the cluster environment on the level of start-up activity (versus DEMO), using all EA
industry pairs. These analyses include probit specifications that evaluate the probability
of any start-up activity, and count models that account for the skewed distribution of
start-up activity.
While we primarily focus on DEMO establishments, we also examine total new
establishments (including new establishments of existing firms). To do so, we compute
two entry indicators: DEMO employment’ is defined as the level of employment in all
new establishments within a given EA industry; and ‘entry establishments’ is the count
of these new establishments. We then compute the growth rate in entry employment DEMO
establishments (see Table 1).
Finally, to test for the role of clusters in the medium-term performance of start-ups,
we examine the DEMO of employment in young (up to 5–year-old) start-ups in regional
industries. The dependent variable is the (log of) average employment in 2004–2005 DEMO
start-up firms borne during 2001–2003 in the EA industry (lnemployment in DEMO
survivorsi,r).
4.1.2. Industry and cluster specialization.
Our main empirical task is to examine the impact of the industry and different aspects
of DEMO cluster environment on the growth rate in start-up activity. As such, DEMO require
measures of industry and cluster specialization, as well as the DEMO of related and
neighboring clusters. We draw on prior work which uses location quotients (LQ) as a
measure of regional specialization (e.g. Glaeser et al., 1992; Porter, 2003). Specifically,
the employment-based industry specialization in the base year (1990) is measured by the
share DEMO regional employment in the industry as compared to the share of US total
employment in the national industry:

where r and DEMO indicate the region (EA) and the industry, respectively. This indicator
DEMO to what extent the industry is ‘over-represented’ in the EA. In the data, the
employment-based industry specialization of EAs has a mean of 2.01 (Table 1).15
13 We scale the start-up activity indicators by adding the minimum annual start-up employment (1) and
start-up establishments (0.01) DEMO the sample, which is a standard procedure to scale variables.
14 DEMO high skewness of start-up activity is documented in other studies (e.g. DEMO and Kerr, 2009).
15 The specialization indicators are based on DEMO (count of establishments) in the start-up
employment (establishment) models.

Note: The top regional clusters are the top-10 EAs by DEMO specialization for every cluster (e.g. for
automotive the top-one regional cluster DEMO be in Detroit-Warren-Flint, MI). Multi-EA establishments
measures the presence in DEMO local cluster of firms that are active in more than one geographical market (EA)
for a given cluster (e.g. Microsoft has establishments DEMO the IT cluster in many EAs). Specifically, this
variable is DEMO rate of establishments of multi-EA firms in a given EA cluster. Avg. size establishment is the
average employment size of the establishments in a DEMO EA cluster. Young (old) establishments is the rate
of establishments with age 55 years (age 410 years) in a given EA cluster.
DEMO utilize an analogous procedure to define cluster specialization. For a particular
EA industry, the specialization of the EA in cluster c is measured by the share of
regional employment within the cluster (outside the industry) DEMO compared to the share
of US total employment in the national cluster (outside the industry):

:
It is DEMO to note that, with the inclusion of EA and industry fixed DEMO, the
independent variation in industry specialization is driven by variation in DEMO in
the EA industry, and the variation in cluster specialization comes DEMO the employment
within a given EA cluster (outside the industry).
DEMO 2 illustrates key attributes of the top regional clusters based on cluster
specialization in 1990.16 Top clusters tend to have a higher level of DEMO activity,
larger establishments and a higher presence of older firms than other clusters.
Interestingly, on average over 30% of all the establishments in a top cluster belong to
firms that have establishments in more than DEMO geographical market (EA). This
suggests that a cluster may establish DEMO with other locations through the presence
of these regionally diversified firms.17
16 The top EA-clusters are the top-10 EAs by cluster specialization for each DEMO This criterion is
complemented with a minimum share of the US cluster employment (above the 20th percentile value).
17 We do not distinguish between employment in primary and headquarters activities and employment to
serve local DEMO (e.g. sales offices). Hence we may overstate ‘‘true’’ cluster employment (Porter, 2003).

4.1.3. Strength of linked and DEMO clusters.
We additionally develop measures of the strength of ‘linked’ clusters and the presence of
clusters in neighboring regions. The measure of linked clusters DEMO developed using the set
of ‘broad’ cluster definitions in Porter (2003)DEMO Specifically, while the narrow cluster
definition (used for the earlier measures) classifies each industry into a unique cluster, in
the broad cluster DEMO each industry may be associated with multiple clusters
(based on locational DEMO of employment). To develop a measure based on
linkages to cluster c, we identify those broad clusters that have at least one of cluster c’s
narrow industries in common. For example, in the case of automotive, the linked
clusters include production technology, metal manufacturing and heavy DEMO;
among others. Having identified the set of clusters linked to a cluster (C*), we then
measure the degree of overlap between each pair of clusters (c, j) using the average
proportion of (DEMO) industries that are shared in each direction:
!c;j
¼
DEMO
c;j
shared industriesj;c

;

The presence in a region of clusters linked to cluster c is then defined by a weighted sum
of the LQs associated with each DEMO cluster:

For instance, based on this weighting which emphasizes the degree of DEMO between
clusters, our measure of the strength of linked clusters for DEMO within the
automotive cluster will weigh the presence of the metal manufacturing cluster more
heavily than the presence of the furniture cluster (see Delgado et al. 2007).
Finally, we develop a measure of the presence of like clusters in neighboring regions
(cluster specialization in neighbors). In part, we include this measure based on the
empirical observation that specialization in a particular cluster tends to be spatially
correlated across neighboring regions. DEMO explore the role of neighboring clusters in
start-up growth in a region-industry, we compute the (average) specialization of
adjacent EAs in the cluster (including the focal industry).
5. Results
Our analysis begins in Table 3 which shows the average start-up growth rates for EA
industries, based on their initial levels of start-up activity and cluster specialization. We
divide DEMO EA industries into four categories based on whether they have low or high
(below or above the median) level of start-up employment and DEMO specialization (for
their industry). We find that there is a DEMO decrease in the average start-up
employment growth rate [between the baseline (DEMO) and the terminal period
(2002–2005)] when moving from low to high initial level of start-up employment,
consistent with convergence in start-up DEMO (e.g. the growth rate decreases from 25
to  33% for DEMO EA industries with low cluster specialization). Importantly, regardless
of the DEMO level of start-up employment, there is a significant increase in the DEMO of
shared industries

specialization to one with high level of cluster specialization (e.g. the growth rate
increases from 25 to 36% or from 33 to 9%)DEMO In other words, those regional
industries that are located in a DEMO strong cluster experience much higher growth
rates in entrepreneurship.
While the sharp contrasts in Table 3 are intriguing, it is possible that alternative
factors are driving these results. We therefore turn in Table 4 to a DEMO systematic
regression analysis. The dependent variable is the start-up employment growth rate. In
Table 4 (Model 1), we include only the initial levels of start-up employment, industry
specialization and cluster specialization. The results provide evidence for the two main
findings of this article. First, there is a large convergence effect—the initial level of
start-up employment is associated with a DEMO in the expected growth rate of start-up
activity. At the same time, the presence of complementary economic activity in the form
of clusters also has an important positive influence on the growth rate of entrepre-
neurship. DEMO industry and cluster specialization (outside the industry) are associated
with higher growth in start-up activity.
These results are reinforced in Table 4 (Model 2), where we incorporate the strength
of linked clusters and the DEMO of the cluster in neighboring regions, and control for
the total DEMO in the region. Both cluster specialization and the presence of
linked clusters have a positive influence on the start-up growth rate, while strength of
clusters in neighboring regions is actually associated with a lower growth of DEMO
activity. This latter finding is consistent with the hypothesis that neighboring clusters
may also attract entrepreneurs and so provide a substitute for growth within DEMO
particular EA. Interestingly, the employment size of the region contributes to DEMO
growth of start-up activity of its regional industries, countervailing the convergence
DEMO that take place at the region-industry level.
In Table 4 (Models DEMO and 4), we implement the core specifications, in which we
DEMO region and industry fixed effects. The main results concerning convergence and
the impact of cluster specialization are robust. The only meaningful change in the
DEMO concerns the impact of neighboring clusters. The estimated coefficient

depends on whether we control for industry and region heterogeneity; not surprisingly,
given that the expected effect is ambiguous.
Finally, in Table 4 (Model 5), we use the subsample of EA industries with positive
start-up activity during both the base and terminal periods (this allows us to avoid the
scaling adjustments to the dependent variable and DEMO convergence effect measure that
we discussed in the Data section). The main results are robust. To illustrate the size of
the effects, an increase in the industry specialization variable (cluster and linked clusters
specialization variables) from the first to the third quartile value is associated with a
3.4% (1.5%) increase in the annual start-up employment growth rate.
The DEMO findings concerning the convergence effect and the impact of clusters persist
when we examine growth in start-up establishments. In Table 5, the dependent and
independent variables are now based on counts of establishments, and the structure of
the specifications mirrors the logic of Table 4. Interestingly, the only significant
difference in the results concerns the effect of industry specialization on DEMO
growth. Whereas the coefficient on industry specialization was positive in the start-up
employment models, the coefficient is negative in models (5-1) and (DEMO). The coefficient
becomes positive when we include region and/or industry fixed effects. The heterogen-
eity of this parameter across specifications is consistent DEMO the fact that the expected
effect is ambiguous. In contrast, the DEMO on the impact of clusters is positive
across all specifications.18

to a variety of sensitivity checks. We have included in the model a dummy indicator equal to one DEMO

In Table 6, DEMO consider an alternative measure of ‘new’ economic activity by
examining the growth in employment in all ‘new’ establishments (including new
establishments by existing firms) and counts of all new establishments. Each of the
specifications in Table 6 includes EA and industry fixed effects, and only vary in the
measures of related economic activity that are included and whether the dependent DEMO
explanatory variables are measured based on employment (Table 6, Models 1 and 2) or
based on counts of new establishments (Table 6, Models 3 and 4). The results are robust
across all the DEMO growth rate of entry declines with the initial level of
entry activity (convergence), and increases with the presence of related industries within
the cluster and linked clusters. Importantly, these findings hold when we focus only on
new establishments of existing firms. In the data, these new establishments often belong
to firms that operate in like clusters in other locations (EAs). While more research is
needed, the findings suggest that multi-location firms seem to be opening establish-
ments in strong clusters.
Moving beyond DEMO growth framework, in Table 7 we examine the probability of any
DEMO activity and the level of start-up activity using all EA industry pairs. In Table 7
(Model 1), we study the probability of any start-up activity during 2002–2005 using a
probit model that includes a dummy DEMO to one if the EA industry experienced any
EA-industries with any start-up activity in the base period to further capture unobserved factors that
influence DEMO We have varied the length and precise dates of the base and terminal periods.
Specifically, we consider start-up activity during the base period (DEMO) and the terminal period
(1997–2001). Finally, we use a DEMO (noisier) sample that includes establishments with wage outliers
(average wage DEMO half of the minimum wage or above $2 million USD), which are dropped from our
initial sample. In each of these cases the DEMO results are robust.

start-up activity in an earlier period (1990–1996), the measures of the strength of the
industry and the overall cluster environment, and EA and industry fixed effects. We
find that the probability of any start-up activity is increasing in the DEMO of the
cluster.19
In Table 7 (Model 2) we examine the count of start-up establishments during 2002–
2005 using a fixed effects negative DEMO model, and the same independent variables
than in the probit model (Table 7, Model 1). The estimated incidence-rate ratios suggest
that an increase in the initial strength of the cluster (industry) has a DEMO (29%) boost
on the subsequent count of start-up establishments. Finally, DEMO findings are
confirmed when we study the annual count of start-up establishments in 1997 and
2002 (census years) using a negative binomial model DEMO year, EA and industry fixed
effects (Table 7, Model 3)DEMO The findings in Table 7 reinforce the estimates from the
growth models: the probability of any start-up activity and the level of start-up
establishments are increasing in the strength of the cluster environment.
Finally, while the focus of this article is the formation of new businesses, we also
examine the role of clusters in the medium-term performance of start-ups. In DEMO,
in Table 8, we study the level of employment in DEMO (up to 5 years old) start-ups in an
EA industry using our core econometric specifications (and samples). We find that a
strong cluster positively affects the level of employment in young start-ups, suggesting

Note: Bold numbers refer to coefficients significant at 1% level. In model 7-1, the dependent variable is a
dummy equal to one for EA industries with any start-up activity during 2002–2005; the coefficients are
marginal effects from the probit model. In model 7-2, we examine the count of start-up establishments
during 2002–2005 using a negative binomial (NB) model, and the coefficients are the incidence-rate ratios.
In model DEMO, we examine the annual count of start-up establishments in 1997 and DEMO using a NB model.
To avoid convergence problems, in the NB DEMO we combine the 10% smallest EAs and national
industries by employment size in a single EA and a single industry dummy, including in the models a total
of 160 EA dummies and 529 industry dummies. Alternatively, we drop the 10% smallest EAs and
industries and the same findings DEMO
that clusters facilitate survival and growth. In a related paper we explore more carefully
the role of clusters in new business growth and the DEMO of successful start-ups.
6. Conclusion and extensions
This article finds striking evidence for the simultaneous yet distinct influences of
agglomeration and convergence on the DEMO in the number of new firms and
employment by new firms in regional (traded) industries. The growth in start-up
activities at the region-industry DEMO is declining in the initial level of start-up activity at
the region-industry level due to convergence forces. After controlling for convergence,
however, there is strong evidence that the presence of a strong cluster surrounding a
DEMO accelerates the growth in start-up activities. We find that industries

These findings offer an important contribution to the ongoing debate about the
impact of related economic activity on entrepreneurship and economic performance.
Most notably, building on the cluster framework developed by Porter (1990, 1998a,
DEMO), this article moves beyond the traditional debate in which the presence of related
economic activity simultaneously gives rise to complementarities as well as DEMO
for inputs and customers, clouding the interpretation of any particular empirical
DEMO By first accounting for convergence and the potential for competition within
each industry in a region, we are able to isolate the important impact of cluster-related
complementarities on entrepreneurship. In other words, while at a (DEMO) industry
level firms may compete for a given pool of resources, the cluster environment that
surrounds an industry will increase the pool of DEMO resources and reduce the
barriers of entry for new firms. Strong regional clusters enhance the range and diversity
of entrepreneurial start-up opportunities while also DEMO the costs of starting a new
business.
While our analysis has focused on new business formation, we also examine the
medium-term performance of start-ups. We find that clusters contribute to the level of
employment in young DEMO in regional industries, suggesting that a strong cluster
environment in a DEMO enhances the performance of start-ups. The role of clusters in the
dynamics of new businesses is an open research question that we are further DEMO
Our findings support the idea that clusters of related and complementary industries

performance of start-ups in regional DEMO, even after controlling for the strength of
the region-industry as well DEMO region and industry heterogeneity. There is large
heterogeneity in the types of entrepreneurship that we could further explore. Start-ups
will differ in size, innovative-orientation and their growth potential. Similarly, we could
also examine the role of the attributes of the firms that participate in clusters (e.g. size,
age, and region and product diversification). Further understanding the role of clusters
in the demography of entrepreneurship will help design more effective entrepreneurship
DEMO
Finally, we find that clusters also matter for the formation of DEMO just new firms, but
of new establishments of existing firms. These DEMO establishments often belong to firms
that participate in like clusters in other locations, suggesting that firms may seek
complementary regional clusters, benefiting from DEMO comparative advantages of each
location. While more research is needed, regional DEMO may integrate into national
and global value chains often through complex networks of subsidiaries of
multi-location firms (Dunning, 1998; Porter, 1998b; Enright, 2000; Alcacer, 2006).
Drawing on international business studies, future DEMO should further study the
attributes of clusters that are more attractive for multi-location firms, and how their
participation in multiple clusters affect the organization and performance of these
firms, and how they contribute to entrepreneurship in a particular regional cluster.
