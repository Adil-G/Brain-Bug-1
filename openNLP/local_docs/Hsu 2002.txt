Abstract
This paper uses contingent claims analysis to investigate the staging decision of a venture
capitalist DEMO a principal agent framework Venture capital investment opportunities are modeled
as real options with multiple volatilities and the entrepreneurs incentive is assumed to maximize
DEMO probability of getting funded in the next nancing round The formulae of Black and Scholes
	
and Geske 
are generalized to evaluate these DEMO options We nd that staging
not only gives the venture capitalist a waiting option but also mitigates the agency problem of
the entrepreneur undertaking DEMO conservative activities Moreover we nd that the venture
capitalist tends to stage her investment when the expected growth rate of the ventures market
value DEMO lower when more capital is needed in future nancing rounds or when the venture is
younger However the risk free interest rate is not DEMO important factor in the staging decision
Our model also provides a good explanation for existing empirical evidence on the staging of
venture capital investment

Introduction
Since the US Department of Labors reinterpretation of pension investment rules DEMO   the venture
capital industry has undergone dramatic growth The fact DEMO many wellknown enterprises
including Compaq Microsoft Netscape Intel Genentech Starbucks and Federal Express received
venture capital nancing highlights the role of venture capital in DEMO fastgrowth companies It
is often claimed that these young rapidlygrowing companies generate a signicant proportion of
new jobs and economic growth
Despite the growing DEMO of the importance of venture capital in entrepreneurial activity
the academic literature on venture capital investments is scant An examination of two recent
reviews DEMO the literature on venture capital Mason and Harrison  	and Wright and Robbie
 
	 conrms the lack of rigorous analysis Gompers and DEMO  	have contributed to the
venture capital literature by examining empirically dierent aspects of the venture capital investment
cycle but more modeling work needs DEMO be done so that the behavior of venture capital investors
and investees can be better explained and predicted
Most of the existing venture capital DEMO uses either explicitly or implicitly the orthodox
Discounted Cash Flow DCF	approach to analyze venture capital investment decisions However
this approach is inadequate for decisions DEMO in the highly uncertain environment of the venture
capitalbacked rm since the DCF approach does not take into account theexibilitythat a rm
obtains by DEMO management Kester  
	illustrates the importance of exibilityby the fact that
about half of the market value of a fastgrowing rm can be DEMO to its growth options Dixit
and Pindyck  	elaborate on the real options approach as a remedy for the DCF approachand
emphasize that an DEMO which creates options should be given a higher value than the traditional
NPV approachwould suggest
Another feature of most venture capital literature is that DEMO analysis is widely used
to study the relationship between the venture capitalist VC	and the entrepreneur The principal
agent framework is well suited to venture DEMO investment because in a fastgrowing company
the entrepreneur usually has private information not known to the venture capitalist This feature
of asymmetric information in DEMO venture capital investorinvestee relationship can also be related
The British Venture Capital Association denes venture capital as follows venture capital refers to nancing the
DEMO development expansion or purchase of a rm in the act of which the venture capital investor acquires by
agreement a proportion of the share DEMO in the business in return for providing funding

denition reects the fact that contrary to popular perception venture capital plays DEMO a minor role in funding basic
innovation For example only  of venture capitalists investments went to startups in 

to moral hazard and adverse selection problems which have been a major DEMO in the theory of
principalagent analysis
Venture capital therefore represents a fertile area for developing real options theory in an asym
metric information setting DEMO fact recent advances have been made in real options theory by
investigating the eect of asymmetric information on both the exercise time and the DEMO of a real
option This is a natural direction because one of the major characteristics that distinguishes real
options from nancial options is the DEMO consideration of the option owner whose decision is
inuenced by the information she has
In this paper we use a principalagentframework to examine the DEMO decision concerning the
staging of the venture capital investment Although it has been recognized in the venture capital
literature that VCs keep the option DEMO to participate in later nancing rounds by staging their
investment no paper to the best of our knowledge has used the real options approachto DEMO
howtostage venture capital investment in an optimal way Since real options theory puts emphasis
on the contingent feature of an investors action it is DEMO suitable to analyze the eect of
the VCs discretion on the staging decision in the real options framework
To highlight the dierence made by DEMO we assume that a VC is considering two types
of investment  staged and lumpsum nancing In the staged nancing case the VC stages DEMO
investmentbydelaying the infusion of a certain amount of capital while in the lumpsum nancing
case this capital is committed immediately We then draw an DEMO between these nancing
opportunities and nancial options That is we see the staged and lumpsum nancing opportunities
as compound and simple options respectively After DEMO two generalized formulae of Blackand
Scholes  	and Geske  	in order to calculate the claim values of these options we use the
formulae DEMO analyze how the ventures riskiness is determined and how the VC chooses between
staged and lumpsum nancing
The model presented in this paper has DEMO features First we incorporate into our model the fact
that a ventures riskiness changes over time Since the formulae obtained in Black and Scholes DEMO 
and Geske  	are applicable only when the volatility of the state variable is constant throughout
the options life we derive generalized versions DEMO their formulae so that options with multiple
volatilities can be evaluated Second the entrepreneur is assumed to maximize the probability of
getting funded in DEMO next nancing round In other words we assume the entrepreneur is myopic in
the sense that he does not care about the probability of DEMO funded in nancing rounds later than

the next one Our assumption that the entrepreneur is a probabilitymaximizer instead DEMO a value
maximizer is in sharp contrast to the common assumption that the entrepreneur aims to maximize
the expected value of the venture
Our DEMO produces many ndings that illuminate and explain the VCs staging decision We
nd that staging serves at least two purposes Firstly staging can mitigate DEMO agency problem of the
entrepreneur undertaking less risky activities than the VC wishes This is because in our model the
entrepreneur chooses the riskiness DEMO the venture to maximize the probability of continuation in the
next nancing round while the VCs claim to the venture is more valuable if DEMO ventures riskiness
is higher Secondly by staging the VC can wait and see if the venture is worth more investment
thus avoiding committing too DEMO soon
Furthermore we nd that the VC tends to stage her investment when the growth rate of the
ventures market value is expected to DEMO lower when more capital is needed in future nancing
rounds or when the venture is younger We also nd that the amount of expected DEMO in the
uncertainty of the ventures market value and the level of the riskfree interest rate are not major
determinants of the staging decision DEMO on these ndings we are able to explain whythe amount
of the VCs capital infusion often increases with each nancing round as documented in DEMO empirical
studies of Sahlman  	and Gompers  	
The structure of this paper is as follows In Section  the opportunity to nance DEMO venture is
modeled as a contingent claim In Section  we rst present a generalization of Geskes  	and
Black and Scholes  	formulae DEMO then explain why the VC is assumed to be a valuemaximizer
but the entrepreneur is assumed to be a probabilitymaximizer Finally we show how DEMO calculate
the riskiness of the venture and the value of a nancing opportunity In Section we undertake
comparative statics analysis in order to nd DEMO the signicant determinants of the staging decision
We then explain the existing empirical evidence with our ndings Section  concludes

The Model
Consider DEMO new venture whose nancing decisions are completely determined by a leading venture
capitalist the principal	 Although in practice a venture is usually nanced by DEMO venture
capitalists there is some empirical evidence to suggest that the leading venture capitalists decision
about whether to continue nancing is important for other DEMO venture capitalists Failure
to obtain further nancing from the leading venture capitalist signals that the venture does not have
good prospects thus preventing others DEMO continuing to invest Therefore without much loss of

investment decisions if and only if he holds a xedfraction contract where he always receives a DEMO fraction of the

generalitywe can regard the whole syndicate of venture capitalists as a single DEMO
Assume that the new venture is managed byanentrepreneur the agent	Obviously the abilityof
the entrepreneur is an important factor in the success of the venture DEMO various other factors
including the market demand and the venture capitalists contribution also aect the value of the
venture
In order to take all DEMO factors into account we assume that between two consecutive
nancing rounds the market value of the venture
V  follows a geometric Brownian motion

constant
Consider three xed time points t T and T  DEMO  T T  Suppose that at t  T
the venture requires an investment of M to be made by the venture capitalists DEMO after which the
ventures assets become tangible enough for the leading venture capitalist to sell most of her shares 
In other words the DEMO venture capitalist must not sell too many shares and lose her leading
role before T Also assume that at t  the venture has DEMO out of working capital and so it must
seek nancing for its operation and RD activities during  t T Suppose that the ventures
DEMO can be nanced in two ways i	Staged nancing the venture capitalists can stage the
nancing by investing Is at t  and then possibly DEMO at t  T  or ii	Lumpsum nancing the
venture capitalists can make a lumpsum investment Il  Is  erT K at t DEMO   where r is the
riskfree interest rate  Because it is usually dicult for a new venture to obtain nancing from
the DEMO capital market venture capitalists may be the only nancing source for the investments
mentioned above Therefore we assume that the venture will become bankrupt DEMO the market
value of the venture will drop to  if the leading venture capitalist does not participate in any of the

 Section IIA for some common factors that aect the DEMO of a venture
We assume that either some shares of the venture are traded in the private capital market or there exists an asset
DEMO portfolio whose risk is perfectly correlated with the shares uncertainty In addition the market value of the venture
is the share price times the DEMO of total shares of the venture The assumption that some shares of the venture are
traded or there exists a spanning asset is crucial DEMO the standard argument of option pricing to be valid because the
price of a contingent claim is calculated as that of a replicating portfolio DEMO of the underlying asset and riskfree
bonds
 Throughout this paper the value of V at time t is denoted by Vt For example DEMO value of V at time T
is VT  
 Note that we suppose the market value of the venture at time

VT DEMO not be aected bythis investment
For example the investment M may enable the venture to go public The leading venture capitalist can then sell
DEMO shares in the public capital market
  In other words we DEMO that the lumpsum investment Il comprises two components
i the nancing Is which
is immediately under the control of the entrepreneur at t  DEMO and 
ii the investment erT K in a riskless bond whose
return DEMO t  T
K will be reinvested in the venture Therefore the basic dierence between staged and lumpsum
nancing is that in the former DEMO there exists the option of not making the investment K while in the latter this
investment is bound to be made

Analysis of the Staging Decision

The Valuation of Compound DEMO with Multiple Volatilities
From our model specication it is clear that if staged nancing is provided at time t   the
venture represents DEMO compound call option to the venture capitalist Geske  	derives a formula
for valuing compound options However in Geske  	the volatility of the DEMO variable is assumed
to be constant throughout the life of the compound option In contrast in our model we assume
that the underlying stochastic DEMO mayhave dierentvolatilities in the periods before and after
T   For future use wenow present a generalized version of Geskes theorem
 As DEMO will see the claim value of the VCs equity share in the venture is lower for a smaller   Therefore l also
depends DEMO the minimum riskiness required by the VC
  With the exception DEMO this feature we will follow the standard assumptions made in the option pricing theory

The Incentives of the VC and the Entrepreneur
Before analyzing the venture capitalists decision about DEMO or not to stage her investments we
need to make the following denition and assumption about the incentives of the principal and the
agent

The net value  NV  of an investment made at t DEMO to continue the ventures operation
is dened as follows NV


The venturecapitalist DEMO a valuemaximizer in the sense that she chooses the invest
ment whose NV is highest as long as this value is positive However the DEMO chooses 
maximize the probability that he gets funded in the next nancing round
to
	Note that K does not appear in equation 
 This is because we are considering lumpsum nancing where K has
been DEMO into the investmentcost Il
 Is erT K
 Note that in Assumption   is assumed to be linearly proportional to   Therefore DEMO the staged nancing
case the entrepreneur does not choose

to maximize the probability of getting funded at t  T once 
has DEMO

Our assumption that the venture capitalist is a valuemaximizer is motivated by DEMO fact that
usually a venture capital fund includes several portfolio companies Because the fund managers
performance is assessed on the basis of the monetary DEMO of the overall investments in the portfolio
companies the failure of a specic venture does not aect her career seriously nor does signicant
psychic DEMO arise from emotional commitment to the venture Therefore the venture capitalist
should be concerned mainly with the monetary value of her investmentin the venture DEMO is assumed
in standard nance theory
By contrast the entrepreneur will probably not see the venture as an ordinary investment The
usual assumption in DEMO venture capital literature that the entrepreneur maximizes the expected value
of his investment in the venture is inadequate for two reasons On the one DEMO if the venture
succeeds the entrepreneur may gain access to other investment opportunities that are available only
to proven entrepreneurs or wealthy investors The DEMO of these opportunities however is not
reected in the entrepreneurs claim to the venture
On the other hand although in the US VCs may DEMO more tolerant of or even in favor of an
entrepreneurs experience of failure in starting a business presumably an entrepreneur can aord
few failures DEMO his lifetime If the entrepreneur regards the venture as a onceinalifetime chance he
will usually dedicate a crucial part of his human capital to DEMO venture In Smith and Smith 
Chapter  	the opportunity cost of DEMO entrepreneurs human capital is calculated as the best wage
that could be gained from alternative employment This may not be correct Instead it should DEMO
calculated as the return that the entrepreneur could get from another venture that best suits his
human capital The calculation of such an unobservable DEMO is of course highly subjective
To summarize it is dicult for the entrepreneur to make objectivevaluations of both the return
and cost of his DEMO in the venture Since results of subjective valuations can easily vary
by a factor of ten or more a model based on maximizing the DEMO expected value is not
only unrealistic but also almost impossible to implementby practitioners Therefore we assume that
the entrepreneur is a probabilitymaximizer rather than DEMO valuemaximizer Although estimating
probability also involves subjective judgments the degree of variation in the results should be more
determined In other words it is DEMO that the entrepreneur is myopic in the sense that he is not concerned
about the probability of getting funded in the second next nancing DEMO Alternatively we could have assumed that
the entrepreneur maximized the joint probability of getting funded in two or more nancing rounds However such
an DEMO would make the model much more complicated Since as we will show our model has been able to
explain the existing empirical evidence and DEMO number of useful predictions we do not feel that more complicated
assumptions would be worthwhile Furthermore it is questionable that when faced with the DEMO of surviving
the next nancing round the entrepreneur would still take later nancing rounds into consideration
Our model also implies that the entrepreneur does DEMO aim to maximize the value of the shareholder
ie  the
venture DEMO Indeed if this were the case the entrepreneur would always choose a rstperiod riskiness of u
because the value of the real option C DEMO S increases with the volatilities 
and 
Furthermore it is well known that entrepreneurs tend to be optimistic about the prospect of the DEMO Because
the venture is still in its infancy a slightoverestimate of the growth rate will lead to a magnied error in the valuation
of DEMO venture in the case of success
acceptable Indeed since a realistic estimate of probability is often accurate only DEMO one decimal
place and is of course bounded between  and  DEMO one can expect that the results of any estimation
based on this will not vary by a factor as high as ten

An Analysis of the Eect DEMO Staging
For a given initial state V  Propositions  and  can be used to nd the ventures riskiness and

We will call the dierence between NVs and NVl the eect of staging In our analysis this is 

that in the former the VC delays until t  DEMO the decision about whether to make the investment
K Therefore the eect of staging must be caused by the existence of the additional nancing DEMO
at t  T 
The eect of staging can be decomposed into two parts  a compound eect and a riskiness eect
The DEMO eect is dened as the change in the net value of a nancing opportunity due to the
additional option of rejecting the investment K DEMO that the riskiness of the venture does
not change In other words if the rstperiod riskiness were independent of the type of nancing
then DEMO would purely change the VCs real option from a simple to a compound one and the
corresponding change in the net value of the DEMO investment at t   would be the compound
eect On the other hand the riskiness eect is dened as the change in the DEMO value of a nancing
opportunity due to dierent levels of riskiness assuming that the number of options of capital infusion
remains the same Therefore DEMO we consider the same type of nancing and compare the net values of
the VCs investmentat t   for dierentlevels of rstperiod riskiness DEMO the dierence obtained
is the riskiness eect

our model to a venture which is near going public we DEMO modify the assumption that the venture has no salvage
value when bankrupt

 l the eect of staging includes a riskiness eect
We use Figure  to illustrate DEMO decomposition In Figure  the curves NVl   

Consider again the case where V   Since the only dierence between the DEMO through
points P and P  is in the additional option to reject the investment K at t  T by denition the
distance DEMO P and P represents the compound eect Similarly the distance between P
and P illustrates the riskiness eect since these points represent the same DEMO of nancing but
havedierent rstperiod riskiness Therefore the distance between P and P  represents the eect
of staging This is equal to the DEMO between NVs and NVl in Figure  when V 
To recapitulate the eect of postponing the decision concerning the investment K until t DEMO T
is twofold If the rstperiod riskiness chosen by the entrepreneur were not dependent on that
postponement then the eect of staging would be DEMO due to the additional option to reject the
investment K In our model however the entrepreneur does respond to the delayed infusion of capital
DEMO and chooses a dierent rstperiod riskiness for dierent types of nancing Typically delaying
Figure  Decomposition of the eect of staging into compound and riskiness DEMO
The net values of the staged and lumpsum nancing opportunities are plotted against V using formulae

Since P and P DEMO dier only in the type of nancing they represent the distance between these points representthe
compound eect The distance between P and P  DEMO the riskiness eect Therefore the distance between P
and P  is the eect of staging for V 
the commitmentofcapital K induces the DEMO to choose a higher rstperiod riskiness so
the claim value of the VCs real option is further enhanced by the riskiness eect This suggests DEMO
staging can also mitigate the agency problem which occurs when the entrepreneur would otherwise
undertake less risky activities
One property of the compound eect DEMO noteworthy As can be observed from Figure  the
magnitude of the
rT
compound eect tends to e
K  Il
Is
as V DEMO to  but vanishes as V
goes to innity Indeed when V is close to  it is unlikely that the state variable would DEMO
large enough to justify the infusion of capital K at t  T  In other words the advantage of staged
nancing over lumpsum DEMO occurs bysaving the postponed capital whichwould probably be
wasted if committed too soon On the other hand when V is very large it is DEMO certain that the
investment K will be made at t  T  so the additional option due to staging has little value
Having DEMO the eect of staging we are now able to interpret Figure  in greater detail
 This can be illustrated by a simplied case DEMO the rstperiod riskiness can only be  or some positive constant
c In addition suppose V

M
but V e    DEMO where V is as dened in Theorem  Therefore if the VChas
chosen lumpsum nancing the entrepreneur will choose the lower riskiness  so DEMO the investment M will denitely
be made However if the VC has delayed the commitment of capital K then choosing zero riskiness means that DEMO
probabilityofthe investment K being made is zero Therefore the entrepreneur will choose the higher riskiness c

When V is smaller than Y	the entrepreneur will choose the riskiness u DEMO matter whether the
VCprovides staged or lumpsum nancing at t  Therefore the dierence between NVs and NVl
ie the eect of staging	consists entirely DEMO compound eect Similarly when V is greater than
E there is no riskiness eect When V lies between points Y and E the riskiness DEMO by the
entrepreneur depends on which type of nancing is provided at t   so both the riskiness eect
and the compound eect DEMO and comprise the eect of staging
Obviously it is the dierence between NVs and NVl that is relevant to VCs staging decision
Therefore for DEMO rest of this paper the eect of staging will be plotted as a function of V without
showing the original NVs and NVl curves DEMO the curve plotted consists of several sections
which can be traced back to the NVs and NVl curves For example in Figure  the DEMO curvehas
three sections When V is less than D or greater than E NVs is convex and increasing When V
lies between points D DEMO E however NVs can be concave and decreasing in V  because the eect
of a smaller 
s
on NVs may outweigh that DEMO a larger V  Similarlythe NVl curve comprises three
sections which are separated by points Y and Z Consequently the curve of NVs
NVl DEMO consist
of ve sections separated bythe points Y D Z and E

Comparative Statics Analysis
In this subsection we undertake comparative statics analysis DEMO nd out which of the parameters in
our model aect the VCs staging decision more signicantly As we will see typically the eect
of DEMO NVs
NVl is positive which means that the net value of staged nancing is higher
than that of lumpsum nancing This however does not DEMO that staged nancing is better than
lumpsum nancing in most cases because wehave not included any cost of staging in the denition
of NVs DEMO other words the VC should compare the eect of staging against the cost of staging when
deciding whichtype of nancing is better
Unfortunately it DEMO dicult to estimate the cost of staging Presumably this cost comprises
mainly the assessment cost of the continuation decision made in the additional nancing DEMO
This decision however is based on the VCs information gathered through her participation in the
venture so there is no clearcut distinction between the DEMO cost and other costs incurred
by the VC To get a rough idea of the magnitude of the cost of staging it may be DEMO to take
into account the following empirical data i	The average compensation of a managing partner

we will use the simpler expression in the remainder of this subsection

simple option If for example M is much larger than K l may be DEMO than s In this case NVs

As DEMO in the top panel the  

millions over a wider range of V DEMO This means that the eect of staging is more likely to outweigh the

the eect of staging remains higher than this cost over a wider range of V  This

lowest possible riskiness l no matter which type of nancing is provided DEMO the VC Therefore
staging can only cause a compound eect In contrast the lower panel shows that when
 
the rstperiod riskiness chosen DEMO entrepreneur does depend on the type of nancing In other
words staging causes not only a compound eect but also a riskiness eect Consequently DEMO eect
of staging for
 is higher than that for
 
Our result that a lower
induces more staging is intuitive If
is DEMO whichmay be due to
the entrepreneurs good ability or a booming economy the market value of the venture may growso
rapidly that VT far DEMO the investment threshold if anyat t  T  Under these circumstances
staging loses much of its value and the VC should be more DEMO to provide lumpsum nancing
On the other hand a low
means that prospects for the venture are poor so the VC may choose
to DEMO the wait and see option by staging her investment
The model parameter
should be interpreted carefully In our model the entrepreneur chooses
the rstperiod DEMO based on his expectation about the growth rate of the underlying process
This rstperiod riskiness then appears in the calculation of the eect of DEMO which in turn
aects VCs staging decision In other words to determine the type of nancing the VCmust make
a guess at the entrepreneurs DEMO about the growth rate This guess is likely to be correct
only when the VC and the entrepreneur share common knowledge concerning the prospects DEMO the
venture If the venture is still in its infancy information asymmetries are more likely to exist between
the entrepreneur and the VC and DEMO VCs guess tends to be lower than the actual expectation of
the entrepreneur about the growth rate
We attribute this biased guess to individuals DEMO project their own expectation onto
others In an unfamiliar environment one tends to subconsciously assume that other people see
things in the same way DEMO oneself Therefore when the VC joins a new venture her guess of the
entrepreneurs expectation will probably reect her own expectation However the VCs DEMO
at this time is based on more general information and her past investment experience which includes
cases of failure Consequently her guess will be DEMO when compared with the expectation of
the entrepreneur who is typically more optimistic Over time as the VCand theentrepreneur share
more information their expectations DEMO tend to converge and the VCs guess will become closer to
entrepreneurs true expectation
We now proceed to investigate how the other parameters aect DEMO staging decision Figure 
shows that the larger the followon investment K is compared with the immediate investment Is	
 Readers familiar with the DEMO mightmaintain that there exists some specic relationship between riskiness
and the growth rate Note however that existing asset pricing models are likelytobe valid when DEMO asset under
consideration is traded in an ecient market
Since the investor and the manager of a venture are in a special
committed relationship DEMO information concerning individual ventures is not fully disclosed and new ventures are not
in a stabilized state in this paper we do not assume DEMO there is a rigorous tradeo between riskiness and the growth
rate of a venture

Figure  The eect of staging is plotted against V for dierentvalues DEMO Is and K
A higher ratio of K to Is corresponds to a larger eect of staging This suggests that staging is favored when DEMO is
relatively large compared with Is
the more preferable staging is This is also intuitive When the investment K is large compared
with the DEMO Is the VC will be more concerned about the risk of wasting the capital K so
she will be inclined to wait for more DEMO before making the investment K Conversely when
the investment K is insignicant the consideration of the cost of staging may be more important
thus DEMO the VCtochoose lumpsum nancing
Figure  illustrates that the VC tends to favor staged nancing when M is larger By plotting
and comparing the DEMO like those in Figure 	 we can also show that given a specic
type of nancing a larger M induces the entrepreneur to choose DEMO higher riskiness For lumpsum
nancing this is intuitivewhen M is large it is more likely that the expected value of VT is smaller
than DEMO investment threshold M so the entrepreneur should undertake riskier activities to increase
the possibilityof a favorable sample path for which VT exceeds M For DEMO nancing however
the reason is more subtle Although in this case the entrepreneur maximizes the probability of
getting funded at t  T rather DEMO at t  T  a higher M still leads to higher rstperiod riskiness
because the investment threshold V tends to be higher as DEMO
Figure  shows the surprising nding that k is not an important determinant of the staging deci
sion This is illustrated by the fact DEMO even the k curve has a high degree of synchronization
 Therefore if 


but the burn rate in 
T T is much higher than that in 
T  then our model predicts
that the VC will tend to stage her investment
 Recall that as DEMO in Corollary   l increases with M when l  l u

Figure  The eect of staging is plotted against V for dierentvalues DEMO M
A larger M corresponds to the eect of staging staying at a high level over a wider range of V  Therefore the DEMO
tends to prefer staged investmentas M increases
with the k   curve in the sense that they both fall rapidly over a narrow DEMO which is
roughly bounded by V   and V   DEMO In fact this phenomenon of synchronization is even more
obvious if M becomes smaller Therefore for a typical cost of staging the VC tends DEMO choose the
same type of nancing regardless of the magnitude of k This is surprising because one might expect
that the VC is more DEMO to stage her investmentwhen k is smaller
There are two possible reasons why k has no signicant eect on the staging decision The rst
DEMO that staging gives the VC the chance to respond to unpredictable events whereas in our model
k is a constant whose value is assumed DEMO be known ex ante In other words the expected risk
reduction in the second period is not an unpredictable event The second reason is DEMO to our
assumption that the entrepreneur is myopic In the case of staged nancing the entrepreneur wants
to maximize the probability of getting funded DEMO t  T but does not care about the probability
at t  T Therefore k aects the choice of the rstperiod riskiness  DEMO only indirectly In the
case of lumpsum nancing  is as shown in Proposition  multiplied by k suggesting that the
second period is DEMO less important in the determination of  l Since the entrepreneur cares
	In our model k is designed to characterize the process of change DEMO the degree of uncertainty during the course of
the ventures life If an important discovery or innovation which will resolve a lot of uncertainty DEMO expected to happen
around t  T the riskiness in the second period would be much smaller than that in the rst period and DEMO k
should be closer to  Presumably such breakthroughs in RD occur more frequently in the intermediate stages of the
venture In early or DEMO stages it may be more dicult to make a major breakthrough so k is closer to 

Figure  The eect of staging is plotted against V for dierentvalues DEMO k
Although wehavechosen a wide range of k the curves plotted still have a high degree of synchronization In particular
they all fall rapidly DEMO a narrowinterval roughly bounded by V
important determinant of the VCs staging decision
  and V
 This suggests that k is not DEMO
less about the second period in both types of nancing the level of k should not gure signicantly
in his staging decision
Likewise Figure 
shows that the staging decision is relatively insensitive to the riskfree interest
DEMO r  since the curves correspond to a wide range of r but still have a high degree of synchroniza
tion This nding is DEMO keeping with a common result in the real options literature ie that the
investment decision is usually more sensitiveto volatility than it is to DEMO interest rate
Figure  illustrates that a VC may still choose to stage her investment even if she has a high
degree of control DEMO the ventures riskiness According to our model the claim value of the VCs
real option will be higher if the entrepreneur undertakes riskier activities DEMO due to the
agency problem the entrepreneur maychoose a lower riskiness in order to maximize the probability
of continuation in the next nancing round DEMO if the VC tackles this problem byhaving
closer oversight of the entrepreneurs decision the range in which the entrepreneur is allowed to
 Note DEMO according to the fth result of Corollary 
 l
is independentof r Therefore the dierence in the
curves in Figure must be due DEMO a dierent  s as r changes
For example this result also appears in the comparative statics analysis of Hsu 

For example as shown bythe V   curves in Figure  the entrepreneur will DEMO the lowest possible riskiness
when the state variable is expected to exceed the investment threshold in the next nancing round
 See Lerner 
 for a discussion on the oversightof a venture

Figure 
 The eect of staging is plotted against V for dierentvalues of r
The curves in this gure correspond to a wide range DEMO r but still have a high degree of synchronization This implies
that the staging decision is relatively insensitive to the riskfree interest rate
choose DEMO level of riskiness should become narrower but remain at a high level
The l   curve in Figure  represents a case of DEMO oversight Note that this curve is
still fairly high even when V is large This means that the eect of staging is likely to DEMO greater
than the cost of staging Therefore the VC may nd staging preferable even if the agency cost is
small Indeed if the ventures DEMO is restricted to a narrow and high level the agency problem
can be alleviated However the probabilitythat VT
or VT
exceeds V or M DEMO also be lower
see the V   curves in Figure  DEMO Therefore the VC should still stage her investment in order
to wait and see In short staging maybe
necessary even when the decision about DEMO ventures riskiness is made by the VC rather than
bythe entrepreneur
Finally Figure  illustrates that the VC tends to favor lumpsum nancing as DEMO venture
becomes more mature Intuitively most major uncertainties specic to the venture itself are resolved
in the early stages and therefore the riskiness of DEMO venture should be lower in later stages Moreover
the agency problem should be of less concern in a mature venture because the VCmayhave learned
DEMO to oversee the entrepreneur eectively Therefore the riskiness range l u should become
narrower We represent this intuition by the l    DEMO   curve in Figure  where the
If l   and u   the rstperiod riskiness can vary only within a DEMO range so the riskiness eect
should be small and the agency problem will be almost eliminated

Figure  The eect of staging is plotted against V for dierentvalues DEMO l
A higher l represents closer oversight of the venture since the ventures riskiness is limited to a higher level Note
that the l DEMO curve is still fairly high when V is large This suggests that the VCmay stage her investmenteven
if she has a high degree of DEMO over the venture
riskiness range is at a low level and narrow As can be seen the eect of staging is very small
when DEMO is large This together with the observation that the market value of a venture that has
successfully survived many nancing rounds should havegrown substantially DEMO that staging is
more dicult to justify as the venture gets closer to going public or to the liquidation stage

Empirical Evidence
Wenowshow DEMO our model can be used to explain the existing empirical evidence concerning the
staging of venture capital investments In their empirical studies Sahlman  DEMO Gompers
 	nd that the amount of the VCs investment often increases with each nancing round
In other words early stage ventures receive less DEMO in a nancing round This nding can be
explained with reference to three results of our comparative statics analysis
Firstly from Figures

low DEMO the fact that
 it is clear that the VC tends to choose staged nancing when V is
a young ventures market value has DEMO grown substantially implies
 Kaplan and Stromberg 
 also nd that DEMO VCs provide only a portion of the total funding commitment
 This was more common in early stage than in later stage nancings and DEMO common in rst VC rounds than in
subsequent rounds
 Indeed as pointed out in Section  a small V means that it is DEMO likely for the state variable to become large

Figure   The eect of staging is plotted against V for dierent ranges of riskiness
A more mature venture is represented bya lower and DEMO interval l u The l   u  curve shows
that DEMO eect of staging is very small when V is large Therefore the VC tends to choose lumpsum nancing as the
venture becomes more mature
DEMO staging should be more prevalent in the early stages which in turn implies that the amountof
investment tends to be smaller in earlier nancing DEMO
Secondly in Figure
we have shown that a higher
tends to make the VC favor lumpsum
nancing As we argued in the discussion about DEMO parameter  at an early stage the VCs guess
of the entrepreneurs expectation about the growth rate is more conservative partly because the VC
DEMO not sure whether the entrepreneur is of high or low ability After more nancing rounds both
the VC and the entrepreneur know better about DEMO real growth rate of the ventures market value
so entrepreneurs without good enough ability will be screened out during the renancing process
In other DEMO the VC will think that ventures which have reached later stages have a higher
than younger ventures Therefore late stage ventures tend to receive DEMO nancing which
corresponds to a larger amountof investment
Thirdly in Figure  DEMO we illustrated that lumpsum nancing becomes more preferable when the
venture is more mature Again this implies that late stage ventures receive more money DEMO nancing
round
In addition to being able to explain the existing empirical evidence our model also provides
various hypotheses that can be tested in DEMO studies For example our nding that K and M
enough to justify the investmentat t  T sothe venture capitalist will tend to stage DEMO investment

signicantly aect the staging decision while k and r do not has DEMO to be veried by empirical data
Moreover in the venture capital literature to date the staging decision has not been considered as
a function DEMO the ventures market value Our model explicitly features this relationship and thus
raises a new issue for further investigation Obviouslyby using or modifying the DEMO of this paper
more hypotheses can be derived and then tested

Conclusion
In this paper wehave developed a framework for analyzing the VCs DEMO decision More precisely
our framework incorporates real options and principalagent analyses As is well established the real
options approach deals with uncertainty in a DEMO satisfactory way Since the success of a venture
capital investment depends largely on the quality of the entrepreneurs human capital which by
its nature DEMO highly uncertain our framework can be used to investigate issues of venture capital
investment other than the staging decision
This paper has also demonstrated DEMO advances in real options theory and nancial	option
pricing theory are complementary although originally the former borrowed the idea from the latter
To see this DEMO that after modeling venture capital investment opportunities as real options we
derived two formulae to evaluate these options whose volatilities were not constantover time DEMO
formulae can also be used to price nancial options with multiple volatilities
There are several directions in which future research may build on the DEMO and ndings of
this paper First more empirical studies need to be done to verify our ndings Second our model
can be used to DEMO the moral hazard and adverse selection problems encountered when for
example designing the venture capital investment contract Third we observed that individuals
tended to DEMO their own expectations onto others This can be formalized and incorporated
into a theory of asymmetric information
 This is also investigated in Repullo DEMO Suarez 
 and Cornelli and Yosha 

Fried and Hisrich 
DEMO p also note that the perceptual emotional and cognitive processes which ultimately
lead to the choice of a decision alternativemust also be studied if DEMO to gain an adequate understanding of human
decision making
