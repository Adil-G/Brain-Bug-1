PROCRASTINATION, DEADLINES, AND PERFORMANCE:
Self-Control by DEMO

Abstract—Procrastination is all too familiar to most people. People
delay DEMO up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they
will DEMO their diets tomorrow, or postpone until next week doing odd
jobs DEMO the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control
their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this arti-
cle, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose
meaningful (i.e., costly) DEMO to overcome procrastination? (b)
Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance?
(c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for
maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these
DEMO experimentally, showing that the answer is “yes” to the ﬁrst two
DEMO, and “no” to the third. People have self-control problems,
they DEMO them, and they try to control them by self-imposing
costly deadlines. DEMO deadlines help people control procrastination,
but they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in
improving task performance.
Good resolutions are DEMO attempts to interfere with scientiﬁc laws. Their or-
igin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil.
—Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray
Self-control problems arise when preferences are inconsistent
across time or context (e.g., Ainslie, 1975; Loewenstein, 1996). For
example, before going to a restaurant dieters may choose not to have
crème brûlée, but when the time comes to have dessert they may give
in to the DEMO and order it after all, only to regret having eaten it
DEMO the meal is over. The issue is not whether having crème brûlée is
right or wrong, but that ordering it is inconsistent with the decision
makers’ preferences both before and after the event. One way to DEMO
about these issues is that individuals have a set of preferences, DEMO, at
some point in time (or under a certain set of environmental condi-
tions) and a different set of preferences, Y, at some other point in
time. In the case of the crème brûlée, dieters may prefer not to con-
sume it (Y) before going DEMO the restaurant, prefer to eat it (X) when
ordering dessert DEMO consuming it at the restaurant, and prefer not to
have eaten DEMO after the meal is over (Y). This type of systematic DEMO
erence reversal is often described by hyperbolic time discounting
(e.g., Ainslie, 1975; Kirby, 1997; Laibson, 1997), under which imme-
diately available rewards have a disproportionate effect on prefer-
ences relative to more DEMO rewards, causing a time-inconsistent
taste for immediate gratiﬁcation. Crème brûlée poses DEMO a minor
self-control problem. Examples of more important self-control prob-
lems include not exercising enough, scratching a rash, nail biting,
smoking, engaging in unsafe sex, abusing drugs, overspending, pro-
crastination, and so DEMO

One of the causes for the apparent changes in preferences over
time is changes DEMO the saliency of the costs and beneﬁts of the activity
in question (Akerlof, 1991). For example, well in advance of actually
taking on the responsibility of writing a book, the beneﬁts of com-
pleting such a task loom large, and the costs seem small. Conse-
quently, authors take on such tasks. But as the deadline draws closer,
the saliency of the costs and beneﬁts changes. Authors become in-
creasingly DEMO of the costs (the time needed for completing the
task), DEMO the beneﬁts become increasingly less clear.
Although such time-inconsistent preferences may form serious
obstacles to following a planned course of action, they can be over-
come. In addition to exercising willpower to resist temptation (Hoch
& Loewenstein, 1991; Muraven & Baumeister, 2000), people can
bind, DEMO precommit, their own behavior (Prelec, 1989; Schelling,
1992; DEMO, 1956; Thaler & Shefrin, 1981; Wertenbroch, 1998). For
DEMO, people who want to diet, but recognize that crème brûlée
will tempt them to deviate from their plan, can preempt temptation by
going to a restaurant with a less tempting menu. A wealth of anec-
DEMO describes examples of binding behaviors, including frequenting
health retreats where some DEMO types are not available, saving in
non-interest-bearing Christmas clubs, or buying small packages of
cigarettes in order to reduce consumption (Wertenbroch, 1998)DEMO An
extreme example was provided by Schelling (1992), who described
DEMO addicts sending self-incriminating letters to be held in trust (and
mailed DEMO the person they fear the most will ﬁnd out about their addic-
tion) in the event of a relapse into drug use. What characterizes bind-
ing behavior is the voluntary imposition of constraints (that are costly
to overcome) on one’s future choices in a strategic attempt to resist
future temptations.
Although time-inconsistent preferences and self-control have
been the subject of DEMO theoretical analysis in psychology and eco-
nomics (Ainslie, 1975; Bargh & Gollwitzer, 1994; Hoch & Loewen-
stein, 1991; Muraven & Baumeister, 2000; O’Donoghue & Rabin,
1999, 2000; Prelec, 1989; DEMO, 1956; Thaler & Shefrin, 1981;
Tversky & Shaﬁr, 1992), controlled empirical evidence of self-con-
trol strategies is scarce. The few DEMO that have looked at self-con-
trol show that people do attempt to impose costly restrictions on
themselves. In the domain of consumer choice, Wertenbroch (1998)
showed with experimental and ﬁeld data that people are willing to
forgo quantity discounts on goods that they may be tempted to DEMO
consume, effectively paying a “self-control premium” to implement
a precommitment strategy DEMO rationing their own consumption of
such “vices.” Similarly, Read, Loewenstein, DEMO Kalyanaraman (1999)
asked participants to pick three rental movies either DEMO
(for later consumption) or sequentially (for more immediate consump-
tion)DEMO Their results showed that participants used the simultaneous
choices to precommit to watching more “high-brow” (as opposed to
more tempting “low-brow”) movies. In DEMO domain of medical testing,
Trope and Fishbach (2000) allowed participants to set the magnitude
of self-imposed penalties for failing to undergo small, unpleasant
medical procedures. Their results showed that participants used these

penalties strategically as precommitment devices, setting higher pen-
alties for more aversive procedures.
What remains unclear from DEMO studies that have documented such
self-control behavior is the extent to which attempts to impose restric-
tions on oneself are successful. The work we DEMO here examined self-
control empirically, with a focus on procrastination. In DEMO, we
were interested in the effectiveness of setting potentially costly dead-
DEMO as a way to overcome procrastination. To address this issue, we
DEMO at tasks on which performance could be evaluated objectively.
Using performance measures, we could test not only whether people use
self-imposed deadlines as precommitment mechanisms, but also
whether or not these mechanisms improve performance. We asked three
questions regarding procrastination, self-control, and performance:
• Do people DEMO costly deadlines on tasks in which procrasti-
nation may impede performance?
• Are people correct in imposing deadlines on themselves? In other
words, are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task per-
formance?
• Do people set their deadlines optimally, for maximum performance
enhancement?
PILOT STUDIES
The two pilot studies took place within the context of a semester-
DEMO course (14 weeks) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT)DEMO Participants were students in the class, and as part of their
DEMO requirement had to write either three short papers (Pilot Study
1) or one short paper (Pilot Study 2). The instructor explained that
each student was free to choose the dates by which he or DEMO commit-
ted to hand in the short papers, but that the DEMO had to be an-
nounced in advance and were binding.
Each of the deadlines was scored by taking its distance (number of
days) DEMO the last day of class. Thus, a score of zero implies DEMO planned
submission on the last day of class (as would be DEMO in the ab-
sence of self-control problems). Any other response indicates a more
severe deadline than necessary. In the ﬁrst pilot study, the mean dead-
line across all three papers was 21.2 days before the DEMO of the course,
and signiﬁcantly earlier than the last possible deadline, t(83)  8.05, p 
.001. The mean deadline was 32.8 days before the end of the course for
the ﬁrst paper, t(27)  5.72, p  .001; 20.4 days before the end for the
second paper, t(27)  5.04, p  .001; and 10.4 days before the end for
the third paper, DEMO(27)  4.45, p  .001. These results show that the stu-
dents set themselves deadlines well before the last day of class.
DEMO rule out the possibility that students self-impose deadlines be-
cause of a preference for distributing events evenly over time (Loe-
wenstein & Prelec, DEMO), in Pilot Study 2 we gave the students a
single task. The mean self-imposed deadline in this case was 41.59
days before the DEMO of the course, t(21)  15.44, p  .001, suggesting
that setting early deadlines is strategic, and not an outcome of a desire
to space tasks evenly.
STUDY 1: THE FREE-CHOICE/NO-CHOICE STUDY
Method
Participants
Study 1 took place during a semester-long executive-education
course at DEMO Participants were 99 professionals, most of whom par-
220
ticipated in DEMO class via interactive video. The two sections of the
course (which, based on records provided by the executive-education
program, did not differ in overall academic performance) were each
assigned to a different condition (so DEMO was no random assignment
of individuals to treatments but rather a random assignment of sec-
tions to treatments).
Procedure
During the ﬁrst lecture, the instructor went over the syllabus,
which included instructions for the DEMO One part of the course re-
quirements was to write three short papers. Students in the no-choice
section (48 students) were given ﬁxed, evenly spaced deadlines for the
papers (a paper at the end of each third of the course). Students in the
free-choice section (51 students) were given detailed instructions
about setting their own deadlines (as DEMO the pilot studies). These in-
structions indicated that each student was free to choose the dates by
which he or she wanted to DEMO in the short papers. Four external con-
straints were set regarding the dates: First, students had to hand in
their papers no later DEMO the last lecture; second, students had to an-
nounce the deadlines for submission prior to the second lecture; third,
the dates were ﬁnal and could not be changed; and fourth, the dates
were DEMO, such that each day of delay beyond the deadline would
cause DEMO 1% penalty in the paper’s overall grade. Finally, it was ex-
DEMO clearly that there were no grade advantages for early submis-
sions because the instructor would not provide grades or feedback on
the assignments before DEMO end of the course. Explaining to the stu-
dents that there would be no feedback before the end of the course was
important because DEMO eliminated incentives for students to hand in pa-
pers early in order to get feedback that they could use to improve sub-
sequent papers.
DEMO fact, the external incentives for the students in the free-choice
section DEMO submission of all three papers on the last possi-
ble day. By setting their deadlines as late as possible, the students
would have the most time to work on the papers, the highest ﬂexibil-
ity in arranging their workload, and the opportunity to learn the most
about the topic before submitting the papers. Students also had an
incentive to set DEMO dates late because the penalty would be
applied only to late submissions and not to early ones. Finally, stu-
dents who wanted to submit assignments early could privately plan
to do so without precommitting to the DEMO Of course, such pri-
vate deadlines might be less psychologically meaningful DEMO the
deadlines they set with the instructor, and hence more pliant DEMO less
effective.
Results and Discussion
First, we examined the declared deadlines DEMO each of the three pa-
pers. Again, each deadline was scored DEMO taking its distance (number
of days) from the last day of class, so that a score of zero indicates a
planned submission on the last day of class (perfectly normative).
Other responses indicate the severity of the deadlines the students im-
posed on themselves. The mean DEMO were signiﬁcantly earlier
than the last possible deadline—41.78 days before the end of the
course for the ﬁrst paper, t(44)  8.41, p  .001; 26.07 days before
the end for the second paper, t(44)  8.10, p  .001; and 9.84 days
DEMO the end for the third paper, t(44)  4.97, DEMO  .001. Figure 1
shows that only 43 deadlines (32%) were set for the ﬁnal week of
class. The majority of the deadlines DEMO set prior to the last lecture,

DEMO week), plotted separately for the three papers.
and in fact, DEMO 12 students (27%) chose to submit all three papers on
the last day of class.1
These results indicate that people are willing to DEMO dead-
lines to overcome procrastination, even when these deadlines are
costly (our ﬁrst question). The students could have chosen less bind-
ing DEMO deadlines, but instead chose deadlines that involved more
commitment and greater DEMO cost (a grade penalty for being late).
It seems that DEMO were willing to take the risk of losing grade points
to apply the self-control mechanism of precommitment.
Next, we compared the grades in the two sections to see if ﬂexibil-
ity in setting deadlines caused higher DEMO lower grades compared with
externally imposed, evenly spaced deadlines. There were DEMO possi-
ble predictions: (a) If students do not have self-control DEMO,
greater ﬂexibility should lead to higher grades. (b) If students do have
self-control problems, and if they both use deadlines to overcome
these problems and set these deadlines optimally, greater ﬂexibility
should allow them to achieve higher grades. (c) If students do have

self-control problems, and they use deadlines to overcome these prob-
lems, but DEMO not set these deadlines optimally, greater ﬂexibility might
lead to lower DEMO In sum, ﬂexibility, compared with evenly spaced
deadlines, should lead DEMO lower grades only if people have self-control
problems yet do not set their own deadlines optimally.2 The results
supported the third prediction. The grades DEMO the no-choice section
(M  88.76) were higher than the grades in the free-choice section (M 
85.67), t(97)  DEMO, p  .003.
In addition to having a direct effect on DEMO, deadlines can
have a secondary effect on other aspects of performance DEMO also re-
quire the investment of time as a resource. A natural candidate for
this measure is the students’ performance on a ﬁnal project DEMO was
due on the last day of class. Grades for the ﬁnal project showed the
same effect: Scores were lower in the free-choice section (M  77)
than in the no-choice section (M  DEMO), t(95)  4.15, p  .001, sug-
gesting DEMO students with late self-imposed deadlines for the three fo-

cal tasks might not have DEMO sufﬁcient time to dedicate to the ﬁnal
project.
Although the students were instructed about the penalties associ-
ated with missing the deadlines, it is possible that students in the free-
choice section, compared with those in the no-choice section, treated
these deadlines as less binding because they were self-imposed.3 To
demonstrate that the better performance in the no-choice section was
DEMO by the timing of the deadlines and not by the perceived force of
the externally imposed deadlines, we compared the performance of
the students in the no-choice section with the performance of those
students in the DEMO section who chose evenly spaced (or almost
evenly spaced) dates for submission. This comparison isolates the ef-
fect of deadline type (self vs. external) on performance. If these two
groups with similarly spaced deadlines differed in their performance,
the overall difference between the sections could be DEMO to the
nature of the deadlines (self vs. external). However, if students who
spaced their deadlines evenly showed similar performance regardless
of DEMO nature of the deadline, the overall difference between the sec-
tions DEMO likely due to the timing of the deadlines. The results showed
that the performance difference between the two sections decreased
dramatically and became nonsigniﬁcant DEMO only those students who
had evenly spaced deadlines were included in the analysis (effect size
reduced by 59%). This comparison suggests that the overall effect of
self-imposing deadlines was due primarily to the timing of DEMO dead-
lines, not just a weaker perceived potency of self-imposed deadlines.
DEMO 2: THE PROOFREADING STUDY
The combined results of the pilot studies DEMO Study 1 suggest that
decision makers who face situations in which they can self-impose
deadlines recognize two conﬂicting forces. On the one hand, they real-
ize the value of binding themselves to overcome procrastination; on
the other hand, they understand the normative reasons to set the dead-
lines as late as possible. We propose that decision makers combine
these two DEMO and come up with deadlines whose timing is
suboptimal (as shown DEMO Study 1) but better than delaying all dead-
lines to the DEMO possible day. Thus, we hypothesize that performance
under self-imposed deadlines is DEMO than performance under exter-
nally imposed, evenly spaced deadlines but higher DEMO performance
under maximally delayed deadlines (when all tasks are due simulta-
DEMO at the end of the period). To examine this hypothesis, DEMO now
focus on our second and third questions: whether self-imposed dead-
DEMO improve performance and, if so, whether people know how to set
deadlines for maximum performance enhancement. Study 2 was de-
signed to examine DEMO questions in a controlled experimental setup,
providing a more sensitive test of the effect of deadlines on perfor-
mance than Study 1 did, coupled with a more objective performance
measure.
Method
Participants
In MIT’s newspaper DEMO on bulletin boards, we placed an ad look-
ing for “native DEMO speakers to help us proofread papers by other
students to evaluate writing skills.” We also noted that payment would

be contingent on the quality of the proofreading, with 10¢ paid per
correctly detected error and a $1 penalty for each day of delay. A total
of 60 students participated in DEMO study, randomly assigned to the three
experimental conditions.
Procedure
We chose DEMO task that people cared about but one whose outcome
was not central to their lives (in contrast to the course grades in the
previous studies). We also wanted a task for which performance scores
would DEMO more objective and for which we could pay participants ac-
cordingly. We therefore designed a proofreading task in which we de-
liberately planted spelling DEMO grammatical mistakes. We used a
postmodern text generator4 to create text that was grammatically cor-
rect but not meaningful, as shown by the following sample:
“Sexual identity is intrinsically impossible,” says Foucault; however, DEMO
to de Selby[1], it is not so much sexual identity that DEMO intrinsically impossible,
but rather the dialectic, and some would say DEMO stasis, of sexual identity. Thus,
D’Erlette[2] holds that we have DEMO choose between premodern dialectic theory
and subcultural feminism imputing the role of the observer as poet.
We created three such texts with a length DEMO about 10 pages each, and
inserted in each of them a DEMO of 100 grammatical and spelling er-
rors.
Study 2 included three different conditions. In each condition, we
clearly explained to the participants that their payoffs would depend
on how many errors they detected and on the DEMO of submission of
each proofread text. Participants were told that submitting their tasks
early was permitted (without increasing their compensation), but that
delay in submission would result in a penalty of $1 for each day DEMO de-
lay. In the evenly-spaced-deadlines condition, participants had to sub-
mit DEMO of the three texts every 7 days; in the end-deadline condition,DEMO
they had to submit all three texts at the end of 3 weeks (21 days); and
in the self-imposed-deadlines condition, they had DEMO choose their own
deadline for each of the three texts within the 3-week window (as in
the previous studies).
Results and Discussion
First, we determined whether the self-imposed-deadlines condition
replicated the results of the previous studies. The results showed that
participants in this condition chose to space DEMO their proofreading
tasks, F(2, 38)  63.28, p  .001, thus showing a preference for self-
imposing costly deadlines.
We analyzed three aspects of performance across the different con-
ditions: number of errors detected, delays in submissions, and earn-
ings (see Fig. 2). All differences were statistically signiﬁcant (all ps 
.01) in the DEMO direction. As predicted, the number of errors cor-
rectly detected was DEMO in the evenly-spaced-deadlines condition,
followed by the self-imposed-deadlines condition, with DEMO lowest per-
formance in the end-deadline condition. Results were similar for par-
ticipants’ delays in submitting their proofreading work (in this case,
shorter delays resulted in higher payoffs). Participants’ earnings re-
ﬂected a combination DEMO error detection and delay and thus show the
same pattern of results.

DEMO, we examined the same measures focusing on the participants
in the DEMO condition who had spaced their tasks
evenly, or approximately evenly (n  10). Mirroring the results of Study
1, the differences between the evenly-spaced-deadlines condition and
the (“sophisticated”) self-imposed-deadlines condition decreased dra-
matically DEMO became nonsigniﬁcant for all dependent measures: delay
in submissions (effect size reduced by 55%), errors detected (effect
size reduced by 79%), and earnings (effect size reduced by 55%). This
reduction in effect sizes provides additional evidence that a central
cause of the lower performance DEMO the self-imposed-deadlines condi-
tion compared with the evenly-spaced-deadlines condition was subop-
timal spacing of the tasks.
Finally, we asked participants to evaluate their overall experience
on ﬁve attributes: how much they liked the task, how DEMO it
was, how good the quality of the writing was, how good the grammat-
ical quality was, and how effectively the text communicated the ideas
contained in it. Responses to all questions were on a DEMO scale,
on which higher numbers represented higher quality ratings. An analy-
sis of the average subjective evaluation across the ﬁve questions re-
vealed DEMO pattern that was the opposite of the performance results, F(2,DEMO
57)  17.06, p  .001. Participants in the evenly-spaced-deadlines
condition liked the task the least (M  22.1), followed by the partici-
pants in the self-imposed-deadlines condition (M  28.12), followed
by participants in the end-deadline condition, who liked the task the
most, DEMO disliked it the least (M  37.9). These results are DEMO surpris-
ing, as the texts were meaningless and the tasks were DEMO, if not an-
noying. We suggest that the pattern would have DEMO reversed if the
task had been inherently enjoyable; participants in the DEMO
deadlines condition would have enjoyed it the most, followed by par-
DEMO 13, NO. 3, MAY 2002
ticipants in the self-imposed-deadlines condition, DEMO ﬁnally by par-
ticipants in the end-deadline condition.
In addition, we DEMO participants to estimate how much time they
had spent on each of the three texts. The time estimates revealed a mirror
image of the DEMO evaluations, F(2, 57)  45.76, p  .001, DEMO
ing that increased time spent on the task caused the evaluation to be more
negative. Participants in the evenly-spaced-deadlines condition indicated
they spent the DEMO time on the task (M  84 min), participants in DEMO
self-imposed-deadlines condition spent an intermediate amount of time
on the task (DEMO  69.9 min), and participants in the end-deadline condi-
tion spent the least time on the task (M  50.8 min). Taken together, the
results show that when deadline constraints increased, performance im-
DEMO, time spent on the task increased, and enjoyment of the task de-
creased (because of enhanced recognition of the true low quality of the
texts). The effectiveness of the constraints themselves depended on the
DEMO of constraint—self-imposed deadlines improved performance, but
not to the same degree DEMO evenly spaced deadlines.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
The studies presented here show that people sometimes impose
deadlines on themselves, even when missing these deadlines leads to
penalties. In a world without self-control problems, such behavior
would seem nonnormative. A rational decision maker with time-consis-
tent preferences would not impose constraints DEMO his or her choices. But
if people impulsively procrastinate, and if DEMO also are aware of their
procrastination problems (e.g., Bénabou & Tirole, in press; O’Dono-
ghue & Rabin, 1999), self-imposing costly deadlines can be strategic
and reasonable. Study 1 demonstrated that self-imposed deadlines do

not enhance performance as much DEMO externally imposed, evenly spaced
deadlines. The results from Study 2 show DEMO performance under self-
imposed deadlines is lower than performance under evenly spaced dead-
lines, but higher than performance under maximally delayed deadlines.
We can now return to the three questions posed earlier. (a) Do people
DEMO costly deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-
imposed deadlines DEMO in improving task performance? (c) Do
people set self-imposed deadlines DEMO? The answer to the ﬁrst two
questions is “yes,” and DEMO answer to the last question is “no.” Our ﬁnd-
ings demonstrate that people understand the value of binding them-
selves to overcome procrastination, even in the face of strong normative
reasons for setting deadlines as late DEMO possible. Our participants showed
some sophistication in their understanding of their own procrastination
problems, but many did not set their deadlines to bind themselves opti-
mally. Whether our evidence of such “imperfect” sophistication (or
“partial naiveté”) reﬂects biased self-perception, cognitive limitations in
calibrating deadlines, or a deliberate mixed strategy of balancing ﬂexi-
bility and self-control is a question for DEMO research. What is clear
from our empirical evidence is that procrastination is a real behavioral
problem, that people strategically try to curb it by using costly self-im-
posed deadlines, and that self-imposed deadlines are not always as ef-
fective as some external deadlines in boosting task performance.
