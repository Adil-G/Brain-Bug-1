If we try to use this fraim-ework
scribe how real human beings go about
making choices in a real world, we soon
recognize that we need to incorporate in
our description of the choice process DEMO
eral elements that are missing from the
economic model:
1. The alternatives are not usually
"given" but must be sought, and hence
it is necessary to include the search for
alternatives as an important DEMO of the
process.
2. The informnation as to what conse-
quences are attached to which alterna-
tives is seldom a "given," but, DEMO,
the search for consequences is another
important segment of the decision-mak-

3. The comparisons among alterna-
tives are not usually made DEMO terms of
simple, single criterion like profit. One
reason is that DEMO are often important
consequences that are so intangible as to
make an evaluation in terms of profit dif-
ficult or impossible. In place of DEMO
for the "best" alternative, the decision-
maker is usually concerned DEMO finding
a satisfactory alternative one that will
attain a specified goal and at the same
time satisfy a number of auxiliary con-
ditions.

lem itself is not a "given," but, instead,
searching for significant problems to

On July 22 Middleton submitted a
progress report to the controller, de-
scribing the data-gathering studies, esti-
mating completion dates, and summariz-
ing the program's objectives. On July 25
the consultants met with DEMO and
discussed a method of approach to the
design of the data-processing system.
The field trip took place early in August.
The consultants obtained DEMO field per-
sonnel information as to how accounting
tasks were actually handled and as to the
use actually made of information gener-
ated by DEMO existing system.
On August 8 Middleton submitted an-
other progress report, DEMO the status of
the data-gathering studies and recording
some ideas originating in the field trip for
possible changes in the existing informa-
tion-processing system. DEMO August 10 he
arranged with the assistant controller to
obtain clerical assistance on the data-
gathering studies, so that the consultants
would not be held up by lack of this in-
formation, and on August 17 this work
was completed.
On the following day the consultants
met with DEMO company committee to re-
view the results of the twenty-three
studies. They then listed the outputs,
files, and inputs required by any sales
accounting system the company might
adopt and drew a diagram showing the
DEMO of the accounting information. The
group also met with the assistant con-
troller and with the controller. The latter
took the opportunity to emphasize DEMO
basic decentralization philosophy.
Upon returning from his vacation early
in September, DEMO discussed the
flow diagram in greater detail with Able
and Baker, DEMO revisions were made on
the basis of information Middleton sup-
plied about the present accounting sys-
tem. Baker pointed out that all the alter-
DEMO systems available to the company
could be defined by the location of seven
principal functions and records. Further
analysis reduced this number to three:DEMO
stock records, pricing of orders, and ac-
counts receivable. The possible combina-
tions of locations of these gave eighteen
basic alternative systems, of which eight
that were obviously undesirable were
eliminated. Middleton was to make DEMO
cost analysis of the existing system and
the most decentralized of the proposed
systems, while the consultants were to
begin costing the most centralized sys-
tem.
Middleton reviewed these tentative
decisions with the other members of DEMO
company committee, and the group di-
vided up the work of DEMO Middleton
also reported to the controller on the con-
ference, and DEMO latter expressed his atti-
tudes about the location of the various
functions and the resulting implications
for the development of executive re-
sponsibility.
During DEMO next week, in addition to
working on his current assignments,
DEMO gave an equipment salesman
a preliminary overview of the probable
requirements of a new system. Next,
there was a two-day meeting of the DEMO
sultants and the company's committee
to discuss the form and implications of a
centralized electronic system. The con-
sultants presented a method of DEMO
ing the records for electronic processing
and together with the committee calcu-
lated the requirements which this organ-
ization and company's volume of DEMO
actions would impose on a computer. The
group then discussed several problems
raised by the system, including the audit-
ing problems, and then DEMO with the as-
sistant controller to review the areas they
had discussed.

DECISION
241
On the following day, Middleton sum-
marized progress to date for the control-
ler, emphasizing particularly the work
that had been done on the centralized
system. The controller expressed satis-
DEMO with several new procedures that
would be made possible by an electronic
computer. During the next several days
the committee members continued to
gather DEMO information necessary to de-
termine the cost of the present system.
Middleton also checked with the assist-
ant controller on the proposed solutions
for DEMO problems that the consultants
had indicated could not be handled readi-
ly by a computer and relayed his reac-
tions to the consultants.
A DEMO later the consultants returned
for another series of meetings. They dis-
cussed changes that might be necessary
in current practices to make centralized
electronic DEMO possible and the
way in which they would compare the
centralized and decentralized proposals.
The comparison presented some difficul-
ties, since the data provided by the two
systems would not be identical. A general
form for DEMO preliminary report was cleared
with the assistant controller, and a date
DEMO set for its submission. The process-
ing, outputs, and costs for the two alter-
natives would be described, so that addi-
tional information required for a final
report could be determined.
During the next week DEMO con-
tinued collecting cost data. He phoned to
the consultants to provide them with im-
portant new figures and to inform them
of the DEMO's favorable reaction to
certain proposed changes in the system
that had implications for the company's
policies.
On October 17 Baker met with DEMO
dleton to review the content of the ac-
counting reports that would be produced
by the centralized system, to discuss
plans for the preliminary report, and to
discuss the relative advantages and dis-
advantages of the centralized and decen-
tralized systems. On the next day, Mid-
dleton checked on their decisions relative
to the report with the controller and as-
DEMO controller and raised the possi-
bility of an outside expert being retained
by the company to review the final report
submitted by Beta. During DEMO last days
of this week, Middleton attended the
national meeting of DEMO management socie-
ty, where he obtained information about
the availability of DEMO and com-
puter personnel and the existence of
other installations comparable to that
contemplated for the company.
Work continued on the planning and
costing DEMO the two systems-Middleton
worked primarily on the decentralized
plan, and the DEMO on the central-
ized. On October 27 the two consultants
met with Middleton and they informed
each other of the status of their work.
DEMO discussed methods for evaluating
system reliability. Plans for the prelimi-
nary report were discussed with the com-
pany committee and the assistant con-
troller. DEMO the controller strongly
favored decentralization of authority,
the question was raised of the compati-
bility of this with electronic processing in
general and DEMO the centralized system
in particular. The groups concluded,
however, that DEMO of purely
clerical data-processing operations was
compatible with decentralization of re-
sponsibility and authority.
After several meetings between the
committee and the consultants to DEMO
out details, the preliminary report was
presented to the company committee,DEMO
the controller, and the assistant con-
troller on November 3. The DEMO was
devoted primarily to the centralized
system. The following points were made
242
THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
in the oral presentation: (1) that both
the centralized and decentralized pro-
posals would yield substantial and rough-
DEMO equivalent savings but that the cen-
tralized system would provide more and
better accounting data; (2) that the al-
ternatives had been costed conservative-
ly; (3) that the centralized system in-
volved centralization of paper work, not
of management; (4) that not all problems
DEMO by the centralized system had been
worked out in detail but that these did
not appear insurmountable; (5) that the
centralized system would facilitate im-
proved inventory control; and (6) that its
installation would require nine to twelve
months at a specified cost. At this meet-
DEMO the group decided that in the final
report only the two systems already con-
sidered would be costed, that the final
report would be submitted on December
1, and that investigation of other ac-
counting applications of the system
would be postponed.
In informal conversations after the
meeting DEMO controller told Middleton he
had the impression that the consultants
strongly favored the centralized system
and that he believed the cost considera-
tions were DEMO minor compared
with the impact the system would have
on executives' DEMO philosophies.
The assistant controller told Middleton
he thought the preliminary report did
not adequately support the conclusions.
The committee then reviewed with the
assistant DEMO the reasons for ana-
lyzing in detail only the two extreme
systems: the others either produced less
information or were more costly.
The next day the committee met with
the controller and assistant controller to
determine DEMO additional information
should be requested for the final report.
The controller outlined certain questions
of practicability that the final report
should answer and expressed DEMO view
that the report should contain a section
summarizing the specific changes that
the system would bring about at various
levels of the organization. DEMO thought the
comparison between systems in the pre-
liminary report had emphasized equiva-
lence of savings, without detailing other
less tangible benefits of the centralized
system.
Middleton reported these discussions
to the consultants and with them DEMO
oped flow charts and organization charts
for inclusion in the final report, settled on
some intermediate deadlines, and worked
up an outline of DEMO report. Within the
company he discussed with the controller
and assistant controller the personnel
and organizational requirements for in-
stallation of an electronic system DEMO for
operation after installation. Discussion
focused on the general character and or-
ganizational location of the eventual elec-
tronic-data-processing group, its relation
to the sales accounting division, and
long-term relations with manufacturing
accounting and with a possible opera-
tions research group.
On November 14 the controller, on
recommendation of Middleton, attended
a conference on automation for company
senior executives. There he expressed the
view that three to five years would be
required DEMO full installation of a central-
ized electronic system but that the fear
of obsolescence of equipment should not
deter the company in making the DEMO
ment. He also concluded that a computer
installation would not reverse his long-
range program for decentralizing infor-
mation and responsibility.
Middleton, his suggestion being ac-
cepted, made tentative arrangements
with an independent expert and with two
large computer companies for the review
of the consultants' report. Middleton
presented to the controller and assistant
controller a memorandum he had pre-

243
pared at the latter's request, establishing
a new comparison of the centralized and
a modified decentralized system. DEMO
modification made the two systems more
nearly comparable in data-processing
capacity, DEMO clarified the cost com-
parison, which was now in favor of DEMO
centralized system. Consideration of the
possibility of starting with a partially
electronic decentralized system as a step
toward a completely electronic system
led to DEMO decision that this procedure
had no special advantages. The control-
ler reported that conversations with the
sales manager and the president had
secured agreement DEMO the concept of
removal of stock record-keeping from
field locations-an aspect of the plan to
which it had been assumed there would
be sales DEMO opposition. The
group discussed several other specific
topics and reaffirmed that the final re-
port should discuss more fully the rela-
tive advantages and DEMO of
centralized and decentralized systems.
Toward the end of November there
was further consultation on the report,
and final arrangements for its review
DEMO made with the two equipment com-
panies and the independent expert. Each
equipment company was expected to de-
termine the method for setting up DEMO
proposed system on its computer and to
check the consultants' estimates DEMO com-
puter capacity. During this week the
controller informed the company's man-
agement committee that the report from
the consultants would be submitted
DEMO and would recommend a rather
radical change to electronic data-proc-
essing.
The final report, which recommended
installation of the centralized system,
was submitted on December 1. The re-
port consisted of a summary of recom-
DEMO, general description of the
centralized system, a discussion of the
installation program, and six appendixes:
(1) statistics on volume of transactions
(the twenty-three studies); (2) costs of
the present system; (3) the requirements
of a fully centralized system; (4) changes
DEMO allocation of functions required by the
system; (5) an outline DEMO the alternative
decentralized system; and (6) a descrip-
tion of DEMO existing system in verbal and
flow-chart form. When the report was
received and reviewed initially, the com-
pany's committee members and the con-
sultants made some further computa-
tions on installation costs.
At a meeting DEMO following Monday
the assistant controller proposed an ac-
tion program: send DEMO of the report
to equipment companies, send copies to
the sales DEMO, and await the re-
port of the independent expert. The con-
DEMO decided that the second and third
steps should be taken before giving the
report to the machine companies, and the
assistant controller indicated to Middle-
ton some points requiring further clari-
fication and elaboration.
By January DEMO Middleton had prepared
an outline for a presentation of the re-
port to the sales department. This was
revised on the basis of a DEMO with
the other interested accounting execu-
tives. A final outline was agreed upon
after two more revisions and three more
meetings. The report was DEMO on
January 28 to the president and to six of
the top executives of the sales depart-
ment. The presentation discussed large-
scale computers DEMO, described with
flow charts the proposed system, empha-
sized the completeness and accuracy of
the information produced, discussed
costs and savings, and DEMO the
current trend in other companies toward
electronic data-processing.
At Middleton's recommendation the
same presentation was made subsequent-
ly to top members of DEMO accounting de-

partment and still later to a group DEMO
the manufacturing department. At the
same time the preliminary report of the
independent expert was received, agree-
ing that the electronic installation
seemed justifiable and stating that there
might not be any cost savings but that
DEMO would make possible numerous other
profitable applications of the computer.
The consultants' report was then dis-
tributed to the computer companies, and
Middleton DEMO more detailed planning
of the installation.
Middleton, the assistant controller,
DEMO the controller now met with the in-
dependent expert, who reported DEMO con-
clusions: the feasibility study was excel-
lent, the estimates of processing time
were probably optimistic, the installation
program should provide for an early test
run, and the two principal available com-
puters were highly competitive. Inde-
pendent confirmation had been obtained
on the last two points DEMO another out-
side source. Middleton now proposed
that the company proceed with its plan-
ning while awaiting the final written re-
port from the DEMO expert and the
proposals of the equipment companies.
The assistant controller preferred to wait
until these reports were actually in hand.
During the next DEMO the equipment
companies proceeded with their analysis,
meeting several times with Middleton.
Baker sent a memorandum on his esti-
mates of processing time DEMO meet the
criticism of the independent expert.
Middleton prepared two charts, DEMO pro-
posing a schedule and the staffing re-
quirements for the installation phase, the
other proposing organizational arrange-
ments for the computer center. Middle-
ton and the assistant controller presented
these to the controller at the DEMO
of February, discussion centering re-
sponsibility for accuracy of input in-
DEMO
Middleton and the assistant controller
also had a meeting with sales executives
who reported that on the basis of their
own internal departmental discussions DEMO
the consultants' report they were in gen-
eral agreement with the DEMO Mid-
dleton and one of the other committee
members then spent two days inspecting
computer installations in two other
companies.
In the middle of DEMO the two
equipment companies presented their
reports, each bringing a team DEMO three or
four men to present their recommenda-
tions orally. The two recommendations
were substantially alike (except for the
brand of the machine recommended!),
but one report emphasized the availabili-
ty of its personnel to give help during the
installation planning stage.
Discussions were held in the DEMO
ing department and with consultant
Baker about these reports and the next
steps to be taken. The question was de-
bated whether a commitment DEMO be
made to one equipment company or
whether a small group should continue
planning the system in detail, postponing
the equipment decision until fall. Most
of the group preferred the former alter-
native.
On February 15 DEMO controller, in con-
ference with the assistant controller and
Middleton, dictated a letter to the com-
pany's president summarizing the con-
clusions DEMO recommendations of the
study and requesting that the accounting
department be authorized to proceed
with the electronics program.
On the following day the controller
DEMO the letter to the management com-
mittee. The letter reviewed briefly the
history of the project and summarized
the conclusions contained in the con-
DEMO' report: that there was ample
justification for an electronic-data-proc-
essing installation; that the installation

would warrant use of the largest com-
puters; and that it would produce sav-
ings, many intangible benefits, and
excess DEMO capacity for other appli-
cations. The letter quoted the consult-
ants' DEMO of the cost of the installa-
tion and their recommendation that the
company proceed at once to make such a
conversion and to acquire DEMO necessary
equipment. It then cited the various
cross-checks that had been made of the
consultants' report and concluded with
a repetition of the conclusions of the re-
port-but estimating more conserva-
tively the operating and installation

agement committee action. Supplemen-
tary information presented included a

tions in other companies. After a few
questions and brief discussion, the man-
agement committee voted favorably on
the recommendation, and the controller
informed Middleton of the decision when
the meeting ended.
THE ANATOMY OF THE DECISION
From this narrative, or more specifi-
cally from the actual data on which the
narrative is based, one can list chrono-
logically the various activities of which
the decision DEMO is composed. If we
wish to describe a program for making a
decision of this kind, each of these activi-
ties might be taken as one of the steps of
the program. If the rules that DEMO
mined when action would switch from
one program step to another were speci-
fied, and if the program steps were de-
scribed in enough detail, it would be pos-
sible to replicate the decision process.
The program steps taken together de-
fine in retrospect, then, a program DEMO an
originally unprogrammed decision. The
program would be an inefficient one be-

cause it would contain all the false
starts and DEMO alleys of the original
process, and some of these could pre-
DEMO be avoided if the process were
repeated. However, describing the proc-
DEMO that took place in terms of such a pro-
gram is a useful way of organizing the
data for purposes of analysis.
In order DEMO make very specific what is
meant here by a "program," DEMO I has
been prepared to show the broad outlines
of the actual program for the first stages
of the decision process (through the first
seven paragraphs of the narrative).

Subprograms.-The various program
steps of the decision process fall into DEMO
eral subprograms, some of which have
been indicated in Chart I. DEMO subpro-
grams are ways of organizing the activi-
ties postfactum, and DEMO Chart I the organ-

taken by the company to the total DEMO
lem. It remains a question as to whether
this organizing principle will be useful in
all cases. As in the present example, these
subprograms may sometimes be false
starts, but these must be regarded as
parts of the total program, for they may
contribute information for later use, and
their outcomes determine the switching
of activity to new subprograms.
In this particular case the reasons for
switching from one subprogram to an-
DEMO were either the proved inadequacy
of the first one or a redefinition of the
problem. Other reasons for switching can
be imagined, and a complete theory of
the decision process will have to specify
the conditions DEMO which the switch
from one line of attack to another will
occur.
Common processes.-In the whole deci-
sion-making program there are certain
steps or "routines" that recur within
several of the subprograms; they repre-
sent DEMO basic activities of which the
whole decision process is composed. For
purposes of discussion we have classified
these common processes in two cate-
gories: the first comprises processes re-
lating to the communication require-
ments of DEMO organization; the second
comprises processes relating directly to
the solution of DEMO decisional problem.
Communication processes.-Organiza-
tional decision-making requires a variety
of communication activities that are ab-
sent when a decision is made in a single
DEMO head. If we had written out the
program steps in greater detail, many
more instances of contacts among differ-
ent members of the organization would
be recorded than are now explicit in the
narrative. The contacts DEMO be oral or
written. Oral contacts are used for such
purposes as giving orders, transmitting
information, obtaining approval or criti-
cism of proposed DEMO; written commu-
nications generally take the form of
memorandums having the DEMO of
transmitting information or proposing
action.
The information-transmitting func-
tion is crucial to organizational decision-
making, for it almost always involves
acts of selection or "filtering" by the in-
formation source. In the present instance,DEMO
which is rather typical in this respect, the
consultants and subordinate DEMO
are principal information sources; and
the controller and other top executives
DEMO depend upon them for most of their
technical information. Hence, the DEMO
ordinate acts as an information filter and
in this way secures a large influence over
the decisions the superior can and does
reach.
The DEMO of the information
source over communications is partly
controlled by checking processes-for ex-
ample, retaining an independent expert
to check consultants-which give the
recipient an independent information
source. This reduces, but by no means
eliminates, DEMO The great differ-
ences in the amounts and kinds of infor-
mation available to the various partici-
pants in the decision process described
here DEMO the significance of filter-
ing. It will be important to determine
the relationship of the characteristics of
the information to the resultant infoima-
tion DEMO and to explore the effects of
personal relations between people on the
filtering process and hence upon the
transmission of information.
Problem-solving processes.-Alongside
the DEMO communication proc-
esses, we find in the narrative a number
of DEMO processes directed toward
the decision problem itself. One of the
most prominent of these is the search for
alternative courses of action. The first

activities recounted in the narrative-
writing DEMO, reading journals, and so
on-were attempts to discover possible
action alternatives. At subsequent points
in the process searches were conducted to
obtain lists DEMO qualified consultants and
experts. In addition to these, there were
numerous DEMO of them only
implicit in the condensed narrative-to
find action alternatives that would over-
come specific difficulties that emerged as
detail was added to DEMO broader alter-
natives.
The data support strongly the asser-
tion made in the introduction that
searches for alternative courses of action
constitute a significant DEMO of non-pro-
grammed decision-making-a part that
is neglected by the classical theory of
rational choice. In the present case the
only alternatives that became DEMO
to the company without the expenditure
of time and effort were the systems pro-
posals made early in the process by repre-
sentatives of DEMO equipment companies,
and these were both rejected. An impor-
tant reason for the prominent role of
search in the decision process is that DEMO
"problem" to be solved was in fact a
whole series of "nested" problems, each
alternative solution to a problem at one
level leading to a new set of problems at
the next level. In DEMO, the process of
solving the substantive problems created
many procedural problems DEMO the organ-
ization: allocating time and work, plan-
ning agendas and report presentations,
and so on.
Examination of the narrative shows
that DEMO is a rich variety of search
processes. Many questions remain to be
answered as to what determines the par-
ticular character of the search DEMO a par-
ticular stage in the decision process: the
possible differences DEMO searches for
procedural alternatives, on the one hand,
and for DEMO alternatives, on the
other; the factors that determine how
many alternatives will be sought before
a choice is made; the conditions under
which an alternative that has tentatively
been chosen will be subjected to further
DEMO; the general types of search
strategies.
The neglect of the search DEMO alterna-
tives in the classical theory of decision
would be inconsequential if the search
were so extensive that most of the alter-
natives available "in principle" were
generally discovered and considered. In
that case the search process would have
no influence upon the alternative finally
selected for action. DEMO narrative sug-
gests that this is very far from the truth
-that, in fact, the search for alternatives
terminates when a satisfactory solution
DEMO been discovered even though the
field of possibilities has not been exhaust-
ed. Hence, we have reason to suppose
that changes in the search process or its
outcome will actually have major effects
on the final DEMO
A second class of common processes
encompasses information-gathering and
similar activity aimed at determining the
consequences of each of several alterna-
tives. In many DEMO, certainly in the
one we observed, these activities account
for the largest share of man-hours, and
it is through them that subproblems are
discovered. The narrative suggests that
there is an inverse relation between the
DEMO or diff-culty of this investigational
task and the number of alternative
courses of action that are examined care-
fully. Further work will be needed DEMO de-
termine if this relation holds up in a
broader range of situations. The record
also raises numerous questions about the
kinds of consequences DEMO are examined
most closely or at all and about the condi-
tions under which selection of criteria
for choice is prior to, or subsequent to,
the examination of consequences.

THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
Another set of common processes are
those DEMO with the choices among
alternatives. Such processes appear at
many points in the narrative: the selec-
tion of a particular consulting firm from
a list, the choice between centralized and
decentralized electronic-data-processing
systems, as well DEMO numerous more de-
tailed choices. These are the processes
most closely allied to the classical theorv
of choice, but even here it is notable that
traditional kinds of "maximizing" proce-
dures appear only rarely.
In DEMO situations the choice is be-
tween competing alternatives, but in
many DEMO it is one of acceptance or
rejection of a single course of action-
really a choice between doing something
at this time and doing DEMO The first
such occasion was the decision by the
controller to assign Middleton to the task
of watching developments in electronics,
a decision DEMO initiated the whole se-
quence of later choices. In decisions of
this type the consequences of the single
alternative are judged against some kind
DEMO explicit or implicit "level of aspira-
tion"-perhaps expressed in terms DEMO an
amount of improvement over the existing
situation-while in the multiple-alterna-
tive situations, the consequences of the
several alternatives are compared with
each other. This observation raises a host
of new questions relating to the circum-
DEMO under which the decision will be
formulated in terms of the one or the
other of these frameworks and the per-
sonal and organizational DEMO that de-
termine the aspiration levels that will be
applied in the one-alternative case.
Another observation derivable from
our data-though it is not obvious DEMO
the condensed narrative given here-is
that comparability and non-comparabili-
ty of the criteria of choice affects the de-
cision processes in significant ways. For
DEMO thing, the criteria are not the same
from one choice to DEMO: one choice
may be made on the basis of relative
costs DEMO savings, while the next may be
based entirely on non-monetary criteria.
DEMO, few, if any, of the choices were
based on a DEMO criterion. Middleton
and the others recognized and struggled
with this problem of comparing conse-
quences that were sometimes measured
in different, and incomparable, DEMO, and
even more often involved completely in-
tangible considerations. The narrative
DEMO, but does not answer, the question
of how choices are made in the face of
these incommensurabilities and the de-
gree to which DEMO considerations are
overemphasized or underemphasized as
compared with intangibles as a result.
CONCLUSION
We do not wish to try to transform one
swallow into DEMO summer by generalizing
too far from a single example of a deci-
sion process. We have tried to illustrate,
however, using a large relatively non-
programmed decision in a business firm,
some of the DEMO that are involved
in business decision-making and to indi-
cate the sort of theory of the choice
mechanism that is needed to accommo-
date DEMO processes. Our illustration sug-
gests that search processes and informa-
tion-gathering processes constitute sig-
nificant parts of decision-making and
must be incorporated in a DEMO of de-
cision if it is to be adequate. While the
framework employed here-and particu-
larly the analysis of a decision in terms
of DEMO hierarchical structure of programs-
is far from a complete or finished theory,
it appears to provide a useful technique
of analysis for researchers DEMO in
the theory of decision as well as for busi-
ness executives who may wish to review
the decision-making procedures of their
own companies.{1g42fwefx}
