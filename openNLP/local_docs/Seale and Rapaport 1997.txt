The “secretary problem” DEMO a class of optimal
stopping decision tasks in which the binary decision
to either stop or continue the search only depends on
relative ranks. DEMO present this problem in a computer -
controlled experiment designed to investigate sequen-
tial observation and selection behavior in the context
of employer hiring DEMO Our principal objectives
are to test the descriptive power of the optimal decision
policy; characterize and competitively test simple deci-
sion rules, or DEMO, that individuals might use
in optimal stopping decision tasks; and examine the
sensitivity of the various decision rules by computer
simulation. Our simulation DEMO show that the opti-
mal policy is insensitive to moderate deviations from
the optimal cutoff value, and that a simple, non-optimal
decision rule DEMO counts the number of successive non-
candidates performs remarkably well. Model compari-
sons show that simple cutoff decision rules account
for the decisions of DEMO majority of the subjects. The
observed tendency to stop the search too early is ac-
counted for by postulating an endogenous cost of time
DEMO in the search. q 1997 Academic Press
Our objective in this paper is to characterize and
study several simple decision rules, or heuristics, DEMO
individuals may use to maximize the probability of se-
lecting the best alternative from a finite set of alterna-
tives that are inspected sequentially. DEMO each new
inspection, the decision maker (DM) must either choose
DEMO of the available alternatives or exercise an option
to inspect another alternative; there is no recall of previ-
ous alternatives.

To illustrate this class of optimal stopping decision
problems and motivate our study, consider two exam-
ples from entirely different domains. The first example
(Stewart, 1981) concerns a prospecting company, DEMO
resources to develop a single mine, which commences
exploration in a DEMO region. Mineral deposits are scat-
tered throughout the region and are assumed to be
discovered in a random order. When a deposit is discov-
DEMO, a claim option can be taken out. As is often the
DEMO, the decision as to whether to work the claim has
to DEMO made within some prescribed amount of time. If
this time is relatively short in comparison with the time
between discoveries, then effectively a decision on one
option has to be made before the next discovery is DEMO
On the other hand, if the option is allowed to lapse
DEMO is a high probability that some other company
will take up the option.
The second example—the one actually investigated
in the present study—concerns the DEMO of the best
secretary from a fixed pool of potential employees
applying for a job vacancy (e.g., Ferguson, 1989). The
employer is assumed to interview the applicants se-
quentially; following each interview, she DEMO decide
whether to select the current applicant, thereby termi-
nating the DEMO process, or reject the current appli-
cant and interview another applicant. DEMO assume that
rejected applicants cannot be recalled (this assumption
can and DEMO been relaxed). This assumption applies in
situations in which interviews are spaced far apart and
there is strong competition for secretaries, so that the
probability that a rejected applicant is still available is
practically zero.
DEMO and related sequential decision problems have
been modeled by the so-called “secretary problem” in
probability theory. Although there is some obscurity as
to the DEMO of this problem, it is generally agreed

maximize the probability that the item selected is, in
fact, the best of all the n items available (or, equiva-
lently, assuming a 0-1 payoff function, maximize the
expected gain DEMO search).
The standard SP can be formulated in terms of six as-
sumptions:
1. There is only one position available.
2. The DEMO of applicants, n, is finite and known
by the DM.
3. The n applicants are interviewed sequentially, one
at a time, in DEMO random order; consequently, each of the
n! orders is equally likely.
4. The DM can rank all the n applicants from best
to DEMO without ties. The decision to either accept or
reject an applicant in a given period is based only on
the relative ranks of those DEMO interviewed so far.
5. Once rejected, an applicant cannot later be DEMO
called.
6. The DM is satisfied with nothing but the best.
(DEMO payoff is 1, if he chooses the best of the n DEMO,
and 0 otherwise.)
It has been recognized that these features place more
severe constraints on the problem than would usually
apply in DEMO This may be one of the main reasons
why the standard SP has not attracted attention in the
that the first statement of the DEMO appeared in experimental investigation of individual choice behav-
print in the February 1960 column of Martin Gardner
in Scientific American. Lindley (1961) seems DEMO be the
first to solve the problem in a scientific journal (DEMO
guson, 1989). An important problem left open in Lin-
dley’s DEMO was subsequently solved by Chow, Mori-
guti, Robbins, and Samuels (1964). A more basic paper
by Gilbert and Mosteller (1966) DEMO the basic
secretary problem in several important directions. This
paper, more DEMO the others, is responsible for the explo-
sion of ideas, generalizations, and effort that have im-
pacted this area since 1972 and that continues strongly
today (for a partial review of the theoretical develop-
ments until 1983 see Freeman, 1983).
In the standard version of the secretary problem (SP),
a fixed and known number, n, DEMO items (alternatives)
are presented to the DM, one at a time, in a random
order. Time is discrete. At any period, DEMO DM is able
to rank order all the items that have been observed
in terms of their desirability or quality. As each item
(alternative) is inspected (interviewed), the DM must
either accept it, in which case the observation process
is terminated, or reject it, in DEMO case the next item
in the (random) order is presented and the DM faces
the same problem as before. The DM’s objective is DEMO
bility distribution of the item’s quality is known in ad-
vance, DEMO that it can be learned during the interview
process (e.g., Sakaguchi, 1961, 1978; Gilbert & Mos-
teller, 1966; DeGroot, 1970; Stewart, 1981; Petrucelli,
1982). Possibly the most restrictive of DEMO six assump-
tions is Assumption 5 that has been generalized in sev-
eral different ways. One generalization introduces the
possibility that an applicant, if selected, has some prob-
ability of not being available (Smith, 1975). Another
generalization allows the DM to recall one of the last
DEMO rejected applicants (m , n); if available, the applicant
can be selected, otherwise, the DM continues the inter-
view process (Corbin, 1980; Yang, 1974). Finally, both
of these generalizations can DEMO combined (Petrucelli,
1981). The sixth and final assumption can DEMO be gener-
alized in several ways. The special utility function im-
plied by the formulation of the standard SP that takes
on the value DEMO, if the best applicant is selected, and 0,
otherwise, DEMO been generalized by assuming that the
DM receives utility ui if the applicant selected is the
ith best. Special cases of this generalization have DEMO
examined by Lindley (1961), Chow et al. (1964), Gilbert
and Mosteller (1966), and Mucci (1973).
Experimental investigations of DEMO variants of the
standard SP, which relax Assumption 1 by allowing DEMO
rather than one position and Assumption 2 by pres-
enting the subject information about the probability
distribution of n, rather than the exact value of n, have
ior or in the vast literature on human resource manage-
ment. However, although the formulation of the stan-
dard SP is rather simple in nature, its assumptions and
non-trivial solution provide some insight into the type
of decision which can provide an appropriate response
to DEMO dilemma faced by the DM between committing
resources to an attractive proposition or deferring the
decision in the hope of obtaining a better opportunity
DEMO (Stewart, 1981).
More importantly, each of the six assumptions DEMO
can be relaxed offering more realistic formulations of
the standard SP. Rather than assuming a single posi-
tion (Assumption 1), one may consider SPs in which
several positions are available (Gilbert & Mosteller,
1966; Sakaguchi, 1978). Rather than assuming that the
number of applicants DEMO known with precision (Assump-
tion 2), it may be assumed DEMO the DM only knows the
distribution of the value of n (DEMO, Gianini-Pettit, 1979;
Pressman & Sonin, 1972; Rasmusen & Robbins, 1975).
The assumption of random arrival of applicants (As-
sumption DEMO) can be replaced by other assumptions that
are better suited to DEMO specifics of the problem (e.g.,
that applicants are interviewed at DEMO points of a Pois-
son process as in Cowan & Zabezyk, DEMO). Assumption
4 can be replaced by other assumptions that the proba-

The asymptotic results, though perhaps not the form

date.
We justify the term “heuristics” in this context by
noting that all three decision DEMO, or behavioral mod-
els, make minimal requirements on the DM’s cognitive
system. Each requires the DM to merely count the num-
ber of DEMO “events” and compare this number to
some fixed parameter value. Under the cutoff rule, the
DM has only to count the number of applicants and
then stop on the first candidate once this number ex-
ceeds DEMO constant r 2 1. Under the candidate count
rule, he has DEMO to count the number of candidates
before deciding to stop, once DEMO number is equal to or
larger than some constant j. And under the successive
non-candidate rule, after observing a candidate the DM
has only to count the number of successive non-candi-
dates and stop on the DEMO candidate, once this number
is equal to or larger than some DEMO k. The relative
effectiveness of these rules with respect to the optimal
policy will be studied by simulation below. Because each

SIMULATION RESULTS
A series DEMO computer simulations were conducted to
assess the sensitivity of the optimal policy, and the
effectiveness of the three decision rules. Each of the
three decision rules, cutoff, candidate count, and succes-
sive non-candidates, was DEMO for the standard SP
with either n 5 40 or n 5 80 applicants. Each possible
variant or form of the three decision rules DEMO repli-
cated (simulated) 10,000 times. All the replications fol-
lowed a similar pattern. First, a set of n applicants was
assembled using a random number generator, where
the relative ability or rank of the applicants could be
determined with certainly. Next, the applicants were
presented to the decision rule one at a time in a random
order. If DEMO applicant was a candidate and met the

The results of the simulations are summarized in six

of the three decision rules and two experimental condi-
tions (n 5 40 and n 5 80). Table 1 provides a summary
and comparison of these results. Several statistics are
DEMO for each of the three decision rules. The opti-

count, and number of successive non-candidates po-
lices, respectively, indicates which parameter value DEMO
the rule produces the highest probability of success.
The probability of candidate selection, given the optimal
threshold value, indicates the likelihood that the DEMO
sion rule will generate a selection decision. The proba-
bility of correct selection, given the optimal threshold
value, indicates the likelihood that the DEMO rule will
select the best candidate from the pool of n applicants.

nally, effectiveness captures how well the decision rule
performs in DEMO to the optimal policy. Since the
cutoff rule with r* is optimal, and by definition 100%
effective, this statistic is not reported for DEMO rule. The
results are organized below by type of decision rule.
Cutoff rule. For the standard secretary problem
with n 5 40 applicants, the optimal policy is to reject
the first 15 applicants, then select the first candidate.
Using this policy, the probability of a correct selection
is 0.378 (Gilbert & Mosteller, 1966). The simulation
results for the DEMO secretary problem with n 5 40
candidates (Fig. 1) are in close agreement with these
predictions. The distribution reaches its peak of 3776
DEMO selections (probability 5 0.378) when the policy
of rejecting the first 14 applicants is adopted.1
The simulation results show that the function dis-
DEMO in Fig. 1 is relatively flat at the top, rendering
the DEMO policy rather insensitive to small variations
in r. For example, any DEMO in the interval (9, 23) achieves
at least 90% effectiveness DEMO the optimal solution. And
any r in the interval (6, 26) achieves at least 80% effec-
tiveness. Note the declining linear trend in the number
of times a selection occurs as the number of applicants
DEMO increases. While this result is somewhat intu-
itive, it provides an DEMO point of comparison for
the other two decision rules.
For the standard SP with n 5 80 applicants, the
optimal policy is to reject the first 29 applicants, then
select the next candidate. Using this policy, the proba-
bility of a correct selection is 0.372 (Gilbert & DEMO,
1 The theoretical prediction and simulation results for r* differed
by 1. As a binomial test revealed no significant difference between
these results, we conclude that the difference was due to the random
nature of DEMO simulation.

1966). Again, the simulation results (Fig. DEMO) are in line
with these predictions. The distribution reaches its
peak DEMO 3748 correct selections (probability 5 0.375)
when the policy of DEMO the first 28 applicants is
adopted. The shape of this distribution is almost identi-
cal to the n 5 40 case, again suggesting that the optimal
policy is rather insensitive to small variations in r. For
DEMO n 5 80 case, any r in the interval (18, DEMO) achieves
at least 90% effectiveness of the optimal solution, and
any r in the interval (13, 51) achieves at least 80% effec-
tiveness.
Candidate count rule. To implement this rule, we
first establish a threshold value, j, then observe each
applicant and note whether it DEMO a candidate. When the
count of candidates equals j,(0 , DEMO , n), the candidate
is selected; otherwise, interviews continue. With n 5
40 applicants (see Fig. 3), selecting the fourth candidate
( j 5 4) yields the highest probability of correct selection
(DEMO 5 0.244). This result is approximately 65%
of what one would expect using the optimal policy. The
narrow shape of the distribution shows DEMO small devi-
ations in j have a serious effect on the probability of
correct selection; setting j 5 3 lowers the probability of
correct selection to 0.204, while setting j 5 5 lowers it
to 0.214.
Finally, notice the steep decline in the number of
times a selection occurred. For j 5 4, the decision rule
finds a candidate 67% of the time. If the threshold value
is increased to j 5 DEMO, j 5 6, or j 5 7, the decision rule
DEMO a candidate 42, 22, and 10% of the time, respec-
DEMO Small increases in j greatly lower the DM’s proba-
bility of finding a candidate.
For the case n 5 80, shown in Fig. 4, j 5 4 still yields
the highest probability of correct selection (DEMO), al-
though this is only 58% of what one would expect using
the optimal policy. The second best threshold value,
j 5 DEMO, closely approximates these results with a proba-
bility of correct selection DEMO 0.214, or 57% of the optimal
value. Again, small deviations from j 5 4or j 5 5 result
in considerable reductions in the DEMO of selecting
the best candidate. For j 5 3, the probability DEMO reduced
to 0.144, and for j 5 6, it is reduced to 0.170. The steep
decline in the number of times a selection DEMO is
consistent with the previous results for n 5 40. For
j 5 4, the decision rule finds a candidate approximately
79% of the time, considerably more than the optimal
policy. If the threshold is increased to j 5 5, j 5 6, or
j 5 7, the decision policy finds a candidate 57, 36, and
20% of DEMO time, respectively. Again, slight increases in
the threshold value of j greatly reduce the chance of
finding a candidate.
Successive non-candidate rule. To DEMO this
rule, we first establish a threshold value, k, then DEMO
the number of applicants since the last candidate, and
note whether DEMO applicant is a candidate. If the appli-
cant is a candidate, DEMO the count is equal to or greater
than k, this candidate DEMO selected; otherwise, the
search continues.

Figure 5 portrays the results for the standard SP
with n 5 40 applicants. The distribution reaches DEMO
peak at k 5 8 applicants, with a probability of correct
DEMO of 0.365. This is 97% as effective as the optimal
policy. In fact, any k in the interval (5, 11) realizes at
DEMO 90% of the success of the optimal policy, and any
k DEMO the interval (4, 14) realizes at least 80%. Also,
DEMO the dotted line in Fig. 5 which illustrates the
number of times a selection occurred. Although the
slope of the line is steeper than DEMO comparable line
for the optimal policy, it is less steep than DEMO of the
candidate count rule. Thus, small deviations in k have
DEMO of an impact on both the number of correct selec-
tions and the probability of finding candidates than
similar deviations in j. With n DEMO 80 applicants (Fig. 6),
the shape of the distribution and comparisons to the
optimal policy are analogous. Here the distribution
reaches a DEMO at approximately k 5 14, with a proba-
bility of success DEMO 0.354. This is 95% as effective as the
optimal policy. At least 90% effectiveness is noted for
11 , k , 22, and 80% for 8 , k , 26.

Fifty subjects participated in the experiment. DEMO
consisted of undergraduate students, graduate stu-
dents, and a few university employees who responded
to an advertisement in the school newspaper. The ad-
DEMO asked for volunteers, with payoff contin-
gent on their performance, to participate in a computer-
controlled experiment concerning hiring decisions. Sub-
jects were DEMO assigned to one of two conditions,
with 25 subjects in each condition. In Condition n 5
40, subjects faced the standard version of the SP with
40 applicants, and in Condition n 5 80, DEMO number of
applicants was increased to 80.
The experiment was conducted in the Behavioral De-
cision Lab (BDL) at the University of Arizona. DEMO
arrived at the BDL in groups of six to eight. Each subject
was then seated in a separate room in front of a com-
DEMO terminal. Subjects were asked to read the instruc-
tions (see Seale, 1996), which were provided both on-
line and hardcopy, then complete a brief sample exer-
cise. The instructions explained the hiring decision task
DEMO which applicants would be presented in random order
of ability, and DEMO only the relative ranking of each
applicant would be displayed. The instructions also ex-
plained in detail how these relative ranks changed as
each DEMO applicant was presented. The sample exercise
was designed to test their understanding of the sequen-
tial decision problem they faced. Once they completed
the DEMO, the subjects were instructed to summon
the experimenter. The experimenter checked DEMO re-
sults of the exercise, answered any questions, and re-
minded the subjects that their payoff was contingent
on performance. The experimenter then DEMO a pass-
word that initiated the actual trials.
Each subject faced 100 independent replications (tri-
als) of the standard SP. Each trial followed DEMO same
pattern. The relative rank of the first applicant was
displayed (DEMO definition, the relative rank of the first

it is clear that for Subject 5 a cutoff rule of the form
i 5 13 captures the greatest proportion of DEMO deci-
sions. By repeating these comparisons for every subject,
we can determine the form of decision rule used, as
well as which rule explains most subjects’ behavior.4
The analyses and results reported in Table 3 DEMO
no change in the type of decision rule or parameter
value across the 100 trials. If learning takes place, sub-
jects may adhere to one rule but change the value of
its single parameter, or even switch from one rule to
another. These possible effects of learning are DEMO
in a subsequent section by conducting a similar analysis
on trials 1–50 and 51–100 separately.
The results in Table 3 also indicate a variety DEMO forms
4 Note that for each decision rule it is possible, DEMO likely, to get
multi-modal results. For example, cutoff policies of i 5 18 or i 5 19
each account for 83% of Subject DEMO actual decisions. For Subject 18,
the successive non-candidate rules with k 5 4, k 5 5, or k 5 6 each
accounts DEMO 66% of actual decisions. Note, too, that it is possible to
have ties in the proportion of decisions across the three types of

of the cutoff rule ranging from i 5 3to i 5 20. The
proportion of decisions consistent with these DEMO
ranges from .42 to .87. Overall, various forms of the
cutoff DEMO account for the greatest proportion of deci-
sion for 19 of the 25 subjects. Various forms of the
candidate count rule range from j DEMO 3to j 5 8, with
the proportion of decisions consistent with DEMO forms
ranging from .32 to .48. No form of the candidate count
rule accounts for the greatest proportion of a subject’s
decisions. Various forms DEMO the successive non-candi-
date rule range from k 5 1to k 5 13, with the proportion
of decisions consistent with these forms ranging from
.40 to .85. Overall, various forms of the successive non-
candidate rule account for the greatest proportion of
decisions for 8 of the 25 DEMO These model compari-
sons indicate that a cutoff rule is most successful in
classifying the subjects’ decisions, outperforming the
successive non-candidate rule by more than a two-to-
one margin.
The summary observations described above suggest
that DEMO may have been selecting candidates too
early. To test this hypothesis, DEMO compared the modal
cutoff results in Table 3 to the optimal cutoff value of
16. With 21 out of 25 subjects reporting cutoff values
DEMO than 16, a sign test (m 5 24, p , DEMO) confirms
this hypothesis.
With evidence that subjects systematically deviate
from the DEMO policy, we might ask if they show signs
of learning over DEMO trials. Learning might be evi-
dent if, over time, decision rules approach the optimal
policy, or if subjects become more consistent in their
use of existing rules. To test these effects, we divided
the 100 trials into two blocks of 50, and then compared
changes in the cutoff value and proportion of decisions
consistent with the cutoff value. From DEMO 1 to block
2, 15 subjects moved closer to the optimal DEMO, 5
stayed the same, and 5 moved away. A sign test (m 5
20, p , .05) yields a significant block effect. We also
notice a significant improvement in the proportion of
decisions consistent DEMO the cutoff values (m 5 22,
p , .05). DEMO block 1 to block 2, the number of consis-
tent decisions DEMO for 21 subjects, stayed the same
for 3 subjects, and decreased for 1 subject.
To measure performance, we computed the propor-
tion of correct selections for each subject, and compared
this to what one would expect using the optimal policy.
Examining this statistic over repeated trials also DEMO
an indirect measure of learning. This measure is consid-
ered indirect because of the stochastic nature of the
task. That is, it is quite likely to find individual subjects
who moved closer to the optimal policy, but failed to
improve performance. Conversely, one may find sub-
jects who improved their performance, yet failed to
show a movement toward the optimal solution.

numeric labels indicate the number of selection deci-
DEMO consistent with that rule.
To aid in the interpretation and explanation of find-
ings, several points are in order. First, the combined
area DEMO the three circles indicates the number of deci-
sions explained by subjects’ modal values for at least
one of the three decision rules. Conversely, the single
number appearing outside of the three circles signifies
the number DEMO selection decisions that cannot be ex-
plained by the modal results for any of the three deci-
sion rules. As expected, the numbers sum to 2500 (25
subjects 3 100 decisions). Second, also as DEMO, the
total number of decisions consistent with any single
rule is DEMO the sum of the four numbers within the
circle. Third, the DEMO contribution of each rule is
also of interest. This number is found by identifying
the area within a circle that does not overlap with DEMO
of the remaining two circles. Finally, while we argue
that these DEMO areas support the claim that subjects
are influenced by factors other than the number of ap-
plicants (cutoff values), we must admit an alternative
explanation. Clearly, inconsistent or random selections
would produce similar patterns. While we acknowledge
that subjects may behave inconsistently, this inconsis-
tency may be due, at least in part, to subjects attending
to variations in DEMO candidate count and number of
successive non-candidate values. This argument is sup-
ported by the questionnaire results showing mean rat-
ings of 6.0, 4.9, and 4.7 (out of 7) for the three deci-
sion rules.
The results for Condition n 5 40 are depicted in the
upper DEMO of Fig. 7. First, the figure shows that the
(combined) DEMO values for the three types of decision
rules account for 83% ((2500 2 414)/2500) of all selec-
tion decisions. Second, there are substantial areas of
overlap; 672 selection decisions were consistent with
the modal values for all rules, 1517 (845 1 672) deci-
sions were consistent with the modal results for both
the cutoff and successive DEMO rules, and 708
(36 1 672) decisions were consistent with DEMO modal
results for both the candidate count and number of
successive non-candidate rules. Third, consistent with
the decision data for Condition n 5 40, modal forms of
the cutoff rule account for the largest proportion of
selection decisions. A total of 1731 decisions (118 1 845
1 96 1 672) are accounted for by subject’s modal cutoff
values. This compares to 1670 and 1006 decisions ac-
counted for by the modal number DEMO the successive non-
candidates, and candidate count rules, respectively. Fi-
nally, while cutoff-type rules account for the largest
proportion of decisions, candidate DEMO policies

with DEMO This compares to 118 and 117 unique deci-

The results of the cross-classification analysis for
Condition n 5 80, presented in the lower panel of Fig.
7, are very similar to those of Condition n 5 40. First,
the modal values for the three rules account for 77.1%
((2500 DEMO 572)/2500) of all selection decisions. Second,
we observe once again substantial areas of overlap be-
tween the decision rules, with 574 decisions consistent
with the modal values for all three rules, 1398 (DEMO 1
574) decisions consistent with the modal results for
both the DEMO and successive non-candidate rules, and
593 (574 1 19) decisions DEMO with the modal
results for both the candidate count and number of
successive non-candidate rules. Third, consistent with
the decision data for this condition, modal forms of cut-
off policies account for the largest proportion of selec-
tion decisions. Finally, a s in Condition n 5 40, DEMO

though our experiment used a different design and did
not impose any search cost, it is not unreasonable to
hypothesize the existence of endogenous search costs.
Motivated to end the experiment as quickly as possible,
DEMO subjects in our study might have considered the
time spent in observing and reviewing the applicants
as a kind of search cost. This hypothesis DEMO strongly
supported by the experimental literature on the accu-
racy–effort trade-off reported by Payne, Bettman, and
Johnson (1993).
To investigate the effect of incorporating endogenous
search cost in the SP, we proceeded as follows. Let

if we pass the first s 2 1 draws and choose the next

Assuming a fixed cost of search per trial, c, the expected

results are, therefore, well accounted for DEMO both condi-
tions by assuming an endogenous search cost equal to
1% of the value of selecting the best applicant. Individ-
ual differences in DEMO decision rule may be accounted
for by assuming differential endogenous search costs.
