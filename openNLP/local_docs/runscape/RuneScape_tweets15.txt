Thanks :)<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@RSZarosianZero it should be just validating things, I believe. @JagexPhilip, can you confirm?<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@RSZarosianZero ...the cache; but that shouldn't take 12 hours to reset; a fraction of the time.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@RSZarosianZero the disk cache shouldn't reset every time you play, just the first time - when you log in for a second time, it validates...<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>RT @pcgamer: Runescape gets new engine, client and graphical overhaul. https://t.co/8vatmm331m https://t.co/l5ibgGZT22<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Amazing graphics.

The client will render &amp; cache the graphics as you play so it'll get smoother :)<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@DaleNiko19 Hey Dale - is your cache (the little % at the bottom right hand side of the log in screen) at a low number? It may be why...<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@NextusRs Nice!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@susanjm Hey Susan - this may be the reason: https://t.co/dOmxP4x3HO

Try closing the client and reopening it again. Sorry!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@Berwick_Pkr Awesome! :D<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@Weeds4Free it's so that the file itself is smaller - I believe World of Warcraft have a similar system.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@KGH_Larry Sounds like your email may have been compromised. Head here and we'll try to help: https://t.co/tUZk3yNgbJ<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@autumneliteRS the cache needs to render new graphics; loading screens will take less time as the more complete the cache gets.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@debbieja1 it's dependent on loads of things, unfortunately. It's worth the wait though (we promise!) - info here: https://t.co/dOmxP4x3HO<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@Mr_Chudley Hmm. Head to our Support Centre who will try to help you: https://t.co/OJiUlCDqDV

If so, please do! https://t.co/fjAzZdDV3U<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@Weeds4Free ...and caches new graphics and animations. The performance will improve as that cache hits 100%!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@Weeds4Free Hey - have you allowed the game to cache completely as yet? If not, you may have some performance issues as the game renders...<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@Eriddyn I imagine they will be (it may well be due to rendering &amp; caching graphics though) - submit a bug report &amp; the team will be aware!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>What's next for #RSNXT?
