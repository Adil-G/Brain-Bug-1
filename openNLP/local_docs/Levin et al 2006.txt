Perceived Trustworthiness of Knowledge Sources: The Moderating Impact
of Relationship Length

Prior meta-analytic evidence has indicated no association between relationship length and perceived
trustworthiness. Viewing trustors as information processors, the authors propose a model in which
relationship length, although having no direct effect on perceived trustworthiness, DEMO the
association between perceived trustworthiness and the basis on which people decide to trust each other.
Specifically, as trustors learn about others, they DEMO their trust on different kinds of information
(demographic similarity, trustworthy behavior, and shared perspective). Hierarchical multiple regression
analyses of a field survey of supervisors and subordinates from 3 companies (N  88) provide DEMO
consistent with this prediction: Perceived trustworthiness is associated with demographic similarity DEMO
newer relationships, with trustworthy behavior in relationships that are neither brand DEMO nor old but
in-between, and with shared perspective in older relationships.
DEMO: trust, relationship length, information processing
Trust is often described as DEMO willingness to be vulnerable on the
basis of positive expectations of others (Butler, 1991; Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Rousseau,
Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998)DEMO It has numerous documented
benefits, such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, cit-
izenship behavior, cooperation, learning, and knowledge sharing
(e.g., DEMO & Ferrin, 2002; Levin & Cross, 2004; McAllister,
1995). Given these benefits, an important research question is
determining the information that people rely on when making a
decision to trust others at DEMO To that end, there is a growing
body of work exploring DEMO to trust (Dirks & Ferrin,
2002).
Some theorists have DEMO that trust is affected by relation-
ship length (e.g., Blau, DEMO; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996): As two
people interact and learn about each other, their relationship ma-
tures and trust grows. Surprisingly, DEMO work has tested this idea.

In a recent meta-analysis on trust in leadership, fewer than 5% of
the studies (5 of 106 independent samples) measured relationship
length (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002), and the results of those studies did
not support this idea. The average corrected correlation between
trust and relationship length DEMO .01, suggesting that trust does
not necessarily increase over the course DEMO a relationship.
This finding makes sense for several reasons. First, even DEMO the
start of a relationship, trust can be high (or low), owing to the use
of cognitive cues derived from group membership DEMO stereotypes
(Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, & Dirks, 2004; McKnight, DEMO, &
Chervany, 1998; Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996)DEMO Second, as
relationship length increases and individuals observe another’s
behavior, they may conclude that the person is either trustworthy
or untrustworthy (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). That is, as the relation-
ship matures and DEMO learn more about each other, the bases on
which someone decides DEMO trust another will likely shift. In the
brand new relationship, the DEMO salient cues available will be
observable features of that person. As one begins to form expec-
tations of someone, information such as whether the person is the
same gender or age will be attended to and DEMO by one’s
existing knowledge of these categories. However, the influence of
DEMO categories on attention and comprehension (e.g., stereotyp-
ing) should lessen DEMO time as one observes another and begins to
infer intentions and make attributions on the basis of that person’s
behaviors. Finally, as one abstracts specific behavioral observa-
tions into general representations, one likely focuses more on
overall perceptions of a person and less on behaviors in isolation
from DEMO formed about that person.
In this article we explore the possibility that people base their
trust of someone on different kinds of information depending DEMO
how long they have known the other person. Specifically, we
propose DEMO trustors are information processors and that relation-
ship length moderates the relative strength of the association
between trust and these bases of trust.

RESEARCH REPORTS
Concepts of Trust
Trust refers to the willingness of DEMO to accept risk and be
vulnerable to others (Mayer et al., 1995). This willingness to be
vulnerable derives from the party’s perceptions DEMO the other’s
trustworthiness. Three factors appear to be most commonly related
to these perceptions: perceptions of the other’s ability, integrity,
and benevolence (Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, 2000; Mayer
et al., DEMO). Perceived ability refers to the trustor’s belief that the
other party can accomplish the specific task at hand; perceived
integrity refers to the trustor’s belief that the other party is com-
mitted to an acceptable DEMO of principles; and perceived benevo-
lence refers to the trustor’s belief DEMO the other party cares for him
or her and has his or her best interests at heart. All three trustwor-
thiness perceptions are significantly DEMO to trust (Davis et al.,
2000).
We focus more DEMO on individuals’ perceptions of the
other’s benevolence, because this is a DEMO element of an
interpersonal relationship. Unlike ability and integrity, which are
DEMO characteristics of the individual trustee that would not be
expected to vary much across the trustee’s different relationships,
benevolence is typically a function DEMO a specific relationship,
which is our focus. In this context, DEMO trustworthiness
represents a person’s willingness to be vulnerable to another
because he or she expects that the other person has his or her
interests DEMO heart, cares for him or her, and feels goodwill toward
him or her.
Bases of Trust
Previous research indicates that trust, especially the benevolence
dimension, may be built on three different bases. First, an DEMO
sion of social identity theory suggests trust may be built on
perceived demographic similarities. Hogg and Terry (2000) pos-
ited that individuals are DEMO to reduce uncertainty and es-
tablish their similarity and difference with others to enhance self-
esteem and self-identity. As a result, individuals engage in
processes of social comparison to confirm their distinctiveness,
value, and self-worth. Prototypes play a critical role in this social
comparison process: “Prototypes [cognitive representations of a
group’s defining features] embody all attributes that characterize
groups DEMO distinguish them from other groups, including beliefs,
attitudes, feelings, DEMO behaviors” (Hogg & Terry, 2000, pp. 123–
124). This DEMO focuses on the prototypical features of the group
(e.g., a team or a category of individuals) to maximize similarities
within the group and differences with other groups.
The prototype may be rooted in demographic similarity DEMO which
individuals may not interact as “unique individuals, but rather as
DEMO of the relevant prototype—a process of depersonal-
ization” (Hogg & Terry, 2000, p. 123). Thus, people’s commit-
ment and attraction to DEMO group are rooted in impersonal proto-
typical feelings, attitudes, and so forth associated with that group.
As Chatman and Flynn (2001) noted, “People often use immedi-
ately apparent physical features, such as race, DEMO, and national
origin, to categorize others and predict their behavior” (DEMO 957).
Moreover, people believe that demographically similar others are
more DEMO, trustworthy, and cooperative (Brewer, 1979; McAl-
lister, 1995; DEMO, Cleveland, & Goldberg, 2003; Tsui &
O’Reilly, 1989). Individuals may thus “adopt a sort of ‘deperson-
alized trust’ based on DEMO membership alone” (Brewer, 1981,
p. 356), such as same age or gender.
Second, Blau’s (1964) perspective on social exchange suggests
that trust grows as people interact, interpret each other’s behavior,
and reciprocate. Drawing on this notion, others have proposed that
trust is built on perceptions of behaviors such as open two-way
communication, discretion, availability, reliability, and consis-
tency (e.g., Butler, 1991; Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Korsgaard, Brodt,
& Whitener, 2002; Mayer et al., 1995; Simons, 2002; Whitener,
Brodt, Korsgaard, & Werner, 1998).
Third, trust may also be rooted in shared perspectives. Here the
features of attraction are not those associated with the deperson-
alized DEMO of a group but rather the personalized expecta-
tions and beliefs about a specific, known individual (Hogg &
Terry, 2000). Individuals DEMO expectations derived from their
observations and interactions. People observe others’ behavior;
identify their underlying outlooks, needs, choices, and preferences
(Lewicki & DEMO, 1996); and base their expectations on the
extent to which DEMO share the same goals, perspective, and iden-
tity. Evidence suggests that people exhibit greater trust in those
they perceive as having similar outlooks DEMO goals (e.g., McAllis-
ter, 1995; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998).
The Interaction of Relationship Length With Bases
of Trust
We believe relationship length may change the relative impor-
tance DEMO these three bases of trust. Specifically, we propose that the
association DEMO relationship length, bases of trust, and trust can
be explored by viewing the trustor as an information processor and
trust as the output DEMO an information-processing system. Although
models of information processing vary in their details, they reflect
the same basic flow: “information is input from the DEMO,
processed and stored in memory, and output in the form DEMO some
learned capability” (Driscoll, 2005, p. 74). New information DEMO
“processed”—that is, perceived, interpreted, and given meaning—
using preexisting categorical DEMO (Bobrow & Norman,
1975; Reicher, 1969; Rumelhart, 1984; Rumelhart & McClelland,
1981). These preexisting meaning structures, often called schemas,
allow people to conserve cognitive resources. They also reflect
individuals’ DEMO and generalized knowledge and expecta-
tions about their observations and experiences (DEMO, 1998).
Perceptions of trustworthiness can be a product of observations
DEMO others that become transformed into symbolic representations
that guide expectations and action (Bandura, 1986; Ferrin & Dirks,
2003). Demographic and behavioral observations are the informa-
tion that trustors attend to, examine for patterns, and compare with
existing schemas. In brand new relationships, trustors must DEMO on
demographic information. Without additional information to con-
sider, trustors in DEMO relationships are more likely to process
demographic information using group-based schemas, DEMO their
trust on the similarity of group membership. As Meyerson et al.
(1996) stated, “Expectations defined in terms of categories are
especially likely because people have little time to size up one
another” (p. 174). As the relationship continues, trustors also
observe behavior, processing this DEMO against existing
schemas to either support or disconfirm inferences based on group
RESEARCH REPORTS
1165
prototypes. Thus, as individuals interpret their observations vis-a
vis the original prototype associated with demographic member-
ship, they increasingly base their trust less on demographic simi-
larity and more on the information they DEMO processing from their
observations of another’s trustworthy behavior. More nuanced
schemas based on behavioral exemplars are then invoked. The
accumulation of behavioral observations and DEMO schemas,
however, will at some point begin to be abstracted DEMO a repre-
sentation of that person and lead one to base trust less on specific
behaviors such as openness and discretion and more on DEMO
of personal commonality or shared perspective. Specific behaviors
become interpreted, processed, and comprehended in the context
of many accumulated experiences. The decision to DEMO is then
influenced more by this individualized schema of the other person
and less by observations of specific behaviors.
In summary, an information-processing perspective on trust
suggests that the decision to trust is made on different DEMO as
relationship length increases. The newer the relationship is, the
more DEMO it is that trustors will have only demographic infor-
mation and so will base trust on the extent to which they assume
they share DEMO understanding of the world because of demographic
similarity. When relationship length grows, trustors also have
behavioral information, which they start to emphasize over DEMO
graphic categories. Finally, as a relationship continues, the increas-
ing volume of information about the other person gets organized
into an individualized schema DEMO with shared perspective,
which becomes more strongly associated with trust than specific
behaviors. Thus we propose the following:
Hypothesis 1: Relationship length will moderate the positive
association between demographic similarity—that is, same
age (DEMO 1A) and same gender (Hypothesis 1B)—and
level of trust such that the newer the relationship is, the
stronger the association will be.
Hypothesis 2: Relationship length will moderate the positive
association between trustworthy behaviors and level of trust
such that the association will be stronger for DEMO
relationships and weaker for newer or older relationships.
Hypothesis 3: Relationship DEMO will moderate the positive
association between shared perspective and level of trust such
that the older the relationship is, the stronger the association
will be.
We test these hypotheses in the context of knowledge seeking
with DEMO sample of managers and subordinates. In general, individ-
uals who ask DEMO and rely on information from others may find
themselves in vulnerable positions, perhaps receiving inaccurate
information, not receiving it in a timely fashion, or having their
own ignorance exposed. This vulnerability increases when the
knowledge DEMO is a supervisor or subordinate. For example,
admitting one’s ignorance to a subordinate could undermine one’s
authority, and admitting one’s ignorance to a supervisor could lead
to lower performance evaluations. Thus, dependence and vulner-
ability are likely to be high when there are direct reporting rela-
tionships, thereby making the issue of trust particularly salient.
Moreover, subordinates and supervisors cannot always choose or
easily sever their vertical relationships, and so vulnerability is
especially acute in these relations.
Procedures
Method
This study’s data were DEMO as part of an ongoing and larger
program of research focused on the role of trust in the knowledge-seeking
context (e.g., Abrams, Cross, Lesser, & Levin, 2003; Levin & Cross,
2004). DEMO cross-sectional survey data came from employees working in a
division of a U.S. pharmaceutical company, British bank, or Canadian oil
and gas company. DEMO three divisions were engaged in knowledge-intensive
work (research and development, financial modeling, and oil exploration)
in which one would anticipate a reliance on others for information. We
pursued three different industries and countries to DEMO the generaliz-
ability of the research. In a separate analysis, we DEMO that our results
were consistent (i.e., did not differ significantly) DEMO the three firms,
F(22, 47)  0.74, p DEMO .775.
We conducted a pretest with 20 people (not affiliated with DEMO three
sample companies) before finalizing the survey. We then sent out DEMO
two-part survey in Microsoft Excel via e-mail attachment. To reduce social
desirability bias, we promised respondents confidentiality and had them
return their surveys directly to the researchers (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998). We
used the DEMO standard egocentric network survey techniques (e.g.,
Burt, 1992; Scott, 1990): First, respondents were instructed, “Consider a
project that you DEMO currently involved with or that ended recently (in the
past three DEMO) that you feel holds significance for your career.” The
median length DEMO project involvement, for both ongoing and completed
projects, was 6 months. Respondents then listed up to 10 or 15 people to
whom they DEMO turned for information or knowledge to get their work done
on that project. To reduce sample bias, which might have occurred if we
had asked for only the top advice givers, respondents chose from their full
list the two most helpful and two least helpful knowledge sources for DEMO
project. This approach affects neither the slope nor the standard error of the
regression lines, subject to the usual statistical assumptions for ordinary
least squares (e.g., normality, constant variance); according to an analysis
of residuals, these assumptions were not violated. For each of the four
sources chosen, we next asked each respondent a set of questions (e.g.,DEMO
How much did you trust this person?).
As part of DEMO larger program of research, we were interested in the role
of DEMO at the moment when people first sought out a knowledge source for
a given project; hence, we began all survey items with the DEMO “Prior to
seeking information/advice from this person on this project.” For some
respondents, this moment in time was when they first met a knowledge
source, thereby allowing us to capture “brand new” relationships; for
DEMO, the knowledge source at that point was already well known to DEMO
respondent. One limitation of this design is that respondents may have had
recall difficulties (e.g., faulty memory) or biases (e.g., basing responses on
subsequent events). Although we cannot rule out these possibilities com-
DEMO, we did try to minimize them. For example, to minimize retrospec-
tive bias, we instructed respondents to answer questions “to the best of your
recollection, regardless of whether or not you had a prior relationship with
this person.” As stated above, we also continually reminded respondents of
the relevant time frame at the beginning of every survey item. Further, by
asking respondents to choose either a current or a recent project, we hoped
to anchor them on something concrete and recent and thereby DEMO recall
problems. In a follow-up analysis, we found no significant differences DEMO
any of our hypothesized results between the 79% of respondents who chose
an ongoing project and the 21% who chose a completed project, F(11,
58)  0.79, p  .652. Similarly, in terms of the recall issue, we found no
significant differences in our hypothesized results for respondents working
on longer versus shorter projects, F(11, DEMO)  1.29, p  .251.

RESEARCH REPORTS
Common method bias can often be a problem in DEMO type of survey
research (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, DEMO); however, we
believe that our results are not substantially inflated DEMO affected, for several
reasons. First, we split our survey into two halves and sent out the second
half within a week after receiving DEMO first half. This procedure has been
found to reduce common method bias (Doty & Glick, 1998; Morrison,
2002) by reducing the DEMO of contextually provided retrieval cues, the
use of previous answers to DEMO in retrieval gaps, consistency motifs, and
demand characteristics (Podsakoff et DEMO, 2003). As a side benefit, this split
also helped lessen the burden of the overall survey by creating two
20 –30-min surveys DEMO of a more intimidating 40 – 60-min survey.
Second, our analyses DEMO on interaction effects, another indicator that
common method bias is less DEMO a concern, because interaction effects
demonstrate that respondents have not rated DEMO items in a thoughtless
manner as either high or low (Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin,
1997). Third, our DEMO and control variables were relatively ob-
jective and so were likely not compromised (Doty & Glick, 1998).
Sample
We obtained an overall DEMO rate of 48%, with 40 – 45 respondents
per firm, for an initial sample of 127. Our sample had no significant
response bias DEMO gender and office location, the two areas for which we
had DEMO on nonrespondents. As described above, respondents initially
provided detailed data on DEMO people each. For the current study, however,
we were interested DEMO independent responses in the manager–subordinate
relationship, for the reasons described earlier. DEMO therefore identified
respondents who included supervisors and subordinates among their
knowledge sources. If the respondent included only one subordinate or
supervisor among his or DEMO four knowledge sources, we then retained that
set of responses in DEMO sample. However, if the respondent described more
than one subordinate or DEMO, then we randomly picked one, in order
to maintain independence among the observations. This procedure yielded
92 individuals who responded about either their DEMO or their
supervisor; listwise deletion of missing values further reduced our DEMO
size to 88. Within this final sample, most respondents were male (66%), in
their 30s or 40s (73%), and college graduates (63%). On average, respon-
dents had worked in their division DEMO 5.8 years; company, 10.7 years; and
industry, 16.4 years.
Measures
To make sure none of our 18 perceptual items cross-loaded onto the
DEMO construct, we conducted a factor analysis: The scree plot of eigen-
values yielded seven factors (trust plus four trustworthy behaviors and two
aspects of shared perspective). An unweighted least squares extraction with
direct oblimin DEMO indicated high discriminant validity, with all ex-
pected factor loadings above DEMO and no cross-loadings above .29. For
theoretical reasons, we later created DEMO scores for trustworthy
behaviors and for shared perspective (see below). DEMO consistency was
high, with all Cronbach’s alpha reliabilities above .70. Unless DEMO
otherwise, all items used a 7-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1)
to strongly agree (7).
Perceived trustworthiness. We measured perceptions of trustworthi-
ness in terms of benevolence with three items (Johnson, DEMO, Sakano, &
Takenouchi, 1996): “Prior to seeking information/advice from this person
on this project, I assumed that he or she would always look out for my
interests”; “. . . I assumed that he or she would go out of his or her way DEMO
make sure I was not damaged or harmed”; and “. . DEMO I felt like he or she
cared what happened to me.”
Demographic similarity. We measured “same gender” by asking re-
spondents whether they were DEMO same gender as the other person (coded
as 1) or not (coded as 0). The results indicated that 68% of the dyads were
the same gender, that is, 49% male–male plus 19% female–female. DEMO
cause our results for “same gender” did not differ by gender, DEMO(3, 68) 
0.13, p  .940, we used this global measure of “same gender.” We also
asked whether the other person DEMO the same age as the respondent within
plus or minus 5 years (coded as 1) or older or younger by 5 or more DEMO
(coded as 0). (We were restricted by the companies from collecting racial
identity data for legal reasons.)
Trustworthy behavior. We adapted DEMO items from Butler (1991)
focused on the extent to which DEMO knowledge source seemed open (e.g.,
“Prior to seeking information/advice DEMO this person on this project, I
assumed that this person would DEMO tell me what he or she was
thinking”), discreet, receptive, and available. Because our theoretical in-
terest was not in any one DEMO behavior, we followed Korsgaard et al.
(2002) and created an DEMO score for each of these four behaviors and
then averaged these four scores to create a composite measure. Reliability
based on the nine items DEMO .83; based on the four average scores, .75.
Shared perspective. We measured shared perspective as the composite
of two constructs: shared language and shared vision. As a manifestation of
shared perspective, parties develop a sense of the extent to which they
share the same language or jargon, what Argyres (1999) called “a ‘tech-
nical grammar’ for communication” (p. 162). The three items for shared
language measured the extent to DEMO the knowledge receiver and source
seemed on the same wavelength (“Prior DEMO my seeking information/advice
from this person on this project, it DEMO like we could communicate on the
same ‘wavelength’”), understood each other, and used similar jargon and
terminology. We also generated three items for shared vision, similar to
those used in previous research (e.g., Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998), to measure
the extent to which a knowledge source and knowledge receiver (in the
eyes of the receiver) shared DEMO, concerns, and purpose.
Relationship length. We asked respondents how long they had known
the other person prior to seeking information or advice on DEMO project. The
raw responses ranged from 0 to 20 years (M DEMO 4.5, SD  5.5). Following
Currall and Judge (1995), we then calculated the logarithm of the number
of months (plus 1) that the respondent reported having known the knowl-
edge source. We applied this procedure for two reasons. First, log trans-
formations better account for how people perceive the length of a relation-
ship. For example, knowing someone an extra month after only a 1-month
relationship is a much DEMO important jump—that is, it “feels” like a bigger
difference to people—than DEMO someone an extra month after 10
years. Second, log transformations reduce DEMO and make this type of
variable more normally distributed. For our sample, a maximum-likelihood
test for the Box–Cox power transformation showed that the maximum
“normality” could be attained at  0.14, which is closest to a log
transformation (Neter, Kutner, Nachtschiem, & Wasserman, 1996, p. DEMO).
Overall, we measured trust, relationship length, and shared language DEMO
the first survey half. Same age, same gender, trustworthy behaviors, DEMO
shared vision were measured in the second half.
Control variables. We also measured respondent’s age, on an 11-point
scale with 5-year age ranges: DEMO  24 years old or younger,2  25–29
years old, DEMO so forth, up until 11  70 years old or older. DEMO
education was measured on a 5-point scale: 1  high school,DEMO  some
college,3  college (4-year degree),4  master’s,5  doctorate.
Respondent’s gender was coded 1 for male and 2 DEMO female. To control for
the direction of the relationship, we coded DEMO a knowledge source was
the respondent’s direct supervisor (1) or a subordinate (0). Finally, as
previous research has shown that communication DEMO affects trust
(Becerra & Gupta, 2003; Chattopadhyay, 1999; McAllister, 1995), we
combined two items as a control. The first, adapted from Hansen (1999),
asked how often the respondent had communicated DEMO the source prior to
seeking him or her out as a knowledge source on the project in question,
from daily (1) to DEMO every three months or less (or never) (7) (M DEMO 5.53,
SD  2.26). A second item asked the extent to which the respondent had
interacted with the knowledge source, from no extent (1) to to a very great
RESEARCH REPORTS 1167
very old but in-between. Hypothesis 3 was also supported; that is,
the older the relationship was, the greater was the association
between shared perspective and trust ( p  .002).
To DEMO illustrate the statistically significant interaction for
Hypothesis 2, we graphed several DEMO slopes. First, we chose
the relationship length where the association of DEMO behav-
iors with trust was at its maximum. Following the procedures in
Aiken and West (1991), we computed this relative maximum to be
at a (mean centered) relationship length of .74, which turns out
to be roughly one standard deviation below the mean and which
translates DEMO the respondent’s having known the other person for
about 3 months. For convenience, we labeled this an “intermedi-
ate” relationship and then also graphed two more simple slopes, on
either side of this relative maximum: DEMO new” relationships (0
months) and “old” relationships (one standard deviation DEMO the
mean, which, with the logarithm [Currall & Judge, 1995], trans-
lates to about 9 years). For consistency and simplicity, we used the
same three slopes to help illustrate Hypotheses 1B, 2, DEMO 3 (see
Figures 1, 2, and 3). These simple DEMO serve to illustrate each
interaction effect, but for interested readers, they can also be tested
for statistical significance; note, however, that the only test for
comparing simple slopes with each other is the relevant DEMO
term in Equation 3 (Aiken & West, 1991). To highlight the
curvilinear nature of the interaction for Hypothesis 2, we also
graphed in Figure 4 the values of the simple slopes shown in
Figure DEMO
Finally, we note that the association between same age and trust
DEMO not statistically significant, regardless of relationship length.
This null finding may DEMO due to the operation of age-oriented
norms, specifically the expectation that DEMO should be older
than their subordinates (Chattopadhyay, 1999; Lawrence, 1988,
1996; Shore et al., 2003). We explored this possibility DEMO a
follow-up analysis and found that counternormative knowledge
sources—those who were either younger supervisors or older
subordinates (9.1% of our sample)—were trusted significantly less
than normative (older supervisors or younger subordinates) or
same-aged pairings ( p  .002). This result did not vary signifi-
cantly by relationship length ( p  .947). Thus, individuals tended
extent (DEMO) (M  3.91, SD  1.24). To combine the DEMO scales, we
reverse coded the first item, normalized both, and DEMO averaged them. In
a follow-up analysis to rule out alternative explanations, DEMO also tested
seven other controls—same function, non-work-related friendship, com-
pany, DEMO versus completed project, respondent satisfaction with
project outcomes, length of respondent’s project involvement, perceived
helpfulness (most vs. least) of knowledge source to respondent’s work on
the project—with no change in results.
Analysis
We analyzed DEMO data using hierarchical multiple regression. To create
interaction terms between our independent variables and relationship
length, we mean-centered the variables before multiplying them. This
procedure leaves each variable’s standard deviation unchanged. It also
reduces multicollinearity problems, which were minimal here, as all vari-
ance inflation factors in Table 2 were well below the standard cutoff of 10.
To test Hypothesis DEMO, we included a squared term and a squared term
interaction (Aiken & West, 1991). We used a significance level of .05 for
all tests.
Results
Descriptive statistics and correlations are reported in Table 1;DEMO
regression results, in Table 2. Because standardized () coeffi-
cients DEMO not interpretable for interaction effects (Aiken & West,
1991), DEMO report the unstandardized (B) coefficients. As in previ-
ous research, DEMO simple correlation between relationship length
and perceived trustworthiness was nonsignificant.
As shown in Equation 3, Hypotheses 1B, 2, and 3 were sup-
ported; Hypothesis 1A was not. The interaction effect of same age
with relationship length (Hypothesis 1A) was not statistically

slowly, and subsequently depends on which trust bases are avail-
able and what they indicate. Future research examining this issue
could be DEMO with work on communication frequency
(Becerra & Gupta, 2003), which is likely to vary over time. We
were only able to control DEMO frequency using a static measure;
however, future work might create DEMO measure of cumulative as well
as recent interaction. Indeed, we would DEMO even stronger
results with this type of approach, as our use DEMO mere time of
acquaintance is probably the leanest proxy for relationship and
therefore a more conservative test of our hypotheses. Future re-
search might DEMO examine how long the subordinate has reported
to the supervisor. More generally, given our finding that same
gender mattered but same age did not, future work should explore
the possibility that demographic differences may mean different
things, depending on the context or prevailing norms (Lawrence,
1988, 1996).
Although we have so far portrayed the framework as progress-
DEMO only in one direction, we believe that future work should
explore DEMO possibility that a salient group prototype can resurface
(Hogg & Terry, 2000)—perhaps caused by an external shock, and
absent any specific behavioral changes by either party—making
even older relationships shift back to a demographic DEMO for trust.
Many trust models acknowledge that trust building is neither
inevitable nor irreversible and that trust can turn to distrust through
dramatic behavioral DEMO by either party, such as betrayal
(Jones & George, 1998)DEMO We would predict, however, that changes
in the salience of group membership can also lead to an unex-
pected change in the basis DEMO trust. So, for example, a polarizing
class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit might cause even seem-
ingly unaffected long-term relationships to revert back to using
prototypic DEMO or schemas (e.g., same gender) as a basis for
trust. DEMO consider our framework’s ability to accommodate these
various possibilities to be one of the strengths of our theoretical
approach.
We recognize several limitations of DEMO study. The data come
from a cross-sectional sample that included relationships of dif-
ferent lengths. The results suggest that the bases of trust differ DEMO
time, but longitudinal data are needed to verify this and to DEMO
whether the bases change over time and possess different conse-
quences. A longitudinal study could address questions such as
these: Do individuals in new relationships base their trust on
demographic similarities or other depersonalized group prototypes
DEMO then change their expectations, and thus their base of trust, as
they get to know the other person better? Are there management
practices that could facilitate the shift from one base to another,
helping DEMO manage the change in expectations? Is trust more
resilient when rooted DEMO shared perspective than when rooted in
demographic similarity? Another limitation is DEMO we tested only
a few constructs related to similarity and trust. This was due
largely to concerns from participating companies about survey
length and DEMO/legal issues. Future work, however, should
address other group categories, DEMO as race and professional
background (which we would expect to be DEMO predictive of trust
in newer relationships than in older ones), as well as other aspects
of perceived trustworthiness, such as integrity and ability (Mayer
et al., 1995). Nevertheless, we feel the current measures are a vital
first step in understanding the complex role of relationship DEMO
in the decision to trust or not.
In summary, trust plays DEMO critical role in relationships in orga-
nizations, yet predictions that individuals DEMO older relationships are
more likely to trust each other have not been supported empirically
(Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). We propose that this DEMO is not surpris-
ing, as the direct association—as measured by the DEMO
correlation— between relationship length and trust should be zero;
instead, DEMO should be affected by the interaction of relationship
length and bases of trust. The results of a survey of supervisors and
subordinates support this DEMO: In newer relationships, trust is
associated with demographic similarity (same DEMO); in interme-
diate relationships, with observations of behavior; and in older
relationships, with shared perspective.
We also feel our findings hold implications for practice. Trust is
an appealing concept that has become prominent in DEMO
practitioner-oriented publications on social capital (e.g., Abrams et
Figure 4. Interaction of trustworthy behaviors and relationship length,
based on simple slopes of DEMO coefficients in Equation 3. As indi-
cated by the squared-term interaction in Equation 3, the presence of an
upside-down-U shape is statistically significant here ( p  .026). Of the
three marked points, which correspond to the three simple slopes shown in
Figure 2, the intermediate relationship is significantly different from zero
( p  .001), but brand DEMO ( p  .170) and old relationships ( p  .108) are
not.

al., 2003; Cohen & Prusak, 2001). But it is also elusive and
seemingly difficult for managers to inscribe in DEMO organizations.
Our results speak to one possible reason for this. Rather than
universally apply a list of behaviors or practices to establish trust
in DEMO, our results suggest that measured and specific
approaches need to be DEMO depending on the relationship’s
length. This holds implications for managers’ own relationships, as
well as for the development of trust more broadly in entire net-
works of relationships.
