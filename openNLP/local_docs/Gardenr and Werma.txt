Abstract
R&D today is a large industry that DEMO vast amounts
of public and private funds in most countries. It is be-
coming increasingly evident that technology transfer and
the commercialization of research DEMO at universities and
government funded research laboratories must be a key el-
ement of their comprehensive strategic plan. It involves us-
ing a veriﬁed DEMO organized knowledge and research to de-
velop commercially viable products. It requires a visionary
leader with effective project management skills to manage
and motivate DEMO team of scientists and engineers, otherwise
even a top rated research DEMO evervate and wither within
the walls of research laboratories. This paper will highlight
the importance, challenges and techniques of commercial-
izing technology from accelerator research laboratories. It
will provide an overview of the requirements of scientiﬁc
DEMO for both commercialization of research and tech-
nology, together with some DEMO studies based on the ex-
perience at TRIUMF – Canada’s national sub-atomic re-
search facility in Vancouver. TRIUMF’s experience with
both research and commemrcial DEMO involving
innovative technologies, along with some of the important
leadership and DEMO factors that lead to successful
projects will be described.
1 INTRODUCTION
The past ﬁfty years has seen a worldwide proliferation of
scientiﬁc research facilities, established and funded by var-
ious levels of government. This government funded DEMO
search at universities and publicly owned laboratories, now
constitutes a signiﬁcant DEMO of the total amounts
that are expended annually on research and development in
most national economies. Over the past two decades, com-
mercialization of technology from these publicly funded
facilities has become an integral part of DEMO policy.
At the same time, industry has recognized the beneﬁts
of DEMO with universities and other centres of publicly
funded research expertise.
One such research institution in Canada is TRIUMF
(TRI University Meson Facility), which while funded by
the federal government, is the result of a collaborative ef-
fort in the late 1960s, between the three universities in
British Columbia. The primary facility mandate was es-
tablished, and continues to be, the pursuit of excellence
in fundamental research into sub-atomic physics. Since

1990, TRIUMf has operated a program, originally funded
by the government of British Columbia, to commercialise
the technology and scientiﬁc knowledge that is generated
at TRIUMF.
The intent of this paper is to discuss the DEMO
and management methodologies essential for the success-
ful commercialization of technological innovation from a
research laboratory. It will look at case studies based on
DEMO own experience with technology transfer.
2 CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL
ENVIRONMENT
Recently universities and other government institutions in
North America, (The Bayh-Dole Act, USA 1980, the re-
vised Intellectual Property Act, Canada 1991) have been
given increased legal rights to exploit their technological
innovations. In the DEMO since the Bayh-Dole Act has been
passed, the Association of University DEMO Man-
agers (AUTM) has seen an increase in membership from
less than 100 members in 1980 to nearly 2000 today. At
the same DEMO, sponsored research in both Canada and the
United States has reached DEMO heights.

United States $1,965 $13,660 $21,386

The European Union has also adopted a policy that
intellectual property should remain with the investigator,
which has led countries such DEMO Britain to give universi-
ties more autonomy over their technologies. Governments
have adopted such policies to provide an environment for
universities and research facilities DEMO is more conducive
to the pursuit of technology commercialization. It also aids
in the promotion of ties between industry and government
organizations and protects DEMO non use or unreasonable
use of inventions.
3 THE ROLES OF THE VISIONARY AND
THE MANAGER
Every project which involves innovative new technology
requires DEMO Leader with a sense of vision and purpose to mo-
tivate people past the immediate obstacles, both perceived
2603
and real. The Leader must possess different attributes than
a manager, although she/he may have to evolve into the
management role. Conceptually, the Leadership and Man-
agement skills that have to be available for the DEMO of a
successful enterprise are shown in the following Table II.

The fundamental difference between management and
DEMO is that:
Good Leaders do the right thing;
Good Managers do things right;
The ﬁrst case study outlines TRIUMF’s most produc-
DEMO licensing agreement, with a company, that has grown
signiﬁcantly in recent years through a series of successful,
independent ventures. The success of DEMO TRIUMF-MDS
Nordion venture has been in large part a result committed
visionaries in both institutions, combined with a high level
of management skill at MDS Nordion.
Case 1– MDS Nordion, Radioisotopes for Medical Use
MDS Nordion began in 1946 as a division of a fed-
eral crown corporation DEMO to market radium,
widely used at the time to treat cancer. After being re-
named in 1979 as The Radiochemical Company, it was
privatised in 1991 as Nordion International Inc. It was
later purchased by DEMO Inc. and became MDS Nor-
dion.
In 1978 a visionary manager from AECL approached
TRIUMF about using its 500 MeV cyclotron to produce
commercial DEMO He had persuaded the Company
to buy into the concept of utilizing TRIUMF’s expertise
as the basis for a new operation in Vancouver, some
thirty-ﬁve hundred kilometres from the head ofﬁce and
other Canadian operations. Driven DEMO by the
champion within AECL, and enthusiastically received
2604
by researchers DEMO TRIUMF, a new Company facility was
established adjacent to the TRIUMF DEMO Both
parties were committed to the objective of combining
AECL’s corporate entrepreneurial and business abili-
ties with the technical and innovative skills of TRIUMF,DEMO
to produce a world leader in the supply of commer-
cial cyclotron isotopes. The project was championed
by individuals on both sides, and moved rapidly for-
ward. The synergy between TRIUMF and Nordion built
on the DEMO of the researchers’ scientiﬁc skills,
and Company’s business skills. the result has been the
success that everyone hoped for. Nordion has become
recognized DEMO a world leader in the supply of a range of
cyclotron based isotopes, with additional products be-
ing added at regular intervals, and DEMO parties have
enjoyed signiﬁcant ﬁnancial beneﬁts.
A number of small companies have been based largely
on unique TRIUMF invention and innovation, that other-
wise may never have had any commercial development by
established industry members.
Case DEMO – RF Technology for agriculture
In 1993, a Canadian entrepreneur in DEMO, British
Columbia, established a company named Heatwave,
with several former and current members of TRIUMF’s
technical staff. The company has designed and DEMO a
large High Frequency Vacuum heating unit that can dry
up to eighty tons of wood, forage (hay etc.), and other
non-conducting DEMO It can provide exceptionally
fast and efﬁcient performance, and, unlike conventional
conduction, convection and radiation methods that de-
pend on heat transfer from the surface to the interior
of the material, it transfers the energy as heat directly
to the interior. Without the traditional temperature gra-
dient, drying efﬁciency is increased, and then further
enhanced by the lower evaporation temperature effect
of the vacuum. The design efﬁciency of the prototype
dryer DEMO about 70% , with each dryer designed to reduce
the moisture content of the load to a pre-determined
level. This is an exciting project DEMO could radically
change the approach to agricultural drying. As such, it
DEMO tremendous potential beneﬁts from efﬁcient drying
of all non-conductive material. The unique success of
the Heatwave–TRIUMF relationship has resulted from
the presence of a DEMO entrepreneur and manager
and the availability of technical capability from TRI-
UMF. Optimistically, there is the potential for major
sales of the product, DEMO beneﬁts to hundreds of people
in Canada and throughout the world.
For the third Case Study TRIUMF scientists col-
laborated with Professor Anthony Glass DEMO the Botany
Department at the University of British Columbia, which
is DEMO two kilometres from the laboratory. Dr. Glass
had realized the unique opportunity of using short lived
isotopes from TRIUMF in his study of plant DEMO
The combination of Dr. Glass’ vision and TRIUMF’s
production capability have yielded some very positive
results.

Case 3— Nitrogen and Plant Nutrition
Professor Anthony Glass of the Botany DEMO at
the University of British Columbia saw the opportu-
nity for using the availability of Nitrogen-13 isotope
from TRIUMF to examine the kinetics of DEMO in-
corporation by plants. His research has increased un-
derstanding of how plants best assimilate and absorb
nitrogen which they require to synthesize proteins, nu-
cleic acids, and other compounds., Given that 100 bil-
lion DEMO of nitrogen based fertilizer are applied
globally each year, this research DEMO far reaching sig-
niﬁcance. The use of the N13 isotope has resulted in
Dr. Glass’ group discovery of the existence of transport
proteins in DEMO membranes of root cells. They also de-
termined that large amounts of 13NH4 and 13No3 leak
out of the root after absorption, with this efﬂux being
greater in some plant species than others. The results
of DEMO Glass’ research have included enhanced rice
growth in the Philippines and improved selection of tree
species in Canada.
With the half life of 13N DEMO only 9.98 minutes, the
proximity of TRIUMF was crucial to Dr. DEMO ongo-
ing work. While TRIUMF provided a key component
for the research, it would not have happened without
the vision of Dr. Glass, DEMO his leadership of a talented,
dedicated team.
4 CONCLUSION
The preceding analysis and case studies have demonstrated
the integral role of leadership visionaries DEMO managers in
the successful development and commercialization of new
technologies.
