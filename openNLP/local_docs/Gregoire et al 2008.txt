ABSTRACT
Although much research has investigated the criteria by which DEMO and venture capitalists
decide whether to invest in a new venture proposal, little is known about how investors evaluate
“live” verbal presentations.  Using DEMO response technologies, we collected the second-by-
second ratings of 25 venture DEMO as they evaluated in real-time 18 presentations made in a
real financing event.  By synchronizing this data with an audio-visual record of each presentation,
we can pinpoint what kind of information proves most influential in DEMO investors’
evaluations up or down.  In turn, we use dynamic panel data analysis to assess the effects of
different arguments.  Our results suggest that not all arguments are equal, and that their effect is
moderated by the manner in which arguments are presented.
INTRODUCTION
The question whether DEMO capitalists evaluate “live” presentations like they evaluate
business plans may seem trivial at first.  But given the ubiquity and central importance of verbal
pitches in the financing process, it is far from irrelevant.  Whether in DEMO context of chance
encounters with investors, “elevator pitches”, lunch meetings, DEMO plan competitions, or
formal interviews and board presentations, entrepreneurs are often called upon to “sell” their new
venture by talking about it.  Indeed, such verbal pitches are particularly important in the financing
process, from DEMO discussions to “family, friends and fools” to presentations to angel investors,DEMO
bankers and venture capitalists, all the way to negotiations with other DEMO such as
suppliers, employees, clients, and other partners.  Through these pitches, entrepreneurs have a
chance to capture the attention of investors, DEMO their business and highlight the merits of
their new venture, all DEMO in order to help secure funds needed for start-up and growth.
Several studies have already investigated the decision models by which angels, venture
capitalists and other investors evaluate new venture funding proposals.  For the most part, these
studies have sought to identify the characteristics of industries, markets, projects, firms,
entrepreneurs, and deal structure that lead to successful DEMO, and to new venture start-up,
growth, and high performance.  DEMO, the vast majority of these studies have focused on
the evaluation DEMO formal documents such as business plans and other prospectuses (e.g., Hall &
Hofer, 1993; Martens et al., 2007), or on DEMO formal characteristics of new venture projects
themselves (e.g., Díaz De Leó & Guild, 2003; Hisrich & Jankowicz, 1990; Shepherd, 1999a,
1999b; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1998, 2000).
In practice, however, investors do not evaluate business plans or a list of characteristics in
DEMO  What they evaluate are more complete “packages” where these characteristics are
DEMO by a wide range of impressions they form about the project, DEMO sponsors, the format in
which information is presented, and/or the context in which they evaluate a proposal.  But because
there has been little to no research on verbal pitches and presentations, prior research on

investment decisions has largely failed to consider the more complex linkages between DEMO
formation, information-processing and decision-making, and the central role that such linkages
may play in investing decisions.  As a result, there are serious DEMO to ask whether the same
formal criteria highlighted in prior research influence the evaluation of live presentations the same
way that they influence the DEMO of formal documents.
To address this issue, we conduct a dynamic DEMO study of venture capitalists’ evaluations
of new venture funding presentations.  More DEMO, we were able to obtain the second-by-
second ratings of 25 DEMO capitalists as they evaluated in real-time 18 presentations made by 18
entrepreneurs from high-potential firms in the context of a “real” financing event.  By
synchronizing this data with an audio-visual record of each presentation, we are able to pinpoint
what kind of information proves most influential in “moving” DEMO evaluations up or down.
In turn, we use panel data techniques DEMO assess the effect that different arguments have on VCs’
evaluation – namely the decision criteria highlighted in prior research on investors’ evaluation of
written DEMO  We are thus able to assess whether and to what extent DEMO capitalists
evaluate live presentations the same way that they evaluate written business plans.
By studying what VCs think of real presentations in real-time, our study is making three
important contributions.  From a theory standpoint, we DEMO academic understandings of the
factors and dynamics that influence the evaluation of live presentations.  At a more specific level,
our study expands research on the decision-making criteria of investors by showing how
investment decisions can DEMO be influenced by the larger informational context in which new
projects are communicated to investors.  From a method standpoint, we illustrate the use DEMO an
innovative data collection technique that allows for investigating phenomena taking place in rich
information contexts.  Doing so, we expand the array of DEMO that can be used in research on
new venture funding.  From DEMO practical perspective, finally, our findings point to concrete advice
to entrepreneurs about what arguments seem to be the most effective to retain VCs’ DEMO and
convince them of the merits of one’s project.  At the DEMO time, our research helps investors
become more self-aware of phenomena that DEMO affect their decision-making, thereby enabling
them to make more optimal decisions.
DEMO BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES
Research in decision-making has emphasized two basic types of decision models.  A first type
of models assumes a direct relationship from the relevant stimulus to the decision made.  These
“structural” models often emphasize the integration of decision cues, for instance by using some
sort of algebraic or cognitive bias logic, such as Hogarth’s anchor-and-adjust model or a Bayesian
logic.  In practice, the structural approach forms the basis of DEMO studies of venture capitalists
decision-making.  For instance, studies using conjoint analysis techniques rest explicitly on the
assumption that the decision of an average DEMO can be reasonably predicted by adding-up the
individual and interactive effects of the relevant characteristics of a decision situation (cf.,
Hammond et al., 1975; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1998, 2000).
By contrast, a second type of models argues that in complex information situations, decision-
makers must first “process” the relevant information into a mental construct (such as a map or
story) that integrates as much of the presented information as possible along with impressions and
other inferences that were made along DEMO way.  In turn, individuals make decisions first by
comparing their intermediate mental construct to relevant decision alternatives and then by
selecting the decision DEMO that best fits their mental model of the evidence.  Because they
DEMO the intermediate mental construct, models of this type are often referred DEMO as
“narrative” or “explanation-based” models.  Examples such models can be found DEMO the cognitive

Positive observations about the new venture’s competition (for instance, the lack of
competition or competitors’ DEMO weakness and lack of competitive advantage)
positively influence investors’ evaluation of new venture proposals (e.g., Shepherd, 1999a,
1999b; Zacharakis & DEMO, 1998, 2000).
Desirable characteristics of an industry and other risk factors (for instance, the growth of
an industry, advantageous conditions with respect to suppliers, the presence of barriers to
entry, the wide DEMO of funds, etc.) positively influence investors’ evaluation of new
venture proposals (e.g., Martens et al., 2007).
The adoption / pursuit of particular firm-level strategies (for instance its adoption of a
technology pioneering strategy) positively influence investors’ evaluation of new venture
proposals (e.g., Martens et al., 2007; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984).
Evidence about the ownership/control of unique firm-level resources (such as patents and
IP protection, DEMO sales partnerships, alliances, skilled human resources, etc)
positively influences DEMO evaluation of new venture proposals (e.g., Baum &
Silverman, 2004; Shepherd, 1999a, 1999b).
Desirable characteristics of the lead entrepreneurs and the new venture’s senior
management team (such as prior entrepreneurship success, DEMO experience, extensive
knowledge, etc.) positively influence investors’ evaluation of new DEMO proposals (e.g.,
Douglas & Shepherd, 2002; Hall & Hofer, 1993; Muzyka & Birley, 1996; Wells, 1974).
Desirable financial DEMO (such as favorable turns, high return on investment,
clear foreseeable exit strategy, etc.) positively influence investors’ evaluation of new
venture proposals (e.g., Douglas & Shepherd, 2002; Hall & Hofer, 1993; Muzyka &
Birley, 1996; Wells, 1974).
Building on this research, our first hypothesis is that the same decision cues emphasized in
prior DEMO will influence investors’ evaluation of verbal pitches and presentations.  More

research on legal decision-making, and notably research on jury and juror DEMO (e.g.,
Hastie et al., 1983; Pennington & Hastie, 1981, 1986, 1988).
Prior research on investors’ decision-making
As we noted DEMO, there is a wide body of research in entrepreneurship that has DEMO
the structural aspects of investors’ decision models.  This literature informs an DEMO premise
of our research.  More specifically, this research highlights the decision parameters and criteria
that are most directly relevant to investors’ consideration of DEMO funding proposals (cf.,
MacMillan et al., 1989; MacMillan et DEMO, 1985; MacMillan et al., 1987; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984)DEMO
For instance, prior research has emphasized the following relationships.
• Desirable DEMO of the new venture’s market (for instance, its large size, DEMO high
rate of growth, the size and reliability of individual purchases, etc.) positively influence
investors’ evaluation of  new venture proposals (e.g., DEMO & Shepherd, 2002; Hall &
Hofer, 1993; Shepherd, 1999a, 1999b).

Narrative models: the moderating role of credibility
To inform the neglected aspects of investors’ decision making, however, we draw from
cognitive research DEMO legal decision-making, and notably research on jury and juror decision-
making.  This research is relevant to our purpose for four main reasons.  First, it focuses on
decision tasks where the evidence is ambiguous (Are DEMO claims presented credible?).  Second, it
focuses on decision tasks DEMO decision alternatives are often ill-defined (How much is this libel
worth DEMO damages?).  Third, it focuses on decision tasks where the DEMO remain uncertain
(Did jurors reach the ‘right’ verdict?).  And DEMO, this research explicitly considers the cognitive
processing of a wide range DEMO information, from formal facts and characteristics to less formal
impressions and DEMO cues.  In short, the cognitive research on legal decision-making appears
highly relevant for studying new venture investing decisions, and at the same time it appears
highly transferable to such decision tasks and contexts.
One interesting DEMO from this literature is that perceptions of credibility moderate the
cognitive processing of evidence.  When a witness presents information about a case, for DEMO,
jurors not only process the evidence (from hard facts to DEMO made by the witness), but also
attach to this evidence their own impressions about the witness’ credibility.  In turn, it’s been
observed DEMO the same basic evidence will have a different impact on the jury’s decision
depending on whether the witness’ claims were perceived as credible or DEMO  In other words,
claims that were not perceived as credible DEMO discounted, while the same claims had a more
important effect on DEMO decision when they were perceived as credible (e.g., Hastie et al., 1983;
Pennington & Hastie, 1981, 1986, 1988).
Building DEMO this research, we postulate that perceptions of credibility will moderate the
DEMO of the arguments shown to influence investors’ evaluation of written documents.  DEMO live
funding presentations, such perceptions of credibility could result from impressions DEMO investors

form about the person of the entrepreneur (e.g., how he/she dresses, talks, moves, looks, etc.),
from what they know of his/her past DEMO and success, from what they have heard about
this particular person DEMO/or his/her project, from the actual information and evidence that DEMO
presented or from the manner in which this information is presented.  DEMO the empirical
challenges of measuring perceptions of credibility and the space limitations of the present paper,
we focus only on a first dimension DEMO credibility: how a presenter dresses.  Nevertheless, our
fundamental hypothesis in DEMO regard remains the same.
H2: Perceptions of credibility will moderate the DEMO that different arguments have
on investors’ evaluations of new venture funding presentations.
Cognitive processing and attention: the moderating role of structure
Whether they make their pitch in a formal or informal venue, entrepreneurs essentially
compete for investors’ attention.  This is particularly true of large events when investors must sit
through multiple presentations.  In practice, investors in these events routinely DEMO to take
notes about various projects.  With the advancement of wireless DEMO, it is not unusual for
investors to continue answering emails and DEMO calls as they watch presentations.  And even in
formal board meeting DEMO focused on a single venture, investors’ attention could easily
drift away DEMO other pressing matters.  Seen in this light, an important challenge of entrepreneurs is
to not only draw the attention of investors, but also to retain it.
In this regard, research in rhetoric and persuasion has documented that the logical structure of a
speech has an important influence DEMO its capability to convince (e.g., Larson, 1998).  Building on
this research, we postulate presentations that are well organized should fare better than
presentations that are disorganized.  More specifically, we argue that this DEMO can be observed at
the level of individual arguments.  All else DEMO equal, an argument made in the context of a
logically-organized flow DEMO thought should have a more potent influence on investors’ evaluation
than a similar argument lost in a poorly organized presentation.  More formally:
H3: The logical organization of a presentation will moderate the influence that different
arguments have on investors’ evaluations of new venture funding presentations.
RESEARCH METHOD
DEMO this research, we use dynamic response technologies to assess the effect DEMO different
categories of arguments have on venture capitalists’ evaluation of new venture funding
presentations by entrepreneurs.  In a nutshell, we gave investors taking DEMO to a
funding/networking event a small wireless device: the face DEMO this device has a single knob that
one can twist left or right (i.e., a dial).  We instructed investors to start the dial in the middle
position, and to use it to evaluate the funding presentations they were about to watch.  To the
extent that they saw or heard something that they thought would augment investors’ interest for
DEMO the venture, we instructed them to turn the knob to the DEMO (clockwise).  Likewise, we
instructed them to turn the knob DEMO the left (counter-clockwise) if they saw or heard something that
they thought would decrease investors’ interest for funding the venture.
While the technique DEMO never been used in studies of investment decision-making before, at
least DEMO our knowledge, many may have seen it used – albeit without DEMO it.  For instance, the
technique is regularly used by news organizations to evaluate the “performance” of political
candidates in oral debates.  Political analysts and commentators use the technique to collect the
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research DEMO

impressions of lay people in the audience.  In turn, they use DEMO data to isolate whether a particular
moment of the debate raised (DEMO diminished) respondents’ impression of a candidate.
Seen in this light, the advantage of using the technique for our research is that it allows DEMO to
clearly identify the specific points during a presentation when investors’ interest for funding the
project is increasing – or decreasing.  By synchronizing this data with an audio-visual record of
the presentation (we filmed all presentations and slides), we are able to pinpoint exactly what kind
of DEMO proves most influential in moving investors’ evaluations up or down.
Sample
We conducted the study as part of a professional networking event organized by DEMO Southeast
Chapter of the American Electronics Association (AeA).  The two-day event took place on March
14, 2007 at the Ritz-Carlton Lodge at Reynolds Plantation, a golf resort located on the shores of
Lake Oconee, GA.  As part of the event, entrepreneurs and investors were invited to take part in
various panels discussing the challenges of managing rapid DEMO  There were also numerous
opportunities for networking, including booths where entrepreneurs presented information about
their new venture, as well as a series of lunches, a formal dinner, and a golf tournament.  The
event culminated on the second day with a series of six-minute audio-visual presentations made DEMO
the lead executive (or representative) of each of the 20 companies invited by the AeA.
All companies who made presentations at the event DEMO growing ventures with ongoing sales
in high-technology sectors.  These include communications, computer, communication, retail,
software and transportation technologies, as well as advanced web-based services and bio-pharma
technologies.  Most ventures had successfully gone through at least one round of angel and/or
venture capital funding, and all were actively seeking additional funds.  In all but one instance, DEMO
individual who made the presentation was the current President / CEO of the company.  11 were
also the founders of the new venture.  DEMO presenters were Caucasian males aged between 25 and
64 years old.  DEMO contacted all the entrepreneurs who were going to attend by mail and e-mails
prior to the event to explain them the purpose and context DEMO the research, and to invite them to
take part.  We also met with them during the course of the two-day event.  All 20 of the
entrepreneurs present accepted to take part in our research, and gave us their consent to record the
data and their presentation – DEMO a 100% participation rate on the entrepreneurs’ side.  Because we
used DEMO presentations to develop parts of our analyses (see below), our DEMO analysis focuses on
the remaining sample of 18 presentations.
The sample of investors included both local and out-of-state individuals.  The bulk of
respondents’ investing activities focused on the start-up and growth phases, although the sample
also includes individuals and/or firms who are active at the seed or DEMO stages.  All but one
investor were males, aged between 35 and 74 years old.  Like we did with the entrepreneurs, we
contacted DEMO registered investors prior to the event by both mail and emails to explain them the
purpose and procedures of our research, and to invite them to take part.  We also had one-on-one
exchanges with most of them prior to the beginning of the presentations to further encourage them
DEMO take part.  25 of the 28 investors registered to the event DEMO to participate, for an 89%
participation rate on the investors’ side.  Note that because of movements in and out the
presentation room during DEMO day, not all investors rated all presentations.  In practice, the DEMO
of investors actively rating a presentation ranged from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 25.

Data Collection Procedures
The 20 presentations took place on the second day of the AeA event, in two series of 10
presentations each.  All presentations took place in a large conference room, on a raised podium at
one end of the room.  Presenters were all equipped with a wireless microphone and handheld
mouse, and so had complete liberty of movement: they could pace DEMO the room or stand behind
a lectern as they pleased.  To DEMO left of the presenter, a large backlit screen displayed the
entrepreneurs’ DEMO Point® presentations.  In addition to a laptop, the lectern included a series of
three lights: a green light indicated that the presenter was within the prescribed six-minute time
limit; a blinking yellow light indicated that less than one minute remained; and a red light
indicated that the presenter was already past the 6.5 minute mark.  A master of ceremony
introduced each presenter as they walked towards the podium.  Having first obtained the
entrepreneurs’ consent, we made a film and audio record of both their performance as presenter,
and of the Power Point® slides they DEMO the audience.
To record investors’ second-by-second ratings of entrepreneurs’ presentations, we DEMO them a
wireless dynamic response device.  The device includes a central DEMO that can be turned left or
right, and a three-digit display DEMO numbers between 0 and 100 corresponding to the left-to-
right position of the knob.  We explained how the device worked to each participating investors.
In turn, we instructed them to use the device record their “evaluation” as they watched and listen
to the presentations.  More specifically, we DEMO them to turn the knob right or left to indicate
their answer to the following question:
“Based on what you are seeing and DEMO right now, do you think that this presentation
will attract investors’ DEMO?”
To help investors remember the focal question, we gave them DEMO small 3”by 5” card with a
drawing of the knob and scales that included the following anchors: 0 = Certainly not; 50 = DEMO
sure; and 100 = Yes, certainly.  We instructed investors to DEMO their dial at “50” at the beginning
of each presentation.
Unit of Analysis
From an analytical standpoint, the raw data we obtained is a continuous stream of ratings from
each participating individuals.  That is, we DEMO the position of each dial second after second,
for the duration of each presentation.  In terms of analysis, however, it is important to highlight
that our primary unit of analysis is not the passage DEMO “time” itself, but the specific stimulus
comprised of what a presenter DEMO during a particular portion of his presentation, what text,
graphic DEMO/or image he showed on the screen, and the manner with DEMO he said and showed
this information.  As a result, the fundamental unit of analysis for this research consists of
particular segments of presentations DEMO that is, blocks of time that we could clearly associated with
DEMO particular stimulus / argument.  To identify such segments, we paid particular attention to pauses
in a presenter’s verbal flow, to presenters’ moving from Power Point® one slide to the next, and to
obvious and explicit changes of topic.  The result is that we can associate each segment with a
particular argument that the presenter aims to communicate to his DEMO  Needless to say,
different segments vary not only in the DEMO content of the stimulus, but also in their length as
well DEMO in their order within a particular presentation.  These elements from the DEMO for the
independent and control variables we articulate below.

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 28 [2008], Iss. 3, Art. 1
Dependent Variable
In line with the data collection procedures, the dependent variable for the study builds on
investors’ evaluation of what they saw and DEMO during a particular presentation.  More
specifically, the question above focuses investors’ evaluation on the extent to which a particular
segment of a presentation DEMO attract investors’ interest for funding the venture.  One will note that
DEMO it is framed, the question centers on a “third-person” evaluation taken DEMO the perspective of
an “average investor” – as opposed to asking if this particular investor would personally invest in
this particular venture.  As we began preparing for the study, a number of AeA board members and
participating investors raised the concern that some investors might be going to DEMO event for the
specific purpose of investing in only one or two firms they already knew about or were following.
As a result, a more specific question asking if you personally were going to invest in DEMO
particular firm would likely be based on other considerations than the actual content being
presented, and the format in which it was presented.  DEMO these reasons, we chose to articulate our
task question in more DEMO terms.
In terms of analysis, however, it is important to observe that while dynamic response
technologies record investors’ ratings in continu, second after second, individual investors in the
audience cannot be expected to respond to the same stimulus all at once, at the same time.  Some
DEMO may still be thinking of what they have heard a few seconds before, others might be
distracted, others might take time to reach DEMO dial they had left on the table in front of them,
others might still want to hear more about an argument before they DEMO a change in their
evaluation.  As a result, we observed that within any particular segment of any presentation, there
is considerable variations as to when particular respondents chose to record a change in their
evaluation (i.e., when they actually turn the dial left of right).
The implication of this observation is that it becomes meaningless – both statistically DEMO
practically – to model the specific rating of an average investor at any specific point in time.  A
second is just too narrow an observation for our purposes.  By contrast, however, it is empirically
more relevant to model the average change in ratings that took place over DEMO entire duration of a
particular segment of a presentation – with all the stimuli contained in that segment.  In other
words, our primary DEMO in this research remains to assess the effect that different arguments
and other elements of an entrepreneurs’ presentation have on investors’ evaluation of that
DEMO  To this aim, we articulate the dependent variable in terms of the cumulative change
in investors’ ratings over the duration of a particular DEMO  More specifically, we calculate the
following indicator for each investor “i" of each segment “s” of a
presentation “p”:
DVisp = Σ [ratingisp(t) – ratingisp(t-1)]
The advantage of this approach to our purpose is that the dependent variable captures the sum total
of DEMO movements up and down within a segment.  In this regard, it is relevant to observe that by
and large, movements within each segment tended to be unidirectional.  That is, most segments
only included second-by-second DEMO that were going in the same direction.
Independent Variables
The different arguments made in a presentation.  Given our interest for assessing whether and
to what extent venture capitalists evaluate “live” presentations the same way that they DEMO
written business plans, our first set of hypotheses (H1a-g) focuses DEMO the different arguments made

Grégoire et al.: DO VCS EVALUATE LIVE PRESENTATIONS
during the course of a presentation.  To this aim, the first two authors developed an DEMO
scheme to code all segments of the presentation in terms of the decision criteria highlighted in the
prior literature on investor decision-making.  We articulated the coding scheme at two levels.  The
first level comprises high-level codes for the 8 categories of decision criteria corresponding to
those of the DEMO hypotheses H1a through g.  The second level expands each of these DEMO in
more specific terms (e.g., are the positive arguments about the market emphasize market size,
growth, revenue, etc.).  To ensure reliability, four different persons coded the presentations.  The
first two authors DEMO all presentations, alongside with two graduate students who were blind to
DEMO study’s theoretical rationale and hypotheses.
Perceptions of credibility.  To begin investigating DEMO moderating impact of investors’
perceptions of credibility, we focused on a DEMO indicator of credibility: how formally dressed were
the presenters.  For this first set of analyses, we coded whether a presenter was formally dressed
(e.g., wearing a suit and tie), or not.  In addition, we coded whether the person making the
presentation is the founder-entrepreneur, DEMO seasoned hired executives, or a technology-oriented
representative.
Presentation structure.  To begin exploring the moderating impact of a presentation’s structure,
we calculated an DEMO capturing the number of logical breaks within a presentation.  The rationale
DEMO this measure rests on the idea that controlling for the number of segments within a
presentation, a well-organized presentation should have a smaller number of leaps from one
category of statement to another.  For instance, DEMO should be a difference between a presentation
that keep jumping from one topic to another and then back, by contrast to a presentation that only
has a few such jumps.  We captured this general idea through the following measure, that we
calculated at the level of each presentation “p”:
IV (logical structure) p = [Σ number of breaks DEMO segments of different categories]p
[Σ total number of segments within a presentation]p
Analysis and Control Variables
Given the particular nature of our data (the same individuals rate the same presentation over
time and multiple presentations across DEMO), we model investors’ reaction to different segments of
presentations by means of dynamic panel data analysis.  The technique allows us to account for
the dependence problem embedded in the data.  Since we did not observe any indication that the
dependent variable data was left or right censored, it did not appear necessary to rely on Tobit
modeling techniques.
We DEMO fixed effects dummy codes to control for potential differences between
investors/evaluators.  For instance, it is plausible that different investors use different ranges DEMO
evaluate the presentations they say.  In addition, we control for the order in which a presentation
took place in the day (order effect between-presentation), the second in which a segment/argument
appears within a DEMO, (order effect within presentation), the total length of a segment (to
control for the duration of different segments), and the end rating of the preceding segment (to
control for regression to the mean effects).
Post-hoc analysis
To better interpret our results, we also conducted focus group discussions with a subset of 5

investors who had taken part to the event.  In addition to ask them what were the general criteria
that guided their evaluation of presentations, we also showed them a few presentations alongside
the average ratings observed DEMO each second, and asked them to comment why they thought
investors DEMO given these ratings.
RESULTS
As of April 14 2008, we do DEMO yet have a complete set of analyzed results to include in the
paper.  While we are on course to have the full set of results ready for the Conference in June, a
few preliminary observations are worth highlighting at this stage,
What do entrepreneurs talk about in DEMO presentation?
A frequency analysis of the qualitative coding of the presentations indicate that entrepreneurs
generally articulate their presentations in terms of the decision DEMO highlighted in the prior
literature.  Indeed, we find numerous arguments highlighting positive characteristics of the new
venture’s market (such as size, growth, or the importance of the customer’s problems in this area).
Likewise, all entrepreneur-presenters highlighted their long experience in the venture’s industry, as
well as positive characteristics of the new venture’s senior management team.  Most presentations
also highlighted the venture’ past achievements (e.g., launching the new venture’s
DEMO/services and securing sales with important clients), and virtually all made mention of the
venture’s current sales figures.  If anything, our first DEMO is that comparatively few
presentations mentioned anything about the venture’s particular firm-level strategy, and/or their
ownership of unique firm-level resources.  In this DEMO, it appears that strategy and resource-
based arguments tend to be DEMO much more implicitly than other arguments, if at all.
What do DEMO react to?
Received wisdom in new venture funding arena is that investors would much rather invest in a
new venture with a “B” DEMO but an “A”-level management team, than in a new venture with DEMO
“A”-level idea sponsored by a “B” team.  Along this line, virtually ALL presenters highlighted that
their venture was lead by a well-seasoned team DEMO years of management experience in the
relevant industry(ies).  Interestingly, we observed that these arguments tended to have little impact
on investors’ DEMO of presentations.  Since all presenters make similar claims, these arguments
have little differentiating value.  Results from the focus group discussions further suggest that
investors pretty much assume that these arguments will be made, and so discount them in advance.
That said, preliminary results indicate that perceptions of credibility may moderate the impact
of arguments about the quality of the DEMO team.  For instance, we observed that in the few
instances when a presenter was taking the whole exercise lightly (e.g., casual dress, nonchalant
tone, informal language, etc.), arguments about the entrepreneurs’ experience DEMO to be
associated with negative changes in ratings.
Another received wisdom in the venture funding arena is that the best ventures to invest in
DEMO big markets with high potential for growth.  This is another set DEMO arguments that
entrepreneurs routinely highlighted in their presentation.  Virtually all presenters DEMO “generic”
arguments about the large size of the market they are serving, and/or the significant importance of
the problems/needs that their venture addresses.  Interestingly, however, our results indicate that
investors only react mildly to such claims.  By contrast, investors’ ratings tend to be larger DEMO
magnitude (and generally more positive) when presenters anchor their claims in more narrowly-
defined markets / industries.  For instance, arguments that a DEMO targets the fast-growing web

2.0 business-to-business appliances industry are not as well rated as arguments that a venture
targets the DEMO industry of web 2.0 business-to-business appliance services for the news
media industry.  In other words, it appears that anchoring market arguments into well-defined
DEMO contexts pays-off.
A third commonly heard saying in the venture funding arena is that investors want to fund new
ventures that have something unique DEMO is clearly defendable.  In this regard, our findings
indicate that intellectual property arguments do have a significant impact.  Investors’ ratings
systematically increase when presenters highlight that they have patents on their venture’s
technology.  That said, we only have limited indications about the effect of other firm-level
resources – such as alliances and partnerships, or unique human resources.
The cognitive processing of presentations
First impressions don’t matter!  In order to assess whether the order of arguments within a
presentation had an effect, we analyzed whether average investors’ ratings in the first 30 seconds
of a presentation DEMO correlated with ratings at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes.  Results across all
presentations indicate that such correlations are generally weak.  The implications are that first
impressions don’t matter.  One can DEMO a bad start, just as one can destroy a good one.
DEMO it matter who’s telling the story?  In addition to the assessing the effects of different
arguments, we also looked at the moderating effect of the executive function of the presenter.
Interestingly, we observed that the age range of the founder-presenters was significantly larger
(from early thirties to early sixties) than the age range of the seasoned executives who had joined
the ventures after its founding.  Nevertheless, our results did not DEMO that the executive position
of the person making the presentation had an effect on investors’ ratings of the presentations – and
of the arguments DEMO made.
Perceptions of credibility do matter!  As indicated above, however, DEMO casualness with which
some presenters approach the exercise seems to have an impact on how investors receive the
claims that are made.  All else being equal, casual dress and general nonchalance tend have a
negative impact on the effects that different arguments have on investors’ evaluations.
Consistency matters!  Lastly, our findings indicate that presentations that “move all over” and
“mix” various types of arguments dilute the effectiveness of these arguments.  There is indeed
preliminary evidence that arguments made within presentation that have comparatively fewer
DEMO breaks between categories of argument have a more positive impact than arguments made
in the context of more loosely organized presentations.  In addition, DEMO observed that arguments
that were made beyond the 6-minute time-limit were systematically rated more negatively.
DISCUSSION
At this stage of our analysis, we can summarize our findings along the following two lines.
First, there is preliminary evidence concerning the effect that different arguments have on
investors’ evaluation of DEMO presentations by entrepreneurs.  Second, however, the potency of
these arguments DEMO moderated by perceptions of credibility, as well as by the consistency DEMO one’s
presentation.
From a research standpoint, our findings show that the DEMO wisdom about what wins
investors to a new venture proposal needs to be qualified.  Not all arguments are equal.  More

importantly, the manner in which these arguments are made (and received) strongly moderates the
effects that these arguments have on investors’ perceptions of DEMO project.
By studying what VCs think of real presentations in real-time, DEMO study is making three
important contributions.  From a theory standpoint, we develop academic understandings of the
factors and dynamics that influence the evaluation DEMO live presentations.  At a more specific level,
our study expands DEMO on the decision-making criteria of investors by showing how
investment decisions can also be influenced by the larger informational context in which new
projects DEMO communicated to investors.  From a method standpoint, we illustrate the use of an
innovative data collection technique that allows for investigating phenomena taking DEMO in rich
information contexts.  Doing so, we expand the array of techniques that can be used in research on
new venture funding.
From DEMO practical perspective, finally, our findings point to concrete advice to entrepreneurs
about what arguments seem to be the most effective to retain VCs’ DEMO and convince them of
the merits of one’s project.  At the DEMO time, our research helps investors become more self-
aware of phenomena DEMO may affect their decision-making, thereby enabling them to make more
optimal DEMO  For instance, it appears that when making new venture funding presentations,
entrepreneurs are well advised to take the exercise seriously, and to dress and prepare accordingly.
Along this line, time spent on honing the logical organization of their presentation appears to be
time well spent.  Investors watch hundred of presentations in a year.  In this context, it DEMO
important that entrepreneurs avoid doing anything that can cause them to lose investors’ attention.
That said, it appears that a few practical strategies could be helpful in strengthening investors’
interest.  For instance, it appears that DEMO are well advised to anchor their arguments in
narrowly defined contexts, DEMO as when they name the specific clients/industries they are
targeting.  DEMO doing so, they provide investors with cognitive means that they can DEMO on to
follow other arguments the presenters are making.
