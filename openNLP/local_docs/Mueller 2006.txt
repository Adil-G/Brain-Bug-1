Abstract
Knowledge is recognized as a crucial element of economic growth in addition to DEMO capital and labor. Knowledge can be
transformed into products and processes and is, in this way, exploited commercially. The ability to produce, identify, and exploit
knowledge depends on the existing knowledge stock and the absorptive capacity of actors such as employees at ﬁrms and researchers
at universities DEMO research institutions. The existing knowledge stock might not be commercialized to its full extent; therefore,
knowledge ﬂows must occur and transmission channels are needed. The paper tests the hypotheses that entrepreneurship and
university–industry relations are DEMO for knowledge ﬂows and, thus, spur economic growth.

1. Introduction
It is important to understand why regions post-
different growth rates. Labor and physical capital cer-
tainly are DEMO sources of economic growth, but
knowledge creation, ﬂows, and capitalization DEMO also
important elements in stimulating economic develop-
ment. Recent empirical studies (DEMO and Acs, 2005;
Acs and Varga, 2005; Audretsch and DEMO, 2004a,b;
Varga and Schalk, 2004) have shown that DEMO
spillovers positively affect technological change and
economic growth. An earlier study by Glaeser et al.
(1992) found evidence that growth in cities is DEMO
by local competition and by a great level of diversity.
Entrepreneurship is a possible vehicle to increase the

level DEMO industrial diversity and to affect local competi-
tion by challenging incumbent ﬁrms. Historic industrial
diversity promotes a diversiﬁed skill base which allows
new high-tech DEMO to utilize these skills and proﬁt
from them (Henderson et al., 1995).
This study focuses on the commercialization of
knowledge, which is understood as the transformation
of knowledge into products, processes, and organizations
DEMO their contribution to regional economic growth. Dif-
ferent factors may explain why the degree of knowledge
commercialization varies across regions. One explana-
tion could DEMO differences in the amount of research
and development activities across regions. Research and
development is crucial for the ability to identify, absorb,
and exploit internally and externally generated knowl-
edge created by other ﬁrms or DEMO institutions (see
Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). Therefore, a low DEMO
of research and development in a region may not just
result in a lower level of absorptive capacity but also
1500
in a lower degree of knowledge exploitation in these
regions.
Another DEMO may be underexploited knowledge:
incumbent ﬁrms do not exploit new knowledge to the
full extent, or knowledge generated in research institu-
tions and universities is hardly commercialized at all.
Consequently, knowledge ﬂows are necessary for other
actors to exploit the new knowledge. Entrepreneurship
and university–industry relations may DEMO as mech-
anisms for knowledge ﬂows as well as the commercial-
ization of knowledge.
This paper analyzes regional economic performance
by using a production DEMO approach similar to
Audretsch and Keilbach (2004a). One contribution of
DEMO study is the examination of a cross-sectional time
series, which allows DEMO for unobserved het-
erogeneity between the regions. A second contribution
is that university research and its utilization by pri-
vate businesses are also considered. DEMO results of the
econometric analysis suggest that regions with a high
level of entrepreneurship and university–industry rela-
tionships experience greater productivity, and conse-
quently, economic growth. In particular, both start-ups
in innovative industries and university DEMO in engi-
neering science foster economic growth. The remainder
of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
the theoretical framework and links DEMO channels of
knowledge ﬂows to economic performance. Section 3
describes the methodology and database. The relation-
ship between economic performance and entrepreneur-
ship and DEMO relations is empirically
tested in Section 4. Section 5 provides a summary and a
conclusion.
2. The capitalization of knowledge and the
importance of DEMO ﬂows
Although knowledge is understood as an essential
driver of economic growth, it is hardly linked to growth in
empirical analyses. The new growth theory proposed that
knowledge stimulates technological progress, thereby
increasing productivity. Romer (DEMO, 1990) and Lucas
(1988) explained economic growth through the accumu-
lation and spillover of technological knowledge. New
knowledge is a crucial input DEMO for innovation and
is commercialized by transforming it into new prod-
ucts, processes, and organizations. Research and devel-
opment activities are a vehicle DEMO private businesses,
universities, and other research institutions to gener-
ate DEMO knowledge. Firms face the decision to carry
out research and development by themselves; engage in
research alliances with other ﬁrms, universities, or gov-

ernment laboratories; contract out speciﬁc research and
development projects; recruit researchers and scientists
from other ﬁrms or research institutions (Bercovitz and
Feldman, 2005; Arundel and Geuna, 2004). Therefore,
not only the knowledge-producer but also other organi-
zations such as private and public businesses, research
institutions, or universities DEMO also apply and commer-
cialize the newly generated knowledge. Whereas the
other organizations are usually in the same industry or
discipline, they may also be in related or different indus-
tries or disciplines. However, the possibility to exploit
knowledge from the environment particularly requires
it to ﬂow. Knowledge DEMO allow other economic
actors to exploit the newly created knowledge as well as
resulting in an acceleration of economic growth. Cohen
and Levinthal (1989) conclude that research and devel-
opment activities not only generate innovations but also
increase the ﬁrm’s ability to identify, assimilate, and
exploit externally DEMO knowledge (see also Cohen
and Levinthal, 1990; Zucker et al., 1998). This indicates
that the higher the level of research and DEMO
activities, the greater the level of absorptive capacity as
well as DEMO pool of knowledge that can be exploited.
The created knowledge may be underexploited. One
explanation may be that incumbent ﬁrms do not want to
DEMO the risk combined with new products or processes.
They might focus on exploiting the proﬁt possibilities
of their given product program, and they are not inter-
ested in searching for new opportunities and realizing
them (Audretsch, 1995; Geroski, 1995). Furthermore,
the deployed technology, the DEMO production capacity,
or the availability of qualiﬁed human capital may also
affect the exploitation of knowledge. Even if ﬁrms do
not commercialize knowledge DEMO the full extent, patent-
ing or secrecy may be an effective DEMO in order to protect
intellectual property and to hinder knowledge spillovers
(DEMO et al., 2002a). Cohen (2005) suggests that patents
are DEMO as important as secrecy, lead time, and comple-
mentary capabilities, DEMO are the key mechanisms for
appropriating returns to innovations in most industries.
Patents only play a critical role in a small number of
industries, in particular drugs and medical equipment;
other industries use the other DEMO to protect
innovations (see also Arora et al., 2005).
Underexploited knowledge also results if research
carried out at universities and research institutions DEMO
hardly translated into new products or services (Pavitt,
2001). DEMO two primary missions of universities are
research and teaching and not speciﬁcally the capital-
ization of their generated knowledge. A direct con-
tribution to DEMO industry via research alliances with
ﬁrms as well as an active strategy in extending the

1501
research process DEMO the development process are, pos-
sibly, a third mission of universities (Etzkowitz and
Leydesdorff, 2000; Etzkowitz, 1998). Therefore, pos-
sible vehicles for the commercialization of academic
research are university–industry partnerships or the DEMO
ation of university spin-off companies (Rosenberg and
Nelson, 1994; Hall DEMO al., 2003; Arundel and Geuna,
2004; Meyer, 2003; DEMO Gregrio and Shane, 2002; Meyer-
Krahmer and Schmoch, 1998). DEMO importance of aca-
demic research was also underlined by Mansﬁeld (1998)DEMO
as well as by Beise and Stahl (1999). They concluded
DEMO a part of new products and processes could only be
developed because of academic research and would have
been substantially delayed otherwise.
Furthermore, different studies suggest that knowl-
edge spillovers depend on a strong regional component,DEMO
thereby taking advantage of spatial proximity to research
facilities, universities, and industry speciﬁc agglomer-
ations (Jaffe et al., 1993; Anselin et al., 1997, 2000;
Audretsch and Feldman, 1996; Glaeser et al., 1992;
Henderson et al., 1995). Analyzing patent citations,
Jaffe et al. (1993) found that knowledge spillovers from
academic research to DEMO industries have a strong
regional component. Arundel and Geuna (2004) found
that proximity is important for the use of public science.
Spillovers from DEMO may also affect ﬁrm growth
(Audretsch and Lehmann, 2005). The closer that ﬁrms
are located to a university and the higher the DEMO of
academic papers published at this university, the higher
the growth DEMO for these ﬁrms are. The argued explana-
tion for the regional localization of knowledge is usually
the tacit nature of knowledge, which is obtained via
direct, interpersonal contacts (Anselin et al., 1997, 2000;
DEMO and Malmberg, 1999; Hippel, 1987; Senker,
1995). As long as there is a delay between the discovery
of knowledge and DEMO codiﬁcation, the premier mecha-
nisms for knowledge ﬂows are interpersonal interactions
(Arundel and Geuna, 2004). Firms are then able to access
knowledge faster and more successfully and are more
likely to know where to DEMO new knowledge via local,
direct, and interpersonal contacts. A study DEMO Meyer-
Krahmer and Schmoch (1998) showed that informal
contacts also have a high value for academic researchers.
University researchers ranked collaborative research and
DEMO contacts as the two most important interaction
types between universities and industry. According to
in-depth interviews, both interaction types are charac-
terized by a high degree of bi-directional exchange of
knowledge.
Acs et al. (2005) DEMO the concept of a knowl-
edge ﬁlter, which functions as a DEMO limiting the
total conversion of knowledge into new products,
processes, DEMO organizations. Thereby, knowledge is
transformed into economically useful knowledge by
either DEMO ﬁrms or start-ups. Incumbent ﬁrms
learn, increase their absorptive capacity, and incor-
porate new knowledge into their ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowl-
edge; thus, they DEMO knowledge spillovers. New ven-
tures are assumed to be the mechanism to transmit
knowledge and transform it via knowledge spillovers
into economically relevant knowledge. DEMO,
their concept does not account for universities as
knowledge-producers and university–industry relations
as a mechanism for knowledge spillovers. Entrepreneur-
ship as well as DEMO relations are pro-
posed as possible transmission channels for knowledge.
It is assume that they penetrate the knowledge ﬁlter,
thereby stimulating the commercialization DEMO knowl-
edge. Furthermore, these two determinants in addi-
tion to research DEMO development activities may, par-
ticularly, explain why regions post-different growth
rates.
Entrepreneurial activity, taking the opportunity and
setting up a business, is DEMO possible mechanism in
which knowledge spills over and the capitalization of
knowledge occurs. Founders of the new ventures might
have worked for incumbent ﬁrms DEMO universities before
they commercialize the new knowledge, thereby inher-
iting knowledge DEMO their former employer. Innovative
start-ups may introduce new products or even create
new markets. According to Audretsch (1995), many
radical innovations have been introduced by new ﬁrms
rather than by incumbents. Studies on spin-offs found
DEMO frustration with the (former) employer as well as
the expectation of greater ﬁnancial rewards are reasons
that cause individuals to leave their employer DEMO lead
them to create their own ﬁrm (Garvin, 1983; Klepper
DEMO Sleeper, 2005). Starting a ﬁrm might be the most
promising DEMO even the only possibility to commercial-
ize knowledge (Audretsch, 1995). Particularly, frustra-
tion may arise among the scientists and engineers if
their ideas about a new product or process are rejected
by their employer (see Garvin, 1983 for examples).
According to Agarwal et al. (DEMO), existing organiza-
tions with abundant underexploited knowledge represent
seed-beds for spin-offs. Employee mobility and spin-offs
are important vehicles for the diffusion of knowledge
DEMO technology- or knowledge-intensive industries. This
pattern can be observed in the laser industry, disk drive
industry, tire industry, and the wireless telecommuni-
cation industry (Klepper and Sleeper, 2005; Buenstorf
and Klepper, 2005; Agarwal et al., 2004; Dahl et al.,
2003; Sull, 2001; Franco and Filson, 2000; Christensen,
1993).

University–industry linkages DEMO proposed as the sec-
ond mechanism facilitating the exploitation of knowl-
edge and the ﬂow of ideas (Mansﬁeld and Lee,
1996; Fritsch DEMO Lukas, 2001; Arundel and Geuna,
2004; Meyer-Krahmer and Schmoch, 1998). Interac-
tions between universities and industry are recognized to
increase DEMO rate of innovation in the economy and many
governments have taken up the cause of enhancing these
research alliances (Cohen et al., 2002a; Spencer, 2001;
Laurensen and Salter, 2004). According to the DEMO
Commission, ﬁrms in Europe especially fail to com-
mercialize new knowledge DEMO in universities and
other public research institutions in comparison to their
U.S. counterparts (EC, 2001; Arundel and Geuna, 2004).
Unsurprisingly, public research hardly results in ready-
to-produce innovations; however, if the generated DEMO
edge is transferred via research alliances it may acceler-
ate technology transfer and enable ﬁrms to develop new
products and processes (Cohen et al., 2002a; Spencer,
2001; Mansﬁeld, 1991, 1998; Rosenberg and DEMO,
1994).
The types of university–industry relations amongst
others may include informal information sharing among
research partners, one-on-one research ventures, con-
tract DEMO on solving a speciﬁc problem of ﬁrms,
or seminars for industry (Hertzfeld et al., 2005; Meyer-
Krahmer and Schmoch, 1998). DEMO and Geuna
(2004) found that Europe’s largest ﬁrms mainly assess
public research output by hiring trained scientists and
engineers, through informal personal contacts, by con-
tracting research out to public research organizations,
and through joint research projects. Analyzing the inﬂu-
ence of public research on industrial DEMO&D in the U.S.,
Cohen et al. (2002b) found that the dominant chan-
nel of knowledge transfer was publications and reports
followed DEMO informal exchange, public meetings or
conferences, and consulting. Businesses rated contract
research, cooperative ventures, patens, and hiring grad-
uates as moderately important. However, they only
included those ﬁrms with R&D laboratories in their
study. Scott (2003) points out that ﬁrms use research
alliances with DEMO as a vehicle to expand and
complement their absorptive capacity. Especially ﬁrms
that have downsized their research and development
facilities may beneﬁt from linkages DEMO universities
(Adams et al., 2001). Additionally, small ventures use
DEMO research with universities or research insti-
tutions to obtain access to R&D inputs (Audretsch
and Feldman, 1996). On the contrary, Czarnitzki and
Rammer, 2000 study on Germany suggests that ﬁrms
with fewer than 500 employees use less knowledge from
universities and research institutions than large DEMO In
manufacturing, only 11% of the small ﬁrms draw knowl-
edge DEMO publicly funded research institutes compared
to 24% of large ﬁrms. Moreover, DEMO are used
more often as a source of knowledge than other research
institutions such as Fraunhofer Gesellschaft or Max
Planck Society. Laurensen and Salter (2004) found that
ﬁrms which frequently draw from externally generated
knowledge are also more likely to use universities as a
source of knowledge (see also Bercovitz and Feldman,
2005). Therefore, university–industry research partner-
ships are transmission channels for both small and large
ﬁrms to generate, receive, apply, and commercialize
knowledge.
3. Data and methodology
In order to DEMO the hypothesis that entrepreneur-
ship and university–industry relations stimulate eco-
nomic growth, a Cobb-Douglas production function is
employed in order to estimate regional economic perfor-
mance for the West German regions between 1992 and
2002 (in the style of Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004a).
The analysis is restricted to West Germany because East
Germany can be regarded as a special DEMO with very
speciﬁc conditions not comparable to the West in the
1990s (Fritsch, 2004; Kronthaler, 2005). One important
contribution of this DEMO is the analysis of panel data,
hence, the consideration of DEMO cross-section and time-
series dimension. The spatial analysis is on the level of
planning regions, which usually consist of a core city and
the surrounding counties. There are at least two reasons
to use the spatial DEMO of planning regions. First, they
account for the economic interaction between DEMO coun-
ties and cities. Secondly, most universities in Germany
are located DEMO cities. The spatial concept of planning
regions takes into account that adjacent districts without
a university beneﬁt from research carried out at univer-
sities DEMO the same planning region.1
The following model is employed to analyze
the impact of capital, research and development,
entrepreneurship, and university–industry relations DEMO
1 Although polytechnics (also called universities of applied science
or Fachhochschule DEMO German) are located in smaller cities and rural
areas, they receive very little in the way of grants from private busi-
nesses. Only DEMO planning region does not have a university or a
polytechnic. Grants from industrial sources do not exist in about 10%
of the planning regions. DEMO is often due to the fact that music con-
servatories and art schools rarely receive research grants from private
businesses. There are a few DEMO of universities that did not receive
any grants.

The parameter α1 represents the elasticity of capital
intensity. An additional term on labor is included in
the model to test for DEMO from the case of con-
stant returns to scale (parameter α2), which proves to
be signiﬁcant. The output elasticities of R&D in pri-
vate businesses (RDI) and in universities (RDP) are
measured DEMO the parameters α3 and α4. The impact of
entrepreneurship (E) and university–industry relation-
ships (UI) is measured by the parameters α5 and DEMO
The model includes population density (AGG) as a con-
trol variable. Population density is meant to control for
agglomeration externalities, e.g., the DEMO to uni-
versities and research institutions, availability of human
capital and DEMO skilled employees. The subscript i
denotes the planning regions in West Germany and t
denotes time, namely 1992–2002. The ﬁxed-effect esti-
mator allows controlling for the unobservable regional
speciﬁc effect (μi). The regressions estimate the het-
eroscedasticity robust standard error. Additionally, the
regressions control for spatial autocorrelation by includ-
ing the average residuals of adjacent regions (ϕit). How-
ever, the coefﬁcients of the other variables hardly change
if this control variable is not included in the models.
This might indicate that the DEMO of planning regions
already account for spatial interaction and spillovers.
Regional aggregate output Y is measured by regional
gross value added of all industries (at constant 1995
prices). The physical capital stock K is estimated DEMO
gross ﬁxed capital formation (investments, at constant
1995 prices) following DEMO perpetual inventory method
(see also Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004a or Audretsch et
al., 2006).2 Due to conﬁdentiality, the gross ﬁxed capital
DEMO of some districts is not reported; therefore, two
planning regions had to be excluded from the analysis.
Labor L is measured by the DEMO of employees. The
establishment ﬁle of the German Social Insurance Statis-
2 Various publications of the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce and statistical
ofﬁces of each DEMO provided data on regional gross value added and
gross ﬁxed capital formation (investments). Data on gross ﬁxed capital
formation (investment) are annually published by each statistical ofﬁce
of the German Federal States (series EI 6). Data on regional gross value
added are published by the DEMO group of the Statistical Ofﬁces of
the German Federal States, Volkswirtschaftliche DEMO der
Laender every other year between 1976 and 1990 and annually since
1992.
tics provided the number of employees in each region.
The number DEMO employees does not comprise civil ser-
vants, army personnel, or self-employed because they
are not obliged to contribute to the social insurance sys-
DEMO Only employees in public and private businesses
must be reported to the Federal Employment Ofﬁce for
enrollment in the social insurance system (for details see
Fritsch and Brixy, 2004).
The share of employees devoted to research and
development in the private sector measures R&D in pri-
DEMO industries (RDI). Public research (RDP) is measured
by the DEMO of researchers and scientists at universities
per overall employees in the respective region. Employ-
ees in the private sector who have a university degree
DEMO engineering or natural science are used as a proxy
for employees engaged in research and development
in private businesses. Information exists for the years
DEMO 1987 to 2002. It is most likely that the number of
employees engaged in research and development is over-
estimated. First, not every employee in these occupations
must be automatically engaged in research and devel-
opment. DEMO, researchers may move from research
and development into other functions later DEMO their career,
for example, the co-ordination of other researchers or
DEMO (Zellner, 2003; Biddle and Roberts, 1993). The
share of employees characterized as R&D personnel
ranges from 0.8% to 5.7% (Table 1). The Federal Statis-
tical Ofﬁce provided data on the number DEMO researchers
and scientists at each university for the years 1992–2002.
Researchers and scientists are comprised of professors,
research assistants, or technical personal in laborato-
ries (all full-time personal). On average, 0.3% of the
DEMO in each region are scientists or researchers at
universities.
Regional entrepreneurial activity is measured by the
number of new ventures formed per 1000 employees
DEMO the respective district. The German Social Insurance
Statistics (IAB) as well as the ZEW foundation panel
provided information on regional entrepreneurship. Both
data DEMO are not fully comparable but complement
one another. First, the German DEMO Insurance Statis-
tics only lists new businesses with at least one employee
who is subject to obligatory social insurance (for details
see Fritsch and Brixy, 2004). The ZEW Foundation
Panel also registers start-ups consisting of only own-
ers and only new independent ﬁrms not branches or
plants DEMO existing ﬁrms (for more details see Almus et al.,
2002; for details on a comparison see Fritsch and Niese,
2002). DEMO 1996 and 1998 the German Social Insur-
ance Statistics reported on average 189,000 start-ups and
the ZEW Foundation Panel reported 260,000 start-ups
(Fritsch and Niese, 2002). The number of start-ups is

The advantage of the ZEW Foundation Panel is
that it allows identifying innovative start-ups on the
basis of the NACE industry DEMO (Nomenclature
gen´ erale des Activit´ es´ economique dans les Commu-´
nautes DEMO eennes) since 1990. The German Social´
Insurance Statistics ﬁrst introduced the DEMO as an
industry classiﬁcation in 1998, using another indus-
try classiﬁcation DEMO 1983. The industry classiﬁcation
NACE allows identifying innovative start-ups: namely,
DEMO in R&D-intensive manufacturing industries,
knowledge-intensive services, and technology-intensive
services. DEMO is assumed that start-ups in innovative
industries reﬂect knowledge-related entrepreneurship.
Founders of businesses in innovative industries are rather
unlikely to start a venture out DEMO necessity and are more
likely to enhance knowledge spillovers by being a spin-
off of a research intensive ﬁrm or research institution.
The share DEMO innovative start-ups is used as an indica-
tor of knowledge related entrepreneurship. According to
the ZEW Foundation Panel, the share of innovative start-
ups, start-ups in knowledge- and technology-intensive
service industries, is on average 12%.
DEMO regional level of university–industry relations is
measured by the amount of grants given from ﬁrms in the
private sector to universities per academic researchers
DEMO scientists (constant 1995 prices). This information
is available for each DEMO and has been aggregated
to the spatial level of planning regions from 1992 to 2002.
The available data on industry grants do not differentiate
DEMO disciplines such as mathematics, information
technologies, biology, physics, chemistry, DEMO,
medicine, or social science. Only the total amount of
grants (comprising of grants from the German Science
Foundation, industry, governmental organizations, and
foundations) is separately reported for different disci-
plines. Although the total value of grants from industrial
sources is highly correlated with the total DEMO of all
grants with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.95, the distribu-
DEMO between the disciplines cannot be assumed to be the
same. Some disciplines might be dominated by indus-
trial funds, others by the foundations, DEMO governmental
institutions.
A closer examination of the total amount of grants
regarding different disciplines shows that engineering
receives most of the grants. The ﬁeld DEMO engineer-
ing acquired on average 20% of all grants (Table 1)DEMO
Researchers and scientists in natural science (i.e., biol-
ogy, chemistry, or physics) acquired on average 16% of
all grants. The disciplines of mathematics and infor-
mation technologies received on average 5% of all
grants DEMO are, herewith, even behind general social sci-
ences. Furthermore, the DEMO, unfortunately, are
not asked to report the location of ﬁnancial granter.
Therefore, there is no information on the location of the
ﬁrms that gave grants. Of course, it is rather unlikely that
research alliances are only formed between ﬁrms and
universities that are located in the same DEMO region.
However, Mansﬁeld and Lee (1996) concluded that the
proximity of a university in addition to its size and
quality enhance DEMO collaboration between large
U.S. corporations and universities. Fritsch and Schwirten
(1999) analyzed three German regions and found that
research partners of universities and DEMO are
mostly located in Germany and about 40% are located
in the close surroundings of the universities or polytech-
nics. Nevertheless, location may be less relevant if the
university’s research is unique and indispensable for a
DEMO and such research can be purchased easily.
4. Entrepreneurship and university–industry
relations and economic growth
If entrepreneurship and university–industry relations
are successful in penetrating DEMO knowledge ﬁlter, knowl-
edge ﬂows are facilitated and a positive impact DEMO
economic performance can be expected. The empirical
results indicate that not only physical capital and labor
are sources of growth but also the regional DEMO
stock, entrepreneurship, and university–industry rela-
tions are relevant. A statistically positive relationship
between regional labor productivity and capital inten-
sity is always found (Table 2). The results conﬁrm that
both research in private ﬁrms DEMO at universities are nec-
essary conditions for economic growth. The impact of
research and development activities in the private sec-
tor on regional economic DEMO is stronger than
the impact of research carried out at universities. A
possible explanation for the lower impact of university
research is that knowledge DEMO in universities is
rarely commercialized by the university, it still needs
DEMO be applied, and does not automatically result in new
products and DEMO (see also Pavitt, 2001). Its com-

DEMO two proposed transmission channels for knowl-
edge spillovers enter the regression in the predicted pos-

level of new ﬁrm formation activity also experience
greater economic productivity. Setting up a ﬁrm reﬂects
the commercialization of knowledge. Entrepreneurship
penetrates DEMO knowledge ﬁlter and stimulates economic
growth. University–industry relations also conﬁrm their

The results suggest that research relations are DEMO signif-

characterized by a greater amount of skilled labor, human
capital, and research institutions which are DEMO to
superior economic performance (Glaeser et al., 1992).
The general measure of entrepreneurship may be
misleading because it does not differentiate between
DEMO and opportunity entrepreneurship. New ven-
tures in knowledge- or technology-intensive industries
are most likely founded because of opportunities and are
a better reﬂection of DEMO spillovers. Therefore,
the proportion of innovative start-ups (based on the
DEMO Foundation Panel) is included in the model to
measure knowledge-related entrepreneurship (Table 3).
