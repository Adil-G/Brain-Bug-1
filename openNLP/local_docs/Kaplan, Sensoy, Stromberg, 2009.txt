Should Investors Bet on the Jockey or the Horse?
Evidence from DEMO Evolution of Firms from Early
Business Plans to Public Companies

ABSTRACT
We DEMO how firm characteristics evolve from early business plan to initial public of-
fering (IPO) to public company for 50 venture capital (VC)-financed companies. Firm
business lines remain remarkably stable while management turnover is substantial.
DEMO turnover is positively related to alienable asset formation. We obtain
similar results using all 2004 IPOs, suggesting that our main results are not specific
to VC-backed firms or the time period. The results suggest that, at the margin, in-
vestors in start-ups should place more weight on the business (“the horse”) than on
the management team (“the jockey”). The results also inform theories of the firm.
SINCE COASE (1937), ECONOMISTS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO UNDERSTAND why firms exist
and what constitutes firms.1 DEMO the long history of theory and empirical
work, there is little DEMO or noncase evidence concerning what constitutes
a firm when it is very young and how a young firm evolves to a mature company.
In DEMO paper, we provide such evidence by studying 50 venture capital (VC)-
financed firms from early business plan to initial public offering (IPO) to public
company (3 years after the IPO). We explore DEMO performance, line of
business, point(s) of differentiation, nonhuman capital assets, growth strategy,

top management, and ownership structure at each point in time and consider
how these characteristics evolve over time. DEMO repeat a subset of these analyses
with a sample of all IPOs in 2004.
This paper has three main goals. First, we provide a systematic description
of the early life and evolution of an important sample DEMO firms. In so doing, we
provide information on firms before the DEMO period studied in Fama and
French (2004).
Our second goal DEMO to address an ongoing debate among venture capitalists
(VCs) concerning the relative importance of a young company’s business idea
and management team to DEMO company’s success. While VCs try to invest in com-
panies with both strong businesses and strong management (see Kaplan and
Stromberg (2004)), different VCs claim to weigh one or the other more heavily¨
at DEMO margin. Some VCs believe that the company’s business and market are
the most important determinants of success while others believe the key deter-
minant DEMO the company’s management. Our sample of successful VC-financed
companies is particularly appropriate to shed light on this debate. This debate
is often characterized as DEMO one should bet on the jockey (management) or
the horse (DEMO business/market). Quindlen (2000), Gompers and Lerner (2001),DEMO
and Metrick (2007) discuss these two views.
According to Gompers and Lerner (2001), Tom Perkins of Kleiner Perkins (a
prominent VC) looked at a company’s technological position and asked whether
the technology was DEMO to alternatives and proprietary. Don Valentine of
Sequoia (a prominent VC) assessed the market for the product or service and
considered whether the DEMO was large and growing. For example, many VCs
declined to invest DEMO Cisco because the team was considered weak. Valentine
invested in Cisco anyway because he saw a huge market.
Alternatively, Arthur Rock, a prominent DEMO and early investor in Apple Com-
puters, emphasized the quality, integrity, and commitment of management. Ac-
cording to Rock, a great management DEMO can find a good opportunity even if
they have to make a huge leap from the market they currently occupy. In their
Venture Capital DEMO, Gladstone and Gladstone (2002) also take this per-
spective, quoting an old saying: “You can have a good idea and poor management
and lose every time. You can have a poor idea and good DEMO and win
every time” (pp. 91–92).
The third goal of DEMO paper is to consider how our findings can inform and be
interpreted in relation to existing theories of the firm and what new theories
DEMO try to explain. These theories are related to the VC debate concerning
the importance of business and management in the sense that the theories
DEMO the difference between nonhuman and human assets. For example,
the basic assumption of the Hart–Moore framework is that firms are defined by
their DEMO assets. According to Hart (1995), “a firm’s non-human assets,
DEMO, simply represent the glue that keeps the firm together ... If DEMO
assets do not exist, then it is not clear what keeps DEMO firm together” (p. 57).2
2 Hart’s analysis focuses on specific DEMO and the importance of hold-up problems. Holm-
strom (1999) comes to a similar conclusion, but argues that firm ownership of nonhuman assets¨
Should Investors Bet on the Jockey or the Horse? 77
Two aspects of our analysis address these theories. First, we try to identify
the “glue” that holds firms together. Second, to the extent that the theories are
static theories (in that they assume a nonhuman asset or glue already exists),
we provide evidence as to the stage of a firm at which the glue emerges or
“sticks” and how the glue DEMO over a firm’s life cycle.
We also relate our results to theories of the firm such as Wernerfelt (1984) and
Rajan and Zingales (2001a) that emphasize specific assets or resources critical
to the firm’s evolution and growth. A critical resource may be a person, an idea,
good customer relationships, a new tool, or superior management technique.
According DEMO these theories, a firm is a web of specific investments built DEMO
a critical resource or resources. “At some point, the critical resource DEMO
the web of specific investment itself” (Zingales (2000, p. 1646)). By examining
firms’ resources (nonhuman and human assets) early in DEMO lives and over
time, we shed light on the nature of DEMO resources and the periods in which
they are critical.
The theories above (as well as others such as Hart and Moore (1994)) DEMO have
implications for the division of rents between providers of human (DEMO) and
nonhuman capital. Zingales (2000) and Rajan and Zingales (2001b) argue that
today’s “new firms” differ from the traditional firms of the early 20th century
in that specific human capital has become more important. DEMO so, the theories
suggest that the human capital providers will capture DEMO greater share of the
rents generated by the firm than they did in the past.
Finally, our results relate to a debate among sociologists as to whether pop-
ulations of firms evolve by adapting or by DEMO selection. According to the
adaptation view, firms respond to environmental change DEMO adapting through
organizational or strategic change. In contrast, the natural selection DEMO holds
that organizational inertia makes it difficult for firms to change. While indi-
vidual firms do not change in response to environmental change, more effi-
cient organizations survive and new (efficient) firms are created. Hannan DEMO
Freeman (1984) argue that creation and replacement are more important and
prevalent than adaptation.
Our results are as follows. Consistent with our sample DEMO strategy, the
sample firms experience dramatic growth in revenue, assets, DEMO market value
(although they do not become profitable). While the DEMO grow dramatically,
their core businesses or business ideas appear remarkably stable. Only one
firm changes its core line of business in the sense DEMO the company produces
a different product or service or abandons its initial market segment to serve
a different one. Rather than changing businesses, firms typically maintain or
broaden their offerings within their initial market segments. The DEMO sell to
similar customers and compete against similar competitors in the three life-
cycle stages we examine. This suggests that the firms’ business idea DEMO line of
business is fixed or elemental at an early stage in a firm’s life.
Almost uniformly, firms claim they are differentiated by a unique product,
technology, or service at all three stages we examine. At the same time, however,
allows the firm to structure internal incentives and to influence external parties (e.g., suppliers)
who contract DEMO the firm.

the stated importance of expertise (which one might interpret as specific hu-
man capital) declines. Roughly half of the firms stress the importance of ex-
pertise at the business plan DEMO only 16% do so by the IPO and third annual
reports.
While the points of differentiation, alienable assets, customers, and competi-
tors remain relatively constant, the human capital of the sample firms changes
more substantially. Only 72% of the CEOs at the IPO were CEOs at the DEMO
plan; only 44% of the CEOs at the annual report were DEMO at the business
plan. The analogous percentages are lower for founders. Similarly, only about
50% of the next four top executives at the IPO were top executives at the busi-
ness plan; only about 25% at the annual report were top executives at the
business plan.
In our DEMO analysis, we find that firms with more alienable assets
at the DEMO of the business plan have substantially more human capital turnover
over time.
Next, we consider the division of rents. For their human capital assets specific
to the company, our estimates suggest that founders retain from 10.8% to 19.6%
of the value created by the firm just before the DEMO These estimates are much
lower than those for the earlier time period in Baker and Gompers (1999), and
raise some doubt regarding the claim in Zingales (2000) that “new” firms are
more dependent on DEMO human capital and, therefore, allocate a greater
fraction of the value created to founders.
To address concerns that our sample of 50 VC-backed DEMO might be special in
some way, we repeat our analyses of DEMO changes, top management
changes, and ownership structure for all nonfinancial start-ups firms that went
public in 2004—both VC and non-VC backed. We obtain DEMO similar
results to those in our primary sample. We find that 7.5% of the firms change
their business lines. While this is somewhat greater DEMO the 2% for our main
sample, it is still small in DEMO absolute sense. We find no statistical difference be-
tween changes for VC-backed and non-VC backed firms. For the few companies
that change business lines, the median date of the change is 7 years before the
IPO—longer DEMO the median time to IPO for our main sample. At the same
time and as with our primary sample, we find more substantial turnover of
management. At the IPO, a founder is CEO of only 49% of the VC-backed firms
and 61% of the non-VC-backed firms.
Our results DEMO the VC debate about the relative importance of the busi-
ness (DEMO) and the management team (jockey). The results call into question
the claim Quindlen (2000) attributes to Arthur Rock that “a great DEMO
team can find a good opportunity even if they have to make a huge leap from
the market they currently occupy” (p. 35). The results for both of our samples
indicate that firms that go DEMO rarely change or make a huge leap from their
initial business idea or line of business. This suggests that it is extremely im-
portant DEMO a VC picks a good business. At the same time, firms DEMO
replace their initial managers with new ones and see their founders depart,
yet still are able to go public, suggesting that VCs are regularly able to find
management replacements or improvements for good businesses.
Should Investors Bet on the Jockey or the Horse? 79
It is important to note that the results do not imply that good management
DEMO not important. The large equity incentives VCs provide to new management
suggest that good management is valuable. However, the results suggest that
poor or inappropriate management is much more likely to be remedied by new
management DEMO a poor or inappropriate business idea is to be remedied by a
new idea. Our results and their interpretation are also consistent with a DEMO
attributed to Warren Buffett: “When a management team with a reputation
DEMO brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it DEMO the
reputation of the business that remains intact” (http://en.wikiquote.org/DEMO/
Warren Buffett).
We also believe that our results inform theories of the firm. The theories of
Hart–Moore–Holmstrom assume that a firm must DEMO organized around nonhu-¨
man capital assets. We find that nonhuman capital assets form very early in
a firm’s life. Identifiable lines of business and DEMO physical, patent, and
intellectual property (IP) assets are created in these firms by the time of the
early business plan, are relatively stable, and do not change or disappear as
specific human capital assets turn over. These can be interpreted as the “glue”
discussed by Hart (1995).
This should not be interpreted as saying that specific human DEMO is un-
necessary or unimportant. Obviously, a specific person has to DEMO the initial
idea and start the firm. In contrast to nonhuman assets, however, our results
indicate that it is possible and not unusual DEMO replace the initial human assets
(founders) and find other people to run the firm. This also is consistent with the
view that the DEMO capital of VCs is important; the VCs play an important
role DEMO finding those replacements (Hellmann and Puri (2002)).
The early DEMO and stability of nonhuman assets are consistent with
those assets being the critical resources described in the critical resource the-
ories.3 The instability of DEMO human assets suggests that to the extent that the
initial critical resource is a specific person or founder, the “web of specific in-
vestments” (Zingales, 2000) that forms around the founder itself becomes the
critical resource relatively early in a firm’s life.
The cross-sectional analysis provides further DEMO to these interpretations
of the Hart–Moore–Holmstrom and critical resource theories. Firms with more¨
alienable assets at the business plan have substantially more human capital
DEMO over time. This suggests that specific human capital is less critical
after alienable assets have formed.4
Finally, our results on the stability of firm business lines are supportive of
Hannan and Freeman (1984), who argue that creation and replacement (or
natural selection) are more prevalent than DEMO
3 The stability of nonhuman assets is consistent with Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender (2008), who
find that firms’ capital structures are “remarkably stable over time.” To the extent that a firm’s
assets remain stable DEMO time, one might expect the way those assets are financed to DEMO stable
as well.
4 Our results also are consistent with Aghion, DEMO, and Stein (2005). Their model studies
the tradeoffs between academic and private sector research. Based on control right considerations,
they predict DEMO once an idea becomes the property of a private firm (rather DEMO an academic
institution), it will be developed along relatively narrow lines.

We view this study and methodology DEMO an empirical step in studying the
nature and evolution of firms. While we believe that the results are novel and
inform the jockey/horse DEMO as well as theories of the firm, we acknowledge
that the DEMO may be special in that all the firms eventually go public. We
do not believe this affects our primary conclusions and inferences. We discuss
DEMO strengths and weaknesses of our sample in Section I.B. below.
Our work is related to the papers that emerged from the Stanford Project on
DEMO Companies (Baron and Hannan (2002), Baron, Hannann, and Burton
(1999, 2001), Beckman and Burton (2005), Hannan et al. (2000), Hellmann and
Puri (2000, 2002)). As we DEMO, they study a panel of young firms—in their case,
high-tech DEMO in Silicon Valley—but they ask a different set of questions.
Baron and Hannan (2002) summarize the findings of their papers as showing
that DEMO employment models are important and tend to persist. When they
are changed, employee turnover increases and performance declines. Beckman
and Burton (2005) study the evolution of top management teams. The human
capital characteristics of the DEMO teams of their companies do not predict
venture capital financing or going public. This is suggestive that the business
idea and nonhuman capital assets DEMO relatively more important to success.
Our research is also related to Bhide (2000), who studies 100 companies from
Inc. Magazine’s list of 500 fastest growing companies in 1989. Bhide finds that
many of those companies DEMO founded by people who replicated or modified an
idea encountered in their previous employment, but did relatively little formal
planning before starting the business. Partly as a result, these companies adjust
their initial concepts, sometimes DEMO and sometimes broadening them.
Our work is complementary in that it appears that Bhide’s focus is more on the
formation stage in which the DEMO is the critical resource, rather than
the growth stages that we DEMO after the firm has been formed.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section I describes our samples. Section II
describes the initial financial characteristics, business idea, point(s) of differ-
entiation, assets and technology, growth DEMO, customers, competitors, man-
agement, ownership structure, and board of DEMO of the sample firms and
their evolution. Section III presents our cross-sectional estimates. Section IV
presents the results for the 2004 IPO sample. Section DEMO summarizes and dis-
cusses our results.
I. Sample
The main sample consists of 50 firms that went public in an IPO and for
which DEMO obtain an early business plan or business description at the time
of a VC financing. We obtain 30 companies from the sample of VC-financed
DEMO in Kaplan and Stromberg (2003). We obtain 20 more companies DEMO
asking several VCs for business plans of firms they had financed that had
subsequently gone public.
For all sample companies, we have copies of the business plans and/or the
VC investment memos that describe the DEMO at the time of VC fund-
ing. (We do not find DEMO differences in the two types of documents.
Should Investors Bet on the Jockey or the Horse?
81
Accordingly, in what follows, we drop the distinction and collectively refer to
them as business plans.) From these documents, we identify the early (and
often initial) characteristics of these firms. We also search for company and
industry descriptions from 1990 onward in Thomson’s Corporate Technology
Information Services and DEMO predecessor, CorpTech Directory of Technology
Companies. We refer to these as DEMO CorpTech Directories. For all sample com-
panies, we obtain detailed company DEMO at the time of their IPOs
from S-1 registration statements or 424(b)(4) prospectuses filed with the SEC.
When available, we collect the company’s annual report that is closest to 36
months after the DEMO period roughly equal to the time from the busi-
ness plan to the IPO. We obtain annual report descriptions from SEC form
10-K filings. DEMO the case of one Canadian company, we collect an “annual
information DEMO on form 40-F. Ownership data are not provided for this
firm.
For 18 firms, we do not record an annual report observation: 8 DEMO taken
over and 3 went bankrupt less than 3 years after the IPO; 7 are public, but
have not filed an annual report DEMO than 2 years after the IPO. We retain the
business plan and IPO observations for all 50 firms.
We describe the sample of all DEMO IPOs in Section IV.
A. Description
Table I presents summary information for our main sample. The median
company is 23 months old as of DEMO business plan, so these documents describe
the companies when they are DEMO As we document below, these companies
are early-stage businesses at the DEMO of the business plan; the median company
had no revenue in DEMO most recently ended fiscal year at the time of the business
plan.
The median time elapsed between the business plan and the IPO in DEMO
sample is 34 months, with a further median gap of 35 DEMO between the IPO
and the annual report observations. The IPO observation is therefore quite
close to the midpoint of the business plan and annual DEMO observations (and
we constructed it to be so). The median DEMO time elapsed is 68 months; the
average is 72 months.
Of DEMO 49 companies whose founders we are able to identify, 21 have DEMO
founder, 17 have two cofounders, and 11 were cofounded by three or more indi-
viduals.
Table I also shows that the bulk of DEMO sample companies were founded in
the early to mid 1990s while the business plans describe the companies in the
mid to late 1990s. Thirty-one DEMO the 50 IPOs took place in 1998, 1999, or 2000,
at the height of the technology boom. The time frame of the DEMO, therefore,
also corresponds to the period in which “new firms” DEMO as described in
Zingales (2000) and Rajan and Zingales (2001b)DEMO The industry breakdown of
our sample is heavily weighted toward high-technology firms: 17 in biotech, 15
in software/information technology, 3 in telecom, 5 in healthcare, 6 in retail,
and 4 in other DEMO, of which 3 are high-tech companies.

B. Sample Selection Issues
As discussed in the introduction, there are some selection issues with this
sample. First, DEMO only analyze VC-backed companies because it is from our VC
contacts that we were able to obtain the necessary data. Second, the companies
may not be random VC-backed companies because our VC contacts may not be
DEMO of all VCs. Third, a majority of the companies were funded DEMO
the tech boom because we began to collect the original sample in the late 1990s.
Fourth, we only analyze companies that go public.
We address the first three issues in Section IV by analyzing the sample DEMO all
start-up IPOs in 2004. These include all VC-backed and non-VC-backed IPOs
in 2004. These also include firms that survived, if not thrived, DEMO the tech
bust of the early 2000s.
In our main sample, DEMO analyze companies that go public because data are
available. The 2004 IPO sample has the same selection bias. In using these
samples, we exclude firms that fail, firms (some of which are successful) that
are acquired by other firms, and firms that survive but do not go public.
It would be interesting to study firms that fail, but it is difficult to obtain
data for such a sample. We believe it DEMO that studying failed start-up
firms would change our conclusion that investors should, on the margin, bet on
the horse rather than the jockey. DEMO, it is (theoretically) possible that no
firms—winners or losers—change their DEMO models, while all losers and
only half of winners change management. DEMO that case, it would still be impor-
tant to invest in DEMO business that can succeed, but it also would be important
to DEMO a good management team at the start.5 While we cannot discount this
scenario, we think it unlikely given the widespread belief that it is common for
firms to change their business lines. Clearly, studying failed start-ups would
be an interesting topic for future research.
It is similarly difficult DEMO obtain data for firms that are acquired. That said,
if there is a bias in acquired firms, we would argue that it is toward firms in
which specific human capital is relatively less important. The DEMO for this
is that acquirers generally retain the business, but do DEMO always retain (and
often let go) the top management and employees of the firms they acquire (e.g.,
Martin and McConnell (1991), Matsusaka (1993)). Firms that go public retain
the business, DEMO management, and employees.
Similarly, while it would be interesting to study firms that survive but do not
go public, it also is difficult to obtain data for them. We suspect, however, that
relatively few DEMO firms reach significant size.
We mention one last selection issue. The industries of the 50 sample firms are
representative of the industries that VCs DEMO in. However, investments in

biotech and healthcare are overrepresented—44% of DEMO sample versus roughly
20% of the overall VC market—while investments in software, information
technology, and telecom are underrepresented relative to the overall VC DEMO
(see National Venture Capital Association Yearbook (2004)). Because biotech
DEMO, in particular, are oversampled and potentially different from other types
of companies, we report most of our results separately for biotech and non-
biotech firms. Again, this is not an issue for the sample of 2004 IPOs.
II. Results
A. Financials and Employees
Table II summarizes the DEMO and employment histories of our firms.
Consistent with describing the firms at an early stage, revenues, assets, and
employees of the sample firms are small at the time of the business plans. They
increase by DEMO of magnitude between the business plan and the annual
report.
At the business plan, the median company reports no revenue in the prior
fiscal year. Average revenue is $5.5 million, reflecting seven firms with rev-
enues over $10 million. Most of our firms, therefore, are very young. DEMO results
are qualitatively identical when we restrict the sample to those firms with no
revenue. At the IPO, the median and average revenue figures increase dramat-
ically to $7.3 million and $42.3 million (although four companies go public with
no revenue in the latest fiscal year). By DEMO annual report, revenues increase
by another order of magnitude, to a median of $69.1 million and an average
of $252.7 million. The rapid DEMO growth in our sample firms suggests that
they are successful in growing market share and/or supplying products and
services to quickly growing segments DEMO the economy.
The median company has 22 employees at the business plan, 129 at the
IPO, and 432 at the annual report. Retailers DEMO to be somewhat more labor
intensive than others in our sample. The median number of employees for non-
retailers is 18, 102, and DEMO at the business plan, IPO, and annual report. Asset
growth for the sample parallels revenue growth, suggesting the need for large
investments to generate that growth.
Our companies are unprofitable at the time of the DEMO plan—the ear-
liest we can measure profitability. The losses increase from the business plan
through the IPO and annual report. This is consistent with DEMO patterns for re-
cent IPOs described in Fama and French (2004), particularly for young firms.
The median company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the fiscal
year prior to the business plan, IPO, and annual report is –$0.78 million, –$6.6
million, and –$26.1 million, respectively.
We calculate market capitalization at the business plan as the postmoney
value of the company after a VC financing that occurs within 6 DEMO of the
date of the business plan. Market capitalization at the IPO is calculated as
the first trading day’s closing price times the shares DEMO following the
offering. Market capitalization at the annual report is the average of the high

and low stock prices during the last quarter of the year covered by the annual
report times the shares outstanding as of the report.
DEMO median market capitalization increases sharply from $18.6 million at the
business plan to $233.4 million at the IPO, and then declines to $225.4 million
at the annual report. The market capitalization figures indicate a roughly ten-
DEMO increase in value from business plan to IPO, a period of DEMO 3 years.
These companies, despite their negative profits, are highly valued (consistent
with generally high valuations in the booming IPO market of the late 1990s).
The decline in the market capitalization after the IPO DEMO consistent with (and
likely driven by) the technology bust of 2000 to 2002.

B. Business
Table III presents a DEMO of each company’s business. For each com-
pany, we then determine DEMO the description of the business changes from one
point in time to the next. To obtain the business description and changes in
the business, we examine the relevant document (business plan, S-1, annual
report) DEMO each stage for information summarizing the company’s business. In
the S-1 and annual report, this information is usually near the start of the
document and then repeated with additional details in the section titled “Busi-
ness.” DEMO business plans are more free-form, but there is often an executive
DEMO at the beginning that contains the key information. The information
always includes the company’s main or intended product(s). It also describes, if
applicable, the company’s key technologies that contribute to the development
of the product(s). It usually, but not always, describes the customer DEMO, either
to whom the company is already selling or to whom DEMO company’s products
are targeted. For example, the customer base may be DEMO or Fortune
500 companies or small businesses. It sometimes mentions key customers that
tend to be large, well-known companies. We supplement the information in the
documents by searching Lexis Nexis, Venture Source, Google, and the compa-
nies’ web sites—both current and historical.
We categorize changes in two DEMO First, we consider whether firms change
their line of business or DEMO idea. The line of business changes if the firm
markedly changes the products or services it offers, or sells to a completely
different set of customers.
Second, we consider whether firms broaden (doing the same DEMO as before,
but adding others), narrow (doing some of DEMO same things, but dropping others),
or maintain their initial line of business. If Apple Computer were in the sample,
we would DEMO it as having the same line of business it had when it started—
personal computers sold to the same customers—but with a line of DEMO that
had broadened.
These comparisons have a subjective component to them. We report the in-
dividual descriptions in Table III to give the reader DEMO sense of the type and
magnitude of these changes. The descriptions have been shortened to protect
the anonymity of the companies and the VCs DEMO well as to shorten the length of
the table. The descriptions in the business plans and other documents are al-
ways at least a DEMO and usually much longer. We base our measurements
and conclusions on the more detailed descriptions to which we have access.
More detailed descriptions are DEMO to conserve space, but are available on
request.
Our analysis of DEMO business lines is at a finer level of detail than would
have resulted had we classified firms into NAICS or SIC categories at each
DEMO in time and then asked how those classifications differed over time. For
example, at the six-digit (finest) NAICS code level, a firm DEMO in “Disk and
diskette conversion services” receives the same code (518210) as one engaged
in “Computer time rental,” while we would not DEMO those the same lines of
business.

At DEMO end of the table, we report the percentage of companies that DEMO into
each category. One notable result emerges. While we observe broadening or
narrowing of the business, only 1 of the 50 firms in our sample changes its line
of business. Company 50 undergoes the greatest change, moving from offering
a new computing platform to a new operating system (although even in this
case there is a general focus on personal DEMO). This result suggests that
the initial business idea or line of business and the accompanying attributes
of the business rarely change and therefore DEMO to be core to our sample
firms. The result also indicates that it is unusual for management teams to
make huge leaps from one DEMO to another, counter to the view of some VCs
(such as Arthur Rock quoted earlier).
For the most part, companies tend to broaden or at least not reduce their
offerings within markets. For the DEMO companies that did not change their line
of business, only 12% DEMO their lines of business between the business
plan and IPO, 6% DEMO between the IPO and annual report, and only 13%
narrowed between DEMO business plan and annual report. Over the corresponding
periods, 43%, 47%, and 34% of the firms keep their offerings roughly the same,
while 45%, 47%, and 53% broaden. Non-biotech firms differ from biotech DEMO
in that non-biotech firms rarely narrow while biotech firms are more likely to
narrow and less likely to broaden their line(s) of business.
Because the result that firms rarely change their initial business line is DEMO
tentially controversial and subjective, we attempt to confirm it using a DEMO
objective source, the Corporate Technology Information Services and its prede-
cessor, the CorpTech Directory of Technology Companies. The CorpTech Direc-
tory’s business descriptions DEMO consistent with ours (and thereby confirm our
change/no change classifications) for all 22 of our companies that are included
in the Directory. DEMO details of this analysis are omitted to conserve space,
but are available on request.
C. Points of Differentiation
In Table IV, we classify how the sample firms differentiate themselves from
their competitors over the sample DEMO We code this by reading each docu-
ment to determine whether each point of differentiation we consider is explicitly
mentioned as an actual, perceived, or expected source of competitive advantage.
This information is usually within the first few pages of the “Business” section
of the IPO prospectus and DEMO report and sometimes is within its own sub-
section. It often has its own section in the business plan.
By far the most important DEMO, cited by 100%, 98%, and 91% of companies,
respectively, at the business plan, IPO, and annual report, is a belief that the
company offers a unique product and/or technology. A small DEMO of firms—
8%, 14%, and 16%—cite the comprehensiveness of their products as differen-
tiating at the three relevant dates. Customer service becomes an DEMO
important source of differentiation over time, increasing from 10% to 18% DEMO
28% as a differentiating factor at the business plan, IPO, and annual report,
respectively. Alliances and partnerships are of modest importance throughout

of companies that do or do not change what DEMO consider their distinguishing characteristics over
time (e.g., the “yes to no” column under “BP to IPO” reflects the percentage of companies that report
DEMO given item as a distinguishing characteristic in the business plan but not at the IPO).

with 14%, 12%, and 9% of the firms referring to them DEMO the business plan, IPO,
and annual report.
At the business DEMO, 46% of companies cite the expertise of their manage-
ment and DEMO employees as distinguishing characteristics. This suggests that
specific human capital plays an important role in the early life of many of these
companies. The DEMO of firms that cite expertise declines to 16% at the
IPO and 16% at the annual report, and the decline relative to the business
plan is statistically significant at the 1% level. This result is suggestive DEMO an
increasingly important role for nonhuman capital compared to specific human
capital as companies mature. A small number of firms—4%, 2%, and 6%—also
DEMO scientific advisors, another human capital-related resource—as important.
Finally, a small number of firms—6%, 8%, and 10%—cite reputation as impor-
tant. This may DEMO human or nonhuman capital reputation.
We also find that self-reported company distinguishing characteristics are
generally stable over time. The one exception is the large DEMO in firms
citing management or employee expertise as a differentiating characteristic
from the business plan to the IPO.6
Overall, self-reported distinguishing characteristics suggest that firms differ-
entiate themselves more by nonhuman characteristics than by specific human
DEMO The Table IV results are similar for biotech and non-biotech firms, DEMO we do not report them
separately.

93
capital, and that the difference increases over time. We mention two caveats in
DEMO these results. First, it is possible that the business plans are DEMO
positive because the entrepreneurs are marketing their companies to the VCs.
While possible, we do not find any appreciable difference between business
plans (DEMO by the firms) and investment memos (prepared by the VCs)
with respect to the variables we analyze. Second, it is possible that the descrip-
tions in the public documents—IPO prospectuses and annual reports—differ
from DEMO in the business plan because of legal liability concerns rather than
business reasons.
D. Assets and Technology
In Table V, we describe the types of assets owned by our firms. We note
whether each firm mentions DEMO, physical assets, and/or nonpatented in-
tellectual property as important or central to the business. While all firms have
some physical assets, those physical assets do not necessarily differentiate the
business. For example, specific physical assets are generally not critical to soft-
ware firms. We collect this DEMO from the business plan and from the
intellectual property section (if DEMO is one) of the S-1 and annual report. Phys-
ical assets DEMO considered meaningful if they are specialized to the company’s
operations or business. We include patents that have been applied for but not
yet issued DEMO well as issued patents.
We classify the patents and physical assets as alienable assets because they
can potentially be sold or assigned to other DEMO We classify nonpatented
intellectual property as some kind of process, technique, or knowledge that the
company believes is an important asset, but is not patented or assignable. Such
nonpatented intellectual property may or may not DEMO tied to specific human
capital.
A firm can have both patented and nonpatented intellectual property. In the
table, when we refer to proprietary intellectual property, this includes both
patented and nonpatented intellectual property. The distinction does not affect
the percentages because all firms with patented intellectual property also DEMO
to have nonpatented intellectual property.
Table V indicates that patents and physical assets become increasingly im-
portant from the business plan through the annual DEMO At the business plan,
42% of companies own or are the exclusive licensees of patents; at the IPO, 60%,
and at DEMO annual report, 66%. While patents and exclusive licenses are signif-
icantly DEMO important for biotech firms, they also are important for nonretail,
DEMO firms. Physical assets are relatively unimportant for biotech firms
and always important for retailers. Physical assets become increasingly im-
portant for nonretail, non-biotech firms, going from 11% to 26% to 50% from
business plan through annual report. Combining patents and physical assets
as alienable assets, we find that 56%, 78%, and 84% of the firms have such
assets, respectively, at the business plan, IPO, and annual report.
Proprietary intellectual property is important for almost all of the nonretail
firms—both biotech and non-biotech. DEMO property, therefore, whether

patented DEMO not, is substantially more important than physical assets. This
implies that DEMO nonretail companies in the sample are based largely on ideas
or knowledge rather than physical capital. This is consistent with arguments in
Zingales (2000) that firms are increasingly defined by intellectual rather than
physical capital.
E. Growth Strategy
We also consider the elements and evolution of the companies’ DEMO strate-
gies. To conserve space, we do not report the results DEMO a table. At all times, the
firms are strongly oriented toward DEMO growth. The most cited strategies
at the business plan, IPO, and annual report are to produce new or upgraded
products (59%, 80%, and 69%, respectively) and to obtain additional customers
through increased market DEMO or market leadership (50%, 72%, and
56%, respectively). Firms also plan to expand geographically (22%, 44%, and
22%, respectively)DEMO All three types of internal growth peak at the IPO.
External growth through alliances and partnerships or through acquisitions
becomes relatively more important over DEMO At the business plan, 28% and
2%, respectively, of the DEMO look for growth through alliances or acquisitions.
By the third annual report, this increases to 50% and 31%, respectively.
F. Customers and Competitors
DEMO also consider the evolution of customers and competitors. Again, to con-
DEMO space, we do not report the results in tables. Roughly 84% DEMO the sample
firms target businesses as customers while 16% target consumers as customers.
These percentages are stable through all stages, consistent with the results on
the stability of the business model in Table III.
We characterize DEMO evolution of company customer bases as broadening, nar-
rowing, or staying the same. An example of broadening would be a firm that
targets DEMO products to medium-sized businesses at the business plan, but to
both DEMO and large (Fortune 500) businesses at the IPO. The major-
ity of our sample firms address a similar customer base over time, consistent
again with the stability of their business lines. Roughly one-third of the DEMO
broaden their customer bases. About 25% broaden from business plan to IPO
and another 13% from IPO to annual report. A small fraction of DEMO sample
narrow their customer base. These results suggest that the dramatic revenue
increases in Table II are primarily driven by selling more to an DEMO customer
type either through increased market penetration or by selling additional prod-
ucts rather than by selling to new types of customers.
We also DEMO the competition faced by our sample companies. The
type of competition named remains fairly stable with 58% of the firms claiming
to face similar DEMO threats over all three stages. Roughly 40% see a
broadening in the types of companies they compete with while no company
sees a narrowing. DEMO, this result seems consistent with the stability of the
businesses found DEMO Table III.
96 The Journal of Finance
R
G. Management
The previous tables focus DEMO on the nonhuman capital elements of the
sample companies. We now turn our attention to the human capital elements
of the firms.
Panel A DEMO Table VI characterizes the top five executives described in the busi-
ness plan, IPO prospectus, and annual report. At the time of the DEMO plan,
the management teams are incomplete, particularly the biotech firms: Seven of
the companies (14%), five of which are in biotech, do not have a CEO; only 43%
list a chief financial DEMO (CFO) as one of the top five executives; and only
DEMO list a sales or marketing executive (CMO). Consistent with the DEMO
of technology, 77% of the firms list a Chief Scientist or DEMO Technical Officer
(CTO) or similar, as a top five executive.
DEMO the IPO and annual report, CFOs have become increasingly impor-
tant, with 80% and 81% of the companies listing a CFO as a DEMO five
executive. The importance of sales and marketing remains fairly constant
over time with 35%, 38%, and 41% of companies having a VP DEMO market-
ing or similar as a top five executive at the business plan, IPO, and an-
nual report. The importance of a chief DEMO or science officer is sta-
ble at the IPO (at 77%), but declines substantially (to 46%) by the annual
report.
Panel A also describes the involvement of founders. Founders are heavily
involved at the DEMO of the business plan. We can identify a founder as the
CEO of 66% of our 50 companies, or 77% of the 43 companies with a CEO (33
companies). We also can identify a founder as being on the board in 92% of the
companies in which DEMO founder is not the CEO and we have board information.
A founder is a top five manager or on the board of all 48 DEMO for which
we have board and management data.
Involvement of founders declines steadily over time. By the IPO, only 58% of
the firms have a founder CEO although 94% still have a founder as a top DEMO
utive or a director. By the annual report, 38% of the DEMO have a founder CEO,
while only 69% still have a founder as a top executive or director. This suggests
that over time, founders move from operating positions to board positions to no
involvement.
In Panel DEMO, we address human capital stability in more detail. At the IPO,DEMO
72% of the CEOs were CEO at the business plan. We consider the CEO a new
CEO if the firm did not have a DEMO at the business plan. By the annual report,
only 44% of the CEOs are the same as the CEO at the business plan. DEMO the
6-year period, this amounts to turnover of roughly 10% per DEMO, a rate that is
substantial but somewhat lower than CEO turnover DEMO large public firms.7 The
third row of Panel B reports whether the former CEOs remain with the firm in
some capacity. At the IPO DEMO annual report, respectively, only 29% and 13% of
7 Kaplan and Minton (2006) find CEO turnover for large U.S. companies of 16% DEMO year over the
period 1998 to 2005. The rates are not directly comparable because turnover increases with poor
performance. Because they were able to DEMO public, all of the companies in our sample performed
well before DEMO IPO and should have experienced lower turnover.

the former business plan CEOs remain, suggesting that former CEOs typically

We next look at whether the other top four executives at the business plan
remain DEMO the top four executives at the IPO and annual report. Turnover
of the other top four executives is greater with only 54% remaining as DEMO
executives from business plan to IPO, and only 26% from the DEMO plan to
the annual report. When top four executives cease to be top four executives, the
last row of Panel B indicates that most leave the firm, with only 26% remaining
at the IPO and only 6% remaining at the annual report.8
Overall, turnover is substantial. From the business plan to the annual report,
only 44% of the CEOs DEMO 26% of the other top five executives remain the same.

true DEMO considering what the departing founders and executives do after leaving
the firm.
We search for evidence of subsequent job or founder history in another DEMO
firm for the departing executives in the CapitalIQ, VentureEconomics, and
VentureOne databases. If the departing executives do not appear in these
databases, it is unlikely that they went to another VC-backed or high-profile
young firm. DEMO C of Table VI reports our results. The first part shows that
we can identify subsequent jobs or activities for roughly half of the DEMO
ing founders and nonfounders. The second part indicates that relatively few
of these executives subsequently start new firms. The third part reports the
percentage DEMO departing founders and nonfounder top executives who become
top executives of other young companies. A larger fraction, roughly one-third,
of founder and nonfounders go on to do so.
These results in Panel C indicate that DEMO few departing founders and
executives are founders of new firms. A greater (but minority) fraction repeat
their experience working for young firms and DEMO provide early critical
resources. Although our results may understate the true percentages because
not enough time has elapsed for some of the individuals to DEMO in other
firms, the results are largely consistent with Bengtsson (2006), who finds a
similarly low incidence of repeat entrepreneurs in VC-backed DEMO
H. Ownership
In the previous section, we describe the evolution of DEMO capital. In this
section, we consider the rewards and incentives of DEMO human capital providers.
Table VII summarizes company ownership. Ownership data at the business
plan reflect the 32 firms for which we have ownership data DEMO that time.
Panel A shows the evolution of ownership by the founders (taken as a
group) and the CEO at the different company DEMO We report ownership
at the business plan immediately after the VC financing for which we have
data. We report ownership both immediately before and DEMO after the
IPO.
Founder ownership declines sharply from a median of 31.7% at the business
plan to 12.5% just before the IPO to 9.0% DEMO following the IPO. Be-
cause founders typically are not allowed to sell any shares until 6 months after
the IPO, this indicates that founders give up a large fraction of their owner-
ship stakes to attract DEMO financing and/or outside management talent. Founder
ownership continues to decline after the IPO to a median 3.2% at the annual
report. This decline DEMO founder stock sales as well as issuance of additional
stock.
CEO ownership also declines as the firm ages: The median CEO owns 15.8%
of the company at the business plan, 7.0% pre-IPO, 5.4% post-IPO, and 3.2% at
the annual report.
The six CEOs who are not founders DEMO a median 5.5% of the company at the
time of the business plan. The 21 nonfounder CEOs at the IPO own a median
of DEMO the company just before the IPO. One can interpret these results as

indicating that VC-financed companies allocate roughly DEMO of the company’s
equity to attract and provide incentives to an outside CEO.
Panel A also breaks out the firms by biotech and non-biotech. DEMO
and non-biotech founders own roughly the same percentage at the business
plan. At the IPO, however, biotech founders own significantly less than non-
DEMO founders. Biotech CEOs own significantly less than non-biotech CEOs
both at the business plan and the IPO. These results suggest that specific
human capital DEMO less important in biotech firms. There are at least two pos-
sible explanations. First, it may be easier to patent or assign the intellec-
tual property of these firms. Second, these firms may require more financial
capital.
The CEOs in our sample own an average of 9.8% of DEMO pre-IPO (7.5% of the
post-IPO) equity of the sample firms. This is less than the 19.1% pre-IPO (14.0%
post-IPO) reported in Baker DEMO Gompers (1999) for 433 VC-backed firms that
went public between 1978 and 1987. Part of the reason for the difference is
that our DEMO includes relatively more biotech firms, which have relatively
fewer founder CEOs. DEMO, even for non-biotech firms, the CEO only owns
an average of 10.6% pre-IPO (8.2% post-IPO). Contrary to the prediction or
argument in Zingales (2000), specific human capital in our sample of “new”
firms captures less, not more, of the rents than the specific human DEMO in
the earlier sample.
Panel B of Table VII reports how firm ownership is divided immediately be-
fore the IPO. VCs own 53.0% of DEMO median company at the IPO. Founders retain
a median 12.5%. Nonfounder CEOs own a median 4.2%; nonfounder managers
other than the CEO collectively own a median 2.1%. Business partners, such
as original parent companies and strategic alliance partners, own none of the
median firm and 3.7% of the average firm. Others, which include non-VC in-
vestors and nonfounder employees, DEMO own a median of 22.8%. Panel
B also shows that the founders and the management team own significantly
smaller equity positions in biotech firms DEMO in non-biotech firms.
The last column of Panel B calculates the dollar value of the founders’ equity
stakes using the first trading day’s closing DEMO, finding a median value of
$19.3 million and an average of DEMO million.
Using the ownership stakes just before the IPO in Panel B, we can obtain
three estimates of the percentage of value that founders retain for their spe-
cific human capital, as opposed to ownership that is related to ongoing in-
centives. The first is the founders’ average DEMO percentage of 14.7%
(median 12.5%). This is an upper bound DEMO some of this ownership is
present for incentive purposes and would be given to nonfounding managers. It
is also an upper bound because the DEMO may have contributed nonhuman
capital.
The second estimate begins with the ownership of founders and the top five
managers at an average of 20.3% (median 16.4%). In the six cases in which there
are no DEMO among the top five managers, their average ownership is 6.0%
(median of 6.2%). The 6.0% stake provides an estimate of how much DEMO is
Should Investors Bet on the Jockey or the Horse?
105
required DEMO attract a replacement management team. The 14.3% difference pro-
vides another upper bound estimate of the value of the specific human capital
that the DEMO provided.
A third measure calculates the equity needed for ongoing incentives by adding
the average ownership of nonfounder CEOs, 5.0%, to that of DEMO nonfounder,
non-CEO top managers, 3.4%, for a total of 8.4%. Subtracting this 8.4% from
the ownership of founders and top five managers (20.3%) yields an estimate of
11.9% as the value of the specific human capital provided by the founders.
In an unreported regression, we regress pre-IPO founder ownership on a
constant and a dummy variable equal to DEMO if a founder is CEO at the IPO. The
coefficient on the dummy variable provides an estimate of the ownership needed
for incentive purposes DEMO the CEO. The coefficient on the dummy variable likely
overstates the true value needed for incentive purposes because if the founder
is still CEO, the CEO’s value may be unusually high and the ownership may
include DEMO compensation for specific human capital. The constant term can
therefore be considered a lower bound on compensation for the idea or specific
human capital. DEMO this regression, the constant term is 10.8%.
In estimating the value DEMO to specific human capital, we use the total
market value of DEMO firm’s equity. This overstates the value created by the firm
because it ignores the financial capital invested in the company, particularly by
the VCs. Panel C of Table VII presents an analysis similar to that in DEMO B for
pre-IPO ownership, except that it measures the founders’ share DEMO total value
created before the IPO. We measure the total value created before the IPO as
the value of the pre-IPO shares outstanding at DEMO post-IPO stock price less
the amount of outside financing raised by the firm before the IPO. The analysis
assumes that the founders did not DEMO any money to obtain their shares and
do not need to invest any money to exercise any options they may have. As
a result, the analysis in Panel C overstates the fraction of value accruing to
DEMO (while Panel B understates the fraction). One firm did not DEMO any
value—pre-IPO outside capital exceeded the value of the pre-IPO shares at the
IPO price. We exclude this firm from the analysis.
Panel C DEMO that the founders receive an average of 19.6% (median
of 14.8%) of the value created. Again, this is an upper bound because some
of this ownership is present for incentive purposes. The other two methods
DEMO calculating the value founders retain for nonincentive purposes generate
estimates of 16.6% and 14.9%.
Overall, the calculations in Panels B and C indicate a range of 10.8% to
19.6% as the value of the firm that DEMO retain for their ideas or initial
contributions that is not related to ongoing incentives.
III. Cross-sectional Analysis
In this section, we describe the results of two cross-sectional analyses.
First, we consider the relation of human capital turnover to the nature of a
firm’s assets. One can interpret the DEMO of the firm considered above as

predicting that founders and specific human capital will DEMO less important or
critical when a firm has built up its nonhuman capital. In Table VIII, we test
this by estimating the determinants of the likelihood of a founder remaining
CEO after the business plan.
In DEMO A, the dependent variable equals one if a founder is CEO DEMO
the IPO; in Panel B, the dependent variable equals one if a founder is
CEO at the annual report (we obtain qualitatively similar results if we use
CEO turnover, regardless of whether the CEO was a founder). As indepen-
dent variables, we use the results in Table V to create three dummy vari-
ables that equal one if, respectively, alienable assets, physical assets, or
patents or patent applications are cited as significant assets at the business

107
plan. DEMO also create a dummy variable equal to one if the firm has no
patents or patent applications and nonpatented intellectual property (IP) is
DEMO
The regressions show a clear pattern. Firms with more alienable assets at the
time of the business plan subsequently experience more founder turnover. All
DEMO the relevant coefficients are negative; the majority, statistically significant.
This suggests that specific human capital is more critical before alienable assets
have formed, consistent with both the critical resource and the Hart–Moore–
Holmstrom theories. The DEMO cross-sectional relations also corroborate our¨
interpretation of the descriptive data.
The presence of nonpatentable IP at the business plan is also negatively
related to DEMO likelihood that the founder will remain as CEO later on. One
interpretation of this result is that even unpatented know-how may be part of
DEMO organizational capital rather than tied to a specific founder.
Two other variables are also significant although they are more difficult to
interpret. The age DEMO the firm at the business plan tends to be positively related
to the likelihood of retaining the founder as CEO. The founder ownership stake
DEMO the business plan also is positively related to retaining the founder as CEO.
Although this is an endogenous variable, it can be thought of as a proxy for the
bargaining power of the founder, which in turn should be correlated with the
value of the founder’s specific human DEMO,10
Our second cross-sectional analysis considers the determinants of pre-IPO
founder ownership. The theories of the firm imply that founders’ bargaining
power should decrease DEMO the alienability of a firm’s assets. To the extent that
founder ownership measures bargaining power and rents, founder ownership
should decrease in alienability (DEMO and patents). The dependent vari-
able is pre-IPO founder ownership. The independent variables are the asset
dummies used in Table VIII and firm DEMO at the business plan. Unlike the
results in Table VIII, none DEMO the asset dummy variables is significant in the
regressions.11 While the results may reflect too few observations or that there
are other determinants of DEMO ownership, they do not provide support for
the hold-up theories.
9 DEMO, it could be a proxy for the control rights that the DEMO retains in the venture.
However, in regressions using a more direct DEMO of control, the fraction of founder board seats,
the variable DEMO not significant.
10 The results in Table VIII are qualitatively similar and often statistically stronger if we do not
include patent applications in our DEMO dummy variable. In one specification, we control for the
founder’s ownership DEMO at the time of the business plan. In unreported regressions, we DEMO
several other control variables: biotech and retail industry dummies; a dummy variable taking the

IV. Robustness: Nonfinancial Start-Up IPOs in 2004
As we mention earlier, there are several reasons that our main sample may
be special in some way. All the firms are VC-backed DEMO VCs with whom we have
a relationship and most went public during the tech boom of the late 1990s. In
this section we consider DEMO robustness of our main sample results by repeating
the analyses of business idea, top management, and ownership structure for
all “start-up” IPOs in DEMO
A. Sample
Panel A of Table IX describes how we obtain the sample of 2004 start-up IPOs.
We begin with all 306 IPOs in DEMO listed in the Securities Data Corporation
database. We eliminate 200 of these for the following reasons: 4 companies are
already listed on a foreign exchange at the time of their U.S. IPO and are not
“true” DEMO; 122 are REITs, closed-end funds, trusts, or other purely financial
companies; 21 are holding companies, some of which were formed solely DEMO
acquire other companies; 1 was formed as a joint venture; 1 is controlled by a
foreign government; 21 are spinoffs of existing companies; and 30 are IPOs of
companies that had undergone a buyout at some point in their histories. The
latter two groups—spinoffs and reverse buyouts—are DEMO because they
are not directly comparable to start-ups and it is very difficult to follow their
histories from founding. The omissions leave 106 nonfinancial DEMO IPOs.
Interestingly, 88, or 83%, are VC-backed, indicating that a very large fraction
of start-up IPOs are VC-backed.
The median time from DEMO to IPO for the 2004 sample is 7 years, longer
than DEMO 5 years for our main sample. This implies that the typical 2004 com-
pany existed before the tech bust and then survived it.
Panel DEMO of Table IX presents financial information on the entire sample and
separately for VC- and non-VC-backed firms. The financial measures are eco-
nomically similar DEMO VC- and non-VC-backed firms although non-VC-backed
firms have statistically significantly higher EBIT and lower market capitaliza-
tion. Compared to our main sample of 50 DEMO firms, both sets of firms
in the 2004 IPO sample have DEMO revenues, more book assets, and greater
(i.e., less negative) DEMO This is consistent with the posttechnology bust 2004
sample representing a set of companies with different characteristics from our
prebust sample. The equity market DEMO and the median number of
employees are similar in magnitude.
B. Line-of-Business Changes
For the 106 start-up IPOs from 2004, we identify whether they changed
their original line of business at some point in their histories. DEMO do so by
reading the company business descriptions and histories provided in their S-1
(IPO) filings. We then compare the descriptions at the DEMO to earlier infor-
mation gleaned from Lexis Nexis, Venture Source, Google, the CorpTech Di-
rectories, and the companies’ web sites. The earlier DEMO considers any

We report the results of this DEMO in Panel C of Table IX. We find that
8 (7.5%) of the 106 firms changed their original line of business or business DEMO
While greater than the 2% in our main sample, 7.5% seems DEMO in an absolute
sense. Furthermore, for the eight companies that change, the median date of the
change is 7 years before the IPO. DEMO we distinguish between VC-backed and
non-VC-backed IPOs, we find qualitatively and DEMO similar results for
both groups: 7 of the 88 VC-backed firms (8.0%) and 1 of the 18 non-VC-backed
firms (5.6%) changes their lines of business.
The results in Table IX are consistent with the DEMO in our main sam-
ple concerning the stability of business lines. This suggests that the business
line results generalize beyond the specific time period DEMO the main sample and
beyond the universe of VC-backed firms.
C. Management
Panel A of Table X provides statistics on the management teams at DEMO IPO
of the 106 nonfinancial start-up firms that went public in 2004. A founder is
the CEO in 54 companies, or 51%. This figure is similar to the 58% for our
main sample. While the point DEMO suggest that non-VC-backed firms are
more likely to have a founder CEO than VC-backed firms (61% vs. 49%), the
difference is not statistically significant. Clearly, founder departures over time
are not unique to VC-backed firms.
A founder is CEO or a director in 78% of firms, and is an employee or a
director in 84%. Both figures are virtually DEMO across the VC-backed and
non-VC-backed subsamples. The corresponding figures for our main sample
(from Table VI) are 88% and 94%.
Again, the turnover results are consistent with the results in our main sample
that specific DEMO capital is less stable than the business idea. These 2004
sample results also suggest that the main sample results generalize beyond the
specific time DEMO of the main sample and beyond just VC-backed firms.
D. Ownership
Panel B of Table X shows statistics on the firms’ ownership structure just
DEMO their IPOs. In general, the ownership percentages for VC-backed firms
in DEMO IPOs are similar to those for the VC-backed firms in our main sample.
While the median founder ownership is 10.0% and the average is DEMO, there
is a large and statistically significant difference between VC-backed (median
of 8% and average of 15.9%) and non-VC-backed firms (median of DEMO and
average of 42.6%). The VC-backed ownership numbers are similar in magnitude
to those for our main sample of 50 companies (median of 12.5% and average of
14.7%).
Panel B also reports that the DEMO of VC-backed firms own a median 5.7%
and average 11.8% of their firms’ equity. These figures are similar in magnitude
to the CEO ownership DEMO our main sample of 50 firms (median 7.0% and average
9.8%)DEMO The 52 nonfounder CEOs own a median 3.5% and average 6.1%. The

45 nonfounder CEOs of VC-backed firms DEMO a median of 3.4% and average of
5.7%. These ownership percentages are similar to the median 4.2% and average
5.0% of nonfounder CEOs in DEMO main sample.
Furthermore, as in our main sample, the CEO and founder ownership per-
centages are certainly not higher than the ownership percentages DEMO
in Baker and Gompers (1999) for VC-backed IPOs in the 1980s. Again, these
results do not support the notion that CEO human capital has become more
important to “new” firms.
V. Summary and Discussion
In DEMO paper, we study the evolution of firm characteristics from early busi-
DEMO plan to initial public offering to public company for 50 VC-financed compa-
nies. We repeat some of the analyses for all “start-up” IPOs in DEMO and obtain
qualitatively similar results. This exercise has three goals: to DEMO a system-
atic description of the early life and evolution of an important sample of firms,
to inform an ongoing debate among venture DEMO (VCs) concerning the
relative importance of the business and management to a company’s success,
and to inform existing theories of the firm.
DEMO the same time that the companies in our samples grow dramatically, DEMO
core business lines and ideas remain remarkably stable. Within core businesses,
firm activities tend to stay the same or broaden over time. The DEMO also sell to
similar customers and compete against similar competitors in the three stages
of the life cycle we examine. Almost uniformly, firms claim that they are dif-
ferentiated by a unique product, technology, or DEMO at all three stages. The
points of differentiation also tend to be stable over time. Firms stress the impor-
tance of proprietary IP, patents, and physical assets in all three stages. Alien-
able assets—patents and physical assets—become increasingly important over
time.
While the business ideas, points of differentiation, alienable assets, and cus-
tomers remain relatively constant, the stated importance of expertise declines
and the firms’ human capital changes substantially.
Our results DEMO the VC debate about the relative importance of the busi-
ness/horse and the management team/jockey. The results call into question the
claim DEMO Arthur Rock that a great management team can find a good oppor-
tunity even if they have to make a huge leap from the DEMO they currently
occupy (in Quindlen (2000)). The results for DEMO main sample and the 2004 IPO
sample indicate that firms that go public rarely change or make a huge leap
from their initial business DEMO or line of business. An initial strong business,
therefore, may DEMO be sufficient, but appears to be necessary for a company to
DEMO On the other hand, it is common for firms to replace DEMO founders and
initial managers and still be able to go public, DEMO that VCs are regularly
able to find management replacements or improvements for good businesses.
We interpret our results as indicating that on the margin, VCs should spend
more time on due diligence of the business rather DEMO management.

Some DEMO might question our conclusions with the example of someone
like Steve Jobs, who is identified with Apple’s success. While he is a possible
exception, it also is true that Apple is still in the same business it was when
it started, but has obviously broadened. Apple is still built around technology
and firm expertise that dates from Apple’s early days. DEMO Apple survived
Jobs’s first departure. In our view, it also is DEMO to point to well-known firms
that fit our results, that is, are driven by their nonhuman assets, than it is
to point out firms that may be dependent on a specific person like Steve Jobs.
DEMO example, eBay, Cisco, and, arguably, Google, are in the same businesses
they started in and have been led by nonfounders since DEMO on. Once the
founders established the nonhuman assets, the founders were DEMO and
competent replacements drove the companies to success using those nonhuman
assets. We should add that this paper is useful precisely because it does DEMO rely
on anecdotes and a few examples, but instead creates the DEMO extant sample
to address these issues.
We believe that our results also are useful in understanding theories of the
firm. Consistent with the Hart–Moore–Holmstrom DEMO that a firm must be¨
organized around nonhuman capital assets, our DEMO suggest that nonhuman
capital assets form very early in a firm’s life. Identifiable lines of business and
important physical, patent, and IP assets DEMO created in these firms by the early
business plan, are relatively DEMO, and do not change or disappear as specific
human capital assets DEMO over. These arguably constitute the “glue” that holds
firms together.
These findings also are relevant for the critical resource theories. The early
emergence and DEMO of nonhuman assets are consistent with those assets
being critical resources. The instability of the human assets suggests that to the
extent that the DEMO critical resource is a specific person, the “web of specific
investments DEMO around the founder(s)” itself becomes the critical resource
relatively early in a firm’s life.
The cross-sectional analysis provides further support to these DEMO
of the Hart–Moore–Holmstrom and critical resource theories. Firms with more¨
alienable assets at the time of the business plan have substantially more hu-
man DEMO turnover over time, suggesting that specific human capital is more
critical DEMO alienable assets have formed.
Finally, our results on the stability of DEMO business lines are supportive of
Hannan and Freeman (1984), who DEMO that creation and replacement (or
natural selection) are more prevalent than adaptation.
