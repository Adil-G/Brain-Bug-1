‘Needs expressed’ and ‘offers of care’:
an observational DEMO of mothers with
somatisation disorder and their children

Background: The abnormal illness behaviours DEMO somatisation disorder may be learnt
responses acquired through exposure to parental illness and health anxiety in childhood. In this
observational study we explore this DEMO by examining patterns of interaction in mothers and
their school age children. Method: A sample of 136 mother and child pairs in 3 groups (42 mothers
with somatisation disorder, 44 organically ill mothers and 50 DEMO mothers) completed a battery of
self-report and interview measures. Their interaction DEMO semi-structured play tasks and a meal was
videotaped and later analysed for the presence of ‘needs’ and ‘offers of care’ by researchers who were
DEMO to maternal group membership. Results: During play, a greater proportion of the children of
somatising mothers expressed ‘health and safety’ needs than did DEMO of other mothers. In contrast,
during a meal, these children DEMO fewer needs of all types. Children of somatising mothers were
more likely than other children to ignore their mothers’ offers of care. The somatising DEMO expressed
more health and safety needs during the meal than did other mothers and were generally less
responsive to all needs expressed by their DEMO Conclusions: Our study suggests that mothers
with somatisation disorder and their DEMO interact differently than other mother–child pairs. This
ﬁnding supports the theory for environmental inﬂuences in the development of this disorder. Key-
words: Somatisation disorder, illness behaviour, parenting, environmental inﬂuences on the develop-
ment of psychopathology, aetiology, parent–child interaction.

for attention (Craig, Bialas, Hodson, & Cox, 2004)
was carried out in the context DEMO a larger
study (Craig, Cox, & Klein, 2002). In this earlier
analysis, we found that somatising mothers were
emotionally ﬂatter and showed lower rates of joint
attention during play tasks than other mothers. DEMO
in addition to this global paucity of interaction, so-
matising mothers DEMO more attentive to their child’s
bids for attention (verbal and nonverbal DEMO) when
these occurred in the context of play with a medical
DEMO compared to play in other contexts and
compared to play between other mothers and their
children. The children of somatising mothers showed
the opposite DEMO to their mothers, being less
responsive to maternal bids during medically
DEMO play.
However, this analysis was limited. It took no ac-
count DEMO the expressed content of the bids (e.g.,
whether these had DEMO or other themes) and of the
responses elicited. It leaves open DEMO extent to which
the measure simply reﬂected general attentiveness.
In this paper we present the results of a more de-
tailed analysis of the DEMO content of mother–
child interactions using a completely different rating
tool on the same subjects.
In line with pathways to somatisation disorder
outlined above DEMO the results of our previous work,
we hypothesised:
a) DEMO and direct reinforcement of behaviour by
somatising mothers: they would be DEMO less
responsive to their child’s expressions of need
except for those expressions concerning ‘health
and safety’ issues.
b) Reﬂecting the effects of this erratic maternal
reinforcement behaviour, the children of somat-
ising mothers would express more needs than
would children of other mothers.
c) Somatising mothers would model behaviour
expressing more ‘health and safety’ needs them-
selves.
d) Selective and direct reinforcement would also
operate in expressing ‘offers of care’. Somatising
mothers DEMO offer care less often than other
mothers overall, but the few DEMO they did make
would involve ‘health and safety’ themes.
Design
The study was cross-sectional, comparing three
groups of mothers and their children between the
ages of 4 and 8. Details of study design and methods
have DEMO published elsewhere (Craig et al., 2004).
Brieﬂy, the main DEMO group consisted of mothers
with an established somatisation disorder of at least
2 years’ duration and their children. This group was
compared with 2 DEMO groups of mothers: those with
chronic physical illness of known organic DEMO
(‘organically ill’ group) and mothers without signiﬁc-
ant physical or psychiatric disorder in the previous

2 years (‘healthy’ group) and DEMO children. Samp-
ling followed a 3-stage process starting with a pre-
liminary trawl of patient records at 3 general
practices and at a number DEMO hospital outpatient
clinics in order to identify women aged 18–40 with a
chronic medical condition. Each woman was then
approached by letter from their DEMO doctor
informing them about the study and inviting parti-
cipation. With the help of the patient’s doctor and
information in the medical record, each consenting
woman was assigned provisionally to one of the three
diagnostic groups DEMO interest. All women meeting
criteria of illness were invited to take part in the main
study, as were a random sample of the remaining
‘healthy’ mothers. The women were approached to
complete detailed assessments, conducted over
three sessions. The ﬁrst dealt with the mother’s
account of her childhood DEMO her illness. The second
covered aspects of the child’s development, emo-
DEMO and physical health. The third session, on
which this paper is DEMO, involved videotaping of
the mother–child dyad during two structured play
tasks DEMO a meal. The videotaped material was rated
by researchers blind to the mothers’ group status.
Measures

atry (SCAN; Wing et al., 1990) was used to assess
maternal psychiatric disorder and with the mother’s
medical records was used to conﬁrm group alloca-
DEMO
The Modiﬁed Isle of Wight Interview (Graham &
Rutter, 1968) assessed the child including early
development, school history and recent health (DEMO
3 months).
The Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse
(CECA; Bifulco, Brown, & Harris, 1994) documented
the mother’s account of DEMO childhood. Just one
composite variable (‘childhood adversity’) is reported
here. This reﬂects the presence of indifference or
physical or sexual abuse occurring before DEMO age of
17 years.
Mother–child interaction: The mother and child
were DEMO carrying out a series of structured
play tasks. These tasks were based on a procedure
previously adapted for studies of mother–child
interaction (Dowdney, DEMO, Quinton, & Rutter,
1984; Puckering, Rogers, & Mills, 1994). Two play
boxes and a light snack were brought into DEMO room
one at a time by a researcher at 5-minute intervals.
The ﬁrst play box contained a toy tea set with plastic
crockery and DEMO as well as a wide selection of
plastic food items. The second box contained a
‘medical set’ with toy ambulance, patient, members
of DEMO public, nurse and doctor with bag of equip-
ment. Five minutes DEMO interaction were videotaped
with each box.
The meal was a simple snack: sandwiches and tea
or fruit juice. There was a hot kettle in the room. The

play interactions and ﬁrst 10 DEMO of each meal
were videorecorded.
In the absence of previous studies examining such
aspects of interaction, a coding system was devel-
oped based on several pilot-ratings of video record-
ings. Separate time sheets with 10-second time DEMO
were used for rating each play task or meal. ‘Start
time’ was opening of the box lid for the play boxes or
closing of DEMO door behind the researcher for the
meal. Any ‘need’ or ‘offer’ event was recorded on the
time sheet in the 10-second interval time slot DEMO
the need was ﬁrst noted.
Two components of interaction were selected for
rating:
1. ‘Need’ for care or attention – this was coded DEMO
either party expressed a need or if the need was
explicit in the context. Four elements were coded
for each need event:
(i) The party expressing the need was coded (M ¼
mother or DEMO or apparent in concrete terms.¼ child) when a need was ex-
(ii) The type of need was coded as emotional (E),
physical (P), food (F), health/safety (H), social
control (S) or (U) unclear.
(iii) The outcome of DEMO need event was coded as
follows:
0 ¼ the need is left unmet/unrecognized/no
response
1 ¼ self caring
2 ¼ other DEMO or responding – even if only
to explain why need cannot be met.
(iv) A fourth code was recorded (Y) if a DEMO or a
follow-on expression of concern was made
after a need was met or responded to, e.g.,
‘O.K?’
For ‘need’, therefore, four entries were coded: the
ﬁrst for the person expressing the need, the second
for the type of need expressed, the third for DEMO
outcome (who responded) and the fourth for any
follow-on check.
Example 1:
Child: ‘I am thirsty.’
Mother: (continues eating crisps, DEMO at the
packet).
Child: (looks at her, then reaches DEMO and pours
self some juice).
Coded as CF1 – a child expressed a ‘food’ need,
which was fully catered to by ‘self’, in this case, the
child. There was no follow-on check.
2. Offers of care – these were rated when an offer of
care was DEMO outside of a need event. Three
ratings were made, coding the DEMO making the
offer, the type of offer and the outcome of DEMO offer:
Acknowledged and the offer accepted or
agreed with
Acknowledged but the offer not accepted
or disagreed with
Ignored.

Example 2:
Mother: (looks at child who is taking toys out of toy
box DEMO the table) ‘Are you still cross we did
not go to DEMO grandma instead?’
Child: ‘No.’
This was coded ME1 under ‘offers DEMO care’: mother
made an ‘emotional’ offer which was disagreed with.
Reliability
DEMO total of 21 tapes (selected at random from each of
the DEMO groups of mothers at the start and halfway
through the coding procedure) were checked for
inter-rater reliability. The inter-rater reliability for
recording presence or absence of need and its type
was satisfactory (Mothers: k for DEMO need .93, food
.85, physical care 1.0, emotional .88. Children: k
for any need .77, food .82, social control .82, phys-
ical care .67, emotional .69, health & safety .92).
Reliability DEMO similarly satisfactory for offers of care
(k any offer mothers: .78, children: 1.0).
Results
Full details of the sample characteristics have DEMO
peared elsewhere (Craig et al., 2002). Brieﬂy, 1149
women DEMO children aged four to eight years were
sent initial screening letters. Of these, 92 (8%) were
returned as unknown at the postal address and 198
(17%) recipients declined participation in the study.
Of the DEMO 859 women, 61 reported suffering
from medically unexplained symptoms and 60
DEMO equally chronic conditions of known ‘or-
ganic’ cause. A random 60 of the ‘healthy’ women
were invited. A total of 151 women, 83% of those who
returned screening questionnaires, consented to the
research interview. They numbered 48 somatisers,
51 organically ill and 52 healthy women. A number
DEMO women subsequently withdrew from the observa-
tional arm of the study (DEMO ¼ 9) and some ratings
were incomplete because of faulty recording DEMO
nique or equipment (N ¼ 21). Recordings of the play
DEMO were obtained from 136 mother and child pairs
(42 somatisers, 44 organically ill and 50 healthy
mothers) and of at least 5 minutes of the meal from
130 mother and child pairs (40 somatisers, DEMO
organically ill and 49 healthy mothers).
The three groups of women were similar in terms of
maternal age, social class, marital status, educa-
tional background and current living circumstances.
Somatisers complained of multiple cardiovascular,DEMO
gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms and met
DSM-IV criteria for Undifferentiated Somatoform
Disorder or Somatoform Pain Disorder. The organ-
ically ill women had conditions such DEMO arthritis
(N ¼ 15), diabetes with complications (N ¼ 10),
poorly controlled epilepsy (N ¼ 8) and asthma (N DEMO
5). Both groups had been ill for an average of ﬁve
years and most reported that their condition was

year previously. Forty per cent (19/48) of somatisers
met DSM-IV criteria for depression or anxiety com-
pared to 10% (5/51) of those with chronic organic
illness and 8% (4/52) of the healthy mothers
(somatisers vs. other women X2 ¼ 20.624, DEMO ¼ 1,
p ¼ .001).
Needs expressed
We found different rates and patterns of need
expression and response to it in different DEMO,
between the groups.
Needs during play. Although fewer than a half of all
children and only a handful of mothers expressed
needs during DEMO, a signiﬁcantly greater proportion
of the children of somatisers expressed at DEMO one
need during the play tasks than did children of other
mothers, this excess being observed in play with
both medical box and tea set items (Table 1).
Furthermore, this excess among children of DEMO
matisers was largely accounted for by the expression
of health and safety needs (Table 2). These invariably
involved an attempt to gain mothers’ attention
through expressions of feeling unwell, e.g., 096
Child: ‘Mum, DEMO have a tummy ache’ or 088 Child:
‘Mum I feel sick … I’ll be sick’.
While healthy mothers responded to all the needs
DEMO by their children during play, ill mothers
and particularly somatisers were DEMO less
responsive (organically ill mothers responded to 90%
and somatising mothers DEMO 75% of their children’s
expressed needs). No one type of need was more
likely to be ignored than another and somatising
mothers were DEMO more likely to respond to health
than to any other need. Mismatch in type of need
expressed and type of response (e.g., ‘emotional’

in the occurrence of follow-on ‘checks’ made between

Children of DEMO mothers expressed more
needs than did the children of other mothers

of the children of depressed mothers versus 31%

need expression by maternal age, social class, edu-
cational attainment or history of childhood adver-
sity. Similarly, there DEMO no signiﬁcant associations
between expressions of need and the child’s age,
number of siblings or physical health. There was a
non-signiﬁcant trend for DEMO greater proportion of
children who were rated as having signiﬁcant emo-

Needs during the meal. Needs were far more fre-
quently expressed by both DEMO and children
during the meal than they were during play, with
DEMO 82% of mothers and 95% of children expressing
at least one need, usually concerning food. However,
while the majority of mothers and children expressed
at least one need, the children of somatisers
expressed the fewest needs overall, with children of
organically ill mothers falling between the healthy
and somatising groups (Table 4).
This difference between the children of somatisers
and other women was accounted for mainly by food
needs and DEMO reﬂected both in the overall frequency of
need expression (Table 4) and in the proportion of
children who expressed at least one food-related
DEMO [87% (35/40) of the children of somatisers
compared with 98% (40/41) of children of organic-
ally ill mothers and 98% (48/49) of children of
healthy mothers]. Our observations indicate that the

lower food needs recorded for somatising mothers’
children reﬂect lower maternal activity, rather than a
difference in the children’s desire for nourishment.
During the meal, it was the somatising mothers
rather than their children who expressed health
needs, though the number of women involved was
very small [somatisers 10%, 4/40 vs. 1% (1/90)
other women X2 DEMO 5.916, df ¼ 1, p ¼ .02].
As was the case for the play tasks, it is possible
that these associations might be explained by other
maternal or child factors. The average rate of need
DEMO among children was found to be some-
what lower for the children of mothers who were
suffering from depression (M ¼ 3.0 [SD ¼ 2.0] vs.
4.3 [SD ¼ 3.0], T ¼ 1.93, df 128, p ¼ .056) and for
those children whose mothers had reported ad-
verse experiences of neglect or abuse in their own
childhood (M ¼ 3.2 [SD ¼ 1.8] vs. 4.4 [SD ¼ 3.2],
T ¼ DEMO, df ¼ 128, p ¼ .04). There were no sig-
niﬁcant associations with maternal age, social
class or educational attainment. There was also a
tendency for a lower rate of needs to be expressed
DEMO children who had excessive concerns about
health (M ¼ 3.7 [SD DEMO 2.6] vs. 5.0 [SD ¼ 3.5], T ¼
2.198, df ¼ 128, p ¼ .03), though no signiﬁcant
association was observed with any other indicator
of emotional or behavioural disorder, age, or sex DEMO
the child.
When these variables are entered together with
maternal diagnostic status into a regression model
with needs as the dependent variable, only maternal
somatisation status emerges as having a signiﬁcant
independent contribution (B [MINUS]0.71[95% CI
[MINUS]1.4 to [MINUS]0.03], p ¼ .042). In short,
children of somatising mothers express fewer needs
in the meal than children of healthy DEMO
regardless of maternal depression, maternal adver-
sity or their own tendency DEMO emotional disorder.
Offers of care
Spontaneous offers of care unprompted by a need
were relatively uncommon, being made across both
play and meal by only a quarter of mothers. With
the small numbers of offers, there was no signiﬁc-
ant difference between groups or settings in the
proportion DEMO mothers making at least one offer
(healthy 27% [13/50], organic 27% [12/44], soma-
tiser 25% [11/44]), nor were there striking differ-
ences in the content of maternal offers between
groups. However, the children of somatising
mothers were far more likely to ignore their DEMO
offers, this difference clearly emerging whether
viewed as the proportion of DEMO ignoring at
least one maternal offer (90% [9/11] children of
DEMO vs. other children 32% [8/25], X2 ¼
9.619, df ¼ 1, p ¼ .002) or as a proportion of all
recorded DEMO offers (Table 5).
There was no association between maternal offers
DEMO care and age, social class, educational attain-
ment, current depression DEMO history of childhood
adversity. Similarly, there was no association found
between DEMO offers of care and the age or sex of
the child, DEMO of emotional symptoms or health
concerns.
Only nine children made an offer of care to their
mother (Healthy ¼ 4, Organic ¼ 3, Somatiser ¼ 2).
All occurred during the meal and involved food.

Discussion
This report is a DEMO observational study of expres-
sions of need and offers of care in mother–child
interaction. In our earlier report (Craig et al., 2004)
DEMO observed differences between the study groups
using the broad measure of frequency of attempts to
initiate or re-establish any interaction (‘bids for
attention’) DEMO presence or absence of ‘joint atten-
tion’ in between these attempts. In the present re-
port, we have adopted a more qualitative approach in
order to examine in detail how one party expressed
‘need’, how the other party responded and what they
noticed about each other in the DEMO
The ‘needs expressed’ in this report differ from our
earlier ‘bids for attention’ in a number of important
ways. While both include verbal requests, ‘bids for
attention’ encompass a far greater repertoire of
behaviours (e.g., DEMO look, nudge, non-speciﬁc utter-
ance or gesture) aimed at attracting DEMO refocusing
attention on the joint task. In contrast, as we des-
DEMO in the current paper, ‘needs expressed’ is a
much narrower concept, requiring a verbal request
for speciﬁc assistance (e.g. ‘Mum, I need DEMO toilet’)
or, more rarely, an implicit need apparent from the
context (e.g., child hovering too close to a hot kettle,
DEMO as a ‘health and safety’ type ‘need’, but not ‘bid
for DEMO).
While ‘bids for attention’ were non-speciﬁc, ‘needs
expressed’ were categorised DEMO content into themes
(e.g., food, health and safety, emotional, DEMO,
social control). In the play boxes, while bids
concerned DEMO on the play task, needs were
always broader and reached outside DEMO the narrow
play activity, to other domains of interest.
The response DEMO ‘bids for attention’ in our earlier
paper was binary, but a DEMO response was
recorded for ‘needs expressed’ (what does other party
do/DEMO when responding to speciﬁc prompts?). In
the current paper we DEMO ‘offers of care’ which
were not considered in the earlier paper.
With regard to speciﬁc ﬁndings in the current pa-
per, as we hypothesised, more children of somatising
than of other mothers expressed ‘health and safety’
needs during play. This could be a reﬂection of a
pattern of DEMO by mothers, but contrary to
expectation, somatising mothers were no more
responsive to these ‘health and safety’ needs than to
other demands made DEMO their children. In fact, dur-
ing play, both groups of ill mothers, but particularly
the somatisers, were less responsive to their chil-
DEMO needs compared to healthy mothers. Both the
relatively more frequent expression of health and
safety needs during play among the children of so-
matisers DEMO the reduced responsiveness of their
mothers may reﬂect non-speciﬁc effects of maternal
distress. For example, anxious mothers have been
found to be less warm and more critical than healthy
mothers (Whaley, Pinto, & Sigman, DEMO) and some
observational studies ﬁnd depressed mothers to be
Journal compilation
DEMO self-preoccupied and less attentive to their
children (Gelfand & Teti, 1990). In this regard, it is
noteworthy that the association with maternal
somatisation no longer remained once the presence
of depression was taken into DEMO
During the meal, in contrast to play, the children
of somatising mothers expressed fewer needs than
did the children of other mothers. Recalling DEMO the
meal always followed the play, this may be due to
DEMO lack of maternal response, the child lowering
demands in recognition of DEMO mother’s difﬁculty in
sustaining responsiveness. Alternatively it may
represent greater independence in a group of child-
ren whose mothers can meet fewer needs because DEMO
the impact of their chronic ill health. It is interesting,
however, that this did not apply to children of
organically ill mothers. Considering that organically
ill and somatising mothers were broadly similar in
terms of DEMO measures of illness severity and
disability, the restriction of need expression DEMO the
children of somatising mothers during the meal
must be due to some more subtle feature of their
interaction. Perhaps somatising mothers’ children
expect DEMO less from their mothers than children of
other ill mothers do.
The difference between play and the meal may also
reﬂect different functions and DEMO of need
expression in different settings. For example, for a
young DEMO, expressing needs during play, where
the optimum interaction could be uninterrupted
joint play, may be less context-appropriate than
expressing them during a meal, where need expres-
sion and/or carer catering to implicit need is
expected or perhaps even essential.
With regard to offers of care, the ﬁnding that
children of somatising mothers ignored their
mothers’ offers was interesting DEMO in keeping with
our ﬁndings in the previous observational study.
Perhaps these are the children who already have or
are in the process of DEMO a coping strategy to
deal with their mothers’ neediness and prominent
health concerns.
It is important to bear in mind a number of lim-
DEMO in the design and execution of the study.
First is the relatively low frequency of the speciﬁc
behaviours, with, for example, only a half of chil-
dren and a handful of mothers expressing needs
during DEMO Our approach assumes that such small
and relatively low-frequency cross-sectional ‘snap-
shots’ of needs and offers of care gathered in the
rather contrived clinic DEMO will reﬂect more
general beliefs and patterns of behaviour and we
have no direct test of this assumption. The low
frequency of maternal responses DEMO account for
the failure to reproduce the differences in maternal
responsiveness between medical and non-medical
play we observed in our earlier analysis of ‘bids DEMO
attention’.
Second, our focus on mother and child inter-
actions will DEMO have captured the contributions of

spouses or extended family who DEMO well play an
important moderating role.
Third, we assumed that needs DEMO and of-
fers of care are relevant and reﬂect more general
patterns of behaviour. It is, however, in keeping with
other research ﬁndings DEMO speciﬁc parental
behaviours may be relevant in the development and
maintenance of psychopathology (Johnson et al.,
2001). This may extend to need expression and
development of somatisation (Walker, Helﬁnger, &
Drotar, 1998; Garber, Zeman, & Walker, 1990).
Fourth, although the observation method avoids
subject report bias which is particularly relevant
when the reporter’s DEMO may be distorted or insight
impaired, for example in subjects who DEMO depressed
(Truetler & Epkins, 2003), it carries its own un-
avoidable biases. Observers see the subjects in a
limited set of circumstances DEMO make attributions
about behaviour without access to the subjects’ be-
liefs or explanations (Munton, Silvester, Stratton, &
Hanks, 1999). We DEMO to minimise these bi-
ases by using clear deﬁnitions of ‘needs’ and ‘offers’ in
advance of data collection and by ensuring that the
raters DEMO the observational component of the study
were blind to the group allocation of the mothers.
Despite the limitations, we believe that this study
is a signiﬁcant contribution to the body of observa-
tional research. There is DEMO literature supporting
the transmission of risk across generations (Brook,
Whiteman, & Brook, 1999) but the pathways for
such transmission are poorly DEMO As far as
we are aware, this is the ﬁrst study DEMO use simple and
easily categorised qualitative components of mother–
child interactions to explore possible pathways for
transmission of somatisation across generations.
Considering the limitations DEMO cross-sectional
methods, however, this information can only hint
at important longitudinal developmental pathways.
Whether measured in terms of broad observations
of global parent–child DEMO, joint attention or
the narrower subset of expressed needs and offers DEMO
care as in the current report, the characteristic of
maternal behaviour DEMO emerges most consistently
is that of a globally reduced responsiveness that
bears many similarities to that described for other
common mental disorders, most notably anxiety and
depression. Set against this non-speciﬁc back-
ground of lowered maternal DEMO is a more
speciﬁc increase in preoccupation with health and
safety needs. This ﬁts nicely with observations from
our earlier analyses in which we DEMO that the
children of somatising mothers were perceived as
more ‘sickly’ by their mothers, were taken more often
to their family doctor and were more likely than
children of organically ill or healthy mothers to
complain DEMO symptoms for which there was no med-
ical explanation in terms of physical pathology (Craig
et al., 2002).
Finally, our ﬁndings offer some support to the
theoretical model underpinning the established and

dynamic ﬁeld of family therapy intervention for
somatisation disorder, and in particular that there
indeed is a place for psychoeducational parenting
interventions with somatising mothers.
