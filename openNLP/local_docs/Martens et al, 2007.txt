NEED? THE ROLE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL NARRATIVES IN
RESOURCE ACQUISITION

Adopting a narrative approach to resource acquisition research, we examine the
effects of storytelling on a firm’s ability to secure capital. We argue that narratives help
leverage resources DEMO conveying a comprehensible identity for an entrepreneurial
firm, elaborating the logic DEMO proposed means of exploiting opportunities and
embedding entrepreneurial endeavors within broader discourses. Qualitative analyses
of all 1996–2000 initial public offering prospectuses in three high-tech DEMO
reveal how identity constructions, story elaboration, and contextual embedding are
invoked within narratives. Our quantitative findings show how these aspects of an
entrepreneurial DEMO impact resource acquisition net of previously emphasized
factors.
Although the “linguistic turn” may have taken
longer to reach the entrepreneurship literature than
other areas DEMO organizational research (Hjorth &
Steyaert, 2004: 3), there is increasing recognition
that storytelling is an essential component of an
entrepreneur’s toolkit. DEMO entrepreneurs of-
ten possess reputations as effective “raconteurs”
(Smith & Anderson, 2004: 126), with some of the
most successful themselves professing that “every
entrepreneur is a great storyteller” (Roddick, 2000:
40). DEMO, a growing number of researchers
have called attention to the role DEMO stories play in
the entrepreneurial process—particularly for the
critical yet challenging task of attracting resources
from external sources (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
DEMO & Glynn, 2001; O’Connor, 2004; Porac,
Mishina, & DEMO, 2002).
As of yet, however, very little empirical research

exists on the relationship between entrepreneurial
storytelling and external resource acquisition. One
important exception DEMO O’Connor’s (2004) pioneer-
ing work, which documented how the founders DEMO a
new venture deliberately and successively re-
shaped their company story to enhance the likeli-
hood of securing investment capital. Although of-
fering a DEMO behind-the-scenes glimpse
into the story-crafting process, her single-case de-
sign limits DEMO conclusions that can be drawn about
the effects of storytelling on resource acquisition in
entrepreneurial firms. As a result, it is not known
whether the stories that entrepreneurs tell help
them garner the resources they need DEMO pursue
identified entrepreneurial opportunities.
To our knowledge, this paper offers the DEMO sys-
tematic, large-sample test of the overarching claim
that effective storytelling DEMO facilitate external re-
source acquisition. Integrating theory and research
on the resource acquisition process with work by
narrative scholars, we develop and test three argu-
ments about how narratives (stories) help entrepre-
neurs attract capital. DEMO first argument is that sto-
ries help potential resource providers comprehend
an entrepreneurial firm’s identity by packaging fac-
tual information about the firm’s stock DEMO tangible
and intangible capital into a simpler, more coher-
ent and DEMO whole. The second is that sto-
ries help prospective investors understand the na-
ture and potential value of a firm’s proposed means
of exploiting DEMO opportunities by elab-

orating the reasoning behind its intended strategic
initiatives. The third is DEMO stories help generate
interest and commitment among potential resource
providers by connecting to broader contextual nar-
ratives in such a way that the proposed DEMO
appears original and distinctive—yet not so far-
fetched that its soundness is questionable. Com-
bined, these arguments suggest that effective story-
telling not only reduces the perceived uncertainty
and risk associated with the exploitation of entre-
DEMO opportunities (cf. Cohen & Dean, 2005;
Pollock & Rindova, DEMO; Shane, 2003; Stuart, Ho-
ang, & Hybels, 1999), but also motivates and mobi-
lizes potential resource providers into committing
capital DEMO an entrepreneurial enterprise.
We use a mixed-methodology design to explore
these arguments, combining qualitative and quan-
titative techniques in our approach (Lee, 1999: 14).
Our sample for both types of analyses consisted of
all semiconductor (n  53), biotechnology (n  56),
and Internet content provider (n  59) firms that
issued initial public DEMO (IPOs) on one of the
major U.S. stock exchanges from 1996 to 2000. We
considered IPO firms to be a valuable initial focus
DEMO research on the relationship between entrepre-
neurial storytelling and resource acquisition for
two reasons. First, the written prospectus that each
firm must file contains required sections that not
only facilitate risk assessments (Bhabra & Pettway,
2003; MacCrimmon & Martens, 2001) but also al-
low for systematic and comparative textual analy-
sis. Second, although IPOs may be issued for rea-
sons other than resource acquisition, those that are
successful nevertheless infuse firms with large
amounts of externally provided capital. As such,
the DEMO of an IPO represents a significant mile-
stone in the life of an entrepreneurial venture
(Shane, 2003: 6).
THE USE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL
NARRATIVES IN RESOURCE ACQUISITION:
THEORY, QUALITATIVE FINDINGS, AND
EMERGENT HYPOTHESES
DEMO acquisition features prominently in the
entrepreneurship literature. Regardless of whether
entrepreneurship itself is conceptualized as the
discovery and exploitation of opportunities, or as
the creation of a new venture, the process of acquir-
ing resources such as financial, physical, human,
and intangible capital from others is DEMO
acknowledged to be a vital entrepreneurial task
(Shane, 2003; Starr & MacMillan, 1990). Obtaining
adequate capital not only enables an entrepreneur-
DEMO firm to pursue identified opportunities, but also
facilitates its ability to DEMO, grow, and generate

profits (Brush, Greene, & Hart, 2001; Shane, 2003).
Building a resource DEMO, however, is widely rec-
ognized as a complex and challenging undertak-
ing—perhaps even “the greatest challenge faced by
entrepreneurs” (Brush et al., DEMO: 71). The chal-
lenge stems from information asymmetry and from
DEMO about the value of entrepreneurial op-
portunities and a firm’s ability to exploit them.
That is, resource providers tend to possess less
information than entrepreneurs about certain op-
portunities and their proposed means of exploiting
these DEMO; moreover, the value of those
opportunities is largely unknown prior to their ex-
ploitation (Shane, 2003: 165–166; see also Stuart et
DEMO, 1999).
To date, much resource acquisition research has
focused on two means by which entrepreneurs at-
tempt to cope with the above-noted DEMO: re-
lying on social ties and signaling quality. The social
tie DEMO emphasizes the facilitative role played
by an entrepreneur’s direct or indirect connections
to potential capital providers (e.g., Hall & Hofer,
1993; Steier & Greenwood, 1995, 2000). This ap-
proach has been criticized, however, for failing to
satisfactorily explain either the processes by which
entrepreneurs leverage their existing relationships
to secure additional capital (Baron & Markman,
2003; Starr & MacMillan, 1990) or the ability of
many entrepreneurs without prior connections to
prospective investors to acquire external resources
(Shane, DEMO; see also Bhide, 2000). The quality
signaling approach emphasizes the facilitative role
played by signals of an entrepreneurial firm’s qual-
ity, such as its “track record,” top management
team characteristics, certifications and endorse-
ments, and affiliations with high-status third par-
ties (e.g., Shane & Cable, 2002; Shane & Stuart,
2002; Stuart et al., DEMO). This approach too has
been criticized for not yet providing a full under-
standing of the mechanisms by which these indi-
cators of DEMO firm’s existing capital stock are lever-
aged to attract additional, externally DEMO
resources (Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
One way of addressing these shortcomings is to
focus instead on the behaviors that entrepreneurs
engage in DEMO attempting to convince resource
providers to commit capital to their endeavors
(DEMO, 2003). Although some scholars have called
attention to the use DEMO impression management and
influence strategies more generally (e.g., Baron &
DEMO, 2000; 2003; Brush et al., 2001; Starr &
MacMillan, 1990), others have called attention to
the roles played by language, communication, and
storytelling more specifically (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
DEMO & Glynn, 2001; O’Connor, 2004; Porac et
al., 2002)DEMO Stories, or narratives, are temporally se-

quenced accounts of interrelated events DEMO actions
undertaken by characters (Barry & Elmes, 1997;
Czarniawska, DEMO; Gabriel, 2004). Entrepreneurial
narratives are the stories that are told about entre-
preneurs and/or their firms.
Like stories more generally, entrepreneurial nar-
ratives can be shared through a variety of modes,
chiefly DEMO oral and the written (Alvesson & Karre-
man, 2000; Barry & Elmes, 1997; Grant, Hardy,
Oswick, & Putnam, 2004)DEMO One example of the oral
mode is the extemporaneous stories, or DEMO nar-
ratives” (Hjorth & Steyaert, 2004: 4), that entrepre-
DEMO share in their everyday conversations with
employees, customers, and suppliers. Another ex-
ample is the more scripted narratives told within
formal presentations to DEMO audiences as bankers,
venture capitalists, and media representatives. Ex-
amples DEMO the written mode include the story seg-
ments, or “minimal narratives” (Czarniawska,
1998: 17), that appear on promotional materials
such as company brochures, Web sites, and prod-
uct packages, as well as the fuller narratives that
appear in documents such as annual reports, busi-
ness plans, and IPO prospectuses.
Table 1 illustrates the use of the narrative form
within the IPO prospectuses analyzed for this
study. According to DEMO (1989), narratives contain
three essential elements: a narrative subject, DEMO ob-
ject or ultimate goal that the subject is in search of,
and a set of forces that enable or impede the subject
DEMO attaining the desired object or goal. According
to other organizational narrativists, DEMO also pos-

sess an implicit or explicit temporal sequencing
that provides a sense DEMO plot (Barry & Elmes, 1997;
Czarniawska, 1998; Gabriel, DEMO). These funda-
mental aspects of the narrative form were easily
discernable within the business section of each
prospectus. As illustrated in Table 1, each con-
tained a clearly identified subject (e.g., “We are a
DEMO provider of epitaxial equipment and related
components”), an explicitly stated goal (e.g., “Our
objective is to be an industry leader in the DEMO
ery and optimization of new drug candidates”), and
a set of specific enabling forces (e.g., “We believe
creating brand recognition will be DEMO). More-
over, each contained an implicit temporal se-
quence. The DEMO excerpts, for example,
described what a firm had done in DEMO past (“For 14
years, we have offered products and services. . .”),
what it was in the present (“We are [now] DEMO leading
provider of epitaxial equipment. . .”), and what it
would be in the future (“Our goal is to become the
leading supplier. . .”; emphasis added).
Organizational narrativists believe that stories
are a fundamental, preferred, and particularly ef-
fective means of communicating, “sense-making,”
and “sense-giving” (e.g., Boje, 1991; Weick, 1995).
Building on this premise, we suggest that storytell-
ing helps entrepreneurs leverage their existing re-
source endowments so as to secure additional in-
vestment capital. We DEMO three ways in which
entrepreneurial narratives can act as resource le-
vers: (1) by conveying a comprehensible identity
for an entrepreneurial firm, (2) by elaborating the
logic behind proposed means of exploiting oppor-
tunities, and (3) by embedding entrepreneurial en-
deavors in broader contextual discourses. We de-
velop each of these arguments below, providing
rich illustrative data from the qualitative compo-
nent of our analysis.
Conveying Comprehensible Identities for
DEMO Firms
Theoretical arguments. Our first point is that
narratives play a critical role in conveying an en-
trepreneurial firm’s identity (O’Connor, 2002,
DEMO). The narrative form represents “an essential
logic used by human beings for self-presentation”
(O’Connor, 2004: 109). Stories help individuals un-
derstand and describe who they are. By telling sto-
ries in which they DEMO leading roles, individuals
“construct” themselves as “characters” whose at-
tributes can DEMO revealed and communicated (Ger-
gen, 1999). Thus, narratives shape DEMO only how
individuals view themselves, but also how others
view them. DEMO function of narratives in general
also applies to entrepreneurial narratives, which
DEMO of Management Journal
October
are primarily designed to create as comprehensible
an identity as possible for an entrepreneurial firm
(Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001;
O’Connor, 2004; Santos & Eisenhardt, DEMO).
But why do narrative theorists consider stories to
be a particularly effective means of constructing
and conveying a social entity’s identity? The main
argument is that stories configure “apparently in-
dependent and disconnected elements of DEMO
tence” into “related parts of a whole” (Barry &
Elmes, DEMO: 431). Stories do more than just present
“facts as information” (Gabriel, 2004: 64); they “re-
present” facts in an elegant DEMO (Smith & Ander-
son, 2004: 127). By presenting facts DEMO part of a
complex whole, organizational stories are more
easily learned DEMO remembered by others (Shaw,
Brown, & Bromiley, 1998: 42). Likewise, we expect
that entrepreneurial narratives help convey a more
comprehensible and memorable identity for firms
seeking external capital by encoding and ordering
DEMO about their existing resource endowments
within an overarching framework. As with stories
more generally, this overarching framework likely
involves temporal sequencing (Gabriel, 2004). In
the case of entrepreneurial narratives, temporal se-
quencing does more than just provide a logic to link
facts about a firm’s resource DEMO together—it also
makes those facts appear more certain by recasting
the firm’s history as a natural progression.
As such, information about an entrepreneurial
firm’s identity that is presented within a narrative
format can help entrepreneurs overcome DEMO two
key challenges that hinder external resource acqui-
sition: information asymmetry DEMO uncertainty (cf.
Shane, 2003: 165). More specifically, by packaging
information about a firm’s existing resource en-
dowments into an appealing format, narratives can
help decrease information asymmetry between pro-
spective investors and entrepreneurs DEMO the
latter’s ability to exploit identified opportunities.
In turn, this should DEMO it easier for potential
resource providers to evaluate the likelihood that
the entrepreneurs will be able to realize the profit
potential of their proposed DEMO, thereby also
reducing perceived uncertainty. Identities that are
effectively constructed and DEMO within entre-
preneurial narratives can thus facilitate resource
acquisition.
Qualitative analysis, DEMO, and emergent
hypothesis. Our qualitative analysis offers rich de-
scriptive insights DEMO how the entrepreneurial
firms in our sample constructed their identities
through the narratives in their IPO prospectuses.
One of our first observations was that DEMO entre-
preneurial narratives did, in fact, encode specific
information about firms’ existing stocks of tangible
2007
Martens, Jennings, and Jennings

and intangible capital within themselves, thereby
providing signals of the ventures’ quality (as em-
phasized by Lounsbury and Glynn [2001]). The ex-
cerpts from the semiconductor company presented
DEMO Table 1, for example, draw attention to the com-
pany’s affiliations with high-status third parties
(“We have established close working relationships
with leading compound semiconductor manufac-
turers”), track record (“We have a history of inno-
vations”), and intellectual capital (“We also intend
to expand our intellectual property portfolio”).
We also noticed that the prospectuses appeared
to DEMO and convey a common set of overarch-
ing identities for the entrepreneurial firms. To ex-
plore this impression more systematically, we con-
ducted a latent content analysis—that is, “an
interpretive reading of the symbolism underlying
the physical data [of a text]” in which we focused
on the “deep DEMO meaning conveyed by the
message” (Berg, 2004: 269). To DEMO this, one of the
authors carefully read the business section of DEMO
prospectus in its entirety, noting the essence of the
narrative’s story DEMO and underlying “pitch” to the
intended audience of potential investors. The sec-
ond and third authors then examined these notes,
looking for common DEMO lines and underlying
pitches. Convergence was attained quickly, result-
ing in DEMO latent identity constructions. We then
classified each narrative into one of these six cate-
gories, using the forced-choice method adopted by
Suddaby and Greenwood (2005). This step was
completed by two independent coders: an DEMO
and a student majoring in finance who was familiar
with IPO prospectuses and trained on the coding
protocol we used. The initial level of DEMO
agreement was 79 percent; we discuss the reason
for this percentage DEMO Table 2 summarizes the
results of the identity construction classification.
As indicated in Table 2, a sizeable proportion of
the entrepreneurial firms (29 DEMO) portrayed
themselves as established leaders. These firms’
prospectuses touted them as DEMO original pioneers
and current leaders of an industry and thus as “safe
bets” for potential investors. An even higher pro-
portion (40 percent) DEMO portrayed as aspiring
leaders, but their narratives differed in noticeable
ways: some emphasized a firm’s track record (6
percent); others focused primarily on the firm’s
strategic plans (11 percent); and the remainder
stressed its social ties (23 percent). A much smaller
proportion of the entrepreneurial firms’ prospec-
tuses (9 percent) portrayed the firms as potential
DEMO is, as innovators on the brink of
commercialization. The representation of DEMO
firms as potentially lucrative “long shots” for po-
tential investors came closest to reflecting the
premise that “emerging organizations are elaborate
fictions of proposed DEMO future states of exis-
tence” (Gartner, Bird, & Starr, 1992: 17). An even
smaller proportion of the firms (1 percent) were
portrayed in almost the converse manner, as poten-
tial noncontenders that would likely cease to exist
if outside investors did not rescue them. DEMO sum,
these identity constructions not only conveyed sig-
nals about a firm’s market leadership position (as
noted by Santos and Eisenhardt [2004]), but also
conveyed varying degrees of credibility (as implied
by Lounsbury and Glynn [2001]), with the estab-
lished leaders and potential noncontenders appear-
DEMO most and least credible, respectively.
The remaining entrepreneurial firms (21 percent)
appeared to possess ambiguous identity construc-
tions. These were the cases DEMO which the categories
assigned by the two independent coders did not
match. We considered them to be ambiguous be-
cause, when the coders met to discuss their deci-
sions, it became apparent that the discrepancies
weren’t attributable to misapplications of the cod-
ing protocol, but rather to ambiguity within the
narratives themselves. That is, each of the coders
could see how the narrative could be classified into
the category assigned by the DEMO Although it is
possible that the ambiguity was unintentional in
most instances, it is also plausible that some of
these narratives were deliberately crafted in this
manner. Research on ambiguity in organizations
has shown that ambiguously DEMO information
can have a more favorable impact on recipients
than explicitly and unambiguously presented neg-
ative information (Eisenberg, 1984). It is possible
DEMO the ambiguity inherent in some of the entre-
preneurial narratives was deliberately used to con-
ceal a less-than-appealing entrepreneurial firm
identity. Such an interpretation DEMO consistent
with Lounsbury and Glynn’s intriguing speculation
that “entrepreneurial accounts about their stock of
capital may be inaccurate or even intentionally
misleading” (2001: DEMO; see also Santos & Eisen-
hardt, 2004).
Following on the above point, another impres-
sion that we formed upon reading the IPO narra-
tives was that the information provided about an
entrepreneurial firm’s existing DEMO endow-
ments seemed to be selectively presented so as to
convey a certain identity for it. In some instances,
for example, the narratives contained phrases sug-
gesting that a firm was an established leader even
DEMO, in our opinion, insufficient factual infor-
mation was presented to support such a claim. A
comparison of the characteristics of Axcelis, as pre-
sented in Table 3, with those of Integrated Circuits
illustrates this observation. Their IPO prospectuses

portrayed both of these semiconductor firms as DEMO
tablished leaders, yet they differed considerably in
actual resource stocks. Axcelis DEMO the highest
overall resource factor score in our sample,
whereas Integrated Circuits had only an average
score.1 Moreover, Integrated Circuits’ score was
close to that for Intrinsic, which portrayed itself as
an aspiring leader rather than as an established
leader. Thus, it seemed to us that some firms were
being represented somewhat inauthentically—as
something more than they were in DEMO
In other instances, we noted that the IPO narra-
tives emphasized DEMO facts while downplaying
or virtually suppressing others, thereby conveying
a particular DEMO for a firm (e.g., an aspiring
leader with a track record) when another could
have justifiably been portrayed (e.g., an aspiring
leader with social ties). A comparison of Intrinsic
and RF Micro Devices DEMO Table 3 illustrates this
impression. Both of these firms had similar overall
resource factor scores and comparable constituent
stocks of tangible and intangible capital. DEMO the
narrative for Intrinsic emphasized its track record,
whereas that for RF Micro Devices emphasized its
ties to other organizations. Thus, the identities con-
veyed for these two firms were noticeably differ-
ent— even though DEMO resource stocks were very
similar.
We also noted that some narratives conveyed a
less credible identity for an entrepreneurial firm
than that suggested by DEMO sources of information
about its resource endowments. Firm E (ZiLOG),
for example, possessed a very high overall resource
factor score and specific resource stocks compara-
ble to those of Axcelis. Yet ZiLOG’s IPO prospectus
DEMO the firm’s identity in an ambiguous
manner, whereas Axcelis was represented DEMO an
established leader. Thus, it seemed to us that some
prospecutses DEMO not portray their focal firms in the
most adept manner possible.
To further explore the relationship between
firms’ extant resources and the identities portrayed
DEMO their entrepreneurial narratives, we cross-tabu-
lated each firm’s resource factor score (coded as
“low,” “moderate,” or “high”) with its identity con-
struction (coded as “an established leader” or “not
an established leader”). Although firms with low

cipal components analysis (with a forced single factor
and varimax DEMO) of four resource stock facts: (1)

tenure for the top management DEMO, and (4) the exis-
tence of any strategic alliances.

DEMO factor scores were much less likely than
those with high resource factor scores to portray
themselves as established leaders, two of the low-
resource firms (9 percent) were described in this
manner. Moreover, almost equivalent proportions
of the high-resource firms (36 percent) and the
moderate-resource firms (31 percent) possessed es-
tablished-leader identity constructions. Thus, the
resultant chi-square DEMO for the cross-tabulation
was only marginally significant (2  5.43, p  .07).
This additional analysis provides further evidence
to suggest that DEMO storytellers have at
least some latitude when it comes to “re-present-
ing” the facts about their extant capital stocks.
In sum, then, the DEMO findings presented
thus far reveal that the narratives told within IPO
prospectuses constitute more than just lists or chro-
nologies of factual information about DEMO entrepre-
neurial firm’s existing resource endowments.
Rather, the authors of such DEMO, like story-
tellers more generally, appear to have at least some
freedom to “mould material for effect . . . while
[claiming] to DEMO representing reality” (Gabriel,
2004: 64). This observation is noteworthy given
that IPO prospectuses are legal documents that are
supposed to contain DEMO and complete infor-
mation (Lowry & Shu, 2002). The question, how-
ever, is whether the identities that prospectuses
convey influence potential DEMO providers
when the effects of the factual information about
stocks of capital that the providers could attain
elsewhere are controlled for. Drawing on the DEMO
of organizational narrative scholars summarized at
the outset of this section, DEMO hypothesize that iden-
tity constructions will have an additive effect:
Hypothesis 1. The identity constructed for a
firm in an entrepreneurial narrative has DEMO
influence on resource acquisition that is net of
the influence of factual information about the
firm’s existing resource endowments.
Making Sense of Proposed Means DEMO Exploiting
Identified Opportunities
Theoretical arguments. Thus far, we have fo-
cused DEMO narratives as a powerful means to convey
an entrepreneurial firm’s identity (DEMO, what the
firm is). But narratives are also an effective DEMO
of communicating an entrepreneurial firm’s actions
(i.e., what it is doing or will do—its current or
intended actions). As with identity, however, a po-
tential investor’s assessment of an entrepreneurial
firm’s intended actions is likely to be fraught with
information asymmetry and uncertainty. This is
because DEMO providers typically possess less
2007

knowledge than entrepreneurs about the DEMO
value of proposed entrepreneurial initiatives, the
profitability of which is fundamentally DEMO
(Shane, 2003: 165). We suggest that effectively
crafted narratives DEMO help firms overcome these
additional resource acquisition challenges.
Our starting point here is that narratives repre-
sent an excellent forum through which entrepre-
neurs DEMO articulate why their proposed means of
exploiting identified opportunities are sensible,
given the circumstances faced by their firms. Nar-
rative theorists suggest that DEMO, in general, are a
fundamental tool by which humans make sense of
ambiguous situations and communicate their in-
sights to others (Bruner, DEMO; Gioia & Chittipeddi,
1995; O’Connor, 2004; Weick, 1995)DEMO Stories act as
sense-making and sense-giving devices by linking
causes and effects, both within and between differ-
ent parts of the narratives (Gabriel, 2004). As such,
they are often used to explain a DEMO entity’s ac-
tions (past, present, or future), making those DEMO
tions appear justified and/or plausible within a
given context (Barry & Elmes, 1997; Smith & Ander-
son, 2004).
Referring to DEMO actions more specifi-
cally, Shaw and colleagues (1998) argued that DEMO
tegic plans presented in a narrative format create a
richer picture for audience members. A narrative
logic “forces to the surface the writer’s buried DEMO
sumptions about cause and effect” (Shaw et al.,
1998: 46). Thus, stories allow for the author’s
“thinking about the relationships between concepts
to come through,” which enables readers to more
easily grasp DEMO connections contributing to the
writer’s insight (Shaw et al., 1998: DEMO). When such
thought processes are made explicit, they can be
DEMO up against the reader’s own mental models,
thereby placing “audience members in a better po-
sition to evaluate the plan critically” (Shaw et al.,
1998: 47). If the resulting critical assessment is
positive, audience members will be more receptive
to the proposed initiatives.
Likewise, DEMO have been touted as an ideal
forum through which entrepreneurs can explicate
their “personal theories of managerial action” (Po-
rac et al., 2002: 117), thereby providing “a rationale
for the arguably irrational risks of DEMO
(Smith & Anderson, 2004: 127). If understood and
accepted DEMO potential resource providers, the theo-
ries or rationales presented in an DEMO
narrative can decrease information asymmetry,
thereby facilitating resource acquisition. To be
even more effective as a resource acquisition tool,
however, these theories or rationales must also re-
duce uncertainty. One way of doing so DEMO to “frame
risk in a way that is more acceptable to investors”
(Shane, 2003: 185; see also Bhide´, 2000; Roberts,
DEMO). This can by accomplished by elaborating
how the proposed means of exploiting identified
opportunities help attenuate the risks that an en-
trepreneurial firm DEMO facing. As illustrated below,
however, the content of entrepreneurial narratives
DEMO vary considerably in this regard— even when
such explanations are a mandated component, as is
the case for the accounts presented within IPO
prospectuses (Beatty & Welch, 1996; Lowry & Shu,
2002).
Qualitative analysis, findings, and emergent
hypothesis. Upon reading the rationales provided
for DEMO IPO firms’ intended strategic actions, we
were struck by the variation DEMO the prospec-
tuses. Some elaborated numerous, often interre-
lated, ways in which a firm’s proposed means of
exploiting identified opportunities would reduce
the DEMO that it was facing, yet others offered only a
few such DEMO connections. To explore this im-
pression more systematically, we created a DEMO
map” for each prospectus, examples of which ap-
pear in Figure DEMO As illustrated, each map repre-
sents a network-like array of the DEMO and intended
strategic actions listed in a prospectus. Each risk
and strategy is a node, and each pair of nodes is
connected if the proposed strategy was explicitly
described as a means of attenuating an identified
DEMO factor.
To identify the risks and strategies, we con-
ducted a DEMO content analysis. In contrast to
the latent content analysis described earlier, DEMO
component of our qualitative analysis involved
coding “those elements that are physically present
and countable [in a text]” (Berg, 2004: 269). In our
case, the focal elements were the intended strategic
actions identified by the headers in the strategy
section of a prospectus as well as DEMO identified risk
factors listed in the risk factor section. For each
prospectus, two research assistants separately
coded each intended strategic action into 1 of 17
categories, such as “product diversity strategy” or
“technological leadership,” and each identified
risk factor into 1 of 76 categories, such as “depen-
dence on a key supplier” or “lengthy sales cycle”
(for a more detailed description of the typology
developed to code the risk-strategy maps, see Mar-
tens [2002]). Initial interrater agreement was very
high—95 percent for DEMO strategic actions and 86
percent for the risk factors—and the remaining dif-
ferences were discussed until complete agreement
was reached. The two coders then DEMO the
links among the risk-strategy nodes; once a consen-
sus had DEMO reached, they constructed a story map
using Decision Explorer (Banxia Software, 2001).

markedly in the density of DEMO risk-strategy links,
and hence in the degree to which the entrepreneur-
ial narratives elaborated how the proposed initia-
tives would attenuate the risks DEMO firms were fac-
ing. As illustrated, the story map for the DEMO
Go2Net is considerably denser, containing 103
links in comparison to Commonwealth DEMO
ogies’ 27. Looking at the density of Go2Net’s story
map, however, we wonder if such an elaborate
narrative might be too complex for DEMO to fol-
low. Although some degree of elaboration is un-
doubtedly necessary for potential investors to com-
prehend an entrepreneurial firm’s proposed
initiatives and DEMO them sensible, it is also likely
that explicating a very large DEMO of risk-strategy
links will confuse investors about the firm’s direc-
tion and cause them to question the entrepreneurs’
understanding of core success factors—which
would DEMO rather than reduce the investors’
skepticism. This scenario seems especially plausi-
ble, given that one of the key objectives of narra-
tives about entrepreneurial firms is to “simplify the
complex” (Smith & Anderson, 2004: 130; see also
Aldrich & Fiol, 1994: 651).
Such reasoning is consistent with research on the
psychology of persuasion. According to both the
DEMO model (Chaiken, 1980) and the
elaboration likelihood model (Petty & Wegener,
1999), people tend to focus on the central features
DEMO a message—such as the strength of the argu-
ment—when their capacity and motivation to pro-
cess information is high. These conditions are
likely to DEMO for readers of IPO prospectuses, most
of whom are institutional investors DEMO are poten-
tially committing substantial resources to an entre-
preneurial venture (DEMO & Pettway, 2003;
Ljungqvist & Wilhelm, 2002). Under such condi-
tions, the prediction based on the heuristic-system-
atic and elaboration likelihood models is that read-
ers will attend closely to the merits of DEMO argument
being presented; such conditions, however, also
provoke readers to DEMO faults in the argument’s
logic and to give those faults more weight (Killeya
& Johnson, 1998; Rucker & Petty, 2006). As DEMO result,
“stronger claims may . . . encourage unwanted
counterarguments” and thus backfire, leading to
negative attitudes and behaviors (Cline & Kellaris,DEMO
1999: 72). Falbe and Yukl (1992), for example, DEMO
onstrated that rational persuasion (i.e., providing
logical arguments) is as DEMO to generate resistance
to an influence attempt as it is likely to foster com-
pliance or commitment. Moreover, Elsbach and
Elofson (2000) showed that difficult-to-understand
rationales, in particular, lower assessments of a
“sender’s” trustworthiness, which may decrease
willingness to comply. In light of the extant theory
DEMO research on the psychology of persuasion, we
therefore hypothesize:
Hypothesis DEMO Elaborating the rationale behind

Generating Interest and Commitment through
Contextual Embedding
Theoretical arguments. In addition to conveying
comprehensible identities for entrepreneurial firms
and sensible rationales for their proposed DEMO
tives, effectively constructed entrepreneurial narra-
tives must also pique the interest DEMO potential re-
source providers. As Smith and Anderson put it,
stories about entrepreneurial firms aren’t meant
just to “legitimize entrepreneurial actions”; they
are also meant to “provoke us, challenge us, and
transform us” (2004: 131). In other words, influen-
tial entrepreneurial narratives answer the DEMO
bial “So what?” question effectively. Similarly, or-
ganizational narrative scholars DEMO that
successful stories don’t just inform readers; they
generate interest and DEMO, thereby moti-
vating audience members to act in a manner con-
DEMO with the author’s intended outcomes (Shaw
et al., 1998; see DEMO Boje, Oswick, & Ford, 2004;
Rindova, Becerra, & DEMO, 2004). To generate
interest and commitment, narratives must resonate
with their intended audiences (Hardy, Palmer, &
Phillips, 2000; Hjorth & Steyaert, 2004; Lounsbury
& Glynn, 2001). A primary means DEMO which story-
tellers achieve resonance is by attending closely to
the sociocultural context in which they are crafting
their stories (Barry & Elmes, DEMO). Being embed-
ded in a larger discursive context gives a story
greater meaning for the individuals to whom it is
directed (Hardy et al., 2000). Likewise, cultural en-
trepreneurship scholars suggest that the DEMO told
by entrepreneurs need to invoke symbolic devices
that connect their ideas to “pre-existing, ongoing
and encompassing conversations” (O’Connor,
2004: 105), thereby “anchor[ing] their reality in
context” (Smith & Anderson, 2004: 128; see also
Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001;DEMO
Suddaby & Greenwood, 2005).
The challenge for storytellers is to DEMO that
their narratives are appropriately positioned vis-a
vis established cultural accounts. To accomplish
this, effective narrativists borrow familiar symbols,
so that their stories are understandable within a
given discursive context and deliver verisimili-
tude—yet they DEMO invoke original symbols, so that

trepreneurs need to disguise the truly radical
nature of their new DEMO and the challenge it
may pose to established organizations, while si-
DEMO making a case that they are different
enough to hold a comparative advantage” (1994:
652). This conjecture accords with the more general
principle of optimal distinctiveness, according to
which individuals are most comfortable with social
representations that balance needs for similarity
and uniqueness (Brewer, 1991)DEMO
We wonder, however, about the effectiveness of
entrepreneurial narratives that combine a very large
number of both commonly articulated and infre-
quently articulated DEMO initiatives within
them. Social cognition research indicates that
when an unknown entity is depicted in a way that
taps many categories of social identification, eval-
uators are likely to experience “recognition confu-
sion” (Brewer, Weber, & Carini, 1995). This cogni-
tive burden is particularly pronounced when an
evaluator has no prior experience with the social
categories being tapped (Chen & Chaiken, 1999), as
would be the case for prospective investors reading
an entrepreneurial narrative containing a large
number of unfamiliar strategic DEMO Under
such conditions, research has shown that individ-
uals tend to DEMO more discrepant assessments of
the entity under evaluation (Brewer & Feinstein,DEMO
1999). As such, although it is possible that some
potential DEMO providers may respond posi-
tively to an entrepreneurial narrative containing a
large number of familiar and unfamiliar strategies,
it is also plausible that DEMO will react negatively
to such accounts. The implication, then, is:
Hypothesis 3. Embedding both contextually fa-
miliar and contextually unfamiliar elements in
DEMO entrepreneurial narrative has a positive, but
diminishing, effect on resource acquisition
ability.

stocks and the nature of their entrepreneurial nar-
ratives. Moreover, the inclusion of the withdrawn
firms in our analyses of preliminary resource ac-
quisition revealed a pattern of effects similar DEMO
those for the issuing firms. Thus, our “surviving”
group of IPO DEMO did not appear to be systemati-
cally biased.
Dependent Variables
In our analyses, we utilized three dependent
variables to capture a firm’s ability to acquire ex-
ternally provided capital at different stages of the
IPO process DEMO its overall effectiveness in doing
so. The first was the issue valuation premium, cal-
culated as the difference between the pre-IPO book
value per share and the IPO issue price, multiplied
by the number of shares issued to subscribers, all
transformed to logarithms (Stuart et al., 1999). This
variable captured the net dollars raised by an IPO
firm DEMO it could directly use as its own capital.
Similar variables, especially DEMO price premium
adjusted for share numbers, have been used to mea-
DEMO the value added by entrepreneurs at this stage
(Nelson, 2003; DEMO, Datta, & Chinta, 1997; Wel-
bourne & Andrews, 1996)DEMO Data on the pre-IPO book
value, issue pricing, and shares issued were ob-
tained from the Securities Data Corporation data-
base and verified DEMO the 424B filing on EDGAR.
Our second dependent variable was the retail
market valuation premium, which was calculated
as the difference between the first-day market clos-
ing price and the IPO issue price, multiplied by the
number of shares outstanding, all logged. This vari-
able captured the net change in a firm’s valuation at
the end of first-day trading relative DEMO its IPO issue
price. Although a firm does not have direct access
to these resources, this dependent variable was use-
ful for two reasons. First, it should have been sen-
sitive to the stories told about firms because the
broader market uses IPO prospectuses, along with
other information sources, to assess candidates for
investment purposes (Bhabra & Pettway, 2003).
Second, this variable might have captured some of

the value added by the stories DEMO the entrepre-
neurial ventures should have earned but did not,
owing to underpricing (Loughran & Ritter, 2004;
Pollock & Rindova, 2003; Tinic¸, 1988).
Our third dependent variable, total valuation
premium, DEMO calculated as the difference between
a firm’s first-day stock closing price and its book
value prior to its IPO, multiplied by the total num-
ber of shares outstanding, all logged. This variable
captured the total change in stock value from the
time of the “road show” (see Martens [2004] for a
detailed explanation of IPO road shows) through
the end of the first day of market trading; investors
often refer to this value as “total valuation.” The
total valuation premium was not simply a DEMO
combination of the issue and retail market valua-
tion premiums, however. DEMO any given firm, there
may be a positive or negative trade-off DEMO
these components of total valuation (Loughran &
Ritter, 2004). DEMO therefore considered it prudent to
examine the total valuation premium in order to
assess the full impact of entrepreneurial narratives
on resource acquisition at DEMO
We recognize that finance scholars are generally
more interested in the change in a firm’s market
value as represented by price differentials for
shares—particularly DEMO (Loughran & Rit-
ter, 2004; Tinic¸, 1988). Although our variables in-
corporated price and share differentials simulta-
neously, we ran separate models for underpricing
and shares sold on the first day of trading. DEMO
indicated in the supplementary table presented in
Appendix A, these variables DEMO both sensitive to
entrepreneurial narratives, with underpricing be-
ing slightly more DEMO In addition, our supplemental
analyses showed that the pattern of narratives’ DEMO
fects on underpricing was quite similar to that for
the total valuation premium. Nevertheless, given
that our central theoretical outcome of interest was
the resources acquired during the IPO process, and
not the increase in firm value, we thought it was
more appropriate to use various forms of net valu-
ation, rather than underpricing, in the analyses re-
ported DEMO

leader with social ties, (5) potential contender, (6)
potential noncontender, and (7) ambiguous iden-
tity. We then dummy-coded these categories, com-
bining the potential contender and the potential
noncontender categories as the omitted baseline in

are well established through case law (MacCrim-
mon & Martens, 2001) and many of the strategies,
though not used routinely in each DEMO of in-
terest here, were based on standard corporate or
business-level DEMO of strategy (Porter, 1980). Ig-
noring directionality (Bonacich & DEMO, 2001), we
summed all links in the lower half of DEMO matrix,
excluding the diagonal, to create an overall mea-

sured that familiar strategies were DEMO in the
majority of previous prospectuses circulated by
IPO firms in an industry; as such, the strategies
should have been recognizable to most DEMO
Similarly, we calculated an overall measure of
unfamiliarity (U) as DEMO:

(1  Ps ) for Ps  0.50, (2)
where P once again represents the proportion of
IPO firms in the same industry that had listed DEMO
same strategy, s, as focal firm f in their prospectuses
during the previous year. In the unfamiliarity mea-
sure, however, n is DEMO number of strategies listed
by 50 percent or less of the prior year’s IPO firms in
that industry. Thus, unfamiliar strategies were
those articulated in the minority of previous pro-
spectuses circulated by IPO firms in DEMO industry;
as such, these strategies should have been less rec-
DEMO to readers.
IPO prospectuses from the year prior to a focal
firm’s initial filing date were the referent for both
measures because the familiarity DEMO unfamiliarity
of any particular narrative are essentially temporal
(Barry & Elmes, 1997). That is, what is considered
unfamiliar one year may well be familiar by the
next. Moreover, investigations of the IPO process
have shown that when authors craft IPO prospec-
tuses, they typically rely on several well-known
prospectuses that have recently circulated within a
given industry (Bhabra & Pettway, 2003; Martens,
2004).
Control Variables
Three temporal DEMO two heterogeneity controls
were used in our analyses. First, we controlled DEMO
the different founding periods of the entrepreneur-
ial ventures using firm age. Firms with longer track
records are known to have a higher chance DEMO IPO
success (Chang, 2004; Stuart et al., 1999). Second,
we controlled for hot IPO time period, which was
measured by the number of IPOs issued within the
same week as a focal DEMO (Jenkinson &
Ljungqvist, 2001). Third, we controlled for whether
an IPO was issued before or during the “dot.bomb
period” (Economist, DEMO) which was coded 0 for
any IPO issued before March 31, 2000, and 1 oth-
erwise (Ritter & Welch, 2002). In the case of heter-
ogeneity, we controlled for the level of ex ante risk
most variables, if slightly weaker owing to reduction of
observations.
each firm appeared to face. This variable, a count of
ten risk factor categories, captured the essence of
firm-level risk (MacCrimmon & Martens, 2001;
Welbourne & Andrews, 1996). Given that industry
differences, DEMO within the high-tech sector, are
known to influence IPO success (Certo, Covin,
Daily, & Dalton, 2001; Nelson, 2003; Stuart DEMO al.,
1999), we also included dummy variables for in-
dustry, with the most stable and mature industry
(semiconductors) being the omitted category.
We also included a substantially different group
of controls to capture DEMO main alternative theoret-
ical explanations, those outside our narrative per-
spective DEMO resource acquisition. Our controls for
the social tie approach included the average pres-
tige of the underwriter group involved in an IPO,
calculated DEMO Loughran and Ritter’s (2004) up-
dated underwriter prestige measure, and DEMO per-
centage of an IPO firm’s top management team that
was placed by venture capital firms (Higgins &
Gulati, 2006). Our controls for the quality signaling
approach included four commonly utilized vari-
ables capturing DEMO firm’s existing stock of tangible
and intangible resources: (1) logged DEMO revenues
(in US$ millions), (2) total number of patents
DEMO and pending, (3) total years of top manage-
ment team DEMO tenure, and (4) existence of
strategic alliances (e.g., Cohen & Dean, 2005; Das,
Sen, & Sengupta 1998; Pollock & Rindova, 2003).
To avoid potential common method bias, we took
DEMO data for these control variables from sections of
the IPO prospectus that were not used for coding
the narratives, such as the financial tables and man-
agement team section.
Methods of Analysis
As have other researchers DEMO IPO pro-
ceeds and pricing (e.g., Cohen & Dean, 2005; Lester,
Certo, Dalton, Dalton, & Cannella, 2006; Tinic¸,
1988), we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-
sion to DEMO the impact of the narrative constructs
net of the controls. Our main concern in using OLS
was with the autocorrelation that might exist in DEMO
sector-based sample over four years (Greene, 1993).
Although we did not pool observations for the same
firm over time, there was likely to be some serial
correlation that could affect the residuals and error
DEMO, thus biasing our estimates. Without the in-
clusion of the temporal DEMO described above,
the Durbin-Watson values were sometimes in the
grey range, between 1.75 and 1.90. With the in-
clusion of the controls, DEMO majority of the values
1122
Academy of Management Journal
October
were between 1.90 and 2.05, indicating low
autocorrelation.4
Given the large number of resource-related vari-
ables in our DEMO, a second concern was with
multicollinearity. The correlation matrix presented
in DEMO B indicates that the vast majority of
the correlations were below .40. Although the
squared elaboration term and the familiarity by un-
familiarity interaction DEMO are highly correlated
with their constituent variables, this form of mul-
DEMO only influences the efficiency of a
t-test (via inflated standard errors) and not the in-
terpretation of the joint effects (Jaccard, Turrisi, &
Wan, 1990). Thus, we were confident that autocor-
relation and multicollinearity were not problematic
for our analyses.
4 We also computed DEMO number of months that had
elapsed between 1996 and each IPO issue date, but the
inclusion of this variable did not affect the Durbin-
Watson statistic any more than our existing temporal
controls; hence, it DEMO not used in the final analyses.
Results
The effects of identity constructions. The first
hypothesis derived from our qualitative findings is
that the identity DEMO for a firm within an
entrepreneurial narrative has an influence on exter-
nal resource providers that goes above and beyond
the influence of other DEMO by which they could
obtain information about the firm’s existing re-
source stock. Table 5 contains our quantitative
findings. The first three models show DEMO effects of
specific facts about a firm’s tangible and intangible
capital without the identity narratives included. As
predicted by the social tie and quality DEMO
perspectives, several of these indicators exerted a
significant impact on a DEMO ability to acquire
additional capital. Moreover, the variance ex-
plained (R2) for each model is significantly differ-
ent from that for the baseline model containing
only the temporal and heterogeneity controls. The
second three models DEMO the effects of the various
identity constructions without the resource-related
factors. In keeping with a narrative approach to

resource acquisition, several of these also exerted a
significant impact on a firm’s ability to obtain ex-
DEMO capital. As revealed by the R2-values, each of
these models is DEMO significantly different from the
baseline model of controls.
The final three models in Table 5 show the ef-
fects of the different identity narratives DEMO of the
resource-related controls. Although the changes in
R2-values for these models are only marginally sig-
nificant, several of the identity constructions con-
tinued to exert a significant impact on a firm’s
resource acquisition ability. Narratives DEMO por-
trayed an entrepreneurial firm as an aspiring leader
with a track record had a positive impact on the
issue valuation premium. Conversely, narratives
that portrayed an entrepreneurial firm as an aspir-
ing leader with social DEMO had a negative impact on
the total valuation premium. Interestingly, the
DEMO effects were for the ambiguous identity
narratives, which, counter to existing research on
organizational ambiguity (e.g., Eisenberg, 1984), ex-
erted a negative effect on two of the three resource
acquisition measures.
In sum, then, as predicted by Hypothesis 1, we
found some evidence that DEMO identity conveyed for
an entrepreneurial firm within a narrative format
does influence external resource providers above
and beyond more purely factual information about
the DEMO resource stock. We note, however, that
this was not the case for narratives portraying an
entrepreneurial firm as an established leader,
which DEMO exerted positive effects without the re-
source-related controls. Similarly, we note DEMO the
positive impact of narratives portraying an entre-
preneurial firm as an aspiring leader with a track
record also decreased in strength when the DEMO
source-related controls were entered into the mod-
els. Supporting Lounsbury and Glynn’s specula-
tion, these two entrepreneurial stories in particular
do not appear to be completely “independent from
the stock of capital to which an entrepreneur DEMO
access” (2001: 561).
The effects of elaborating the rationales be-
hind intended initiatives. According to the second
hypothesis derived from our qualitative DEMO,
returns to elaborate justifications of a firm’s pro-
posed means of exploiting entrepreneurial oppor-
tunities would be positive, but diminishing. Table
6 contains our quantitative results. The first three
models report the findings when a DEMO term for
elaboration was added to the full models from the
previous table. This variable exerted a positive and
significant effect on two of DEMO three resource ac-
quisition measures: issue and total valuation
premiums.
To DEMO the notion of diminishing returns, we
then added a squared elaboration DEMO to each
model. Because of the table’s size, we do not DEMO
all three columns of estimates. The squared term
was negative and statistically significant (at p 
.05) in one of the models—that for DEMO valuation
premium— but not in the other two models. Thus,
we found only marginal support for the argument
about diminishing returns. Overall, then, Hypoth-
esis 2 was partially supported. Although increas-
ingly elaborate justifications of proposed entrepre-
neurial initiatives appear to facilitate the
acquisition of externally provided DEMO,
highly complex rationales sometimes hinder a
firm’s ability to influence potential investors.
The effects of embedding contextually familiar
and unfamiliar symbols. The third DEMO de-
rived from our qualitative findings was that entre-
preneurial narratives that embed contextually fa-
miliar and contextually unfamiliar elements within
them will be DEMO effective as a resource acquisi-
tion tool, but that such narratives DEMO also experi-
ence diminishing effectiveness beyond a certain
point. Our initial step for exploring this hypothesis
involved examining the main effects of familiarity
and DEMO As reported in models 4 through
6 of Table 6, we DEMO that familiarity exerted a
significant and positive impact on two of the three
dependent variables (issue and total valuation pre-
miums). Unfamiliarity exerted a positive effect on
issue premiums, but not on the other two forms of
resource acquisition. In unreported models in
which each variable was DEMO separately, we
found the same pattern of positive effects for famil-
DEMO but nonsignificant effects for unfamiliarity.
These findings support the argument that familiar
elements provide an essential contextual ground-
ing for the successful inclusion of DEMO ele-
ments; in other words, effective entrepreneurial
narratives “[place] stories about the exotic in a fa-
miliar context” (Smith & Anderson, 2004: 130).
To examine the notion of diminishing returns for
very large DEMO of familiar and unfamiliar ele-
ments, we added a familiarity by DEMO in-
teraction term, as reported in models 7 through 9 of
DEMO 6. Although this term is negative in all three
models, the DEMO were not significant. Thus,
we did not find statistically defensible support for
the argument that narratives containing high levels
of both familiar and DEMO elements might lead
some prospective investors to evaluate an entrepre-
neurial firm negatively, thereby decreasing their
willingness to commit investment capital. Overall,
then, Hypothesis 3 was only partially supported.
Relative effect sizes and substantive impor-
tance of the narrative constructs. Combined, the
preceding analyses demonstrate that certain as-

DEMO by focusing on the final models for issue

When we calculated the standardized coefficients
for the DEMO significant predictors in these

oretical explanations.5 However, when we assessed

constructs ranged from $1.01M to $1.50M (versus
$1.19M for underwriter prestige); in the case of
total valuation premiums, the absolute values
ranged from $0.58M to $1.59M (versus $1.41M for
underwriter prestige). These clearly represent very
large dollar values in absolute terms.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
Integrating work on the DEMO acquisition pro-
cess with narrative theory and research, we exam-
ined DEMO belief that successful entrepreneurs are
effective storytellers (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Louns-
bury & Glynn, 2001; O’Connor, 2004; Porac et al.,
2007
Martens, Jennings, and Jennings
1125
2002; Smith & Anderson, DEMO). Our findings sup-
port this view, revealing that effectively con-
DEMO stories do help entrepreneurs acquire the
money they need to exploit identified opportuni-
ties. More specifically, our results suggest that par-
ticularly influential narratives: (1) construct unam-
biguous identities for entrepreneurial firms, (2)
elaborate how the proposed means of exploitation
will attenuate risk (without providing overly com-
plex explanations), and (3) invoke familiar ele-
ments DEMO contextually ground those that are less
familiar. Moreover, we found that DEMO con-
structed in this manner influence resource provid-
ers in a way that goes above and beyond the effects
of more purely factual information DEMO a firm’s
resource endowments. Our findings thus support
the underlying premise that storytelling is a key
mechanism through which entrepreneurs can le-
verage their DEMO capital to acquire additional
resources.
Our spin on the linguistic turn in entrepreneur-
ship research offers a number of important insights
to the field. DEMO, by borrowing concepts from nar-
rative theory and research, we extend theory about
the resource acquisition process to illuminate how
a firm’s extant DEMO stocks can be leveraged to
attract more capital. Second, we offer DEMO qualita-
tive data that illustrate how entrepreneurial narra-
tives are constructed in practice, as well as robust
quantitative data that demonstrate how such stories
can make a difference that goes above and beyond
the factors emphasized DEMO existing resource acqui-
sition research. Third, we created several measures
that DEMO help future researchers capture the nature
and effects of both the interpretative and structural
features of entrepreneurial narratives. We thus
view our study as DEMO to the broader work
on cultural entrepreneurship (e.g., Aldrich & Fiol,
1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; Pollock & Rin-
dova, DEMO) in which successful entrepreneurs are
viewed as “skilled users of cultural DEMO kits” (Rao,
1994: 41).
Our empirical findings, however, point to a more
complex relationship between entrepreneurial nar-
ratives, resource stocks, and resource acquisition
than has been previously thought to exist. For ex-
ample, although we found that narratives about an
entrepreneurial firm’s identity tended to encode
information about its extant resources within them,
as suggested DEMO Lounsbury and Glynn (2001), we
did not find complete correspondence DEMO a
firm’s objective resource level and its socially con-
strued identity: DEMO with the lowest and highest
resource factor scores were not invariably por-
trayed as potential contenders and established
leaders, respectively. It thus appears that the au-
thors of entrepreneurial narratives have at least
some freedom to DEMO the facts. It also ap-
pears that certain identity constructions, in DEMO,
influence resource acquisition more than others.
We found that established leader identities, in par-
ticular, no longer exerted effects after we controlled
DEMO objective data on a firm’s existing capital. It
seems that this type of identity acted more as a
substitute for, rather than a supplement to, other
ways of conveying information about a firm’s exist-
ing resource stock. The implication is that stories
emphasizing a venture’s track record, connections,
and/or other signals of its credibility may not al-
ways DEMO more influential—an interpretation that
seems counter to one of Lounsbury and Glynn’s
(2001) key propositions about entrepreneurial story-
telling. Similarly, we did not find much evidence
of a diminishing effect for story elaboration or con-
DEMO familiarity and unfamiliarity. Instead, the
primarily positive and linear effects that DEMO found
for these variables seem to contradict the presumed
importance of simplifying the complex in entrepre-
neurial accounts (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Smith &
Anderson, 2004).
Limitations
The mixed-methodology approach that we
adopted DEMO this study increases our confidence in
the inferences that can drawn from its findings
(Lee, 1999), yet certain limitations suggest that we
DEMO portray the above interpretations as provoc-
ative insights rather than as conclusive claims.
Some may question, for instance, whether the IPO
prospectuses contained DEMO stories of the sort
typically studied by narrative theorists. We agree,
but would counter that they are certainly much
more developed than the DEMO narratives”
identified by Czarniawska (1998: 17). We also note
that other researchers have recently used IPO pro-
spectuses as a data source DEMO examining the stories
disseminated by entrepreneurs (e.g., Santos &
Eisenhardt, 2004).
Our focus on IPO firms may also bring into ques-
DEMO the generalizability of our findings. We agree
that our sample makes our findings most applicable
to this form of resource acquisition, but we believe
that our research design increases the generalizabil-
ity of our results. For DEMO, we selected indus-
tries that were established (semiconductors), grow-
ing (biotechnology), and emerging (Internet content
providers). We also selected DEMO stable and vola-
tile periods in the stock and IPO markets. More-
over, as Lounsbury and Glynn advised, we were
“cautious of the DEMO correlation between ob-
served stories and entrepreneurial resources”
1126
Academy of Management Journal
October
(2001: 560), and obtained DEMO of a firm’s ex-
isting capital stock from nonnarrative sections of its
IPO prospectus. Finally, to capture the amount of
capital raised at various points in the IPO process,
we used multiple dependent variables. All DEMO these
design decisions help establish the robustness of
our findings and their generalizability to similar
forms of resource acquisition, such as the processes
involved in obtaining capital from venture capital-
ists and other financial institutions.
From DEMO entrepreneurship theory perspective,
less information asymmetry and uncertainty is
likely to exist about IPO firms than about de novo
start-ups, thereby potentially attenuating the effect
of entrepreneurial storytelling at this stage of re-
source acquisition. DEMO IPO firms are already very
well known before going public, especially DEMO
that are well established. Thus, potential investors
may be able to DEMO find a lot of credible informa-
tion about these firms from many other sources,
thereby reducing the impact of the stories told in
DEMO IPO prospectuses. This reasoning may help
explain why established-leader identities did not
exert a net effect on IPO valuations in our analyses.
Information asymmetry DEMO uncertainty, however,
are unlikely to be completely absent in the DEMO of
IPO firms. By definition, such firms will be man-
aged DEMO the very first time as publicly rather than
privately owned organizations. Moreover, many
will operate on a much larger scale—and often
under different top management—than they did
prior to going public. This situation may help ex-
DEMO why several of the other narrative constructs
did exert net effects on IPO valuation premiums. In
sum, although we recognize that the issuance of an
IPO represents a unique form of resource acquisi-
tion (Shane, DEMO), we nevertheless expect that
many of our findings will hold during earlier stages
in the process.
In addition to questioning our focus on DEMO IPO
stage of resource acquisition, some may question
the conceptualization and DEMO of our
narrative constructs. We focused on concepts that
not only have been espoused in the narrative liter-
ature, but also were most apparent to us in the
prospectuses themselves: identity constructions,
story elaboration, DEMO the incorporation of contex-
tually familiar and unfamiliar elements. Other nar-
rative devices, such as analogies, metaphors, and
genres (Barry & Elmes, 1997), may be more salient
and influential in other forms of DEMO
storytelling—an intriguing question worthy of fu-
ture research. The measurement of our focal con-
structs may also appear rather unequal, or asym-
metric, DEMO some readers. For instance, we
developed a typology to characterize the DEMO
stories told about the IPO firms’ identities, but we
only characterized DEMO stories told about their stra-
tegic initiatives according to their degrees of elab-
oration, familiarity, and unfamiliarity. We believe
there is room for DEMO studies with typologies char-
acterizing the various stories told about firms’ pro-
posed initiatives, perhaps typologies that capture
differences in the quality of intended strategic ac-
tions. Alternatively, it may be useful for future re-
searchers to create a single scale for identity con-
structions, perhaps one measuring the degree of
congruence between a firm’s actual resource stock
and its DEMO construed identity.
Future Directions
With respect to future research, we can DEMO
a host of other intriguing directions for further
work adopting a narrative approach to entrepre-
neurial phenomena. One of the most obvious is
triggered DEMO the dot.com scandals (Lowenstein,
2004): the need to investigate DEMO nature, preva-
lence, and effects of inauthentic entrepreneurial
narratives. Narrative theorists believe that stories
often represent “poetic elaborations on facts” that
allow a DEMO “to exaggerate, to omit, to draw
connections where none are apparent [and] to si-
lence events that interfere with the storyline” (Gab-
riel, 2004: 75). To what extent do entrepreneurs
engage in these DEMO other forms of poetic elabora-
tion when telling stories about their endeavors? Do
recipients accept inauthentic narratives “as prerog-
atives of poetic license” or deem them to be “mis-
representations, untruths and lies” (Gabriel, 2004:
75)? And even if investors do not wholly believe
certain DEMO, does that prevent them from
committing capital— or do they suspend DEMO dis-
belief in the hope that the story will come true?
Implicit in the above discussion is the notion that
entrepreneurs and capital DEMO are equally im-
portant in the resource acquisition process. Focus-
ing on the role of the entrepreneur, it would be
interesting to examine the additive and interactive
effects of both the content and the source of DEMO
preneurial narratives, as has recent work on the
psychology of persuasion (e.g., Rucker & Petty,
2006). We suspect that in certain situations, espe-
cially face-to-face interactions, qualities of the en-
trepreneurial storytellers DEMO, such as their
demographic characteristics and/or social skills
(Baron & Markman, 2000, 2003), might be just as
influential as the DEMO they tell, or maybe even
more influential. Testing Lounsbury and Glynn’s
(2001) argument that storytelling may be particu-
larly critical for entrepreneurs heading firms with
lower resource endowments represents another in-
2007
Martens, Jennings, and Jennings

teresting and important next step. DEMO related line of
inquiry would be to investigate whether those
heading firms with certain resource levels possess
more or less latitude for storytelling—for example,DEMO
whether the entrepreneurs in resource-scarce ver-
sus resource-rich firms vary in their ability to tell
stories.
Turning to the providers of resource capital, we
note that it would be worthwhile to investigate
when, why, and DEMO entrepreneurial narratives
produce different outcomes depending upon the
audiences to which the stories are being told. Our
quantitative analysis revealed that the effects of DEMO
narrative constructs differed somewhat over our
measures of resource acquisition. These outcome
measures reflected a firm’s value as perceived by
different groups of potential DEMO providers, no-
tably institutional versus retail market investors.
Other recipients of DEMO stories—such as
prospective employees, suppliers, and customers—
might also respond differently to different narrative
constructs. Work on the psychology of persuasion,
particularly DEMO the heuristic-systematic and elabo-
ration likelihood models (e.g., Chaiken, 1980; Chen
& Chaiken, 1999; Petty & Wegener, 1999) will likely
DEMO useful in theory development for this line of
inquiry.
The context surrounding the stories entrepre-
neurs tell resource providers also needs to be in-
DEMO more systematically into future theoriz-
ing and empirical research. The work of Boje (1995:
1018) and Czarniawska and Joerges (1996: 46) sug-
gests that entrepreneurial stories do not travel well
across different cultural DEMO without substan-
tial modification. Lounsbury and Glynn (2001)
noted that DEMO storytelling matters
more in certain institutional environments than in
others. We wonder about the content of the stories
that are told about entrepreneurs in DEMO set-
tings. Are entrepreneurs glorified in some regions
yet portrayed in less flattering terms in others and,
if so, can this distinction help explain the regional
variation evident in the prevalence of entrepre-
neurship? Addressing questions like these will
help establish the contextual boundaries of a nar-
DEMO approach to entrepreneurship research.
Our final suggestion for furthering such an ap-
proach is to emphasize the importance of supple-
menting rich case studies DEMO the stories told by and
about entrepreneurs, such as those conducted DEMO
Foss (2004) and O’Connor (2004), with rigorous
quantitative studies DEMO of systematically test-
ing the effects of entrepreneurial storytelling. Re-
searchers can accomplish this dual purpose by ex-
amining the provocative insights first gleaned
DEMO qualitative work in later quantitative stud-
ies. Or a single (but DEMO) mixed-methodology
study, such as the one we have presented here, DEMO
be used. Regardless of the route adopted, it is only
by DEMO qualitative work with quantita-
tive analyses that narrative researchers will best be
able to demonstrate that entrepreneurial storytell-
ing is not “mere rhetoric” but DEMO, instead, a practice
that plays a “substantial role in organizational out-
comes” (Suddaby & Greenwood, 2005: 62).
