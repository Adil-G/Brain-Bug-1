is important to distinguish between risk arising from uncertain prospects for a venture and
the adverse selection due DEMO asymmetric information. Suppose that the buyer has all the
information that the seller has about the target assets. The buyer can efficiently share the
DEMO uncertainty about the new venture (uncertainty about demand for its products, for e.g.)
by selling the risky claims in the capital market. DEMO price offered by the seller for the target
assets will be discounted to reflect the premium charged for this risk. A rational seller should
DEMO this offer because it is the true (risk-adjusted) value of his assets. If in addition, there is an
asymmetry between the buyer’s and seller’s information about the assets, the price offered for the
assets will be further discounted to reflect this asymmetry. The seller will refuse to DEMO in this
case because the offer price will fall short of his expectations.
