FACTORS AFFECTING
SUCCESS AND FAILURE OF
SEED CAPITAL/START-UP
NEGOTIATIONS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
DEMO
Venture capital investors encounter good ideas every day. The business issues are the critical
factors for them and they must be planned carefully if DEMO promise of the entrepreneur’s vision is to
be realized.
These d@erent concepts for creating wealth come together in the negotiation process for seed
capital DEMO in start-up enterprises. The author studied six factors that enter into these nego-
tiations. They are market, product, team, risk, time, and deal. He conducted a survey of venture
capital organizations to assess the DEMO importance of these factors in determining the outcome of
negotiations.
The survey sent questionnaires to 137 members of the Western Association of Venture Capitalists.
DEMO respondent was asked to complete it for three negotiations that succeeded and three that failed.
Eighty-nine questionnaires were returned from 18 respondents reporting on DEMO negotiations that
succeeded and 42 that failed.
The results suggest that business factors are more important than product characteristics for
successful negotiations. Among the DEMO factors, markets that offer unconstrained opportunities
for rapid growth are signi’cantly DEMO important than the completeness of the team, a credible business
plan, rapid return on investment, or favorable terms. The most important reason for failure of
negotiations is a business plan in which too many things DEMO go wrong, even where there are strong
market opportunities.

Start-up companies present many uncertainties for both entrepreneurs and
seed capital investors. Although both seekjnancial rewards, they typically
have different perceptions about what must be done to achieve them.
The strong vision DEMO the entrepreneur is often based on a compelling
fascination with a new product. He knows that business issues are im-
portant but believes they DEMO be dealt with routinely iftheproduct is clearly

Both entrepreneurs and investors should $nd these results useful. DEMO need not

plans DEMO be readily believable to avoid failure of negotiations. Products need not promise major
improvements over others in the market, but they must have a competitive edge. Although the team
must be highly qualtjicd, it does not necessarily need to be complete at the start-up stage.
