COMPONENTS OF DEMO PERFORMANCE*
EUGENE F. FAMA4

INTRODUCTION
THIS PAPER SUGGESTS methods for evaluating investment performance. The
topic is not new. Important work has been done DEMO Sharpe [21, 22], Treynor
[23], and Jensen [13, 14]. This past work has been concerned with measuring
performance in two dimensions, return and risk. That is, how do the returns
on the portfolios examined compare with the returns on other "naively
selected" portfolios with similar DEMO of risk?
This paper suggests somewhat finer breakdowns of performance. For ex-
ample, methods are presented for distinguishing the part of an observed return
that is due to ability to pick the best securities of DEMO given level of risk
("selectivity") from the part that is due to predictions of general market price
movements ("timing"). The paper also suggests methods for measuring the
effects of foregone diversification when DEMO investment manager decides to
concentrate his holdings in what he thinks are a few "winners."
Finally, most of the available work concentrates DEMO single period evaluation
schemes. Since almost all of the relevant theoretical material can be presented
in this context, much of the analysis here is likewise concerned with the one-
period case. Eventually, however, a multiperiod DEMO that allows evaluations
both on a period-by-period and on a cumulative basis is presented.

FOUNDATIONS
The basic notion underlying the methods of performance DEMO to
be presented here is that the returns on managed portfolios can be judged
relative to those of "naively selected" portfolios with similar DEMO of risk.
For purposes of exposition, the definitions of a "naively selected" portfolio
and of "risk" are obtained from the two-parameter market equilibrium model
of Sharpe [20], Lintner [15, 16], Mossin [18] and Fama [10, 11]. But it is
-well to note that the two-parameter model just provides a convenient and some-
what familiar set of naively DEMO or "benchmark" portfolios against which

the investment performance of managed portfolios can DEMO evaluated. As indi-
cated later, other risk-return models could be used DEMO obtain benchmark port-
folios consistent with the same general methods of performance evaluation.
In the simplest one-period version of the two-parameter model, the capital
market is assumed to be perfect-that is, there are no transactions costs or
taxes, and all available information is freely available to everybody-and
investors are assumed to be risk averse expected utility maximizers who believe
that DEMO distributions for all portfolios are normal. Risk aversion and
normally distributed portfolio returns imply that the expected utility maxi-
mizing portfolio for any given DEMO is mean-standard deviation efficient.'
In addition, investors are assumed to DEMO the same views about distributions
of one-period returns on all portfolios (DEMO assumption usually called "homoge-
neous expectations"), and there is assumed to be a riskless asset f, with both
borrowing and lending available to all investors at a riskless rate of interest Rf.
It is DEMO possible to show that in a market equilibrium all efficient port-
folios are just combinations of the riskless asset f and one portfolio of DEMO
assets m, where m, called the "market portfolio," contains DEMO asset in the
market, each weighted by the ratio of its DEMO market value to the total market
value of all assets. That is, if Rm, E(Rm) and O(Rm.) are the one-period DEMO,
expected return, and standard deviation of return for the market DEMO
m, and if x is the proportion of investment funds put DEMO the riskless asset f,
then all efficient portfolios are formed according to2

Geometrically, the situation is somewhat as DEMO in Figure 1. The curve
b m d represents the boundary of the set of portfolios that only include risky
assets. But efficient portfolios DEMO along the line from Rf through m. Points
below m (that DEMO, x > 0) involve lending some funds at the riskless rate Rf
and putting the remainder in m, while points above m (DEMO is, x < 0) involve
borrowing at the riskless rate with both the borrowed funds and the initial
investment funds put into m.

the total risk in the return on the DEMO portfolio m. Since the only risky
assets held by an investor are "shares" of m, it would seem that, from a port-
DEMO viewpoint, the risk of an asset should be measured by its DEMO to
(Y(Rm). In fact this contribution is just cov(DEMO,Rm)/a(Ri,n). Specifically, if

In this light (4) is a relationship between expected return and risk which says
that the expected return on asset DEMO is the riskless rate of interest Rf plus a risk

risk, times the risk of asset j, cov(Rj,DEMO)/a(R"m.).

But (4) and (6) are expected return-risk relations derived under the as-
sumption that investors all have free access to available information and all
have the same DEMO of distributions of returns on all portfolios. In short, the
market DEMO envisaged is a rather extreme version of the "efficient markets"
DEMO in which prices at any time "fully reflect" available information. (DEMO,
for example [7].) But in the real world a portfolio DEMO may feel that he
has access to special information or he may disagree with the evaluations of
available information that are implicit in market DEMO In this case the
"homogeneous expectations" model underlying (4) provides "benchmarks"
for judging the manager's ability to make better evaluations than the market.
The benchmark or naively selected portfolios are just the DEMO of
the riskless asset f and the market portfolio m obtained with different values
of x in (1). Given the ex post or realized return Rm for the market portfolio,
for the naively selected DEMO, ex post return is just

That is, for DEMO benchmark portfolios risk and standard deviation of return
are equal. And the result is quite intuitive: In the homogeneous expectations
model these portfolios comnprise the efficient set, and for efficient portfolios
risk and return dispersion are equivalent.

That is, for the naively selected portfolios there is a linear relationship between
risk and DEMO that is of precisely the same form as (4) except that the ex-
pected returns that appear in (4) are replaced by DEMO returns in (9).
In the performance evaluation models to be DEMO, (9) provides the
benchmarks against which the returns on "managed" portfolios are judged.
These "benchmarks" are used in a sequence of successively inore complex sug-
gested performance evaluation settings. First we are concerned DEMO one-period
models in which a portfolio is chosen by an investor at the beginning of the

period, its performance is evaluated at the end of the period, and there are no
intermediate cash flows or portfolio decisions. Then we consider multiperiod
evaluation models that also allow for DEMO flows and portfolio decisions be-
tween evaluation dates. We find, though, that almost all of the important
theoretical concepts in performance evaluation can DEMO treated in a one-period
context.
III. THE
BENCHMARK
PORTFOLIOS:
SOME
EMPIRICAL
ISSUES
Before introducing the evaluation models, however, it is well to DEMO some
of the empirical issues concerning the so-called "market lines" (DEMO) and (9).
Since this paper is primarily theoretical, and DEMO empirical problems are best
solved in the context of actual applications, DEMO discussion of empirical issues
will be brief.
First of all, to DEMO (9) as a benchmark for evaluating ex post portfolio re-
turns requires estimates of the risk, P and dispersion, a(Rp), DEMO the managed
portfolios as well as an estimate of a (R1), the dispersion of the return on the
market portfolio. If performance evaluation is to be objective, it must be
possible to obtain reliable estimates of these parameters from historical data.
Fortunately, Blume's evidence [3, DEMO, 5] suggests that at least for portfolios of
ten or more DEMO, Phi and ca(Rp) seem to be fairly stationary over long
periods of time (e.g., ten years), and likewise for o(DEMO).
But other empirical evidence is less supportive. Thus throughout the analysis
here normal return distributions are assumed, though the data of Fama [6],
Blume [3], Roll [19] and others suggest that actual return distributions con-
form more closely to non-normal two-parameter stable distributions. It would
conceptually DEMO a simple matter to allow for such distributions in the evalua-
tion models (cf. Fama [11]). But since the goal here is just to suggest some
new approaches to performance evaluation, for simplicity attention will be
restricted to the normal model.
Finally, the available empirical evidence (DEMO, Friend and Blume [12],
Miller and Scholes [17], and Black, Jensen and Scholes [2]) indicates that
the average returns over time DEMO securities and portfolios deviate systematically
from the predictions of (4). DEMO the observed average return-risk rela-
tionships seem to be linear, the DEMO of risk for return (the price of risk)
is in DEMO less than would be predicted from (4) or (9). DEMO short, the evi-
dence suggests that (4) and (9) DEMO not provide the best benchmarks for the
average return-risk tradeoffs available in the market from naively selected
portfolios.
Even these results do little damage DEMO the performance evaluation models.
They indicate that other benchmark portfolios than those that lead to (9)
might be more appropriate, but given DEMO alternative "naively selected"
portfolios, the analysis could proceed in exactly the manner to be suggested.
For example, Black, Jensen and Scholes DEMO compute the risks (13's) for each
security on the New York Stock Exchange, rank these, and then form ten
portfolios, the first comprising the .iN securities with the highest risks and
the last DEMO the .iN securities with the lowest risks, where N is the

total number of securities. They find that DEMO various subperiods from
1931-65 the average monthly returns among these portfolios are highly cor-
related, and when plotted against risk the average returns on these portfolios
lie along a straight line with slope somewhat less than DEMO be implied by the
"price of risk" in (4) or (9). As benchmarks for performance evaluation
models, their empirical risk-return DEMO seem to be natural alternatives to (9).
And with these DEMO benchmarks, performance evaluation could proceed
precisely as suggested here. But again, for simplicity, we continue on with the
more familiar benchmarks given by (9).
It would be misleading, however, to leave the impression that all important
empirical problems relevant in the application of performance evaluation
DEMO have been solved. To a large extent the practical value of such models
depends on the empirical validity of the model of market equilibrium-that DEMO,
the expected return-risk relationship-from which the benchmark or "naively
selected" portfolios are derived. And though much interesting work is in
progress, it would be rash to claim that all empirical issues concerning models
of DEMO equilibrium have been settled.
For example, an important (and unsolved) DEMO issue in models of
market equilibrium is the time interval or "DEMO horizon period" over which
the hypothetical expected return-risk relationship is presumed DEMO hold. Does
the model hold continuously (instant by instant), or DEMO the market horizon
period some discrete time interval? This is an DEMO issue from the view-
point of performance evaluation since if the market horizon period is discrete,
evaluation periods should be chosen to coincide DEMO horizon periods.
The evidence of Friend and Blume [12] and that of Black, Jensen, and
Scholes [2] suggests that meaningful relationships between average DEMO
and risk can be obtained from monthly data, while the evidence DEMO Miller and
Scholes [17] indicates that this is not true for annual periods. Within these
broad bounds, however, the sensitivity of risk-return relations DEMO the time
interval chosen remains an open issue.
But unsolved empirical questions are hardly a cause for disheartenment. It
is reasonable to expect that DEMO of the empirical issues will be solved in the
process of applying the theory. And in any case, application of a theory in-
variably involves some empirical approximations. The available evidence on
performance evaluation, especially Jensen's [13, 14], suggests that the re-
quired approximations need not DEMO even more complicated evaluation
models from yielding useful results.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION IN A ONE-PERIOD MODEL
WHEN THERE ARE No INTRAPERIOD FUND FLOWS
Let DEMO and Vat+i be the total market values at t and t + 1 of the actual
(a = actual) portfolio chosen by an DEMO manager at t. With all port-
folio activity occurring at t and t + 1, that is, assuming that there are no
intraperiod DEMO flows, the one-period percentage return on the portfolio is
Ra -Vat+ DEMO Vat
Vat
Components of Investment Performance 557
One benchmark against which the return Ra DEMO the chosen portfolio can be
compared is provided by Rx(Pfa), which by definition is the return on the
combination of the riskless DEMO f and the market portfolio m that has risk P,.
equal to (ia, the risk of the chosen portfolio a. One measure DEMO the performance
of the chosen portfolio a is then
Selectivity = Ra Rx(Pa). (10)
-
That is, Selectivity measures how DEMO the chosen portfolio did relative to a
naively selected portfolio with the same level of risk.
Selectivity, or some slight variant thereof, is DEMO sole measure of performance
in the work of Sharpe [21, 22], Treynor [23] and Jensen [13, 14]. But more
detailed breakdowns of performance are possible. Thus consider
Overall
Performance Selectivity Risk
[RaRf] = [Ra-Rx(f(DEMO)1 + [Rx((a)-Rf]. (11)
That is, the DEMO Performance of the portfolio decision is the difference
between the return on the chosen portfolio and the return on the riskless
asset. The Overall DEMO is in turn split into two parts, Selectivity (as
above) DEMO Risk. The latter measures the return from the decision to take on
positive amounts of risk.4 It will be determined by the level of DEMO chosen
(the value of Pa) and, from (9), by the difference between the return on the
market portfolio, Rm, and DEMO return on the riskless asset, Rf.
These performance measures are illustrated DEMO Figure 2. The curly bracket
along the vertical axis shows Overall Performance which in this case is positive.
The breakdown of performance given by (11) can be found along the vertical
line from p,,. DEMO this example, Selectivity is positive: A portfolio was chosen
that produced a higher return than the corresponding "naively selected"
portfolio along the market line with the same level of risk. Risk is also positive,DEMO
as it is whenever a positive amount of risk is taken and the return on the
market portfolio turns out to be higher than DEMO riskless rate.
A. Selectivity: A Closer Look
If the portfolio chosen DEMO the investor's total assets, in the mean-
variance model the DEMO of the portfolio to him is measured by a (Rak), DEMO
standard deviation of its return. And the risk of the portfolio to the investor,
a(Ra), will be greater than what might DEMO be called its "market risk," f,a, as
long as the portfolio's return is less than perfectly correlated with the return
DEMO the market portfolio. To see this, note that the correlation coefficient DEMO
between Ra and Rm is
4. For greater descriptive accuracy, we DEMO, of course, say "return from risk" or even "return
DEMO bearing risk," rather than just Risk. Likewise, "return from selectivity," would be more
descriptive than Selectivity. But (hopefully) the shorter DEMO save space without much loss of
clarity.

that of the actual portfolio chosen. Thus DEMO measures the extra
portfolio return that the manager's winners have to produce in order to make
concentration of resources in them worthwhile. If DEMO Selectivity is not posi-
tive, the manager has taken on diversifiable DEMO that his winners have not
compensated for in terms of extra return.
Note that, as defined in (12), Diversification is always non-negative, so that
Net Selectivity is equal to or less than Selectivity. When DEMO R5, Diversifica-
tion measures the additional return that would just compensate DEMO investor
for the diversifiable dispersion (that is, a(Ra) - DEMO) taken on by the manager.
When R,1 < Rf (so that the market line is downward sloping), Diversification
measures the lost DEMO from taking on diversifiable dispersion rather than
choosing the naively selected portfolio with market risk and standard deviation
both equal to Pa, the market risk of the portfolio actually chosen.
The performance measures of (12) DEMO illustrated in Figure 2 along the
dashed vertical line from (Ra)DEMO In the example shown, Selectivity is positive
but Net Selectivity is DEMO Though the manager chose a portfolio that
outperformed the naively selected portfolio with the same level of market risk,
his Selectivity was not DEMO to make up for the avoidable risk taken, so
that Net DEMO was negative.
The breakdown of Selectivity given by (12) is the only one that is con-
sidered here. The rest of Section IV DEMO concerned with successively closer
examinations of the other ingredient of Overall Performance, Risk. Before
moving on, though, we should note that (12) itself is only relevant when di-
versification is a goal of the DEMO And this is the case only when the
portfolio being evaluated constitutes the investor's entire holdings, and the
investor is risk averse. For example, an investor might allocate his funds to
many managers, encouraging DEMO only to try to pick winners, with the investor
himself carrying DEMO whatever diversification he desires on personal account.
In this case Selectivity is the relevant measure of the managers' performance,
and the breakdown of Selectivity of (12) is of no concern.
B. Risk: A Closer
Look
If the investor has a target risk level PT for his DEMO, the part of
Overall Performance due to Risk can be allocated DEMO the investor and to the
portfolio manager as follows:
Risk

RX(PT) is the return on the naively selected DEMO with the target level of
market risk. Thus Manager's Risk is that part of Overall Performance and of
Risk that is due to DEMO manager's decision to take on a level of risk Pa different
from the investor's target level PT, while Investor's Risk is that part of Overall
Performance that results from the fact that the DEMO's target level of risk
is positive. These performance measures are illustrated in Figure 2 along the
dashed vertical line from PT.

Manager's Risk might in part result DEMO a timing decision. That is, in part
at least the manager DEMO have chosen a portfolio with a level of risk higher
or lower than the target level because he felt risky portfolios in general would
DEMO abnormally well or abnormally poorly during the period under consider-
ation. But if an estimate of E(Rm.) is available, a more precise DEMO of the
results of such a timing decision can be obtained, DEMO, making use of
the ex ante market line of (4)7 we can subdivide Risk as follows:
Manager's
The first three DEMO here sum to the Manager's Risk of (13). Manager'DEMO
Expected Risk is the incremental expected return from the managers decision
to take on a nontarget level of risk. Market Conditions is the difference DEMO
tween the return on the naively selected portfolio with the target level of risk
and the expected return of this portfolio. It answers the DEMO: By how
much did the market deviate from expectations at the DEMO level of risk?
Total Timing is the difference between the ex post return on the naively
selected portfolio with risk (3n and the ex ante expected return. It is positive
when Rm > E(Rm) (and then more positive the larger the value of Ps), and it
is negative when R.1 < E(R1.) (and then more DEMO the larger the value
of PIn). The difference between Total Timing and Market Conditions is Man-
ager's Timing: it measures the excess of Total Timing over timing performance
that could have been generated by DEMO the naively selected portfolio with
the target level of risk. Manager's Timing is only positive when the sign of
the difference between Pa DEMO P( is the same as the sign of the difference
between DEMO E(Rn1), that is, when the chosen level of market DEMO is above
6. E(,11) might be estimated from past average returns on the market portfolio m. Alternatively,
past data might be DEMO to estimate the average difference between Rm and Rf. In any case, it
should become clear that the expected values used must be naive or mechanical estimates (or at least
somehow external to those being evaluated), otherwise the value of the timing measures is
destroyed.
Admittedly, given the current status of empirical work on the behavior through time of DEMO
returns on risky assets, we can at most sepeculate about the DEMO way to estimate E(Rm). Hopefully
empirical work now in progress will give more meaningful guidelines. And perhaps the development
of theoretical methods DEMO performance evaluation will itself stimulate better empirical work on
estimation procedures. In any case, the discussion in the text should help to emphasize that one
cannot obtain precise measures of returns from timing decisions without mechanical DEMO naive
estimates of equilibrium expected returns.

more sensitive than Total Timing as a measure of the results of a timing
decision.
DEMO target level of risk will not always be relevant in evaluating a manager's
performance. For example, an investor may allocate his funds to many man-
agers, with the intention that each concentrates on selectivity and/or timing,
with the investor using borrowing or lending on personal DEMO to attain his
desired level of market risk.
If a target level of risk is not relevant but the expected value or ex ante
DEMO line is still available, a breakdown of Risk similar to (14) can be ob-
tained by treating the market portfolio (or the DEMO proxy)8 as the
target portfolio. That is,

The idea here is that even in the absence of a target level of risk, the measure
of Manager's Timing must be standardized for the deviation of the market
return from the expected market DEMO, that is, for the "average" spread
between the ex post and ex ante market lines.
Finally, the goal of this paper is mainly to suggest some ways in which
available theoretical and empirical results DEMO portfolio and asset pricing models
can provide the basis of useful procedures for performance evaluation. But
the various breakdowns of performance suggested above are DEMO unique..
Indeed any breakdown chosen should be tailored to the situation at hand. For
example, if a target level of risk is relevant but the subdivision of Risk given
by (14) is regarded as too DEMO, then the approximate effects of the
timing decision might still be DEMO out as follows:

V. COMPONENTS OF PERFORMANCE: MULTIPERIOD MODELS
WITH INTRAPERIOD DEMO FLOWS
In the one-period evaluation model presented above, (i) the DEMO at which
performance is evaluated is assumed to correspond to the portfolio horizon
date, that is, the time when portfolio funds are withdrawn DEMO consumption;
and (ii) there are assumed to be no portfolio transactions or inflows and out-
flows of funds between the initial investment DEMO withdrawal dates, so that
there is no reinvestment problem. If in DEMO multiperiod context we are likewise
willing to assume that: (i) DEMO there are many of them, evaluation dates
nevertheless correspond to the DEMO when some funds are withdrawn for con-
sumption, and (ii) DEMO reinvestment decisions and other portfolio transactions
are also made at these same points in time, then generalization of the one-
period model to the multiperiod case is straightforward.9 Indeed the basic
procedure could be period-by-period application DEMO the performance measures
presented in the one-period model. The major embellishments would not be in
the nature of new theory, but rather would arise from the fact that multiperiod
performance histories allow statistically more reliable estimates DEMO the various
one-period performance measures.
But this pure case is unlikely to be met in any real world application. Often
performance evaluation would be DEMO out by someone with little or no
knowledge of the dates when funds are needed for consumption by the owner
of the portfolio, and often (e.g., in the case of a mutual fund or a DEMO
fund) the portfolio is owned by many different investors with different DEMO
sumption dates. As a result evaluation dates, withdrawal dates, and reinvest-
ment dates do not usually coincide.
The rest of this paper is DEMO with how the concepts of the one-period
model must be adjusted to deal with such intraevaluation period (or more
simply, intraperiod) fund flows. The procedure is to first present detailed
definitions of variables of interest DEMO models involving intraperiod fund flows,
and then to talk about actual measures of performance. And it is well to keep
in mind that DEMO the analysis is carried out in a multiperiod context, the
problems DEMO be dealt with arise from intraperiod fund flows. With such fund
flows, the same problems would arise in a one-period evaluation model.

dates. That is, there can be intraperiod inflows in the form of either cash
receipts (dividends, interest) on existing portfolio holdings or net new con-
tributions of capital by new DEMO existing owners. And there can be intraperiod
outflows in the form of dividend payments to the portfolio's owner(s) (e.g., a
mutual fund declares dividends) or withdrawals of capital (e.g., by a mutual
fund's shareholders).
In simplest terms, the major problem with intraperiod cash flows is obtain-
ing a measure of the return on the DEMO of period market value of a
portfolio that abstracts from the effects of intraperiod new contributions and
withdrawals on the end of period value DEMO the portfolio. One approach is what
might be called the mutual fund method. Specifically, when performance
evaluation is first contemplated, the market value DEMO the portfolio is subdivided
into "shares." Subsequently, whenever there are DEMO of new capital
or withdrawals of capital from the portfolio, the DEMO market value of a
share is computed and the number of shares outstanding is adjusted to reflect
the effects of the cash flow.10
Thus DEMO evaluation dates correspond to integer values of t and define
V'a,t = actual market value of the portfolio at time t. It DEMO includes the
effects of investment of new capital or reinvestment of any cash in-
come received on securities held in the portfolio, and it is net of
any dividends paid out to owners or other withdrawals DEMO funds prior
to t.
Va,t market value the portfolio would have had at t if no dividends were
paid out to owners since DEMO previous evaluation date. In computing
Va,t it is simply assumed that dividends paid to the portfolio's owners
were instead reinvested in the DEMO portfolio. At the beginning of
each evaluation period, however, Va,t is set equal to V',,t.
nt= number of shares outstanding DEMO the portfolio at t. As indicated
above, this is adjusted when DEMO capital comes into the portfolio
and when capital is withdrawn, but DEMO is unaffected by reinvestment
of cash income received on securities held or by dividends paid to
the portfolio's owners.
P'a,t V'DEMO,t/nt actual market value at t of a share in the portfolio.
Pa,t = Va,t/nt = value of a share DEMO t under the assumption that dividends
paid to owners of the portfolio were instead reinvested in the entire
portfolio.
Ra,t= (Pa,t Pa,t_-)/pa,t_-. Assuming t corresponds to an evaluation
date, this DEMO the one-period return on a share with reinvestment of
all dividends paid on a share since the last evaluation date.
Ra,t is an DEMO measure of the return from t - 1 to t on a dollar
invested in the portfolio at t - 1. This is not DEMO say, however, that it is un-
affected by intraperiod fund flows. Such fund flows are usually associated with
redistributions of portfolio holdings across DEMO and these affect the
10. This is in fact the method of accounting used by open end mutual funds. It is also closely
related DEMO the "time-weighted rate of return" approach developed by Professor Lawrence Fisher.

return on a share. Moreover, Ra t as defined above is not the only unambiguous
measure of the return DEMO t - 1 to t on funds invested in the portfolio at
t - 1. For example, one could define Rat = (P'DEMO,t + dt - P'a,t-i)/P'a,t-1,
DEMO dt is the dividend per share paid during the evaluation period to the
portfolio's owners. The more complicated definition, that is, with DEMO
assumed to be reinvested, is '(purer" (especially for the DEMO of inter-
portfolio comparisons of performance) in the sense that funds DEMO at the
beginning of a period remain invested for the entire period, but it is less pure
in the sense that it assumes a reinvestment policy not actually followed in the
portfolio.
The next step is DEMO define prices per share for the benchmark or naively
selected portfolios that also take account of intraperiod fund flows.
Pxt(PT) = price at t per share of the naively selected portfolio with the
target risk DEMO To avoid double-counting of past performance,
at the beginning of any evaluation period (for example, just after
an evaluation takes place at DEMO - 1) this price is set equal to the
price per DEMO of the actual portfolio. Then this amount is in-
vested in the naively selected portfolio with the target risk level,
and the behavior DEMO the market value of this portfolio during the
evaluation period determines the end-of-period price per share,
Pxt(PT). Any intraperiod cash income DEMO by the securities
of this naively selected portfolio is assumed to be reinvested in
this portfolio.
These conventions for the treatment of beginning-of-period values DEMO intra-
period cash income will be taken to apply in the definitions of all the benchmark
portfolios. Thus
pt(Rf) =price at t per share of the naively selected portfolio obtained by
investing all funds available DEMO t - 1 in the riskless asset.
The benchmarks provided by Pxt(PT) and pt(Rf) are unaffected by intra-
period fund flows DEMO the actual portfolio. This is not true of the following
two benchmarks.
Pxt(Pa) = price at t per share of the naively selected portfolio with
market risk equal to that of the actual portfolio. At DEMO
beginning of any evaluation period and after any transaction
in the actual portfolio during an evaluation period (that is,
after any cash flow or exchange of shares in the actual port-
folio) the market risk of the actual portfolio is measured, and
the current price per share of this benchmark is shifted into
the naively selected portfolio with that DEMO of market risk.
Thus the value of 15a could be shifting more or less contin-
uously through time as a result of inflows and DEMO of
funds and decisions to shift the holdings in the portfolio.'
11. Indeed even if there are no transactions taking place, the value of Oa shifts continuously
through time as a result of shifts in DEMO relative market values of individual securities in the
portfolio. Aside from adjusting the value of D1a at the beginning of each evaluation period, we have
chosen to ignore the effects of such "non-discretionary" shifts here.

Pxt(O(Ra)) =price at t DEMO share of the naively selected portfolio with re-
turn dispersion equal to that of the actual portfolio. The
definition of Pxt('(R,)) is obtained by substituting O(Ra) for
Pa, in the definition DEMO P.;t(Pa) above.
Thus p.t(f3) and pt(o(A)) take account of changes in P.,, and o(ia) that
result from intraperiod fund flows and portfolio shifts. Computationally, keep-
ing tract of and o(Ra) in the way required for these benchmarks is not a
difficult problem. At any point in time the market risk (3n of the chosen port-
folio is just the weighted average of DEMO market risks of the individual assets
in the portfolio, where the DEMO are the proportions of total portfolio market
value represented by each asset. Thus if one has estimates of the market risks
of the assets DEMO which portfolios are chosen, the value of P,, is updated DEMO
combining these with current measures of the weights of individual assets in
the chosen portfolio. And a similar procedure can be followed with respect DEMO
updating values of a (Rp) 12
B. Multiperiod Measures of Performance
Given the beginning and end-of-period prices per share for these benchmark
portfolios, their one-period returns are obtained in the usual way. Then the
performance DEMO of a portfolio can be built up (for example) through
period-by-period application of the breakdowns given by (11)- (13). Alterna-
DEMO, one can define performance measures in terms of profit per share DEMO
than return. Thus, in line with (13) and using end DEMO evaluation period prices,
define

This type of breakdown can of course be computed both period-by-period and
cumulatively. And from such multiperiod histories DEMO can get more reliable
measures of a portfolio manager's true abilities than can be obtained from a
one-period analysis. For example, one can determine whether his Selectivity
is systematically positive or simply randomly positive in DEMO periods.
For some purposes one may wish to compare the multiperiod performance
histories of different portfolios. For example, an investment company may
be interested in the relative abilities of its different security analysts and
portfolio managers. DEMO an investor who has allocated his funds to more than
one manager may be interested in comparing their performances. On a period-
by-period basis DEMO performance comparisons can be carried out in terms of
percentage returns. Alternatively, if the prices of shares in different portfolios

are set equal at the beginning of DEMO periods, profit-based performance
measures such as (18) could be computed DEMO on a period-by-period basis
and cumulatively.
One must not get the impression, however, that all the problems caused by
intraperiod fund flows have DEMO solved. Though the performance of a "share"
during any given DEMO period (or across many periods) gives an un-
ambiguous picture of the investment history of funds invested in a given
portfolio at a DEMO point in time, comparisons of the performances of shares
in different DEMO are not completely unambiguous. This is due to the fact
that even when things are done on a per share basis, intraperiod fund flows
necessitate portfolio decisions that usually have some effect on the performance
of DEMO share. And when such fund flows occur at different times (and DEMO
during different market conditions) in different portfolios, the observed per-
formances of shares in the portfolios may differ, even if the portfolios are
managed by the same person trying to follow the same policies in DEMO of his
portfolio decisions. But though such ambiguities seem unavoidable and to
some extent unsolvable, their effects on performance comparisons should be
minor except in cases where portfolios experience large cash flows (relative to
their total market values) in short periods of time and/or when evaluation
periods are long.
Finally, if an ex ante market line is available to compute expected values
through time for the three benchmarks, pxt(P5), Pxt(Pa) and p.t(O(Ra)), then
the one-period performance DEMO of (14)-(17) can be carried out
either in terms of returns or market values, and these can be used as the basis
of even more detailed multiperiod performance histories.
But we terminate the DEMO at this point. We do this not because of a
lack of additional interesting problems, but because in the absence of actual
applications, DEMO solutions become increasingly speculative and thus of
less likely usefulness.
VI. SUMMARY
Some rather detailed methods for evaluating portfolio performance have
been suggested, and some of the more important problems that would arise in
implementing these DEMO have also been discussed. In general terms, we
have suggested that DEMO return on a portfolio can be subdivided into two parts:
the return from security selection (Selectivity) and the return from bearing
risk (Risk). Various finer subdivisions of both Selectivity and Risk have also
DEMO presented.
To a large extent the suggested models can be viewed as attempts to com-
bine concepts from modern theories of portfolio selection and DEMO market
equilibrium with more traditional concepts of what constitutes good portfolio
management.
For example, the return from Selectivity is defined as the difference be-
tween the return on the managed portfolio and the return on a DEMO selected
portfolio with the same level of market risk. Both the measure of risk and the
definition of a naively selected portfolio are obtained DEMO modern capital
market theory, but the goal of the performance measure DEMO is just to test
how good the portfolio manager is at security analysis. That is, does he show
Components of Investment Performance

any ability to uncover information about individual DEMO that is not
already implicit in their prices?
Likewise, traditional DEMO of portfolio management distinguish be-
tween security analysis and market analysis, DEMO latter being prediction of
general market price movements rather than just prediction of the special
factors in the returns on individual securities. The various DEMO measures
suggested in this paper provide estimates of the returns obtained from such
attempts to predict the market. And modern capital market theory again
DEMO a critical role in defining these estimates.
