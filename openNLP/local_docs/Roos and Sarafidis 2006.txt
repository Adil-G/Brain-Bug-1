Abstract
We analyse the choices of DEMO contestants in the Australian version of the television
game show Deal or no Deal. We calculate risk-aversion bounds for each contes-
tant, revealing considerable heterogeneity. We then estimate a structural stochastic
choice model that captures the DEMO decision problem faced by contestants. To
address individual heterogeneity, we nest DEMO dynamic problem within the settings
of both a random eﬀects and a random coeﬃcients probit model. Our structural
model produces plausible estimates of risk DEMO, conﬁrms the role of individual
heterogeneity and suggests that a model DEMO stochastic choice is indeed appropriate.
We also examine generalisations to expected utility theory, ﬁnding that the rank
dependent utility model provides substantially improved explanatory power and in-
dicates optimism. Finally, we do not ﬁnd strong evidence in favour of an endowment
eﬀect for lotteries.

1 Introduction
Typically game shows are designed by television producers and not DEMO However,
with the game show Deal or no Deal, one DEMO almost suspect an experimental economist
interested in attitudes towards risk had dabbled in a bit of producing. Deal or no Deal has
several distinctive DEMO that make it particularly attractive to a researcher. First, the
stakes DEMO high. In the Australian version of the show, the average contestant DEMO away
with $15 000 (in Australian dollars) and there is a signiﬁcant probability (about 15%)
that she can win an amount in excess of the Australian average annual income (currently
at $41 880). Second, there is no skill involved; a contestant’s choice is contingent DEMO
on her preferences for lotteries, not on any perception she may DEMO about her skill,
as is the case in the ﬁnal round of Jeopardy!, for example. Third, there are no strategic
considerations; the contestant faces a series of decision problems under risk. Fourth, there
is substantial variation in the attractiveness of the lotteries faced by contestants. This
DEMO useful variation with which to identify individual attitudes towards risk. In this
paper, we exploit a self-collected data set of 399 contestants on the Australian version of
the game show Deal or no Deal to examine DEMO towards risk.
We set out with three broad goals in mind. First, we characterise the extent and
heterogeneity of risk-aversion in our sample. Our focus here is descriptive, and to this
end we presume that contestants are expected utility maximisers and we employ the well
understood metrics of DEMO absolute and relative risk aversion. Second, we challenge
the expected utility DEMO and we ask whether the rank dependent utility functional
can better ﬁt the data. Third, we seek for violations of rational choice theory that go
beyond the issue of which utility functional contestants use. Let us DEMO brieﬂy each
of these goals in turn.
Our ﬁrst goal is to describe the degree of risk aversion exhibited by contestants. In
many applications, we are interested in the attitudes towards risk of many heterogeneous
individuals. DEMO, the mean is not a suﬃcient statistic for the aggregation of DEMO
heterogeneous preferences. Therefore, the researcher might generally be interested in the
DEMO of preferences across individuals. Further, as Hey and Orme (1994) DEMO, the
literature has focussed on deterministic models of choice as a DEMO for describing behaviour.
However, people often have diﬃculty arriving at decisions, or even “change their mind”
or make mistakes, suggesting that we may observe heterogeneity in the decisions made by
the same individual. A deterministic DEMO of choice does not permit such variation. To
ascertain the importance of this issue, we exploit a panel data set of 2834 decisions made
by 399 contestants to examine the dispersion of preferences both between contestants,DEMO
and between decisions made by the same contestant.
We adopt two empirical approaches. First, we solve the contestant’s problem to pro-
duce bounds on risk aversion for individual contestants. This reveals substantial dispersion
in the extent DEMO risk aversion between contestants. A stochastic choice model introduces
noise, permitting DEMO individual’s preferences to vary over time. Our second empirical
approach employs a stochastic choice model to estimate the average level of risk aversion,
DEMO dispersion between individuals, and its dispersion across decisions made by the DEMO
individual. Our empirical strategy is designed to compare these three quantities. We nest
the contestant’s decision problem within both a random eﬀects and a DEMO coeﬃcients
2
probit model. The random coeﬃcients speciﬁcation enables direct comparison of mean
preferences DEMO the extent of heterogeneity between contestants. The random eﬀects
speciﬁcation enables direct comparison of heterogeneity between contestants and hetero-
geneity between decisions made by DEMO same contestant. Our estimates suggest moderate
risk aversion, and imply that DEMO standard deviation of our risk-aversion parameter is of
a similar magnitude to the mean, indicating substantial dispersion between contestants.
Moreover, we demonstrate a DEMO level of heterogeneity between decisions made by the
same contestant. This suggests to us that considerable attention to the stochastic element
of choice is DEMO
Our second goal is to challenge the expected utility hypothesis. While there are many
known violations of EU theory, its continued prevalence relates to its parsimony, ease of
application, and intuitive appeal. Of the many DEMO to expected utility theory, we
examine the rank dependent utility (RDU) functional (due to Quiggin (1982)) partially
because it shares these traits. Under EU theory, the value of a lottery is simply the
weighted average of the utility of all the possible outcomes, where the decision weights are
the objective probabilities of the outcomes. Under the RDU DEMO, the value of a lottery
is again the weighted average utility DEMO the outcomes, but decision weights depend not only
on the objective DEMO of an outcome, but also on its preference rank ordering. That
DEMO rank dependent model nests expected utility theory also allows us to test statistically
between them. From our own selﬁsh perspective, the rank dependent model is also a
simple model to estimate parametrically. While this is particularly DEMO given the
computational burden of our dynamic problem, this is also DEMO important consideration
for most applications.
We employ our structural stochastic choice model to investigate this issue. Because
the RDU model nests EU, it necessarily outperforms EU. However, we ﬁnd that, for
all speciﬁcations considered, the EU model is overwhelmingly rejected by the data. To
provide an indication DEMO the strength of this result, the rejection of EU in favour DEMO RDU
is of a similar magnitude to the rejection of a model of risk-neutrality in favour of EU.
Our results imply a concave cumulative DEMO weighting function, suggesting that
contestants overweight more favourable outcomes, or are “optimistic”. We also examine
the relative performance of Yaari’s dual theory, a special case of the rank dependent
utility model. We ﬁnd that it DEMO outperforms the most elementary model of risk
neutrality.
Our ﬁnal goal is to investigate whether there are violations of rational choice theory
that go DEMO the issue of which utility functional contestants use. To this end, DEMO
exploit an idiosyncratic feature of the Australian version of Deal or no Deal to test for
an endowment eﬀect for lotteries. A unique feature DEMO the Australian version of the show
is an additional round of play (Chance/Supercase round) that may be introduced at the
Producers’ discretion (and at the contestant’s surprise) when the contestant thinks that
the game has ended. In this additional round, the host tempts the contestant to forgo her
winnings and play (or buy ) instead a lottery. This contrasts with what goes on during the
regular rounds of play, where the host tempts the contestant to forgo (or sell ) a lottery
in lieu of a sure gain. We test the hypothesis that contestants DEMO pronounced risk-
aversion in the Chance/Supercase round, relative to their DEMO in the regular rounds
of play. This type of behaviour would imply, if it were to be true, that the contestants’
3
“selling price” is higher than their “buying price”. This anomaly has been DEMO
in the empirical literature and is referred to as the endowment eﬀect. While a handful of
contestants do conform to this anomaly, we ﬁnd that the “average” contestant does not
exhibit an endowment eﬀect.
1.1 Related DEMO
Recognised as ideal natural experiments, television game shows have been the DEMO of
numerous empirical studies. Gertner (1993) analysed contestants’ decisions in the game
showCard Sharks. He estimated the coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion (CARA) for
expected utility maximisers and reported evidence in favour of the notion that contestants
segregate risky decisions. Metrick (1995) studied contestants’ choices in DEMO ﬁnal round of
Jeopardy! (FJ, for ﬁnal jeopardy). He estimates a coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion that
is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from DEMO, and hence the null hypothesis of risk neutrality
can not be DEMO Beetsma and Schotman (2001) estimate risk-attitudes in the Dutch
show Lingo, ﬁnding that contestants are risk-averse.
Perhaps the closest predecessor to our work is the study of Hoosier Millionaire from
Fullenkamp, Tenorio and Battalio (DEMO). As in Deal or no Deal, there is no skill DEMO,
the stakes are high and contestants tend to be more representative of the general popu-
lation. In contrast, in Card Sharks the stakes are lower and the game involves non-trivial
probability calculations; in FJ skill (and players’ perception of their skill) is crucial and
contestants are DEMO more educated (hence, more likely to be wealthier, hence less DEMO
averse) than the “average Joe”; in Lingo the stakes are lower and perception of own skill
is important. Fullenkamp et al. (2003) DEMO coeﬃcients of risk aversion that imply
pronounced risk aversion for high-stakes lotteries. They also emphasise, however, that
the same estimates imply near risk DEMO for small-stakes lotteries, and they relate
this point to a critique DEMO expected utility theory put forward by Rabin (2000).
The Price DEMO Right, another popular game show, has been the subject of Bennett and
Hickman (1993), Berk, Hughson and Vandezande (1996), Tenorio and Cason (2002) and
Healy and Noussair (2004). Rather than studying decision making under risk, The Price
is Right provides the opportunity to study rational choice. The same is true of the second
part DEMO Metrick (1995).
Given the ideal setting presented by Deal or DEMO Deal and its recent international
proliferation, it is natural that others DEMO also shown an interest in the show. We are
now aware of several working papers harnessing variants of this game show. The most
closely DEMO to our own work is an examination of behaviour in the Italian version of
the show by Bombardini and Trebbi (2005). They employ a structural model to estimate
average risk-aversion and contestant heterogeneity, and they relate contestant hetero-
geneity to some observable characteristics of participants. They depart DEMO our work
by adopting a deterministic choice setting, and because the DEMO version of the show
is complicated by a strategic consideration; the DEMO can extract information about
her briefcase from the bank oﬀer she receives. The remainder of the literature focusses
attention on variants of the bounds DEMO that we adopt. Post, Baltussen and van den
Assem (2006), analyse data from 84 contestants from Belgium, Germany, and the Nether-
DEMO, relating risk-aversion bounds to observable characteristics of the contestants and
4
the contestant’s fortunes thus far. Mulino, Scheelings, Brooks and Faﬀ (2006) estimate
risk-aversion bounds and obtain estimates of average risk aversion in a static formulation
of the problem. Deck, Lee and Reyes (2006) use data from the Mexican version of the show
to place bounds on DEMO of risk aversion. Mulino et al. also employ a probit model
to examine the eﬀect of observable characteristics on contestant decisions and examine
the DEMO rounds of the show for evidence in support of prospect theory. Blavatskyy and
Pogrebna (2006) exploit a unique feature of the Italian version DEMO the show (the fact that
contestants are sometimes given the choice DEMO switch briefcases) to test for loss aversion,
one of the DEMO tenets of prospect theory. This feature is not present in the Australian
version that we analyse.
Turning to the experimental literature, our stochastic choice model and the testing of
expected utility versus the rank dependent utility DEMO is in the spirit of Hey and
Orme (1994). The DEMO for the theory that best describes decision making under risk is
described in Machina (1987) and Starmer (2000).
Finally, with regards DEMO the endowment eﬀect, the term was coined by Thaler (1980),DEMO
who found that the willingness to pay to eliminate a 0.001 existing risk of sudden death
is signiﬁcantly lower than the minimal amount one DEMO demand to accept an identical
risk. See also Kahneman, Knetch and DEMO (1991) for its relation to loss aversion and
the status quo bias.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 DEMO the game and the
data. Section 3 describes the dynamic problem faced by the contestant and presents an
empirical model of a component of DEMO problem, the “bank” oﬀer function. In section 4 we
calculate upper DEMO lower bounds for the coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion for individual
contestants, under the assumption that contestants are expected utility maximisers, and
investigate DEMO possibility of an endowment eﬀect for individual contestants. In section 5
we estimate a structural model, retaining the expected utility assumption, and revisit DEMO
issue of an endowment eﬀect. In section 6 we explore whether the rank dependent utility
functional can better explain the data. We conclude in DEMO 7.
2 The game show and the data
The Australian version of Deal or no Deal comprises three stages. Our attention focuses
on the DEMO stage. In the ﬁrst stage, 26 potential contestants are selected at DEMO from
an initial pool of 150 contestants. In the second stage, DEMO contestant is selected to play
the main game, based on speed DEMO accuracy in answering three multiple-choice trivia
questions.1
In the ﬁnal stage of the game, the contestant selects one of 26 briefcases. Each briefcase
contains one of 26 possible monetary prizes, ranging from $0.5 to $200 000, with equal
probability (with an expected value of $19 112.25 in DEMO dollars).2 The contestant
1We do not believe that contestants are selected based on skill or intelligence at this stage. Questions
asked usually relate DEMO purely trivial matters. If there is a tie for the greatest number of correct answers,
the contestant with the fastest response to the DEMO question is selected. Further details are contained in
appendix A, the DEMO producers’ manual.
2In approximately half of the shows in our sample, DEMO of the briefcases contains, instead of a monetary
5
does not know the contents of her briefcase. The game then proceeds DEMO at most nine
rounds.
In round 1 the contestant opens six of the remaining 25 briefcases, revealing the mon-
etary prize contained inside, DEMO thereby altering her probability distribution of the prize
contained in her own briefcase. With 20 briefcases left (including the contestant’s chosen
briefcase), the Bank makes (through the host of the show) an oﬀer to DEMO contestant,
referred to as the bank oﬀer, that the contestant DEMO accept or reject - Deal or no Deal.
If the contestant accepts the oﬀer, the game ends and the contestant walks away with the
amount she accepted.3 If the contestant rejects the oﬀer, the game proceeds to round 2,
where the contestant can open ﬁve more of DEMO remaining 20 briefcases. With 15 brief-
cases left, the Bank makes DEMO new oﬀer that the contestant can accept or reject - Deal or
no Deal. If the contestant rejects, then in the following round she can open four more
briefcases. This pattern continues until there are six DEMO left. From then onwards,
in each round the contestant only opens one briefcase. After each briefcase opening, the
contestant receives a bank oﬀer, as before. When there are just two briefcases left, the
contestant DEMO the ﬁnal bank oﬀer. If she rejects that oﬀer, the game DEMO and the
contestant walks away with the amount in her briefcase.
In addition, there are two special features. In some games, after the DEMO has
accepted a bank oﬀer, the host will give the contestant DEMO option to re-consider the oﬀer
she accepted. This may be in the form of a Chance or a Supercase feature. In the case of
DEMO Chance, when the contents of all but two briefcases have been DEMO, the contestant
is given the option to forgo the oﬀer she DEMO and take her chances by playing the
two-outcome lottery. In eﬀect, DEMO contestant is chancing her deal against the contents
of her briefcase. The Chance feature occurs at the producer’s discretion, when the two
remaining briefcases contain substantially diﬀerent prizes (typically, one is of the order
of DEMO or less, while the other is of the order of several DEMO of thousands of dollars).
With the Supercase feature, the contestant DEMO given the option to forgo the oﬀer she has
accepted and play an eight-outcome lottery that contains the following prizes: $0.5, $100,
DEMO, $2000, $5000, $10 000, $20 000 and $30 000 (DEMO expected value is approximately
$8 500.)4 The Supercase feature also arises at the producer’s discretion, usually when the
deal that has been accepted by the contestant is roughly between $4 000 and $15 000.
A DEMO of 420 standard shows have aired to date in Australia.5 We have a self-collected
prize, an insert featuring the word “CAR”. This represents a car that can be won by the contestant. In
the remaining shows, this case contains $25 000. We will treat the car as equivalent DEMO a monetary prize
of $25 000. During the show, the host DEMO that the car’s advertised value is approximately $30 000.
3In fact, DEMO show continues, with the contestant revealing “what might have been” had DEMO not
accepted the deal. The remainder of the show does not concern us, except in the event that a Chance or
Supercase are oﬀered (see below).
4In the latest series of the show, the DEMO Supercase prizes were altered to: $0.5, $100, $500, $1000,
$10 000, $20 000, CAR, and $50 000 (the expected DEMO is approximately $13 300).
5An additional 20 shows have aired, DEMO some diﬀerences to the format of the shows in our data
set. 16 shows aired once a week in an initial run of the DEMO We consider these shows to be diﬀerent
from our data set because the contestants had not had an opportunity to watch the show, and familiarise
themselves with the process by which the bank determines its oﬀers. DEMO addition, the stakes involved
were larger. Four additional shows have been DEMO during our sample. These shows involve contestants
selected based on speciﬁc characteristics, including a “clairvoyant special” and an “unlucky loser” show.
6
data set of 399 of these shows.6 We have information on the DEMO gender, but on
no other individual characteristics. We see no reason DEMO self-selection to be a serious
issue. In private communication, the producers DEMO us that contestants are selected
on the basis of being “outgoing”, DEMO there is no screening of contestants on the basis of
their risk preferences.
The following are some other important characteristics of the data set. DEMO, contes-
tants are familiar with the rules from having repeatedly watched DEMO show. An initial
series screened in a prime viewing time, prior DEMO our data. In addition, when given the
opportunity, many contestants reveal that they have watched the show (“it always looks
much easier at home”), but we cannot recall contestants revealing they are unfamiliar with
DEMO show. Second, contestants typically have a friend or partner in the DEMO, with
whom they are encouraged to consult for diﬃcult decisions. We DEMO therefore consider
decisions to be joint ones, although the ﬁnal decision DEMO rests with the contestant.
Finally, the decision time available to the DEMO is at the discretion of the producer.
In practice, contestants are DEMO as much time as they need to make a decision. If the
contestant is faced with a particularly vexing decision, the host will typically throw to a
commercial break (this adds to the tension, but DEMO also allows extra decision-making time).
The producers state that the time taken by the contestant to decide is approximately what
is seen in DEMO televised show.
We conclude this section with some descriptive statistics. Table 1 shows the number
of contestants that accept/reject a bank oﬀer, by round. Table 2 presents statistics on
the contestants’ winnings.

The bank oﬀer gradually improves with each round of the show (relative to the ex-
pected value of the remaining briefcases). This is consistent with the producers’ desire
to maximise the DEMO value of the show. However, it also provides us with use-
DEMO variation with which to identify individual attitudes towards risk. Consequently, no
DEMO has ever accepted a bank oﬀer in the ﬁrst two rounds of the show, and only a
handful have accepted in the third round. The majority of contestants accept a deal in
one of the later DEMO, with 54 contestants rejecting all oﬀers. On average contestants
take home DEMO $15 000, noticeably less than $19 112, the ex ante expected
value of their chosen briefcase.
6Shows are missing from our sample for DEMO random reasons, arising largely from videotaping
mishaps.

3 The contestant’s problem
Consider our contestant #35. In round 9 he7 faced a simple static choice problem. Should
DEMO accept the bank oﬀer of $4800? Or, should he take his chances by holding on to his
briefcase, which contains either $1500 or $7500? This is quite diﬀerent from the choice
problem that he faced in round 8. There, he had the choice of accepting a bank oﬀer
of $3175, or taking his chances by opening one briefcase (DEMO, $1500 or $7500) and then
playing round 9 with the remaining two briefcases. But, which two briefcases will round 9
involve, what DEMO oﬀer will he receive, and how will these aﬀect his choice DEMO round 9? In
other words, in round 8, as well DEMO in all previous rounds, the contestant faces a dynamic
choice problem. DEMO this section, we ﬁrst describe the dynamic nature of the contestant’s
DEMO Then, we model the determination of bank oﬀers.
3.1 The dynamic DEMO
We ﬁrst introduce some notation. Rounds are indexed by r = 1, 2, ..., 9. We denote by
n(r) the number DEMO briefcases to be opened in round r, and by S the DEMO of remaining
briefcases (monetary amounts) at the beginning of a round. There are N (r) =
C |S |
n(r )
S1 , ..., S N (r )
subsets of S of order n(r), which we label as n(r ) n(DEMO ) . These are all the sets of
briefcases that the contestant may open in round r. Assuming that the contestant opens
the briefcases DEMO
round r + 1.
S i , then S \S i
n(r ) n(r )
is the set of briefcases that the contestant faces in
Consider now a contestant who in round r faces DEMO set of remaining briefcases S and
a bank oﬀer b. Suppose that she is an expected utility maximiser with wealth w and with
utility DEMO u(·; θ), where θ is a scalar. The notation DEMO (S; θ) will denote the expected
utility of the remaining DEMO amounts, S, given the contestant’s utility function,
u(·; DEMO). Furthermore, suppose that the contestant believes that the bank generates DEMO
according to some function b(S, r, ε), where ε is a noise term distributed according to the
probability density function f (ε).
7We use female pronouns when we refer to a generic DEMO, but we use the appropriate pronoun
when we refer to speciﬁc DEMO
8
Then, we can write the contestant’s objective function as:
V (DEMO, b, r) = max c · u(w + b; θ) + (1 − c) · W (S, r) (1)
c∈{0,1}
N (r )

EU (S; θ), for r = 9
where c ∈ {0, 1} denotes the contestant’s choice between rejecting, c = 0, or DEMO,
c = 1, the bank oﬀer.
In contrast, a myopic contestant who neglects the dynamic nature of her problem and
adopts a DEMO perspective solves:
max c · u(w + b; θ) + (1 − c) · EU (S; θ) (3)DEMO
c∈{0,1}
Given the parameter θ, we can solve either the DEMO or the static problem numer-
ically. We make use of this numerical solution in later sections.
For future reference, we should also note that the distinction between the static and
the dynamic perspective has important implications DEMO estimation purposes. To see this,
consider a contestant, who in DEMO 8 faces three remaining briefcases that contain $2,
$1500 and $7500. Suppose that she is a risk-averse expected utility maximiser with zero
wealth DEMO constant relative risk-aversion utility function u(x) = x1−θ . Also, suppose that
1−θ
in round 8 she accepts a bank oﬀer of DEMO With this information, a researcher wants
to estimate a bound on DEMO risk-aversion parameter θ. A static perspective would imply
that
and, hence, θ ≥ 0.1. Suppose instead that we adopt a dynamic perspective. Moreover,DEMO
suppose that the contestant expects that in round 9 the bank oﬀer will be equal to the
expected value of the remaining briefcases. Since DEMO is risk-averse, in round 9 she will
accept the bank oﬀer. DEMO, the acceptance of the bank oﬀer in round 8 implies that
DEMO u(7500 + 1500) + 1 u(1500 + 2) + 1 u(7500 + 2) ≤
3 2 3 2 3 2 u(2800) (5)
and, hence, θ ≥ 0.34. In DEMO words, if the contestant is forward-looking, a researcher
who ﬁts a static model will underestimate the contestant’s risk aversion. Vice versa, if the
contestant treats her decision problem in a static way, a researcher who ﬁts a dynamic
model will overestimate the contestant’s risk aversion.
One potential DEMO to our modelling strategy is worthy of mention. One might
suspect that, when deciding whether to accept a bank oﬀer, a rational contestant DEMO
consider the possibility of being oﬀered a Supercase or Chance at the end of the game.
These special rounds of play represent an option DEMO that may inﬂuence a contestant’s
decision making during the main rounds of the show, and aﬀect our estimates of her
degree of risk aversion. We have chosen not to explicitly model this possibility for the
following DEMO reasons. First, based on observing the show, contestants do not appear
9
1[u(7500) +
3
u(1500) + u(2)]
DEMO
u(2800) (4)
to take into account the possibility of a Supercase or Chance. Contestants DEMO often asked
to explain their thinking when faced with a diﬃcult decision. They routinely hypothesise
about likely bank oﬀers and ponder the sensitivity of DEMO plight to the particular briefcase
they will eliminate. We cannot recall a single instance in which a contestant discussed the
possibility of Supercase or DEMO (although on at least one occasion, the host suggested
the possibility). Second, we might a priori expect the eﬀect of Supercase and Chance on
decision making to be small in any case. Very few DEMO have revealed a preference
for either Chance or Supercase (a total DEMO 24 in our sample). Moreover, it is our judgement
that, even for those contestants more inclined to Chance or Supercase, the option value of
the special rounds is likely to be small when compared DEMO the payoﬀs at stake. Finally,
we are in a position to treat this issue as an empirical matter. The Supercase and Chance
features DEMO introduced after 140 regular shows. If the option value of these features
plays an important role, we would expect to obtain diﬀerent parameter estimates in the
subsample of our data after their introduction. We do not DEMO this to be the case.8
3.2 The bank oﬀer function
We have already seen that, for a forward-looking contestant, the decision to accept DEMO
reject a bank oﬀer in the current round depends on her beliefs about future bank oﬀers.
We will now estimate an empirical model of DEMO Bank’s oﬀer process. Later, when we solve
for a structural model DEMO the contestant’s problem, we will assume that the contestant
uses the DEMO of this empirical model to form beliefs about future bank oﬀers.9
As we noted earlier, the bank oﬀer gradually improves (relative to the DEMO value
of the remaining briefcases) as we progress from one round DEMO the next. This is illustrated
by Table 3. The columns on the left provide descriptive statistics on bank oﬀers by round
in our sample, while the columns on the right contain equivalent information for the
expected DEMO of remaining briefcases. The average bank oﬀer ranges from 17.5% of the
expected value of remaining briefcases in round 1, to almost 100% in round 9. We will
therefore estimate a separate empirical bank oﬀer model DEMO each round of play of the
form:
(6)
where DEMO and i index the rounds and contestants respectively, bir is the DEMO oﬀer to
contestant i in round r, βr is the vector DEMO parameters to be estimated and εir is a
8We examined this issue in the context of the CARA model, using both static and dynamic formu-
lations, and the same three speciﬁcations of the stochastic choice model that we consider in section 5.
Of these 6 speciﬁcations, our risk-aversion estimates are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent after the introduction of
the special features only DEMO the dynamic model that does not allow individual heterogeneity. As we will
argue below, individual heterogeneity plays a fundamental role in our data. More details are available
upon request.
9Literally speaking, this means that contestants solve multiple regressions in their head and then use
the out-of-sample predictions to DEMO beliefs about what the future bank oﬀers will be. In practice,
contestants are typically able, sometimes with aid from the host, to DEMO with some accuracy the Bank’s
oﬀer function. On numerous occasions, contestants DEMO asked to guess the current Bank oﬀer just before
it is revealed, demonstrating they have a decent grasp of the bank oﬀer function. In addition, when faced
with a diﬃcult decision, the contestants sometimes ask DEMO host for his complete contingent guess about
the next round’s Bank oﬀer (which the host sometimes also reveals without request).

As we might expect, considerable heteroskedasticity is evident if (6) is estimated in
linear form. We take DEMO logarithms of all variables to deal with this issue. Note
that we have no intrinsic interest in βr ; (6) is just a DEMO model. In choosing
between models, we face a trade oﬀ between DEMO and forecasting performance. We
seek a simple model both to realistically approximate the contestant’s problem, and to
minimise the computational burden for our structural estimation procedure. Based on
these considerations, Table 4 contains the parameter estimates we take to our empirical
model.

Notice that the model has a great deal of explanatory power, particularly in the
later rounds. Given the predictive power of the bank oﬀer DEMO, to minimise the
11
computational burden of our problem, we assume that the contestant uses the expected
value of our bank oﬀer function to predict future bank oﬀers. DEMO explanatory power
is lower in the earlier rounds, but in the DEMO rounds, the bank oﬀers are suﬃciently
meagre to make the contestant’s DEMO simple. Consequently, no contestant in our
sample accepts a deal before DEMO 3. Note also that the fourth round bank oﬀer function
is relevant for a round 3 decision. Table 9 in Appendix B contains estimates DEMO a more
general model, with slightly greater predictive power, particularly for the early rounds.
In the early rounds, the previous bank oﬀer contains some predictive power, suggesting a
minor additional complexity in these early rounds. Finally, note that the Bank oﬀers are
not made strategically.10 We tested whether the bank oﬀer function may be inﬂuenced
by the value of DEMO briefcase held by the contestant by including this briefcase value as an
explanatory variable in (6), using the set of explanatory variables contained in Table 9.
There was no systematic impact of the contestant’s briefcase, it had a negative coeﬃcient
in 6 of the 8 rounds examined, and was positive and statistically signiﬁcant in none of the
rounds.
4 DEMO bounds approach
Suppose that a contestant i is an expected utility maximiser with a CARA utility function,
u(x; θi ) = 1 − exp(−θi x). The parameter θi is contestant i’s coeﬃcient DEMO absolute risk
aversion. When this contestant rejects a (worse than actuarially DEMO) bank oﬀer she signals
an upper bound on her coeﬃcient of DEMO aversion, θi . When she accepts a bank oﬀer she
signals DEMO lower bound. Using this observation, we calculate lower and upper bounds DEMO
each contestant, whenever possible. We should emphasise upfront that the CARA DEMO
function (and the expected utility paradigm in general) may not be the appropriate model
to describe contestants’ choices. For this reason, the results we report in this section are
supposed to be interpreted in a DEMO way. In other words, they are our ﬁrst (crude)
attempt to describe average risk aversion in the data.
For each contestant i, in each round r, we calculate the value of the parameter θ that
would make the contestant indiﬀerent between accepting or rejecting the bank DEMO That
is, for each contestant i and round r, we calculate the critical θ, such that:
u(bir , θ) = DEMO (Sir , r; θ) (7)
u(bir , θ) = EU (Sir ; θ) (8)
where Sir denotes DEMO set of remaining briefcases faced by contestant i at the end of round
r. We use equation (7) (respectively, equation (8)) for forward-looking (respectively,
myopic) contestants.
We take the “most favourable” (lowest critical θ) bank oﬀer rejected as the upper
bound and the critical θ of the bank oﬀer accepted as the lower bound. For DEMO contes-
tants we can only place lower bounds, for others we DEMO only place upper bounds and for
10The producers were reluctant to reveal details of the bank oﬀer function in private discussions. Our
understanding is DEMO a ﬁxed algorithm has been developed to generate oﬀers. However, it DEMO clear that
show-speciﬁc discretion in bank oﬀers is occasionally employed to add humour to the show. For example,
a bank oﬀer of $9 DEMO may arise if the contestant has stated during the show that they would be satisﬁed
to take home $10 000.
12
some we can place no bounds. For example, if a contestant rejects all bank oﬀers, some
of which were better than actuarially fair (DEMO ), we cannot calculate any bound. (Such
a contestant exhibits risk-loving behaviour.) Figure 1 describes the types of bounds that
can be computed for diﬀerent types of contestants.

4.1 Results from the bounds approach
The results are summarised in Tables 5 and 6, for myopic and forward-looking contestants,
respectively. We discern two notable observations.
First, there is a very high degree of heterogeneity in the contestants’ risk-aversion
parameter. Within every subcategory of contestants, the standard deviation of risk-
aversion bounds is of the same order DEMO magnitude as the mean. The range of values is
also dramatic, DEMO a minimum upper bound of 4.2 × 10−6 and a maximum lower bound of
1.3 × 10−3 for the dynamic formulation. Furthermore, this variety is evident even for the
selection of contestants who do not display DEMO behaviour. Second, conclusions on
risk preferences depend crucially on whether we DEMO contestants are forward-looking
or myopic. Absolute risk-aversion estimates are greater by a factor of 10 in the dynamic
model. We will further discuss these DEMO in the context of our structural model (see
next section).
DEMO would also like to point out that there are 31 and 47 (forward-looking and myopic,
respectively) contestants that exhibit inconsistent behaviour, in the sense that their lower
bound is higher than their upper bound. DEMO means that they accepted a bank oﬀer
that was worse (in DEMO expected utility CARA sense) than at least one oﬀer that they
DEMO in earlier rounds. Four more contestants (in either our forward-looking or DEMO
formulation) were inconsistent in an even more perverse sense: they rejected a better than

actuarially fair oﬀer, indicating risk-seeking behaviour, only to later accept a worse than
actuarially fair oﬀer.
For those contestants who DEMO consistent behaviour and for whom we were able
to calculate both lower and upper risk-aversion bounds, Figures 2 (static model) and 3
(DEMO model) provide further illustration. (Note that the risk-aversion scales diﬀer by
a factor of 10 for the static and dynamic models.)
The DEMO on the right plot the fraction of contestants whose bounds nest the level
of risk aversion in the x-axis. For example, in the static model for approximately 23% of
the contestants, a risk aversion parameter of 2.5 × 10−5 falls within the interval spanned
by their lower and DEMO bounds. Or in the dynamic model, for approximately 21% of
the DEMO, a risk aversion parameter of 2.5 × 10−4 falls within the DEMO spanned
by their bounds.
The ﬁgures on the left depict probability density functions of the risk aversion param-
eter. We account for the length DEMO the interval spanned by a contestant’s bounds and
assigning higher weights to contestants whose bounds span smaller intervals. This is be-
cause the smaller DEMO interval, the closer our bounds approach comes to pinpointing that
contestant’s DEMO risk aversion parameter.11 More precisely, these ﬁgures are derived by
the DEMO procedure. First, for each contestant we calculate the interval spanned by
DEMO/her upper and lower bounds. Second, we presume that the contestant’s DEMO risk
aversion parameter is uniformly distributed in that interval. Finally, we DEMO an average
over all contestants in our subsample. With this approach, DEMO ﬁgure plots the probability
density function of the risk aversion parameter in this subsample. In other words, the
area under the curve up to, say, 2.5 × 10−4, represents the fraction of contestants with a
“true” risk aversion parameter less than or equal to 2.5 × 10−4, under the uniform prior
assumption.12
11Notice the spike in the right graph DEMO Figure 3. This depicts a single contestant whose lower and
upper bounds are very close to one another.
12Suppose, for example, that the DEMO consisted of just two contestants whose bounds spanned
the intervals [1, DEMO and [1.5, 2], respectively. Then, the probability density function would DEMO height 1

Notes: 8 contestants are missing from the summary DEMO for the dynamic model.
We were unable to calculate upper bounds on risk aversion for 5 contestants who accepted an oﬀer
in round 3. DEMO were unable to calculate lower bounds on risk aversion for 3 contestants who
accepted an oﬀer that was worse than the oﬀer they would DEMO expected next round no matter
which briefcase was opened (under our DEMO oﬀer function).
These ﬁgures highlight again the dispersion in risk preferences and the diﬀerence in
our risk-aversion inferences under the assumptions of static DEMO dynamic behaviour. The
modal contestant has an absolute risk-aversion of 1.0 × 10−5 and 7.0 × 10−5 in our static
and dynamic frameworks, respectively.

Finally, Table 7 presents further information on the behaviour of risk seekers (contes-
tants who rejected better than actuarially fair oﬀers). In our sample of 399 contestants,

4.2 Is there an endowment eﬀect for lotteries?DEMO
So far, we have restricted attention to rounds 1 through 9. DEMO, we extend our method
in placing upper and lower bounds for DEMO Chance and Supercase rounds. Our objective
is to explore whether contestants exhibit an endowment eﬀect for lotteries.
Notice, that during rounds 1 through 9 it is “as if” the contestant owns her briefcase
(essentially a lottery) and the host is trying to convince her to sell the lottery to the Bank.
In the Chance-Supercase rounds the situation is reversed: it is “as if” the host is trying to
convince the contestant to DEMO a lottery from the Bank. If it were the case that contestants
are more risk-averse in the Chance-Supercase rounds, this would be equivalent to saying
that the selling price (rounds 1-9) is higher than the DEMO price (Chance-Supercase).
This type of anomaly, referred to as the endowment eﬀect, is well documented, usually in
the context of goods. DEMO, we explore whether it extends to lotteries.
Our contestant #168 is DEMO stark example. In round 6, he faced the following remaining
briefcases: $1, $10, $150, $5000 and $10 000 (expected value of, approximately, $3000).
He decided to reject the bank oﬀer of $3700. In round 7, he opened the $150-briefcase,
16
which increased the expected value of the remaining briefcases to $3750, and accepted
the bank oﬀer of $5100. Fair enough. In the Supercase round, however, he faced a lottery
with expected value $8512, which he DEMO in favour of the (accepted) bank oﬀer of
$5100. His behaviour in round 6 reveals risk-loving preferences, whereas his behaviour in
the Supercase round reveals risk-averse preferences.
Table 8 summarises our results for both forward-looking DEMO myopic contestants. We
seek evidence in favour of an endowment eﬀect when the Chance or Supercase oﬀers are
rejected, despite the fact that the special oﬀer was actuarially favourable (the expected
value of the oﬀer was greater than the value of the briefcase held by the contestant). DEMO
these instances, a lower bound is placed on the risk aversion DEMO in the context of
these special rounds of play. There are a total of 28 such instances, 13 for Supercase and
15 for Chance. A contestant presents evidence in favour of the endowment eﬀect when the
DEMO bound for the special round is higher than the upper bound calculated for rounds
1 through 9.
Under the hypothesis that contestants are myopic, there is strong evidence in favour of
an endowment eﬀect. A total DEMO 21 out of the 28 “eligible” contestants display greater risk
aversion (DEMO a CARA expected utility sense) during the Chance-Supercase special rounds.
Moreover, 7 out of these 21 contestants (4 in Supercase and 3 in Chance) display risk-
seeking behaviour during the main part of the show, but are risk-averse in the special round
(like contestant #168). DEMO results, however, are not so clear-cut under the hypothesis
that contestants are forward-looking. In this setting, there are only 10 contestants who
display greater risk-aversion in the special rounds.13
In light of these results, we conclude that an endowment eﬀect may well be present, but
we cannot provide a deﬁnitive answer. We will further discuss this issue in the DEMO
section.
5 Estimating a structural model
The bounds approach we discussed in the previous section has the advantage that it
allows us to extract DEMO on the risk preferences of individual contestants. The
downside is that we do not harness the entire data set to say something about “average”
DEMO Here, we estimate a structural model of contestant behaviour.
Following Hey DEMO Orme (1994), we assume that a contestant’s decisions reﬂect her
DEMO preferences plus noise. The noise could reﬂect contestants having diﬃculty making
decisions, the researcher being unable to observe all inﬂuences on the contestant’s choice,
or various mistakes that the contestant makes.
Furthermore, our earlier results on upper and lower bounds (and indeed casual obser-
vation) suggest DEMO individual contestants diﬀer substantially in their risk attitudes. To
13Conversely, we DEMO seek evidence against an endowment eﬀect when the special oﬀers are accepted
and the oﬀer is actuarially favourable. There are 23 such instances, 11 for Supercase and 12 for Chance.
Out of these 23 “eligible” cases, there are 3 instances where contestants display less risk aversion during
the DEMO round. We should note, however, that 2 of these 3 contestants display inconsistent behaviour
during the main part of the show. That is, they accepted a bank oﬀer that was worse (in a CARA sense)
than an oﬀer they earlier rejected. The remaining contestant who accepted DEMO actuarially unfavourable
oﬀer in the Chance round, also displayed risk-seeking behaviour DEMO the main part of the show.

account for unobserved contestant-speciﬁc heterogeneity, we also allow for a contestant-
speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀect. Depending on how one introduces the ﬁxed eﬀect term (see below),
this produces DEMO random eﬀects or a random coeﬃcients model of discrete choice.
More formally (with slight abuse of our earlier notation), we deﬁne the relative attrac-
tiveness of the bank oﬀer to contestant i in round r, Zir , as:
Zir (θ) = u(bir ; θ) − W (Sir , r; θ) (9)
Zir (θ) = u(bir ; θ) − EU (Sir ; θ) (10)
for a forward-looking and a myopic contestant, respectively.
Let cir denote contestant i’s decision in round r. Also, let ir ∼ F (·) be the noise term
for contestant i in round r DEMO let νi ∼ G(·) be the contestant-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀect. We
DEMO also denote by f (·) and g(·) the probability DEMO functions for the noise term, ir ,
and the ﬁxed eﬀect term, νi , respectively. We then have:
1 if zir (DEMO, νi ) + ir > 0 (11)
=  0 otherwise
cir
We consider three separate speciﬁcations for the term zir (θ, νi ):
zir (θ, νi ) = Zir (θ) (12)
zir (θ, νi ) = Zir (θ) + νi (13)
zir (θ, νi ) = Zir (θ DEMO νi ) (14)
The ﬁrst model speciﬁcation, in equation (DEMO), is our baseline model, which does not
allow for contestant DEMO ﬁxed eﬀects. The second model speciﬁcation, in equation
18
(13), is the random eﬀects model, while the third one, in equation (14), is the random
coeﬃcients model.
We can then construct a likelihood function as follows. Given the ﬁxed eﬀect, νi , the
probability of observing contestant i’s decision in round r is given DEMO (for a symmetric
distribution f (·)):
P (cir DEMO ) = F ((2cir − 1)zir (θ, νi )) (15)
Integrating over the ﬁxed eﬀect, νi , the likelihood function for contestant i is given by:
P (ci ) =

where ci = {ci1, ci2, ..., ciRi } and Ri is the round in which the contestant accepts a deal.
If the contestant never accepts a DEMO, then Ri = 9.
The likelihood function for all observations in DEMO data set is:
N
P (c) = Y

P (ci ) (17)
where c = {c1, c2, ..., cN } and N is the total number of contestants.
Finally, we assume that f ∼ N (0, σ2) and g ∼ N (0, σν2). We then estimate the
parameter vector {θ, σ , σν } by maximum likelihood.14

5.1 Results
We consider each DEMO the three model speciﬁcations (baseline, random eﬀects and random
coeﬃcients) DEMO the context of both the static and the dynamic model. We also consider
each of these cases, in the context of both the CARA and the CRRA utility functions,
given by:15
u(x) = 1 − exp(−θx) (18)
u(x) = x1−θ (DEMO)
1 − θ
14Because each contestant’s dynamic problem must be solved many times for each evaluation of the
likelihood function, the dynamic formulation is computationally intensive, particularly for the random
coeﬃcients speciﬁcation. In our empirical results below, we report dynamic estimates based on data for
rounds 5-9 only. While this omits all contestants accepting a deal before round 5, it also omits all rejected
oﬀers in rounds 1-4. We have obtained DEMO of the dynamic model with the CARA formulation using
data from rounds 4-9, with similar results to those reported. These results and computational details of
the estimation algorithm, implemented in the C programming language, are DEMO from the authors
on request.
15Both the CARA and CRRA utility functions are unique up to an aﬃne transformation. In order to
mitigate heteroskedasticity DEMO the error term, we normalise utility so that u(0) = 0 and u(200000) = 1,
where $200 000 is the maximum possible payoﬀ in the game. To achieve this, we divide through by
u(200000) in (18). In (19), for speciﬁcations with positive contestant wealth, we use the normalization

The results are summarised in Tables 10-15, in Appendix C.
CARA preferences
Tables 10 and 11 summarise the results with CARA preferences for myopic DEMO
forward-looking contestants respectively. The even numbered columns (for each model
speciﬁcation, respectively) allow for a dummy variable that refers to the contestant’s gen-
der (1 for female). We see no indication that female and male risk preferences diﬀer, with
the possible exception of the static model without contestant heterogeneity.
The static vs. the dynamic estimates
We should ﬁrst DEMO that the static and the dynamic estimates are substantially dif-
ferent, DEMO one full order of magnitude. To appreciate this diﬀerence in practical terms,
consider the lottery that pays $100 000 or nothing, with equal probability. The static
estimates, in the range of 7 × 10−6, DEMO a certainty equivalent in the low $40 000’s. In
contrast, the DEMO estimates, in the range of 5 × 10−5, imply a certainty equivalent in
the neighbourhood of $15 000. Moreover, the fact that the dynamic estimates are higher
than the static ones is consistent with what DEMO would expect. This is because, rela-
tive to a myopic contestant, a forward-looking contestant faces a lottery with a smoother
outcome distribution. Hence, all else (bank oﬀer, risk aversion) being equal, she is DEMO
reluctant to accept a bank oﬀer.
The estimates for the coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion, θ
Our dynamic estimates for the coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion, θ, are in the range
of 2.7 × 10−5 DEMO 5.7 × 10−5. These numbers are in line with the estimates of Gertner (1993)
and Metrick (1995). The former reports estimates DEMO 7 × 10−5 and 3 × 10−4, depending
on the method DEMO The latter reports an estimate of 6.6 × 10−5, though this DEMO not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. To get an intuitive feeling for what these magnitudes
imply for high-stakes lotteries, consider the lottery that pays $100 000, $20 000 or nothing,
with equal probability. The certainty equivalent implied by, say, θ = 5 × 10−5 is in the
DEMO of $15 000. Fullenkamp, Tenorio and Battalio (2003) report estimates
DEMO are more in line with our static estimates, in the range DEMO 5.8 × 10−6 to 7.4 × 10−6.
With estimates in this range, the certainty equivalent of the lottery that pays $100 000,
$20 000 or nothing, with equal probability, is approximately $34 000.
The DEMO of the estimates for the standard deviation terms, σν and σ
DEMO bounds approach from section 4 revealed substantial heterogeneity in individual
risk preferences. The results of the structural estimation corroborate this result. To see
this, turn attention to the random coeﬃcients model which places the individual hetero-
DEMO term in the same metric as our risk aversion parameter, allowing DEMO to be
made about heterogeneity in risk preferences. Our estimates of σν for both the dynamic
and static models are comparable to our respective DEMO of θ. Furthermore, turning
attention to the random eﬀects model, which places the individual heterogeneity term in
the same metric as the round-speciﬁc DEMO term, we see that the standard deviation of
our round-speciﬁc error DEMO, σ , is of the same order of magnitude as the DEMO devi-
ation of the contestant-speciﬁc term. This suggests that the noise term may play a role
as important as the contestant-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀect. We DEMO return to this issue shortly.
CRRA preferences
20
Tables 12-15 contain the maximum likelihood estimates for the case of CRRA DEMO
erences. Again, the even numbered columns allow for a dummy variable DEMO refers to
the contestant’s gender, and again we see no indication DEMO a diﬀerence in risk preferences.
Also, notice that, as in the CARA case, as we move from the static to the dynamic models,
the estimates for the parameter θ increase.
The eﬀect of initial DEMO
In contrast to the CARA case, the decisions of a CRRA DEMO utility maximiser
are sensitive to her initial wealth level. Tables 12 and 13 assume an initial wealth level of
zero, while Tables 14 and 15 assume an initial wealth level equal to the average Australian
annual DEMO income of $41 880.16 The estimates of the parameter θ increase substantially
when we introduce initial wealth and this is consistent with what one DEMO predict. This
is because, with CRRA preferences, initial wealth makes a decision maker less risk-averse.
To compensate for this, the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion has to increase.17
The estimates for the coeﬃcient of relative DEMO aversion, θ
Assuming zero initial wealth, our estimates for the parameter θ in the dynamic model
are in the vicinity of 1 (see Table 13). With positive initial wealth, our estimates are
2
in the range of 1.8 to 3.2 (see Table 15). We should be careful, however, in how we
interpret diﬀerent estimates for the DEMO θ, obtained under diﬀerent levels of initial
wealth. For example, consider again the lottery that pays $100 000, $20 000 or nothing,
with equal probability. Our estimates with zero initial wealth, in the vicinity of 1 , imply
2
a certainty equivalent of approximately $23 000. DEMO is not very diﬀerent from the
certainty equivalent that one obtains under our estimates with positive initial wealth
(when the expected utility calculation is based on ﬁnal wealth positions). For example,
with θ = DEMO, the certainty equivalent is slightly below $22 000. With regard to DEMO of
previous studies, Fullenkamp, Tenorio and Battalio (2003) report a range of 0.64 to 1.76,
depending on initial wealth levels. Beetsma DEMO Schotman (2001) report a signiﬁcantly
higher estimate of 7.
The signiﬁcance of the estimates for the standard deviation terms, σν and σ
As in the CARA model, both of our error terms play an important role. For example,
taking the normal distribution assumption (for the ﬁxed eﬀect, ν) at face value, our stan-
dard deviation estimate of 0.21 in Table 13 implies that for two-thirds of the contestants,
DEMO parameter θ is between 0.34 and 0.76. The remaining one-third of the contestants fall
outside this range. We view this as signiﬁcant variation in DEMO degree of risk aversion.
16Australian annual labor income is calculated from the series “All employees total earnings” in Aus-
tralian Bureau of Statistics Catalogue DEMO, August 2005. One could argue that this measure under-
states contestant DEMO We have considered alternative wealth levels. Doing so merely re-calibrates our
estimates of θ without aﬀecting any of our conclusions. For example, the certainly equivalents we report
below are robust to alternative choices of initial wealth. DEMO details are available on request.
17We should also point out that assuming zero initial wealth is equivalent to adopting the stance that
contestants approach DEMO game show as an isolated (or segregated) event. In other words, rather than
maximizing the expected utility of their ﬁnal wealth position, DEMO maximise the expected utility
of their game show winnings. Note that this is one of the basic tenants of prospect theory. Moreover,
Gertner (1993) reports evidence in favour of the notion that contestants in the game show Card Sharks
segregate decisions even during the show.
21
Turning to our random eﬀects speciﬁcation (which puts the two standard deviation
terms in the same metric), in all models, the variance of the round-speciﬁc error term
is of the same order of magnitude as DEMO individual heterogeneity term. In other words,
the degree of heterogeneity at the contestant level is matched by heterogeneity at the
individual round level. DEMO our view, this ﬁnding strongly suggests that, if we are to
employ an expected utility framework, a stochastic element (noise) is called for.18 This
noise could reﬂect the diﬃculty faced by contestants in arriving DEMO decisions, which is
certainly evident from casual observation of the show. DEMO, contestants may
make mistakes or may be inﬂuenced by other factors DEMO of our model. The relative
advantage of stochastic choice models, over DEMO ones, for estimating expected
(and non-expected) utility preferences was ﬁrst DEMO by Hey and Orme (1994). We
view our ﬁndings as DEMO evidence in favour of the use of stochastic choice models in
this context.
5.2 The endowment eﬀect revisited
In section 4.2 we used our DEMO in placing upper and lower bounds in order to test
the hypothesis that contestants exhibit increased risk aversion during the special rounds,
Chance DEMO Supercase. Such behaviour would be consistent, if it were to be DEMO, with
a well-known observed anomaly, referred to as the endowment eﬀect. In this section, we
revisit this discussion in the context of our structural estimation.
Towards this end, we restrict attention to the subsample of contestants who advanced
to one of the two special rounds.19 We then DEMO our earlier structural estimation for
all choices, including those that these DEMO made in the special rounds. A dummy
variable controls for whether the choice occurred in a special round (dummy is 1) or not
(dummy is 0).
The results are summarised in Table 16. The DEMO of the special round is positive
across all model speciﬁcations, i.e. DEMO exhibit greater risk aversion in the special
rounds. However, this eﬀect DEMO signiﬁcant only for the static models (columns (1)-(3));
under the assumption that contestants are forward-looking, the coeﬃcients of the special
round dummy (columns (4)-(6)) are not signiﬁcantly DEMO from zero. These results
have the same ﬂavour as those reported in section 4.2.
To conclude, if contestants approach their decisions in a rational (i.e. dynamic) man-
ner, then our verdict is that the “average contestant” does not display an endowment
eﬀect. To put it in diﬀerent DEMO, an argument in favour of an endowment eﬀect can
only be DEMO in conjunction with an argument in favour of myopic behaviour.
18We are unable to formally test for the (statistical) importance of stochastic choice DEMO to the
existence of a substantial number of contestants who violate the maintained hypotheses of expected
utility maximization and risk aversion.
19Note that using DEMO entire sample could cloud our estimates of an endowment eﬀect with a selection
eﬀect, arising because only contestants who have accepted a bank oﬀer are subsequently oﬀered a Chance
or Supercase.
22
6 The rank dependent utility model
A maintained hypothesis throughout has been DEMO contestants are expected utility (EU)
maximisers. We now want to DEMO this presumption. In recent years a number of gen-
eralisations of the EU functional have been proposed. Here, we turn our attention to
one of the most prominent of these generalisations, namely the rank dependent utility
(RDU) functional, due to Quiggin (1982). In fact, the exact same reasons that made it
so prominent also lead us to DEMO it over other possible alternatives: it nests expected
utility (allowing us to test for its superiority with formal statistical tests), it is DEMO to
apply, and intuitive. That it is easy to estimate is DEMO an important consideration given
the computational burden of our problem.
We should point out that by restricting attention to the RDU and EU models, we are
implicitly presuming that a contestant’s frame of reference is her DEMO wealth. With this
reference point, there are no losses in the DEMO, and therefore many of the contending
generalisations of expected utility theory DEMO little bite. Many contestants implicitly
indicate that their frame of reference is their initial wealth when they utter the common
refrain “well, I came with nothing”. We have therefore chosen to focus on the RDU model
DEMO the most natural challenger to EU theory.20
The RDU functional revolves around a utility function u(·) and a probability weighting
function π(·) that acts on the cumulative distribution function. The preference weighting
accorded to outcome i is given by
ωi = π (pi + . . . + pn )
−
π (pi+1 + . . . DEMO pn )
where pi refers to the objective probability of outcome DEMO in an n outcome lottery, with
outcomes ordered from lowest to DEMO In this way, the attention paid to an outcome
(its decision weight ) depends not only on the objective probability of that outcome, but
also on its preference ranking. We adopt the following probability weighting DEMO
π(p) = pγ
(20)
and consider in turn the same two cases, CARA and CRRA, for the underlying utility
function.
DEMO means that we must estimate the additional parameter γ in the probability
weighting function. (Note that the RDU model reduces to the EU model when γ = 1.) We
must also modify equations (1)-(DEMO) and (9)-(10) appropriately, to be consistent with the
RDU functional. Our empirical speciﬁcation is also slightly altered, with the counterparts
of equations 12 to 14 taking the form:
zir (θ, DEMO ; γ, ηi ) = Zir (θ, γ) (21)DEMO
zir (θ, νi ; γ, ηi ) = Zir (θ, γ) + νi (22)
zir (θ, νi ; γ, ηi ) = Zir (θ + νi , γ + ηi ) (23)
20One could go further and argue that there are DEMO methodological challenges inhibiting the
estimation of any preference functional with a reference point that adjusts with bank oﬀers. To see this,
recall that DEMO bank oﬀer rises in expectation as the contestant plays deeper into the game. At the same
time, it is the less risk averse contestants who are more likely to continue playing further into the game.
By DEMO a correlation between risk preferences and bank oﬀers, this selection problem DEMO the
estimation of the preference functional.
23
We should also add a few remarks concerning the estimation of the DEMO coeﬃcients
RDU model, from equation (23). In this case, DEMO contestant-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀect consists
of two elements, νi and ηi . DEMO former reﬂects the contestant-speciﬁc heterogeneity corre-
sponding to the risk aversion parameter, θ, and is distributed according to N (0, σν2). DEMO
latter reﬂects the contestant-speciﬁc heterogeneity corresponding to the parameter of the
probability weighting function, γ, and is distributed according to N (0, DEMO). We also allow
for the possibility that the two ﬁxed eﬀects are correlated, with correlation coeﬃcient of
ρ. Thus, one needs to DEMO the parameter vector {θ, γ, σν , ση , σ , ρ}.
6.1 Results for the RDU models
The results are in Tables DEMO and 18 for the static and the dynamic models, respectively.
The DEMO results are based on the initial wealth level of $41 880 considered earlier.
Two observations stand out. First, the estimate for the parameter γ is less than one
and relatively stable across all cases, in the neighbourhood of 1 for the dynamic model.
2
This implies a concave DEMO probability weighting function and is suggestive of
optimism. That is, contestants DEMO favourable outcomes. Below, we show that the
RDU model performs markedly DEMO than EU theory in a statistical sense. In terms
of observed behaviour, we can explain this performance as follows. We established in
sections 4 and 5 that contestants are on average risk averse, but a substantial minority of
contestants display risk-seeking behaviour. Moreover, we observe risk seeking for small,
moderate, and large stakes. These patterns can be easily explained by the RDU model,
but with much greater diﬃculty by EU DEMO Under EU theory, even a small degree
of concavity in utility DEMO a very small marginal utility for wealth when considering
large amounts. Any risk-seeking behaviour, particularly for moderate and large stakes,
does not then sit easily with EU theory, but can be explained simply in the RDU model
through a larger decision weight on the most favourable outcomes.
DEMO second observation is that, relative to EU models, there is a substantial rise in
the estimates for both coeﬃcients of absolute and relative DEMO aversion. We should point
out that our two observations are consistent with each other. To see this, notice that in
the RDU model attitudes towards risk enter via both the parameter θ and the parameter
γ. (Assuming that the probability weighting function is of the form π(p) = pγ , a decrease
in γ makes a contestant less risk DEMO) As a result, in order to compensate for its lower
γ (relative to the EU model, where γ = 1), the DEMO model has to involve a higher θ. In
fact, it is DEMO the same reason that one expects the correlation coeﬃcient ρ to be negative,
as it is (though not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero in the dynamic model).
Furthermore, to get an intuitive sense for our estimates, consider once again the lottery
from our earlier discussion that pays $100 000, $20 000 and nothing, with equal probability.
Letting γ DEMO 1, the dynamic estimates of the parameter θ imply certainty equivalents DEMO
2
approximately $13 000 (for CARA with θ = 1.2 × DEMO and for CRRA with θ = 6.5).
6.2 Comparisons between models
Next we explore whether the RDU functional performs substantially better than EU.
DEMO that the RDU preference functional nests EU (when γ = 1), we can use formal
24
statistical tests to check whether RDU is signiﬁcantly better at explaining the DEMO
choices. Tables 17 and 18 report Likelihood Ratio tests that overwhelmingly reject the
restriction that γ = 1 for all speciﬁcations. The Akaike information DEMO and bayesian
information criterion were also considered. Both strongly support the RDU model.
We also explore the relative performance of a special case of DEMO RDU functional,
referred to as Yaari’s (1987) dual theory. This arises when the utility function, u(·), is
linear. While Yaari’s dual theory does not nest EU, it does nest RN. Tables 19 and 20
report maximum likelihood estimates for the risk-neutral model and Yaari’s DEMO theory
model, respectively.
Notice ﬁrst that the estimate for the parameter DEMO in the Yaari model is greater than
1 (and signiﬁcantly so), which is consistent with contestants being risk averse. (In
Yaari’s dual DEMO, risk aversion is equivalent to a convex probability weighting func-
tion.) Likelihood-Ratio tests reject RN in favour of the Yaari model. However, for the
dynamic speciﬁcation the Akaike information criterion and bayesian information criterion
are DEMO conclusive.
To sum up, we conclude that the RDU preference functional DEMO outperforms
EU theory, while Yaari’s dual theory modestly outperforms the theory DEMO risk neutrality.
7 Concluding remarks
This paper examined attitudes towards risk in an unusual data set in which contestants
face high-stakes lotteries, in a setting untainted by strategic considerations or selection
issues relating to skill. As DEMO ﬁrst pass at the data, we placed upper and lower bounds DEMO
the degree of risk aversion of individual contestants within an expected utility framework.
This exercise revealed substantial heterogeneity in risk preferences. We then estimated
DEMO structural stochastic choice model of contestant behaviour. In order to account for
our earlier ﬁnding of substantial heterogeneity, our structural model allowed for a contes-
tant speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀect, which we modelled within both a random eﬀects and a random
coeﬃcients framework. Our key ﬁndings could be summarised DEMO follows:
1. The magnitudes of our estimates
For CARA EU-maximisers, DEMO estimated coeﬃcients of risk aversion in the neighbourhood
of 5 × 10−5. These are in line with the estimates of Gertner (1993) and DEMO (1995),
obtained in the context of the game shows Card Sharks and Jeopardy!, respectively. For
CRRA EU-maximisers (with initial wealth), DEMO estimates are in the range of 1.8 to 3.2
2. The role of individual heterogeneity and the importance of stochastic choice modelling
The structural DEMO estimation conﬁrmed that the variance of the contestant-speciﬁc
ﬁxed eﬀect is indeed substantial. Moreover, this variance is of the same order of magnitude
as the variance of the noise term in our stochastic choice model. This DEMO highlights
the appropriateness of using a stochastic choice model.
3. Does the RDU functional outperform EU theory? Yes.
We also estimated the structural choice model under the assumption that contestants
use the RDU preference functional. We DEMO that the RDU model provides substantial
25
improvements in explanatory power, with restrictions to EU theory overwhelmingly re-
jected. In fact, one can argue that the RDU model outperforms the EU model by the
same factor that EU outperforms risk neutrality. Our estimates DEMO that contestants
are “optimistic”, overweighting more favourable outcomes. However, Yaari’s dual theory,
a special case of the RDU model, only modestly outperforms risk neutrality.
4. Is there an endowment eﬀect for lotteries? No.
Finally, we harnessed unique features of the Australian version of the game to test the
hypothesis of an endowment eﬀect for lotteries. While a handful DEMO contestants exhibit
behaviour consistent with an endowment eﬀect, for the “average” DEMO, we cannot
conﬁrm the hypothesis.

8.1 Appendix A: The complete producers’ manual
In the television program produced by Endemol Southern Star (hereinafter “the Producer”) for
the Seven Network DEMO Deal or no Deal, one contestant will remain from an initial DEMO
of 150 contestants after 2 ROUNDS have been played. This one contestant will then go through
to the FINAL ROUND. All contestants must sign DEMO standard Endemol Southern Star form
known as the “Contestant Agreement”. This “Contestant Agreement” is inseparably linked to
these rules for Deal or no Deal, and forms an integral component part of them. Employees
of Endemol Southern DEMO and their aﬃliated companies (and their immediate families) are
excluded from taking part in Deal or no Deal. Employees of the Seven Network DEMO their
aﬃliated companies (and their immediate families) are excluded from taking part in Deal or
27
no Deal. The Producer’s decision on all matters relating to the production DEMO be ﬁnal. The
Producer may, in the case of unanticipated events, determine that a change in the rules is
required.
THE GAME
The DEMO involved in Deal or no Deal comprises TWO PRELIMINARY ROUNDS and a FINAL
ROUND. Of the 150 contestants in ROUND ONE, only one will ultimately take part in the
FINAL ROUND.
ROUND ONE
The audience of DEMO is divided into 6 blocks of 25. One of these blocks is randomly drawn
by the Producer. The selected block will advance into ROUND DEMO The selection of this
block is non-negotiable, and the Producer’s decision DEMO ﬁnal. In the event that a selected block
contains fewer than 25 contestants, additional contestants will be chosen to take the number in
the block up to 25. These additional contestants will be selected at random DEMO the Producer,
whose decision is ﬁnal. From the remaining 125 audience members, one is selected at random
to join the previously selected block. This 26th contestant instantly wins a cash prize of $500.
The selection DEMO this 26th contestant is non-negotiable, and the Producer’s decision is ﬁnal.
DEMO TWO
The 25 contestants from the selected block, and the additional DEMO (26 contestants in
all) are repositioned to the podium, where DEMO will play ROUND TWO. These 26 contestants
now play as individuals, DEMO three general knowledge multiple-choice questions. For each
question they must choose between three answer options: A, B or C. The contestants are each
DEMO 10 points for every correct answer. The thinking time is 5 seconds per question and
the contestants’ keypads will not be activated until the DEMO option of each question (Option C)
is displayed, and the question music starts. At the end of 5 seconds, the contestants’ keypads
will de-activate. On all questions in this round, the computer incorporates the answering speed
into the scores so that while the scores may be DEMO numerically, the positions (1st - 26th) can
be accurately identiﬁed. DEMO three questions, the one player with the highest score is deemed
DEMO winner. In the event of tied leading scores after three questions, DEMO person who gave the
fastest correct answer to Question 3 will be deemed the winner. This holds true whether the
ﬁnal leading score is DEMO, 20 or 30. If all scores are on zero after 3 DEMO, a new round of
questions will be loaded, and the game will be re-played. The one winning contestant goes
through to THE FINAL DEMO In the event of any dispute as to the correctness of any
answers, the Producer’s decision is ﬁnal and all contestants agree to be bound by this decision.
No discussion will be entered into. FINAL ROUND. DEMO winning contestant from ROUND
TWO, (hereinafter referred to as “the Finalist”) selects one briefcase from 26. The 25 remaining
briefcases are given to the 25 unsuccessful contestants from ROUND TWO. These 25 contestants
(hereinafter referred to as “the Briefcase Contestants”) take turns in opening their numbered
cases, in the order decided by the Finalist. 25 of the cases contain an insert which represents a
cash value. 1 of the cases contains DEMO insert featuring the word “CAR”. This represents the car
which can be won by the Finalist. These 25 cash values, and the word “CAR”, will be displayed
on the Deal or no Deal cash board screens in the studio.
Prior to opening their case, each of the Briefcase Contestants is allowed one guess as to what
is inside it. They DEMO nominate any one of the 25 cash values, or the “CAR”. DEMO they are correct,
they win $1 000, unless they have DEMO awarded a ”Mega-Guess” (see below). If the Briefcase
28
Contestant’s guess is wrong, they win nothing. If a Briefcase Contestant opens their case before
the program’s Host directs them to do so, they win nothing. As each case is opened, its contents
are revealed to the audience, and the Finalist. The cash values contained in the opened cases
are no longer available to be won. Whatever is represented (whether it is a cash value, or the
“CAR”) inside the Finalist’s DEMO is what the Finalist will win, unless they accept an oﬀer
DEMO the “Bank” during the course of the game.
THE DAILY PRIZE
Inside one of the 26 briefcases, in addition to a cash amount, DEMO 6 stars, representing a Daily
Prize. Whichever contestant opens the case DEMO the 6 stars (whether they are a Briefcase
Contestant or Finalist) will be deemed to have won the Daily Prize. The details of DEMO Daily
Prize will be announced by the Host, when it is DEMO If the Daily Prize is inside the Finalist’s
briefcase, the Finalist DEMO win the Daily Prize when their briefcase is opened, even if DEMO have
already accepted a Bank oﬀer.
THE BANK
During the FINAL ROUND, the Finalist is made oﬀers by the program’s Host on behalf of
the Deal or no Deal Bank to sell their (the Finalist’s) DEMO for a cash sum. If the Finalist
accepts a Bank oﬀer, DEMO win the cash sum oﬀered by the Bank, and are no DEMO entitled to
the sum or prize (CAR) that is eventually revealed to be in the Finalist’s briefcase. However,
in selected circumstances, the Bank may oﬀer the CAR instead of a cash sum. If the DEMO
accepts the bank’s oﬀer of a CAR, they win the CAR, and are no longer entitled to the sum that
is eventually revealed DEMO be in the Finalist’s briefcase. The amount of time that the Finalist will
have to consider a Bank oﬀer is entirely at the discretion DEMO the Producer.
OPENING THE BRIEFCASES
The 26 briefcases are opened according to the following system: Six cases are opened. The Bank
makes an oﬀer based on the remaining 20 closed cases. The Finalist decides whether to DEMO or
reject the oﬀer - “Deal or No Deal”. Five cases are opened. The Bank makes an oﬀer based on
the remaining 15 closed DEMO The Finalist decides “Deal or No Deal”. Four cases are opened.
The Bank makes an oﬀer based on the remaining 11 closed cases. The DEMO decides “Deal or
No Deal”. Three cases are opened. The Bank makes an oﬀer based on the remaining 8 closed
cases. The Finalist decides DEMO or No Deal”. Two cases are opened. The Bank makes an oﬀer
based on the remaining 6 closed cases. The Finalist decides “Deal or DEMO Deal”. The remaining
unopened briefcases are then opened. In this portion of the game, one Bank oﬀer is made to
the Finalist after each individual case is opened. If the Finalist opens their selected case before
DEMO program’s Host or the Producer directs them to do so, the DEMO will halt immediately, the
Finalist will be eliminated and the game DEMO be declared null and void. The Finalist will not
be eligible to take part in any further games.
THE “MEGA-GUESS” FEATURE
During the briefcase DEMO round, a special siren may sound, announcing the “Mega-Guess”
feature. Whichever Briefcase Contestant is chosen to open their case immediately after the
siren DEMO gone oﬀ, will be awarded a “Mega-Guess”. This simply means that DEMO this Briefcase
Contestant correctly guesses the amount, or prize (CAR), inside the briefcase they are holding,
they will win $5 000, instead of the usual $1 000. If the Briefcase Contestant’s guess is DEMO,
they win nothing. The “Mega-Guess” feature is to be used in selected games, at the Producer’s
discretion.
29
THE “CHANCE” FEATURE
After a Finalist has accepted a bank oﬀer and DEMO a deal, a “CHANCE” feature may be
introduced by the Deal DEMO no Deal bank. This will be introduced by a special siren and clearly
identiﬁed on the Deal or no Deal cash board. With two DEMO remaining to be opened, the
Bank may oﬀer the Finalist a DEMO to retract their “Deal” decision. If the Finalist accepts,
they forfeit all winnings from their previously made deal, and instead take home whatever is
inside their selected briefcase. In eﬀect, they are “CHANCING” their deal against the contents
of their briefcase. Accepting the “CHANCE” oﬀer is not DEMO If the Finalist declines to
take the “CHANCE”, they will still DEMO with the amount or prize (CAR) they accepted when
the deal was made. The game will be played out as normal. The “CHANC” DEMO is to be
used in selected games, at the Producer’s discretion.
DEMO “SUPER CASE” FEATURE
After a Finalist has accepted a bank oﬀer and made a deal, the Super Case feature may be
introduced by the Deal or no Deal bank. This will be introduced by a special DEMO and clearly
identiﬁed on the Deal or no Deal cash board. If the Finalist elects to take the Super Case
option, they will win whatever cash amount is revealed to be inside the Super Case, and forfeit
their previously struck deal. For each game, one of the following cash values will be selected at
random, and placed inside the Super Case: $0.50, $100, $1 000, $2 000, $5 000, DEMO 000, $20
000, or $30 000. The “SUPER CASE” feature is to be used in selected games, at the Producer’s
discretion.
FRAUD
In the event of fraud or dishonesty (including any form of cheating or collusion) on the part of
any competitor, or if it is DEMO that a contestant was not eligible to be a contestant, the
DEMO may refuse to issue prizes won or require that all prizes awarded to the contestant be
returned immediately.
8.2 Appendix B: The bank oﬀer function
Table 9 contains estimates for a more general bank oﬀer model. DEMO set of explanatory variables
include: the expected value of the remaining DEMO, the standard deviation of the remaining
briefcases, the bank oﬀer from the previous round and the briefcases that the contestant opened
in the DEMO round. Note that in rounds 6-9 the contestant opens only one briefcase, whereas
in rounds 2-5 the contestant opens 5, 4, 3 and 2 briefcases, respectively.
8.3 Appendix C: Tables
The following tables contain DEMO from the estimation of the structural model of section 5.
