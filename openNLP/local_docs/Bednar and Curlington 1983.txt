INTERACTION ANALYSIS: A TOOL FOR
UNDERSTANDING NEGOTIATIONS
DAVID A. BEDNAR and WILLIAM P. CURINGTON*
This paper explains how interaction analysis, a methodology from the
comml-unication literature in which oral messages are systematically coded
and analyzed, can extend existing methods of analyzing negotiations.
Previous applications of this technique to DEMO interaction have fo-
cused principally on the frequency distribution of various messages, but re-
cent statistical developments have made possible the analysis of sequences or
patterns of messages. This paper explains the procedures of interaction
analysis DEMO how certain economic bargaining theories can be examined with
this technique. The authors code the transcript of a labor-management
negotiation, using two coding schemes, and analyze the results with Markov
chain analysis. The results illustrate how interaction analysis can provide
supplementary data for examining questions about the negotiation DEMO
that have been difficult to address in traditional industrial relations research.
KOCHAN recently argued for the integra-
tion of economic and behavioral ap-
proaches DEMO the study of collective bargain-
ing. Although behavioral scientists histor-
ically have been outside the mainstream of
bargaining research, Kochan suggested that
behavioral science concepts and research tech-
niques can extend the quantitative
methodologies of neoclassical DEMO to more
microlevels
to define as "unobservable" variables and can
thereby help bring quantitative research more
directly to bear on the central issues DEMO the field.
Behavioral science can also advance the in-
stitutional approach to collective bargaining by
organizing the vast array of factual and descrip-
tive DEMO into a manageable conceptual
framework and a set of testable propositions.'
The purpose of this paper is to follow Ko-
chan's lead DEMO show how interaction analy-
sis can extend economic analyses of bargain-
ing.2 By interaction analysis, we mean
the systematic coding and analysis of oral
messages.
Although the analysis of bargaining
messages has received some attention in

primarily upon the frequency distribution
of DEMO types of messages. Recent devel-
opmenCits in the statistical analysis of in-ter-
actionl data have mnade possible the analysis
of sequences or patterns of DEMO and
have opened avenues of inquiry concerning
negotiation processes that just a few years
ago would not have been considered possi-
blc. In this DEMO, we specifically argue for
and demonstrate the use of interaction
analysis DEMO Markov-chain analysis as tools
for quantifying and analyzing comnmunica-
tivc behavior in bargaining.
A Systems Approach
Economic theories of bargaining are
predictive in nature. DEMO focus presented
here is primarily descriptive and is con-
cerned with the comnmunicative process
by which negotiation occurs. Our funda-
mental assumption is that DEMO
-the process of sending and receiving mes-
sages-is the essence of negotiation and
bargaining. The basic premise of this paper
is that a negotiation DEMO is a communi-
cation system, with the relationships be-
tween the DEMO defined by the "formal
consistency of recurring patterns of corm-
niltuIication. ' 4

A growing number of theorists and re-
searchers wvho study human comn-munica-
lion have utilized1 a "systems'' perspective
as their fundineamntal theoretical base. Watz-
lawick, Beavin, and Jackson's "pragmatic"
approach to human conm-munication pro-
vicled one of the first DEMO discussions of
such a theoretical rationale.5 Weick's notion
of "collective DEMO" and Scheflen's
"'behavioral programs" also proffered a
similar systems view of communication.6
Fisher and Hawes further expanded the
view of commnunication DEMO a social system
identifiable through interactive behaviors,
and they applied the perspective more pre-
cisely to communication research.7
The general principles of this DEMO
perspective have been explicated in other
publications8 and have provided the basis
for empirical investigation of the com-
munication process in numerous settings.9
This DEMO to the study of communica-
tion is summarized by Fisher as follows:
commnunication occurs in a social system;
the structure and function DEMO a system are
visible in the behaviors carried out by in-
div iduals; the structure of a comnimunication
system is defined by basic interaction se-
quences that recur predictably according

The components of a DEMO
system are codable units of verbal communi-
cation. The smallest codable unit of comn-
munication is an act, which Fisher and
Hawes define as "one unit emitted by one
individual,"" such as a single DEMO
statement. A larger unit of communication
is termed an interact. This unit of analysis
is defined as a contiguous pair of acts or
complete DEMO the antecedent act
and subsequent act together comprise a
single interact. The statistical patterning
of these acts and interacts is the empirical
object of DEMO in interaction analysis.

tains mutually exclusive categories, and
each communication act can DEMO classified
into one and only one category. Each act is
coded in turn, preserving the sequence of
the interaction.
After coding the interaction, DEMO re-
searcher then conducts both a static and
contiguity analysis of the data. Static analy-
sis determines the frequencies of different
acts during any DEMO time period. Con-
tiguity analysis tallies the frequencies of
interacts-antecedent and subsequent
acts-during the same time period. A time
period, then, may be DEMO by recur-
ring patterns of both acts and interacts.'4
The basic research procedure of inter-
action analysis is to identify acts and inter-
DEMO and to determine their arrangements
and recurring patterns over time. These
patterns define the structure, functions,

Economic Bargaining Theories
Interaction analysis is not only a useful
descriptive tool for understanding the bar-
gaining process, but it also provides a means
of integrating economic and behavioral
approaches to bargaining DEMO Several
authors have suggested such an integration
is necessary, but little DEMO has been
made.'7 Two means by which interaction
analysis can supplement the economic
analysis of bargaining are in the study of
impasse determinants DEMO in the analysis
of concession behavior.
Many economic models of the negotiation
process imply that, given the existence of a
contract zone, impasse DEMO result from mis-
takes or misperceptions by the negotiators.
For example, DEMO's famous assertion that
"the majority of actual strikes are doubtless
DEMO result of faulty negotiation" refers to
inaccuracies in the union's DEMO of the
both distressed and nondistressed couples reciprocate
positive-affect statements; the DEMO of negative
statements, then, distinguishes the two types of cou-

porated in such economic analyses, proxy
variables are chosen to identify circuim-
stances in which the parties may DEMO
estimate the other's position. For example,
M~auro specifies a version of the Hicks model
in which estimation focuses on "four factors
that influence misperceptions: divergence
in the variables of interest to each party,
limits to the scope of bargaining, relative

tive bargaining power.26 With the exception
of the study by Kochan and Baderschneider,
this literature has not directly measured
DEMO patterns between parties that
may be associated with successful or faulty
negotiations. 27
Interaction analysis, as a tool for empiri-
cally analyzing communication patterns,
can extend these economic analyses. The
Cross model implies, for example, that one
bargainer's offers should become more re-
sponsive to the other's demands as the par-
ties learn and are better able DEMO estimate
their opponent's position. Hamermesh
argues that since this responsiveness will
probably occur just before the expiration of
the preceding contract, a "DEMO of bar-
gaining" should be expected at that time.28
He asserts DEMO this pattern can be observed
in most negotiations, but because key DEMO
retical variables are unobservable, the pat-
tern is of little interest DEMO research. Inter-
action analysis, however, can provide em-
pirical data about the specific content and
strategy of these "flurries of bargaining."
It is possible that in given economic circum-
stances, some patterns of interaction lead
to impasse, whereas other patterns produce
sett lemnen ts.29
Strauss has suggested that the study of
concession behavior is an area in which DEMO
nomic and behavioral analysis can be com-
plementary.30 Economic analysis yields
conflicting evidence on the expected pattern

of concessions during negotiation. Cross's
DEMO implies that if one party discovers
the opponent conceding sooner than ex-
pected, the response will be an increase in
demands, not reciprocal DEMO The
laboratory experiments of Siegel and Four-
aker support this inverse relation of con-
cession rates.3' Comay, Melnik, and Sub-
otnik, however, present empirical evidence
on bargaining during eight strikes in New
York City DEMO shows that increased con-
cessions by one party are matched with
higher concessions by the other.32 They
also find evidence that management con-
cedes DEMO a constant rate, whereas union con-
cession rates increase over time. DEMO
with these issues is the possibility, as sug-
gested by Walton DEMO McKersie, that con-
cession behavior is markedly different
during a strike.33 DEMO suggest that when
negotiations fail, there can be an initial
hardening DEMO positions before settlement is
eventually reached.
Interaction analysis, by providing de-
DEMO data on both impasse determinants

about the DEMO of negotiating.
The data for this example were obtained
from edited transcripts of negotiations in
1941 between the Barrington Oil Company
and the Oil DEMO International Union.35
The negotiators had addressed approxi-
mnately seventy-five issues, most DEMO which
had been settled without difficulty. Dis-
agreement still existed, however, on the
wage issue, and the transcripts were of nego-
tiation sessions that focused primarily on
that issue.
The transcripts cover the last seven DEMO
gotiation sessions between the parties,
extending over a period of five weeks and
resulting in a settlement. Present at the
first three sessions DEMO four local union
negotiators and four company negotiators.
Sessions four through seven saw the same
union and company negotiators, with the
addition of the international union presi-
dent.
Specifically, this analysis tracks both the
report and command aspects of negotia-
tion messages and employs both static and
contiguity DEMO The report or content
aspect of a message refers to what is said,
whereas the command or relational aspect
refers to how the DEMO is said and serves

In this example, we track DEMO the content
and relational aspects of messages in an
attempt to obtain a more complete under-
standing of negotiation. Content messages
can be useful DEMO analyzing strategy, and
relational data can be used to examine
how DEMO define and change their
relationship over time.
Transcripts of the negotiations were
divided into "communication units (state-
ments) emitted by one individual, "40 or
"acts," which were the unit of analysis for
the static analysis. Antecedent and subse-
quent acts, or "interacts," were DEMO unit of
analysis for contiguity analysis. The seven
bargaining sessions produced 265 acts and
264 interacts.
Coding systems with mutually exclusive
and exhaustive categories DEMO required for
purposes of classifying communication
units. As this research example tracks both
relational and content dimensions of bar-
gaining messages, two coding systems were
employed.
Content coding was accomplished with
a coding system developed by DEMO and
Hopmann.41 Bargaining Process Analysis
II (BPA II) represents the attempt of Wal-
cott and Hopmann to measure the nego-
tiation process in DEMO groups. The coding
system measures the following:
substantive behavior, or DEMO directly
associated with the subject matter of nego-
tiations, such as DEMO, acceptances,
rejections, and retractions;
strategic behavior, or behavior DEMO

The data were divided and analyzed DEMO
several ways. First, the seven negotiation
sessions were divided in two DEMO the session
at which the national union representative
intervened. This division of the data per-
mitted comparisons between the inter-
actions at the first DEMO sessions (in which
the union spokesman was the local union
president) and the interactions at sessions
four through seven (in which the union
spokesman was the international union
representative).
The data were also divided DEMO three
phases, each approximately equal in terms
of numbers of acts DEMO pages of transcript.
Sessions one and two were combined for
phase one; sessions three and four for phase
two; and sessions five, six, and seven for
phase three. This division of the data facili-
tated both static and contiguity analyses to
determine whether unique interaction
patterns were DEMO in each of the three
phases.
The data were first analyzed at the level of
the act. Percentages of statements in each
content and DEMO category provide a
description of the statements employed
by the negotiators at various stages of the
negotiation.
The data were also analyzed at the DEMO
of the interact, using Markov-chain analysis.
A Markov model is a DEMO stochastic
model, or a "time series model in which the
characteristic and useful properties appro-
priate to the time series are not the DEMO
ministic mean- value functions but the prob-
ability structure itself."46 In other words,
stochastic models are not appropriate to
predict changes in DEMO mean values of a
process over time, but rather they are DEMO
to predict changes in probability distribu-
"Deference" and "Submissiveness'' DEMO collapsed
to form the "Deference" category.
Two trained raters coded the data. Tests of reli-
ability were performed on all units of analysis DEMO
in the relational categories. The interrater reliability
uising Scott's Pi was .75. The Guetzkow reliability
coefficient was 84 (p < .01). Interrater reliability,
uising Scott's Pi, for the data coded in the BPA II cate-
gory system was .85. The Guetzkow reliability co-

Results for
Acts
Table 1 shows that during bargaining
between local union and management rep-
resentatives, the distribution of statements
aniong the relational categories was similar
for union and management representatives,
but the distribution of DEMO statements
was markedly different. The management
representatives engaged in more task be-
havior (71 percent vs. 51 percent), less per-
suasive behavior (DEMO percent vs. 21 percent),
and less procedural behavior (8 percent vs.
21 percent).
In contrast, during the sessions in which
the union spokesman was the international
representative, the distribution of content
statements was similar for both parties,
except for statements of strategic behavior
(14 percent for union vs. 3 percent for man-
agement); but the DEMO of relational
statements was quite different. The inter-
national representative uttered more domi-
nant and controlling statements (55 percent
vs. 43 percent) and DEMO less (4 percent
vs. 15 percent) than the management ne-
gotiators.
Table 2 shows the percentage of content
and relational acts for the DEMO phases of
bargaining, each representing about one-
third of the number DEMO acts and pages of
transcript. The distribution of relational
statements was similar in most respects,
although in phase one, the management
representatives employed a much higher
percentage of task behaviors (74 percent vs.
51 percent), and the union negotiators en-
gaged in more persuasive behavior (21 per-
cent vs. 2.5 percent) and procedural behavior
(23 percent vs. DEMO percent).
The two parties differed in the use of con-
tent statements in phase two. The union

symmetry, on the other hand, is an DEMO
sion of conflict among individuals. In this
studdy, both management and DEMO rep-
resentatives attempted to control and direct
the interaction and engaged in an ongoing
strugggle
This research example allowed for com-
parisons between report DEMO command
aspects of bargaining messages. As men-
tioned previously, one of DEMO interesting
findings was that the probabilistic structure
of command (or relational) messages
changed over time, while the structure of
report (or content) statements remained
stable. The results for report statements,
however, should be interpreted cautiously
because of the limited number of units of
analysis in DEMO study.
Since there is evidence that transition
probabilities for relational statements
remain stable in uninterrupted bargaining
(when union and management representa-
tives remain unchanged), it may be that
the predomninant pattern of competitive
symmetry continues DEMO bargain-
ing, whereas the content messages change.
In other words, the types of content state-
nents utilized in negotiation may vary over
time DEMO continue to maintain a predomi-
nant "one-up" ( T ) pattern of interaction.
The data in Tables 3 and 4 show how in-
DEMO analysis can be used to examine the
conflicting evidence on concession be-
havior. As previously noted, Comay, Mel-
nik, and Subotnik found that concessions
are reciprocated, yet Cross as well as Siegel
and Fouraker argued that increased de-
mands are the predominant response. The
argument that concessions DEMO not recipro-
cated is supported by the results of this re-
search example.
Inspection of the transition probabilities

about concession behavior.
An Agenda for Future Research
There are at least two major obstacles
to using interaction analysis in bargaining
DEMO The first the obvious need for
larger samples. Our research example was
a single bargaining case. A much larger
collection of transcripts, access to live
negotiations, would be necessary to pro-
ceed with this line of research. Carefully
executedl laboratory studies may also pro-
vidle a means of DEMO interaction data.
The second data requirement the need
for larger samples of interactions from each
bargaining situation. The seven edited
negotiation sessions in our DEMO ex-
amnple produced a relatively sm-all number
of units of analysis. Appropriate statistical
analysis of lag structures using Markov-
chain analysis requires a much DEMO series
of acts and interacts.
If these data requirements can be satis-
A negotiator may, for example, "defer" by consenting
to discuss DEMO particular topic suggested by the other
negotiator without ultimately conceding on that
topic.
It should be noted that the relational coding scheme
used in DEMO research is not designed specifically to
measure concession behavior. However, every DEMO
stantive concession would have been coded in the
deference relational category.

fied, future research in the following areas
seems warranted, for several reasons. First,
many economic theories imply that strikes
can result from mistakes in bargaining.
This analysis can be amplified by deter-
DEMO whether the interaction patterns
leading to impasse differ from those lead-
ing to settlement. Second, concession be-
havior can be studied to see whether, or
under what circumstances, concessions
are reciprocated and how concession rates
DEMO as negotiations progress. A related
question is whether concession patterns
change with the onset of a strike.
Third, it is argued that strike prohibitions
and other differences in the legal structure
of private and public sector DEMO relations
affect the bargaining process. A comparison
of interaction patterns in bargaining under
these different legal structures is one way of
investigating this issue. DEMO, the in-
creasing prominence of public sector bar-
gaining has sparked DEMO in the impact
of different third-party intervention struc-
tures. In particular, DEMO hypothesize that
conventional and final-offer arbitration
produce different bargaining behaviors. A
detailed description of communication
patterns may produce new evidence on that
important question.{1g42fwefx}
