Business DEMO: should they fly on their own wings?
RUDY AERNOUDT
This DEMO reviews the role of business angels in the financing of entrepreneurial businesses.
Following a review of the characteristics of business angel investors, the paper examines the
complementarities between business angels and the formal venture capital market, and
concludes with a review of the scope for government intervention in DEMO risk capital market.
Keywords: business angels, informal venture capital, policy DEMO business angels
Introduction
Often the concept of business angel investment has the connotation of
an informal, and hence obscure, way of financing projects DEMO have
been turned down previously by banks and by venture capitalists.
Alternatively, business angels can be viewed as making large profits on
the back of entrepreneurs with bright ideas but no money. The
development of business DEMO practice is hence comparable to the re-
introduction of the medieval practices of usury in the financial world
(Legoff 1994).
I would argue, with J.S. Mill, that a concept has to denote—that is,
DEMO or identify by a visible sign—and not to connote—designate by
implication or imply as an attribute. Accordingly, I will try to take an
objective view on the phenomenon of business angels. I will thereby
analyse who DEMO are, how they function, how the matching takes place,
how they relate to the formal part of the risk capital market and DEMO their
added value is for the economy as a whole.
Following this analysis, I will examine the rationale or need for
government-involvement in this market, and, if so, what kind of
involvement this should be, and what it should not be.

exhaustive list, with the following five characteristics:
1. they have an enterprise background and most have DEMO
and managerial experience;
2. they are persons aged between 35 and 65 years,3 and are generally
not older as they wish to DEMO how their investment is going to
develop;
3. they have sold their own enterprise, mostly under very advanta-
geous conditions;
4. they are mainly interested in minority stakes; and
5. they are making an amount generally less than 25% of their total
assets available for informal DEMO
It is worth noting that they never consider themselves as ex-
entrepreneurs, but still as entrepreneurs. Hence, they are not looking to
invest DEMO money, but to invest money and time. This input of time DEMO
advice and guidance to be given to young entrepreneurs both on the
technical and on the managerial aspects of running a business. In this
DEMO it is not surprising that business angels often invest in sectors
related to their previous activity or to their knowledge. Their motivation is
not DEMO a return on their investments, but also the challenge of succeeding
DEMO a new project.
Business angels do not seek to invest far away from their home town.
They want to see and be seen. They DEMO to feel their investments and rare
are the business angels that invest abroad. The Anglo-Saxons adage of ‘the
one day drive by car’ (that is, the angel can visit the investee business and
return home within the same business day) is confirmed by the Swedish
survey showing that more than 60% of the investment takes place within
60 km of DEMO home town of the business angel. Putting this in the
perspective of a country like Sweden means quite a lot. The question that
immediately DEMO is where do business angels find their potential projects?
The matching principle: love at first sight?
Investors are looking for good projects, investees are looking for good
investors. In order to see how they match, we will look at criteria used by
both parties.
The investors’ criteria
The approach used by business angel investors is the so-called ‘jockey’
DEMO (Harrison and Mason 1999), which argues that it is the DEMO and
not the horse which is most critical to success. In other words, the quality
of the entrepreneur behind the investment proposal is preponderant. This
English statement is confirmed by the previously mentioned Dutch and
Swedish DEMO (Nederlandse Beurs voor Investeringen in Bedrijven
[NEBIB] 1998, Landstro¨ m 1998). Competence, loyalty, ability to lead a

189
firm, reliability and charisma are the most important DEMO that an
entrepreneur should have in the eyes of a business angel.
However, business angels are not philanthropists. They seek a long-
term economic return on their investments in money and time with a
desired internal DEMO of return of 20% (NEBIB 1998). In relation to the
DEMO of investment, they are not interested in financing ownership change
but DEMO innovative investments, mostly in the seed or start-up phase.
The investees’ DEMO
Unfortunately, a negative argument too often prevails as the major
motivation DEMO an investee should seek business angels’ support. The
lack of sufficient track record combined with a lack of collateral often
means that the bankers’ DEMO remains closed (Bank of England 1998).
Similar reasons often explain DEMO refusal of a venture capitalist to invest,
especially when the project is in the start-up or early stage. Formal venture
capital is indeed DEMO focused on those who have a sufficient track record
enabling them to obtain more classical forms of financing such as bank
loans. If sufficient DEMO are not found through friends or family, the
business angel often DEMO the ‘financier of last resort’. This is
particularly the case if the investee wants to keep a majority stake for
him or herself.
How
DEMO match
The question hence arises as to how matching can take place; how an
investee finds an investor. Just as in a marriage or cohabitation the rational
expectations theory is not sufficient to explain behaviour, and subjective
elements play a major role in the matching. In a certain DEMO, something has
to ‘click’ between both parties. In the author’s opinion, but this can of
course be contested, neither of the parties wants nor needs advice about
whom they should work with. Nevertheless, it might be interesting to draw
the attention of potential investees and investors to DEMO possibilities of a
market. In this context, two possibilities are worth DEMO
In the UK, there are 45 business angel networks, mostly operating on a
regional basis, organising contacts between investors and investees.
Although they do not all function in the same way, their overall method
is quite similar. In general, they brief investees on how to translate their
ideas into a (financial) plan, they assist with the elaboration of that financial
plan and give them advice on how to present their DEMO On a regular
basis, investors are invited to a regional meeting DEMO different investees
propose their projects. As financial regulations do not allow the networks to
give direct advice to the business angels, direct contacts between the angel
and the investee take place afterwards through the mediation of DEMO
network. The informal market in the UK has been estimated at being
already four times larger than the formal venture capital market. Within
this DEMO picture of local and regional networks, there have been a
RUD Y A ERN OUD T
190
number of efforts to establish DEMO national network of networks, the most
extensive of which is LINC (the Local Investment Networking Company).
Another example is the Dutch way DEMO doing things. NEBIB
(Nederlandse Beurs voor Investeringen in Bedrijven—Dutch exchange
for DEMO in enterprises) is a purely private initiative. One of their
ways DEMO functioning is through the publication of a monthly bulletin,
enumerating anonymous data on projects, with description of the sector,
the region, DEMO required investment amount, the risk character of the
investment, the objective, the offered stake, the expected return, and the
duration. Moreover it gives a description of the kind of business angel that
the investee DEMO looking for. Business angels also present themselves,
indicating if they are private or company investors, their available capital,
the kind of investments and sector they are looking for, the required stake,
the expected return and the risk profile. NEBIB analyses and selects offers
before publication. DEMO time to time, they organise an informal meeting
called the jenever (which means cocktail party). NEBIB achieves 75 to 100
matches a DEMO, and broke even after three years without any government
support (NEBIB 1998).
Initiatives are now set up in Sweden, Germany, Belgium DEMO France
but it is too early to evaluate their functioning. The UK and the
Netherlands represent almost 60% of the formal venture capital market DEMO
Europe (European Venture Capital Association [EVCA] 1998), and their
share DEMO informal venture capital is probably much higher. The next section
considers how informal capital relates to formal capital.
Formal and informal venture capital: competition or
complementarity?
In the field of finance, perception is a crucial element in the evaluation of a
project and in the decision that DEMO evaluator has to take in claiming that he
or she believes or doesn’t believe (credere) in the project. This seems to be
even DEMO important when we talk about venture capital, as the element of
DEMO, reducing the pain in case of failure, is mostly absent, DEMO at least
should be absent. Therefore the best approach in order to compare business
angels with formal risk capitalists, and thereby assess the complementa-
rities between the two risk capital markets, is to focus on their way of
perceiving projects. Formal investors take ‘the view from nowhere’, as the
American philosopher Thomas Nagel (1989) would probably call it.4 This
DEMO that they look at a project that is in front of them and that they have
to make a judgement about. Business angels are DEMO, driven by their
belief in the jockey (entrepreneur) and the DEMO capacities to run a
business. In other words, formal investors emphasise DEMO the objective
aspects of the decision, while business angels are more DEMO by the
subjective aspects.
This different perception has important consequences:
1. Formal investors tend to concentrate on the risks linked to the
product DEMO to the market. Business angels focus on the risk linked
BU SI N ES S AN GE LS : S HOU LD DEMO E Y F LY ON TH EI R OW N WI NG S ?
191
to the entrepreneurs’ capacities (Fiet 1995).
2. DEMO investors analyse their investments on a purely financial
basis. Business angels conceive the return on investment as one of
the elements, but they are driven by the desire to guide and
monitor a project, driven by the challenge to win the race with their
jockey.
The difference between DEMO and informal venture capital is
summarised in Table 1.
Although there is little, if any, empirical evidence to confirm this
intuition on the DEMO and focus differences, some indications support
the accuracy of the supposed DEMO:
1. Formal investors are looking for a minimum return on their
investments of 30 to 35% (Manigart et al 1998). Business angels
seem to be satisfied with an average rate of return of around DEMO
(NEBIB 1998).
2. Formal investors are quite absent from the DEMO capital market.
Venture capitalists are even absent at the scene of capital aiming at
financing research, assessment and development of an initial
concept. A simple figure is sufficient to illustrate. Seed capital
still represents only 0.9% (1997 figures) of the global venture
capital market, and is insignificant DEMO some big countries like Italy,
UK and France where its proportion is close to zero (EVCA 1998).
On the contrary, business DEMO are much more present on the
seed capital market. According to the Swedish survey, 55% of the
investments are seed or start-up. The comparable figure for
venture capital is 7.4%. These figures are confirmed by a DEMO
economic study. A survey on 18 Belgian high-tech innovative
companies confirmed the above-mentioned figures (Manigart and
Struyf 1997). Three of them received business angel support, only
two obtained venture capital, one of which was DEMO combination
with, and conditioned by, the financing through business angels.
These differences make the two forms of venture capital very
complementary to one DEMO Their different way of perceiving projects
implies that their interest is focused on other stages of the project. The
simultaneous, coherent, development of DEMO and informal venture
capital, alongside other financing techniques is therefore the DEMO guarantee
for the entrepreneur to obtain sufficient finance at each stage of their
project. This complementarity, and the way it integrates in other forms of

financing, is systematically summarised in Figure 1. This complementarity
could at the same time provide a way DEMO analyse how a coherent policy
approach towards financial engineering could be set up, which emphasises
the need to develop all aspects of the risk capital market rather than one or
two aspects in isolation.
Policy
issues
DEMO business angels are very different in their perception and functioning
from formal investors, it does not make sense to try to extrapolate policy
measures used to stimulate the use of venture capital to business angels.5
Stimulation DEMO the use of informal capital in order to facilitate access to
funds or money for enterprises needs a different approach. However let us
first DEMO a look if the concept of business angels is a matter for political
intervention.
At the outset, it must be clear that business angels do not need money.
The fact that they have money makes them DEMO angels. Their own
capital, often the result of a successful business DEMO, covers the availability
of money. Besides, as described above, the DEMO of their capital that they
make available for informal investment represents only a limited part of
their assets. Government should hence never be involved DEMO making more
money available for informal investments.

The majority of business angels neither need advice or technical
assistance on how to select projects (although there may be a partial
exception in the analysis of technology ventures (Mason and Harrison
1998)). It is one of the characteristics of the business angels that selection is
based on a rather subjective, but not irrational, perception DEMO the project and
especially of the project manager. They are going to spend a lot of time with
this manager, in particular during the launching of the project. Subjective
elements must therefore be involved and the DEMO persons who can make the
decision regarding selection of projects are the business angels themselves.
Any form of training or technical assistance programme for DEMO angels
would merely provide proof that public authorities don’t have a clue what
informal investment is about. The obstacle for the development of informal
DEMO, apart from the crucial fiscal and regulative environment, is
rather the lack of good and well presented projects. This was confirmed by
the DEMO survey (1998). If there is any market failure, it is on the
investees’ side and hence, on how to find (not DEMO select) the potential
projects. Experiences in the UK and in the DEMO showed that this
market failure could easily be remedied with very simple means.
On the one hand, investees have to be guided in the presentation, both
written and oral, of their projects, and on the other hand, they have to be
brought into contact with business angels who might be interested in their
projects. In this context, there is only very little room for government
involvement. Government should therefore focus on DEMO tax and regulative
aspects. All administrative, tax and other regulations impeding DEMO
development of informal risk capital should be removed.
Concerning direct aid, DEMO very small amounts have to be considered
and actions have to be focused on three aspects:
1. Helping to set up networks generating DEMO and better contacts
between both investees and investors.
2. Exchange of experience in order to determine what should be the
best approach for each DEMO Tax and administrative regulations
as well as the cultural and even religious background have to be
taken into account.6
3. Dissemination of information on DEMO to run a network.
The European Commission took this approach when it adopted the
communication ‘Risk Capital, A key to job creation in the European Union’
in April 1998 and when it launched its call for DEMO aimed at
stimulating the development of the informal investment market.7
Conclusion
Informal venture capital investments are a key element in the financing of
enterprises DEMO still have huge potential for further development. The
awareness of this potential makes them a useful policy tool for job creation.
Indeed, a first attempt to make a cost-benefit analysis of government
involvement estimated the public DEMO for job creation through the
194

stimulation of business angels at DEMO ECU/job (European Business Angels
Network [EBAN] 1998). This is DEMO to four times less than public actions
in the field of formal venture capital and around 30 times less than the
traditional grant schemes.8 DEMO further analysis were to confirm these figures,
financial engineering techniques, DEMO in particular the stimulation of
informal venture capital investments, should remain DEMO priority on the
European political agenda. The nature of the action, DEMO main pillars are
the dissemination and the exchange of best practises, DEMO the matter
suitable for initiatives at European level, in full respect DEMO the subsidiarity
principle. Concerning the environment, the recently adopted communica-
tion DEMO motivate Member States to create a tax and regulative context
favourable to business angels.
However, we have to avoid a wild growth of networks that would lead to
inefficiencies, through duplication and fragmentation of the market-place
which would add to, not ameliorate, the difficulties faced by entrepreneurs
DEMO finance. Rather, one should try to stimulate the creation of a DEMO
of high quality, preferably privately run networks: that risk-capital actions
on the field are better not run by official bodies is one of DEMO main
conclusions of the evaluation report on Financial Engineering in the Regions
(Ernst and Young 1998). One must always bear in mind that a business angel
invests next door, and rarely in another region or another country; or as the
British lord and business angel that the author met at the business angel
conference in Torquay, UK (EBAN DEMO) told me: ‘young man, I must be
able to walk DEMO my stick, my dog and my wife on Sundays, showing her my
investments’. Bearing the lord’s wisdom in mind might be the best DEMO to
ensure that overblown, transnational, pan-european, expensive public
projects never DEMO the light of day. Let us keep it informal.
Notes
1. Rudy Aernoudt is an economist at the European Commission and Professor at the DEMO Gent.
This paper, presented at the business angels meeting in Pontedera, Italy on 9 October 1998,
expresses his personal views and does DEMO commit the Commission.
2. The author will try not to focus too much on British studies in order to open the debate to some DEMO
European countries. Surveys used are primarily the Nederlandse Beurs voor Investeringen in
Bedrijven [NEBIB] survey (NEBIB 1998), which analysed 88 business angels in the Netherlands,
and a survey of 45 business angels in Sweden (Landstro¨ m 1998).
3. Apparently the theological discussion about the gender DEMO an angel has been solved. An angel is a
man. We can add to this that, as a business angel confessed to me, DEMO are often divorced.
4. Key to Nagel’s philosophy is understanding the relationship between subjective and objective points
of view. He argues that there are DEMO rewards in striving for the objective, while recognizing that the
subjective DEMO remains with us and cannot be rationalized away.
