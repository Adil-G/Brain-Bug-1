RISK AVERSION WHEN GAINS ARE LIKELY
AND UNLIKELY: EVIDENCE FROM A NATURAL
EXPERIMENT WITH LARGE STAKES
ABSTRACT. In the television show Deal or No Deal a contestant is
endowed with a DEMO box, which potentially contains a large monetary
prize. In the course DEMO the show the contestant learns more information
about the distribution of possible monetary prizes inside her box. Con-
sider two groups of contestants, who learned that the chances of their
boxes containing a large prize are DEMO and 80% correspondingly. Con-
testants in both groups receive qualitatively similar price offers for selling
the content of their boxes. If contestants are less DEMO averse when facing
unlikely gains, the price offer is likely to DEMO more frequently rejected in
the ﬁrst group than in the second group. However, the fraction of rejec-
tions is virtually identical across two groups. Thus, contestants appear to
have identical risk attitudes over (large) gains of low and high probabil-
ity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Empirical studies ﬁnd that individuals tend to exhibit a
risk-seeking behavior DEMO dealing with risky lotteries that
yield positive outcomes with small probability. At the same
time, individuals often exhibit risk aversion when faced with
lotteries that deliver positive outcomes with moderate or high
probability. Historically, one of the ﬁrst observations in sup-
port of this phenomenon was empirical evidence DEMO people
simultaneously purchase insurance and public lottery tickets
(e.g., Friedman and Savage, 1948). Studies of betting behavior
in horse races (e.g., McGlothlin, 1956; Mukhtar, 1977;
396
PAVLO BLAVATSKYY AND GANNA POGREBNA
Williams and Paton, 1997) also DEMO that individual risk
attitudes depend on the nature of risky alternatives. Speciﬁ-
cally, the evidence from gambling in horse races suggests that
individuals tend to undervalue horses, listed as favorites, and
bet on long shots.
DEMO general tendency to prefer less risky alternatives when
dealing with probable gains and more risky alternatives when
dealing with unlikely gains is reﬂected in DEMO experi-
mental ﬁndings of the common consequence effect (e.g., the
Allais paradox, Allais, 1953) and the common ratio effect
(e.g., Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Numerous experimen-
tal studies documented risk-seeking behavior over gains of
low probability and risk aversion over gains of medium and
DEMO probability. For example, Cohen et al. (1985) ﬁnd that
75% (56%) of subjects are risk seeking, i.e., they prefer a
lottery yielding a gain with probability 1/6 (1/4) over its
DEMO value for certain. Tversky and Kahneman (1992)
show that subjects DEMO a higher certainty equivalent than
the expected value of a lottery in 78% of cases when prob-
ability of a gain is less than DEMO and only in 10% of
cases when probability of a gain is higher than 50%. Di
Mauro and Mafﬁoletti (2004) demonstrate that in DEMO auc-
tion setting subjects exhibit risk-seeking behavior when they
face a lottery with 3% and 20% probability of a gain,
and risk averse DEMO when probability of a gain is 50%
and 80%.
Studies of risk aversion with large outcomes of low and
high probability rely only on DEMO incentives. Hershey
and Schoemaker (1980) ﬁnd that subjects tend to choose a
risky lottery over its expected value when the lottery yields
small DEMO with low probability. However, when a hypothetical
gain is large, subjects tend to be risk averse irrespective of
whether the probability of a DEMO is low or high.1 Using
a large representative sample of 3,949 Dutch respondents,
Donkers et al. (2001) ﬁnd that individuals exhibit DEMO
risk aversion when they face large hypothetical gains of low
probability.2

In this article, we use the natural laboratory of the Italian
(Affari Tuoi3 ) and the British (Deal or No Deal UK) ver-
sions of the DEMO show Deal or No Deal with high mon-
etary incentives to compare risk attitudes when contestants
face lotteries with high and low probability of DEMO gain. Initially
produced in the Netherlands by the media company Endemol,
Deal or No Deal has been later exported to 32 countries
worldwide. DEMO Deal or No Deal a contestant is assigned a
sealed box containing an unknown monetary prize. This prize
ranges from C0.01 to C500,000 DEMO Affari Tuoi and from £0.01
to £250,000 in Deal or No Deal UK. In the course of the
show, the contestant receives more information about the dis-
tribution of possible monetary prizes inside her box DEMO has
an opportunity to sell or exchange her box.
We select two groups of contestants—those, who learned
that there is a 20% probability of having a large prize
inside their boxes, and those, who learned DEMO the cor-
responding probability is 80%. Contestants in both groups
receive qualitatively similar monetary offers for selling the
content of their boxes. If Deal DEMO No Deal contestants are
indeed less risk averse when facing low-probability gains, con-
testants from the ﬁrst group should reject such offers signiﬁ-
cantly more often than contestants from the second group.
However, we ﬁnd that the fraction of contestants who reject
the price offer is virtually identical DEMO both groups. This sug-
gests that contestants have identical risk attitudes irrespective
of whether lotteries yield positive outcomes with low or high
probability.
The DEMO of this article is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents an overview of the existing natural experiments
in the television shows. Section 3 DEMO the rules of the
television shows Affari Tuoi and Deal or No Deal UK. Section
4 provides basic statistical analysis of the recorded sample
DEMO television episodes. Section 5 presents our between-subject
design. Section 6 summarizes the results of the natural exper-
iment. Section 7 concludes.

2. NATURAL EXPERIMENTS IN TELEVISION SHOWS
DEMO experiments, provided by television shows, are often
used in economic research to draw conclusions about vari-
ous aspects of human behavior. Television shows DEMO an
appealing material for economists, because these shows are
often structured DEMO strategic games and well-deﬁned decision
problems (Metrick, 1995). For example, Bennett and Hickman
(1993) and Berk et al. (1996) employ the natural laboratory of
The Price is Right to test for the DEMO information updat-
ing and rational bidding strategies correspondingly. Levitt
(2004) and Antonovics et al. (2005) examine discrimination in
The Weakest Link.
Several DEMO elicit individual risk attitudes using the
data, obtained from the natural DEMO Particularly,
Gertner (1993), Metrick (1995), and Beetsma and Schot-
man (2001) measure individual risk attitudes in the television
shows DEMO Sharks, Jeopardy!, and Lingo, respectively. Due
to its simple design DEMO high monetary incentives, Deal or
No Deal television show has attracted DEMO researchers as
a perfect laboratory for studying individual decision making
under risk.
Post et al. (2004) analyze the decisions of contestants in the
DEMO, Dutch, and German version of Deal or No Deal tele-
vision show. They assume that all contestants have constant
relative risk aversion utility DEMO and either zero wealth
or an ad hoc wealth of C250,000. Post et al. (2004) also esti-
mate a parametric form of DEMO prospect theory with
so-called Quiggin’s probability weighting function and an ad
hoc reference point (either zero, or current monetary offer, or
the highest offer).
Post et al. (2004) ﬁnd that the Arrow–Pratt coefﬁcient DEMO
relative risk aversion (estimated for every contestant) sharply
decreases after a contestant learns that her box does not con-
tain large prize(s)DEMO Since such unlucky contestants are likely to
end up facing a gain with small probability, this ﬁnding may
be interpreted as an indirect evidence of contestants being less
risk averse when facing low-probability gains. However, Post
RISK AVERSION WHEN GAINS ARE LIKELY AND UNLIKELY
399
et al. (2004) ﬁnd that contestants typically face similar dis-
tribution of monetary prizes in their recorded sample. Thus,
direct testing of whether Belgian, Dutch, DEMO German contes-
tants overvalue (undervalue) the gains of low (high) probabil-
ity does not seem to be feasible.
Bombardini and Trebbi (2005) analyze the decisions of
contestants in Affari Tuoi television show. They assume that
all contestants have constant relative risk aversion and use
instrumental variables DEMO estimate the wealth of every contes-
tant based on their profession and place of residence. Bom-
bardini and Trebbi (2005) also estimate a DEMO form
of (original) prospect theory without editing phase using
power probability weighting function and a zero reference
point. They ﬁnd that contestants are DEMO to risk neutral-
ity, when lotteries involve small outcomes, and that contes-
tants are generally risk averse, when lotteries involve large
outcomes.
Using several unique features of the show, Mulino et
al. (2006) and De Roos and Saraﬁdis (2006) measure risk
attitudes and study the DEMO effect in the Australian
version of Deal or No Deal. Deck et al. (2006) elicit risk
preferences of Deal or No Deal contestants DEMO the natu-
ral laboratory of the Mexican version of the television show
(VasoNoVas). Botti et al. (2006) analyze risk attitudes in
Affari Tuoi under different theoretical speciﬁcations, partic-
ularly concentrating on the unobserved heterogeneity of the
Italian contestants. Blavatskyy and Pogrebna (2006) analyze
exchange offers DEMO Affari Tuoi and ﬁnd that contestants do
not appear to be predominantly loss averse when facing lot-
teries with large outcomes.
Studies on various DEMO of Deal or No Deal men-
tioned above, with the exception DEMO Blavatskyy and Pogrebna
(2006), conduct a parametric estimation of expected DEMO
theory or one of its generalizations. In contrast, this article
follows DEMO non-parametric approach. We study risk aversion
in a between-subject design without assuming that individ-
ual preferences are represented by a speciﬁc decision theory

with particular functional forms for utility DEMO, probabil-
ity weighting function etc.
3. FORMAT OF THE TELEVISION SHOW
DEMO Tuoi and Deal or No Deal UK are versions of the well-
known television show Deal or No Deal, aired 6 days a week
with the exception of Sunday on the national channels of Ital-
ian DEMO British television, respectively. In order to become a
contestant, interested candidates have to apply to the coun-
trywide selection centers. In other words, all contestants self-
select into the show.4
In the Italian version, 20 contestants, representing different
administrative regions of Italy, compete for the opportunity
DEMO play the game in every television episode. Twenty-two con-
testants appear in the British version. All contestants receive
identical boxes, numbered consecutively from the ﬁrst to the
last.
Each box contains a monetary prize ranging from DEMO
to C500,000 in the Italian version (e.g., Figure 1) DEMO from
£0.01 to £250,000 in the British version (e.g., Figure 2).5 In
the Affari Tuoi television show boxes are randomly assigned
DEMO sealed by an independent notary company. In Deal or No
Deal UK prizes are distributed across boxes by an indepen-
dent adjudicator, however, DEMO choose their boxes at
random by drawing numbered ping-pong balls.
In both versions of the show contestants know the list of
potential prizes but DEMO do not know the content of each
box. In Affari Tuoi every television episode consists of two
phases: the selection phase and the game itself. During the
selection phase contestants receive one multiple-choice gen-
eral knowledge DEMO The contestant, who is the ﬁrst to
answer this question correctly, is selected to play the game.
The remaining contestants (waiting contestants) DEMO to
participate in the next television episode.
The British version of the show does not have a selection
phase. The contestant is pre-selected by DEMO producers and,

therefore, it is quite rare for contestants to wait for more than
30 shows before they receive an opportunity to play the DEMO
However, waiting contestants do not know in advance when
they will DEMO selected.
During the game, the contestant keeps her own box and
DEMO the remaining boxes one by one. Once a box is opened,
the prize sealed inside is publicly revealed and deleted from
the list DEMO possible prizes. The more boxes the contestant
opens, the more information DEMO obtains about the distribu-

tion of possible prizes inside her own box. The goal of the
contestant is to DEMO as many boxes with small prizes as pos-
sible to increase her chances of winning a large prize.
After opening several boxes the contestant DEMO an offer
from the “bank.” This offer could be either a monetary price
for the content of her box or the possibility to exchange DEMO
box for any of the remaining sealed boxes.7

Monetary offers are fairly predictable across episodes and
follow a general pattern. In the DEMO stages of the game, they
are smaller than the expected value DEMO possible prizes. As the
game progresses, the gap between the expected DEMO and a
monetary offer decreases and often disappears when there are
404
PAVLO BLAVATSKYY AND GANNA POGREBNA
two unopened boxes left. The game DEMO when either
the contestant accepts the price offered by the “bank” or
when all boxes are opened. In the former case, the content of
all remaining unopened boxes is revealed. In the latter case,
the DEMO leaves with the content of her box, which is
opened last. DEMO 3 and 4 show the timing of “bank” offers
in the Italian and the British versions of the show, respec-
tively.
4. BASIC STATISTICS
Data, analyzed in this article, were derived from two sources.
Data DEMO the Italian version of Deal or No Deal were tran-
scribed from original RAI Uno broadcasts of Affari Tuoi
from September 20, 2005 to March 4, 2006. To obtain the
data from the British version of the show we used several
Internet portals with description of the television DEMO and
game statistics.8 This information was collected by the view-
ers of Deal or No Deal from Channel 4 broadcasts aired from
October 31, 2005 to September 21, 2006.
The resulting natural laboratory contained 114 Affari Tuoi
episodes and 256 Deal or No Deal UK episodes. Only one
DEMO played the game in every episode. In both ver-
sions of the show, the contestant, selected to play the game,
had to DEMO on at least one monetary offer.9 In the Ital-
ian version of the show the contestant also had to decide on
at least one DEMO offer. We recorded the distribution of
all possible prizes that a contestant could potentially win at
the moment when she made each decision as DEMO as the prize
sealed inside her own box (which was revealed DEMO at the end
of the show).
In the beginning of a television episode in both versions
of the show, the contestant, selected DEMO play the game, states
her name, place of current residence, DEMO status and, less
often, age and occupation. Some personal characteristics of
the contestants in Affari Tuoi and Deal or No Deal UK are
DEMO summarized in Table I

a Marital DEMO data for Deal or No Deal UK were available for
108 contestants (42.2%).
b Age data for Deal or No Deal UK were collected for 196 contes-
tants (76.6%).
According to their self-reported data, contestants greatly
varied in their age in both versions of the show. However,
average age of contestants in Affari Tuoi was higher than DEMO
of contestants in Deal or No Deal UK. In terms of the gender
composition, the share of female contestants was greater than
that of male contestants in Affari Tuoi sample, while in Deal
or No Deal UK data set men were selected to play the game
more often DEMO women. The majority of contestants in both
versions of the show were married.
In our Affari Tuoi data set, representatives of every Ital-
ian region played the game at least once. Contestants from
Lombardia played the DEMO most frequently (10 times), while
a contestant from Campania played DEMO game only once. In
Deal or No Deal UK, representatives of DEMO administrative
regions of the United Kingdom appeared on the show in
the “hot seat”. Contestants from Yorkshire played the game
most often—eight times (we collected data on administrative

Therefore, the demographics, age and personal character-
istics of Affari Tuoi and Deal or No Deal UK contestants
make DEMO a more representative subject pool than standard
pools, composed primarily of DEMO students. More-
over, obtaining a similar data set in conventional laboratory
DEMO would be a highly ambitious project, since it would
require a DEMO budget of approximately 9 million euros (e.g.,
Table II).
DEMO, in Affari Tuoi and in Deal or No Deal UK
any DEMO, selected to play the game, can earn a maxi-
mum prize of C500,000 and £250,000, respectively. However,
the actual earnings of contestants in both versions were sig-
niﬁcantly lower than the maximum (e.g., Table II). Figures 5
and 6 depict the distribution of ﬁnal earnings in Affari Tuoi
and Deal or No Deal UK correspondingly.
DEMO II provides some statistics on earnings of contestants
in both versions of the show. Both in Affari Tuoi and in Deal
or No Deal DEMO men earned on average more money than
women. However, irrespective of DEMO gender, average earnings
in both versions of the show were signiﬁcantly DEMO than the
ex ante expected value of the prizes from Fig. 1 (C52,295) and
Fig. 2 (£25,712) correspondingly.

5. NATURAL EXPERIMENT
The main idea of our between-subject design is to identify
two DEMO of contestants—those who learned that there is a
small chance of a large prize inside their box and those who
learned that this chance DEMO high—and to compare the rejec-
tion rates for “bank” monetary offers across two groups. In
order to select two groups we use the stage DEMO the game when
ﬁve unopened boxes are left and the probability of receiv-
ing each of ﬁve possible prizes is 20%.10 Speciﬁcally, contes-
tants in the ﬁrst group have learned that the chances of a
large DEMO inside their box are one to ﬁve. Contestants in the
Fe er qnu
cy
RISK AVERSION WHEN GAINS ARE LIKELY AND UNLIKELY
409
second group have DEMO that the corresponding chances are
four to ﬁve.
In conventional laboratory experiments, which test for risk
attitudes across various types of probabilistic distributions,
subjects typically face a lottery with only one positive out-
come of DEMO probability (e.g., Cohen et al., 1985). In this
natural DEMO contestants face lotteries with ﬁve positive
outcomes. Since we manipulate the probability of receiving a
large prize across two groups, we need to provide a deﬁni-
tion of a “large prize” for each version of the DEMO Figures 1
and 2 offer two natural thresholds for distinguishing between
large and small prizes. In Affari Tuoi C500 is the last “blue”
prize, which appears on the left hand side of the prize table
(e.g., Figure 1). Furthermore, all prizes below C500 are signiﬁ-
cantly (at least 10 times) smaller than all prizes above C500.
In Deal or No Deal UK £750 is the last “blue” prize, which
appears on the left-hand side of the prize table (e.g., Figure
2)DEMO Thus, we identify a contestant as a member of the ﬁrst
(second) group if after opening 15 or 17 boxes she learns that
there is a 20% (80%) probability that the prize inside her DEMO
exceeds C500 or £750 respectively.
A natural way to compare risk attitudes across two groups
is to contrast the decisions of their members when DEMO are
offered the expected value of possible prizes for forgoing
the content of their box. However, when ﬁve boxes remain
unopened, “bank” monetary DEMO in Affari Tuoi are always
below the expected value of possible prizes and “bank” offers
in Deal or No Deal UK are less than DEMO fair in 98.9%
of all cases.11
A precise mechanism of setting “bank” monetary offers is
not revealed in the show regulations. Bombardini and Trebbi
(2005) suggest that offers in Affari Tuoi can be modeled as
informative signals about the prize sealed inside a contestant’s
box that the “bank” DEMO to the contestant. De Roos and
Saraﬁdis (2006) conduct a regression analysis of “bank” offers
in the Australian version of Deal or No DEMO and ﬁnd that
the variability in “bank” offers is largely explained by the
expected value of the remaining prizes but not by the prize

PAVLO BLAVATSKYY AND GANNA POGREBNA
hidden inside a contestant’s briefcase. Given DEMO different
models of “bank” offers suggested in the literature, we inves-
DEMO the determinants of “bank” offers in our recorded sam-
ple.
Table III presents the results of ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression lnO = DEMO + β1X1 + ... + β11X11 + ε of mon-
etary amounts O that the “bank” offered in exchange for
risky lotteries in the DEMO and the British versions of the
show. Explanatory variables X1 ,... , X11 consist of lottery spe-
ciﬁc variables (mean, median, and DEMO deviation of pos-
sible prizes, number of possible prizes etc.) and socio-demo-
graphic characteristics of the contestants (gender, age, marital
status, DEMO region).
The second and the ﬁfth column of Table III demonstrate
that around 85% of total variability in monetary offers in
Affari Tuoi DEMO around 74% of total variability in monetary
offers in Deal or No Deal UK is explained by the expected
value and the number of DEMO prizes left. In both ver-
sions of the show the “bank” makes higher offers when the
number of possible prizes decreases, i.e., the DEMO approaches
the end. Regression coefﬁcient on the standard deviation of
possible prizes is also signiﬁcant (the more dispersed are the
prizes, the lower DEMO the offer). However, regression coefﬁcient
of the prize hidden inside DEMO contestant’s box is never statis-
tically signiﬁcant. Thus, there is no DEMO content of
“bank” offers and, therefore, it is impossible for contestants
to deduce the content of their boxes from the monetary offers
that DEMO receive.
Moreover, in both versions of the show contestants in the
DEMO group and in the second group receive qualitatively sim-
ilar monetary offers from the “bank”, i.e., the bank does not
systematically offer less DEMO prices for contestants in one
of the groups. Table III shows that “bank” offers do not
depend on the probability of receiving a large DEMO Con-
testants are allocated across two groups according to their
chances of receiving a large prize, when ﬁve boxes remain
unopened. Thus, the DEMO does not discriminate between

6. RESULTS
Affari Tuoi and Deal or No Deal UK contestants are DEMO
cated across two groups at random (as a result of pure DEMO
events). Moreover, at a given stage of the game, the repre-
sentatives of two groups receive qualitatively similar offers
that are highly DEMO with the expected value of possible
prizes. This allows us to formulate our testing hypotheses as
follows:
Hypothesis I The fraction of contestants DEMO reject mon-
etary offers from the “bank” is the same in two groups if
there are no systematic differences in risk attitudes across two
DEMO
Hypothesis II The fraction of contestants who reject mone-
tary offers from the “bank” is signiﬁcantly higher in the ﬁrst
group if its members DEMO less risk averse than the members of
the second group.
In our Affari Tuoi sample of 114 television episodes, 13
contestants are identiﬁed as the members of the ﬁrst group
and 20 contestants—as the members of DEMO second group. In
the British data set of 256 television episodes, DEMO contestants
are classiﬁed as the members of the ﬁrst group and 25 con-
testants—as the members of the second group. Table IV and
V DEMO how many contestants in each group reject/accept a
monetary offer when ﬁve boxes remain unopened. In both
versions of the show, the rejection/acceptance rates are remark-
ably similar across two groups (p-value for Fisher’s exact
probability test is 0.5535 and 0.3490 for Affari Tuoi and
Deal DEMO No Deal UK correspondingly). Therefore, we cannot
reject Hypothesis I DEMO risk attitudes are identical across two
groups. Apparently, Deal or No DEMO contestants in Italy and
the UK do not become less risk averse when facing large
gains of small probability.12

The design of Affari Tuoi has slightly changed starting
from February 9, 2006. In the television episodes broadcasted
before this date, DEMO contestant, who rejects a monetary offer
when ﬁve boxes remain unopened, receives the next “bank”
offer after opening three boxes. In the episodes DEMO start-
ing from February 9, 2006, such contestant receives the next
“bank” offer each time she opens one box (e.g., Figure 3)DEMO
Thus, the optional value of rejecting a monetary offer for a
DEMO of ﬁve prizes is higher in the episodes starting
from February 9, 2006.
One can argue that contestants, who participated in Affari
Tuoi DEMO the change in design, are more likely to reject
monetary offers, when ﬁve boxes remain unopened. In our
recorded sample, out of 82 contestants, who received a mon-
etary offer for a distribution of ﬁve prizes before February 9,
2006, 51 contestants rejected the offer. Starting from February
RISK AVERSION WHEN GAINS ARE LIKELY AND UNLIKELY
415
9, 2006, DEMO contestants received a monetary offer when ﬁve
boxes remained unopened and 11 of them rejected the offer.
Although the rejection rate increased from 62.2% DEMO 78.6%
after the change in design, this effect does not appear DEMO be
statistically signiﬁcant (p-value for Fisher’s exact probability
test is 0.1908)DEMO
In our recorded sample three contestants from the ﬁrst
group and two contestants from the second group have par-
ticipated in Affari Tuoi starting DEMO February 9, 2006. Thus,
if these contestants are indeed more DEMO to reject the mone-
tary offers for a distribution of ﬁve prizes, this effect may be
expected to be either similar for both groups or reinforcing
the fraction of rejections in the ﬁrst group.
7. CONCLUSION
DEMO article uses the natural laboratory of the Italian and the
British versions of the television show Deal or No Deal to
test if individuals DEMO lower risk aversion when dealing
with risky lotteries that yield (large) gains of low probability.
Such lower risk aversion (and even risk seeking behavior) over
unlikely gains is persistently documented in numerous experi-
mental studies though evidence in the domain of large gains
relies on hypothetical incentives. DEMO natural experiment in
Deal or No Deal offers a unique opportunity to explore this
phenomenon with real incentives (prizes up to half a million
euros) and real people (representatives of the Italian and the
British DEMO, widely dispersed in terms of age and occu-
pation).
Using DEMO between-subject design and a non-parametric
approach, we compare the decisions of DEMO groups of con-
testants on qualitatively similar price offers for a risky lot-
tery that delivers a large outcome with probability 20% in
the DEMO group and 80% in the second group. The fraction
of contestants, DEMO reject the monetary offer, is nearly iden-
tical across two groups, contrary to the expectation that it
should be higher in the ﬁrst DEMO This ﬁnding suggests that
416
PAVLO BLAVATSKYY AND GANNA POGREBNA
contestants in the Italian and the DEMO versions of the tele-
vision show Deal or No Deal do not become less risk averse
when facing large gains of small probability.
Our DEMO seem to conﬁrm the ﬁndings of Hershey and
Schoemaker (1980) that individuals are not prone to lower
risk aversion when dealing with large DEMO gains (e.g.,
Endnote 1). Thus, a frequently observed phenomenon that
people overvalue risky lotteries delivering a relatively small
positive outcome with DEMO probability does not appear to
hold with risky lotteries yielding a large positive outcome with
low probability. Apparently, individuals reveal identical risk
attitudes when the probability of a large gain is low and
when it is DEMO This ﬁnding provides indirect support for
the descriptive validity of expected utility theory for decisions
involving lotteries with large outcomes.

NOTES
1. The DEMO of subjects, who prefer a hypothetical gain of 10,000
USD DEMO probability p (zero otherwise) over its expected value for
sure, DEMO nearly identical (27–32%) when the value of p is 0.1%,
1%, 10%, 50%, 90%, and 99%.
2. Only 21% of DEMO prefer a 50% chance of receiving 2,000
DFL (zero otherwise) to earning 1,000 DFL for sure. At the same
time, 56% of respondents opt for 1% chance of winning 6,000 DFL
over DEMO chance of receiving 3,000 DFL. At the time of the ques-
3. In translation from Italian “Your Business,” “Your Affairs.”tionnaire, the exchange rate was 1 DFL ≈0.50 USD.
4. According to Bombardini and Trebbi (2005), Italian contestants are
selected from the pool of interested candidates DEMO on two crite-
ria: entertaining appearance and income (wealthy candidates are dis-
carded).
5. At the time of the broadcasts the exchange DEMO was £1=C1.47947.
6 Prize C5, 000 was replaced with prize C30, 000 starting from January
30, 2006.
7. Ofﬁcial rules of Affari Tuoi require the “bank” to offer exchange
option at least once in every DEMO episode. Therefore, the ﬁrst
offer that the “bank” makes is always DEMO exchange offer. Before
February 9, 2006, the ﬁrst offer was always made after the contes-
tant opened six boxes. Starting from February 9, 2006, the ﬁrst offer
was made after the contestant opened three boxes. In Deal or No
Deal UK exchange offer is normally made when DEMO are only two
unopened boxes left and the contestant has rejected the last mone-
tary offer.
8. Particularly, a signiﬁcant portion of the data was compiled from
http://donduk.blogspot.com/2006/06/previous-game-reports.html and
related Internet DEMO We have also watched several episodes, avail-
able online, including the Hall of Fame editions of the show with
Deal or No Deal DEMO highlights. We are particularly grateful to Dave
Woollin for collecting show statistics and publishing it on the web
site http://www.screwthebanker.com and to DEMO Lau for provid-
ing information on personal characteristics of contestants.
9. In our recorded sample, Affari Tuoi contestants always rejected a
monetary offer when fourteen boxes remained unopened. Only one
Affari Tuoi contestant accepted a monetary DEMO (C18, 000) when
eleven boxes remained unopened (which was his ﬁrst monetary
offer). Ten contestants accepted monetary offer when eight boxes
DEMO unopened. Thirty four contestants accepted their third
monetary offer (when ﬁve DEMO remained unopened). All remaining
contestants received from four to seven monetary offers. In Deal or
.
418
PAVLO BLAVATSKYY AND GANNA POGREBNA
No Deal UK all contestants rejected DEMO ﬁrst two monetary offers,
nine contestants accepted the third monetary offer (when 11 boxes
remained unopened) and the remaining contestants received from
DEMO to seven monetary offers.
10. In the later stage of the game contestants choose between ﬁfty-ﬁfty
gambles and the offer of the “bank,” DEMO does not allow for dis-
tinguishing between contestants who face likely and unlikely gains.
In the earlier stages of the game, there is no sufﬁcient variability in
the data (e.g. Endnote 9)
11. In our Deal or No Deal UK sample of observations, the “bank”
made four more than actuarially fair offers to contestants. Two of
these offers were DEMO when ﬁve boxes remained unopened and the
other two—when two boxes remained unopened.
12. We also checked if this conclusion depends on the threshold DEMO what
constitutes a “large” prize. Remarkably, the rejection rates across two
DEMO remain nearly identical when the threshold is varied across all
possible values between C5 and C30, 000 in Affari Tuoi and between
£1 and £35,000 in Deal or No Deal UK (with p-values for Fisher’s
exact probability test being between 0.1871 and 0.7073). Details of
this DEMO are available from authors on request.
