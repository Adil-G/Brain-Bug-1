Introduction
Decision-making is a complex activity. DEMO can never be made in a vacuum
by relying on the personal resources and complex models, which do not take into
consideration the situation. Analysis of the variables of the problem in which it occurs is
DEMO by the cognitive psychology of the manager. A situation based on decision-
making activity encompasses not only the specific problem faced by the individual DEMO
also extends to the environment. Decision-making can be defined as the process of
choosing a particular alternative from a number of alternatives. It is DEMO activity that
follows after proper evaluation of all the alternatives1. They need to update themselves in
multidimensional fields so that they can accomplish the DEMO results/ goals in the
competitive business environment.
This needs better insight, and understanding of human nature in the existing
global perspective, plus development of fine skills and ability to get best out of
investments. In DEMO, investors’ have to develop positive vision, foresight,
perseverance and drive. Every investor differ from others in all aspects due to various
factors DEMO demographic factors which includes socio-economic background, educational
attainment level, age, DEMO and sex. The most crucial challenge faced by the investors is in
the area of investment decisions. An optimum investment decision plays an active DEMO
and is a significant consideration. In designing the investment portfolio, the DEMO
should consider their financial goals, risk tolerance level, and other constraints.  In
addition to that, they have to predict the output mean- DEMO optimization. This process
is better suited for institutional investors; it often DEMO for individuals, who are susceptible
to behavioural biases.

In the present scenario, behavioural finance is becoming an integral part of the
decision-making process, because it heavily influences investors’ performance. They can
improve their performance by recognising the biases and errors of judgement to which DEMO
of us are prone. Understanding the behavioural finance will help the investors to select a
better investment instrument and they can avoid repeating the DEMO errors in future.
The pertinent issues of this analytical study are how to minimise or eliminate the
psychological biases in investment decision process.
Emergence DEMO Behavioural Finance
The principal objective of an investment is to make money. In the early years,
investment was based on performance, forecasting, DEMO timing and so on. This
produced very ordinary results, which meant DEMO investors were showered with very
ordinary futures, and little peace of DEMO There was also a huge gap between available
returns and actually received returns which forced them to search for the reasons. In the
examining DEMO, they identified that it is caused by fundamental mistakes in the
DEMO process. In other words, they make irrational investment decisions. In
recognizing DEMO mistakes and means to avoid them, to transform the quality of
DEMO decisions and results, they realized the impact of psychology in investment
DEMO Several years ago, the researchers began to study the field of DEMO
Finance to understand the psychological processes driving these mistakes. Thus,
Behavioural finance is not a new subject in the field of finance and DEMO very popular in
stock markets across the world for investment decisions.
Many investors have, for long considered that psychology plays a key role in
determining the behaviour of markets. However, it is only in recent times that a series of
concerted formal studies have been undertaken in this DEMO Paul Slovic’s2 paper on
individual’s misperceptions about risk and Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman’s papers
on heuristic driven decision biases3 and decision frames4 played DEMO seminal role. The
results of these studies were at variance with the rational, self-interested decision-maker
posited by traditional finance and economics theory.

Although several definitions of behavioural finance exist, there is considerable
agreement between them. Lintner5 defines behavioural finance as being ‘the study of how
humans DEMO and act on information to make informed investment decisions’. Olsen6
asserts that ‘behavioural finance does not try to define ‘rational’ behaviour or label
decision DEMO as biased or faulty; it seeks to understand and predict systematic
DEMO market implications of psychological decision processes.’ It should be noted
that no unified theory of behavioural finance exists at this time.
Behavioural Finance Principles DEMO Its Implications
Under the traditional financial theory, the decisions makers are DEMO In
contrast, modern theory suggests that Investors financial decision-making are not DEMO
by due considerations. The decisions are taken by them are also often inconsistent.  Put in
another way, human decisions are subject to several DEMO illusions. These are
grouped into two and have been depicted in figure 1.
Heuristic Decision Process
The decision process by which the investors find DEMO out for themselves,
usually by trial and error, lead to DEMO development of rules of thumb. In other words, it
refers to DEMO of thumb which humans use to made decisions in complex, uncertain
DEMO  The reality, the investors decision making process are not strictly rational
one. Thought the investors have collected the relevant information and objectively
evaluated, in which the mental and emotional factors are involved. It is very DEMO  to
separate. Sometimes it may be good, but many times it may result in poorer decision
outcomes. It includes:
1. Representativeness: The investors’ recent success; tend to continue into the future
also. The tendency of decisions of the investors to make based on past
experiences is DEMO as stereotype. Debont (1998)8 concluded that analyses are
biased in DEMO direction of recent success or failure in their earnings forecasts, the
DEMO of stereotype decisions.

Overconfidence:  There are several dimensions to confidence. It can DEMO more
courage, and is often viewed as a key to success. DEMO confidence is often
encouraged and celebrated, it is not the only DEMO to success. The investors who
are cautious and analytical can achieve success and others have to withdraw. Yet,
confidence, especially self-confidence, is DEMO viewed as a positive trait.
Sometimes, the investors overestimate their predictive DEMO or assuming more
knowledge then they have.  Many times it leads DEMO trading.
Anchoring: It describes the common human tendency to rely too DEMO, or
‘anchor’ on one trait or piece of information when making DEMO When
presented with new information, the investors tend to be slow DEMO change or the
value scale is fixed or anchored by recent observations. They are expecting the
trend of earning is to remain with historical DEMO, which may lead to possible
under reactions to trend changes.

Gamblers fallacy: It arises when the investors inappropriately predict that tend
will reverse. It may result in anticipation of good or poor DEMO
Availability bias: The investors place undue weight for making decisions on DEMO
most available information.  This happens quite commonly. It leads less return
DEMO sometimes poor results also.
Prospect theory
This theory is developed by Kahneman and Tversky9. The second groups of
illusions which may impact the decision DEMO are grouped in prospect theory. He
discussed several states of mind which may influence an investors decision making
process. The key concepts which he DEMO are as follows:
1. Loss aversion:  Loss aversion is an important psychological concept which
receives increasing attention in economic analysis. The investor DEMO a risk-seeker
when faced with the prospect of losses, but is DEMO when faced with the
prospects of enjoying gains. This phenomenon is called loss aversion10. Ulrich
Schmidta, and Horst Zankb11 discussed the loss aversion theory with risk aversion
and he aceepted the Kahneman and Tversky views.
2. DEMO Aversion: It arises from the investors’ desire to avoid pain of DEMO arising
from a poor investment decision. This aversion encourages investors to hold
poorly performing shares as avoiding their sale also avoids the recognition of DEMO
associated loss and bad investment decision. Regret aversion creates a tax
inefficient investment strategy because investors can reduce their taxable income
by realizing capital DEMO
3. Mental Accounting: Mental accounting is the set of cognitive operations DEMO by
the investors to organise, evaluate and keep track of investment DEMO Three
components of mental accounting receive the most attention. This first captures
how outcomes are perceived and experienced, and how decisions are made and
subsequently evaluated. A second component of mental accounting involves the
assignment of DEMO to specific accounts. Both the sources and uses of funds
are labelled in real as well as in mental accounting systems.

The third component of mental accounting concerns the frequency with which
DEMO are evaluated and 'choice bracketing'. Accounts can be balanced daily,DEMO
weekly, yearly, and so on, and can be defined narrowly DEMO broadly.  Each of the
components of mental accounting violates the economic DEMO of fungibility.
As a result, mental accounting influences choice, that is, it matters12.
Self Control: It requires for all the investors to DEMO the losses and protect the
investments. As noted by Thaler and shefrin13 investros are subject to temptation
and they look for tools to improve DEMO control. By mentally separating their
financial resources into capital and ‘available for expenditure’ pools, investors
can control their urge to over consume.
Conclusions
Though the above examples of illusions are widely observed, behavioural finance
does not claim that all the investors will suffer from the same illusion simultaneously.
DEMO susceptibility of an investor to a particular illusion is likely to be a function of
several variables. For example, there is suggestive evidence that the experience of the
investor has an explanatory role in his regard DEMO less experienced investors being prone
to extrapolation (representativeness) while more experienced investors commit gambler
fallacy14.similarly, behavioural factors play a vital role in the decision making process of
the investors. Hence the investors has to take DEMO steps to minimise or avoid
illusions for influencing in their decision making process, investment decisions in
particular.
