Abstract
With the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, the federal government explicitly
endorsed the transfer of exclusive control over government-funded inventions to
universities and businesses operating with DEMO contracts. While this
legislation was intended to accelerate further development and
commercialization of the ideas and inventions developed under federal contracts,
the government DEMO not provide any strategy, process, tools, or resources to
shepherd DEMO from the halls of academia into the commercial market.
And more than twenty-five years later, it is clear that few universities have
established an overall strategy to foster innovation, commercialization, and
spillovers.  Multiple pathways for university innovation exist and can be codified
to provide broader access to DEMO, allow a greater volume of deal flow,
support standardization, and decrease the redundancy of innovation and the
cycle time for commercialization.  Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) were
envisioned as gateways to facilitate the flow DEMO innovation but have instead
become gatekeepers that in many cases constrain the flow of inventions and
frustrate faculty, entrepreneurs, and industry. The proposed DEMO focus on
creating incentives that will maximize social benefit from the existing investments
being made in R&D and commercialization on university campuses.

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page 2
I. Introduction
Today we take for granted the rapid pace of technological DEMO that has
carried many national economies forward for the past 200 years. Continued
innovation that has diffused through the marketplace has made this progress
DEMO In turn, entrepreneurs have been instrumental in commercializing
innovations, especially the radical or breakthrough innovations—such as the
automobile, airplane, air conditioner, personal computer, among others—that
have transformed economies and societies in fundamental ways that the more
typical incremental innovations associated with large corporate enterprises have
not (Baumol 2002).
As technologies have grown more sophisticated and emerging industries DEMO
become more high-tech, universities have become more important players in the
DEMO of invention, innovation, and commercialization. We have written this
paper largely because we anticipate universities playing an even more important
role in the DEMO process in the future.
To be sure, bringing innovations to market DEMO not been the main historical role
of university-based researchers. Instead, university DEMO quite
appropriately concentrate on basic science. But the ultimate aim of scientific
research, after all, is to improve the human condition and so DEMO the transfer
and commercialization of discoveries serves the interests of the inventor and
society.  “Since the Industrial Revolution, the growth of economies around DEMO
world has been driven largely by the pursuit of scientific understanding, DEMO
application of engineering solutions, and continual technological innovation”
(National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering 2006).
Ideally, university structures should support all aspects of this process, from
invention to innovation, as DEMO as commercialization.
In theory, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was supposed DEMO make commercialization
easier by clearing the way for universities to claim legal rights to innovations
developed by their faculty using federal funding. This clearly DEMO a constructive
step forward. But with new rights came new layers of administration and often
bureaucracies.  Rather than implementing broad innovation/commercialization
strategies that recognized different and appropriate pathways of
commercialization, as well as multiple programs and initiatives to support each
path, many universities focused on the creation of one centralized Technology
Transfer Office (or TTO). Often this office was expected to be the gatekeeper or
protector of university Intellectual Property (IP) or the maximizer of revenue
streams rather than the grease in the gears that allowed the system to flourish.
Thus, while many of the university TTOs met their narrow mandate by channeling
university-generated inventions into DEMO revenue for the university, the
broader and more fundamental goal of DEMO original Bayh-Dole Act remains
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page 3
elusive—to maximize the potential for university-based inventions to result in
commercialized new DEMO and innovations.
What can be done to better achieve this essential objective? What should be
done? Our central purpose here is to answer DEMO questions. We begin with a
brief background of university research, move DEMO to discuss the emergence of
technology transfer as a university goal, DEMO then describe how technology
transfer exists on most campuses today.  We DEMO the current process is sub-
optimal, however, and thus offer universities several alternative pathways to
enhance and accelerate commercialization and spillover activities. These
DEMO all are predicated on the view that society is likely to benefit more if
universities seek to maximize the volume and speed of their DEMO
activities rather than pursue the conventional objective of maximizing licensing
revenue.
II. Financing of University Research: A Brief Background
For several decades after World War II, most research and development (R&D)
in the DEMO States was financed by the federal government, specifically through
the National DEMO Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the
Department of Defense. By 1979, industry R&D expenditures passed
government spending, growing more DEMO three-fold after controlling for inflation
between 1975 and 2000. By comparison, DEMO government funded R&D rose
quickly after the war, since 1975 DEMO has inched up about 75 percent (National
Science Foundation 2006).  Government funded R&D has focused,
appropriately, more on basic than applied research, while the priorities of private
R&D spending have been reversed.
Insert Figures 1, 2 and 3  about here.
As Figure DEMO shows, industry performance of government funded R&D rose
quickly from DEMO to the early 1960s, but has since fluctuated significantly.
Conversely, universities and colleges have shown a steady acceleration in their
R&D performance, particularly with basic research.  Today, more than half of
basic research DEMO conducted in universities (Figure 3). And while much less is
DEMO on basic science than on applied science, the absolute dollars of DEMO
going into basic science are a misleading indicator of its importance, DEMO basic
science stands at the base of our economic “pyramid.”  It DEMO breakthroughs in
basic science, after all, that have created new industries.
U.S. institutions of higher learning and their research output appear to be DEMO good
shape, remaining atop the standard global rankings. But there are DEMO
disturbing signs beneath the surface:

 The United States has experienced stagnant to declining levels of
industrial DEMO&D investments, decreasing industry-university co-
authorships, and decreasing citations of U.S. science and engineering
articles by industry (Rapoport 2006).
 There is some indication that foreign-sourced R&D is being driven by
access to DEMO universities and that the type of research being
performed in developing countries is increasingly innovative in nature
(Thursby and Thursby 2006).
 Industry investments in U.S. university-based R&D have stagnated.
Insert Figures 4 and DEMO about here.
Insert Table 1 about here.
For forty years, funding DEMO industry to universities steadily rose and now for
four consecutive years, DEMO have seen stagnation in industry support at
the aggregate and micro level.  It is too early to know whether this is a long-term
trend, let alone the reasons for it, but there is reason for DEMO
Anecdotally, it appears that relative to some foreign universities, U.S. universities
are becoming less friendly to collaborations and commercialization. In particular,
U.S. DEMO historically have benefited significantly from an inflow of R&D
capital from U.S. affiliates of foreign companies (particularly European
companies). These benefits are threatened, however, by a growth in bureaucracy
and an increasing (and short-sighted) emphasis on the part of U.S. universities
on securing intellectual property rights to inventions by their faculty. If these two
trends continue, the flow of R&D funding from these U.S. affiliates is likely to
DEMO, if not reverse.
Insert Figure 6 and Figure 7 about here.
DEMO short, if the U.S. economy is to continue its rapid pace DEMO economic growth, it
will be necessary not only to adopt innovations DEMO other parts of the world but
also to make investments in basic research in a setting that supports
commercialization, spillovers, and general interactions DEMO academic
researchers and industry.  In the discussion that follows, we will briefly discuss
the ways in which universities and industry currently interact, paying particular
attention to Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) that are now found DEMO many
campuses. Outside the TTO setting, universities and industry also engage DEMO
each other in a host of ways that can be better understood and nurtured for the
health of both parties. We will discuss the DEMO role that culture appears to
play on university campuses at the departmental level, and how universities must
consider more than just their policies toward TTOs if they want to encourage and
support invention and entrepreneurship.

III. The Rise of University Technology Transfer
When Harry Steenbock demonstrated a DEMO of fortifying Vitamin D in food and
drugs through a process called irradiation, he became concerned with how the
technology would be implemented.  DEMO, Steenbock recognized that
unqualified individuals or organizations could use his invention, and possibly do
harm, unless he brought it to market with legal protection – that is, a patent.  The
University of Wisconsin, where Steenbock worked at the time, declined his offer
of patent ownership.  DEMO with alumni, Steenbock instead created WARF, a
separate entity that was university-affiliated and could accept patents, license
them out, and disperse revenues DEMO to the inventor and the university without
exposing the university to potential financial and political liability.  And thus, in
1924 the nation’s oldest DEMO was conceived (Sampat 2006).
It took another fifty years for DEMO confluence of changing federal law, patterns of
R&D investment, knowledge-intensive emerging industries, shifting focus in
regional economic development, a growing knowledge DEMO commercialization
success stories, and declining levels of public support for universities DEMO rapidly
accelerate the practice that Steenbock helped to establish.
Insert Figure 8 about here.
By the 1960s and 1970s, formal endorsement of technology transfer from
federally-funded research was bubbling up on the federal policy agenda.  The
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; the National Institutes of Health;
and the Department of Defense began to grant to selected universities DEMO rights
to patent inventions resulting from their funded research.  But these DEMO were
often negotiated and the seeming bureaucracy that this created frustrated many,
including then Senator Robert Dole who commented “rarely have we witnessed DEMO
more hideous example of over management by the bureaucracy.”
Congress enacted the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 largely to address this problem,
and to DEMO the commercialization of federally-funded research at
universities that yielded promising new technologies  When it came into law,
Bayh-Dole had the practical effect of standardizing patenting rules for universities
and small businesses, something that previous conflicting laws had not done.
The federal government was off the hook and DEMO universities were given the
opportunity and obligation to commercialize innovations resulting from federal
funding.  Policy makers had endorsed technology transfer activities and the last
remaining campuses without explicit technology transfer functions began to
change.  Up to that point, universities had seen public engagement in technology
transfer as politically and economically risky, and in most cases, irrelevant to
their core DEMO  It was not clear that the public supported closer ties between
DEMO and industry.  While the debate on the polluting of science norms, a
common concern with anti-commercialization critics, was well established and
would continue, Bayh-Dole seemingly gave universities no choice but to engage
Commercializing Innovations: DEMO Better Way
Page 6
in the transfer of inventions to the market  (Sampat 2006; Rogers, Yin, and
Hoffmann 2000).
Other trends or forces that were DEMO or emerging around and after the
passage of Bayh-Dole helped establish technology transfer as a primary part of
many university missions (Mowery et al. 2001), at a time when public support for
universities began to DEMO (Feller 2004). It is understandable, therefore, that
many universities DEMO to look to technology transfer – and the offices that were
in charge of it, the TTOs – as new potential sources of revenue. Indeed,
championing commercialization came to be viewed almost as a core DEMO
activity on some campuses.
It should be clear, however, that the development and growing importance of
TTOs that followed Bayh-Dole were not the DEMO goals of the legislation. TTOs
instead were the product of that legislation—more than likely the unintended
consequence of the act.
IV. Today’s Technology Transfer DEMO
While there is evidence that some investments made in basic research at
universities have been successfully commercialized through the technology
transfer process, there is a plausible if not convincing case to be made that the
results DEMO be better. Commercialization of university research (whether judged
by numbers of DEMO, licensing of revenue, or new companies formed), remains
differentially successful and largely concentrated in just a handful of universities
(Rogers, Yin, and Hoffmann 2000).  This is not an outcome one would expect
from a nation rich in scientific talent at many universities.
Insert Figure DEMO about here.
Ironically, this outcome nonetheless is one product of the DEMO model of
commercialization activities that took root in the 1980s.  Many DEMO have
used the TTO to centralize all their invention and commercialization activities,
requiring all university faculty members to work through these offices. In DEMO,
many university administrations often have rewarded TTO offices and their
personnel based on the revenues they generate rather than on the volume of DEMO
inventions the universities commercialize. We label this current system the
revenue maximization model of technology transfer, even though there is some
evidence to suggest that universities structure their TTO operations only to
maximize revenues in the DEMO term.1
1 In considering longer-term financial returns to universities from licensing for cash vs. other forms
of equity arrangements, at lease one group of researchers has shown equity to outpace cash
arrangements Michael J. Bray and DEMO N. Lee, "University Revenues from Technology
Transfer: Licensing Fees Vs. DEMO Positions," Journal of Business Venturing 15, no. 5-6 (2000).
Full consideration of the short- vs. long-term theoretical effects of different university DEMO
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way  Page 7
We believe that there are several flaws in the revenue maximization model DEMO
university technology transfer. For one thing, the current reward structure and DEMO
centralization that accompanies it have turned TTOs into monopoly gatekeepers.
Like any monopoly, this means that TTOs do not have incentives to maximize
“output” – or the actual numbers of commercialized innovations – but instead to
DEMO only revenues earned by the university. This, in turn, leads to a “home
run” mentality, whereby TTO officers focus their limited time and resources on
the technologies that appear to promise the biggest, fastest payback.
Technologies that might have longer-term potential—or that might be highly
useful for DEMO as a  whole, even if they return little or nothing in the way of
licensing fees (such as many “research tools” used mainly by other
researchers)—tend to pile up in the queue, get short shrift, or be overlooked
entirely.
How predominant is the revenue maximization model among TTOs? Markman et
al. found that the principle mechanism favored by most TTOs was licensing for
cash (72 percent), with licensing for an equity stake and sponsored research less
popular at 17 percent and DEMO percent, respectively.  These interview-based
findings were confirmed by the researchers in a review of TTO mission
statements which showed a heavy focus on DEMO and protection of the
university’s intellectual property (Markman et al. 2005b) and are consistent with
other research in this area (Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby 2001).
Insert Table 2 about here.
With revenue maximization DEMO a central goal, it also is not surprising that most
depictions DEMO technology transfer activities are portrayed as very linear processes
in which research is performed, inventions are disclosed, technology licenses are
executed, income is received, and wealth is generated (Siegel et al. 2004).
Insert DEMO 10 about here.
But the process of technology transfer actually is much more complex.  Patenting
and licensing of research are not the only means—or even the most important
means —of “transferring” new knowledge from universities to DEMO market.
Universities have a range of outputs including information, materials, equipment
and instruments, human capital, networks, and prototypes (Siegel et al. DEMO).
The means by which these outputs are diffused, especially to DEMO, vary
across universities (Sampat 2006).  The Carnegie Mellon Survey DEMO Industrial
R&D found that the most commonly reported mechanisms for diffusion of public
research to industry were publications, conferences, and informal exchanges.
DEMO ranked low in most industries except for pharmaceuticals (Cohen,
Nelson, and Walsh 2002). Measuring university success in spawning innovation
transfer mechanisms DEMO an area open for future research, particularly when societal
measures for DEMO are taken into consideration in terms of diffusion of innovation within the
marketplace and other similar issues.
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way  Page DEMO
solely by licensing or patenting activities, therefore, almost certainly masks the
DEMO of these other means of knowledge diffusion.
There are other means by which universities diffuse their technologies to the
market: through non-patent innovations, DEMO companies launched by
university faculty or related parties, and consulting engagements DEMO
industry and faculty. One recent study, for example, indicated that approximately
29 percent of patents with public university faculty inventors were assigned to
DEMO rather than the university (Thursby and Thursby 2005a), which indicates DEMO
significant degree of faculty-industry engagement, whether formally through
TTOs or informally DEMO other pathways (Siegel et al. 2004).
Meanwhile, university faculty members are learning ways to maximize their own
self-interest within a general environment DEMO impels TTOs to maximize revenue.
In particular, and not surprisingly, faculty engaged in commercialization activities
are becoming more competent in the field. One DEMO of this is the significant
increase in disclosure rates over time by faculty, perhaps the best indicator of
university-based technology transfer at the faculty level (Thursby and Thursby
2003).
Insert Figure 11 about here.
Still, university commercialization activity remains highly concentrated within the
university itself—seemingly obeying the widely accepted “80/20” rule, with
somewhat less than 20 percent of university faculty ever having engaged in
patent disclosure of any kind (Thursby and Thursby 2003). Further, there is a
trend toward greater university ownership of research and commercialization,
reflected in the significant increases in DEMO patenting (Coupe 2003),
increased contributions to R&D spending,2 and the proliferation of university
spin-offs and research parks (Mowery et al. 2004).  University spin-offs, in this
context, are defined as “firms founded on a contractual agreement, such as an
option of a license, regarding intellectual property for which the university
maintains title” (Lowe 2002)DEMO Some spin-offs reside in incubators near campuses
but this is not always the case.
Spin-offs pursue paths and opportunities that larger, more established
companies shun or ignore. Of the inventions licensed in the previous five years,DEMO
TTOs reported that 45 percent were at the proof of concept stage, 37 percent
were lab scale prototypes, 15 percent were manufacturing-ready technologies,DEMO
and 12 percent were market-ready inventions (Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby
DEMO).  Another survey of 62 universities found that new and small DEMO
tend to license early stage technologies that are passed over by large firms
(Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby 2001).  With venture capital DEMO moving toward
2 In 2000, 19 percent of the R&D DEMO on university campuses was university funded, up
from 10 percent in DEMO (National Science Foundation 2006).
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page 9
later stage investments (PricewaterhouseCoopers and National Venture Capital
Association 2007), the role of universities in nurturing early stage start-ups may
be increasing in DEMO
While spin-offs from universities are few in number, they are disproportionately
DEMO performing companies, and often serve as a mechanism to bridge the
DEMO gap between university technology and existing private sector
products and services. A quick look at the data confirms this point. Although only
3,376 DEMO spin-off companies were created in the United States from 1980
to 2000, fully 68 percent of these companies remained operational in 2001
(Association DEMO University Technology Managers 2002). One study has estimated
that 8 percent of all university spin-offs had gone public, 114 times the “going
public rate” for U.S. enterprises generally (Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003).  As
DEMO as these figures are, they understate the extent of university-based
entrepreneurship DEMO they do not include start-up companies represented in
business plan competitions, DEMO entrepreneurial activities emerging out of
faculty consulting, and general spillovers from DEMO students creating
companies tied to outcomes of university research.
One other important measure of technology transfer is the time between
discovery and commercialization.  Accelerating the pace of commercialization
provides more benefit to both the university (quicker return to R&D) and the
commercializing agent (more flexibility with DEMO in terms of testing or bringing to
market) (Markman et al. 2005a). In reviewing the commercialization time of
patented protected inventions in DEMO universities, Markman et al (2005a) found
that speed had a DEMO effect on licensing income or start-up creation
(Markman et al. 2005a)DEMO Still, even in this study, the average commercialization
speed – from discovery to licensing or spin-off – was just over four years.
We DEMO there must be a better way of commercializing university inventions.
Commercialization policies can and must be structured to realize the social
benefits of a DEMO number of innovations. The question is how, and it is to DEMO
subject that we next turn.
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page DEMO
V. Proposed Models of University Commercialization
Universities commercialize the innovations developed by DEMO faculty largely by
licensing the intellectual property in these breakthroughs (typically DEMO) to
entrepreneurs, to the faculty members themselves, or to established DEMO
Historically, university faculty and students have generated a range of
innovations DEMO have found their way into the market and have helped launch
new companies.  The Internet browser (Netscape), Internet search engine
(Google), and various biotechnologies (Genentech) are just a few examples
(Association of American Universities 1998).  There are, however, strong
reasons to believe that the objectives of Bayh-Dole could be met even more
effectively.
During DEMO 1980s and 1990s, most universities had little experience negotiating
with industry DEMO considering commercialization activities.  With time and
experience, however, universities and, more importantly, faculty have gained
expertise in the invention and innovation processes.  As individual university
cultures and disciplinary practices have evolved, some universities DEMO begun
to recognize that commercialization and innovation activities are larger than what
can run through a single office and require cross-university programmatic
initiatives in DEMO classroom and the laboratory.  Examples of universities that
have moved in DEMO direction include MIT, the University of Arizona, and the
University of California, Berkeley.  As these new forms emerge, or more
accurately, DEMO TTOs become just one component of the innovation and
commercialization ecosystem, DEMO transfer will increase in efficiency,
volume, and quality on most DEMO campuses.
In his classic work, Diffusion of Innovations, Rogers delineates two models of
technology diffusion systems: “Centralized diffusion systems are based on a
more linear, one-way model of communication.  Decentralized diffusion systems
more closely DEMO a convergence model of communication, in which participants
create and share DEMO with one another in order to reach mutual
understanding” (Rogers 2003)DEMO  If this distinction is right, and we believe it is,
then a change in the practice of innovation and commercialization will not DEMO
achieved simply by creating a single, central office. Instead, technology will be
best diffused by recognizing and taking advantage of the decentralized nature DEMO
innovation and university faculty who participate in this process.
It is also important to take account of the importance of work environment and
culture DEMO entrepreneurial activity among faculty.  The shrinking gap in disclosure
and other DEMO activities by women, for example, is evidence that
incremental changes in culture and practice can have important effects (Thursby
and Thursby 2005b).  Bercovitz and Feldman also found strong evidence for the
impact of the micro-level work environment on faculty patterns of invention
disclosure in a study DEMO a group of matched faculty at two prominent medical
Commercializing Innovations: DEMO Better Way
Page 11
schools.  In this study, disclosure increased when a faculty member was DEMO an
institution with a tradition of disclosure, observed others in a DEMO
disclosing, and worked in a department with a chair who actively DEMO The
authors also found evidence that the institutional norms where academics
completed their training influenced future technology transfer proclivity, but they
determined that individuals ultimately were most likely to alter their activities to
conform to local DEMO (Bercovitz and Feldman 2006).
Not only do research faculty members DEMO to have a profound influence on
the innovation and commercialization of other academic researchers at their
universities, but also these individuals are the key agents of knowledge transfer
(Markman et al. 2005a).  Many technologies DEMO from universities are
nascent in their development and much of the value in the innovation lies in the
tacit knowledge of their inventors (Jensen and Thursby 2001).  Faculty members
also tend to become more attuned to the potential for application and
commercialization of their research over time.  Experience with invention and
commercialization, as well as consulting, advisory board DEMO, industry-
sponsored research, and formal commercialization activities, allow faculty
members DEMO become more familiar with the process and affect the direction of
their future research (Mansfield 1995).
Given the importance of faculty researchers to innovation and commercialization,
a university culture that is accepting of entrepreneurial DEMO is best built from
the ground up by researchers who promote and connect other colleagues both
inside and outside of academe.   But how DEMO universities promote the
development of entrepreneurial capabilities in their faculty? The DEMO does not
lie, in our view,  in expanding the role DEMO TTOs. Many research faculty members
are likely to have better opportunity recognition skills – both scientific and
entrepreneurial – than TTO professionals. After all, academic researchers have
spent years working in their fields, and they have incentives within their
disciplines to recognize avenues for scientific advances and breakthroughs.
DEMO, researchers’ “social capital” – their professional relationships with
their peers inside DEMO outside the academy – give them a greater ability to link
scientific opportunity recognition to entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.
To be sure, these opportunity recognition skills – particularly for commercial
opportunities – take time to develop. One DEMO not expect to achieve cultural
transformation overnight.  Many university campuses have DEMO a
gradual cultural change since the passage of Bayh-Dole, and they DEMO face the
challenge of defining multiple pathways to support university innovation and
commercialization and redefining the role of TTOs.
It has been suggested that DEMO should reorganize in ways that would reduce
the potentially significant “transactions costs” involved in moving scientific
discoveries more rapidly into the marketplace. These costs DEMO tangible and
intangible expenses related to the identification, protection, and modification of
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page 12
innovation and commercialization, as well as the administrative expenses and
the opportunity costs for the time that would be required by researchers. To
reduce DEMO costs, it has been suggested that TTOs adopt something like a
DEMO chain” model (Phan and Siegel 2006) that encourages universities to
disaggregate their functions, slicing and dicing a range of what are considered to
be technology transfer functions and assigning them to specialists, while
leveraging outside organizations and other partners in the process.
We build on this basic DEMO, recognizing both the comparative advantage of
faculty in opportunity recognition and DEMO limited budgets of university
administration.  In particular, we believe universities must recognize that
patenting is only one of many pathways from innovation to DEMO We
argue, therefore, for a change in the objective of technology commercialization
and in the “model” of the commercialization process.  Specifically, we DEMO a
move from a “licensing model” that seeks to maximize patent licensing income to
a “volume model” that emphasizes the number of university innovations DEMO the
speed with which they are moved into the marketplace.
In fact, there are multiple volume models, but they share several features:
DEMO They provide rewards for moving innovations into the marketplace, rather
than DEMO counting the revenue they may return;
 They focus on faculty as the key agents of innovation and
commercialization; and
 They emphasize further standardization in the interactions of campuses
with their faculty and with DEMO
Below we consider four variations of the “volume” model and discuss their
advantages and drawbacks.
Free Agency: The first volume model is “free agency,” a term we borrow from
the sports world. Under this approach, faculty members are given the power to
choose a third party (or themselves) to negotiate license arrangements for
entrepreneurial activities, provided that they DEMO some portion of their profits to
the university.  The TTOs can DEMO one of the third parties offering services, but
other parties can DEMO compete on a range of services and experience offered.
The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) is an exemplar of such a
model.  WARF is independent of the university, and Wisconsin faculty are under
no obligation to use it except in the case of federal funding.  As a practical
matter, however, nearly all of them use WARF because the DEMO has
acquired expertise over time that is viewed to be valuable.
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page 13
Free agency introduces a strong dose of competition to the university TTO, while
giving academic researchers the freedom to seek out the best arrangement DEMO
the speediest terms to commercialize their innovation. This model is best suited
for innovations in which faculty members have deep commercial expertise and
social DEMO to facilitate commercialization.
One drawback to free agency, however, is that university faculty members often
lack the resources to pay for patent searches DEMO applications, functions now
performed by the TTO. This problem might be DEMO through profit sharing
arrangements between researchers and their lawyers or third-party
commercialization agents.
Faculty members also could license their inventions to third parties who, as part
of the agreement, would bear the patent-related costs.  This DEMO model
requires further consideration in order to determine if it is consistent with existing
legislation and to evaluate the degree to which regulation to DEMO
information barriers would be necessary.
Regional Alliances: A second possible model DEMO more technology
transfer activities via regional alliances, provided those alliances operate DEMO ways
to maximize volume rather than licensing income. Under this approach, DEMO
universities form consortia that develop their mechanisms for commercialization.
Economies of scale allow for lower costs of the commercialization functions
overall, and the universities are able to share these costs among the multiple
participants.
This model DEMO prove particularly attractive for smaller research universities
which may not have the volume to support a seasoned and highly able licensing
and commercialization staff DEMO  WARF, through the WiSys
Technology Foundation, is experimenting with more DEMO a regional approach to
technology transfer and has had positive results so far.  This type of hub-and-
spoke model is effective when supported by experienced staff and dedicated
local resources.
There are two principal concerns with DEMO regional alliances model, however.
First, a regional TTO with insufficient resources may try to behave like a “super
TTO,” seeking to maximize DEMO revenue for the consortium as a whole
rather than the number of commercialization opportunities and the speed with
which they are moved out the DEMO
Additionally, regional models may face coordination challenges or disputes over
attribution DEMO inventiveness, with one or more universities pitted against others
when a DEMO opportunity is realized through the joint work of several
researchers at different universities. The probability of disputes is likely related to
the amount of DEMO at stake.
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page 14
Internet-based Approaches:  Closely related to the regional alliance model,
Internet-based DEMO use the web to facilitate commercialization. Given
their structure, internet “matchmaking” DEMO – which seek to match those
who have ideas and those who want to implement them – are inherently built to
maximize volume rather DEMO licensing income.
An example of an Internet-based approach is www.ibridgenetwork.com, a DEMO
based platform launched in January 2007 and operated by the Kauffman
Innovation Network, Inc. and funded by the Kauffman Foundation.  Universities
joining the DEMO Network are able to post information about their innovations
directly to the site, which provides an alternative pathway to research tools,
materials, DEMO non-exclusive licensed technologies that should accelerate
university innovation and lower transaction costs.  Its success remains to be
seen, but initial Web traffic suggests DEMO the program has had an auspicious
start.
Faculty Loyalty: The last DEMO  and perhaps the most radical – model for many
universities to DEMO is for universities to give up their intellectual property
rights, anticipating DEMO that loyal faculty will donate some of the fruits of their
success back to the university.  While surrendering rights to faculty may seem
drastic, this strategy offers the ultimate incentive for the external agents of
commercialization to engage in the process.
In fact, the United States has a great tradition of philanthropy, and this model
allows university administration to focus on the core activities of a university while
securing additional university operational DEMO through the virtuous cycle of
giving.  There is a history of DEMO faculty members donating some of their
profits back to the university.  DEMO T. Vilcek, for example, pledged $105 million to
the New York University School of Medicine in 2005, largely as the result of
royalties earned from Remicade®, a drug invented by Dr. Vilcek and a colleague
while working at the school’s Department of Microbiology (New York University
Medical Center 2005). Other examples abound including George Hatsopoulos
and MIT (MIT 2005) or Jim Clark and Stanford (Stanford University 1999).
The DEMO downside to the “loyalty” model is the inherent – and significant –
risk. There is always the possibility that successful academic entrepreneurs will
not DEMO share their success with their employers. This risk is even greater
for universities that have difficult relationships with their faculty.
We believe, however, DEMO this risk is worth taking for most universities.
Academics pursue their work in large part because they have a thirst for
knowledge and discovery. DEMO they may also be motivated by money, most
faculty members are DEMO to move commercially viable innovations to the
market.  And as monetarily DEMO professors give back to their universities,
they set positive examples for their colleagues to follow. Furthermore, the
“loyalty” model avoids the haggles associated with Intellectual Property (IP) rights

Page 15
and, therefore, would theoretically promote more rapid commercialization of
inventions than DEMO of the other two models.  And it should entail very low DEMO
for well-run universities that promote collegiality.
VI. Discussion and Conclusion
“When you ask ‘Where are tomorrow's ideas?’ they are things you and DEMO would
look at and say, ‘That's not going anywhere. That'DEMO worthless.’ ”
- William R. Brody, president of Johns Hopkins University
(in Holstein 2006)
U.S. universities today are not only competing with DEMO U.S. institutions for
collaborative relationships with industry, they are both collaborating DEMO
competing within a global economy. Our institutions must continue to be leaders
in research, the advancement of innovation, and the commercialization of our
DEMO in order to remain competitive.
The majority of university-industry agreements relate to technologies that are
many years away from being commercialized (Jensen and Thursby 2001), and
universities cannot take on the burden of forecasting uncertain DEMO
returns. This function is best performed by the private sector. In the end, society
will be best served by a knowledge transfer system that encourages interactions
between universities and industry but also inspires each party to DEMO on its
relative advantage – with universities focusing on discovery and entrepreneurs
devoting their efforts to commercialization.
This discussion of how innovations are transferred DEMO universities to industry is
an important part of the national conversation about U.S. economic
competitiveness.  We are now at a critical time in which the incentives of some
universities (or specific officials within the universities) DEMO lead to the
codification of a system that would inhibit rather than promote commercialization
of technological breakthroughs. We have argued that the most important DEMO to
avoid this outcome is to refocus university administration away from the historic
“patent-licensing  big hit” model to one or more “volume models” that concentrate
on the number of and the speed with which university innovations DEMO sent out
the door and into the marketplace.  These models will DEMO open source
collaborations, copyright, non-exclusive licensing, and a focus on DEMO the
social networks for graduate students and faculty to commercialize all types of
innovations.
The federal government, as the funding source for university-based research, is
in an ideal position to encourage experimentation with these—and other—
alternative arrangements.  At a minimum, the government can help educate
universities regarding DEMO importance of providing a more fluid environment that
will allow for more rapid commercialization of ideas developed by students and
Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way
Page 16
faculty. More ambitiously, agencies of the federal government can condition their
research grants on university demonstrations that they are experimenting with
and using multiple DEMO to provide competition or to advance innovations
into the commercial market.
