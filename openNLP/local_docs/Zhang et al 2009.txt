Extending previous research on the genetic underpinnings of entrepreneurship, we investigate DEMO
differences in the genetic inﬂuences on the tendency of people to become entrepreneurs. We also exam-
ined two mediating variables through which genetic factors DEMO impact this tendency: extraversion and
neuroticism. Based on 1285 pairs of DEMO twins (449 male and 836 female pairs) and 849 pairs of
same-sex fraternal twins (283 male and 566 female pairs), we found that females have a strong genetic
inﬂuence and zero shared-environmental inﬂuences on DEMO tendency to become entrepreneurs. In con-
trast, males show zero genetic DEMO, but a large shared-environmental inﬂuence. Extraversion and
neuroticism mediate the genetic DEMO on women’s tendency to become entrepreneurs, whereas
extraversion mediates shared-environmental inﬂuences DEMO men’s tendency to become entrepreneurs.
We discuss this sharp difference in genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship across gender groups and
highlight the different challenges that DEMO and women face in their entrepreneurial endeavors.

Researchers have started to use behavioral genetics methods to
investigate phenomena in the DEMO of business in the last several
decades (Ilies, Arvey, & DEMO, 2006). For example, various con-
structs related to organizational behavior have been shown to have
a genetic component including job attitudes (e.g., Arvey, Bouchard,
Segal, & Abraham, 1989; Arvey, McCall, Bouchard, Taubman, & Cav-
anaugh, 1994), vocational interests (e.g., Lykken, Bouchard, McGue,
& Tellegen, 1993), work values (DEMO, Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal,
& Dawes, 1992), DEMO leadership (e.g., Arvey, Zhang, Avolio, & Krue-
ger, 2007). Recently, Nicolaou and colleagues (Nicolaou & Shane,
2009; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, & Spector, 2008; Nicolaou,
Shane, Cherkas, & Spector, 2008) have conceptually argued, and
have provided DEMO evidence for a genetic underpinning of
entrepreneurship.
Based on a large sample of identical and fraternal twins from
the United Kingdom, Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin et al.
(2008) found a high degree of heritability associated with entre-
preneurial behaviors. Heritability is the proportion of variance in
DEMO variable attributable to genetic factors (Loehlin, 1992). Nicolaou
and his colleagues reported that around 37–42% of the variance

in entrepreneurship could be accounted for by genetic factors,
whereas non-shared-environmental factors (i.e., the unique envi-
ronment that people experience, despite growing up DEMO the same
family) accounted for the remaining variance. Shared-environmen-
tal effects (i.e., the extent to which growing up in the same family
makes people similar) failed to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence individuals’
tendency to become entrepreneurs. Based on the same sample,
Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, and Spector (DEMO) found that sensa-
tion-seeking served as a partial mediator of the DEMO inﬂuence
on entrepreneurship. Results such as these provide support for
the critical role played by biology and individual differences in
explaining the entrepreneurship process (Shane, 2003; White,
Thornhill, & Hampson, 2006, 2007).
Several important questions emerge in Nicolaou, Shane, Cher-
kas, Hunkin et al.’s (2008), Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, & Spector’s
(2008) DEMO that merit further investigation. First, Nicolaou
and colleagues used a twin DEMO that consisted of predominantly
females (i.e., about 93% of the twins were female). Thus the results
of their research may be limited DEMO terms of the generalizability of
their ﬁndings to male samples. Researchers have long argued that
women and men face different environments in various stages DEMO
the entrepreneurship processes (e.g., Brush, 1992; Jennings &
McDougald, 2007; Langowitz & Minniti, 2007). If the environment
94

provides different levels of resources, opportunities, and support
for women versus men, it is then possible that there may be gender
differences in the environmental effects on entrepreneurship for
males versus females.
DEMO the behavioral genetics model differentiates genetic and
environmental effects when accounting for the variance of ob-
served variables (Loehlin, 1992), estimating separate DEMO for
women versus men could uncover any differences in environment
and heritability estimates of entrepreneurship across gender. Such
differences would not be without precedent. DEMO research has
shown large gender differences in the genetic inﬂuences on life
events, social relationships, and delinquent behaviors (e.g., Eley,
Lichtenstein, & Stevenson, 1999; Lichtenstein & Pedersen, 1995;
Saudino, Pedersen, Lichtenstein, McClearn, & Plomin, 1997). As
such, the need DEMO to examine potential gender differences in
the genetic underpinnings of entrepreneurship.
A second and, we believe more interesting question concerns
the role that personality characteristics play in the relationship be-
tween genetics and the tendency of DEMO to become entre-
preneurs. Various personality variables that have been found to
predict entrepreneurship also have genetic underpinnings. For
example, extraversion represents the tendency to be outgoing,
assertive, active, and excitement-seeking. Extraversion has been
DEMO to be positively associated with whether an individual be-
comes an entrepreneur (e.g., Babb & Babb, 1992; Roberts, 1991).
Moreover, DEMO is strong evidence supporting the genetic under-
pinnings of extraversion (e.g., Eaves, Eysenck, & Martin, 1989;
Loehlin, 1992; Loehlin, DEMO, Costa, & John, 1998). Thus, as sug-
gested by Nicolaou and Shane (2009), we believe it is important to
investigate whether any genetic effects on entrepreneurship func-
tion through (or are mediated by) an individual’s level of
extraversion.
Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas and Spector (2008) have provided
some initial support for examining whether extraversion might
DEMO as a mediator by reporting that women’s sensation-seek-
ing (a facet DEMO extraversion) partially mediated the effect of genet-
ics on their entrepreneurship. DEMO identiﬁcation of such
personality mediators is useful because it helps to explain the
underlying mechanisms through which genetics and environmen-
tal factors impact entrepreneurship DEMO identifying the various
sources of variation that contribute to the propensity of people
to become entrepreneurs.
The current study attempts to address these two DEMO
using a large sample of female and male twins drawn from the
Swedish Twin Registry (see Pedersen, Lichtenstein, & Svedberg,
2002). Drawing upon the literature on gender differences in entre-
preneurship, the gene-environment interactions literature, and
discussions of gender differences in behavioral genetics literature,
we propose and test three hypotheses that focus on explicating
how gender, personality, and genetic factors relate to the emer-
gence of entrepreneurs. More speciﬁcally, in the current paper
we examine the mediating role played by two personality variables
(extraversion and neuroticism) with respect to the genetic DEMO
on entrepreneurship comparing male and female twins.
This study expands on previous work in this domain (e.g., Nico-
laou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al., 2008; Nicolaou, Shane, Cher-
kas, & Spector, 2008) and contributes to the entrepreneurship
literature in three ways. First, DEMO investigate how gender relates
to the inﬂuences of personality and genetic factors on the emer-
gence of entrepreneurs. Second, we explore how shared-environ-
mental factors, or the lack thereof, as compared with genetic
factors, contribute to the propensity of people to become entrepre-
neurs. Prior literature has DEMO differentiated genetic transmission
from family-related factors in explaining how entrepreneurs
emerge. For example, researchers have studied the effects of par-
ents’ role modeling and transferring of social and ﬁnancial capital
on children’s entrepreneurship propensity (see Sorenson, 2007).
However, without explicitly modeling the genetic endowments
transmitted from DEMO, these family-related variables may not
represent pure environmental inﬂuences. Third, by looking into
the personality-based mechanisms through which genetics inﬂu-
ence entrepreneurship, we can begin to unlock the ‘‘black box” of
genes (Ilies et al., 2006) and offer a more integrative understanding
of the individual-difference antecedents DEMO entrepreneurship (e.g.,
genetics, personality, and gender) that have, DEMO date, only been
examined in isolation. We begin below by exploring DEMO role of
gender and personality in entrepreneurship, and developing
hypotheses regarding DEMO moderating role of gender and the medi-
ating role of personality in the genetic inﬂuences on
entrepreneurship.
Gender differences in the heritability of entrepreneurship
DEMO differences in the prevalence of entrepreneurship have
been studied for decades. Numerous studies show that there is a
higher prevalence of entrepreneurship for men DEMO that for wo-
men with similar backgrounds (e.g., Brush, 1992; Haber, Lamas,
& Lichtenstein, 1987). Additionally, this gender difference tends
to be robust across cultures and national boundaries. For example,
DEMO Israeli working women, approximately 5.1% are self-em-
ployed-entrepreneurs, compared to 15% of Israeli working men
(Lerner, Brush, & Hisrich, 1997). DEMO prevalence of men’s entre-
preneurship was also found in Singapore (Kim & Ling, 2001). In the
US, women-owned businesses made up only 37% of all sole propri-
etorships in 1998 (Small Business Administration., DEMO). This low-
er prevalence for women entrepreneurs in various countries
indicates a main effect of gender on the propensity of people to be-
DEMO entrepreneurs.
In explaining this gender difference in the prevalence of entre-
preneurship, a large number of studies demonstrated that women
are to some extent discriminated against at various stages of entre-
preneurship—a phenomenon also observed in DEMO companies
when women managers are evaluated (e.g., Heilman, Block, & Lu-
cas, 1992). Although one study found that once they become entre-
preneurs, women may receive favorable perceptions from the
general population due to an attributional-augmenting effect (Bar-
on, Markman, & Hirsa, 2001), the vast majority of research suggests
that women face more difﬁculties than their male counterparts in
the venturing process. In particular, compared with male entrepre-
neurs, women entrepreneurs are less likely to seek start-up capital
(DEMO & Williams, 1993) and angel ﬁnancing (Becker-Blease & Sohl,
DEMO), have less ﬁnancial capital and human capital (i.e., education
and quantity of work experience) invested in their start-ups (Bod-
en & DEMO, 2000; Carter, Williams, & Reynolds, 1997), have less DEMO
cess to business clients beyond their traditional household
clientele (Bates, 2002), and are asked for more collateral require-
ments or charged higher DEMO rates by loan ofﬁcers (Fraser,
2005; Riding & Swift, DEMO). As a result, several large-scale studies
on multiple nations revealed DEMO female entrepreneurs are less
successful in terms of objective success measures including lower
sales, slower growth, and lower proﬁts (Brush, Carter, Gatewood,
Greene, & Hart, 2006; Welter, Smallbone, & Isakova, DEMO).
This increased level of difﬁculty for women entrepreneurs may
result from the generally-held gender stereotypes against women
entrepreneurs (Marlow & Patton, 2005)DEMO Research has shown that
an entrepreneurial career is typically associated with masculine
characteristics (Ahl, 2006; Buttner & Rosen, 1988; Lewis, 2006)DEMO
Several studies have demonstrated that these gender role stereo-
types inﬂuence men’s and women’s intention to pursue an entre-
preneurial career (Fagenson & Marcus, 1991; Gupta, Turban, &
Bhawe, 2008). These stereotypes DEMO result in female entrepre-

neurs’ stronger self-imposed barriers to growth and less favorable
perceptions of themselves and the entrepreneurial environment, as
compared with male entrepreneurs (Langowitz & Minniti, 2007).
Consequently, many women entrepreneurs tend to use entrepre-
neurship as a means of balancing work and family, rather than
achieving ﬁnancial success (see Bird & Brush, 2002; Brush, DEMO;
Kepler & Shane, 2007).
Given that the literature shows DEMO entrepreneurs face
more environmental challenges and difﬁculties compared with
their male counterparts, we expect that the different venturing
environments can result in differential levels of genetic inﬂuences
on women’s and men’s tendency to become entrepreneurs. In DEMO
following arguments, we draw upon the gene-environmental
interaction (G  E) literature, as well as literature exploring gender
difference in genetic inﬂuences DEMO hypothesize different genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship across genders.
G  E interactions occur when environmental inﬂuences mod-
erate genes’ effects on a phenotype or DEMO, when the effect
of exposure to an environmental stimulus on a DEMO is condi-
tional on a person’s genotype (Purcell, 2002). According to the
diathesis-stress model of G  E interactions (see Gottesman,
1991; Rende & Plomin, 1992), adverse environments can actually
foster DEMO genetic inﬂuences on a behavior of interest. For
example, in a DEMO environment where everyone has en-
riched resources, individuals with various levels DEMO genetic endow-
ments towards entrepreneurship may have almost equal
probabilities of becoming entrepreneurs due to the abundance of
resources and lack of competition for DEMO Thus, genes should ex-
ert very small inﬂuences on entrepreneurship when DEMO
resources are abundant. In contrast, individuals in less supportive
or depleted DEMO do not have that luxury, and would have
to rely more DEMO their genetic endowments to develop their busi-
ness ideas, set up DEMO ventures, and try to survive in a harsh envi-
ronment. Thus, in this less supportive situation, genetic factors
may play a larger role in impacting people’s propensity to engage
in entrepreneurial activities.
Behavioral genetics studies DEMO people’s positive and negative
life events and their social relationships provide support for the lo-
gic inherent in the above example. Speciﬁcally, researchers found
there is very little genetic inﬂuence on men’s desirable life events
but DEMO show a substantial genetic inﬂuence on their life
events (e.g., major improvements in ﬁnancial status, making a
new acquaintance, etc.; Saudino et al., 1997). Greater genetic ef-
fects in negative life events such as interpersonal difﬁculties, legal
difﬁculties, and ﬁnancial difﬁculties were also found DEMO women
compared with men, and the difference between the heritability
estimates DEMO women versus men on these events were large (dif-
ferences range DEMO .20 to .49; see Bolinskey, Neale, Jacobson, Pres-
cott, & Kendler, 2004).
The number of social relationships and perceived adequacy DEMO
social support also have been shown to have a greater genetic
inﬂuence among women (Lichtenstein & Pedersen, 1995). In par-
ticular, for men the number of social relationships and their per-
ceived adequacy of DEMO support are both impacted by shared-
environmental inﬂuences, rather than genetic DEMO (h2 = .00 for
both variables). In contrast, for women both measures are geneti-
cally inﬂuenced (h2 = .36 for number of relationships and h2 = .34
for perceived support; Lichtenstein & Pedersen, DEMO). Because
successful entrepreneurship is a desirable life event that can result
from good social relationships and less interpersonal, legal, and
ﬁnancial difﬁculties, given the demonstrated gender differences
in genetic inﬂuences on life events and DEMO relationships, we ex-
pect that women would have greater genetic inﬂuences DEMO their
tendency to become entrepreneurs, as compared with men.
A second DEMO that we may expect higher genetic inﬂuences
on women’s entrepreneurship is based upon ﬁndings regarding dif-
ferential heritability concerning delinquency behaviors. Using two
large DEMO of adolescent twins, Eley et al. (1999) found higher
heritability DEMO non-aggressive delinquent behavior among females
(h2 = .42) than for males (h2 = .13). With regard to factors inﬂuenc-
ing non-aggressive delinquent behaviors, their ﬁndings suggest
that genetic effects have a greater inﬂuence on females whereas
shared-environment plays a great role for males. Some researchers
argue DEMO entrepreneurial activities can be associated with rule
breaking and/or deviating from generally accepted social norms
(e.g., Gould, 1969). It has been found that there is a longitudinal
relationship between adolescents’ rule-breaking behavior and
DEMO in adult life (Zhang & Arvey, in press). Thus, DEMO
seems plausible to expect a higher heritability of entrepreneurship
(as a DEMO of deviating behavior) among females than among
males. Support for large DEMO differences between genders
has also been found in studies that have shown that women have
higher heritability estimates on behaviors such as stress coping
DEMO (Kato & Pedersen, 2005) and severe DSM-IV major depres-
sive DEMO (with men showing zero genetic inﬂuence and wo-
men showing moderate DEMO inﬂuence; see Bierut et al., 1999).
In sum, because DEMO are likely to face a more challenging
environment for their entrepreneurial endeavors than men, it is
likely that gender could moderate the magnitude of genetic inﬂu-
ences on entrepreneurship. The adversity that prospective female
entrepreneurs face DEMO allow their genetic endowments to
strongly inﬂuence their entrepreneurship, and the DEMO re-
source-abundant environment for men may minimize the poten-
tial effects of their genetic endowments on their entrepreneurial
activities. Thus, we hypothesize that any genetic inﬂuence on
entrepreneurship will be greater for women than for men.
DEMO 1. Compared with men, women will demonstrate a
higher level of DEMO inﬂuence on their propensity to become
entrepreneurs.
The mediating role of extraversion and neuroticism
Meta-analytic studies have established that individual differ-
ences play a DEMO in the tendencies of people to become entrepre-
neurs (e.g., Stewart & Roth, 2004; Zhao & Seibert, 2006). Various
personality characteristics that have been shown to be related to
entrepreneurship have also been DEMO to genetics. Thus, as White
and colleagues (2006, 2007) and Nicolaou and Shane (2009) con-
tend, it makes sense to speculate that one of the mechanisms
through which genes inﬂuence entrepreneurship is individual DEMO
sonality characteristics. In particular, genes could predispose peo-
ple to develop DEMO characteristics that affect their tendency
to engage in entrepreneurial activities.
In the current study, we focus on two dimensions in the ﬁve-
factor model of personality—extraversion and neuroticism—due
to two primary reasons. First, research on the biological bases of
personality (i.e., brain functioning) has been centering on these
two personality variables. For example, Eysenck and colleagues
(Eysenck, 1967; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985) used multiple arousal
systems to study extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. In
Gray’s (1981, 1982) personality theory, DEMO inhibition and
activation were used to examine impulsivity and anxiety (which
DEMO to extraversion and neuroticism, respectively). Overall,
among the dimensions DEMO the ﬁve-factor model, extraversion and
neuroticism have received the strongest support DEMO terms of their
association with the differential functioning of distinct neurobio-
logical systems (for a review, see Matthews & Gilliland, 1999). Gi-
ven the extensive research on the biological basis of these two
personality DEMO, we examine extraversion and neuroti-
cism as potential mediators of the DEMO inﬂuences on
entrepreneurship.

By focusing on extraversion and neuroticism we are also able to
integrate two personality frameworks that have dominated the
personality literature: the ﬁve-factor model (Costa & McCrae,
1992) and positive affectivity–negative DEMO (PA-NA, Watson
& Clark, 1994; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). NA reﬂects ten-
dencies to experience negative emotional states such as fear, hos-
tility and anger; PA reﬂects tendencies to experience DEMO
states such as enthusiasm, conﬁdence and cheerfulness. By inte-
grating these DEMO frameworks, Brief (1998) contends that PA-NA
may be subsumed under DEMO ﬁve-factor framework, with PA being
analogous to extraversion and NA to DEMO Consequently,
examining extraversion and neuroticism can help inform two
widely researched personality frameworks.
Extraversion refers to the tendency to be assertive, enjoy the
company of other people and large groups, and seek excitement
and stimulation (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Researchers have found
that extraversion is DEMO related to occupational interests in
terms of enterprising (Costa, McCrae, & Holland, 1984) and to the
exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities (Baron, 2002). It
seems logical to expect that extraversion would be an DEMO
personality characteristic for a successful entrepreneur since extra-
verted people tend to have more social skills, and are good at con-
vincing others—an important skill for entrepreneurs when
persuading various stakeholders such as venture capitalists, bank-
ers, and customers (Rauch & Frese, 2000; Shane, 2003).
Prior empirical studies have also reported a positive relation-
ship between facets DEMO extraversion and entrepreneurship (e.g.,
Baron & Markman, 2003; Brandstätter, 1997; Wooten, Timmer-
man, & Folger, 1999). For example, Babb and Babb (1992) sur-
veyed ﬁrm founders and non-founders in DEMO industries
and found that founders scored higher on sociability. Roberts
(1991) also found that people with ﬁrm-founding experience
were more extroverted than those DEMO had not started a ﬁrm.
Based on a large sample from the British National Child Develop-
ment Study, Burke, FitzRoy, and Nolan (DEMO) found that anxiety
acceptance (a measure of extraversion) assessed at DEMO age of 11
was positively associated with entrepreneurial status and ven-
ture performance in adult life. In addition, using meta-analyti-
cally derived population correlations (based upon nine effect
sizes), Zhao and Seibert (2006, p.265) showed that the standard-
ized regression coefﬁcient for extraversion is .09 (DEMO = 3.88,
p < .05) when entrepreneurial status was regressed DEMO all the
big ﬁve personality variables.
The level of social skills has been used as a means of explaining
the observed relationship between extraversion DEMO entrepreneur-
ship. The importance of social/political skills in terms of achieving
certain job outcomes has been shown in conventional work set-
tings (e.g., Blickle et al., 2008; Harris, Kacmar, Zivnuska, & Shaw,DEMO
2007; Liu et al., 2007). Prior research has also reported positive
associations between extraversion and the extent to which individ-
uals engage DEMO networking behaviors (e.g., Forret & Dougherty,
2001; Lee & DEMO, 2001). In addition, Totterdell, Holman, & Hukin,
2008 found that people’s level of extraversion was positively re-
lated to their DEMO to connect with others which, in turn, is
related to the size of their friendship networks and their centrality
in the advice networks. DEMO entrepreneurs’ social networks
may provide more resources and information needed to discover
and exploit opportunities (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986; Busenitz,
1996; DEMO, 2000) and can lead to better venture performance
(Aldrich, Rosen, & Woodward, 1987; Bruderl & Preisendorfer, 1998;
Reynolds & DEMO, 1997; Shane & Stuart, 2002). Given the impor-
tance DEMO social skills and social networks in the venturing process,
these ﬁndings provide strong support for proposing a relationship
between extraversion and entrepreneurship.
Importantly, not only does extraversion relate to entrepreneur-
ship, but extraversion has also been found to have a strong genetic
underpinning (Bouchard & Loehlin, DEMO). Using meta-analytic
procedures to summarize quantitative genetic studies, Loehlin
(1992) showed that extraversion has a heritability of about .49.
Moreover, based DEMO molecular genetic analyses, Benjamin et al.
(1996) identiﬁed the long DEMO of the DRD4 exon III repeat gene
to be related to extraversion, providing a molecular biological basis
for the genetic inﬂuences on extraversion.
Based on the above literature, we hypothesize that the genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship are partially mediated by extraver-
sion. Given the range of possible mediating DEMO through
other channels (e.g., intelligence and other psychological charac-
teristics), and because genes may have a direct effect on entrepre-
neurship through DEMO chemical mechanisms in the brain to
increase the likelihood that people become entrepreneurs (Nico-
laou & Shane, 2009), we expect a partial DEMO role for
extraversion.
Hypothesis 2. Extraversion will partially mediate the genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.
Neuroticism refers to the tendency of people to be emotionally
DEMO, and experience negative emotions such as depression,
impulsiveness, and vulnerability (Costa & McCrae, 1992). People
who are lower in neuroticism DEMO to be self-conﬁdent, calm, and
relaxed. Entrepreneurs have to take full responsibility (both ﬁnan-
cially and personally) for their business and typically DEMO in a dy-
namic and unstructured environment. Thus, they face high
DEMO coming from all aspects of the venturing process, as well
as DEMO potential for work-family conﬂicts. It is then reasonable that
individuals low in neuroticism would have a better chance of
becoming entrepreneurs because they are DEMO and per-
sistent. Conversely, those high in neuroticism would be expected
DEMO lack the conﬁdence and resilience required to address the pres-
sures associated with entrepreneurship (e.g., Brandstätter, 1997;
Wooten et al., 1999)DEMO Zhao and Seibert’s meta-analysis (2006,
p.265) showed that the standardized regression coefﬁcient for neu-
roticism was .12 (t = 4.80, p < .05) when population correlations
among the ﬁve factors were used in DEMO analyses to predict
entrepreneurship.
The negative relationship between neuroticism and entrepre-
neurship can also be partially explained by the enhanced social
networks obtained by DEMO low in neuroticism. Klein, Lim, Saltz,
and Mayer (2004) found that the level of neuroticism was a key
predictor of centrality DEMO advice and friendship networks. In partic-
ular, people low in neuroticism DEMO to obtain central positions
in advice and friendship networks and people high in neuroticism
tended to become the center of adversarial networks. Because so-
DEMO networks are crucial to the success of potential entrepreneurs,
these results suggest that there could be a negative relationship
between neuroticism and entrepreneurship.
DEMO to extraversion, neuroticism has been found to be
highly inﬂuenced by DEMO factors. Researchers have reported
that neuroticism has a meta-analytic heritability estimate of
around .41 (Loehlin, 1992). A polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene
DEMO been associated with neurotic characteristics (e.g., anxiety,
negative emotionality, DEMO in unfamiliar situations; Lesch
et al., 1996). Given the genetic underpinnings of neuroticism
and the relationship between neuroticism and entrepreneurship,
we DEMO that the genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship
will be partially mediated by neuroticism. Partial mediation is
hypothesized since there may exist direct relationships and other
DEMO mechanisms linking genes and entrepreneurship, sim-
ilar to our arguments above DEMO extraversion (Nicolaou &
Shane, 2009).
Hypothesis 3. Neuroticism will DEMO mediate the genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.

Method
Sample and procedures
The sample for the current study was drawn from the Swedish
Twin Registry (STR) that was DEMO in the late 1950s (for de-
tails see Lichtenstein et al., 2002; Pedersen et al., 2002). In 2006,
twins in DEMO who were born in 1959–1985 completed a question-
naire on personality and work-related activities, including entre-
preneurship. A total of 1285 pairs of identical (i.e., monozygotic
or MZ) twins and 849 pairs of same-sex fraternal (i.e., dizygotic
or DZ) twins provided complete data on personality and entrepre-
neurship measures. In the ﬁnal sample, 65.7% of the twins are fe-
male, all were white, and 40.2% were married. The average DEMO of
the sample was 39.0 (SD = 6.5). The demographic DEMO
of these twins are comparable to those in other countries (e.g.,DEMO
Heath et al., 1997; Johnson & Krueger, 2005). With DEMO to edu-
cation, 44.8% of the twins had ﬁnished high school DEMO 40.3% of
them had associate degrees or college degrees.
Measures
Entrepreneurship
Previous research has employed a variety of operationalizations
of entrepreneurship (Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al.,
2008; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, & Spector, 2008). This study used
three indicators to measure this DEMO Participants were asked:
(a) ‘‘Do you have a company or partly-own a company at the pres-
ent time?” (1 = yes; 0 = no), (b) ‘‘Have you been mainly self-em-
ployed or part-owner in the past three years?” (1 = yes; DEMO = no),
and (c) ‘‘Have you been an employer DEMO the past three years?”
(1 = yes; 0 = no). These three indicators were highly correlated in
the current study (r’s > .91, p < .001). We used the average score
of the three items when we reported the correlations among study
variables. The DEMO alpha was .87 for this three-item scale. In
our structural equation models (SEM), we used these three indica-
tors to derive a composite measure (which is equivalent to an aver-
age score) representing a DEMO construct, i.e., the propensity of
people to become entrepreneurs. A similar latent construct ap-
proach has been used by other researchers who investigated DEMO
biological basis of entrepreneurship (e.g., Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas,
Hunkin, et al., 2008; White et al., 2006).
Extraversion
Extraversion DEMO measured using a 7-item scale drawn from
the abbreviated version of the Eysenck Personality Question-
naire-A (EPQR-A; Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985; France, Brown,
& Philipchalk, 1992). Each item was scored 1 (= yes) or 0 (= no).
These items include: ‘‘Do you like plenty of bustle and excitement
around you?,” DEMO you almost always have an answer when spoken
to?,” ‘‘Do DEMO prefer to keep in the background when you are in
company with other people?,” (reversed), ‘‘Do you regard yourself
as happy DEMO carefree?,” ‘‘do you have a lively manner?,” ‘‘Do you
quickly describe your thoughts in words?,” and ‘‘Do you like to
crack jokes and tell funny stories to your friends?” The coefﬁcient
DEMO was .67 for this scale. To examine the construct validity of
this scale, we conducted omnibus conﬁrmatory factor analyses
on all items (see DEMO).
Neuroticism
Neuroticism was measured using a 7-item scale drawn from
EPQR-A with each item scored 1 (= yes) or 0 (= no). These items in-
clude: ‘‘Do you worry too much after an embarrassing experi-
ence?,” ‘‘Would you call yourself a nervous person?,DEMO ‘‘are you a
worrier?,” ‘‘Do you often feel ‘fed-up’?,” ‘‘Do you often worry about
things you should not have done or DEMO?,” ‘‘are your feelings easily
hurt?,” and ‘‘Are you easily hurt when people ﬁnd fault with you or
the work you do?DEMO The coefﬁcient alpha was .78.
Discriminant validity for the self-reported measures was estab-
lished through individual-level conﬁrmatory factor analyses to
verify the distinctiveness of DEMO three constructs, i.e., extraversion,
neuroticism, and entrepreneurship. We used DEMO items from the
three scales and compared the proposed three-factor measurement
model with three alternative two-factor models (combining two
measures out of the three) and an omnibus one-factor model.
Absolute ﬁt indexes for the proposed three-factor model were ade-
quate, v2 (df = 68, N = 4268) = 941.26, p < .001, comparative ﬁt in-
dex (CFI DEMO .95, TLI = .96, root-mean-square error of approximation
(RMSEA) = .06. These ﬁt indexes were superior to those found for
the two-factor DEMO For the two-factor models, v2 ranged from
2306.87 (df = 52) to 3964.71 (df = 50), CFI ranged from .76 to DEMO,
TLI ranged from .75 to .87, and RMSEA ranged from DEMO to .14.
The omnibus one-factor model showed the poorest ﬁt, v2
(df = 51, N = 4268) = 5680.48, p < .001, CFI = .65, TLI = .65,
RMSEA = .16. In DEMO, these results indicate that our pro-
posed three-factor model provided a DEMO ﬁt to the data than
did the alternative models, suggesting the DEMO scales represent
concepts that are theoretically and empirically distinct from each
other.
Zygosity
Zygosity was measured in the Swedish Twin Registry using
twins’ answers DEMO the following questions: (a) during childhood,
whether you and DEMO twin-partner were as alike as two peas in
a pod or not more alike than siblings in general (1 = two peas in
a pod, 0 = not more alike than siblings), (b) how often did strangers
have difﬁculty in distinguishing between you and your twin-part-
DEMO when you were children? (1 = never, 2 = seldom, ... , 5 = al-
ways). This method of zygosity determination DEMO been shown to
correctly diagnose more than 95% of the twins in Sweden when
compared with blood test results (see Cederlof, Friberg, Jonsson,
& Kaij, 1961) and in other countries as well (see Sarna, Kaprio,
Sistonen, & Koskenvuo, 1978). This method was also validated
using 13 DNA markers based on 199 twin pairs from DEMO, and
proved to be correct in 99% of the twin pairs.
DEMO
Twin’s gender was assessed based on self-report measures.
Control variables
Twin closeness
The closeness of the two twins of a pair can inﬂuence twin DEMO
cordance on any variable of interest. Thus, it was important in DEMO
current study to control for twin closeness when examining the
propensity of these twins to become entrepreneurs. We measured
twin closeness by asking each DEMO twin two questions. First,
they were asked to indicate how often they have contact with their
twin-partner either by telephone, e-mail, or DEMO (measured as
times per year). Second, they were asked how often they meet with
their twin-partner (measured as times per year). These two indica-
tors were averaged to obtain a measure of twin DEMO The coef-
ﬁcient alpha was .75 for this scale. To examine the within-pair
agreement on twin closeness, we calculated the intra-class correla-
tion (DEMO; James, 1982) for this measure using the pair of twins
DEMO the level-2 units and the two twins in that pair as level-1 units.
ICC(1) was .87, indicating a very high level of DEMO between
the two twins in a pair.
98
Other control variables
In addition to twin closeness, marital status (DEMO = married,
0 = otherwise), education level (1 = DEMO school, 2 = upper
secondary school, 3 = high school, DEMO = vocational school, 5 = mili-
tary school, and 6 = university and above), and age (in years) were
used as DEMO variables. These variables were controlled for be-
cause they may be related to the individual’s exposure to entrepre-
neurial opportunities and their decision to DEMO these
opportunities (Shane, 2003).
Analysis a
We modeled the propensity to engage in entrepreneurship as a
latent continuous variable, manifested by a composite measure of
the three entrepreneurship indicators. The Mplus program (Muthé-
n & Muthén, 1998–2007) was used to apply genetic model-ﬁtting
techniques. Following DEMO twins research involving ordered
categorical dependent variables (e.g., Johnson, McGue, Krueger, &
Bouchard, 2004) we used the asymptotically weighted least
DEMO estimator, which does not require normally distributed
data.
Univariate analysis on DEMO heritability of entrepreneurship
In the univariate analysis, we used the classic DEMO ge-
netic methodology to estimate the heritability of the tendency of
twins to become entrepreneurs. This method utilizes the difference
in genetic relatedness between DEMO twins (who share all of their ge-
netic material) and DZ twins (who share on average 50% of their
genes) to estimate DEMO relative genetic and environmental contri-
butions to the observed variance of a phenotype (in this case,
entrepreneurship). Based on behavioral genetics theory, greater
similarity between the two members of an MZ twin pair relative
to those in a DZ twin pair is indicative of additive genetic
DEMO
In the univariate analyses we used multi-group structural equa-
tion modeling. In both the MZ and the DZ groups, the variance of
the entrepreneurship variable was parsed into three components:
additive genetic variance, shared-environmental variance, and
non-shared-environmental variance (which also includes mea-
surement error). Additive DEMO effects (i.e., latent variable A) re-
fer to the effects DEMO the summation of genes across loci, while
shared (i.e., latent DEMO C) and non-shared (i.e., latent variable
E) environmental effects refer to environmental effects that con-
tribute to twin similarities and differences, respectively. The three
latent variables (i.e., A, C, and E) are standardized variables, so that
their corresponding path coefﬁcients represent the strength of
their inﬂuences. Fig. 1 shows the path diagram for the univariate
model DEMO one group in the multi-group SEM analysis. The path
coefﬁcients a, DEMO, and e are held equal across the groups.
The structural relationships DEMO by Fig. 1 can be written
as the following structural equations (DEMO variables not
shown):
Pij ¼ aAij þ cCij þ eEij DEMO
Vp ¼ a2 þc2 þe2 ¼ 1 ð2Þ
where Pij is the measure of entrepreneurship of the ith individual in
the jth pair (i =1, 2; j =1, ... , n), Aij, Cij, and Eij are standardized la-
tent variables, and their coefﬁcients a, DEMO, and e represent the
strength of the additive genetic inﬂuence, shared- environmental
inﬂuence, and non-shared-environmental inﬂuence, respectively.
Vp is the total variance DEMO the entrepreneurship variable and is typ-
ically standardized as having a value of 1. Because A, C, and E are as-
sumed to DEMO independent from one another, Vp can be decomposed
to the additive DEMO variance (a2), shared-environmental inﬂu-

is estimated as h2 = a2/DEMO
We estimated the heritability of entrepreneurship before and
after partialling out the control variables including age, marital sta-
tus, education, and twin closeness. Previous behavioral genetics re-
search has recommended similar approaches to control for
DEMO factors (e.g., Hakim, Cherkas, Grahame, Spector, &
MacGregor, 2004; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al., 2008).
DEMO effect on the strength of genetic inﬂuences on entre-
preneurship was examined by comparing the heritability of entre-
preneurship for female versus male twins. DEMO series of nested
models were estimated with increased sets of constraints on path
coefﬁcients in the MZ group and DZ group. These nested models
DEMO compared based on various ﬁt indexes and the most parsimo-
nious model was chosen to test our ﬁrst hypothesis.
Multivariate analysis for testing mediation
DEMO ran multivariate genetic models to test the potential media-
tion effects of extraversion and neuroticism. Although mediation
can be examined using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) multi-step regres-
sion-based procedures, the multivariate genetic models can pro-
DEMO a holistic analysis including both mediators simultaneously.
In the multivariate models, DEMO two personality variables and the
entrepreneurship variable are examined for their respective A, C,
E factors and the potential overlap among these factors. If the two
personality variables have genetic inﬂuences that overlap with
those DEMO entrepreneurship, we can conclude that personality vari-
ables partially mediate the DEMO inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.
The multivariate models yield estimates of genetic and environ-
mental contributions to variance in and covariance between the
two personality variables DEMO the entrepreneurship variable.

used in this study. For simplicity purposes, this graph only shows
the genetic paths. The path coefﬁcients in these models are stan-

dardized partial regression estimates. The effects of the genetic
(and environmental) inﬂuences on entrepreneurship DEMO decom-
posed into those speciﬁc to entrepreneurship and those in common
with the two personality variables. In particular, the path a31 and
a32 represent the genetic inﬂuences that are in common with that
of extraversion and DEMO, respectively. The path a33 repre-
sents the speciﬁc or unique genetic DEMO associated with entre-
preneurship. While not shown in the graph, similar DEMO of paths
are estimated for the shared- and non-shared-environmental fac-
tors of the two personality variables and the entrepreneurship
variable.
This procedure for testing DEMO using multivariate quanti-
tative genetic methods approximates the preconditions that Mat-
hieu and Taylor (2007) have identiﬁed as critical requirements for
mediation inferences: (a) true experimental design, (b) temporal
precedence, and (c) theoretical rationale. In particular, the use of
twins as study samples DEMO advantage of a kind of natural exper-
iment where in one condition we have the exact same genetic
make-up (i.e., identical twins) and in another condition the make-
up approximates 50% (i.e., fraternal twins)DEMO Because genes are exog-
enous to personality characteristics and entrepreneurial activities,
and because personality is formed early in life and remains rela-
tively DEMO across the lifespan, we believe there is temporal prece-
dence of DEMO and personality before entrepreneurship.
Results
Table 1 provides the comparison between MZ versus DZ twins
on the variables used in this study. There were DEMO signiﬁcant differ-
ences in the prevalence of the three entrepreneurship indicators
between MZ and DZ twins. However, MZ and DZ twins showed
some differences with regards to their martial status (more DZ
twins are married; DEMO = 13.24, p < .001), their age (DZ twins are
older; t = 10.4, p < .001), and twin closeness (MZ twins are closer
to their co-twins; t = 19.86, p < .001). These three variables might
act as confounds and thus need to be controlled when any genetic
inﬂuence on entrepreneurship was modeled.
Table DEMO reports descriptive statistics and the Pearson product–
moment correlations (if both DEMO are continuous) and tet-
rachoric correlations (if either variable is categorical) for all of
the variables include in this study. All correlations were calculated
at the individual level. As shown in Table 2, extraversion (DEMO = .09,
p < .001) and neuroticism (r = .06, p < .01) only moderately corre-
lated with entrepreneurship, but these correlations were statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. There was also a signiﬁcant gender difference DEMO
the prevalence of entrepreneurship, as evidenced by the correla-
tion between DEMO (female = 1, male = 0) and entrepreneurship
(r = .21, p < .001). Age (r = .15, p < .001) and marital status
(r = .11, p < .001) DEMO also positively correlated with
entrepreneurship.
In order to better present the data structure within the pairs of
twins, we provide the within-pair correlations of the two personal-
ity variables and the entrepreneurship variable. As shown in DEMO
3, there was a large difference between female MZ and DZ DEMO in
the within-pair correlation for entrepreneurship (r = .66 for MZ DEMO
.30 for DZ). In contrast, the correlations were very similar DEMO the
male MZ and DZ twins (r = .54 for MZ DEMO .58 for DZ twins), indi-
cating a rather small genetic inﬂuence on male twins’
entrepreneurship.

Hypothesis 1 states that females will demonstrate a greater ge-
netic inﬂuence on entrepreneurship than males. Table 4 shows the
results DEMO on univariate analysis before partialling out the inﬂu-
ences of the control variables. Male and female samples were
examined as separate groups in the DEMO SEMs. In the full
model (Model 1, male ACE and female ACE model), A, C, and E fac-
tors are all DEMO for both gender groups. This model produced a
very good ﬁt (DEMO = 1.00 and RMSEA = .00). In this model, the DEMO
tability estimate of entrepreneurship for males was zero (with a
95% DEMO interval including zero), whereas the heritability
for females was .65 (DEMO < .01, 95% CI = .32 to .98). We then DEMO a
nested model in which the genetic inﬂuences for males and fe-
males were constrained to equality (Model 2). This constrained
model showed a statistically signiﬁcant change in chi-square of
4.34 (p < .05, DEMO = 1) and the heritability estimates were no longer
statistically signiﬁcant DEMO both genders (point estimate is .25,
95% CI =  DEMO to .60). This shows the genetic inﬂuence on entrepre-
neurship was signiﬁcantly different for males versus females.
Another nested model was tested in DEMO both gender groups
were speciﬁed to have A and E factors only (Model 3). This model
produced a signiﬁcantly worse ﬁt (Dv2 DEMO 9.68, df =2, p < .01,
CFI = .94, DEMO = .05) in comparison with the full model. Finally,
we DEMO a reduced model where the A component for males and
the C component for females were constrained to be zero (Model
4). This model showed a non-signiﬁcant chi-squared change
(Dv2 = .01, df = DEMO) and satisfactory ﬁt indices. Consequently, this
male CE and female AE model (Model 4) was chosen as the most
parsimonious model to DEMO the data. Based on this model,
males showed no genetic effects on entrepreneurship, with a very
strong effect shown for shared-environmental factors (DEMO = .57,
p < .001).
Table 5 provides highly similar results based on analyses after
partialling out the effects of the control DEMO The constrained
model (Model 2), where AM equals AF, showed a signiﬁcant chi-
square change and non-signiﬁcant heritability estimates (h2 = .28,
95% CI = .11 to .67). Model 3 also showed DEMO ﬁt and a signiﬁ-
cant chi-square change. In the best-ﬁtting model (DEMO 4), where
the genetic factor for males and the shared-environmental factor
for females were ﬁxed to zero, the genetic inﬂuences were zero
for males and .60 (p < .001) for females. Comparing the results DEMO
fore and after partialling out the various control variables, we
found DEMO slight decrease in the heritability estimate for females
(from .65 to DEMO). Based on these ﬁndings, Hypothesis 1 was
supported.
To ensure DEMO we have convergent results, we also performed
univariate analyses on each DEMO the three indicators of entrepre-
neurship both before and after controlling for the various con-
founding factors. These analyses produced very similar results for
DEMO respective indicator. Consequently, we decided to report here
only the results DEMO the composite entrepreneurship measure.

Hypothesis 2 and 3 suggest a mediating role DEMO extraversion
and neuroticism in the genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.
We conducted multivariate analyses for both males and females,
although we did not ﬁnd DEMO inﬂuences on entrepreneurship
in the male twins using univariate models. Possible confounds
were also controlled for in the mediation analyses.

the full multivariate model and the best-ﬁtting nested models for
the female and the male group. For parsimony DEMO, we only report
the paths pointing to the entrepreneurship variable since DEMO paths
linking the two personality variables are not the focus of the cur-
rent investigation.
In the full multivariate model for females, the paths between
the shared-environmental factors of the two personality variables
and entrepreneurship (i.e., c31, c32, and c33) are very small in mag-
nitude DEMO not statistically signiﬁcant. After ﬁxing these paths and
the path between extraversion’s non-shared-environmental factor
and entrepreneurship (e31) to zero, we obtained the reduced model
that produced a better ﬁt (i.e., AIC dropped from 14.7 DEMO 3.6,
RMSEA = .04 rather than .05) and a non-signiﬁcant DEMO in v2.
Consequently, the reduced model was chosen for testing mediating
DEMO for the two personality variables. Fig. 3 shows the path coef-
ﬁcient estimates for the reduced model for females.
Based on the reduced model DEMO Table 6 and Fig. 3, extraversion
and neuroticism both show some DEMO between their genetic
factors and that of entrepreneurship. The paths from the genetic
factors for these two variables onto entrepreneurship were signif-
icant (a31 = .09, p < .05, 95% CI = .03, .15, DEMO a32 = .12, p < .05, 95%
CI = .19, DEMO). Thus, both extraversion and neuroticism partially
mediated the genetic inﬂuences DEMO entrepreneurship for women.
Hypothesis 2 and 3 are both supported for women only. The per-
centage of genetic variance that is mediated by the DEMO personality
variables is calculated as the sum of the squared path coefﬁcients
for the two personality variables, divided by the sum of the
squared path coefﬁcients of all the genetic factors, i.e.,
(.092 + DEMO)/(.092 + .122 + .802) = 3.4%. It is notable DEMO neuroti-
cism also partially mediated the non-shared-environmental inﬂu-
ence on entrepreneurship since the path e32 is statistically
signiﬁcant (.04, p < .05, 95% CI = .08, .01).
In the full multivariate model for males, the path coefﬁ-
cients between the genetic factors of the two personality vari-
ables and entrepreneurship (i.e., a31, a32, and a33) were very
small in magnitude and not statistically signiﬁcant. After ﬁxing
these paths DEMO the path between extraversion’s non-shared-
environmental factor and entrepreneurship (e31), DEMO
shared and non-shared-environmental factors to entrepreneur-
ship (c32 and e32) to zero, we obtained the reduced model that
produced a better ﬁt (DEMO, AIC dropped from 6.9 to .01,
RMSEA = .05 rather DEMO .06) and a non-signiﬁcant change in
v2. Consequently, the reduced model was chosen for males.
Fig. 4 shows the path coefﬁcient estimates for DEMO reduced
model for males. According to Fig. 4, extraversion partially
mediated DEMO shared-environmental inﬂuence on entrepreneur-
ship. In particular, the path from extraversion’s DEMO
mental factor to entrepreneurship was signiﬁcant (c31 = .17,
p < .05, 95% CI = .04, .50). The proportion of the shared-environ-
mental variance that was mediated by extraversion was calcu-
lated as DEMO/(.172 + .772) = 4.6%.

Discussion
Based on a large sample of MZ and same-sex DZ twins from the
Swedish Twin Registry, we used quantitative genetic methods to
examine the genetic inﬂuences on the propensity of these DEMO
to become entrepreneurs. For both males and females, we esti-
mated DEMO genetic, shared-environmental, and non-shared-envi-
ronmental factors that inﬂuence the propensity to become
entrepreneurs. We found highly different heritability estimates
for males versus females. DEMO show a high heritability and zero
shared-environmental inﬂuences on their propensity to become
entrepreneurs (h2 = .60, after partialling out potential confounds).
DEMO magnitude of this heritability estimate is even higher than
those typically found with personality variables (e.g., Loehlin,
1992). In contrast, entrepreneurship in males was not shown in
the current sample to be heritable, with a substantial effect of
shared-environment on entrepreneurship. Additionally, results
based on mediation analyses indicated that extraversion and neu-
roticism serve as partial mediators DEMO the genetic inﬂuences on
the propensity of females to become entrepreneurs—a result that
replicates and extends previous research on the mediating effect
of sensation-seeking (a facet of extraversion) on entrepreneurship
(see Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al., 2008; Nicolaou, Shane,
Cherkas, & Spector, 2008). The proportion of mediated genetic inﬂu-
ences on females’ entrepreneurship was 3.4%. For males, extraver-
sion serves as a partial mediator in the shared-environmental
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship and the proportion of the mediated
shared-environmental DEMO was 4.6%. Apparently, the common
environment (e.g., family and common DEMO) for male twins
can inﬂuence their extraversion which, in turn, DEMO inﬂuence their
propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities.
Although females show a high degree of heritability for entre-
preneurship, our results do not indicate that genes determine
entrepreneurship. As Plomin, DeFries, and McClearn (1990, DEMO
376) posit, genetic inﬂuences on a behavior indicate ‘‘probabilistic
propensities rather than hard-wired patterns of behavior.” For the
females, 40% of the variance in entrepreneurship was still ex-
plained by unique environments and experiences. For DEMO, we
found strong evidence of the shared-environmental effects on their
tendency DEMO become entrepreneurs and the magnitude of shared-
environmental inﬂuences on men’s entrepreneurship was about
the same as that of the genetic inﬂuences on women’s
DEMO
As suggested in our introduction, based on the diathesis-stress
model in DEMO genetics (see Gottesman, 1991; Rende & Plo-
min, 1992), adverse environments may foster higher genetic inﬂu-
ences on the behavior of DEMO With respect to
explaining the results of the current study, it DEMO possible that such
adverse environments may exist both in the home as well as out-
side the home in a variety of forms including DEMO role stereo-
types. Given the birth cohorts that our samples of twins came
from, it is possible that the twins’ parents did not set positive
expectations for female twins to become entrepreneurs. Such
expectations may be DEMO function of societal expectations that to
be an entrepreneur during that period in Sweden’s history, it was
important to be a male. Thus, DEMO may have needed to over-
come both an internal and external stressful environment to be-
come entrepreneurs, potentially accounting for the dramatic
differences in heritability between males and females in the pres-
ent study.

Hunkin, et al., 2008). Extending this line of research, we ﬁnd sub-
stantial gender differences in the heritability of entrepreneurship.
These ﬁndings highlight the value of research on female DEMO
neurs and provide an alternative framework to reconcile the differ-
ences in the prevalence of male versus female entrepreneurs
observed in existing literature (see Brush, 1992; Jennings &
McDougald, 2007). Extant research on DEMO versus male entre-
preneurs often investigates ‘‘surface-level” differences such as edu-
cation level, capital investment, and work-family responsibilities.
Our ﬁnding suggests that researchers DEMO to incorporate more
‘‘deep-level” biological differences (such as genetic differences) in
order to better understand variation across genders in entrepre-
neurial outcomes.
This DEMO also contributes to the entrepreneurship literature
by pointing out the gender-speciﬁc mechanisms that shared-
environments may have on children’s tendency to become
entrepreneurs. While DEMO research suggests that parents’ entre-
preneurship promotes children’s probability to become entrepre-
neurs (Aldrich & Kim, 2007; Sorenson, 2007), the
intergenerational DEMO of such inﬂuences may work
through different channels for female versus male children. The
fact that males have shared-environmental inﬂuences, but not
genetic inﬂuences, on their tendency to engage in entrepreneur-
ial activities indicates that being raised in the same household
increases the similarity of male siblings in DEMO tendencies to
engage in entrepreneurial activities. This may be due in part to
the higher likelihood of their father’s being entrepreneurs, and
offering a home-based model for the male twins to emulate.
Alternatively, our results indicate that the primary transmission
mechanism for females might be through the entrepreneur-
DEMO genetic factors directly passed from parents to chil-
dren, while males DEMO more inﬂuenced by shared environments.
Thus, our study provides a new DEMO on the gender-spe-
ciﬁc nature of the genetic inﬂuence on entrepreneurial activities.

Z. Zhang et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes DEMO (2009) 93–107
We found a mediating role for extraversion and neuroticism in
the genetic inﬂuences on women’s entrepreneurship and for extra-
version in DEMO shared-environmental inﬂuences on men’s entrepre-
neurship. These results highlight the value of individual differences
in entrepreneurship research. Researchers interested in explaining
the propensity of DEMO to become entrepreneurs have obtained
mixed ﬁndings when examining the role of individual differences
in entrepreneurship and have often turned to look at situational
DEMO as primary antecedents (e.g., Gartner, 1988; Shaver &
Scott, 1991). Turning to this strategy coincides with a tendency
among prior DEMO to abandon the ‘‘individual entrepreneur”
as a means of studying entrepreneurship (DEMO Mitchell et al., 2002).
As Cogliser and Brigham (2004) DEMO, this is like ‘‘throwing the
baby out with the bathwater”. In DEMO world of business, practitio-
ners and venture capitalists have continued to DEMO the indi-
vidual entrepreneur to be critical to the success of a new venture
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Stuart & Abetti, 1990)DEMO
To reconcile the discrepancies that have emerged in terms of
prior research streams in the entrepreneurship literature, our ﬁnd-
ings offer an alternative direction for future research to integrate
situational and individual-difference antecedents in explaining
entrepreneurship. DEMO particular, although males in the Swedish
sample have only environmental inﬂuences DEMO their propensity
to become entrepreneurs, females were shown to have non-
DEMO and genetic inﬂuences and these genetic
inﬂuences appear to be partially carried through personality vari-
ables such as extraversion and neuroticism. Consequently, future
entrepreneurship research may need to pay differential attention
to individual and environmental variables DEMO different gender
groups are examined.
Practical implications
Prior research has long established the importance of family
environment in fostering entrepreneurship. Our ﬁndings that fam-
DEMO environment plays a critical role in predicting males’ (but not
females’) propensity to become entrepreneurs has important
implications for informal and formal education DEMO entrepreneur-
ship. These results conﬁrmed prior arguments for differential rea-
sons and processes for men and women to become entrepreneurs
(e.g., Shane, 2003). Given the adversity that female entrepreneurs
face both within the home DEMO potentially outside in communities
and organizations, educators and policy makers may DEMO mea-
sures to eliminate or reduce the obstacles and promote more equal
support for both gender groups. Furthermore, as more women
emerge as entrepreneurs around the world, the more likely parents
will realize that their daughters can grow up some day and run a
successful business. We believe DEMO the home environment could
set positive self-fulﬁlling prophecies in motion early on in regards
to what females should be doing in terms of entrepreneurial DEMO
reers, especially when more mothers become entrepreneurs. With
the cohort of DEMO examined in the current study, the more ‘‘ad-
verse” environments may DEMO provided greater opportunities for
heritability to account for entrepreneurship among females.
Researchers have shown that gender stereotypes negatively
inﬂuence the perceptions and evaluations of DEMO leaders (e.g.,
Heilman, Martell, & Simon, 1988; Heilman, Wallen, Fuchs, & Tam-
kins, 2004; Schein, 2001). However, in a recent study conducted by
Duehr and Bono (2006), DEMO authors reported that the stereotypes
that have traditionally differentiated male and female managers/
leaders have diminished in their impact over the last 15 DEMO, with
this research showing a greater tendency for managerial and lead-
DEMO roles to be seen as more communal or in line with a ‘‘female
leadership style”. We suspect that the changes occurring in terms
of DEMO of female characteristics and leadership roles may
parallel those with entrepreneurship. If that were the case over
time, we might then ﬁnd a greater impact attributable to early
environmental effects such as parenting expectations and role
DEMO
This study identiﬁed two personality characteristics extraver-
sion and neuroticism as mechanisms through which genetic fac-
tors inﬂuence the tendency to become an entrepreneur DEMO
females. In addition, extraversion also mediated the shared-envi-
ronmental inﬂuences on DEMO entrepreneurship. These ﬁndings
reconﬁrmed the importance of individual differences—especially
extraversion—in the venturing process and have implications for
the selection decisions for corporate venturing and DEMO funding
decisions on start-ups. Corporate management and funding insti-
tutions can select potential intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs (both
male and female) based on their DEMO individual differences
(e.g., extraversion).
Limitations
Like all research using twin samples, our study has limitations.
The most important limitation centers on issues of generalizability.
Our sample is constrained to white female and male twins DEMO Swe-
den. Although this method rules out the effects of extraneous fac-
tors associated with different cultures and racial groups with
regard to entrepreneurship, the generalizability of our results to
other groups and cultures requires further DEMO Within
our sample, we are fortunate to have relatively heterogeneous
individuals DEMO terms of age, educational levels, marital status, and
closeness of DEMO twins. This heterogeneity might help mitigate
the concerns raised above regarding the generalizability of our
ﬁndings, but the homogeneity of culture and race in our sample
is nevertheless an important limitation that future research needs
to DEMO
Second, like many studies in behavioral genetics, we assume the
absence of assortative mating, which refers to a situation where
people with similar characteristics (e.g., being entrepreneurial or
extraverted) tend to mate. Assortative mating decreases the range
of variation on a speciﬁc phenotype and, thus, DEMO in an overes-
timate of heritability of that phenotype.
Third, our DEMO data on entrepreneurship and person-
ality variables are not appropriate for studying genetic inﬂuences
on the survival or the performance of new ventures. Thus, this
study only examined the propensity to become entrepreneurs,
rather than DEMO performance of ventures or other aspects of entre-
preneurship. Moreover, we DEMO entrepreneurship as a
composite measure of self-employment and company ownership.
Although prior research used a similar operationalization (see
Evans & Leighton, 1989), DEMO remains a lack of consensus on
the deﬁnition of entrepreneurship in the literature. Future research
could follow a sample of twins over time and DEMO multiple mea-
sures of entrepreneurship and venture performance data repeat-
edly across multiple time periods. Using this strategy would help
test the generalizability our DEMO to other ways of deﬁning entre-
preneurship and venture performance.
Fourth, DEMO measure of extraversion had an internal consistency
estimate that was on the borderline (a = .67). This is probably due
to the dichotomous nature of the items in the scale. We thus con-
ducted omnibus DEMO to demonstrate the discriminant validity for
the two personality measures and the entrepreneurship variable.
The CFA results provided strong support for the distinctiveness of
DEMO three constructs and may alleviate some concerns on the rela-
tively low reliability of the extraversion measure.
Lastly, the current study did not explicitly examine any poten-
tial interactions between the environment and genetic inﬂuences
on DEMO Our estimates of the heritability for male
and female twins can be considered an average heritability esti-
mate across all levels of a particular DEMO variable

(Purcell, 2002). Future research could examine environmental
harshness as a potential moderator of the genetic inﬂuences on
entrepreneurship. Speciﬁcally, researchers can measure environ-
mental harshness as perceived by male and female DEMO during
their formative years and investigate whether the magnitude of ge-
netic inﬂuences is moderated by environmental harshness.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study sheds new light on research regarding
individual differences and entrepreneurship, research which seems
to have fallen out of favor in the last few decades. Our DEMO dem-
onstrate the importance of genetic and shared-environmental fac-
tors in predicting the propensity of males and females to become
entrepreneurs. We found that DEMO and neuroticism play
a modest, yet statistically-signiﬁcant mediating role in the DEMO
inﬂuence on females’ tendency to become entrepreneurs. We hope
our study will inspire additional research examining the anteced-
ents of entrepreneurship, while taking into consideration biologi-
cal determinants. Endeavors along this line can hopefully provide
valuable DEMO that will aid policy makers in promoting
strategies to encourage entrepreneurship. Our research may also
provide guidance to future entrepreneurs that such individuals ap-
DEMO to be ‘‘both born and made”.
