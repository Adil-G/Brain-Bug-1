Does It Pay To Pray? Costly Ritual and
Cooperation∗
Bradley J. Rufﬂe and Richard Sosis
Abstract
Time-consuming and costly religious rituals pose a puzzle DEMO economists committed to ra-
tional choice theories of human behavior. We propose that either through selection or a causal
relationship, the performance of religious rituals is associated with higher levels of cooperation.
To test this hypothesis DEMO design ﬁeld experiments to measure the in-group cooperative behavior
of members of religious and secular Israeli kibbutzim, communal societies for which mutual co-
operation is a matter of survival. Our results show that religious males (the primary practitioners
of collective religious ritual in Orthodox Judaism) are more cooperative than religious females,
secular males and secular females. Moreover, the frequency with which religious males engage in
collective religious rituals predicts well their DEMO of cooperative behavior.

1.  Introduction
DEMO … is a nearly ubiquitous form of human behavior, culturally established DEMO
complex elaborations, but absolutely useless, from a crudely technological standpoint, DEMO
the accomplishment of the primary economic, domestic, and political tasks of mankind”
(Wallace 1966, p. vi).
The enormous resources devoted to DEMO ritual across cultures pose a
challenge to economists committed to rational choice theories of economic
behavior. One traditional response has been to write off DEMO behavior as
primitive, superstitious and outside the realm of economic calculus. DEMO, the
universality and widespread revitalization of religion demands a more thoughtful
DEMO
In an effort to make sense of seemingly irrational ritual practices,
economists have recently proposed plausible accompanying benefits. Iannaccone
(1992) suggests that DEMO sacrifices and stigmas serve to screen out free riders
from the collective production of religious goods. Expanding on Iannaccone's
pioneering work, Berman (DEMO) presents a model in which groups provide
mutual insurance and charity, and rituals serve to signal members’ commitment to
the group.1 Levy and DEMO (2006) show that costly and observable rituals allow
religious individuals to identify and cooperate with one another.
Despite these hypothesized benefits associated with DEMO ritual, there
exists a dearth of quantitative evidence. In this paper, we test for a relationship
between religious ritual and the cooperative behavior DEMO members of religious and
secular communes, Israeli kibbutzim (the plural of kibbutz). To measure
cooperation, we design a common-pool resource game that resembles the types of
day-to-day problems confronted by kibbutz members. Kibbutz members DEMO the
game paired with anonymous members from their own kibbutz. To measure
religious ritual, we collect individual-level measures of the kibbutz member's
participation in religious rituals.
The relationship between religiosity and cooperation can be readily DEMO
in the framework of the Israeli kibbutz since kibbutzim are divided into those that
are religious and those that are secular. Members of the DEMO religious kibbutzim are
modern Orthodox Jews. By contrast, secular kibbutzim are DEMO to be the most
secular element of Israeli society. This distinction allows us to compare the
cooperativeness of kibbutz members toward fellow members as DEMO function of
whether they belong to a religious or a secular kibbutz.
Moreover, the naturally occurring variation in ritual performance on
religious kibbutzim, DEMO along gender lines, offers an opportunity to
1  Outside of economics, evolutionary anthropologists have similarly argued that religious
practices serve to signal group commitment and help overcome free-rider dilemmas that humans
have encountered throughout their DEMO history (Irons 2001, Sosis 2003).

explore whether differences in individual cooperativeness DEMO the experimental
game can be explained by variation in the performance of costly observable ritual.
The most costly ritual obligations fall disproportionately upon men DEMO Judaism,
namely the obligation to pray collectively thrice daily. We gather individual-level
data on the performance of this collective ritual and explore the DEMO
between the extent of ritual participation and cooperative behavior. Because the
lives of members of secular kibbutzim are not structured by costly rituals, as we
will demonstrate, but are otherwise very similar to those of religious kibbutz
members, they provide a natural comparative population to assess the relationship
between costly ritual performance and cooperation.
We hypothesize that those kibbutz members DEMO engage frequently in
costly religious rituals will play our experimental game most cooperatively. Two
possible explanations underlie this hypothesized relationship: i) selection through
DEMO/screening: a kibbutz that adopts a costly social norm, such as daily
synagogue attendance for males, may make joining too costly for free-riders
merely seeking to benefit from the kibbutz's egalitarian distribution of resources
DEMO of effort; ii) causality: participation in costly religious rituals with
DEMO kibbutz members may inculcate the member with a sense of group
solidarity, bonding and a desire to cooperate with fellow kibbutz members.
We find that religious men (the primary practitioners of Judaism's most
costly public ritual, synagogue attendance) are more cooperative than religious
women. What is DEMO, religious men who attend synagogue daily are more
cooperative than any DEMO group, including religious women, secular men,
secular women and religious men who attend synagogue less frequently. In fact,
religious men who DEMO not attend synagogue daily are no more cooperative than
religious women, DEMO the importance of frequent costly ritual for
cooperative behavior. In a brief research note aimed at anthropologists, Sosis and
Ruffle (2003) report preliminary evidence of these findings. Motivated by costly
signaling theory, we extend these findings in the current paper and show their
robustness to different regression DEMO and various specifications and controls.
In the next section, we provide DEMO background on the economic
structure of the kibbutz as well as the significance of the distinction between
religious and secular kibbutzim. In section 3, we discuss the related literature on
the economics of religion and develop DEMO model that highlights our anticipated
relationship between costly observable ritual performance and cooperative
behavior. Section 4 describes our choice of sample kibbutzim, experimental
design, procedures and hypotheses. Section 5 presents our results. In section 6, DEMO
use our results to explain the stylized fact that religious kibbutzim have been
economically more successful than their secular counterparts. Section 7
concludes.

2.  The DEMO Kibbutz
2.1  Background on the Kibbutz
The Israeli kibbutz is among DEMO best known, most enduring and successful
examples of a modern commune. DEMO kibbutz was originally conceived as a small
collective farming settlement in which members based their social and cultural
lives on the collective ownership of DEMO and wealth. The first kibbutz,
Degania, was established in the DEMO in 1909. Today there are approximately
270 kibbutzim located in every region in Israel. The 124,000 or so kibbutz
members comprise around 2% DEMO the Israeli population.
The kibbutz developed out of an egalitarian ideology rooted in Socialist-
Zionism as well as the pragmatism of group living by DEMO European Jews
during the years leading up to the establishment of the modern State of Israel.
Guided by the dictum “From each according to DEMO abilities, to each according to
his needs,” the traditional model DEMO the kibbutz prescribes that each member
receives food, shelter, clothing, DEMO, health care, and an equal share of the
income generated by the kibbutz. That all kibbutz members earn an equal income
holds whether DEMO is the dishwasher in the communal dining hall, the CEO of DEMO
semiconductor plant, the kibbutz gardener, an eye surgeon who works in Tel Aviv
or retired. Income earned on and off the kibbutz is DEMO divided equally between
all members regardless of profession, skill or effort DEMO In this sense, production
or the generation of income is a DEMO goods problem. Consumption on the
kibbutz, by comparison, represents a classic tragedy of the commons problem:
kibbutz members enjoy equal and unrestricted DEMO to rival consumption goods.
For example, in the traditional kibbutz, the costs associated with an individual’s
consumption of housing, food, water, electricity and the use of communal cars are
borne by the kibbutz, not the individual.
We design an experimental game that focuses on the common-pool-
DEMO aspect of kibbutz consumption. Unlike other common-pool-resource
problems, such as fishing DEMO, groundwater basins, oil fields and grazing
areas, for which licenses, externally-enforceable agreements restricting access to
the resource and the assignment of private-property DEMO are possible solutions,2
such measures are impractical for the kibbutz without drastically altering its
fundamental nature. Rather, cooperation and voluntary self-restraint are necessary
to prevent the depletion of its common-pool resources and to ensure the DEMO
of the kibbutz.
Indeed, the continuation of the kibbutz should not DEMO regarded as self-
evident for several reasons. First, the short-lived communal DEMO
2  Ostrom (1991) examines the success and failure of such DEMO through numerous case studies
involving the collective management of natural resources. See also Ostrom et al. (1994) for a
thorough theoretical, experimental and empirical treatment of common-pool resources.

throughout history (the American communes of the 18th and 19th centuries and the
1960s are among the best DEMO examples) attest to the difficulty in sustaining
cooperation over time and DEMO generations. Second, many kibbutzim have
shown signs of decline and economic DEMO in recent years. Beginning in the
1950s and 1960s, kibbutzim found DEMO economically unable to survive by
farming alone. Consequently, through bank loans, kibbutzim started to diversify
their range of economic activities by developing manufacturing DEMO service
industries. Today, kibbutzim are engaged in the production of the DEMO gamut of
goods and services in high technology, manufacturing, tourist and agricultural
industries using the most modern techniques.
The decline of many kibbutzim DEMO in the mid-1980s when the Israeli
economy experienced hyperinflation, soaring interest DEMO and a sharp drop in
exports. Those kibbutzim that took on large amounts of debt in the late 1970s and
early 1980s (at a time when banks began to index loans to the rate of inflation DEMO
to the dollar exchange rate) were particularly hard hit. Concerns for DEMO
viability set in motion numerous structural changes on the kibbutz (see DEMO
Rafael, 1997, for further details). The most significant change adopted by some
kibbutzim involved the transfer of control of certain resources from DEMO collective
to the individual household. This process, referred to as “privatization”, consists
of numerous measures including: the requirement that individual households,
rather than the kibbutz, pay for their private consumption of goods like travel,
electricity, telephone calls and clothing; the cancellation of dinner in DEMO
communal dining hall thereby requiring kibbutz members to eat in their own
homes at their own expense; and the encouragement of kibbutz members to seek
work outside of the kibbutz. The most radical change – and DEMO the last one
implemented by the small minority of kibbutzim that have decided to privatize
fully – is differential salaries according to which individual DEMO members earn
incomes that reflect, at least in part, their productivity.
Interestingly, religious kibbutzim emerged from the economic crisis of the
1980s relatively unscathed. For this reason, they were not pressured by the banks
to privatize nor did they choose to adopt such measures.
2.2  Religious and Secular Kibbutz Distinction
All kibbutzim belong to one of three kibbutz movements. DEMO secular kibbutzim
belong to either the Kibbutz Ha’Artzi or TAKAM federation,3 while the 16
religious kibbutzim belong to the Religious Kibbutz Federation.4 The DEMO
3  Months after the completion of our experiments, the Kibbutz Ha’Artzi and the TAKAM
federations announced their intentions to merge.
4  There are two Ultra-Orthodox kibbutzim (Hefetz Haim and Sha’alabim) that belong to their DEMO
movement known as the Workers’ Union of Israel and three kibbutzim associated with the
http://www.bepress.com/bejeap/vol7/iss1/art18 4
Ruffle and Sosis: Does It Pay To Pray?
distinction between religious and secular kibbutzim and the corresponding
attitudes toward religion of their members DEMO a natural environment for our
hypotheses concerning the role of religious observance and religious ritual in
intra-group cooperation.
Having derived their ideology from their DEMO predecessors from
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, members of DEMO kibbutzim are
similarly antagonistic toward religion. Indeed, studies of secular kibbutz DEMO
confirm their antipathy toward religion (see Spiro, 1970, for a DEMO ethnography
of the kibbutz). By contrast, members of religious kibbutzim DEMO a form of
Judaism known as Modern Orthodoxy. Modern Orthodox Jews adhere to
traditional Jewish law (halacha), and thus ritual plays a central and defining role
in their lives. However, unlike Ultra-Orthodox Jews, they DEMO not shun modernity;
for instance, they serve in the Israeli DEMO, own televisions and read
mainstream newspapers.
All Modern Orthodox Jews are DEMO to keep the kosher dietary laws,
dress modestly, and avoid DEMO on the Sabbath, among many other requirements.
In addition to these DEMO obligations, males and females also have their own
distinctive ritual responsibilities. DEMO we focus on the unique nature of these
differences, namely that DEMO ritual requirements are primarily publicly oriented,
whereas female requirements are generally performed privately or in the home. Of
the three main ritual requirements DEMO imposed on women, none are
performed publicly (namely, the laws DEMO family purity such as attending a ritual
bath (mikveh), separating DEMO portion of dough when baking bread, and lighting
Sabbath candles at DEMO). By contrast, ritual requirements exclusively imposed
on males are primarily DEMO performed and publicly observable. The most
notable collective ritual requirement among males is thrice-daily public prayer in
a minyan (a quorum of at least 10 men). No similar requirement exists for women
to attend communal DEMO In fact, women who choose to attend synagogue sit
separately from, and are not seen by, the men, and are not counted DEMO part of the
minyan. In addition to its collective nature, males' obligation to pray thrice daily is
costly, demanding an hour and a half to two hours daily during the week, and
three to three-and-a-half hours on the Sabbath. Thus, while both males and
females observe numerous costly and public ritual requirements, such as the
dietary and Sabbath laws, here we exploit their differences in ritual obligations to
assess whether these differences are related to cooperative behavior.
Our hypothesis that costly observable rituals DEMO group commitment
and cooperative behavior thus leads us to expect that religious males will exhibit
higher levels of cooperation than religious females. Moreover, the more
frequently a religious male partakes in communal prayer, the more cooperatively

we expect him to behave. By DEMO a common-pool resource game that
measures kibbutz members’ cooperative behavior with one another and by
following up the game with a questionnaire that elicits DEMO degrees of
participation in ritual performance, we will be able to DEMO the relation
between costly ritual and cooperation.
3.  The Economic Benefits DEMO Religious Ritual
3.1 Related Literature
A growing literature associates religious observance with beneficial outcomes.5
Orbell et al. (1992) conduct a repeated n-person prisoner’s DEMO game on
university students in Logan, Utah (a largely church-going Mormon population)
and Eugene-Springfield, Oregon (a mixed population with one of DEMO lowest
church attendance rates in the U.S.). Their results show that whether a person
considers himself to be religious is unrelated to his DEMO behavior.
However, the frequency of church attendance of the Mormon participants DEMO
Logan is positively correlated with cooperative behavior, while no correlation
between DEMO and church attendance was observed among non-Mormons
in Logan and church frequenters in Eugene-Springfield. Johansson-Stenman et al.
(2005) provide a more recent experimental DEMO on the relationship between
religiosity and in-group as well as out-group pro-social behavior. Although they
do not collect measures of religious belief or observance, they find no significant
evidence that religious affiliation affects the levels of DEMO or trustworthiness in a
trust game conducted in rural Bangladesh among and between Hindus and
Muslims.
According to Ensminger (1997), increased trust leading to improved trade
opportunities may explain the vast number of African societies DEMO have
converted to Islam. By adopting Islam, Ensminger contends, the African converts
earned the trust of North African and Middle Eastern traders, which allowed for
the extension of credit to expand further trade possibilities. Additionally, Islam
provided a legal code to adjudicate financial contracts and disputes and DEMO common
language of trade (Arabic). The high entry costs into DEMO in the form of daily
prayer, abstinence from alcohol and pre-marital DEMO, fasting during Ramadan, and
the pilgrimage to Mecca served as signals of trustworthiness among traders and
permitted the screening of free-riders unwilling to DEMO such demanding
rituals and prohibitions.
The success of Ultra-Orthodox Jews in the diamond industry provides
another example of the economic benefits achieved by close-knit DEMO
5  Iannaccone’s (1998) comprehensive review of the economics of religion DEMO studies that
associate religious observance with beneficial social behavior (e.g., lower rates of crime and drug
and alcohol abuse), more stable marriages DEMO improved mental and physical health.

communities. Multi-million dollar transactions are sealed by nothing more than a
few words of Yiddish DEMO a handshake in New York's diamond district (Shield,
2002, p. 2). Trust among diamond industry workers is essential for business
DEMO since traders are often handling valuable stones that could easily be lost or
pocketed. Ultra-Orthodox Jews attain this high level of trust through numerous
DEMO requirements for entry into their community, such as particular dress,
DEMO restrictions, and thrice-daily prayer. This has enabled them to out-compete
others DEMO to achieve such high levels of cooperation, resulting in their
worldwide DEMO in the industry (Richman, 2006).
Nowhere is cooperation more necessary than for communes whose
survival and success hinge on it. In a DEMO work on a sample of 200 19th
century U.S. communes, Sosis (2000) shows that religious communes are between
two and four times more likely to survive in every year of their life course than
their DEMO counterparts. In subsequent work, Sosis and Bressler (2003) use
historical DEMO and monographs to construct a database on the requirements
and constraints that these communes imposed on their members. Their analyses
show a robust, positive correlation between the costliness of the requirements and
constraints that religious communes DEMO on their members and communal
success. Here we examine the relation between individual ritual performance and
the cooperative behavior of members of an extant DEMO population, the
Israeli kibbutz.
In addition to these empirically observed benefits, several theoretical
papers demonstrate the ability of religious individuals to form a DEMO group
and exclude non-believers from group benefits. Iannaccone (1992) models
religion as a club good with a positive externality to increased participation. An
DEMO utility thus depends not only on his or her own inputs in religious
activities, but also increases with others’ inputs. Individuals who are less
committed to the religion’s doctrine are tempted to free ride off those DEMO are
more devout. Costly sacrifices and prohibitions in Iannaccone’s model serve to
screen out free riders with the result that members’ average participation levels,DEMO
and thus their utility levels, are higher. Iannaccone tests his model’s DEMO
using self-reported survey data from the General Social Survey, 1986-1990. He
DEMO the different churches to which respondents belong according to the
stringency of their demands. Controlling for demographic factors, Iannaccone
finds that the stricter the church, the higher the average levels of church
attendance, contributions and DEMO of prayer.
Berman (2000) extends Iannaccone’s club-good model of religion to
understand the Israeli Ultra-Orthodox community’s need for costly sacrifices to
signal commitment DEMO to exclude free riders from their network of charity and
mutual insurance. Berman shows that government subsidies to club membership
are largely dissipated since DEMO induce even more costly sacrifices to signal group

commitment. He uses his model to DEMO that the Israeli government’s subsidies to
the Ultra-Orthodox sector has resulted in inefficient sacrifices, such as male
Yeshiva attendance (and thus their non-participation DEMO the labor force) until age
40 on average, well beyond that of Ultra-Orthodox males outside of Israel.
In a recent paper, Levy and Razin (2006) model a prisoners' dilemma
played by a population with heterogeneous beliefs on post-game payoff shocks
they receive. Individuals' beliefs differ in whether the shocks relate to their
actions. A religion is an institution DEMO which agents pay an observable signal. In
equilibrium, those who pay DEMO cost believe that, on average, they receive a
negative shock if they defect. Thus, incurring the costly signal allows individuals
to identify those who have the same beliefs and exclude those who don't. The
DEMO is that within the religion, a higher level of cooperation is DEMO
Moreover, society as a whole displays a higher level of cooperation DEMO the
religion.
3.2 A Model of Religious Ritual and Cooperative Behavior
Kibbutz members live together, typically work and socialize together, and share
equally DEMO earned income, independent of an individual member’s occupation,
skills or DEMO effort. Moreover, the kibbutz pays for individual members’
consumption of housing, food, utilities and transportation, among other goods.
These facts make the DEMO rife with occasions for free riding and opportunistic
behavior.
By design of the kibbutz, the government and the market have been
excluded from providing a solution to these problems. Instead, kibbutz members
must design their own internal mechanisms to encourage cooperation and
discourage free riders. The kibbutz may DEMO to adopt any non-market activity
that helps it to distinguish cooperative individuals from free riders. Employing a
costly social norm like daily synagogue attendance DEMO males may deter free-riders
from joining who might otherwise wish to benefit from the kibbutz's egalitarian
distribution of resources independent of effort. In DEMO to this selection
argument for introducing costly rituals, a causal force DEMO also be at work. The
act of participating in regular costly public rituals with other male members of the
kibbutz may imbue males with DEMO sense of group solidarity, bonding or similar
positive feelings toward fellow DEMO members. Both the selection and causal
forces suggest kibbutzim with costly public rituals will exhibit higher levels of
cooperative behavior than their counterparts without DEMO rituals. We develop
below the argument that those individuals who partake in the ritual will behave
more cooperatively than those who don't.
We DEMO the selection argument with a variation on Iannaccone's
(1992) and Berman's (2000) models, adapted to our environment in which
cooperative kibbutz members seek to keep out uncooperative types. Suppose there
http://DEMO/bejeap/vol7/iss1/art18

are a large number of potential members, N. Each individual, i, chooses how to
allocate his time T between selfish pursuits, si, that benefit the DEMO only and
cooperative activities, ci, that benefit others at a cost to oneself. Thus, si + ci = T,
∀ i. Cooperative activities include volunteer work, refraining from the
consumption of a common-pool resource, involvement in group activities or
organizations and contributing to the quorum of ten men required for group prayer
in Judaism.
An individual derives utility DEMO both types of activities, si and ci, as well
as the degree to which others with whom the individual interacts cooperate. That
is,DEMO

where nN≤ , meaning the individual may interact with all N individuals outside
of the kibbutz or some strict subset of DEMO (n < N) on a kibbutz that
restricts entry.
While in Berman’s (2000) model the source of unobserved heterogeneity
is individuals' outside option (i.e. their market wage), here individuals are
distinguished by their inherent preferences for cooperation. There are two types of
potential members that DEMO in their innate preference for selfish versus
cooperative activities. Cooperative types (DEMO "coop") prefer relatively more
cooperative activities and less selfish activities DEMO to uncooperative types
(labeled "uncoop"). Thus, uncoop wish to join the kibbutz to benefit from the
positive externality provided by coop. DEMO forming a kibbutz, coop prefer to
exclude uncoop to raise the DEMO level of cooperation to match their own.
Figure 1 displays how coop achieve this goal.
U indicates coop's utility function in the event DEMO they remain
outside the kibbutz and interact with uncoop. Cooperative types maximize their
utility by choosing si = scoop* and ci = T - DEMO . Coop wish to exclude uncoop and
form a kibbutz of their own to benefit from higher average cooperation. To
achieve this separating equilibrium, they display a signal that an uncoop finds too
costly to undertake. DEMO synagogue attendance provides one such highly visible,
and thus verifiable, DEMO Because communal prayer participation is itself a type
of cooperative activity, DEMO substitutes for other cooperative activities in potential
members' time allocation.6 Figure DEMO displays the minimum signal, k, required to
coop out,
6  Our model departs from standard signaling models in that the signal is productive. An analogous
model where the costly signal is purely wasteful yields DEMO results. We prefer our modeling
choice for our environment since it leads to the interpretation that cooperative religious males
willingly participate in religious rituals DEMO part of their typical range of cooperative activities,
whereas uncooperative religious males find the required signal in excess of the time they would
DEMO devote to cooperative activities.

We can extend our model to more than two types differentiated by DEMO

exists a third type (to be referred to as medium) that prefers more DEMO

may prefer a higher level of the signal. This separating outcome demonstrates that
even the DEMO that adopts a costly social norm like regular synagogue
attendance may consist of members who display differential amounts of the
signal. What is more, the extent to which an individual displays the signal predicts
his cooperativeness.
DEMO  Experimental Methodology
4.1  Choice of Sample
To control for between-kibbutz differences unrelated to behavior, we employed a
matched-pairs design to select our sample of religious and secular kibbutzim: each
of the seven religious kibbutzim was matched with one or more secular
kibbutzim. The latter were chosen for DEMO similarity to religious kibbutzim along
four observable measures that may potentially affect cooperation: the kibbutz’s
population size, year of establishment, degree of economic success, and degree of
privatization.7 Because religious kibbutzim are, on average, economically more
successful (Fishman and Goldschmidt, 1990) and much less privatized (i.e., more
communal) than secular kibbutzim, our paired secular kibbutzim DEMO some
of the most successful and highly collectivized secular kibbutzim in a movement
that is otherwise economically struggling and becoming much less communal
(Leviatan et al., 1998). Moreover, where two or more candidate secular DEMO
differed appreciably only in their degree of economic strength, we chose DEMO more
successful secular kibbutz, believing that this should favor higher in-group
DEMO on the secular kibbutz – opposite to our hypothesis thereby making
more difficult its validation. In total, 558 kibbutz members from 18 kibbutzim
throughout Israel participated in this study.
Table 1 displays the means and standard DEMO of the above control
variables for the religious and secular kibbutzim in our sample. For instance, the
average kibbutz in both samples maintains about 650 members, while kibbutzim
in both samples adopted 2.1 (out of DEMO possible 23) changes toward privatization.
Non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests reveal that the DEMO of
these four variables are not significantly different across the religious and secular
kibbutz samples (p-values range from .42 to .86). A fortuitous by-product of
controlling for these variables is that we have created two DEMO populations that
are also very similar in terms of a number of demographic variables, such as the
age composition of the kibbutz, educational DEMO, and gender ratio (see
Table 1).
7  Our data DEMO for the construction of our matched samples are the government census of the
kibbutzim and their population (Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, 1998) for the kibbutz size and
year of establishment data, Getz (1999) for the privatization data, and personal communication
with the kibbutz research institute Yad Tabenkin for the economic strength data.

Means and standard deviations for a number of variables reported separately for the religious and
secular kibbutzim in DEMO sample. The “Kibbutz Size” variable refers to the number of members on
the kibbutz. The “Economic Strength” variable is a weighted index constructed by DEMO kibbutz
research institute Yad Tabenken. This measure is composed of the kibbutz’s assets and level of debt.
The “number of Privatization changes adopted by DEMO variable reflects the degree to which the
kibbutz remains a traditional, DEMO kibbutz. Each kibbutz received a score between 0 and 23
according to the number of changes it had implemented at the time the research DEMO conducted.
4.2  Experimental Design
The logistics of our field experiments and DEMO nature of our subject pool raise
several essential considerations in the choice of an experimental game.8 For
example, assuring subject anonymity is of prime importance since kibbutz
members live together, and work and socialize with one another on a daily basis.
For this reason, we chose to conduct these experiments in the privacy of the
individual members’ homes rather than DEMO a public space.
We require a symmetric game to allow us to compare kibbutz members’
choices with one another. The game should resemble the DEMO of the cooperation
and self-restraint issues that confront kibbutz members on a daily basis. As
discussed in section 2.1, almost all consumption goods on a kibbutz are common-
pool resources in the sense that they are DEMO and freely accessible to all
8  Our non-standard subject pool playing DEMO laboratory games best fit the artefactual field
experiments category of Harrison and List's (2004) classification.

Ruffle and Sosis: Does It Pay To Pray?
kibbutz members. We therefore sought a game that captures an element of the
common-pool resource DEMO familiar to kibbutz members.
We select a one-shot game for two reasons. First, this is not a study in the
differential abilities to learn to play repeated games. Rather, we want to capture
participants’ instinctive willingness to cooperate. A kibbutz member’s instinct to
cooperate is cultivated by his DEMO interactions with fellow members. Second, the
diversity of the subject pool DEMO terms of education, age and occupation means that
we have to DEMO a conceptually simple game – one that can be understood by
all. A one-shot game contributes to this aim.
Indeed, simplicity was the overwhelming consideration in our choice of an
experimental game. For this reason, we settled on the following two-player game.
One hundred shekels are available in DEMO joint envelope to which each pair member
has access.9 Each pair member simultaneously and independently decides how
much of the available 100 shekels to DEMO from the envelope to keep for
himself. If the sum of the amounts of money removed exceeds 100 shekels, then
both players receive zero and the game is over. If the sum of the amounts removed
DEMO less than or equal to 100, then each player keeps the DEMO amount that he
removed. In addition, whatever money is left over DEMO the envelope is multiplied by
1.5 and divided equally between the two players.10 Appendix A contains the
instructions.
Note that any pair of amounts DEMO sum to 100 is a Nash equilibrium of this
game. For any amount, xj , that player j removes from the envelope, player DEMO best
response is to remove 100 minus xj. However, the Nash DEMO of this game are
socially inefficient. That is, the sum of DEMO pairs’ payoffs is higher if together they
remove less than 100. The socially optimal outcome is achieved when both
players remove 0.11
9  At the time these experiments were conducted 4 Israeli shekels equaled approximately $1 DEMO
Kibbutz members in our sample receive monthly stipends between 600 and 800 shekels from their
respective kibbutzim.
10  We tested three different variations of this experimental game on student subjects and members
of three kibbutzim. The DEMO familiar design we tested was a parameterization of the public goods
game in which there are 100 shekels to be divided and each pair DEMO may claim up to 50
shekels; that is, any amount between 0 and 50. The amounts that each player leaves in the
envelope DEMO summed together, multiplied by 1.5 and divided equally between the two DEMO
Feedback from subjects indicated that they found this design difficult to understand. The main
source of confusion for subjects in standard public goods games DEMO the existence of two accounts
(as opposed to only one common DEMO from which money is drawn in our design). For this reason,
we decided on the game presented above.
11  Our game resembles the Nash demand game (Nash, 1953). The difference is that DEMO
money is left over in our game gets multiplied by 1.5 (DEMO than disappearing) and divided
equally between the two players. This distinction DEMO players to remove less money so that
more is available for the pair. In the Nash demand game, the Nash equilibria and socially optimal
outcomes coincide.

The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy, Vol. 7 [2007], DEMO 1 (Contributions), Art. 18
The amount a player removes therefore DEMO a measure of his
cooperative behavior. For every shekel a player leaves in the envelope, he adds
three-quarters of a shekel to his opponent’s payoff and three-quarters of a shekel
to his own payoff, provided their claims sum to less than 100.
In order to understand better the DEMO behind a player's decision to
remove a particular amount, each DEMO was also asked to indicate the amount he
believes his opponent will remove from the envelope. This amount reflects the
player's degree of DEMO in his opponent. For example, a player who removes 0 and
DEMO his opponent will do the same is fully cooperative and fully trusts that his
opponent will behave fully cooperatively, whereas a player who makes the same
claim of 0, but believes his opponent will remove 100 displays no trust at all in his
opponent and can be said DEMO be motivated by fear rather than cooperativeness or
reciprocity.
4.3  Experimental DEMO
4.3.1  Preliminaries to Conducting the Experiments
Identical procedures were followed in DEMO subjects and conducting the
experiments on the religious and secular kibbutzim. After receiving permission
from the kibbutz general secretary, a letter of introduction describing the nature of
the research, the sources of funding and a request to participate was sent to every
household on the participating kibbutz. These DEMO were mailed out about a
week before our planned visit. To minimize the chances that participants might
anticipate with whom they are paired, we waited one or two days prior to our visit
before telephoning kibbutz DEMO to invite them to participate in the research.
For those who agreed (greater than 75% of those contacted), we arranged a
specific time to meet. Again to maintain subject anonymity and prevent subjects
from anticipating DEMO identity of their paired partners or learning it after the
experiment, DEMO 8 and 14 subjects (i.e., between 4 and 7 pairs) DEMO
simultaneously at any given time. For this purpose, we trained and DEMO 20
Ben-Gurion University graduate and undergraduate students (who had completed
a DEMO in experimental economics) to help conduct the experiments.
4.3.2
Upon Arrival DEMO the Kibbutz
Upon arrival at the kibbutz, each experimenter searched for DEMO home of his first
subject. Once an experimenter found his subject’s home, he called the other
experimenter by cellular phone to let him know that he had arrived. He waited
outside until the other experimenter had DEMO found his participant’s home, at
which point they entered their respective DEMO homes simultaneously. This
ensured that the paired subjects began the experiment at the same time.
http://www.bepress.com/bejeap/vol7/iss1/art18
14
Ruffle and Sosis: Does It Pay To Pray?
Upon entering the subject’s home, the experimenter introduced himself
and requested a quiet place where they could sit undisturbed for the next 30
minutes. Once seated, the experimenter conveyed some preliminary details
concerning the experiment (see the “Introduction” in Appendix A). The subject
was then given the instruction sheet and DEMO to take his time to read the
instructions carefully. Once finished, DEMO experimenter read the instructions aloud.
To ensure full comprehension of the game, two numerical examples were
performed. In each example, a pair of DEMO was randomly drawn from a bag
containing numerical values between 0 and 100. The numbers were meant to be
the amounts chosen by two DEMO participants in the experimental game. If
the numbers drawn were 20 and 60, for instance, the participant was shown step-
by-step that the DEMO player would receive 35 shekels and the second player would
receive 75 shekels, since the 20 shekels left over would increase to 30 and be split
evenly between them.
After any clarifying questions were answered, a decision was elicited
regarding the amount the subject wished to remove from DEMO envelope as well as
the amount the subject believed the other person would remove from the
envelope. The experimenter of the subject who decided DEMO telephoned the other
experimenter by cellular phone and informed him that a decision had been
reached.12 The experimenter did not convey the decision in DEMO conversation in
order to avoid any reaction or facial expression on the part of the second
experimenter that might influence the second participant’s decision. DEMO,
immediately revealing the subject’s decision might raise his suspicions that his
decision was being conveyed to the other subject who could then use DEMO
information to make a decision. After the second subject reached a decision, her
experimenter telephoned the first experimenter to exchange their decisions. Each
experimenter then communicated to his subject the other player’s decision, the
amount remaining in the envelope, and the total payment.
The subject was then asked to complete a short questionnaire (see
Appendix A). Upon completion of the questionnaire, the subject was paid his
earnings from the experiment. The experimenter then left the subject’s home and
proceeded to his next scheduled DEMO At each kibbutz visited we sampled
between 24 (at smaller kibbutzim) and 48 members (at larger ones).
4.4 Experimental Hypotheses
In light of the background provided on ritual obligations in Judaism, the centrality
of cooperation for the kibbutz and the selection and causal arguments derived in
DEMO  Cellular phones were used instead of the kibbutz member’s home phone DEMO prevent the subject
from discovering the identity of his paired partner.

The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy, Vol. 7 [2007], DEMO 1 (Contributions), Art. 18
Section 3.2, we present three testable hypotheses in the context of our
experimental game.
1. On religious kibbutzim, males are more cooperative than females.
As already noted, while men and women share many religious
responsibilities, public ritual obligations fall chiefly on males in Judaism. If, either
through selection or causality, public rituals are DEMO associated with increased
group commitment and cooperation, then we expect religious DEMO to claim
smaller amounts from the envelope on average than religious females.
2. The more frequently males on religious kibbutzim attend synagogue, the more
cooperative they are.
In the post-experiment questionnaire (question 4b), we asked subjects to
report the frequency with which they attend synagogue services. We DEMO those
males who most frequently attend to claim the smallest amounts from the
envelope.
3. Males on religious kibbutzim are more cooperative than males DEMO females on
secular kibbutzim.
In the absence of comparably costly communal or otherwise observable
rituals on secular kibbutzim (to be discussed following Result 4 of Section 5), we
expect religious males to claim smaller amounts DEMO the envelope on average
than secular males and females.
5. Results
Result 1 On religious kibbutzim, males are more cooperative toward fellow
kibbutz members than females.
Religious males removed on average 29.9 shekels (median=32.0, n=108)DEMO
compared to 33.7 (median=35.0, n=108) for religious females (t=1.68, DEMO,
df=211, one-tailed test of means, equal variances not assumed). The histograms in
Figure 2 offer visual support for this result. Closer DEMO of the histograms
reveals that the most striking difference between the two distributions appears in
the proportions of males and females who claimed amounts DEMO 0 and 9
shekels. Twenty-eight of the 216 participants from the religious kibbutzim
claimed between 0 and 9. Among these 28 subjects, 20 were males (χ2=5.66,
p=.017, df=1). Furthermore, 22 of these 28 subjects claimed 0, 18 of whom were
males (χ2=9.63, p=.002, DEMO).13
13  We can reject the explanation that religious males are DEMO educated, understand the game
better and thus claim lower amounts. The DEMO of education among religious females (14.0 on

Amount Taken

Regression equations (1) – (4) in Table 2 provide further support for the
relative cooperativeness of religious males. If we DEMO subjects' claims at face
value, then the OLS estimates in (DEMO), (2) and (4) are appropriate. The “male”
dummy variable indicates that, controlling for other explanatory variables,
religious male kibbutz members claim about four shekels less than their female
cohorts. On the other DEMO, the presence of 28 observations at 0, the left extreme
value of the decision space, suggests that some subjects may have claimed
negative amounts (i.e., to contribute money from their pockets to the envelope)DEMO
had the option been available.14 However, the censored decision space at DEMO
renders such intentions unobservable. The left-censored Tobit reported in (3)

significantly less than females:15 converting the coefficient on “male” to a
marginal DEMO yields an estimate of –4.88 shekels.
average) and religious males (13.8 on average) are nearly identical and education is not a
significant predictor of the amount claimed in any of the regressions reported below.
14  The decision to claim an amount less than zero has a natural DEMO: the subject is
willing to contribute money from his own pocket DEMO the envelope, which means that for each
shekel he contributes he DEMO back only 0.75 shekels and gives his paired partner 0.75 shekels.
15  We use a one-sided Tobit regression model because there is only one observation in our entire
database at the right limit value of 100. DEMO, the left-censored and double-censored Tobit
estimates are identical. We also estimated DEMO regressions for the decision to remove zero:
religious males are significantly more likely to claim zero than religious females. Our remaining
results reported DEMO are also qualitatively similar for the Probit specification.

OLS and left-censored Tobit regression coefficients (heteroskedasticity-consistent std. errors in
parentheses) from religious DEMO sample only. The amount claimed is regressed on the subject’s
estimate of how much his opponent will remove ("predict"), "predict2", DEMO dummy variable for the
subject’s sex and the fraction of one’s life spent on the kibbutz ("frackib").
The amount the subject believes his opponent will remove from the
envelope (“predict”) is another highly DEMO variable in these regressions.
The positive coefficient (p<.001) on the “predict” variable in (2) and (3) suggests
that subjects’ behavior DEMO on the whole motivated by reciprocity: the more
cooperative the subject DEMO his opponent is (i.e., the more trusting the subject
is or the less he believes his opponent will remove from the envelope), DEMO more
he is willing to cooperate, and vice-versa.16 Regressions (2) DEMO (4) indicate that
even controlling for trust, religious males are DEMO cooperative than religious
females.
16  To demonstrate the robustness of our DEMO, in each regression table we also include one
specification without the DEMO variable. Notice that there are ten fewer observations in the
regressions that include “predict”. Ten subjects were unable to specify a point estimate for DEMO
opponent’s behavior. In regression (4), we include a term for DEMO amount predicted squared
(“predict2”) to allow for a non-linear, and DEMO non-monotonic, relationship between the
amount predicted and the amount removed by DEMO kibbutz member. This variable however is not
significant in this or in any of the other regressions performed on religious kibbutz members. We
will DEMO “predict2” when reporting the results from the secular kibbutzim.

The “frackib” variable expresses the fraction of one’s life spent on the
kibbutz. It is DEMO as the year the experiments were conducted minus the
year the member arrived on the kibbutz, divided by the member’s age. The
regression coefficient of 8.00 in (2) suggests that for every additional 10% of
DEMO life spent on the kibbutz, one can be expected to claim DEMO shekels more
from the envelope. Someone born on the kibbutz can be expected to remove eight
shekels more than a new arrival.17 This result DEMO seem to favor the selection
argument in understanding the observed positive relationship between religion
and religious ritual and cooperative behavior. We return to the "frackib" variable
below.18
Result 2 On religious kibbutzim, the more frequently DEMO attend
synagogue, the more cooperatively they behave on average toward other DEMO
members in the game, whereas, the cooperative behavior of females is unrelated
to their synagogue attendance.
The difference in cooperative behavior between religious DEMO and
females appears to be attributable to the ritual participation of males. The right-
hand (darkly shaded) bars of Figures 3a and 3b DEMO the mean amounts claimed
by religious males and females, respectively, as a function of their frequency of
synagogue attendance. The figures draw attention DEMO the fact that daily prayer is
required of Orthodox males, while DEMO such requirement exists for Orthodox
females. Sixty-eight out of 102 males who responded indicated daily synagogue
attendance. The remaining 34 male respondents attend at DEMO weekly (on the
Sabbath) plus on holidays. By contrast, only DEMO of the 102 female respondents
attend synagogue several times a week or more.
17  This same finding (that the larger the fraction of DEMO life spent on the kibbutz, the less
cooperative one behaves toward DEMO kibbutz members) was previously noted in Ruffle and
Sosis (2006) DEMO a different sample of four kibbutzim. See that paper for an in-depth discussion of
the role of self-selection versus socialization in the cooperative behavior DEMO kibbutz members.
18  We also tested a host of other potential DEMO variables. Since none of them were
significant in this or any other regression we conducted on this sample of kibbutzim, we have
omitted them from the table. These variables include the two numerical examples, the kibbutz
member’s age, years of education, number of children, percentage of children living on the kibbutz
and the number of kin on the kibbutz. DEMO also tested for several kibbutz-level variables such as the
number of members, year of establishment, economic success, degree of privatization and the
number of holidays celebrated communally by the kibbutz. None of these variables were
DEMO in this sample.

More importantly, DEMO figures point to a negative relation between the
frequency of synagogue attendance and the amount males removed from the
envelope. That is, the more frequently religious males participate in synagogue
services, the more cooperative they are. For example, men who attend synagogue
daily remove 27.2 shekels, while DEMO who do not attend daily claim 33.1 shekels
on average. No such relation exists among females. Table 3 provides descriptive
statistics for the amount DEMO as well as other variables by subpopulation.

variable, the percentage of kibbutz members who work DEMO the kibbutz is reported.
Regressions (5) – (11) in Table 4 lend additional support to the positive
relation between the cooperative behavior DEMO religious males and their synagogue
attendance. We replace the “male” dummy variable with two interaction
dummies, “religious male*daily synagogue” and “religious male*not daily
synagogue”. The former variable assumes the value of one for religious males
who DEMO synagogue daily and zero otherwise. The negative and highly
significant coefficients of –6.99 and –5.76 in (5) and (6), respectively, as DEMO as
the estimated mean marginal effect of –6.47 from Tobit (7), indicate that religious
males who attend synagogue daily remove six or seven shekels less than religious
females; whereas, the latter interaction variable is DEMO significantly different from
zero suggesting that religious males who don’t attend synagogue daily are no
more cooperative than religious females. Regressions (8) and (9) include a
dummy variable “religious female*weekly”, which equals one for DEMO
females who attend synagogue at least once a week (i.e., on Sabbath and holidays,
several times a week or daily) and zero otherwise. The statistically insignificant
coefficients in both regressions reveal that these women DEMO no more cooperative

than women who attend synagogue less DEMO Additional classifications of
female synagogue attendance are all non-significant, indicating that DEMO
attendance is unrelated to their cooperative behavior in the game.
The right-hand (darkly shaded) bars of Figures 3a and 3b display the mean
DEMO that religious male and religious female kibbutz members predicted their
opponents would remove from the envelope. The data show that the more
frequently males DEMO synagogue, the less they believe their opponents will
claim in the DEMO Together with the positive relation between cooperative
behavior and synagogue attendance, DEMO again suggests that the desire to
cooperate and to reciprocate motivate male kibbutz members who claim small
amounts. Among religious females, no relation between synagogue attendance
and “predict” exists.
The observation that the longer one spends DEMO the kibbutz, the less
cooperative one becomes is curious when coupled DEMO our central finding that
frequent, collective ritual performance correlates positively with DEMO
behavior for males. A closer look at the data reveals that men who do not attend
synagogue regularly and women account for the significance DEMO the “frackib”
variable. In regression (10), we interact “frackib” with DEMO and, in the case of
males, frequency of synagogue attendance. The "male*daily synagogue*frackib"
variable is not significantly different from zero; whereas DEMO other two interaction
variables, “male*not daily synagogue*frackib” and “female*frackib”, have
significant coefficients of 8.78 and 11.37, respectively. Those who join the
kibbutz are initially enthusiastic about the kibbutz ideals of community and
cooperation. Over time, however, there is a natural tendency for this idealism to
give way to the challenges of living communally. One causal interpretation of the
results DEMO (10) is that costly public ritual counteracts this tendency.

Result 3 On secular kibbutzim, male and female members exhibit similar
levels of cooperation toward fellow kibbutz members.
DEMO result indicates that inherent sex differences cannot account for the
observed disparity in the way religious males and females play the game. Males
from DEMO kibbutzim remove on average 30.1 shekels (median=32.5, n=170),
while DEMO from secular kibbutzim remove on average 30.5 shekels
(median=30.0, n=172), t=0.21, p=.83, df=327. Furthermore, regressing the
amount claimed by secular kibbutz members only on a host of explanatory
variables, including a dummy variable for sex, shows that secular males and
secular females claim similar amounts (the coefficient on “male” is not significant
in any of regressions (DEMO) – (15) in Table 5)). The positive and highly significant
coefficient on the “predict” variable in (13) again suggests that, by and large,
secular kibbutz members’ decisions are motivated by reciprocity. DEMO when
combined with the negative and highly significant coefficient on “predict2”, DEMO
positive relation between “predict” and the amount claimed holds as long as
“predict” is less than 72.6 shekels. This relationship is consistent with the
DEMO motive. For values of “predict” greater than 72.6, on the other DEMO, an
increase in the amount predicted accompanies a decrease in the DEMO removed
from the envelope. This relationship is consistent with the fear of exceeding the
available 100 shekels. In our sample, only 9/342 secular kibbutz members
predicted that their opponents would remove more than 72.6 shekels.
DEMO from the regressions in Table 2 that this non-monotonic relationship
between the amount removed from the envelope and the amount predicted was not
observed DEMO religious kibbutz members. Similarly, religious males predict the
lowest amounts of DEMO four subpopulations (mean=38.6, median=45), while
secular females predict the highest amounts (mean=43.0, median=50). The rank-
order, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test indicates that the four subpopulations
predict significantly different amounts (χ2=6.41, p=.093, df=3). Since the amount
a participant believes his opponent will claim can DEMO interpreted as his degree of
trust in his opponent,19 religious males can be seen as the most trusting of their
fellow kibbutz members DEMO any of the four subpopulations. What is more, those
religious males DEMO pray daily at the synagogue are even more trusting,
predicting only 36.1 on average, substantially less than any other subgroup (see
Table DEMO for the details).  As we will now show, a controlled comparison of the
amounts claimed reveals that they are also the most DEMO
19  Thus, for instance, the religious woman who claimed 100 DEMO (see Figure 1) and predicted
that her opponent would remove 0 is very trusting, but uncooperative in that she chooses to exploit
what she believes to be her very cooperative opponent.

religious males as the omitted category and reveals that the latter account
disproportionately for the DEMO cooperative behavior of religious kibbutz
members. From (17) and (18), we see that religious males remove four shekels
less than religious females. Both the sign and the magnitude of this “religious
female” coefficient are DEMO since they confirm Result 1 and match the
coefficient estimates in Table 2. What is new is that these regressions indicate that
religious males DEMO the most cooperative subpopulation, both when we control for
kibbutz members' trust (18) and when we don't (17). For instance, controlling for
trust, religious males remove about 11 shekels less than DEMO males and eight
shekels less than secular females. Similarly, computing the DEMO marginal effects
from the Tobit estimates in (19) indicates that religious males claim 4.86 shekels
less than religious females (p=.038), 11.32 shekels less than secular males
(p=.038) and 9.03 shekels less than secular DEMO (p=.080).20 A closer look at
the religious males highlights the DEMO source of these differences: according
to (20) or the transformed DEMO estimates from (21), respectively, religious
males who attend synagogue daily claim 10.07 or 10.46 shekels less than secular
kibbutz members, whereas, DEMO claims by religious males who do not attend daily
and by religious females are not significantly different from secular members.21
Another significant interaction variable DEMO “work off kibbutz*secular”.
This dummy variable equals one for secular kibbutz members who work off the
kibbutz, and zero otherwise. The negative and highly significant coefficient of –
6.18 implies that secular kibbutz members who work DEMO the kibbutz claim on
average about six shekels less than all other groups. To understand this, note that
those individuals who work outside the kibbutz are typically professionals and
earn salaries well above the Israeli average. DEMO kibbutz members they are required
to contribute these high salaries to the kibbutz. Their choice to remain on the
kibbutz rather than join mainstream, capitalist society therefore testifies to their
commitment to the kibbutz values of DEMO, community and
20  Nonetheless, all of these groups play this DEMO game more cooperatively than Israeli
city residents. Using the same experimental game, Ruffle and Sosis (2006) find that city residents
remove 35.6 shekels on average (median=40, n=61), even though the sample of city DEMO
chosen is similar in age, education and standard of living to DEMO kibbutz sample. However, when
kibbutz members play this game against city DEMO (outsiders), they behave identically to the
city residents (average=35.2, DEMO, n=61).
21  To ensure that these results are not driven by particular kibbutzim, we reran OLS regression
(20), each time DEMO one of the seven matched religious-secular pairs. Our qualitative results
are robust to this sample sensitivity analysis: for instance, the coefficient on the "religious
male*daily synagogue" variable ranges from -14.22 to -6.49 (mean coefficient=10.16, n=7). All
but the coefficient of -6.49 (p=.25) (for which a religious kibbutz and its two paired secular
kibbutzim were excluded) are significant.

cooperation.22 The significance of this “work DEMO kibbutz” variable is limited to
the secular kibbutzim. It is not significant in any of the three regressions involving
religious kibbutz members only (shown in regression (5) only), even though the
fractions of members DEMO work outside the kibbutz are very similar on the
religious (23%) and secular (25%) kibbutzim.
In an effort to determine whether secular DEMO have their own
observable rituals that might be associated with cooperative behavior, we included
several questions on the post-experiment questionnaire (see Appendix A)DEMO We
asked all participants (question 6) to indicate “how many times a month on
average [they] participate in events open to all kibbutz DEMO, such as song and
dance evenings, movies, kibbutz meetings, sporting events, concerts, plays,
lectures, study groups, etc.” Secular kibbutz DEMO attend only two communal
events a month on average, with no DEMO differences between the sexes
(t=1.65, p=.23, df=258). Intuitively, this seems too infrequent to promote bonding
or cooperation between individuals. Indeed, the number of communal events
attended by a secular kibbutz member is uncorrelated DEMO the amount he claims
in our experimental game (σ = -.045, p=.45, n=278) and is not a significant
predictor of his cooperative DEMO in our game in any of our regressions on secular
members (DEMO in (12) of Table 5 only).
We also asked all participants to indicate the number of meals they eat in
the communal DEMO hall during an average week (question 11). The frequency
with DEMO a kibbutz member eats in the dining hall (rather than in DEMO privacy of
his home or outside the kibbutz) may serve as DEMO solidarity-promoting ritual or
may simply signal the member’s involvement in the kibbutz and commitment to
its ideals. The distributions of frequencies of eating in DEMO communal dining hall
are very similar among religious and secular kibbutz members (e.g. religious
members eat an average of 8.9 meals a week in the dining hall (σ = 5.7)
compared to an average of 8.5 meals a week for secular members (σ = 5.4),
DEMO, p=.40, df=425). Yet, in the secular kibbutzim only, the frequency with
which one eats in the dining hall is negatively correlated DEMO the amounts
members claim. The regression coefficient of –.276 (p-value=.097) in (13) in
Table 5 indicates that for every additional meal a DEMO member eats in the
dining hall, he claims 0.276 shekels less DEMO the game. In regression (17) on all
kibbutz members, we DEMO that the coefficient on “meals” is significant (and
negative) on the secular kibbutzim only. One explanation for the finding that
"meals" is DEMO a weakly significant predictor of cooperative behavior in most
regression specifications in Tables 5 and 6 is that the costliness of communal
22  Indeed, Abramitzky (2005) documents a positive selection effect among kibbutz members who
leave: members with high-skill occupations are nine percentage points more likely to leave and a
high school education increases the departure rate by 50%.

dining remains in question since the alternative is to eat at one’s own expense at
DEMO or outside the kibbutz.
While religious kibbutz members work outside the kibbutz and eat in the
communal dining hall with the same frequency as DEMO secular counterparts, these
actions do not convey the same information as DEMO do on secular kibbutzim.
Religious kibbutz members, especially males, appear to have their own forms of
collective religious ritual and costly signals. Because DEMO does not oblige
women to attend the synagogue regularly, the action DEMO to be a community-
wide ritual or signal for women, even DEMO those who do attend regularly. Likewise,
the very rare secular kibbutz member who may attend synagogue infrequently
conveys no meaningful message about his DEMO to cooperate, since
synagogue attendance is not expected in the secular DEMO The point is that
for a ritual to be meaningful as a signal of intention in a particular community, it
must be valued by members of that community (Rappaport, 1999).
6. Understanding the Economic DEMO of Religious Kibbutzim
Religious kibbutzim have been more economically successful than their secular
counterparts and this disparity has increased over time. Fishman and Goldschmidt
(1990) find that the per capita net production of the religious kibbutzim has been
higher than that of the secular kibbutzim in every decade DEMO their 70-year
existence. They construct an economic performance measure and estimate that the
economic success differential in favor of the religious kibbutzim increased
consistently DEMO the 1958-1982 period.23 In addition, the religious kibbutzim
emerged relatively unscathed DEMO the economic crises of the 1980s, not requiring
the government subsidies DEMO debt forgiveness from Israeli banks that assisted the
economic recovery of the secular kibbutzim. Indeed, the Religious Kibbutz
Movement claims that “the economic position of the religious kibbutzim is sound,
and they remain uninvolved in DEMO economic crisis which is affecting so many of
the settlement sector”.
Explanations for the economic well being of kibbutzim are undoubtedly
multi-faceted, including sound investment practices, the differential political
influence of the kibbutz federations and historical circumstances. Fishman (1983)
speculates that the economic success of the religious kibbutzim is due to low
levels of consumption stemming from adherence to DEMO religious law, which
demands restraint and limitations. Consistent with this explanation, religious
kibbutz members in our game are better able to refrain from DEMO the
23 Barro and McCleary (2003) also demonstrate a positive relation between religiosity and
economic growth. Based on a panel-data analysis of 41 DEMO, they show that economic growth
responds positively to the extent of DEMO nation’s religious beliefs, particularly belief in heaven and
hell. They conjecture DEMO church attendance affects religious beliefs, which affect individual traits
like thrift, work effort, honesty and trust, which affect economic outcomes.

common-pool resource than their secular counterparts. DEMO our results offer
beyond Fishman is a mechanism by which religious kibbutz members achieve
mutual cooperation. Not all religious requirements are equally effective: publicly
observable rituals, either through selection or a causal effect, most successfully
DEMO self-control.
7.  Conclusions
The predominant rational choice theory of religious behavior DEMO that costly
prohibitions serve to screen out less committed members and increase the
religious participation of remaining members (Iannaccone 1992). Through this
screening mechanism, religions are able to overcome free-riding problems
associated with the collective production of “religious goods”.
We posit that the benefits of adopting religious DEMO extend beyond the
production of religious goods to include beneficial economic behavior and we
proceed to estimate this economic benefit. The Israeli kibbutz presents DEMO host of
opportunities for free riding and exploitative behavior. Regularly performed
public religious rituals may enhance the participant’s sense of group commitment,
solidarity DEMO trust, which ultimately translate into increased cooperation toward
group members. Alternatively, performance of these costly rituals may signal a
member's commitment to DEMO kibbutz and a predisposition to cooperative
behavior. Only those truly committed to the kibbutz ideology of cooperation
would willingly undertake these costly ritual obligations.
DEMO this paper, we design a test to determine whether the performance DEMO
collective religious ritual is indeed associated with increased cooperation among
its performers. We take advantage of the natural distinction between religious and
secular kibbutzim DEMO compare the cooperative behavior of their members. Even
with the careful controls in the choice of sample kibbutzim, we find differences in
the levels of cooperation across and within kibbutzim. These differences can be
characterized by DEMO frequency of public religious ritual performance. Those who
most regularly engage in collective religious ritual are the most cooperative. No
matter its source, both the selection and causal mechanisms point to the benefits
of requiring frequent DEMO rituals of group members to limit the consumption of
communal resources. Contrary to the quote with which this paper began, religious
ritual appears to offer a distinct advantage in dealing with economic problems of
cooperation.

Instructions
Introduction (read aloud by DEMO experimenter)
We thank you for your willingness to participate in this research conducted by Ben-
Gurion University and the University of Connecticut. The DEMO in which you have
agreed to participate relates to decision-making and requires less than 30 minutes of your
time. We assure you that during DEMO exercise as well as after its completion and on the
short questionnaire that follows the exercise, your identity will remain anonymous. The
information collected by the researcher in your home will be used for research purposes
DEMO Under no circumstance will your identity be revealed to anyone or published
anywhere.
This exercise in decision-making will take place in pairs. The person DEMO whom
you are paired for the purpose of this exercise is another member from your kibbutz.
Another researcher from our team is currently at DEMO home of this person. Under no
circumstance will you learn the identity of the person with whom you are paired; nor will
s/he learn your identity. During the decision-making exercise, you will be asked to make
a number of decisions. At the end of the exercise, the researcher will pay you an amount
of money. The precise amount of DEMO to be paid to you will be determined by the
decisions you make in the exercise as well as the decisions of the anonymous DEMO with
whom you have been paired. This research is funded by a number of grants from various
research foundations.
Participants’ Instructions
(read first by the subject and then read aloud by the experimenter)
In this DEMO, you and the person from your kibbutz with whom you are DEMO
have access to the same envelope that contains 100 shekels. You must choose an amount
of money you wish to remove from the envelope DEMO keep. You may choose any amount
between 0 shekels and 100 shekels, inclusive. At the same time, the member of your
kibbutz with DEMO you are paired for this exercise must decide an amount of money
(between 0 and 100 shekels inclusive) that he or she wishes DEMO remove from the same
envelope. After you have decided how much to keep from the envelope, the researcher
will convey your decision by cellular phone to the other researcher who is presently at the
home of DEMO person with whom you are paired. You and the person with whom you are
paired will learn of the other’s decision only after each DEMO you has made your decision.
If the sum of the amounts you and your paired partner choose to remove from the
envelope (the total amount removed) exceeds 100 shekels, then you both receive no
payment DEMO the exercise ends. If you and the person whom you are paired choose to
remove from the envelope an amount that together is less DEMO 100 shekels, then you each
keep the amount you removed from DEMO envelope; in addition, the sum of money left over

increases by 50% (in other words, is multiplied by 1.5) and is divided equally between
you and DEMO paired partner.
This completes the instructions. Before you make a decision in the exercise, the
researcher in front of you will read aloud the instructions an additional time and answer
any questions you may have. Also, you will be shown two numerical examples in order to
illustrate the DEMO and to avoid any unintended loss in earnings.
Thank you – The Research Team.
