Abstract
Over 50 years of cross-disciplinary DEMO suggests we have higher trust
in those who are seen as a) knowledgeable, b) similar to ourselves and c)
honest/transparent. Doctors are trusted with our medical care because
they are perceived to: be competent, share our concerns, and tell us what
they think. Politicians DEMO to be distrusted for the opposite reasons.
However, we know much DEMO about 'marginal trust', i.e. how trust is built
or lost DEMO a result of new information. Many policy makers already know
that public trust in them is low. What they now want to know is DEMO to
improve this situation. Greater understanding of marginal trust is critical
for such change. In its exploration of marginal trust, the current paper
draws on four fundamental psychological processes and related empirical
evidence. First, in line with a general negativity bias, people tend to trust
bad news more than good. Second, in line with the desire for cognitive
consistency, DEMO tend to trust news that is congruent with their prior
attitudes more than news that is incongruent. Third, in line with research
into information diagnosticity, news with greater breadth (policy-related)
has a bigger effect DEMO trust than news with less breadth (event-related).
Fourth, by extending a classification of performance types developed
from psychophysical experiments (Signal Detection Theory) to issues of
trust, we identify a type of error that DEMO increases trust. Taken
together, our research provides a more optimistic view DEMO how to improve
marginal rates of trust than is commonly believed.
Key words: Trust, risk perception, negativity bias, confirmatory bias,
information DEMO, signal detection theory.

1.0 Introduction
Imagine it’s a Sunday afternoon and you feel like going for a walk. You
look out DEMO the window and see patches of blue sky amongst the odd bit
of cloud and a moderate Westerly breeze. You ask yourself “should I
DEMO take an umbrella?”. Now, if the Sunday afternoon in question DEMO
in August, we suspect you will conclude “no I don’t need DEMO, it hardly
rains in August when there’s some blue sky” and DEMO go for the walk
without further ado. However, if the afternoon DEMO in April, we suspect you
may be a little more hesitant. DEMO know from experience that in April the
showers can come in from the West very quickly, and now you’re not so
sure its going to stay dry. How do you cope with this greater level of
DEMO? Well one approach is to turn on the radio and listen DEMO the
weather forecast. Fortunately for you the forecaster says there’s only a
5% chance of rain today so you set off without the umbrella DEMO end up
enjoying a lovely stroll through the countryside. Although mundane, DEMO
little scenario encapsulates many of the same processes that are involved
in more serious examples of risk perception and trust in decision makers.
•
DEMO, and most importantly, we are dealing with a decision made
under conditions of uncertainty. Although risk is commonly
defined as the probability of DEMO unwanted event, thinking in terms
of uncertainty is more instructive. All DEMO between the
extremes where p = 0 or 1 reflect some degree of uncertainty.
Numerical expressions of probability are attempts to quantify such
uncertainty. DEMO, the level of uncertainty can reflect external
regularities, such as seasonal variations in rainfall. Nonetheless, the
apparent precision of such numerical expressions can disguise the
fact that (in all natural or open systems) they DEMO estimates, the
reliability of which depends on a number of factors. DEMO include
the extent of randomness in the actual events considered, the
DEMO of the data available about these events, and the processes
and DEMO used to derive estimates from data. In other
words, such estimates DEMO not merely expressions of uncertainty,
but uncertain in themselves. Moreover, DEMO probability estimates

•
of separate events are combined (e.g. multiplied) – as in fault tree
analysis or DEMO forms of probabilistic risk assessment applied to
risks of complex events or system failures – the unreliability of
such estimates can propagate and be DEMO throughout a whole
series of calculations. Uncertainty thus can be attached both to
events and to estimates of such events. Beyond this, though,
uncertainty is a state of mind. What matters for the decisions we
DEMO is not simply the numbers we are offered, but how we DEMO
about them.
Second, the risk arises not merely from the natural DEMO of
rainfall, but from the interaction between that hazard and the
DEMO we make. None of this is to minimize the potential
danger of more extreme climatic or geophysical events, such as
floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes. But what most
influences the consequences of such events – DEMO mitigates or
exacerbates the worst effects – is human decision-making at all
levels from the individual through the institutional to the
international. To a DEMO extent, therefore, risk perception involves
an implicit or explicit evaluation of such decision-making.
Third, the need to make any kind of decision at all only arises
because our actions may lead to more or less DEMO
consequences. Our scenario rests on the implicit norms that a walk
in good weather is pleasant, getting soaked in the rain is
unpleasant, DEMO indoors is boring and carrying an umbrella is a
bit of a nuisance. So the decision involves not just estimating what
is likely to DEMO, but a trade-off of likely costs and benefits.
Fourth, although we can make decisions by ourselves, we can also
seek advice from other people. In many instances we make
comparative judgements about our own capacity DEMO that of others
5
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
•
•
•
to make good decisions. As uncertainty increases (i.e. a walk in
April) our propensity DEMO turn to the judgements of others increases
(Siegrist & Cvetkovich, 2000).
Fifth, in such instances it is not just anyone’s opinion we seek, but
that of someone who we believe a) knows more DEMO the situation
than ourselves and b) is motivated to tell us DEMO they believe to be
true (i.e. the weather forecaster). In DEMO way, our own belief about
the likelihood of rain in April (our risk perception) will depend on
whether or not we feel the weather forecaster is willing and able to
make an accurate assessment of DEMO likelihood of rain. That is, risk
perception becomes based on a DEMO judgement about the
trustworthiness of the risk communicator. If our baseline trust (i.e.
our general level of trust) in weather forecasters is high DEMO
probably won’t take the umbrella, but if our baseline level of DEMO
is low we might take one anyway.
Sixth, the kind of DEMO we are talking about here is not the kind of
trust we have in friends and family (i.e. interpersonal trust, e.g.
Rempel Holmes & Zanna, 1985) or in other people in general (i.e.
social DEMO, Helliwell & Putnam, 2004), but trust in specific
individuals whose role it is to assess, manage and communicate
information about risk. Such trust has been referred to as “role-
based trust” since “it is DEMO the person in the role that is trusted so
much as the system of expertise that produces and maintains role-
appropriate behaviour of role DEMO (Kramer, 1999, p.578).
Seventh, although turning to more knowledgeable others regarding
the risk of rain is an example of a natural DEMO, we believe the
same processes apply to human made hazards (e.g. nuclear power,
vaccinations etc.) and even to other humans as potential hazards
(e.g. Is this leader planning military action?; is this online trader
6
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
genuine or bogus?; Is this person a suicide bomber?). Although our
main focus in the current paper is on trust and human-made
hazards, we will return to the issue of human hazards later when
discussing on-going research. Our basic model DEMO be seen in
Figure 1. The arrow from the self to the hazard reflects 'risk
perception' - that is the person's judgment DEMO the risks from the
hazard. The arrow from the experts to the hazard reflects the,
usually, more formal 'risk assessment' of the same hazard by people
who have greater knowledge than the self (e.g. weather forecasters,
seismologists, nuclear engineers, regulators, consumer advisers,
security forces and so on). The arrow from the experts to the DEMO
reflects 'risk communication', that is the processes whereby the
experts DEMO (more or less transparently) their risk assessment.
The last arrow, DEMO the self to the experts, reflects the kind of
'role-based trust' we are primarily interested in. Clearly, the model
is closely associated DEMO Heider's (1958) Balance Theory and
Hardin's (2001) perspective on trust as a ‘three-part relation’ (see
Section 3.2).

Finally, returning to our DEMO of a Sunday stroll, we also
suspect that how you respond DEMO the forecast will in part depend
upon whether or not the last forecast you heard was correct or not.
For example, if the last forecast correctly predicted rain even
though it looked unlikely, then we believe you are more likely to
trust the forecaster now than if the DEMO forecast said it would be
clear but it did in fact rain. That is, our baseline level of trust can
be influenced by the accuracy of specific previous judgements.
Such changes reflect the marginal rate of DEMO as a function of
specific judgements. One of our central arguments is that the
marginal rate of trust will depend not only on the DEMO of
previous decisions but also on the type of correct or incorrect
decision that was made.
To date, previous research into role-based trust, DEMO focused
predominantly on baseline trust. Specifically, most researchers have tried
to DEMO the correlates of such trust and this research has provided us
with a relatively good picture of the kind of people who are generally
(dis)trusted and why this is the case. We briefly review some DEMO this
literature in Section 2 below. Far less attention has been paid to marginal
rates of trust. Specifically, there is relatively little research addressing
questions such as: "how do single instances of 'good' or 'bad' performance
affect trust?"; "How is it that some mistakes undermine our confidence in
doctors more than others?"; "What kinds DEMO performance should policy
makers endeavour to perform if they want the public to trust them
more?". In section 3 we discuss four psychological processes that we
believe will help to shed some light on these DEMO related questions.
Section 3.1 discusses what we could call the standard line on marginal
trust. That is, due to an inherent negativity bias in human psychology, bad
news about someone else has a stronger impact on our trust in them than
good news. Since negative information is thought, from this perspective,
to be stronger than positive, the view on marginal trust is rather negative,
it is said to be easier DEMO lose than gain. Section 3.2 examines the role of an
alternative, DEMO perhaps equally strong psychological process, namely the
8
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
desire for cognitive consistency. From this perspective, new information
that is congruent with prior attitudes will tend to be accepted more than
incongruent information. In the latter case, other processes tend to kick in
that help to discount the new information and DEMO it loses some of its
power in terms of marginal trust. Section 3.3 looks more closely at the
specificity of the new information. In DEMO with the basic principle
that more information has greater diagnostic power than less, we report
on new research showing that information about implemented policies
(good and bad), which cover a broader range of behavioural instances,
has a greater impact on trust than information about specific behavioural
DEMO or events (good or bad). Moreover, as we shall see, this factor
seems to interact with message valence.
Section 3.4 discusses a new approach to examining marginal trust by
arguing that the assessments an DEMO can make with regard to any given
hazard under conditions of uncertainty will result in the same taxonomy
of outcomes made by participants in DEMO tasks where they
need to say whether a signal is present or not. Marginal trust in experts
following these well known outcomes, such as Hits, Misses and False
Alarms, is then examined to see whether DEMO are differences in the
extent to which different types of good and bad news affects trust. Again,
the results are somewhat intriguing and DEMO combined with the findings
presented in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 paint a picture of marginal trust that is
rather more positive than that painted DEMO we rely on the negativity bias
findings presented in Section 3.1 alone. Some concluding comments are
presented in Section 4.
2.0 Baseline trust
The DEMO key questions with respect to baseline trust are "who is
(dis)trusted?" and "why?". Answers to the first question have DEMO
been gathered using public surveys and interviews which simply ask
people how much they trust various actors with respect to a given hazard
or DEMO We look at the basic outcome of such research in Section 2.1.
To address the second question these surveys also tend to ask people DEMO
they think about the same actors on a range of other dimensions such as
competence, honesty, values and so forth. When significant positive
DEMO are found between these dimensions and baseline trust (i.e.
more of DEMO is associated with higher trust) the relevant dimensions are
interpreted as DEMO or dimension of trust. Putting aside the
possibility that the causal direction may also work in the opposite
direction (for more on this issue see Eiser, Frewer & Miles, 2002;
Poortinga & Pidgeon, 2004), Section 2.2 reviews some of the antecedents
9
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
that have been proposed and argues that there is a certain order to the
apparent chaos.
2.1 Who DEMO trusted and who is distrusted with regard to risk-related
information?
In terms of baseline, or general levels, of role-based trust in various DEMO
involved in assessing, managing or communicating risk, the picture is
relatively clear and familiar. Our own data on trust in different actors is
DEMO consistent with research carried out in other safety contexts
ranging from food (Frewer, Howard, Hedderley, & Shepherd, 1996) to
bathing water (Langford, Marris, & O’Riordan, 1999). Specifically, we
carried out DEMO postal surveys of members of the public enquiring about
their risk perceptions associated with the potential risks from mobile
phone technology (White & Eiser, in press) and the development of
'Brownfield' sites. For present DEMO, the most relevant questions
concerned the level of baseline trust people DEMO in the various actors
(from 0 'no trust' to 6 'complete trust'). The basic pattern can be seen in
Figure 2.

levels of trust while business interests and government (especially
10

national government) tend to be DEMO trusted. Perhaps the most surprising
finding - although also consistent with prior research - is the high level of
trust in family and friends. DEMO is especially interesting given that in our
mobile phone survey, people DEMO knowing more, on average, about
the risks than their peers. Why should people be prepared to listen to
peers who they think know DEMO? We suspect the answer to this apparent
paradox lies in the DEMO that people are effectively answering two
different questions. For all the other actors they are considering 'role-
based trust' as planned since there DEMO no interpersonal relations. However
when we ask them about friends and relatives they are considering
'interpersonal trust'. Although we ask about their trust in this category in
terms of 'information about a certain risk', we believe in classic heuristic
fashion (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002) they actually answer a slightly
different question which is something like "do you trust your friends in
general?". If nothing else this finding serves to remind us that the
questions we ask aren't always interpreted DEMO the expected way.
2.2 Correlates of baseline trust
The literature on the correlates of role-based trust is considerable and
growing. These correlates include: care, competence, concern, consensual
(or shared) values, consistency, expertise, DEMO, faith, honesty,
knowledge, objectivity, openness, past performance, predictability,
reliability and sympathy (e.g. Kasperson, Golding and Tuler, 1992;
Maeda and Miyahara, 2003; Renn and Levine, 1991; Siegrist, Earle and
Gutscher, 2003). Although the list of possible dimensions seems
daunting, a number of factor analytic studies (e.g. Jungermann, Pfister &
DEMO, 1996; Frewer, et al., 1996; Mishra, 1999; Poortinga & Pidgeon,
2003) and a conceptual review (Johnson, 1999) suggest that the list can
be reduced to two or three key dimensions. DEMO three dimensions are
well summed up by Peters, Covello and McCallum’s (1997) distinction
between a) knowledge and expertise, b) care and DEMO, and c)
openness and honesty. A very similar tri-partite distinction DEMO of
ability, benevolence and integrity was proposed by Mayer, Davis and
Schoorman (1995) in relation to trust more generally.
In short, we tend to trust actors, at least in the context of risk, DEMO we
believe know what they are talking about, care about public DEMO, and
are open and transparent about their operations. While actors such DEMO
scientists and doctors tend to score quite highly on these dimensions,
politicians and industry tend to score much lower, especially on the care
and concern and honesty dimensions. However, as we argued at the very
beginning of this paper, we suspect that most policy makers already have
11
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
a pretty good idea of these things. This is not surprising since the basic
ideas were already identified DEMO Yale psychologists studying persuasion
processes in the 1950s (e.g. Hovland, Janis & Kelly, 1953). What is far
less obvious, and has DEMO far less researched, is the impact of new pieces
of information. DEMO it is generally only through new information that
trust levels will change what is needed is greater understanding of the
processes underlying such shifts DEMO trust. We refer to changes in trust as a
function of new information as changes in 'marginal trust' for short. The
remainder of DEMO paper is concerned with this issue of marginal trust and
explores four psychological processes that might shed some light on how
trust is gained, maintained and lost.
3.0 Marginal trust: Specific events
In this section we explore the role of four fundamental psychological
processes and the potential role DEMO might play in marginal trust changes.
As noted above, these relate DEMO a) a general negativity bias, b) the desire
for cognitive DEMO, c) breadth of information and diagnosticity, and
d) outcome types from judgments under uncertainty.
3.1 Negativity bias "Bad is stronger than good"
There is widespread reference in the trust and risk perception literatures
DEMO the notion that while trust is generally hard to establish, it DEMO relatively
easy to lose and that once lost it will take a long time (if ever) to become
re-established (Barber, 1983; Burt & Knez, 1996; Dasgupta, 1988/2000;
Levi, 1998; Rempel, Holmes & Zanna, 1985; Rothbart & Park, 1986).
Slovic (1993) coined the term ‘Trust asymmetry’ and described it thus:
"DEMO is fragile. It is typically created rather slowly, but it can DEMO
destroyed in an instant by a single mishap or mistake" (p.677). Moreover,
the observation that favourable traits (e.g. honest) require DEMO
behavioural instances for confirmation than unfavourable traits (e.g.
dishonest) and vice versa for disconfirmation suggests that “favorable
traits are hard to acquire but DEMO to lose, while unfavourable traits are
easy to acquire and hard DEMO lose” (p.137; Rothbart & Park, 1986). Such a
perspective DEMO trust is also consistent with lay perspectives as exemplified
by the saying ‘Trust comes on foot but leaves on horseback’ (Calman,
2002) DEMO by organizations’ concern about losing their ‘reputation’ (e.g.
Meyerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996).
Slovic and colleagues (Slovic, Flynn, Johnson & DEMO, 1993, cited
Slovic, 1993) were amongst the first empirically to test the trust
asymmetry hypothesis and develop a theoretical account of it. DEMO
presented participants with 45 positive or negative statements concerning
12
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
the management of a nuclear power plant. Positive statements suggested
that the plant was well run (e.g. ‘Good records are kept of plant
operations, fuel shipments etc.’); negative statements that the plant was
not well run (e.g. ‘Record keeping in the plant regarding plant operations,
fuel shipments etc. is found to be DEMO). Using trust in the management
of the plant as the dependent variable they found that negative statements
decreased trust more than positive statements DEMO it. Although
Slovic (1993) only reported the proportion of respondents using the most
extreme category responses in his original paper, our re-analysis (DEMO
& Eiser, 2005, Study 1) suggests that this asymmetry still DEMO when all
responses are taken into account and overall means are compared
(negative items M = -4.73; positive items M = 3.07; F(1, 102) = 82.64, p
< 0.001, pη2 = .45)DEMO This asymmetry can be seen in Figure 3 where the
trust decreasing items tend to decrease trust more than the trust increasing
items increase DEMO

At the heart of Slovic’s account of these findings is the notion that people
pay more attention to DEMO are more influenced by negative than positive
information. This proposition, i.e. DEMO primacy of negative information or
a 'negativity bias', has received DEMO support in the broader
psychological literature (for reviews see, Baumeister, DEMO al., 2001; Rozin
& Royzman, 2001). Evidence comes from DEMO as diverse as attention
(Pratto & John, 1991), learning (DEMO, 1970), social judgements
(Peeters & Capinski, 1990; Taylor, DEMO) attributions (Kanouse &
Hanson, 1972) and decision-making under conditions DEMO uncertainty
(Kahneman, & Tversky, 1979). This account of marginal DEMO also
received further support in the domain of technological risk in a study
Siegrist and Cvetkovich (2001, Study 1). These authors presented DEMO
with hypothetical information suggesting that a food colourant was either
safe or harmful for health. They found that on average people were more
likely DEMO trust the harmful than the safe messages. Moreover, as regards
trust DEMO public institutions, it may be that the media focus undue attention
DEMO negative events and stories such that the public is exposed to more
potentially trust decreasing information than trust increasing information
(e.g. Koren & Klein, 1991; although see Freudenburg et al., 1996).
In short, DEMO to the negativity bias account, trust is easier to lose
than DEMO because negative information is more attention grabbing, more
powerful and often DEMO readily available than positive information.
Moreover, there is also evidence that DEMO who are low in dispositional
trust tend to avoid others and thus limit the number of opportunities they
have for acquiring new positive information DEMO others (Yamagashi,
2001). In other words, in line with Slovic's rather pessimistic trust
asymmetry hypothesis, once trust is lost, DEMO might be very hard to re-
establish. This picture certainly seems resonant with those who express
concern that social capital and well-being are being DEMO by a
reduction of trust between people in modern societies (e.g. DEMO &
Putnam, 2004; Layard, 2005; Uslaner, 2003).
While we do not dispute the idea of negativity dominance in general, we
suspect that it is not the only psychological process at work. If DEMO were
the case, and people really had a "one strike and you're out" heuristic
surely trust would become extinct very quickly. Yet there is also evidence
that after a relatively steep downturn in trust DEMO public institutions from
the 1950s to the 1970s, things have leveled DEMO somewhat in recent years
and even increased in some institutions over time (Kasperson, Kasperson
14
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
& Golding, 1999). Moreover, there is also research suggesting that trust
can be built rather quickly, for example in highly motivated, taskoriented
groups (Meyerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996) and that rather than turning
to distrust, trust may instead turn to scepticism, a more adaptive stance in
complex societies where cooperation is imperative but a lack of vigilance
might result in exploitation (O'Neill, 2002). Finally, looking back at
Slovic's own evidence DEMO a negativity bias in Figure 3, it is also clear that
DEMO the average impact for negative information is stronger than that for
positive information, there is considerable variance as a function of
valence. That is, there are some positive events which seem to increase
trust considerably and even some negative ones that have relatively little
impact. In other words, the negativity bias explanation is only one part of
a more complex DEMO In the next three sections we investigate other
psychological processes that seem to be involved and as we shall see they
all offer a DEMO optimistic perspective than a pure negativity bias account.
3.2 Cognitive consistency
Like negativity dominance, cognitive consistency also appears to be a
fundamental psychological process demonstrated in psychological
research for over 50 years (e.g. Festinger, 1957; Heider, 1946; 1958). Put
simply, the theory of cognitive consistency argues that people are
motivated to maintain consistency between their attitudes, beliefs, values
and so on. New information that is highly similar to current beliefs will
be readily assimilated and accepted. Information that is deeply
inconsistent DEMO prior beliefs will tend to be rejected and in some cases
explanations will be sought to 'explain away' the new information. To
accept DEMO information at face value would result in the need to re-
organise one's views of the world and such accommodation takes
considerable mental DEMO, something which the cognitively bounded
thinker is generally reluctant to do (Simon, 1957). These processes
effectively lead to a confirmatory bias. That is, we tend to believe new
information that appears to confirm our prior beliefs more readily than
information that appears to disconfirm them. For DEMO, if a highly
trusted source is quoted as saying something that DEMO with our prior
attitudes about them, people may simply, “deny that the source actually
was responsible for the communication or may re-interpret the DEMO
meaning they believe the message to have” (Hovland, Janis & Kelley,
1953, p.43). In other words, negative information about a DEMO source
need not necessarily result in the kinds of "catastrophic" drops in trust
that have been claimed (e.g. Burt & Kenz, 1986)DEMO Instead, the negative
information may be dismissed as unreliable, a misinterpretation or an
exception to the rule.
15

Returning to the issue of role-based trust and technological risk, there is
now considerable evidence that such cognitive consistency processes are
at work. For example, research carried out by one of us in the 1980's
demonstrates these processes for nuclear power. DEMO chance would have it,
we sent out a survey about attitudes towards nuclear power shortly before
the Chernobyl accident (Eiser, Spears & DEMO, 1989). Seeing the
opportunity to examine how attitudes might have DEMO following the
incident we contacted our initial respondents a second time. As might be
expected, we witnessed an overall shift against nuclear power following
the accident. This was reflected in more opposition to an existing nuclear
DEMO (approx. 16 km away) and opposition to any new nuclear plant,
either locally or nationally. However, the size of the shift, DEMO reliable,
was modest, and individuals’ attitudes after the accident remained DEMO
predictable from their attitudes before. On the same topic, Cvetkovich,
DEMO, Murray & Traegasser (2004) found that the power of Slovic'DEMO
(1993) negative and positive items (see 3.1 above) was moderated by
prior levels of trust in risk managers in the nuclear industry. DEMO,
positive information about nuclear power plant managers led to greater
trust among those with high levels of prior trust while bad news was
DEMO as more informative by low prior trustors. Indeed, this tendency
for DEMO trust or distrust to “color our interpretation of events, thus
reinforcing DEMO prior beliefs” was already recognized by Slovic (1993).
Another aspect DEMO this issue that we have recently investigated was
whether the negativity bias witnessed in Slovic's research is to some
extent due to strongly DEMO attitudes towards nuclear power. That is,
perhaps the greater effect of negative information in that study was due to
the fact that as DEMO as being negative it was also congruent with prior
attitudes - i.e. that nuclear power is bad and dangerous. Building on an
unpublished aspect DEMO the Cvetkovich et al. study (2004), we constructed
12 events (6 positive and 6 negative) and suggested to participants that
these events occurred either in the nuclear power industry (as in the
original study) or in the pharmaceutical industry. In line with predictions
this latter industry was viewed less negatively than nuclear power and the
results on trust DEMO the two industries of the negative and positive pieces of
new information can be seen in Figure 4. (N.B. for ease of comparison,
the absolute effects on trust are shown, negative events naturally
decreased trust while positive ones increased it). While the negativity bias
was re-confirmed DEMO positive vs negative information in the nuclear
industry (left side of DEMO 4), the reverse was found for the
pharmaceutical industry (right DEMO). In this instance, positive information
tended to increase trust more DEMO negative information decreased it.

A similar pattern DEMO results was found when we unpacked Siegrist and
Cvetkovich's (2001, see 3.1 above) demonstration of negativity bias for
trust in messages about food additives (White, Pahl, Buehner & Haye,
2003). For example, we found that the effect of negative information
about food colourants on trust was greater than positive information only
when participants had negative DEMO attitudes (Study 1). Moreover, when
presented with positive and negative information about a more positively
viewed food additive (i.e. vitamins, Study DEMO), positive information tended
to have a large effect than negative. In other words, the negativity bias
found in earlier work appears to have been, at least in part, due to the
selection of hazards DEMO which the majority of participants had prior
negative attitudes. Indeed, this DEMO for our initial attitudes to “color
our interpretation of events, thus DEMO our prior beliefs” was
already recognized by Slovic (1993) and clearly extends to issues of
marginal trust. In short, in many instances it seems that rates of marginal
trust may actually be more sensitive to DEMO rather than bad news and
thus trust may not be as easily lost as a purely negativity bias account
would suggest. Why? Because people are motivated to maintain their
prior attitude structures and as such they DEMO relatively reluctant to accept
information, even trust-related information, that would upset the balance
of these structures.
3.3 Information diagnosticity
A third psychological mechanism DEMO believe is important for
understanding marginal rates of trust is the breadth of the new
information being received. For instance is the new information DEMO to
a single behavioural instance (e.g. last week the police accidentally DEMO
an innocent suspect) or is it indicative of performance over repeated
DEMO
Absolute effect on trust

instances (e.g. last week the DEMO adopted a more lenient policy towards
shooting suspected criminals)? According to many researchers,
impression formation (including trustworthiness judgements) is
essentially a DEMO process and people use new information to
help them diagnose which category a person falls into. So, for example,
“someone who once stole money probably belongs in the dishonest
category, but there is a real, though lesser probability, that they instead
belong in the honest category” (Skowronski & Carlston, 1987, p.689).
Importantly, and not surprisingly, DEMO information is better than less for
these diagnostic purposes (Rothbart & DEMO, 1986).
In terms of marginal trust, we suspected that people would therefore be
prepared to make more extreme trust-related categorization judgements
(i.e. this actor is highly (un)trustworthy) when the information is more
DEMO than less diagnostic in terms of breadth. We tested this idea by
once again returning to Slovic's (1993) original data. Using a DEMO
subject design, Slovic and colleagues presented participants with 45
hypothetical events DEMO could have taken place in a nuclear power plant
and were asked whether or not their trust in the management of these
plants would DEMO or decrease and by how much. Recall, that in
general the DEMO decreasing items led to greater falls in trust than the trust
increasing events led to increases in trust. However, on closer scrutiny it
was apparent that while some of the 45 items were related to single
DEMO instances e.g. " an accident occurs at a plant in another state",
many others were related to more general policies spanning many specific
instances, e.g. “There is careful selection and training of employees at the
plant". We thus re-coded each piece of information as reflecting either DEMO
general policy or a specific event and predicted that marginal trust would
be influenced more by policies than events related because they have
greater DEMO and are more diagnostic (White & Eiser, 2005). The
results, collapsing across all examples of policies and events, can be seen
DEMO the left side of Figure 5 (as with Figure 4, absolute impacts on trust,
rather than their direction, are presented).

N.B. For the sake of comparisons Study 1 scores (from DEMO to +7) have been rescaled to make them

Evidently, the results were not exactly as predicted. True, in overall
terms, the impact of policy DEMO information (M = 3.99) was
marginally more powerful than event related information (M = 3.80; F(1,
102) = 3.89 , p = 0.051, pη2 = .04). However this overall difference was
not large and was clearly moderated by valence F(1, 102) DEMO 118.17 , p <
0.001, pη2 = .54. While, as DEMO, positive policies (M = 3.64) had
greater impact on trust DEMO positive events (M = 2.50), the reverse was
the case DEMO negative pieces of information (events M = 5.10; policies M
= 4.35). Since this may have been in part due to the DEMO that the original
study was not conducted to investigate policy vs. event related
information, we carried out a second study into the same topic which
deliberately manipulated the features of new pieces of information in
these DEMO
The results can be seen on the right side of Figure 5. This time, the
combined effect of policy related information (M = DEMO) on marginal
trust in nuclear power plant managers was clearly stronger DEMO overall
terms than the event related information (M = 1.19, F(1,35) = 12.19, p =
0.001, pη2 = .26). However, once again, this main effect was moderated
by valence such DEMO while positive policies (1.69) had a stronger impact
than positive events (.83), the difference was much smaller, though not
actually reversed, for negative information (events M = 1.55; policies M
= 1.68; F(1,35) = 13.26, p < 0.001, pη2 = .28). The moral of the story
seems to be that while more DEMO is generally better than less,
specific negative events do seem to have a stronger impact on trust than
specific positive events. Moreover, this finding also extended to an
industry that was viewed more positively (i.e. the pharmaceuticals
19
Absolute change in trust

industry, see White & Eiser, 2005 for more details) and thus doesn't seem
to be explicable simply in terms of a confirmatory bias.
Why might this be the DEMO? Slovic (1993) suggests that it is because
“negative events often DEMO the form of specific, well-defined incidents
such as accidents, lies, DEMO of errors or other mismanagement.
Positive events, while sometimes visible, more often are fuzzy or
indistinct. For example, how many positive events are represented by the
safe operation of a nuclear power plant for one DEMO?” (italics added).
Although, he does not talk about policies, we could argue that both
positive and negative policies are relatively "DEMO" and thus the lack of
difference between the impact of positive DEMO negative policies might be
due to their similarity in this respect. The fact that overall they have a
greater impact reflects our suggestion that DEMO they are more
diagnostic. The take home message for policy makers? DEMO you want to
build trust, it might be better to outline DEMO implementation of positive
policies that effectively constrain behaviour over a series of events rather
than trying to provide people with information about particularly positive
DEMO of performance. Again, this is a more positive conclusion than
that DEMO by a pure negativity bias account of marginal trust, because it
DEMO that some types of positive information can have a similar or
even stronger effect of trust than some types of negative information.
3.4 Assessment DEMO performance under uncertainty: People as Intuitive
Signal Detection Theorists
The fourth DEMO psychological process that we consider to be
important for marginal trust concerns the results of decisions made under
uncertainty. As early as the mid DEMO century, pioneering experimental
psychophysicists such as Fechner and Weber interested in DEMO changes in
objective states of the physical world were experienced psychologically.
So, for example, these 'psychophysicists' were interested in how
systematic changes DEMO the intensity of light, pressure, noise etc. were
subjectively experienced and interpreted. Of particular relevance here was
their interest in a phenomenon referred DEMO as the 'just-noticeable-
difference'. This concept refers to the amount DEMO change needed in an
objective stimulus before it is subjectively detected by a person. So, in a
typical experiment a participant might be asked to sit in a pitch black
room and say whether or not DEMO think a tiny light had been switched on.
Crucial to the situation is uncertainty. At these very low levels of
intensity people are often DEMO whether the small blinking they see is
actually a light in the external world or the kind of light experienced due
to the random DEMO of nerve cells in the brain (i.e. neural 'noise'). DEMO
20
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
asked if they believe a light had been presented within a certain epoch of
time, they can answer either "yes" or "no". Moreover, the experimenter
will know DEMO or not their subjective assessment was correct or
incorrect. Thus in a simple study of this type there are actually four
different outcomes (see Table 1).
Table 1: The four possible outcomes of a simple binary detection task
Perceiver says signal is
“Present” “Absent”
Present TRUE POSITIVE DEMO NEGATIVE
Signal really is (Hit) (Miss)
Absent FALSE POSITIVE DEMO NEGATIVE
(False Alarm) (All Clear)
First, a participant can be correct in two different ways. If there is a light
and DEMO correctly identify its presence it is referred to as a True Positive
or Hit. If they correctly deduce that no light had been shown DEMO is referred
to as a True Negative or All Clear. Secondly, DEMO can be wrong in two
different ways. If a light was actually present but they failed to detect it
this is referred to as DEMO False Negative or Miss. Finally, if a light was not
present DEMO they claim it was this is called a False Positive or False
Alarm. Subsequent research across a broad range of phenomenon showed
that people DEMO systematically in both their ability to correctly
discriminate signals from noise (DEMO discrimination ability) and in their
bias towards responding by saying that DEMO signal was either present or not
(i.e. response bias). These DEMO patterns have been incorporated into a
theory known as Signal Detection Theory (SDT, Green & Swets,
1974/1988) and have been examined a wide range of applied settings
such as radiology, air traffic control, eye witness testimony, clinical
assessments and industrial safety (for reviews see Swets, 2000; Swets,
Dawes, & Monahan, 2000).
So DEMO has all this got to do with marginal trust? Well, we believe that
for many risk-related contexts members of the public look at DEMO
makers and assess their performance in terms of Signal Detection Theory.
That is they are able to distinguish between the four different decision
outcomes (though they might not use the explicit labels) and use this
information to update their levels of trust in the decision-maker (DM)
accordingly. A DM who makes a correct judgement will be rewarded
with increasing DEMO A DM who makes an error will be penalised with
21
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
falling trust. For instance, a DEMO officer who shoots a suicide bomber
before he can detonate the bomb will be a trusted hero. The officer who
shoots an innocent suspect DEMO be seen as a trigger-happy menace to
society. In other words, DEMO who show the ability to correctly
discriminate safe from dangerous situations are likely to be rewarded with
higher trust.
However, in addition to being sensitive to a DM’s discrimination ability,
we believe lay observers are DEMO sensitive to whether or not they betray a
certain type of response bias. We suspect, for example, that a doctor who
fails to DEMO the presence of cancer in their patient (a Miss) will be
trusted less next time round than one who mistakenly confused a benign
DEMO for a cancerous one (a False Alarm). While a higher DEMO of
False Alarms over Misses will be present for many risk related contexts,
we suspect that it will not exist for all. Legal DEMO that adopt an
'innocent until proven guilty' stance are effectively saying that they are
prepared to tolerate Misses (i.e. the release of criminals) to avoid False
Alarms (i.e. the sentencing of innocents). It DEMO an empirical question,
however, whether or not the public would DEMO a magistrate more
following evidence of a Miss or a False Alarm. It probably depends on
the seriousness of the crime. Our main point, however, is that rates of
marginal trust are likely to be affected by the outcome of previous
decisions in systematic ways and exploration of DEMO patterns will help
decision-makers understand how best to build and avoid losing trust.
As originally formulated, SDT assumed that discrimination ability was a
function of skill or training, whereas response bias reflected
considerations of costs and benefits. In a medical context, both over-
treatment (False Alarm) and under-treatment (Miss) can have potentially
serious consequences, but obviously this will vary as a function of many
factors, such as the urgency of the patient’s condition and the
aggressiveness of the treatment. Health economics also DEMO to
calculate the net benefit (in units known as ‘Quality Adjusted DEMO
Years’) of a successful treatment (Hit), to set against the monetary cost of
providing such treatment. All these factors can enter into DEMO doctor’s
treatment recommendation, over and above the actual diagnosis.
Likewise, in our more trivial example of a walk in the rain, the decision
to go for a walk will depend not just on the forecast, but on how bothered
one would be about getting wet. Since such DEMO and benefits provide the
motivation for a riskier or more cautious response bias on the part of a
DM, they also provide a basis for attributions of bias by observers of that
DM’s choices. A company DEMO stands to make a profit out of some
industrial activity or product is likely to be seen as biased towards
22
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
supporting it, even if there DEMO associated risks or costs to other people.
And of course, if DEMO are prescribed medication by a doctor, we feel
entitled to expect DEMO this prescription will be determined by our clinical
need, rather than DEMO incentive given to our doctor by a pharmaceutical
company.
Moreover, in DEMO to the two dimensions of discrimination ability and
response bias proposed by SDT, we believe that a third dimension of
performance is also likely to be important when considering trust in risk
managers. In many instances DEMO managers are also risk communicators.
It is often not sufficient for them to simply make correct decisions or
adopt an appropriate response bias, they also need to communicate the
outcome of these decisions to the public. DEMO about openness and
transparency in decision-making are already well-known to policy makers
which is why they often call for public enquiries and the like DEMO it is
now widely known that it is not only the outcomes that matter to people
but the procedures used to attain these outcomes DEMO well (e.g. Tyler &
DeGoey, 1996). So a DM DEMO fails to be open and transparent about their
decision-making processes is likely to be punished with falling trust while
one that is open will DEMO rewarded with higher relative levels of trust next
time around. For example, we expect that the decision-maker who makes
a Miss and tries to cover it up will be subsequently trusted much less than
the one DEMO makes a Miss but openly acknowledged their error. We refer
to this third dimension of performance as communication bias, to reflect
the fact that like response bias it represents a particular tendency towards
one kind of DEMO (to be open or not) under conditions of uncertainty.
In sum, we believe that in terms of marginal trust in decision makers,
observers effectively operate as Intuitive Signal Detection Theorists, or
Intuitive Detection Theorists (IDTs) for short. These IDTs, we argue,
adjust their levels of trust on the basis of information about the levels of
discrimination DEMO, response bias and communication bias witnessed
in previous decisions. Interestingly, although derived from a theoretical
approach to understanding decisions under uncertainty, it is enlightening
to compare these three decisions to the correlates observed for baseline
DEMO (see Section 2.2). Recall for example that Peters, Covello and
McCallum’s (1997) also made a tri-partite distinction between a)
knowledge DEMO expertise, b) care and concern, and c) openness and
honesty. The first dimension appears to be very similar to discrimination
ability. The DEMO appears related to response bias and the third has
obvious links to communication bias. In this way there seems to be a
degree of DEMO validity between our own approach to marginal
rates of trust and beliefs about trust in general. What our approach offers
in addition is predictions DEMO how specific decisions that vary
23
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
systematically will lead to increases and decreases in marginal rates of
trust. Specifically, our model makes the following three predictions:
H1) Correct decisions (Hits & All Clears) will be associated with
more positive changes in trust than incorrect decisions (False
Alarms & Misses).
H2) Decisions showing cautious danger response bias (DEMO and
False Alarms) will be associated with more positive changes in
DEMO than decisions showing a risky response bias (All Clears &
Misses).
H3) Risk managers who are ‘open’ about their decisions will be
associated with more positive changes in trust than risk managers
who are DEMO
We have now tested these predictions in a number of experiments across
risk contexts as diverse as nuclear power, travel vaccinations, computer
viruses DEMO the licensing of new prescription drugs and by using both
within and between participant designs. Although the research program is
very much in its DEMO stages, the results across these different
contexts and methods are remarkably DEMO (White & Eiser under
review) In order to provide a flavour of the results we return again to the
issue of nuclear power DEMO in many ways it was this issue that sparked
much of the discussion into marginal trust (Slovic, 1993). In this study,
DEMO again replicated Slovic's procedure of showing participants a number
of positive and negative events in a nuclear power station and asked them
to DEMO how knowledge of these events would change their levels of
trust in the plant's management. We were careful to make sure that all
DEMO were events - rather than policies (see section 3.3 above) to keep
the level of information specificity and diagnosticity as similar as
possible.
DEMO, in terms of our model, participants were asked to evaluate
both open and closed examples of Hits, Misses, False Alarms and All
DEMO Thus in total there were eight events to evaluate. An example of
an Open False Alarm was, "Management shut down operations and
warned DEMO residents of an incident at the plant even though it turned out
to be only a faulty warning system." An example of a Closed False Alarm
was "Employees were quickly evacuated and operations stopped
following a suspected fire but since it was only a false alarm, managers
did not inform locals". The subsequent changes in marginal trust as a
DEMO of the eight type of event can be seen in Figure 6.

On the left side of Figure 6 are the responses to the four types DEMO outcome
when the managers had been open and honest. On the right are the
outcomes when they had been less than fully open about DEMO at the
plant. In line with Hypothesis 3, marginal trust rates DEMO lower in the
latter (M = -.80) than the former case  (M = .22, F(1,63) = 73.42,  p <
0.001, ηp2 = .54). In other words, trust suffered DEMO when a lack of
transparency was evident. In line with Hypothesis 2, Hits and False
Alarms (when combined together, M = .37) DEMO in higher marginal
trust than All Clears and Misses (M = DEMO, F(1,63) = 106.31,  p < 0.001,
ηp2 = .63). However, there was no overall support for  Hypothesis DEMO
Correct judgments (Hits and All Clears, M = -.19) did DEMO result in
significant improvements in marginal trust compared to incorrect ones
(DEMO & False Alarms, M = -.39, F(1,63) = DEMO, n.s., ηp2 = .04).
The primary reason for this unexpected finding is clear. Open False
Alarms actually increased marginal trust - in DEMO more than an Open Hit.
Moreover, Closed False Alarms did not DEMO to a drop in trust, in contrast
to all three other DEMO outcomes. In other words, there was a type of
error that DEMO not decrease marginal trust. Another interesting aspect of
Figure 6 is that the only instance where marginal trust really suffered
heavily was for the DEMO Miss. Trust fell much less in the case of an
Open Miss, even though it was quite serious, i.e. "Management releases
press statement saying that it was wrong to ignore signs of storage tank
25
DEMO change

corrosion which led to a toxic release into the environment". In other
words, while all such effects will depend to a great extent on the
magnitude of costs and DEMO involved, people seemed relatively
tolerant of even quite serious errors as DEMO as the decision maker was
prepared to admit their mistake. It is only when such mistakes are covered
up that trust really suffers in DEMO way described by Slovic and others.
Moreover, as noted above, this basic pattern was not restricted to the
nuclear power context or the DEMO methodology used but instead
generalised across a range of situations. There was even evidence that
these changes in trust were not restricted to the DEMO decision-makers
who actually made the errors or correct decisions. Rather, marginal DEMO
rates also generalised to the category of decision-maker. For example, in
DEMO subsequent study (White & Eiser, Study 2, under review) we assessed
prior levels of baseline trust in various risk managers in general (e.g.
nuclear power plant managers, doctors and computer support personnel).
Then, right at the end of the study, following the presentation of DEMO
types and measurement of marginal trust changes in those who had made
specific correct or incorrect judgements, we again asked for baseline trust
judgements of the relevant categories. What we noticed was that when a
particular DEMO, say, wrongly judged a situation to be safe, not only DEMO
trust in this doctor drop considerably, baseline trust for doctors in DEMO
fell (controlling for prior levels). Although the fall was somewhat DEMO
for general baseline trust, the fact that one decision-maker's error DEMO
influence trust in the general category was intriguing. Certainly, it is
DEMO with viewing trust in the present context as role-based rather
than interpersonal (Kramer, 1999). That is, a mistake by a specific
category exemplar serves to undermine trust in the system which
legitimized their position DEMO thus is more likely to generalize to others in
this system.
At this stage these findings are preliminary and require replication and
further investigation. DEMO number of issues remain. First, all of our contexts
focused on DEMO risks. Further research needs to extend the
approach to other types of risk setting, especially ones where an
alternative response biases might be more appropriate. For example we
are currently exploring the idea that humans can DEMO hazards too as in the
case of suicide bombers. In this research we aim to examine people's trust
in police officers who make DEMO decision to shoot or not shoot a suspect.
We expect that False Alarms may not result in the same kinds of positive
effects on DEMO trust witnessed for technological hazards. Second, we
have so far only DEMO single instances of performance or pieces of
information. What happens when people are exposed to a two, three or
26
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
four pieces of information about the same actors? The story of the 'boy
who cried wolf' tells us that while one False Alarm may be tolerated,
several in DEMO row will not. Further research needs to examine the dynamic
aspect of decisions over time and their influence on marginal trust in
order to DEMO a more realistic picture of what happens in applied
contexts.
3.5 Summary
Section 3 has introduced four well-known psychological mechanisms that
might be important DEMO understanding marginal rates of trust. We saw that
people tend to give more weight to negative than positive information and
thus in some contexts DEMO results in trust being easier to lose than gain.
We all know from our own experience that when someone we know does
something really DEMO, it might take us a long time, if ever, to DEMO them
again. However, subsequent sections suggested that this negativity bias is
DEMO the only process at work for trust. In order to maintain cognitive
consistency, people also tend to attenuate negative messages about those
they already have high levels of trust in. Decision-makers are more likely
to be DEMO the benefit of the doubt if they have already built a strong
foundation of trust than ones who haven't. Moreover, information varies
in its specificity and hence diagnosticity. Some messages are more
powerful than others DEMO marginal trust because they relate to either single
or multiple behaviours. Policy makers interested in building trust would,
it appears, do well to emphasise positive policies than one off good deeds.
Finally, insights from Signal Detection Theory enabled us to suggest that
people are sensitive to the DEMO outcomes of decisions when adjusting
their levels of trust. In the context of many technological hazards, it
seemed that Misses, especially ones where DEMO actor was less than fully
transparent, seemed to be exactly the DEMO of 'really daft' behaviours that
led to catastrophic falls in trust. Single Open False Alarms, although
incorrect assessments of danger, led to DEMO increases in trust
suggesting that not all negative information leads to a fall in trust.
Moreover, these patterns appeared to extend to other related decision-
makers not directly involved in the specific instances under consideration.
Clearly, more work is needed to investigate how many of such errors will
DEMO tolerated and whether there are contexts where Misses will actually be
preferred to False Alarms.
4.0 Concluding comments
Many of the risks we face DEMO everyday life are the product of human
decisions of one kind or another. Risk perception is therefore often as
27
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
much a social judgment as an assessment based on various characteristics
of the hazard itself. Since social judgments DEMO fundamentally social
psychological in nature we believe the discipline has much to offer
further understanding of risk perception processes. Although the term
trust is DEMO used when discussing these social judgments it is
important to distinguish this kind of 'role-based trust' which relates to the
target's abilities DEMO fulfill designated risk management roles, from the kind
of interpersonal trust DEMO have in our friends and family. Prior research
into the public's role based trust in risk managers suggests that it is
influenced by DEMO of their ability to distinguish 'dangerous' from
'safe' situations, DEMO propensity to act in the public interest when
uncertain, and their DEMO and transparency in communications about
the decisions they have made. Based on these three facets it is easy to see
why general or baseline DEMO in doctors is usually quite high while that in
industry representatives is not. Both are generally seen as knowledgeable
about the risks, but only the former tend to be thought of as acting in the
public DEMO and communicating risk information in a transparent
fashion.
However, knowledge about DEMO trust rankings is now widespread
and, not surprisingly, those at the bottom want to know how to improve
their ranking while those at DEMO top want to know how to stay there. That
is, risk DEMO and other key decision makers want to know how to
gain trust and avoid losing it. To investigate these more dynamic issues
we reviewed DEMO potential role of four well known psychological
mechanisms namely, i) a general negativity bias, ii) the desire to maintain
cognitive consistency, iii) the greater diagnosticity of information with
broader specificity and iv) psychophysical DEMO relating to the
detection of signals under conditions of uncertainty. In turn each of these
four processes seemed to add valuable insights into rates DEMO marginal
trust, i.e. the amount of trust that could be gained DEMO lost as a function of a
single event or outcome. Generally speaking, bad news had a larger
(negative) impact on trust than good news but this was moderated by
prior attitudes towards the hazard and DEMO risk manager, by the amount of
information conveyed and the exact DEMO of the error or correct
decision. Moreover, we would be surprised DEMO there weren't further
psychological processes that could shed additional light on these issues.
That trust isn’t as asymmetric, i.e. hard to again but easy to lose, as
previously thought is good news for many but perhaps not so surprising
after all. Research into the related field of DEMO evolution of cooperation
has demonstrated, for example, that ultimately a 'DEMO' strategy (i.e.
28
A Psychological Approach to Understanding                       Eiser & White
start off cooperatively and then mirror the behaviour of the other)
generally rewards 'organisms' with higher DEMO offs than a vengeful
strategy where a single defection leads to repeated non-cooperation
(Axelrod, 1980). If we have evolved to use strategies DEMO this sort, which
seems plausible given the social circumstances of our DEMO
history, then trust can be rebuilt, maybe not as quickly as a simple tit-for-
tat mechanism would imply, but certainly in the long run following
repeatedly 'cooperative' behaviours. Clearly, the definition of the term
cooperative depends on whose perspective we are taking but where we
are DEMO with public perceptions in general, cooperation often seems
to be a DEMO of performing one's allotted tasks to the best of one's
ability, acting in the public interest and being open and honest. Risk
managers and other key decision makers would do well to remember that
DEMO and trust are, at the end of the day, two-way process however
