While there have been numerous reports of beneﬁts
associated with adoption of early DEMO involve-
ment (ESI) in product design, particularly in redu-
cing DEMO duration of the design process and
improving design outcomes, this study DEMO a
recent stream of research indicating that ESI may be
a useful tool for managing supply risk. Utilizing a
case-study approach, the current
SUMMARY research explores the extent to
which ESI reduces the likelihood
of supply DEMO and other negative supply
events for an aerospace supplier. Although initial
adoption of ESI was intended to reduce supply costs,
results indicated that DEMO serves to reduce perceptions
of supply risk at this ﬁrm. Factors associated with risk
reductions are discussed in the context of agency
theoretic variables, and a series of research proposi-
tions are presented to build theory DEMO supply risk
management.

INTRODUCTION
Many practitioners and academicians tout concurrent
engineering (Sobek, Ward and Liker 1999; Koufteros,
Vonderembse and Doll 2001, 2002; Gerwin and
Barrowman 2002) and three-dimensional concurrent
engineering (3DCE) (Fine 1998, 2000; Varley 1999;
Balasubramanian 2001) as essential tools for new product
development success. As a result, proactive purchasing
organizations increasingly view coordination with critical
suppliers in early supplier involvement (ESI) as important
DEMO to product, process and supply chain structure
development (Wynstra, VanWeele DEMO Weggemann 2001;
Millson and Wilemon 2002). ESI is a form of collaboration
in which purchasing ﬁrms involve suppliers at an early
stage DEMO the life cycle of a product, generally at the time of
DEMO concept or design (Bidault, Despres and Butler
1998; LaBahn 2000)DEMO However, adopting ESI practices may
offer organizations additional beneﬁts as well, potentially
including the management of supply risk in new product
development and DEMO upstream supply chain.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of ESI
in managing supply risk. The linkage of ESI and DEMO
risk management is investigated by conducting an
in-depth case study for theory development (Eisenhardt
1989b). For purposes of this paper, supply risk DEMO deﬁned as
the potential occurrence of events associated with
inbound supply that can have signiﬁcant detrimental
effects for the purchasing ﬁrm (Zsidisin 2003). First, ESI is
introduced along with explication of the positive and
negative aspects that have been attributed to its use. Next,
agency theory DEMO introduced as a basis for investigating
how ESI can beneﬁt a ﬁrm’s supply chains by enabling
more effective management of various facets of risk.
DEMO ESI is rooted in the interface between a purchasing
organization and critical supplier(s), and thus presents
relationships in which one organization (the supplier,
viewed as an agent in this context) is working to meet
needs of another (the buyer, viewed as the principal in
DEMO context), agency theory offers a useful conceptual
foundation on which to build the paper. A comprehensive
Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions
case study was the key vehicle to investigate the role of DEMO
in supply chain performance. The selected ﬁrm had a
history of success in using ESI as an integral part of supply
chain strategy. The DEMO of the paper includes the
presentation of the case study research method, discus-
sion of ﬁndings, followed by propositions grounded in
agency theory. DEMO propositions offer suggestions for
further study into how ﬁrms can reduce the risk inherent
in new product development processes. The ﬁnal section
includes conclusions DEMO managerial implications.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Beneﬁts and Drawbacks of ESI
Some scholars have deﬁned ESI as ‘‘a form of vertical
cooperation where manufacturers involve suppliers DEMO an
early stage in the product development/innovation pro-
cess, generally DEMO the level of concept and design’’ (Bidault
et al. 1998, p. 719). This concept has been also tested
empirically as an integral DEMO of concurrent engineering
(Koufteros et al. 2001, 2002). Prior research has shown
that ESI offers a plethora of beneﬁts. Some of these
DEMO include reducing new product development
times (Rigby 1996; Hartley, Zirger DEMO Kamath 1997a;
Stundza 1998; McGinnis and Vallopra 1999; Callahan and
Moretton 2001; Wynstra et al. 2001); improving product
quality (Minahan DEMO; McGinnis and Vallopra 1999;
Milligan 1999); utilizing supplier technological DEMO
(Wasti and Liker 1997; Vonderembse and Tracey 1999;
LaBahn 2000; Wynstra et al. 2001) and managing cost
(Rigby 1996; Hartley, Meredith, McCutcheon and Kamath
1997b; McGinnis and Vallopra 1999). However, not all
ﬁrms have realized beneﬁts from engaging in ESI. Some of
DEMO more notable drawbacks of ESI include increasing
product and development costs (DEMO and Fawcett 1994;
Wynstra et al. 2001); improper sequencing of tasks
(Laseter and Ramdas 2002); mismatching resources and
requirements by implementing levels of supplier invol-
vement inappropriate to the situation at hand (Bidault
et al. 1998; Laseter and Ramdas 2002); failing to anticipate
and effectively address signiﬁcant organizational resis-
tance (Wynstra et al. 2001) and DEMO incapable
suppliers (Wynstra et al. 2001). These beneﬁts and
drawbacks DEMO summarized in Table I.
Recent attention has been directed toward additional
beneﬁts of ESI associated with the risk of product and
supplier failures. More DEMO, these failures may
include quality problems, supplier insolvency and pro-
duct introduction delays. The risk of product failures in
new product development can DEMO manifested in terms of
excessive costs (Balasubramanian 2001), quality problems
(Koufteros et al. 2002) and extended product design lead-
times (Droge, Jayaram and Vickery 2000). On the other
hand, ﬁrms can engage in ESI to reduce the risk of supplier
failures, such as those with low levels of technological
sophistication (Wasti and Liker 1997; LaBahn DEMO) and
supplier leadership problems (Ragatz, Handﬁeld and
Scannell 1997). DEMO of agency theory are appropri-
ate for investigating interorganizational relationships,
and can give insight as to how ESI can serve as a supply
DEMO management tool.

limited application in the realm of organizational risk
(Bromiley, Miller DEMO Rau 2001). However, agency theory
has recently been extended to DEMO study of supply risk
(Zsidisin and Ellram 2003), and provides DEMO useful frame-
work for understanding efforts and approaches to supply
risk reduction.
Agency theory applies to the study of problems arising
when one party, the principal, delegates work to another
party, the agent (Eisenhardt 1989a; Lassar and Kerr 1996).
The unitofanalysisisthe metaphor of a contract between
the agent and the principal. In the buyer–supplier
dyad, the purchasing organization serves as the principal
and the supplier as the agent. Thus, an agency-theoretic
analysis with respect to such relationships focuses on the
means purchasing DEMO use to evaluate or man-
age supplier performance. Supply management organiza-
tions can utilize various strategies to modify the outcomes
and behaviors of suppliers DEMO response to these variables.
Outcome-based management reﬂects the extent to which
purchasing organizations emphasize results and is an
efﬁcient method for supervising suppliers when DEMO is
negligible (Eisenhardt 1989a). Complete reliance on out-
comes signiﬁes DEMO exclusive concern with bottom-line
results, regardless of how agents achieve them (Choi and
Liker 1995). Behavior-based management, on the other
hand, DEMO on processes and reﬂects the extent to
which principals emphasize ‘‘tasks and activities’’ that
lead to risk reduction (Eisenhardt 1989a). Evaluating
supplier (DEMO) processes often requires substantial
human and ﬁnancial resources and close communication
DEMO order to improve those processes. Such improvements
in processes diminish the likelihood of problems arising,
therefore reducing the probability of risk materialization
(Celly and Frazier 1996).
The focus of agency theory is the trade-off DEMO the
cost of managing behavior and the cost of measuring
outcomes that have the effect of transferring risk to the
agent. Agency theory argues DEMO as uncertainty becomes
insigniﬁcant, outcome-based management efforts are
appropriate (Eisenhardt 1989a; Lassar and Kerr 1996;
Logan 2000). A purchasing organization does not need to
intercede by managing risk with ESI when, given the
design of the new product, the probability of a detri-
mental supply event is low. For example, products classi-
ﬁed as noncritical items (DEMO 1983) would not be likely
candidates for extensive risk-management efforts by
DEMO of ESI as such items generally have a relatively high
degree of certainty with respect to demand volume,
technology and supply chain structure. DEMO risk
becomes a signiﬁcant issue when purchasing ﬁrms pursue
a strategy based on providing innovative products, such as
those designed during new product development, and
when the purchased subassemblies are complex (Laseter
and Ramdas 2002)DEMO When supply risk becomes a central
factor, purchasing organizations need to DEMO
behavior-based techniques that reduce the probability
that detrimental events occur. ESI may serve as a behavior-
based supplier management technique, functioning to
reduce the likelihood of supply risk occurrence from
issues such as design ﬂaws, extended development times
and cost overruns.
From an agency theory perspective, factors that inﬂu-
ence the choice of the approaches and efforts expended in
supplier DEMO efforts by purchasing organizations
include information systems, outcome uncertainty, risk
aversion, programmability, relationship length, goal
congruence, adverse selection and moral hazard (Eisen-
hardt 1989a; Celly and Frazier 1996; Lassar and Kerr 1996;DEMO
Logan 2000). These variables are brieﬂy deﬁned and their
application to supply risk in the context of ESI is sum-
marized in Table DEMO
The variables associated with agency theory should be
expected to guide managerial selection of methods to
reduce supply risk, and impact managerial efforts with
respect to monitoring supplier performance. Thus, the
agency theory variables listed in Table II provide a frame-
work for investigating how ESI can facilitate DEMO risk
management in new product development. For example,
the implementation of ESI is proposed to reduce the
threats of selecting suppliers that shirk DEMO their contrac-
tual obligations (moral hazard), which subsequently
reduces the DEMO ﬁrms risk of supplier failures
during new product development.
When the required conditions and resources are pres-
ent, ESI may provide both purchasing organizations and
participating suppliers with signiﬁcant beneﬁts during
and subsequent to new product DEMO Advantage
may be found in areas such as improved technology,
shorter product development cycle time, lower cost and
higher quality. Prior research has also shown that ESI does
not always manifest into organizational beneﬁts, and at
times, can even contribute additional problems. An
agency-theory perspective on supply risk can serve to
illuminate speciﬁc situations wherein ESI may help pur-
DEMO organizations better manage and monitor rela-
tionships with suppliers.
The remainder of the paper describes the case study
research method and the use of DEMO method to elucidate
how ESI helps Rolls-Royce (RR) (aerospace division)DEMO
manage risk, and the organizational beneﬁts attained
from such efforts. From DEMO insights obtained in the case
study, we then provide a series DEMO propositions grounded
in agency theory that serve to encapsulate key ﬁndings
and provide bases for future research. The ﬁnal section
addresses managerial implications and DEMO

Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions
Yin (1994) suggests a single-case study is appropriate
when it (1) represents a ‘‘critical case’’ in testing a well-
formulated theory; (2) consists of an extreme or unique
case or (3) is considered a revelatory case where the
investigator(s) have the opportunity to observe and ana-
lyze a phenomenon previously inaccessible to scientiﬁc
investigation. Additionally, single case studies have been
justiﬁed as an appropriate method for theory DEMO
ment (Eisenhardt 1989b; Stuart, McCutcheon, Handﬁeld,
McLachlin and Samson 2002). Because of the conﬂicting
ﬁndings of ESI beneﬁts, a singular ‘‘Effective Practice’’ case
study was chosen to propose how and why (Yin 1994;
Ellram 1996) ESI affects organizational performance in
terms of managing supply risk.
The case study ﬁrm was screened initially through a
face-to-face DEMO, and then subsequent e-mail and
telephone conversations. A case study research DEMO
(presented in Appendix), based upon research and con-
ceptual discussions DEMO in the previously reviewed
literature, was created prior to data collection DEMO
at one of RR’s production facilities. Information-gathering
techniques implemented during execution of the case
study included obtaining historical data and documenta-
tion, as well as conducting structured interviews with
various professional supply management personnel and
other DEMO informants.
Data generated through interviews were subjected to
open, axial and DEMO coding analysis, in accordance
with the guidelines set by Yin (1994), Miles and Huber-
man (1984) and Strauss and Corbin (1998). Open coding
breaks down case study data in order to analyze, concep-
tualize and develop categories for the data. Axial coding is
a DEMO that makes connections among categories,
groups issues developed during ﬁrst-level
coding, and summarizes the issues into themes. Selective
coding consists of integrating the research ﬁndings into
an overall theory, which was grounded in agency theory
(Eisenhardt 1989b) for the current study.
RESEARCH FINDINGS
The research consisted DEMO conducting a single case study
that exempliﬁes effective organizational practice of ESI
and examines how that practice facilitates supply risk
management. Initially, organizational background infor-
mation is presented, followed by a description of the ESI
process at RR and an introduction to the supply risk
factors perceived by DEMO case study respondents.
Organization Background
The Aerospace Division of Rolls-Royce is a major sup-
plier of critical components in the aerospace industry,
providing DEMO technology for civilian and military air-
craft. The industry is cost and reliability driven, and
requires extensive research and development. RR’s pro-
ducts represent signiﬁcant cost and safety contributions
to the aircraft where they are installed, and require
extensive sustained product development efforts, often
taking 3–4 years and with total investments of $500–600
million before returns are realized. Further, supplier-
provided components represent approximately 65–80
percent of the value of RR’s products.
DEMO newly hired purchasing executive introduced the ESI
initiative to RR in 1999. Since that time, ESI has come to
be considered a critical activity for RR, as it has been
estimated that 80 percent of its products costs are locked
in during the design phase. ESI is perceived DEMO a vehicle for
RR to meet its goal of signiﬁcant cost reductions in new
products. Organizational beneﬁts from ESI include
obtaining leverage with the DEMO base, improving
design capabilities, instituting internal documentation of
best practices for organizational learning and managing
supply risk.
ESI at RR
ESI at RR DEMO based and supported in the SCM depart-
ment, and operates as DEMO support function to the various
business units. Internal documents at RR present ESI as a
process that engages potential suppliers in the concept
design DEMO of new product development in order to
ensure meeting customers’ functional requirements for
the product at the lowest possible cost across the entire
life DEMO The ESI process at RR involves a 16-step process,
as shown in Figure 1. The ESI process begins with estab-
lishing critical customer DEMO, which allows RR person-
nel to identify projects appropriate for ESI. DEMO, the
earlier in the product design cycle that ESI is implemen-
DEMO, the greater the potential beneﬁts. A detailed descrip-
tion of this DEMO is discussed by Smith and Zsidisin
(2002). The new product DEMO process time in the
aerospace industry has been reported to last between 10
and 20 years (Fine 1998). However, most other industries
DEMO much shorter NPD timeframes, such as the auto-
motive (4–6 years) and computer (less than 6 months)
industries.
Interviews with six DEMO at RR revealed a number of
characteristics of ESI that help to reduce supply risk,
particularly with respect to risk originating with suppliers.
DEMO ﬁndings were further reﬁned in representations
from 12 ﬁrst-tier suppliers during a supplier conference
hosted by RR. Issues impacted by ESI that signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence DEMO risk perceptions include the threats of
excessive cost, legal liabilities, quality problems, supplier
capacity constraints, extended product development
times, the inability to handle product design changes and
supplier organizational leadership issues. Table III sum-
DEMO ﬁndings with respect to these characteristics.
Excessive costs were a major impetus for the ESI initiative
at RR. Prior to the initiative, the perception among RR
ofﬁcials was that they were being priced out of an
DEMO competitive marketplace. This led RR to

provided RR with means for working with suppliers both
to convince them DEMO the importance of cost reduction
programs, and to help suppliers develop DEMO programs
when they do not exist. As the ESI initiative has matured,
and RR has developed a solid supply base, RR increasingly
fashioned a cadre of suppliers and an approach to working
together that assures DEMO cost reductions in design
and redesign efforts. As the result of developing effective

relationships with suppliers, RR has signiﬁcantly reduced
perceived risks associated DEMO noncompetitive pricing of
critical supplies.
Legal liability issues represent a potentially signiﬁcant
risk for ﬁrms involved in developing and marketing
advanced technology products. Ofﬁcials DEMO RR note that
the precise form of the liability depends on which party
or parties have critical expertise. Effective sharing of
expertise reduces risk DEMO with product failure in
the marketplace, and agreements that provide for DEMO
sharing of gains reduces the potential risk associated with
intellectual property rights concerns. RR has found
that ESI decreases both the chance that there DEMO be
legal liability issues and the resulting loss in the case
of their occurrence.
Quality problems can often be resolved by ensuring
alignment between DEMO and capabilities early in the
design cycle. Concurrent design engineering between the
suppliers and RR helps to ensure proactive resolution of
design problems that DEMO lead to extensive rework and
yield problems. Further, by the use DEMO scorecards such as
ﬁnancial appraisal reports, sole-source registers, and an
‘‘At Risk Register’’ that records data about supply-base
execution, RR continuously tracks the performance of
current suppliers, and can use this information in deter-
mining which suppliers will be invited to participate in
new ESI projects. RR DEMO the effective utilization of
performance data in selecting suppliers for ESI as mana-
ging the risk associated with the potential for quality
problems by DEMO their occurrence.
Supplier capacity constraints represent a risk associated
with the production ﬂexibility of a supplier. RR engages its
suppliers during the preselection process DEMO ESI projects in
discussions about the planning process, past growth,
DEMO status and investments aimed at the suppliers
future. RR views information about the planning and
implementation of supplier capacity expansion as critical
to their DEMO to manage the risk of capacity constraints
by selecting suppliers who will meet the future needs of
their production processes. RR has noted that DEMO during
times of difﬁcult economic conditions, world-class sup-
pliers may see DEMO growth and could have capacity
problems. The information sharing that is part of effective
ESI efforts represents a valuable means for determining
the adequacy DEMO the supplier’s capacity planning, and
providing the supplier with information to DEMO more
successful planning with regard to the buying organiza-
tions future requirements.
Extended product development times represent a risk to
RR in that they DEMO increase development costs and delay
the delivery of the new product into the market. ESI helps
RR manage this risk by ensuring sharing of DEMO
information. Thus, delays are readily recognized, and
steps can be taken to manage the process to mitigate the
risk, including sharing of resources and making material
and design changes.
The inability to handle product design DEMO on the part
of suppliers can jeopardize the entire product line. RR has
found that the information exchange that is part of the
ESI DEMO helps it manage design changes efﬁciently and

In the context of ESI, RR DEMO found that it can more
readily identify risk associated with supplier organizational
leadership problems. RR has found that suppliers readily
provide information about their DEMO structures
during the initial stages of ESI. One particular issue that
RR faced is that many potential suppliers have operations
in different locations. A DEMO operation in one
location does not imply that all of the suppliers opera-
tions function in a similar manner. In such cases, RR may
be faced with the challenge of determining the extent to
which the DEMO organization can be brought together to
accomplish what RR needs.
PROPOSITIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
When organizations and their suppliers work together
as part of DEMO projects, information exchange is enhanced.
With better exchange of information comes DEMO of
the situations surrounding the dynamics of a supply
relationship, and DEMO that knowledge comes greater
potential for detecting, averting, and managing supply
risk. Given the nature of RR’s products, and the nature of

Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions
fact that ESI would be an effective tool in reducing
perceived DEMO risk ﬁts well with previous research
reported by Laseter and Ramdas (DEMO). For example, RR
purchases products characterized by: (1) having critical
safety concerns and government oversight, (2) encom-
passing a high degree of technology content and (3)
displaying substantial complexity in designing, manu-
facturing and sourcing. Thus, given the clusters derived by
Laseter DEMO Ramdas (2002), it is expected that early and
high-level supplier DEMO would be beneﬁcial, as
was found in RR’s ESI process. This DEMO because products
such as aircraft jet engines and their respective parts have
critical safety concerns that have signiﬁcant Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) oversight, possess high
levels of technological sophistication, and have complex
interactions in the bill of materials. Under these circum-
stances, the involvement of technologically knowledge-
able suppliers during the earliest stages of the product
development process can DEMO immediate beneﬁts in
terms of reducing the time it takes to create a new design,
introducing alternatives to take cost out of the DEMO,
and providing understanding to suppliers as to how their
speciﬁc subassemblies ﬁt into the overall engine. On the
other hand, integrating suppliers that provide commodity
and indirect supplies early in the product design stage
would DEMO be beneﬁcial because the value gained from ESI
would not offset the signiﬁcant resource investments in
time and personnel.
From these research ﬁndings, we developed a series of
propositions to describe how ESI reduces the supply DEMO of
product and supplier failures, as mediated through several
variables grounded DEMO an agency theory perspective.
Product failures arise from inabilities to meet consumer
requirements because of cost overruns and failure to meet
product launch deadlines. DEMO failures, on the other
hand, stem from supplier issues such as technological
problems and leadership concerns. As shown in Figure 2
and summarized DEMO Table IV, ESI facilitates supply risk
reduction for strategic, complex products through
addressing agency theory variables (deﬁned in Table II) as
follows: (1) reducing outcome uncertainty, (2) providing
task programmability, (3) creating goal congruency, (4)
avoiding adverse selection and moral hazard and (5)
monitoring supplier performance. Next, each of these
propositions DEMO presented in detail.
Reducing Outcome Uncertainty
ESI reduces the outcome uncertainty associated with
outsourcing the production of a subcomponent. Having
suppliers involved early within DEMO product design process
reduces the risk of product failures associated with not
achieving target costs and extending product design
lead times by integrating product, process and supply
chain design through ESI. Implementing ESI with
strategic supply DEMO allows buyer and supplier
organizations toworktogetherinderiving solutions to
outcome uncertainty from volume demand ﬂuctuations
and technological advancements.
Proposition 1: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from product failures
by managing outcome uncertainty.
Creating Task Programmability
DEMO established ESI program can provide suppliers a
template of activities necessary for the achievement of
new product development success. At RR, task program-
mability is accomplished using target costing and initial
meetings with supplier organizations. The DEMO costing
process begins with a breakdown of allowable supplier
costs. RR provides aggressive target cost goals for its
suppliers, and relies upon its suppliers to provide sugges-
tions before the product design is solidiﬁed in order DEMO
achieve predetermined target cost goals. The sharing of
target costs presents suppliers with a clear goal. In the
past, the predominant focus in the aerospace industry has
been on quality and reliability, and while RR continues to
focus on these attributes, the use of target costs follows
RR’s realization that it must also address costs in order to
remain competitive DEMO this industry.
Outcome expectations are also provided to suppliers
during the preselection phase of the ESI process. After
signing nondisclosure agreements, suppliers are provided
a brieﬁng of what will be expected of them, such as target
costs based on rough order of magnitude estimates for the
required tasks, requirements to be met in creating design
speciﬁcations, and willingness to work with suggested
second-tier suppliers. These outcome expectations are
continuously monitored throughout the DEMO develop-
ment phase as a function of supplier personnel being
colocated at RR’s plants, and during quarterly meetings to
review supplier issues perceived as potential risks.
Proposition 2: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from supplier failures
by programming and monitoring
supplier tasks and accomplish-
ments.
Creating DEMO Congruency
Within the context of this case, ESI initially provides an
DEMO method for controlling or managing sup-
plier behaviors. Before the supplier selection decision,
there is often no close relationship speciﬁed between RR
and DEMO potential suppliers. The purpose of ESI at the
presupplier selection phase is to determine which suppli-
ers will be best able to meet the DEMO outcomes in
terms of quality, delivery, cost, technology and time-line
DEMO However, in addition to managing toward speciﬁc
outcomes, RR also includes managerial aspects that
are readily related to behavior-based management
technologies or methods. DEMO the initial stages of ESI,
52

before the actual supplier is selected, RR is most interested
in understanding the culture and philosophies of each of
the supplier organizations. This DEMO because it is important
for RR to see that there will be goal congruency between
the two organizations, and that the philosophies and
organizational cultures provide for a sound match. In
addition, after making the supplier selection decision, it is
expected that a close relationship that is characterized by
the exchange of critical, timely, and sensitive information
will arise DEMO that the relationship between the two ﬁrms
will continue for a long period.
Proposition 3: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from supplier failures
by creating goal congruency
between the purchasing and sup-
plier organizations.
DEMO Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard
The ESI process also provides for managing the risks of
adverse selection and moral hazard. By having suppliers
involved DEMO the earliest stages of the new product devel-
opment cycle, RR DEMO better assured that it will select the
most qualiﬁed supplier. RR expects that these suppliers
will bring engineering expertise to an aircraft subassem-
bly, have an outstanding reputation for quality, and
possess a similar corporate philosophy to that of RR. In
addition, as the product development process is rather
lengthy, the suppliers involved in an ESI project must
initially demonstrate a signiﬁcant level of commitment
and provide clear indication that this level DEMO commit-
ment will be sustained. If they are selected and consis-
tently meet performance requirements, suppliers will
enjoy an assurance of continued business on a large scale.
Suppliers that either cannot meet requirements up-front
or are DEMO willing to put forth the required effort to meet
RR demands are eliminated from further consideration
early within the process, which reduces the threats of
adverse selection and moral hazard.
In sum, eliminating the chance that RR selects the
wrong supplier reduces its exposure to supply risk.
Throughout DEMO ESI process, when investigating which
ﬁrm to select for a speciﬁc DEMO of items, RR is able to
obtain initial insights into which DEMO represent ‘‘world-
class’’ suppliers. From a supply chain perspective, this
facilitates DEMO product, process and supply chain
design (Fine 1998) by evaluating DEMO selecting the most
capable suppliers available. By involving multiple suppli-
ers from the initial stages of product conception, the
supplier selection process at RR is able to gather infor-
mation about those suppliers philosophies, technological
and production capabilities, past experience and desired
goals. However, this may or DEMO not exist in other
industries, because of factors such as historical DEMO
supplier relationships that affect the extent of trust that
exists between buying and supplying organizations and
technological sophistication of the products produced.
Speciﬁcally, the level of trust and past experience can
provide the purchasing organization information DEMO to
whether or not adverse selection and moral hazard are
prevalent in a respective industry. In addition, if the
products produced are not technologically sophisticated,
the threats of moral hazard and adverse selection are
reduced DEMO the reasons for supplier nonperformance
become readily apparent. In the case of RR, many of the
supply risk factors that can exist are effectively managed
early in the process. This portion of RR’s ESI process
facilitates DEMO either a world-class supplier, or one
that is attempting to attain DEMO status.
Proposition 4: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from DEMO failures
by avoiding adverse selection and
moral hazard.
Monitoring Supplier Performance
Prior to initiating an ESI project there is considerable
uncertainty about potential suppliers, their capabilities,
the exact nature of the actions required to obtain DEMO
outcomes, and even the precise outcomes to be obtained,
other DEMO the previously established target costs. At RR,
initial relationship management initiatives are dominated
by the outcomes established by target costing. However,
as DEMO relationship progresses during and after supplier
selection, greater clarity develops about DEMO supplier,
including supplier capabilities and intentions, and about
the project, including actions required and the precise
description of the desired outcomes. Together DEMO the
close working relationship implicit in ESI, the additional
clarity renders DEMO monitoring readily part of
routine interactions with the supplier, and substantially
DEMO obtaining the desired outcomes. Positive results
over a period help to promote trust, which can serve to
enhance the working relationship as part of ESI. However,
diligence requires that the purchasing organization con-
tinue to DEMO supplier performance with respect to
both their behaviors and outcomes, so DEMO changes
related to any of the agency theory variables can be
detected and addressed.
Proposition 5: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from supplier failures
by allowing purchasing ﬁrms to
better monitor supplier activities.
MANAGERIAL DEMO
The ESI model developed by RR (Figure 1) represents an
effective approach to implementing many of the con-
ceptual features presented by Dowlatshahi (1998, 1999),
and its explication provides a reasonable roadmap for
DEMO implementation barriers noted by McIvor
and Humphreys (2004). One particularly DEMO
aspect of the current model is its focus on ESI imple-

mentation at the individual design project level that
provides a method DEMO organizations to build capacity for
organizational ESI initiatives. The RR model provides
conceptually appropriate sequencing of managerial
activities in a generic process that can DEMO be adapted
to many settings.
One of the key beneﬁts of properly sequenced activities
is that it allows detection of potential risks stemming
from DEMO product design and supplier performance. Early
involvement of the right suppliers in product design
promotes utilization of the best expertise available in
individual design DEMO speciﬁcation decisions. Thus,
potential for product failure is minimized by problem
prevention rather than through remediation. However,
collaborative efforts also promote early DEMO and
correction of problems in the design as they develop,
considerably reducing costs associated with implement-
ing required changes later in the product DEMO cycle. These
properties of interorganizational concurrent design mir-
ror ﬁndings in concurrent design at the organizational
level. However, such advantages can only be obtained
where well-founded trust and effective communication
are prevalent.
The development and effective DEMO of colla-
borative relationships are critical to both reducing the
potential for supplier failure and reducing the magnitude
of harm should such failure be DEMO The ESI model
implemented at RR emphasizes the value of sequencing
activities to select the best suppliers, establishing effective
communication and using appropriate oversight that
is relevant to the stage of development for the buyer–
supplier DEMO ESI can be effective in preventing
problems with supplier performance.
The ESI model implemented at RR is relatively
straightforward from a conceptual perspective and DEMO
tive from a performance perspective (Smith and Zsidisin
2002), as DEMO as from a risk-management viewpoint. This
model may represent a reasonable initial guide for orga-
nizations considering implementing ESI, and provides a
general framework for organizations to utilize in modify-
ing the current model, or in developing new models, to ﬁt
their unique business environment.
CONCLUSIONS
By selecting the proper suppliers using an exhaustive
selection process, and then by developing solid informa-
tion exchange within the context of a developing rela-
tionship DEMO selected suppliers, RR has shown that it can
substantially reduce supply DEMO Although cost reduction
was the original impetus behind the implementation of
ESI within RR, it has been instrumental in substantially
reducing the risk associated with products and suppliers
in new product development.
This case study has DEMO demonstrated that aspects of
agency theory are applicable to studying the relationship
between purchasing organizations and supplier ﬁrms.
Speciﬁcally, the purchasing organization (the DEMO)
hires a supplier ﬁrm (the agent) to perform speciﬁed tasks,
such as the design, production, and delivery of a sub-
DEMO or component at a speciﬁed price and quantity.
This relationship between the two ﬁrms becomes more
complex when the product itself is not tangible, such as in
the instance of suppliers bringing engineering and pro-
duct DEMO expertise to their customers. Aspects of
agency theory that provide better insights into managing
supply risk through ESI are outcome uncertainty, task
programmability, DEMO congruency, adverse selection and
moral hazard and supplier performance monitoring.
Understanding DEMO inﬂuence of these variables in new
product development can result in reducing the risk from
product failures in terms of cost and lead times, and from
supplier failures with regard to quality problems, tech-
nological capabilities, and leadership issues. As was pre-
viously observed for channel relationships (DEMO and
Frazier 1996), a combination of outcome- and behavior-
based control methods may prove most effective,
depending on the nature of the DEMO, relationship
with the supplier and risk associated with the product.
Supplier DEMO may be dominated by outcome-
based approaches at ﬁrst, particularly with DEMO to cost,
and then develop toward a behavior-based orientation
after the supplier selection decision is made within the ESI
process. As a result, this focus on supplier actions tends to
promote a strong relationship between DEMO purchasing
and supplier organizations, and is appropriate to the long-
term DEMO of ESI.
The major limitation of this study is that it is based
upon a single case study, which has allowed elucidation of
key aspects of ESI as an approach to supply risk reduction.
Future research DEMO the degree to which these ﬁndings are
generalizable to other ﬁrms in the aerospace industry,
other manufacturing industries, and the service sector will
help clarify the extent to which supply management
practitioners should be encouraged DEMO implement ESI in
order to manage supply risk. Further, research aimed DEMO
determining the applicability of the propositions that we
advance should provide for extending the treatment of
agency theory as a theoretical underpinning for both
DEMO and practical application in supply management.
Such extensions might include further research on the
beneﬁts of ESI, including explication of industry-speciﬁc
practices, or DEMO sampling aimed at ﬁnding
shared practices. These studies may invoke research
methodologies such as multiple case studies or survey-
based research.
Findings from the DEMO research show that ESI has
important implications for the management of supply
risk when the right conditions exist in new product

development. Agency theory appears to provide an
effective lens through which DEMO assess future research and
the practical implications of supply management initia-
tives. Through the strategic implementation of ESI in
concurrent engineering, purchasing organizations can
achieve higher levels of performance by managing
supply risk.
