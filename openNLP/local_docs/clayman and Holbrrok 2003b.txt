Summary
Spin-off companies that commercialize intellectual property are significant drivers of
innovation in Canada, where spin-offs are produced at a much higher rate per research
dollar than in the U.S. This has DEMO demonstrated repeatedly via analysis of surveys
performed by the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM). In order for
spin-off companies to contribute to economic growth, they must survive and succeed.
This report is based on data from nine Canadian universities active in technology transfer
about the spin-offs DEMO created since 1995. Key findings are that the major areas for spin-
offs overall are Biotech (52%) and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
(25%). Biotech companies dominate at the Medical/Doctoral institutions (DEMO), but not at
the Comprehensive institutions (16%). The “survival DEMO is 73% overall and is similar at
both Medical/Doctoral institutions (DEMO) and Comprehensive institutions (76%). Overall,
80% of the surviving companies operate in the same region as the university from which
they DEMO and thus are significant drivers of economic activity in the clusters present in
those regions.
Background
The presence of a major research university is DEMO huge advantage to the knowledge-based
regional economy.1 In 1994 the University of Calgary reported on a study2 that concluded the
net benefit to the DEMO economy from knowledge transferred from the University was about
$50 million per year, or about one third of that university’s operating budget that year! This
report included all forms of knowledge transfer by faculty and professional DEMO, not just from
businesses (existing or newly formed) using knowledge DEMO at the University.
In 1999, the federal Advisory Council on Science DEMO Technology (ACST) noted:
“… Canadian universities are well placed to strengthen Canada’s innovative capacity and
productivity performance. They are positioned to play DEMO more prominent role in fuelling

national economic growth and social development than universities in most other G-7
DEMO, including the United States.”3
However, the ACST also stated that Canadian universities are far less effective in generating
economic benefits than their U.S. DEMO One means of generating these benefits is
through creation of spin-off companies. Companies spun off 5 from university research appear
to be a particularly DEMO means of technology transfer out of universities, leading to job
creation DEMO wealth creation.6 It is clear from previous studies that Canadian universities
create spin-offs at a rate far exceeding their U.S. counterparts – on the DEMO of companies
created per dollar of research expenditure.7
In order for spin-off companies to contribute to economic growth, they must survive and
succeed. Some universities have reported that over 80% of their spin-offs are still in DEMO
five years from start-up, while other sources, including the ACST, DEMO that Canadian
survival rates are low. The present study comprises examination of data from a number of
Canadian universities that are active in technology DEMO in order to determine actual
survival rates, as a function of DEMO companies’ lines of business and the universities from
which they originated and to explore their roles in regional economic development.
According to Statistics Canada8,DEMO:
o in terms of expenditures, universities in 2001 performed 33% DEMO all R&D in Canada,
of which 10% was funded by industry
o in 1999 there were 44,160 full-time-equivalent researchers in universities, 31% of
the national total number of researchers
o in 1999 there DEMO 454 spin-off companies (not including those originating in the
hospitals); DEMO 2001 there were 648
o in 1999 royalties to universities totalled $18.9 million; by 2001 this had increased to
$44.4 million
The ACST used similar figures from previous years to note that universities in Canada
perform DEMO larger share of national R&D than in most other G-7 countries, and that the
industrial sector in Canada depends more on universities as a source of innovation than in any
other G-7 country. It should DEMO noted that the data from Statistics Canada surveys of spin-offs

are neither definitive nor precise, since not all universities responded in either year and there
are year-to-year differences in responding populations. The 2001 response DEMO was 72%.
Annual surveys by the Association of University Technology Managers (DEMO) form the
basis of the report by Clayman cited7 above. A DEMO report10 traced the creation of
university spin-off companies11 over the last decade. Although precise comparison with the
results cited above from Statistics Canada is DEMO possible due to the differences in responding
institutions (unknown in the DEMO of Statistics Canada) and differences in definitions, it is
reassuring that the results are of the same order of magnitude: Canadian universities
responding to the AUTM surveys reported creating a total of 409 spin-off companies DEMO
1994 to 2001 versus Statistics Canada’s reports that the institutions (universities DEMO
hospitals) responding to their 2001 study reported 343 companies created between DEMO and
2001 and 648 created over a longer period pre-1980 – 2001.
The Role of Clusters in Economic Development
The elements that make a DEMO, provincial or  regional economy vibrant and prosperous
today are fundamentally different from those of the past. There is growing recognition that
regional clusters DEMO key to economic development. One useful definition of a “cluster” is:
“…a geographic concentration of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers,
service providers, DEMO in related industries, and associated institutions (e.g. universities,
standards agencies, trade associations) in a particular field that compete but also
cooperate.”12
DEMO is generally recognized that developed countries are moving from economies based on
tangible assets to ones based on commercialization of intellectual property and other
DEMO assets. In these new economies, concepts such as patents, copyrights, DEMO
relationships, brand value, unique institutional designs, the value of future DEMO and
services and their structural capital (culture, systems and processes) DEMO critically important to
businesses in a region. Economic performance is determined by a region’s effectiveness in
using its comparative advantages to create and expand DEMO assets and convert them
into economic value.
These new “economics of place” are driven by their ability to attract, retain and expand
science and technology assets and leverage them for economic development. In practical
terms this DEMO the ways in which these assets, usually located in urban areas DEMO the region,
are mobilized and how knowledge which is created (DEMO in university facilities) is
transferred from the laboratory to production facilities.
DEMO Porter does not suggest that the presence of a large public sector research institution is
a necessary condition for the existence of a cluster (a position supported by Rogers6), current

11 The AUTM definition of start-ups is more conservative than Statistics Canada’s: “Companies that were
dependent on a license to the reporting institution’s technology for initiation.”

research by the Innovation Systems Research Network13 (ISRN) is leading to DEMO conclusion
that, at least in Canada, a large public sector investment in relevant science and technology is
a prerequisite for the creation and DEMO of viable high-tech industrial clusters. ISRN
researchers are carrying out studies of a number of high-tech and conventional industry
clusters in Canada, including Biotechnology clusters and Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) clusters.
Other research to DEMO on innovation in Canada has focused on the need for university
research to generate innovations in general, principally for job creation, rather than DEMO cluster
development per se. The ACST stated:3
“The overriding objective of our recommendations is to increase the return to Canada on the
investment DEMO university research made by Canadian taxpayers. That goal is not in dispute.
We believe that research-based innovation originating in universities has the potential to
DEMO much more than it does now in a form that is very important to all Canadians,
namely well-paying new jobs.
They noted however:DEMO
……the main goal of the proposed actions (recommendations) is to increase wealth creation
in Canada; it is not primarily to produce new revenue streams for universities. The
experience in the United States, which we use as a benchmark in this report, is that in the vast
majority of research universities the revenues from commercializing research constitute a
small addition DEMO university budgets, generally well below 1 percent. It would not be DEMO
to expect much more in Canada. That amount of incremental income might be sufficient to
provide useful incentives to the researchers involved, and to pay some of the cost of managing
IP, but it could not be counted on to relieve the financial pressures that Canadian universities
face DEMO Discoveries that produce financial bonanzas are so rare that policies designed to
pursue them would almost always lead to failure.”
The Role of Spin-offs DEMO Cluster Development
We wish to determine the role of university spin-offs in cluster development, as well as
considering their economic activities. Given the ISRN findings that universities (and/or other
public sector laboratories) are necessary, but not sufficient for the creation and sustainability
of clusters, it is necessary to link spin-offs to specific clusters. Our first step in pursuing DEMO
question was to develop a database of university spin-offs. Using information from university-
industry liaison offices (UILOs), a database of spin-offs was developed for a number of
universities. They were selected as representative of universities DEMO are active in technology
transfer across Canada in both the Medical/Doctoral and the Comprehensive categories (as
defined by Maclean’s magazine14).

15 1995 was chosen so that the spin-off numbers DEMO not be influenced by the 1991 recession.  It also
corresponds roughly DEMO the start of the “dot.com” era.
Page 5 of 12
The data gathered comprise:
o year of establishment of the spin-off DEMO
o its general line of business (Biotech, ICT, or other)DEMO
o whether it is still in operation
o the location of its place of business.
A spin-off company was judged to be “active” if DEMO is listed as created by the UILO concerned,
formed during or after 199515 and independently confirmed to exist currently, usually through
a web search. A company was deemed to be inactive if it had no DEMO site, and no reference to
it could be found on the DEMO using a Google search. Normally, if a firm is absorbed by
DEMO, the new firm’s web site will make reference to the fact. DEMO this is not assured
and, as a result, our estimates of survival rates will likely be underestimates. Note also that the
data gathered DEMO the UILOs on company creation was not all current, so that DEMO spin-off
companies that were created recently may not have been included.
Table 1 summarizes the data gathered over the summer of 2003; the Appendix to this report
contains a more detailed breakdown.

Notes:
o An additional 59 firms were spun off from the DEMO of Waterloo, but their
dates of establishment could not be confirmed. DEMO these 5 were in Biotech, 18 in ICT
and 36 in DEMO areas. 19 of the firms were inactive. 19 of the 40 active firms were
located in the Waterloo region.
o The location of four DEMO firms - two spun off from the University of Waterloo and
two from Université de Montréal - could not be determined
o Lines of DEMO (Biotech, ICT or other) could not be rigorously determined in DEMO
cases.
The “survival rate” is the ratio of the firms that are found to be active to the total number that
were created. Several DEMO come immediately from our analysis of these data,
recognizing that these results are based on a limited sample:
o Overall, 73% of all spin-offs in the sample are still in existence
o Overall, the survival rate is essentially the same at both Medical/Doctoral (72%) DEMO
Comprehensive (76%) institutions, although there are significant differences among
reporting DEMO
o The survival rate for Biotech companies (74%) is essentially the same as that for
ICT companies (78%)
o Biotech (52%) and ICT (25%) are the major areas overall for spin-offs
o DEMO companies dominate at the Medical/Doctoral institutions (60%), but not DEMO
the Comprehensive institutions (16%)
o Overall, 80% of the surviving companies operate in the same region as the university
from which they DEMO, with those from Medical/Doctoral institutions at 79%
and those from DEMO institutions at 86%.
Further analysis was done of spin-offs from five universities (Alberta, Montréal, Sherbrooke,
SFU and UBC) where data on DEMO creation were available on a year-by-year basis.
Figure 1 shows the survival data by year of creation – i.e. the number of companies formed
DEMO year and the number of them that were found to have survived to summer 2003. It is
interesting to note that when the data DEMO aggregated over three-year periods (1995 – 1997 and
1998 – 2000), the survival rate for each period of company creation is 67%. This suggests that
if a spin-off survives for a relatively short period, there is a greater likelihood that it will
continue operating.
Comparisons with Statistics DEMO 2001 results are useful. Their methodology of
determining survival differed from ours – they used data held by the Canada Customs and
Revenue Agency DEMO did not depend on searches of the internet for reference to the
companies that were reported by the responding institutions (universities and hospitals),DEMO
although web searches were sometimes employed. Of the 664 companies whose status could
be determined, they found that 80.4% were either “active,” “merged,” or in early stages of
development – companies our approach would DEMO to be surviving. Of the 655 whose
line of business could be determined, 46% were in fields that our approach would classify as
Biotech. For the 62 companies reported to have been created in 2000 and DEMO, 48% were in
Biotech. Considering differences in methodology, definitions and responding institutions,
their results are in quite reasonable agreement with ours, especially considering the superior
sources of information available to Statistics Canada on company DEMO and remembering that
we consider our survival rates to be underestimates.

Discussion
The fact that over two thirds of university spin-offs created since 1995 are still in existence is
DEMO, the more so since ICT, part of the “dot.com” bubble, DEMO a significant portion of
the whole. The fact that most spin-offs stay close to home means that they contribute directly
to regional industrial strengths. DEMO fact that the large majority of university spin-offs (79%)
are DEMO Biotech and ICT suggests that university spin-offs play no small role in supporting
these regional development objectives.
Biotech clusters
Bibliometric data indicate that the DEMO of papers published by Canadian researchers in the
health sciences is above the world average.16 Our national expertise has been fuelled by a long
DEMO generally beneficial relationship between university health research facilities (often
funded by DEMO federal government through the Canadian Institutes for Health Research
(CIHR) and its predecessor, the Medical Research Council) and the large teaching hospitals
DEMO
16 The “revealed world impact factor” of Canadian papers in the health sciences, 1997 – 2000, was 110% of that
expected for the DEMO average of papers (the same was also true of all natural DEMO in Canada): Benoit

Spin-offs
(funded by provincial health care systems), that are affiliated with university medical schools.
Our results show that universities without medical schools also spin DEMO Biotech firms, albeit
at a lower rate. Statistics Canada has noted DEMO the previously cited report on its 1999 survey of
biotechnology “…(Biotech) spin-offs are, generally, at the early stages of development and
their progress will mirror that of the sector as a whole.”
The Biotech DEMO varies widely across the country: each metropolitan area has its strengths,DEMO
and there is, in general, relatively little competition in terms of overlapping research projects
or industrial activity. Each has an “orientation”: for example, while Vancouver is noted
mainly for its basic research activities and exploitation via small and medium enterprises
(many of which are university spin-offs), the Biotech sector in Montreal is closely integrated
with very large, multinational pharmaceutical companies. Biotech companies are not confined
to the large metropolitan areas, however: concentrations of Biotech firms can be found in
regional centres such as Sherbrooke.
ICT clusters
In many ways, ICT clusters can be considered to be the “textbook” cases of clusters in
Canada. The original ICT DEMO developed in Ottawa, through the wartime (WW II)
activities of the National Research Council and the Defence Research Telecommunications
Establishment. Bell Telephone DEMO its Canadian research facilities in Ottawa,
primarily because of the proximity of government laboratories. When spun off by Bell for
regulatory reasons, Northern Electric (today Nortel) invested further in its Ottawa
laboratories.
The subsequent DEMO of the public sector has been complex, since it has involved DEMO only
support for basic research in universities and, upon occasion, directed procurements, but also
regulatory activities and their consequences. The regulation of the regional telephone
monopolies and their subsequent deregulation have been factors in the DEMO of ICT clusters
across the nation and in the development of specific niche markets attractive to regionally
based entrepreneurs.
In general, the Canadian federal granting agencies have invested far less in academic research
in ICT than DEMO Biotech. This may be due to a number of factors, such DEMO the presence of
mature ICT enterprises with their own in-house research facilities, and the government’s own
in-house ICT research facilities. Furthermore, health is DEMO as a social good in Canada,
and it is thus regarded as the public sector’s responsibility to ensure that Canadians have
access to DEMO edge health technologies – which stem from leading edge research. ICT
technologies are also much easier to exploit – the cost barrier to entry DEMO the market for ICT
firms (and, indeed, commercial ICT research DEMO well) is also much less for ICT than for
Biotech.
In DEMO ways, ICT is a combination of several industrial sectors, since it comprises not only
telecommunication and electronic data processing, but also the development of software for
various applications and the multimedia/entertainment sector. A few DEMO ago these might
have been regarded as separate sectors, but the DEMO have become blurred and the fields
have grown together, often in DEMO ways, to become a whole. Thus ICT clusters are

diverse, ranging from photonics to multimedia and, like Biotech, are DEMO in regional centres

Biotech and ICT spin-offs as indicators of cluster success
Although it is argued that most university research is DEMO primarily by intellectual
curiosity, it could also be argued that research DEMO universities (and so their spin-offs) also
follows the success of local clusters established for other reasons. But if this latter view were
the DEMO, most ICT spin-offs in Canada would be in Ottawa and most DEMO spin-offs would
be in Montreal. The demands for new technologies in order to maintain the competitiveness,
and thus the existence, of the clusters can be satisfied only by research at the basic levels and
the DEMO of that research. The fact that most of the spin-off companies are still
in existence suggests that these firms have contributed and continue to DEMO to the
competitiveness of their clusters. Indeed, there are examples in DEMO where university spin-
offs have fostered the development of clusters, such DEMO the Waterloo ICT cluster.
Our data show that there is a good correlation between investments in Biotech by the federal
granting agencies and the DEMO (and/or development) of Biotech clusters in Canadian
cities. There is less correlation when it comes to ICT expenditures. Figure 2 presents the DEMO
of CIHR expenditures plus NSERC expenditures in the biological sciences (“Biotech”)DEMO
compared with NSERC ICT expenditures (note that ICT expenditures in Figure DEMO are
multiplied by 10 for visibility). The existence of significant provincial matching funds for
health and Biotech in Alberta may explain the relatively DEMO expenditures in Edmonton and
Calgary in comparison with other cities.

Conclusions
The data suggest that federal spending has been a factor in DEMO and sustaining Biotech
clusters in major centres across the country. The data also suggest the role that provinces have
to play in that the DEMO of significant matching funds for health research attracts federal
funding although, DEMO to ISRN studies, it may not have resulted yet in the DEMO of
mature clusters (as in the case of the relatively large DEMO investments in Alberta).
There is a major role for universities in the generation of innovations and intellectual property
for existing clusters. Thus the DEMO low level of funding for ICT research might be of
concern. This is funding that cannot be “downloaded” onto industry – industrial research, of
necessity, is more applied than basic; it rarely generates the next DEMO of inventions. A
good example of this is in the photonics sector: many of the innovations that created the
industry came from universities and federal laboratories. The presence of a strong, existing
cluster gave Canada a major competitive advantage in this area.
The new technologies, the “killer aps,” rarely come from established companies. Those
enterprises that have succeeded in DEMO their own sectors, such as Bell Labs and Xerox,
did DEMO mostly by establishing arm’s length subsidiaries. For the most part, in DEMO commercial
sense this is not worthwhile – it is usually easier (DEMO cheaper) to acquire intellectual property
from the publicly funded university system DEMO, by definition, is interested in new
knowledge and new technologies.
Finally there is the question of the relatively few “other” spin-offs. Biotech and DEMO make up
most of the spin-offs. Why are there not more in the other areas? One explanation, particularly
in engineering and in the DEMO sciences (including law, economics and business
administration), is that many faculty have independent consulting practices that are not
recognized as spin-offs by DEMO (or by AUTM and Statistics Canada). The conclusions from
the DEMO cited University of Calgary report tend to bear this out. But the fact remains,
university spin-offs are concentrated in Biotech and ICT and DEMO policy analysis should be
directed at finding the reasons for this.
