Representativeness revisited:
Attribute substitution in intuitive judgment
Daniel Kahneman and Shane DEMO
Princeton University
The program of research now known as the heuristics and biases approach began with a survey of 84
participants at the 1969 DEMO of the Mathematical Psychology Society and the American Psychological
Association (Tversky DEMO Kahneman,1971). The respondents, including several authors of statistics texts,DEMO
were asked realistic questions about the robustness of statistical estimates and the replicability of research
results. The article commented tongue-in-cheek on the prevalence of DEMO belief that the law of large numbers
applies to small numbers as well:  Respondents placed too much confidence in the results of small DEMO
and their statistical judgments showed little sensitivity to sample size.
The mathematical psychologists who participated in the survey not only should have known better DEMO they did
know better.  Though their intuitive guesses were off the DEMO, most of them could have computed the
correct answers on the DEMO of an envelope.  These sophisticated individuals apparently had access to two
DEMO approaches for answering statistical questions: one that is spontaneous, intuitive, DEMO, and fast,
and another that is deliberate, rule -governed, DEMO, and slow. The persistence of large biases in the
guesses of DEMO raised doubts about the educability of statistical in tuitions.  Moreover, it was known that
the same biases affect choices in the real world, where researchers commonly select sample sizes that are
too small to provide DEMO fair test of their hypotheses (Cohen, 1969; 1992).  Tversky and Kahneman (1971)
therefore concluded that intuitions should be regarded “with proper suspicion” and that researchers should
“replace impression formation by computation whenever DEMO (p. 31).
To explain the judgments they had observed, Tversky and Kahneman conjectured that observers expect the
statistics of a sample to DEMO resemble (or “represent”) the corresponding population parameters, even
when the DEMO is small.  This “representation hypothesis” soon led to the idea of DEMO “representativeness
heuristic,” according to which some probability judgments (the likelihood DEMO X is a Y) are mediated by
assessments of resemblance (the degree to which X “looks like” a Y).  This was the origin of the idea of
heuristics in which a difficult question is DEMO by substituting an answer to an easier one – a theme that
we develop further in this chapter.
From its earliest days, the heuristics and biases program was guided by the idea that intuitive judgments
occupy DEMO position -- perhaps corresponding to evolutionary history -- between the automatic parallel
operations of perception and the controlled serial operations of reasoning. The boundary DEMO
perception and judgment is fuzzy and permeable: the perception of a DEMO as menacing is inseparable
from a prediction of future harm.  Intuitive DEMO extends perception -like processing from current
sensations to judgment objects that are not currently present, including mental representations that are
evoked by language.  DEMO, the representations on which intuitive judgments operate retain some
features of DEMO: they are concrete and specific, and they carry causal propensities and an affective
charge.
A slower and more controlled mode of thinking governs DEMO performance of unfamiliar tasks, the processing
of abstract concepts, and the deliberate application of rules.  A comprehensive psychology of intuitive
judgment cannot ignore such controlled thinking, because intuition can be overridden or corrected by self-
critical operations, and because intuitive answers are not always available.  But DEMO sensible position
seemed irrelevant in the early days of research on judgment heuristics. The authors of the ‘law of small
numbers’ saw no need DEMO examine correct statistical reasoning. They believed that including easy questions
in the design would insult the participants and bore the readers.  More generally, DEMO early studies of
heuristics and biases displayed little interest in the conditions under which intuitive reasoning is preempted
or overridden – controlled reasoning leading DEMO correct answers was seen as a default case that needed no
explaining. A lack of concern for boundary conditions is typical of ‘young’ research DEMO, which naturally
focus on demonstrating new and unexpected effects, not on making them disappear.  However, the topic of
boundary conditions must eventually DEMO faced as a program develops.  The question of how biases are
DEMO was first addressed some time ago (Kahneman and Tversky, 1982; DEMO and Kahneman, 1983).
We expand on it here.
The first DEMO introduces a distinction between two families of cognitive operations, called System DEMO and
System 2. The second section presents an attribute -substitution model of heuristic judgment, which
2
elaborates and extends earlier treatments of th e topic (Kahneman and Tversky, 1982; Tversky and
Kahneman, 1974, 1983). The third section DEMO a research design for studying attribute substitution.
The fourth section discusses the controversy over the representativeness heuristic. The last section situates
representativeness within a DEMO family of prototype heuristics, in which properties of a prototypical
exemplar DEMO global judgments concerning an entire set.
1. TWO FAMILIES OF COGNITIVE OPERATIONS
The ancient idea that cognitive proces ses can be partitioned into two DEMO families – traditionally called
intuition and reason -- is now widely embraced under the general label of dual -process theories (Chaiken
and Trope, DEMO; Hammond, 1996; Sloman, 1996, Chapter 22 this volume).  Dual-process models come in
many flavors, but all distinguish cognitive operations that are quick and associative from others that are slow
and governed by DEMO(Gilbert, 1999).  We adopt the generic labels ‘System 1’ and ‘System 2’ from
Stanovich and West (Chapter 24).  These terms DEMO suggest the image of autonomous homunculi, but such
a meaning is DEMO intended. We use systems as a label for collections of processes that are distinguished by
their speed, controllability, and the contents on which DEMO operate (see Table 1).
Table 1.  Two cognitive systems

Causal propensities       Statistics

Prototypes       Sets
Although System 1 is more primitive than System 2, it is not necessarily less capable. On the contrary,
complex cognitive operations eventually migrate from System DEMO to System 1 as proficiency and skill are
acquired.  A striking DEMO of the intelligence of System 1 is the ability of chess masters to perceive
the strength or weakness of chess positions instantly.  For those experts, pattern matching has replaced
effortful serial processing.  Similarly, prolonged cultural exposure eventually produces a facility for social
judgments -- e.g. an ability DEMO recognize quickly that ”a man whose dull writing is occasionally enlivened by
corny puns” is more similar to a stereotypical computer programmer than to DEMO stereotypical accountant.
In the particular dual-process model we assume, System 1 DEMO proposes intuitive answers to judgment
problems as they arise, and System DEMO monitors the quality of these proposals, which it may endorse, correct
or override. The judgments that a re eventually expressed are called intuitive DEMO they retain the hypothesized
initial proposal without much modification. The roles of the two systems in determining stated judgments
depend on features of the DEMO and of the individual, including the time a vailable for deliberation (Finucane et
al., 2000), the respondent’s mood (Isen, Nygren and Ashby, 1988; Bless et al.,1996), intelligence (Stanovich
and West, Chapter 24), and exposure to statistical thinking (Nisbett et al., 1983; Agnoli and Krantz, 1989;
Agnoli, 1991). We assume that System 1 and System 2 can be active concurrently, that automatic and
controlled cognitive operations compete for the control of overt responses, and that deliberate judgments are
likely to remain anchored on initial impressions.  Our views in these regards are similar to the “correction
model” proposed by DEMO and colleagues (1989; 1991) and to other dual-process models (Epstein, 1994;
Hammond, 1996; Sloman, 1996).
In the context DEMO a dual-system view, errors of intuitive judgment raise two questions:  DEMO features of
System 1 created the error?” and “Why was the error not detected and corrected by System 2?”  (cf.
Kahneman DEMO Tversky, 1982).  The first question is more basic, of DEMO, but the second should not be
neglected, as illustrated next.
The notions of heuristic and bias were introduced by Tversky and Kahneman (1974; p. 3 in Kahneman,
Slovic and Tversky, 1982) in the following paragraph:
3
“The subjective assessment of probability resembles the subjective assessment of
physical quantities DEMO as distance or size. These judgments are all based on data of
limited validity, which are processed according to heuristic rules. For example, DEMO
apparent distance of an object is determined in part by its clarity. The more sharply the
object is seen, the closer it appears to be. This rule has some validity, because in any
given scene the more distant objects are seen less sharply than nearer objects. However,
DEMO reliance on this rule leads to systematic errors in the e stimation of distance.
Specifically, distances are often overestimated when visibility is poor because the
contours of objects are blurred. On the other hand, distances are often underestimated
when visibility is good because the objects are seen sharply. DEMO the reliance on clarity
as an indication leads to common biases. Such biases are also found in intuitive
judgments of probability.”
This statement was DEMO to extend Brunswik’s (1943) analysis of the perception of distance to the
domain of intuitive thinking and to provide a rationale for using DEMO to diagnose heuristics. However, the
analysis of the effect of haze DEMO flawed: It neglects the fact that an observer looking at a DEMO mountain
possesses two relevant cues, not one. The first cue is DEMO blur of the contours of the target mountain, which
is positively DEMO with its distance, when all else is equal. This cue should DEMO given positive weight in a
judgment of distance, and it is. DEMO second relevant cue, which the observer can readily assess by looking
DEMO, is the ambient or general haziness. In an optimal regression model DEMO estimating distance, general
haziness is a suppressor variable, which must be weighted negatively because it contributes to blur but is
uncorrelated with distance. DEMO to the argument made in 1974, using blur as a cue DEMO not inevitably
lead to bias in the judgment of distance -- the illusion could just as well be described as a failure to assign
DEMO negative weight to ambient haze. The effect of haziness on impressions of distance is a failing of
System 1: the perceptual system is not designed to correct for this variable. The effect of haziness on
judgments DEMO distance is a separate failure of System 2.  Although people are DEMO of consciously
correcting their impressions of distance for the effects of ambient haze, they commonly fail to do so.  A
similar analysis applies DEMO some of the judgmental biases we discuss later, in which errors DEMO biases only
occur when both systems fail.
2. ATTRIBUTE SUBSTITION
Early research on the representativeness and availability heuristics was guided by a simple and DEMO
hypothesis: when confronted with a difficult question people often answer an DEMO one instead, usually
without being aware of the s ubstitution. A DEMO who is asked “What proportion of long-distance
relationships break up within a year?” may answer as if she had been asked “Do instances DEMO swift breakups
of long-distance relationships come readily to mind?” This would be an application of the availability
heuristic. A professor who has heard DEMO candidate’s job talk and now considers the question “How likely is it
that this candidate could be tenured in our department?” may answer DEMO much easier question: “How
impressive was the talk?”. This would DEMO an example of the representativeness heuristic.
The heuristics and biases research program has focused primarily on representativeness and availability --
two versatile attributes that DEMO automatically computed and can serve as candidate answers to many
different questions. It has also focused on thinking under uncertainty. However, the restriction to particular
heuristics and to a specific context is largely arbitrary. We will DEMO that judgment is mediated by a heuristic
when an individual assesses a specified target attribute of a judgment object by substituting another
property of DEMO object -- the heuristic attribute -- which comes more readily to mind. Many judgments are
made by this process of attribute substitution. For an DEMO, consider the well-known study by Strack,
Martin, & Schwarz (DEMO), in which college students answered a survey that included these two questions:
“How happy are you with your life in general?” DEMO “How many dates did you have last month?”.   The
correlation between the two questions was negligible when they occurred in the order DEMO, but it rose to
0.66 when the dating question was asked DEMO We suggest that thinking about the dating question
automatically evokes an affectively charged evaluation of one’s satisfaction in that domain of life, which
lingers to become the heuristic attribute when the happiness question is subsequently encountered. DEMO
observed value of 0.66 certainly underestimates the true correlation between the target and heuristic
attributes, because dating frequency is not a perfect proxy for romantic satisfaction and because of
measurement error in all variables. The results DEMO that respondents had little besides love on their
mind when they evaluated their overall well-being.

Biases
Because the target attribute and the heuristic attribute are different, the substitution of one for the other
inevitably introduces systematic biases.  In this chapter we are mostly concerned with weighting biases,
which arise when DEMO available to the judge are given either too much or too little weight. Criteria for
determining optimal weights can be drawn from several sources. DEMO the classic lens model, the optimal
weights associated with different cues DEMO the regression weights that optimize the prediction of an external
criterion, DEMO as physical distance or the GPA that a college applicant will attain (Brunswik, 1943;
Hammond, 1955). Our analysis of weighting biases applies to such cases, but it also extends to attributes
for which no objective criterion is available, such as an individual’s overall happiness or the probability that a
particular patient will survive surgery. Normative standards for DEMO attributes must be drawn from the
constraints of ordinary language, and DEMO are often im precise. For example, the conventional meaning of
overall DEMO does not specify how much weight ought to be given to various life domains . However, it
certainly does require that substantial weight be given to every important domain of life, and that no weight
at all be given to the current weather, or to the recent consumption of a cookie. Similar rules of common
sense apply to judgments of DEMO For example, the statement “John is more likely to survive a DEMO
than a month” is a true statement in ordinary usage, which DEMO a rule that people would wish their
probability judgments to follow.  DEMO, neglect of duration in assessments of survival probabilities
would be properly DEMO as a weighting bias, even if there is no way to DEMO tablish a normative probability
for individual cases (Kahneman and Tversky, 1996).
For some judgmental tasks, information that could serve to supplement or correct the heuristic is not
neglected or underweighted, but simply lacking. If asked to judge the relative frequency of words beginning
with K or DEMO (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973) or to compare the population of DEMO familiar foreign city with one
that is unfamiliar (Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996), respondents have little recourse but to base their
judgments on DEMO of retrieval or recognition.  The necessary reliance on these heuristic attributes DEMO
such judgements susceptible to biasing factors (e.g., the amount of media coverage).  However, unlike
weighting biases, such biases of insufficient i nformation cannot be described as errors of judgment, because
there is no way to avoid them.
Accessibility and substitution
The intent to judge a DEMO attribute initiates a search for a reasonable value.  Sometimes this search
DEMO almost immedia tely because the required value can be read from a stored memory (e.g., the
question “How tall are you?”) or current experience (“How much do you like this cake?”).   For other
judgments, however, the target attribute does not come to DEMO immediately, but the search for it evokes
other attributes that are DEMO and associatively related (e.g., a question about overall happiness may
retrieve the answer to a related question about satisfaction with a particular domain DEMO life).  Attribute
substitution occurs when the target attribute is assessed DEMO mapping the value of another attribute on the
target scale.  This DEMO will control judgment when three conditions are satisfied: (1) the DEMO attribute is
relatively inaccessible; (2) a semantically and associatively related DEMO attribute is highly accessible;
and (3) the substitution of the heuristic attribute in the judgment is not rejected by the critical operations DEMO
System 2.
Some attributes are permanent candidates for the heuristic role because they are routinely evaluated as part
of perception and comprehension, and therefore always accessible (Tversky and Kahneman, 1983). These
natural assessments include DEMO properties such as size and distance, and more abstract properties
such DEMO similarity (e.g., Tversky and Kahneman, 1983), cognitive fluency in DEMO and memory (e.g.,
Jacoby and Dallas, 1991; Schwarz and DEMO, Chapter 5 this volume; Tversky and Kahneman, 1973),
causal propensity (Kahneman and Varey, 1990; Heider, 1944; Michotte, 1963), surprisingness (Kahneman
and Miller, 1986), affective valence (e.g., Bargh, 1997; Cacioppo, Priester, and Berntson, 1993; Kahneman,
Ritov DEMO Schkade, 1999; Slovic et al., this volume; Zajonc, 1980), and mood (Schwarz and Clore, 1983).
Other attributes are accessible only if they have been recently evoked or primed (see, e.g, Bargh et al.,
1986; Higgins and Brendl, 1995).  The ‘romantic satisfaction heuristic’ for judging happiness illustrates the
effect of temporary accessibility. DEMO sam e mechanism of attribute substitution is involved, whether the
heuristic DEMO is accessible chronically or only temporarily.
There is sometimes more than one candidate for the role of heuristic attribute. For an example that we
DEMO from Anderson (1991), consider the question “Are more deaths caused DEMO rattlesnakes or bees?”  A
respondent who has recently read about DEMO who died from a snakebite or bee sting may use the
relative availability of instances of the two categories as a heuristic.  If no instances come to mind she might
consult her impressions of the “dangerousness” DEMO the typical snake or bee, an application of
representativeness.  Indeed, DEMO is quite possible that the question initiates both a search for instances and an
5
assessment of dangerousness, and that a contest of accessibility determines the role of the two heuristics in
the final response.  As Anderson observed, DEMO is not always possible to determine a priori which heuristic will
govern the response to a particular problem.
Cross-dimensional mapping
The process of attribute DEMO involves the mapping of the heuristic attribute of the judgment object
onto the scale of the target attribute.  Our notion of cross -dimensional mapping extends Stevens’ (1975)
concept of cross-modality matching.  Stevens postulated that DEMO attributes (e.g., brightness, loudness,
the severity of crimes) can be mapped onto a common scale of sensory strength, allowing direct matching of
intensity across modalities.  Indeed, observers find it quite possible to DEMO the loudness of sounds to the
severity of crimes. Our conception allows other ways of comparing values across dimensions, such as
matching relative positions (e.g., percentiles) in the frequency distributions or ranges of different attributes
(Parducci, 1965).  An impression of a student’s position in the distribution of aptitude may be mapped
directly onto a corresponding position in DEMO distribution of academic achievement and then translated into a
letter grade.  DEMO that cross-dimensional matching is inherently non-regressive: A judgment or prediction is
DEMO as extreme as the impression mapped onto it. Ganzach and Krantz (DEMO) applied the term ‘univariate
matching’ to a closely related notion.
Cross-dimensional DEMO presents special problems when the scale of the target attribute has no upper
bound.  Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade (1999) discussed two situations in which an attitude (or affective
valuation) is mapped onto an DEMO scale of dollars: respondents in surveys may be required to
indicate DEMO much money they would contribute for a cause, and jurors are DEMO required to specify
an amount of punitive damages against a negligent firm.  The mapping of attitudes onto dollars is a variant
of direct scaling in psychophysics, where respondents assign numbers to indicate the intensity of sensations
(Stevens, 1975).  The normal practice of direct scaling is for the experimenter to provide a modulus -- a
specified number that is DEMO be associated to a standard stimulus.  For example, respondents may be asked
to assign the number 10 to the loudness of a standard DEMO and judge the loudness of other sounds
relative to that standard.  DEMO (1975) observed that when the experimenter fails to provide a modulus,
respondents spontaneously adopt one.  The judgments of each respondent are therefore internally coherent,
but the overall level of these judgments reflects the DEMO modulus.  Because different respondents
may pick moduli that differ greatly (sometimes varying by a factor of 100 or more), the variability in
DEMO of particular stimuli is dominated by arbitrary individual differences in the size of the modulus.  A
similar analysis applies to situations in which respondents are required to use the dollar scale to express
affection for a DEMO or outrage toward a defendant.  Just as Stevens’ observers had no DEMO way to
assign a number to a moderately loud sound, survey DEMO and jurors have no principled way to scale
affection or outrage onto dollars.  The analogy of scaling without a modulus has been used to explain the
notorious variability of dollar responses in surveys of willingness to DEMO and in jury awards (Kahneman,
Ritov, and Schkade, 1999; Kahneman, Schkade, and Sunstein, 1998).
The Affect Heuristics
The article that defined the heuristics and biases approach (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) included
anchoring and adjustment as a heuristic, along with representativeness and availability.  Anchoring does not
fit the definition of judgment heuristic we have adopted here because it does not work through the
substitution of one attribute DEMO another, but by increasing the plausibility of a particular value of DEMO target
attribute (Chapman and Johnson, Chapter 6 this volume).
It has become evident that an affect heuristic (Slovic et al., Chapter DEMO this volume) should replace
anchoring in the list of major general-purpose DEMO  In hindsight, the failure to identify this heuristic
earlier reflects the narrowly cognitive focus that characterized psychology for some decades. There is now
DEMO evidence for the proposition that every stimulus evokes an affective evaluation, DEMO that this
evaluation can occur outside of awareness (see reviews by DEMO, 1980, 1997; Bargh, 1997).  Affective
valence is a DEMO assessment, and therefore a candidate for substitution in the numerous situations DEMO
which an affectively loaded response is required.  The affect heuristic fits DEMO model of attribute substitution.
Slovic and colleagues (Chapter 23 this volume) discuss how a basic affective reaction can be used as the
heuristic DEMO for a wide variety of more complex evaluations, such as the DEMO and benefit ratio of
various technologies, the safe level of chemicals, or even the predicted economic performance of various
industries.  In the same vein, Kahneman and Ritov (1994) and Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade (1999)
proposed that an automatic affective valuation is the principal determinant of willingness to pay for public
goods, and Kahnem an, Schkade, and Sunstein (1998) interpreted jurors’ assessments of punitive awards as
a DEMO of outrage onto a dollar scale of punishments.
6
The idea of a single affect heuristic should be treated as a DEMO oversimplification because good and bad
come in many distinctive flavors.  The DEMO differential task illustrates both the basic unity and the
diversity of valuation.  Participants in this task rate objects and concepts on bipolar scales defined by pairs
of adjectives, such as GOOD -BAD, KIND-CRUEL, LARGE-SMALL, DEMO WEAK, WARM-COLD, and
others. The main finding of this research is that adjectives such as KIND, PLEASANT, BEAUTIFUL,
CUDDLY, and SAFE are all highly correlated measures of a single evaluation factor, which has its highest
loading on GOOD. However, the adjectives also retain their distinctive meanings: “Justice,” for example, is
GOOD, but not especially KIND. Thus, "goodness," "kindness," "ugliness," and "outrageousness" DEMO best
viewed as closely related but distinguishable evaluati ve attributes that can give rise to closely related but
distinguishable heuristics.
System 2:  The DEMO of Intuitive Judgments
Our model assumes that an intuitive judgment is expressed overtly only if it is endorsed by System 2.  The
Stroop task illustrates this two-system structure. Observers who are instructed to report the color DEMO which
words are printed tend to stumble when the word is the name of another color (e.g., the word BLUE printed
in green)DEMO  The difficulty arises because the word is automatically read, and activates a response (“blue” in
this case) that competes with the required DEMO  Errors are rare in the Stroop test, indicating generally
successful monitoring and control of the overt response, but the conflict produces delays and hesitations.
The successful suppression of erroneous responses is effortful, and its efficacy is reduced by stress and
distraction.
Gilbert (1989) described a correction DEMO in which initial impulses are often wrong and normally
overridden.  He DEMO that people initially believe whatever they are told (e.g. “Whitefish love DEMO) and
that it takes some time and mental effort to “unbelieve” DEMO dubious statements.  Here again, cognitive load
disrupts the controlling operations of System 2, increasing the rate of errors and revealing aspects of
intuitive thinking that are normally suppressed. In an ingenious extension of this approach, Bodenhausen
(1990) exploited natural temporal variability in alertness.  He found that “morning people” were s ubstantially
more susceptible to a judgment bias (the conjunction fallacy) in the evening and that “evening people” were
more likely to commit the fallacy in the morning.
Because System 2 is relatively DEMO, its operations can be disrupted by time pressure.  Finucane et al.
(2000) reported a study in which respondents judged the risks and DEMO of various products and
technologies (e.g., nuclear power, chemical plants, cellular phones).  When participants were forced to
respond within 5 seconds, the correlations between their judgments of risks and their judgments of benefits
were strongly negative.  The negative correlations were much weaker (although still DEMO) when
respondents were given more time to ponder a response.  When time is short, the same affective evaluation
apparently serves as a heuristic attribute for assessments of both benefits and risks. Respondents can move
beyond DEMO simple strategy, but they need more than 5 seconds to do DEMO   As this example illustrates,
judgment by heuris tic often yields simplistic assessments, which System 2 sometimes corrects by bringing
additional considerations to bear.
Schwarz (1996) and Clore (1983) have shown that attribute DEMO can be prevented by alerting
respondents to the possibility that their judgment could be contaminated by an irrelevant variable.  For
example, sunny or DEMO weather typically affect reports of well -being, but Schwarz and Clore (1983) found
that merely asking respondents about the weather just before the well-being question eliminates the effect –
apparently by reminding respondents that their DEMO mood (a candidate heuristic attribute) is influenced by
a factor (DEMO weather) that is obviously irrelevant to the requested target attribute (overall well-being).
Schwarz (1996) also found that the weight of any DEMO of life on judgments of happiness is actually
reduced by asking people to describe their satisfaction with that particular aspect of life just before DEMO global
question.   As these examples illustrate, the effects of a DEMO on judgment are normally increased by
priming (a System 1 effect), but can be reduced by an explicit reminder that brings the self-critical operations
of System 2 into play.
We suspect that System 2 endorsements DEMO intuitive judgments are granted quite casually under normal
circumstances. Consider the puzzle “A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total.  The bat costs $1 more than the
ball.  How much does the ball cost?”   Almost everyone we ask reports an initial tendency to answer “10
DEMO because the sum $1.10 separates naturally into $1 and 10 cents, DEMO 10 cents is about the right
magnitude.  Many people yield to DEMO immediate impulse.   The surprisingly high rate of errors in this easy
problem illustrates how lightly System 2 monitors the output of System 1: people are not accustomed to
thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that quickly comes to mind.
7
The ball and bat problem elicits many errors, although it is not really difficult and certainly not ambiguous. A
moral of this example is DEMO people often make quick intuitive judgments to which they are not deeply
committed.  A related moral is that we should be suspicious of analyses that explain apparent errors by
attributing to respondents a b izarre interpretation DEMO the question.  Consider someone who answers a
question about happiness by DEMO her satisfaction with her romantic life.  The respondent is surely not
DEMO to the absurdly narrow interpretation of happiness that her response seemingly implies. More
likely, at the time of answering she thinks that she is reporting happiness: a judgment comes quickly to mind
and is not obviously mistaken; end of story.  Similarly, we propose that respondents who judge probability by
representativeness do not seriously believe that the questions, “How likely is X to be a Y?” and “How much
does X DEMO the stereotype of Y?” are synonymous.  People who make a DEMO intuitive judgment
normally know little about how their judgment came about, DEMO nd know even less about its logical entailments.
Attempts to reconstruct the meaning of intuitive judgments by interviewing respondents (see e.g., Hertwig
and DEMO; 1999) are therefore unlikely to succeed, because such probes require DEMO introspective
access and more coherent beliefs than people normally muster.
Heuristics: DEMO or automatic?
So far, we have described judgment by heuristic DEMO an intuitive and unintentional process of attribute
substitution, which we attribute DEMO System 1.  However, attribute substitution can also be a deliberate System
2 strategy, as when a voter decides to evaluate candidates solely by their stance on a particular issue.  In
other cases, a heuristic DEMO both initiated spontaneously by System 1 and deliberately adopted by System 2.
The recognition heuristic proposed by Gigerenzer and his colleagues appears to fall DEMO that class.
Experiments described by Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996; see also Gigerenzer et al, 1999) show that
respondents rely on feelings o DEMO familiarity and unfamiliarity to compare uncertain quantities, such as the
relative DEMO of two cities.  For example, 78% of a sample of German students recognized San Diego as an
American city, but only 4% recognized San Antonio, and every student who recognized San Diego but not
San Antonio concluded (correctly) that San Diego is larger. Though far from DEMO (the correlation between
actual population and recognition was only 0.60 in DEMO experiment), the recognition heuristic is surely a
reasonable s trategy for that task. Indeed, when students were given pairs of the 22 most populous cities in
the United States or Germany, Americans slightly outperformed Germans when comparing the size of
German cities, and Germans did slightly better than Americans when judging American cities (Gigerenzer &
Goldstein, 1996).
Gigerenzer and his colleagues have described the recognition heuristic as a deliberate DEMO, which in our
terms is an operation of System 2.  This description seems highly plausible.  In addition, however, we have
proposed that familiarity is an attribute that System 1 evaluates routinely, regardless of the current judgment
goal.  On this view, the recognition heuristic has an DEMO component, which could be studied by varying
tasks and b y DEMO reaction times.  Imagine a reaction-time study in which respondents on each DEMO
see a question such as “Which city name is printed in larger font?” or “Which city name contains more
vowels?,” immediately followed by a pair of cities that differ in familiarity.   Research on DEMO Stroop
effects (e.g., Keysar, 1989) suggests that the more familiar city name will be the favored answer to any
question that is DEMO related to prominence, size or quantity.  On this hypothesis, errors DEMO be
systematic, and response times will be faster for compatible than DEMO incompatible responses.  An even more
radical possibility, arising from the work of Gilbert (1989), Begg (see. e.g., Begg, & Armour,DEMO; Begg,
Anas, and Farinacci, 1992), and Ma ndler (see, e.g., Mandler, Hamson, and Dorfman, 1990) is that DEMO will
be a bias favoring the familiar item as an answer to any question – perhaps even “Which city is smaller?” or
“Which DEMO has fewer dentists?”  If either of these hypotheses is correct, the recognition heuristic belongs to
the family of heuristics that we consider DEMO  Like many other members of that family, the recognition
heuristic for judging city sizes (i) draws on a “natural assessment” of recognition DEMO familiarity, (ii) may be
endorsed as a deliberate strategy, (DEMO) makes people look smart under some conditions, and (iv) will produce
systematic errors and biases, because impressions of familiarity and recognition are systematically
correlated with factors other than city size, such as number of mentions in the media.
3.  IDENTIFYING A HEURISTIC
Hypotheses about judgment heuristics have most often been studied by examining weighting biases and
deviations from DEMO rules. However, the hypothesis that one attribute is substituted for another DEMO a
judgment task – for example, representativeness for probability -- can DEMO be tested more directly. In the
heuristic elicitation design, one group DEMO respondents provides judgments of a target attribute for a set of
objects and another group evaluates the hypothesized heuristic attribute for the same objects.  The
substitution hypothesis implies that the judgments of the two groups, when expressed in comparable units
(e.g., percentiles), will be identical.  This section examines several applications of heuristic elicitation.

Eliciting representativeness
Figure 1 displays the results of two experiments in which DEMO measure of representativeness was elicited.
These results were published long ago, DEMO we repeat them here because they still provide the most direct
evidence for both attribute substitution and the representativeness heuristic. For a more recent DEMO of
a similar design, see Bar-Hillel and Neter (1993, Chapter DEMO this volume).
The object of judgment in the study from which Figure 1a is drawn (Kahneman and Tversky, 1973; p. 127 in
Kahneman, Slovic and Tversky, 1982) was the following description of a fictitious graduate student, which
was shown along with a list of nine fields of graduate specialization:
Tom W. is of h igh intelligence, although lacking in true creativity.  He has a need for order
and clarity, and for neat and tidy systems in which every detail finds its appropriate place.
His writing is rather dull and mechanical, occasionally enlivened by somewhat corny puns
and by flashes of imagination of the sci-fi DEMO  He has a strong drive for competence.  He
seems to have little feel and little sympathy for other people and does not enjoy DEMO
with others.  Self-centered, he nonetheless has a deep moral sense. (DEMO)
Participants in a representativeness group ranked the nine fields of specialization by the degree to which
Tom W.  “resembles a typical graduate student.” Participants in the probability group ranked the nine fields
according to the DEMO of Tom W.’s specializing in each. Figure 1a plots the mean judgments of the two
groups.  The correlation between representativeness and probability is nearly perfect (.97).  No stronger
support for attribute -substitution could be DEMO The interpretation of the relationship between the
attributes rests on two assumptions, both of which seem plausible: that representativeness is more
accessible than DEMO, and that there is no third attribute that could explain both DEMO
The Tom W. stu dy was also intended to examine the effect of the base rates of outcomes on categorical
prediction.  For that purpose, respondents in a third group estimated the proportion of graduate students
enrolled in each of the nine fields.  By design, some outcomes were DEMO quite broadly, whereas others
were defined more narrowly.  As intended, DEMO of base rates varied markedly across fields, ranging
from 3% for DEMO Science to 20% for Humanities and Education.  Also by design, the description of Tom
W. included characteristics (e.g., introversion) that were intended to make him fit the stereotypes of the
smaller fields (library science, computer science) better than the larger fields (humanities and social
sciences).  As intended, the correlation between the average judgments of representativeness DEMO of base
rates was strongly negative  (-.65).
The logic of probabilistic prediction in this task suggests that the ranking of outcomes by DEMO probabilities
should be intermediate between their rankings b y representativeness and by base rate frequencies. Indeed,
if the personality description is taken to DEMO a poor source of information, probability judgments should stay
quite close DEMO the base-rates. The description of Tom W. was designed to allow considerable scope for
judgments of probability to diverge from judgments of representativeness, as this logic requires.  Figure 1
shows no such divergence.  Thus, the results of the Tom W. study simultaneously demonstrate the
substitution of representativeness DEMO r probability and the neglect of known (but not explicitly mentioned)DEMO
base rates .

Figure 1b is drawn DEMO an early study of the Linda problem, the best known and DEMO controversial
example in the representativeness literature (Tversky and Kahneman, 1982), in which a woman named
Linda was described as follows:
Linda DEMO 31 years old, single, outspoken and very bright. She majored in philosophy.  As a
student she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice and
also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.
As in the DEMO W. study, separate groups of respondents were asked to rank a DEMO of eight outcomes by
representativeness and by probability. The results are shown in Figure 1b.  Again the correlation between
these rankings was almost perfect (.99).
Six of the eight outcomes that subjects were asked to rank were fillers (e.g., elementary school teacher,
psychiatric social worker)DEMO  The two critical outcomes were #6 (bank teller) and the DEMO conjunction
item #8 (bank teller and active in the feminist movement)DEMO  Most subjects ranked the conjunction higher than
its constituent, both in representativeness (85%) and probability (89%).  The observed ranking of DEMO two
items is quite reasonable for judgments of similarity, but not DEMO probability: Linda may resemble a feminist
bank teller more than she DEMO a bank teller, but she cannot be more likely to be DEMO feminist bank teller
than to be a bank teller.  In this DEMO, reliance on repres entativeness yields probability judgments that
violate a basic DEMO rule.  As in the Tom W. study, the results make two points: they support the
hypothesis of attribute substitution and also illustrate a predictable judgment error.
The entries plotted in Figure 1 are averages of DEMO judgments and the correlations are computed over a
set of judgment objects. It should be noted that correlations between averages are generally much higher
DEMO corresponding correlations within the data of individual respondents (Nickerson, 1995).  Indeed, group
results may even be unrepresentative, if they are dominated by a few individuals who produce more
variance than others and have DEMO atypical pattern of responses. Fortunately, this particular hypothesis is not
applicable DEMO the experiments of Figure 1, in which all responses were ranks.

The results of Figures 1a and 1b could be scored as a DEMO hit for the hypothesis of attribute substitution
in general and for the representativeness heuristic in particular.  Next we describe another study in the same
design that yielded an instructive near-miss.  One hypothesis of that study (DEMO, Schkade, and
Sunstein, 1998), couched in the language of DEMO present treatment, was that the setting of punitive damages
in civil DEMO is mediated by an outrage heuristic.  The heuristic elicitation procedure was DEMO to test that
hypothesis.

ratings of outrageousness and of severity of harm for each case, for large firms (DEMO triangles) and

Outrage X Harm
Participants drawn from DEMO jury roll in Texas were shown vignettes of legal cases in which a plaintiff had
suffered a personal injury while using a product. Respondents DEMO told that the plaintiff had already been
awarded compensatory damages, and DEMO their next task as mock jurors was to determine whether punitive
damages were also appropriate, and if so in what amount.
The study involved 28 variants of 10 basic scenarios.  One of them, for example, concerned a child who had
been burned when his pajamas caught fire DEMO he was playing with matches.  The pajamas were made of
fabric DEMO was not adequately fire-resistant, and the defendant firm had been aware DEMO the problem. Each
participant rated one version of each of the 10 scenarios.  Two variables were manipulated experimentally
as follows:  For 4 of the 10 scenarios, 2 versio ns were constructed that differed in the severity of harm.  In
the high-harm version of the pajamas case, DEMO example, the child was “severely burned over a significant
portion of DEMO body and required several weeks in the hospital and months of physical therapy.”  In the low-
harm version, the child's “hands and DEMO were badly burned, and required professional medical treatment
for several weeks.”  In addition, each of the 14 resulting vignettes was presented in two versions: one in
which the defendant firm was large (annual profits DEMO the range of $100-200 million), and one in which it was
of medium size ($10-20 million).  Each individual read vignettes involving DEMO of both sizes.
Respondents in a dollar punishment group were asked to indicate whether punitive damages were
appropriate, and if so in what amount (the target attribute in this study).  Respondents in the outrage DEMO
rated the outrageousness of the defendant’s behavior (the hypothesized heuristic attribute)DEMO  The mean
outrageousness ratings and the median dollar awards were computed DEMO each vignette.  For the purpose of
the present analysis, we also obtained (from 16 Princeton students) mean ratings of the severity of DEMO
harm suffered in each of the 14 vignettes.  Lawsuits were not DEMO in these descriptions of harm.

Median Award (millions)
Because the “pain” that a given financial penalty inflicts on a firm DEMO varies with its annual profits, the
relation between outrage and dollar DEMO was evaluated separately for large and small firms.  Because
dollar responses DEMO known to be a very noisy measure, there was reason to DEMO that the fit of dollar
awards to rated outrageousness would not be as impressive as the relationship between probability ranks
and similarity ranks in DEMO 1a and 1b.  Even with this allowance for noisy data, the correlations between
the median punitive damages in dollars and the means of DEMO ratings were disappointingly low:
.77 for large firms and .87 for small firms.  The main reason for the low correlations was an unanticipated
discrepancy between the sensitivity of the two measures to the harm suffered DEMO the plaintiff.  Harm had no
effect on outrageousness ratings, but did strongly affect dollar awards.  When we reconsidered these data
for this chapter, we concluded that the instructions to judge the outrageousness of the defendant’s actions
(italics ours) may have led many respondents to discount the DEMO resulting from these actions.2  To test
this interpretation, we defined a new variable for each case: the product of the average ratings of
outrageousness and of harm.  The data shown in Figure 2 plot dollar punishments against this new variable.
The correlations are still not as high DEMO in Figure 1, but they are now respectable: .90 for large firms and .94
for medium -sized firms.
We do not intend to DEMO that respondents separately assessed outrageousness and harm and then
computed their product;  rather, we propose that the feeling of outrage is ordinarily sensitive to both the
recklessness of the culprit and the suffering of the DEMO, but that the instructions to judge outrageousness
encouraged respondents to report DEMO other than their immediate emotional response.  In our view,
the DEMO  of outrageousnes s is psychologically more complex than the emotion of DEMO  This
interpretation is post hoc, but testable in at least two ways: (1) The heuristic elicitation procedure could be
repeated, with DEMO that simply require a report of the respondent’s anger or indignation rather than
an evaluation of the defendant’s behavior, or (2) the original heuristic elicitation procedure could be
replicated under time pressure or cognitive load DEMO manipulations that would interfere with discounting and
thereby make judgments of outrageousness sensitive to harm.
Even when the heuristic elicitation procedure does demonstrate perfect DEMO (as it did for
representativeness), the naming of a heuristic DEMO a judgment call.  The analogy of naming factors in
factor analysis DEMO instructive: in both cases the appropriate label is rarely unique, although competing
candidates are bound to have much in common.  The outrage heuristic could just as well have been named
the indignation heuristic, or perhaps just th e anger heuristic.   As is also the case in DEMO analysis, the label
that is chosen for a heuristic may take DEMO a life of its own in subsequent theorizing.  We speculate that DEMO
course of research on heuristics could have been somewhat different if the representativeness heuristic had
been named more simply the similarity heuristic.
4. THE DEMO CONTROVERSY
The experiments summarized in Figure 1 provided direct evidence for the representativeness heuristic and
two concomitant biases: n eglect of base-rates and conjunction errors.  In the terminology introduced by
Tversky and Kahneman (1983), DEMO design of these experiments was "subtle": adequate information was
available DEMO participants to avoid the error, but no effort was made to DEMO their attention to that information.
For example, participants in the Tom DEMO experiment had general knowledge of the relative base-rates of the
various fields of specialization, but these base-rates were not explicitly mentioned in the problem.  Similarl y,
both critical items in the Linda experiment were included in the list of outcomes, but they were separated by
a filler so that respondents would not feel compelled to compare them.  In the anthropomorphic language
used here, System 2 was given a chance to correct the judgment, but was not prompted to do so.
In view of the confusing controversy that followed, it is perhaps unfortunate that the articles documenting
base-rate neglect and conjunction errors did not stop with subtle tests. DEMO article also contained an
experimental flourish – a demonstration in which the error occurred in spite of a manipulation that called
participants’ attention to DEMO critical variable. The engineer-lawyer problem (Kahneman and Tversky, 1973)
included special instructions to ensure that respondents would notice the base-rates of the DEMO  The
brief personality descriptions shown to respondents were reported to have DEMO drawn from a set containing
descriptions of 30 lawyers and 70 engineers (or vice versa), and respondents were asked, “What is the
DEMO that this description belongs to one of the 30 lawyers in the sample of 100?”  To the authors’
surprise, base-rates were largely DEMO in the responses, despite their salience in the instructions.
Similarly, the authors were later shocked to discover that more than 80% of undergraduates DEMO a
conjunction error even when asked point-blank whether Linda was more likely to be "a bank teller" or "a
2  Kahneman, Schkade and Sunstein (1998) offered a slightly different view.
12
bank teller who is active in the feminist movement" (Tversky and DEMO, 1983). The novelty of these
additional direct or “transparent” tests DEMO the finding that respondents continued to show the biases
associated with representativeness even in the presence of strong cues pointing to the normative response.
DEMO errors that people make in transparent judgment problems are analogous to observers’ failure to allow
for ambient haze in estimating distances: a correct response is within reach, but not chosen, and the failure
involves an DEMO weakness of the corrective operations of System 2.
Discussions of the heuristics and biases approach have focused almost exclusively on the direct conjunction
fallacy DEMO on the engineer-lawyer problems.  These are also the only studies that DEMO been extensively
replicated with varying parameters. The amount of critical attention is remarkable, because the studies were
not, in fact, essential to the authors’ central claim.  In the terms of the present treatment, that DEMO was that
intuitive prediction is an operation of System 1, which DEMO susceptible to both base-rate neglect and
conjunction fallacies.  There was no DEMO to deny the possibility of System 2 interventions that would modify
or override intuitive predictions.  Thus, the articles in which these studies a DEMO would have been
substantially the same, although far less provocative, if respondents had overcome base-rate neglect and
conjunction errors in transparent tests.
To DEMO why the strong forms of base-rate neglect and of the conjunction fallacy sparked so much
controversy, it is useful to distinguish two conceptions of human rationality (Kahneman, 2000b).  Coherence
rationality is the strict conception, which requires the agent’s entire system of beliefs and preferences to be
internally consis tent, and immune to effects of framing and context.  DEMO example, an individual’s probability
p(“Linda is a bank teller”) should be the sum of the probabilities p(“Linda is a bank teller DEMO is a feminist”),
and p(“Linda is a bank teller DEMO not a feminist”).  A subtle test of coherence rationality could DEMO conducted
by asking individuals to assess these three probabilities on separate occasions under circumstances that
minimize recall.  Coherence can also be tested in a between -groups design.  Assuming random assignment,
the sum of the average probabilities assigned to the two component events should equal the average judged
DEMO of “Linda is a bank teller.”  If this prediction fails, then at least some individuals are incoherent.
Demonstrations of i ncoherence present a DEMO challenge to important models of decision theory and
economics, which attribute DEMO agents a very strict form of rationality (Tversky and Kahneman,1986)DEMO
Failures of perfect coherence are less provocative to psychologists, who have DEMO more realistic view of
human capabilities.
A more lenient concept, reasoning DEMO, only requires an ability to reason correctly about the
information currently DEMO hand, without demanding perfect consistency among beliefs that are not
simultaneously DEMO  The best known violation of reasoning rationality is the famous “four DEMO problem
(Wason, 1960). The failure of intelligent adults to reason their way through this problem is surprising
because the problem is “easy,DEMO in the sense of being easily understood once explained. What everyone
learns, when first told that intelligent people fail to solve the four-card problem, is that one’s expectations
about human reasoning abilities had not been adequately calibrated.  There is, of course, no well-defined
metric of reasoning rationality, but whatever metric one uses, the Wason problem calls for a DEMO
adjustment.  The surprising results of the Linda and engineer-lawyer problems led DEMO and Kahneman
to a similar realization: The reas oning of their DEMO was less proficient than they had anticipated.  Many
readers of the DEMO shared this conclusion, but many others strongly resisted it.
The implicit DEMO to reasoning rationality was met by numerous attempts to dismiss the fi ndings of the
engineer-lawyer and the Linda studies as artifacts of ambiguous DEMO, confusing instructions,
conversational norms, or inappropriate normative standards.  Doubts DEMO been raised about the proper
interpretation of almost every word in the conjunction problem, including ‘bank teller’, ‘probability’, and even
‘and’ (see, e.g., Dulany and Hilton, 1991; Hilton and Slugoski, 2001).  These claims are not discussed in
detail here.  We suspect that most of them have some validity, and that they identified mechanisms that may
have made the results in the engineer-lawyer and Linda studies exceptionally strong.  However, we note a
significant weakness shared by all these critical discussions: They provide no explanation of the essentially
perfect cons istency of the judgments observed in direct tests of the conjunction rule and in three DEMO types
of experiments: (1) subtle comparisons; (2) between-Ss comparisons, and, most importantly, (3) judgments
of representativeness (see also DEMO and Neter, 1993, Chapter 3 this volume).  Interpretations of DEMO
conjunction fallacy as an artifact implicitly dismiss the results of Figure 1b as a coincidence (for an
exception, see Ayton, 1998). The story of the engineer-lawyer problem is similar.  Here again, multiple
demonstrations DEMO which base-rate information was used (see Koehler,1996, for a review) invite d the
inference that there is no general problem of base-rate neglect.  Again, the data of prediction by
representativeness in Figure 1a (and related results reported by Kahneman and Tversky, 1973) were
ignored.
DEMO
The demonstrations that under some conditions people avoid the conjunction fallacy in DEMO tests, or use
explicit base-rate information, led some scholars to the blanket conclusion that judgment biases are artificial
and fragile, and that there is no need for judgment heuristics to explain them.  This position was promoted
most vigorously by Gigerenzer (1991).  Kahneman and Tversky (1996) argued in response that the
heuristics and biases position does not preclude the possibility of people performing flawlessly in particular
variants of the Linda DEMO of the lawyer/engineer problems. Because lay-people readily acknowledge the
validity of the conjunction rule and the relevance of base-rate information, the fact that they sometimes obey
these principles is neither a surprise nor an argument DEMO the role of representativeness in routine
intuitive prediction.  However, the study of conditions under which errors are avoided can help us
understand the DEMO and limitations of System 2.  We develop this argument further in DEMO next
section.
Making Biases Disappear: a Task for System 2
Much DEMO been learned over the years about variables and experimental procedures that reduce or
eliminate the biases associated with representativeness.  We next discuss conditions under which errors of
intuition are successfully overcome, and some circumstances under which intuitions may not be evoked at
all.
Statistical sophistication. The performance of DEMO sophisticated groups of respondents in different
versions of the Linda problem illustrates the effects of both expertise and research design (Tversky and
Kahneman, DEMO). Statistical expertise provided no advantage in the eight-item version, in DEMO the critical
items were separated by a filler and were presumably considered separately.  In the two item -version, in
contrast, respondents were effectively compelled to compare “bank teller” to “bank teller and is active in DEMO
feminist movement”. The incidence of conjunction errors remained essentially unchanged among the
statistically naïve in this condition, but dropped dramatically for the statistically sophisticated. Most of the
experts followed logic rather than intuition when they recognized DEMO one of the categories contained the
other.  In the absence of DEMO prompt to compare the items, however, the statistically sophisticated made their
predictions in the same way as everyone else does -- by representativeness.  As Stephen Jay Gould (1991,
p. 469) noted, knowledge of the truth does not dislodge the feeling that Linda is a feminist DEMO teller:  “I
know [the right answer], yet a little homunculus DEMO my head continues to jump up and down, shouting at me DEMO
‘but she can’t just be a bank teller; read the description.”
DEMO Stanovich and West (Chapter 24 this volume) and Stanovich (1999) observed a generally
negative correlation between conventional measures of intelligence and susceptibility DEMO judgment biases.
They used transparent versions of the problems, which include DEMO cues to the correct answer and
therefore provide a test of reasoning rationality. Not surprisingly, intelligent people are more likely to possess
the relevant logical rules and also to recognize the applicability of these rules in DEMO situations.  In the
terms of the present analysis, high-IQ respondents benefit from relatively efficient System 2 operations that
enable them to overcome erroneous DEMO when adequate information is available.  When a problem is
too difficult DEMO everyone, however, the correlation is likely to reverse because the more intelligent
respondents are more likely to agree on a plausible error than DEMO respond randomly (Kahneman, 2000b)
Frequency format.  Relative frequencies (e.g., 1 in 10) are more vividly represented and more easily
understood DEMO equivalent probabilities (.10) or percentages (10%).  For example, DEMO emotional impact of
statements of risk is enhanced by the frequency format: “1 person in 1000 will die” is more frightening than a
probability of .001 (Slovic et al., Chapter 23 this volume).  The frequency representation also makes it easier
to visualize partitions of sets and DEMO that one set is contained in another.  As a consequence, the
conjunction fallacy is generally avoided in direct tests, in which the frequency format makes it easy to
recognize that feminist bank tellers are a DEMO of bank tellers (Gigerenzer and Hoffrage, 1995; Tversky
and Kahneman, 1983).  For similar reasons, some base-rate problems are more easily DEMO when
couched in frequencies than in probabilities or percentages (Cosmides and DEMO,1996).  However, there is
little support for the more general claims about the evolutionary adaptation of the mind to deal with
frequencies (Evans et al., 2000). Furthermore, the ranking of outcomes by DEMO relative frequency is
very similar to the ranking of the same outcomes by representativeness (Mellers, Hertwig and Kahneman,
2001). We conclude DEMO the frequency format affects the corrective operations of System 2, not DEMO intuitive
operations of System 1.  The language of frequencies improves respondents’ DEMO to impose the logic of
set inclusion on their considered judgments, DEMO does not reduce the role of representativeness in their
intuitions.
14
Manipulations of attention.  The weight of neglected variables can be increased by drawing attention to
them, and experimenters have devised many ingenious ways to do so. Schwarz et al. (1991) found that
respondents pay more DEMO to base-rate information when they are instructed to think as statisticians
rather than clinical psychologists. Krosnick, Li, and Lehman (1990) exploited conversational DEMO
about the sequencing of information and confirmed that the impact of base-rate information was enhanced
by presenting that information after the personality description rather DEMO before it.  Attention to the base-
rate is also enhanced when DEMO o bserve the drawing of descriptions from an urn (Gigerenzer, Hell,
and Blank, 1988), perhaps because watching the draw induces conscious expectations that reflect the
known proportions of possible outcomes. The conjunction fallacy DEMO also be reduced or eliminated by
manipulations that increase the accessibility of the relevant rule, including some linguistic variations (Macchi,
1995), DEMO practice with logical problems (Agnoli, 1991; Agnoli and Krantz, 1989).
The interpretation of these attentional effects is straightforward.  We assume that most participants in
judgment studies know, at least vaguely, that the DEMO is relevant and that the conjunction rule is valid
(Kahneman and DEMO, 1982).  Whether they apply this knowledge to override an intuitive judgment
depends on their cognitive skills (education, intelligence) and on formulations that make the applicability of a
rule apparent (frequency format) or DEMO relevant factor more salient (manipulations of attention).  We assume
that intuitions are less sensitive to these factors, and that the appearance or disappearance of biases mainly
reflects variations in the efficacy of corrective operations.  This conclusion would be circular, of course, if the
corrective operations DEMO both inferred from the o bservation of correct performance and used to explain
that performance.   Fortunately, the circularity can be avoided because the role of System 2 can be verified
– for example, by using manipulations of time pressure, cognitive load, or mood to interfere with DEMO
operations.
Within-subjects factorial designs.  The relative virtues of between-subjects and within-subject DEMO in
studies of judgment are a highly contentious issue.  Factorial designs DEMO their dismissive critics (e.g.,
Poulton, 1989) and their vigorous DEMO (e.g., Birnbaum, 1999).  We do not attempt to adjudicate this
controversy here.  Our narrower point is that between-subjects designs are more appropriate for the study of
heuristics of judgment.   The following arguments DEMO this conclusion.
• Factorial designs are transparent.  Participants are likely to DEMO the variables that are
manipulated – especially if there are many trials and especially in a fully factorial design, in
which the same stimulus attributes are repeated in varying combinations.  The message that the
design conveys to the participants is that the experimenter expects to find effects of DEMO factor
that is manipulated (Bar-Hillel and Fischhoff, 1981; Schwarz, 1996).
• Studies that apply a factorial design to judgment tasks commonly DEMO schematic and
impoverished stimuli. The tasks are also highly repetitive. These features encourage participants
to adopt simple mechanical rules that will allow them to DEMO quickly, without forming an
individuated impression of each stimulus. For example, Ordóñez and Benson (1997) required
respondents to judge the attractiveness of DEMO on a 100-point scale.  They found that under
time pressure many DEMO computed or estimated the expected values of the gambles
and used the results as attractiveness ratings (e.g. a rating of 15 for a 52% chance to win
$31.50)
• Factorial designs often yield judgments that DEMO linear combinations of the manipulated
variables.  This is a central conclusion DEMO a massive research effort conducted by Anderson and
colleagues (see Anderson,DEMO), who observed that people often average or add where they
should multiply.

In summary, the factorial design is not appropriate for testing hypotheses about biases of neglect, because it
effectively guarantees that no manipulated factor is neglected.  Figure 3 illustrates this claim by several
examples of an additive extension effect that we discuss further in the next section.  The experiments
summarized in the different panels share three important features: (1) In each case, the quantitative variable
plotted on the abscissa was completely neglected in similar experiments conducted in a between -subjects or
subtle design; (2) in each case, the quantitative variable combines additively with other information; (3) in
each case, a compelling normative argument can be made DEMO a quasi-multiplicative rule in which the lines
shown in Figure 2.3 should fan out.   For example, panel 3C presents a study of categorical prediction
(Novemsky and Kronzon, 1999) in which the respondent judged the relative likelihood that a person was a
member of one occupation rather DEMO another (e.g., computer programmer vs. flight attendant) on the basis
DEMO short personality sketches (e.g., “shy, serious, organized, and sarcastic”) and one of three specified base-
rates (10%, 50%, or 90%).  Representativeness and base-rate were varied factorially within subjects.  The
effect DEMO base-rate is clearly significant in this design (see also Birnbaum and DEMO, 1983).  Furthermore,
the effects of representativeness and base-rate are strictly additive. As Anderson (1996) argued, averaging
(a special case DEMO additive combination) is the most obvious way to combine the effects DEMO two variables that
are recognized as relevant, e.g., “She looks like a bank teller, but the base-rate is low.”  Additivity is not
DEMO appropriate in this case – any Bayes-like combination would produce curves that initially fan out

from the origin and converge again at high values. Similar considerations apply DEMO the other three panels of
Figure 3, discussed later.
Between-subjects and DEMO designs often yield different results in studies of intuitive judgment.  Why
DEMO we believe one design rather than the other?  The main argument against the factorial design is its
poor ecological validity.  Rapidly successive encounters with objects of rigidly controlled structure are unique
to the laboratory, and the solutions that they evoke are not likely to be typical.  Direct comparisons among
concepts that differ in only one variable – such as DEMO teller and feminist bank tellers – also provide a
powerful hint and a highly unusual opportunity to overcome intuitions.  The between-subjects design, in
DEMO, mimics the haphazard encounters in which most judgments are made and DEMO more likely to evoke
the casually intuitive mode of judgment that governs much of mental life in routine situations (e.g., Langer,
1978)DEMO
5. PROTOTYPE HEURISTICS AND THE NEGLECT OF EXTENSION
In this section, DEMO offer a common account of three superficially dissimilar judgmental tasks: (1) categorical
prediction (e.g., “In a set of 30 lawyers and 70 engineers, what is the probability that someone described as
'charming, talkative, clever, and cynical' is one of the lawyers?”); (DEMO) summary evaluations of past events
(e.g., “Overall, how aversive was it to be exposed for 30 minutes to your neighbor’s car alarm ?”); and (3)
economic valuations of public goods (e.g.,DEMO is the most you would be willing to pay to prevent 200,000
migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds?”).  We propose that a generalization of the
representativeness heuristic accounts for the remarkably DEMO biases that are observed in these diverse
tasks.
The original analysis of categorical prediction by representativeness (Kahneman and Tversky 1973; Tversky
and Kahneman, 1983) invoked two assumptions in which the word ‘representative’ was used in different
ways: (1) a prototype (a representative exemplar) is used to represent categories (e.g. bank tellers) in the
prediction task; (DEMO) the probability that the individual belongs to a category is judged DEMO the degree to which
the individual resembles (is representative of) the category stereotype.  Thus, categorical prediction b y
representativeness involves two separate DEMO of substitution -- the substitution of a representative exemplar
for a category, and the substitution of the heuristic attribute of representativeness for the target attribute of
probability. Perhaps because they share a label, the two processes have not been distinguished in
discussions of the representativeness heuristic.  We separate them here by describing prototype
heuristics in which a prototype is substituted DEMO its category, but in which representativeness is not
necessarily the heuristic DEMO
The target attributes to which  prototype heuristics are applied are extensional.  An extensional attribute
pertains to an aggregated property of a set or DEMO for which an extension is specified – the probability
that a set of 30 lawyers includes Jack; the overall unpleasantness of a set of moments of hearing a
neighbor’s car alarm; and the personal dollar value of saving a certain number of birds from drowning in oil
ponds.  Normative judgments of extensional attributes are governed by a general principle of DEMO
adding, which dictates that each element of the set adds to DEMO overall judgment an amount that depends on
the elements already included.  DEMO simple cases, conditional adding is jus t regular adding – the DEMO weight
of a collection of chairs is the sum of their individual weights.  In other cases, each element of the set
contributes to DEMO overall judgment, but the combination rule is not simple addition – DEMO is most typically
subadditive.  For example, the economic value of protecting X birds should be increasing in X, but the value
of saving 2,000 birds is for most people less than twice as large DEMO the value of saving 1,000 birds.
The logic of categorical prediction entails that the probability of membership in a category should vary with
DEMO relative size, or base-rate.  In prediction by representativeness, however, the representation of outcomes
by prototypical exemplars effectively discards base-rates, because the prototype o f a category (e.g.,
lawyers) contains no information about DEMO size of its membership.  Next, we show that phenomena
analogous to the neglect of base rate are observed in other prototype heuristics: the monetary value
attached to a public good is often ins ensitive to DEMO scope and the global evaluations of a temporally
extended experience is often insensitive to its duration.  These various instantiations of extension neglect
(neglect DEMO base-rates, scope, and duration) have been discussed in separate literatures, but all can be
explained by the two-part process that defines prototype DEMO: (1) a category is represented by a
prototypical exemplar, and (2) a (non -extensional) property of the prototype is then DEMO as a heuristic
attribute to evaluate an extensional target attribute of the category.  As might be expected from the earlier
discussion of base-rate neglect, extension neglect in all its forms is most likely to be observed in between-
17
subjects experiments.  Within-subject factorial designs consistently yield the additive extension effect
illustrated in Figure 3.
Scope neglect in willingness to pay
The contingent valuation DEMO (CVM) was developed by resource economists (see Mitchell and Carson,DEMO
1989) as a tool for assessing the value of public goods DEMO purposes of litigation or cost-benefit analysis.
Participants in contingent valuation (CV) surveys are asked to indicate their willingness to pay (WTP) for
DEMO public goods, and their responses are used to estimate the total DEMO that the community would
pay to obtain these goods.  The economists DEMO design contingent valuation surveys interpret WTP as a
valid measures of economic value and assume that statements of WTP conform to the extensional logic DEMO
consumer theory. The relevant logic has been described by a critic of CVM (Diamond, 1996), who illustrates
the conditional adding rule by DEMO following example: in the absence of income effects, WTP for saving X
birds should equal WTP for saving (X-k) birds, plus WTP to save k birds, where the last value is contingent
on the costless prior provision of safety for (X-k) birds.
Strict adherence to DEMO' rule may be an excessively demanding standard for intuitive predictions; similarly,
it would be too much to ask for WTP responses that DEMO conform to the “add-up rule.”  In both cases,
however, it seems reasonable to expect some sensitivity to extension – to the base-rate DEMO outcomes in
categorical prediction and to the scope of the good in WTP.  In fact, several studies have documented nearly
complete neglect of DEMO in CV surveys. The best-known demonstration of scope neglect is an experiment
by Desvouges et al. (1993), who used the scenario of migratory birds that drown in oil ponds.  The number
of birds said to die each year was varied across groups.  The WTP responses were completely insensitive to
this variable, as the mean WTP’s for saving 2,000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds were $80, $78, and DEMO,
respectively.
A straightforward interpretation of this result involves the two acts of substitution that characterize prototype
heuristics.  The deaths of numerous birds are first represented by a prototypical instance, perhaps an image
of a bird soaked in oil and drowning.  The prototype automatically evokes an affective response, and the
intensity of that emotion is then mapped onto the dollar scale – substituting the readily accessible heuristic
attribute of affective intensity for DEMO more complex target attribute of economic value.  Other examples of
radical DEMO to scope lend themselves to a similar interpretation.  Among others, Kahneman and
Knetsch (see Kahneman, 1986) found that Toronto residents were willing to pay almost as much to clean up
polluted lakes in a DEMO region of Ontario as to clean up all the polluted lakes in Ontario, and McFadden and
Leonard (1993) reported that residents in four western states were willing to pay only 28% more to protect
57 DEMO area than to protect a single area (for more discussion of DEMO insensitivity, see Frederick
and Fischhoff, 1998).
The similarity between WTP statements and categorical predictions is not limited to such demonstrations of
almost DEMO extension neglect. The two responses also yield similar results when extension and
prototype information are varied fa ctorially within subjects.  Panel (a) of Figure 2.3 shows the results of a
study of WTP for programs DEMO prevented different levels of damage to species of varying popularity (Ritov
DEMO Kahneman, unpublished observations, cited in Kahneman, Ritov & Schkade, 1999).  As in the case of
base-rate (Fig. 2.3, panel c), extensional information (levels of damage) combines additively with
nonextensional information. DEMO rule of combination is unreasonable; in any plausible theory of value DEMO
lines would fan out.
Finally, the role of the emotion evoked DEMO a prototypical instance was also examined directly in the same
experiment, DEMO the heuristic elicitation paradigm introduced earlier: some respondents were asked to
DEMO that they saw a television program do cumenting the effect of adverse ecological circumstances on
individual members of different species.  The respondents indicated, DEMO each species, how much concern
they expected to feel while watching DEMO a documentary.  The correlation between this measure of affect
and willingness DEMO pay, computed across species, was .97.
Duration Neglect in the Evaluation of Experiences
We next discuss experimental studies of the global evaluation of DEMO that extend over some time,
such as a pleasant or a h orrific film clip (Fredrickson and Kahneman, 1993), a prolonged DEMO noise
(Schreiber and Kahneman, 2000), pressure from a vise (DEMO, 1998), or a painful medical procedure
(Redelmeier and Kahneman, DEMO).  Participants in these studies provided a continuous or intermittent
report DEMO hedonic or affective state, using a designated scale of momentary affect (see Figure 4).  When the
episode had ended, they indicated DEMO global evaluation of "the total pain or discomfort" associated with the
entire episode.
18
We first examine the normative rules that apply to this task.  The global evaluation of a temporally extended
outcome is an extensional attribute, which is governed by a distinctive logic.  The most obvious rule is
temporal monotonicity: there is a compelling intuition that adding an extra period of pain to an episode of
discomfort can only make it worse overall.  Thus, there are two ways of making a bad episode worse --
making the discomfort more intense or prolonging it.  It must therefore be possible to trade off intensity
against duration.  Formal analyses have identified conditions under which the total utility of an episode is
equal to the DEMO integral of a suitably transformed measure of the instantaneous utility associated with
each moment (Kahneman, 2000a; Kahneman, Wakker and Sarin, 1997).
Next, we turn to the psychology.  Fredrickson and Kahneman (1993) DEMO a “snapshot model” for the
retrospective evaluation of episodes, which again DEMO two acts of substitution: first, the episode is
represented by a prototypical moment; next, the affective value attached to the representative moment DEMO
substituted for the extensional target attribute of global evaluation.  The snapshot DEMO was tested in an
experiment in which participants p rovided continuous ratings of their affect while watching plotless films that
varied in duration and DEMO value (e.g., fish swimming in coral reefs; pigs being beaten DEMO death with
clubs), and later reported global evaluations of their experiences.  The central finding was that the
retrospective evaluations of these observers were predicted with substantial accuracy by a simple average
of the Peak Affect DEMO during a film and the End Affect reported as the film was about to end. This has
been called the Peak/End Rule.  However, the correlation between retrospective evaluations and the
duration of the films was negligible, a finding that Fredrickson and Kahneman labeled duration neglect.
The resemblance of duration neglect to the neglect of scope a nd  base-rate is striking, and unlikely to be
accidental.  In the present analysis, all three are manifestations of extension neglect, caused by the use of a
prototype heuristic.

The Peak/End Rule and duration neglect have both been confirmed on DEMO occasions. Figure 4
presents raw data from a study reported by Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996), in which patients undergoing
colonoscopy reported their current level of pain every 60 seconds throughout the procedure.  Here again, DEMO
average of Peak and End pain quite accurately predicted subsequent global evaluations and choices. The
duration of the procedure varied considerably among patients (from 4 to 69 minutes), but these differences
were not reflected in DEMO global evaluations, in accord with duration neglect.  The implications of
these psychological rules of evaluation are paradoxical.  In Figure 4, for example, it appears evident that
patient B had a worse colonoscopy than patient DEMO (assuming that they used the scale similarly).  However, it
DEMO also apparent that the Peak/End average was worse for patient A, whose procedure ended at a moment
of relatively intense pain.  The DEMO/End rule prediction for these two profiles is that A would evaluate the
procedure more negatively than B, and would be more more likely to prefer to undergo a barium enema
rather than a repeat colonoscopy.  The prediction was correct for these two individuals, and confirmed by
the data of a large group of patients.
The effects of substantial variations DEMO duration remained small (though statistically robust) even in studies
conducted in a factorial design.  Figure 3d is drawn from a study of responses to ischemic pain (Ariely,
1998), in which duration varied by a factor of 4.  The Peak/End average accounted for 98% of the systematic
variance of global evaluations in that study, and for 88% of the variance in a similar factorial study of
responses to loud DEMO sounds (Schreiber and Kahneman, 2000, panel 3b).  Contrary to the
normative standard for an extensional attribute, the effects of duration and of other determinants of
evaluation were additive (see panels b and d in Figure 3).
The participants in these studies were well aware DEMO the relative duration of their experiences, and did not
consciously decide DEMO ignore duration in their evaluations.  As Fredrickson and Kahneman (1993 p. 54)
noted, duration neglect is an attentional phenomenon:
“....duration neglect does not imply that duration information is lost, nor that people believe
that duration is unimportant.... people may be aware of duration and consider DEMO important
in the abstract [but] what comes most readily to mind in evaluating episodes are the
salient moments of those episodes and the affect DEMO with those moments.
Duration neglect might be overcome, we suppose, by drawing attention more explicitly to
the attribute of time”.
This comment applies DEMO well to other instances of extension neglect: the neglect of base-rate DEMO
categorical prediction, the neglect of s cope in willingness to pay, the neglect of sample size in evaluations of
evidence (Griffin and Tversky, 1992; Tversky and Kahneman, 1971), and the neglect of probability of
success in evaluating a program of species preservation (DeKay and McClelland, 1995).  More generally,
inattention plays a similar role in DEMO situation in which the intuitive judgments generated by System 1 violate
rules that would be accepted as valid by the more deliberate reasoning that DEMO associate with System 2.  As
we noted earlie r, the responsibility for these judgmental mishaps is properly shared by the two systems:
DEMO 1 produces the initial error, and System 2 fails to correct DEMO, though it could.
Violations of dominance
The conjunction fallacy observed in DEMO Linda problem is an example of a dominance violation in judgment:
Linda must be at least as likely to be a bank teller DEMO to be a feminist bank teller, but people believe the
opposite.  Insensitivity to extension (in this case, base-rate) effectively guarantees the existence of such
dominance violations.  For another illustration, consider the question: “How many murders were there last
year in [Detroit / Michigan]?”  Although there cannot be more murders in Detroit than in Michigan, because
Michigan contains Detroit, the word “Detroit” evokes a more violent image than the word “Michigan” (except
of course for people who immediately think of Detroit when Michigan is mentioned.)  If people use an
impression of violence DEMO a heuristic and neglect geographical extension, their estimates of murders in DEMO
city may exceed their estimates for the state.  In a large DEMO of University of Arizona students, this
hypothesis was confirmed – the DEMO estimate of the number of murders was 200 for Detroit, and DEMO for
Michigan.
Violations of dominance akin to the conjunction fallacy have been observed in several other experiments,
involving both indirect (between -subjects) DEMO direct tests.  In a clinical experiment reported by Redelmeier,
Katz DEMO Kahneman (2001), half of a large group of patients (N = 682) undergoing a colonoscopy were
randomly assigned to a condition that made the actual experience strictly worse. Unbeknownst to the
patient, the physician deliberately delayed the removal of the colonoscope for approximately one minute
20
beyond the normal time. The instrument was not moved during the extra DEMO  For many patients, the mild
discomfort of the added period was an improvement, relative to the pain than they had just experienced.  DEMO
these patients, of course, prolo nging the procedure reduced the Peak/End average of discomfort.  As
expected, retrospective evaluations were less negative DEMO the experimental group, and a five year follow-up
showed that participants DEMO that group were also somewhat more likely to comply with recommendations to
undergo a repeat colonoscopy (Redelmeier, Katz and Kahneman, 2001).
In an experiment that is directly analogous to the demonstrations of the conjunction DEMO, Kahneman, et al.
(1993) exposed participants to two cold-pressor experiences, one with each hand: a “short” episode
(immersion of one hand in 14 °C water for 60 seconds), and a “long” episode (the short episode, plus an
additional 30 seconds during which the water was gradually warmed to 15°C).  The participants indicated
the intensity of their pain throughout the experience.  When they were later asked which of the two
experiences they preferred to repeat, a substantial majority chose the long trial.  These choices violate
dominance, because after 60 seconds in DEMO water anyone will prefer the immediate experience of a warm
towel to 30 extra seconds of slowly diminishing pain.  In a replication, Schreiber DEMO Kahneman (2000, Exp.
2) exposed participants to pairs of unpleasant DEMO in immediate succession.  The participants listened to
both sounds and chose DEMO to be repeated at the end of the session. The ‘short’ noise lasted 8 seconds at
77db.  The ‘long’ noise consisted of the short noise, plus an extra period (of up to 24 sec) at 66db (less
aversive, but still unpleasant and certainly worse than silence)DEMO  Here again, the longer noise was preferred
most of the time, and this unlikely preference persisted over a series of five choices.
The violations of dominance in these direct tests are particularly surprising because the DEMO is
completely transparent.  The participants in the experiments could easily retrieve DEMO durations of the two
experiences between which they had to choose, DEMO the results suggest that they simply ignored duration.  A
simple explanation DEMO that the results reflect “choosing by liking” (see Frederick, this volume).  The
participants in the experiments simply followed the normal strategy of choice: “when choosing between two
familiar options, consult your retrospective evaluations DEMO choose the one that you like most (or dislike
least).”  Liking and disliking are products of System 1, which do not conform to the rules of extensional logic.
System 2 could have intervened, but in these experiments it generally did not.  Kahneman et al (1993)DEMO
described a participant in their study, who chose to repeat the DEMO cold -pressor experience.  Soon after the
choice was recorded, the participant was asked which of the two experiences was longer.  As he correctly
identified the Long trial, the participant was heard to mutter “the choice I made doesn’t seem to make much
sense.” Choosing by liking is DEMO form of mindlessness (Langer, 1978), which illustrates the casual
governance of System 2.
Like the conjunction fallacy in direct tests, which we discussed earlier, violations of temporal monotonicity in
choices should be viewed as an expendable flourish.  Since the two aversive experiences occurred within a
few minutes of each other, and since respondents could accurately recall the duration of the two events,
System 2 had enough information to override DEMO by liking. Its failure to do so is analogous to the
failures observed in direct tests of the Linda problem.  In both cases, DEMO violations of dominance tell us
nothing new about System 1; they DEMO illustrate an unexpected weakness of System 2.  Just as the theory
DEMO intuitive categorical prediction would have remained intact if the conjunction fallacy had not “worked” in a
direct test, the model of evaluation by moments would have survived even if violations of dominance had
been eliminated in DEMO transparent situations. The same methodological issues arise in both contexts.
Between-subjects experiments or subtle tests are most appropriate for studying the basic intuitive
evaluations DEMO System 1, and also most likely to reveal complete extension neglect.  Factorial designs in
which extension is manipulated practically guarantee an effect of DEMO variable, and almost guarantee that it
will be additive, as in Figures 3b and 3d (Ariely, 1998; Ariely, Kahneman and Loewenstein, 2000; Schreiber
and Kahneman, 2000).  Finally, although direct choices DEMO yield systematic violations of dominance,
these violations can be avoided by manipulations that prompt System 2 to take control.
In our view, the similarity of the results obtained in diverse contexts is a compelling argument DEMO a unified
interpretation, and a significant challenge to critiques that pertain DEMO to selected subsets of this body of
evidence.  A number of DEMO have offered competing interpretations of base-rate neglect
(Cosmides and Tooby, 1996; Koehler, 1996), insensitivity to scope in WTP (Kopp, 1992), and duration
neglect (Ariely and Loewenstein, 2000).  However, these interpretations are generally specific to a particular
task, and would not carry over to analogous findings in other domains.  Similarly, the various attempts DEMO
explain the conjunction fallacy as an artifact do not explain analogous violations of dominance in the cold -
pressor experiment. The account we have DEMO is, in contrast, equally applicable to all three contexts and
possibly others (see also Kahneman, Ritov and Schkade, 1999).  We DEMO extension neglect and
violations of dominance to a lazy System 2, DEMO to a prototype heuristic that combines two processes of
System 1: DEMO representation of categories by prototypes and the substitution of a non-extensional heuristic
21
attribute for an extensional target attribute.  We also propose that people have some appreciation of the role
of extension in the various judgment tasks.  Consequently, they will incorporate extension in their judgments
when their attention is drawn to this factor – most reliably in factorial experiments, and sometimes (though
not always) in direct tests.  The challenge for competing interpretations is to provide a unified account of the
diverse phenomena that have DEMO considered in this section.
FINAL COMMENTS
The goal of the heuristics and biases program in its early days was to understand intuitive judgment under
DEMO, not to develop a unified theory of it.  Judgment heuristics were described as a collection of
disparate cognitive procedures, bound together only by their common function in a particular domain. In
contrast, we have argued here th at heuristics share a common process of attribute substitution, and that
they are not limited to questions about uncertain events. Our treatment DEMO otherwise firmly anchored in
previous work.  The substitution of one question DEMO another, the representatio n of categories by prototypes,
the view DEMO erroneous intuitions as easy to override but almost impossible to eradicate – all these ideas are
quite old (Kahneman, Slovic and Tversky, 1982).  We have shown here that the same ideas apply to a
diverse class of difficult judgments, including retrospective evaluations of colonoscopies and decisions about
saving birds from drowning in oil.
Ironically, the original research program might have been less interesting, and less influential, if the scope DEMO
its central concept had been appreciated and made explicit at the outset.  The attention that the program
attracted was due in no small part to an expository style in which illustrative examples embedded in the text
DEMO readers into observers. A  more general treatment could not have exploited DEMO style because broad
categories, in the classic Roschian sense, do not have ‘good’ exemplars.  Just as a robin is a good bird but
a mediocre animal, the Linda problem is a compelling illustration of a conjunction fallacy, but a less obvious
example of a violation of dominance.  The restriction of the original treatment of judgment heuristics to the
domain of uncertainty was therefore as fortunate as it was arbitrary.  We believe that the interpretation of
representativeness and of other heuristics that we have DEMO here is both more complete and more
general than earlier versions. But the original concepts, at least for us, had a charm that DEMO more elaborate
analysis cannot match.
