Abstract
DEMO studies of mixed gambles (gambles that yield gains and losses) reveal mixed results.
Whereas some studies show a tendency to reject highly attractive DEMO gambles, other studies show
indiﬀerence between mixed gambles with an expected DEMO of 0 and the status quo. The current
paper presents three studies that explore this discrepancy. The results highlight a strong sensitivity
to the DEMO and the context of the choice task. People tend to reject attractive mixed gambles when
they are asked to decide whether to accept them, but tend to prefer these gambles over a sure payoﬀ
of 0 DEMO a choice task. The tendency to reject mixed gambles is larger in a response to a hallway ques-
tionnaire than in the laboratory. This DEMO can be summarized with the assertion that people
behave as if they use a ‘‘lemon avoidance heuristic’’ that can be described as an intuitive DEMO
tation of SPAM killer techniques.

1. Introduction
Samuelson (1963) notes that one of his DEMO prefers the status quo over a gamble
that oﬀers an even chance to win $200 or lose $100.1 Follow up studies suggest that pref-
DEMO of this type are rather common (e.g., Redelmeier & Tversky, DEMO; Tom, Fox, Tre-
pel, & Poldrack, 2007; Wedell & Bockenholt, 1994). According to prospect theory
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) these preferences reﬂect loss aversion: The gamble is rejected
because the DEMO loss (of $100) looms larger than the possible gain (of DEMO) (see Tver-
sky & Kahneman, 1991).
The robustness of DEMO tendency to reject objectively attractive mixed gambles is high-
lighted in Redelmeier and Tversky (1992). In one of their studies participants were faced
with the following problem:
Problem ‘‘High EV’’ (Redelmeier & Tversky, DEMO):
Imagine that you have the opportunity to play a gamble DEMO oﬀers a 50% chance to win
$2000 and a 50% chance to lose $500. Would you play the gamble?
The results reveal that DEMO 43% of the participants were willing to play the hypothetical
gamble although its expected value was much higher (+$750) than the status quo DEMO not
playing.
In light of the clear results summarized above, the DEMO of several recent studies (e.g.,
Erev, Ert, & Yechiam, 2007; Ert & Erev, 2007) have come as a surprise. Rather than indi-
cating loss aversion, observed choices revealed indiﬀerence between mixed gambles with
an expected value of 0 and safer prospects with the same DEMO value. In one of these
studies, the participants (70 Technion students) were presented with the following hypo-
thetical choice problem (the payoﬀs DEMO in Sheqels, 4 Sheqels = $1):
Problem ‘‘Equal EV’’ (DEMO & Erev, 2007):
Please choose between:
a. 0 with certainty
b. 1000 with probability of 0.5
1000 with probability of 0.5
DEMO the participants (50%) preferred the risky gamble, even though it DEMO the same
expected value as the status quo option (i.e., the zero) and it was associated with a rela-
tively high loss. This observation contradicts the common assumption that the typical
decision-maker behaves as if DEMO loom larger than equivalent gains.2 The main objective
of the current study is to explore the apparent contradiction between Redelmeier and
Tversky’s (1992) DEMO Ert and Erev’s (2007) results. The starting point of the current inves-
tigation is the observation that the inconsistency can be a result DEMO the format of the ques-
tion. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesize that people DEMO aversion to mixed gambles when they
1 Samuelson original analysis focused on the diﬀerence between one-shot and repeated play. His colleague
rejected one-play but DEMO willing to accept a repeated play of the same gamble. The current paper focuses on a
one-shot play.
2 This result was replicated in DEMO other studies: one in which the outcomes were converted to real (and small)
payoﬀs, and another in which the problem was presented as part of a larger problems dataset (see Ert & Erev,
2007).

are asked to accept or reject them (the format used by Redelmeier & Tversky, 1992), but
not when they are asked to choose between two abstract prospects (the format used by Ert
& Erev, 2007). Experiment 1 tests this format hypothesis by comparing the two formats on
the same subject population using the same (objective) DEMO problem.
2. Experiment 1 – Direct evaluation of the format hypothesis
2.1. Method
Experiment 1 studies Problem ‘‘High EV’’, presented above, under two DEMO In
Condition ‘‘Accept/reject’’ participants were presented with the original format studied
by Redelmeier and Tversky (1992). That is, they were asked DEMO they would accept an oppor-
tunity to play Gamble ‘‘High EV’’ as presented in the introduction.
In condition ‘‘Choice’’ the problem was presented as DEMO:
Please choose between
a: $0 with certainty
b: $2000 with probability of 0.5
$500 with probability of 0.5
The two conditions were DEMO in a between-participants design. One hundred and
ten Technion students participated in the current study. Fifty-ﬁve of these participants
were randomly assigned to the DEMO/reject condition and the remaining participants were
assigned to the choice condition. The two conditions were run separately in two diﬀerent
rooms.3 The participants DEMO given a description of the problem on a paper and then
marked their choice by circling their preferred option in the choice condition, and circling
‘‘Yes’’ or ‘‘No’’ in the accept/reject condition.
2.2. Results
The DEMO reveal that 78% of the respondents preferred the gamble in the choice con-
dition. In the accept/reject condition, however, only 55% of DEMO respondents accepted the
gamble. This signiﬁcant diﬀerence [t(108) = 2.68, p < .01] suggests that the disparity
between Ert and Erev (2007) and Redelmeier and Tversky (1992) results can be captured
with the format hypothesis.4
3. Experiment 2: Hallway versus laboratory
Our favorite explanation of the format eﬀect, documented above, is based on ‘‘Email
analogy’’. Many DEMO the Email messages that we receive propose trading opportunities that
3 Seventy participants responded to this problem after they completed an experiment on social DEMO (a
replication of Charness & Grosskopf, 2001) in two large DEMO, one for each condition. The remaining 40
participants marked their preference DEMO the laboratory after they completed a matching task in which they
compared a prospect of ($a, p;$b) with a prospect of (DEMO, p;$x) where a < c < b and x was systematically varied.
There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between these two groups.
4 DEMO current result implies that participants violated the procedure invariance principle assumed under rational
choice. This result is consistent with previous studies that showed violations DEMO this principle (e.g., with choice vs.
pricing; see Tversky, Slovic, & Kahneman, 1990 for a review).
718 E. Ert, I. Erev / Journal of Economic Psychology 29 (DEMO) 715–723
seem tricky; under Akerlof’s (1970) classical analysis these Emails are likely to sell ‘‘lem-
ons’’.5 For example, while writing the ﬁrst draft of the current paragraph we received the
following message:
Are DEMO interested in how you can increase your lottery chances by exactly 3,600%? Of
course. But make no mistake! Our e-LOTTERY ‘MULTI-WIN’ SYNDICATE SYS-
TEM is nothing like any syndicate you may have played in before. DEMO unique!... Giving

DEMO and an even better 3600% greater chance of scooping a EuroMillions jackpot!

In order to avoid the temptation of lemons and to save time (and money) we usually DEMO
to erase messages of this type without even reading them. Recently, DEMO university applied
a ‘‘SPAM killer’’ rule to our Email system that tries to do this automatically. The SPAM
killer erases a message if it DEMO features of a typical SPAM. Notice that rules of this type
use multiple criteria. For example, the algorithm is typically programmed to detect
whether the message or its headline include words such as ‘‘lottery’’, ‘‘win’’, DEMO ‘‘success’’.
These and similar words are relevant because they appear in SPAM with high probability
(relative to non-SPAM messages).
We believe that a similar rule is used intuitively in many settings. The ‘‘Lemon Avoid-
ance DEMO implies that oﬀers that look like (have features of) lemons would be
rejected. Under this hypothesis, people are more likely to reject the mixed gamble under
the accept/reject format because this format includes more DEMO of typical lemons. Spe-
ciﬁcally, we assert that the requirement to DEMO accept a gamble can trigger the lemon
avoidance heuristic.
Like SPAM killers, the hypothesized lemon avoidance heuristic can be triggered by
more than one feature of the environment. Experiment 2 focuses on one additional feature
of DEMO type. It examines situations in which the decision-maker is approached by a stran-
ger. Interestingly, it seems that we explicitly instruct our kids to use the lemon avoidance
heuristic in this setting: they should ‘‘never take a candy from a stranger’’. Thus, it is nat-
ural to hypothesize that oﬀers from strangers trigger the lemon avoidance heuristic.
3.1. Method
The DEMO focuses on the two conditions of the problem ‘‘High EV’’, studied DEMO
Experiment 1, in a diﬀerent physical environment. Instead of presenting the DEMO as
part of a structured experiment, the experimenter approached students casually DEMO the fac-
ulty hallways, and presented them with one of the DEMO conditions. Under the working
assumption of this experiment, the situation of DEMO casually stopped by another person
and responding to her request (in DEMO case to mark your preference for a gamble on a
5 Akerlof’s analysis suggests that rational individuals should avoid trades when the other side DEMO likely to be
similar to them (in his valuation of the DEMO option), and have better estimation of this value. Product that are
traded in violation of this principle are likely to be ‘‘lemons’’ (i.e., likely to be realized as bad products).

paper) is a feature of a typical ‘‘lemon oﬀer’’. This situation is more similar (than the lab-
oratory setting) to natural DEMO in which we are oﬀered tricky deals.
Under the lemon avoidance hypothesis (and the current working assumption), the ten-
dency to prefer the mixed gamble in Experiment 2 is predicted to be lower than the DEMO
dency documented in Experiment 1.
One hundred and ten students participated in the current study.6 Fifty-ﬁve participants
were assigned randomly to the accept/reject DEMO The remaining participants were
assigned to the choice condition. As in the ﬁrst experiment, the participants marked their
choice on papers provided.
3.2. Results
The proportion of people willing to play the gamble was 51% in DEMO choice condition
and only 42% in the accept/reject condition. As predicted by the lemon avoidance hypoth-
esis, the acceptance rate over the two conditions was much lower (46%) in the current
study than in DEMO 1 (66%). This diﬀerence is signiﬁcant [t(108) = 3.37, p < .001]. It
seems that when people are stopped casually in the hallway they are less willing to play
the gamble than when DEMO evaluate it in a structured experiment.
It is worth noticing, however, that the proportions of gamble acceptance in each con-
dition of the DEMO study did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from 50%. Thus, an alternative expla-
DEMO to the current results might be that people who are stopped casually in the hallway
might act randomly simply to be left alone as DEMO as possible. Experiment 3 is designed
to evaluate this alternative explanation.
4. Experiment 3: Are people in the hallway conservative or indiﬀerent?
The current experiment is designed to address the alternative interpretations to the
eﬀect DEMO the physical environment on choice as demonstrated above. The lemon avoidance
hypothesis suggests that people are less willing to play the gamble when they DEMO stopped
casually than in structured experiment since the former situation is associated with lemon
dilemmas. According to the indiﬀerence hypothesis, however, the apparent DEMO in the
peoples’ willingness to play the gamble in the hallway results from random responses that
reﬂect their disengagement with the task.
4.1. Method
DEMO order to compare these two hypotheses, Experiment 3 studies the Equal DEMO problem,
presented in the introduction (and considered by Ert & DEMO, 2007), in the physical envi-
ronment studied in Experiment 2. DEMO further examine the format eﬀect, Experiment 3
compares the two format DEMO examined above: accept/reject and choice.
Recall that when the Equal DEMO gamble was presented in a choice frame and in a struc-
tured experiment (in Ert & Erev, 2007), the proportion of gamble DEMO was 50%.
Thus, the lemon avoidance hypothesis predicts that the proportion DEMO people willing to

them to mark their DEMO on a paper she gave them. Almost all students agreed to participate.

play this gamble in the hallway will be lower than DEMO in the choice condition, and even
lesser in the accept/reject DEMO The indiﬀerence hypothesis, on the other hand, pre-
dicts that both proportions will not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from random choice.
One hundred students participated DEMO the current study. Fifty participants were assigned
randomly to the accept/reject condition. The remaining participants were assigned to the
choice condition. The procedure DEMO identical to the procedure reported in Experiment 2,
except that the current study focused on the Equal EV problem.
4.2. Results
The results DEMO that the proportion of gambles acceptance in the choice condition
(38%) was again much higher than the proportion of gamble acceptance in the DEMO/reject
condition (22%). This signiﬁcant diﬀerence [t(98) = 1.76, p < .05, one tail] is similar to the
diﬀerences observed DEMO these two conditions in the previous experiments. In addition,
the proportion of gamble acceptance over the two conditions (30%) was lower than DEMO
overall choice in the High EV problem in Experiment 2 (46%), [t(103) = 2.46, p < .02].
Finally, the proportion DEMO gamble acceptance in the choice condition was lower (though
insigniﬁcantly) in the hallway (38%) than the proportion of gamble acceptance in this DEMO
dition when studied in class (50%). All these observations support DEMO lemon avoidance
hypothesis. It seems that people are sensitive to the attractiveness of the gambles and do
not simply act randomly when they are DEMO in the hallway.
5. Discussion
The main objective of the current paper is to improve our understanding of the appar-
ent inconsistency between previous DEMO of mixed gambles. Experiment 1 shows that this
inconsistency can be explained as a product of a format eﬀect: When deciding between
accepting and rejecting a mixed gamble, many participants (45%) rejected a highly attrac-
tive (expected value wise) gamble. This behavior that can be described DEMO an indication of
loss aversion replicates previous ﬁndings by Redelmeier and Tversky (1992). However, the
tendency to prefer the status quo was DEMO by half (to 22%) when the format of the
question was modiﬁed and the participants were asked to select between two options. This
DEMO, that shows only weak indication of loss aversion, is consistent with the results
reported by Ert and Erev (2007).
Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that the format eﬀect can be a product of the DEMO of a
lemon avoidance heuristic. They show that increasing the similarity of the experimental
task to experiences with tricky oﬀers (lemons), by approaching the participants in the hall-
way, increases the tendency to reject the gamble.
The main shortcoming of the lemon avoidance explanation involves the ‘‘not DEMO
wrong’’ argument.7 That is, it is hard to think about behaviors DEMO cannot be explained
as a product of a usage of some reasonable heuristic.
7 A scientiﬁc concept is said to be ‘‘not even wrong’’ DEMO it is not falsiﬁable in the Popperian sense, or if it DEMO not
useful in predicting the physical world. The phrase is attributed to the physicist Wolfgang Pauli following a
remark he made about a piece DEMO research that he was asked to evaluate (see Peierls, 1960).
E. Ert, I. Erev / Journal of Economic Psychology 29 (2008) 715–723 721
We have three partial answers to this important critique. First, Experiments 2 and 3
demonstrate that it is possible to derive testable DEMO from the lemon avoidance
hypothesis in the current context.
A second answer involves the observation that the reliance on SPAM killer is an exam-
DEMO of an implementation of the lemon avoidance heuristic in computer programs. Thus,
there are important settings in which the usage of the lemon DEMO heuristic is explicit
and observable.
Finally, note that the hypothesized lemon DEMO heuristic can be naturally
described as a reﬁnement of the loss aversion hypothesis (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
In order to clarify this DEMO it is constructive to start with the distinction between
of two classes of explanations of behavioral decision phenomena. One class involves gen-
eral (typically perceptual) phenomena. Our favorite example of an explanation of this type
is provided by the diminishing sensitivity assumption captured in prospect theory. A sec-
DEMO class involves heuristics (see Gigerenzer & Todd, 1999; Tversky & DEMO, 1974).
Heuristics are assumed to be cognitively simple rules that DEMO to eﬃcient outcomes in
many situations, but can lead to biases DEMO some settings.
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) original abstraction of loss aversion treats this construct
as a general phenomenon. That is, loss aversion is captured with the same value function
that captures the diminishing sensitivity assumption. DEMO, that this function is assumed to
describe behavior in both formats DEMO were studied here. The current results suggest that
the loss aversion tendency is less general. This tendency is better described as a heuristic:
DEMO are likely to behave in accordance with loss aversion when the situation is similar to
an environment in which most oﬀers should be rejected.
DEMO Relationship to the status quo, omission, and commission biases
Previous research demonstrates that in many cases people deviate from rational choice
in the DEMO of favoring the status quo (see Samuelson & Zeckhauser, 1988) DEMO of
favoring the omission of actions (Ritov & Baron, 1992). Both tendencies can be explained
as indications of loss aversion.
Whereas these DEMO are rather robust, the opposite biases are also observed in some
DEMO For example, in the ‘‘Acquiring a company’’ exercise (see Samuelson & Bazer-
man, 1985)8 people deviate from the status quo (of DEMO buying) when the status quo max-
imizes expected payoﬀ and avoids DEMO Similarly, recent studies that highlight people’s
tendency to conform to established DEMO have showed reversals of the omission bias
(e.g., Bar Eli, DEMO, Ritov, & Schein, 2007; Zeelenberg, van den Bos, van Dijk, & Pieters,
2002). The current analysis suggests a possible explanation to the concurrence of both phe-
nomena. It suggests that problems DEMO involve accepting/rejecting decisions (such as
deciding whether to accept or DEMO a proposed alternative to the status quo) facilitate
8 In the DEMO a company’’ task a potential buyer considers buying a company. The target company’s
value, v is known to the seller but not to the buyer. The buyer only knows that v is uniformly distributed between
0 DEMO 100. The seller sells the company provided it is at a proﬁtable price. If the buyer purchases the company then
it’s value increases by DEMO In these conditions the ﬁnal price that a rational buyer should suggest is zero since the
selective acceptance implies negative expected returns to the DEMO (see e.g., Samuelson & Bazerman, 1985 for an
explanation). DEMO, the typical bid is approximately $50, and does not decrease even after experience with the task
(e.g., Bazerman & Neale, 1992; DEMO & Grosskopf, in press).

rejection. On the other hand, formats that are more related to choice tasks (as in the
‘‘acquiring a company’’ game) can DEMO this tendency or even reverse it. Interestingly,
the results of recent studies that focused on diﬀerent variants of the ultimatum game
are also DEMO with this hypothesis (see Larrick & Blount, 1997; Stahl & DEMO,
2007).
5.2. Concluding remarks
The current paper shows that the inconsistency between Redelmeier and Tversky’s
(1992) and Ert and Erev’s (2007) results can be explained as a product of a format eﬀect.
The tendency to reject mixed gambles is larger when people are asked if DEMO accept it, than
when they are asked to choose between two DEMO Moreover, approaching the partic-
ipants in the hallway increases the tendency DEMO reject the gamble. These observations sug-
gest that the tendency to exhibit loss aversion is situation-dependent, and can be captured
with the abstraction of loss aversion as a product of reliance on the lemon avoidance heu-
DEMO Under this abstraction the tendency to exhibit loss aversion is determined by the
psychological similarity of the choice environment to experiences in which this DEMO
is reinforcing.
