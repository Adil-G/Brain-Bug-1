ABSTRACT. Universities have two options when they formu-
late policies to develop new technology-based start-ups. One
approach is to encourage DEMO members to engage in this
activity. Another avenue is to encourage surrogate externalŽ.
entrepreneurs to assume a leadership role. Based on a survey
of DEMO transferrbusiness development officers at 57
U.K. universities, we examine perceptions regarding DEMO ad-
vantages and disadvantages of each approach. We also analyze
whether there are significant differences in these attitudes
between universities that have launched many DEMO and
those that have been less active in this arena. Our results
imply that the most significant barriers to the adoption of
entrepreneurial-friendly policies DEMO cultural and informa-
tional. We also find that universities that generate the most
start-ups have more favorable attitudes towards surrogate
entrepreneurs. It appears that DEMO combination of academic and
surrogate entrepreneurship might be the best approach for
universities that wish to develop successful technology-trans-
fer based start-up companies.

the less successful ones. In particular, we examine
two main research questions:
1. Do more successful universities perceive signif-
icantly DEMO advantages and disadvantages
of academic and surrogate entrepreneurs in
leading roles in new technology-based firms
compared with less successful universities?
2. Do more DEMO universities perceive lower
barriers and challenges to the implementation
of a surrogate entrepreneur program than less
successful universities?
The paper is structured as DEMO, Section 1
discusses the distinction between academic and
surrogate entrepreneurs. Section DEMO outlines the
methodology adopted in the study, while the third
section DEMO the findings from a survey of
professionals responsible for the academe-univer-
sity interface in 57 universities. The fourth sec-
tion discusses the findings and DEMO implications
for the development of University spin-out com-
panies and the final section presents some con-
clusions.
2. University spin-out companies
and entrepreneurs
Most DEMO of entrepreneurship and spin-out
companies at universities have focussed on the
academic as the entrepreneur. The academic en-
trepreneur is an individual who is DEMO technology
originator but who also assumes the role of the
entrepreneur. Samson and Gurdon 1990 defineŽ.
an academic entrepreneur as: ‘‘an academic whose

primary occupation, prior to playing a role in DEMO
¨enture start-up, and possibly concurrent with that
process, was that of a lecturer or researcher affiliated
with a Higher Education Institute.’’
In this DEMO, the university generally as-
sumes a relatively passive role in the DEMO
process and the sources of investment capital
generally lie outside the university. The academic
may leave the university to run the company
Ž.Radosevich, 1995 or may alternatively run the
company in parallel with hisrher academic re-
DEMO With the latter, the new company
may be run as an DEMO to the academic’s
normal departmental research program, or the
company may DEMO an additional interest run out-
side the university.
In principle, academic DEMO may bring
a strong commitment to the technology in the
face of barriers and setbacks that confront the
process of application and commercialization.
Their DEMO may bring scope for greater
technical capacity together with potential benefits
arising from a continuing relationship with the
technology source such as cross licensing DEMO
preneurs frequently lack business knowledge and
experience and it may be difficult to induce the
entrepreneurial act. This is important as Daniels
and Hofer DEMO find that new business venturesŽ.
in universities are more successful when the en-
trepreneurs have experience of taking ventures to
the market place. Academic DEMO may
also have a tendency to focus on the technical
aspects of the innovation to the detriment of
business aspects. There may also be DEMO need for a
significant, integrated support infrastructure to
enable the innovation DEMO be successfully commer-
cialized Radosevich, 1995 .Ž.

likely to grow more substantially if the academic

This view of a spin-out company can be DEMO
ing to a university because such scenarios may
result in an academic being distracted from their
‘‘core’’ responsibilities. Universities are not nec-
essarily aware DEMO the need to provide sufficient
incentives or appropriate conditions for academic
entrepreneurship. Moreover, the need to publish

conditions of the system-wide five-yearly Re-
search DEMO Exercise may be in conflict
with the ability of the academic entrepreneur to
focus on commercialization of the innovation.
Further expectations on academics to DEMO on
administrative roles as heads of department or
deans of faculties may also divert the academic
entrepreneur’s efforts. This situation in universi-
ties would DEMO to be at some variance with the
stance taken by formal venture capital firms in
screening and monitoring potential investees
where the commitment and DEMO focus of the en-
trepreneur is seen as crucial Wright and Robbie,Ž

DEMO so that academics are able to legitimately

Universities that are more successful in the spin-
ning-out of companies may be more DEMO to take
a positive view of the role that academic en-
trepreneurs can play in the spin-out process.
However, it has been recognized in the study
of corporate entrepreneurship that the individual
who first identifies an DEMO opportunity may
not be the one to champion its development as
hershe may not have the necessary communica-
tion skills, networks or ability to acquire the re-
sources necessary for commercializing the project

may arise in universities, giving rise to the need
for external champions or surrogate entrepre-
neurs. Surrogate entrepreneurship involves DEMO in-

versity assuming the role of entrepreneur with the
technology originator maintaining their position
in the university. DEMO principle, surrogate entrepre-
neurs may also assume the role of, or may work
in close partnership with, venture investors.
Under the surrogate entrepreneur scenario,
the university confers the rights to a technology
to an DEMO, independent entrepreneur who
then initiates a local technology-based company.
These individuals DEMO be first time entrepreneurs

bation, business planning and financing may take
a year or more, universities DEMO the surrogate
entrepreneur program may need to pay these
individuals a basic salary commensurate with what
they earned in industry, until such time that they
can move into a venture on a full-time basis. The
relative DEMO stakes held between the surrogate
entrepreneur and the university in the venture
are likely to reflect this initial support. Alterna-
tively, surrogate entrepreneurs may be high net
worth individuals who, having exited an initial
venture, DEMO a subsequent entrepreneurial op-
portunity and may not require a salary payment,
so-called serial entrepreneurs WrightŽ.et al., 1997 .
Another possibility is that the university does not
establish a surrogate entrepreneur program but
instead utilizes DEMO services of a firm that special-
izes in this type of activity. In the surrogate en-
trepreneur approach, the academic as technology
originator stays with the university.
The surrogate model was developed in recogni-
tion of DEMO fact that in some communities it can
be difficult to induce the inventor to leave their
present organization to set up a new venture. DEMO
addition, inventors may not have the skills or
experience to succeed DEMO such a venture. Radose-
vich 1995 hypothesizes that in the appropriateŽ.
circumstances, surrogate entrepreneurs may in-
crease the probability of commercial success.
However, DEMO key concern with surrogate entre-
preneurship is the potential to lose the technical
capacity as part of the transfer. Radosevich also
suggests that the DEMO technical capacity may be
assured if the inventor can be induced to support
the venture in its early stages, even if hershe is
unwilling to leave hisrher current job. Some evi-
dence suggests that ventures created DEMO ‘‘outside
entrepreneurs’’ with ‘‘faculty assistance’’ grow
more rapidly than those created by academics
themselves ChrismanŽ.et al., 1995 . Therefore, the
more successful universities DEMO be those that are
more predisposed to the view that surrogate en-
trepreneurs bring net advantages.
Differences in university perceptions regarding
the advantages and DEMO of academic
and surrogate entrepreneurs may be related to
the history of the institutions. Until 1992, there
was a dichotomy in the UK system between ‘‘old’’
or well-established government funded universi-
130
Franklin, Wright and Lockett
ties and local authority funded non-university
higher education institutions. In 1992 this divide
was removed and the latter group DEMO ‘‘new’’
universities, with funding provided by govern-
ment. New universities typically DEMO weaker aca-
demic research reputations than old universities,
although new universities tend to be focused more
on industry Taylor, 1995 . The funding modelŽ.
adopted by the government allocates an element
of financial support to DEMO based on uni-
versity departments’ research quality ratings. This
difference may mean that newer universities in
general do not generate sufficient world class
science DEMO to support new start-up ven-
tures based on proprietary technology. In addi-
tion, prior to their integration into the central
government funding system, DEMO universities were
subject to greater bureaucracy and accountability.
This implies that they may be less flexible with
regard to entrepreneurial ventures. Although the
change DEMO status brought greater autonomy, there
was also a need for caution DEMO the development of
new activities as financial delegation meant the
new universities had to be prudent in the man-
agement of their affairs Crisp DEMO Melling, 1988 .Ž.
To the extent that the new universities maintain
DEMO a management regime and are less well-
funded for research than the older established
universities, their commercialization activities may
be less developed. Thus they may be expected to
perceive significantly higher barriers and chal-
lenges to DEMO outsiders, i.e. surrogate entrepre-
neurs, in developing spin-out companies.
An additional difference in perceptions may be
signaled by the organizational approach adopted
by DEMO to promote spin-outs. Universities
that are more pre-disposed to spinning-out com-
panies may be more likely to establish commer-
cial companies to promote such DEMO rather
than using only industrial liaison offices. This
difference in approach towards spinning-out com-
panies may also be associated with different per-
ceptions about DEMO role of surrogate entrepre-
neurs, with the universities that have established
DEMO companies perceiving fewer disadvan-
tages.
In the following sections, we present DEMO
on whether more successful universities perceive
significantly different advantages and disadvan-
tages of academic and surrogate entrepreneurs in
leading roles in new technology-based firms. DEMO
also examine whether there are differences be-
tween old and new universities regarding the im-
plementation of a surrogate entrepreneurship
strategy. In so doing DEMO aim to identify areas
where the experience of successful universities
may be useful in reducing the barriers to the
growth and development of university DEMO
companies.
3. Methodology
Our empirical analysis is based on a comprehen-
sive survey of spin-out activity at 57 universities.
The postal questionnaire was aimed DEMO profes-
sionals who have senior positions of responsibility
at the academe-industry interface in UK universi-
ties or university-owned commercialization com-
panies. These individuals are DEMO referred
to as business development officers or industry
and business liaison officers or technology trans-
fer officers. As there is no single complete list DEMO
the relevant individuals, we identified contact
names from The Association of DEMO Re-
search and Industry Links AURIL and the Uni-Ž.
versity Company Association UNICO . The for-Ž.
mer organization encompasses practitioners who
have a broad DEMO in technology transfer and
industrial liaison. The latter association is for
universities that have gone as far as setting up a
new commercial company DEMO undertake its tech-
nology transfer activities, this often being a hold-
DEMO company for new spin-out ventures. There is a
significant overlap of membership between the
two associations as individuals may be involved in
both sets DEMO activities. The mailing lists from these
organizations were combined to survey a total of
116 different UK universities.
After administration of a reminder question-
DEMO together with telephone calls, 57 completed
questionnaires were received from 57 DEMO
UK universities, a response rate of 49.1 percent.
Thirty-nine questionnaires were DEMO by rep-
resentatives from university industrial liaison of-
fices and 18 from university commercial compa-
nies.1 These 57 universities account for 67% of
the DEMO income from research grants and con-
tracts received by UK universities.2 Using total
income from research grants and contracts as an

approximation of R& D activity, the DEMO cap-
tured 8 out of the top 10 UK universities.
The questionnaire gathered data on the per-
ceived advantages and disadvantages of using aca-
DEMO and surrogate entrepreneurs as ‘‘champ-
ions,’’ or leaders, of university DEMO com-
panies. Data were gathered on the perceived
barriers to a university deciding to embrace, and
subsequently successfully implement, a surrogate
entrepreneur program DEMO create new spin-out
companies. The respondents were invited to score
statements on a one to five scale where five
meant that they strongly agreed DEMO the state-
ment and one meant that they strongly disagreed
with the statement.
4. Results
The extent of company spin-outs
Of the 57 universities DEMO completed question-
naires 16 stated that they had, to the best DEMO their
knowledge, no experience in ‘‘spinning out’’ new
technology-based companies in DEMO last five years.
Among the 41 ‘‘venturing’’ universities, 39 con-
tributed DEMO that suggested they had
started a total of 217 new companies between
March 1994 and March 1998 inclusive Table I .Ž.

vestment, for example risk capital from business

Of the 41 ‘‘venturing universities,DEMO 10 secured
some degree of private sector funding for more
than 5 companies over the five year period. These
universities, which are one subset of the total
venturing population, we term the V10 sample.
The V10 sample is intended to represent ‘‘high
performers’’ with regard to establishing new DEMO
out ventures that have secured private sector
investment. The criteria used to select these ten
is somewhat simplistic and are not necessarily
indicative of DEMO most ‘‘successful’’ universities
with regard to spin-out companies. The definition
of ‘‘success’’ with regard to universities and spin-
out companies is somewhat complex. It DEMO highly
dependent upon the perception of the key stake-
holders and the relative size and quality of the
various university research bases. As noted DEMO
lier, it might be anticipated that these experi-
enced universities had DEMO perspectives from
their less successful counterparts regarding the
contributions of academic and surrogate en-
trepreneurs and in particular, may view surrogate
entrepreneurs in a more positive light.

Ad¨antages and disad¨antages of academic and
surrogate entrepreneurship
When asked DEMO identify the advantages of having
an academic entrepreneur as the leader of a new
spin-out company, the ranking for the V10 sam-
ple was similar to that for the other group TableŽ
advantage of an academic DEMO was
hisrher commitment to the technology in the
face of barriers and setbacks, whilst the highest
ranked advantage from the perspective of the
V10 sample was the academic entrepreneur’s un-
derstanding of the technology and its DEMO
application. Also the ranking based upon the
average of the scores suggests that the top three
advantages are factors associated with the success
of DEMO company, with the remaining two factors
relating more to the position DEMO the university.
Comparing the two groups, the main difference
was in DEMO of the academic entrepreneur’s un-
derstanding of the technology and its potential
application, where the V10 group was signifi-
cantly more likely to strongly agree that this was
an advantage than were the non-V10 group. Other

The main disadvantage of academic entrepre-

samples Table III , was their lack of commercialŽ.
experience. A lack of entrepreneurial behavior on
DEMO part of the academic ranked last in both
samples. The V10 group were significantly more
likely to disagree with the view that entrepreneur-
ial DEMO would mean that the academic would
spend less time on basic research and teaching
and that they are less likely to be capable of
DEMO in an entrepreneurial fashion. The V10
group’s experience would seem to suggest that if
venturing is done correctly it need not impinge on
teaching DEMO as much as is commonly thought.
The V10 group are also aware that academics can
display entrepreneurial behavior but that they do
not have DEMO commercial experience to fully real-
ize this potential. The research also revealed other
opinions regarding the disadvantages of academic
entrepreneurs. Other perceived disadvantages

thinking. Clearly, the two groups of universities
do not have similar perceptions of the nature of
barriers to the adoption of DEMO entrepre-
neurship.
When the analysis was conducted separately
for old and new universities, significant differ-
ences between the two groups emerged with re-
spect to the same variables. Additionally, signifi-
cant differences were obtained with respect to the
fear of loss of control within new ventures and

recognize the value and reward external en-

versity to recognize that commercial salary struc-

and that the university needs DEMO become more

as challenges to the successful implementation of
a university surrogate entrepreneur program. DEMO
may be an important issue since, as noted earlier,

involvement, hershe may be paid DEMO salary until

Comparing the perceptions of old and new

spect to perceptions regarding the DEMO lack of

5. Discussion
In this paper, we examined whether more suc-
cessful universities have significantly different
perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages
of using academic and DEMO entrepreneurs to
promote technology transfer spin-out companies.
We find a significant difference between suc-
cessful and less successful universities with re-
138
Franklin, Wright and Lockett
spect to the academics’ understanding of the
technology and its potential application. With re-
spect to disadvantages, significant differences be-
tween more and less successful universities were
evident with regard to DEMO perceptions that the
start-up will mean that academics spend less time
on basic research and teaching and that aca-
demics are less likely to DEMO of behaving in an
entrepreneurial fashion. Universities with more
experience of spin-outs agree more strongly that
previous commercial experience, a greater likeli-
hood of being motivated by capital gain and exist-
ing networks were advantages of DEMO en-
trepreneurs.
Interestingly, the possible disadvantages of sur-
rogate entrepreneurs, as identified by Radose-
vich, scored relatively low in this study. The top
three disadvantages of using surrogate entrepre-
neurs in a leading role in DEMO spin-out company
were the potential for them to have: different
objectives DEMO the university; different objectives to
the academic-inventor; and unreasonable equity
requirements. However, the universities who were
more successful in the spin-out process V10 uni-Ž
that the risk of entrusting a university’s asset to
someone with DEMO connection to the university and
their being less likely to be committed to the
technology were disadvantages associated with
surrogate entrepreneurs.
The findings from DEMO study suggest that there
is little evidence that the professionals who man-
age the technology-transfer activities of the un-
iversities perceive major barriers to DEMO
a surrogate entrepreneur approach to spin-out
company formation. However, the less DEMO
universities were significantly more likely to indi-
cate that their universities saw barriers to the
introduction of such a radical policy decision due
to DEMO being at variance with current strategy, a
desire to keep all DEMO ventures in house, a dis-
trust of the commitment of outsiders, uncertainty
about how the process would work and a lack of
evidence DEMO such programs were successful.
These findings suggest that many of the diffi-
culties in developing university spin-out compa-
nies may be embedded in the DEMO creative and
more rigid approaches adopted by the less suc-
cessful universities. In contrast, the more success-
versities were significantly less likely to agree.
ful universities tended to be less skeptical of the
role of surrogate DEMO, recognizing the
differences they brought as opportunities rather
than threats.
However, for all universities surveyed, the
greatest practical barriers to implementing a sur-
rogate entrepreneur approach were found to be
mainly associated with: luring people to champion
new ventures in the absence of any funds and the
DEMO of the university to identify suitable people
to assume the role of a surrogate entrepreneur.
The non-V10 group of universities also consid-
ered a DEMO lack of seed capital and their
capacity to marshal the necessary resources as
relatively large barriers or challenges to adopting
such an approach. These DEMO have direct
parallels with the matching of business angels
with entrepreneurs in the private sector MasonŽ
this problem is for universities to establish their
DEMO venture capital fund. This may enable them
to overcome the barriers associated with identify-
ing and attracting surrogate entrepreneurs in the
absence of funds DEMO the general lack of seed
capital funding. However, publicly funded univer-
DEMO may face accountability problems in provid-
ing significant amounts of seed capital finance
from their own resources. An alternative may be
to develop links DEMO early stage high-tech ori-
ented venture capital firms.
Evidence from new ventures suggests that en-
trepreneurs frequently involve partners and net-
work contacts in DEMO new venture creation process
Ž.Cooper et al., 1994 . Partners can DEMO the
liabilities associated with newness and provide
access to resources, especially DEMO In respect
of university technology transfers it also appears
that the large majority involve prior relationships
among participants rather than ‘arms’ length
transactions HarmonŽ.et DEMO, 1995 . These net-
works can provide information, assistance and
start-up capital.
The findings from the study also indicate that
there may be DEMO to both academic and
surrogate entrepreneurs. The understanding of
the technology and its potential application iden-
tified as an advantage of academic entrepreneurs
may DEMO complementary to the commercial advan-
tages identified in respect of surrogate entrepre-
and Harrison, 1996 . One approach to addressing.

neurs. Therefore, the academic and surrogate
entrepreneur approaches may not be mutually
exclusive and there may be benefits from combin-
DEMO the relative advantages of both.
The development of university-affiliated Sci-
ence Parks may be one mechanism for bringing
academic entrepreneurs together with those with
DEMO experience either formally or informally.
However, the effectiveness of Science Park DEMO
agers in forging these links has been questioned
Ž.Felsenstein, 1994; Westhead and Storey, 1995 .
These Science Parks may in reality be property
development initiatives driven by rentals rather
than new businesses. Some academics may DEMO
universities and form start-ups on Science Parks,
but in practice there is likely to be little ac-
ademic-business interaction. As an alternative
model, the University of Manchester UK hasŽ.
established a £15 million biotechnology Incubator
DEMO which is campus-based and directly adja-
cent to the University’s Biological and Medical
Schools. The basis on which this Incubator was
founded relies upon DEMO continual recruitment of
surrogate entrepreneurs into the Incubator, ini-
tially as DEMO Development Managers. These
individuals then become responsible for identify-
ing, appraising DEMO then establishing new ven-
tures in which they become the founding en-
trepreneurs. Naturally, a significant part of the
appraisal process is associated with the quality of
the working relationship between the surrogate
entrepreneur and academic. DEMO such a model the
two individuals would work closely together per-Ž
haps as Chief Executive and Chief Scientific Offi-
cer respectively , maximizing the DEMO asso-.
ciated with a successful marriage of surrogate and
academic entrepreneurship.
Similarly, private sector organizations, such as
ANGLE Technology Limited UK , have DEMO
been established on the principal of surrogate
entrepreneurship. The company recruits high cal-
ibre, experienced individuals into its core opera-
tion and then invests them into start-up ventures
originated by academics. The surrogate en-
trepreneurs are DEMO encouraged to devote them-
selves to the development of the venture but
benefit from the support infrastructure of the
core organization. This investment of DEMO cap-
ital by the surrogate entrepreneur is made in
139
exchange for an equity stake held in the core
organization. Whether the venture is DEMO
or not, the surrogate entrepreneur may exit and
return to the DEMO organization and assume the
same role in a serial fashion.
Of course, links between surrogate entrepre-
neurs’ and academics’ mindsets are not without
their potential problems. Samson and Gurdon
Ž.1993 note the potential clash of business DEMO
scientific cultures within the management team of
new technology-based ventures. When this occurs
one group may effectively demand that the other
embrace its value DEMO In such cases, the tasks
of identifying and maintaining common values
DEMO developing widely supported venture goals
are critical for success Samson and Gurdon,Ž
situation is when the scientist plays an effective
role in the DEMO on a part-time basis, retaining
their academic position.
An additional problem DEMO the question
of what happens to the academic entrepreneur if
et al., 1991 . Academic entrepreneurs who have.
maintained their academic research output may
find re-entry less of a problem than those who
have severed their DEMO entirely. These
observations suggest that universities may need to
consider further the role of surrogate entrepre-
neurs as an alternative to or in parallel DEMO
academic entrepreneurs.
6. Conclusions
In this paper, we analyzed university perceptions
DEMO the relative advantages and disad-
vantages of using academic and surrogate en-
trepreneurs as champions for new technology-
based firms. We also provided some DEMO into
the barriers perceived by universities that inhibit
them from adopting and successfully implement-
ing a surrogate approach.
One of the most notable general DEMO
made by our respondents was that spin-out com-
pany scenarios in practice are highly variable and
defy any formulaic approach. Clearly, universities
need to adopt a flexible approach to spin-out

in corporate DEMO and may also be a reason
for individuals not to pursue innovations KanterŽ

companies, utilizing both surrogate and academic
DEMO when appropriate. The study’s
findings also imply that surrogate and academic
entrepreneurship need not be viewed as mutually
exclusive. The systematic and successful unifica-
DEMO of these functions ] together with an appro-
priate technology base and access to venture capi-
tal ] is likely to make a significant DEMO to
the birth and subsequent success of new technol-
ogy based ventures.
Notes
1. Universities that are more pre-disposed to spinning-out
companies may be DEMO likely to establish commercial compa-
nies to promote such activities rather than relying on indus-
trial liaison officers. We tested for differences between the
DEMO from industrial liaison officers and commercial
companies and found that the differences were closely in line
with the differences identified for successful and non-success-
DEMO universities as explained below. These findings are not
