qualitative analysis is based on DEMO comprehensive, longitudinal data set comprising 11 years of

INTRODUCTION
Each year thousands of entrepreneurs submit their business proposals to VCs in the hope DEMO
they will receive the desired capital and access to a network that many believe will enable them to
realize their commercial and financial objectives DEMO new business creation. Given that VCs are
highly selective in their funding decisions, it is not surprising that a fairly large number of studies
seek to further our understanding of the main criteria that influence the DEMO investment decision
(e.g., Wells, 1974; MacMillan et al. 1985, DEMO; Hisrich and Jankowicz, 1990; Shepherd, 1999;
Franke et al., 2008). These studies indicate that in their selection of deals, DEMO emphasize various
criteria such as the market growth and size, the DEMO and competitive insulation of the
product offering, and the expected rate DEMO return of the venture project (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1981;
MacMillan et al., 1985). Research has also consistently shown that amongst the set of evaluation
criteria, VCs tend to place the highest importance on criteria related to the management team (e.g.,
Wells, 1974; Zopounidis, 1994; Muzyka et al., 1996; Shepherd, 1999).
Yet, DEMO the progress that has been made in understanding VC decision making, DEMO close
examination of the extant literature reveals that prior studies have been curiously one-sided, as
they focus on the criteria VCs apply when accepting deals and not when rejecting deal proposals.
Given the complexity and uncertainty DEMO in VC decision making and the lack of prior
empirical evidence, DEMO would be premature to assume that the criteria used to accept proposals, or
significance of the same, will correspond to those criteria that DEMO use to disqualify or reject a
deal. Arguably, the emphasis on DEMO criteria has been encouraged by researchers’ strong
interest in better understanding the success of new ventures and not their failure, and also a lack of
data on failed venture deals in VC decision making (Barry, DEMO). However, when considering
that about 97-99% of all submitted business DEMO will get rejected by a VC (Hall, 1989), it is
quite dissatisfying that we possess hardly any knowledge on deal rejection criteria.

However, there is yet another major shortcoming in extant research, as DEMO investigating
VC decision-making criteria tend to be agnostic to firm-specific factors which are likely to
influence the decision-making process and criteria over the lifetime DEMO a VC fund. For example,
VCs may have less time to engage in deal selection in later lifecycle stages of their fund, as they
will spend more time on monitoring and assisting portfolio firms (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989).
Once again, this lack of research incorporating DEMO factors may be, in part, due to limited
availability of data, but is also the result of the cross sectional nature of the majority of research on
VC decision making.
Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it seeks to increase our
understanding of what VCs consider to be “knock-out criteria” (Franke et al., DEMO) during the
decision-making process, and secondly, it attempts to highlight DEMO factors inherent to
the decision-making process that are outside the realm of the entrepreneur’s influence, or even
awareness, and to date have gone DEMO unidentified. To shed light on these key issues, we
adopted an DEMO case study research design which is recommended for investigating
phenomena that are subtle and/or hardly understood. Specifically, our qualitative analysis is based
on a comprehensive, self-collected longitudinal data set spanning 11 years of archival data, which
included a total of 3,631 deal proposals, from a DEMO VC firm.
Next, we review prior studies on VC decision making DEMO point out key open questions in this
field of research. We then provide an overview of the research design used in this study and
DEMO our key findings. The paper concludes with some theoretical as well as practical
implications of our results and we highlight areas for future research.
DEMO ON VC DECISION MAKING
The VC decision-making process and the criteria used to evaluate potential deals continue to
interest researchers after more than forty DEMO While the early literature primarily sought to
develop lists of factors deemed important by VCs (e.g., Hoban, 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984a;
MacMillan et al., 1985, 1987; Khan, 1987), a DEMO stream of research further differentiated the
screening, evaluation and due diligence DEMO and developed models of the decision-making
process (e.g., Wells, 1974; Hall, 1989; Fried and Hisrich, 1994). Most recently, the DEMO of the
research agenda has returned to the decision-making criteria and has centered on the use of
decision aids (Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000; Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2001, 2005) as well as a
deeper understanding of how VCs judge the more subjective, albeit important, criteria associated
DEMO entrepreneurial teams (Franke et al., 2006, 2008). Table 1 DEMO an overview of prior
research into VC decision making.
The decision-making criteria reported to be important in the evaluation process by VCs have
consistently DEMO the characteristics of (i) the company’s management team, (ii) DEMO market, (iii)
the product or service, and (iv) DEMO venture’s financial potential (Riquelme and Rickards, 1992;
Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000; Franke et al., 2008). Each of these broad categories of criteria have
been further broken down into several more specific factors DEMO have been used by the majority
of researchers over the past forty years.
One defining characteristic of this stream of research is the preoccupation DEMO the VC’s
assessment of the management team (Muzyka et al., 1996). For example, Franke et al. (2008)
applied conjoint analysis DEMO arrive at a more detailed understanding of VCs’ evaluations of
management teams. They found that VCs prefer investing in teams in which all members DEMO
industry experience, which can draw on a mixed educational background in DEMO of engineering

and management expertise, whose members have known each other for a longer time
professionally, and are relatively more mature (aged 35 DEMO 45). In terms of the venture’s target
market, the prior DEMO indicates that VCs tend to prefer market opportunities of considerable
size and with high growth rates, as these market characteristics provide the conditions for strong
revenue growth and high levels of value creation (e.g., Tyebjee DEMO Bruno, 1981; Bachher and
Guild, 1996). With regard to DEMO venture’s product offering, prior research shows that VCs apply
evaluation criteria DEMO as the innovativeness of the offering, its competitive advantage, some
proprietary protection of the product, and the level of need a potential customer has for the
offering (e.g., ‘must-have’ vs. ‘nice-to-have’ product) (e.g., Wells, 1974; Khan, 1987). Finally, in
terms of the DEMO financial potential, the extant literature highlights the importance of criteria
such DEMO the expected rate of return and the expected risk associated with these returns (MacMillan
et al., 1985). While the financial potential of DEMO venture is determined to a considerable extent by
management-, market- and DEMO characteristics, evaluation criteria pertaining to the
financial prospects are nonetheless of DEMO importance in the VC decision-making process, as a
VC firm needs DEMO assess whether the business proposal has the potential to generate the required
minimum level of returns (Gompers and Lerner, 1999). For example, in return for financing an
early-stage venture, VCs typically expect a “10 in 5”, i.e., VCs look for a tenfold increase in
investment DEMO over a five-year time horizon, equaling an annual compound interest of DEMO
(Zider, 1998). While extant research provides a rich set of insights into VC decision making (cf.
Table 1), there are several larger issues that remain unaddressed in the literature.
(1) Deal Acceptance DEMO vs. Deal Rejection Criteria. With very few exceptions
(MacMillan et al., 1985; 1987; Bruno and Tyebjee, 1986) extant research has focused DEMO
identifying the most important decision criteria that VCs apply when accepting deal proposals
(Hoffman, 1972; Wells, 1974; Khan, 1987; Hall, DEMO; Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Muzyka et al.,
1996). DEMO, most existing studies implicitly assume that these criteria also reflect the DEMO
as to why business proposals get rejected. This is, however, a fairly bold assumption – the criteria
considered important for deal acceptance may, or may not, be the same criteria that lead to deal
rejection. Because VC decision making is characterized by an inordinate percentage of rejections
(remember that VCs typically reject 97 - 99% of all submitted business DEMO), it is key for
research on VC decision making to develop a better understanding of the reasons for deal
rejection. In turn, such knowledge could also help entrepreneurs in developing and formulating
more compelling business DEMO, and VCs in improving their (limited) understanding of their own
DEMO process (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998).
(2) Firm-specific Factors influencing VC Decision Making. Current research provides insights
into the criteria VCs use DEMO their ‘funding decisions’. This general perspective is at the same time a
strength and a weakness, the former because of the (assumed) broad applicability of research
insights, the latter because the generality of current findings also means a corresponding lack of
specificity. Other scholars have made similar DEMO (Sandberg et al., 1988; Muzyka et al., 1996;
Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999), and have suggested various valuable ways of developing more
specific insights. For example, Franke et al. (2008) provide fairly detailed results by focusing on
the evaluation of the management team. However, one important critique – namely that the current
literature on VC decision DEMO is largely agnostic to VC-specific factors which are likely to
influence the importance of particular decision-making criteria – has not been answered to date.
DEMO example, it seems that the availability of time that can be DEMO to deal screening and
selection may vary greatly throughout the life of a fund, because many VC firms are taking an
active role in portfolio companies. In fact, empirical evidence indicates that VCs spend as much as
60% of their time on monitoring and assisting portfolio firms (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989).
Hence, the actual procedures in use for DEMO evaluation may be quite different between the early
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2009

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 29 [2009], Iss. 3, Art. 1
period of a fund and the subsequent portfolio monitoring and management phase. DEMO of the key
reasons as to why we hardly possess any knowledge about the influence of these VC-specific
factors in VC decision making is DEMO practically all of the published studies are cross-sectional
and focus on the VC decision-making process in and of itself. They thus fail to capture DEMO
making at different lifecycle stages of a fund, or, in the event that the VC is managing multiple
funds, across the life of a VC firm.
These observations served as departure points for the present DEMO Specifically, we set out to
investigate three interrelated research questions that DEMO allow us to arrive at a more complete
understanding of the VC decision-making process:
1. What evaluation criteria are identified as important when DEMO a business proposal?
2. Are these criteria consistently cited over the entire lifecycle of a venture fund?
3. Which additional firm-specific factors DEMO the VC decision-making process?
DATA & METHOD
Deal rejection in VC decision-making and the dynamics of the VC decision-making process
over the life DEMO a venture fund are poorly understood research topics. To answer the research
questions outlined above, we thus chose an exploratory research design (a DEMO case study)
which is recommended for investigating phenomena that are subtle and/or hardly understood
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Strauss and Corbin, 1998; Yin, 2003). Exploratory case study research designs
have been usefully employed in a number of studies in entrepreneurship (e.g., Lichtenstein et al.,DEMO
2006). In particular, this type of research design permits a DEMO understanding of the
phenomena in question, which is of great importance DEMO developing new knowledge on complex
and dynamic phenomena such as VC decision-making over the lifetime of a venture fund (Fried
and Hisrich, 1988)DEMO As this study seeks to explore the factors affecting the VC decision-making
process over the life of a fund, the use of archival data analysis is preferred over an interview
approach because it allows for the DEMO and analysis of the different criteria and their
respective frequencies over several time periods (in our case, a total of 11 years). DEMO approach
also provides access to the records showing what the subject of the study actually did or decided at
the time of the event DEMO than asking them to recall a distant, often non-significant event, and
thus helps enhance the validity of the data over that often associated DEMO self-reported techniques
(Hall and Hofer, 1993; Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999).
Study Setting
This study uses archival data from a European VC DEMO, unknown to the researchers prior to
the study, which has multiple offices in Europe. The firm is focused on investing in seed-, early-
and late-stage companies from around the world within a specific high-tech, high growth industry.
Despite its financial success and the ability to attract limited DEMO for more than one fund – a
common occurrence in successful funds –, the firm remains relatively small, with fewer than ten
VCs, their support staff, and the original founders still active in the day-to-day operations of the
firm. The team is comprised of people from four DEMO countries with each of the VCs in the
firm holding a graduate degree and at least five years of relevant industry experience. At the DEMO
of data collection the firm had made a total of 35 portfolio investments, some of which had
received subsequent funding via both internal rounds and new financing rounds, across the two
funds. The average acceptance rate of deals submitted to the firm over the entire period was 1%,DEMO
which is consistent with the industry averages reported in many other studies. All of the
investments had been syndicated with other VC firms based DEMO Europe and/or North America and

the firm under study had acted as both the lead DEMO co-investor, the roles divided almost equally
across the portfolios. In the DEMO, we will use the term “firm” to describe the VC firm,DEMO
whereas the terms “company”, “deal”, and “proposal” all apply to the entrepreneurial ventures
evaluated by the VC.
Data Collection Procedure
The data collected DEMO an 11-year period and includes information on deals that were
submitted to the firm during the life of two venture funds. Although the funds DEMO in time,
the origination and screening phases of Fund II were not initiated until after the final investment in
Fund I had been DEMO and officially announced to the limited partners. However, the same
team DEMO VCs was responsible for all of the activities related to both funds, so while the investment
decision-making process had been completed in Fund I, they were still involved in the monitoring,
assistance and cashing-out activities while managing the origination, screening and evaluation
activities related to Fund II.
The data set was created by first reading emails and memos, both electronic and written, in the
archived deal files as well as all of the entries in the firm’s deal flow data base (“action log”)
which contained 7,284 passages of text. The primary source of DEMO was the firm’s action log that
the firm uses to track the progress, comments, and ultimate disposition of a potential deal
throughout the DEMO process. Although the materials received from prospective companies
varied considerably in detail and length (ranging from short introductory emails and one-page
“teasers” to 176-page business plans) the VCs provided approximately the same amount of
information regarding their initial assessment of each deal filed as “Dead”; the term “DEAD” as
opposed to rejected was a term that the firm consistently used DEMO categorize deals that had been
reviewed and, based upon reasons started, were no longer active in the deal flow process. In total,
DEMO firm had received 3,631 deal proposals over the 11 years.
Data Analysis Procedure
The data was analyzed using qualitative methods (Locke, 2001; Roberts, 1997) which involved
an interpretative approach to the documents containing DEMO related to the VC’s views and
decisions of the deals they had reviewed. Those comments representing the firm’s view or reasons,
both explicit DEMO implied, for categorizing the deals as “Dead” were collected along with
DEMO pertaining to the stage of the deal, the geographic region where DEMO company was
domiciled, the referral source of the deal, the date the deal was first received by the VC, and the
date of the final disposition. While it was neither possible nor realistic to observe DEMO firm over the
life of a fund, typically ten years (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989), having access to all of the internal
records and information related to each deal over the entire life of the DEMO firm facilitated the
development of a “practical understanding” (Miles and Huberman, 1994, p. 8) of the firm’s deal
screening and evaluation process DEMO well as the evaluation criteria used by the firm.
Given that previous research on VC decision making had focused predominantly on positive
investment decisions, the initial review of the data was not approached with an a DEMO list of
specific criteria; however, an initial framework of broad categories, or preliminary codes, based
upon the existing literature was developed. However, these categories only served as a basis for
the iterative coding process DEMO involved going back and forth between the data and the
emergent categories, similar to the constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967,
Strauss and Corbin, 1998). The text was examined line by line and data specified categories
(Locke, 2001, p. 67) were assigned. DEMO open coding (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) process, and the

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 29 [2009], Iss. 3, Art. 1
creation of categories and the subsequent division, combination, or abolishment of DEMO same, used
throughout the initial coding procedure was maintained in successive DEMO of the text. The
final coding scheme with the list of categories and codes is presented in Table 2.
Great care was taken in DEMO the reliability of the coding. Once the hierarchical coding
scheme was developed, a random sample of excerpts from the data set was coded by a second
person not involved in the study, but who had been trained in the coding scheme. The interrater
agreement between the two raters DEMO checked by computing Cohen’s Unweighted Kappa (Cohen,
1960). The DEMO for Kappa ranges between 0 and 1, where K = 0 DEMO no agreement between
the raters and K = 1 indicates perfect agreement between the raters. Although there is no definitve
value deemed as an DEMO level of reliability, a Cohen’s Kappa above .80 is generally
considered DEMO demonstrate high interrater reliability (Landis and Koch, 1977). Having established
a high level of reliability (K= .91), all of text in the data set was coded.
FINDINGS
Our qualitative, longitudinal exploration of the VC decision-making process uncovered several
novel findings. We first report some of DEMO more general results that provide background
information on key characteristics of the decision-making process in the examined VC firm. We
then focus on the DEMO applied in deal rejection, and report how the fund lifecycle and DEMO VC-
specific factors influence the VC decision-making process.
The decision-making process observed in this VC firm largely resembles the process
previously described in the DEMO in that all of the deals received by the firm are subjected to an
initial screening with those deals considered potentially interesting being evaluated DEMO and,
finally, more extensive due diligence is carried out on DEMO minority of deals that are deemed
potentially viable based upon a number of factors. VCs at this firm estimated that about 20% of
business DEMO made it past the screening phase, and about 10% received a DEMO
investment recommendation, that is, an internal document sent by the “sponsoring” individual to
the investment committee. These numbers also correspond to those frequently DEMO in the
literature on VC decision making (e.g., Roberts, 1991), suggesting the importance of research on
the criteria used for deal rejection.
Given that almost all prior studies investigated the criteria leading to deal DEMO, we were
particularly interested in better understanding the rejection of deal DEMO by VCs.
Deal rejection criteria. The main categories of criteria identified by researchers as being
important to VCs when accepting deal proposals for financing DEMO also evident in the reasons
stated for rejecting a deal. Several interesting results stand out in Figure 1, which provides an
overview of the reasons for rejection organized by fund year. First, we see that the typically
referenced reasons for deal acceptance (e.g. product, market, finance) DEMO feature in the reasons
for deal rejection. Second, analyzing the trend DEMO time reveals that VC fund-related reasons gain
in importance over the lifetime of a fund. Third, the one finding that at first appears counter to the
majority of previous research is the frequency of comments related DEMO the characteristics of the
management team (n=93). The reasons stated (e.g., “Lack of confidence in management”, “Lack
of management team experience”, “Need of restructuring board and exchange CEO”) by the VCs
do reflect the criteria reported in previous studies. However, the frequencies are substantially
lower than one might expect given the high importance attributed to the management DEMO in
previous research (Bruno and Tyebjee, 1985; Khan, 1986; DEMO, 1987; Wells, 1974). This
seems to be a result DEMO prior research being primarily interested in the factors related to deal

DEMO
Petty and Gruber: THIS DEAL IS DEAD! A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF VC DECISION MAKING
acceptance, whereas our study captures the reasons for rejection that precede a VC’s final
decision. The few cases in the dataset may DEMO represent those where the management team is
an obvious disqualifier such as “CEO does not have the best reputation” and therefore is
considered a DEMO criterion.
Lost opportunities in the deal flow. Perhaps one of the most unexpected and instructive
findings regarding the deal flow is that although this DEMO firm, like most others, had only invested
in roughly 1% of the deals reviewed, the remaining 99% classified as Dead had not all been
rejected by the firm. Rather, a relatively large share of all received deal proposals – about 10% of
the 3,631 deals – DEMO classified as Dead because the VC firm no longer had the opportunity to
pursue them. There were many reasons for these lost opportunities, but the majority of these cases
were simply because the respective companies failed DEMO respond to the request for additional data.
Despite the VC’s efforts to receive more information and maintain a dialogue with these
companies, a surprisingly large number (n=192, or 5%) never responded to the VC. The following
quotes from the action log illustrate this point: “No response to request for more detailed revised
business plan.”, “DEAD no information received as requested”, “No response since sending out
confidentiality agreement”, “'Interesting but DEMO company”.
It is important to note that all of these deals had been sent to the VC firm unsolicited and the
firm waited almost DEMO a year, often sending additional requests in the interim, before categorizing
the deal proposals as Dead. Without contacting these companies, it is not possible to know exactly
why they failed to respond to the VC’s DEMO of potential interest, but judging from the comments
regarding other deals DEMO did not go forward, a few potential reasons for non-response could DEMO (i)
the requested information was unavailable or too difficult for DEMO company to compile, (ii) the
company received funding from another DEMO, (iii) the company went bankrupt in the meantime,
or (iv) that the company’s management had changed their mind regarding the raising of external
funding in general.
The remaining 5% of the deals that DEMO “lost” by the firm can be attributed to decisions made
by the company with respect to VC funding in general or, in some cases, specifically related to the
VC firm in the study: “Dead Company DEMO to go with alternative VC deal.”, “Management
not ready for VC.”, “Company unwilling to accept certain Term Sheet conditions.” “Company
decided against a DEMO closing due to oversubscription, therefore no slot   available for us. DEMO
in contact for future rounds.”, “Finance discussions with unknown competitors. Company DEMO
come back. No  response (after 3 months).”
However, unlike DEMO previous sub-group of lost opportunities that failed to respond during the
initial screening and evaluation phase, this second sub-group of companies had progressed through
the evaluation phase and was often in the due diligence process, or even in the final stage of
investment consideration. This distinction is important DEMO it implies that the VC had already
expressed a genuine interest in the deal. The VC had also expended a substantial investment of
time DEMO financial resources in their pursuit of these opportunities, most of which DEMO be simply
expensed and considered a sunk cost.
Open-door rejection. Throughout the data set there were comments that showed that “no” in
the VC DEMO is not always a definitive rejection. Although the overwhelming majority of deals
rejected by the VC were given no indication of any potential future DEMO, there were comments
in both the internal records and the letters DEMO rejection to companies that provided evidence of the
VC’s willingness to reconsider the deal at a later time. The reasons for this future potential
DEMO both company-specific issues as well as ones related to the VC firm or the specific VC

fund. In instances when the VC firm saw potential promise in a DEMO, they not only told the
company why the deal was being DEMO, but also provided very specific feedback with respect to
the firm’s DEMO, when the company should resubmit, and any necessary milestones to be
achieved in order for the firm to pursue a subsequent evaluation. The DEMO log provides several
interesting illustrations of this issue: “Interesting concept but DEMO early stage,…should come back
in second round”, “Proof-of-concept in maybe DEMO 9 months, company shall come back then.”
“Too early but candidate DEMO next fund”, “Does not really fit our portfolio at the time, but stay in
touch”. However, even though the firm had “left the door open” with many deals (n=146), there
were only 22 instances where these companies submitted their proposals to the firm a second or
DEMO time; one of which was ultimately accepted as portfolio deal. This DEMO response rate, much
like the “no response” rate, may be due to a variety of factors not related to the VC firm’s
comments DEMO request and can only be captured through contacting the companies directly. This
finding, while new to the literature, is not altogether remarkable when DEMO considers the difficulty
and time requirements associated with sourcing quality deal flow (Gifford, 1997), the potential
need to identify complementary skills or DEMO to help existing portfolio companies, and the
value of access to DEMO about emerging companies and or technologies.
We now discuss our findings from a longitudinal perspective. In addition to those firm-specific
factors related to the DEMO firm strategy and deal characteristics that have been identified in past
research (Wells, 1974; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984a, 1984b; Hall, 1989), there are also factors that
appear to be a result of DEMO characteristics and, in particular, the lifecycle of the VC fund, DEMO thus
are only likely to be captured in longitudinal or ethnographic studies.
The effect of time. Although some of the findings reported above are DEMO related to process
or timing issues, their potential impact on the DEMO process is not fully appreciated
unless they are viewed collectively over the entire timeline of the firm (See Figure 1).
Several observations seem to be particularly noteworthy. First, we see that across the lifecycle
of an investment fund, there is quite some fluctuation in the primary criteria applied to reject deals.
This is an important finding, as it highlights the dynamics of the VC decision-making process over
time. Second, we see an intriguing increase of the fund-related reasons over the years indicating
that DEMO are factors within the VC firm that become more important in decision making over
time. Importantly, these types of reasons have been neglected in prior research on VC decision-
making criteria, which can be seen as a major shortcoming because fund-related reasons are the
primary rejection criteria in DEMO final years of our observation period (Years 9, 10 and 11). We will
look more closely at one key driving force for DEMO result – portfolio composition – below. Third,
we see a rise and fall of the market- and product-related reasons which may be attributable DEMO
factors outside of the firm such as increased interest in a particular industry or market that fuels
entrepreneurial activity and a subsequent increase in DEMO submission of lower quality business
proposals. Fourth, we now see in DEMO more detailed manner that evaluation criteria related to the
management team feature least prominently in deal rejection. Although the logged rejection
criteria are also DEMO function of the VC’s deal flow, this result is nonetheless puzzling. DEMO notably,
as noted above this results runs counter to one’s intuition, because one would expect that team-
related criteria feature much more prominently given that the management team has consistently
been ranked as the most DEMO evaluation criterion when it comes to deal acceptance.
VC management time. Although the number is quite small (n=66), there were times when the
firm simply did not have the management capacity within the team to DEMO pursue a
potential deal, even when the deal was acknowledged to DEMO potentially viable. The firm noted in its
action log: “Interesting but DEMO constraints due to other due diligence.”, “Too busy with other

four own closings to participate.”, DEMO at the moment due to our Deal Flow.”
Resubmissions over time. Prior research suggests that once a deal is rejected by a VC, there is
no chance that this particular VC will review the deal again, let alone provide funding for it. While
we already noted that there DEMO 146 open door rejections, our longitudinal data allows us to track
DEMO rejected deal proposals that did not receive an invitation to resubmit actually were
submitted to the VC firm again after some time. Table 3 DEMO the number of times the VC
firm had received a deal. Two observations are particularly interesting:  First, we see that there
were an astoundingly high number of 438 proposals that were submitted to the firm DEMO than
once. Only 22 of these deal proposals had been invited for resubmission as per the VC firm’s
feedback (see section on “Open door rejection”). Second, the VC firm invested in approximately
the same share of these resubmitted deals as in the original deals (1% in the second submission
attempt, and 2% in the third submission attempt), despite having already rejected the deals once;
the one exception being the DEMO fourth submission (7% acceptance rate) but that is due to
the deal being one of only 14 proposals sent four times.
CONCLUSIONS
This DEMO is based upon the actions and decisions of VCs operating within their normal
context and therefore captures what was actually done at the time DEMO the real decision rather than
what is reported in response to a survey or interview about past deals. This difference alone may
explain why, despite the fact that many of the criteria cited as the reasons DEMO the Dead deals are
consistent with those identified in previous research, DEMO operational demands on the VC
management team’s time and the profile of portfolio companies within the fund appear to impact
the decisions made by DEMO VCs more so than in previous studies.
When viewed from the perspective of rejection, the impact of firm-specific, VC-specific factors
appears to be DEMO pronounced than previously considered, and the conceptualization of VC
decision making DEMO to be more dynamic when one considers the effects of time. Also, in
order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of VC decision making, more attention
should be given to these Dead deals. VCs are assumed by many to be expert decision makers and
VC firms are commonly DEMO by the performance of their portfolios, which only represents one
percent DEMO the deals reviewed, with little to no consideration for the other DEMO that were not
selected. That said, this study reveals that not DEMO dead deals are the result of rejection by the VC,
so researchers should be wary when collecting and interpreting data related to deal
DEMO/rejection rates.
Based upon this research the most important, yet basic, advice to entrepreneurs is to maintain
communication with the VC if they DEMO expressed interest in the deal. It is all too easy for a VC
to tell a company that their proposal does not meet the DEMO of the firm, so when a VC takes the
time to DEMO information or provide feedback and encourages someone to come back, it DEMO a sign
that your deal is still being considered. Along similar lines, it seems that VCs should reevaluate
their practices regarding the deals they have rejected. Because the market for quality deals is
highly competitive, VCs should seek to strengthen their relationships with companies they believe
are potential DEMO for future funding. Entrepreneurs should also spend time learning about
the firms they send their proposals to in order to tailor their documents to DEMO current phase of the
fund and/or requirements of each firm. Two firms with similar investment strategies may view the
same proposal quite differently DEMO by virtue of the fact that they are focused on different
criteria based upon the lifecycle phase each firm is in at the time. DEMO, our findings also suggest

that VC firms should evaluate their existing management capacity and develop strategies DEMO
accommodate for times when they experience increased deal flow, above average DEMO diligence
activity or number of deal closings.
While this study provides additional insights into the decision-making process, many questions
still remain unanswered. For example, much research has been conducted on the evaluation of the
entrepreneurial team and the relevance of this evaluation, but the biases similar to those reported
in Franke et al. (2006) may very well influence the DEMO of factors related to the other key
criteria, namely the product DEMO industry. Additionally, how does the participation in syndicates
bias the evaluation DEMO selection process? Guler (2007) showed that reinvestment decisions are
influenced DEMO the politics of the industry so it is highly likely that this institutional process also
influences initial investments as well.
