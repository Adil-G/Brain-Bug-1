Substituting into Equation

RF).
(13)
Equation (13) DEMO the Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM), an extremely important theoretical
DEMO It says that the expected return on a port-
folio should exceed the riskless rate of return by an
amount which is proportional to DEMO portfolio beta.
That is, the relationship between return and risk
should DEMO linear.
The model is often stated in "risk-premium"
form. Risk DEMO are obtained by subtracting
the risk-free rate from the rates of return. The ex-
pected portfolio and market risk premiums
(designated E(rp) DEMO E(rm) respectively) are given
by
E(rp) = E(DEMO) - RF,
(14a)
E(rm) = E(RM) - RF. (14b)
Substituting these risk premiums into Equation
(13), we obtain
E(rp) = 8 p * E(rm) (DEMO)
In this form, the CAPM states that the expected
risk DEMO for the investor's portfolio is equal to
its beta value times the expected market risk
premium.
We can illustrate the model by assuming DEMO
short-term (risk-free) interest rate is 6 per cent and
the expected return on the market is 10 per cent.
The expected risk premium DEMO holding the market
portfolio is just the difference between the 10 per
cent and the short-term interest rate of 6 per cent,
or DEMO per cent. Investors who hold the market port-
folio expect to earn 10 per cent, which is 4 per
cent greater than they could earn on a short.term
market instrument for certain. In order to satisfy
DEMO (1 3), the expected return on securities or
portfolios with DEMO levels of risk must be:
Expected Return for Different Levels of Portfolio Beta
Beta
Expected Return
0.0
0.5
6%
8%
1.0
10%
1.5 DEMO
2.0 14%
The predictions of the model are inherently sen-
sible. For safe investments (/3 = 0), the model
predicts that investors DEMO expect to earn the
risk-free rate of interest. For a risky investment (,8

> 0) investors would expect a rate of return pro-
portional to the market DEMO (,8) of the in-
vestment. Thus, stocks with lower than average
market sensitivities (such as most utilities) would
offer expected returns DEMO than the expected
market return. Stocks with above average values of
beta (such as most airline securities) would offer
expected returns in excess DEMO the market.
In our development of CAPM we have made a
number of assumptions that are required if the
model is to be established DEMO a rigorous basis.
These assumptions involve investor behavior and
conditions in the capital markets. The following is
a set of assumptions that will allow DEMO simple
derivation of the model.
(a) The market is composed of risk-averse investors
who measure risk in terms of standard deviation of
portfolio DEMO This assumption provides a basis
for the use of beta-type risk measures.
(b) All investors have a common time horizon for in-
vestment DEMO making (e.g., one month, one
year, etc.). This assumption allows us to measure in-
vestor expectations over some common interval,
DEMO making comparisons meaningful.
(c) All investors are assumed to have the same ex-
pectations about future security returns and risks.
Without this assumption, the analysis would become
much more complicated.
(d) Capital markets are DEMO in the sense that all
assets are completely divisible, there are DEMO trans-
actions costs or differential taxes, and borrowing
and lending rates DEMO equal to each other and the
same for all investors. Without these conditions,
frictional barriers would exist to the equilibrium
conditions on which DEMO model is based.
While these assumptions are sufficient to derive
the model, it is not clear that all are necessary in
their current form. It may well be that several of
the assumptions can be substantially DEMO
without major change in the form of the model. A
good deal of research is currently being conducted
toward this end.
While the CAPM DEMO indeed simple and elegant,
these qualities do not in themselves guarantee that
it will be useful in explaining observed risk-return
patterns. In Section DEMO we will review the empirical
literature on attempts to verify the model.
7. Measurement of Security
and Portfolio Beta Values
The basic data for DEMO betas are past rates of
return earned over a series of relatively short in-
tervals-usually days, weeks, or months. For
example, in Tables 3 and 4 we present calculations

based on month-by-month rates of return for the
periods January 1945 to June 1970 (security betas)
and January 1960 to December 1971 (mutual fund
betas). The returns were calculated using Equation
(DEMO a).
It is customary to convert the observed rates of
return to risk premiums. Section 6 showed that risk
premiums are obtained by DEMO the rates of
return that could have been achieved by investing
in short-maturity risk-free assets, such as treasury
bills or prime commercial paper. This removes a
source of "noise" from the data. The noise stems
DEMO the fact that observed returns may be higher
in some years simply because risk-free rates of in-
terest are higher. Thus, an observed rate of return
of eight per cent might be regarded as satisfactory
if DEMO occurred in 1960, but as a relatively low rate
of return DEMO interest rates were at all-time highs

Exhibit 9 shows the plot of the monthly risk
premiums on the DEMO portfolio against the
NYSE index for the same 1945-1970 period. As in
the case of National Department Stores, the best-
fit line has been put through the points using
regression analysis. The slope of the line (A&) is
equal to 1.10, with a standard error of 0.03. Note
the substantial reduction in the standard error term
compared to the DEMO examples. The estimated
alpha is 0.14, with a standard error of DEMO Again,
we cannot conclude that the true alpha is different
from zero. Note that the points group much closer
to the line than DEMO the National Department Store
plot. This results, of course, from the fact that
much of the unsystematic risk causing the points to
be DEMO around the regression line in Exhibit 8
has been elimated. The reduction is evidenced by
the R2 measure of 0.87 (versus 0.27 for National
Department Stores). Thus the market explains

Table 5 gives regression results for DEMO sample of
49 mutual funds. The calculations are based on
monthly risk premiums for the period January
1960 to December 1971. The market is DEMO
sented by the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index.
Average values and standard deviations for the 49
funds in the sample are shown DEMO the last two rows
of the table. The average beta value for the group
is 0.93-indicating, on the average, that the funds
were DEMO risky than the market index. Note the
relatively low beta values of the balanced and bond
funds, in particular the Keystone B1, B2, and B4
bond funds. This result is due to the low systematic
DEMO of the bond portfolios.
Up to this point we have shown that it is a
relatively easy matter to estimate beta values for
stocks, portfolios, and mutual funds. Now, if the

beta values are to be useful for investment decision
making, they must be predictable. Beta values
based on historical data should provide con-
siderable DEMO about future beta values if
past measures are to be useful. How predictable
are the betas estimated for stocks, portfolios of
stocks, and DEMO funds? Fortunately, we have
empirical evidence at each level.
Robert A. Levy [ 1 3 ] * has conducted tests of the
short-run DEMO (also referred to as
stationarity) of beta coefficients for securities and
unmanaged portfolios of securities. Levy's results
are based on weekly returns DEMO 500 NYSE stocks
for the period December 30, 1960 through Decem-
DEMO 18, 1970 (520 weeks). Betas were developed
for each security for ten non-overlapping 52-week
periods. To measure stationarity, Levy correlated

the 500 security betas from each 52-week DEMO
(the historical betas) with the 52-week betas in the
following period (the future betas). Thus nine cor-
relation studies were performed for the ten periods.
To compare the stationarity of security and
portfolio betas, Levy constructed portfolios of 5,
10, 25, and 50 securities DEMO repeated the same
correlation analysis for the historical portfolio
betas and future beta values for the same portfolios
in the subsequent period. The portfolios DEMO con-
structed by ranking security betas in each period
and partitioning the list into portfolios containing
5, 10, 25 and 50 securities. Each DEMO con-
tained an equal investment in each security.
The results of Levy's 52-week correlation studies
are presented in Table 5. The average values DEMO the
correlation coefficients from the nine trials were
0.486, 0.769, 0.853, 0.939, and 0.972 for port-
folios of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 stocks, respectively.

Correspondingly, the average percentages of the
variation in future betas explained by the historical
betas are 23.6, 59.1, 72.8, 88.2, and 94.5.
DEMO results show the beta coefficients to be very
predictable for large portfolios and progressively
less predictable for smaller portfolios and in-
dividual securities. These DEMO are not af-
fected by changes in market performance. Of the
nine correlation studies, five covered forecast
periods during which the market performance was
the reverse of the preceding period (61-62, 62-63,
65-66, 66-67, and 68-69). Notably, the betas were
approximately as predictable over DEMO five rever-
sal periods as over the remaining four intervals.5
The question of the stability of mutual fund beta
values is more complicated. Even DEMO, as seen above,
the betas of large unmanaged portfolios are DEMO
predictable, there is no a priori need for mutual
fund betas DEMO be comparatively stable. Indeed, the
betas of mutual fund portfolios may DEMO sub-
stantially over time by design. For example, a port-
folio DEMO may tend to reduce the risk exposure
of his fund prior to an expected market decline and
raise it prior to an expected market DEMO
However, the range of possible values for beta will
tend to DEMO restricted, at least in the longer run, by
the fund's investment objective. Thus while one
does not expect the same standard of DEMO
as for large unmanaged portfolios, it may never-
theless be interesting DEMO examine the extent to
which fund betas are predictable.
Pogue and Conway [21] have conducted tests
for a sample of 90 mutual funds. The DEMO values
for the period January 1969 through May 1970
were correlated with values from the subsequent
period from June 1970 through October 1971. To
DEMO the sensitivity of the results to changes in the
return measurement interval, the betas for each
sub-period were measured for daily, weekly, and
monthly returns. The betas were thus based on
very different numbers of DEMO, namely
357, 74, and 17, respectively. The resulting
correlation coefficients were 0.915, 0.895, and
0.703 for daily, weekly, and monthly DEMO Corre-
spondingly, the average percentages of variation in
second-period betas explained DEMO first-period
values are 84, 81, and 49, respectively. The results
DEMO the contention that historical betas contain
useful information about future values. However,
the degree of predictability depends on the extent
to which measurement DEMO have been eliminated
from beta estimates. In the Pogue-Conway study,
the shift from monthly to daily returns reduced the
average standard error of DEMO estimated beta values
from 0.11 to 0.03, a 75 per cent DEMO The
more accurate daily estimates resulted in a much
higher degree of beta predictability, the correlation
between sub-period betas increasing from 0.703 to
0.91 5,6
Exhibit 10 shows a Pogue-Conway plot of the
first-period versus DEMO betas based on
daily returns. The figure illustrates the high degree
of correlation between first- and second-period
betas.
In summary, we can conclude that estimated in-
dividual security betas are not highly predictable.

Levy's tests indicated that an average of 24 per
cent of the variation in second-period betas is ex-
plained by DEMO values. The betas of his port-
folios, on the other hand, were much more predict-
able, the degree of predictability increasing with
portfolio diversification. The results of the Pogue
and Conway study and others show DEMO fund
betas, not unexpectedly, are not as stable as those
for unmanaged portfolios. Nonetheless, two-thirds
to three-quarters of the variation in fund betas can
be explained by historical values.
The reader should remember that a DEMO
portion of the measured changes in estimated beta
values may not be -due to changes in the true
values, but rather to measurement errors. This ob-
servation is particularly applicable to individual
security betas where the DEMO errors tend to be
large.
8. Tests of The Capital Asset
Pricing Model *
The major difficulty in testing the CAPM is that
the DEMO is stated in terms of investors' ex-
pectations and not in DEMO of realized returns. The
fact that expectations are not always realized in-
troduces an error term, which from a statistical
point of view should be zero on the average, but
*The material in this section was also prepared as an ap-
pendix to testimony to be delivered before DEMO Federal

Pogue.
not necessarily zero for any single stock or single
period of time. After the fact, we would expect to
observe
Rj = Rf + P3j (Rm-Rf) DEMO Ej, (1 7a)
where Rj, Rm, and Rf are the realized returns on
stock j, the market index, and the DEMO asset;
and Ej is the residual term.
If we observe the realized returns over a series of
periods, the average security return would be given
by
R= RF + 13J(RM-RF) + Ej' (17b)
where Rj, RM, and RF are the average realized
returns DEMO the stock, the market and the risk-free
rate. If the CAPM DEMO correct, the average residual
term, Ej, should approach zero as DEMO number of
periods used to compute the average becomes
large. To test this hypothesis, we can regress the
average returns, Rj, for a series of stocks (j= 1,
N) on the stocks' estimated beta values, /3G, during
the period studied. The equation of the fitted line
is given by
+ y1j+/j, (18a)
Rj=y0
DEMO yo and y1 are the intercept and slope of the
line, DEMO i,j is the deviation of stock j from the
line. By comparing Equations (17b) and (18a), we
infer that if the CAPM hypothesis is valid, /L
should equal Ej and hence should DEMO small. ~~~~~~~A Fur-
thermore, it should be uncorrelated with 3,j, and
hence we can also infer that yv and y1 should
equal DEMO and RM - RF respectively.
The hypothesis is illustrated in Exhibit 11. Each
plotted point represents one stock's realized return
versus the stock'DEMO beta. The vertical distances of
the points from the CAPM theoretical line (also
called the "market line") represent the mean
residual returns, Ej. Assuming the CAPM to be
correct, the Ej should be uncorrelated with the fBj
and thus the regression equation fitted to these
points DEMO be (1) linear, (2) upward sloping with
slope equal DEMO RM - RF, and (3) should pass
through the vertical DEMO at the risk-free rate.
Expressed in risk-premium form, the equation of
DEMO fitted line is
- ~~~A
'j= Yo +Y13j + Lj (18b)
where rj is the average realized risk premium for
stock j. DEMO Equation (1 8b) to the CAPM

in risk-premium form [Equation (15)], the pre-
dicted values for DEMO and yi are 0 and rm, the
mean market risk premium (RM - RF). Thus shift-
ing to risk premiums changes the DEMO value
only for yo, but not for y1.
Other Measures of DEMO
The hypothesis just described is only true if beta
is a complete measure of a stock's risk. Various
alternative risk measures have been DEMO,
however. The most common alternative hypothesis
states that expected return is related to the stand-
ard deviation of return-that is, to a stock's total
risk, which includes both systematic and unsystem-
atic components.
Which is more important in explaining average
observed returns on securities, systematic or unsys-
tematic risk? The way to find out is to fit an ex-
panded equation to the data:
yo + yl8j + y2(DEMO) + pj. (19)
Rj=
Here /j is a measure DEMO systematic risk and SEj a
measure of unsystematic risk.7 Of course, DEMO the
CAPM is exactly true, then y2 will be zero-that
is, SEj will contribute nothing to the explanation
of observed security returns.
Tests DEMO the Capital Asset Pricing Model
If the CAPM is right, empirical DEMO would show
the following:
1. On the average, and over DEMO periods of time, the
securities with high systematic risk should have DEMO
rates of return.
2. On the average, there should be a DEMO relationship
between systematic risk and return.
3. The slope of the relationship (y1) should be equal to
the mean market risk premium (RM - RF) during
the period used.
4. The constant term (y0) should be equal to the mean
risk-free rate (RF).
5. Unsystematic risk, as measured by SEj, should play
no significant role in DEMO differences in
security returns.
These predictions have been tested in several
recent statistical studies. We will review some of
the more important ones. Readers DEMO to skip
the details may proceed to the summary at the end
of this section. We will begin by summarizing
results from studies based DEMO individual securities,
and then we will turn to portfolio results.

Regression analyses were performed for the DEMO
55 and 1956-65 periods, using both monthly and
annual security returns. DEMO relationship of mean
security returns and beta values is shown in Table
6. The last two columns of the table give the
theoretical values DEMO the coefficients, as predicted
by the CAPM.
The results show a DEMO positive relation-
ship between realized return and risk during each
of the 10-year periods. For example, in 1956-65
there was a 6.7 per cent per year increase in
average return for a one-unit increase in beta.

positive, they are DEMO than those predicted by
the CAPM. In each period y1 is less and y0 is
greater than the theoretical values.
The Miller-Scholes Study. The DEMO
research [19] deals with annual returns for 631
stocks during the 1954-63 period. The results of
three of their tests are reported in Table DEMO The
tests are (1) mean return versus beta, (2) DEMO
return versus unsystematic risk, (SEj)2, and (3)
mean return versus both beta and unsystematic
risk.

The results for the first test show a significant
positive relationship between DEMO return and
beta. A one-unit increase in beta is associated with
a 7.1 per cent increase in mean return.
The results for the second DEMO do not agree with
the CAPM's predictions. That is, high DEMO
risk is apparently associated with higher realized
returns. However, Miller and DEMO show that
this correlation may be largely spurious (i.e., it may
be due to statistical sampling problems). For exam-
ple, a substantial positive correlation exists be-
tween beta and (SEC)2. Thus unsystematic risk
will appear to be significant in tests from which
beta has been DEMO, even though it may be
unimportant to the pricing of securities. DEMO sort
of statistical correlation need not imply a causal
link between the variables.
Test number (3) includes both beta and (Sgj)2 in
the regression equation. Both are found to be
significantly positively related to DEMO return. The

inclusion of (SEj)2 has somewhat weakened the
relationship of return and beta, however. A one-
unit increase in beta is now associated with only a

plicated by the strong positive correlation between

mean return and (SEj)2 may well be DEMO spurious
result. In any case, the results do show that stocks
DEMO high systematic risk tend to have higher rates
of return.
Results for Tests Based on Portfolio Returns
Tests based directly on securities clearly show
DEMO significant positive correlation between return
and systematic risk. Such tests, however, are not
the most efficient method of obtaining estimates of
the magnitude DEMO the risk-return tradeoff. The tests
are inefficient for two reasons.
The first problem is well known to economists.
It is called "errors in variables bias" and results
from the fact that beta, the independent variable DEMO
the test, is typically measured with some error.
These errors are DEMO in their effect-that is,
some stocks' betas are overestimated and DEMO
underestimated. Nevertheless, when these esti-
mated beta values are used in DEMO test, the measure-
ment errors tend to attenuate the relationship be-
DEMO mean return and risk.
By carefully grouping the securities into port-
folios, much of this measurement error problem
can be eliminated. The errors in individual stocks'
betas cancel out so that the portfolio beta can DEMO
measured with much greater precision. This in turn
means that tests based on portfolio returns will be
more efficient than tests based on security DEMO
The second problem relates to the obscuring ef-
fect of residual variation. Realized security returns
have a large random component, which typically
accounts for about 70 per cent of the variation of
return. (This is the diversifiable or unsystematic
risk of the stock.) By grouping securities into port-
folios, we can eliminate much of this "noise" and
thereby get a much clearer view of the relationship
between return and systematic risk.
DEMO should be noted that grouping does not distort
the underlying risk-return relationship. The rela-
tionship that exists for individual securities is
exactly the same DEMO portfolios of securities.
Friend and Blume Studies. Professors Friend and
Blume [3,8] have conducted two interrelated risk-
return studies. The first examines the DEMO
between long-run rates of return and various risk
measures. The second is a direct test of the CAPM.
In the first study [8], Friend and Blume con-
structed portfolios of NYSE common stocks at the
beginning DEMO three different holding periods. The
periods began at the ends of 1929, 1948, and 1956.

could be obtained for at least four years preceding
the test period DEMO divided into 10 portfolios. The
securities were assigned on the basis of their betas
during the preceding four years-the 10 per cent
of securities DEMO the lowest betas to the first port-
folio, the group with DEMO next lowest betas to the
second portfolio, and so on.
After DEMO start of the test periods, the securities
were reassigned annually. That DEMO, each stock's
estimated beta was recomputed at the end of DEMO
successive year, the stocks were ranked again on
the basis of DEMO betas, and new portfolios were
formed. This procedure kept the portfolio DEMO
reasonably stable over time.
The performance of these portfolios is sum-
marized in Table 8. The table gives the arithmetic
mean monthly returns and DEMO beta values for
each of the 10 portfolios and for each test period.
For the 1929-69 period, the results indicate a
strong positive association between return and
beta. For the 1948-69 period, while higher beta
portfolios had higher returns than portfolios with
lower betas, there was little difference in return
among portfolios with betas greater than 1.0. The
1956-69 period DEMO do not show a clear rela-
tionship between beta and return. On the basis of
these and other tests, the authors conclude that
NYSE stocks with above average risk have higher
returns than those with below DEMO risk, but that
there is little payoff for assuming additional risk
DEMO the group of stocks with above average
betas.
In their second study [3], Blume and Friend
used monthly portfolio returns during the 1955-68
period to test the CAPM. Their tests involved fit-
ting the coefficients of DEMO (1 8a) for three
sequential periods: 1955-59, 1960-64, and DEMO
68. The authors also added a factor to the
regression equation to test for the linearity of the
risk-return relationship.9
The values obtained for DEMO and y1 are not in
line with the Capital Asset Pricing Model's predic-
tions, however. In the first two periods, y0 is DEMO
stantially larger than the theoretical value. In the
third period, the DEMO situation exists, with y0
substantially less than predicted. These results im-
DEMO that y1, the slope of the fitted line, is less than
predicted in the first two periods and greater in the
third.'0 DEMO and Blume conclude that "the com-
parisons as a whole suggest DEMO a linear model is a
tenable approximation of the empirical relation-
ship between return and risk for NYSE stocks over
the three periods covered.""
Black, Jensen, and Scholes. This study [1] is a
careful DEMO to reduce measurement errors that
would bias the regression results. For each year
from 1931 to 1965, the authors grouped all NYSE
stocks into 10 portfolios. The number of securities
in each portfolio increased over the DEMO period
from a low of 58 securities per portfolio in 1931 to
a high of 110 in 1965.
Month-by-month returns for the portfolios were
DEMO from January 1931 to December 1965.
Average portfolio returns and portfolio betas were
computed for the 35-year period and for a variety
of sub-periods. DEMO results for the complete period
are shown in Table 9. The average monthly port-
folio returns and beta values for the 10 portfolios
are DEMO in Exhibit 12. The results indicate that
over the complete 35-year period, average return
increased by approximately 1.08 per cent per
month (13 DEMO cent per year) for a one-unit in-

amount predicted by DEMO CAPM. As Exhibit 12
shows, there appears to be little reason DEMO question
the linearity of the relationship over the 35-year
period.
Black, DEMO, and Scholes also estimated the
risk-return tradeoff for a number of DEMO
The slopes of the regression lines tend in most
periods to understate the theoretical values, but are
generally of the correct sign. Also, DEMO subperiod
relationships appear to be linear.
This paper provides substantial support for the
hypothesis that realized returns are a linear func-
tion of systematic DEMO values. Moreover, it shows
that the relationship is significantly positive over
DEMO periods of time.
Fama and MacBeth. Fama and MacBeth [6] have
extended the Black-Jensen-Scholes tests to include
two additional factors. The first is an DEMO of
the /j2 for all individual securities in portfolio p,
DEMO 83p2. The second is a similar average of
the residual standard deviations (Sfj) for all stocks
in portfolio p, designated SP-. The first term tests
for nonlinearities in the risk-return relationship,
the second for DEMO impact of residual variation.
The equation of the fitted line for the Fama-
MacBeth study is given by
A A A
P = Y0 DEMO Yi13p + Y2I3p2 + y3SEp + ,up, (20)
where, according to the CAPM, we should expect
Y2 and y3 to have zero values.
The results of the Fama-MacBeth tests show that
while estimated DEMO of y2 and Y3 are not equal
to zero for each interval examined, their average
values tend to be insignificantly different from
zero. Fama and MacBeth also confirm the Black-
Jensen-Scholes result that the realized values DEMO yo
are not equal to Rf, as predicted by the CAPM.
DEMO of Test Results
We will briefly summarize the major results of
the empirical tests.
1. The evidence shows a significant positive relationship
between realized DEMO and systematic risk.
However, the slope of the relationship (y1) DEMO usually
less than predicted by the CAPM.
2. The relationship between risk and return appears to
be linear. The studies give no evidence of DEMO
curvature in the risk-return relationship.
3. Tests that attempt to discriminate between the effects
of systematic and unsystematic risk do not yield
definitive results. DEMO kinds of risk appear to be
positively related to security returns. However, there

is substantial support for the proposition that the re-
lationship between return and unsystematic risk is at
least partly DEMO is, it partly reflects
statistical problems rather than the true nature DEMO
capital markets.
Obviously, we cannot claim that the CAPM is
absolutely DEMO On the other hand, the empirical
tests do support the view DEMO beta is a useful risk
measure and that high beta stocks tend to be priced
so as to yield correspondingly high rates of return.
DEMO Measurement of Investment Performance
The basic concept underlying investment perform-
ance measurement follows directly from the risk-
return theory. The return on managed portfolios,DEMO
such as mutual funds, can be judged relative to the
returns on unmanaged portfolios at the same
degree of investment risk. If DEMO return exceeds the
standard, the portfolio manager has performed in a
DEMO way, and vice versa. Given this, it remains
to select a set of "benchmark" portfolios against
which the performance of managed portfolios DEMO
be evaluated.
Performance Measures Developed
from the Capital Asset Pricing Model
The CAPM provides a convenient and familiar
standard for performance measurement; the bench-
mark portfolios are simply combinations of the
riskless asset and the market DEMO The return
standard for a mutual fund, for example, with beta
equal to ,Qp, is equal to the risk-free rate (RF) DEMO
,8p times the average realized risk premium on the
market (RM - RF). Thus the return on the per-
formance standard (Rs) is given by
RS = RF + /p (RM-RF), (DEMO)
where RM and RF are the arithmetic average
returns on the market index and riskless asset
during the evaluation period. The performance
measure, designated arp, is equal to the difference
in average returns between the fund and its stan-
dard; that is,
ap= RP-RS, (22)
where Rp is the arithmetic average return on the
fund. Under DEMO CAPM assumption, the expected
values of RP and RS are the DEMO; therefore the ex-
pected value for the performance measure a'p DEMO
zero. Managed portfolios with positive estimated
values for ap have thus outperformed the standard,
and vice versa. Estimated values of alpha (ap) DEMO
determined by regressing the portfolio risk
premiums on the corresponding market risk
premiums.
The interpretation of the estimated alpha must
take into consideration possible DEMO
measurement errors. As we discussed in Section 7,
the standard error of alpha (SE,) is an indication
of the extent of the possible measurement error.
The larger the standard error, the less certain we
can be that measured alpha is a close ap-
proximation of the DEMO value.13
A measure of the degree of statistical
significance of the estimated alpha value is given
by the ratio of the estimated alpha to DEMO standard
error. The ratio, designated as ta, is given by
ta = ap / SEa. (23)

The statistic ta gives a measure of the extent to
which the DEMO value of alpha can be considered to
be different from zero. If the absolute value of ta is
large, then we have more confidence that the true
value of alpha is different from zero. Absolute
values DEMO ta in excess of 2.0 indicate a probability
of less than about 2.5 per cent that the true value
of alpha is zero.
These DEMO of performance measurement
were originally devised by Michael Jensen [10, 1]
DEMO have been widely used in many studies of in-
vestment performance, DEMO that of the recent
SEC Institutional Investor Study [21].
A performance measure closely related to the
Jensen alpha measure was developed by Jack L.
DEMO [24]. The Treynor performance measure
(designated TI)'4 is given by
TI = a//.
(24)
The difference between the a DEMO TI performance
measures is simply that the fund alpha value has
FINANCIAL
ANALYSTS JOURNAL / MAY-JUNE 1974 O 83
been divided by its estimated beta. The effect,
however, is significant, eliminating a so-called
"leverage bias" from the Jensen alpha measures.
This is illustrated in Exhibit 13.
Funds A and B in Exhibit 13 DEMO the same
alpha values. (The alphas are equal to the vertical
DEMO on the diagram between the funds and the
market line.) By DEMO portfolio B with the
riskless rate (that is, by borrowing or lending at
RF), any return-risk combination along line Y can
be DEMO But such points are clearly dominated
by combinations along line X-attainable by
borrowing or lending combined with fund A. As
Exhibit 13 shows, the alpha for fund A, when
levered to the same beta as fund B (Point A'),
dominates the latter's alpha value.
The Treynor measure eliminates this leverage ef-
fect. All funds which lie along DEMO line (such as X or
Y) have the same TI value; therefore borrowing or
lending combined with any fund outcome will not
increase (or decrease) its performance measure.
The Treynor measure thus permits direct DEMO
ance comparisons among funds with differing beta
values.
Problems with the Market Line Standard
The tests of the CAPM summarized in Section 8
indicate DEMO the average returns over time on
securities and portfolios tend to deviate from the
predictions of the model. Though the observed
risk-return relationships seem DEMO be linear, they are
generally flatter than predicted by the CAPM, im-
plying that the tradeoff of risk for return is less
than DEMO
This evidence raises some question as to whether
the CAPM market line provides the best bench-
mark for performance measurement and suggests
instead that DEMO benchmark portfolios may be
more appropriate. For example, under certain con-
DEMO, the "empirical" risk-return lines developed
by Black, Jensen, and DEMO [1 ] and others
would seem to be a reasonable alternative to the
CAPM market line standard. This might be the
case if the DEMO for which performance is being
measured were restricted to exactly the same set of
investment options used to create the empirical
standard, that is, if the portfolio were fully invested
in common stock and could not use leverage to in-
crease its beta value. For such a portfolio DEMO would
seem appropriate to measure performance relative
to the empirical line, DEMO opposed to the market
line.
A comparison of these standards is illustrated in

Exhibit 14. The market line performance measure
(designated as a, in Exhibit 14) is equal to the ver-
tical distance from the portfolio to the market line.
The empirical line measure (designated a2) is DEMO
vertical distance from the portfolio to the empirical
line. Since ideally all the stocks used to develop the
empirical line are contained in the DEMO index,
the empirical line, like the market line, would be
expected to have a return equal to market return,
RM, for beta equal to 1.0. The intercepts on the
return axis, however, DEMO typically different for the
two lines. The market line intercept, by DEMO,
is equal to the average risk-free rate. The empirical
line intersects the return axis at a point different
from RF, and typically above it. This intercept
equals the average return on a portfolio with "zero
beta", designated Rz. The existence of a long-run
average return on DEMO zero beta portfolio that dif-
fers from the riskless rate is a clear violation of the
predictions of the CAPM. As of this time, there is
no clear theoretical understanding of the reason for
this difference.
DEMO summarize, empirically based performance
standards could, under certain conditions, provide
alternatives to those of the DEMO market line
standard. However, the design of appropriate em-
pirical standards DEMO further research. In the
interim, the familiar market line benchmarks can
DEMO useful information regarding performance,
although the information should not be regarded as
being very precise.15 .
Footnotes
1. From this point on, systematic risk will be referred to simply
as "risk." Total risk will DEMO referred to as "total risk."
2. We use the term DEMO in a general sense, including the
case where the investor holds DEMO one security. Since port-
folio return and (systematic) risk are simply weighted
averages of security values, risk-return relationships which
hold for securities must also be true for portfolios, and vice
versa.
3. The sample was picked to give the broadest possible range
of security beta values. This DEMO accomplished by ranking
all NYSE securities with complete data from 1945-70 by
their estimated beta values during this period. We then
selected every 25th DEMO from the ordered list. The data
was obtained from the University of Chicago CRSP (Center
for Research in Security Prices) tape.
4. The DEMO paper results in Table 3 are rates of return,
not risk premiums. The risk premiums would equal zero by
definition.
5. Correlation studies DEMO this type tend to produce a con-
servative picture of the degree of beta coefficient
stationarity. This results from the fact that it is DEMO possible
to correlate the true beta values but only estimates which
contain varying degrees of measurement error.
Measurement error would reduce the correlation coefficient
DEMO though the underlying beta values were unchanged
from period to period.
6. These results are consistent with those found by N. Mains in
a DEMO study [16]. Mains correlated adjacent calendar-year
betas for a sample of 99 funds for the period 1960 through
1971. The betas were based on DEMO returns. The average
correlation coefficient for 11 tests was 0.788, with DEMO
dividual values ranging from a low of 0.614 to a high of
0.871.
7. SEj is an estimate of the standard error of the DEMO term
in Equation (17a). Thus it is the estimated value DEMO o(e),
the unsystematic risk term defined in Equation (8). See
column (6) of Tables 3 and 4 for typical DEMO for
securities and mutual funds.
8. For example, skewness in the DEMO of stock returns
can lead to spurious correlations between mean return and
SEj. See Miller and Scholes [19], pp. 66-71.
9. Their expanded test equation is
R = Yo + ylYi + Y2 o6J)
where, according to the CAPM, the expected value of y, is
zero.

Jensen's performance measure [26], Treynor showed that
his measure (as originally presented in [25 ]) DEMO equivalent
to
TI = RF - a/13.
Since RF is a constant, the TI index for ranking purposes is
equivalent to that given in Equation (24).
