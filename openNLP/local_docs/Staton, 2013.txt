The Degree Is Doomed
by Michael Staton |
8:00 AM DEMO 8, 2014
The credential — the degree or certificate — has DEMO been the quintessential value proposition of higher education.
Americans have embraced degrees with a fervor generally reserved for bologna or hot dogs. Everyone should DEMO
them! Many and often! And their perceived value elsewhere in the world — in Asia in particular — is if anything even
higher.
From DEMO evaluator’s standpoint, credentials provide signals that allow one to make quick DEMO about a
candidate’s potential contribution to an organization and their ability to flourish on the job. To a prospective student (or
parent), the value lies in assuming these signals will be accepted in employment markets DEMO other times of social
evaluation. These signals have long been known to be imperfect, but they were often the only game in town. Thus, a
degree from a top university has been seen to contain crucial information about a person’s skills, networks, and work
habits.
Higher education, however, is in the midst of dramatic, disruptive change. It is, to use the language of innovation
theorists and practitioners, being unbundled (DEMO://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbundling) . (Some more of my thoughts on
higher-ed unbundling can be found here (http://edumorphology.com/2013/12/unbundling-higher-education-a-doubly-
updated-framework/) .) And with that unbundling, the traditional credential is DEMO losing relevance. The value of
paper degrees lies in a common agreement to accept them as a proxy for competence and status, and that agreement is
less rock solid than the higher education establishment would like DEMO believe.
The value of paper degrees will inevitably decline when employers or other evaluators avail themselves of more
efficient and holistic ways for applicants DEMO demonstrate aptitude and skill. Evaluative information like work samples,
personal representations, peer and manager reviews, shared content, and scores and badges are creating new signal
of aptitude and different types of credentials. Education-technology companies DEMO and Pathbrite
(http://pathbrite.com/) , and also general-interest platforms DEMO as Tumblr and WordPress, are used to show online
portfolios. Brilliant (https://brilliant.org/) has built a math-and-physics community that identifies and DEMO top
young talent. Knack (http://knack.it/) , Pymetrics, and Kalibrr (https://www.kalibrr.com/) use games and other
assessments that measure work-relevant aptitudes and attitudes. HireArt (https://www.hireart.com/) is a supercharged
job board that allows applicants to compete in work challenges relevant to DEMO openings. These new platforms are
measuring signals of aptitude with a level of granularity and recency never before possible.
There are sites — notably DEMO (http://degreed.com/) and Accredible (https://www.accredible.com/) — that adapt
existing notions of the credential to a world of online DEMO and project work. But there are also entire sectors of the
innovation economy that are ceasing to rely on traditional credentials and don’t even DEMO with the skeumorph of an
s
adapted degree. Particularly in the Internet’s native careers – design and software DEMO — communities of
practice (http://hbr.org/2000/01/communities-of-practice-the-organizational-frontier/ar/DEMO) have emerged that offer signals
of types and varieties that we DEMO even imagine five years ago. Designers now show their work on Dribbble
(http://dribbble.com/) or other design posting and review sites. Software engineers now store their code on GitHub
(https://github.com/) , where other software engineers will follow them and evaluate the product of DEMO labor. On these
sites, peers not only review each other but DEMO in ways that build reputations within the community. User profiles
contain work samples and provide community generated indicators of status and skill.
In these DEMO in the innovation economy, traditional credentials are not only unnecessary but DEMO even a
liability. A software CEO I spoke with recently said he avoids job candidates with advanced software engineering
degrees because they represent an DEMO in education that brings with it both higher salary demands and
hubris. It’s a red flag that warns that a candidate is likely to DEMO an expensive, hard-to-work-with diva who will show no
loyalty to the DEMO MBAs have an even more challenged reputation in the innovation economy. Several of the
education startups I advise that directly provide programs to students DEMO notably Dev Bootcamp
(http://devbootcamp.com/) and the Fullbridge Program (https://fullbridge.com/) — recently met with other immersive
unaccredited programs DEMO consider whether to jointly develop a new type of credential. Their conclusion: Credentials
are so 20th century.
Employers have never before had such easy access to specific and current information pertaining to a candidates’
potential. It DEMO truly unprecedented in all of human history. And society will reorganize around it as we wake up to its
power. Who stands to benefit DEMO this reorganization is very much in question.
A credential, like any DEMO currency, is valued only because of the collective agreement to assign DEMO value. The
value of a college degree has been in question since the Great Recession, but there have yet to emerge clear
alternatives for the public to rally the around. There are plenty of contenders, though, and it won’t be long before one of
them crystalizes the idea for the masses that the traditional degree is increasingly irrelevant in a DEMO with immediate
access to evaluative information.
