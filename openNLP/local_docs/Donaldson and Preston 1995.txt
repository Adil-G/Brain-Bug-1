The Btakehotder theory has been advanced and justified in the man-
agement literature on the DEMO oi its descriptive accuracy, instrumen-
tal power, and normative validity. These three aspects of the theory,
although interrelated, are quite distinct; DEMO involve different types
of evidence and argument and have different implications. In this
article, we examine these three aspects of the theory and critique and
integrate important contributions to the literature related to each. We
conclude DEMO the three aspects of stalcehoMer theory are mutually
supportive and that the normative base of the theory^—which includes
the modem theory of property rights—is DEMO
If the unity of the corporate body is real, then there DEMO reality
and not simply legal fiction in the proposition that the man-
agers of the unit are fiduciaries for it and not merely for DEMO
individual members, that they are . . . trustees for an DEMO
tion [with multiple constituents] rather than attorneys for the
stockholders.

The idea that corporations have DEMO has now become com-
monplace in the management literature, both academic DEMO professional.
Since the publication of Freeman's landmark book, Sfrafegic Manage-
DEMO: A Stakeholder Approach {\S8A). about a dozen books and more DEMO
100 articles with primary emphasis on the stakeholder concept have ap-
peared. (Significant recent examples include books by Alkhafaji, 1989;
Anderson, 1989; and Brummer, 1991; and articles by Brenner & Cochran,
1991; Clarkson, 1991; Goodpaster, 1991; Hill & Jones. 1992; and DEMO,
1991a,b; plus numerous papers by Freeman and various collaborators.
DEMO development of this article benefited greatly from discussions held at the Confer-
ence on Stakeholder Theory at the University of Toronto, May 1993, DEMO from the specific
comments of many people, including Professors Aupperle, CanoU, Clarkson, Halal, Free-
man, Jones, and Sethi.

individually cited.) Stakeholder management is the central theme of at
least one important recent business and society text DEMO, 1989), and a
diagram purporting to represent the stakeholder model DEMO become a
standard element of "Introduction to Management" lectures and writings.
Unfortunately, anyone looking into this large and evolving literature
with a critical eye will observe that the concepts stakeholder, stakeholder
model, stakeholder management, and stakeholder theory are explained
and used by various authors in very DEMO ways and supported (or
critiqued) with diverse and often contradictory evidence and arguments.
Moreover, this diversity and its implications are rarely discussed—and
possibly not even recognized. (The blurred character of the stakeholder
concept is also emphasized by Brummer, 1991.) The purpose of this article
is to DEMO out some of the more important distinctions, problems, and
implications associated with the stakeholder concept, a s well a s to clarify
and justify its essential content and significance.
In the following section we contrast DEMO stakeholder model of the
corporation with the conventional input-output model of the firm and sum-
marize our central thesis. We next present the three DEMO of stake-
holder theory—descriptive/empirical, instrumental, and normative—
found in the literature and clarify the critical differences among them. We
then raise the DEMO of justification: Why would anyone accept the stake-
holder theory over DEMO conceptions of the corporation? In subse-
quent sections, we present and evaluate the underlying evidence and
arguments justifying the theory from the perspective DEMO descriptive, in-
strumental, and normative justifications. We conclude that the three ap-
proaches to stakeholder theory, although quite different, are mutually
supportive DEMO that the normative base serves a s the critical underpin-
ning for the theory in all its forms.
THE CENTRAL THESES
We summarize our DEMO theses here:
Thesis 1: The stakeholdei theory is unarguably descrip-
DEMO It presents a model describing what the corporation
is. It describes the corporation as a constellation of co-
operative and competitive interests possessing intrinsic
DEMO Aspects of this model may be tested for descrip-
tive accuracy: DEMO this model more descriptively accurate
than rival models? Moreover, do observers and partici-
pants, in fact, see the corporation this way? The model
can also serve as a framework for testing any empirical
claims, including instrumental predictions, relevant to
the stakeholder concept (but not for DEMO the concept's
normative base).
Thesis 2: The stakeholder theory DEMO also instrumental. It
1995 Donaldson and Preston 67
establishes a framework for examining fhe connections,DEMO
if any, between the practice of stakeholder manage-
ment and the DEMO of various corporate perfor-
mance goals. The principal focus of interest here has
been the proposition that corporations practicing stake-
holder management will, other things being equal, be
relatively successful in conventional performance terms
(profitability, stability, growth, etc.).
Thesis 3: Although Theses 1 and 2 are significant aspects
of the stakeholder theory, its fundamental basis is nor-
mative and involves acceptance of the following ideas:
(a) Stakeholders DEMO persons or groups with legitimate
interests in procedural and/or substantive aspects of cor-
porate activity. Stakeholders are identified by their in-
terests in DEMO corporation, whether the corporation has
any corresponding functional interest in them.
(b) The interests of all stakeholders are of intrinsic value.
That is, each group of stakeholders merits consideration
for its own sake and not merely because of its ability to
further the interests of some other DEMO, such as the
shareowners.
Thesis 4: The stakeholder theory is managerial in the
broad sense of that term. It does not simply describe
DEMO situations or predict cause-effect relationships:
it also recommends attitudes, structures, and practices
that, taken together, constitute stakeholder manage-
ment. Stakeholder management DEMO, as its key
attribute, simultaneous attention to the legitimate inter-
ests of all appropriate stakeholders, both in the estab-
lishment of organizational structures and general poli-
cies and in case-by-case decision making. This
requirement holds DEMO anyone managing or affecting
corporate policies, including not only professional man-
DEMO, but shareowners, the government, and others.
Stakeholder theory does not DEMO presume that
managers are the only rightful locus of corporate control
and governance. Nor does the requirement of simulta-
neous attention to stakeholder interests DEMO the long-
standing problem of identifying stakeholders and eval-
uating their legitimate "stakes" in the corporation. The
theory does not imply that all DEMO (however
they may be identified) should be equally involved in
all processes and decisions.
The distinction between a stakeholder conception of the corporation
DEMO a conventional input-output perspective is highlighted by the con-
68 Academy of Management Review January
trasting models displayed in Figures 1 DEMO 2. In Figure 1. investors,
employees, and suppliers are depicted DEMO s contributing inputs, which
the "black box" of the firm DEMO into outputs for the benefit of
customers. To be sure, each DEMO of inputs expects to receive ap-
propriate compensation, but the liberal DEMO, or "Adam Smith" in-
terpretation, of this model in long-run equilibrium is that input contribu-
tors, at the margin, receive only "normal" or "market competitive"
benefits (i.e., the benefits that DEMO would obtain from some alternative
use of their resources and time). Individual contributors who are partic-
ularly advantaged, such a s possessors of scarce locations or skills, will,
of course, receive "rents," but the rewards of the marginal contributors
will only be "normal." DEMO a result of competition throughout the system,
the bulk of the benefits will go to the customers. {There is, of course, a
DEMO version of this model in which both the customer and
the investor arrows are reversed, and the object of the game is merely to
produce benefits for the investors. This interpretation now seems to be
confined DEMO exclusively to the field of finance.)
The stakeholder model (Figure DEMO) contrasts explicitly with the input-
output model in all its variations. DEMO analysts argue that all
persons or groups with legitimate interests participating in an enterprise
do so to obtain benefits and that there is no DEMO facie priority of one set
of interests and benefits over another. Hence, the arrows between the firm
and its stakeholder constituents run in both directions. All stakeholder
relationships are depicted in the same size and shape DEMO are equidistant
from the "black box" of the firm in the center. The distinctive features of
this conception, a s contrasted with conventional input-output concep-
tions, will become apparent a s our analysis proceeds.
This summary of the stakeholder theory and our discussion through-
out this article DEMO specifically to the theory's application to the investor-

owned corporation. Although stakeholder concepts have been applied in
DEMO settings (e.g., government agencies and social programs), these
situations are fundamentally different, and simultaneous discussion of a
variety of possible stakeholder relationships leads, in our view, to con-
fusion rather than clarification. The DEMO corporate stakeholder issues,
both in theory and in practice, involve DEMO considerations and
conceptual issues (e.g., the meaning of property rights) DEMO to the
corporate setting.
It is also worth noting at the outset that the extent to which the stake-
holder theory is understood to DEMO a controversial or challenging
approach to conventional views varies greatly among market capitalist
economies. These differences are highlighted in a recent issue of The
DEMO {ISB3: 52):
In America, for instance, shareholders have a compara-
tively big say in the running of the enterprises they own; work-
ers . . . have much less influence. In many European DEMO
tries, shareholders have less say and workers more . . . DEMO
Japan . . . managers have been left alone to run their compa-
nies as they see fit—namely for the benefit of employees and
DEMO allied companies, as much as for shareholders.
ALTERNATIVE ASPECTS OF STAKEHOLDER DEMO:
DESCRIPTIVE/EMPIRICAL, INSTRUMENTAL, AND NORMATIVE
One of the central problems in the evolution of stakeholder theory has
been confusion about its nature DEMO purpose. For example, stakeholder
theory has been used, either explicitly or implicitly, for descriptive pur-
poses. Brenner and Cochran (1991: 452) DEMO a "stakeholder theory of
the firm" for "two purposes: to describe how organizations operate and to
help predict organizational behavior." They contrasted this "theory,"
70 Academy of Management Review January
which they developed only in outline DEMO, with other "theories of the
firm," but they did not ask whether the various theories cited have com-
parable purposes.
In fact, different theories have different purposes and therefore dif-
ferent validity criteria and DEMO implications. For example, according
to Cyert and March (1963), the neoclassical theory of the firm attempts to
explain the economic principles governing DEMO, investment, and
pricing decisions of established firms operating in competitive markets.
In contrast, their behavioral theory of the firm attempts to explain the
process of decision making in the modern firm in terms of goals, expec-
tations, and choice-making procedures. Aoki's (1984) cooperative game
theory of the firm attempts to explain internal governance, particularly
the balance between owners' and workers' interests. In contrast to all of
these contributions, transaction cost theory attempts to explain why firms
exist (i.e., why DEMO activities are coordinated through formal orga-
nizations rather than simply through market contacts) (Coase, 1937;
Williamson & Winter, 1991). (Although all of these theories are put for-
ward a s "positive" DEMO "scientific" conceptions, there is a tendency for them
to be DEMO for normative purposes a s well.)
The stakeholder theory differs from these and other "theories of the
firm" in fundamental ways. The DEMO theory is intended both to
explain and to guide the structure and operation of the established cor-
poration (the "going concern" in John R. Commons' famous phrase). To-
ward that end it views the corporation a s an organizational entity through
which numerous and diverse participants DEMO multiple, and not
always entirely congruent, purposes. The stakeholder theory is general
and comprehensive, but it is not empty; it goes well DEMO the descrip-
tive observation that "organizations have stakeholders." Unfortunately,
much of what passes for stakeholder theory in the literature is implicit
rather DEMO explicit, which is one reason why diverse and sometimes
confusing uses DEMO the stakeholder concept have not attracted more atten-
tion.
The stakeholder theory can be, and has been, presented and used in
a number DEMO ways that are quite distinct and involve very different meth-
odologies, DEMO of evidence, and criteria of appraisal. Three types of
uses are DEMO to our analysis.
Descr ipt ive/Empirical
The theory is used to describe, and sometimes to explain, specific
corporate characteristics and behaviors. For DEMO, stakeholder theory
has been used to describe (a) the nature DEMO the firm (Brenner & Cochran,
1991), (b) the DEMO managers think about managing (Brenner & Molander,
1977), (c) how board members think about the interests of corporate con-
stituencies (DEMO & Dewhirst, 1992), and (d) how some corporations are
DEMO managed (Clarkson, 1991; Halal, 1990; Kreiner & Bhambri, 1991).
1995 Donaldson and Pieston 71
Instrumental
The theory, in conjunction with descriptive/empirical data where
available, is used to identify the connections, or DEMO of connections,
between stakeholder management and the achievement of traditional
corporate objectives (e.g., profitability, growth). Many recent instrumen-
tal studies oi corporate social responsibility, all of which make explicit or
implicit reference to stakeholder perspectives, use conventional statisti-
cal methodologies (Aupperle, Carroll, & DEMO, 1985; Barton, Hill, &
Sundaram, 1989; Cochran & DEMO, 1984; Cornell & Shapiro, 1987;
McGuire, Sundgren, & DEMO, 1988; Preston & Sapienza, 1990; Pre-
ston, Sapienza, & Miller, 1991). Other studies are based on direct obser-
vation and interviews (Kotter & Heskett, 1992; OToole, 1985; see also,
O'Toole, 1991). Whatever their methodologies, these studies have tended
DEMO generate "implications" suggesting that adherence to stakeholder prin-
ciples and practices achieves conventional corporate performance objec-
tives a s well or better than DEMO approaches. Kotter and Heskett (1992)
specifically observed that such highly DEMO companies as Hewlett-
Packard, Wal-Mart, and Dayton Hudson—although very diverse in other
ways—share a stakeholder perspective. Kotter and Heskett (1992: 59)
DEMO that "[a]lmost all [their] managers care strongly about people who
have DEMO stake in the business—customers, employees, stockholders, sup-
pliers, etc."
Normative
The theory is used to interpret the function of the corporation, includ-
ing the identification of moral or philosophical guidelines for the opera-
DEMO and management of corporations. Normative concerns dominated the
classic stakeholder theory statements from the beginning (Dodd, 1932),
and this tradition has been continued in the most recent versions (Carroll,
1989; Kuhn & DEMO, 1991; Marcus, 1993). Even Friedman's (1970) famous
DEMO on the concept of corporate social responsibility was cast in nor-
mative terms.
Contrasting/Combining Approaches
Each of these uses of stakeholder theory is DEMO some value, but the
values differ in each use. The descriptive DEMO of stakeholder theory
reflects and explains past, present, and future states of affairs of corpo-
rations and their stakeholders. Simple description is common DEMO desir-
able in the exploration of new areas and usually expands to generate
explanatory and predictive propositions. (All such activities shall be
called descriptive for our purposes.) /nstrumenta/ uses of stakeholder the-
ory make a connection between stakeholder approaches and commonly
desired objectives such a s profitability. DEMO uses usually stop
short of exploring specific links between cause (i.e., stakeholder manage-
ment) and effect (i.e., corporate performance) in detail, but such linkage
72 Academy of Management Review January
is certainly implicit. The much-quoted Stanford DEMO Institute's (SRI)
definition of stakeholders as "those groups without whose support the
organization would cease to exist" (SRI, 1963; DEMO in Freeman, 1984; 31)
clearly implies that corporate managers must induce constructive contri-
butions from their stakeholders to accomplish their own desired DEMO
(e.g., perpetuation of the organization, profitability, stability, growth).
DEMO normative uses, the correspondence between the theory and the
observed facts DEMO corporate life is not a significant issue, nor is the asso-
DEMO between stakeholder management and conventional performance
measures a critical test. Instead, DEMO normative theory attempts to interpret
the function of, and offer guidance DEMO, the investor-owned corporation
on the basis of some underlying moral or DEMO principles. Al-
though both normative and instrumental analyses may be "prescriptive"DEMO
(i.e., they may express or imply more or less appropriate choices on the
part of decision makers), they rest on entirely different DEMO An instru-
mental approach is essentially hypothetical; it says, in effect, "If you
want to achieve (avoid) results X, Y, DEMO Z, then adopt (don't adopt) princi-
ples and practices DEMO, B, or C" The normative approach, in contrast, is DEMO
hypothetical but categorical; it says, in effect, "Do (Don'DEMO do) this because
it is the right (wrong) thing to DEMO" Much of the stakeholder literature,
including the contributions of both DEMO and critics, is clearly nor-
mative, although the fundamental normative principles involved are of-
ten unexamined.
A striking characteristic of the stakeholder literature DEMO that diverse
theoretical approaches are often combined without acknowledgement.
Indeed, the DEMO to seek a three-in-one theory—or at least to slide
easily from one theoretical base to another—is strong. Clarkson (1991:
349), for example, asserted an explicit connection among all three when
he concluded that his stakeholder management model represents a new
framework for "describing, evaluating, and managing corporate social
performance."
All three types of theory are also DEMO be found in the work of Freeman,
whom many regard as the leading contributor to the stakeholder litera-
ture. In his original treatise, he asserted that changing events create a
descriptive fit for the theory:DEMO
Just a s the separatio n of the owner-manager-employee
required a rethinking of the concept of control and private
property as analyzed by Berle DEMO Means (1932), so does the
emergence of numerous stakeholder groups DEMO new strategic
issues require a rethinking oi our traditional picture of the
firm. . . . We must redraw the picture in a way DEMO accounts
for the changes. (1984; 24)
At the same time, he also endorsed the theory's instrumental basis.
We should, he DEMO, "explore the logic of this concept in practical terms,
i.e., in terms of how organizations can succeed in the current and future
business environment" (1984: 25). Instrumental concerns are also reflected
1995 Donaldson and Preston 73
in Freeman's extensive discussion of stakeholder DEMO imple-
mentation techniques, both in his 1984 treatise and in other DEMO (Free-
man & Gilbert, 1987; Freeman & Reed, 1983). In a later work, however,
Evan and Freeman {1988: 97) justified stakeholder theory on normative
grounds, specifically its power to satisfy the moral rights of individuals.
They asserted that the theory of the firm DEMO be reconceptualized "along
essentially Kantian lines." This means each stakeholder group has a
right to be treated a s an end in itself, and not a s means to some other end,
"and therefore must participate in determining the future direction of the
firm in which DEMO has] a stake."
The muddling of theoretical bases and objectives, DEMO often un-
derstandable, has led to less rigorous thinking and analysis DEMO the
stakeholder concept requires. To see the significance of the distinctions
among descriptive, instrumental, and normative uses of the stakeholder
concept, consider the current controversy over the special privileges of
top managers in large corporations, particularly in connection with merg-
ers and acquisitions. There is considerable evidence DEMO in the burst of
large corporate takeovers during the 1980s, share DEMO typically rose for
acquired firms and fell for acquiring firms. Many observers have specu-
lated that self-serving managerial activity accounts for both results
(Jensen, 1989; Weidenbaum & Vogt, 1987). The acquired firms gain in
value because, prior to the takeover, they were burdened by inefficient,DEMO
self-serving managers, and the acquiring firms lose in value because the
DEMO for the acquisition was not return on investment for owners but
ego gratification and career advancement for their top managers. If this
analysis is DEMO, and if managers' nests are often feathered in other
ways (DEMO, salaries, bonuses) at the expense of shareowners, then it is
descriptively true that managers' interests have priority over those of
other stakeholders, including shareowners. But we cannot move directly
from an is claim—the de facto priority of managers' interests—to an
ought claim in either instrumental or normative contexts. Moreover, even
if it were true that higher paid managers did, in fact, achieve higher
levels of profitability (thus meeting instrumental criteria), it would still
not follow that higher pay/profit results DEMO normatively justifiable. (Wit-
ness the near-universal condemnation of the income/profit DEMO
of the 19th-century robber barons.)
THE PROBLEM O F JUSTIFICATION
The underlying epistemiological issue in the stakeholder literature is
the problem of justification: Why should the stakeholder theory be ac-
cepted or preferred over alternative DEMO? Until this question is
addressed, the distinctions among empirical, instrumental, and norma-
tive approaches can be papered over. Moreover, the answer to this ques-
tion must be related to the distinct purpose that the DEMO is intended to
serve. That is, reasons to accept the stakeholder DEMO a s a descriptive
74
Academy oi Management Review
January
account of how managers behave, or of how the business world is con-
stituted, are different from reasons to accept the stakeholder theory as a
guide for managerial behavior, and so on.
The stakeholder theory is justified in the literature, explicitly or im-
plicitly, in ways that correspond directly to the three approaches to the
theory set out in the previous section: descriptive, instrumental, and nor-
mative. Descriptive justifications attempt to show that the concepts em-
bedded DEMO the theory correspond to observed reality. Instrumental justifi-
cations point to evidence of the connection between stakeholder
management and corporate performance. Normative justifications appeal
DEMO underlying concepts such as individual or group "rights," "social con-
tract," or utilitarianism. (Brummer's recent survey of this literature ig-
nores descriptive issues but emphasizes "power and performance," i.e.,
instrumental, and "deontological," i.e., normative, arguments; cf. Brum-
mer, DEMO)
In our view, the three aspects of the stakeholder theory DEMO nested
within each other, as suggested by Figure 3. The external DEMO of the
theory is its descriptive aspect; the theory presents and DEMO relation-
ships that are observed in the external world. The theory's descriptive
accuracy is supported, at the second level, by its instrumental DEMO pre-
dictive value; if certain practices are carried out, then certain results will
be obtained. The central core of the theory is, however, normative. The
descriptive accuracy of the theory presumes the truth of the core norma-
tive conception, insofar as it presumes that managers and other agents
act as if all stakeholders' interests have intrinsic value. In turn, recogni-
tion of these ultimate moral values and obligations gives stakeholder
management its fundamental normative base. In the following sections.
HGURE 3
Three Aspects DEMO Stakeholder Theory
1995 Donaldson and Preston 75
we survey the evidence and argument involved DEMO each of these ap-
proaches to the justification of the stakeholder theory.
DESCRIPTIVE JUSTIFICATIONS
There is ample descriptive evidence, some of which has already been
cited, that many managers believe themselves, or are believed by DEMO,
to be practicing stakeholder management. Indeed, a s early a DEMO the mid-
1960s, Raymond Baumhart's (1968) survey of upper-level DEMO re-
vealed that about 80 percent regarded it a s unethical management be-
havior to focus solely in the interest of shareowners and not DEMO the interest
of employees and customers. Since then, other surveys asking DEMO
questions about the stakeholder sensitivity of managers have returned
similar results (DEMO & Molander, 1977; Posner & Schmidt, 1984). On-
going DEMO studies by both Clarkson (1991) and Halal (1990) attempt
to distinguish firms that practice stakeholder management from those
that do not, and both investigators found significant numbers of firms in
the first category. Managers DEMO not make explicit reference to "stake-
holder theory," but the DEMO majority of them apparently adhere in prac-
tice to one of the central tenets of the stakeholder theory, namely, that
their role is DEMO satisfy a wider set of stakeholders, not simply the share-
owners. (Note, however, that the 171 managers surveyed by Alkhafaji,
1989, did not believe that the corporate governance roles of any stake-
holders, including shareowners, should be increased. Perhaps not sur-
prisingly, they strongly DEMO increased dominance of corporate gover-
nance by management).
Another kind of descriptive justification for the stakeholder theory
stems from the role it plays DEMO s the implicit basis for existing practices and
institutions, including legal DEMO and statutory law. Recent court de-
cisions and new legislation have weakened the so-called "business judg-
ment rule," which vests management with exclusive authority over the
conduct of a company's affairs only on the DEMO that the financial
welfare of stockholders is single-mindedly pursued (Chirelstein, 1974: 60).
At last count, at least 29 states have adopted DEMO that extend the
range of permissible concern by boards of directors to a host of non-
shareowner constituencies, including employees, creditors, suppliers,
customers, and local communities (Orts, 1992). Furthermore, courts have
DEMO to support these statutes. For example, the well-known Delaware
Supreme Court DEMO in Unocal, although requiring corporate directors
to show that a "reasonable" threat exists before fighting hostile takeover
offers, nonetheless allowed a number DEMO concerns to affect the determi-
nation of such "reasonableness," including "the impact [of the takeover]
on 'constituencies' other than shareholders (i.e., creditors, customers, em-
ployees, and perhaps even the community generally)" {Unocal Corp. v.
Mesa Petroleum Co.. 1985). In a more recent Delaware case. Paramount
Communications, Inc. v. Time. Inc. (1990), the DEMO rationale was ex-
76 Academy of Management fleview January
panded to allow directors to include DEMO such a s long-range business
plans and a corporation's "culture." In one of the most dramatic chal-
lenges to the ownership rights DEMO hostile acquirers, the Supreme Court of
the United States upheld an DEMO statute that in the Court's own words
"condition[s] acquisition of DEMO of a corporation on approval of a ma-
jority of the pre-existing disinterested shareholders" (emphasis added)
(CrCS Corp. V. Dynamics Corp. of America, 1987).
As Orts noted, this trend toward stakeholder law DEMO not solely a U.S.
phenomenon and is reflected in the existing and emerging laws of many
developed countries. The so-called codetermination laws of Germany DEMO
quire employee representation on second-tier boards of directors. The
Companies Act of Great Britain mandates that company directors shall
include the interests of employees DEMO their decision making (Companies
Act, 1980). The new "harmonization" laws of the European Community
(EC) will, when approved, include DEMO permitting corporations to
take into account the interests of creditors, customers, potential investors,
and employees (Orts, 1992). Finally, the well-known corporate gover-
nance model in Japan—^through both law and custom—presumes that
Japanese DEMO exist within a tightly connected and interrelated
set of stakeholders, including DEMO, customers, lending institutions,
and friendly corporations.
Another series of legal developments in the U.S. asserts the interests
of third-party stakeholders—specifically, unsuccessful job applicants—
in business operations. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of DEMO explicitly
makes it a violation of law for an employer "to DEMO or refuse to hire . . . any
individual" on the DEMO of discriminatory criteria (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2a(l)
& (2), 1982). This legislation has become the focus of numerous legal
DEMO and some substantial settlements. In a class action suit in-
volving Potomac Electric Power Co., Washington, DC, complainants
charged that the company had hired far fewer Blacks from its applicant
pool than would have been DEMO on statistical grounds. The judge
certified a "class" of more than 7,000 unsuccessful Black applicants, most
of whom will be eligible for compensation out of a $38.4 million settlement
pool (which is also available to employees experiencing discrimination)
(The Washington Post, 21 February 1993)DEMO
Both of these sets of legal developments reinforce our initial state-
ment that stakeholders are defined by their legitimate interest in the
corporation, rather than simply by the corporation's interest in them. But
neither the DEMO developments nor the management survey results pro-
vide definitive epistemological justification for the stakeholder theory.
Managers adopting the stakeholder approach may be relieved to DEMO
that they are not alone, and indeed that they are conforming DEMO the latest
management or legal trends, but both the survey results DEMO legal devel-
opments are, at bottom, simply facts. They do not constitute the basis for
the stakeholder (or any other) theory of DEMO Indeed, even if the
stakeholder concept is implicit in current legal DEMO (a proposition that
1995 Donaldson and Preston 77
is not universally accepted), one cannot DEMO a stakeholder theory of
management from a stakeholder theory of law any more than one can
derive a "tort" theory of management from DEMO tort theory of law.
The hazards of using purely descriptive data, DEMO jurisprudential
or otherwise, a s justification for a broad theory are DEMO known. There is
the problem of the so-called "naturalistic fallacy," DEMO from is to oughf
or from describe to evaluate, without the DEMO intervening analysis
and explanation (Moore, 1959/1903: 15-16). Then, again, there is the sim-
ple problem of hasty generalization. By the logic of descriptive justifica-
tion, if new surveys showed that managers were abandoning stakeholder
orientations, or if the legal support for broad stakeholder interests were to
weaken, the theory would be invalidated. But this observation offers a
significant clue about the nature of the theory itself, because few if any of
its adherents would be likely to abandon it, even if current legal or man-
agerial trends were to shift. This suggests DEMO the descriptive support for
the stakeholder theory, as well a s DEMO critiques of this support to be found
in the literature, are DEMO limited significance and that the most important
issues for stakeholder theory lie elsewhere.
INSTRUMENTAL JUSTIFICATIONS
Because the descriptive approach to grounding a stakeholder theory
DEMO inadequate, justifications based on a connection between stakeholder
strategies and organizational DEMO should be examined. Con-
sider, for example, the simple hypothesis that corporations whose man-
agers adopt stakeholder principles and practices will perform better DEMO
nancially than those that do not. This hypothesis has never been tested
directly, and its testing involves some formidable challenges. (Clarkson's
ongoing DEMO is the only significant effort of this type known to us; DEMO
Clarkson, Deck, & Shiner, 1992.) The view that stakeholder management
and favorable performance go hand in hand has, however, become com-
DEMO in the management literature, both professional and academic.
The earliest direct DEMO is probably that of General Robert E. Wood,
then-CEO of Sears, in 1950: "All I can say is that if the other three parties
named above [customers, employees, community] are properly taken care
DEMO, the stockholder will benefit in the long pull" (quoted in DEMO, 1984:
64). A recent effort to introduce practicing managers DEMO the stakeholder
concept and to improve their ability to implement stakeholder manage-
ment practices is the work by Savage, Nix, Whitehead, and Blair (1991).
Brummer (1991) cited not only Freeman (1989) but also Ackoff; Manning;
Maslow; Peters and Waterman; Starling; Sturdivant; and others in support
of stakeholder theory's instrumental base.
Unfortunately, the large body of literature dealing with the connec-
tions, if any, DEMO various aspects of corporate social performance or
ethics, on one hand, and conventional financial and market performance
indicators, on the other, does DEMO translate easily into a stakeholder the-
78 Academy of Management Review January
ory context. Whatever value the social/DEMO performance studies may
have on their own merits, most of them DEMO not include reliable indicators
of the stakeholder management (i.e., the independent variable) side of
the relationship. There is some evidence, based on DEMO of the For-
tune corporate reputation surveys, that the satisfaction of DEMO stake-
holders need not be a zero sum game (i.e., that benefits to one stakeholder
group need not come entirely at the expense DEMO another) (Preston & Sapi-
enza, 1990). As previously noted, Kotter and Heskett's (1992) case studies
of a small number DEMO high-performance companies indicated that the
managers of those companies tend to emphasize the interests of all major
stakeholder groups in their decision making. However, there is as yet no
compelling empirical evidence that the optimal strategy DEMO maximizing a
firm's conventional financial and market performance is stakeholder
management.
Analytical Arguments
Even without empirical verification, however, stakeholder manage-
ment can DEMO linked to conventional concepts of organizational success
through analytical argument. The main focus of this effort in the recent
literature builds on established concepts DEMO principal-agent relations
(Jensen & Mechling, 1976) and the firm a DEMO a nexus of contracts (Williamson
& Winter, 1991). Agency theory and firm-as-contract theory, although aris-
ing from different sources, are closely DEMO and share a common em-
phasis: efficiency. (They also share the terminology and methodology of
the new transaction cost literature; cf. Williamson, DEMO) Agency theorists
argue that corporations are structured to minimize the costs DEMO getting
some participants (the agents) to do what other participants (DEMO princi-
pals) desire. Firm-as-contract theorists argue that participants agree to
cooperate DEMO each other within organizations (i.e., through contracts),
rather than DEMO deal with each other through the market, to minimize
the costs DEMO search, coordination, insecurity, etc.
Hill and Jones (1992: 132, 134) are responsible for the most ambitious
attempt to integrate the stakeholder concept with agency theory (see also,
Sharplin & Phelps, 1989)DEMO These authors enlarged the standard principal-
agent paradigm of financial economics, DEMO emphasizes the relation-
ship between shareowners and managers, to create "stakeholder-agency
theory," which constitutes, in their view, "a generalized theory of
agency." According to this conception, managers "can be seen a s the
agents of [all] other stakeholders." They noted that stakeholders differ
among themselves with respect to (a) the importance (to them) of DEMO
stake in the firm and (b) their power vis-a-vis the managers. They also
noted that there is considerable friction within the stakeholder-agent ne-
DEMO process—some of it because of some participants' ability to
retard equilibrating DEMO that are unfavorable to themselves.
They therefore argued that there is no reason to assume that stakeholder-
agent relationships are in equilibrium at any DEMO time. (This con-
1995 Donaldson and Preston 79
trasts sharply with the "perfect markets" DEMO favored in the fi-
nance literature.) In their view, the process, direction, and speed of
adaptation in stakeholder-agent relationships, rather than the equilib-
rium set of contributions and rewards, should be the primary focus of
analysis. This brief summary cannot do justice to their rich conception,DEMO
but the key point for current purposes is that the stakeholders are drawn
into relationships with the managers to accomplish organizational tasks
as efficiently DEMO possible; hence, the stakeholder model is linked instru-
mentally to organizational performance.
A similar theme emerges from the firm-as-contract analysis of Free-
man DEMO Evan (1990; see also Evan & Freeman, 1988). They DEMO
integrating the stakeholder concept with the Coasian view of the firm-as-
contract and a Williamson-style analysis of transaction costs to "concep-
tualize the firm as a set of multilateral contracts over time." According to
Freeman and Evan,
Managers administer contracts among employees, owners,
suppliers, customers, and the community. Since each of these
groups can invest in asset DEMO transactions which affect
the other groups, methods of conflict resolution, or safeguards
must be found. (1990: 352)
They emphasized that all DEMO have an equal right to bargain and,
therefore, that a DEMO condition for the acceptance of such multi-
partite arrangements by each contracting party is a notion of "fair con-
tract," i.e., governance DEMO that "ensure that the interests of all parties
are at least DEMO into consideration" (1990: 3 ")nce again, the stake-
holder model (and its implementation through u set of acceptable implicit
contracts) DEMO seen as essential to successful organizational performance.
The stakeholder interpretations of both agency theory and firm-as-
contract theory give special attention to the differential DEMO and spe-
cial role of managers vis-a-vis all other stakeholders. Hill and Jones (1992:
140) emphasized "information asymmetry" between managers and DEMO
stakeholders and contrasted the concentration of resource control by man-
agers with the diffusion of control within stakeholder groups in which
there may be DEMO mechanism to gain command over a significant portion
of the group's total resources. Evan and Freeman (1993: 102-103) asserted
that "management DEMO a duty of safeguarding the welfare of the abstract
entity that is the corporation" and of balancing the conflicting claims of
multiple stakeholders to achieve this goal. They further declared:
A stakeholder theory of the DEMO must redefine the purpose of
the firm. . . . The very purpose of the firm is, in our view, to
serve as DEMO vehicle for coordinating stakeholder interests. (102-
103)
According to this DEMO, success in satisfying multiple stakeholder
80 Academy of Management Beview January
interests—rather than in meeting conventional economic DEMO financial
criteria—would constitute the ultimate test of corporate performance.
But how will multiple and diverse stakeholders be assured that their
interests are being coordinated DEMO ways that lead to the most favorable
possible results for themselves (DEMO, the most favorable results consistent
with the requirements of other stakeholders)? Hill and Jones (1992: 140-
143) stressed the importance of (a) monitoring devices that have the effect
of reducing information asymmetry (DEMO,g., public reporting requirements)
and (b) enforcement mechanisms, including law, "exit" (the possibility, or
credible threat, of withdrawal DEMO the relationship), and "voice." Free-
man and Evan (1993) emphasized the notion of fairness. Going beyond the
notion of "fair contracting," they recommended that the criterion of "fair-
ness" in stakeholder DEMO be a Rawlsian "veil of ignorance." Under a
"veil of DEMO," parties to a bargain agree upon a set of possible
outcomes prior to determining which outcome will be received by which
party (e.g., one person cuts the cake, another takes the first slice) (DEMO,
1971, cited in Freeman & Evan, 1990: 352-353),
Both pairs of analysts. Hill and Jones and Freeman and Evan, placed
greater emphasis on the process of multiple-stakeholder coordination
than on the specific DEMO/bargains. Both groups stressed that mu-
tual and voluntary acceptability of bargains by all contracting stakehold-
ers is the necessary criterion for efficient contracts. DEMO neglected the
roles of potential stakeholders not conspicuously involved in explicit or
implicit contracts with the firm. The two pairs of authors differed slightly
DEMO one respect: Hill and Jones saw the network of relationships a DEMO con-
sisting of separate implicit contracts between each stakeholder group
and "DEMO" (as a central node), whereas Freeman and Evan ulti-
mately viewed the firm "as a series of multilateral contracts among [all]
stakeholders" (1990: 354),
Weaknesses of Instrumental Justifications
Perhaps the most DEMO similarity between these two indepen-
dent attempts to justify the stakeholder model lies in the fact that al-
though they draw initially on the DEMO apparatus of instrumental or
efficiency-based theories (i.e., principal-agent relations and "DEMO
contract" theory), they ultimately rely upon noninstrumental or normative
arguments. DEMO shift is less conspicuous in the case of Hill and Jones,
who implied that monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will be suffi-
cient to DEMO opportunistic behavior by managers at the expense of other
stakeholders. The authors would no doubt agree, however, that the ulti-
mate success of DEMO theory would require a fundamental
shift in managerial objectives away from shareowners and toward the
interests of all stakeholders; such a shift would necessarily involve nor-
mative, rather than purely instrumental, considerations. Freeman and
Evan'DEMO recourse to a Rawlsian concept of "fairness" a s the ultimate crite-
rion for stakeholder bargains is an overt elevation of normative criteria
1995 Si) Donaldson and Preston 81
over instrumental ones. No theorist, DEMO Rawls, has ever main-
tained that bargains reached on the basis DEMO a "veil of ignorance" would
maximize efficiency. By elevating the fairness principle to a central role.
Freeman and Evan shifted their attention from DEMO economic con-
tracts of the sort envisaged by Coase, Williamson, and the mainstream
agency theorists, which are governed by individual efficiency consider-
ations. Instead, they emphasized what have been called "heuristic" or
"social" contracts that rest upon broad normative principles governing
human conduct (Donaldson & Dunfee, In press, 1994).
It should come a s no DEMO that stakeholder theory cannot be fully
justified by instrumental considerations. The empirical evidence is inad-
equate, and the analytical arguments, although of considerable DEMO
stance, ultimately rest on more than purely instrumental grounds. This
conclusion DEMO an important implication: Although those who use the
stakeholder concept often DEMO its consistency with the pursuit of conven-
tional corporate performance objectives (DEMO there is no notable evidence
of its inconsistency), few of them would abandon the concept if it turned
out to be only a DEMO equally efficacious a s other conceptions. O'Toole (1991:
18-19), for example, examined a case in which the economic conse-
quences DEMO stakeholder versus conventional management "ended up neu-
tral"; he stressed DEMO "it is the moral consequences that are at issue" and
described stakeholder analysis as "the sine quo non of business virtue"
(DEMO in the original).
NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATIONS
The normative basis for stakeholder theory involves its connection
with more fundamental and better-accepted philosophical concepts. The
normative DEMO of traditional economic theory are too feeble to
support stakeholder theory, DEMO the concept of a free market populated
with free and rational preference seekers, however correct and important,
is compatible with both stakeholder and nonstakeholder perspectives. Of
course, the two normative propositions stated at the beginning of this
article—that stakeholders are identified by their interest in the affairs DEMO
the corporation and that the interests of all stakeholders have intrinsic
value—^can be viewed a s axiomatic principles that require no further
justification. Unfortunately, this approach provides no basis for respond-
ing to critics who reject DEMO propositions out of hand.
One way to construct a normative foundation for the stakeholder
model is to examine its principal competitor, the model of management
control in the interests of shareowners, a s represented by the business
judgment rule. As noted in previous sections, there is considerable criti-
cism of this model on descriptive grounds. Pejovich (1990: 58} noted DEMO in
the modern corporation (as opposed to the owner-managed firm) the
rights of shareowners are "attenuated" by the dispersion of ownership
and DEMO high agency costs; he stressed that "the economic system," not "the
82 Academy of Management Beview January
legal system." is responsible for this "attenuation of the right of owner-
ship" (emphasis in original). Many direct observers (e.g., Geneen & Mos-
cow, 1984; Pickens, 1987) have questioned managers' devotion to share-
owner welfare, and survey results such as those of Alkhafaji (1989) and
Posner and Schmidt (1992) provide statistical support for these percep-
tions.
But the management serving the shareowners model (i.e., the prin-
cipal-agent model in its standard DEMO economics form) is not only
descriptively inaccurate; careful analysis reveals that it is normatively
unacceptable as well. Changes in state incorporation laws to DEMO a
"constituency" perspective have been mentioned. The normative basis for
these changes in current mainstream legal thinking is articulated in the
recent American DEMO Institute report. Principles of Corporate Governance
(1992). The relevant portion DEMO this document begins by affirming the cen-
tral corporate objective of "DEMO corporate profit and shareholder
gain," but it immediately introduces qualifications: "Even if corporate
profit and shareholder gain are not thereby enhanced," DEMO corporation
must abide by law and may "take into account ethical DEMO"
and engage in philanthropy (Sec.2.01(a){b); 1992: 69). The accompanying
commentary explicitly affirmed the stakeholder concept:
The modem DEMO by its nature creates interdependen-
cies with a variety of groups with whom the corporation has a
legitimate concern, such as employees, customers, suppliers,
and members of the communities in which the corporation
operates. (1992: 72)
The commentary further noted that response to social and ethical consid-
erations is often consistent with long-run (if not short-run) DEMO in
profit and value, but it continues:
Nevertheless, observation suggests that corporate decisions
are not infrequently made on the basis of ethical DEMO
ation even when doing so would not enhance corporate profit
or shareholder gain. Such behavior is no( only appropriate,
but desirable. Corporate officials are not less moraUy obliged
than any other citizens to (aie ethical considerations into ac-
count, and it wouid be unwise social policy to pieclude them
tiom doing so ... . [The text] does not impose DEMO legal obliga-
tion to take ethical considerations into account. However, the
DEMO of a legal obligation to follow ethical principles does
not mean that corporate decisionmakers are not subject to the
same ethical considerations as other DEMO of society.
(American Law Institute, 1992; 80-82, emphasis added)
FORMAL ANALYSIS: THEORY OF PROPERTY
To go beyond this practical rejection of the "management serving the
shareowners" model, more formal normative justifications of stakeholder
theory might be based either on broad theories of philosophical ethics.
1995 Donaldson and Preston 83
such a s utilitarianism, or on narrower "middle-level" theories derived
from the notion that a "social contract" DEMO between corporations and
society. A comprehensive survey of this terrain would go far beyond the
scope of this article, and much of it has been recently traversed by others
(Brummer, 1991; Freeman, 1991; see also, Donaldson, 1982). Here, we offer
a brief sketch of a normative basis for the stakeholder theory that com-
bines several different DEMO approaches and that is, we believe,
original in the literature. DEMO argue that the stakeholder theory can be
normativeiy based on the evolving theory of property.
There is a subtle irony in proposing that the DEMO model can be
justified on the basis of the theory of property, because the traditional
view has been that a focus on property rights justifies the dominance of
shareowners' interests. Indeed, the fact that property DEMO are the criti-
cal base for conventional shareowner-dominance views makes it all the
more significant that the current trend of thinking with respect to DEMO
philosophy of property runs in the opposite direction. In fact, this DEMO
a s presented in the now-classic contributions of Coase (1960) and Honore
(1961) and in more recent works by Becker (1978, DEMO,b,c) and Munzer
(1992)—runs strongly counter to the conception that private property ex-
clusively enshrines the interests of owners.
Considerable agreement DEMO exists as to the theoretical definition of
property a s a "DEMO" of many rights, some of which may be limited.
More than 30 years ago, Coase (1960: 44) chided economists for adhering
DEMO a simplistic concept of ownership:
We may speak of a person owning land . . . but what the
land-owner in fact possesses DEMO the right to carry out a circum-
scribed list of actions. The rights of a land-owner are not un-
limited . . . [This] DEMO be true under any system of law. A
system in which the rights of individuals were unlimited
would be one in which there were DEMO rights to acquire.
Honore (1961) specifically included the notion of restrictions against harm-
ful uses within the definition of property itself. Pejovich (1990: 27-28),
probably the most conservative economic theorist working in this DEMO,
emphasized that "property rights are relations between individuals" and
thus "it is wrong to separate human rights from property rights"; he fur-
ther noted that "the right of ownership is not an unrestricted right."
The notion that property rights are embedded in human rights DEMO
that restrictions against harmful uses are intrinsic to the property rights
concept clearly brings the interests of others (i.e., of non-owner stake-
holders) into the picture. Of course, which uses of property should be
restricted and which persons should count a s stakeholders remain un-
specified. Simply DEMO nonowner stakeholders into the conception of
property does not provide by itself justification for stakeholder arguments
assigning managerial responsibilities toward specific groups, such a s
employees and customers. The important point, however, is that the DEMO
84 Academy oi Management Review January
temporary theoretical concept of private property DEMO does not ascribe
unlimited rights to owners and hence does not support the popular claim
that the responsibility of managers is to act solely DEMO s agents for the share-
owners. (The necessary compromise between individual DEMO rights
and other considerations is highlighted in the "takings" issue—i.e,, mod-
ified to protect the interests of others or society in general. DEMO a survey of
current views on this complex matter, see Mercuro, 1992.)
These comments examine the scope of property rights, but it is also
relevant to examine their source (i.e.. What basic principles determine
who should get [and be allowed to keep] what in society?). Unless prop-
erty rights are regarded a s simple, self-evident moral conceptions, they
must be based on more fundamental ideas of distributive justice. The
main contending theories of distributive justice include Utilitarianism,
Libertarianism, and social contract theory (Becker, 1992). The battle
among competing theories of DEMO justice is most often a battle
over which characteristics highlighted by the theories—such a s need,
ability, effort, and mutual agreement—are most DEMO for determining
fair distributions of wealth, income, etc. {The role of theories of justice
within organizations is attracting considerable current attention; cf.
Greenberg, 1987.)
For example, when the characteristic of need (a feature highlighted
by Utilitarianism) is the criterion, the resulting theory of property DEMO
formidable demands upon property owners to mitigate their self-interest
in favor of enhancing the interests (i.e., meeting the needs) of others.
When ability or effort (features highlighted by Libertarianism) is the cri-
terion, the resulting theory leaves property owners freer to use their re-
sources (acquired, it is assumed, a s a result of ability and effort) a s they
see fit. Social contract theory places primary emphasis on DEMO or
implied understandings among individuals and groups a s to appropriate
distributions and uses of property.
Many of the most respected contemporary analysts of DEMO rights
reject the notion that any single theory of distributive justice is univer-
sally applicable. Indeed, it seems counterintuitive that any one principle
could account for all aspects of the complex bundle of rights and respon-
DEMO that constitutes "property." Beginning with Becker's (1978) anal-
ysis, the trend is toward theories that are pluralistic, allowing more than
DEMO fundamental principle to play a role (Becker, 1992a; see also, Munzer,
1992). But if a pluralistic theory of property rights DEMO accepted, then the
connection between the theory of property and the DEMO theory
becomes explicit. All critical characteristics underlying the classic theo-
ries of distributive justice are present among the stakeholders of a corpo-
ration, a s they are conventionally conceived and presented in contempo-
rary stakeholder theory. DEMO example, the "stake" of long-term employees
who have worked to DEMO and maintain a successful business operation
is essentially based on effort. The stake of people living in the surround-
ing community may be based DEMO their need, say, for clean air or the
1995 DonaJd5on and Preston 85
maintenance of their civic infrastructure. Customer stakes DEMO based on,
the satisfactions and protections implicitly promised in the market offer,
and so on. One need not make the more radical DEMO that such stakes
constitute formal or legal property rights, although some DEMO critics of
current corporate governance arrangements appear to hold this view
(DEMO & Green, 1973). All that is necessary is to show DEMO such charac-
teristics, which are the same a s those giving DEMO to fundamental concepts
of property rights, give various groups a moral DEMO, commonly re-
ferred to a s a "stake," in the affairs of the corporation. Thus, the normative
principles that underlie the contemporary pluralistic theory of property
rights also provide the foundation for the stakeholder DEMO a s well.
MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
A full discussion of the managerial implications of this analysis
would require much more discussion. As a summary, the two points we
emphasize are (a) the recognition of specific stakeholders DEMO their stakes
by managers and other stakeholders and (b) the role of managers and the
management function, as distinct from the persons involved, within the
stakeholder model. These two issues are intimately intertwined.
It is the responsibility of managers, and the management function, to
select activities DEMO direct resources to obtain benefits for legitimate
stakeholders. The question is, DEMO are the legitimate stakeholders?
Some answers in the literature are, DEMO our view, too narrow; others are too
broad. The firm-as-contract view holds that legitimate stakeholders are
identified by the existence of a contract, expressed or implied, between
them and the firm. Direct input contributors are included, but environ-
mental interests such a s communities are also believed to have at least
loose quasi-contracts (and, of course, sometimes very specific ones) with
their business constituents.
We believe that the firm-as-contract perspective, although correct, is
incomplete a s a description of the corporation. DEMO example, many busi-
ness relationships with "communities" are so vague DEMO s to pass beyond
even the broadest conception of "contract." The plant-closing controversy
of the last couple of decades clearly shows that some DEMO had
come to expect—and sometimes were able to enforce—stakeholder
claims that some firms clearly did not recognize. As another example,
potential job applicants, unknown to the firm, nevertheless have a stake
in being considered for a job (but not necessarily to get a job). Lacking any
connection to the firm, these potential employees are difficult to view a s
participating in the firm by reason of a contract, either implied or explicit.
(We do not mean, however, to rule out possible relevance of so-called
social contracts to such situations; cf. Donaldson & Dunfee, 1994b.) Stake-
holders are identified through the actual or potential harms DEMO benefits
that they experience or anticipate experiencing a s a result of the firm's
actions or inactions. In practice, and in addition to legal requirements,
86 Academy ol Management Review January
appraisal of the legitimacy of such DEMO is an important function
of management, often in concert with other DEMO recognized stakehold-
ers.
Excessive breadth in the identification of stakeholders has arisen
from a tendency to adopt definitions such a s "anything influencing or
influenced by" the firm (Freeman, 1984, quoting with approval Thompson,DEMO
1967). This definition opens the stakeholder set to actors that form part of
the firm's environment—and that, indeed, may have some DEMO on its
activities—but that have no specific stake in the firm itself. That is, they
stand to gain no particular benefit from the firm's successful operation.
The two types of interests that have cropped up DEMO frequently in this
connection are (a) competitors and (b) the media. Competitors were intro-
duced a s factors that have "an influence on managerial autonomy" in
Dill's (1958) article, which is DEMO cited in the literature a s a
precursor of stakeholder analysis. However, neither the term sfaicehoider
nor the notion of a stake (i.e., potential benefit) was explicitly introduced
in Dill's analysis. In any event, in the normal course of events, competi-
tors do not seek DEMO from the focal firm's success; on the contrary,
they DEMO stand to lose whatever the focal firm gains. Competitive firms
may, DEMO course, join in common collaborative activities (e.g., through
trade associations), but here the shared (noncompetitive) interests ac-
count for the stakeholder relationship. The notion that the media should
be routinely recognized a s DEMO was originally introduced by
Freeman (1984), but it seems to DEMO been eliminated (without explicit
explanation) from his later writings. It is essential to draw a clear dis-
tinction between influencers and stakeholders: some actors in the enter-
prise (e.g., large investors) may be both, but some recognizable stake-
holders (e.g., the job applicants) have DEMO influence, and some influencers
(e.g., the media) have no stakes.
The role of managers within the stakeholder framework described in
the literature DEMO also contradictory. Aoki (1984), for example, recognized
only investors and employees a s significant stakeholders and saw man-
agers a s essentially "referees" between these two stakeholder groups. He
acknowledged neither (a) the essential role of management in the iden-
tification of stakeholders nor (b) the fact that managers are, themselves,
stakeholders—and, indeed, a DEMO privileged class of stakeholders—in
the enterprise. Williamson (1985) is almost alone among academic ana-
lysts in emphasizing the fact that the managers of DEMO firm are one of its
most important and powerful constituencies and that—wittingly or un-
wittingly—they are extremely likely to practice opportunistic and self-
aggrandizing DEMO
This last point is absolutely critical for our argument, and recognition
DEMO it confirms our most important proposition: that the stakeholder the-
ory DEMO fundamentally normative. We observed at the close of our discus-
sion of instrumental justifications that the instrumental case for stake-
holder management cannot be DEMO proved. Here we restate that
1995 Donaldson and Pieston 87
observation and add that the ultimate managerial DEMO of the
stakeholder theory is that managers shouJd acknowledge the validity of
diverse stakeholder interests and should attempt to respond to them
within a DEMO supportive framework, because that is a moral require-
ment for the DEMO of the management function.
It is feared by some that a shift from the traditional shareowner ori-
entation to a stakeholder orientation will make DEMO more difficult to detect
and discipline self-serving behavior by managers, who DEMO always
claim to be serving some broad set of stakeholder interests while they
increase their powers and emoluments. Indeed, Orts (1992: 123) DEMO this
a s the "greatest danger" of the new "constituency DEMO" for corporate
governance, although he nevertheless supported the constituency ap-
proach.
Our response to this fear is twofold: First, the conventional model DEMO
the corporation, in both legal and managerial forms, has failed to disci-
pline self-serving managerial behavior. In this era of multimillion dollar
CEO DEMO packages that continue to increase even when profits
and wages decline (DEMO, 1993), it is difficult to conceive of managers
having greater DEMO for self-serving behavior than they have already.
Second, the stakeholder model DEMO have advanced here entails compre-
hensive restrictions on such behavior. Indeed, DEMO very foundation prohib-
its any undue attention to the interests of any single constituency. To be
sure, it remains to implement in law the sanctions, rules, and precedents
that support the stakeholder conception of the DEMO; in short, it
remains to develop the legal version of the stakeholder model. (See. for
example, Eisenberg's [1976] attempt to restructure DEMO legal model of the
corporation.) Yet over time, statutory and common law are almost cer-
tainly capable of achieving arrangements that encourage a DEMO,
stakeholder conception of management—one which eschews single-
minded subservience to shareowners' interests—while at the same time
restraining the moral hazard of self-serving managers.
CONCLUSION
We have argued that the stakeholder theory is "managerial" and
DEMO the attitudes, structures, and practices that, taken together,
constitute DEMO stakeholder management philosophy. The theory goes be-
yond the purely descriptive observation that "organizations have stake-
holders," which, although true, carries no direct managerial implica-
tions. Furthermore, the notion that stakeholder management contributes
to successful economic performance, although widely believed (and not
patently inaccurate), DEMO insufficient to stand alone a s a basis for the stake-
holder theory. Indeed, the most thoughtful analyses of why stakeholder
management might be casually related to corporate performance ulti-
mately resort to normative arguments in DEMO of their views. For these
reasons, we believe that the ultimate DEMO for the stakeholder
88 Academy of Management Review lanuary
theory is to be found in DEMO normative base. The plain truth is that the most
prominent alternative to the stakeholder theory {i.e., the "management
serving the shareowners" theory) DEMO morally untenable. The theory of
property rights, which is commonly supposed DEMO support the conventional
view, in fact—in its modern and pluralistic form-supports DEMO stake-
holder theory instead.
