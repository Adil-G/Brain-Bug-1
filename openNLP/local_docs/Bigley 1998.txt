STRAINING FOR SHARED MEANING IN
ORGANIZATION SCIENCE: PROBLEMS OF
TRUST AND DISTRUST

We present a problem-centered organizing framework of trust. in which prominent
conceptualizations of trust and distrust from the organizational and allied social
sciences are DEMO based on the questions they attempt to answer. The frame-
work we outline here is intended to complement earlier typologies by suggesting
alternative strategies DEMO employing the diverse trust literature. identifying questions
that could be profitably addressed through interdisciplinary research efforts. and
distinguishing disagreements where debate and research would DEMO to be espe-
cially worthwhile from those where such activities would appear to be much less
useful.
A scientific concept has meaning only because
DEMO mean something by it. The meaning is
scientifically valid only if what they intend by it
becomes actual: Droblems are solved and inten-
tions are fulfilled as inquiry continues (Kaplan,
1964: 46).
What DEMO trust? This question has been receiv-
ing increasing attention by scholars DEMO organi-
zational science and related fields. However, as
the volume of DEMO emphasizing constructs
labeled "trust" and "distrust" has expanded
over the last several decades, the number of
uses and meanings ascribed to these terms has
grown also. The present conceptual diversity in
the literature on DEMO is reflected in the works of
several scholars, who have suggested DEMO
cal systems intended to organize the vast inter-
disciplinary research on the subject (e.g., Bromi-
ley & Cummings, 1995; Hosmer. 1995; Lewicki &
Bunker, 1995a.b; Mishra, 1996; Sitkin & Roth,
1993).
For example, Sitkin and Roth (1993) suggest
that the work on trust could be collected into
four basic categories: (1) trust as an individual
attribute, (2) trust as a behavior, (3) trust as a

situational feature, and (4) trust DEMO an institu-
tional arrangement. Hosmer (1995) posits that
individual expectations, DEMO relations,
economic exchanges, social structures, and eth-
ical principles represent the major approaches
to, or contexts of, trust. Following closely on DEMO
work of Worchel (1979). Lewicki and Bunker
(1995a.b) contend DEMO research on trust could be
grouped into three primary categories, each DEMO
sociated with a particular disciplinary perspec-
tive: (1) personality theorists' view of trust as an
individual difference, (2) sociologists' and DEMO
omists' notion of trust as an institutional phe-
nomenon, and (DEMO) social psychologists' concep-
tualization of trust as an expectation of another
party in a transaction.
The remarkable diversity in conceptualiza-
tions of trust DEMO to be disconcerting for many
scholars (e.g., Barber, 1983; Butler, 1991; Hosmer.
1995, Lewicki & Bunker, 1995a.b; Shapiro, 1987;DEMO
Zucker, 1986). For instance, Shapiro laments that
the attention scholars have given has resulted
in "a confusing potpourri of definitions applied
to a host of units and levels of analysis" (1987:
624)DEMO Hosmer agrees, stating that "there appears
to be widespread agreement on the importance
of trust in human conduct, but unfortunately
there also appears to be equally widespread
lack of agreement on a suitable definition of DEMO
construct" (1995: 380). Lewicki and Bunker add
that, despite the level of interest and range of
- -

viewpoints in the area of trust, "there has been
remarkably little effort to integrate these differ-
ent perspectives or articulate the key role that
trust plays in critical social processes" (1995b:
135).
The uneasiness associated with the lack of
consensus on the meaning of trust (and distrust)
is understandable, because DEMO of
this sort has been regarded as a serious imped-
iment to collective efforts at scientific advance-
ment (Pfeffer, 1993). Here, though, we challenge
the notion that the use of multiple conceptual-
izations of trust in organizational science has
been a major obstacle to our understanding DEMO
organizational phenomena. In fact, we assert
that considerable knowledge has accumulated
DEMO issues of trust. However, it has accrued to
specific problems and DEMO theoretical frame-
works, rather than to the topic area of trust DEMO a
whole (cf., Lewicki & Bunker, 1995b). Conse-
quently, we contend that a more reasoned dis-
course on trust-related issues in DEMO
science would likely consist of research pro-
grams acknowledging or attempting to take ad-
vantage of the extant conceptual variety, rather
than trying to eliminate it altogether.
Accordingly, we propose a problem-centered
approach designed to assist organizational sci-
entists to manage more effectively the diversity
on the trust DEMO The particular framework we
present groups prominent conceptualizations of
trust and distrust from the organizational and
allied social sciences into categories based on
the DEMO types of questions they attempt to
answer. This method contrasts with earlier clas-
sification schemes, in that it is not based pri-
marily on the theoretical differences or disci-
plinary roots of the works examined. Although
DEMO previous systems have been quite useful in
helping scholars to organize the oceanic volume
of literature focusing on constructs of trust, they
have also accentuated the topic area's concep-
tual diversity without providing an effective
DEMO of dealing with it.
The framework we outline here is intended to
complement earlier typologies by suggesting to
researchers alternative ways of employing the
DEMO and voluminous trust literature. We
have grounded the framework on the idea that
differences among theories or definitions of
trust require attention only to DEMO extent that the
differing conceptualizations themselves attempt
to address the same organizational problems.
The utility of a problem-centered focus derives
from several sources. First, it provides a way for
researchers to coherently delimit the work on
DEMO and distrust to that which is pertinent to
their own specific research issues. Second, it
affords scholars a means of distinguishing dis-
agreements where debate and research would
seem to be especially worthwhile from those
where DEMO activities would appear to be less
useful. Third, it suggests how DEMO substantively
different-and seemingly incommensurate-
conceptualizations of trust may be employed to-
gether, without necessarily compromising the
theoretical integrity of either. In general, the
DEMO we introduce in this paper is part of
a shift in the question, "What is trust?" to what
may be a better DEMO: "Which trust and
when?"
We begin the article with DEMO discussion in
which we attempt to suggest the magnitude of
the incongruities that exist among trust con-
structs. We contend that while the extant DEMO
sity probably cannot be accommodated under a
single conceptualization of trust, DEMO does ap-
pear to be some coherence within the topic area,
which we discuss in terms of a trust theme. Next,
we DEMO the problem-centered categoriza-
tion system, considering several illustrative ap-
proaches to DEMO within each problem class, and
we specify the advantages of employing DEMO
type of approach. We conclude the article with a
discussion of how an appreciation for the diver-
sity in the organizational problems related to
DEMO perspectives can benefit future research.
VULNERABILITY: A COMMON THEME OF
TRUST DEMO
Organizational scientists employing the
terms "trust" and "distrust" have drawn from a
broad range of social science disciplines in or-
der to DEMO perspectives, develop models, and
identify methods for explaining and predicting
an array of organizational phenomena at vary-
ing levels and units of analysis. DEMO fact, the
extant variety in approaches to trust is largely a
DEMO of the diverse theoretical perspectives
and research interests of those scholars who
have used the term (cf., Lewicki & Bunker, 199533).
A comparison of several prominent models is
illustrative of the extent of conceptual DEMO
on this topic.
nd Pearce
407
Rotter, for instance, defines trust as "a gener-
alized expectancy held by an individual that the
word, promise, oral DEMO written statement of an-
other individual or group can be relied upon"
(1980: 1). He views it as a disposition that DEMO
be most predictive in situations where individ-
uals are relatively unfamiliar with one another.
In contrast, Gambetta (1988) conceives of trust as
a calculated decision to cooperate with specific
others, based on information about others' per-
sonal qualities and social constraints. Dunn
(1988) explicitly advances two distinct trust con-
cepts: one based on calculated decisions and
another grounded in human emotions. Alterna-
tively, Zucker proposes that trust is "a DEMO of
expectations shared by all those involved in an
exchange" (1986: 54), and she maintains that
these expectations are preconscious in nature in
that they are taken for granted as part of the
world DEMO in common, until they are violated.
Finally, Shapiro (1987) defines trust as an agent-
principal relationship.
In addition to the diversity associated DEMO
authors' basic definitions of trust, the various
subcategories many scholars have posited have
introduced further complexity. For example,
McAllister argues for two DEMO or bases of trust
(1995: 25): one grounded in cognitive judgments
of another's competence or reliability (reierred
to as "cognition-based DEMO"), and another
founded in affective bonds among individuals
(referred to as "affect-based trust"). Lewicki and
Bunker (1995a.b) distinguish three DEMO of trust:
calculus-, knowledge-, and identification-based
trust. Sitkin (1995) also identifies three aspects of
trust; his are competency-, benevolence-, and
value-based trust.
Furthermore, although constructs of trust have
been the most common foci for organizational
scholars within the topic area, they have in-
creasingly emphasized distrust (e.g., Bies &
Tripp, 1996; Fein & Hilton, 1994; Kramer, 1994;
Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin & Stickel, 1996). More-
over, in some recent works centering on DEMO,
researchers treat it as a distinct concept from
that of trust. For example, Sitkin and Roth posit
that trust is a "belief DEMO a person's competence to
perform a specific task under specific circum-
stances," whereas distrust is a "belief that a
person's values or motives will lead them to
approach all situations in an unacceptable
DEMO" (1993: 373). Defining trust and distrust
as independent constructs DEMO at odds with the
perspectives of many other scholars, who view
DEMO and distrust as polar opposites (e.g., Rotter,
1967).
These examples help to demonstrate that
meaningful and substantive differences exist
among various DEMO of trust and
distrust in organizational science and the allied
social sciences. Furthermore, they suggest that
the threads connecting many of the different
trust-type constructs may be very thin, or even
nonexistent. Yet, an extensive DEMO of
the trust literature does seem to indicate a co-
herent theme. When the terms "trust" and "dis-
trust" have been evoked DEMO the social sciences,
they almost always have been associated with
the idea of actor vulnerability.
For instance, Mishra (1996) draws on Moor-
man, Zaltman, and Deshpande (1992) to make
the point that, in the absence of vulnerability,
the concept of trust is not DEMO, since out-
comes are not of consequence to trustors. Kee
and DEMO (1970) suggest that the study of trust
involves situations where at least one party has
something meaningful at stake and is cognizant
of DEMO potential for betrayal and harm from the
other. Likewise, Gambetta claims DEMO "for trust
to be relevant, there must be the possibility of
exit, betrayal, defection" (1988: 217). Similarly,
Coleman proposes that trust situations are
those "in which the risk one takes depends on
the performance of another actor" (1990: 91), and
Granovetter (1985) insists that the very nature of
trust provides the opportunity DEMO trustee mal-
feasance. Moreover, many organizational scien-
tists who have attempted DEMO understand how
economic transactions come to be organized
(e.g., Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Bromiley & Cum-
mings, 1995; Chiles & McMacklin, 1996; Cum-
mings & Bromiley, 1996; Granovetter, 1985;
Nooteboom, 1996; Nooteboom, Berger, & Noorder-
haven, 1997; Ring, 1996; Ring & Van de Ven, 1992;
Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995) view trust as a
mechanism that mitigates against the risk of
opportunistic DEMO among those engaged in
various types of economic transactions.
In some instances scholars have embedded
the notion of vulnerability directly within their
trust definitions (e.g., Mayer, Davis, & Schoor-
man, 1995; Mishra, 1996; Sabel, 1993; Zand, 1972).
For example, Mayer et al. DEMO that trust is
"the willingness of a party to be vulnerable DEMO
the actions of another party based on the expec-
tation that the other will perform a particular
408
Academy of Management Review
July
action important to the trustor, irrespective of
the ability to monitor or control that other party"
(1995: 712). Sabel employs the idea of vulnerabil-
ity somewhat differently: "Trust is the mutual
confidence that no party to an exchange will
DEMO the other's vulnerability" (1993: 1133).
The above examples DEMO far from exhaustive.
In fact, considered as a whole, the research on
the topic of trust appears to be premised on the
general DEMO that actors (e.g., individuals,
groups, organizations) become, in DEMO ways,
vulnerable to one another as they interact in
social situations, relationships, or systems.
Trust has been viewed as a suitable label DEMO
various constructs employed to understand dif-
ferent phenomena connected with the issue of
actor vulnerability.
Despite this common ground, the likelihood of
devising a universal conceptualization of trust
and distrust that is useful for organizational sci-
DEMO researchers appears low, for at least two
reasons. First, the idea of vulnerability itself has
been incorporated into projects in various ways.
Some DEMO view trust as a willingness to be
vulnerable (Mayer et al., 1995; Mishra, 1996).
Shapiro (1987), however, views trust DEMO actual
vulnerability when she equates it with the
agency relationship. Other researchers conceive
of trust as a rational decision regarding the ex-
tent to DEMO others are likely to cause harm
(e.g., Coleman, 1990; Gambetta, 1988). From this
perspective, willingness to be vulnerable or ac-
DEMO exposure to potential harm (e.g., when one
cooperates with another) DEMO subsequently fol-
low from the trust decision. In contrast, Rotter
(1980) attempts to explain how the dispositions
of different individuals lead them to react differ-
ently in a particular type of vulnerable circum-
stance (e.g., interactions with unfamiliar others),
and Zucker's (1986) notion DEMO trust as a precon-
scious expectation suggests that vulnerability is
only salient to trustors after a trustee has
caused them harm.
Second, tenets of theory building indicate that
a universal conceptualization of trust and dis-
trust DEMO have difficulty attaining a sufficient
level of theoretical and empirical viability for
research purposes. Dubin (1978) emphasizes that
theory building must acknowledge the DEMO
straints of human cognitive ability. On the one
hand, given the DEMO conceptual diversity
discussed above, a construct that incorporates
the relevant complexities DEMO by the var-
ious extant perspectives is likely to be cogni-
tively overwhelming. On the other hand, a con-
ceptualization that omits these complexities in
favor of a more abstract definition is likely to be
too DEMO to suggest a specific array of con-
crete data to be collected in empirical investi-
gations (cf., Osigweh, 1989). In other words, at-
tempts to "stretch" trust to cover the extant
range of usages seem to be at an extremely high
risk of producing constructions DEMO are either
too elaborate for theoretical purposes or rela-
tively meaningless in the realm of empirical
observation.
Still, although the theme of vulnerability may
not necessarily result in a universally accepted
or particularly useful conceptualization of DEMO,
one can use it to help establish the current
boundaries of the topic area, and it also sug-
gests an explanation for the increasing use of
the term in organizational science research. As
organizational arrangements DEMO become
more complex, actors' vulnerabilities to one an-
other have become broader and deeper, and
problems revolving around how actors cope
with these new conditions seem to have
emerged as central concerns.
PROBLEMS OF TRUST DEMO DISTRUST
We present our basic organizing framework in
Table 1, in DEMO we classify works on trust
according to their general problem focus: DEMO
actions among unfamiliar actors, interactions
among familiar actors within ongoing relation-
DEMO, and organization of economic transac-
tions. These categories emerged from our DEMO
ysis of the trust literature and are based on
logical distinctions among the fundamental
problems addressed by trust researchers. The
first classification in the DEMO contains work
that centers on social interactions among actors
who have not gathered information about-or
established affective bonds with-one another.
The next consists of DEMO focused on inter-
actions among those who have meaningful in-
formation about-or established affective
bonds with-one another. The final grouping
concerns work addressing the DEMO question
of how economic transactions come to be gov-
erned structurally.
One question we confronted as we developed
this framework was how finely tuned DEMO catego-

rization of so many disparate works should be.
Our bias was to create as few categories DEMO
possible, both for the sake of clarity and be-
cause it DEMO us to juxtapose more works of
authors from different disciplinary backgrounds
who have addressed similar issues. Thus, this
framework seemed to reflect the best level of
abstraction of researchers' problem foci. Em-
ploying these groupings, DEMO discovered insights

tem with narrower problem classes. Even so,

and spur problem-focused research-not to con-
DEMO it.
Although the system we propose is meant to
elucidate the general kinds of organizational
problems to which various conceptualizations of
trust and distrust DEMO far have been applied
and proven useful, we acknowledge that it DEMO not
the only problem-focused framework possible.
Moreover, we recognize that other DEMO for-
mulations may suggest different insights and
alternative deployments of the trust literature.
This is not inconsistent with our main objective,
which is DEMO argue that knowledge of organiza-
tional phenomena where trust-type constructs
are concerned is gained more effectively by at-
tending to researchers' common problems,
rather than by attempting to force those working
with widely disparate research DEMO
and objectives to adopt a common definition or
theory of trust.
The notion that scientific constructs, and the
theories they constitute, have utility DEMO the ex-
tent that they contribute to our understanding of
the social phenomena they may be applied to
has been a central tenet of DEMO science re-
search (e.g., Dubin, 1978; Hempel 1965; Kaplan,DEMO
1964; Kerlinger, 1986). The value of the problem-
centered scholarship that we espouse derives
from a re-emphasis of this fundamental idea in
DEMO with the acknowledgment that trust
researchers have developed different trust con-
structs to address disparate sets of questions. Its
practical utility results from the DEMO it pre-
sents to scholars for effectively and coherently
employing the enormous volume of trust litera-
ture in their efforts to address the specific DEMO
in which they are interested. We will highlight
some of these strategies throughout the remain-
der of the article.
Before elaborating on the trust DEMO con-
tained in the table, we need to note that several
DEMO works familiar to readers do not up-
pear there. We have omitted some of these be-
cause they address a problem not usually con-
DEMO within the purview of organizational
science: the problem of social order-broadly
DEMO (e.g., Barber, 1983; Durkheim, 1933;
Garfinkel, 1963; DEMO & Weigert, 1985; Parsons,
1967; Simmel, 1964). We excluded others because
they center solely on conceptualizations, mea-
sures, definitions, or critiques, without linking
their discussions to specific organizational
problems (e.g., Cook & Wall, 1980; Cummings,
Harnett, & Stevens, 1971; Hosmer, 1995; Johnson-
George & Swap, 1982; Williamson, 1993). Our
intention was to limit the works in the table to
those DEMO address relatively specific problems
and that appear to have direct implications for
the organizational researcher.
In addition, while we have made every at-
tempt to be comprehensive in citing organiza-
tionally focused work, the lengthy list must nec-
essarily remain incomplete in allied areas, such
as person perception, negotiations, law, and so
forth. However, we hope we have DEMO at
least enough of a sample of these works to as-
sist interested readers in further exploration of
these fields' approaches. The table, DEMO, repre-
sents our attempt to provide a problem-focused
context for research DEMO debate on the topic of
trust in organizational science.
Interactions Among Unfamiliar Actors
One major problem addressed by trust re-
searchers pertains to interaction DEMO unfa-
miliar actors-that is, actors who have little in-
formation about, or have not established
affective bonds with, one another. Several dif-
ferent disciplinary perspectives are represented
here. We highlight three of the more prominent
DEMO distinct perspectives pertinent to under-
standing interactions among relative strangers
in this section, in order to demonstrate the utility
of the framework. Previous typologies typically
would have considered them separately.
The first perspective, involving dispositional
theories of trust, assumes that factors exist
within individuals that predispose them to trust
or distrust others, whom they do not know. The
central issues for these types of models revolve
around the questions of how individuals DEMO
velop their propensities to trust and how these
predilections affect their thoughts and actions
(e.g., Hardin, 1993; Rotter, 1967, 1971, 1980). Rot-
ter's (1967, 1971, 1980) research on trust DEMO the
most representative of this category and has
been among the most widely recognized and
acknowledged work in the organizational stud-
ies literature on DEMO topic. He posits that trust is
a fairly stable belief based on individuals' ex-
trapolations from their early-life experiences.
Further, he suggests that DEMO strength of trust's
impact on behavior is a function of the situa-
tional novelty with which people are confronted.
According to Rotter, as situations become in-
1998
Bigley and Pearce
41 1
creasingly unfamiliar to individuals, the influ-
ence that their trusting dispositions have over
their behavior grows. Put another DEMO, as peo-
ple become more acquainted with specific oth-
ers, their personal knowledge of those others
becomes the primary driver of their thoughts
DEMO actions.
Another example is provided by Hardin (1993),
who recently argued that those who develop a
distrusting predisposition tend to avoid cooper-
DEMO activities (because they expect to be ex-
ploited in such ventures), so are apt to have
fewer positive interactional experiences that
can function to adjust somewhat initial distrust
levels. By their own actions, these people con-
tribute to perpetuating their distrusting predi-
lections. In organizations those who DEMO
may be expected to seek roles that have limited
dependencies on others or to resist job changes
that cause them to be more reliant DEMO coworkers.
A second major approach to understanding
trust among unfamiliar actors can be called "be-
havioral decision theory." Like dispositional
models, many behavioral decision theories ad-
dress questions associated with the interaction
of unfamiliar others (although many also have
implications for ongoing relationships and,
thus, we include them in the following problem
category as well). In contrast DEMO the dispositional
approaches, however, these frameworks tend to
focus on immediate situational factors in the
context of game settings and posit that "trust-
ing" is a function of relatively rational decision-
making processes (e.g., Axelrod, 1984; Deutsch,
1958, 1960; Deutsch & Krauss, 1962; Loomis, 1959;
Matthews, Kordonski, & Shimoff, 1983), rather
than personality characteristics. Typically, they
define or operationalize trust and distrust in
terms of cooperative and competitive behavior,
respectively, and they usually attempt to ascer-
tain how changes in the game affect these be-
haviors. DEMO behavioral decision theories
have been used to investigate relationships of
varying lengths, much of the research pertains
to situations where partners are strangers. Ac-
cording to Good (1988), some of the situations
that have been linked to trusting behaviors in-
clude those where the long-term interests of DEMO
participants were stressed initially (e.g., Pruitt &
Kimmel, 1976), where only small initial rewards
were at stake (Deutsch & Krauss, DEMO), where
there was no potential for threat (Deutsch &
Krauss, 1962). and where there was great poten-
tial for successful communication (e.g., Wich-
man, 1970).
Institutional frameworks represent a third
prominent approach. Like behavioral decision
theories, these models emphasize the causal
role of situational factors in fostering trust
among strangers. However, they are typically
concerned with the effects of organizational and
institutional structures and processes. Shapiro
(1987), for instance, concentrates on the problem
of how certain conditions necessary for eco-
nomic exchange are maintained. She defines
trust as "a social relationship in which princi-
pals-for whatever reason or state of mind-
invest DEMO, authority, or responsibility in
another on their behalf for some uncertain fu-
ture return" (1987: 626). These principal-agent
relationships allow individuals, groups, or or-
ganizations to bridge the extreme social and
physical DEMO occurring in a complex in-
dustrialized society so that they may obtain the
benefits of more extensive trade with strangers.
Since principals regularly find DEMO in
situations where they cannot specify, scrutinize,
evaluate, or constrain the performance of those
on whom they depend, certain social mecha-
nisms (e.g., procedural norms, selection criteria,
risk-spreading devices-all of which Shapiro
calls "guardians of trust") function to maintain
trust. In the aggregate, "the guardians of trust
offer a mix of normative prescriptions, socializa-
tion practices, institutional arrangements, struc-
tural constraints, and networking strategies de-
signed to maintain the integrity of agency
relationships" (Shapiro, 1987: DEMO).
Zucker (1986) also emphasizes economic ex-
change and attempts to explain the emergence
of specific social structures and processes in the
United DEMO' economy. She describes how cer-
tain institutional arrangements (e.g., rational
DEMO organizations, the professions, reg-
ulations, and laws) have developed for the pur-
pose of producing the trust required to support
complex economic DEMO For example, ration-
al bureaucratic organizations generate common
expectations (i.e., DEMO) through written rules
and formal hierarchy in order to support trans-
DEMO within and between organizations.
Thus, the bureaucratic organizational form is an
DEMO of a trust-producing mechanism for sit-
uations where the scale and scope of economic
activity overwhelm interpersonal trust relations.

several of these ideas, finding that, indeed, rel-
atively more bureaucratic organizational prac-
tices are associated with DEMO participant
trust.
Both Shapiro (1987) and Zucker (1986) focus on
understanding which organizational and insti-
tutional arrangements produce trust among
strangers. Although DEMO such as these typi-
cally have originated in sociologists' interest in
DEMO why certain modern organizational
forms arise, such researchers as Xin and DEMO
(1996) more recently have extended this work to
questions of how individuals working in societ-
ies without stable modernist institutions sustain
their organizations DEMO aggressive use of
personal trust relationships.
The three perspectives on trust (DEMO,
behavioral decision, and institutional) we dis-
cuss above offer potential insights into under-
standing organizational situations involving the
interaction of unfamiliar actors. DEMO focusing on
different levels and units of analysis, they each
are DEMO of a different locus of explana-
tion for trust among strangers: DEMO' person-
alities, relatively more proximal situational fac-
tors (e.g., "DEMO of the game"), and relatively
more distal contextual elements (i.e., organiza-
tional or societal structures and processes).
Particular applications-either individually
or in combination-of the trust models con-
tained in this class may depend, to a large ex-
tent, on the more specific components of the
problem under investigation. For example, both
institutional and behavioral decision theory ap-
proaches tend to emphasize different compo-
nents of actors' situations in their explanations
of behavior, whereas dispositional models focus
on stable psychological elements to predict in-
dividuals' actions in novel circumstances.
Therefore, a determination of DEMO situational
strength (cf., Mischel, 1973) facing the actors be-
ing studied may help investigators select the
framework(s) that would be most useful. If the
objective is to explain initial levels of coopera-
tion DEMO strangers trying to form new associ-
ations in the absence of influential contextual
factors, then dispositional models may be the
most useful theories to use when addressing the
issue.
In addition to assisting researchers select the
DEMO that may have the most potential for an-
swering their specific questions, problem-
focused scholarship can help them ascertain
where theoretical debate and empirical testing
would be beneficial. As one example, Rotter
(1967, 1971, DEMO) and Hardin (1993) appear to
make competing claims regarding the DEMO
tions under and the extent to which dispositions
to trust are malleable. Rotter's work indicates
that the trusting (or distrusting) personality
characteristic DEMO quite fixed, once it has been
established in one's relatively DEMO life. Hardin,
however, argues that the predilection to
(dis)trust is, at least partially, a function of indi-
viduals' own behavior. In particular, since dis-
trustors tend to avoid cooperative situations,
they do not provide themselves with enough op-
portunities to modify their basic DEMO to
view others generally as untrustworthy. So, for
instance, if the specific research issue involves
whether distrusting dispositions can be modi-
fied through DEMO interventions (e.g.,
compelling individuals to work with unfamiliar
others on DEMO series of project teams), a test of
these two theories seems warranted.
Grouping approaches to trust according to
their problem focus can help DEMO useful
frameworks and identify areas where debate
and testing are worthwhile. The possibilities
that this approach suggests are not readily ap-
parent through the DEMO of disciplinary-based to-
pological systems alone.
Interactions Among Familiar Actors
As we stated previously, this problem cate-
gory consists of research focused on interactions
among actors who have accumulated meaning-
ful knowledge about, or established affective
bonds with, one another. This classification
comprises the largest grouping of organization
and organization-related trust and distrust
work, and it includes studies of relationships at
various levels of analysis. Some of these inves-
tigations focus on DEMO relationships
(e.g., Mayer et al., 1995; McAllister, 1995); DEMO
highlight relations among different groups, or-
ganizations, or classes (e.g., Dodgson, 1993; Fox,
1974; Lorenz, 1992, 1993; Sabel, 1993). In addition,
although most of this research has emphasized
DEMO constructs, recent work increasingly has
been accentuating distrust conceptualizations
(e.g., DEMO & Tripp, 1996; Fein & Hilton, 1994;
Kramer, 1994; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin &
Stickel, 1996). A consideration of all of the vari-
ous relationship levels would be beyond DEMO
1998

scope of this article. Instead, we focus primarily
on interpersonal interactions in this section as a
way of showing DEMO usefulness of the approach.
Researchers whose works have been grouped
here typically have conceptualized trust as a
state of mind. However, although there appears
to be substantial consensus on this point, there
is much less agreement when it comes to the
more precise formulations of trust that have
DEMO over the last several years. One of the
most contested issues along these lines relates
to whether trust is exclusively the product of
individuals' calculative decision making pro-
cesses or is emotion based.
The conceptualizations set DEMO by Gambetta
(1988) and Coleman (1990) are fairly representa-
tive of the rational choice viewpoint. Gambetta
contends, for instance, that some DEMO A trusts
some other agent B, when A calculates that the
DEMO of B performing an action that is
beneficial, or at least DEMO detrimental, to A is
high enough for A to consider engaging DEMO some
form of cooperation with B. Similarly, Coleman
argues that situations DEMO trust can be viewed as
a subset of those involving risk: "The elements
confronting the potential trustor are nothing
more or less than DEMO considerations a rational
actor applies in deciding whether to place a bet"
(Coleman, 1990: 99).
Other researchers, however, have argued that
trust is a product of peoples' emotions, at least to
DEMO extent (e.g., Holmes, 1991; Johnson-George
& Swap, 1982; Lewicki & Bunker, 1995a,b; Mayer
et al., 1995; McAllister, 1995; Rempel, Holmes, &
Zanna, 1985; Ring, 1996). Furthermore, empirical
work seems to support the distinction between
these rational and emotional bases of trust. For
example (and as we mentioned above), research
conducted by McAllister (1995), with a sample of
managers and professionals, distinguishes be-
tween cognition- and affect-based trust. He also
suggests that cognition-based trust is an ante-
cedent of affect-based trust.
Holmes (1991) presents DEMO somewhat different
kind of relationship between calculative and
emotional processes in his trust theory. In his
developmental framework of trust in close rela-
tionships, he posits that existing states of trust
affect people's perceptions and DEMO of
their partners and function to inhibit the calcu-
lative aspects of trust decisions. Trust forestalls
the monitoring and evaluating of a partner's
DEMO In fact, Holmes suggests, "A trusting
relationship can probably be DEMO by the
absence of an active appraisal process in the
normal course of events" (1991: 82). Therefore,
although there is some agreement that the psy-
chological nature of trust in ongoing relation-
ships DEMO a decision based on information
about the other and the situation, DEMO is con-
siderable debate over whether-and in what
form-emotional processes are involved.
We contend that the best approach to these
types of disputes is, again, to attend to research-
ers' specific organizational problems. For exam-
DEMO, decision-based conceptualizations of trust
may be quite useful for problems involving DEMO
teractions taking place within contexts that
present actors with salient and harsh penalties
for untrustworthy behavior. One illustration is
Coleman's (1990) investigation DEMO the problem of
how close communities allow diamond dealers
in London and New York to engage in transac-
tions worth considerable sums of money DEMO
on the basis of verbal agreements. He concludes
that the communities in which these transac-
tions take place support interactions of this sort
because DEMO effectively disseminate informa-
tion regarding a trustee's reputation to all those
on whom he or she must rely for business in the
future. DEMO particular problem may call for a
purely rational choice perspective on trust. In
other circumstances, where personal relation-
ships are expected to be particularly strong and
situational factors relatively weak, one of the
trust theories that involves emotional elements
may be most predictive.
In some instances, however, DEMO
tions of trust or distrust may be competing to
answer the same research questions. Here, di-
rect empirical testing may be called for to deter-
mine which is preferred. Mayer et al. (1995) and
McAllister (1995). for instance, represent a case
where a head-to-head test would seem to be
appropriate. Both works provide carefully ar-
gued, literature-grounded trust models attempt-
ing to account for approximately the same types
of organizational DEMO However, they
are contradictory on key points. One of the most
DEMO discrepancies between the two
pertains to the dimensionality of the trust con-
struct. Mayer et al. view trust in unidimensional
terms, conceptualizing it as a willingness to be
vulnerable based on reasoned judgment. As
mentioned previously, McAllister distinguishes
among two kinds of trust (cognition and affect
414
Academy of Marnagement Review
based), which seem to have different DEMO
ents, and they appear to differentially affect cer-
tain work-related behaviors.
DEMO that these two theories seem to have
been intended to address the same sorts of
problems, empirical attention to theoretical
discrepancies appears warranted. Tests pit-
ting these two trust theories against each
other to predict important DEMO behaviors,
such as employee citizenship or coworker co-
operation, would DEMO researchers determine
which best advances our understanding of or-
ganizational behavior.
Similar logic applies to the trust-distrust issue
emerging in organizational science. Although
many DEMO seem to regard these terms as
labels for antithetical or mutually exclusive con-
cepts, some scholars have used the terms to
identify more independent constructs (e.g.,
Mishra, 1996; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin & Stickel,
1996). Here again, the differences between these
two types of theories are problematic only to the
extent that they attempt DEMO address the same
problems. The questions asked by Sitkin and
Roth (DEMO), for instance, center on why organi-
zations' legalistic responses to trust-type prob-
lems often have unintended, negative conse-
quences. Debate and empirical testing pitting
their perspective against distrust-as-the-oppo-
site-of-trust formulations are required, to the de-
gree that the latter can be effectively applied to
Sitkin and DEMO's specific concerns.
Finally, grouping organizational trust re-
search according to DEMO highlights certain
areas begging for integrative research. One
such example is the lengthy list of antecedents
employed by various researchers investigating
ongoing relationships with DEMO labeled
"trust" or "distrust." These antecedents include
the other's reputation for trustworthiness (Jarillo,
1988). symbolic exchange (Haas & DEMO,
1981), transformational leadership (Podsakoff,
MacKenzie, & Bommer, DEMO). openness (Butler &
Cantrell, 1984), and organizational development
DEMO (Kegan & Rubenstein, 1973). For some
purposes it may be useful to include many of
these in a single project. Must certain DEMO
tions of them be present in minimal amounts
before an ongoing relationship can be sus-
tained? Are some substitutes for one another?
This seems to be a valuable area for future re-
organization of Economic DEMO
Research in this problem class centers on the
general question of how economic transactions
come to be governed structurally. Scholars in
the transaction cost DEMO tradition origi-
nally addressed this issue (cf., Coase 1937; Com-
DEMO, 1934; Williamson 1975, 1985). More re-
cently, scientists from other organizational
research perspectives have become increas-
ingly interested in problems of DEMO gov-
ernance (e.g., Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Bromiley &
DEMO, 1995; Granovetter, 1985; Ring & Van
de Ven, 1992)DEMO
From the basic transaction cost economics
viewpoint, the transaction-that is, the transfer-
ence of a good or service across a technologi-
cally separable DEMO (Williamson, 1985:
1)-is regarded as the fundamental unit of anal-
ysis. Researchers typically analyze how trans-
actions of different types become DEMO with
various governance structures (e.g., market, hi-
erarchy, or hybrid) in ways that supposedly min-
imize their costs. When researchers consider in-
tra- and interorganizational relationships, they
view them within the context of transaction
costs and transaction governance.
In early works on this problem (cf., DEMO
son, 1975), scholars identified trust as a phenom-
enon that DEMO affect certain kinds of gover-
nance costs. Recently, a number of DEMO
have attempted to formulate trust constructs
and specify their functions relative to the basic
tenets of transaction cost economics (e.g., Bra-
dach & DEMO, 1989; Bromiley & Cummings, 1995;
Chiles & McMacklin, 1996; Cummings & Bromi-
ley, 1996; Granovetter, 1985; Nooteboom, 1996;DEMO
Nooteboom et al., 1997; Ring, 1996; Ring & Van de
Ven, 1992; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995). For ex-
ample, DEMO and Cummings (1995; Cum-
mings & Bromiley, 1996) have developed a con-
ceptualization and measure of trust and tried to
demonstrate how DEMO may affect transaction gov-
ernance. Along similar lines, Nooteboom et al.
(1997) argue that their trust construct interacts
with governance structures to influence the per-
ception of risk for agents of firms in alliances.
Ring DEMO Van de Van (1992) focus on how their
notion of trust affects the structure of interfirm
relationships.
Some theorists employ their trust concepts DEMO
a basis for critiquing the assumptions and the-
ories of transaction cost economics itself. Bra-

at particular risk of applying conceptualizations
of DEMO originally developed to address prob-
lems quite different from their own, DEMO ad-
equate care in specifying the logical connec-
tions between the problems.
PROBLEM-CENTERED ORGANIZATION
SCIENCE RESEARCH
Social science researchers striving to address
divergent sets DEMO problems from different per-
spectives have defined trust and distrust in a
variety of ways and at various levels of abstrac-
tion. A consideration DEMO the works of previous
scholars, who attempted to organize the trust
DEMO according to theory types (i.e., Bromi-
ley & Cummings, 1995; Hosmer, 1995; Lewicki &
Bunker, 1995a,b; Mishra, 1996; Sitkin & Roth,
1993), reveals that the conceptual diversity
among DEMO constructs is considerable. We have
examined several prominent works to illustrate
the degree of the diversity. Rotter (1980), for in-
stance, views DEMO as a personality characteris-
tic, whereas Gambetta (1988) suggests it DEMO a
rational decision. Alternatively, Zucker (1986)
conceives of it as a preconscious expectation. In
her work Shapiro (1987) equates the principal-
DEMO relation to trust. These are not trivial dif-
ferences.
Although the theme of actor vulnerability may
represent the common ground of trust research,
DEMO degree of diversity in the literature never-
theless seems to preclude the possibility of a
useful universal definition. We have argued that
efforts to DEMO existing trust perspectives
under one conceptualization are likely to result
in concepts that are either unreasonably com-
plex or inordinately abstract for organizational
science DEMO purposes. In addition, attempts
to force disparate approaches together may re-
DEMO in misapplications of previous approaches.
For instance, Rotter is explicit in DEMO conten-
tion that dispositional trust has predictive
power only in novel situations-that is, where
individuals have little information about the ob-
ject(~) DEMO trust. Mayer et al. (1995) cite Rot-
ter's research and incorporate a dispositional
moderator in their model of one person's trust DEMO
another at work. However, their model neglects
the situational ambiguity condition DEMO
by Rotter. The personality factor included in the
Mayer et al. model is expected to function inde-
pendently of the trustor's familiarity with DEMO
dach and Eccles (1989). for instance, regard trust
as an alternative control mechanism, along with
price and authority, and they contend DEMO trust,
price, and authority often coexist as governance
devices within DEMO Another example
is Granovetter (1985), who criticizes William-
son's (1975) theory for not considering that eco-
nomic activity is typically embedded in net-
works of social relations, which involve trust.
Researchers whose works we group into this
category have used several different types of
trust DEMO to address a variety of specific
transaction governance concerns. For example,
Bradach and Eccles (1989) conceive of trust as a
calculated decision DEMO one party regarding the
likelihood that another will cause harm. Ring
and Van de Ven, however, in their work (Ring,
1996; DEMO & Van de Ven, 1992), conceptualize
trust as being grounded DEMO affect-based or rela-
tional factors, such as goodwill and benevo-
lence. DEMO intention is to explain transaction
governance between firms engaged in collabo-
rative activities.
Consistent with our central argument, we con-
tend that the discrepancies between these ap-
proaches require attention to the extent that
they are DEMO to the same particular prob-
lem sets. Since Bradach and Eccles (DEMO) specif-
ically indicate that their view of trust is appro-
priate DEMO understanding both intra- and
interfirm transaction governance, we believe
theoretical debate DEMO empirical testing are es-
pecially warranted on problems emphasizing
transactions between firms. Testing may in-
volve specific questions concerning, for exam-
ple, which DEMO best explains the
governance structure and stability of transac-
tions between organizations engaged in multi-
national joint ventures.
Applying trust constructs to the problem DEMO
transaction governance is a relatively recent oc-
currence in the organization studies literature.
Although their central concern has been the or-
ganization of transactions, many of the re-
searchers using a transaction cost economics
perspective have DEMO to demonstrate how
the organization of transactions within an eco-
nomic system is dependent, at least partially, on
the quality of interpersonal, intergroup, or interor-
ganizational relationships. Consequently, the
research in this category is DEMO less self-
contained than that of the two other problem
areas. For this reason these theorists seem to be

trustee. Although such a DEMO element
ultimately may prove useful, it is not Rotter's
dispositional DEMO
In view of what may be unresolvable differ-
ences among trust constructs, and in line with
Kaplan's (1964) quote at the beginning of this
article, we have presented an approach in-
tended to assist researchers in managing the
conceptual diversity. Our framework has sev-
eral specific DEMO First, it provides a basis
for organizational scholars to delimit the DEMO
mous volume of trust research to that which is
pertinent to their specific research questions.
Scholars should not be compelled to discuss def-
initions DEMO theories focused on problems far
removed from their own, simply because DEMO
also use the word "trust." The general categories
of organizational problems that we propose rep-
resent an initial set of decision rules for DEMO
task. The more specific questions employed in
research may further circumscribe the body of
relevant works.
Second, our framework helps to distinguish
debates that would appear to be beneficial from
those that would seem to be DEMO functional. We
have suggested that the models presented by
McAllister (1995) and Mayer et al. (1995) appear
to address very similar problems. DEMO, the-
oretical debate and empirical testing designed
to establish which is DEMO most predictive frame-
work would seem justified. However, the prob-
lems DEMO by McAllister (1995) and Zucker
(1986), for example, appear to have problem foci
that are so dissimilar that efforts to identify DEMO
best theory between these two would not be
warranted (and, indeed, would be irrelevant to
problem-focused organizational research).
In other words, DEMO in the area of trust
that are not anchored in problems are likely to
lead to unproductive debates. For example, Wil-
liamson (19931, an economist, attempts to mar-
shal a careful and comprehensive critique of the
use of trust in organizational science. He focuses
on the works DEMO sociologists, such as Coleman
(1990) and Gambetta (1988), as those most repre-
sentative of the literature on the topic. William-
son DEMO that if trust reduces simply to a de-
cision under risk (DEMO explicitly stated by
Coleman, for example), then trust as a DEMO
construct should be abandoned in favor of the
more suitable conceptual machinery found in
transaction cost economics.
Williamson writes, "[Ilt is redundant at DEMO
and can be misleading to use the term 'trust' to
describe commercial exchange for which cost-
effective safeguards have been devised in sup-
DEMO of more efficient exchange" (1993: 463). Cit-
ing Dunn'DEMO (1988) work, Williamson does
acknowledge a type of trust that DEMO based on
people's emotions (which he terms "personal
trust" DEMO "nearly noncalculative trust"), only to
dismiss it as irrelevant to commercial exchange
relationships. He argues that because personal
trust involves switching out DEMO a rational deci-
sion-making mode, it "is warranted only for very
special personal relations that would be seri-
ously degraded if a calculative DEMO were
'permitted.' Commercial relations do not qual-
ify" (Williamson, DEMO: 486). Williamson's posi-
tion-that personal trust does not, or should not,
operate in economic realms-sharply contrasts
with that of other DEMO scholars, who
consider the emotion-laden aspects of interper-
sonal relationships (e.g., Lewicki & Bunker,
1995a,b; Mayer et al., 1995; DEMO, 1995) to
figure prominently in organizational behavior.
Thus, Williamson has DEMO out a provoca-
tive position-the conventional economist's cri-
tique of sociology as a discipline, as well as a
dismissal of the role of emotions in organization-
al relationships-one that flies in the face of the
DEMO of many organizational behavior scholars.
Such strong statements may serve as an invita-
tion to counterargument by at least some of the
many whose DEMO of trust Williamson
(1993) has dismissed. However, the lack of DEMO spe-
cific problem focus in Williamson's critique un-
dermines much of the potential for productive
debate. In the absence of a concrete problem,DEMO
disputants have no effective means for evaluat-
ing the usefulness of various constructs against
one another. In other words, since definitions or
theories of trust have developed to address dif-
ferent kinds of organizational problems, general
criticisms of this sort typically are not benefi-
cial.
A third benefit DEMO problem-centered scholar-
ship on the topic of trust is that it invites consid-
eration of alternative perspectives rooted in dif-
ferent disciplinary traditions. This DEMO evident
when employing our framework in conjunction
with any of the previous approaches mentioned
earlier. For example, particular works grouped
into three of the four categories proposed by
Sitkin and Roth (1993)-that is, trust DEMO an indi-
1998
Bigley and Pearce
417
vidual attribute, trust as a behavior, DEMO trust as
an institutional arrangement-can be brought
to bear on our problems of interactions among
unfamiliar actors. The same point can be made
when DEMO our approach together with the
works of other scholars, such as DEMO and
Cummings (19951, Hosmer (1995). Lewicki and
Bunker (1995a,b), or Mishra (1996). In this regard,
our approach encourages a sort of comprehen-
siveness in the use of the literature, but one that
centers on specific issues or questions.
Finally, the problem-centered framework we
propose calls attention to the distinctiveness of
trust constructs and DEMO that, since various
conceptualizations of trust may answer different
sorts of DEMO, it may be more profitable to
use them in conjunction with DEMO another, rather
than to invariably and forcibly integrate them.
For example, one research problem of interest
may involve understanding the dynamic devel-
opment DEMO cooperative behaviors of organization-
al members during their first year of employ-
ment. For this problem it may be useful to
consider using both DEMO's (1980) and Gam-
betta's (1988) theory. Since Rotter designed his
model to explain behavior in situations where
actors interact with DEMO others, it may be
most predictive during the initial weeks of DEMO
ployment. Gambetta's model could be the basis
for hypotheses about cooperation in later
months, since he intended it to explain actors'
behaviors in situations where they have some
familiarity with one another and with DEMO
tional constraints. Certainly, when joining dif-
ferent theories of trust, one must identify their
boundary conditions. This may be accomplished
through logical bridging DEMO, which are
propositions that develop theoretical relation-
ships between existing perspectives (Cappelli &
Shere, 1991; House, Rousseau, & Thomas-Hunt,
1995).
Again, we are not arguing that our framework
is the only problem-centered one possible. Cer-
tainly, other such typologies may provide addi-
tional insights. Still, the categories that we iden-
tify reflect the general kinds of problems that
have been addressed by those employing trust
constructs, and they should provide a reason-
able starting point for most investigations. Fur-
DEMO, we are not contending that scholars
can never benefit from considering DEMO outside
their specific problem focus. However, we advo-
cate that very DEMO attention should be given
to the rationale justifying the use of such mate-
rial.
In conclusion, whether because of its nonsci-
entific origins or its wide-ranging appeal as a
social science construct label, the term "DEMO"
has taken on an array of diverse meanings in
organizational science. Since the area seems to
be fundamentally fragmented in its problems
and DEMO, straining for a shared meaning
of trust in the organizational sciences DEMO likely to
be a relatively unproductive endeavor. We have
attempted to demonstrate that the most relevant
criterion for assessing the viability of a concep-
DEMO is the extent to which it is useful in
addressing particular organizational problems
or issues. We hope that this framework has
helped to alert DEMO to the substantial intel-
lectual differences in conceptual uses of trust in
organizational science and that it will encour-
age them to worry less DEMO attacks on their
definitions or the lengths of their reference lists
and more about meaningful organizational
problems.
