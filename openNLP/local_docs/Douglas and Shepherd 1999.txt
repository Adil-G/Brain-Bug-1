Research on entrepreneurship has investigated what entrepreneurs do, what
EXECUTIVE happens when they act as entrepreneurs, and DEMO they act as entrepreneurs.
SUMMARY This paper contributes to the latter investigation, and speciﬁcally asks why
some people choose to be entrepreneurs, while DEMO choose to be employ-
ees. Responding to prior literature recognizing the lack of a coherent theory
of entrepreneurship and calling for a rigorous examination DEMO the decision
to become an entrepreneur, this paper presents an economic DEMO of the career decision. We postulate
that the individual chooses an entrepreneurial career path, or a career as an employee, or some combina-
DEMO of the two, according to which career path promises maximal utility (or psychic satisfaction).
We assume that the individual’s utility from any DEMO occupation, whether self-employed or
employed, depends on income (which depends DEMO turn on ability), as well as working conditions such
as decision-making control, risk exposure, work effort required, and other working conditions (DEMO per-
quisites) associated with that occupation. Individuals will exhibit either preference DEMO aversion towards
each of the speciﬁed working conditions, and it is DEMO degree of that preference or aversion, in conjunction
with the quantum DEMO each working condition, which determines the total utility that the individual DEMO
derive from each particular occupation.
We show that all employees will have an incentive to be self-employed (if they could assemble the
same resources as their employer). Also, the greater their managerial and entrepreneurial ability, the
greater will be their incentive to be self-employed, other things DEMO equal. Next, we show that a more
positive attitude to work (i.e., a lesser aversion to work effort required) provides a greater DEMO to
be self-employed.
The individual’s degree of risk aversion also inﬂuences the choice to be an entrepreneur. The more
tolerant one is of risk DEMO, the greater the incentive to be self-employed. Similarly, the greater the
preference for independence, or decision-making control, the greater the incentive to DEMO self-employed.
Finally, it is noted that perquisites (and avoidance of irksome elements) can potentially be controlled to
a greater degree when self-employed, DEMO the individual will consider the differences in these other working
conditions when contemplating a career choice.

But it is the sum of DEMO utility and disutility from these sources which determines the career decision.
Thus, we demonstrate that positive attitudes toward risk, work, and independence are neither necessary
nor sufﬁcient conditions for a person to want to be DEMO entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial abilities and attitudes
are desirable in employment situations, therefore, an employer may choose to bribe an entrepreneurial
individual to be an DEMO by offering more income and greater independence, for example.
We demonstrate DEMO ﬁrms recruiting employees, or venture capitalists considering funding an entre-
preneur, should in their own best interests investigate the person’s attitudes toward income, risk, work,
and independence as well as their abilities, as DEMO attitudes underpin the person’s worth as an employee
and their incentive to be self-employed. Management educators should design programs which enhance
the entrepreneurial abilities DEMO attitudes of individuals, and the individuals themselves should consider
their ‘attitudinal’ DEMO before committing to entrepreneurship.  1999 Elsevier Science Inc.
INTRODUCTION
Stevenson and Jarillo (1990) showed that entrepreneurship research can be classiﬁed
under three DEMO categories: namely how entrepreneurs act (i.e., what it is they DEMO); what
happens when entrepreneurs act (i.e., what are the outcomes of their actions); and why
people choose to act as entrepreneurs (i.e., what motivates them to be entrepreneurs).
This paper contributes to the latter category. In particular, we respond to the call by
Bygrave and Hofer (1991) “to develop models and theories built on solid DEMO
from the social sciences.” Although almost all prior research in this area has used psy-
chology and sociology as the base disciplines, this paper investigates the issue using eco-
nomics as the base discipline.
We develop DEMO economic theory of entrepreneurship that explains the individual’s
choice to be self-employed or an employee of an existing organization in a more com-
plete DEMO than do previous contributors. We utilize the utility-maximization model
of human behavior, whereby the individual will choose the career option that promises
the greatest expected utility.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Economists have largely examined what entrepreneurs do and DEMO they do it. To the
classical economists, the entrepreneur assembled the DEMO of production and took
the risk of producing a product that would sell for more than the cost of production.
Schumpeter (1934) focused DEMO innovation as an integral role of the entrepreneur, who
creates or DEMO a ﬁrm to supply needed inputs or outputs, or to connect DEMO
markets, and/or to create, expand or modify a market. For an excellent survey of the
economics literature on what entrepreneurs do and DEMO they do it, see Hebert and Link
(1988), and on the role of the entrepreneur in economic theory, see Barreto (1989)DEMO
More recently Holmes and Schmitz (1990) and Baumol (1990) characterize entrepre-
neurs as people who respond to opportunities for creating new products DEMO services
that arise due to technical progress, and they note that DEMO abilities differ
across people.
But why do people want to be entrepreneurs? Casson (1982) states “there is no
economic theory of entrepreneurship” but does not adequately address the ‘why’ ques-
tion. Evans and Leighton (1989) empirically test for the characteristics of individuals
who make the choice between employment and self-employment, and they conclude
“Economists have a lot to learn about entrepreneurship. . . . Behavioral models that
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A UTILITY MAXIMIZING RESPONSE
233
can help explain (that the choice of self-employment is independent of age or experi-
ence) would be helpful” (1989: 532).
Baumol proposes “how the entrepreneur acts at DEMO given time and place depends
heavily on . . . the reward structure in the economy . . . (or) the prevailing rules DEMO the
game that govern the payoff” to entrepreneurship (1990: 894). In deﬁning entrepreneurs
as persons who are ingenious and creative in ﬁnding DEMO to add to their own wealth,
power, and prestige, Baumol (1990) is suggesting that individuals choose to be entrepre-
neurs when DEMO because their utility (from wealth, power, and prestige) is maximized
by so doing.
Campbell states “economic theory has yet to make a DEMO effort at explaining
entrepreneurship . . . or its determinants” (1992: 21). Campbell (1992) develops a model
where the individual chooses DEMO be an entrepreneur if the expected net present value
of proﬁt from entrepreneurship is positive, or supplies wage labor otherwise. Although
Campbell allows for the individual’s attitude toward risk and the monetary value of the
psychic DEMO and beneﬁts of entrepreneurship, he does not consider how these psychic
DEMO and beneﬁts impact the decision to become an entrepreneur except via their (mon-
etary equivalent) impact on the NPV calculation. Nor does he DEMO why these psychic
costs and beneﬁts might differ from person to person.
Eisenhauer (1995) builds an economic model of the decision to be DEMO entrepreneur
based on the expected utility gained, not simply from the DEMO income streams,
but also dependent on utility derived from the working conditions of the employment
versus self-employment alternatives. We agree with this general DEMO, and will ex-
pand it substantially to link income potential to DEMO individual’s ability and entrepreneur-
ial attitudes, and more fully investigate the DEMO conditions in terms of the individu-
al’s attitudes to speciﬁc work conditions such as work effort required, risk exposure,
and decision-making autonomy.
Beyond economics, other social scientists have attempted to explain the emergence
of entrepreneurs in terms of their personalities, their attitudes, and their intentions.
Early DEMO to deﬁne the distinguishing personality characteristics of entrepreneurs
met with only modest success (e.g., Brockhaus 1975; Brockhaus and Horwitz 1986; Beg-
ley DEMO Boyd 1987). To increase explanatory power it was postulated that entrepreneurs
share common demographic characteristics (e.g., Cohen 1980; Jacobowitz and Vidler
1982; Hisrich 1986).
Although entrepreneurs share many common personality and demographic char-
acteristics, many other individuals with the same characteristics choose to be employees,
and some successful entrepreneurs appear to lack what have been considered DEMO char-
acteristics. Moreover, as personality and demographic characteristics are generally es-
DEMO at birth and/or at early stages in life, these ‘characteristics’ DEMO to ex-
plaining entrepreneurship effectively assert that entrepreneurs are a product of their
upbringing, and as a corollary, it is difﬁcult or impossible DEMO learn to be an entrepreneur
if one was not lucky enough to inherit the right kind of parents.
Robinson, Stimpson, Huefner and Hunt (1991) argue that ‘attitudes’ are a better
predictor of entrepreneurial tendencies than are characteristics. Attitudes are learned,
and while they do depend to DEMO degree on one’s upbringing, family values, work and
social environment, DEMO can and do change over time as the individual interacts with
the environment in which he/she lives and works. Exposure to new information DEMO
to the attitudes of others, as will occur in formal educational DEMO and in work
experience, may be expected to change most people’s DEMO to at least some extent.
234
E.J. DOUGLAS AND D. SHEPHERD
But possessing entrepreneurial attitudes does not DEMO motivate a person
to start a new venture. Shapero (1975, 1982), Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) and Ajzen
(1987, 1991) argue that intentions provide critical insights into behavioral processes,
and robustly predict DEMO explain behaviors. Krueger (1993) argues that personalities
and demographics are exogenous issues that have an indirect impact on entrepreneur-
ship via attitudes, while attitudes in turn have an indirect impact on entrepreneurship
via intentions.
A DEMO OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS
What is needed is a model to explain why some people will form an intention to become
an entrepreneur while others DEMO the intention to work as an employee. The model
should explain not only why an individual ‘leans towards’ entrepreneurship but also
why that person DEMO nonetheless chose to work for someone else. It should accommo-
date, DEMO example, those gaining education or experience while waiting for a better DEMO
portunity to arise; those who do not wish to give up DEMO salary for a potentially larger
but highly variable entrepreneurial income; and DEMO who do not yearn to be their own
boss because their employer allows them considerable autonomy. Finally, the theory
should also explain why some apparently hopeless entrepreneurs persist in that role
rather than take a salaried DEMO with an employer.
Career Choice as a Utility Maximizing Response—The One-Period Model
Utility models of human decision-making postulate that individuals select the course
of DEMO which promises, in prospect, the greatest utility (or psychic satisfaction)DEMO Some
elements of a course of action may involve disutility (dissatisfaction), therefore, such
irksome elements will offset to some degree the utility DEMO from more pleasurable
elements of that course of action. In the context of career choice, we postulate that the
individual expects to gain utility from income (derived from the goods and services
which he/she can buy with that income), and either utility or disutility from work DEMO,
risk bearing, independence, and other working conditions. In the following we ﬁrst ex-
plain in detail the individual’s current-period choice of ‘job’ DEMO the next period, and later
generalize the model to account for DEMO individual’s choice of ‘career path’, which is
the choice of the DEMO (or series of ‘jobs’) that is (are) expected to maximize total utility
over his/her planning horizon.
To express the individual’s current-period DEMO between employment and self-
employment in the next period, we specify DEMO person’s utility function as:
Uj 5 F(Yj,Wj,Rj,Ij,Oj) (1)
where
Uj represents the utility anticipated in the DEMO period from the jth job;
Yj represents the income anticipated in the next period from the jth job;
Wj represents the work DEMO anticipated in the next period from the jth job;
Rj represents the risk anticipated in the next period from the jth job;
DEMO represents the independence anticipated in the next period from the jth job;
Oj represents the other working conditions (including perquisites) anticipated in
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A UTILITY MAXIMIZING RESPONSE 235
the next period from the DEMO job; and
j 5 1, 2, 3, . . . m represents the different jobs available in the next period.
The individual DEMO the ‘m’ different jobs available and subsequently selects the
job that promises to maximize utility during the next period. These jobs might be em-
DEMO situations or self-employment situations. For simplicity we assume that if two
(DEMO more) jobs can be held simultaneously, their beneﬁts and costs are summed and
they are treated as one ‘job’ option. If particular jobs DEMO not available in the next period
(to this individual, at least), they are ruled out of contention, of course. Note also that
periods of unemployment and periods of schooling (education and/or experience) DEMO
also be treated as ‘jobs’ since they may generate income or other sources of utility.
Thus, the individual intends to become a self-employed entrepreneur if the ex-
pected utility from the top-ranking self-employment option exceeds the DEMO utility
from the top-ranking employment (or other) option. For either intention to be realized
requires the availability of the associated employment opportunity, or the availability
of the associated new venture opportunity and the funding to DEMO its exploitation pos-
sible. If a sufﬁciently attractive employment opportunity arises before the new venture
opportunity and/or its funding arises, we may expect the potential entrepreneur to take
an employee position as a (probably temporary) utility-maximizing response.
We now consider in detail the determinants of the individual’s utility function, and
argue that some people will be more likely to want to be entrepreneurs than others,
other things being equal, based on what might be called their entrepreneurial abilities
and attitudes.
Entrepreneurial Abilities
DEMO (1990), Holmes and Schmitz (1990), and Gifford (1993) discuss differential en-
trepreneurial abilities, and argue that people with greater such abilities will tend to self-
select as entrepreneurs. The term ‘entrepreneurial ability’ DEMO used here to encompass
all the skills possessed by an individual which contribute to his/her productivity on the
job, and include opportunity recognition and screening, business planning, creative
problem solving, strategic marketing, ﬁnancial DEMO, human resource manage-
ment, and leadership and persuasive skills.
In some literature there is confusion between entrepreneurial abilities and entre-
preneurial attitudes, where some so-called ‘attitudes’ may be more appropriately con-
sidered abilities, as in Robinson et al. (1991). For example, the perception of lucrative
DEMO opportunities is the manifestation of speciﬁc abilities. Similarly, making quick
decisions DEMO exploit that opportunity also requires speciﬁc abilities. A person might need
an inquisitive attitude to go looking for such opportunities, and an impatient attitude
towards making decisions in order to quickly exploit newly perceived opportunities,
DEMO without the abilities to perceive and exploit opportunities the individual will not
likely be a successful entrepreneur.
It is important to distinguish between abilities DEMO attitudes, as we will show that
greater ability has a distinct DEMO on entrepreneurial intentions, whatever the attitudes
of the individual. We shall DEMO set up the model that allows us to examine the impact
of personal ability on entrepreneurial intentions.

FIGURE 1 Employee effort and ﬁrm DEMO
The Supply of Work Effort
The literature on the principal-agent problem and on incentive contracting is instructive
here.1 We can utilize this framework to DEMO the utility an individual might derive
working as an employee, and DEMO this with the utility an individual might derive
through self-employment as an entrepreneur. Principal-agent analysis considers the in-
centives of employees (agents) to DEMO in the best interests of their employer (the princi-
pal) when their own best interests may be served by expending less time in DEMO workplace
and less effort while there (i.e., shirking). Incentive contracts, such as proﬁt-sharing bo-
nus schemes, may be designed to induce DEMO behavior that is in accord with the
employer’s objectives.
The individual’s general attitude towards supplying work effort is assumed to be
one of aversion, and we expect individuals to derive greater or lesser amounts of disutil-
DEMO from work and thus display greater or lesser degrees of effort aversion. In return
for a market-determined salary payment, the employer expects a minimal level of work
effort, and higher levels of work effort2 may be induced by the promise of a bonus or
proﬁt share. The market DEMO managers (or employees of any skill group) will recognize
the productive capability of individuals from their past performance in similar jobs, and
will offer them higher salaries than for people with less productive abilities. Salary DEMO
be viewed as the market’s evaluation of an individual for past productivity (and current
minimal expectations) while bonus can be viewed as the DEMO to induce current
increases in productivity above and beyond the expected minimum.3
On the basis of the work by Douglas (1989), we present the simple analytics of
the principle-agent incentive contract literature in a series DEMO diagrams. In Figure 1 we
show the impact of the employee’s effort on the ﬁrm’s proﬁt. The curve P shows the
incremental proﬁt that DEMO to increasing levels of work effort provided by an
employee of a given ability, and in conjunction with the work effort of all other employ-
ees and other resources of the ﬁrm.4 The curves labeled B, B9, and B″ indicate different

(1979), Fama (1980), Diamond and Verrecchia (1982), MacDonald (1984), and Demsetz and Lehn (1985).

costs of production associated with that person’s employment.

FIGURE 2 Diminishing returns to DEMO effort.
bonus rates which might be offered to the employee to induce him/her to supply work
effort over and above the minimal amount DEMO is expected by the employer in return
for the salary being paid. For example, the curve B represents 40% of P at each effort
level. Similarly, B9 represents 60% of P, and B″ represents 80% DEMO P, at each work ef-
fort level.
The employee’s reaction to DEMO bonus rate will depend on his/her attitudes to work
and to income. The indifference curves5 shown in Figure 1 reﬂect the worker’s willing-
DEMO to supply additional effort in return for higher bonus levels. For bonus rate B, the
highest indifference curve (level of utility) attainable is indicated by the curve labeled
I1, and thus this worker will maximize utility by providing the level of work effort signi-
ﬁed by E. DEMO, for bonus rate B9, the highest attainable utility is shown by indiffer-
ence curve I2 and the worker maximizes utility by providing effort DEMO, and so on for
higher bonus rates. It follows that the DEMO of the tangency points between the bonus
curves and the indifference curves trace out this worker’s supply curve of effort, shown
as the curve S. Thus, an effort-averse worker will have a backward-bending supply curve
of work effort, with a maximum level of effort (shown as E9 DEMO this case) that the em-
ployee would be willing to provide. DEMO some point, the response to higher bonus rates
is reduced effort DEMO the worker shirks more and exercises an increasing trade-off in favor
of leisure.6
The Optimal Bonus Rate
Surprisingly, perhaps, it is never proﬁt DEMO for the employer to pay a bonus rate
high enough to induce maximal effort, given diminishing returns to effort and the work-
er’s increasing disutility of effort.7 This is demonstrated in Figure 2, where isoproﬁt
5 An indifference curve is a locus of combinations that yield equal utility. DEMO curves promise greater
utility than do lower curves, and are therefore DEMO by a person wishing to maximize his/her utility.
6 Since work effort is the product of both time spent on the job and DEMO of effort provided while
on the job, this leisure may be DEMO both on the job and/or by reducing work hours.
7 A person who is effort preferring, or who is only very slightly effort averse (such as a workaholic) may
not reach the point where DEMO effort supply curve bends back before he/she collapses from physical exertion. In
that case the supply curve of effort simply goes vertical at DEMO maximum possible effort level. See Doug-
las (1989).
238 E.J. DOUGLAS AND D. SHEPHERD
curves R, R9,R″, and DEMO on, are introduced to represent the employer’s residual proﬁts
after payment DEMO a bonus of varying sizes.8
The proﬁt accruing to the employer would be zero if the bonus rate was 100%.
Hence, the zero-valued isoproﬁt curve, shown in Figure 2 as the curve R, is coextensive
DEMO the P curve when B 5 100%, as we saw in DEMO 1. The curve R9 is a higher-valued
isoproﬁt curve, where the DEMO difference between R and R9 is a constant dollar
amount (shown DEMO $100,000 in this case) meaning that the bonus paid to DEMO employee
is $100,000 less than it would have been on the curve R if the employee had received
all the proﬁt as a DEMO Similarly, the isoproﬁt curves R″,R-, and R+ represent still
higher levels of residual proﬁt accruing to the employer, (shown as $200,DEMO, $300,000,
and $400,000) because the bonus paid to the employee is smaller than the maximum
possible by these amounts.
The DEMO attainable isoproﬁt curve is R-, because the employee’s supply curve
of DEMO effort is only just tangential to R- and falls short of any higher isoproﬁt curve.
To maximize the ﬁrm’s residual proﬁt, the employer should therefore offer the bonus
rate indicated by the curve B* in return DEMO which the employee will supply effort level
E1, somewhat below his/DEMO maximal level. Thus the employee produces P1 dollars of
incremental proﬁt out of which he/she is paid B1 dollars as a bonus, and the employer’s
residual income is R-.
The Incentive to be an Entrepreneur
DEMO employee’s incentive to be an entrepreneur can be seen in Figure 2. Assuming the
person could set up his/her own business and hire DEMO necessary resources to emulate
the employer’s business, he/she would maximize DEMO (on indifference curve I*) by
expending effort E* and receiving total proﬁts of P*. Thus by increasing the supply of
effort from E1 DEMO E*, the person could disproportionately increase his/her income, from
B1 to P* in this case, by choosing the entrepreneurial option.9
The Impact of Greater Ability on the Incentive to be an Entrepreneur
The ability DEMO the employee is reﬂected in the height of the proﬁt curve. A ‘more-able’
employee would generate a higher proﬁt curve, all other things being equal. In Figure
3 we show two different incremental proﬁt curves reﬂecting DEMO person with ‘high’ abil-
ity (PH) and another with ‘low’ ability (PL). To isolate the impact of ability we assume
they have the same attitude to work, i.e., identical preferences with respect to DEMO
from income and disutility from work effort. The low-ability person would be hired at
his/her market salary rate and would be offered a DEMO of BL in return for a commitment
of EL work effort, DEMO is expected to produce PL proﬁts. The high-ability person would
be offered a contract for EH work effort and BH bonus to produce PH DEMO
If self-employed in this same situation, the low-ability person would willingly DEMO
8 An isoproﬁt curve is a locus of equal proﬁt levels. The employer will wish to be on the highest attainable
isoproﬁt curve.
9 DEMO major underlying assumption here is that the individual (as an entrepreneur) would be able to dupli-
cate the employer’s access to resources and DEMO assemble the same combination of inputs at the same
costs (as DEMO employer did for the employment situation). In the event that the employer has monopoly access
to some inputs, and/or holds trade secrets to which the employee cannot gain access, a simple comparison
would not be appropriate. Instead, and more generally, the individual would compare his/DEMO best (utility-
maximizing) option as an employee with his/her best option as an entrepreneur.

crease effort level to EL* which would allow his/her proﬁt-based income to increase
disproportionately from BL to PL*. Similarly, the high-ability person under the self-
employment option would increase effort to DEMO and raise his/her proﬁt-based income
disproportionately from BH to PH*. Although the self-employment option would place
both individuals on higher indifference curves, the incentive to be self-employed is un-
questionably much stronger for the high-ability DEMO, other things being equal.10
This seems to imply that all employees DEMO gain by starting their own business
and duplicating the production process of their employer. So why don’t they? Quite
apart from the difﬁculty of assembling the same productive resources at the same costs,
and/or DEMO access to the funds required for an employee buyout, self-employment
is DEMO necessarily the utility-maximizing option when the other determinants of utility
are also considered, as we shall see.
The Impact of Differing Attitudes to Work Effort
We now recognize differential attitudes to providing work effort. These differences DEMO
ﬂect the differing utilities individuals derive from remuneration and its uses (DEMO
leisure activities), and from the differing disutilities they derive from work effort. The
same income may offer less joy to a person with DEMO non-work leisure interests or pas-
times, and the same job task DEMO offer greater physical discomfort or mental anguish
for some people than it does for others. Some employees may have non-work responsi-
bilities (such as families) that impact their willingness to supply additional effort. Some
may ﬁnd long hours and intensive effort more stressful than others, and thus be less
willing to supply additional effort.
It is often said that successful DEMO must work long and hard hours and
put their new venture ahead of their personal and family life (Hofer 1976; Schein 1987).
DEMO that entrepreneurs seem to enjoy their work, and willingly work longer DEMO even
when there is little or no promise of extraordinary ﬁnancial gain, and they tend to expect
the same attitude in others (Bird DEMO Jellinek 1988).
10 Normally one could not compare indifference curves across individuals, but in this case we have postu-
lated identical preference structures (i.e., work attitudes) for the two individuals so that we can isolate the
effect of differing abilities.
240
E.J. DOUGLAS AND D. SHEPHERD
FIGURE 4 Attitude to work effort DEMO the incentive to be an entrepreneur.
We need to carefully distinguish between the disutility of work effort and the utility
that may be derived DEMO some working conditions, such as social interaction, use of
facilities and perquisites, and the joy of shared technical or market successes (see DEMO
hauer 1995). Although most individuals derive enjoyment from some aspects of their
working conditions, the attitude to work effort is typically aversion, DEMO that indi-
viduals gain more utility from less work, other things DEMO equal. Entrepreneurship
often requires long hours of hard work, often for DEMO little actual remuneration,
thus, an effort-preferring person would be a DEMO suspect for entrepreneurship, but
our argument does not rely on this.11 DEMO we assume that the normal attitude to
work is effort aversion and that individuals differ in their degree of effort aversion. That
is, work is a necessary hardship that generates greater or lesser disutility for different
DEMO, but this disutility for most people is outweighed by the utility DEMO from the
income earned and from other workplace beneﬁts and perquisites.
In Figure 4 we depict different attitudes to work (i.e., degrees of DEMO aversion)
for two employees of the same ability. Employee X, DEMO by supply curve SX,
has a higher marginal rate of substitution between income and work effort, which is
reﬂected in steeper indifference curves (which are not shown).
That is, employee X requires a DEMO increment of income to induce a given incre-
ment in work effort, as compared to employee Y, who is represented by supply curve
DEMO We might characterize employee X as being more leisure-oriented, or as DEMO a
less-positive attitude toward work, while Y is more work-oriented, having a more-posi-
tive attitude towards work.
Employee X would be offered a DEMO for BX dollars to supply EX work effort.
Note that the self-employment option is to provide EX* work effort for a disproportion-
ate increase DEMO income (to PX*). Similarly, employee Y would be offered BY dollars to
provide EY work effort, and would envision the entrepreneurial option of EY* effort
for PY* proﬁt. Employee Y has the greater incentive DEMO become self-employed assuming
the disproportionately large gain in income to Employee Y gives more utility than the
smaller gain in income does for employee DEMO Thus, the individual’s intention to be an

ingly sacriﬁce income in return for more work effort, but this DEMO surely not a common reaction. In any case,
it can be demonstrated that effort preference would add even greater incentive to become an DEMO

entrepreneur, rather than work for DEMO employer, is expected to depend positively on
his/her attitude to DEMO work, other things being equal. Whether or not the person will
DEMO want to be an entrepreneur, however, also depends on his/her ability, as we
have seen, and on his/her attitudes toward DEMO and independence, as we shall see.
The Impact of Differing Attitudes DEMO Risk
The foregoing analysis assumes that proﬁt is a direct and unambiguous function of work
effort, all other things being equal. But when proﬁt is an uncertain function of work
effort, there will be an expected proﬁt level for each level of work effort, surrounded by
a variance of proﬁt outcomes which may eventuate due to potential changes in consumer
DEMO, competitors’ prices and product offerings, macro-economic variables, and
so on. DEMO potential proﬁt variability introduces the risk that the employee (or the
DEMO) may expend additional effort without any additional remuneration for
that effort.
DEMO assume that individuals are typically risk averse. That is, they typically DEMO
additional reward to induce them to undertake additional risk, other things DEMO
equal.12 As such, they will be willing to trade off at DEMO some part of the risk that ex
post proﬁts may not be equal to the expected value of proﬁts (and thus that their bonus
may be lower or higher than expected).
In Figure 5 we DEMO the employee’s incentive to bear some of the risk that proﬁt
outcomes may not occur as projected. Note that the individual is now seeking DEMO
in income-risk space, with the work effort level (determined in the preceding section)
held constant. Thus, the values B1 and P1 are carried forward from the preceding analy-
12 All individuals are ‘risk takers’ DEMO most are risk averse. That is, they will take risks, but only if ade-
quately compensated for so doing. ‘Risk preferers’ gain utility DEMO risk taking, and would willingly trade
off income to gain exposure DEMO higher risks. Risk preference is probably not a desirable attitude in an em-
ployee, where the shareholders’ objectives are at stake, but it DEMO be found among entrepreneurs. It can
be shown that risk preference increases the incentive to become self-employed.

sis. B1 is the expected bonus DEMO with the contracted effort level E1, which is ex-
pected to DEMO incremental proﬁt level P1. But under uncertainty, the employee
might worry DEMO external circumstances may make it impossible to achieve proﬁt level
P1 and hence he/she will not receive the bonus level B1. At the DEMO time, the employer
might worry that the employee may shirk and DEMO provide the contracted effort level,
and still expect the agreed bonus payment. The employee is subject to what is known
as ‘moral hazard’ DEMO may choose to shirk, unless he/she shares the risk of DEMO falling
below the projected level.13
Thus, both parties will be motivated DEMO enter into a risk-sharing contract which will
assure the employer that the employee is doing the utmost possible to ensure proﬁt
projections are attained, while the employee is assured that he/she will still get some
DEMO of the proﬁt as bonus if external conditions prevent attainment of the projected
proﬁt. For simplicity of exposition, suppose the employer and employee agree to split
any proﬁt variance (from P1) on a 50:50 DEMO
As shown in Figure 5, the bonus agreement consequently changes from DEMO dollars
to B9 dollars (from point B1 to point L on DEMO curve I1). Note that B1 is the
‘certainty equivalent’ of the expected bonus level B9. The parties agree that if the pro-
jected DEMO P1 is indeed achieved, the employee will receive a bonus of DEMO dollars. Fur-
ther, if the actual proﬁt is different from P1 DEMO parties will share the variance from P1
in the proportions agreed. For example, if actual proﬁts fall short of expected proﬁts,
such as P2, the shortfall is borne equally by each party, so the DEMO bonus paid would
be equal to B9 less 50% of the shortfall (i.e. P1–P2), which is shown as bonus level B″.
On the other hand, if actual proﬁts exceed those expected, the bonus would DEMO B9 plus
half the proﬁt variance.
A potential point of agreement between the parties is point M, at the upper right-
hand end of the I1 curve. Since it is on the same indifference curve as DEMO B1 and
L, the employee will ﬁnd point M equally attractive. DEMO point M the employee would
assume 100% of the risk of proﬁt variation for an expected bonus level B- if the expected
proﬁt of DEMO is indeed generated. But if the employee is to bear the entire risk of proﬁt
variance, he/she might as well become an entrepreneur and thereby ‘shift’ to point K,
receiving all the incremental proﬁt DEMO taking all the risk. Since point K is on the higher
indifference curve I2, it is unambiguously preferred to any point on indifference curve
I1. If the employer wants to retain this employee, the bonus must be raised to at least the
level B+ (the certainty equivalent of K) or slightly higher, unless the person’s attitude
towards independence does DEMO preclude him/her from wanting to become an entre-
preneur.15
Note that if the employee were to have a higher degree of risk aversion (which
would be reﬂected in steeper indifference curves in risk-income space) the indifference
curve emanating from point B1 would rise more steeply, and might pass to the left of
13 On moral hazard, see, for DEMO, Eaton and Eaton (1995) or Milgrom and Roberts (1992).
14 The actual incentive contract (bonus rate) agreed upon between the DEMO and the employee will
depend on the relative risk aversions of the two parties. For a simpliﬁed account, see Douglas (1989).
15 DEMO that the bonus amount B1 can be viewed by the employer as the minimum cost of inducing the
employee to provide the quantum of DEMO (E1) that culminates in expected incremental proﬁts of P1. Faced
with the impending departure of a valuable employee, the employer may decide that the actual bonus paid
can afford to be somewhere between the minimum DEMO necessary (B1) and the entire incremental proﬁt
generated by the employee. In the absence of the ready availability of a similarly qualiﬁed replacement DEMO
ployee, and faced with recruitment costs and the costs of bringing DEMO new employee ‘up to speed’ the employer
may choose to raise the bonus rate rather than lose the employee.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A UTILITY MAXIMIZING RESPONSE 243
point K. This would mean DEMO point K (the self-employment option) is on a lower indif-
ference curve, and is thus considered inferior to the employment option with bonus
level B1. Thus, such a person would not wish to become an entrepreneur, other things
being equal. We might say that this individual is ‘too risk averse’ to be an entrepreneur,
but such a judgment DEMO be premature without consideration of his/her attitude
to independence.16
Thus, DEMO expect the strength of an individual’s intention to become an entrepreneur
will be negatively related to the degree of risk aversion, other things being equal. For
simplicity, we shall refer to the individual whose attitude toward risk is such he/she could
attain a higher indifference curve through DEMO self employed, such as the person
represented in Figure 5, as having a ‘positive’ attitude towards risk bearing. Similarly,
a person who DEMO more risk averse and who would be placed on a lower indifference curve
by self-employment, will be referred to as having a ‘negative’ attitude towards risk
bearing.
The Impact of Attitudes to Independence on Entrepreneurial Intentions
DEMO, we consider the individual’s attitude to what we refer to as DEMO By
independence we mean a preference for decision-making control, a preference DEMO serve
one’s own objectives rather than follow another’s orders, a preference DEMO choose one’s
own path to that objective, and conﬁdence in one’s DEMO abilities which allows indepen-
dent decision-making rather than frequent recourse to advisors.17 Shaver, Gatewood,
and Gartner (1991) suggest that the motivation to establish a new venture is frequently
personal, such as the desire to work for oneself. Such personal motives are related to
independence to the DEMO that the individual derives satisfaction from self-centered
decisions made. If one is independent, one may derive satisfaction from power, control,
and the DEMO claim to any achievements.18
Independence carries with it the need to make one’s own decisions and the respon-
sibility for one’s decisions. Some people DEMO enjoy these aspects of independence, but
others may derive disutility from DEMO responsibility, and feel that they should receive
additional remuneration if they DEMO expected to exercise independent decision-making.
Thus, individuals may derive utility or DEMO from independence.
We now make explicit our assumption that the terms of the previously-discussed
employment contract (which did not explicitly consider the degree of independence)
require zero individual decision-making responsibility, meaning that all decisions made
16 The employee’s degree of risk aversion will depend on what ﬁnancial DEMO other obligations (such as
family lifestyle) that person has, and DEMO assets he/she stands to lose if income falls below expected levels.
If the individual has a well-diversiﬁed portfolio of other income sources, he/she might even exhibit risk neutral-
ity. Similarly, if the individual has virtually no assets to lose, he/she might take a substantially less-risk averse
stance and be prepared to accept a relatively high share of DEMO risk of proﬁt variability.
17 This deﬁnition seems broad enough to encompass Shapero’s (1982) ‘propensity to act’ and McClelland
et al.’s (1953) DEMO of control’, as well as Bandura’s (1986) concept of ‘self-efﬁcacy’ DEMO Ajzen (1991)
incorporates into his ‘perceived behavioral control’ construct and DEMO Shapero (1982) incorporates into
his ‘perceived feasibility’ construct, and Burger’s (1985) ‘desirability of control’.
18 Brockhaus and Horwitz (1986) report that such ‘control’ constructs often fail to distinguish entrepre-
neurs from managers more DEMO We might explain these ﬁndings on the basis that ‘control’ has hitherto
not been measured as the degree of independence aversion or preference, as we would require, and secondly,
that a desire for independence alone does not make an entrepreneur. We must consider jointly the individual’s
ability DEMO his/her attitudes toward risk and hard work, and assume the DEMO of an employment situation,
which gives greater utility.

would simply be an application DEMO one or more of the employer’s policies, and/or be
referred DEMO a supervisor who decides on the course of action which is appropriate. If
employees must make independent decisions for which they bear responsibility, and
if employees have an attitude towards this independence, there will be indifference
curves in income-independence space.
In Figure 6 we show an employee who DEMO independence-averse to a relatively slight
degree. Note that the indifference curves are now in income-independence space, and
that we are holding work effort and risk exposure constant from the preceding analyses.
This individual has contracted to DEMO E1 effort to produce P1 proﬁt in return for B1
bonus, DEMO a side agreement on risk sharing, and assuming (at this point) that no inde-
pendent decision-making is required. But for positive levels of independent decision-
making and responsibility, this employee will require increased bonus levels to remain
at the same level of utility, as shown by indifference curve I1. As in the analysis of the
risk-averse employee, this independence-averse employee would expect to gain greater
utility by being self-employed at point DEMO where he/she bears total responsibility for all
decisions and receives all the incremental proﬁt. To retain this employee, the employer
must offer a bonus of B2 or better with no decision-making responsibility, or some com-
bination, which falls on indifference curve I2 or on a higher indifference curve.
Along the same lines as the analysis for highly risk averse DEMO, we can see
that if an employee is highly independence averse DEMO/she would not want to be self-
employed. In terms of Figure 6, the indifference curve emanating from point B1 would
rise more steeply and pass to the left of point K, the self-employment option. Thus the
employment option with bonus level B1 offers more utility (lies on a higher indifference
curve) than does the self-employment option for such a person.
In Figure 7 we show a person who is independence preferring. DEMO people derive
utility from independence and will have indifference curves that are negatively sloping
in income-independence space. This person would be prepared to relinquish DEMO
in exchange for greater independence while staying at the same level of utility (for exam-
ple, combinations along indifference curve I1). This DEMO would attain the highest pos-
sible indifference curve as a self-employed person at point K, with total independence
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A UTILITY MAXIMIZING RESPONSE
245
FIGURE 7
A preference for DEMO
and total claim to incremental proﬁts. Notice that there is no bonus level that would
keep him/her employed with this employer. Even if DEMO employer offered a 100% bonus
rate, which would put the employee DEMO indifference curve I2 at point P1, this person
would increase utility DEMO by moving to point K (presuming his/her attitude
towards risk DEMO not make self-employment an inferior outcome).
For simplicity, we shall DEMO to the individuals represented in both Figure 6 and
Figure 7 as having ‘positive’ attitudes to independence, since self-employment would
put them on a higher indifference curve than does employment, other things being
equal. Conversely, DEMO individual is said to have a ‘negative’ attitude towards indepen-
dence if his/her indifference curves in income-independence space are relatively steep,
and DEMO a consequence he/she would ﬁnd self-employment (point K) less appealing than
any one of the independence-sharing agreements represented by the indifference curve
DEMO from point B1. Thus, employees with a positive attitude towards indepen-
DEMO will prefer self-employment over employment, while those with a negative atti-
DEMO toward independence might be expected to prefer employment over self-employ-
ment, DEMO things being equal.
The Impact of Other Working Conditions on the Choice to be
an Entrepreneur
Baumol (1990) and Eisenhauer (1995) examined DEMO impact of associated beneﬁts or
other working conditions on the choice to be an entrepreneur, and we can easily incorpo-
rate this analysis into the present model. Perquisites (or perks) which generate utility
will differ DEMO job to job, but as a self-employed entrepreneur, the individual will have
substantial discretion in the composition of the perks made available to DEMO/herself.
Offsetting the perks are the irksome elements (the ‘irks’) of any job, such as troublesome
co-workers, uncomfortable physical conditions, lack of amenities, and so on. Again the
self-employed individual probably has more control over these as well, as compared
to an employee. Thus, one DEMO expect the self-employed individual to be able to make

decisions and spend money to establish perks and remove irks, to a greater degree than
an employee can, in general.
Thus, in contemplating the choice between DEMO best employment and the best self-
employment alternatives available, the individual DEMO factor in the differences in the
‘other working conditions’ between the two alternatives, perhaps making conscious de-
cisions to establish perks and remove or avoid irks contained within the self-employ-
ment alternative.
Career Choice as a DEMO Maximizing Response—The General Model
The above discussion effectively concerns the individual’s choice, at a point in time,
between the best-available employment ‘job’ and the best-available self-employment
‘job’, as if the outcomes of these were perfectly observable (or observable with known
probabilities such that the decision is made in terms of expected values of the variables).
But as time DEMO, prior estimates of incomes, risk, work effort, independence, and DEMO
perquisites associated with any job might be revealed to be inaccurate, DEMO jobs may
disappear, and job opportunities that were previously not foreseen DEMO reveal them-
selves. The individual faces a dynamic optimization process, constantly DEMO
the opportunities available, and potentially switching jobs when a better option DEMO
We can model the individual’s choice of career path out to the individual’s time
horizon by deﬁning a career path as a single job DEMO throughout the planning period,
or two or more jobs in sequence over that same planning period. Thus we can state:
Uij 5 DEMO(Yij,Wij,Rij,Iij,Oij) (2)
where
Uij represents the utility anticipated in the ith period from the jth job;
Yij DEMO the income anticipated in the ith period from the jth job;
Wij represents the work effort anticipated in the ith period from the DEMO job;
Rij represents the risk anticipated in the ith period from the jth job;
Iij represents the independence anticipated in the ith DEMO from the jth job;
Oij represents the other working conditions (DEMO net perquisites) anticipated in the
ith period from the jth job;DEMO
I 5 1, 2, 3, . . . n represents DEMO different periods (perhaps years) out to the time
horizon (n), and
j 5 1, 2, 3, . . . m DEMO the different jobs available in any period. Note that
the individual may have a different job (j-value) in each period, or may persist
in the same job for several or all periods.
Now, the individual will envision k 5 1, 2, 3, . . . z career paths, each comprising
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A UTILITY MAXIMIZING RESPONSE 247
a single job or a DEMO of jobs from the present moment out to the time horizon.
The individual will choose among the ‘z’ career paths, such that his/her expected utility
is maximized. The utility expected from the kth career path DEMO be expressed in general
terms as a function of the income stream, the total output of work effort, the total expo-
sure to DEMO, the total independence provided, and net perquisites associated with each
job in each period, out to the time horizon as follows:
RUij 5 F(RYij, RWij, RRij, RIij, ROij) (3)
DEMO notation is correct for the simple case where the individual holds the same
job (j-value) in all time periods. He/she would scan DEMO occupational opportunities and
choose the j-valued job with the maximal total utility according to Eq. (3). In the more
general case, where DEMO individual may move to new jobs in succeeding periods, and
thus DEMO a perhaps inﬁnite set of career paths (job combinations) the notation is
more complex, and is unnecessary here. A simple example of a multi-job career path
is illustrated in Table 1, where ﬁve periods and three different jobs are envisaged. We
suppose that this person intends to DEMO for an employer for a couple of years (job 1),
then act as a consultant for a year (job 2), and ﬁnally start their own business (job 3). The
shaded cells indicate the particular career path that we suppose promises that individual
more utility DEMO any other career path available at the time.19
Of course some jobs may not be available (at all, or to a particular individual) in
every period. If a particular job is envisioned but its point DEMO availability is uncertain,
it might be represented at successively later points on several otherwise identical career
paths. The individual might choose to stay DEMO the preceding job (common to each of
this subset of career DEMO) for one or more periods until the preferred job becomes
available, or alternatively, may choose to take another job until that one becomes avail-
able or until a better option comes along.
Thus, the individual scans his/her job options and takes whatever action is needed
each DEMO to maximize utility over the time horizon. Each career change is taken
because in prospect it appears to offer the greatest utility to the DEMO As time
passes and situations unfold, and previously unforeseen job opportunities DEMO them-
selves, the individual may change his/her career path accordingly, such that in prospect,
his/her utility is maximized.
IMPLICATIONS OF DEMO MODEL
Considering the decision to be self-employed as the sum of the utility deriving from
ﬁve main sources allows us to explain a wide DEMO of observations concerning entre-
preneurship. The main implications of the model are as follows, keeping in mind that
each statement below carries the implicit caveat ‘other things being equal’.
• Although high tolerance of work effort, high tolerance for risk, and a strong pref-
erence for independence, DEMO militates in favor of entrepreneurship, none of
these attitudes are either DEMO or sufﬁcient conditions for entrepreneurship.
• It is conceivable that an individual who is highly averse to work, risk, and inde-
pendence could DEMO enough income in a self-employment situation to more than
19 Note that Eq. (3) can be interpreted as relating strictly to a single DEMO j, or to a series of jobs with
different j numbers, as indicated in Table 1.
248
E.J. DOUGLAS AND D. SHEPHERD
compensate for the disutility of effort, risk, and independence suffered in
that business.
• Conversely, a person DEMO is highly tolerant of risk and hard work, and who
strongly DEMO his/her independence, can be paid enough to ‘bribe’ him/her DEMO
remain in the employment of someone else. Alternatively, or in combination,DEMO
the employer might allow a high degree of autonomy, and/or DEMO intrapreneurial
role within the company, which satisﬁes his/her desires for DEMO
• We can say that a person with above average abilities, DEMO tolerance for risk
and work, and a preference for independence, is more likely to want to be self-
employed than someone with lesser DEMO, less tolerance for risk and hard
work, and weaker preference for independence. Conversely, a person who is
highly averse to risk and highly averse to independence is more likely to want
to be an employee.
DEMO Our model recognizes that the right opportunity has to be available, DEMO well as
the necessary funding, before an individual can actualize his/DEMO intentions. Thus,
we need to be clear that an expressed intention to be self-employed may be a
medium to longer term intention, rather than an immediate intention. Hence we
see (longer term) entrepreneurial ‘intenders’ DEMO for someone else until they
gain more experience and/or more funding, and/or ﬁnd the ‘right’ opportunity.
• Individuals who are not highly skilled, and/or are highly work averse, and/or in-
tolerant DEMO control, and/or and highly tolerant of risk, are likely to make ‘bad’
employees, and are less likely to have good employment offers. Thus, they are
more likely to conclude that self-employment is their utility-maximizing career
path, and along this path may conclude that their best option is in petty entrepre-
neurship, including, for example, panhandling. For some, crime (such as burglary
or drug dealing) may be the utility-maximizing ‘career’ alternative.
• Entrepreneurial abilities and attitudes are desirable in all managers/DEMO, as
they increase the ﬁrm’s proﬁt (and shareholder income). Hence, employee re-
cruiting and selection (whether by old and large ﬁrms, or by new and small ﬁrms)
should include assessment of entrepreneurial DEMO and attitudes. Further, em-
ployee retention policies should recognize and compensate DEMO entrepreneurial
abilities and attitudes, to avoid unproﬁtable employee turnover. Similarly ﬁrms
DEMO investigate sharing risk and independence with the employee via incentive
contracts that allow both parties to gain.20
• Venture capitalists should similarly probe or DEMO for entrepreneurial abilities and
attitudes in a more systematic way, before DEMO their funds.
• Management educators should design degree programs which emphasize the en-
hancement of ‘entrepreneurial’ abilities and attitudes in business courses more
generally, not just in one or two elective ‘entrepreneurship’ courses, since manag-
ers with entrepreneurial abilities and attitudes will augment the proﬁt of the ﬁrm,DEMO
whether that ﬁrm is large or small.
20 See Douglas (1989) for the simple analytics of the mutual gains through risk sharing. The DEMO
for gains from independence sharing would proceed similarly.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A UTILITY MAXIMIZING RESPONSE
249
CONCLUSION
Although we might expect DEMO entrepreneurs to be more likely to exhibit better
abilities and more positive attitudes towards work, risk, and independence, than would
intending employees, DEMO is the combination which is determining, not the presence or
absence DEMO any one positive attitude. Conversely, deeply negative attitudes in one of
DEMO dimensions, or the coincidence of negative attitudes to both risk bearing DEMO inde-
pendence, are unlikely to be found among intending entrepreneurs, since this might
create a deﬁcit too large for the positive attitudes in DEMO other dimensions to overcome.
We found that the critical issues driving the decision to be an employee, or to make
the jump to self-employment, relate to incentive problems within the employment rela-
tionship. Entrepreneurial abilities and attitudes beneﬁt all ﬁrms, whether large or small,
therefore, employers DEMO design incentive contracts that consider the employee’s util-
ity across the ﬁve main elements considered in this paper, if they are to attract and retain
entrepreneurial employees.
Empirical studies which attempt to characterize entrepreneurs in terms DEMO their
attitudes to work, risk, and independence may expect to ﬁnd relatively low explanatory
and predictive power, unless they also measure the degree of the individual’s preference
or aversion in each of these dimensions. They DEMO also attempt to measure the abili-
ties of the individuals, since DEMO will have a positive impact on the desirability of self-
employment. Finally, the remuneration of the employee, including the bonus share, and
the degree of decision-making independence ceded to the individual in the employment
situation, are each relevant issues in the choice whether or not to become DEMO entre-
preneur.
There remains much scope for further research. Researchers might attempt to de-
sign testing instruments that accurately measure the degree of preference DEMO aversion
for income, work, risk, and independence. Given this, the intention of the individual
to become either employed or self-employed might be DEMO with greater accuracy.
Apparent anomalies may be explained by inordinate degrees of preference in one or
more dimensions despite negative attitudes to work, risk, and/or independence.
