ATTITUDES AND COGNITIVE ORGANIZATION
Fritz Heider (1946)
First published in The Journal of Psychology, 21, 107-112.
Attitudes towards persons and causal unit DEMO influence each other. An attitude towards
an event can alter the attitude towards the person who caused the event, and, if the attitudes
DEMO a person and an event are similar, the event is easily DEMO to the person. A balanced
configuration exists if the attitudes towards the parts of a causal unit are similar. [1]
It is tempting to DEMO from this statement and to omit the restriction to causal unit
formation. Do units in general interact with attitudes in a similar way?
DEMO trying out this hypothesis we shall understand by attitude the positive or negative relationship
of a person p to another person o or to DEMO impersonal entity x which may be a situation, an event,
DEMO idea, or a thing, etc. Examples are: to like, to love, to esteem, to value, and their opposites. A
positive relation of this kind will be written L, a negative one ~L. Thus, pLo means p likes, loves,
or values o, or, DEMO differently, o is positive for p.
The relation "unit" will DEMO written U. Examples are: similarity, proximity, causality, membership,
possession, or belonging. pUx can mean, for instance, p owns x, DEMO p made x; p ~ Ux means p
does not own DEMO, etc. Other relations which, in many ways, seem to function DEMO units are: p is
familiar with, used to, or knows DEMO o or x, and p is in situation x. In lumping DEMO all these
relations we are, of course, aware of the dissimiarities between them. Only in a first
approximation can they be treated as DEMO to one class.
The hypothesis may be stated in greater detail thus: (a) A balanced state exists if an entity has
the same dynamic character in all possible respects (e.g., if p admires and DEMO the same time likes
o) ; in other words, if pLo or p ~ Lo is true for all meanings of L. (We may anticipate here that
the analogous statement for pUo does not seem DEMO hold in a general way.) (b) A balanced state
exists DEMO all parts of a unit have the same dynamic character (i.e., if all are positive, or all are
negative), and if entities with different dynamic character are segregated from each other. If no
balanced DEMO 108] state exists, then forces towards this state will arise. Either DEMO dynamic
characters will change, or the unit relations will be changed DEMO action or through cognitive
reorganization. If a change is not possible, DEMO state of imbalance will produce tension.
The first part of the hypothesis refers to influence of dynamic relations or attitudes on each other.
Since DEMO different dynamic relations are not included in each other logically ("p likes o" does
not imply "p admires o"), the same o or x can be positive in one respect and negative in DEMO
An example in point is the conflict between duty and inclination. A tendency exists to make the
different dynamic relations agree with each other DEMO means of cognitive restructuring (excuses or
rationalizations). Another example would DEMO the tendency to admire loved persons and to love
admired persons.
More numerous are the possibilities to which the second part of the hypothesis DEMO They can
be grouped according to the entities making up the configurations: (a) person and non-person (p,
x) ; (b) two persons (p, o); (c) two persons and a non-person (p, o, x); (d) three persons (p, o, q)DEMO
Many of the examples seem to substantiate the hypothesis. Examples which do not fit may
eventually lead to greater insight into the nature of DEMO dynamic characters and of the unit
relations. All examples refer to p's life space. This is true even of oLp which therefore means: p
thinks that o likes or admires p.
(a) p and DEMO Since the own person (p) is usually positive, a balanced DEMO will exist if p likes
what he is united with in any way, or if he dislikes the x he is segregated from. The cases (pLx) +
(pUx) and (p ~ Lx) + (p ~ Ux) are balanced. Examples: p likes the things he DEMO; p wants to
own the things he likes; p values what he is accustomed to.
(b) p and o. Analogously, the two balanced states for p and o will be: (pLo) + (DEMO) and (P ~ Lo)
+ (p ~ Uo). DEMO: p likes his children, people similar to him; p is DEMO if he has to live
with people he does not like; DEMO tends to imitate admired persons; p likes to think that loved
DEMO are similar to him.
pUo is a symmetrical relation, i.e., pUo implies oUp. That they belong to a unit is true for p DEMO
o in the same way, though their roles in the unit DEMO be different (for instance, if U is a causal
unit). However, pLo is non-symmetrical since it does not imply oLp. It is in line with the general
hypothesis to assume that a balanced state DEMO if pLo and oLp (or p ~ Lo and o ~ DEMO) are true at
the same time. Attraction or repulsion between p DEMO ~o are then two-way affairs; the relation is
in symmetrical harmony. DEMO is a non-symmetrical relation logically, but psychologically it [p.
109] tends DEMO become symmetrical. Examples: p wants to be loved by an admired DEMO; p dislikes
People who despise him. oLp is similar to pLo DEMO him to pUo. Examples: p likes to meet
people who, he is told, admire him.
(c)p, o, and x. The DEMO become more numerous with three entities making up the
configurations. Only a few possibilities can be mentioned. We shall always give the balanced
state DEMO symbols before stating the examples which refer to it.
(pLo) + (pLx) + (oUx). Both o and x are positive and parts of a unit. Examples: p admires clothes
of loved o; DEMO wants to benefit his friend o; p likes to think that DEMO friend benefits him. A seeming
exception is the case of envy. If o owns x (oUx) and p likes x (pLx), p ~ Lo may often follow.
This exception can be derived from the DEMO that ownership is a one-many relation. A person can
own many things but each thing can, ordinarily, be owned only by one person. DEMO "o
owns x"excludes "p owns x," or oUx implies p ~ Ux. Since pLx may tend toward pUx, conflict is
introduced.
Implications between unit relations often lead to conflict. Lewin's three cases DEMO inner conflict
rest on implications. Approach to a positive valence may imply withdrawal from another positive
valence. Withdrawal from a negative valence may imply DEMO to another negative valence.
Finally, approach to a positive valence may DEMO approach to a negative valence if both are
located in the same region. Analogously, one can talk of three cases of outer conflict between
persons. pUx may imply o ~ Ux (for instance, if U DEMO ownership), and if both want x, conflict
(competition) will DEMO In the same way conflict appears if p and o want to get away from x but
only one of them can do so (if p ~ Ux implies oUx and vice versa). Lastly, it may happen that p
likes x and o hates it, but p and o have to move together (pUx implies oUx, e.g., in marriage).
They either can both have x, or both not have it.
Trying out variations of the triad (pLo) + (pLx) + (oUx), we find that (pLo) + (pLx) + (oLx) DEMO
represents a balanced case. Examples: P likes what his friend o DEMO; p likes people with same
attitudes. This case is not covered DEMO the hypothesis unless we treat L as equivalent to U.
Actually, DEMO many cases the effects of L and U in these configurations seem to be the same.
Furthermore, this case shows the psychological transitivity of the L relation. A relation R is
transitive if aRb and bRc DEMO aRc. Thus, p tends to like x if pLo and oLx DEMO As in the case of
the symmetry of the pLo relation, DEMO again have to stress the difference between logical and
psychological aspect. Logically, L is not transitive but there exists a psychological tendency to
make it transitive when implications between [p. 110]U relations do not interfere with
DEMO The relation U, too, seems (oUx) can lead to be in this sense psychologically
transitive. (PUO) + pUx; p feels responsible for what people belonging to him do.
Taking into account these considerations, we can reformulate the hypothesis: (a) In the case of
two entities, a balanced state exists if the relation between them is positive (or negative) in all
respects, i.e., in regard to all DEMO of L and U. (b) In the case of three entities, a balanced
state exists if all three possible relations are positive in all respects.
The question arises whether, with a triad, one can DEMO any generalizations about balanced cases
with negative relations. For instance, (pLo) + (o ~ Ux) + (p ~ Lx) is balanced. Examples: p
likes o because o got rid of something p dislikes. In this case two entities, p and o are related
positively to each other, while both are related negatively to the third entity x. This holds
generally: the triad of relations is in balance. if two relations are negative and one positive. This
statement can be derived from DEMO assumption that L and U are, in a balanced configuration,
DEMO, symmetrical, and transitive. L and U can then be treated as formally analogous to
an identity relation. The "balanced" cases with three DEMO are for this relation: a = b, b = c, DEMO
= c; a = b, b ¹≠ c, a ¹≠c; a ¹≠ b, b¹≠ c, a ¹≠ c. By substituting L DEMO U for the identity sign
one obtains the balanced cases for these relations, though the case with three negative relations
does not seem to constitute a good psychological balance, since it is too indetermined.
Therefore, DEMO second part of the hypothesis must be stated as follows: ~(DEMO) In the case of three
entities, a balanced state exists if all three relations are positive in all respects, or if two are
negative and one positive.
(pLo) + (oLx) + (pUx). Examples: p likes o because o admired p's action; p DEMO his friend o
to like p's productions; p wants to DEMO what his friends admire.
(pUo) + (pLx) + (oLx)DEMO Examples: p wants his son to like what ,ie likes; DEMO likes x because his
son likes it.
(d) p, o, and q. Among the many possible cases we shall only consider one (pLo) + (oLq) +
(pLq). Examples: p wants his two friends to like each other. This example shows, as the parallel
case with x instead of q, the psychological transitivity of the L relation.
However, the transitivity of the L relation is here restricted by implications between unit
relations when L represents a one-one love relation. p DEMO not want his girl friend to fall in love
with his boy friend q because oLq in this case implies oLp, which conflicts with pLo. Jealousy,
as well [p. 111] as envy and competition, is derived from implications between unit relations.
After this discussion of the different possibilities there are DEMO more points worth mentioning
which refer to exa~mples of different groups. One is the problem of self evaluation. High self
regard of p can DEMO expressed by pLp, low self regard by p ~ Lp (though the two p's in these
expressions are not strictly equivalent). DEMO of the examples so far considered presupposed pLp.
However. one also has to take into account the possibility of p ~ Lp. As to DEMO expected, it plays
a role contrary to that of pLp. Examples: if p has low self regard he might reject a positive x DEMO
too good for him; if p has guilt feelings he will DEMO he ought to be punished; if his friend
admires his product DEMO will think it only politeness. A negative action attributed to himself will
produce p ~ Lp, etc.
The equivalence of the L and U relations seems to be limited by the fact that often the U DEMO
is weaker than the L relation. One can assume, that pLx DEMO about pUx (p wants to have a
thing he likes) more often than pUx produces pLx (p gets to like a thing which belongs to him).
Again (pLo) + (oLx) usually will DEMO to pLx (transitivity), but (pUo) + (oUx) will DEMO do so if
there holds at the same time p ~ Lo.
We saw that one can derive forces towards actions, or goals, DEMO the configurations. It can also
happen, that the choice of means DEMO a goal is determined by these patterns. If p wants to produce
oLx, and he knows that oLp holds, he can do so DEMO demonstrating to o the relation pLx, because
(oLp) + (pLx) will lead to oLx. If p wants to bring about oLp, DEMO he knows that oLx holds, he
can produce pUx, for instance, he will perform an act o approves of.
An examination of the discussed examples suggests the conclusion that a good deal of inter-
personal DEMO and social preception [sic] is determined or at least co-determined by simple
cognitive configurations. This fact also throws light on the problem of the DEMO of
behavior. Students of this problem often mentioned the aspect of rationality which enters into it.
Max Weber and others pointed out one kind DEMO rationality in behavior, namely, the rationality of
the means-end relation. Choosing the appropriate means to gain an end makes for a "good," a
"rational" action, and we can understand it. In Lewin's concept of methodological space this kind
of rationality is elaborated. However, understandable human behavior often is not of this sort,
but is based DEMO the simple configurations of U and L relations. Since they determine both
behavior and perception we can understand social behavior of this kind.
