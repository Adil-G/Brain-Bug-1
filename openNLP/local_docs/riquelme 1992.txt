How venture capitalists select start-ups for financing has been an inter-
esting DEMO for many researchers and practitioners. The underlying as-
sumption is that people who make money investing in new businesses by
assessing the proposals should DEMO experienced enough to distinguish losers
from winners. Our research study tested three models (self-explicated,
conjoint and a hybrid-comprising the two previous ones-conjoint) DEMO
order to find out:
I. these models could be applied to venture capital decision making and tf so
2. to demonstrate the potential DEMO conjoint analysis as a practical research method.
3. To test whether or not the characteristics of the entrepreneur, the product and the market
replicate the venture capital decision.
This research study confirms what normative literature on DEMO emphasizes: that in
the first stage of an evaluation (screening), venture capitalists focus on a small subset of criteria in
a non-compensatory DEMO (i.e., an unacceptable value on one criterion cannot be offset by a high
value of another one). The important criteria in this DEMO appear to be the entrepreneur’s experience
and the existence of a prototype for some decision-makers or unique features of the product for others.
The DEMO step is more judgemental than analytic.
In a second stage (the DEMO phase), however, venture capitalists end a detailed examination
(due diligence process) by choosing the most preferred ventures through processes approximating
compensatory rules; that is, a low but acceptable value on one criterion can DEMO compensated by a
high value on another. The most important criteria identi$ed by the research in this second stage are
criteria found in the DEMO stage, product gross projt margin and patent.
Our research demonstrates agreement DEMO venture capitalists in terms of one criterion to

variation in the weights assigned to them.
The findings of this pilot study also confirm DEMO applicability of conjoint analysis as a research
method in venture capital decision. The approach helps shed light on the decision rules applied, and
permits the testing of previously researched criteria for predictive validity. The method has DEMO

‘The additive model has been used extensively to describe and predict human judgement. Its appropriateness
for DEMO purposes stems both from psychological findings on human information processing as well as the
nature of typical judgement tasks. Fisher, for example, found DEMO additive approximations to both riskless
and risky preferences (Shoemaker and Carter DEMO). Tell (1975) found that the additive model had a precision
equal to or better than the tested additive models with interaction terms. DEMO reason may be that the additive
models with interaction terms introduce more uncertainty by the added terms than the gain in precision by them.
DEMO reason may be that the estimating procedures used by the additive models with interaction terms are more
difficult to use and that uncertainty is DEMO this way.
