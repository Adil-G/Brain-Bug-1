This paper examines how decision makers cope when faced
with trade-offs between a higher quality alternative and a DEMO
price alternative in situations where both alternatives involve
relatively unfavorable versus relatively favorable values for qual-
ity. We hypothesize that choices between alternatives defined
DEMO unfavorable quality values will generate negative emotion,
resulting in emotion-focused coping behavior. Choosing the
higher quality alternative (i.e., maximizing the quality attribute
DEMO choice) appears to function as a coping mechanism in these
situations. DEMO apparently coping-motivated choice effects are
found even after methods are implemented to control for more
cognitive factors associated with manipulations of quality-attri-
bute value, such as the possibility that unfavorable attribute val-
ues are associated with DEMO attribute ranges and therefore
increased relative importance for quality. q 2000 Academic Press
INTRODUCTION
Imagine that you are taking a job in a new DEMO and, because of the travel
requirements of your job, you are constrained to select an apartment located
in a particular section of the DEMO In fact, you must choose between only two
apartments. The apartments DEMO very similar, except one apartment is more
expensive but offers greater DEMO to building occupants while the other apart-
ment is cheaper and less safe. How would you make this choice? Would you

simply focus on one attribute and maximize it (e.g., simply renting the safer
apartment)? Or would you make a trade-off between the attributes (e.g., explic-
itly balancing your utility for lower DEMO against your utility for increased
safety)? Further, would the manner DEMO which you resolve this price–quality
trade-off be influenced by the degree to which you perceived the average safety
level of the two apartments to DEMO relatively favorable or unfavorable? That is,
would your decision differ DEMO on whether your choice presented a trade-
off between a moderately safe versus an extremely safe apartment or between
an extremely versus a moderately DEMO one?
The apartment example above captures two central aspects of choice: attri-
bute conflict and attribute valence. First, choices are often characterized DEMO
conflict; specifically, choices typically confront the decision maker with mutu-
ally exclusive courses of action such that each satisfies some goal(s) relatively
better than another (or others). The presence of conflict is arguably the most
basic aspect of decision making, for an active decision is necessary only when
there is some conflict between alternatives. Second, the valence of conflicting
attributes may be relatively more favorable or unfavorable. For instance, an
individual who describes an alternative as the “lesser of two evils” DEMO reflecting
a belief that the relevant decision conflicts involve unfavorable attribute values.
In this paper, we are concerned with the emotional consequences of unfavorably
valenced attribute conflicts and the associated implications for decision
behavior.
The general DEMO of attribute valence is related to the extremely robust
finding that decision behavior is typically characterized by loss aversion (e.g.,
Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). We extend work on loss aversion in two ways.
First, we look at valence in the absence of specific reference points framing
unfavorable versus favorable attribute values as losses or gains. Both real-
world DEMO laboratory choice situations are often characterized by absent, ambig-
uous, or multiple reference points (Kahneman, 1992). In understanding real-
world decision DEMO, it may often be more difficult to define losses and gains
DEMO it is to define more general impressions of favorable versus unfavorable
attribute values. Similarly, while most preference-evaluation techniques can
avoid presenting decision makers with explicit reference points, these tech-
niques almost always mix decision trials associated with relatively favorable
versus unfavorable attribute values. By evaluating attribute valence in DEMO
absence of explicit reference points, we seek to illustrate the generality DEMO the
relevant choice effects.
Second, following earlier work on decision conflict (e.g., Lewin, 1951; Miller,
1959), we address the emotional nature of decision valence, in particular how
desires to cope with unfavorable attribute values may alter choice patterns.
We develop and test the hypothesis DEMO a decision maker ’s desire to cope with
the emotional threat presented by choice options providing only unfavorable
quality-attribute values leads to quality-maximizing decision DEMO (i.e.,
choice of the alternative that is best on the DEMO valenced quality attri-
bute, with relatively little regard for the overall DEMO utility of that alterna-
tive). We illustrate that such coping effects operate over and above effects driven
276
LUCE, PAYNE, AND BETTMAN
by more cognitive or perceptual considerations (e.g., steeper value functions for
losses). We do this by utilizing a highly controlled experimental paradigm,
manipulating the valence of quality attribute DEMO in the context of choices
between a higher quality, higher price DEMO and a lower quality, lower
price alternative. We utilize price–quality attribute DEMO because our prior
work indicates that price provides a relatively emotionally neutral background
condition against which we can compare reactions to varying (i.e., DEMO
valenced versus unfavorably valenced) quality-attribute values. In particular,
decision makers DEMO to associate relatively little negative emotion with
trading off currency attributes such as price or time (Luce, Payne, & Bettman,
1999). Further, we believe that distinctions between favorable and unfavorable
attribute values are more likely for quality than for price. Quality attributes
tend to involve DEMO with definable endpoints and therefore relatively clear
midpoints, perceptually separating attribute DEMO into relatively unfavorable
and favorable regions. Conversely, prices are more fungible DEMO therefore less
likely to be associated with naturally definable upper and lower bounds within
a particular decision domain.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT
Attribute DEMO, Value, and Negative Emotion
Conflict can be defined as the competing response tendencies arising when
one of a set of multiple alternatives must DEMO chosen (e.g., Berlyne, 1961;
Coombs & Avrunin, 1976; DEMO, 1951). The relative value or valence of these
alternatives has DEMO been recognized as an important moderator of responses
to conflict. For instance, Miller (1959) found that approach –approach conflicts
(where choice is DEMO desired but mutually exclusive alternatives) were
particularly easy to resolve, in that movement toward one valued alternative
caused a weakening of response tendencies DEMO the other(s). Approach –
avoidance conflicts (where each alternative DEMO both desired and unde-
sired characteristics) were considered somewhat more difficult, while avoid-
ance–avoidance conflicts (where choice is between undesired alternatives) were
DEMO most difficult to resolve and often resulted in extended vacillation
between alternatives. Thus, in general, the introduction of avoidance goals to
a choice DEMO is proposed to make that situation more difficult. Miller ’s
work operationalized this difficulty as the measured physical vacillation dem-
onstrated by rats as DEMO were confronted by choices between simple alterna-
tives (i.e., an avoidance–avoidance dilemma between two electric shocks). How-
ever, this theory extends relatively directly to human choice, where vacillation
is associated with aversive feelings of “decision conflict” or related negative
emotion during choice (see Schneider, 1992)DEMO
This core distinction between approach and avoidance is often made in the
more basic literature on emotion as well. For instance, Lazarus (1991) proposes
that a major determinant of the (positive versus negative) valence DEMO experi-
enced emotion is an individual’s cognitive appraisal of the degree to which the
UNFAVORABLE ATTRIBUTES
277
goals that are relevant to a situation are likely DEMO be threatened/blocked versus
achieved. Both Miller ’s conflict theory and Lazarus’s emotion theory address
the individual’s situation at a relatively macro level, making the commonsense
prediction that less favorable decision alternatives or situations are associated
DEMO more negative affect. In order to make specific predictions regarding
attribute valence, we extend this notion to include the valence of particular
attributes within an overall decision situation. That is, following Coombs and
Avrunin (1977), we extend the notion of valence in conflict to the level of specific
attributes. Even within a situation that seems favorable overall (e.g., DEMO
a new apartment), we believe that the introduction of specific attributes defined
by unfavorable values can increase negative emotion. Clearly, more favorable
attribute values are likely to be associated with increased subjective probabili-
ties that DEMO goals provided by the relevant attribute (e.g., the goal of survival
for a safety attribute) will be achieved. This adaptation of Lazarus’s (DEMO)
emotion theory to the specific context of a multiattribute decision situation is
consistent with previous work in which we have demonstrated that attribute
DEMO and values jointly influence the emotional nature of decision tasks
(e.g., Luce, 1998; Luce, Bettman, & Payne, 1997; Luce et DEMO, 1999). Considering
in particular price–quality trade-off situations, and focusing on the impact of
variation in quality-attribute values, we make the following hypothesis:
EMOTION HYPOTHESIS. Decision makers will associate more negative emotion with price–
DEMO trade-offs defined by unfavorable (versus favorable) quality-attribute values.
Coping with Unfavorable Quality-Attribute Values
Our emotion hypothesis predicts that unfavorable attribute values elicit
negative DEMO Our primary question of interest is how do decision makers
respond to these proposed emotional threats? Several different theoretical ap-
proaches address how cognitive processes are influenced by negative affect,
resulting in multiple, opposing possible hypotheses. One important distinction
among such approaches is that some involve hypothesized DEMO of moods
generated independent of one’s current cognitive task(s) while DEMO specifi-
cally involve emotions generated in reaction to these current tasks (DEMO Yates,
1990, on the task –ambient distinction). Ambient moods DEMO task-related
emotions appear to influence cognitive processing in distinct ways (e.g., Boden-
hausen, 1993; Christianson, 1992). As we are interested in how decision behav-
ior is altered when the decision itself is emotion-laden, the emotion literature
seems more directly relevant to our theoretical framework. However, we also
review the mood literature below, a s the influence of mood on decision tasks
has been studied more extensively than has the DEMO of task-generated
emotion.
Negative affect may function as a signal drawing attention to situations
requiring consideration and/or action. This function is one possible DEMO
for the finding that negative moods elicit more careful, narrow, and analytic
decision processing (Isen, 1987; Schwarz, 1990; Schwarz & Bless, 1991). Nega-
278
LUCE, PAYNE, AND BETTMAN
tive emotions may also function to DEMO attention to problematic situations,
allowing immediate adjustments to one’s action tendencies (e.g., Frijda, 1988;
Mandler, 1990; Simon, 1967) and/or more controlled problem-focused coping
attempts to solve the underlying problem leading DEMO the negative emotion
(e.g., Folkman & Lazarus, 1988; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Within a decision
domain, careful, analytic processing is typically associated with extensive infor-
mation search during which decision makers balance DEMO attributes
(e.g., Frisch & Clemen, 1994; Payne, Bettman, & Luce, 1996). Further, problem-
focused coping motivations will likely result DEMO attempts to increase decision
accuracy, that is, to resolve the problematic choice situation in the manner
that best represents underlying preferences (Luce et al., 1997). Thus, if affect
functions to increase analytic processing DEMO problem-focused coping, we expect
decision makers experiencing negative emotion as a DEMO of price–quality
trade-offs to balance price versus quality according to the relative importance
of each attribute.
Two additional theoretical approaches lead to the opposite DEMO regard-
ing negative affect. First, negative affect may decrease attentional capacity,DEMO
particularly if it is associated with increased arousal (e.g., Eysenck, DEMO;
Lewinsohn & Mano, 1993), actually degrading cognitive performance. Negative
DEMO are also associated with an increase in the incidence of task-irrelevant
thoughts (Siebert & Ellis, 1990). Second, decision makers experiencing negative
emotion may be motivated to engage in simplified processing. In fact, even the
finding that negative moods encourage more analytical processing may follow
from decision DEMO seeking to alleviate negative affect by immersing them-
selves in the relevant decision task (e.g., Isen, 1987). If such distraction is the
underlying reason for these mood effects, the relationship between negative
affect and analytical processing seems likely to reverse when the task itself is
the DEMO of negative affect. Such adaptivity in attempts to alleviate negative
affect is consistent with Forgas’s (1991) finding that decision makers experienc-
ing negative DEMO favor personally rewarding over more task-competent part-
ners, but only when DEMO expect to directly interact with the partner and
therefore to reap any mood-enhancing benefits of this interaction. Motivations
to alleviate negatively emotional states are DEMO with the second class of
coping behaviors identified by Lazarus and Folkman (1984), namely emotion-
focused coping, or coping that directly alters DEMO experience (e.g., through
avoidance) without addressing the underlying problem leading DEMO the emotion.
Thus, due to either degradation of cognitive ability or DEMO coping
motivations, negative affect may elicit more simplified, avoidant decision
processing.
Simplified or avoidant decision processing may take multiple forms. First,
decision DEMO may avoid negatively emotion-laden decisions altogether, for
instance by maintaining the DEMO quo or transferring decision responsibility
to another party (Janis & Mann, 1977; Luce, 1998). However, this sort of
metalevel avoidance strategy may not always be available to the decision
maker. Given that a DEMO is to be made, the decision maker may engage
in partial DEMO by using a simplified strategy. One can array specific
UNFAVORABLE ATTRIBUTES
279
decision strategies according to the degree of conflict confrontation (versus
conflict avoidance) required by each. Hogarth (1987) notes that more conflict-
avoiding decision strategies provide the dual advantage of minimizing both
cognitive DEMO and emotional costs. For instance, a lexicographic decision
strategy (choosing the alternative that is best on the most important attribute)
avoids consideration DEMO problematic between-attribute trade-offs by focusing
the decision maker on one particular attribute in choice.
In summary, various approaches to the influence of affect on decision behavior
result in contradictory predictions. We resolve these inconsistencies by arguing
DEMO individuals experiencing decision-elicited affect will exploit the nature of
their decision task in order to engage in coping. That is, when the source of
negative emotion (i.e., unfavorable quality-attribute values) is a salient aspect
of the choice task, we hypothesize that coping behavior designed to mitigate
the impact of this source will be generated. In price–quality trade-off situations
characterized DEMO unfavorable quality-attribute values, we expect decision mak-
ers to engage in DEMO by selecting the option with the best available value
on the quality attribute that is the source of emotional threat. In effect, we
expect decision makers to simplify their strategies by avoiding giving up quality
when DEMO emotion is generated through concerns over this attribute. This
reasoning is similar in spirit to work on mood congruency effects (e.g., Bower,
DEMO) in that negative affect associated with a particular attribute may fuel
DEMO elaboration on and concern regarding that attribute and specifically
regarding the dangers of accepting low values on the attribute. In addition, by
maximizing quality, individuals will be able to express to themselves (and to
others) that they did all they could in order to minimize the impact DEMO the
problematic, unfavorably valued attribute on decision outcomes. In fact, a
lexicographic choice strategy maximizing quality may allow for a dominance
structure (where the chosen option is cognitively framed as dominating all
other options; see Montgomery, 1983) in that disadvantages of the chosen option
(here, DEMO higher price) are not explicitly acknowledged by one’s decision rule.
CHOICE DEMO Decision makers confronted with unfavorable (versus favorable) quality-
attribute values will be motivated to minimize the associated negative emotion by choosing
the quality-maximizing DEMO
Our choice hypothesis essentially involves incorporating the additional goal
of coping with negative emotion into the theoretical framework arguing that
decision makers seek to DEMO accuracy and minimize cognitive effort (see
Bettman, Luce, & Payne, 1998, for an expanded choice–goals framework).
Consistent with Payne, Bettman, and Johnson’s (1993) effort –accuracy frame-
work, however, we retain DEMO notion that decision makers will exploit aspects
of their decision environments in seeking to attain these metagoals. In the
next section, we more explicitly consider predictions regarding attribute value
that follow from a focus on factors DEMO with more perceptual (e.g., loss
aversion) and cognitive (e.g., DEMO –accuracy trade-offs) factors.
280
LUCE, PAYNE, AND BETTMAN
Controlling for Cognitive Factors
Decision makers DEMO show asymmetrical responses to losses versus gains
of equivalent magnitude (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Payne, Laughhunn, &
Crum, 1980; Tversky & Kahneman 1991). These asymmetrical responses are
typically attributed to the nature of the function scaling attribute values into
utilities. Decision makers appear perceptually DEMO to changes in attribute
values rather than to absolute levels, exhibit DEMO sensitivity to these
changes at increasing magnitudes, and tend to be DEMO adverse to ac-
cepting losses (versus to forgoing gains). For DEMO, diminishing sensitivity
predicts that the difference between a $10 gain and DEMO $20 gain (or loss) will
seem subjectively larger than the difference between a $100 gain and a $120
gain (or loss). Loss aversion predicts that a given distance on an attribute scale
($10) DEMO be mapped onto greater utility when it is lost (versus gained)DEMO Work
on loss aversion therefore clearly establishes that subjective attribute ranges
may be a function of the valence of attribute values, if favorable attribute
values are perceived as gains and unfavorable attribute values as losses, which
seems likely (e.g., if scale midpoints serve as reference points). DEMO
ranges, in turn, may sometimes influence attribute importance weights
(Fischer, 1995; Goldstein, 1990). Thus, for instance, Tversky and Kahneman
(1991) demonstrate that a given difference between attribute values (e.g., the
difference between a 10- and a 20-min commute time for an apartment) is likely
to have a greater impact on choice outcomes when that DEMO represents a
loss (e.g., one currently has a 5-min commute) DEMO when it represents a gain
(e.g., a current 25-min commute).
In decision situations posing a conflict between price and quality, lowering the
value of the quality attribute might therefore increase the relative importance
attached DEMO quality (over price) through the perceived range of quality-attribute
values. Effort –accuracy research has clearly demonstrated that decision mak-
ers respond to attribute DEMO weights, for instance, shifting toward more
lexicographic strategies in situations where one attribute is of relatively high
importance (e.g., Bettman, Johnson, DEMO, & Payne, 1993; Payne, Bettman, &
Johnson 1988). In general, focusing on more important attributes in choice
will provide favorable effort –accuracy ratios. Thus, an unaugmented effort –
accuracy approach suggests that decision makers responding to attribute im-
portance weights may show increased quality-attribute DEMO when
quality-attribute values are unfavorably valenced.
In summary, there are at DEMO two competing explanations for unfavorable
quality-attribute values causing a shift toward quality-maximization in price–
quality trade-off situations. First, and consistent with our choice hypothesis,
decision makers may be motivated to cope with the emotional threat DEMO
by the presence of unfavorable attribute values by avoiding an explicit trade-
off on the problematic attribute. Second, assessments of relative attribute
importance may be affected by an increase in subjective attribute ranges for
unfavorable attribute DEMO Because we believe both mechanisms will likely
UNFAVORABLE ATTRIBUTES
281
operate on choice, we seek to demonstrate coping-motivated shifts after control-
ling for these more cognitive factors.
Methodology for Isolating Coping DEMO of Attribute Valence
Above, we develop theoretical arguments specifying that unfavorable DEMO
attribute values may elicit more quality-maximizing choice patterns because
of emotion-focused coping considerations (our “value” effect of interest) but also
potentially because of DEMO considerations associated with the influence of
subjective ranges on attribute importance weights (a “range” effect). At first
glance, it seems difficult to DEMO that one effect is operating on choice,
while ruling out the other. Fortunately, it is possible to disentangle these effects
by considering differing preference-elicitation tasks. In particular, we are able
to disentangle value effects from range effects by using both matching and
choice response modes in tandem (see Fig. 1 for example tasks).
Consistent with previous work (Luce, Payne, & Bettman, 1999), we expect
emotion-focused coping considerations to have a greater impact on choice pat-
terns than on matching-task responses. DEMO tasks require subjects to
make an explicit trade-off; the emotional difficulty DEMO doing so may be buffered

LUCE, PAYNE, AND BETTMAN
by the absence of a commitment DEMO a specific course of action. Choice tasks, on
the other hand, are likely to elicit more negative emotional threat (because
the decision maker is providing hypothetical commitment to a course of action)
but allow DEMO coping through lexicographic choice on a problematic attribute.
Thus, we expect DEMO tasks to be influenced by emotional value effects more
than matching tasks are.
Further, previous work indicates that the influence of subjective attribute
ranges on attribute importance weights should be greater for matching tasks
than for DEMO tasks. Specifically, Fischer (1995) demonstrates that quantita-
tive tasks requiring DEMO attribute trade-offs (including matching) are more
sensitive to attribute range effects on importance weights than are more quali-
tative tasks that can be DEMO based on attribute importance orderings
(such as choice). Based on DEMO (1995), we expect matching tasks to be
influenced by subjective DEMO ranges more than choice tasks are.
In summary, we expect emotional DEMO regarding coping with unfa-
vorable attribute values to have a particularly noticeable effect on choice (ver-
sus matching) while we expect considerations regarding DEMO attribute
ranges to have a particularly noticeable effect on matching (versus DEMO).
Thus in our two experiments, we used a choice-matching paradigm DEMO is
adapted in order to separate value from range effects by evaluating inconsisten-
cies between responses to the two types of task.1
EXPERIMENT 1
DEMO Experiment 1, we show that decision makers are more likely to DEMO
quality in choice when quality-attribute values are relatively unfavorable ver-
sus relatively favorable. We also implement a bisecting task designed to control
for subjective DEMO ranges. Thus, Experiment 1 is designed to address
attribute value effects DEMO holding constant attribute ranges; Experiment 2
will more directly compare effects DEMO attribute value and range by manipulating
both. In both experiments, we DEMO evaluate the degree to which subjects’
1 The most often studied source of choice-matching preference reversals is the attribute promi-
nence effect, where relatively more important attributes are weighted more heavily in choice than
in matching (e.g., Fischer & Hawkins, 1993; Tversky, Sattah, & Slovic, DEMO). This prominence
hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for our results only if there is reason to believe
that quality is both more important DEMO price and relatively more important in unfavorably
valenced (versus favorably valenced) conditions. Thus, as discussed in the context of the experi-
ments, DEMO implemented careful controls to disentangle range-importance effects from value effects.
As a further control, we developed our stimuli so that price was often the more important attribute,
and we took measures of attribute importance as DEMO check of this. As intended, subjects indicated
that price was more DEMO than quality for 59% of trials in Experiment 1 and for 65% of trials
in Experiment 2. In these cases, the prominence hypothesis predicts a general preference for the
lower quality alternative in choice as compared DEMO matching (opposite to our value prediction).
Further, the attribute importance measure did not interact with our value effects and our substan-
tive DEMO remain unchanged if we analyze only the trials for which price is rated more important.
See Luce et al. (1999) for a more DEMO treatment of these issues.

postchoice assessments of negative emotion are consistent with our DEMO
regarding the use of quality-maximization as a coping mechanism.
Methods
Experimental Design
Forty-eight undergraduate students completed this study as part of a course
requirement. DEMO were asked to complete matching and choice tasks posing
price–quality trade-offs within an apartment rental context. Both the neighbor-
hood’s safety and the apartment’s DEMO condition were used as quality attri-
butes. Condition was expressed on a 100-point scale (best value 5 100), and
Safety was expressed in terms of the probability (from 1 to 25%) of being a
DEMO of crime in 1 year of living in the apartment. Subjects considered both
a favorable value and an unfavorable value version of each quality-attribute/DEMO
rent pairing. Unfavorable value trials involved the worst versus the average
value for the quality attribute; favorable value trials involved the average
versus the best value. The “average” attribute value was defined individually
for each subject/DEMO combination, based on the subject’s response
to a bisecting task designed DEMO hold constant subjective attribute ranges. Two
random orders and the reverse of these orders were utilized, but there were
no significant order effects. Thus, the effective experimental design involves
quality-attribute identity (condition versus safety) and quality-attribute value
(favorable versus unfavorable), both manipulated within subjects.
Tasks and Procedure
Instructions, bisecting tasks, matching tasks, and then choice tasks were all
presented to subjects using the Mouselab computer program (Payne et al.,
1993). Initial task instructions described the safety, condition, and DEMO attri-
butes in some detail. In particular, subjects read a table DEMO attribute
definitions, plus descriptions of the worst and the best attribute DEMO This
table was in paper form, and subjects were encouraged to DEMO the table for
reference throughout the experiment. This detailed range knowledge was par-
ticularly necessary for the bisecting task and was thought to be DEMO for the
matching and choice tasks as well. The program presented matching and choice
stimuli in the form of a two-alternative, two-attribute matrix of information.
Each task is defined below.
Bisecting task. Subjects’first experimental task was DEMO, or specifying
a midpoint for each quality attribute based on individual DEMO for that attri-
bute. Standard task instructions from the decision analysis literature were
used (von Winterfeldt & Edwards, 1986), and two practice DEMO tasks were
completed initially. The average midpoint assigned to the condition scale was
53 (scale 5 1 to 100) and the average midpoint DEMO to the safety scale
was 11% (scale 5 1 to 25%)DEMO Thus, subjects’expressed attribute utility functions
were both slightly nonlinear, although expressed utility for safety was concave
284 LUCE, PAYNE, AND BETTMAN
on average while utility for condition DEMO convex. Recall that the midpoint
each subject specified for each attribute was assigned as the average value
during construction of unfavorable value (worst-to-average) DEMO favorable
value (average-to-best) conditions. Of course, the best and worst DEMO
values corresponded to the scale endpoints provided to subjects.
Matching-choice methodology. The second task was a matching task essen-
tially asking subjects to specify DEMO willingness to pay for increased quality. In
particular, for each of DEMO four quality-attribute by value tasks, subjects were
asked to specify a DEMO for a higher quality alternative that made it equally
preferred (for DEMO subject) to a lower quality alternative (see Fig. 1). The lower
quality alternative in each pair was always priced at $500 in DEMO rent.
Prior to the experimental matching trials, subjects were given two DEMO
matching tasks. Following each practice task, a screen identical to the DEMO
matching-task screen but including the subject’s matching response appeared,
and subjects were instructed that they should be indifferent between choosing
to rent either DEMO the two apartments if they had completed their matching
task correctly. Thus, subjects were explicitly instructed as to the (normative)
requirement that DEMO responses should directly correspond to their
choice behavior.
The next phase of the experiment involved choice. The quality-attribute
values were always identical for the DEMO and choice tasks, and the lower
quality alternative in each choice DEMO, a s in each matching pair, always had
a $500 rent. Within this choice context, the rent for the higher quality alterna-
tive for each choice was determined individually for each subject, based on his
or her earlier matching-task response to the relevant trial (where, for DEMO,
the unfavorable-value, condition-attribute task represented one matching
trial). For DEMO matching trial, five choices were constructed by systematically
arraying prices for DEMO high-quality alternative around each subject’s earlier
matching-task response. These prices were constructed (by the computer pro-
gram) based on the following procedure. First, the difference between the
matching-task response (the rent assigned by the subject to the high-quality
apartment during matching) and $500 (the rent specified DEMO the low-quality
apartment) was calculated. The lowest price level (Level 1) was calculated by
subtracting half of this difference from the matching response, and the next
price level was calculated by subtracting one quarter of this difference from
the matching response. The next price level (Level 3) was the matching response
itself, and the following price levels added DEMO quarter (Level 4) and then one
half (Level 5) of the difference to the matching task response. Thus, five choices
were constructed for each matching trial so that prices of the high-quality
alternative were DEMO around the earlier matching-task response in equal
increments from one another. If choice- and matching-elicited preferences are
equivalent, subjects would be expected to favor the high-quality alternative
for Choice Levels 1 and 2, favor the low-quality alternative for Levels 4 and
5, and be indifferent at Price Level 3.
Whether the high-quality alternative was listed first or second in the DEMO
UNFAVORABLE ATTRIBUTES 285
matrix was counterbalanced across trials. Subjects were not given DEMO that
were explicitly labeled as practice; however, the first two choice trials were
fillers, to allow acclimation to the choice task.
Emotion manipulation checks. Our theorizing regarding the effects of attri-
bute values involves the DEMO emotion generated during decision pro-
cessing, and we expect that decision DEMO who are able to successfully cope
with this in-process negative emotion by maximizing quality may report rela-
tively low levels of retrospective emotion after DEMO decision. However, we did not
want to focus subjects artificially on DEMO of negative emotion during their
decision processing, so we desired to DEMO our emotion hypothesis using less
obtrusive retrospective emotion measures. This is possible because we assume
in-process negative emotion generated by low quality-attribute values will DEMO
mitigated only if the decision maker maximizes quality in choice. However,
choice is clearly influenced by a wide variety of factors in addition DEMO coping
considerations, so some subjects are expected to forgo quality-maximization in
DEMO even when this strategy provides coping benefits. Thus, we expect to DEMO
clear effects of unfavorable (versus favorable) value on retrospective emotion
following choices that do not maximize quality (i.e., following choice of the DEMO
price alternative). We expect these value effects to be mitigated or removed
following choices that maximize the quality attribute (see Luce, 1998, on retro-
spective versus in-process negative emotion).
We were further concerned DEMO even retrospective measures of negative
emotion would become tedious for subjects if collected after each of 22 choices
(20 trials plus 2 fillers). Thus, subjects were asked to answer three emotion
questions after a sampling of eight choice trials. All subjects answered emotion
questions after each of DEMO 4 choices for which the high-quality alternative was
priced at Level 3 (equal to their previous matching-task response). Half of the
subjects also answered the emotion questions after each Price Level 1 choice
(where the high-quality alternative was at its cheapest value, and below the
subject’s matching-task response), while the other half answered the emotion
questions after each DEMO Level 5 choice (where the high-quality alternative
was at its most DEMO level). This design collapses across between- and
within-subjects sources of variation; we treated price level as a between-sub-
jects factor in the relevant analysis, for conservative tests.
Dependent Measures
Our primary dependent variable is the proportion of the five choices per
task that favor the high-quality alternative. DEMO choice shares control for
individualized matching-task responses, in that the price DEMO the high-quality
alternative is set according to each subject’s relevant matching task response.2
2 Our paradigm of multiple price levels also allows us to DEMO whether subjects’ expressed
choices are monotonic over increases in the expense of the high-quality alternative. We create a
monotonicity index for each choice task DEMO computing and summing all 10 possible paired compari-
sons between the five choices associated with each task for each subject. For Experiment 1, 96%
of comparisons indicate monotonicity (94% for Experiment 2). In addition, DEMO substantive results

LUCE, PAYNE, AND BETTMAN
Although our summary choice proportion measure DEMO not strictly continuous,
it is analogous to a 6-point (0, .2, .4, .6, .8, 1.0) rating scale assessing relative
propensity to choose the high-quality alternative.
Subjects’ matching-task responses are not of primary DEMO in this experi-
ment, as the matching task was used primarily DEMO order to develop choice
stimuli controlling for relative attribute ranges and importance weights. How-
ever, because our theoretical development involves comparisons of matching
versus choice tasks, we will report matching-task responses.
The final dependent measure of interest is the average of three 7-point
emotion scales. Scales addressed how DEMO versus bad the subject had felt
during the previous decision task (DEMO scored), how difficult the previous
decision task had been, and DEMO stressful the previous decision task had been.
The coefficient alpha for the summary scale measure is 0.79.
Results
If subjects calculate price–quality trade-offs in DEMO the same manner
across matching and choice tasks, then average choice DEMO should be
roughly .50 (1.0 for Price Levels 1 and 2, 0 for Levels 4 and 5, and 0.50 reflecting
random choice for Level 3). We did not expect this pattern of results, as we
argued that motivations to cope with unfavorable attribute values would have
DEMO particularly strong effect on choice (versus on matching) tasks, leading DEMO
jects to the relatively obvious coping strategy of maximizing quality in choice,
even at relatively high price levels.
Choice
As expected, the value manipulation affected choice, with a significantly
increased tendency for subjects to choose the high-quality alternative for the
unfavorable-value trials (F(1, 47) 5 48.08, p , .0001; Munfavorable 5 0.82 versus
Mfavorable 5 0.55)DEMO The attribute by value interaction is also significant
(F(1, 47) 5 6.23, p , .02). However, the value effect is directionally consistent
across both the condition attribute (Munfavorable 5 0.86 versus Mfavorable 5 0.48)
and the safety attribute (Munfavorable 5 0.78 versus Mfavorable 5 0.62). The (safety
versus condition) attribute replication factor did DEMO have a significant effect
(F(1, 47) 5 0.41, ns).
Matching
Subjects gave higher matching-task responses to the unfavorable value trials
(F(1, 47) 5 7.24, p , .01; Munfavorable 5 DEMO versus Mfavorable 5 1229). Subjects
also valued the condition attribute more highly in matching, on average
remain unchanged (and, in fact, DEMO statistically stronger) if we reanalyze our choice data
after removing any DEMO containing one or more violations of monotonicity across the five
relevant choices.

and value DEMO not significantly interact (F(1, 47) 5 0.48, ns).
Summary of Matching-Choice Comparisons
As expected, we found a value effect on choice, even though choice stimuli
were adjusted for value effects expressed through matching responses. Note,
in particular, that subjects’ higher relative valuation for unfavorable-value
trials in matching was insufficient to account for their even greater DEMO
valuation for quality in the unfavorable-value choice conditions. Conversely,
note that while subjects indicated a higher relative valuation for the condition
(versus the safety) attribute in matching, there was no attribute-identity effect
on choice DEMO Thus, the higher matching-task responses for the condition
attribute appear to DEMO been sufficient to account for greater relative valuation
of condition over safety in choice (through the higher average expense associ-
ated with the high-quality condition alternatives during choice). This provides
indirect evidence that our methodology DEMO for more cognitive sources of
influence on choice.
Emotion Scales
Emotion-scale data were analyzed by value, attribute, and a factor reflecting
each subject’s DEMO for the relevant trial. As expected, low versus high-quality
choice interacts DEMO the value manipulation (F(1, 268) 5 4.74, p , .03). As
the means in Table 1a indicate, emotion ratings are sensitive to the value
manipulation following choice of the low-quality alternative, with the effect
mitigated following choice of the high-quality alternative.
There is an DEMO interaction for value and price level (F(1, 268) 5 DEMO,
p , .01). The unfavorable-value condition increases negative emotion more for
Price Level 5 (Munfavorable 5 3.48 versus Mfavorable 5 2.85) DEMO for Price Level
3(Munfavorable 5 3.02 versus Mfavorable 5 2.92) DEMO Price Level 1 (Munfavorable 5
2.61 versus Mfavorable 5 2.32). DEMO this second interaction was not explicitly
predicted, it seems intuitive that DEMO would be more difficult for subjects to cope
with unfavorable quality-attribute value at higher price levels.
Finally, three significant main effects are found. First, subjects rate unfavor-
able-value choices as more emotion-laden (F(1, 268) 5 10.83, p , .001; Munfavora-
ble 5 3.03 versus Mfavorable 5 2.75). Subjects also rate choice tasks as increasingly
emotion-laden at DEMO price levels (F(1, 47) 5 4.63, p , .01; M1 5 2.47 versus

M3 5 2.97 versus M5 5 DEMO). Finally, subjects rate choices as more emotion-
laden after choosing DEMO low-quality (versus the high-quality) alternative
(F(1, 268) 5 DEMO, p , .01; Mlow-Q 5 3.33 versus Mhigh-Q 5 2.72). The main
effect of attribute identity is not significant (F(1, DEMO) 5 1.01, ns). There are
no additional significant interactions. The emotion scale means by value, price,
choice, and attribute are DEMO in Table 1b.
Discussion of Experiment 1
Experiment 1 demonstrates that a manipulation of attribute value influences
choice patterns, even when choices are constructed based on subjects’ earlier
matching-task responses. The value effects within this paradigm DEMO that
subjects exploit the flexibility of the choice environment (e.g., the ability to
make one attribute predominant in their choice rule) to cope with the threat
presented by unfavorable quality-attribute values. Note that subjects’ choice
DEMO showed very close correspondence to their matching-task responses
under favorable value, DEMO choice proportions in that case were close to the 0.50
expected in the absence of matching-choice reversals in preference or strategy
selection (Mfavorable 5 0.55). However, under unfavorable value, expressed
choices deviated substantially from DEMO 0.50 benchmark (Munfavorable 5 0.82).
Thus, in general terms, DEMO find substantial choice-matching preference rever-
sals under unfavorable value, but relatively DEMO evidence of choice-matching
preference reversals under favorable value. Our emotion data support the
conjecture that choice-matching reversals under unfavorable value reflect cop-
ing considerations, in that choices were rated as particularly negatively emo-
tion-laden when attribute DEMO were unfavorable but the decision maker had
not maximized quality in choice.
Consistent with the development of our value hypothesis based on considera-
tions DEMO emotion-focused coping, we found the above value effects on choice
even DEMO we used a bisecting task to control for subjective attribute ranges.
Experiment 2 was designed to allow a direct comparison of range versus
value DEMO

EXPERIMENT 2
Experiment 2 differs from Experiment 1 in DEMO both value and range are
manipulated. Experiment 2 uses the same matching-choice methodology as
Experiment 1, with value and range expected to have differential effects across
the two tasks. Also, because quality attributes themselves may differ in terms
of many important properties associated with negative emotion (e.g., DEMO,
1998; Luce et al., 1997), Experiment 2 introduces two new quality attributes
to the apartment-rental context from Experiment 1.
Methods
Task DEMO Design
One hundred forty-three undergraduate subjects completed Experiment 2
as part of a class requirement. Seven subjects were eliminated from the analysis
for failing DEMO follow task instructions, leaving an effective sample size of 136
subjects. DEMO in Experiment 2 responded to tasks involving an apartment-
rental context and presented on computers using the Visual Basic software
program. There were three DEMO quality-attribute replications, pair-
ing Interior Space, Landlord Relations, or Safety DEMO attributes with Rent.
The Interior Space attribute involved apartment square footage. The Safety
attribute again involved the likelihood of being a crime victim. The DEMO
Relations attribute involved the likelihood of having lease negotiation or other
difficulties with apartment management. All three attributes were defined on
100-point scales, with 100 defined as the best possible attribute value and 0
described as DEMO worst. This method allows for more direct comparison across
attributes than was possible in Experiment 1, where attribute scale varied
with attribute identity. Attribute definitions, plus descriptions and examples
of the worst and the best attribute values, were provided to subjects on a piece
of paper available for reference during the entire experiment.
Experiment 2 manipulated value and range between DEMO Specifically,
the unfavorable-value conditions involved quality-attribute values centered on
30 (DEMO our 100-point scales), while the favorable-value conditions involved
attribute values centered on 70. The low-range conditions involved a spread
of 20 points between DEMO low- and the high-quality alternatives, while the high-
range conditions involved DEMO spread of 40 points. The resultant set of four
attribute values is presented in Table 2. Thus, the basic design for Experiment
2 contains two between-subjects factors (value and range, each with two levels)
DEMO one within-subjects replication factor (attribute identity, with three levels).
Procedure and Dependent Measures
Subjects completed matching and choice tasks consistent with the DEMO
from Experiment 1. Again, low-quality apartments for each trial were associ-
DEMO with a $500 rent. Several fillers were interspersed with matching and
choice trials. In particular, subjects completed matching-task responses pairing

also completed four filler choices for commute time and for condition, each
with varying quality-attribute values. Matching and then choice trials were
presented in an individually randomized order for each subject, with the excep-
tion that two filler tasks (not labeled as such) DEMO completed before each set
of randomly ordered trials began.
In order to minimize any potential experimental demand effects from asking
subjects about their feelings DEMO the collection of choice data, emotion ques-
tions were collected after DEMO measurement was complete. That is, after
completing the full set of DEMO, subjects were informed that they would be
asked to make six DEMO choices and that they would be asked a question
evaluating each choice. The specific question was an assessment of the negative
emotional stress associated DEMO the decision, scored using a scrollbar with
endpoints associated with values DEMO 0 and 100. The six emotion trials were
exactly identical to the choice trials associated with Price Level 1 (the high-
quality alternative’s cheapest price level) and Price Level 5 (the most expensive
price level) for each of the three quality attributes.3 Subjects completed one
practice question DEMO the six emotion measures were collected. The emotion-
question trials were presented in an individually randomized order for each
subject.
Results
Choice
As expected, the value manipulation has a significant main effect on choice,
with DEMO choice of the high-quality alternative across the unfavorable-
value conditions (F(DEMO, 132) 5 21.67, p , .0001; Munfavorable 5 0.85 versus
Mfavorable 5 0.71). Conversely, the range effect on choice responses is not signifi-
cant (F(1, 132) 5 0.09, ns; Mlow 5 0.77 versus Mhigh 5 0.79). Value and range
do not DEMO (F(1, 131) 5 0.75, ns). There is a main effect of attribute identity
(F(1, 282) 5 9.38, DEMO , .0001; MIneteriorSpace 5 0.75 versus MLandlordRelations 5 0.75
3 Thus, emotion measures involved repetitions of (a subset of) the choices from DEMO main experi-
ment. There was a high degree of correspondence between these repeat choices and subjects’earlier
choice results, with subjects indicating the same preference in 96% of cases.

291
versus MSafety 5 0.84). There are no significant DEMO associated with
attribute identity. Table 3 reports average choice by attribute, DEMO, and range.
Matching
Recall that range effects are expected to be DEMO strong for trade-off-
based tasks such as matching (Fischer, 1995). As expected, subjects reported
higher matching-task responses across high-range tasks (F(DEMO, 132) 5 36.42,
p , .0001; Mlow 5 683 DEMO Mhigh 5 848). Matching-task responses were
not, however, sensitive to the value manipulation (F(1, 131) 5 0.37, ns;
DEMO 5 773 versus Mfavorable 5 757). Thus, the significant value DEMO on
matching responses in Experiment 1 may have been attributable to differences
in subjective range across the value conditions (even though the bisecting task
was implemented to control for range). Value and range do not DEMO for
matching-task responses (F(1, 131) 5 0.00, ns). There is a main effect of
attribute identity on matching responses (F(1, 282) 5 45.24, p , .001;
MInteriorSpace 5 805 versus MLandlordRelations 5 675 versus MSafety 5 816). Finally,
there DEMO a range by attribute interaction for matching-task responses
(F(1, 282) 5 5.97, p , .002). Although in the same direction DEMO all three
attributes, the range effect is stronger for the interior DEMO (712 versus 898)
and safety (711 versus 920) attributes, as compared to the landlord relations
attribute (624 versus 725). There are no other significant effects.
Summary of Matching-Choice Comparisons
We predicted that DEMO would have a relatively stronger effect on matching
responses while value would have a relatively stronger effect on choices. Our
results clearly supported this DEMO That is, matching responses were
significantly influenced by range, but not by attribute value. Conversely, choices
were significantly influenced by value, but DEMO by range. More precisely, subjects
apparently did not adjust their matching DEMO to account for the value
effects that became relevant in choice, DEMO with our conjecture that
coping with unfavorable attribute values would have a greater impact for
choice. Subjects did appear to appropriately adjust their matching-task DEMO
sponses to account for range effects in choice, in that the DEMO manipulation

had a nonsignificant effect on choices, once choice stimuli (specifically, the
price of the high-quality option) were adjusted based on earlier matching-
task responses. Similarly, the significant range by attribute manipulation in
matching was not mirrored in the choice data. Finally, note that, unlike Experi-
ment 1, Experiment 2 showed an effect DEMO attribute identity on choice responses,
over and above the effect of attribute identity on matching-task responses.
Although this issue is not of direct DEMO here, it appears that the attribute
identity effect on choice (involving higher tendencies to maximize the safety
attribute) could have followed from divergence in emotional potential across
attributes.
Emotion Scales
Recall that emotion scales were DEMO for the lowest and the highest price
level for each attribute. As expected, value interacts with choice (F(1, 682) 5
3.77, p , .05). As the means in Table 4a indicate, unfavorable value is associated
with increased negative emotion after choice of the low-quality DEMO,
but not after choice of the high-quality alternative. This pattern of results again
indicates that choosing the high-quality alternative provides coping benefits,
DEMO the negative emotion associated with unfavorable quality-attribute
values. Value also interacts with price level (F(1, 682) 5 8.21, p , .004), a
finding that is similar to the emotion findings in Experiment 1. Unfavorable
value is associated with more negative emotion when the high-quality alterna-
DEMO is expensive (means within Price Level 5: Munfavorable 5 36 versus Mfavorable
5 34), but this effect actually reverses when the high-quality DEMO is
cheap (Level 1: Munfavorable 5 16 versus Mfavorable 5 19).
The only other significant effects are the main effects of attribute (F(1, 682)
5 4.21, p , .02; MInteriorSpace 5 26 versus MLandlordRelations 5 24 versus MSafety 5
28), price level (F(1, 682) 5 199.60, p , .0001; M1 5 DEMO versus M5 5 35), and
choice (F(1, 682) DEMO 12.03, p , .001; Mlow-q 5 39 versus Mhigh-q 5 22). Note that
the range manipulation does not enter into any significant DEMO on emotion.
This provides support for our contention that range effects are more cognitive
in nature than value effects. The emotion-scale means by value, choice, and
price are presented in Table 4b.
Discussion of Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we extend our demonstration of value effects on choice by
crossing manipulations of both value and range. Once again, we find that when

choice stimuli are tailored to individual matching-task responses, matching
responses appear to account for some choice considerations (i.e., range effects
on relative quality versus price DEMO) but not for others (i.e., coping
considerations involving unfavorable attribute DEMO). Note that, unlike in
Experiment 1, choice proportions for the high-quality alternative were substan-
tially above 0.50 across all conditions. Thus, subjects in Experiment 2 seemed
to show a general increased preference for maximizing DEMO quality attribute
in choice (versus matching). Even given this general DEMO for choosing
high-quality alternatives, the choice data indicate a significant value DEMO
Choice findings were also again confirmed by emotion scale responses, in DEMO
subjects reported more negative emotion for unfavorable-value tasks when they
had chosen the low-quality option, but not when they had maximized quality.
Because a relatively strong manipulation of range (e.g., 20% versus 40% of the
DEMO scale) was insufficient to influence choice over and above matching, we
believe that variances in subjective range are an unlikely alternative explana-
tion DEMO the value effects on choice in Experiment 1. Given previous work on
attribute range effects (Fischer, 1995), one might actually expect any DEMO
choice divergence due to range to involve overemphasizing higher attribute
ranges in matching responses (as compared to choice), resulting in less quality-
attribute maximization in choices as quality-attribute range increases.
GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Summary
DEMO two experiments reported in this paper both support the general hypothe-
sis that subjects will adjust their choices to cope with the greater negative
DEMO associated with unfavorable (versus favorable) quality-attribute values
in price–quality trade-off situations. In particular, subjects were more likely
to make quality-maximizing choices when the quality attribute was character-
ized by unfavorable (versus favorable) values. This DEMO pattern occurred
even though stimuli across both unfavorable and favorable value choice tasks
were constructed based on subjects’ earlier matching values. The assumption
that DEMO will operate as a coping mechanism in choice is
supported by self-reported emotion data. Subjects report experiencing negative
294
LUCE, PAYNE, AND BETTMAN
emotion after an unfavorable-value choice situation DEMO resolved in favor of the
low-price (and therefore lower quality) alternative, but this negative emotion
is mitigated by choice of the high-quality alternative in the pair.
Implications for Understanding Choice
While it has long been DEMO that decision makers value minimizing losses
more highly than they value maximizing gains of equivalent magnitude, we
believe we have extended this finding in two meaningful ways. First, we demon-
strate attribute value effects in the absence of explicit reference points framing
these values as gains or losses. DEMO, consistent with our earlier investigation
of the emotional nature of reference DEMO effects on decision behavior (Luce,
Payne, & Bettman, 1999), we demonstrate that it is possible to make unique
predictions by considering the emotional nature of value effects.
We believe that value effects of DEMO type we investigate are extremely perva-
sive in real-world decision situations. In some choice situations, the general
quality of all considered alternatives may appear unfavorable to the decision
maker. For instance, a car buyer subject to a substantial budget constraint
may perceive that all reasonable options have unfavorable DEMO (relative to
all available options) in terms of valued quality attributes such as performance
or safety. More generally, almost any reasonably complicated real-world deci-
sion situation is likely to involve some attributes that are perceived DEMO the
decision maker as offering relatively unfavorable values at some phase in the
decision process. For instance, even in the absence of real budget constraints,
automobiles that offer favorable levels of performance and safety tend DEMO offer
relatively unfavorable levels of fuel economy; thus, a decision maker choosing
among a subset of high-end automobiles is likely to perceive that DEMO fuel
economy attribute has unfavorable values across all considered options. In
such situations, decision behavior may in part focus on efforts to cope with the
threat generated by these perceptions of unfavorable quality.
Our results also DEMO to the importance of acknowledging minimizing nega-
tive emotion as a metagoal driving decision behavior, and of theoretically distin-
guishing between types of affect and likely coping strategies in understanding
the interplay between affect and decision DEMO selection. For instance,
negative moods are often associated with more careful, analytic processing,
and a resultant decrease in cognitive bias (e.g., Isen, 1987; Schwarz, 1990). A
straightforward application of this finding would associate our unfavorable-
value situation with a lower incidence of choice-matching DEMO reversals.
We believe that the reason for our seemingly contradictory finding of increased
inconsistency between choice and matching response modes with unfavorable
values is DEMO subjects exploited the content of their decision tasks and in
particular the fact that it was possible to use a choice strategy mitigating losses
DEMO the problematic attribute. On the other hand, our findings are broadly
DEMO with previous research demonstrating a shift toward simpler deci-
sion strategies under negative moods. However, a straightforward application
of that finding would likely lead to the prediction that decision makers in the
UNFAVORABLE ATTRIBUTES 295
unfavorable-valence condition should use a lexicographic strategy maximizing
the DEMO important attribute. Again, we are able to increase predictive power
by DEMO that the relevant affect in this case is tied to a specific
component of the decision situation, and thus is likely to encourage quality-
maximization even across the choices for which price is rated as relatively
DEMO important.
Methodological and Measurement Implications
Any empirical evaluation of preference based on choice patterns (e.g., conjoint
or similar decision analysis methodologies; see Green, Krieger, Agarwal, &
Johnson, 1991; Green & Srinivasan, 1990) is likely to mix decision trials associ-
ated with favorable attribute values and trials associated with unfavorable
attribute values. Thus, one of subjects’ considerations in responding to these
tasks is likely to be coping with the DEMO emotion associated with the
unfavorably valued trials. Further, tasks such as DEMO or rating-based
conjoint (e.g., Green & DeSarbo, 1978; Green & Krieger, 1995) may underesti-
mate coping effects on choice such as DEMO value effect we demonstrate. More
generally, our experiments indicate an additional DEMO source of response
mode effects in preference-elicitation that may extend to many areas of psycho-
logical measurement. For instance, any sort of rating scale provided to subjects
is likely to be subject to valence effects such DEMO the difference between ratings
at the upper end (e.g., 8 versus 9 on a 9-point scale) may have a different
psychological meaning to subjects than the same absolute difference at the
lower end (e.g., DEMO versus 2).
We believe that the matching-choice methodology reported in this paper is
a valuable paradigm for disentangling emotion-focused coping effects in choice
DEMO more cognitive considerations. We believe that considerations associated
with coping with unfavorable attribute values are likely to have a greater
relative impact on choice DEMO on matching tasks, for two reasons. First, match-
ing tasks constrain the subject to indicate a trade-off, effectively eliminating
a lexicographic strategy on a problematic attribute as a coping mechanism.
Second, matching tasks eliminate direct considerations associated with the
commitment to a course of action, and therefore responses to matching tasks
seem less likely to be associated with threats DEMO the individual’s reputation or
self-esteem as a decision maker (the most DEMO source of threat in a hypotheti-
cal decision task; see Janis & Mann, 1977, on types of threat in decision
making).4 Thus, it is possible to gain some estimate of the magnitude of coping
effects on choice by comparing across these response modes.
Future Research
Several DEMO for future research exist. It would be useful to expand
demonstration of value effects in choice beyond the task context used in this
4 DEMO conjecture is supported by preliminary research in which we found relatively low levels
of reported emotion, and no significant differences for a within-subjects value manipulation, within
the matching-task environment.

paper. For instance, it would be interesting to evaluate a greater range of
value conditions, such as mixed (e.g., one favorable and one unfavorable) value
conditions for quality. Similarly, it would be interesting to extend these effects
beyond simple price–quality attribute pairings. In particular, it is not clear
how decision makers would resolve conflicts between two unfavorably valued
quality attributes. Such difficult trade-offs are exceedingly DEMO in some
domains, such as the risk –risk trade-offs that are DEMO confronted in the
medical domain. For instance, women choosing whether to DEMO in hormone
replacement therapy during menopause essentially must trade off the probabil-
ity of certain deadly diseases (e.g., cancer) against the probability of others
(e.g., heart disease). In these and other medical dilemmas (e. g., deciding
whether to take the drug tamoxifen as a preventative measure for women at
high risk for breast cancer, or even deciding whether to engage in major but
elective surgery), the decision maker DEMO forced to make trade-offs between
probabilities of highly dreaded outcomes. In these situations, the qualitative
nature of conflicts may influence coping behavior. For instance, decision makers
may have different methods for coping with trade-offs between two physical
risks than for coping with trade-offs between a physical risk and DEMO psychological
cost. In general, richer and more varied decision situations are DEMO to be
associated with more varied and idiosyncratic strategies for engaging in emo-
tion-focused coping during choice.
Finally, perhaps the major opportunity for future research lies in additional
research methodologies. Our focus on the emotional nature DEMO decision tasks
suggests the utility of more naturalistic research methods where decision be-
havior could be observed in the context of real outcomes. While DEMO consider-
ations would constrain researchers’ abilities to implement manipulations of
real threats, observation may be useful for determining the generality of our
findings.
CONCLUSIONS
We find evidence that coping considerations influence decision strategy selec-
tion, in that decision makers appear to cope with relatively unfavorable (versus
relatively favorable) quality-attribute values by choosing an alternative that
maximizes quality. This finding is part of a growing body of research indicating
that emotional considerations influence DEMO behavior. Specifically, these
findings are consistent with recent developments broadening the DEMO
racy framework in order to accommodate additional goals, particularly the goal
DEMO minimizing negative emotion (Bettman, et al., 1998; Luce, et DEMO, 1997). More
generally, this work is responsive to recent challenges to investigate the impact
of decision makers’feelings, as well as the impact of their cognitions, on decision
behavior (e.g., Elster 1998; Larrick DEMO).
