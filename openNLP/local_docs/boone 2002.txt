learning to cooperate in a PD game because they are more endowed with the cognitive DEMO
necessary for quick learning than externals. Our empirical ﬁndings indeed reveal that externals play
less cooperatively, on average, in the ﬁrst part of DEMO series of PD games. However, this diﬀerence gradually

1. Introduction
Understanding the DEMO of cooperative behaviour has been an important issue on the
agenda of many social scientists for several decades. This is witnessed by the huge DEMO of early
experimental research in both economics and social psychology (Dawes, 1980; Pruitt & Kimmel,
1977; Rapoport, Guyer, & Gordon, 1976). In this research tradition, mixed-motive games, such
as the DEMO dilemma (PD), have been extensively used to model competitive versus DEMO
erative behaviour (Raiﬀa, 1982). The two-party version is the most widely used class of PD games
(Cox, Lobel, & McLeod, DEMO; Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977). This setup will be used in the present
study, too. Technical details of the PD are discussed at length elsewhere (e.g. Rasmusen, 1990). It
suﬃces to mention here DEMO the dilemma resides in the fact that the best possible outcome for all
parties as a group results when each party refrains from trying DEMO maximise her or his self-interest.
However, no matter what the other DEMO does, a player can always increase her or his payoﬀ in
DEMO short run by defecting unilaterally. Thus, it is to each individual’s DEMO to defect, at least
in the short run. Of course, when one of the parties defects, trust is undermined and cooperation
generally breaks down. The ﬁnal result is that when parties cannot resist the temptation DEMO defect,
both parties end up being worse oﬀ. It is this continuous tension between the long-run gains of
cooperation versus the short-term incentives DEMO compete which makes the game a realistic simu-
lation of real-world phenomena, and therefore interesting to study (Rasmusen, 1990).
Most experiments in the past have studied the impact of situational determinants on coopera-
tion. DEMO this respect, an interesting stylised fact is that subjects, at least from Western societies,
tend to prefer the competitive strategy when playing DEMO PD games. However, when indivi-
duals play several games in a DEMO against the same party, astute subjects quickly learn to coop-
erate DEMO often enter into tacit collusion (Raiﬀa, 1982). This is the case irrespective of whether or
not the repeated games have a ﬁnite (known) or inﬁnite (unknown) horizon. Individuals gradu-
ally learn to develop long-term thinking in these games, because they recognise their mutual
dependency in obtaining a reasonable payoﬀ (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977). So, repetition and learning
breed cooperation.
Whereas previous research almost exclusively focused on identifying DEMO circumstances trigger-
ing cooperative behaviour, the question whether and why individuals DEMO with respect to
cooperative behaviour received only scant attention. This is somewhat surprising as Kuhlmann
and Marshello (1975), already 25 years ago, DEMO that individuals have diﬀerent ten-
dencies to compete or cooperate in mixed-motive games, where these tendencies, or orientations,
are relatively stable. Because DEMO agree with Pruitt and Kimmel (1977), we followed their plea DEMO
study the impact of individual attitudes and personality traits on cooperation in mixed-motive
games. Speciﬁcally, we started a series of experiments with the purpose of investigating the
behavioural implications of speciﬁc personality traits in a PD DEMO We chose to focus on locus
of control in the current paper because it is a fundamental personality trait, which has been
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) 929–946
DEMO
shown to have important ramiﬁcations for behaviour in a social dilemma setting (Boone, De
Brabander, & van Witteloostuijn, 1999a, 1999b). Before summarising the major ﬁndings of our
previous work, recall that the locus of control construct refers to individual diﬀerences in a gen-
eralised belief DEMO internal versus external control of reinforcements (Rotter, 1966). Those who
believe in external control (i.e. externals) see themselves as relatively passive DEMO and believe
that the events in their lives are due to uncontrollable forces. Externals consider what they want
to achieve as dependent upon luck, chance and powerful persons or institutions. They think that
the probability of DEMO able to control their lives by their own actions and eﬀorts is low. Con-
versely, those who believe in internal control (i.e. internals) see themselves as active agents, feel
that they are masters of their fates and trust in their capacity to inﬂuence their environment.
Internals believe DEMO they control the events in their lives by their own eﬀort and skill.
In a previous experiment we found that, on average, internals DEMO signiﬁcantly more co-
operatively than externals in a repeated PD game (DEMO et al., 1999a, 1999b). The ﬁndings also
made clear that this diﬀerence was not the result of internals being more altruistic, but rather of
their tendency to use behaviour strategically in order to control DEMO environment to obtain
valued outcomes. In other words, internals play more DEMO, on average, in a PD because
it furthers their self-interest. In fact, they readily switch to a competitive strategy when this is
more appropriate to obtain a higher payoﬀ.
At a more general level, the results of the experiment made two things clear. First, it is essential
to study cooperative behaviour dynamically because individuals do not necessarily make an
DEMO/or choice between cooperation and competition, as is often implied in DEMO static analysis. As
a result, static analyses of cooperative behaviour largely DEMO the mark. Second, we also con-
cluded that the same comment DEMO be made concerning the behavioural consequences of diﬀer-
ences in locus of control. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁndings underscored the suspicion that what
distinguishes internals from externals is not so much average and stable diﬀerences in behaviour,
DEMO rather the capacity to adapt to diﬀerent circumstances over time. Again, DEMO for dif-
ferences at a speciﬁc point in time might be misleading. If we do not understand the overall pat-
tern and meaning of DEMO, analysing cross-sectional slices of that behaviour does not allow
us to DEMO unambiguous conclusions concerning the importance of individual diﬀerences.
In the present study we want to explore and combine the consequences of both of these DEMO
further. We argue that people from Western cultures, in which opportunism DEMO deeply rooted
(Boone & van Witteloostuijn, 1999), have to learn to cooperate in a PD game. They have to
understand that in DEMO long run cooperation is in their self-interest. There is, however, good rea-
son to believe that individuals diﬀer as to the speed of DEMO to cooperate. It is here that locus
of control enters the picture. We hypothesise that internals are more astute in learning to co-
operate DEMO a PD game. This proposition follows logically from the very deﬁnition of the concept.
Internals, who believe in their own potency to master their environment, are much more likely
than externals to use all their faculties to understand and inﬂuence their surrounding world as this
heightens the probability DEMO successfully regulating behaviour (Boone, 1992; Lefcourt, 1982; van
Olﬀen, 1999). Internals will question their assumptions more and will be more DEMO to cues
and feedback relevant to their decision making because they believe this may improve their per-
formance. To test the validity of these DEMO behavioural consequences of the locus of control
construct, numerous experiments were DEMO to relate locus of control with cognitive
activities like attention and alertness, and information search and assimilation. Reviewing this
932
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) DEMO
literature, Phares (1976, p. 78) concludes that internals ‘‘acquire more information, make more
attempts at acquiring it, are better at retaining DEMO, are less satisﬁed with the amount of information
they possess, are better at utilising information and devising rules to process it and generally DEMO
more attention to relevant cues in the situation.’’ All this provides strong support for the validity
of the locus of control construct as it DEMO indicative of a basic striving of internal individuals to
actively engage in the seeking for relevant cues in their environment to determine and make DEMO
out of their position and to guide or adapt their behaviour accordingly.
In the context of a PD game we expect that this eagerness DEMO internals to learn how the world
works, makes them more alert DEMO sensitive to the subtle interdependency of payoﬀs and the
long-run instrumentality of cooperation to obtain valued outcomes for one-self. However, we
think that externals will eventually catch up and change their strategy from competition to
cooperation, too. This is because (1) cooperation enhances self-interest and (2) DEMO has been shown
that externals are not less intelligent than internals (DEMO, 1982). We assert that externals just
learn slower than internals DEMO they are less endowed with the cognitive faculties that sustain
quick learning, as described earlier. To summarise, we expect that the ﬁnding of DEMO previous
experiment—internals behave more cooperatively than externals, on average—will only show DEMO
in the ﬁrst part of a series of PD games, but DEMO subsequently disappear. In the long run, that is,
when everybody DEMO and internalised the rules of the game, individual diﬀerences with respect
DEMO locus of control become irrelevant.
2. Method
2.1. Games
Because the experiment aims at extending insights from previous work, the games and
procedures we used in the present study are very similar to those in Boone DEMO al. (1999a, 1999b).
The experiment was conducted during a 4-week course on statistical methods for second-year
students of management and organisation at DEMO Dutch University of Groningen. The 4-week
course was part of a new curriculum, and only those students who had passed the ﬁrst-year
program were allowed to participate. At the onset of the experiment students ﬁlled out DEMO
(computerised) questionnaire, revealing background and personality information. The actual
experiment DEMO of two parts. In the ﬁrst week of the course 182 students played ﬁve
diﬀerent PD games in a row (Experiment I). To evaluate whether long-run learning actually
takes place, 92 of these 182 students volunteered to play the ﬁve PD games again 8 days later
(Experiment II).
It is important to stress that these 92 subjects were DEMO a random sample of the 182 who started
the course and participated in Experiment I. Instead, they re-participated on a voluntary basis,
provided they had fulﬁlled some mild, formal criteria concerning attendance in the course. For-
tunately, analyses show that this group of students does not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the ‘‘drop-
out’’ subjects with respect to locus of control, gender, age and average cooperative behaviour in
the ﬁve games of Experiment I, suggesting that attrition did not cause a problem of sample
selection bias in Experiment II. To be sure, however, that systematic sample DEMO do not
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) 929–946
DEMO
account for our ﬁndings, we will not only analyse the data DEMO Experiment I for the original sample
of 182 subjects, but also DEMO the subset of 92 subjects that also participated in Experiment II.
Concerning the purpose of the experiment, we only announced that it was designed to deepen
their and our understanding of behaviour in a game-theoretic setting. DEMO students were promised
feedback on the major ﬁndings of the research project after completion of the 4-week course. We
also guaranteed strict conﬁdentiality of DEMO information provided by the questionnaires.
In both experiments, ﬁve PDs were DEMO to the subjects in a ﬁxed order, mainly for the
sake DEMO simplicity and comparability of ﬁndings between the experiments. The order of pres-
entation and the main characteristics of the games are summarised in Table DEMO We acknowledge
that choosing this ﬁxed-order design has also a drawback. Speciﬁcally, increases in the average
level of cooperation across the games within Experiments I and II, respectively, cannot be
unambiguously ascribed to learning, but could also be the result of the diﬀerent game conditions.
However, in this particular study, we think that the ﬁxed-order presentation is not problematic
for two reasons. First, because the games were presented in the same ﬁxed order in both Experi-
ments, our design eases comparison of ﬁndings between Experiments I and II. This is important
because we are interested DEMO ﬁnding out whether ‘‘true’’ learning takes place over longer periods
of time. Note that any systematic diﬀerence in average cooperative behaviour between Experi-
ments DEMO and II cannot be explained away by the ﬁxed-order presentation of the games. Second,
the focus of the present study is on detecting DEMO diﬀerences in the dynamics of cooperation
over time and across diﬀerent situations. The ﬁxed-order design in no way precludes drawing
conclusions as far as DEMO research issue is concerned.
Each game consists of 12 rounds of choices, except for game III in both experiments. In fact,
game III has an unknown horizon, being ended at random after 13 rounds in Experiment I and
after nine rounds in Experiment II. In the ﬁrst DEMO games, subjects played against a ﬁctitious
party, receiving no information on the choices made by that party in each round. Therefore, these
games are essentially ‘‘one-shot’’ or non-interactive games. In the last three games, dyads were
randomly formed, and the subjects played interactive repeated games. That is, choices were made

C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) DEMO
simultaneously and independently in each round, after which subjects were informed DEMO the
choice made by the other party. Game III has a so-called inﬁnite horizon as the subjects were not
informed about the game’s end DEMO (i.e. game III was ended at random). The fourth game DEMO
similar to game III except that we now announced in advance that the game would end in round
12. In the last game, we changed the values of the payoﬀ matrix used in all the other DEMO such
that the incentive to cooperate might increase in the eyes of the players. The horizon of game V
was, again, ﬁnite and DEMO to be 12 rounds. The instructions and payoﬀ matrices of the games
can be found in the Appendix. The games in both experiments are DEMO copies. Only slight dif-
ferences in the payoﬀ structure (without aﬀecting DEMO games’ formal Nash equilibrium outcomes)
were introduced so as to trigger the students’ alertness.
Note that the ﬁrst two non-interactive games can be DEMO as baseline measures of coop-
erative behaviour. Both measures give an impression of the subjects’ basic inclination to pursue a
competitive or cooperative strategy. DEMO bulk of experimental research has revealed that compe-
titive strategies are preferred in such ‘‘one-shot’’- settings, at least in nations with an individua-
listic cultural tradition (Boone & van Witteloostuijn, 1999). The baseline strategy, however, also
depends on the players’ educational background: economics students, for instance, tend to com-
pete much more often than their colleagues studying other majors (Frank, Gilovich, & Regan,
1993). In the second game, we manipulated the reputation of the other (ﬁctitious) party by sug-
gesting that this party was trustworthy because (s)he had made cooperative choices in each of the
12 rounds in the previous DEMO (i.e. cooperative feedback). We expect baseline cooperation
to drop because, as we argued elsewhere, opportunism is deeply rooted in Western societies.
Indeed, the individualistically oriented Dutch subjects in a previous experiment were inclined to
‘‘exploit’’ the ‘‘sucker’’ with a cooperative reputation by reducing the number of DEMO
choices almost to zero (Boone & van Witteloostuijn, 1999). Subsequently, we expect cooperation
to gain importance gradually, on average, in the last three repeated games. As said before, when
players are engaged in repeated interaction with another party they quickly learn to cooperate,
and DEMO enter into tacit collusion, irrespective of whether the game’s horizon is DEMO or not
(Raiﬀa, 1982).
2.2. Experimental procedure
Experiments I and II took place in one large room. The procedure used in both DEMO
was the same. In the room there were three groups; each DEMO had three rows of pairs of tables.
The pairs of tables were separated by the space of one table. When entering the room, the stu-
dents were randomly distributed over the three groups and within the DEMO groups over the
available seats. Pairs of subjects were formed to play the repeated PD games (i.e. the last three
games in Experiments I and II). These dyads consisted of students sitting side-by-side. Note that
DEMO purpose of this 2-fold randomisation procedure was to avoid the occurrence of the same
random dyads in both experiments as much as possible. We DEMO it important to have diﬀerent
dyads in both experiments in order to ﬁnd out whether learning takes place irrespective of the
partner with whom DEMO subject is playing. It is, for instance, possible that a subject plays more
cooperatively in a second encounter when she knows her opponent DEMO a previous encounter.
We trusted that simple randomisation concerning the second pairing would make the occurrence
of the same pairs rare. Therefore, we did not randomise with the constraint that no one would
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) 929–946
DEMO
have the same partner as in Experiment I. Unfortunately, the randomisation DEMO without
constraint resulted in the extremely unlikely outcome of 10 pairs of subjects in Experiment II who
also played against each other in Experiment DEMO To check whether this constitutes a problem for
the results reported below, we redid the analyses related to Experiment II without these 20 sub-
jects. These ﬁndings, however, are very similar compared with those pertaining DEMO the 92 subjects.
Note also that the average level of cooperative behaviour in each of the ﬁve games of Experiment
II of the subjects DEMO played twice against the same partner (n=20) does not signiﬁcantly diﬀer
from the cooperative behaviour of the subjects who played against a new DEMO (n=72). To
summarise, both checks make clear that the relative ‘‘failure’’ with respect to making new random
pairs does not inﬂuence the DEMO and interpretations of the analyses reported below.
One experimenter and two assistants, identiﬁed by wearing similar shirts, guided each of the
three groups. DEMO assistants handed out the various forms with information while the experi-
menter remained in front of the group during the entire experiment. All groups DEMO the
experiment at the same clock time.
The PD was presented as an oligopoly pricing problem. The experimenter ﬁrst announced that
ﬁve games were DEMO be played, and that detailed information about each game would be DEMO
just before the game involved started. Then, he showed and explained DEMO general payoﬀ structure
of the ﬁrst game (see the Appendix). DEMO subjects could make two choices: setting a low price
(corresponding with a competitive choice) or setting a high price (corresponding with a DEMO
tive choice). The instructional phase fully and redundantly explained the interdependent nature of
the payoﬀs, so that the consequences of diﬀerent combinations of choices were clearly understood
(see also Frank et al., 1993). DEMO Schlenker, Helm and Tedeschi, (1973), we avoided the use
DEMO such terms as ‘‘compete’’, ‘‘cooperate’’, ‘‘defect’’ and ‘‘sucker’’ so as to insure a neutral
instructional set. Note that in the remainder of this DEMO we use diﬀerent terms ranging from less
to more neutral to denote ‘‘the other party’’ in the game. We stress, however, that we DEMO used
neutral terms in addressing the participants during the experiments.
The experimenter, who gave instructions as to when and how to make choices in each game,
strictly controlled the pace of the experiment. The subjects DEMO a booklet with the instruc-
tions of each game and a corresponding response sheet. The experimenter, using slides, clariﬁed
every instruction. As mentioned DEMO, games I and II involved making 12 choices in a row
DEMO a ﬁctitious party. At the onset of game III, the experimenter DEMO each subject’s
opponent/partner for the three repeated games. The subjects received a booklet with small blank
notes and were instructed in each round DEMO make a choice independently and simultaneously.
Next, subjects had to write DEMO their choice on such a blank note. After every subject had
written down her or his choice, the experimenter instructed the parties to exchange the notes
with their choice. Following this exchange, subjects marked their choice, the opponent’s choice
and their payoﬀ on a response sheet. This procedure was repeated for each round in the three
interactive games. Of course, apart from the exchange of notes no communication was
allowed.
Following standard DEMO gaming, the subjects were instructed to maximise their payoﬀ
during the DEMO (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977; Schlenker et al., 1973). Additionally, although
much experimental psychology has revealed that subjects take experiments very seriously
anyway, we introduced an extra motivational incentive by means of the announcement that
the top-ﬁve players in terms of the accumulated payoﬀ would receive DEMO token for music
936
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) DEMO
records. We also appealed to the social motivation for prestige by telling the subjects that the
ranking of payoﬀs, including the players’ names, DEMO be announced in public in a ﬁnal plenary
session at the end of the 4-week course, on a bulletin board and on the Faculty’s students’
internet homepages.
2.3. Subjects and measures
The study pertains to 182 DEMO of management and organisation of the University of Gro-
ningen for Experiment I, and a subset of 92 of these subjects for Experiment II. The information
and descriptives reported in this section pertain to the sample DEMO 182 students. The average age of
the subjects is 19.65 years (DEMO), and the majority of the participants were male (66%).
DEMO locus of control scores were measured with the well-known and widely used Rotter scale
(Rotter, 1966), translated into Dutch by the authors. DEMO original scale contains 29 forced-choice
items, 23 of those items being DEMO to measure the locus of control expectancies (and six being
ﬁller DEMO). Each item consists of a pair of statements. The respondents have to choose between
an ‘‘internal’’ and an ‘‘external’’ alternative. The following pair DEMO statements is a clear example:
‘‘Many times I feel that I have little inﬂuence over the things that happen to me’’ (external alter-
native) and ‘‘It is impossible for me to believe that chance or luck plays an important role in my
life’’ (internal alternative). A total locus of control score is obtained by counting the number of
DEMO alternatives chosen (with minimum zero and maximum 23). The number DEMO ﬁller items in
the present study was increased to 14 in order to make the purpose of the test more obscure. The
reliability of DEMO Dutch translation was demonstrated in several studies (Boone, 1992; Boone,DEMO
Gerits, & Willeme, 1990; De Brabander, Boone, Gerits, 1992). Cronbach’s alpha (Cronbach,
1951) amounts to 0.65 (n=182 with 23 items) in this sample, which concurs with the internal
consistencies DEMO by Robinson and Shaver (1973) and Rotter. The value of alpha calculated
for this sample is well above the lower limits of acceptability, generally considered to be in the
0.50–0.60 range (Nunnally, 1978). DEMO average Rotter score of the present subjects equals 11.51
(S.D.=3.37), DEMO is in line with averages reported for other samples of similar subjects (Boone
et al., 1999b).
Following other researchers (Cox et al., 1991; Uejio & Wrightsman, 1967), we measured coop-
erative behaviour by counting the total number of cooperative choices in each game. Recall DEMO
in game III 13 and nine rounds were played in Experiments I and II, respectively. In order to
standardise measures over the ﬁve games, we multiplied the total number of cooperative choices
in game III with the ratio 12/13 in Experiment I and 12/9 in Experiment DEMO
In the analyses presented later we treat gender as a covariate because females appear to have a
more external perception of control than males DEMO score equals 11.10 for males (S.D.=3.41)
and 12.31 for females (S.D.=3.15); F-value=5.37 and P=0.022]. This is consistent with several
previous ﬁndings (McGinnies, Nordholm, Ward, & Bhanthumnavin, 1974; De Brabander and
Boone, 1990). A probable cause of this diﬀerence is suggested by McGinnies et al. (p. 454) by
indicating that ‘‘[t]here are, in all probability, few countries where women have achieved equality
of opportunity with males and where they possess freedom of self-determination to the same
extent as DEMO In any case, the present females probably were reporting a perception DEMO their
status which was matched, at least for them, by social reality.’’ Descriptives of the variables under
study are presented in Table 2.

3. Results
Before analysing the eﬀects of locus of control on cooperative DEMO, a few general remarks
with respect to the descriptives reported in DEMO 2 are worth making. First, the relatively high
average number of DEMO choices made in baseline game I (5.74 and 6.53 in Experiments DEMO
and II, respectively) suggests that the present subjects have a more cooperative inclination than
the students in a previous experiment [compare with Boone DEMO al. (1999b), where this average
equalled 2.0]. A possible reason DEMO this diﬀerence may be that the subjects in the current sample
are management and organisation students, and not economics students as before. As already
mentioned above, Frank et al. (1993) showed that exposure to the self-interest model commonly
used in economics alters the extent to which people DEMO in self-interested ways. It is very likely
that management and organisation students are less exposed to this ‘‘hard core’’ economics
paradigm and more to DEMO business courses with a psychological and/or sociological ﬂavour
(e.g. organisational DEMO) than economics majors. This is immediately clear from a com-
parison DEMO the curricula of both study programs, revealing a much smaller proportion DEMO ‘‘hard’’
economics courses in the management and organisation curriculum. In this respect, we showed
elsewhere that even among economics students, the likelihood of DEMO increases with the
number of courses students have followed in which cooperation is emphasised (Boone & van
Witteloostuijn, 1999).
Note also that DEMO number of cooperative choices drops in game II in Experiment I (DEMO 5.74
to 4.50) and II (from 6.53 to 5.18), as expected. Paired t-tests show that this decrease in co-
operation is signiﬁcant (t=3.59 and P=0.000 in Experiment I, and t=2.85 and P=0.003 in
Experiment II). Apparently, opportunism is triggered when the other party has a cooperative
938
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) DEMO
reputation. Subsequently, the incidence of cooperation rises gradually in the last DEMO repeated
games of Experiment I, again as expected (Table 2). Interestingly, in Experiment II cooperation
continues to rise in game III over and above the level of cooperation that could be observed in
game DEMO in Experiment I. Thus, although there is an 8-day interval between DEMO experiments, the
trend of increasing average cooperation revealed in Experiment I DEMO simply be extrapolated to
Experiment II. This indicates that true learning takes place. Finally, we observe that, overall, this
general pattern of average cooperation in both experiments is very similar to the one found for
DEMO sample of subjects (Boone et al., 1999b), providing conﬁdence in the reliability of the
data.
Because Rotter scores tend to be normally DEMO [a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test shows that
the distribution of Rotter scores in the present sample does not signiﬁcantly deviate from a nor-
mal distribution either (z=1.05 and P=0.220)], it is likely that the implications of behavioural
diﬀerences associated with the locus of control will be most apparent at DEMO extreme scores. For
the purpose of our repeated-measures ANOVA reported below, DEMO therefore classiﬁed the sub-
jects in both experiments into three diﬀerent phenotypic groups based on the terciles of the locus-
of-control scores of the DEMO subjects (instead of applying the usual two-group classiﬁcation based
on a DEMO split): internals, those with an intermediate Rotter score (intermediates) DEMO exter-
nals. This results in 55 internals, 71 intermediates and externals DEMO Experiment I. These numbers
are 25, 38 and 29 in Experiment DEMO, respectively. Fig. 1 presents the average number of coopera-
tive choices DEMO in each of the ﬁve PD games in Experiment I by each locus-of-control group.
The results of Experiment II are shown in Fig. 2.
DEMO data were analysed with repeated-measures ANOVAs with the number of cooperative
choices in each game as the dependent variable and one within-subject factor with DEMO levels
(GAME). The between-subject factor is locus of control (LOC). Note that gender was entered in
the analyses as a covariate. DEMO Experiment I, the factor GAME has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on average
DEMO (F=2.386, d.f.=4 and P=0.050). Thus, the trend towards more DEMO from
game II onwards is signiﬁcant. This pattern does not signiﬁcantly diﬀer over the three locus-of-
control groups. That is, GAMELOC is not signiﬁcant (F=0.756, d.f.=8 and P=0.756). The
between-subject eﬀect of LOC, however, is signiﬁcant (F=3.664, d.f.=2 and P=0.028). So, there
are DEMO diﬀerences between internals, intermediates and externals concerning the extent of
cooperative DEMO in Experiment I. Although GAMELOC is not signiﬁcant, Fig. 1 suggests
DEMO the diﬀerences between the three locus-of-control groups can only be observed in games II,
III and IV. Separate ANOVAs per game indeed reveal DEMO diﬀerences in game III
(F=3.226 and P=0.042) and game IV (DEMO and P=0.028) caused by external subjects being
less cooperative than their DEMO and intermediate counterparts (post-hoc tests reveal that the
diﬀerences between internals DEMO intermediates are small and not signiﬁcant). The overall
ANOVA for game II, however, is not signiﬁcant, although a post-hoc test indicates a marginally
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between externals and intermediates (mean diﬀerence=1.41 and P=0.055).
Note that the level of cooperation of internals and intermediates rises gradually DEMO game II
onwards. This is not the case for externals. Externals only catch up with intermediates and
internals in the last game when their DEMO of cooperation increases drastically compared with
game IV. As a result, DEMO are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in game V anymore. Interestingly, in
game DEMO, the diﬀerences are not signiﬁcant, suggesting that the observations mentioned above
cannot be ascribed to diﬀerences in the baseline inclination to cooperate. In DEMO to check for the

DEMO
robustness of these results we also performed non-parametric Kruskall–Wallis tests to detect
diﬀerences between the locus-of-control groups. This test reveals a signiﬁcant between-subject
eﬀect DEMO LOC on the average level of cooperation of the ﬁve games (DEMO, d.f.=2
and P=0.032). Game-by-game analysis again shows that the diﬀerences DEMO the locus-of-
control groups only materialise in game III and IV (DEMO, d.f.=2 and P=0.030,
and Chi-square=6.668, d.f.=2 and P=0.036, respectively)DEMO These ﬁndings are exactly the same
as the parametric analyses reported above.
In Experiment II, none of the factors is signiﬁcantly related to the incidence of cooperative
behaviour, except for the factor GAME (F=10.558, d.f.=4 and P=0.000). Apparently, the
subjects average level of cooperation starts at the level where it ended in Experiment I and further
increases until DEMO reaches its equilibrium at a high average value (around 8 out DEMO 12; see Table 2).
As the subjects learned to cooperate, the eﬀect of individual diﬀerences with respect to locus of
control all DEMO, as expected (this is also conﬁrmed by Kruskall–Wallis test results). That is,
from Experiment I to Experiment II, true learning has apparently taken place among all locus-of-
control groups.

Recall that Experiment II only pertains to a subset (i.e. 92 DEMO) of the 182 subjects that
participated in Experiment I. When comparing DEMO results of both Experiments, it is therefore
important to rule out DEMO possibility that the observed convergence in cooperative behaviour
among the locus-of-control groups is due to (possibly arbitrary) sample diﬀerences. For this
purpose we DEMO the data of Experiment I only for those subjects who participated in
Experiment II as well. Fig. 3 shows the results of this exercise. DEMO pattern of ﬁndings is almost
identical to that pertaining to the full sample (compare Figs. 1 and 3), although the between-
subject eﬀect of LOC is not signiﬁcant anymore (ANOVA test: F=1.913, d.f.=2 and P=0.154;
Kruskall–Wallis test: Chi-square=3.573, d.f.=2 and P=0.168). The reduced DEMO is of
course due to the 50% drop in degrees of freedom. Taken together, as this sensitivity analysis
essentially yields the same qualitative results, the observed convergence between the locus-of-
control groups is unlikely to have been caused by subtle sample selection eﬀects.
Finally, it should be noted that one could argue that the existence of (slightly) diﬀerent condi-
DEMO in Experiment I vis-a-vis Experiment II weakens the interpretation of shifts in cooperation
as ‘‘pure’’ learning eﬀects. Similarly, a point could be made that the evidence for externals
catching up with internals and intermediates would probably DEMO stronger if the subjects had
played a number of identical procedures over time. The latter would enable one to observe
Fig. 2. Locus-of-control and DEMO of cooperative choices (Experiment II; n=92).
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) 929–946
DEMO
learning independently of diﬀerences in experimental conditions (these issues were already DEMO
ched upon when explaining our ﬁxed-order design approach in Section 2). Notwithstanding these
qualiﬁcations, we think, however, that it is very reassuring that even in the one-shot games of
Experiment II all participants, irrespective of their locus of control, ‘‘pick up’’ cooperation at
exactly the same level they ended Experiment I. As both experiments are almost identical, we
think that this ﬁnding is clear evidence of all subjects learning to DEMO cooperative over time. In
addition, presenting diﬀerent game conditions to subjects DEMO also an advantage because it
broadens the range of observed behaviour. This makes sense when testing for individual diﬀer-
ences as it allows one DEMO assess their general impact in a broad range of circumstances.
4. Appraisal
The aim of the present study was to investigate the dynamic relationship DEMO locus of
control and cooperative behaviour. For this purpose, we conducted DEMO experiments. In Experi-
ment I, where subjects do not yet have DEMO experience in playing PDs, we found that external
subjects were signiﬁcantly DEMO cooperative, on average, than internal and intermediate subjects.
However, this DEMO disappeared in the last game of Experiment I. Apparently, as expected,DEMO
Fig. 3. Locus-of-control and number of cooperative choices (Experiment I; n=92).
942
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) DEMO
externals tend to lag behind as far as learning to cooperate is concerned, only catching up with
the other groups after playing several PD games. The fact that we fail to observe signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between DEMO and intermediates came as a surprise. Perhaps, only relatively
‘‘extreme’’ externals DEMO from symptoms of so-called learned helplessness (Lefcourt, 1982),
which DEMO them less alert and sensitive to the subtle interdependencies so dominant in a PD
context. It should be stressed that these ﬁndings are probably DEMO some extent sample speciﬁc. This
is because the three locus-of-control groups were not determined by general population norms
(which do not exist), but by using the observed locus-of-control scores of the subjects participat-
ing in DEMO study. Although the mean locus-of-control score of the subjects in the present sample
lies at the midpoint of the scale (i.e. 11), a sample of university students is clearly not repre-
sentative of the ‘‘average’’ DEMO in society at large, but probably tends to lean toward the
DEMO part of thepopulation. It is thereforeconceivable that in more representative samples
(DEMO more ‘‘external’’ samples compared with the present one) the slower learning DEMO cooperate
starts closer to the average locus-of-control score of that sample, DEMO also for ‘‘intermediates’’.
We argued that the underlying reason for the observed diﬀerences between the locus-of-control
groups is related to diﬀerences in the capacity DEMO learn. To be sure, only changes in actual beha-
viour rather DEMO ‘‘true’’ learning can be observed. This is of course a major limitation of the
present but also of many other studies related to learning: learning is (and in many cases can)
only (be) inferred ex post. Similarly, the PD, although widely used to model competitive DEMO
cooperative behaviour, does not, in itself, allow one to understand DEMO the true
motives or reasons of individuals to cooperate or to compete. It is a black box in which behaviour
can be driven by DEMO plethora of, not necessarily mutually exclusive, reasons and motives. Coop-
eration can be the result of astuteness, insight and learning, but also DEMO interpersonal trust, the
propensity to take risks, altruism, collective orientation, etc. In our view, motives such as collec-
tive orientation and altruism are unlikely candidates to explain the eﬀect of locus of control on
DEMO behaviour in Experiment I. There are two major reasons to believe that, indeed,
learning to cooperate is the underlying cause.
First, and DEMO important, is the ﬁnding that no diﬀerences between the locus-of-control groups
DEMO be observed anymore in Experiment II. In fact, cooperation was the DEMO rather than the
exception in Experiment II. Apparently, having experience in DEMO the PD game is suﬃcient to
make people cooperate, so rendering DEMO diﬀerences irrelevant. It is clear that if
stable motives, such as DEMO, would have produced the results in Experiment I, then diﬀer-
ences in cooperative behaviour would not disappear overnight. As a result, the pattern of ﬁndings
is very consistent with individuals learning that cooperation is instrumental DEMO further their self-
interest (i.e. to obtain a reasonable payoﬀ).
DEMO, there is another reason why stable motives are unlikely candidates to DEMO the
observed eﬀect of locus-of-control on cooperative behaviour in Experiment I. If these motives
were the underlying reason to cooperate, we would expect to observe signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
baseline (non-interactive) game I—measuring the basic DEMO of an individual to compete or
cooperate. However, we fail to DEMO so.
Finally, a few general remarks are worth making. The present DEMO clearly underscores the
value of the claim we made earlier. It shows that cross-sectional ﬁndings are at best misleading,
and that it is DEMO essential to study personality and cooperation dynamically (Boone et al.,
DEMO). It also sheds new light on the important—but frequently neglected—diﬀerence between
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) 929–946
DEMO
strong and weak situations with respect to the impact of personality on behaviour (Weiss &
Adler, 1984). We agree with Weiss and Adler that personality research can beneﬁt a lot if
researchers would do DEMO than just paying lip service to the distinction of weak versus strong
situations. The point is that personality can only serve as a guide DEMO explaining behaviour when
the environment is uncertain and ambiguous (i.e. weak)DEMO However, when enough cues are pro-
vided as to the type DEMO behaviour that is appropriate—either normative or instrumental —, then
individual diﬀerences DEMO less important in understanding that behaviour. We conjecture that
experience and learning may make weak situations strong, and therefore reduce the impact of
personality. The present ﬁndings are consistent with this account, at least for the case of the
locus-of-control trait in a dynamic setting, as they suggest that experience indeed weakens the
impact of locus-of-control. Our study is only DEMO small step into the study of the very com-
plex area of the impact and interplay of personality and experience. Given the promising ﬁndings,DEMO
however, we believe that this issue deserves more attention in future DEMO Speciﬁcally, repli-
cations and/or extensions using other situations and personality DEMO are essential in order to test
the generality of our ﬁndings and interpretations.

Appendix
Game setting Experiment I
Two ﬁrms operate in the same market: ﬁrms I and II. Both ﬁrms can choose between two price
strategies: setting a low price and setting a high price. The proﬁts depend on the pairs of strategies
chosen. In the following payoﬀ DEMO, the four possible proﬁt combinations (in thousands of
Dutch Guilders, DEMO) are reported for Experiment I (Pi stands for the price strategy of ﬁrm i, with
i=I, II).
Firm II
Low price DEMO price
Firm I
Low price (30, 30) (600,600)
High price (600, 600) (300, 300)
944 C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) DEMO
Each cell contains the possible proﬁt combinations (WI,WII). WI DEMO WII are the (negative or
positive) proﬁts of ﬁrm I and ﬁrm II, respectively. The four proﬁt combinations are the following:
(DEMO) PI low=PII low. Both ﬁrms choose to set the same low DEMO The proﬁt margins are nega-
tive. Both ﬁrms generate a loss of Dﬂ. 30,000.
(2) PI low < PII high. Firm I DEMO a lower price than ﬁrm II. The customers of ﬁrm II prefer
to buy from the ‘cheaper’ ﬁrm I. The proﬁt of ﬁrm I DEMO therefore Dﬂ. 600,000, and the loss of
ﬁrm II amounts DEMO Dﬂ. 600,000.
(3)PI high > PII low. Firm II DEMO ﬁrm I. The resulting proﬁt combination is the
opposite of the second case. Firm I generates a loss of Dﬂ. 600,000, and ﬁrm II a proﬁt of Dﬂ.
600,000.
(4) PI high=PII high. DEMO ﬁrms choose to set the same high price. The proﬁt margins are
positive. Both ﬁrms gain a proﬁt of Dﬂ. 300,000.
Game I
DEMO you are Chief Executive Oﬃcer of ﬁrm I. You decide autonomously on the price
strategy of your company. You have an appointment with your DEMO to ﬁx the future price
strategy for your product. It is a custom in this industry that yearly contracts with distributors
are drawn, in which the price level you prefer to set in each month (or round) for the coming year
is stipulated in advance. It is impossible to change the terms of the contract afterwards. The Chief
Executive Oﬃcer DEMO ﬁrm II will simultaneously determine her/his price strategy with her/his dis-
tributor (another than yours) for the following twelve months. You DEMO not know the price
intentions of ﬁrm II (and vice versa)DEMO Indicate below for each round (month) which strategy you
prefer (DEMO indicates low price; H indicates high price).
Game II
At DEMO end of the contract, you found out that ﬁrm II has DEMO chosen to set a high price
in each month of the previous contracting period. Subsequently, you have to draw a new contract
with your distributor for the next twelve months. Indicate again which price strategy you DEMO
in each month.
Game III
Your information on the past intentions and price strategy of ﬁrm II became irrelevant. The
reason is that ﬁrm DEMO has been taken over by another company, which installed a new DEMO
Executive Oﬃcer. The government has also decided that contracts in which prices are set for
more than one month in advance are now illegal. DEMO, for the next year you are only allowed to
ﬁx your DEMO level for one month; after every month you have to decide DEMO for the next round.
Decisions are made simultaneously in each month.
You play the game for an unknown number of months (rounds). You do not know in advance
how many times you will have to DEMO a decision on your price strategy. The game can end any
moment after round 8. The probability that the game ends after round 8 DEMO 20 per cent. The
sequence of decisions/activities you have to perform is as follows:
C. Boone et al./Personality and Individual Diﬀerences 32 (2002) 929–946 DEMO
(1) at the beginning of each round, the price strategies DEMO set simultaneously and marked on
the associated response sheet;
(2) subsequently, the choices of both ﬁrms are exchanged by means of pieces of paper provided
by the experimenter; and
(3) ﬁnally, compute DEMO own proﬁt, given the strategy of the other ﬁrm.
Indicate for DEMO month on your response sheet: (i) the strategy you prefer, (ii) the strategy of
the other ﬁrm and (iii) the DEMO you gained. Except for the exchange of the pieces of paper after
each round, no communication is allowed during the experiment.
Game IV
Repeat game III for a known number of months (rounds). More precisely, you play the game
for twelve rounds (months).
Game V
DEMO the following period of twelve months demand has increased substantially, associated DEMO
an increasing proﬁt potential. This new situation is reﬂected in the following proﬁt combinations
(proﬁts are in thousands of Dutch Guilders, Dﬂ.).
DEMO II
Low price High price
Firm I
Low price (20, 20) (800,400)
High price (400, 800) (600, 600)
Proceed as in game IV.
Game setting Experiment II
The game DEMO in Experiment II is exactly the same except for slight diﬀerences in the payoﬀ
structure. For the ﬁrst four games the following proﬁt (loss) combinations were used: (20, 20),
(500, 500), (500, 500), (200, 200). In game V these DEMO are: (10, 10), (700, 700),
(700, 700), (400, 400).
