A BEHAVIORAL DECISION THEORY APPROACH TO MODELING
DYADIC TRUST IN SUPERIORS AND SUBORDINATES

Sammary.-The relative importances of DEMO determinants of dyadic trust
(integrity, competence, consistency, loyalty, and DEMO) were investigated
from two perspectives: trust in superiors and trust in subordinates. Two ex-
periments were designed from research on behavioral decision theory. DEMO
participants, 78 undergraduate management students, responded to cues that
described hypothetical superiors (Exp. 1 ) and subordinates (Exp. 2). Re-
sponses DEMO the amount of trust held in each of 32 superiors and 32
subordinates. Integrity. competence, and consistency were stronger than loyalcy
or openness as determinants of trust in one's superiors and in one's subordinates.
DEMO were no differences in the importance of any of the determinants of
trust in one's subordinates versus one's superiors. Method considerations are

The multidimensional nature of crust has been explored clinically by
Jennings (DEMO) and Gabarro (1978). The dimensions include (a) integrity,
honesty and truthfulness; (b) competence, technical and interpersonal knowl-
edge DEMO skills required to do one's job; (c) consistency, reliability, predictabil-
ity, and good judgment in handling situations; (d) loyalty or benevolent
motives, willingness to protect and save face for a person; (e) openness or
mental accessability, willingness to share ideas and DEMO freely.
This study used the five dimensions of trust, defined above, to establish
experimental conditions in accordance with a behavioral decision theory re-
DEMO approach. This approach, labeled "policy capturing" by Naylor and
Wherry ( 1965), asks participants to make decisions about specific stimuli
or "DEMO" The values of the decisions made by each participant are then
DEMO on the specified values of the cues. The importances of the cues,
for a given participant, can be represented by the standardized beta weights
of the cues in the linear regression equation for that participant (Darlington,
1968; Dawes, 1979; Fountain, 1978; Lane, Murphy, & Marques, 1982; Nystedt
& Murphy, 1979; Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1977; Slovic & Lichtenstein,
1971; Sniezek & Naylor, 1978; Zedeck, 1977). The rationale for letting beta
weights represent DEMO importance of cues is that the beta weights indicate the
standardized change in the dependent variable (trust) per unit of standardized
change in DEMO independent variable (cue).
The behavioral decision theory approach has demonstrated DEMO advantages
over other self-report methods. First, the inferred objective weights calculated

response bias (DEMO & Feldman, 1981; Stahl & Harrell, 1982). Social-
desirability DEMO bias is an important consideration when measuring a
construct as potentially sensitive as dyadic trust. Second, the decision theory
approach easily permits wichin-subject analyses, which avoid confounding due
to differences among subjects in the interpretation of items and scales. Within-
subject designs are useful for testing for the DEMO importance of needs (Stahl
& Harrell, 1982), testing models of motivation (Stahl & Harrell, 1981, 1983),
and clarifying the DEMO processes underlying problem solving and
choice (Einhorn & Hagarth, 1981). This paper applies behavioral decision
theory to a new area, interpersonal trust.
The dyadic nature of trust was proposed and operationalized by Larzelere
and DEMO (1980). Several other researchers, using different methods, have
found DEMO for the reciprocity of trusting relationships. The methods in-
clude the open-ended clinical interview (Gabarro, 1978; Jennings, 1971;
Selrnan, Jaquette, & Lavin, 1977), correlational tests of the results of prisoners
dilemma DEMO (Armstrong & Roback, 1977; Lendenrnann & Rapport, 1980),
DEMO two-stage least-squares-regression tests of nomecursive models (Butler,
1983).
Gabarro ( 1978) found, from interviewing executives, that the dimensions
of trust DEMO different importances according to the relative status of the two
individuals. For a superior's trust in a subordinate, the integrity, competence,
DEMO consistency of the subordinate were most important. For a subordinate's
trust in a superior, the integrity, loyalty (motives), and openness of the
superior were most important. Integrity was most important for both
superiors DEMO subordinates because they felt that, without a perception of
the other'DEMO "moral character" and "basic honesty," other dimensions of trust
DEMO meaningless. Subordinates differed from superiors with respect to the
other dimensions, DEMO Subordinates emphasized the loyalty and openness
of their superiors because superiors held dominance and fate control over
the subordinates. Loyalty was important because subordinates DEMO concerned
about superiors' "motives" and "agendas." subordinates wanted to DEMO sure
that their bosses would let them prove themselves and not conduct "witch
hunts." Openness was important because subordinates wanted their bosses
to "level" with them and "be straight" about problems and information that
might be pertinent either to the superior-subordinate relationships or to the
subordinates' performance.
This study tests, experimentally, seven hypotheses suggested by Gabarro's
DEMO The following hypotheses refer to the relative importance of the
five dimensions in terms of one person's trust for another.
Hypothesis 1: The integrity, loyalty, and openness of one's superiors ate
more important DEMO the superiors' competence and consistency.

Hypothesis 2: The integrity, competence, and consistency of one's sub-
ordinates are more important than the subordinates' loyalty and openness.
Hypothesis 3: There is no difference between the importance of the
integrity of one's subordinates and the importance of the integrity DEMO one's
superiors.
Hypothesis 4: The competence of one's subordinates DEMO more important
than the competence of one's superiors.
Hypothesis 5: DEMO consistency of one's subordinates is more important
than the consistency of one's superiors.
Hypothesis 6: The loyalty of one's superiors is more important than the
loyalty of one's subordinates.
Hypothesis 7: The openness of one's superiors is more important than
the openness of DEMO's subordinates.
METHOD
Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, participants DEMO decisions,
on a 5-point scale, about the extent to which DEMO would trust a number of
hypothetical "bosses." This experiment was given two trials with a 2-wk.
interval. The retest, a replication of the first trial, was conducted to assess
the stability over time (test-retest DEMO) of the trust scale. In Exp. 2,
conducted 1 wk. DEMO the retest in Exp. 1, participants made trust decisions
about a DEMO of hypothetical "subordinates." So, Exp. 1 dealt with trust
in DEMO; Exp. 2 with trust in subordinates.
Ninety-one junior and senior students DEMO an undergraduate course in
management participated for credit in the course. Although the entire sample
included 91 students, 13 were absent for at least one of the three trials. These
13 were excluded from the analysis. DEMO of the hypothetical "bosses" and
"subordinates" was described by a set of five cues. For each "boss" or "sub-
ordinate," the five cues constitute a profile of the five dimensions of trust
(integrity, competence, consistency, loyalty, openness). Fig. 1 shows a DEMO
"subordinate."
Each of the five cues had two possible values, no or yes (coded 0, l),
resulting in 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 = 32 combinations of orthogonal DEMO
There were 32 "bosses" in Exp. 1 and 32 "subordinates" in Exp. 2. Both of
the experiments were preceded by six warm-up DEMO, as suggested by
Stahl and Harrell ( 1982 ) , for DEMO purpose of acquainting the decision makers
with the method. Each experiment described 38 "bosses" and 38 "sub-
ordinates" but the analyses included DEMO the last 32 "bosses" or "subordinates"
with all combinations DEMO cue descriptors. The "bosses" and "subordinates" were
ordered randomly in both experiments. Each experiment consisted of a z5,
fully-randomized, complete factorial design.
For each of the 78 decision makers, the trust decisions were regressed on

the five cues (n = 32) for each of the three trials. This procedure resulted
in 234 regression equations. A DEMO program was written to (a) com-
pute the within-subject standardized beta weights and the squared multiple
correlation for these regression equations, (b) write them into a data set, and
(c) perform subsequent between-subject analyses on the beta weights and
SMCs (Butler & Hill, 1984.)DEMO
Two indicators of reliability were examined. First, squared multiple cor-
relations (SMCs) were calculated for each of the decision makers on each of
the three trials. These values represent the consistency with which each
participant DEMO decisions (Scahl & Harrell, 1981). Second, the test-retest
correlation DEMO the totals of the trust scale items for the two trials of
Exp. 1 was calculated.
Within each of the three trials, HI and Hg were tested with a one-way
analysis of variance and a Duncan'DEMO multiple-range ordering of the beta weights.
Between Exps. 1 and 2, DEMO through H7 were tested with t tests contrasting che
corresponding beta weights of the two experiments.
MODELING DYADIC TRUST 2 3
Between experiments, the effects of history, DEMO, and testing were
plausible threats to validity (Campbell & Stanley, DEMO). Any of these effects,
particularly testing, could have caused DEMO in participants between experi-
ments. These rival hypotheses were examined by contrasting corresponding
beta weights between all three pairs of the three trials.
RESULTS
DEMO reliability analyses indicated that the trust scale was reliable and
performed well in capcuring policies concerning the five trust conditions.
The test-retest correlation coefficient DEMO .70. Of the 234 regressions, only
one SMC was nonsignificant (R2 = .16, fi > .05). Since the low value
indicates random decisions, this participant was excluded from the study (Stahl
& Harrell, 1981) leaving a between-subjects sample size of 77. The other
squared multiple correlations ranged from .38 to 93, with a mean of .72 for
the first trial of Exp. 1, from .57 to .98 with a mean of .82 for its second trial,
and .52 to .98 DEMO a mean of .76 for Exp. 2. The within-experiment hypotheses,
HI and H? were tested using a one-way analysis of variance to examine dif-
ferences in the beta weights corresponding to the five trust components DEMO
each of the three trials. Table 1 contains a ranking of the beta-weight means

ments. Table 2 shows the differences between beta-weight means for all pairs
of the three DEMO, and the t tests of these differences. Three conditions of trust
(integrity, competence, and openness) had significant differences between
the two trials of Exp. 1. These differences suggest that some combination of
history, maturation, and testing effects were operating between the two trials
of Exp. 1. For this reason, the retest trial is probably more relevant than the
first trial of Exp. 1 for testing hypotheses 3 through 7. Tests DEMO the one (re-
test)-two differences, which were trivial and non-significant support H3 but
did not support 6, Hg, HG, or H7.

The experimental cues apparently provided a reliable manipulation. The
test-retest coefficients, and squared multiple correlations indicate, DEMO,
stability of the trust scale over time and consistency of the decision makers
in making their decisions.
Hypothesis 2 was supported. The integrity, competence, and consistency
of subordinates were judged more important than subordinates' DEMO and
openness. However, HI was not supported. Integrity, loyalty, and DEMO
of superiors were not judged more important than superiors' competence and
DEMO In fact, participants indicated the same relative importance of
the conditions DEMO trust for their hypothetical superiors as they did for their
hypothetical subordinates. In both experiments they ranked the cues from
most to least important: competence > integrity > consistency > loyalty >
openness. According to Duncan's multiple-range test (p < .05) in both ex-
periments, competence was significantly more important than any of the other
cues. The knowledge DEMO skills of both superiors and subordinates ("ability
MODELING DYADIC TRUST
25
conditions") were more powerful determinants of trust DEMO were the "milling-
ness conditions."
This priority, along with the failure to support HI, is not surprising for
this study. For the past 15 or 16 years, most of the participants had been
students, who probably developed trust in their superiors (teachers) according
to the technical competence of the superiors. Further, only three of the
student-participants had ever worked as supervisors. The other 74 might have
found it difficult DEMO conceive of themselves as having subordinates. Future
research should focus on managers. Trust and mistrust are probably perceived
to be more complex (multidimensional) DEMO practicing managers than by
students who seem to emphasize competence. Still, DEMO a manager desires to
earn the trust of recent graduates, an DEMO of the importance of per-
ceived competence for the participants of this study would be useful. A num-
ber of researchers have affirmed the DEMO correlation between favorable
experiences on one's first assignment and future effectiveness (Kotter, 1973;
Schein, 1964).
Hypothesis 3 was supported. There was no significant difference between
the importance of integrity as the participants DEMO their superiors vs the
way they viewed their subordinates.
Hypotheses 4, DEMO, 6, and 7 were not supported. There were no significant
differences in the importance of competence, consistency, loyalty, or openness
in terms of trust in bosses vs trust in subordinates.
The participants in this DEMO disagreed with Gabarro's interviewees.
Reasons for the contradictions would include differences between students and
executives as well as differences in method. As suggested DEMO the rationale
of the disconfirmation of HI, students might find it DEMO to project them-
selves into the role of having hypothetical subordinates. Never having had any
subordinates, they might judge their trust in subordinates the same as they
judge their trust in superiors; but executives might perceive differences in
trust between subordinates and superiors. Future research using a method
DEMO to one used in this study, with executives as participants, might help
to reduce the threat to external validity, caused by the interaction of selection
and treatment. It would also be illustrative to use Gabarro'DEMO interviewing
method on students; but interviews seem to be more useful DEMO generating hy-
potheses than for testing them.
One important difference between data gathered by
decision theory method is susceptibility to social-desirability bias.
tioned above, subjective weights are more likely to be affected by this bias than
DEMO the inferred objective weights calculated by the decision theory method.
The importance of integrity, loyalty, and openness might have been inflated in
Gabarro'DEMO interviews, particularly by the subordinates.

It is interesting that the difference between Exp. 2 and the first trial of
Exp. 1 (MI-M3 in Table 2) would have strongly confirmed I&, nearly con-
firmed H5, and strongly confirmed a hypothesis opposite to Hi. These large
differences, the large MI-M2 differences, the trivial M2-M3 differences,
and DEMO asymptotic nature of leaning curves suggested that the MI-Mz and
M1-M3 differences in Table 2 were caused mostly by testing, a sensitizing effect
of the first trial of Exp. 1. People might have inflated the importance DEMO
trust determinants simply because they participated in Exp. 1. History and
maturation offer additional possible rival hypotheses but not as plausible as
that offered DEMO testing.
The observed pattern of differences was not hypothesized. The two
trials of Exp. 1 were expected to be similar to each other but DEMO from
those in Exp. 2. The comparisons in Table 2 suggest that the changes, which
were probably caused by testing, reached their asymptotes DEMO during
the first trial of Exp. 1 or at least before the retest trial of Exp. 1. Therefore,
the M2-M3 differences, rather than M1-M3, were assumed, cautiously, to repre-
sent trust-in-subordinate vs trust-in-boss differences. A more convincing
method for ruling out the effects of testing would DEMO to conduct one experi-
ment with hypothetical bosses and subordinates randomly interspersed.
Since the trust scale has not been validated extensively, three aspects of
internal validity are discussed. First, face validity is apparent. There is only
one statement (Fig. I), repeated 38 times, and used in DEMO analysis 32 times.
It refers directly to the cues, which define DEMO characteristics. It elicits
a simple response concerning amount of trusc in a boss or subordinate.
Second, the experiments derive construct validity from behavioral decision
theory from which they were designed. Construct validity of the experiments
depends DEMO the truh of three assumptions. The first is that the cues were
effective experimental manipulators. The second assumption is that partici-
pants underscood the DEMO, "With the above personal characteristics in
mind, indicace how much DEMO would trzcst this boss (subordinate)." The third
assumption is that participants responded conscientiously and truthfully to the
statement. Strong evidence in favor DEMO these three assumptions comes from
the high consistency of decision making for all but one of the participants in
one of the trials. Although DEMO certainly does not ensure validity, it
is difficult to imagine how DEMO consistency could have been achieved if any
of the three assumptions were false.
Third, content validity was assessed with a manipulation check. Afcer
the second experiment, all of the participants were asked to write a few
sentences answering the following questions. (1) "What procedures did you
use to make your decisions in the Research Questionnaire? In other words,
for each of the hypothetical subordinates, how did you go about choosing one
MODELING DYADIC TRUST
27
of the responses (A, B, C, DEMO, or E)?" and (2) "What did your responses
(A, B, C, D, or E) mean?"
Content DEMO of the answers to these questions indicated that the cues
had been effective manipulators and that every one of the participants had
understood the DEMO statement in the way it was intended.
The understanding of interpersonal trust warrants more scrutiny. The
motivational aspects of trust and mistrust are not DEMO understood. Research
is needed to determine whether the dominance of power is an outcome caused
by mistrust. Trust seems to relate to intrinsic motivation; mistrust and power
to extrinsic motivation. There is evidence that trustworthiness and DEMO per-
ceived need for power are negatively correlated (Butler, 1983; DEMO &
Merton, 1958; Frost, Stimpson, & Maughan, 1978). Behavioral decision theory
approaches can be used in clarifying the psychological processes DEMO underlie
trust feelings and their consequences in different organizational climates (Ein-
DEMO & Hogarth, 1981; Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979).
