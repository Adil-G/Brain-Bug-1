RISK AVERSION AND EXPECTED-UTILITY THEORY:
A CALIBRATION THEOREM
BY MATTHEW RABIN1
1. INTRODUCTION
USING EXPECTED-UTILITY THEORY, economists model risk aversion as arising solely
because the utility function over wealth is concave. This diminishing-marginal-utility-of-
wealth DEMO of risk aversion is psychologically intuitive, and surely helps explain some
DEMO our aversion to large-scale risk: We dislike vast uncertainty in lifetime DEMO because
a dollar that helps us avoid poverty is more valuable than a dollar that helps us become
very rich.
Yet this theory also DEMO that people are approximately risk neutral when stakes are
small. Arrow (DEMO, p. 100) shows that an expected-utility maximizer with a differentiable
utility function will always want to take a sufficiently small stake in any DEMO
expected-value bet. That is, expected-utility maximizers are (almost everywhere) arbitrar-
DEMO close to risk neutral when stakes are arbitrarily small. While most economists
understand this formal limit result, fewer appreciate that the approximate risk-neutrality
prediction holds not just for negligible stakes, but for quite sizable and economically
important stakes. Economists often invoke expected-utility theory to explain substantial
(observed or posited) risk aversion over stakes where the theory actually predicts virtual
risk neutrality.
While not broadly appreciated, the inability of expected-utility theory to provide a
plausible account of risk aversion over modest stakes has become oral DEMO among
some subsets of researchers, and has been illustrated in writing DEMO a variety of different
contexts using standard utility functions.2 In this paper, I reinforce this previous research
by presenting a theorem that calibrates a relationship between risk attitudes over small
and large stakes. The theorem shows DEMO, within the expected-utility model, anything but
virtual risk neutrality over modest stakes implies manifestly unrealistic risk aversion over

to the themes raised in this paper. He illustrates DEMO a person who for all initial wealth levels is

large stakes. The theorem is entirely "nonparametric," assuming nothing about the utility
function except concavity.
In the next section I DEMO implications of the theorem with examples of the form
"If an DEMO maximizer always turns down modest-stakes gamble X, she will
always turn DEMO large-stakes gamble Y." Suppose that, from any initial wealth level, DEMO
person turns down gambles where she loses $100 or gains $110, DEMO with 50%
probability. Then she will turn down 50-50 bets of losing $1,000 or gaining any sum of
money. A person who would DEMO turn down 50-50 lose $1,000/gain $1,050 bets would
always turn down 50-50 bets of losing $20,000 or gaining any sum. DEMO are implausible
degrees of risk aversion. The theorem not only yields implications if we know somebody
will turn down a bet for all initial DEMO levels. Suppose we knew a risk-averse person
turns down 50-50 lose $100/gain $105 bets for any lifetime wealth level less than
$350,000, but knew nothing about the degree of her risk aversion for wealth DEMO above
$350,000. Then we know that from an initial wealth level of $340,000 the person will turn
down a 50-50 bet of DEMO $4,000 and gaining $635,670.
The intuition for such examples, DEMO for the theorem itself, is that within the
expected-utility framework, turning down a modest-stakes gamble means that the marginal
utility of money must DEMO very quickly for small changes in wealth. For instance, if
you DEMO a 50-50 lose $10/gain $11 gamble because of diminishing marginal utility, it
must be that you value the eleventh dollar above your current wealth by at most (10/11)
as much as you valued the tenth-to-last-dollar your current wealth.3 Iterating this
observation,
wealthier, you value the thirty-second dollar above your current wealth by at most
(10/11) x (10/11); (5/6) as much as your DEMO dollar. You will value your
two-hundred-twentieth dollar by at most (3/DEMO) as much as your last dollar, and your
eight-hundred-eightieth dollar by at most (1/2,000) of your last dollar. This is DEMO absurd
rate for the value of money to deteriorate-and the theorem shows the rate of
deterioration implied by expected-utility theory is actually quicker than DEMO Indeed, the
theorem is really just an algebraic articulation of how DEMO it is that the consump-
tion value of a dollar changes significantly as a function of whether your lifetime wealth is
$10, $100, DEMO even $1,000 higher or lower. From such observations we should conclude
that aversion to modest-stakes risk has nothing to do with the diminishing DEMO utility
of wealth.
Expected-utility theory seems to be a useful and adequate model of risk aversion for
many purposes, and it is especially attractive in lieu of an equally tractable
model. "Extremely-concave expected utility" may DEMO be useful as a parsimonious
for modeling aversion to modest-scale risk. But this and previous papers make clear
expected-utility theory is manifestly not close DEMO the right explanation of risk attitudes
over modest stakes. Moreover, when DEMO specific structure of expected-utility theory

function-it can be very misleading. In the concluding section, I discuss a few examples
of such research where the expected-utility hypothesis DEMO detrimentally maintained, and
speculate very briefly on what set of ingredients DEMO be needed to provide a better
account of risk attitudes. In the next section, I discuss the theorem and illustrate its
implications.
2. SOME CALIBRATIONS BASED ON A THEOREM
Consider an expected-utility maximizer over wealth, w, with Von Neumann-Morgen-
stern preferences U(w). Assume that the person likes money and is risk-averse: For all
w,U(w) is (strictly) increasing and (weakly) concave. Suppose further that, for some DEMO
of initial wealth levels and for some g > 1 > 0, she will reject bets losing $1 or gaining $g,
each with 50% chance.4 From the assumption that these bets will be rejected, the
theorem presented in this paper places an upper bound on the rate DEMO which utility
increases above a given wealth level, and a lower DEMO on the rate at which utility
decreases below that wealth level. Its proof is a short series of algebraic manipulations;
both the theorem DEMO proof are in the Appendix. Its basic intuition is straightforward, as
DEMO briefly in the introduction.
The theorem handles cases where we know a person to be averse to a gamble only for
some ranges of DEMO wealth. A simpler corollary, also in the Appendix, holds when we
know a lower bound on risk aversion for all wealth levels. Table DEMO illustrates some of the
corollary's \implications: Consider an individual who DEMO known to reject, for all initial
wealth levels, 50-50, lose DEMO/gain g bets, for g = $101, $105, $110, and $125. The table
presents implications of the form "the person will turn down 50-50 gambles of losing L
and gaining G," where each DEMO is a row in the table and the highest G (using DEMO bounds
established by the corollary) making the statement true is the DEMO in the table.5 All
entries are rounded down to an even dollar amount.
So, for instance, if a person always turns down a DEMO lose $100/gain $110 gamble,
she will always turn down a 50-50 lose $800/gain $2,090 gamble. Entries of co are literal:DEMO
Somebody who always turns down 50-50 lose $100/gain $125 gambles will turn down any
gamble with a 50% chance of losing $600. This DEMO because the fact that the bound on risk
aversion holds everywhere implies that U(w) is bounded above.
4 The assumption that U is concave is not implied by the fact that an agent always turns DEMO a
given better-than-fair bet; if you know that a person always DEMO down 50-50 lose $10/gain $11 bets,
you don't know that her utility function is concave everywhere-it could be convex over small
DEMO (For instance, let U(w) = 1 - (W)W for w q (19, 20), but
Uw =1(- + DEMO 19)
() [ - (2
for w e (19,DEMO).) Concavity is an additional assumption, but I am confident that results hold
approximately if we allow such small and silly nonconvexities.
5 DEMO theorem provides a lower bound on the concavity of the utility function, and its proof
indicates an obvious way to obtain a stronger (DEMO uglier) result. Also, while the theorem and
applications focus on "DEMO bets," the point is applicable to more general bets. For instance, if an
expected-utility maximizer dislikes a bet with a 25% chance of losing $100 and a 75% chance of
winning $100, then she would turn down 50-50 lose $100/gain $300 bets, and we could apply the
theorem from there.

The theorem and corollary are homogeneous of degree 1: DEMO we know that turning
down 50-50 lose i/gain g gambles implies you will turn down 50-50 lose L/gain G, then
for all x > 0, turning down 50-50 lose xl/gain xg gambles implies you will turn down
50-50 lose xL/gain xG. Hence the L DEMO $10,000, g = $101 entry in Table I tells us DEMO
turning down 50-50 lose $10/gain $10.10 gambles implies you will turn down 50-50 lose
$1,000/gain co gambles.
The reader may worry DEMO the extreme risk aversion shown in Table I relies heavily on
the assumption that the person will turn down the given gamble for all DEMO wealth
levels. It doesn't. While without knowing a global lower bound on a person's modest-stakes
risk aversion we cannot assert that she'DEMO turn down gambles with infinite expected return,
Table II indicates that the lack of a lower bound does not salvage the plausibility of
DEMO theory. Table II shows calibrations if we know the person will turn down
50-50 lose $100/gain g gambles for initial wealth levels less DEMO $300,000, indicating
which gambles she'll turn down starting from DEMO wealth level of $290,000. Large
entries are approximate.

If we only know that a person turns down 50-50 lose $100/gain $125 bets when her
lifetime wealth is below $300,DEMO, we also know she will turn down a 50-50 lose
$600/DEMO $36 billion bet beginning from lifetime $290,000.6 The intuition is that the
extreme concavity of the utility function between $290,000 and $300,DEMO assures that the
marginal utility at $300,000 is tiny compared to the marginal utility at wealth levels below
$290,000; hence, even DEMO the marginal utility does not diminish at all above $300,000, DEMO
person will not care nearly as much about money above $300,000 as she does about
amounts below $290,000. The choice of $290,DEMO and $300,000 as the two focal wealth
levels is arbitrary; DEMO that matters is that they are $10,000 apart. As with Table I, Table II
is homogeneous of degree 1, where the wedge DEMO the two wealth levels must be
multiplied by the same factor as the other entries. Hence-multiplying Table II by 10-if
an expected-utility maximizer would DEMO down a 50-50 lose $1,000/gain $1,050 gamble
whenever her lifetime wealth is below $300,000, then from an initial wealth level of
$200,000 she will turn down a 50-50 lose $40,000/DEMO $6,356,700 gamble.
While these "nonparametric" calibrations are less conducive to analyzing more com-
plex questions, Table III provides similar calibrations for decisions that resemble real-
world investment choices by assuming conventional functional forms DEMO utility functions.
It shows what aversion to various gambles implies for the maximum amount of money a
person with a constant-absolute-risk-aversion (CARA) utility DEMO would be willing to
6 Careful examination of Tables I and II shows that most entries that are not oo in Table I show
DEMO exactly the same in Table II. The two exceptions are those entries that are above $10,000-since
Table II implicitly makes no assumptions about DEMO for gains of more than $10,000, it yields

keep invested in the stock market, for reasonable assumptions about the distribution of
returns for stocks and bonds. Hence, an expected-utility maximizer with CARA prefer-
ences who turns down 50/50 lose $1,DEMO/gain $1,200 gambles will only be willing to keep
$8,875 of her portfolio in the stock market, no matter how large her total investments in
stocks and bonds. If she turns down a 50/DEMO lose $100/gain $110 bet, she will be willing
to keep DEMO $1,600 of her portfolio in the stock market-keeping the rest in bonds
(which average 6% lower annual return). While it is widely believed that investors are too
cautious in their investment behavior, no one believes they are this risk averse.
3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Expected-utility theory DEMO well be a useful model of the taste for very-large-scale
insurance.7 Despite its usefulness, however, there are reasons why it is important for
DEMO to recognize how miscalibrated expected-utility theory is as an explanation of
modest-scale risk aversion. For instance, some research methods economists currently
employ should be abandoned because they rely crucially on the expected-utility interpre-
tation of modest-scale DEMO aversion. One example arises in experimental economics.
recent years, there has DEMO extensive laboratory research in economics in which
interact to generate outcomes with payoffs on the order of $10 to $20. Researchers are
often interested DEMO inferring subjects' beliefs from their behavior. Doing so often requires
knowing DEMO relative value subjects hold for different money prizes; if a person
DEMO in event A over $10 in event B, we know that DEMO believes A is at least twice
as B only if we can assume the person likes $10 at least twice as much as $5. DEMO
economic theory tells us that, because of diminishing marginal utility of DEMO, we
should not assume people like $10 exactly twice as much DEMO $5. Experimentalists (e.g.,
Davis and Holt (1993, pp. 472-476)) have developed a clever scheme to avoid this
problem: Instead of DEMO of $10 and $5, subjects are given prizes such as 10% DEMO of
winning $100 vs. 5% chance of winning $100. Expected-utility theory tells us that,
irrespective of the utility function, a subject values the 10% chance of a prize exactly
twice as much as the 5% DEMO of winning the same prize.
The problem with this lottery procedure is that it is known to be sufficient only when
we maintain the DEMO hypothesis. But then it is not necessary-since
expected-utility theory tells us that people will be virtually risk neutral in decisions on the
scale of DEMO stakes. If expected-utility theory is right, these procedures are at best
DEMO, and are probably harmful.8 On the other hand, if we think that subjects in
experiments are risk averse, then we know they are not expected-utility maximizers.
Hence the lottery procedure, which is motivated solely by expected-utility theory's
assumptions that preferences are linear in probabilities and that DEMO attitudes come only
7While there is also much evidence for some limits of its applicability for large-scale risks, and
the results of this paper suggest an important flaw with the expected-utility model, the specific
results do not of course demonstrate that the model is unuseful in all domains.
DEMO If expected-utility theory explained behavior, these procedures would surely not be DEMO the
extra expense, nor the loss in reliability of the data DEMO making experiments more complicated. Nor
should experimentalists who believe in expected-utility theory ever be cautious about inferences
made from existing experiments that don't DEMO the lottery methods out of fear that the results are
confounded by the subjects' risk attitudes.

from the curvature of the utility-of-wealth function, has little presumptive value in
"neutralizing" risk aversion. Perhaps there are theories of DEMO attitudes such that the
lottery procedure is useful for neutralizing risk aversion-but expected-utility theory isn't
one of them.9
A second example of problematic DEMO methods relates to the logic underlying the
theorem: Expected-utility theory makes DEMO predictions about the relationship be-
tween risk aversion over modest stakes and risk aversion over large stakes. Hence, when
measuring risk attitudes maintaining the expected-utility hypothesis, differences in esti-
mates of risk attitudes may come from differences in the scale of risk comprising data
sets, rather than from differences in risk attitudes of the people being studied.10 Data
sets dominated DEMO modest-risk investment opportunities are likely to yield much higher
estimates of risk aversion than data sets dominated by larger-scale investment opportuni-
ties. So not DEMO are standard measures of risk aversion somewhat hard to interpret given
that people are not expected-utility maximizers, but even attempts to compare risk
attitudes so as to compare across groups will be misleading unless economists pay DEMO
attention to the theory's calibrational problems.
The problems with assuming that risk attitudes over modest and large stakes derive
from the same utility-of-wealth DEMO relate to a long-standing debate in economics.
Expected-utility theory makes a powerful prediction that economic actors don't see an
amalgamation independent gambles as DEMO insurance against the risk of those
gambles; they are either barely DEMO willing or barely more willing to accept risks when
clumped together than when apart. This observation was introduced in a famous article
by Samue,DEMO (1963), who showed that expected-utility theory implies that if (for some
sufficiently wide range of initial wealth levels) a person turns down a particular gamble,
then she should also turn down an offer DEMO play n > 1 of those gambles. Hence, in his
example, if Samuelson's colleague is unwilling to accept a 50-50 lose $100/DEMO $200
gamble, then he should be unwilling to accept 100 of DEMO gambles taken together.
Though Samuelson's theorem is "weaker" than the one in this paper, it makes manifest
the fact that expected-utility theory predicts that adding together a lot of independent
risks should not appreciably DEMO attitudes towards those risks.
9Indeed, the observation that diminishing marginal utility DEMO wealth is irrelevant in laboratory
experiments raises questions about interpreting experimental tests of the adequacy of expected-
utility theory. For instance, while showing that existing alternative models better fit experimental
data than does expected-utility theory, Harless and Camerer (1994) show that expected-utility theory
better fits experimental data DEMO does "expected-value theory"-risk-neutral expected-utility the-
ory. But because expected-utility theory DEMO that laboratory subjects should be risk neutral, such
evidence that expected-utility DEMO explains behavior better than expected-value theory is evidence
against expected-utility theory.
10 Indeed, Kandel and Stambaugh (1991, pp. 68-69) discuss how the DEMO of estimates for
the coefficient of relative risk aversion may be very sensitive to the scale of risk being examined.
Assuming constant risk aversion, they illustrate how a coefficient of relative risk aversion needed to
avoid DEMO absurdly large aversion to a 50/50 lose $25,000/gain $25,000 gamble generates
absurdly little aversion to a 50/50 lose $400/DEMO $400 gamble. They summarize such examples as
saying that "Inferences about DEMO coefficient of relative risk aversion] are perhaps most elusive
when pursued in the introspective context of thought experiments." But precisely the same problem
makes inferences from real data elusive.

Yet virtually everybody would find the aggregated gamble of DEMO 50-50 lose $100/gain
$200 bets attractive. It has an expected yield of $5,000, with negligible risk: There is only
a (1/700) chance of losing any money and merely a (1/25,DEMO) chance of losing more
than $1,000.11 While nobody would turn DEMO this gamble, many people, such as
Samuelson's colleague, might DEMO the single 50-50 lose $100/gain $200 bet.12 Hence,
using expected-utility theory to make inferences about the risk attitudes towards the
amalgamated bet DEMO the reaction to the one bet-or vice versa-would be misleading.
What does explain risk aversion over modest stakes? While this paper provides a
"DEMO by calibration" that expected-utility theory does not help explain some risk
DEMO, there are of course more direct tests showing that alternative models
DEMO risk attitudes. There is a large literature (see Machina (1987) DEMO
for reviews) of formal models of such alternatives. Many of these DEMO
a more plausible account of modest-scale risk attitudes, allowing
aversion over DEMO stakes and nonridiculous risk aversion over large stakes, and
researchers (e.g., Segal and Spivak (1990), Loomes and Segal (1994),
(1990)) have explicitly addressed how non-expected-utility theory
small-stake risk aversion.
Indeed, what is empirically the most firmly established feature of risk preferences, loss
aversion,
modest-scale risk aversion. Loss aversion says that people are significantly DEMO averse to
losses relative to the status quo than they are attracted by gains, and more generally that
people's utilities are determined by changes in wealth rather than absolute levels.13
Preferences incorporating loss aversion can DEMO significant small-scale risk aversion
with reasonable degrees of large-scale risk aversion.14

12As Samuelson noted, the strong statement that somebody should turn down the many bets if
and only if she turns down DEMO one is not strictly true if a person's risk attitudes change at different
wealth levels. Indeed, many researchers (e.g., Hellwig (1995) and Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987)) have
explored features of the utility function such that an expected-utility maximizer might take a
multiple of a DEMO bet that they would turn down in isolation. But characterizing such instances
isn't relevant to examples of the sort discussed by Samuelson. We DEMO from the unwillingness to
accept a 50/50 lose $100/gain $200 gamble that Samuelson's colleague was not an expected-utility
maximizer.
13 Loss DEMO was introduced by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) as part of the more general
'prospect theory," and is reviewed in Kahneman, Knetch, and Thaler (1991). Tversky and Kahne-
man (1991) and others have estimated the loss-aversion-to-gain-attraction ratio to be about 2:1.
14 While DEMO formal definitions of loss aversion have not made explicit the assumption that
people are substantially risk averse even for very small risks (but see Bowman, Minehart, and Rabin
(1999) for an explicit treatment of DEMO issue), most examples and calibrations of loss aversion imply
such small-scale risk aversion.

THE THEOREM
AND A COROLLARY
THEOREM: Suppose that for all w, U(w) is strictly increasing and weakly concave. Suppose that there
exists w > w, g > l > 0, such that for all w E [w, w], .5U(w - 1) + .5U(w + g) < U(w). Then for all

15 But Kahneman and Lovallo (1993), Benartzi and Thaler (1995), and Read, Loewenstein, and
Rabin (1999) argue that an additional departure from standard assumptions implicated in many risk
attitudes is DEMO people tend to isolate different risky choices from each other in ways that lead to
different behavior than would ensue if these risks were DEMO jointly. Samuelson's colleague, for
instance, might reject each 50/50 lose $100/gain $200 gamble if on each of 100 days he DEMO
offered one such gamble, whereas he might accept all of these DEMO if they were offered to him at
once. Benartzi and Thaler (DEMO) argue that a related type of myopia is an explanation for DEMO
"equity premium puzzle"-the mystery about the curiously large premium on DEMO that investors
seem to demand to compensate for riskiness associated with investing in stocks. Such risk aversion
can be explained with plausible (loss-averse) DEMO investors are assumed to assess gains
and losses over a short-run (DEMO) horizon rather than the longer-term horizon for which they are

PROOF OF PART (i) OF THEOREM: For notational ease and without loss of generality, let
r(w) -= U(DEMO) - U(w - 1) = 1. Then clearly U(w - 1) - U(w - 21) 2 1, by the concavity of U(). Also,
since 21 > g > 1, we know that w - 21 + g E (w - DEMO, w), and by the concavity of UQ-) we know that
Hence,
U(w - 21 +g) - U(w - 1)

Hence, if w - 21> w, we know that U(w - 21) - U(w - 31) 2 (g/l) since by assumption, U(w -
21 DEMO) + U(w - 21 + g) < 2u(w - 21). By concavity, we also know that U(w - 31) - U(w - 41) 2
(g/l). More generally, if w - 2kl 2 w, then
U(w - (2k - 1)1) - U(w - 2kl) ? U(w DEMO 2(k - 1)1) - U(w - (2k - 1)1)

These lower bounds on marginal utilities yield the lower bound on total utilities U(w) - U(w - x)
in part (i) of the Theorem.16
PROOF DEMO PART (ii) OF THEOREM: Again let r(w) U(w) - U(w -1) = 1. Then U(w + g) - U(w)
<1. By the concavity of U, U(DEMO)-U(w+g-1)<(l/g). But if w+g<w, this DEMO by
assumption that U(w + 2g) - U(w + DEMO) < (l/g) (since U(w + g -1) DEMO U(w + 2g) < 2U(w + g)).
More generally, we know that if w + mg < w-, then
DEMO(w + mg +g)
- U(w + mg) 2 (1/g)[U(w
+ mg) - U(w + mg -g)].
These upper bounds on marginal utilities yield the upper bound on DEMO U(w + x) - U(w) in part
(ii) of the Theorem.

The theorem is weaker than it could be. DEMO we observe, for all m such that 2 < m < DEMO - w-

COROLLARY: SUppose that for all w, U(w) is strictly increasing and weakly concave. Suppose there
exists g > I > 0 such that, for all w, .5U(w - 1) DEMO .5U(w + g) < U(w). Then for all DEMO integers k, for
all m < m(k), .5(w DEMO 2kl) + .5U(w + mg) < U(w), where

Solving for m yields the formula. Note that if g> 21, we only need U(w) - U(w - 2kl) 2 2k(U(w) -
