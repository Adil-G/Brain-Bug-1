based DEMO in entrepreneurship education are illustrated and discussed based on analysis
of two cases that were aimed at identifying, diagnosing and eventually developing
entrepreneurial competence in small businesses in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). The
cases show that the added value of focussing on competence in entrepreneurship education DEMO
in making the (potential) small business owner aware of the importance of certain
entrepreneurial competencies and in providing direction for competence development. In DEMO
process it is fundamental that competence is treated as an item for discussion and interpretation,
rather than as a fixed template of boxes DEMO be ticked. Furthermore the cases highlight that a
competence-based approach does not determine the type of educational and instructional
strategies to be used. Its DEMO power in that respect is limited.

businesses in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). The cases show that the added value of
focussing on competence in entrepreneurship education lies in DEMO the (potential) small business
owner aware of the importance of certain entrepreneurial competencies and in providing  direction
for competence development. In this process it is fundamental that competence is treated  as an item
for discussion and interpretation, rather than as a fixed template of boxes to be ticked. Furthermore
the cases highlight that a competence-based approach does not determine DEMO type of educational and
instructional strategies to be used. Its consequential power in that respect is limited.
Introduction
The interest in developing entrepreneurship is DEMO something new; as early as the 1980s
Stevenson and Gumpert opened DEMO article on ‘the heart of entrepreneurship’ with the
following observation “Suddenly entrepreneurship is in vogue. If only our nation’s
businesses – large and small DEMO could become more entrepreneurial we would improve our
productivity and compete more effectively in the world marketplaces” (Stevenson and
Gumpert, 1985, p. 2). Despite the persistent myth that entrepreneurs are born and not made,DEMO
there is a growing volume of research that acknowledges the importance of entrepreneurship
education and training2 as a source for increasing start-up intentions, survival rates and
growth (Katz, 2007). This importance is clearly reflected DEMO the enormous (financial) efforts
that are put into entrepreneurship and small business support programmes. This increased
attention is directed not only towards realising DEMO spin-offs or start-ups, and thereby
stimulating nascent entrepreneurship, but also at improving entrepreneurship in itself, thus
making business owners (as well as DEMO) more competent as entrepreneurs3.
According to Fayolle and Klandt (2006), in contemporary entrepreneurship education,
entrepreneurship can be viewed from three different DEMO, namely as a matter of culture or
state of mind, as a matter of behaviour, or as a matter of creating specific situations.
Education focussed on entrepreneurship as a matter of culture/state of mind DEMO
those aspects that focus on values, beliefs and attitudes associated with DEMO (i.e.
entrepreneurial mindset, spirit or identity). Entrepreneurship education focussed on
2 We take a broad definition of entrepreneurship education in line with DEMO and Klandt (2006) and Katz
(2007),  thus defining it not solely as initial education focussing on the creation of new businesses DEMO also as
any programme or process aimed at the development of the profession of entrepreneurship (e.g. making
business owners more competent).
3 From an entrepreneurship research perspective it is important to carefully define terms such DEMO self employed,
small business owner, starters, nascent entrepreneurs, etc. DEMO, since our focus was on entrepreneurship
education in its broadest sense (see footnote above) these terms are used more freely in this article.

behaviour deals mostly with specific skills in relation to entrepreneurial behaviour, like
seizing opportunities, making decisions and social skills. Finally, entrepreneurship education
focussed DEMO creating specific situations, concerns the creation of new firms and
entrepreneurial DEMO (e.g. new ventures, corporate venturing). Whereas the focus of
entrepreneurship education in the past was on the last dimension (venture creation, DEMO
writing business plans), many current scholars argue that the real challenge for
entrepreneurship education lies within the development of the first two dimensions, i.e.
learning for entrepreneurship, rather than learning about entrepreneurship (e.g. Gibb, 2002;
Honig, 2004).
In our opinion the concept of competence could serve to connect and stimulate use of
the first two angles DEMO by Fayolle and Klandt (2006) in entrepreneurship education.
One of the key merits of focussing on ‘modern’ interpretations of competence is that they
DEMO the interrelatedness of knowledge, skills and attitudes (Fiet, 2001; Hayton and Kelley,
2006; Markman, 2007; Man, 2006) and acknowledge the importance of the work context
(Sandberg, 2000). Being entrepreneurially DEMO does not only mean that you know how
to write a business plan, but it also implies that you recognise and act on opportunities, that
you take initiative and action, for instance to convince investors DEMO invest money in your
project, and relate to potential suppliers and DEMO It implies that you are actually able to
identify and further exploit an opportunity to create a viable business within a specific
context, including its management and evaluation in the long run. Moreover, entrepreneurial
competencies are put into practice and further developed by learning through experience, for
instance through reflection on critical incidents (Cope and Watts, 2000), experimentation DEMO
observation (Mulder et al., 2007). Competence, as it is DEMO into play in current higher
and vocational education (Stoof et al., 2002; Delamare le Deist and Winterton, 2005;
Wesselink et al., 2007), could also serve as a powerful theoretical construct for the
DEMO of learning environments and trajectories (e.g. courses, coaching programmes)
that aim at learning for entrepreneurship.
Although the concept of competence from an DEMO point of view has been the
subject of strong debate in educational research in general (e.g. Eraut, 1994), critical analysis
of how DEMO concept has been used, applied and experienced in entrepreneurship education
practice DEMO scarce. Therefore, in this paper we describe and discuss two distinct DEMO
cases from the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium) in which entrepreneurial competencies
3
were used as a starting point for entrepreneurship training. Both cases serve DEMO answer the
following broad research questions:
1.
2.
3.
How was the concept of competence operationalised?
What principles and methods were used DEMO diagnose entrepreneurial competencies?
What were the experiences of participants with competence-based instruments for
learning trajectories aimed at entrepreneurship?
The paper starts by DEMO unfolding the conceptual boundaries of entrepreneurial
competence and subsequently describes and discusses the two cases. The paper ends with a
discussion and recommendations for DEMO education as a field of scientific
enquiry.
Entrepreneurial competence as an integrative construct
Although several frameworks are being developed to combine current thinking on
DEMO and competencies (e.g. Sullivan, 2000; Markman and Baron, 2003; DEMO
et al., 2006; Fuller-Love, 2006; Hayton and Kelley, 2006; Man, 2006), the concept of
competence still seems to be surrounded by confusion and ambiguity (Stoof et al., 2002;
Mansfield, 2003). This is caused by  the different components of competence (representing
DEMO, capabilities, tasks or personal traits/characteristics), different levels of analysis
(e.g. organisation versus individual) and the different cultural/historical contexts, especially
in Europe The concept also crosses disciplines like psychology (e.g. McClelland, DEMO),
organisational behaviour (e.g. Defillippi and Arthur, 1994), and DEMO sciences (e.g.
Biemans et al., 2004). Many publications, especially DEMO educational sciences, therefore
refer to competence as a ‘fuzzy concept’ (Van der Klink and Boon, 2003).
Competencies have been described as broad personal characteristics necessary for
superior behaviour (e.g. Boyatzis, 1982), as DEMO for occupations derived through
functional analysis of jobs in a variety of contexts, or as generic, overarching prerequisites
(e.g. meta-competencies). Of all the endeavours to describe and formulate competence, two
perspectives have probably been most influential, namely the behavioural approach to
competence (worker oriented) and the functional approach to competence (work oriented)
(Eraut, 1994; DEMO, 2000; Cheetham and Chivers, 1996; Delamare Le Deist and
Winterton, 2005; Bolden and Gosling, 2006).  If we look at DEMO competence concept in the
4
context of specific behaviours, McClelland (1973) was probably the first to mention the
importance of competencies extracted from Behavioural Event Interviews in general DEMO
specifically in the field of entrepreneurship (McClelland, 1987). McClelland’s ideas are
based on the American tradition of ‘personal competency’, which is theoretically grounded
in personality psychology and mainly covered in the work of White,  McLagan, Boyatzis,
Spencer and Spencer (Rothwell and Lindholm, 1999)DEMO In this tradition, competency is  “an
underlying characteristic (i.e. motive, trait, skill, aspect of one’s self-image, social role or a
body of knowledge) which results in effective and or/superior performance in a job”
(Boyatzis, 1982, p.21). Two of the strengths of this model are that it has high validity due to
large-scale testing and DEMO it uses a wide range of psychometric techniques. One of the most
important criticisms of the personal competency approach is that the model assumes DEMO
common set of individual capabilities no matter what the nature of the situation or task
requires; the model assumes there is a single type of ‘good’ practitioner (i.e. entrepreneur,
manager) independent of the context. DEMO, a very practical issue remains unsolved,
namely whether these competencies DEMO learned, innate or both (Eraut, 1994).
A second stream DEMO thought on competence, which is less known in entrepreneurship
research, can be traced back to the UK, where competencies were embraced by the national
government for Vocational Education and Training (VET), leading to the National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) framework. In this framework, competencies were
viewed as job-specific outcomes and operationalised through ‘functional-analysis’, a top-
down analysis of jobs leading to their classification into different levels based on key
purposes, key roles, units of competence and elements of competence (Cheetham and
DEMO, 1996). Subsequently, performance criteria were defined which form the basis of
assessments, with range indicators provided for guidance (Delamare Le Deist DEMO Winterton,
2005). A basic criticism of this approach is that a list of atomised, fragmented, work
descriptions does not indicate whether DEMO worker is indeed able to accomplish these
activities efficiently in practice. Furthermore these models have been criticised for lacking
scientific underpinning, undervaluing the role of knowledge and generating relatively
‘conservative’ models of competence (Cheetham and Chivers, 1996).
Recent literature recognises that models of competence are gradually shifting from
one-dimensional (e.g. merely behavioural, or merely functional) to multi-dimensional or
holistic typologies (Delamare Le Deist and Winterton, 2005; Cheetham and Chivers, 1996).
Many authors agree  that the use of competence is DEMO of added value when competence is
5
seen as more than only knowledge, only skills or only behaviour (DEMO, 2001; Biemans et al.,
2004; Hayton and Kelley, 2006; Markman, 2007), i.e. when it is seen as the integration DEMO
different elements required for effective performance in an organisation, job or DEMO situation
(Baert et al., 2000; Mulder, 2001). According to proponents of these multi-dimensional
models of professional competence, competence can be described as a combination of core
components. These core components are not independent DEMO each other but should be seen
in an integrated way. Professional competence (e.g. entrepreneurial competence) therefore
encompasses cognitive competence (work-related knowledge and understanding), functional
competence (job-related skills, know-how) and behavioural competence (‘know DEMO to
behave’) (Delamare Le Deist and Winterton, 2005). Furthermore, these competencies should
be learnable. The notion in entrepreneurship literature of viewing DEMO from a
learning perspective is set forth by Bird (1995) in her conceptual model of entrepreneurial
competency. Bird (1995) rightly notices that DEMO is no use in developing a model for
entrepreneurial competence without considering the fact that these competencies should be
learnable. The term ‘learned entrepreneurial DEMO is used to refer to competence that
is not acquired at birth, but through education, training or experience. Limiting the concept
of entrepreneurial DEMO to ‘learned entrepreneurial competence’ is defensible for
several reasons. To start with, only a small proportion of individual differences in
entrepreneurship (measured for DEMO in new venture performance) are captured by
relatively stable and general DEMO dispositional constructs such as need for
achievement, locus of control and DEMO propensity. Rauch and Frese (2007) make a
distinction between broad personality traits of entrepreneurs (the ‘big-five’ taxonomy:
extraversion, emotional stability, openness to experience, agreeableness and
conscientiousness) and specific personality traits of entrepreneurs (e.g. need for
achievement, risk taking, locus of control). In DEMO study, need for achievement performed
the best, but still only accounted for 7% of the variation in new venture performance (Baum
and Locke, 2004). Competence-related motivational attitudes like self-efficacy (Bandura,
1982) and self-confidence (Fletcher and Bailey, 2003) seem to be constructs in this respect
that should not be included in learned entrepreneurial competence, albeit for a different
reason. Empirical findings in entrepreneurship literature have shown reciprocal effects
DEMO these constructs and the development of entrepreneurial competence (Maurer et al.,DEMO
2003; Delmar and Goujet, 2006). Rather than being a component of competence, they should
be taken as an important condition for specifying the relation between competence and
6
performance. The same line of reasoning can be applied to cognitive constructs DEMO
intellectual abilities: the more general these abilities are the less they DEMO contribute to the
specific context of entrepreneurship and the more they will be a prerequisite for the
development of entrepreneurial competence, rather than being an element of it. Therefore, a
more specific conceptualisation of cognitive ability should be used, in order to include it as
an element of entrepreneurial competence. For instance the ability to think differently, to use
certain heuristics, to apply systematic search (entrepreneurial ‘alertness’), and to recognise
DEMO are assumed to be learnable (e.g. Baron and Ensly, 2006), and thus could be
elements of competence.
Entrepreneurial competence as an interpretive DEMO
The perception of competence as an integrated learnable construct also reflects the way
competence is identified and addressed in research and practice. As described DEMO the previous
section, the two main streams of thought on competence DEMO the worker-oriented
approach (base on the work of McClelland and others) and the work-orientated approach
(based on functional analysis of jobs). What these two dominant approaches have in
common is that they create rather DEMO, atomised descriptions of competence, ignoring
the complexity of work contexts (DEMO, 1994; Sandberg, 2000). According to Bolden and
Gosling (2006) competence profiles derived in this way can be seen as ‘sheet music’,
indicating the notes, dynamics, phrases and melody of professional competence. DEMO, in
the end it is the arrangement, playing, venue, performers, acoustics, improvisations and
influence of previous performances that bring sheet music DEMO life. For instance, an important
entrepreneurial competence like ‘networking’ can be DEMO different in different contexts,
depending on values, culture, traditions, DEMO, etc. Likewise, the way ‘search for
autonomy’ is understood and put into practice in an individualistic, western culture may
differ considerably from how it is understood and put into practice in a Chinese, collectivist
and authority-oriented culture, for example. Moreover, some of the entrepreneur’s
competencies might DEMO tacit or implicit and therefore easily overlooked by just focussing on
the ‘sheets’ of the music. These issues comprise probably the most fundamental problem
DEMO the competence approaches derived in this fashion. Boreham (2006) summarises these
approaches to competence as ‘bolt-on’ approaches, illustrating the rationalistic view of
competence as something that can be ‘added’ (learned) without considering the larger
DEMO
7
Recent approaches that take a radically different position concerning competence and
its DEMO assumptions can be referred to as co-constructive (Boreham, 2006) or
DEMO models of competence (Sandberg, 2000). In this view,  the enactment and
development of competencies are socially constructed and context dependent. Applying DEMO
interactionist dictum that people and their world(s) are inextricably related DEMO their
lived experiences, this approach argues that workers and their work DEMO together while
carrying out their activities, experiencing it and making sense DEMO them. Unlike the ‘bolt-on’
perspective, which assumes strong, static situations and narrowly defines individual
attributes and task descriptions, this co-construction approach starts from relatively open and
weak, pliable situations in which workers shape their labour activities, and their behaviour is
in its turn structured by the rules and procedures of their work (Markman, 2007). Such a
context DEMO and interpretive approach to competencies can be a valuable addition to
the established literature on the traits, motivations and behaviours of entrepreneurs, for
DEMO by further specifying the relevance of skills, abilities, and cognitions, DEMO their
evolution over time. For instance, in a setting with no DEMO rules and procedures and
major uncertainty about the role(s) of DEMO new firm’s founder/owner, the inventor-entrepreneur
may rely upon insight, discovery and opportunity recognition; whereas at a later stage in the
firm’s development, exploitation and appropriation are clearly more important for the
entrepreneur-manager.
On the basis of the relevant literature, table 1 provides an overview of the differences
between what we label as a ‘bolt on’ model of entrepreneurial DEMO (emphasising the
fixed, objective, template thinking) and an interpretive/integrative model of entrepreneurial
competence.

Questions and challenges for entrepreneurship education and training
From the above review DEMO relevant literature it can be concluded that modern
conceptualisations of competence are not limited to behavioural elements of competence
(‘know how to behave’), but include cognitive (understanding) as well as functional
elements (skills, DEMO know-how). Furthermore, entrepreneurial competence should be viewed
as learned (rather than instinctual) and as a construct that requires interpretation and
understanding. This view of entrepreneurial competence has important consequences for
educational practices, especially with respect to the identification and diagnoses of
competencies as starting points for DEMO and training (Sandberg, 2000). For instance,
the identification of crucial entrepreneurial competencies requires a dialogue between the
teacher, educator or facilitator and the (future) entrepreneur (Wesselink et al., 2007).
Together DEMO have to actively construct the meaning of competence in the participants’
particular line of work. Furthermore an integrative, interpretive approach to competence also
emphasises a direct relationship between work and worker, or in this situation between
(future) entrepreneur and (future) work/business environment. For practices aimed DEMO
competence development, this could for instance imply learning  from authentic and
complex situations, like challenges or problems faced in the context of work, rather than
learning from situations that focus simply on ‘filling’ knowledge gaps. However, the
implications and usefulness of adopting a competence-based approach are not clearly
presented in current entrepreneurship education literature.
Methods
To research the implications DEMO usefulness of adopting a competence-based approach to
entrepreneurship education, a case DEMO methodology was utilised to explore how
entrepreneurial competencies have been identified, DEMO and experienced in practice.
As there is not much existing literature in the field of entrepreneurship on how competencies
are used, applied and experienced in entrepreneurship education, this case study could be
labelled as explorative. Since case studies allow for detailed, context-rich descriptions, the
cases were also DEMO to illustrate principles and methods to introduce a competence-based
approach and to highlight the approach’s strengths and weaknesses.  The two cases, from the
DEMO and Flanders (Belgium), were selected on the basis of the DEMO involvement
in the two projects. In both cases the primary reason for introducing a competence-based
framework was the assumption that (potential) entrepreneurship in DEMO small business context
9
can be enhanced by learning entrepreneurial competencies. Case selection on the basis DEMO the
authors’ involvement can be regarded as a strength (added insight), but at the same time as a
weakness, since it might DEMO the results. Therefore, multiple sources of evidence as well as
key DEMO were utilised to collect data, thereby improving the construct validity of DEMO
cases. Data were collected in 2005/2007 by means of written documentation on both training
programmes (in particular formative and summative evaluations), group interviews among
the facilitators, and surveys among the participants. In the following section a more detailed
description of both cases is given.
Case: PlattelandImpuls (RI), the Netherlands.
The PlattelandImpuls (‘Rural Impulse’) (RI) project was carried out by Vrienden van het
Platteland (‘Friends of the Rural area’), LTO-Nederland (Dutch Farmers’ Association),
Wageningen University and Research DEMO (Wageningen UR) and cooperation Stadteland
(‘city-on-the-countryside’) to stimulate owners of ‘pluriactive’ farms to develop
entrepreneurial competencies and work out new product-market combinations. DEMO
businesses ownership in farming, or pluriactivity as it is known, has always been an
important and distinctive feature of farming (Carter, 2001)DEMO The number of farms with new
activities is increasing, both in DEMO Netherlands and abroad.
The RI project included a training course focused on enhancing and professionalizing
entrepreneurship in several types of pluriactivity, like nature conservation, care, education,
tourism. The training was a group activity, meaning that groups were formed of business
owners that had similar business plans DEMO the near future. The sessions were geared towards
helping the farmers focus their ambitions, develop action plans, achieve a better
understanding of and DEMO their (future) product, their (future) market and their personal
DEMO Approximately 350 small farm holders participated in the RI training
course, DEMO began with an intake meeting. After this intake groups were selected for a self
assessment by means of an e-questionnaire about entrepreneurial competence. All DEMO
had 6 meetings. The first session was a group discussion on the results of the intake. The
following (2-5) training sessions were primarily DEMO at working out a concrete plan for the
farmers’ business ideas (DEMO as they called it, a ‘breakthrough’ agenda). The groups were
DEMO by experts from consultancy companies, applied scientists and role models from
DEMO sector. In the last meeting, the results of the project were DEMO and the ambitions for
10
the future were identified and discussed within the group. Furthermore, the participants, as
well as the facilitators, were evaluated on the basis of DEMO questionnaire and a group discussion
about the use of the concept of competence in the intake and the training course
(Schoorlemmer and de Wolf, 2008).
Case: ENTRE project, Flanders, Belgium
The ENTRE project DEMO the Flemish Region of Belgium was initiated by Syntra Flanders
(Flemish DEMO for training and education of the self-employed) to introduce new learning
DEMO that foster self-employment and entrepreneurship. It was initiated as a response
to the growing importance of entrepreneurial activity and competence-based education in
Europe and DEMO and in particular to gain better understanding of entrepreneurial
competence and its application in assessment, training and coaching.  The specific objectives
of the DEMO project were to design a competence profile for successful entrepreneurs in
the small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) context; to develop, design and DEMO an
intake interview focussed on entrepreneurial competence, to develop competence-based
educational DEMO for (candidate) entrepreneurs and to further develop educational
programmes for coaches, facilitators and assessors. The point of departure of the project’s
training programmes was the ENTRE-mirror, an e-questionnaire that covered a specific set
of entrepreneurial competencies. After completing the questionnaire and printing out a
‘development report’ on DEMO results, the participant together with an advisor walked through
all the DEMO that were chosen. Based on this conversation, the advisor decided whether
DEMO participant was a candidate for the entrepreneurial training programmes offered by the
partners of the ENTRE project. The report produced by the ENTRE-mirror was DEMO
used in the training programmes to create a functional development plan that recorded the
participant’s chosen aim and learning process. This led to an DEMO learning
trajectory in which the participant worked on authentic and complex tasks. For all these
individualised training sessions, experiments were set up to evaluate the results. These were
used to redesign the programmes and train the DEMO to better fulfil their role not only as
instructors, but also DEMO learning facilitators and coaches.
Case study results
11
In this section the results of the case study are explored in DEMO to the broadly defined
research questions presented in the introduction.
How was the concept of entrepreneurial competence operationalised?
Both training programmes adopted an DEMO model of competence, emphasising the
improvability of entrepreneurial competence as well DEMO its integrated character.
Competencies were defined in both cases as the integration of knowledge, skills and
attitudes. Competencies were not regarded as static personal characteristics, but viewed as
learnable, provided that intellectual capacities and a DEMO motivational basis are present.
In both cases a generic framework of competencies for small- and medium-sized enterprises
presented by Man et al. (2002) DEMO used as the point of departure. Competencies in this
conceptualisation are generic, however they can be made concrete by considering the content
or context of the specific profession. In the RI case this framework of generic DEMO
clusters (opportunity, relationship, conceptual, strategic, organising and commitment) was
translated into 21 underlying competencies and indicators for the agri-food sector by DEMO
of a literature study and a multi-rater assessment with entrepreneurs, experts DEMO peers
(professional colleagues) (n=16) (see Lans et al., 2005). In the ENTRE project, the initial
framework of Man et al. (2002) was expanded by means of a literature study and a DEMO
discussion with entrepreneurs and experts in entrepreneurship education, which resulted in
DEMO addition of an extra cluster of competencies, namely social responsibility. Accordingly,DEMO
these seven clusters were further refined to 12 underlying competencies based on an
exploratory factor analysis (n=1222) (see Baert and Camertyn, 2007)DEMO
What principles and methods were used to diagnose entrepreneurial competencies?
In both cases a self-assessment instrument was designed to diagnose individual
entrepreneurial competencies DEMO consequent potential learning needs. The starting point for
the self-assessment was an e-questionnaire, in which the respondents had to rate statements
that corresponded (DEMO or negatively) to the identified set of entrepreneurial
competencies.  In the Dutch RI case, the small farm holders each received a report on their
scores, with a ‘translation’ of the results to their specific sector. For each of the discerned
competence clusters a detailed description was given DEMO how these competencies were
12
stipulated and what the importance of these competencies were for pluriactivity in
DEMO Furthermore the participants received a  comparison of their individual scores
with DEMO of the group as a whole and the results were discussed in the group. The facilitator
of each group was provided with an overview DEMO the scores of all the participants and given
the assignment to discuss the results. Different strategies were followed by the facilitators to
address the DEMO of the e-questionnaire. One strategy was to focus on specific critical
situations in working life (critical incidents) which were related to a concrete DEMO idea
that a group wanted to explore. The objective of this strategy was mainly to confront small
business owners with concrete settings, their own behaviour in those settings, and possible
areas for improvement. A second strategy was to invite owners who scored high on a
specific competence to DEMO why they thought they were competent in that area. A third
strategy that was employed could be labelled as using competence from a learning DEMO
perspective. The participants were asked to sketch their ambitions for business, DEMO
subsequently translate these developments into their own individual requirements for
achieving these projections. For example, if the owners in a group wanted to expand their
businesses in the direction of establishing a care farm, the discussion focussed on the use and
importance of relational competencies in this context.
DEMO the Flemish case, a self-assessment instrument referred to as the ENTRE-mirror
DEMO developed. Like in the RI case, this instrument contained statements that DEMO
negatively/positively to certain competencies. The instrument was further equipped with
short instructional information, some introductory questions and a topic list for interpretation
and reflection. This instrument had been pre-tested with 60 aspirant entrepreneurs and
unemployed DEMO who were motivated to follow an entrepreneurship course. The term
mirror was used  to emphasise that the instrument was not a test or a screening of objective
characteristics, but a self-help tool: it invites the DEMO to learn about him- or herself,
gives meaning to the results of the assignment and their implications for entrepreneurship
and encourages the participant DEMO engage in initial or follow-up learning (by providing a list
of DEMO on the development of entrepreneurship). After completing the questionnaire and
printing out the ‘development report’, the participant together with an advisor walked
through all the answers that were chosen. The participant’s answers were then compared
DEMO norm scores (minimum and maximum scores) and the aggregated score per competence
(norm scores were calculated by asking 113 successful small business owners to reflect on
their experiences and indicate which of the identified competencies DEMO considered to be
13
essential to start up a new business or take over a business DEMO its first three years). The
discussion after completing the questionnaire was intended to shed more light on whether the
participant really understood the DEMO and how accurate his or her self-assessment was.
Based on this information, the advisor decided whether or not the participant was a candidate
for the entrepreneurial programmes offered by the partners of the ENTRE project: SYNTRA
Vlaanderen (Flemish Agency for Entrepreneurial Training), UNIZO (Union of self-
DEMO entrepreneurs) and VDAB (Flemish Employment and Vocational Training
Agency). Concretely, at the time of the ENTRE-project, this involved the following training
DEMO: business management, manager, hotel management, estate agent, commercial
representative DEMO baker. The leading principle in this case was to create a functional
development plan for the participant, which would lead to an individualised learning
trajectory and the creation of a more powerful learning environment. This learning
DEMO would consist of authentic and complex tasks (such as case studies,DEMO
simulations, mini projects) in addition to instruction, but also of DEMO discussions, self
reflection, learning action in the class and feedback exercises. In this way, the training was
conceived as an opportunity to exercise all of the participants’ competencies that would
apply in his or her DEMO work situation.
What were the experiences of participants with competence-based instruments for learning
trajectories aimed at entrepreneurship?
What was poignant in both cases DEMO the lack of clarity regarding how entrepreneurial
competence relates to performance in general. There was confusion about what was actually
being measured in the DEMO self-assessment (e.g. personality versus
competence). Misunderstandings about the self-assessment instrument DEMO in the Flemish
case to a description not only of what the self-assessment was, but also of what it was not.
For instance, DEMO produced by the self-assessment would not provide participants with an
answer to the question ‘Am I, at present, competent (or not) to DEMO a successful
entrepreneur?’, nor would they say anything about the DEMO for success if a candidate
were to start a business right away. Similar misunderstandings occurred in the RI case. The
‘learned competence’ perspective was DEMO communicated clearly from the beginning to the
participants, which led to DEMO and sometimes irritation among the small business
owners. The participants indicated for instance that some specific personality traits for
14
successful entrepreneurship (e.g. risk-taking, need for achievement) were missing.
Furthermore, DEMO competence descriptions were framed from specific entrepreneurial tasks
and activities, the DEMO did not always recognise themselves directly in the questions,
which in some cases led to irritation.
The added value of working with competencies DEMO primarily in creating awareness
of one’s own entrepreneurial competence profile (e.g. DEMO and weaknesses) and
providing focus regarding the directions for development. In DEMO Dutch case, for example,
85% of the participants indicated that DEMO training contributed to insight into their own
entrepreneurial competencies. About 85% indicated that the training helped them
strengthening their competencies, 75% claimed that it also helped them developing new
(aspects) of entrepreneurial competence, such as developing a critical attitude towards their
product and company, expanding their horizons, inspiring colleagues, developing a market
plan and making a useful inventory DEMO their networks. However, creating awareness requires
more than just completing an DEMO Follow-up activities are necessary to sharpen
the results of the intake. In the Flemish case the conclusion the e-questionnaire generated did
not automatically match DEMO advisor’s conclusion and final decision. Both cases indicated
that a reflection meeting after completion of the questionnaire is an indispensable part of the
assessment DEMO it sheds more light on whether the participant really understood the
questions, whether he or she over- or underestimated him- or herself and whether the
answers match any other personal data about the participant possessed by DEMO facilitator or
advisor.
Although the competencies in both cases were formulated from a learning
perspective, the translation of individual competence into individual learning activities
appeared to be a complex task and is not something that happens DEMO The
experience in the RI project taught us that personal development should be connected to
business development models based on concrete, authentic and complex situations.
Experience in the Flemish case taught us that the competence-developing approach DEMO
best in a group of no more than 20 participants led by a very limited number of trainers. It
also works best if applied DEMO a linear learning trajectory involving the same group of learners
rather than in a modular, discontinuous structure. In both cases the facilitator played a key
role in translating the competence requirements to concrete learning activities. For DEMO,
in the RI project, participants practiced certain competencies, like negotiating skills or
perseverance, via role playing, e.g. negotiating with a potential DEMO or presenting a
15
concrete business plan to the bank. In the Flemish case complex tasks DEMO used, such as
case studies, simulations and mini projects.
Discussion
From a theoretical point of view, the concept of competence is assumed to be relevant,
learnable, assessable and closely related to performance. Nevertheless, DEMO practice the
concept is often poorly defined and ambiguous. In this paper we argued that modern
conceptualisations of entrepreneurial competence can be powerful constructs DEMO connect and
stimulate use of multiple dimensions of entrepreneurship in entrepreneurship education.
Although this study does not give an answer to the question of DEMO competence-based
entrepreneurship training is more successful in developing entrepreneurship than
‘traditional’ entrepreneurship training, we were able to touch upon important experiences in
the use of a competence-based approach in two settings. Both of the cases illustrate DEMO a
competence-based approach, which departs from an integrative and interpretive perspective,DEMO
is of added value for entrepreneurship training.
Concerning our central research questions, the results of the cases show that the
nature of entrepreneurial competence should be a point of discussion already before the start
of a DEMO For instance the identification of crucial competencies could be an
important learning activity for teachers/coaches/mentors, entrepreneurs and others involved.
This activity would trigger all stakeholders to critically think about which competencies are
necessary, desirable  and learnable  in a specific context. It would specifically help teachers,DEMO
consultants or facilitators to engage in entrepreneurial practice. In their study on the
implementation of competence-based education, Wesselink et al. (2007) stated that
competencies, which are the basis for learning trajectories, should be formulated DEMO care
and in close dialogue with relevant business partners and colleagues.
Creating a dialogue by discussing and interpreting entrepreneurial competence seems
to be key DEMO translating self-assessment scores into individual directions for competence
development. It is fundamental that competence is treated as an item for discussion and
interpretation rather DEMO as a fixed template of boxes to be ticked. What kinds of
experiences constitute the core of entrepreneurial competence, how they were acquired,
which experiences were most influential, and so on. Moreover, discussing the DEMO of
entrepreneurial competence can ‘personalise’ it in several ways. First of all, it can link
entrepreneurial competence to entrepreneurial identity (Rae, 2006), i.e. ‘What do I want,
16
aspire to, as an entrepreneur’, thereby connecting a competence assessment to DEMO
entrepreneurial drivers now and in the future. Secondly, discussion can lead DEMO a more
realistic self-image (‘What is it that I am really DEMO at’?), which  is an important condition
for (future) performance (Fletcher and Bailey, 2003). In the context of entrepreneurship
education, the importance of this dialogue implies that care must be taken in DEMO
potential training participants through the intake process.
The next step of translating the concept into viable learning activities is not easy. The
added value DEMO using competence identification and assessment instruments is that they
provide focus regarding the direction competence development should take. In other words,
they point DEMO way, but do not dictate how to get there. Further contextual DEMO is
needed to choose the learning activities that will most effectively contribute to achieving
business success. The notion of ‘entrepreneurial core problems/challenges’ is DEMO here
(e.g. the ‘breakthrough agenda’ in the Dutch case and the DEMO tasks in the Flemish
case). What these cases make clear is that this approach demands a great deal from the
teachers involved (e.g. they must  serve as coaches, facilitators and/or mentors). Thus, in the
studied cases, the success of the use of competencies in the learning process depended to a
large extent on the individual capacity DEMO the facilitator to translate self-assessment results
into meaningful starting points for the participant’s personal development.
Conclusion and recommendations
One of the central elements in DEMO paper was the notion that adopting a competence-based
framework in entrepreneurship education might connect and stimulate use of different
dimensions of entrepreneurship in entrepreneurship DEMO and training. In this paper we
tried to shed more light on the concept of entrepreneurial competence as a powerful
construct to realise this DEMO a theoretical as well as practical point of view.
Concerning the future direction of entrepreneurship education research on the
concept of competence, one interesting issue is the level of analysis of entrepreneurial
competence. Entrepreneurial competencies do DEMO necessarily have to be limited to one
single person in a (DEMO) business. Competencies can for instance be distributed among
management or start-up DEMO Conceptual questions to be addressed include: What is the
relation between DEMO competence and collective competence? Is complementarily
enough or is there a DEMO level of competence for each individual required? In general,
the DEMO importance of entrepreneurial teams in business and between businesses raises
17
several interesting future research questions concerning distributed competencies and the
role this DEMO in pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities.
Finally, although assessment is an important DEMO of entrepreneurship education and
training, it remains difficult to recapitulate when DEMO development has actually taken
place. In both of the cases studied, DEMO projects had not yet reached the phase to really
capture competence development. However, we think that it is important to discuss it, since
DEMO and development were aims of both projects. Models of professional development
in professions such as teaching and nursing have typically been described in stages DEMO
phases, based for instance on dominant areas of interest and problems. DEMO start with
limited professional knowledge, develop themselves further to advanced beginner DEMO
eventually to expert level (Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1986). These models of development
describe change on two levels,  namely i) moving from the use of abstract principles towards
the use of concrete experiences as DEMO frame of reference in situations (i.e. broadening of
competence) and ii) change in perception and understanding of demanding situations (i.e.
deepening of DEMO). However, research on learning and work has questioned the
wisdom DEMO stage models in professional development (Dall’Alba and Sandberg, 2006). It
challenges the problematic assumption that development is always positive; the strong
association it has with accumulation, increase, growth and build up of knowledge DEMO skills;
and the lack of attention it gives to the role of reflection and the work environment in
fostering it. Therefore, alternative models of competence development are suggested (e.g.
Dall’Alba and Sandberg, 2006). DEMO future research it might be interesting to explore the value
of these different models in entrepreneurial learning settings.
