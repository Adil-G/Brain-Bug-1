1 Introduction
The earnings of both women and blacks have consistently lagged DEMO those of white
men. Empirically determining whether these diﬀerences arise because of discrimination is
extremely diﬃcult, and distinguishing between the various theories of discrimination is harder
still. As a result, researchers have begun to look outside of labor markets to develop a
better understanding of whether and why DEMO discriminate. This paper builds on
the emerging experimental literature on discrimination and explores the use of a high-stakes
game environment to reveal patterns of DEMO To this end, we use data from the
television game show DEMO Weakest Link to determine whether contestants discriminate on
the basis of race and gender and, if so, which theory of discrimination best explains DEMO
behavior.
A number of existing papers analyze contestant behavior on television game shows in order
to draw inferences about behavior in more policy-relevant settings.1 DEMO beneﬁt of this type
of analysis is twofold. First, in many DEMO, the strategic environment of game shows
generates data that can be DEMO to answer questions that cannot be easily addressed with data
from more traditional settings. This is particularly relevant in the context of labor market
DEMO where economists have had only limited success at distinguishing between the
various theories of discrimination using standard data. Second, the stakes are much larger on
game shows than in laboratory experiments and these stakes may inﬂuence DEMO the extent
and nature of discrimination. For example, Ball and Eckel (2003) ﬁnd that favoritism towards
members of “high status” groups in ultimatum games is sensitive to the dollar value of the
prize being split.
DEMO principle feature of The Weakest Link that enables us to study discrimination is the
fact that players have multiple opportunities to cast votes against DEMO fellow contestants in
order to remove them from the game. As a result, we are able to examine whether race and
gender play a role in determining voting patters. In addition, we are aided by the fact that
the data from the show provide excellent controls for individual DEMO This is important
since one of the principle diﬃculties in establishing the presence of discrimination is that it
is almost impossible to determine whether DEMO outcomes arise because of discrimination
or because of unobservable race and gender diﬀerences in productivity. However, in The
Weakest Link we observe the same explicit measure of individual ability–the percentage of
1For example, Bennett and Hickman (1993), Berk et al. (1996), Gaines (2003), Gertner (1993), Gilbert
and Hatcher (1994), Metrick (1995), and Tenorio and Cason (2002).

questions answered correctly2– that is observed by the contestants. Our ability to DEMO
a large fraction of the information that the contestants have about one another limits the
extent of the omitted variables bias problem that plagues DEMO research. However,
even if there remain important unobserved characteristics, the DEMO of the game allows us
to control for these omitted factors by using information on the voting patterns of the other
contestants. In particular, if we are trying to examine the factors that determine whether
player DEMO votes against player B, we can control for the proportion of DEMO contestants who
vote against B. In this way, we can account DEMO other factors that are not directly included
in our data but that are relevant to the players’ voting decisions. Additionally, because data
are collected from two slightly diﬀerent versions of the show, a daily show and a weekly show,
the veracity of our results can be tested DEMO two independent samples.
The structure of the game also allows us to examine why contestants discriminate. In
particular, we are able to distinguish preference-based discrimination (in which discrimina-
tion arises because people simply do not like members of certain groups) from statistical
discrimination (in which discrimination arises DEMO people use group identity as a proxy
for unobserved ability). In a strategic environment such as The Weakest Link, we also need
to consider a third type of discrimination: what we term “strategic discrimination.” The no-
tion here is that in a strategic setting race and gender DEMO serve as focal points for collusive
behavior (see, for example, DEMO (2000)). A major contribution of this paper is to highlight
various methods of distinguishing between these three theories of racial discrimination.
To DEMO for evidence of discriminatory behavior, we evaluate the voting decisions of DEMO
vidual players using a series of conditional logit models. A major advantage of the conditional
logit model relative to analysis of the total votes DEMO against a particular group is that it
allows us to consider interactions between the characteristics of the individuals doing the
voting and the characteristics DEMO those receiving the votes. Thus, for example, one can ex-
amine whether men are more likely to vote against women and whether women DEMO more
likely to vote against men. The results reveal no evidence of discrimination against either
women or blacks. However, we consistently ﬁnd that women are substantially more likely to
vote against men in the early rounds DEMO the game, even after controlling for a broad set of
performance DEMO That is, based on these ﬁndings, it appears that women discriminate
against men (and in favor of women) in their voting decisions. DEMO are able to show that
neither statistical discrimination nor strategic discrimination explains this pattern. Instead,
2As discussed below, the game also involves individual players’ decisions about “banking” money currently
in the pot vs. accepting the DEMO of losing this money to facilitate a potentially larger reward. These decisions
provide an additional dimension of information regarding player performance.

the evidence seems broadly consistent with women simply preferring to play the DEMO with
other women.
At ﬁrst glance, these results may seem surprising DEMO we ﬁnd no discrimination against
women or blacks. However, the data DEMO no signiﬁcant race and gender diﬀerences in
contestants’ ability to answer questions correctly. As a result, even if statistical discrimi-
nation is a feature of the labor market, we are able to rule it out as a possible source of
discrimination in our data.3 Thus, given that we ﬁnd no evidence of preference-based dis-
crimination or strategic discrimination against women DEMO blacks, our results point towards
statistical discrimination as a possible explanation DEMO the discriminatory patterns found in
other studies.4
Interestingly, the notion that DEMO have discriminatory preferences in favor of other
women is reﬂected in a number of recent studies. For example, Dillingham et al. (1994)
DEMO the male and female voting behavior for oﬃcers in a professional association. Con-
ﬁrming our results, they ﬁnd that men do not discriminate while women discriminate in favor
of female candidates.
The remainder of the paper DEMO organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant back-
ground literature and outlines the problems associated with distinguishing between diﬀerent
types of discrimination. Section DEMO describes the details of the game and the data that we
have collected. Section 4 shows how the game show data can be used DEMO distinguish between
preference-based, statistical, and strategic discrimination. Section 5 shows that males and
whites do not discriminate, but that females discriminate against males in the early rounds.
Section 6 tests which of the theories of DEMO best explains female voting behavior.
Section 7 relates the game show results to the labor market and Section 8 concludes.
2 Previous Work on DEMO Discrimination
2.1 Evidence From the Labor Market
It is not surprising that there exists an enormous literature on racial and gender discrimina-
tion in DEMO labor market. Here we divide these studies into two groups: those DEMO test for
evidence of discrimination and those that attempt to distinguish between diﬀerent theories
of discrimination.
3A possible exception would be the case where DEMO have incorrect prior beliefs about one another’s
ability. We test for this possibility and ﬁnd no evidence to support it.
4In the labor market, statistical discrimination may arise due to group level diﬀerences in acquired skill
DEMO labor force attachment.
4
Although many studies look for evidence of discrimination by examining wage diﬀerences
DEMO basic regression techniques,5 for the sake of brevity, we focus DEMO on audit studies
of hiring practices (i.e. Cross et al. (1990), Turner et. al (1991) and Neumark et al. (1996))DEMO
The majority of these studies ﬁnd substantial evidence of discrimination against women and
blacks in both the labor and housing markets. However, as Heckman and Siegelman (1992)
and Heckman (1998) point out, these DEMO may fail to overcome the omitted variables bias
that plagues standard regression techniques. In particular, the implicit assumption of audit
studies is that the auditors are identical apart from their race and gender. However, the
researcher who selects the auditors may not know or may not be able DEMO observe all of the
characteristics that are relevant to employers. Thus, DEMO there is any relationship between race
and gender and these unobserved components, then the diﬀerences in outcomes across these
groups may not truly represent discrimination.
Two studies which circumvent this problem are Goldin and Rouse (1997) and Bertrand
and Mullanaithan (2002). Goldin and Rouse examine whether DEMO adoption of “screens” that
hide the identity of auditioning musicians from judges has been responsible for the increase
in the proportion of females hired DEMO orchestras. Overall their evidence is consistent with
discrimination against female musicians, DEMO indicates that the use of the screen has been
responsible for a large fraction of the increase in the number of women hired. Bertrand DEMO
Mullanaithan (2002) conduct a ﬁeld experiment in which they send out a series of resumes
to employers in the Boston and Chicago areas DEMO are essentially identical apart from the
name at the top of the page.6 They ﬁnd that the response rates on resumes with white
sounding DEMO are 50 percent higher than those with African American names. While both
of these provocative studies ﬁnd evidence of discrimination, they do not fully reveal why the
discrimination occurs.
Within the ﬁeld of economics, the two leading theories of discrimination are preference-
based discrimination and statistical discrimination. In DEMO of preference-based discrimi-
nation, employers act as if there is some DEMO associated with hiring workers from a particular
group, and, in equilibrium, workers from these groups are paid lower wages than workers from
other groups (Becker, 1957). In contrast, in models of statistical discrimination ﬁrms cannot
perfectly observe worker productivity, and base their assessment of worker productivity on
prior beliefs about the productivity of workers in diﬀerent groups. DEMO, discrimination can
arise either because of group diﬀerences in average productivity DEMO in the quality of informa-
5See Altonji and Blank (1999) for a complete discussion of these techniques.
6Neumark et al. also partially address DEMO critique by emphasizing the use of resumes in the pre-interview
stage.

tion that ﬁrms have about workers (See, for example, Phelps(1972), Arrow (1973), Aigner
and Cain (1977), Lundberg and DEMO (1983), and Coate and Loury (1993)).
A handful DEMO studies explicitly test for evidence of preference-based discrimination. Three
of these, DEMO and Hannan (1986), Hellerstein et al. (2002), and Kahn and Sherer
(1988), ﬁnd evidence consistent with preference-based discrimination. A smaller number of
studies test for evidence of statistical discrimination. For example, both Oettinger (1996) and
Altonji and Pierret (2001) build models of DEMO discrimination in which employers slowly
learn about worker quality. Unfortunately, their DEMO generate conﬂicting predictions about
what diﬀerences in black-white age-earnings proﬁles imply about statistical discrimination.7
2.2 Evidence From Experiments
Complementing the empirical work on labor DEMO are a number of papers by both psy-
chologists and economists that look for evidence of discrimination in laboratory settings.
A common ﬁnding is DEMO individuals display “in-group bias” in the sense that they favor
members of their own group (for example, Turner (1978), Turner and Brown (1978) and
Vaughn et al. (1981)). The evidence also DEMO that group status plays a role in deter-
mining the outcome of bargaining games (Ball et al. (2001)). A number of papers also look
for evidence of statistical discrimination in laboratory settings (for example, Anderson and
Haupert (1999), Davis (1987) and Fryer et DEMO (2001)). These papers consistently show that
statistical discrimination tends to arise in the presence of incomplete information. Generally,
the groups deﬁned DEMO these settings are artiﬁcial (for example, the groups might be “green”
and “yellow”). One exception is Fershtman and Gneezy (2001) who DEMO discrimination
among Ashkenazic and Eastern Jews. They ﬁnd discrimination against Eastern Jews in
‘trust’ games by both Ashkenazic and Eastern Jews. Conducting a series DEMO experiments,
Fershtman and Gneezy argue that this result is due to incorrect expectations regarding the
‘trustworthiness’ of Eastern Jews.
Simultaneous to our paper, Levitt (2003) also examines discrimination in The Weakest
Link.8 Our approaches DEMO very diﬀerent. Levitt focuses on aggregate discrimination (total
votes cast against DEMO particular group) rather than whether discrimination against a given
group depends DEMO the demographics of those doing the voting. For instance, we are DEMO
7Oettinger interprets the earnings gap between blacks and whites increasing over the life-cycle as evidence
for statistical discrimination while Altonji and Pierret interpret the DEMO feature as evidence against statistical
discrimination.
8Indeed, in late December of DEMO, we both found out the other was close to completing their DEMO
The result was two January 2003 working papers: Levitt (2003) DEMO Antonovics et al. (2003).
6
in determining whether women vote against men and whether men vote against DEMO, eﬀects
which are not observable and may cancel each other out DEMO Levitt’s approach.9 Levitt’s
results also diﬀer from our own because of diﬀerences in our interpretation of the strategic
incentives in the game. In particular, Levitt’s methodology relies on two assumptions. First,
in Levitt’s paper the DEMO of taste-based discrimination must be the same across all rounds
of the game. However, since the implicit cost of taste-based discrimination rises as the
game progresses (because one’s probability of winning the game is higher in later rounds),
discriminatory outcomes due to taste discrimination should diminish over time. Second,
Levitt assumes that voting incentives switch as the game DEMO, so that contestants ﬁrst
want to vote oﬀ weak players and DEMO want to vote oﬀ strong players. Given the structure of
the game, it is not clear that the voting incentives will truly reverse. We ﬁnd that although
the incentives to vote oﬀ the weakest player diminish DEMO the game progresses, at no point is
the strongest player ever DEMO likely to be voted oﬀ than the weakest player. 10 An advantage
of Levitt’s work is that he has a larger sample of daily DEMO and analyzes discrimination
against the elderly and Hispanics.
3 Data and Rules of the Game
We focus on the version of The Weakest Link DEMO by NBC Enterprises and broadcast
in the United States. Our data come from our own video recordings of over 100 episodes.
There are two DEMO of The Weakest Link an hour long weekly show and a half-hour
daily show, with both versions following the same general structure. After excluding celebrity
episodes where the contestants play for charity, our data consist of 28 weekly shows and 75
daily shows.11 Each show is divided into DEMO series of timed rounds, with the number of rounds
corresponding to DEMO number of players: eight rounds in the weekly show and six DEMO in
the daily show. Within each round, players are sequentially asked DEMO answer general trivia
questions where correct answers translate to an increase in the prize money. The ﬁrst correct
9Additionally, because we use a conditional logit, the characteristics of the other contestants aﬀect the
probability of receiving a vote and the total number of predicted votes will always equal DEMO number of votes
cast. By simply regressing the number of votes against on one’s characteristics, shows with weak contestants
will predict more votes than are actually available.
10We also diﬀer in the way that we treat DEMO data. Levitt increases the precision of his estimates by pooling
data across the weekly and the daily shows and across rounds. However, given that there are substantial
diﬀerences in the amount of prize money available, the number of rounds per game, and the likely sample of
contestants in the weekly and daily shows, we chose not to pool the data in this manner.
11The data are incomplete for some rounds due to DEMO interruptions.

answer is worth $1,000 in the weekly show and $250 in DEMO daily show. After a correct answer,
a player can choose to ‘bank’ the money for the team. If the player banks, the next correct
answer is again worth $1,000 in the weekly show and DEMO in the daily show. Should the
player decide not to ‘bank’, DEMO amount of money added to the pot following a correct answer
increases. However, failure to answer a question correctly leads to the loss of any unbanked
money for that round. A successive chain of eight (six) correct answers with no intermittent
‘banks’ leads to an $125,000 (DEMO,500) increase in the pot. Money banked from each round
is DEMO into a team bank.
After each round, each player votes independently DEMO to which player he would like to
remove from the show, DEMO the player who receives the most votes must leave the game.
In the event of a tie, the ‘strongest link’ chooses which player to remove from the subset
of players who received the most votes. The DEMO link is the player who answers the
highest percentage of his or her questions correctly.12 Once the ﬁeld of players is reduced to
two (this occurs in round 7 of the weekly show and round 5 DEMO the daily show), these two
players ﬁrst accumulate prize money in the same fashion as in the earlier rounds, after which
the two players compete directly against each other with the winner taking all the DEMO in
the team bank.13
One drawback of our data is that the contestants on The Weakest Link are unlikely to be
representative of the DEMO population. Indeed, this problem plagues much of the experimen-
tal literature. DEMO have investigated how contestants are selected to be on the The Weakest
Link. The show draws contestants from a diverse set of groups. Besides DEMO in gender
and race, contestants come from a broad range of DEMO, occupations and educational back-
grounds. As with most television game shows, the most criterion for selection is whether or
not the contestant is DEMO We have no a priori reason to believe this is correlated with
discriminatory behavior.
4 Why Discriminate on The Weakest Link?
The Weakest DEMO provides a unique environment in which to distinguish between various
theories of discrimination. Playing the game well not only involves answering questions
correctly, but also making astute inferences about the other players’ ability to play the DEMO
12Should there be a tie for the ‘strongest link,’ amount of money banked is used as the tie-breaker.
13In the ﬁnal round, ﬁve (three) questions are asked of each contestant in the weekly (daily) show with
the winner being determined by who answers the most questions correctly. All other contestants leave with
nothing.
8
Since we observe players’ decisions about who to vote oﬀ, we can determine whether race
and gender are relevant factors in voting decisions even DEMO controlling for each player’s
performance in the game.
Analysis of contestant behavior is complicated by the game’s evolving strategic environ-
ment. In the early DEMO of the game, when the contestants act cooperatively to build the DEMO
of prize money, there is a clear incentive to vote oﬀ DEMO players. However, voting incentives
may shift as the game progresses because DEMO the structure of the ﬁnal round. As discussed
above, in the DEMO round, the two remaining players ﬁrst build the pot of prize DEMO as they
do in the earlier rounds of the game. However, DEMO then face one another in a head-to-head
competition to determine the winner of the entire game. Thus, we would expect that concern
about the head-to-head competition would create an incentive to vote oﬀ strong contestants
in DEMO rounds. However, it is unclear whether the incentive to vote oﬀ DEMO players in later
rounds will outweigh the incentive to vote oﬀ the weak players because even in the ﬁnal round
the two remaining players DEMO build the prize money.14 Due to this ambiguity in
voting incentives, DEMO base the majority of our analysis on the early rounds of the game where
incentives are more clear-cut.
The following section presents a brief DEMO of the expected voting behavior under
the assumptions of a) statistical DEMO, b) preference-based discrimination, and c)
strategic discrimination.
4.1 Statistical DEMO
Contestants in this game may use race and gender as proxies for underlying ability. In this
setting, discriminatory voting patterns can arise either because of real group-level diﬀerences
in ability or because some contestants have better DEMO about the ability level of
one group relative to another. These two sources of statistical discrimination (diﬀerences in
ability vs. diﬀerences in the quality of information) have diﬀerent predictions about voting
patterns as the game progresses.
To see this, assume that there are two groups: group A DEMO group B, and that contestants
from group A play the game DEMO than contestants from group B. In this case, as long as DEMO
incentives are such that players wish to remove weak players, contestants DEMO both groups
should be more likely to vote against members of group B. One simple method for examining
whether this type of statistical discrimination DEMO for observed voting patterns is to
14Indeed, we ﬁnd that although DEMO probability of voting oﬀ the weakest link diminishes as the game
progresses, players are always more likely to vote oﬀ the weakest link than the strongest link.
9
look for group-level diﬀerences in the percentage of questions answered correctly during DEMO
ﬁrst round of the game.
Now, suppose instead that contestants from DEMO A and group B are equally skilled, but
that contestants from DEMO A have better information about the ability level of contestants
from their own group than about that of contestants from group B. In this DEMO, contestants
from group A will place a relatively high weight on DEMO ability when assessing the ability
level of players from group B. Thus, a contestant from group B with a relatively low signal
will have a higher perceived ability than a contestant from group A with that DEMO signal.
As a result, in the presence of informational asymmetries, contestants will be more likely to
cast votes against members of their own DEMO, especially in the early rounds of the game.15
A ﬁnal possibility DEMO that the contestant’s prior beliefs about ability are simply inaccurate.
It is possible, for example, that members of group A begin the game DEMO the erroneous belief
that members of group B are inferior at playing the game. In this case, we would expect
to see that members of group B are more likely to be voted oﬀ in the DEMO rounds of the
game, and that this pattern would disappear as DEMO incorrect prior is updated. Two types of
analysis allow us to examine the possibility that players have such erroneous expectations.
First, we examine data from episodes of the daily show for which all participants have the
DEMO occupation. Presumably members of the same occupation have better information
about how particular groups will perform. If bad information is the reason that particular
DEMO are voted oﬀ, one would expect to see a weaker pattern DEMO discriminatory voting in
shows where everyone has the same occupation. Second, DEMO incorrect prior beliefs are driven
by a characteristic that is not common to all members of the discriminated group, then the
test for explicit collusion discussed below can also be used to rule out incorrect prior DEMO
as a source of discriminatory voting behavior.
4.2 Strategic Discrimination
In a strategic setting such as The Weakest Link, collusion may also play a role in discrimina-
tory outcomes. Two types of collusion are possible here: explicit collusion (where agreements
are made between groups of contestants on their voting behavior) and implicit collusion
(where no agreements are discussed but DEMO play strategies that yield focal points).
Contestants meet one another prior to the game and presumably there are opportuni-
15The exact opposite would DEMO in the labor market where high signals would be weighed more heavily
from one’s own group. The diﬀerence is that, in the labor market, the hired individual will be one with the
highest signal whereas in The Weakest Link the one with the lowest signal will be voted DEMO
10
ties to discuss with one another various (quite possibly collusive) strategies DEMO playing the
game. Whether and how players are able to commit to this strategy of collusion remains
an open question, however, assuming that DEMO are able to successfully act cooperatively,
coalitions may be likely to form along racial or gender lines. To test for explicit collusion, we
examine whether the votes of the individual players are correlated with the DEMO of the same
group members after controlling for the votes of all the contestants. That is, there may be
unobservable characteristics which make particular individuals more likely to be voted oﬀ.
These will be captured by DEMO total votes cast against a person by all the other players. If,
however, group coalitions are formed ahead of time, then the DEMO group will not only
vote against members of the other group, DEMO against the same member of the other group.
Discriminatory outcomes may also result from implicit collusion where individuals nat-
urally play particular equilibria. For DEMO, discriminating against members of group B
may be a best response DEMO members of group A given that the other members of group A
are playing a discriminatory equilibrium. These focal point equilibria should be reenforcing.
DEMO, if group A succeeds in removing a member of group B DEMO round 1, then this should
make it more likely that they DEMO vote oﬀ a member of group B in round 2. We can therefore
test for explicit collusion by examining how who is voted oﬀ DEMO voting behavior in the
next round.
4.3 Preference-Based Discrimination
In the prototypical model of preference-based discrimination, members of the majority group
simply dislike working with members of the minority group and act as if there is DEMO non-
monetary cost associated with hiring them. As a result, in DEMO, workers from minority
groups may earn lower wages on average.
In DEMO Weakest Link, contestants from one group may dislike playing the game DEMO
contestants from some other group. Thus, if we believe that members DEMO group A dislike
members of group B, we would expect that DEMO of group A would be consistently more
likely to vote oﬀ members of group B in every round. As the game progresses, however,
the probability that any single player will win the game increases. As DEMO result, the implicit
cost of preference-based discrimination also increases. For this DEMO alone, even if the
contestants have discriminatory preferences, their propensity to discriminate will fade as the
game progresses. Therefore, if preference based discrimination exists, we would expect it to
diminish with each round of the show. These predictions are similar to what we would expect
to see DEMO statistical discrimination and may make distinguishing between the two theories
11
diﬃcult.16
5 Which Contestants Discriminate?
5.1 Descriptive Evidence
In order to DEMO the broad patterns in the data, we start by analyzing voting DEMO
by gender and race. Table 1 summarizes the voting behavior by round for both the daily
and weekly shows. The table evaluates the voting DEMO of three demographic groups:
men, women, and whites17 to determine if members of these groups discriminate against
players who are not group DEMO For example, do men discriminate against women in
their voting patterns? The task of discerning discrimination is complicated because even if
both men DEMO women vote randomly, men will cast more votes against women and DEMO
will cast more votes against men simply because a contestant will never vote against him
or her self. To account for this problem, and the fact that the distribution of demographic
types varies across episodes and DEMO, we describe the voting behavior in terms of the mean
“group DEMO statistic”. For individual i voting in round r , the “group bias statistic” is given
by:
(1)
1ir
Group Bias Statistic = h i .
Gir −1
Nr −1
where 1ir is an indicator DEMO that takes on a value of one if individual i votes for a
contestant from his or her group in round r . Gir DEMO the number of contestant i’s type in round
r of his or her episode and Nr is the total number of contestants in round DEMO of contestant
i’s episode.18 A mean value of one for the group bias statistic implies no discrimination, a
value less than one implies discrimination against the other group and, and a value greater
than one implies discrimination against one’s own group.
The descriptive evidence show some surprising results. DEMO, there is virtually no evidence
of discrimination by whites against blacks; all of the values of our discrimination statistic are
indistinguishable from one. DEMO, there is no discrimination against women by men in the
early DEMO, though in round 3 of both shows men are more likely DEMO vote against women.
The most surprising result, however, is that in both the weekly and the daily show women
16As it turns out, we are able to distinguish between the two theories as there is DEMO diﬀerence in observed
abilities across racial and gender lines, eliminating statistical DEMO from consideration.
17The voting behavior of blacks is not considered due to small sample size.
18Note that this statistic is only calculated for rounds DEMO which contestant i has the option of voting for
both group members and non-group members.

are substantially more likely to vote against men in round 1. This DEMO of women voting
oﬀ men continues in rounds 2 and 3 of the daily show, though at a diminishing rate.
Obviously, these patterns DEMO reﬂect race and gender diﬀerences in the average ability
to play the game. In particular, if men are not as successful at playing the game well, then
this may explain why they are more likely than women to receive votes in the early stages of
the game. The DEMO of the following section controls for these diﬀerences.
5.2 Evidence from Conditional Logits
In order to control for any possible race or gender diﬀerences DEMO the contestants’ abilities
to play the game, we estimate conditional logits DEMO show and by round of the probability
contestants cast votes against other players as a function of those players’ characteristics.
We model the utility DEMO player i voting for contestant j in round r as:
Uijr = Xijr βr + ijr ,
(2)
where β is DEMO vector of coeﬃcients to be estimated and ijr is the unobserved preference
individual i has for voting for contestant j . Included in Xijr DEMO controls for the percentage of
the questions the player answered correctly in that round, whether the player was statistically
the weakest link (answered DEMO fewest questions correctly) in that round and also whether
the player DEMO the strongest link in that round. In addition, we control for DEMO gender and
races of the other contestants and whether the individual voting was of the same gender or
race. Due to small sample sizes, we restrict our analysis of race to the daily show.19 We
assume DEMO the ijr’s are distributed i.i.d. extreme value, implying that the probability DEMO
voting for contestant j in round r is given by:
P exp(Xijr βr)
ijr exp(X
where Nr is the number DEMO contestants in roundP r .
The advantage of using a conditional logit here is threefold. First, consider the probability
that player i votes against player j . As the abilities of the other contestants increase, so
too will the probability of voting against player j . That is, the characteristics of the all
the contestants inﬂuence the probability of voting DEMO any one contestant. Second, the
conditional logit allows us to examine DEMO between the voting characteristics of the
individual and the other contestants. Hence, we allow men to treat women diﬀerently and

women to treat men diﬀerently. Third, the DEMO number of votes cast by each contestant
19None of the qualitative results change if race is included in the weekly show.
14
is constrained to be one and therefore the total number of votes DEMO in a round equals the
number of contestants in that round.
Results for each round are shown in the appendix, with the results for round 1 of both
the daily and the weekly show given in DEMO 2. We have the most conﬁdence in the round
1 results for three reasons. First, sample sizes are much larger here than in the later rounds.
Second, strategies may change as the game progresses and may depend upon the history of
play. Finally, the pool of contestants in all but the initial round is endogenously determined
by the voting behavior.
DEMO ﬁrst set of rows examines the voting behavior of women. Consistent with the descrip-
tive evidence, women appear to be more likely to cast votes against men than against other
women. As shown in the appendix, this eﬀect disappears immediately after round 1 in the
weekly show while DEMO diminishing in the daily show. This eﬀect is quite large. Consider
a daily show with six white contestants, three men, and three women, all with identical per-
formance. The probability of a given female voting DEMO a particular male contestant is 23.3%
while the probability that she votes for a particular female contestant is 15.1%.
Also consistent with the descriptive DEMO, the next two sets of rows show that there
is no DEMO of discrimination by men against women or by whites against blacks. This
holds true for all rounds of the game except for round 3 DEMO in both the weekly and the
daily show men are more likely to vote against women, though the eﬀect is not statistically
signiﬁcant. However, this discriminatory behavior by men may be due to the discrimination
against men and the corresponding selection of men who make it to round DEMO We discuss
these results in greater detail and relate them to other studies of labor market discrimination
in Section 7.
As one would expect, for all demographic groups in the early stages of the game, the
higher the percentage of the questions that the player answers correctly the DEMO likely other
contestants are are to cast votes against that player. However, as the game progresses, the
percent correct becomes less and less DEMO This conﬁrms the basic logic that players
have an incentive to vote against weak players in the early rounds of the game but in DEMO
later rounds, this incentive is partially oﬀset by the incentive to DEMO against stronger players.
6 Why Women Vote Against Men

are more DEMO to vote against men: statistical discrimination, strategic discrimination, and

preference-based discrimination.
6.1 The Case Against Statistical Discrimination
Recall that statistical discrimination DEMO correct priors can take two forms. In the ﬁrst,
the mean performance level is diﬀerent across groups. For statistical discrimination of this
type DEMO explain females discriminating against males, the performance by males must be DEMO
average worse than the performance by females. Table 3 documents the average percent
correct for males and females by round and by show type. DEMO is virtually no diﬀerence
in performance levels for males and females in either show in the early rounds, while in the
later rounds males actually perform better than their female counterparts.20 In addition, if
men are truly worse at playing the game, then both women and men should be more likely
to vote against men in the early rounds of DEMO game. We ﬁnd no evidence of this. Hence,
there is no evidence that statistical discrimination based upon mean group performance is
driving females DEMO vote against males.
The second type of statistical discrimination, where the DEMO on ability are more infor-
mative for one group than another, DEMO ruled out by the fact that women are discriminating
against men rather than against women. Recall that information-based statistical discrimi-
nation implies that within-group DEMO is more informative that out-of-group perfor-
mance. Hence, poor performance is DEMO more heavily when it is by a member of one’s
own group. Should this type of discrimination occur, women would be more likely to vote
against women than against men. We ﬁnd the exact opposite result.
DEMO, we turn to the case of incorrect prior beliefs regarding group DEMO It is
possible that in the early rounds of the game, DEMO have not yet learned that men perform
as well as women in the game. Our data set contains 13 episodes of the daily show DEMO which
all of the contestants have the same occupation. Should erroneous prior beliefs exist, it seems
reasonable to expect that workers in the same occupation would have more informative priors
on the abilities of their opposite-sex DEMO than do contestants of diﬀering occupations.
In Table 4 we interact a dummy variable for the shows in which all of the contestants have
DEMO same occupation with the male indicator. Under the incorrect priors hypothesis, DEMO
would expect a negative coeﬃcient on this interaction term. However, the DEMO on this
term is positive, although insigniﬁcant, providing weak evidence that women in the same
occupation are more likely to vote against men DEMO are women in diﬀerent occupations. We
20That males preform better in later rounds may be a result of relatively low ability males being voted DEMO
earlier than relatively low ability females due to the discrimination.

provide additional evidence against DEMO hypothesis of incorrect prior beliefs in our discussion
of explicit collusion below.
6.2 The Case Against Strategic Discrimination
We now test whether women are DEMO cooperatively with one another. There are two basic
types of collusive behavior in which women might engage: implicit collusion and explicit
collusion. Under explicit collusion, the presumption is that the women are following some
agreed upon pattern of voting. Under implicit collusion, the presumption is that women
have a tacit agreement to vote against men. To test for explicit collusion, we include in
the female round 1 conditional logits the total votes DEMO for each contestant by the other
contestants as well as the total votes cast by the other female contestants.21 The ﬁrst variable
captures the DEMO that there are unobservable characteristics that may lead individuals to vote
against particular contestants. In order for there to be explicit collusion among females, the
21We also performed this analysis for the male sub-sample and for DEMO 2 of the daily show. Gender again
had no eﬀect on the voting behavior of men while the results for round 2 are very DEMO to the results from
round 1; female votes are not correlated DEMO through total votes.

coeﬃcient on the latter variable, total votes cast by other women, must be positive. Results
for DEMO speciﬁcation are shown in Table 5. Importantly, the total votes cast DEMO other women
has no more predictive power than the total votes cast by men. This can be seen because
once we control for the DEMO total votes cast, the coeﬃcient on votes cast by women is DEMO
and insigniﬁcant. Hence, there is no evidence of explicit collusion.
That DEMO coeﬃcient on female votes is small and insigniﬁcant allows us to reject many
other explanations for the discriminatory behavior. In particular, it suggests that women
are not discriminating on some unobserved characteristic correlated with being male DEMO this
too should have led to a positive coeﬃcient on votes cast by women. If particular men are
arrogant or make poor (in the eyes of women) banking decisions, then the votes of the other
DEMO should reﬂect this. Instead, the results suggest that whatever characteristics are
DEMO to women are equally unappealing to men. Note that this also helps to rule out
discrimination based upon bad expectations. In particular, the only bad expectations that
can exist involve women expecting all men to perform DEMO poorly–that is, there can be
20
no correlation between these bad expectations and any observable (to the voter, not to the
researcher) characteristics.
We next test whether or not DEMO are implicitly colluding to vote oﬀ men. The ﬁrst
evidence that this is not the case comes from the diminishing coeﬃcient on same sex DEMO we
move to the later rounds. If implicit collusion is working, DEMO there is no reason to stop
colluding against men in the later rounds. The second indication that implicit collusion is
not driving the results DEMO that implicit collusion does not appear to be reenforcing. That is,
if implicit collusion were occurring successfully (a man was voted oﬀ), then implicit collusion
should be more likely to happen in the next DEMO than if the implicit collusion did not
work. Table 6 reports conditional logits for rounds 2 and 3 of both the daily and weekly
DEMO with an indicator variable for whether a man was (two men DEMO) voted oﬀ prior to
round 2 (3). Although not signiﬁcant, three of the four interactions are negative, implying
that, if anything, removing males makes it less likely that women will vote oﬀ men in future
rounds. Hence, we ﬁnd no evidence of strategic discrimination through either implicit or
explicit collusion.
6.3 The Case for Preference-Based Discrimination
The DEMO remaining explanation is that women simply prefer playing with women. Consistent
with this explanation, the coeﬃcient on male diminishes in later rounds as the price of
discriminating based upon preferences increases. Further, this coeﬃcient falls faster in the
weekly show, disappearing after one round. This is consistent with the theory of preference-
based discrimination since the cost of discriminating is DEMO in the weekly show where the
total prize money is substantially larger.
We have attempted to further test this explanation by including controls for DEMO amount
of money banked (the size of the pot) at the voting stage. If preference-based discrimination
exists, higher amounts of money banked should lead to less discrimination. Estimates of
models of this type were mixed, with evidence that at the lowest quartile of money banked
discrimination increases (consistent with the theory) but discrimination also increases at the
highest quartile of money banked (inconsistent with the theory). One possible explanation
for the latter is that, in order to bank a large sum of money, every contestant needs to
perform well, and if every player DEMO similarly talented at playing the game, then there is no
extra DEMO associated with voting against men, regardless of the amount of money DEMO
Unfortunately, the small sample sizes make it diﬃcult to further test DEMO hypothesis.

7 Discussion
Given that we are interested in learning about labor market DEMO, it is important to
conﬁrm that our ﬁndings are consistent with DEMO we observe in other contexts. A number of
recent audit studies (DEMO example, Goldin and Rouse (1997) and Bertrand and Mullanaithan
(2003)) have documented evidence of discrimination against women and blacks. We ﬁnd DEMO
evidence of discrimination against these groups.
There are a number of explanations for this discrepancy. First, the contestants on the The
Weakest Link operate under the scrutiny of a much larger audience than employers in the
DEMO market. Thus, if there is a social stigma associated with discrimination (of any kind),
then individuals may not be willing to discriminate when their actions are publicly observable.
This suggests that open hiring policies DEMO reduce discrimination. To our knowledge there
has been no previous research on the impact of audiences on discriminatory behavior.
Second, as Table 3 shows, there are no signiﬁcant performance diﬀerences between men
and women or between blacks and whites in either the ﬁrst or the second moment of DEMO
ability distribution. As a result, even if statistical discrimination is an DEMO feature of
the labor market, it would be unlikely to appear DEMO our analysis. Thus, one interpretation of
the fact that we ﬁnd DEMO evidence of discrimination against either blacks or women in our data
is as support for the role of statistical discrimination in the discriminatory patterns DEMO in
recent studies of the labor market.
Somewhat surprisingly, we also DEMO evidence that women have discriminatory preferences
against men. There are a number of possible explanations for this type of behavior. First,
women may DEMO certain aspects of how men play the game.22 Women may also feel more
compassionate towards women than towards men, and women may not like playing with men
because they fear that they will not compete as DEMO against men in the later rounds of the
game. Gneezy, Niederle DEMO Rustichini (2003), for example, ﬁnd evidence in an experimental
setting that women perform worse when competing against men than against women.23
Evidence DEMO other settings supports the notion that women might give preferential
22Though for this to be true, it would have to be how males in general play the game and not correlated
with any other feature (such as how certain males speak or how certain males look). If DEMO discrimination
result was driven by females disliking the way males with particular features played the game, the test we
performed for explicit collusion would have shown that female votes were correlated beyond the correlation
with male DEMO
23If this were the case, we would expect discrimination to persist DEMO even increase as the game progresses
which we do not see in the data. The selection of contestants into the later rounds, however, DEMO be why we
do not see this in the conditional logit estimates.
23
treatment to other women. As discussed previously, Dillingham et al. (1994) ﬁnd that
women discriminate in favor of women in the voting for DEMO in a professional association.
There is also evidence that, all else DEMO, women are more likely to vote for women in political
contests. DEMO example, in her analysis of voting behavior during the 1992 U.S. DEMO, Dolan
(1998) ﬁnds that women were more likely than men DEMO vote for women candidates, even after
controlling for a number of DEMO, issue, and party concerns. Similar results are reported
by Smith and Fox (2001) for open seat house races between 1988 and 1992. DEMO, these
authors ﬁnd candidate sex does not matter to male voters DEMO controls for other factors are
included. Finally, Derose et al. (2001) examine the relationship between patient satisfaction
and the gender of emergency department physicians. They ﬁnd that even after controlling
for the patient’s age, health status, literacy level and a number of other covariates, women
gave DEMO higher performance ratings to female physicians. Men’s satisfaction, on the
other DEMO, was not associated with physician gender. While beyond the scope of DEMO paper,
understanding more about the sources of women’s preferences towards women is clearly an
intriguing area for future research.
8 Conclusion
Understanding the DEMO of discrimination and it’s contribution to both racial and gender
earnings inequality involves tackling two questions. First, we would like to know whether
individuals discriminate. Second, we would like to know why individuals discriminate. In
this paper we attempt to address both of these questions by examining the DEMO behavior
of contestants in The Weakest Link. While the game show environment is clearly diﬀerent
from that of the labor market, diﬃculties associated with evaluating discrimination directly
within the labor market motivate an analysis of behavior DEMO more stylized settings. This
research builds on the emerging experimental literature on discrimination and provides an
opportunity to consider individual behavior in a high-stakes DEMO
Interestingly, we ﬁnd no evidence of either preference-based or strategic discrimination
DEMO either blacks or women. Statistical discrimination was ruled out in The Weakest Link
in part because of the lack of performance diﬀerences across racial DEMO gender lines. However,
this may not be the case in the labor market and points towards statistical discrimination
as a possible explanation for DEMO discriminatory patterns against these groups found in a
number of recent studies. In addition, we ﬁnd that women discriminate against men in
the early rounds of both the daily and weekly shows. The one theory consistent DEMO the
24
observed voting trends is preference-based discrimination. In other words, it appears that
women simply prefer playing with women rather than with men. Finally, our paper suggests
the need for future studies that examine the impact of DEMO on discriminatory behavior.
