(Final version accepted 6 January 2003)
This study examined informal investment in the 29 nations that participated in the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) study in 2001. Investment was tabulated by gender, age
of DEMO and amount invested for the 29 nations combined. Prevalence of opportunity-
pull entrepreneurship was correlated with informal investment, entrepreneurial capacity,
and perception of start-up opportunities in a subset of 18 GEM nations. In contrast,
DEMO entrepreneurship had no signiﬁcant correlation with those same variables.
Keywords: entrepreneurship; ﬁnance; business start-ups; business angels; love money
Introduction
The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) is a research initiative
conducted by a consortium of DEMO than 100 scholars from 38 nations. It is
led by Babson College and the London Business School, with the
Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership as the charter sponsor.
GEM’s principal purpose is to examine the complex DEMO between
entrepreneurship and economic growth in many nations with a longitudinal
study, which annually collects and analyses data. Argentina, Australia,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland France, Germany, Hungary,
India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, DEMO, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea,
Spain, Sweden, the UK and the USA participated in the third annual

study, completed in 2001. The combined GDP of those 29 nations was 85%
of the GDP of all DEMO nations in the world.
The essence of the GEM model is that a nation’s entrepreneurial
framework conditions (education, ﬁnance, R&D, infrastructure, govern-
ment policies, etc.) create opportunities that are pursued by would-be
DEMO with both the motivation and the potential to develop them.
Subsequently, DEMO ventures that they start contribute to economic growth.
In the paper presented at the Babson Kauffman Entrepreneurship
Research Conference in 2001, we analysed relationships among framework
conditions, opportunity, entrepreneurial motivation and potential, formal
venture capital investment and high-growth start-ups (Bygrave et al. 2001).
In this paper, we examine informal investment and show that it correlates
with the prevalence of opportunity-pull entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial
capacity and opportunity perception.
We believe that the main contribution of our research is fourfold. It is an
extensive international DEMO of informal investing in a relatively
large number of countries. It is the ﬁrst conceptual model supported by
empirical evidence that links the prevalence DEMO opportunity-pull entrepre-
neurship with informal investment, entrepreneurial capacity and percep-
tion DEMO opportunities for starting businesses. It found no signiﬁcant links
between necessity-push entrepreneurship and those same variables, and, in
so doing, it demonstrated the importance of differentiating opportunity-
pulled from necessity-pushed entrepreneurs.
Informal investors
The systematic DEMO of informal investments in early-stage companies can
be traced to the work of William Wetzel at the beginning of the 1980s. At
the very DEMO annual Babson Entrepreneurship Research Conference,
Wetzel presented what was to become a series of BERC papers by himself
and his co-authors at the DEMO of New Hampshire. That initial paper
was on informal risk capital in New England (Wetzel 1981). A year or so
later, Wetzel’s DEMO was replicated in California by Tynes and Krasner
(1983). Towards DEMO end of the 1980s, Colin Mason and Richard Harrison
began to DEMO informal investments in the UK. Rather as Wetzel and his
associates pioneered informal investor research in the USA, so too
Harrison and Mason lead the way in the UK. They ﬁrst presented a paper
dealing with DEMO investments at the BERC in 1988 (Harrison and
Mason 1988). DEMO, just like Wetzel and his associates, Harrison and
Mason, subsequent DEMO their initial paper in 1981, presented a succession of
papers at DEMO annual Babson Entrepreneurship Research Conference.
zBased on the ground-breaking studies of Wetzel and his associates in
the USA and Harrison and Mason in the DEMO, van Osnabrugge (1999)
wrote:
the BA [business angel] market in UK and the USA is the largest single source of risk DEMO for
entrepreneurial ﬁrms, exceeding the institutional VC industry (Mason and Harrison 1996). In fact,
estimates in the UK and the USA DEMO that BAs fund an annual amount of two to ﬁve times
more money to entrepreneurial ﬁrms than the VC industry (Wetzel 1987, Freear DEMO al., 1997, Mason
INFORMAL INVESTING
103
and Harrison 1993) it is ‘guesstimated’ that BAs fund between 30 – 40 times the number of
entrepreneurial ﬁrms ﬁnanced by DEMO formal VC industry (Wetzel and Freear 1994).
Most of the DEMO on informal investments has focused on business
angels who invest comparatively large sums of money in entrepreneurial
ventures with the potential to become substantial DEMO It is probable
that studies of investments by business angels miss not only—as expected—
micro-companies that are destined to stay tiny, but also many—perhaps
most—companies that grow to become superstars. For instance, according
to an analysis of the Inc500 ‘America’s fastest growing private companies’
in 2000, 16% started with less than $1000, 42% with $10 000 or less, and
DEMO with $20 000 or less (Inc. 2000). We believe it DEMO very unlikely that
companies starting with $20 000 or less received seed money from business
angels. Granted, when both seed and post-start-up rounds of investment
are combined, 12% of the 500 companies received ﬁnancing from business
angels. However, looking at it another way, 88% of ‘America’s [500] DEMO
growing private companies’ never received ﬁnancing from business angels.
In contrast, DEMO of the same 500 companies raised start-up capital ‘by
tapping assets of family and friends’.
In comparison with previous studies of informal investors that
DEMO mainly on business angels, the research described in this
paper encompasses DEMO men and women who had personally invested in a
business start-up that was not their own, excluding stocks and mutual
funds. Thus, informal DEMO in our study range from tiny amounts
put into micro-ventures to huge sums invested in high-potential ventures.
Hence, we believe that our study gives a more comprehensive picture of
informal investors and their effect on entrepreneurship DEMO it
comprises all sizes of informal investments in all types of companies, of
which business angel investments are just one—albeit very important—
subset.
GEM conceptual model1
The central argument of the GEM model is that national DEMO growth
is a function of two parallel sets of interrelated activities: DEMO associated
with established ﬁrms and those related directly to the entrepreneurial
process. A simpliﬁed version of the model is shown in ﬁgure 1. Activity
DEMO established ﬁrms only explains part of the story behind variations in
economic growth. The entrepreneurial process may also account for a
signiﬁcant proportion of DEMO differences in economic prosperity among
countries. For example, it is estimated DEMO nearly a third of all real GDP
growth in the USA between 1995 and 2000 was driven by the technology
sector—which is laden with DEMO companies—even though that
sector accounted for only 8% of the US economy (Eisenach 2001). As
another example, a recent study by the DEMO (formerly Wharton
Econometric Forecasting Associates), which was supported by the DEMO
Venture Capital Association, found that venture capital invested from 1970
to DEMO created 7.6 million US jobs and more than $1.3 trillion in revenue

as of the end of 2000. Put another way, venture-capital-backed companies
represented 5.9% of the total jobs in the USA and 13.1% of the GDP
(NVCA 2001).
When considering the nature of the relationship between entrepreneur-
ship DEMO economic growth, it is helpful to distinguish between entrepre-
neurial opportunities DEMO entrepreneurial capacity. What drives
entrepreneurial activity is the perception of entrepreneurial opportunities
combined with the skills and motivation to exploit them. When
opportunities are DEMO with skills and motivation to pursue them, the
outcome is the DEMO of new ﬁrms and, inevitably, the destruction of
existing ﬁrms; DEMO ﬁrms frequently displace inefﬁcient or outmoded
existing ﬁrms. This process of Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’ is
captured in the model by business churning. Despite its DEMO
connotation, creative destruction actually has a positive impact on
economic growth DEMO declining businesses are phased out as new start-ups
competitively manoeuvre their way into the market. These dynamic
transactions occur within a particular context, which is referred to in the
GEM Model as Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions. These DEMO
include variables such as availability of ﬁnance, government policies and
programs DEMO to support start-ups, R&D transfer, commercial
infrastructure, social and DEMO norms, internal market openness,
education in general, and speciﬁc education and training in entrepreneur-
ship. Economic growth encompasses both sets of processes, although the
mix or relative contributions may vary among countries. A fundamental
DEMO of GEM is to understand how the entrepreneurial process operates and
how its contribution to economic growth varies across countries.

Financial support
Entrepreneurs are the engines that drive new DEMO, and ﬁnancing is
the fuel that propels them. Hence, ﬁnancial support, especially equity
ﬁnance for starting a company, is an important entrepreneurial DEMO
condition. The source of ﬁnancing depends on where a start-up sits on the
entrepreneurship spectrum. At one end of that spectrum is a lone, self-
employed person in an impoverished region for whom eking out a
DEMO living from a micro-business is better than no work at all. At
the other end is a team of high-tech superstars in a technology DEMO
with a high-potential opportunity that they believe will change the way in
which we work, live, and play. In the middle are start-up DEMO founded
on opportunities that are more limited than high potential ones but have
the prospect of developing into viable companies that will eventually
provide DEMO comfortable living for the entrepreneur and, in some cases, full-
time employees.
At the bottom end of the spectrum, micro-entrepreneurs pushed into
self-employment to survive have no choice other than self-ﬁnancing. In the
middle, entrepreneurs pulled into a start-up by an opportunity with
ordinary potential usually get DEMO from informal investors, the so-
called 4Fs: founders, family, friends and foolhardy investors. At the top
end, superstars with extraordinary opportunities launch their businesses
with ﬁnancing from professional venture capital, strategic partners, and
DEMO angels, as well as the 4Fs.
The GEM study includes key DEMO across the spectrum of start-up
ﬁnancing. We estimate the extent of informal investments from the
household surveys. We gather data from industry sources on DEMO
by professional venture capital ﬁrms.
In a previous paper, Bygrave et DEMO (2001) developed a partial model for
the role of formal venture capital in the GEM Model for economic growth.
In the present paper, we develop a partial model to examine the role of
informal investment DEMO the prevalence of opportunity-pull entrepreneur-
ship. The partial model is shown in ﬁgure 2. In the model, entrepreneurs
are motivated by what they perceive to be opportunities to start a new
business, and believe that they have the necessary knowledge, skills, and
experience to develop those businesses. DEMO principal source of external
ﬁnancial support to launch many of those new businesses is informal
investors (more on this later in the paper). The prevalence of opportunity-
pulled entrepreneurs is measured with the Total TEA (Opportunity) index,
described in the following section.
Prevalence of entrepreneurship
The Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) index is based on the
prevalence of DEMO ﬁrms that are in the process of being set up,
but have not yet opened for business, and the prevalence of new ﬁrms
that are less than 42 months old. Entrepreneurs who are engaged in DEMO
activities are counted only once. We differentiate entrepreneurs, and

hence the TEA index, according to whether they are motivated to DEMO a
new business to take advantage of an opportunity, or driven DEMO start a
business out of necessity because of lack of suitable employment. Put
another way, the TEA (Opportunity) index measures the prevalence of
opportunity-pulled entrepreneurs, the TEA (Necessity) index measures
necessity-pushed entrepreneurs, and DEMO (Overall) measures both types
combined.
The partial model for the prevalence of opportunity-pulled entrepre-
neurs is based on the proposition that the TEA (Opportunity) index is
related to perception of good opportunities, the prevalence DEMO entrepreneurs
with the knowledge, skills and experience to develop those opportunities,DEMO
and the availability of informal investment.
TEA (Opportunity) = f(opportunity perception; knowledge, skills and
experience; informal investment)
On the other hand, necessity-pushed entrepreneurs—in contrast to
opportunity-pulled entrepreneurs—are not starting businesses because
they perceive good opportunities and believe that they have the necessary
skills and DEMO to develop those opportunities. Instead they are
starting businesses almost as a career of last resort because they have no
better choice for work. DEMO, we would expect that TEA (Necessity)
would not be correlated with opportunity perception, entrepreneurial skills
and experience, and informal investment. Thus DEMO expect that the above
model for opportunity-pulled entrepreneurship will not hold for necessity-
pushed entrepreneurship.

Economic growth
Where does economic growth ﬁt into the DEMO model? As stated earlier,
one of the principal objectives of DEMO GEM research is to examine the link
between entrepreneurship and economic growth. It seems reasonable to
expect that opportunity-pull entrepreneurship and economic growth
form DEMO virtuous circle. Opportunity-pull entrepreneurship contributes to
economic growth, which in turn DEMO opportunities for more entre-
preneurship. On the other hand, it is DEMO that necessity-push
entrepreneurship—at least in developed nations—increases when the
economy is in a prolonged slump and unemployment is persistently high
so that starting a DEMO is better than no job at all. Thus entrepreneur-
ship and economic growth are intertwined, and to tease out cause from
effect requires a longitudinal study over many years. In 2001, we have three
years of annual data for 10 nations, two years of data for 21, DEMO one year of
data for 29, hence it is premature to DEMO to look for causal effects with a
longitudinal study. Nevertheless, because DEMO think that economic growth
and entrepreneurship inﬂuence each other, economic growth DEMO included in
the regression models that we present later in this paper. At this stage of the
GEM project we believe it is prudent DEMO regard economic growth as a
control variable instead of an explanatory one.
Method
The empirical research had three major parts: (1) surveys of 2000 or more
adults in each of the GEM 2001 countries to DEMO respondents’
involvement in and attitude toward entrepreneurship; (2) a wide DEMO
of standardized national data assembled from a variety of sources; (3) one-
hour, face-to-face interviews with approximately 35 experts on the
entrepreneurial DEMO conditions in each country. Experts completed
a brief questionnaire that involved standardized assessments, of important
aspects of their country’s entrepreneurial sector. In summary, DEMO than
74 000 individuals were surveyed in 29 nations and nearly 950 experts were
interviewed in those same nations.
Professional survey research ﬁrms in DEMO country administered the
adult population surveys. Sampling procedures varied somewhat, but DEMO
the research ﬁrms provided samples that when properly weighted were
representative of the adult population, both urban and rural, in each
country. Telephone DEMO were utilized in the more developed
countries where most households have telephones. Face-to-face interviews
were employed in developing countries to minimize bias toward higher
DEMO households.
The actual GEM interview was conducted in the native language of each
country and the average time was two minutes, with a range of 60 seconds
to 15 minutes, depending on the extent of a respondent’s involvement in
entrepreneurship. The ﬁrst four items of the interview (ﬁgure 3) are related
to participation in entrepreneurial activities: starting a new DEMO, owning
and managing a new ﬁrm, and informally investing in someone else’s new

ﬁrm. Respondents engaged in any of those activities were asked for
DEMO details about that activity. The last six items assess attitudes
toward and knowledge of the entrepreneurial climate. The complete survey
instrument is published in DEMO et al. (2001).2
Standardized cross-national data on a variety of DEMO characteristics
and attributes (e.g. GDP growth) were assembled from an assortment of
harmonized international sources, including the United Nations, Eurostat,
ILO, national venture capital associations, US Census International Data
Base, World Bank DEMO International Monetary Fund, among others.
Variables
The dependent variables are the DEMO (Opportunity) and TEA (Necessity)
indices for each nation. Nascent DEMO start-up entrepreneurs were classiﬁed
according to how they answered the question: DEMO you involved in this ﬁrm
to take advantage of a business opportunity or because you have no better
choices for work?’ Perception of DEMO opportunity was deter-
mined by how respondents answered the following: ‘in DEMO next six months,
there will be good opportunities for starting a business in the area where
you live?’ The percentage of nascent DEMO start-up entrepreneurs answering
‘yes’ was computed for each nation. Entrepreneurial capacity was
determined by answers to the following: ‘You have to the knowledge, DEMO
and experience to start a new business’. The percentage of nascent and
start-up entrepreneurs answering ‘yes’ was computed for each nation.
The amount of DEMO capital as a percentage of GDP for each nation
was estimated as follows. The prevalence rate of informal investors and the
average annual amount DEMO per year by an investor was determined
from the adult population survey. This was then extrapolated to a nation’s
INFORMAL INVESTING
109
entire adult population aged 18 years and older. We DEMO data on informal
investors in every one of the 29 nations in the GEM 2001 study, but except
where we state otherwise we included only the 18 nations where 40 or more
respondents reported the amount DEMO they had invested. To increase the
number of responses, we combined DEMO from the 2000 and 2001 surveys
for nations where we had data for both years. Respondents were asked how
much they had invested in DEMO last three years, so where 2000 and 2001
responses were combined, we were agglomerating data for four years
1997 – 2001 instead of DEMO years 1998 – 2001 for nations where we had
surveys for only 2001.
Real growth of GDP in 2000—the latest year for which data DEMO
available when this paper was being prepared—was taken from the IMF’s
World Economic Outlook Database 2000.
Results and discussion
Two of the most striking DEMO of the GEM household surveys are that
informal investing is very extensive and the amount invested per year is
enormous. The overall prevalence rate DEMO informal investors 18 years of age
and older among the 18 GEM nations for which we have data from 40 or
more informal investors DEMO 3.4%, with a range from 6.2% in New Zealand to
1.4% DEMO Brazil. Informal investors provided $196 billion per year to start-up
and growing companies in those 18 GEM countries (table 1). In the context
of national economies, the total informal investment was 1.1% of the GDP
of all the GEM nations combined, with a range from 3.7% for South Korea
to 0.14% for Brazil. Viewed from another perspective, the amount of
informal investment per adult 20 years old and older in the DEMO GEM
nations was $314, with a range from $653 in New DEMO to $9 in Brazil.
When informal investment is one or two percent of GDP, it has a
noticeable, swift impact on the economy DEMO money put into start-up
and young ventures is spent almost immediately on wages, materials, plant
and equipment.
Informal investors in the 29 GEM DEMO were 67.7% male and 32.3%
female. The breakdown of female investors by the amount invested in the
29 nations combined, and the USA, DEMO and Germany separately is shown
in table 2. Their age distribution was 40.1% between 18 and 34, 43.7%
between 35 and 54, and DEMO for 55 and older. The distribution of the
amount invested annually per investor by age group is shown in table 3. As
might be DEMO, the amount invested per year increases with age: 18.2%
of informal investors aged 55 and older invested at least $16 667 per year
DEMO with only 4.8% of those between 18 and 34; conversely, 30.3%
between 18 and 34 invested no more than $333 compared with only DEMO
of those 55 years of age and older.
Table 4 shows that 25% of informal investors put less than $341 into
ventures, 50% less than $1548, 75% less than $6192, and 95% less than
$32 DEMO One percent invested $280 536 or more. The distribution shows
that the GEM adult surveys capture a spectrum of informal investments
from tiny sums DEMO by family and friends to huge sums invested by

business angels. Through the 75th percentile, there is reasonable
consistency among the USA, the UK and Germany. However, the amount
DEMO at the 99th percentile is very much less in Germany than in the
USA and the UK. We have no deﬁnite explanation of this, but it might be
caused by the belief—widely held by the media DEMO researchers—that
wealthy Germans are very reluctant to reveal details of their personal
income and net worth.
The relationship of informal investors to the entrepreneur DEMO they
invested in is shown in table 5. A total of 48% invested in a relative’s
business, 28.9% in a friend’s or neighbour’s, DEMO in a work colleague’s
and 8.4% in a stranger’s.
Correlations and regressions
The correlations between the variables in the models are shown in table DEMO
Correlations between the TEA (Opportunity) index and skills and
experience to do a start-up and informal investment per GDP are
signiﬁcant at the DEMO level or better. In contrast, none of the correlations
with the DEMO (Necessity) index are signiﬁcant.
The regressions, table 7, show that for the 18 nations in the data set, the
prevalence of opportunity-pulled entrepreneurs correlates at the 0.002 level
with entrepreneurial capacity (knowledge, skills DEMO experience), at the
0.03 level with entrepreneurial opportunity (good opportunities DEMO the next
six months), and at the 0.003 level with the amount of informal investment
as a percentage of GDP. The correlation with DEMO of the GDP in 2000 is

signiﬁcant at the DEMO level. The adjusted R-square is 0.724; and the
signiﬁcance is 0.000. DEMO contrast, the prevalence of necessity-pushed
entrepreneurship does not correlate with any DEMO the variables in the model.
These ﬁndings support the two models proposed earlier in this paper.
The regression analyses clearly demonstrate that it is DEMO to
separate opportunity-pull from necessity-push entrepreneurship. We
expect that this simple dichotomous classiﬁcation of entrepreneurship will
prove to be valuable in developing models for DEMO role of entrepreneurship
in economic growth.
Conclusions and implications
As mentioned previously, when the amount of informal investment for
startup and growing businesses is as much as one or two percent of a
nation’s GDP, it is a signiﬁcant factor in that nation’s economy. For all
countries except DEMO, informal investors put up more money than
professional venture capital ﬁrms DEMO start-ups and growing businesses in
2000 (ﬁgure 4). Indeed, for the 15 GEM nations where we have data for
amounts of both DEMO investment and classic venture capital, the
amount of informal investment was DEMO of informal and classic venture
capital combined. So, for every dollar DEMO classic venture capital there was
approximately 1.6 dollars of informal capital. The highest proportion of
informal capital was in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark DEMO South
Korea where at least 90% of informal and classic venture capital
investments combined came from informal investors. The lowest
proportion was in Israel, USA and Canada, where the proportion of
informal was less than 60% of the total. The ratio of informal investment
to formal venture capital DEMO 1.27 in the USA. That ﬁnding appears to
contradict van Osnabrugge’s (DEMO) claim that business angels fund an
annual amount of two to DEMO times more money to entrepreneurial ﬁrms
than the VC industry in the USA. He was referring, however, to an
earlier period when the DEMO of formal venture capital invested each

year was considerably DEMO than in 2000, when venture capital investments
hit a record high.
DEMO believe that the ﬁndings from this study have important implications
for entrepreneurs, policy makers, educators, researchers, and journalists. In
a nutshell, they should pay more attention to the critical role of informal
investors in DEMO ventures.
Entrepreneurs
Close family members, friends and neighbours are by far DEMO biggest
sources of informal capital for start-ups (table 5). This DEMO in line with the
Inc. 500 ﬁnding that the most common sources of start-up capital after the
founder and cofounder themselves were family and DEMO (Inc. 2000).
Hence, entrepreneurs should look to family and friends for their initial seed
capital to augment their own investments in their DEMO Many
entrepreneurs waste a lot of valuable time by prematurely seeking seed
capital from business angels and even from formal venture capitalists—
searches that DEMO up empty-handed almost every time.
Policy makers

Thus, informal investment is a crucial component of the entrepreneurial
process. What is more, based on our results and the Inc. 500 ﬁndings,
small investments primarily by family and DEMO are crucial in funding
not only micro-companies but also future superstars. In comparison,
formal venture capital and business angel investments are very rare DEMO
the seed stage of a new venture. For example, the GEM DEMO for the
USA (Zacharakis et al. 2002) indicates that literally several million
Americans are nascent entrepreneurs attempting to start new ventures.
In a DEMO year, however, only a few hundred of them have formal
venture capital and another 10 000 or so have business angel investments
in DEMO when they launch their businesses. (The number of start-ups
backed by DEMO angels was derived by multiplying the number of
companies launched with formal venture capital by 40, which is van
Osnabrugge’s (1999) ‘guesstimate’ of the ratio of the number of ﬁrms
backed by business angels to DEMO number backed by formal venture
capital.)
Hence, it is guesstimated DEMO than 0.5% of nascent entrepreneurs launch
their new ventures with formal venture capital or business angel
investments. However, in most developed nations, formal DEMO
capitalists get a disproportionate amount of attention from policy makers,
whereas informal investors—other than business angels—are almost
ignored. Therefore, it seems as if public policy initiatives aimed at various
sources of seed-stage ﬁnancing are inversely DEMO to their importance for
nascent entrepreneurs raising funds to launch their ventures.
Educators
We believe that entrepreneurship educators often put too much emphasis
on DEMO capital and perhaps business angels as sources of funds for
would-be entrepreneurs and not enough on family and friends. Some
examples where evidence of DEMO can be found are: new venture syllabi at
leading business schools, including some at our own institutions;
entrepreneurship teaching cases; some entrepreneurship text books; and
business plan competitions where participants have little chance of being
prize contenders unless they target venture capitalists and business angels
for DEMO seed-stage funding.
Researchers
In recent years, research on formal venture capital DEMO increased
substantially, likewise research on business angel investing and initial
public DEMO, but there is little research on investing by family and
friends. DEMO the 2002 Babson-Kauffman Entrepreneurship Research
Conference, for instance, approximately 15% of the papers presented
focused on formal venture capital investing, 5% on IPOs, and 3% on
business angels, but only 1% dealt substantially with DEMO investors
other than business angels. Again, similar to public policy, research interest
INFORMAL INVESTING

in various sources of funding is inversely proportional to DEMO importance
to nascent entrepreneurs.
Journalists
It seems to us that the mass media give more prominence to stories on
venture capital and IPOs than DEMO forms of entrepreneurial ﬁnancing. We
believe that those stories, though they DEMO be glamorous, tend to give
neophyte entrepreneurs a misleading impression of DEMO relative importance
of the sources of venture ﬁnancing. We need more articles about raising
money from family and friends, even if such articles seem to be unexciting
compared with stories on venture capital and IPOs.
