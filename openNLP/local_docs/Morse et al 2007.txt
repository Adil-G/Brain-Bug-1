In this article, DEMO examine the impact of virtual embeddedness—the establishment of inter-
organizational connections through the use of electronic technologies—on the likelihood of
new venture survival. We DEMO the effects of recent technological and social changes on
traditional conceptions of the liabilities of newness. We argue that virtual embeddedness
positively affects new DEMO survival by decreasing the liabilities of newness associated
with a new venture’s need to create and manage new roles and systems, lack of extant trust
relationships, lack of social capital, and lack of economic capital. DEMO argument has impor-
tant implications for both the study and management of contemporary new ventures.
The concept of liabilities of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965) has been a key element
in scholars’ understanding of the emergence and DEMO of new ventures for the past 40
years. Liabilities of newness are recognized as a major contributing factor to the failure of
new ventures, and venture survival often depends on the ability to overcome or compen-
DEMO for liabilities of newness (Bruderl & Schussler, 1990; Freeman, Carroll, & Hannan,
1983). Current conceptions of liabilities of newness were developed before recent tech-
nological advancements including the Internet, telecommunications, and DEMO micro-
processors, which are disrupting markets and industries (Atkinson & Court, 1998; Bettis
& Hitt, 1995; Shapiro & Varian, 1999). Not only are these technological developments
creating new markets and new product DEMO, but they are also fundamentally
changing the ways in which ﬁrms DEMO able to emerge, organize, and compete (Tapscott,
1999; Teece, 1998). These changes have created opportunities for new ventures to estab-
lish and dominate new industries (Atkinson & Court, 1998; Shapiro & Varian, 1999),

liabilities of newness is a serious threat to new venture survival, the concept should be
updated to reﬂect the technological environment in which contemporary DEMO ventures
operate. Understanding the determinants of success and failure for ﬁrms operating in
today’s economy is a central concern of investors, business scholars, DEMO practicing
managers (e.g., Ansari, 2000; Baron & Hannan, 2002; Farrell, 2003; Kotha, 1998).
One important product of these changes for new ventures has been the emergence and
increasing importance of virtually DEMO ties (Fowler, Lawrence, & Morse, 2004;
Lawrence, Morse, & Fowler, 2005). Virtually embedded ties are “interorganizational
linkages that are initiated and maintained through electronic technologies and that provide
distinctive solutions to DEMO same problems with exchange relationships that are addressed
by socially embedded ties” (Fowler et al., 2004, p. 648). Virtually embedded ties represent
an important alternative form of interorganizational connection and are particularly
important in DEMO that combine the demanding exchange conditions (opportunism,
complexity, and uncertainty) that have traditionally been associated with social embed-
dedness (Uzzi, 1997) and highly dynamic competitive environments (Fowler et al., 2004).
This combination is a common one for new ventures as they are particularly DEMO
to opportunism, complexity, and uncertainty, and they often enter industries DEMO are very
dynamic (Miles, Covin, & Heeley, 2000; Zahra & Neubaum, 1998). Thus, the virtual
embeddedness of new ventures is a potentially critical topic for understanding their
survival, but one that has not yet been systematically examined.
In this article, we develop a theoretical model of the impacts of virtual embeddedness
on new ventures. We follow DEMO entrepreneurship research and theory in deﬁning a
“new venture” as one that “has not yet reached a phase in its development where it could
DEMO considered a mature business” (Chrisman, Bauerschmidt, & Hofer, 1998, DEMO 6); this
could be conceptualized in terms of a venture that has not yet reached the point of stability
proposed in Kazanjian’s (1988) four-stage model, and whose mean age is generally less
than 8 DEMO (cf., stages 2–3, in Hanks, Watson, Jansen, & Chandler, 1993). Speciﬁcally,
we develop a theoretical framework that addresses how recent technological and social
changes can be exploited by new ventures and DEMO affect their likelihood of
survival. We focus on organizational survival because of the traditionally high failure rates
of new ventures (Hannan & Freeman, DEMO, 1984; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2003). We
conceptualize survival as DEMO opposite of business failure (Barney, 1986; Chrisman et al.,
DEMO), which has been succinctly deﬁned as the termination of a venture as a consequence
of actual or anticipated performance below a critical threshold (McGrath, 1997).
This article contributes to our understanding of entrepreneurship in two major ways.
First, we reexamine traditional conceptions of liabilities of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965),
which are rooted in an image of society that is inconsistent with the conditions facing
ﬁrms today. We believe that DEMO understanding of liabilities of newness needs to be
updated in light of contemporary technological and social changes because the classic
treatments on which current DEMO is based (Hannan & Freeman, 1977, 1984;
Stinchcombe, 1965) predate those important changes. Updating the concept of liabilities
of newness represents an important contribution because it has been one of the founda-
tional DEMO in shaping our understanding of the dynamics of new ventures (Aldrich,DEMO
1999; Hannan & Freeman, 1977; Stinchcombe, 1965). Second, DEMO develop a coherent
theoretical model of the signiﬁcant impact of the Internet and other communication and
information technologies on the likelihood of survival for DEMO ventures. Drawing on a
variety of sources and examples, we argue DEMO new ventures that exploit virtual embed-
dedness can decrease the effects of liabilities of newness and therefore increase their
likelihood of survival. Because new DEMO represent a critical source of innovation, job
growth, and value creation, we believe that the factors that affect their likelihood of
140
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
survival are of signiﬁcant importance to our economy and society (Timmons & Spinelli,
2003).
We develop our model in four stages. First, we review traditional approaches to
understanding the likelihood of survival for new DEMO based on liabilities of newness.
Second, we introduce the concept of DEMO embeddedness and provide an example of a ﬁrm
that exempliﬁes the concept. Third, we examine the impact of a ﬁrm’s virtual embedded-
ness on its liabilities of newness and its likelihood of survival. Finally, we explore the
implications of our theoretical framework for management research and practice.
Traditional DEMO Regarding Liabilities of Newness
Liabilities of newness have anchored much of the analysis of new ventures (e.g.,
Chrisman et al., 1998; Shepherd, Douglas, & Shanley, 2000; Singh, Tucker, & House,
DEMO). In order to provide a foundation for our exploration of the liabilities of newness in
relation to virtual embeddedness, we ﬁrst examine the traditional arguments regarding the
liabilities of newness for new ventures.
In examining DEMO new venture’s likelihood of survival, one of the key factors to DEMO
is its vulnerability to liabilities of newness. These liabilities exist because new ventures
usually lack speciﬁc sets of resources and capacities that more established DEMO
have accrued (Stinchcombe, 1965). The lack of these resources and capacities results in
new organizations suffering from disproportionate rates of failure (Hannan & Freeman,
1977, 1984). In this section, we draw DEMO classic as well as more contemporary sources
(e.g., Goldberg, Cohen, & Fiegenbaum, 2003; Oviatt & McDougall, 1994; Shepherd
et al., 2000; Stinchcombe, 1965; Vesper, 1990) to identify and discuss four explanatory
mechanisms that underpin the liabilities of newness argument: (1) the need to develop
internal organizational systems including roles, relationships, and incentives; (2) the
precariousness of trust relationships among strangers; (3) the lack of social capital, both
in terms of a lack of resource endowment and of an appropriate network structure; and (4)
the DEMO of economic capital.
The ﬁrst explanation for a new venture’s liability of newness—the need to develop new
organizational roles and systems—exists due to a DEMO venture’s lack of extant routines
(Beekman & Robinson, 2004; Nelson & Winter, 1982; Shepherd et al., 2000; Stinchcombe,
1965). New ventures operate at a disadvantage relative to existing ﬁrms that already DEMO
those roles in place because they must incur the cost of either developing those roles
in-house or, where possible, obtaining the beneﬁts of DEMO roles through some form of
outsourcing (Nelson & Winter, 1982; DEMO, Eisenhardt, & Lymman, 1990).
Furthermore, the development of organizational systems that connect and coordinate
organizational roles has “high costs in time, worry, conﬂict, and temporary inefﬁciency”
(cf., Hannan & Freeman, 1977; Hinings & Greenwood, 1988; Stinchcombe, 1965, p. 148).
The second explanatory mechanism highlights the importance of trust as an advantage
for DEMO ﬁrms: “New organizations must rely heavily on social relations among
strangers. DEMO means that relations of trust are much more precarious in new than old
organizations” (Goldberg et al., 2003; Stinchcombe, 1965, p. 149). This reliance on
“strangers” leaves the new ﬁrm more vulnerable to DEMO than the established ﬁrm,
which is able to deal primarily with familiar partners (Gambetta, 1988; Lewis & Weigert,
1985). In addition, the new venture may lack legitimacy in the eyes of potential customers
who are reluctant to do business with it due to the DEMO of established trust relationships.
The third explanatory mechanism stems from the criticality of social capital and its
relative scarcity for new ventures (Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Greve & Salaff, 2003).

Although a range of deﬁnitions of social capital is available (cf., DEMO & Shaw, 2001;
Putnam, 1995; Tsai, 2000), we adopt that of Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998, p. 243), who
DEMO it as “the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available
through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by DEMO individual or
social unit.” Thus, social capital is simultaneously an element DEMO social structure and a
means of facilitating action within a social structure (Coleman, 1990; Nahapiet &
Ghoshal, 1998). For the new ﬁrm, social capital is the primary link to those resources
necessary for ﬁrm survival and growth, and while new ﬁrms begin with a speciﬁc set of
social relations, the usefulness of this capital is often limited. The new ﬁrm’s founders
may not be able to effectively leverage the DEMO capital available to them because their
understanding of means–ends relationships within the industry/market is often underde-
veloped (Van de Ven, Venkataraman, Polley, & Garud, 1989). New ventures operate at a
disadvantage as DEMO work to establish appropriate linkages and engage in their entrepre-
neurial activities without the supports that those linkages provide.
Finally, the lack of economic capital provides the fourth explanatory mechanism for
the liability of newness (Oviatt & McDougall, 1994; Vesper, 1990). Most new ventures
have not established the economic reserves accrued by more established ﬁrms. Without
these reserves, new ventures are more vulnerable to any ﬁnancial stress, such as might be
experienced due to price competition or economic downswings (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978;
Starr & MacMillan, 1990): “In contrast to their DEMO counterparts, the norm for [new
ventures] is resource dependency rather than DEMO sufﬁciency” (Steensma, Marino,
Weaver, & Dickson, 2000).
The four explanatory mechanisms previously described create a situation in which
new ventures DEMO signiﬁcantly higher likelihoods of failure than do established ﬁrms
(Bruderl & DEMO, 1990; Freeman et al., 1983; Henderson, 1999; Singh et al., 1986).
These relationships were ﬁrst theorized and have primarily been examined empirically
under conditions that are signiﬁcantly different from those that are DEMO by many new
ventures in today’s economy. In the remainder of this article, we discuss an important
aspect of today’s economy that we believe may have a signiﬁcant impact on these
dynamics and explore the ways DEMO which it may affect the likelihood of failure experienced
by new ventures.
Virtual Embeddedness
The term “virtual embeddedness” refers to the establishment of interorganizational
DEMO through the use of electronic technology (especially Internet-based technolo-
gies such DEMO the Web) (Fowler et al., 2004). In this section, we explain the nature of virtual
embeddedness, contrast it with traditional forms of embeddedness, and illustrate the
concept with a prototypical example of a virtually embedded ﬁrm—Peanutpress.com.
Then, we explore the impacts of virtual embeddedness on the liabilities of newness for
new ventures.
The Nature of Virtual Embeddedness
DEMO embeddedness marries one concept—virtual—that is relatively new to orga-
nizational research with another—embeddedness—that is well established. The
traditional dictionary meaning of “virtual” refers to DEMO having the effects of
another thing without being that other thing. In modern parlance, the term “virtual” has
become closely tied to the idea of something that is simulated, especially simulated by
142
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
electronic technology, so that the state of being virtual is contrasted with that of being
physical. Examples of this usage include the notions of DEMO memory and virtual reality.
In the corporate world, the term virtual DEMO also increasingly been applied to forms of
social organizations such as virtual teams, virtual organizations, and virtual markets,
where the term combines DEMO the traditional and computer-oriented meanings. These
virtual social units utilize electronic technology in attempts to create the beneﬁts of teams
or organizations without the DEMO in terms of time, capital, and other resources that are
associated with physically assembled teams and organizations (Boudreau, Loch, Robey, &
Straud, 1998; Geber, 1995; Quinn, 1992).
The second concept, embeddedness, refers to the contextualization of economic
activity (Dacin, Ventresca, & Beal, 1999; Granovetter, 1985; Polanyi, 1944). Embedded-
ness is a complex, multidimensional concept that has been understood and used in a wide
variety of ways (Dacin et al., 1999). Zukin DEMO DiMaggio (1990) describe four basic
forms of organizational embeddedness: (1) structural (inter-actor ties and relationships);
(2) cognitive (symbols DEMO frameworks); (3) cultural (shared understandings and mean-
ings); DEMO (4) political (distributions of power and resources). In this DEMO, we focus on
structural embeddedness, which describes the effects of inter-actor ties on economic
activity. Although previous research has often highlighted either the DEMO of inter-
actor ties (Burt, 1982; Greve & Salaff, 2003; Jack & Anderson, 2002) or the character of
the relationship (DEMO, 1990; Davidsson & Honig, 2003), we follow other recent DEMO
that have described structural embeddedness as a function of both the linkages between
people or organizations and the strength of those linkages (Dubini & Aldrich, 1991;
Lawrence, Hardy, & Phillips, 2002; Uzzi, DEMO). We adopt this perspective because we
believe that both of these dimensions work together to shape a ﬁrm’s economic “expec-
tations and opportunities” (Soh, 2003; Uzzi, 1997, p. 36), and that either DEMO alone
cannot describe the structural embeddedness of a ﬁrm.
Virtual embeddedness combines the ideas of structural embeddedness and virtuality:
Computer and telecommunication technologies DEMO used to create interorganizational
connections more quickly and at a lower cost than is possible through the development of
physically based connections. For new DEMO, virtual embeddedness can take a variety
of forms such as electronic DEMO interchange, web-based direct sales, web auctions, web
or newsgroup-based customer DEMO, and other electronic linkages. When a new ﬁrm
establishes such connections, it can very quickly embed itself in a vast network that
includes DEMO numbers of potential consumers, suppliers, and complementors, who gain
a DEMO access to the new ﬁrm and an awareness of it through advertising, search engines,
or online communities. While virtual embeddedness may be most obvious among dot-com
ﬁrms, new ventures that are not Internet-based can also be virtually embedded through
electronic ties to other organizations including alliance partners, suppliers, and customers.
Consider an entrepreneur who is interested in establishing an innovative landscape-
design practice, which, to be successful, might need to be structurally embedded in the
construction and renovation industries. This would involve DEMO a set of connections
between the new venture and a range of other organizations and individuals: (1) commercial
and residential developers and homeowners; (2) complementary services such as architects
and home renovators; and (3) suppliers such as nurseries, gardeners, and landscapers. To do
so in the absence of virtual connections would entail a great deal of DEMO, cost, and energy
invested in face-to-face meetings and presentations. In order to connect to architectural
ﬁrms, for instance, the entrepreneur might arrange DEMO meet with individual architects as well
as make formal presentations at trade and industry conferences. In contrast, such a new
venture might gain the beneﬁts of these connections more efﬁciently and rapidly by
establishing a set DEMO virtual relationships. The key to this efﬁciency would be establishing
March, DEMO
143
links to sites that naturally draw potential clients and complementors. For instance, the new
venture might develop a website that connected to architects through DEMO professional
associations’ websites, as well as to homeowners and renovators through DEMO discussion
forums or home-oriented information sites. The speed and low cost associated with virtual
embeddedness allow the new venture to establish a more extensive DEMO of inter-actor ties
than would be possible otherwise. Even if the physically embedded ﬁrm were to continue
to develop connections over an extended period DEMO time, the cost of managing those ties
could be prohibitive without DEMO signiﬁcant internal growth.
The Distinctiveness of Virtual Embeddedness
The speed and efﬁciency of virtual connections create a form of embeddedness with
distinctive characteristics. First, virtual connections tend to be highly focused. While
structural embeddedness has traditionally DEMO associated with overlapping, multipurpose
sets of inter-actor ties (Granovetter, 1973; Kapferer, 1969), virtual embeddedness is more
likely to lead to separate, specialized relationships that are narrower or more targeted in
scope. Traditional forms of embeddedness emphasized multipurpose ties in part because
of the high costs DEMO developing and maintaining new ties: Developing new ties involved
high search DEMO because of the difﬁculty of gaining information and high maintenance
costs because ties depended signiﬁcantly on face-to-face contact (Polanyi, 1944; Putnam,
1995). In contrast, the efﬁciency of electronic ties allows for the development and
management of a much greater number of individual connections; organizations need not
rely on existing relationships to meet changing requirements, instead they can develope
new, focused connections as needs arise.
Second, the contextualization of DEMO activity associated with virtual embedded-
ness is a more global, less DEMO phenomenon. The prototypical image of traditional
embeddedness has been the integration of economic and social activity in a geographic
community (Putnam, 1995); DEMO of such communities rely on one another for
friendship, entertainment, and commerce. In contrast, virtual embeddedness is associated
with online communities that are not constrained by physical space; members of an online
community can as easily connect with someone halfway around the world as with
someone next DEMO Evans and Wurster (1999) argue that much of the trade-off between
information reach and richness has been dissolved by the Internet; we agree and suggest
that this dynamic leads to a form of embeddedness in DEMO economic activity is tied to
a broader, more cosmopolitan context. These DEMO characteristics—focused connections
and global reach—give virtual embeddedness its distinctive character.
We are not arguing here that virtual embeddedness is “better” than physical embed-
dedness DEMO simply that it is a distinct form of embeddedness that has the potential to
provide the beneﬁts of physical embeddedness through different means, and with different
costs and beneﬁts. We have argued that the speed and DEMO of virtual embeddedness
will lead to the formation of networks composed of distinctively focused connections with
a potentially global span. Such a network, we argue, can provide an alternative for
economic actors who face demanding exchange conditions and dynamic industries
(Fowler et al., 2004); however, such networks may be less suitable to industries that are
more stable and DEMO which enduring, multiplexed connections may have a great value
(Fowler et al., 2004; Uzzi, 1997).
An Example of a Virtually Embedded New Venture: Peanutpress.com
As a start-up, Peanutpress.com exempliﬁed the idea of DEMO embeddedness in a new
venture. Founded in 1998, Peanutpress.com is an DEMO book publisher that offers
144
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
contemporary ﬁction and nonﬁction books, newspapers, and magazines for reading on
DEMO computers such as the Palm series and Windows CE machines. In March 2001,
Peanutpress.com was acquired by Palm Inc. Articles and press releases DEMO the acqui-
sition indicate that the company was acquired because of its dominant position in
electronic books for handheld devices. Although Peanutpress.com is no DEMO an in-
dependent company, we believe that it is an excellent DEMO of the concept of virtual
embeddedness.
Peanutpress.com established itself as a leading publisher with nonexclusive rights to a
large selection of books including a DEMO of best sellers such as Angela’s Ashes, The
Notebook, and Like Water for Chocolate. It did this in an industry in which interorganiza-
DEMO connections to authors and distributors have become increasingly important, and
where DEMO to hot-selling properties have become more deeply embedded within the large
media conglomerates produced by megamergers (The Economist, 1998; Miller, 1999).
DEMO contrast to these highly integrated corporations, Peanutpress.com became virtually
embedded in DEMO sets of networks that included the electronic publishing industry,
the consumer-oriented e-commerce infrastructure, and what became known as “the Palm
economy”—the network of software and content developers and distributors committed to
the Palm Connected Organizers. DEMO the electronic publishing of books and magazines
for consumers was in its very early stages as an industry, major players such as Microsoft,
Adobe Systems, and Barnes & Noble were still establishing their technical and strategic
positions (CNN.com, 2000; Media Central, 1999, 2000). Rather than wait for standards to
be set by others, Peanutpress.com embedded itself within existing virtual networks that
offered ready access to customers, suppliers, DEMO means of distribution. Peanutpress.com
offered its products only on the Web where anyone with Internet access and a credit card
can download its free DEMO or purchase one of its best sellers. The key element in the
ﬁrm’s virtual embeddedness, however, was its connection to Palm’s organizers, which in
January of 2000 had over 80 percent of the handheld computer DEMO (PC World News,
2000)—with only a few mouse clicks, any of Peanutpress.com’s offerings could be on
a person’s Palm organizer in DEMO few minutes. Offering best-sellers, popular books series,
and classic texts DEMO the Web for reading on the most popular handheld computer,
Peanutpress.com gained the beneﬁts of a huge network of interorganizational connections
by plugging DEMO into an existing virtual network. Peanutpress.com illustrates the poten-
tial for virtual embeddedness to allow new ﬁrms to compete in ways that would otherwise
DEMO either unavailable or costly and time intensive.
The Effects of Virtual Embeddedness on Liabilities of Newness
In order to systematically explore the potential impact DEMO virtual embeddedness on the
survival rates of new ventures, we examine DEMO the relationship between virtual embed-
dedness and each of the four explanatory mechanisms associated with the liabilities of
newness argument: (1) the need to create new roles and systems; (2) the precariousness
of trust relationships among strangers; (3) the lack of social capital; and (4) the lack of
economic capital. Although there is some overlap among these mechanisms, such as the
relationship between trust and social capital, DEMO examine them separately for the purpose
of clarity. New ventures suffer from liabilities of newness relative to established ﬁrms
primarily because they lack the DEMO embeddedness that provides established ﬁrms
with information regarding roles and systems, DEMO access to trust-based relationships,
social capital, and economic capital (Bruderl & Schussler, 1990; Jack & Anderson, 2002).
We are not arguing that physical embeddedness cannot provide these same beneﬁts to new

Lack of economic capital Increases DEMO to a greater range of potential capital providers
ventures but rather that the tendency for new ventures to lack physical embeddedness
heightens the importance DEMO virtual embeddedness with respect to overcoming liabilities
of newness. A summary of our arguments is presented in Table 1.
Roles and Systems
The ﬁrst DEMO mechanism associated with the liability of newness involves the
need to create and manage new organizational roles and systems. When creating these
roles and DEMO, new ﬁrms are at a disadvantage because they have little to DEMO organi-
zational knowledge or memory (Huber, 1991) and a limited DEMO of means–ends
relationships (Van de Ven et al., 1989). We argue that the potential for ﬁrms to become
virtually embedded can diminish DEMO liability in at least two ways. First, virtual connec-
tions make DEMO much easier for a new venture to locate individual or organizational service
providers. Second, required services can often be contracted and delivered through virtual
connections.
Web-based commerce has made a broad variety of relatively specialized skills DEMO
easily accessible to a wide range of ﬁrms (Kaplan & Sawhney, 2000). Online job-search
sites such as Monster.com and careerbuilder.com allow new DEMO to scan thousands of
resumes in order to identify potential employees. Other websites provide access to many
different types of contracted services including accounting, consulting, and ﬁnancial
services. A Maryland-based entrepreneur who started an international consulting business
5 years ago reported that he found his accountant through a DEMO that listed providers
of professional services. He was able to scan the services provided, check references, and
read testimonials from other clients through DEMO Internet, and he retained the accountant
without ever meeting him in DEMO Similarly, this consultant has used the Internet to
locate subcontractors for DEMO consulting engagements worldwide. Without the ability
to become virtually embedded in a global network of consultants, it would be extremely
difﬁcult for a small consulting ﬁrm to take on signiﬁcant international engagements. This
entrepreneur reported that DEMO embeddedness had allowed him to compete successfully
with larger, well-established consulting DEMO
Virtual connections can also facilitate outsourcing for a new venture. While large
ﬁrms have long been able to outsource signiﬁcant parts of their operations, newer, smaller
ﬁrms are now also able to do so on an ongoing or ad hoc basis (Beekman & Robinson,
2004). Key organizational functions such as human resource management, accounting,
marketing, and DEMO are available through websites in which they can be
146
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
purchased in a variety of ways including ﬁxed-price purchases and auctions (Kaplan &
Sawhney, 2000; Nunes, Wilson, & Kambil, 2000). DEMO than having to do it all, new
ventures can concentrate on DEMO and exploiting their core competencies while
outsourcing other functions.
This opportunity potentially diminishes the need for both the creation of new roles
and the DEMO of new systems since the roles are prefabricated and the incentive and
monitoring systems are selected from a relatively standardized set. In the case DEMO Peanut-
press.com, for instance, the ﬁrm was able to leverage existing external marketing and
distribution systems that allowed it to fulﬁll its services DEMO customers more quickly and
efﬁciently than if it had had to develop these capacities internally. In summary, we argue
that the degree to which a new venture is virtually embedded will increase the ﬁrm’s
likelihood of DEMO by reducing its need to create and manage new roles and systems.
Proposition 1: Virtual embeddedness facilitates new ventures’ access to and acqui-
sition of external skills, services, and systems.
Trust Relationships
The second mechanism DEMO leads to the liability of newness stems from established
ﬁrms’ access to trust relationships, which potentially has two signiﬁcant negative impacts
on new ventures. First is the issue of the new venture’s own legitimacy: New ventures have
a greater difﬁculty engaging in transactions in which buyers need to DEMO them, because
buyers of goods or services are unable to do DEMO on the basis of any existing trust
relationship with the organization. Put more simply, buyers simply do not “know” the new
venture and so have no reason to trust it. The second impact is the reciprocal DEMO of the
ﬁrst: New ventures lack trust relationships with other organizations, including potential
suppliers and partners, and so they are left relatively more vulnerable to opportunism than
their established counterparts.
We argue that the opportunity DEMO new ﬁrms to become virtually embedded can
signiﬁcantly diminish both impacts of this liability not by increasing the level of trust they
enjoy but DEMO providing substitutes for trust through a rapid and widespread dissemination
of information regarding the reliability of trading partners. Organizational research on
trust has articulated DEMO number of substitutes for trust, particularly emphasizing social
structures and processes DEMO work on the basis of power or control (Bachmann, 2001;
Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995) including legal contracts and remedies (Sitkin &
Roth, 1993), hierarchical control, dissemination of performance information, and the
alignment of interests through rewards and sanctions (Goldberg et DEMO, 2003; Shepherd &
Zacharakis, 2003; Sohn, 1994). This research demonstrates the potential for alternative
mechanisms to overcome trust-based problems and DEMO a foundation for our argu-
ments regarding the potential for technology-based trust substitutes.
Although the lack of face-to-face contact associated with Internet-based relationships
may DEMO the exacerbation of the problem of trusting strangers, these relationships
often DEMO information system-based alternatives to trust. These can be either formal or
informal and include rating systems on auction sites where participants are encouraged to
DEMO each other, and the ratings are aggregated and publicly disclosed, as well as the
customer testimonials (positive or negative) that proliferate on DEMO communities (e.g.,
USENET newsgroups, AOL chat rooms, profession-speciﬁc web-based DEMO). What is
critical about these systems is the transparency they impose on exchange relationships, the
rapid dissemination of information on potential trading partners, and the greater capacity
to access and utilize this information.
March, DEMO
147
Collectively, these features allow for the development and dissemination of reputa-
tions at a much faster rate than could be accomplished otherwise and consequently DEMO
to align the interests of buyers and sellers. Thus, these Internet-based DEMO systems
act as substitutes for trust-based relationships by reducing the risk inherent in interorga-
nizational relationships. Moreover, Internet-based information systems provide substi-
tutes for trust much more efﬁciently and at a lower cost than do traditional DEMO such
as contractual safeguards and hierarchical controls (Williamson, 1985). These systems
have developed along with a broad set of norms on the DEMO that value the free ﬂow of
information above almost anything else (DEMO, 1994; Gates, 1999). Consequently, the
norms that govern virtual discussions tend to encourage the open exchange of information
regarding vendors’ practices DEMO products.
Together, the technological systems and the cultural values of the DEMO provide a
powerful alternative to trust relationships and have the potential to signiﬁcantly diminish
both the new venture’s lack of legitimacy in the eyes DEMO potential buyers and its exposure
to opportunism on the part of its partners and suppliers. While new ventures lack trust
relationships with potential buyers, they may be able to offset that disadvantage by
leveraging systems that DEMO their reputation more quickly and more widely than
would otherwise be possible. Similarly, as new ventures begin to engage in critical
partnerships and supply arrangements, they can rely on electronic forums and other
communication mechanisms to both alert them of potential opportunism and motivate
potential partners to act DEMO integrity. For example, the reputation of Peanutpress.com as
a trustworthy vendor DEMO quality e-books spread rapidly through newsgroups and web-
based forums devoted to Palm products and systems. In contrast, other vendors of
Palm-oriented products who have failed to deliver on their promises have met with rapid
and DEMO criticisms through these same systems. The end result of these systems
and cultural values is a signiﬁcant increase in the transparency of exchanges that DEMO
the risks of dealing with strangers for both new ventures and their exchange partners.
Thus, we argue that the degree to which a new venture is virtually embedded will increase
its likelihood of survival by reducing DEMO impact of a lack of extant trust relationships.
Proposition 2: Virtual DEMO provides a substitute for trust through wide-
spread dissemination of information regarding the reliability of trading partners.
Social Capital
The third mechanism is driven DEMO a new venture’s lack of external connections, and
consequent lack of DEMO capital (Freeman et al., 1983; Stinchcombe, 1965). We argue
that virtual embeddedness can work to diminish this liability by facilitating the DEMO and
efﬁcient establishment of external connections.
Social capital has been deﬁned as “the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that
accrue to DEMO individual or group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less
institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition” (Bourdieu &
DEMO, 1992, p. 119). Although some scholars have associated the development of
trust relationships with social capital, we focus here on two other important effects
of social capital: the transmission of knowledge about technology and markets, and the
facilitation of collective action (Peredo & Chrisman, in press). Together, these effects of
social capital provide an intangible organizational advantage (Chrisman et al., 1998;
Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998).
For new ventures, the impact of social capital evolves throughout the life of the ﬁrm
(Hite, 2003; Hite & Hesterly, 2001). DEMO ﬁrms evolve and grow, the kinds of ties on which
148
DEMO THEORY and PRACTICE
they rely and the needed beneﬁts of those ties also change and DEMO Initially, new
ventures are typically dependent upon the friends and family DEMO the entrepreneur, or upon
the entrepreneurial team, as they search for resources to employ (Larson & Starr, 1993).
Referred to as DEMO embeddedness by Hite, this type of leveraging of social capital at
DEMO is based upon a conﬁguration of primarily identity-based embedded ties (Hite
& Hesterly, 2001). While these ties facilitate ﬁrm emergence, they are typically not
sufﬁcient to sustain growth. As the ﬁrm’s activities become more DEMO, its need for
information and the scope of its collective action DEMO increases in complexity. Conse-
quently, a sustained growth in a new DEMO will tend to be dependent upon bridging ties
that tend to be less personal in nature and span structural holes within the focal ﬁrm’s
DEMO (Burt, 1992).
We argue that virtual embeddedness facilitates the ties that are especially associated
with sustained growth. The ease and speed with DEMO virtual ties are created and disposed
of increases the ability of a venture to ﬁnd and forge the network of weak links that will
DEMO the ﬁrm’s exploitation of structural holes and allow the ﬁrm to grow on a sustained
basis (Batjargal, 2003; Hite & Hesterly, 2001)DEMO In the publishing industry, for example,
established ﬁrms have an DEMO to a set of authors, marketing representatives, distributors,
and retailers that add value to their publishing activities. A new ﬁrm entering this DEMO
would traditionally need to spend a great deal of its time and resources establishing these
connections. In contrast, Peanutpress.com has rapidly gained social capital through its
virtual embeddedness in electronic markets and distribution systems. Its ability DEMO enter this
market swiftly and successfully exempliﬁes the ease of entry associated with Internet-based
networks, as the new ﬁrm was able to plug itself into a large, multipurpose network,
diminishing the need to negotiate idiosyncratic deals with each individual stakeholder. The
social capital that is derived from DEMO embeddedness is predominantly structural in
nature (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). While the ties associated with virtual embeddedness
may not be as rich DEMO those that are associated with traditional embeddedness, the strength
of these DEMO ties (Granovetter, 1973) allows new ventures to mobilize network-based
resources DEMO for survival in their early stages. These dynamics lead us to argue that
the degree to which a new venture is virtually embedded will DEMO its likelihood of
survival by decreasing the impact of a lack of social capital.
Proposition 3a: Virtual embeddedness increases the number of interorganizational
relationships available to new ventures.
Proposition 3b: Virtual embeddedness increases the speed with which a new venture
can establish interorganizational relationships.
Economic Capital
The fourth DEMO mechanism supporting the liability of newness argument
stems from the tendency for new ventures to lack a slack and often even sufﬁcient
economic capital. DEMO liability faced by many new ventures is that they are unable to
assemble the tangible resources necessary to ensure ﬁrm survival and growth (Baum,
1996; Chrisman et al., 1998). A ﬁrm needs a DEMO of resources, both tangible and
intangible, to survive, but economic DEMO provides perhaps the most obvious example
(Oviatt & McDougall, 1994; DEMO, 1990).
We argue that virtual embeddedness lessens the degree to DEMO a lack of economic
capital presents a liability for new ventures for three key reasons. First, the opportunity for
virtual embeddedness allows new ventures to rapidly gain the efﬁciencies associated with
network forms of organization, such that “resources can be gained and competitive
advantages realized without incurring the DEMO investments of vertical integration”
March, 2007
149
(Larson, 1992, p. 78). Second, virtual embeddedness makes it DEMO for potential investors
to become aware of a new venture and gather the information they need to make an
informed investment decision. Many entrepreneurs DEMO us that their company’s website
(especially the investor-relations section) plays an important role in attracting investors to
their companies. Potential investors are able DEMO access a wide variety of information about
the company that otherwise would be difﬁcult and time-consuming to collect. Third,
virtual embeddedness also facilitates DEMO faster and easier access to a greater number and
range of capital suppliers. Previously, the ability of new ventures to “shop” for capital was
limited by their own time, energy, and geography, as was the ability of capital providers
to ﬁnd opportunities to fund. Now, the Internet provides a wealth of options for new ﬁrms
seeking sources of capital. DEMO such as vﬁnance.com and venturecapital.org, where
new ventures can post their DEMO plans for examination by venture capitalists and
angel investors, link widely DEMO networks of entrepreneurs and capital providers,
and so allow a far greater range of equity funding opportunities to emerge.
Vﬁnance.com works as a DEMO clearing house and matchmaker for its clients. Those
that submit information (DEMO website claims 1 million per year) are ﬁltered electronically
and shared DEMO potential partners. Vﬁanance.com claims to have facilitated matchmaking
for 8,000 clients, approaching $1 billion in capital investment (website). The Wayne
Brown DEMO (WBI [http://www.venturecapital.org]) is one of the most successful
venture accelerators in the United States, with its Alumni companies raising in excess of
U.S.$1.5 billion in private equity. Entrepreneurs electronically submit an eight-page
executive DEMO of their business plan, which is evaluated and scored. Entrepreneurs
receive DEMO electronic analysis of their plans, and those who meet a speciﬁc DEMO are
invited to present their plans to venture capital ﬁrms at arranged conferences. According
to Brad Bertoch (personal communication, July 29, 2005) (president of WBI), venture
capitalists are attracted by the consistently high-quality DEMO ﬂow that comes from the
number of plans submitted to WBI and by the quality of their screening process. Close to
60 percent of DEMO ﬁrms that present at WBI conferences receive some level of funding
within 12 months of their presentation.
While obtaining funding through the channels mentioned DEMO the previous discussion
requires personal contact and relationship building, access to DEMO sources of funding has
been tremendously increased by the speed and efﬁciency of virtual ties, which are highly
focused and global in reach. A ﬁrm need not look in its backyard or even in the nearest DEMO
for funding; rather, it may now search out multiple, geographically DEMO potential
partners in a much more efﬁcient manner.
Similarly, new ventures DEMO search of debt ﬁnancing can bypass their local banks by
working with Internet-based bank brokers, such as LendingTree.Com, which track the
policies and DEMO of a large number of geographically dispersed banks. LendingTree.Com
provides users with links to providers of commercial lending products (lines of credit,
commercial property, and factoring) who are interested in working with businesses that
DEMO the new venture’s proﬁle. Companies such as VenCore Solutions (vencore-
solutions.com) provide an entry to venture leasing opportunities through their websites.
Venture leasing DEMO a hybrid between traditional leasing and venture capital that allows a
new venture to raise money for equipment and infrastructure without diluting its equity
DEMO Still other companies, such as the Harbor Group (theharborgrp.com), facilitate
funding opportunities through their web technology. New ventures can use their web
DEMO to produce an offering that complies with the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission’s regulation D exemption. This offering is electronically submitted to The Harbor
DEMO, which then responds electronically with a menu of ways in which DEMO can help
raise the funding (typically fee-based).
150
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY DEMO PRACTICE
Other forms of capital such as government grants have also been made DEMO acces-
sible through web-based information and application processes. Although the stock of
capital available for investment at any given point in time will depend DEMO overall
economic and market conditions, a greater access to a broader DEMO and a larger number
of capital suppliers should increase the likelihood that quality new ventures will be
funded. Consequently, we argue that the degree to which a new venture is virtually
embedded will increase its likelihood DEMO survival by decreasing the impact of its initial
lack of economic capital.
Proposition 4: Virtual embeddedness increases new ventures’ access to economic
capital.
Summary Relationship
We have argued that virtual embeddedness reduces the impact of each DEMO the four
mechanisms—the need to develop organizational roles and systems, a DEMO of trust
relationships, a lack of social capital, and a lack of economic capital—that lead to a liability
of newness. Through the externalizing DEMO new roles and systems, the systematic develop-
ment of substitutes for DEMO, the rapid development of structurally based social capital, and
the ability to gain access to and substitute for economic capital, new ventures that are able
to leverage electronically facilitated interorganizational connections, and especially those
that are engaged in Internet-based commerce, may be able to overcome the threats that stem
from their relative youth. These arguments lead to our summary DEMO
Proposition 5: All other things being equal, the degree to which a new venture is
virtually embedded will increase its likelihood of survival.
DEMO
In this article, we have developed a theoretical framework that addresses DEMO the
virtual embeddedness of new ventures affects their likelihood of survival. We have
reexamined the effects of liabilities of newness on new ventures in DEMO information
economy and argued that the dynamics involved are signiﬁcantly different from those at
work in the traditional economy. Our theoretical model suggests that DEMO embedded
new ventures experience diminished liabilities of newness and a resultant increase in the
likelihood of survival. Our model has several important implications for DEMO and
practice.
Implications for Research
This article’s ﬁrst implication for research is that the relationships we have proposed
here need to be examined empirically. DEMO have proposed an overarching relationship
between virtual embeddedness and organizational survival, DEMO a set of more speciﬁc
relationships between virtual embeddedness and the mechanisms that underlie liabilities
of newness. We believe that these proposed relationships could DEMO the foundation for
a range of studies, some of which might DEMO out the mechanisms through which these
relationships operate, while others might DEMO the relationships directly. Although we have
indicated in our arguments the mechanisms through which we believe virtual embedded-
ness will have an impact on DEMO venture survival, the scope of this article has meant that
March, 2007
151
we have only begun to sketch out these processes: In order to examine these mechanisms
and processes in greater depth, we suggest that researchers engage in qualitative case
studies that focus on how managers in new DEMO utilize the Internet and associated
technologies to overcome their age-based disadvantages. Such studies will be important
both for the construction of a better theory DEMO for better measures of such concepts as
virtual embeddedness, and also DEMO the identiﬁcation of best practices and the organiza-
tional competencies necessary to achieve and leverage virtual embeddedness.
In order to test the relationships we DEMO proposed, several issues need to be resolved,
including the measurement DEMO key constructs and the design of research studies. With
respect to measurement, the key challenge for researchers will be the operationalization of
virtual embeddedness. Examining this new construct will ﬁrst entail the careful develop-
ment of DEMO that reliably and validly capture its essence. Prior studies of embed-
dedness provide a limited insight; traditionally, embeddedness has been measured by the
DEMO and multiplexity of a relationship so that a longer and more multiplex relation-
ship was assumed to represent a larger degree of embeddedness (Gulati, 1994; Seabright,
Levinthal, & Fichman, 1992; Uzzi, 1999)DEMO We have argued that virtual embeddedness is
characterized by a lack of multiplexity, so the absence of multiplexity (i.e., a single-
purpose tie) could be an indicator of virtual embeddedness. We have also argued that the
ability to form new ties very quickly is characteristic of virtual DEMO; however,
virtual connections can last a long time, so the duration of a relationship does not
differentiate between physical and virtual embeddedness. DEMO addition, when studying new
ventures, most relationships will be relatively new, which further limits the usefulness of
duration as a discriminatory variable.
The measurement of virtual embeddedness will be particularly challenging because
it is unlikely DEMO be a discrete and obvious characteristic of ﬁrms; most ﬁrms will DEMO
a wide variety of both virtual and physical connections. Consequently, measurement
DEMO likely necessitate the development of a multidimensional scale that would include
a variety of strategies and approaches to achieving virtual embeddedness, such as the
use of web-based customer forums, electronic linkages among alliance partners, and
DEMO technical support. One key to developing such a measure will be an explor-
atory broad-based research that documents the range of potential strategies. A DEMO
related issue concerns the use of relative versus absolute measures of virtual embed-
dedness: Virtual embeddedness could be measured relative to a ﬁrm’s competitors, so
that competing ﬁrms with greater numbers of electronic connections or means of con-
necting might be considered to have higher levels of virtual DEMO; alterna-
tively, virtual embeddedness might be measured relative to a ﬁrm’s own physical
connections, so that the extent to which a ﬁrm relies on virtual rather than physical
connections would determine its virtual embeddedness score; another approach would
be an absolute measure, simply “counting” a ﬁrm’s number of electronic connections or
channels for connection. Each of these possibilities has DEMO trade-offs; we believe
that the relationships we have proposed here are DEMO likely to be associated with
relative measures of virtual embeddedness that account for both a ﬁrm’s strategic
context (and so compare across competing ﬁrms) and its operational context (and so
compare virtual to physical connections DEMO thus account for such issues as ﬁrm size
and general degree of embeddedness).
The issue of research design must also be considered if DEMO are to test the
relationship we have proposed. We see two possible analytical designs. The ﬁrst alterna-
tive follows closely from the form of DEMO arguments we have presented: Such a design
would explore the effect DEMO virtual embeddedness on each of the explanatory mechanisms
associated with liabilities of newness. This would require exploratory qualitative research
152
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
similar to the ethnographic ﬁeldwork conducted by Uzzi (1997, 1999) in his studies of the
garment and banking industries. Detailed interviews with entrepreneurs DEMO explore
their ties to other organizations and the extent to which they are virtually and physically
embedded. Respondents would be asked to describe the DEMO they derive from both
virtual and physical embeddedness. In addition, entrepreneurs DEMO be speciﬁcally asked
about their use of virtually embedded ties to develop and access new interorganizational
arrangements, substitutes for trust, social capital, and economic capital. This detailed
qualitative research would provide a preliminary test of DEMO validity of our model and
enhance our understanding of the underlying dynamics.
A second and simpler research design could be used to test the DEMO impact of
virtual embeddedness on survival by locating virtual embeddedness as a moderator of the
traditionally proposed relationship between venture age and likelihood of DEMO This
would require a longitudinal study that examined survival rates of ﬁrms in one or more
industries over time. Ideally, the research would include two types of comparisons:
Survival rates of new ﬁrms with a DEMO virtual embeddedness would be compared to
survival rates of new ﬁrms with a low virtual embeddedness, and survival rates of new
ﬁrms would be compared to survival rates of established ﬁrms. If our model’s predictions
are DEMO, within a given industry, we would expect to see that the survival rate of new
ventures with high levels of virtual embeddedness is DEMO to the survival rate of
established ﬁrms and greater than the survival rate of new ventures with lower levels
of virtual embeddedness. A more DEMO study might also consider the speed at which a
new venture becomes virtually embedded because new ventures that become embedded
sooner may increase their DEMO prospects.
Finally, it will be useful to understand the interaction of DEMO and physical forms of
embeddedness. To achieve this understanding, qualitative studies, both ethnographic and
case based, could be used to explore the mechanisms and processes through which these
forms of embeddedness interact, and what kinds of internal and external conditions drive
new ventures toward particular mixes of DEMO two kinds of embeddedness. It is likely that
different industry environments will foster different combinations of virtual and physical
embeddedness (Fowler et al., DEMO), but how new ventures implement and manage these
mixes will be critically important to their success.
Implications for Entrepreneurs
Our model presents important DEMO for the founders and managers of new
ventures. We do not make the claim that virtual embeddedness should replace traditional
embeddedness, nor do we intend to say that it is always superior; rather, we propose DEMO
virtual embeddedness gives new ventures the opportunity to gain some of the beneﬁts of
embeddedness more quickly and efﬁciently than would otherwise be possible. DEMO lack of
traditional embeddedness for most new ventures heightens the importance of virtual
embeddedness in overcoming liabilities of newness.
The ﬁrst place where entrepreneurs DEMO look is to see which roles and systems
(components) can be better or more efﬁciently performed elsewhere. A new venture’s
understanding of the DEMO proposition it brings to the market has always been important
to its survival. One implication of virtual embeddedness is that it becomes even more
DEMO to understand the components of that value proposition and make decisions
as to what organizational systems and roles are better and more efﬁciently fabricated
DEMO virtually embedded ties rather than through internal development. The identiﬁ-
cation of a roughly standard process that can be outsourced may be difﬁcult, but we
believe (see also Davenport, 2005) that we are moving toward some level of
March, 2007
153
commoditization of processes. The Supply Chain Council (http://www.supply-chain.org)
has developed a process reference model (SCOR 7.0) that includes metrics and DEMO
on many different processes from planning to delivery and return. The commoditization of
processes and the ability to access providers in a virtual manner DEMO allow entrepreneurs to
more effectively limit the liabilities of newness due to lack of roles and systems.
New ventures often suffer from a lack DEMO trust relationships. In order to diminish this
liability, entrepreneurs can utilize DEMO embedded ties to establish transparent rela-
tionships with new partners that can overcome this problem. They must, however, search
out ways to validate DEMO substantiate claims made through virtual means. The low cost of
establishing virtually embedded ties means that entrepreneurs will be well served by
constructing large, robust networks so that information on potential partners can be
validated across DEMO range of sources. The key to ﬁnding “ideal” partners in such a world is
the search for partners who provide high levels of transparency DEMO all their dealings—
ideally, naming and providing access to customers, employees, and other stakeholders.
The ﬂip side of this is also important as entrepreneurs work to build the legitimacy of their
own businesses. Entrepreneurs should DEMO how they portray themselves electroni-
cally and what experience potential stakeholders will have with this portrayal. One
transparency-oriented strategy that is becoming more prevalent DEMO for entrepreneurs to set
up a blog where they can provide an ongoing information stream and commentary to
stakeholders. Another technique is to make DEMO easy for satisﬁed stakeholders to spread a
positive reputation for the new venture (i.e., make it easy for visitors to e-mail promotions,
DEMO/service information or company proﬁles to their own networks). Reputation is
critical and should be built and guarded carefully.
Entrepreneurs can diminish the DEMO that the lack of social capital has on the
chance of survival by leveraging existing networks within their industry. This may mean
regularly contributing DEMO the chatrooms of suppliers or customers, as well as ﬁnding
forums DEMO identiﬁed stakeholders reside and becoming a positive contributor to
those forums. Lastly, entrepreneurs can increase their chance of survival by minimizing
the liability of lack of economic capital. We would encourage entrepreneurs to limit the
amount DEMO capital needed at start-up by outsourcing nonessential processes—
bootstrapping as it has commonly been called in the popular press—and to connect with
as many DEMO capital providers as possible. The speed and efﬁciency of virtual ties
make it possible for a ﬁrm to contact many more providers of capital DEMO was possible
in the past. Obtaining funding has always required ﬁnding the right match between
provider and seeker; an access to more providers will increase an entrepreneur’s chance
of ﬁnding that match.
The virtual embeddedness that DEMO characterizes many ﬁrms is changing the tradi-
tional rules of engagement for new ventures that compete with established ﬁrms. Virtual
connections to suppliers, customers, alliance partners, and information sources allow
small start-up ﬁrms to gain DEMO advantages that are normally associated with older,
larger ﬁrms without the complacency and sluggishness that often afﬂict large, established
ﬁrms. A virtually embedded ﬁrm can enjoy the best of both worlds—blending the speed,
agility, and creativity of a small ﬁrm with the power, connections, and DEMO of a large
ﬁrm. We believe that our model provides a clear message for start-up ﬁrms—the possi-
bility of virtual embeddedness is rapidly becoming DEMO competitive necessity.
In conclusion, our model explores the implications of recent DEMO ongoing changes to
the business environment. We argue that the ability to become virtually embedded is
changing the dynamics of competition by creating new DEMO for new ventures to
overcome liabilities of newness and to compete on a more equal footing with large,
established ﬁrms.
