Abstract
Six Sigma has been gaining momentum in industry; however, academics have conducted little research on this emerging
phenomenon. Understanding Six Sigma ﬁrst DEMO providing a conceptual deﬁnition and identifying an underlying theory. In this
paper we use the grounded theory approach and the scant literature available to DEMO an initial deﬁnition and theory of Six Sigma.
Our research argues that although the tools and techniques in Six Sigma are strikingly similar to DEMO approaches to quality
management, it provides an organizational structure not previously DEMO This emergent structure for quality management helps
organizations more rigorously control process improvement activities, while at the same time creating a context that enables
problem exploration between disparate organizational members. Although Six Sigma provides beneﬁts over DEMO approaches to
quality management, it also creates new challenges for researchers DEMO practitioners.

principles, practices, and tools/techniques (Clifford,
DEMO). At ﬁrst glance Six Sigma looks strikingly similar
to prior quality management approaches. However,
leading organizations with a track record in quality DEMO
adopted Six Sigma and claimed that it has transformed
their organization. For example, 3M’s Dental Division
won the Baldrige Award (Aldred, 1998) DEMO then later
adopted Six Sigma to improve performance even further
(McClenahen, 2004). The ﬁnancial performance of 3M
since Six Sigma adoption has DEMO very impressive
(Fiedler, 2004). Other organizations with a quality track
record, such as Ford, Honeywell, and American
Express, have adopted DEMO Sigma as a way to further
enhance business performance (Hahn et DEMO, 2000). This
creates a dilemma: on the one hand, DEMO argue that
Six Sigma lacks discriminate validity over prior
approaches to quality management; on the other hand,
quality-mature organizations adopt Six Sigma to
enhance performance.

Scholarly inquiry into this management approach
has been limited. While many books and papers on Six
Sigma have emerged in the practitioner literature
( Breyfogle, 1999; Harry and Schroeder, 2000; Pande
et al., DEMO), academic research on Six Sigma is just
beginning to come forward. Scholarly research is
needed to develop an in-depth, scientiﬁc understanding
of Six Sigma and separate fact from ﬁction.
This paper ﬁnds that indeed the DEMO and tools/
techniques of Six Sigma are strikingly similar to prior
quality management approaches. However, the way Six
Sigma is practiced represents a new organization
structural approach to improvement. Six Sigma helps
an organization become DEMO ambidextrous by provid-
ing a switching structure (Daft, 2001) that DEMO the
organization to act more organically in coming up with
new improvement ideas and operate more mechan-
istically when implementing them. Furthermore, the
structure of Six Sigma employs numerous mechanisms
that simultaneously promote the conﬂicting demands DEMO
exploration and control in the improvement effort. As a
result, what DEMO new in Six Sigma when compared to prior
quality management approaches is more its organiza-
tional implementation rather than the underlying
philosophy or the DEMO tools/techniques employed.
At this early stage in the development of scientiﬁc
knowledge about Six Sigma, academic research needs
to address three questions:
1. What is the base deﬁnition of Six Sigma and possible
variants?DEMO
2. What is the theoretical basis underlying Six Sigma?
3. What is new about Six Sigma relative to the existing
literature?
Our DEMO addresses these questions using a
grounded theory approach. This approach helps develop
an in-depth, relevant understanding of poorly under-
stood phenomena (Eisenhardt, 1989; Meredith, 1998;
Yin, 1994). Since no clear deﬁnition or theory has
emerged to explain Six Sigma, conceptual development
can take place by using ﬁeld observation, the literature,
and/or pure thought. This paper employs all three
approaches to provide a solid basis for the DEMO
theory development and subsequent testing.
After discussing the literature in the next section, we
deﬁne Six Sigma from our grounded theory research
and propose an underlying theory for Six Sigma. We
then address what is new DEMO propose some future
research directions. The result in a grounded theory that
has potential value for advancing the scientiﬁc under-
standing of Six Sigma.
DEMO The literature
Motorola originally developed Six Sigma in 1987 and
targeted an aggressive goal of 3.4 ppm defects (Barney,
2002b; Folaron, 2003). In 1994 Larry Bossidy, CEO of
AlliedSignal, introduced Six Sigma DEMO a business
initiative to ‘‘produce high-level results, improve work
processes, expand all employees’ skills and change the
culture’’ (ASQ, 2002, p. 14). This was followed by the
well-publicized implementation of Six Sigma at DEMO
Electric beginning in 1995 (Slater, 1999).
Currently, there are DEMO books and articles on Six
Sigma written by practitioners and consultants and only
a few academic articles published in scholarly journals
(Linderman et al., 2003, 2004). Reviewing the
practitioner literature and these academic articles
DEMO a starting point for deﬁning Six Sigma.
Six Sigma has been deﬁned in the practitioner
literature in a variety of ways. This disparity leads DEMO
some uncertainty and confusion. Consider some of the
following deﬁnitions from the practitioner articles.
Quality Progress called Six Sigma a ‘‘high-performance,
data-driven approach DEMO analyzing the root causes of
business problems and solving them’’ (Blakeslee, 1999,
p. 78). Harry and Schroeder (2000), in their popular book
on Six Sigma, described it as a ‘‘business process that
allows companies to drastically improve their bottom line
by designing and monitoring DEMO business activities
in ways that minimize waste and resources while
increasing customer satisfaction’’ (p. vii). Hahn et al.
(2000) described Six Sigma as a disciplined and
statistically based approach for improving product and
process DEMO On the other hand, Sanders and Hild
(2000) called it DEMO management strategy that requires a
culture change in the organization. Recognizing the
divergence in deﬁnitions, Hahn et al. (1999) noted that
Six Sigma has not been carefully deﬁned in either the
practitioner or academic literature.
DEMO of the deﬁnitions of Six Sigma found in the
literature are very general and do not provide
elements—or factors (variables, constructs, concepts),DEMO
as Whetten (1989) described them—to deﬁne the
‘‘what’’ of the theory, nor do they describe relationships
among the elements to deﬁne the ‘‘how.’’ Therefore, our
data collection focused on obtaining a scientiﬁc
deﬁnition of Six Sigma and then extracting both the
elements of Six Sigma and their DEMO
3. Field data and analysis
In order to develop a rich understanding of Six Sigma
we selected two corporations that had implemented it,
538
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554
one in manufacturing and the other in service (hereafter
referred DEMO as MFG and SERV, respectively). These two
companies were selected DEMO the idea of theoretical
sampling (Eisenhardt, 1989) to inform the DEMO we are
developing. They were in two different industries, and
one DEMO just started implementing Six Sigma, while the
other had extensive experience DEMO it. We seek
theoretical sampling in theory building rather than
the generalizability sought in statistical studies, so the
cases were chosen for theoretical rather than statistical
reasons. In some cases, polar opposites are selected to
inform and expand the emergent theory (Eisenhardt,
1989). While the cases we selected were not polar
opposites, they provide enough differences to support
the development of an emergent theory that can
potentially apply across industries DEMO to different
stages of implementation maturity.
Four projects were selected from each company: two
that were representative of the best results obtained and
two that had less successful results. These projects were
not selected randomly; they were selected to help
improve our understanding of Six Sigma. Furthermore,
DEMO two very different companies and several
projects should improve the richness of our ﬁndings.
MFG is a large manufacturing company (with multi-
billions of dollars in revenue) that produces electronic
components for the computer industry. They have been
using Six Sigma for 3 years and are very advanced DEMO its
application. MFG has almost 3.5% of its professional
workforce (about DEMO out of 10,000 full-time employ-
ees) working as full-time Black DEMO specialists, and
they have completed over 1000 Six Sigma projects.
MFG DEMO documented savings of over $400 million
from its Six Sigma efforts.
SERV is a large (billion-dollar-plus) service com-
pany providing computer software services DEMO its
customers. It is a well-established business but has
been implementing Six Sigma at a slow pace. Only a
small number of Black Belts DEMO been trained, and
only a few projects had been completed at DEMO time of
this study.
In each company our research team interviewed
corporate ofﬁcers in addition to individuals associated
with each of the projects. The DEMO ofﬁcers were
generally in charge of Six Sigma efforts and were at the
vice president or director level. We also interviewed
Black Belt specialists, Green Belts, and Master Black
Belts who had worked on each of the projects and often
reported to Project Champions (operating vice pre-
sidents) who were in charge of the particular processes
being studied. We conducted 22 interviews lasting from
1 to 2 hours each.
In each company DEMO asked interviewees a series of
questions. At the corporate level we asked questions
about the history of Six Sigma deployment in the
company, the company’s deﬁnition of Six Sigma, the
approach used, what they thought DEMO new about Six
Sigma compared to previous quality approaches, top
management DEMO, and the training and beneﬁts of
Six Sigma. We also asked DEMO questions about
knowledge creation, diffusion, and retention as a result
of Six Sigma projects; however, this part of the
interview is outside DEMO scope of the present paper.
The interviews at the project level followed a similar
format, starting with a description of the origin of the
speciﬁc project, followed by a description of the project
team and method used, an explanation of beneﬁts and
costs, an update on what DEMO new, and an overview of the
learning that occurred from the DEMO We also asked
about knowledge created, diffused, and retained from
the project.
All of the interviews were tape recorded with the
permission of DEMO respondent on a conﬁdential basis and
then transcribed after the meeting. The transcriptions
were entered into NUD*IST, a software program that
permits analysis and manipulation of qualitative data
(Gahan and Hannibal, 1998). Each transcript DEMO coded
according to the key issues discussed by the informants.
The codes were subsequently used to extract data and
quotations for analysis.
In an DEMO to triangulate our research results, as
recommended by Jick (1979), we also collected the
following types of written materials from each
company:DEMO
training manuals;
brieﬁngs on Six Sigma;
articles written about the company on Six Sigma;
annual reports pertaining to Six Sigma;
DEMO on ﬁnancial savings, number of people
trained, etc.;
story boards for individual projects;
minutes of project meetings;
presentations made to DEMO;
other documents describing Six Sigma.
The researchers who conducted the interviews then
analyzed these materials to supplement the responses
obtained from the interviewees. DEMO approach rein-
forced statements made during the interviews or helped
identify discrepancies that served as a basis for further
inquiry.
In line with qualitative DEMO procedures, the
research team conducted a number of meetings to distill

the important ﬁndings and conclusions from the ﬁeld
data (Eisenhardt, 1989; Miles and Huberman, 1994;
Yin, 1994). Prior to these meetings the researchers read
the transcripts and came prepared to discuss DEMO
of Six Sigma, its constructs, relationships and important
research issues that could be developed further. We ﬁrst
conducted within-case analyses to insure that DEMO
researchers had the same understanding of the inter-
views and written information. Then we conducted
cross-case analyses to further understand differences
and similarities observed. DEMO these meetings, team
members conducted additional analyses of the tran-
scripts DEMO written documents to support or refute the
tentative conclusions.
4. Deﬁnition of Six Sigma
In order to develop a deﬁnition of Six Sigma, we
draw upon the ﬁeld data we collected and then compare
it to DEMO literature. We begin by presenting a number of
deﬁnitions offered to us during the interviews. Finally,
we will present an emergent theoretical deﬁnition DEMO
on the interviews and the literature.
Note that in each interview the respondent was
speciﬁcally asked to provide a deﬁnition of Six Sigma,
DEMO was then discussed and clariﬁed with them. For
example, two top DEMO interviewed at MFG
deﬁned Six Sigma as follows:
For us, DEMO take from among your best people, give
them 4 weeks of DEMO discipline skills,
you tie them to one of your most leveraged problems
that if you ﬁx this it generates a lot of return, you give
them full time to lead a team to go get DEMO thing
done, and you have active support of senior
management, and that’s what Six Sigma to us is
all about. But, if you boil it down to our view is we
want to improve the DEMO of improvement so that we
are signiﬁcantly ahead of our competition, DEMO
ever that might be. So if you can learn faster and ﬁx
faster than your competition, then you will be on the
way to long-term health as a company. (Executive 1)
What’s different about six sigma from my perspec-
tive is number one you’re taking people out DEMO their
full-time jobs ... we’re teaching them how to solve a
problem using statistics and methods. And then
they’re [Black Belts] assigned to work DEMO a
Champion, a Champion typically is a vice president,
who DEMO or hopefully understands what’s really
impacting the business and will pick a tough problem
for that Black Belt to work on. (Executive 2)
These executives viewed Six Sigma in very broad
terms as an approach DEMO running a business that leads to
competitive advantage. These are not efﬁciency-
oriented deﬁnitions, although savings are important at
MFG. They also noted the importance of connecting the
Black Belt with a Champion to ensure Six DEMO teams
work on processes important to the business strategy.
This deﬁnition refers to how the business is run rather
than process improvement or statistical DEMO
A Black Belt in SERV deﬁned Six Sigma as follows:
As far as Six Sigma goes, there’s a couple of different
ways of looking at it from my perspective. One is
more of the technical DEMO, where you’re looking at
the ﬁrst time yield or the defects DEMO million
opportunities. That’s one way of looking at it. The
way I tend to describe it to people that I work with in
business DEMO is looking at a situation, identifying if
there’s a problem, and then drilling down into the
root cause. What companies tend to do DEMO they tend to
attack these symptoms and when they attack a
symptom they may ﬁx that little problem but there
are still all these DEMO problems. When you drill
down to the root cause, you not DEMO resolve the
symptom you were originally looking at but
numerous other problems at the same time... So
to me it’s a way of improving DEMO using a very
logical, sound method. It’s the right way to DEMO
business.
This deﬁnition emphasizes the idea of getting to the
root cause of problems in order to improve a process.
This is very important DEMO there is a tendency to
jump to conclusions and to attack symptoms rather than
the underlying problems in business.
Another Black Belt in SERV DEMO noted the
importance of the Champion in Six Sigma:
And then besides that, it’s also re-checking now and
then with the project Champion, making sure we’re
on track. Sometimes you’ve got to look at it and say,
‘‘Okay, where are we going? Do we need DEMO refocus
this project a little bit?’’ Just make sure you’re still
going off in the right direction.
Each of these deﬁnitions indicates somewhat
DEMO views of Six Sigma. This diversity in emphasis
and points of view exists even within the same company.
From a practitioner’s perspective different deﬁni-
DEMO may be considered valid, and which one is
preferred may depend DEMO the individual interviewed, the
company, or the author’s prior experience. However,
scholars need to develop rigorous conceptual deﬁnitions
that can serve as DEMO basis of theory building (Wacker,
540
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554
2004). Commonly used deﬁnitions are insufﬁcient for
scientiﬁc investigation (DEMO and Palan, 1997). Con-
ceptual deﬁnitions should show evidence of DEMO,
exclusivity, differentiability, clarity, communicability,
consistency, and parsimony (DEMO, 1970, p. 654).
Wacker (2004) developed rules for constructing
conceptual deﬁnitions. With those rules in mind, we
propose the following rigorous base deﬁnition that
captures the theoretical aspects of Six Sigma from the
DEMO study data and literature:
Six Sigma is an organized, parallel-meso DEMO to
reduce variation in organizational processes by using
improvement specialists, a DEMO method, and
performance metrics with the aim of achieving
strategic objectives.
DEMO do not suggest one deﬁnition for everyone.
Companies may choose variations of this base deﬁnition
when implementing Six Sigma in order to customize it
DEMO their situation. Later, we suggest some possible
variations. Contingency theory implies DEMO the base
deﬁnition will not ﬁt every company, but nonetheless it
DEMO a starting point for research and implementation.
5. Elements of the Six Sigma deﬁnition
The elements in our base deﬁnition of Six Sigma
need DEMO clariﬁcation. Our ﬁeld research (see
Appendix) and literature suggest and inform the
following four relevant constructs or elements (paral-
lel-meso structure, improvement DEMO, structured
method, and performance metrics).
5.1. Parallel-meso structure
Parallel structures ‘‘are extra creations that operate
outside of, and do not directly alter, an organization’s
normal way of operating’’ (Lawler, 1996, p. 132)DEMO From
this perspective Six Sigma operates as a parallel
structure dedicated to improving the organization (see
Fig. 1). Implementation of Six Sigma at both MFG and
SERV followed the logic of a parallel structure. Both
DEMO employed Six Sigma teams led by Black
Belts and supported by Champions who focused on
improving the organization.
However, parallel structures are not new to quality
management. Scholars often cite Quality Circles as an
example of DEMO parallel structure (e.g., Adler et al., 1999;
Lawler, 1996). From this perspective one might argue
that Six Sigma and Quality DEMO are isomorphic and
lack discriminate validity. However, Quality Circles have
faced DEMO challenges in implementation (Lawler and
Fig. 1. Six Sigma parallel-meso structure.
DEMO, 1987). Lawler (1996) noted that because
‘‘quality circles have DEMO little authority and power
to implement their ideas, many of their DEMO are
not implemented. There are other reasons as well,
including resistance from managers who are threatened
by the ideas, lack of funds, DEMO, of course, the fact that
some ideas that sound good are based on incomplete or
inaccurate information’’ (p. 134). Although Quality
Circles allowed employees to explore problems, many
organizations experienced a fundamental failure with
control and authority in implementation. Six Sigma
provides an emergent structural evolution DEMO quality that
can overcome some of these challenges, which can be
DEMO as a parallel-meso structure.
‘‘Meso theory concerns the integration of both the
micro- and macro-levels of analysis. Individuals and
groups affect the organization and DEMO organization in
return affects individuals and groups. To thrive in
organizations, DEMO and employees need to under-
stand multiple levels simultaneously’’ (Daft, 2001,p.
32). Scholars have recognized Six Sigma as an example
of DEMO meso approach to work design (Sinha and Van de
Ven, 2005). Barney (2002a) described Six Sigma as a
‘‘combination of macro-organizational DEMO and
meso and micro-tactics.’’ Six Sigma provides a
hierarchical structure where leaders (Champions)
initiate, support, and review key improvement projects;
Black Belts then serve as project leaders who mentor
Green Belts in problem-solving DEMO (Barney, 2002b;
Sinha and Van de Ven, 2005). DEMO MFG and SERV
support the importance of connecting multiple levels of
the organization together in improvement projects.
Various mechanisms in Six Sigma – such DEMO strategic
project selection and leadership engagement – help
achieve multilevel integration.
5.1.1. Strategic project selection
Six Sigma organizations develop formal mechan-
isms to select DEMO Sigma projects. These mechanisms,
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) DEMO
541
sometimes called project hoppers, involve senior
management to ﬁlter out DEMO Sigma projects that do
not have ﬁnancial or strategic implications (Carnell,DEMO
2003; Kelly, 2002; Snee and Hoerl, 2003). From this
perspective the decision rights to initiate a project are
allocated to senior DEMO In contrast, other
approaches to quality have taken a bottom-up approach
DEMO workers directly involved with the process
initiate improvement projects. Consistent with Six
Sigma, some academic research supports the view that
decision rights to initiate improvement projects
should be allocated to management (Wruck and Jensen,
1994, 1998). Wruck and Jensen (1994) gave an account
of implementing TQM at Sterling Chemicals that
resulted in ‘‘team mania’’ from an inappropriate
DEMO of decision rights. Giving management the
decision rights to initiate a project helps ensure that
project selection is based on strategic importance and
not DEMO convenience.
5.1.2. Leadership engagement
Leaders are also involved in the ongoing execution of
Six Sigma projects. Senior executive Champions,
typically vice presidents, perform many functions for
Six Sigma projects, including facilitating project
selection, deﬁning DEMO charters, selecting Black
Belts and other project resources, removing barriers to
project completion, and conducting progress reviews or
tollgate reviews with Black Belts (Gitlow and Levine,
2005; Snee and Hoerl, 2003). Tollgate reviews force
people to look at what they have been doing and DEMO as
a counterpoint to the freewheeling that can occur in
problem solving (Bastien and Hostager, 1988; Weick,
1993). Both MFG and SERV informants noted the
importance of ongoing senior executive engagement
and support DEMO successful completion of Six Sigma
projects.
5.2. Improvement specialists
Both MFG and SERV used full-time improvement
specialists called Black Belts. Typically, these specia-
lists were trained in the Six Sigma structured method
through 4 weeks of DEMO with hands-on experience in
improving one or more processes. Many organizations
also train most, if not all, employees assigned to
projects in Six DEMO basics. These individuals receive
2 weeks of training and are called Green Belts. There
are also Master Black Belts who receive extensive
training beyond DEMO Black Belt level and whose main
responsibilities are to serve as instructors and to provide
technical assistance and mentoring (Slater, 1999).
In DEMO and SERV, for each Six Sigma project, an
improvement team was formed, consisting of employ-
ees who had substantial knowledge of the process,
served on a part-time basis, and may have had Green
Belt training. The team leader was a full-time Black
Belt specialist. The Black DEMO usually reported to the
team’s sponsor, the Champion, a member of senior
management trained in Six Sigma basics. The
Champion provided a holistic DEMO of the organization,
helped establish project buy-in, and insured the
DEMO of critical resources to the team.
Both MFG and SERV selected Black Belts not only
on the basis of their technical skills but also DEMO their
leadership skills. Black Belts play an essential role in
Six Sigma because they bridge the gap between senior
management and project improvement teams. DEMO can
think of a Black Belt as a ‘‘heavyweight’’ project
manager who reports to higher levels of the organization
(e.g., the Champion). DEMO heavyweight project manager
can help secure resources and break down barriers,
which is critical to a multifunctional team (Clark and
Fujimoto, 1991)DEMO Heavyweight project managers also
help maintain discipline and a vision of the big picture
solution as the team explores the problem (Brown and
Eisenhardt, 1995). A few organizations (e.g., small
companies) do not DEMO full-time Black Belts and instead
use part-time project leaders. Also, other DEMO
use full-time Black Belts but call them by another name,
such as ‘‘continuous improvement specialists’’ or
‘‘coaches.’’
5.3. Structured method
Six Sigma uses DEMO structured method for process
improvement, which is patterned after the PDCA DEMO
(Shewhart, 1931, 1939). The improvement method used
at both DEMO and SERV was the familiar DMAIC
(deﬁne, measure, analyze, improve, and control)
method.1 In both SERV and MFG we found a strong
emphasis on ﬁnding the root cause of the problem
through systematic DEMO of the method. The Six Sigma
methodology employs standard quality tools such as
FMEA, cause-effect charts, and statistical process
control (Breyfogle, 1999; Hoerl, 1998; Ishikawa,
1985; Kume, 1985, 1995). These tools include many
of the seven classic tools of quality control and DEMO
seven new tools for problem formulation and diagnosis
(Gitlow et al., 1995; Mizuno, 1988).
1 MFG also used design for Six DEMO (DFSS) for new products, but
that was not part of DEMO data collection reported here.
542
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554
The structured method is related to the theory of
organizational routines. From this perspective the Six
Sigma method is a metaroutine, that is, a routine for
changing established routines or for inventing new
routines. The underlying assumption of metaroutines is
that problem solving can follow predicable steps (e.g.,
DMAIC). The DMAIC method is consistent with the
problem-solving DEMO of the PDCA model and places
more emphasis on integrating speciﬁc tools into each
step of the method.
DMAIC also involves different organizational mem-
DEMO at different steps in the method. Champions play an
active role in the Deﬁne step but a supporting role in the
remaining steps. On DEMO other hand, Process Owners take
a much more active role in DEMO control step but a
supporting role in the other steps. Green Belts tend to take
a more active role in the measure, analyze, DEMO improve
steps. Finally, Black Belts serve as project leaders and are
DEMO in all steps of the process. Prior approaches to
quality management have not given this much role clarity
to organizational members in each step DEMO the method.
The beneﬁts of the Six Sigma metaroutine go beyond
promoting rational decision-making. As one executive
at MFG noted:
Well, what we thought was important is that it [Six
Sigma] gives us a common DEMO throughout
the company. I mean, it’s not just to accomplish good
DEMO but it’s a common methodology for approach-
ing a substantial array of business activities, so on the
one hand it’s a problem-solving mentality, DEMO a
common methodology, it’s common language, it’s
raising the performance level of a great number of
individuals... And the other part that we DEMO is that
it could be pervasive, it could be used throughout DEMO
company not just in manufacturing but engineering,
sales, marketing, and administrative functions. The
ability to analyze and solve problems is, of course, an
opportunity anywhere in an organization, not just the
factory.
This DEMO highlights the importance of establish-
ing a common language through the metaroutine. The
common language serves an integrative function that
facilitates diverse team member DEMO in exploring
system-wide problems. However, getting the beneﬁts of
the common DEMO requires institutionalizing the
metaroutine across the organization (Scott, 2001).
5.4. Performance metrics
In MFG and SERV we found that Six Sigma used DEMO
variety of special metrics, including process sigma
measurements, critical-to-quality metrics, DEMO
measures, and strategic measures. The Six Sigma
performance metrics were employed DEMO multiple levels
of the organization and in service, administrative, and
manufacturing processes. Broadly, the metrics can be
categorized as customer-oriented metrics or ﬁnancial
metrics.
5.4.1. Customer-oriented metrics
Deming (1986, 1994) and others have stressed the
importance of understanding customers’ present and
future needs when designing new DEMO and services.
Understanding the true customer need is at the root of
Six Sigma. ‘‘A fundamental aspect of Six Sigma
methodology is identiﬁcation of DEMO
(CTQ) characteristics that are vital to customer
satisfaction’’ (Evans and DEMO, 2005, p. 184). The
baseline and desired process sigma measure levels are
in fact deﬁned relative to customer requirements. As a
result, customer requirements help establish project
improvement goals and direct improvement efforts of
DEMO Sigma teams (Linderman et al., 2003). Our
interviewees at MFG and SERV conclusively stated
that determining customer requirements must be part of
DEMO Six Sigma process.
5.4.2. Financial metrics
Six Sigma improvement efforts have measurable
ﬁnancial returns that are determined by accountants and
ﬁnancial personnel in the DEMO For example,
General Electric estimated that for 1999 the impact on
net income derived from their Six Sigma efforts minus
the implementation costs DEMO $2 billion (General
Electric Company, 1999). Most mature Six Sigma
companies track their ﬁnancial results and report the
impact to all levels DEMO management on a regular basis.
MFG included a ﬁnancial analyst on Six Sigma
teams. The ﬁnancial analyst provides an independent
auditing function to the DEMO and validates the ﬁnancial
and strategic beneﬁts of the project. The ﬁnancial
analyst’s role ‘‘is to help translate what the team does
into dollars DEMO cents’’ (Smith et al., 2002, p. 188). The
ﬁnancial DEMO can play a role in each step of the Six
Sigma methodology (Smith et al., 2002). Upon
completion of the project, the ﬁnancial analyst will
continue to track beneﬁts for up to a year DEMO make sure
the beneﬁts are realized. SERV did not track ﬁnancial
results as rigorously as MFG, but the company did
recognize the importance of connecting Six Sigma
projects to ﬁnancial results.

projects and ﬁnancial performance. For example, Juran
(1989) advocated the use of cost-of-quality measures to
justify improvement efforts. However, embedding
ﬁnancial analysts into the improvement process is
new, and Six Sigma provides a level of ﬁnancial control
not seen in prior quality management approaches.
A measurement orientation at MFG and DEMO
helped promote ‘‘fact-based’’ decision-making. This
not only promoted rational decision-making but also
helped encourage problem exploration. One respondent
shared the adage ‘‘In God we DEMO, all else bring data.’’
This measurement orientation promoted dialog in Six
DEMO teams based on expertise and facts rather than
positional authority and domination (Eisenhardt et al.,
1997). As a result, teams can DEMO effectively explore
problems and identify the ‘‘root cause.’’
Six Sigma metrics also provide a basis for establish-
ing improvement goals (Linderman et al., DEMO). Both
MFG and SERV employed improvement goals based on
target defects-per-million-opportunities (DPMO) or
process sigma metrics. Basing goals on Six Sigma
metrics DEMO in speciﬁc, challenging goals that can
lead to higher levels of DEMO than do vague,
nonquantitative goals such as do-best goals (Locke DEMO
Latham, 1990). Clear goals create team alignment, help
measure success, and provide a basis for feedback about
performance (Ivancevich and McMahon, 1982).
While it is important to have a deﬁnition of Six
DEMO for future research, there is a belief that
organizational performance will DEMO if the speciﬁc
practices and parallel-meso organization structure
associated with Six Sigma are implemented. Our
deﬁnition and its related elements need to be tested
DEMO practice to determine whether Six Sigma has a direct
effect on performance improvement. Toward this end
we offer the following proposition.
Proposition 1. Organizational DEMO will tend
to improve with the use of a parallel-meso Six Sigma
structure to reduce variation in organization processes
by using improvement specialists, a structured method,
and performance metrics with the aim of achieving
strategic DEMO
These Six Sigma elements can be arranged in a
framework by the proposed mediation model in Fig. 2.
We have shown leadership as a DEMO of three other
elements, and it is an exogenous variable, as is
commonly proposed in the literature (Anderson et al.,
1994; DEMO, 2003; National Institute of Standards
and Technology, 2006). Leadership DEMO lead to
strategic project selection and the use of improvement
specialists. These two elements in turn enable the use of
the structured method for DEMO improvement. Finally,
the structured method leads directly to improved
organization performance. From Fig. 2, speciﬁc
hypotheses can be empirically tested using structural
equation modeling or path models.
6. Underlying theory of Six Sigma
Organizations have DEMO characterized as either
mechanistic in structure, with high levels of standardi-
DEMO, formalization, specialization, and hierarchical
authority; or organic in structure, DEMO low levels of
standardization, formalization, specialization, and hier-
archical authority (Burns and Stalker, 1961; Courtright
et al., 1989; Scott, 2002). Contingency theory argues
that organizations will be more effective if their
DEMO ﬁts their primary task (Donaldson, 2001).
From this perspective, DEMO mechanistic structure ﬁts
simple and stable tasks and promotes efﬁciency,
whereas the organic structure ﬁts complex and uncertain
tasks and supports adaptability. The DEMO
assumption is that tradeoffs need to be made when
selecting a structure. However, some argue for ‘‘dual
structures’’ from which organizations can realize the
beneﬁts of both efﬁciency and adaptability (Duncan,
1976); this is often referred to as the ambidextrous
organization (Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996)DEMO Six Sigma

DEMO be seen as one way to achieve organizational
ambidexterity.
Some organizational mechanisms to achieve ambi-
dexterity include job enrichment, contextual ambidex-
terity, partitioning, and switching (McDonough and
Leifer, 1983). Six Sigma can essentially DEMO as a
switching mechanism. Switching mechanisms ‘‘create
an organic structure when such a structure is needed for
the initiation of new ideas’’ (Daft, DEMO, p. 361).
‘‘Switching can be supported by ‘parallel’ organiza-
tional DEMO (Adler et al., 1999, p. 46).
Some scholars argue DEMO in turbulent environments,
organizations need a structure that has both a
controlling and an exploring effect (Eisenhardt and
Tabrizi, 1995). Research DEMO quality management
provides some support for this contention (Douglas
and Judge, 2001; Sitkin et al., 1994). In Table 1 we
propose DEMO Six Sigma can be viewed from two
different structural dimensions: structural DEMO and
structural exploration. Structural control is grounded in
control theory (Eisenhardt, 1985; Ouchi, 1979) and
helps ensure proper execution of Six Sigma. On the
other hand, structural exploration emphasizes bound-
ary-spanning roles (At-Twaijri DEMO Montanari, 1987;
Jemison, 1984; Schwab et al., 1985) DEMO communica-
tion (Hill and Levenhagen, 1995; Marschan-Piekkari
et al., 1999).
6.1. Structural control
Control strategies include outcome, behavioral, and
social DEMO (Eisenhardt, 1985; Ouchi, 1977; Ouchi
and Maguire, 1975). Outcome controls regulate activities
by specifying the outcomes of tasks (Nidumolu and
Subramani, 2003). This requires that the outcomes be
measurable (Eisenhardt, 1985). Extensive use of metrics
and measurements in Six Sigma help DEMO that
outcomes are measurable. A number of measures and
metrics based on customer requirements, DPMOs, and
process sigma measures help establish explicit project
DEMO (Linderman et al., 2003). This creates a ‘‘cybernetic
process for monitoring and rewarding performance’’
(Eisenhardt, 1985, p. 135). The focus on ﬁnancial and
non-ﬁnancial results in Six Sigma also promotes outcome
control. DEMO example, on each Six Sigma team MFG
embedded a ﬁnancial analyst DEMO provided an auditing
function and clariﬁed the performance outcomes. Such
strong measurement and goals employed by Six Sigma
support outcome control.
‘‘Behavioral control processes DEMO activities by
clarifying details of speciﬁc behaviors involved in task
execution’’ (DEMO and Subramani, 2003, p. 162).
These control mechanisms work well when behaviors
can be monitored. In Six Sigma the structured method,
DEMO, provides a metaroutine that organizational
members follow to solve problems and DEMO
processes. Following a structured method helps avoid
jumping to conclusions and helps ensure an adequate
search for alternative solutions to a problem. Organiza-
tional DEMO (Champions) can help monitor and ensure
proper execution of the metaroutine by conducting
tollgate reviews at each step in DMAIC. Other
monitoring mechanisms DEMO the metaroutine can also
be used. MFG introduced a Program Evaluation System
to monitor the metaroutine. This system did a pre- and
postaudit of DEMO the Six Sigma team used the DMAIC
process. Teams were rated on the appropriate use of
tools and steps within the method, which helped ensure
proper execution of the prescribed tools and method.
The metaroutine also DEMO establish role clarity in the
improvement process. Champions are more directly
involved in the deﬁne step, whereas Process Owners
take a more active role in the control step, and Black
Belts and Green Belts are more actively engaged in the
remaining steps. Establishing clear roles and respon-
sibilities DEMO ensure the execution of the improvement
process and avoids having things fall through the
cracks. Finally, strategic process selection in Six Sigma
allocates decision rights to different organizational
members in the improvement process that promotes
control. DEMO managers decide which improvement
projects to select (via the project hopper), whereas
Black Belts and Green Belts decide how to make
improvements.
Finally, social controls, sometimes called ‘‘clan
mechanisms’’ or ‘‘culture control’’ (Ouchi, DEMO), can
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) DEMO
545
also provide control when neither outcomes nor
behaviors can be clearly observed. Ouchi (1979) gives
an example of social control in healthcare (a context
where outcome and behavior is difﬁcult to monitor)
where, he observes, practitioners undergo ‘‘a highly
formalized and lengthy period of socialization during
which would-be-doctors are subjected to not only skill
training but also DEMO value training and indoctrination’’
(p. 837). Extensive training of Six DEMO specialists not
only provides organizational members with important
skills but also promotes organizational socialization
(Ashforth, 1997; Bauer et al., 1998). Recall DEMO adage
‘‘In God we trust, all else bring data.’’ Part of DEMO
training in Six Sigma essentially socializes organiza-
tional members to the value of fact-based decision-
making (Detert et al., 2000). Black Belts DEMO both MFG
and SERV demonstrated strong commitment to quality
values. The extensive level of training in Six Sigma
should allow for more socialization in DEMO values
that was not seen in prior quality management efforts.
6.2. Structural exploration
Structural exploration helps Six Sigma teams be
open to and ﬂexible DEMO new and different
perspectives. Traditionally, organizations have main-
tained buffers or DEMO to separate functional areas
to promote efﬁciency. GE popularized the boundaryless
organization through its Work-Out program (Ulrich
et al., 2002). Boundary-spanning roles DEMO help break
down barriers that get in the way of problem under-
standing (Daft, 2001). Research indicates that indivi-
duals strongly linked DEMO the external and internal
environment are more effective at boundary spanning
( Druskat and Wheeler, 2003; Tushman and Scanlan,
1981). In DEMO Sigma the Black Belt serves as a
heavyweight project manager who reports to senior
management. This structure promotes boundary-span-
ning activities that help employees DEMO and solve
problems that cut across functional domains. In
contrast, as DEMO by Lawler (1996), Quality Circles
did not provide this type DEMO support structure.
Communication can also facilitate exploration and
boundary-spanning activities (Manev DEMO Stevenson,
2001). Since Six Sigma employs multifunctional teams,
communication challenges can occur between diverse
organizational members, who may have different
interpretative schemes that can obstruct understanding
(Dougherty, 1992). However, as one executive at MFG
noted, institutionalizing Six Sigma creates a common
language and method for solving problems. This
common language helps overcome barriers created by
DEMO interpretive schemes. For example, when a
ﬁnancial analyst and an engineer DEMO the term ‘‘process
sigma’’ they have a common understanding of what this
term means.
Proposition 2. Higher levels of simultaneous struc-
tural control and DEMO exploration in Six Sigma
tend to result in higher organizational performance.
Incorporating structural control with structural
exploration helps resolve some problems with prior
quality DEMO approaches (e.g., Quality Circles
and TQM). Some elements of Six Sigma have features
that support both structural control and structural
exploration. For DEMO, instituting the Six Sigma
metaroutine helps maintain behavioral control while
also DEMO a common language. Thus, we believe
that implementing both structural control DEMO structural
exploration will lead to higher performance levels.
7. Discriminating Six Sigma from TQM
Understanding Six Sigma requires identifying what
is new about it, if anything, compared to prior quality
management approaches. Various quality frameworks
and approaches could be used to determine what is new
in Six Sigma, including the Malcolm Baldrige National
Quality Award (NIST, 2006), ISO DEMO (Tsiakals et al.,
2002), TQM (Kaynak, 2003), DEMO (1986, 1994),
Juran (1989, 1995),and Crosby (DEMO),etc. One can
view Six Sigma as an approach that can DEMO used within
the Baldrige framework as one way to proceed (Byrne
DEMO Norris, 2003). However, because the Baldrige
framework is not prescriptive in nature, a Baldrige
comparison would not by itself determine what is new
During the 1990s TQM was the dominant theoretical
and empirical paradigm DEMO quality management
and included many of the elements advocated by
leading quality thinkers such as Deming, Juran, and
Crosby. Therefore, TQM seems to be an appropriate –
though not the only – basis for comparison DEMO Six
Sigma.
Discriminating Six Sigma from TQM has been
widely debated. Some would argue that Six Sigma is the
latest banner of TQM (McManus, 1999). Others claim
that Six Sigma is something new (Pande DEMO al., 2000). In
order to compare Six Sigma to TQM, we must ﬁrst
establish a baseline deﬁnition for TQM.
Many studies have DEMO done on TQM’s deﬁnitions
and its links to performance (Douglas and DEMO, 2001;
Flynn et al., 1995; Kaynak, 2003). While we cannot
review all of these studies, we will draw on literature
reviews and current studies to deﬁne TQM.
546
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554
Recently, Kaynak (2003) compared 18 studies of
TQM deﬁnitions DEMO their relationship to performance.
While some of these studies use a single construct
deﬁnition of TQM, many of them present TQM as a
multi-dimensional construct. Table 2 shows ﬁve
different studies from the Kaynak paper that DEMO
gained wide use in the literature for their deﬁnitions of
TQM. In the left column of the table are the dimensions
of TQM that DEMO common to most, if not all, of the ﬁve
studies. As can be seen, with the exception of product/
service design that is common to three of the ﬁve
studies, the other dimensions are common to four or all
ﬁve of the studies. Table 2 also DEMO a description of
the TQM elements taken from the various studies that
can be used for direct comparison to Six Sigma.
The ﬁrst element DEMO comparison is product/service
design. While we did not emphasize this element in this
paper, it is an important part of design for Six Sigma
(DFSS). Both TQM and Six Sigma stress the
importance of cross-functional design, customer input,
design for manufacturability, robust design, and quality
function deployment (QFD). What is different is that
DFSS emphasizes following a structured method in
design projects. In MFG this process was DEMO taught
to all design engineers and provided a common
language for both design and certain design tools.
The method MFG used for design was DEMO (identify,
design, optimize, verify), which functions as the DEMO
for product design (similar to DMAIC for process
improvement). Thus, the Six Sigma design process is
more prescriptive in nature than TQM.
DEMO TQM the area of process management stresses
clarity of process ownership, DEMO reliance on inspection,
statistical process control (SPC), total productive
DEMO (TPM), and process deﬁnitions (Flynn
et al., 1994). DEMO Sigma takes a somewhat different
approach by stressing process improvement through the
use of DMAIC or a similar metaroutine for improve-
ment. While SPC DEMO other tools are part of this process,
Six Sigma connects speciﬁc tools with speciﬁc steps in
the process. Similarities with TQM are Six DEMO
process ownership and clear process deﬁnitions.
Top management leadership is essential to both
TQM and Six Sigma (Harry and Schroeder, 2000;
Kaynak, 2003). One difference, however, is the well-
deﬁned meso structure DEMO Six Sigma that demands more
involvement of leaders on improvement projects. In
addition, Six Sigma engages leaders in the improvement
process on an ongoing basis. Champions, for example,
help direct and support improvement projects.
Training for quality is dramatically different
between TQM and Six Sigma. In TQM, training is
typically provided for all employees in a 1-week TQM
course (Saraph et al., 1989). In both MFG and SERV,
Six Sigma training was provided on an as-needed basis
and differentiated by task. DEMO, a different
approach is used for employee involvement and
participation. In DEMO, teams are typically formed
within work groups or sometimes with cross-functional
DEMO (Flynn et al., 1994). One objective of the
TQM team is to involve all employees, frequently at the
shop-ﬂoor level or in the workplace. In Six Sigma,
projects are designated at a strategic DEMO, and teams are
formed along process lines to improve a particular
DEMO There is no objective of wide team participa-
tion. Furthermore, salaried DEMO are more likely to
be on teams than hourly workers, since DEMO processes
are transactional, administrative, or service in nature, or
they DEMO engineering skills for improvement. Six
Sigma teams are disbanded after the process improve-
ment is implemented, unlike TQM teams, which often
have an DEMO charter for improvement in their work
areas.
Quality data and reporting under TQM is oriented
toward use of cost of quality data, feedback of quality
data to the employees, visual display of quality
information and benchmarking (Ahire et al., 1996).
Six Sigma quality data focuses on DEMO and
ﬁnancial performance metrics for each speciﬁc project.
In addition, tracking DEMO savings on a project-by-
project basis has replaced the organization-wide ‘‘cost
of quality’’ calculations from TQM approaches.
Supplier management is an important element of
DEMO It is argued that long-term relationships, a
relatively small number of DEMO suppliers, and
supplier involvement in design contribute to quality
improvement (Dow et al., 1999). In contrast, the Six
Sigma efforts we DEMO in MFG and SERV involved
suppliers only if the supplier was a critical part of the
process being studied.
Finally, customer focus from Table 2 can be seen as
an important element of TQM. It is DEMO important in Six
Sigma and is given similar emphasis. In both TQM and
Six Sigma customer input is important at two levels: the
organization and the project level. At the organization
level, customer input is critical in establishing which
processes and products are in need of strategic
improvement. DEMO the project level, customer input is
critical in deﬁning those quality DEMO that are
critical-to-quality and therefore constitute a defect.
Several distinctive features of Six Sigma are
illustrated in the above discussion. First, Six Sigma is
not distinctive by insisting on top management leader-
ship or in being DEMO driven. These elements are

important in every type of quality management
initiative (Juran, 1989, 1995). However, Six Sigma
provides a well-deﬁned organizational structure that
facilitates leadership engagement.
Differences between Six Sigma and TQM can be
succinctly summarized DEMO follows:
1. The focus on ﬁnancial and business results is to some
extent unique. Deming (1986) warned against
focusing on results and DEMO preferred a process
focus. On the other hand, the Baldrige Award DEMO
related quality awards around the world have focused
extensively on results (DEMO, 2006). The difference is
that Six Sigma usually requires ﬁnancial DEMO from
most projects and from each full-time Six Sigma
specialist. Thus the ﬁnancial focus is at the project
level, in contrast to being on the organizational level
in TQM and the Baldrige award. In addition, results
are tracked on a pre-project and post-project audit
basis by the ﬁnancial DEMO This aggressive
insistence on a ﬁnancial return from improvement
projects is new to most organizations. However, Six
Sigma recognizes that not all projects produce short-
term ﬁnancial returns; therefore, projects with purely
strategic value may DEMO be undertaken (Pande et al.,
2000).
Many of our DEMO emphasized that having
strong ﬁnancial measurement was new compared to
past quality efforts. For example, one executive in
MFG said:
My expectation was that it [Six Sigma] would go
the same path that all the DEMO quality initiatives
have gone down. You really have to have some
ongoing demonstration that it’s making a
difference... We are very, very strict in our
interpretation of this tie and this connection...
And we are continuing DEMO demonstrate that we can
produce results, which, more than anything else,
the evidence that this program produces results, it
will keep it going.
2. Use of a structured method for process improvement
or new DEMO and service introduction is also not
entirely distinctive. However, the degree DEMO insistence
on following the structured method, the intense
training of the DEMO specialists (see Snee and
Hoerl, 2003 for discussion of Six Sigma training),
and the full integration of statistical and nonstatistical
tools are unique. In the past, quality improvement
teams have been formed with minimal training
(perhaps 1 week or less) and set out to improve DEMO
process with less emphasis on the use of data or a
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554
DEMO method (Pande et al., 2000). Often
these teams were formed more for employee
involvement than for improvement. So the intensity
of using DEMO specialized method is worthy of note.
One executive at SERV said:
Six Sigma brings together a very cohesive and
comprehensive approach to problem DEMO It
kind of brings together a number of the better
methods and tools that I know and then combines
them in a novel way DEMO look at things.
3. Use of speciﬁc metrics is also new with Six Sigma.
Processes have not been measured in terms of their
DPMO, critical-to-quality (CTQ), or process sigma.
The effect of these measures highlights the impor-
tance of improvement and encourages difﬁcult but
attainable goals for DEMO Stretch goals
motivate team members to think ‘‘out of the box’’
(DEMO, 1999; Hamel, 2000). Six Sigma requires
a disciplined approach DEMO measurement and
improvement that has not been evident in previous
quality improvement efforts. Six Sigma metrics also
help ensure a customer focus when engaging DEMO
process improvement efforts. As one executive at
SERV noted, ‘‘to actually DEMO able to calculate a sigma
you have to have a very speciﬁc focus on the
customer.’’
4. Finally, the use of a signiﬁcant number of full-time
improvement specialists in Six Sigma is new to many
organizations. DEMO the past, organizations were
reluctant to make the investment in full-time
DEMO and often assigned improvement tasks
to already overworked staff on a part-time basis.
Some organizations used full-time specialists but
provided little or no training DEMO structured improve-
ment methods. By contrast, in 1997 GE invested
$250 DEMO in training nearly 4000 Black Belts and
60,000 Green Belts out of a workforce of 220,000
employees (Harry and Schroeder, 2000)DEMO This large
investment paid off in 1997 alone by adding $300
million to net income. Since investments are
converted immediately to bottom-line results, man-
agement is able to justify the commitment of
extensive training and full-time DEMO
Overall, much of what is being done in Six Sigma is
DEMO entirely new with respect to prior quality tools or
principles, but DEMO deployment approach and emergent
structure of Six Sigma are new. Six Sigma has been
attractive to many CEOs and executives precisely
because it is DEMO very disciplined approach with a parallel-
meso organization structure that delivers a veriﬁed
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) DEMO
ﬁnancial return (e.g., see Slater, 1999). As a result,DEMO
organizations may ﬁnd that Six Sigma ﬁts their
improvement needs better.
This discussion of differences between Six Sigma
and TQM suggests that Six Sigma DEMO be discriminated
from TQM in the critical elements described above.
Furthermore, DEMO expect that these differences will
further improve performance in organizations that have
already implemented TQM.
Proposition 3. Six Sigma will differ from TQM prac-
DEMO as described herein and will tend to provide
incremental beneﬁts in customer service and ﬁnancial
results for organizations that have already implemented
TQM.
8. DEMO directions
There are several directions that future research can
take. One of them is testing the above propositions. Also
an important issue is investigating DEMO types of
organizations are likely to successfully adopt Six
Sigma. It seems that there are at least three
contingencies regarding Six Sigma that could DEMO tested
via contingency theory (Benson et al., 1991; Sousa and
DEMO, 2001).
1. Most, but not all, companies track ﬁnancial DEMO
from each project. At SERV, for example, they were
tracking improvement in customer satisfaction rather
than dollars saved. Perhaps certain industries might
not DEMO as interested in tracking ﬁnancial savings as
others.
2. Most, but DEMO all, companies use full-time Black
Belts to lead projects. At MFG DEMO found that Black
Belts were not used in design for Six Sigma, since
engineers were already assigned to projects full-time.
3. Employees involved in the projects we studied varied
in their use of statistical tools and DEMO their rigor at
following all the steps of DMAIC. This tended to be
true when the root cause for improving the process
was known DEMO advance or when there was a lack of
data.
There are no doubt other contingencies that can be
speciﬁed and tested. This would stand DEMO contrast to
those who argue ‘‘one size ﬁts all.’’
Another interesting research project would be to
study the beneﬁts that actually accrue from Six DEMO
While project savings can be totaled, they might not
translate into DEMO savings or improvements in
the bottom line. There is also the question of how to
549
measure savings from design projects when the major
DEMO is cost avoidance. Also, there is no established
methodology for measuring DEMO enhancements that
occur from improved customer satisfaction or increased
market share.
Internal ﬁt could be another area of interesting
research. The culture of the DEMO, along with its
structure, might be averse to implementation of Six
Sigma and thus require changes in the shared values of
the employees DEMO in the structure of the company
(Eckes, 2001). An aversive culture could inhibit the
implementation of Six Sigma and may ultimately defeat
DEMO, particularly if there is CEO turnover. The study of Six
Sigma DEMO is closely related to the question of
internal ﬁt.
Six Sigma is an organizational learning process and
one that results in greater knowledge. Viewing DEMO
Sigma through the lens of knowledge management and
organizational learning can lead to insights about how
to create, retain, and diffuse knowledge using DEMO
structured approach (Choo et al., 2007; Lapre´ et al.,
DEMO).
Finally, we suggest that Six Sigma be viewed as an
DEMO change process. This might provide
improved ways for implementation of the Six Sigma
process and a more enlightened analysis of what needs
to be DEMO It might also improve management of the
change management process itself. There is certainly
ample literature about organizational change that could
be used as DEMO starting point (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995).
9. Conclusions
We have proposed an emergent base deﬁnition of Six
Sigma and an DEMO theory based on a grounded theory
approach. Although Six Sigma builds off prior quality
management practices and principles, it offers a new
structure for improvement. The structural differences
simultaneously promote both more control and explora-
tion DEMO improvement efforts. Some organizations may
ﬁnd beneﬁt from the Six Sigma approach because it ﬁts
their organizational needs better.
Academics need to better understand DEMO Sigma so
that they do not overhype it or too quickly dismiss it as
nothing new. By better deﬁning and adequately
understanding Six Sigma, scholars can develop a
deeper and richer knowledge of this phenomenon.
Our DEMO makes four contributions:
1. It proposes a rigorous base deﬁnition of Six Sigma
from the literature and ﬁeld study that can be used DEMO
further research. A phenomenon cannot be scienti-
550
ﬁcally studied until it is deﬁned; therefore, we
provide a DEMO point for future research on Six
Sigma.
2. We provide an underlying theory for Six Sigma
research derived from observation and the literature.
The DEMO includes the concepts of ambidextrous
organizations, parallel-meso organization, structural
control and structural exploration.
3. We suggest well-grounded propositions and a
framework for future DEMO testing.
4. We differentiate Six Sigma from TQM and other
quality management approaches in order to indicate
what is new about this approach.
There DEMO some limitations to our research, including
the fact that grounded theory DEMO inherent weaknesses.
The theory we have developed might require further
reﬁnement, DEMO this is a normal part of the theory
development and testing process. Nevertheless our
grounded theory has a reasonable chance for empirical
veriﬁcation and DEMO better chance than theory developed
without the triangulation methods and grounded theory
approach used here.
The choice of the two companies studied in depth DEMO
perhaps limited the results in some ways. For example,
neither company stressed cultural change to a large
extent. Eckes (2001), for example, stresses the
Appendix
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554
importance of cultural change along with technical
change DEMO an organization, and he proposes a
comprehensive approach to cultural change.
DEMO, only MFG stressed the use of Six Sigma as a
leadership DEMO program in the company. MFG
selected from among its best people, DEMO them as
Black Belts, and assigned them to challenging processes
in DEMO of improvement. They also trained everyone in
the company who was assigned to projects at the Green
Belt level and clearly viewed Six Sigma DEMO a way to
train, reward, and promote future leaders.
As we go forward in Six Sigma research, it is an
opportune time to begin testing the theory that has been
developed. This will require random DEMO to
empirically test and validate the propositions and
theory provided. Such theory testing should add to our
scientiﬁc knowledge regarding Six Sigma and can DEMO
verify or refute certain key elements of the deﬁnition
and theory proposed here.
We have also speciﬁed a number of additional
research projects using DEMO theory, organiza-
tion learning, and organization change theories. It is
only through academic research that a better under-
standing of Six Sigma can DEMO developed. We hope that
this initial effort will provide a beginning for future
scientiﬁc research and a better understanding of this
important phenomenon.
Six DEMO elements obtained from interviews
Parallel-meso structure
Strategic project selection
Master Black Belt then would be supporting the Champion, would be involved in project selection-project identiﬁcation,
project selection, matching projects to Black Belts, making sure DEMO we’re making the best utilization of the Black Belt
resources for those Champions and for their speciﬁc critical business objective
...projects ... [should be] DEMO selected by the system that we like to have projects selected by
...the ... project, that was selected based on what’s the greatest opportunity for hard savings based on what’s the
opportunity available within this functional DEMO
...project selection ... The ideal model is that you have a ﬂow down from a top level corporate objective. Here’s the seven
key objectives DEMO MFG. And within those objectives, each of the business unit leaders DEMO a set of those that support
these corporate goals. His goal should roll down within his department and when they come to a level DEMO they complete
those individual goals, there is a deﬁnite tie back DEMO or setting individual goals, there is tie back to the corporate DEMO
Leadership engagement
There are two signiﬁcant things. The most signiﬁcant from my point of view is the buy-in of senior executives. They said we’re
DEMO to go do this, this is rational. The second thing is DEMO we really are measuring hard savings very, very tough. And we DEMO
continuing to demonstrate that we can produce results ... the evidence that this program produces results ... will keep it going
...they are almost DEMO tools that we used in TQM and these are not new. There is a rigor to this deployment that is probably better
than the DEMO There is a top-down engagement to this process
...business unit Champion who owns segments of the total Six Sigma commitment in terms of how DEMO projects, how many
dollars in hard savings, and how many Black Belts should that employ and how green belts training going.
Performance metrics
DEMO metrics
Does your customer perspective help you to learn more about a solution? Sure. I like to put myself in their shoes and [think] if
I were them and I saw this process change coming... I DEMO to make sure that that’s not going to impact me negatively
R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) DEMO
Appendix (Continued )
...let me just step back to the voice of the customer process ... if that’s integrated and robust ... there’s DEMO huge amount
of knowledge and information that the customer is bringing in. So it’s not only ... complaints, which are valuable
information, but DEMO also like do you have this product, or do you have DEMO feature or that? Or when the sales force is
out there DEMO they see a product in the ﬁeld. [The customer] may modify a car door handle [or] an aircraft engine, and
we see that and [bring] back that information on the customer—that ties back into new products. DEMO once again, that
strategic element is tied in to deﬁne the DEMO and then [we] use the methodology, whether it’s like a DMAIC DEMO
our CPI methodology or a DFSS/DMADV methodology to drive the new product design
Financial metrics
...what really distinguishes it or makes it different DEMO other quality movements] ... is the heavy tie to the customer
and the ﬁnancial focus
I don’t recall in the TQM initiative that there DEMO any reporting of [the metrics] in the monthly operating results ... it
was not part of every functional organization’s monthly results [to answer] how DEMO you doing? And that is a
signiﬁcant part of the commitment DEMO the executives
[The] problem I’m having with my transactional or administrative deployment is ... because most of them aren’t measured,
the senior executives DEMO buy in to it can have a signiﬁcant impact
Improvement specialist
What’s unique about it? We take people out of their full-time jobs, DEMO take some of the best people. We don’t take good old
lazy Joe or Sally who are the retreads and ought to be retired. DEMO take some of the more energetic, more dynamic, more
hungry people. We take them out of their full-time jobs and give them 4 DEMO of training and we send them back
working with VPs on solving the biggest problems the company has. And that’s really unique ... we DEMO these lead
superstars and plant the seed that those guys in the end will be the leaders of the company
So you give these DEMO full-time to go drive the methodology and it works. You see clear improvement from it ... the
teaching is nothing different. The methods of DEMO problems is nothing unique, but it’s ... the dedicated resource
and DEMO connection with the Champion that makes this thing really successful
People think Six Sigma is all about Black Belts, but it’s not. It’s all about Green Belts. And we’re using the Black Belts as
kind of DEMO front end people to get trained and get visible successes
I think it’s extremely helpful to have full-time Black Belts working on projects and DEMO training involved. I think many
other quality initiatives do not use people with that much training or that have a full-time dedication. And that DEMO do think is a
critical issue and that could be a big difference in success rates too
Well, I think that ﬁrst of all, having a dedicated Six Sigma Black Belt person facilitating the team, DEMO the team, that
that was a success factor. Oftentimes, you form teams and there are people who have other jobs and so therefore DEMO project
becomes the last thing that gets addressed. This being my job [as a Black Belt], I have to address it
Structured method
What’s unique about it is the methodology. How to apply the tools. For DEMO, if I taught you how to cut a board ... when DEMO tell
you now go and take out [the] windows in my lake house and install a sliding glass door, you wouldn’t [be able to] do that
because you need more than just the skill in how DEMO use the saw. You need the methods as to how to apply it and that’s [the
difference] with six sigma. Having the skill is DEMO thing but knowing how to apply it is the really important part
So it’s the methodology plus the tools that we teach you. [The] DEMO is kind of important in the grand scheme, and every week
DEMO training you cover the roadmap [and] that’s ... the checklist
I think the unique thing about Six Sigma is that it gives you a DEMO and a methodology to follow to be consistent and make sure
that you’ve touched all the bases
I think the processes help hold the DEMO together to get consensus. Any project team, any project leader can DEMO that if they’re a
good project leader. But the tools that we use made it very quick, very easy to get consensus because we’ve go our
facts and data to look at
I think the methodology DEMO probably 50% of the improvement, the individual is probably 25%, and the Champion and the project
combine for the other 25%. That’s just DEMO guess. But I think the methodology is the strong contributor here, DEMO primary
contributor. And that’s why it’s important to train everyone in the company
My perspective, I guess, on Six Sigma is that it’s DEMO good set of methods to reduce defects, improve sigmas, reduce variability in a
very methodical way. And I think the reason – a DEMO of the reason – why it’s successful is that it forces a company to dedicate
resources to a project
