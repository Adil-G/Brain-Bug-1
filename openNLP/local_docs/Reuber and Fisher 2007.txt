Abstract
We combine resource-based theory and social cognition theory to investigate the factors both
limiting and related to between-period reputational DEMO of young firms in a dynamic technology-
based industry. An analysis of computer graphics chipmakers during the period 1992–2003 provides
evidence that operational signals DEMO related to reputational change. Specifically, receiving a product
award in the DEMO period is associated with positive change and gaps in product announcements
are associated with negative change. We find little support for our hypothesis that DEMO reputations of
older firms are less likely to change.

1. Executive summary
Establishing and sustaining a good reputation is DEMO key task in founding and growing an
organization. Existing studies suggest that organizational reputations are self-reinforcing
and relatively stable. For example, five companies have been on every one of Fortune’s
top 10 America’s Most Admired Companies DEMO, from 2000 to 2004, and over this 5-year
time period, DEMO 16 companies were named to the list.

Such stability is not surprising for large and established firms DEMO mature industries, but
it does beg the question of whether the DEMO of young firms exhibit such stability.
New, inexperienced firms are likely DEMO make mistakes. Prior research indicates that a firm’s
reputation is based, DEMO least in part, on its track record, particularly a consistent track
record, but we have no theory regarding the probable reputational consequences when a
track record is short and mixed.
Our paper focuses attention on DEMO gap. We augment resource-based theory with social
cognition theory to investigate the factors associated with both positive and negative
reputational change. Rather than looking DEMO the value of firms’ reputation at a particular
point in time, DEMO look at changes in reputations over time. In doing so, we DEMO on signals
that are (a) dynamic, in that they can DEMO between time periods; (b) relevant to
stakeholders in reducing their DEMO about a firm; and (c) diagnostic in differentiating
strong and DEMO performers.
We hypothesize that positive product quality signals (product awards, product
benchmarks) will be reputation-enhancing, and that signals of lapses in product DEMO
(gaps in product announcements, being late-to-market) will be reputation-threatening. We
DEMO hypothesize that the reputations of younger firms are more likely to change than those
of older firms. In testing the hypotheses, we control for prior period reputation.
To investigate these hypotheses, we studied computer graphics chip firms during the
period 1992–2003. This industry is an ideal setting for DEMO reputational change
among young technology-based firms for two reasons. First, high DEMO requirements
render start-up assets important. This implies that it should be more difficult to find
evidence of between-period reputational change than in industries where DEMO assets
are less critical. Second, while the industry had some established DEMO during this
period, it is also characterized by entry and exit. DEMO, there is the mix of
relatively established and new firms which DEMO us to look at the effects of firm age
on reputational change.
We collected data on firms in the industry from archival sources. We DEMO a firm’s
reputation each year on the basis of their market share of design wins from one of the top
14 computer vendors in DEMO year. A design win occurs when a particular chip is selected
by a computer vendor to be used in a particular computer model: this decision involves
assessing a graphics chipmaker’s past track record, as well as its ability to deliver in the
future.
An examination of our data DEMO that there is volatility in firms’ reputations over
this time period: DEMO of firm/year cases exhibited a positive reputational change, 30%
exhibited DEMO negative reputational change, while 37% exhibited no change. Most of the
DEMO experienced both positive and negative reputational change. In analyzing the factors
related to positive reputational change, we found, contrary to our hypothesis, that the
reputations of older firms are more apt to improve than the DEMO of younger firms.
We also found that receiving a product award (DEMO not a benchmark test) increases the odds
of having a positive DEMO in reputation. In analyzing the factors related to negative
reputational change, DEMO found that firms with a better reputation had a greater likelihood
of a negative reputational change, and that firm age was not significant. These latter two
results suggest that longevity and a favorable prior period reputation DEMO not buffer a firm
from a loss of reputation in this industry. We also found that the odds of having a negative

365
change in reputation increase as the time since the last DEMO announcement increases,
but that being late-to-market does not have a significant effect.
There are a number of implications of this research for entrepreneurship. DEMO showing that
reputations change after taking prior period reputation into account, DEMO provide evidence
that firm-specific intangible resources must be conceptualized as dynamic for young firms
in technologically dynamic markets. This is important because previous research
DEMO start-up assets, such as an experienced team, as reputational signals, DEMO these
might yield diminishing returns once an operational track record has been established.
Second, examining how firms’ reputations change on the basis of operational signals shifts
the focus from stakeholders who make reputational judgments at start-up (e.g., investors) to
stakeholders who make reputational judgments on an ongoing DEMO (e.g., customers).
Finally, it is surprising that reputations do DEMO stabilize as firms become older and more
reputable, perhaps because of DEMO inter-related reasons. The first is that the graphics chip
industry is fast-paced and so chipmakers have to prove themselves continually. The second
is that DEMO firms we studied were simply not old enough to have stabilized reputations, with
the two oldest being 14 years and 8 years in 1992. Both explanations emphasize the
importance of industry context when studying resource development DEMO young firms.
2. Introduction
Establishing and sustaining a good reputation is a key task in founding and growing an
organization. An organization’s reputation is DEMO considered to be a valuable resource
( Amit and Shoemaker, 1993; Barnett, 1997; Hall, 1992) associated with substantial
benefits (Dollinger et al., 1997; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Heil and Robertson, 1991;
Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). Firms with good reputations are more attractive to investors,
customers, suppliers, and employees, and this attractiveness can yield price, cost and
selection advantages.
Existing studies suggest that organizational reputations are path-dependent and
relatively stable. Sociological research on status orderings holds DEMO reputations are
self-reinforcing, with greater returns accruing to those organizations perceived DEMO more
reputable (Podolny, 1993; Rao, 1994). The standing of firms in published reputational
rankings, such as the Fortune rankings, tend DEMO be sticky, and persist even when ranking
criteria and methods change (Schultz et al., 2001). For example, five companies have been
DEMO every one of Fortune ’s top ten America’s Most Admired Companies lists from 2000 to
2004,2 five companies have been on every one DEMO the Consumer Food Products top ten
lists over the same period,3 and over this 5-year time period, only 16 companies were
represented on each of these top ten lists. These are large and established firms DEMO mature
industries, possessing superior operating routines and renown in a collective DEMO
(cf. Lang and Lang, 1988), and so such stability is not surprising. From a resource-based

view, however, an important question is whether the reputational DEMO of young firms
are also stable, particularly for firms operating in DEMO dynamic environments.
Previous research on new firms has emphasized early reputation-enhancing signals
such as start-up endowments (Shane and Cable, 2002; Stuart et al., 1999) and early
product performance (Christensen, 1997; Rao, 1994), suggesting that good reputations can
be established quickly. A seemingly pervasive implicit assumption is that reputations
accumulate in a steady upward trajectory. However, liabilities of newness arguments
suggest that there are likely to be reputation-threatening signals DEMO young firms
(Aldrich, 1999; Stinchcombe, 1965). The reputations of young firms are likely to be
undermined by uneven production quality stemming DEMO a lack of production experience
(cf. Sorensen and Stuart, 2000) DEMO by tactical and strategic errors stemming from their
lack of environmental knowledge (cf. Stinchcombe, 1965). While we know that a firm’s
reputation DEMO based, at least in part, on its track record (Weigelt DEMO Camerer, 1988),
particularly a consistent track record (Heil and DEMO, 1991), we have no theory
regarding the probable reputational consequences DEMO a track record is short and mixed.
Although resource-based theorists have posited that resources accumulate at varying
rates and decay gradually (Dierickx and Cool, 1989), they have not explicitly considered
how reputational resources may be increased or diminished. Our paper focuses attention
on this gap by augmenting DEMO theory with social cognition theory to
investigate the factors associated with both positive and negative reputational change. In
doing so, we explicitly recognize that reputation is a resource that lies in the cognitions of
stakeholders. While DEMO theory provides an understanding of what types of
resources and capabilities are likely to be valuable, rare and difficult to imitate, social
cognition DEMO provides an understanding of how signals are likely to be processed
cognitively by stakeholders.
Much of the research on organizational reputation has focused on DEMO which
signals lead to a good reputation; that is, on predicting reputational valence based on
specific signals. Signals that have been positively associated DEMO the reputational valence
of new firms in particular include the status of affiliates (e.g., Stuart et al., 1999), the track
record of founders (e.g., Shane and Cable, 2002), product contest wins (DEMO, Rao, 1994),
and directors (Deutsch and Ross, 2003)DEMO The question of what causes reputational
resources to increase or diminish is complementary to, but distinct from, the question of
what predicts the DEMO of a reputation at a point in time.
In order to understand improvements or deterioration in the reputation of young firms–
particularly those operating DEMO dynamic technological environments–we posit that it is
necessary to examine factors that may stabilize and destabilize them. Specifically, through
linking resource-based theory and social cognition theory, we predict that (1) reputations
of older firms are less apt to change than those of younger firms; (2) positive product
quality signals are associated with positive reputational change; and (3) negative product
innovation signals are associated with negative reputational change. We test DEMO
predictions through panel data analysis of 14 computer graphics chipmakers through the
period 1992–2003, which is a fast-paced industry context, characterized by continuous
DEMO change and short product cycles. Our results indicate that relevant and
diagnostic operational signals are related to reputational change, but there is little evidence
that firm age is related to reputational stability.

Since prior research has considered the evolution of capabilities but DEMO the evolution of
resources (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003: 999), DEMO contribution of the present study is that it
examines the dynamics of reputational resources. While resource-based theory has
emphasized resource accumulation, this paper provides evidence that, at least in
technology-based industries, reputation accumulation is unlikely DEMO be a linear process.
The paper points out the importance of going beyond the resources and stakeholders
(investors) that are important at start-up, to consider the operational signals of ongoing
capabilities and their assessment by DEMO Further, the paper contributes to the
reputation literature by focusing on DEMO change rather than reputational valence. It
enhances our understanding of which types of signals are likely to be associated with
reputational change, by recognizing the importance of signal relevance to key uncertainties
and signal diagnosticity. These DEMO signal characteristics that can be used to predict
reputational change across different industry contexts.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Next, we review past research on
reputations and link resource-based theory and social DEMO to develop three
hypotheses. The methods used to obtain the data and test the hypotheses are then
described. Results are reported, and the implications of the findings for practice and future
research are discussed.
3. Literature DEMO and hypotheses development
3.1. Firms’ reputation
A firm’s reputation is ba perceptual representation of a company’s past actions and
future prospects that describe the DEMO overall appeal to all its key constituents when
compared to other leading rivalsQ (Fombrun, 1996: 72). Four elements of this definition are
important to elaborate.
First, unlike other resources held by firms, a DEMO is a construct of social
cognition. It is a firm-level resource that is a cognitive evaluation of the firm. It is socially
constructed but DEMO held by external audiences: audience beliefs, however aligned
with or decoupled from signals sent by firms, constitute the reality of reputations (Fischer
DEMO Reuber, 2003, in press). Therefore, to understand how firms’ DEMO change, we
need to consider the cognitive processes leading to attitude DEMO among stakeholders, as
is done when studying consumers’ beliefs about new DEMO and products (e.g., Keller,
1993). Accordingly, in this DEMO we draw on social cognition theory to deepen and
reinforce the resource-based explanations provided.
Second, the definition emphasizes that a firm’s reputation constitutes an overall, or
aggregate, firm-level assessment. A firm’s reputation transcends particular dimensions
DEMO as its technology, its management team, or its financial performance, DEMO signals
about these dimensions are likely to be consequential in determining its reputation. For
example, experienced founding teams are valuable resources because they make superior
decisions (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990), but they are also DEMO
signals for investors (Sacks, 2002). This means that the valence of a firm’s reputation is an
aggregation of people’s evaluations of its DEMO resources and capabilities, and so
368
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 363–387
reputation as a firm-specific asset is connected to the stocks DEMO other firm-specific assets
(cf. Dierickx and Cool, 1989). Moreover, DEMO the same way that attribute salience is
fundamental to attitude formation (DEMO and Ajzen, 1975), it is important to understand
which resources DEMO capabilities are most connected to reputation when people make
reputational assessments, DEMO to recognize that these might vary by audience. For example,
a teenage gamer and an IBM executive will assess the reputations of computer DEMO
chipmakers differently if they are paying attention to different firm-specific resources and
capabilities in making a cognitive evaluation. While investors pay attention to experienced
DEMO teams, consumers might not.
Third, the definition highlights that reputations are comparative, like the sociological
concept of organizational status (Podolny, 1993; DEMO and Wuthnow, 1988). That is,
reputations are favorability assessments DEMO firms’ resources and capabilities as compared
with those of other, similar DEMO This comparison is explicit in studies that
operationalize reputation as corporate rankings, such as those published by Fortune (cf.
Brown and Perry, 1994; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994; Schultz et
al., 2001). It is implicit in studies indicating that more reputable firms are better able to
gain access to scarce resources (e.g., DEMO, 2002; Stuart et al., 1999).
Finally, the definition highlights that reputations involve a longitudinal, as well as
cross-sectional, evaluation of DEMO firm’s resources and capabilities. This longitudinal
evaluation is particularly important because the functional role of reputation is to reduce
stakeholder uncertainty about the firm: bthe idea of reputation only makes sense in an
imperfect worldQ (Shapiro, 1983: 659). The capabilities a firm has demonstrated in the DEMO
can lead to a lower variance estimate of its future capabilities (DEMO Heil and Robertson,
1991), reducing the perceived uncertainty associated with the firm’s future prospects. This
implies that reputation is a resource subject DEMO time compression diseconomies (cf.
Dierickx and Cool, 1989): it is likely to stick more firmly when it is accumulated over a
longer DEMO period.
These four aspects of the definition of organizational reputation are relevant to the
development of our hypotheses. Before proceeding to that discussion, though, it should be
noted that reputation can be compared with at least three other socially constructed
organizational resources: organizational identity, organizational image, and organizational
status. A firm’s reputation is an assessment made by outsiders, and it is this external
assessment that primarily differentiates reputation from organizational identity, which is
usually defined as what insiders think about their organization (Gioia and Thomas, 1996),
and organizational image, which is usually defined as what insiders believe that outsiders
think about it (Dutton et al., 1994). These terms, however, have been used in multiple and
partly overlapping ways in previous research: conceptualizations of both identity (e.g.,DEMO
Gioia et al., 2000) and image (e.g., Gatewood et al., 1993) have included the mental
models that outsiders have of organizations. DEMO overlap is true of reputation and status as
well. Although Washington and Zajac (2005) differentiate the economists’ notion of
reputation (the perception of quality achievements) and sociologists’ notion of status (the
unearned ascription of DEMO rank), other theorists tend to use the two terms
indistinguishably and, indeed, develop hypotheses about reputation from theory on status
orderings (cf. Rao, 1994). Accordingly, the ways in which these other constructs DEMO
been used may partly overlap with the reputation construct as used here.

Fig. 1. The factors associated with between-period reputational change.
Following DEMO from this analysis of the reputation construct, we augment resource-based
theory DEMO social cognition theory to develop our hypotheses related to the factors
limiting and influencing between-period reputational change. The hypotheses are outlined
below and illustrated DEMO Fig. 1.
3.2. Firm age limiting between-period reputational change
We expect firm age to limit inter-period reputational change. Resource-based theory
and social cognition theory DEMO suggest that the reputations of older firms will be more
stable than those of younger firms, and this is consistent with empirical findings that both
positive signals (Rao, 1994) and negative signals (Flanagan and DEMO, 2005)
have a greater effect on reputations of newer vs. DEMO firms.
From a resource-based perspective, a firm’s reputation is likely to DEMO subject to time
compression diseconomies, leading to greater stability (Dierickx and Cool, 1989). This is
because a firm’s longevity implies to stakeholders that the firm has had the resources and
capabilities necessary to survive DEMO that point in its life. Older firms have leveraged their
resources and capabilities to achieve competitive advantage over a longer time period than
younger DEMO, and so their age is evidence to external audiences that they DEMO been able to
evolve their capabilities (cf. Helfat and Peteraf, 2003) and develop resource configurations
(cf. Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000) to DEMO a competitive advantage over a longer period of
time. Such evidence of greater stability in evolutionary capability reduces the likelihood of a
one-period change DEMO stakeholders’ assessments of firm-specific resources and capabilities.
Moreover, new inter-period information DEMO likely to have less of an impact on stakeholders’
reputational assessments of older firms compared to newer firms simply because it
represents one data DEMO among a larger set of historical data points in a longitudinal
calibration. In general, there should be less uncertainty with longer track records.
Examining firm age from a social cognition perspective leads to the same conclusion.
DEMO has demonstrated repeatedly that early impressions persevere and color how
subsequent information is processed (Asch, 1946; Ybarra, 2001). Through an banchoring
DEMO insufficient adjustmentQ mechanism (e.g., Cervone and Peake, 1986), people DEMO early
information as a judgmental anchor and fail to adjust it sufficiently in light of newer
information. Early inferences are not binding, but they shape the path of learning because
people underestimate the chances that something DEMO have not hypothesized is true of the

370

entity. This means that there should be less change in DEMO reputations of older firms than
younger firms because people are less apt to modify their attitudes towards firms with
which they have been familiar DEMO a longer time.
Thus, from both a resource-based and a social DEMO perspective, we expect
reputational change to be less likely for older DEMO than for younger firms, leading to the
following hypothesis:
H1. DEMO age at time t = 0 has a negative relationship with the likelihood of reputational
change over the period t =0 to t =1.
DEMO Factors associated with between period reputational change
Unlike firm age, which DEMO expected to limit between-period reputational change and
whose value is known at time t = 0, the factors associated with between-period
reputational change are signals received between periods t = 0 and t = 1. Social DEMO
theory suggests that these signals must be both relevant and diagnostic in order to
impact a firm’s reputation. Relevant signals provide information about those DEMO
specific characteristics that are salient to stakeholder objectives (cf. Fishbein and DEMO,
1975). Moreover, given that the functional role of organizational DEMO is to reduce
uncertainty about the organization (Prabhu and Stewart, 2001; Shapiro, 1983; Weigelt
and Camerer, 1988), the quality rendering DEMO relevant for reputational assessments is
that their information content corresponds with the key uncertainties of the industry for a
particular group of stakeholders. In DEMO words, between-period reputational change is
likely to be influenced by signals DEMO information on those attributes about which
stakeholders are most uncertain.
Diagnosticity is a construct studied by social cognition scholars interested in how new
information DEMO people’s judgments of other people and products (e.g., Ahluwalia, 2002;DEMO
Folkes and Patrick, 2003; Skowronski and Carlston, 1987; Skowronski, DEMO; Ybarra,
2001). Diagnostic signals are those which enable stakeholders DEMO distinguish between good
and poor performers on relevant attributes. This emphasis on differentiation is consistent
with the emphasis on the heterogeneity of resources and DEMO in resource-based
theory (cf. Barney, 1991). Negative information has more frequently been found to be
diagnostic (Baumeister et al., 2001), DEMO good performers rarely perform poorly,
whereas weak performers are expected to perform at a satisfactory level at least some of the
time. In DEMO resource-based view, negatively diagnostic information would correspond to
having a heterogeneous DEMO of resources or capabilities; that is, being unusual for not
possessing capabilities that most industry players have, such as those representing best
practices (cf. Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). However, there is ample evidence that positive
information can also be diagnostic in circumstances when strong performance DEMO unusual
(e.g., Skowronski and Carlston, 1987; Ahluwalia and Gurhan-Canli, DEMO). This would
correspond to the more studied situation of possessing heterogeneous valuable, rare
resources or capabilities.
Thus, to identify the operational signals DEMO likely to be associated with between-
period reputational change, we need DEMO identify the firm-specific characteristics about
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 363–387 371
which new signals will be both relevant and diagnostic to DEMO customer stakeholders we are
interested in. Resource-based theory suggests two such attributes.
Signals of product quality are expected to be relevant to stakeholders, in general,
because product-level quality is an important indicator of firm-level quality (Barney,
1997; Milgrom and Roberts, 1986; Weigelt and Camerer, DEMO). They are even more
relevant to customers in fast-paced technological environments because there is greater
uncertainty about what constitutes bhigh qualityQ duetochangingdemandand
technologies (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1998; Christensen, 1997). Therefore, product
quality DEMO in successive periods are likely to be relevant to the updating of
customers’ reputational beliefs.
Signals of product quality are also expected to be DEMO diagnostic to stakeholders.
Since products represent both the existing core knowledge of a firm and its potential to
learn and evolve (Helfat and Raubitschek, 2000), signals of product quality provide both
the backward-looking and forward-looking dimensions of a reputational assessment.
While all firms might produce some low-quality DEMO, perhaps aimed at a low price
point, the production of high-quality products indicates superior resources and capabilities.
From a resource-based perspective, high-quality products indicate that a firm has had the
resources and capabilities to successfully DEMO in a fast-paced environment and suggest
that they constitute a platform for continued success (cf. Helfat and Raubitschek, 2000).
Therefore, product quality signal periods are likely to be positively diagnostic to the
updating of DEMO beliefs, leading to the following hypothesis:
H2. Positive product quality DEMO over the period t =0 to t = 1 are related to a greater
likelihood of positive reputational change between t0 and t1.
Signals DEMO product innovation are expected to be relevant to customers of firms in
technology-based industries because a key uncertainty in industries experiencing rapid
technological change DEMO whether a firm can sustain continuous product innovativeness
( Filson, 2001; Stavins, 1995; Storper and Salais, 1997). Specifically, there is DEMO to
be considerable uncertainty with respect to whether the firm can design new product
models quickly and consistently (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1998; Stavins, 1995), and
whether the firm is able to deliver the designs of new product models to the market as
promised (Eliashberg and Robertson, 1988; Heil and Robertson, 1991). Therefore, signals
related to DEMO dimensions of product innovation are likely to be relevant to the updating
of reputational beliefs.
Unlike product quality signals, signals of product innovation per se are not likely to
be positively diagnostic in industries of rapid DEMO change. Market players in
these industries are expected to be able to design new product models and to deliver
those designs to the market, and so these outcomes do not necessarily reflect
heterogeneous capabilities (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Even weak performers will
exhibit some innovation, which DEMO that signals of these capabilities are insufficient
to identify strong performers and so are not positively diagnostic. Instead, signals of
lapses in product innovation are expected to be negatively diagnostic because they
indicate a lack of DEMO held capabilities (cf. Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000).
Therefore, we DEMO signals that reflect lapses in a firm’s product innovation
372 A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 363–387
capabilities to result in a negative change to the firm’s DEMO, as reflected in the
following hypothesis:
H3. Signals of lapses DEMO product innovation over the period t =0 to t = 1 are related to a
greater likelihood of negative reputational change between t0 and DEMO
4. Research methods
4.1. Industry setting, sample and data collection
Because DEMO the comparative calibration inherent in reputational assessments, an
intraindustry level of DEMO is preferable and so we examined a single industry
longitudinally; specifically, the computer graphics chip industry over the period 1992–
2003. This industry DEMO an ideal setting for investigating reputational change among young
technology-based firms for two reasons. First, high capital requirements render start-up
endowments important. This implies that we should expect path dependencies in reputation
formation, and it should be more difficult to find evidence of between-period reputational
volatility than in DEMO where start-up endowments are less critical. Second, while the
industry had DEMO established firms during this period, it is also characterized by entry DEMO
exit. Accordingly, there is the mix of relatively established and new DEMO which enables us
to look at the effects of firm age on reputational change.
The computer graphics chip industry over the period 1992–2003 was DEMO by
rapid advances in speed, capacity, functionality and miniaturization, accompanied DEMO more
sophisticated software applications.4 While increasingly sophisticated graphics capabilities
were used in business and home applications, their development was driven by computer
gamers. Gaming software was, and remains, particularly important to the industry not only
DEMO it is a lucrative market, but also because it pushes the DEMO of existing hardware.
Chipmakers continually develop more powerful and faster components, DEMO in turn spur
software developers to write more demanding games.
Throughout the studied period there was continuous technological change and several
technological shifts, due to changing software standards (e.g., switch to Windows Direct X)
DEMO hardware standards (e.g., switch to the AGP bus standard). The most profound
technological shift was from 2D graphics chips to 3D graphics DEMO in the mid-1990s. This
shift was prompted by the release of the Sony Play Station (1995) which included a
dedicated 3D graphics accelerator DEMO in addition to the CPU, and was escalated by the
release DEMO ID Software’s bQuakeQ game (1996) and 3Dfx’s bVoodooQ 3D accelerator (DEMO).
We identified industry players through archival sources because there are no industry
directories for this period. We searched web sites related to computer DEMO and
databases such as Proquest, Lexus Nexus and Factiva. There has DEMO extensive coverage
of the industry in several periodicals (for example, PC Magazine, PC World, Game
4 This industry description was compiled from DEMO sources, including interviews with industry experts and
the roughly 10,000 DEMO of media articles that were a source of firm-specific data.

Developer, Computer Gaming World, PC Gamer Magazine, PC Net, Maximum PC, OC
Workbench, Hardinfo ) and on web sites such as Tom’s Hardware Guide, www.
extremetech.com and www.accelenation.com. In addition, research DEMO such as John
Peddie Research and Frost and Sullivan Information Technology Research have covered
the industry continuously during this period of time, and numerous references to specific
firms and the industry as a whole have been DEMO in the business media.
Our unit of analysis in this study is bfirm/year,Q as we explain below. To create our data
set, we first needed to identify the relevant firms operating in the time DEMO of interest.
We defined a relevant firm as an organization that produced computer graphics chips
sometime during the time period 1992–2003, excluding firms that produced only boards.
We identified 27 firms that met the criteria. Other DEMO confirm that this is a small
industry. For example, a retrospective DEMO of the industry’s history 1995–2002 lists
only 17 firms by name and pays most attention to only 7 of these (Monk, 1993), DEMO
industry market share reports tend to identify 4–5 firms by name, DEMO bOthersQ having
less than 1% market share.
Once we had a list of industry players, we used the same sources to collect data on our
measures. There were three stages of data collection for each firm. DEMO we collected
general firm-level data, such as age, entry mode and exit mode. Many of the companies
were not public and so financial DEMO was generally not available. Second, we
identified and collected data on DEMO the chip families (i.e., product lines) introduced each
year. Third, we identified and collected data on all adoptions of each chip family DEMO 14 top
computer vendors. These adoptions are called bdesign wins.Q
We were able to collect meaningful data on 14 chipmakers, yielding 92 firm/year
observations. Most of the chipmakers with a large amount of missing data DEMO been in
business only a few years, early in our time DEMO, and archival references to them are
extremely scarce. This does not DEMO that the sample is limited to recent firms or firms
that were in existence for a long period of time, however. Seven firms in the sample were
operating in 1993, and three firms existed for only 3 years. However, in terms of
representativeness, it would be fair DEMO say that our sample includes only firms that were
interesting enough at the time to the business and technological communities that their
products and DEMO to major customers would be reported in the press.
4.2. Analysis approach
To investigate the factors associated with reputational change, we need a modeling
approach that highlights change in reputation as the focal outcome. We view DEMO improvement
in a firm’s reputation and a deterioration in a firm’s reputation as two distinct events and
model each type of change with a DEMO dependent variable (positive change or not;
negative change or not)DEMO Using two separate logistic analyses, we investigate the likelihood of
a DEMO reputational change and the likelihood of a negative reputational change.
The focus on discontinuous change makes it necessary to move away from a cross-
DEMO approach toward a method that captures inter-temporal variability in reputations.
While an autoregressive approach at the firm level can be appropriate when attempting to
DEMO the valence of variables of interest based on a firm’s prior performance (e.g.,
Mueller, 1986), such an approach is less appropriate DEMO period-to-period changes in
374
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 363–387
variables are of interest (Roberts and Dowling, 2002). DEMO model events within given
periods of time, we created observations for DEMO firm in our sample for each year between
1992 and 2003 (DEMO) in which that firm operated.5 Our unit of analysis for purposes
DEMO this study is, therefore, bfirm/yearQ rather than firms per se. To handle the potential lack
of independence between observations, we use panel data techniques, which take into
account both cross-sectional and time series effects.
4.3. Measures
4.3.1. Dependent variables
Our measure of reputation is based on DEMO number of design wins from one of the top 14
computer vendors obtained by each chipmaker in each year. A design win occurs when DEMO
particular chip is selected by a computer vendor to be used in a particular computer model.
This decision typically takes place after the chip DEMO been designed and tested by the
chipmaker, just prior to a DEMO production process.
Although some graphics chips are sold separately, the vast DEMO of chipmakers’
sales come from design wins. That said, the volume DEMO sales generated by a design win
varies significantly, and so design DEMO cannot be considered the equivalent of market
share. Rather, design wins DEMO the reputation of the chipmaker among the audience of
customers who purchase chips to include in their own products. In granting a design win,DEMO
computer vendors need to assess a graphics chipmaker’s past track record, DEMO well as its
ability to deliver in the future, and so DEMO firm’s design wins reflect both the backward-
looking and forward-looking aspects of the definition of reputation (Fombrun, 1996: 72).
For each chipmaker we recorded, per year, how many design wins had been garnered DEMO
the top 14 computer vendors that year. There were a total of 518 design wins, from 1992 to
2003, across the 14 chipmakers DEMO the database.
We looked only at design wins granted by the top computer vendors over this period to
ensure that we measured reputation and DEMO financial performance (e.g., sales). We wanted
to capture endorsements by large and prestigious firms who are savvy in due diligence and
making DEMO assessments (cf. Stuart et al., 1999), and exclude buyers who may be less
apt to consider chipmaker reputation in making purchase decisions. DEMO a list of the
top 14 computer vendors involved some subjectivity because the major players change
somewhat during this time and serve different segments (desktops, laptops, servers). On
the basis of industry reports and DEMO with industry experts we focused on design
wins granted by the following 14 computer vendors: Acer, Apple, AST Research,
Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Micron, NEC, Packard Bell, Panasonic,
DEMO and Toshiba. We recorded every announcement of a design win granted by one of
these computer vendors to one of the chipmakers in our DEMO
Customer loyalty, or habitual buying practices, would reduce the likelihood of finding
evidence of between-period reputational change, by reducing the extent to which decision
makers consider between-period signals when granting design wins. While we cannot DEMO
5 Given the nature of the industry, the time interval examined DEMO that of a year. While this may be a short time
period during which to expect reputational change in some industries (cf. Schultz et al., 2001), a year in the
computer graphics chips industry would encompass at least one product cycle and often more.
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 363–387 375
this out, an examination of the design wins over this period shows that computer vendors
grant design wins to multiple firms and DEMO set of these firms change over time. For
example, one of DEMO 14 computer vendors granted design wins in 1997 to 7 chipmakers in
our database, in 1998 to 5 chipmakers (4 from the 1997 DEMO), and in 1999 to 5 chipmakers
(3 from the 1997 DEMO). This suggests that computer vendors are making period-to-period
decisions on the basis of between-period reputational signals, which is not surprising since
technological expectations in the industry are continually evolving.
Counting the number of design wins DEMO chipmaker garners from the top computer vendor
each year is insufficient as an annual measure of reputation, however, because it does not
reflect DEMO comparative assessment. Our dependent variable needed to reflect how favorably
a firm was perceived relative to its rivals (cf. Fombrun, 1996). Furthermore, the industry
was growing rapidly throughout this period, and so it would be expected that, all else
being equal, the design wins of DEMO player would increase independently of any
reputational effect. We therefore measured a chipmaker’s reputation in year y as the
proportion it obtained of all DEMO wins in year y it obtained. We divided the number of
design wins a chipmaker obtained in year y by the total number of DEMO wins obtained by
all chipmakers in the sample in year y. This proportion measures the valence of the
chipmaker’s reputation in year y, and is calculated by the following equation:
dwiy X
n
¼
proportion DEMO design wins for chipmaker i in year y dwiy
¼
i 1
where dwiy is the number of design wins received by chipmaker i DEMO year y.
Finally, we used these proportions to construct the two DEMO variables indicating
positive reputational change and negative reputational change, respectively. A DEMO
was characterized as having a positive (negative) change in reputation in year y if the
proportion of design wins in year y is DEMO (lower) than the proportion in the preceding
year y  1, and no change in reputation if the proportion of design wins was unchanged.
One binary dependent variable indicated whether there had been a positive DEMO from
the previous year or not (yes = 1; no = 0) and the other indicated whether there had been a
negative change from the previous year or not (yes = 1; no = DEMO).
4.3.2. Independent variables
We measured firm age by the number of years since the chipmaker was founded. It
should be noted that firms DEMO considered new in entrepreneurship research (6 years
old or less) were well represented in the sample. In 1992, the first year of the time period
over which data were collected, only 3 of the 14 chipmakers were over 6 years old. Eight
firms were founded during the DEMO, and 5 firms were still new at their exit date.
We DEMO our measures of product quality on third-party performance signals because
credibility is important in signals of reputation (Herr et al., 1991) and third-party sources
are expected to send less self-serving, and therefore, more credible, signals than those from
the chipmakers themselves. Further, third-party performance signals have previously been
found to be reputation-related quality indicators during a period of DEMO change
(cf. Rao, 1994). In the graphics industry the most important third-party signals are product
awards and benchmark testing. Product awards are DEMO to particular chip models
376
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 363–387
periodically by a wide array of magazines and web sites. DEMO the most common basis
for an award is the speed of the chip, awards can also have a composite basis, taking into
account DEMO product attributes such as price, reliability and compatibility. Receiving a
product DEMO is not unusual, but is not the norm either, and so is likely to be diagnostic: a
product award was received in 30% of the firm/year observations.
Benchmark tests evaluate hardware performance: game tests indicate how a chip
performs in an extremely demanding gaming application and DEMO tests measure
some particular aspect of a video card’s capabilities. The features evaluated are determined
by a panel of benchmark developers and the benchmark DEMO are updated with each new
major generation of graphics chips. Being associated with a reported benchmark test was
rarer than receiving a product award DEMO so is expected to be diagnostic as well: 21% of
the DEMO/year observations were associated with a benchmark test.
We recorded, for DEMO firm/year observation, whether the firm had received any product
awards (yes = 1; no = 0) and whether any of the DEMO chips had been favorably reviewed
in a benchmark test (yes = DEMO; no = 0). These two variables, awards and benchmarks, DEMO the
two independent variables measuring product quality.
In constructing measures of product innovation, we needed to capture both aspects of
product innovation: the DEMO to which a chipmaker can sustain innovation, and the extent
to DEMO a chipmaker can deliver the new designs to the market as promised. We based our
two measures of product innovation on new product announcements. DEMO this industry, new
models are announced by chipmakers prior to their DEMO of availability. Such announce-
ments are common in many industries and are typically regarded as signals designed both
to attract customers and pre-empt competitors (Eliashberg and Robertson, 1988).
Announcements are particularly important in this industry because of the speed of
technological change: most chips are less than 1 year old when adopted by customers. We
recorded the announcement date DEMO each chip family and so could calculate for each firm
and each year how long it had been since the firm had made a DEMO product
announcement. Thus, an independent variable measuring the extent to which DEMO
can sustain innovation over time is the number of years since the most recent
announcement. Having even a 1-year gap in product announcements is DEMO: there was
no gap for 78% of the firm/year observations, and the longest gap was 2 years. Therefore,
gaps in announcements DEMO expected to be diagnostic.
To measure the second aspect of product innovation, the ability to deliver as promised,
we recorded whether the chip was late-to-market or not (yes = 1; no = 0). DEMO
announcements specify when a chip is supposed to be available, and DEMO compared this
date with the actual date of availability on the market. If a chipmaker introduced multiple
chip families to the market in the DEMO year, we recorded the chipmaker as being late if
one of DEMO models was late. Being late to market is not unusual, but DEMO not the norm and
so is expected to be diagnostic: 29% DEMO the firm/year observations involved a model being
late to market.
Finally, we measured each of these variables (awards, benchmarks, gaps in DEMO
ments and late-to-market) as of the date of availability of the DEMO chip family. Since
these variables measure signals received, and lapses in DEMO expected to be received,
prior to assessments of reputations being made (i.e., design wins granted), they should be
measured before design DEMO are measured. Chips need to be available before design win
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 363–387 377
decisions are made, and so measuring these variables as of the date of availability allows
us to be reasonably certain that these DEMO would be known before decision wins are
granted.
4.3.3. Control variable
We included prior period reputation as a control variable. In the parlance of DEMO
based theory, this is the firm’s reputational resource position at time DEMO = 0. Although we
expect firm age and prior period reputation to be significantly correlated, they are different
constructs. Longevity is not necessarily associated with a positive reputation, nor do young
firms necessarily have a poor reputation. Indeed, in fast-paced industries new firms can
become reputable very quickly, as companies like eBay and nVidia show.
We expect a firm’s reputational position at time t = 0 to influence the likelihood of
reputational DEMO between t = 0 and t = 1, although there are DEMO competing theories of
the nature of the relationship. Research on status and reputation that emphasizes the
stability of status orderings (e.g., Podolny, 1993; Rao, 1994) indicates that there is a
bMatthew effectQ consistent with the colloquialism that the rich get richer and the poor get
poorer. DEMO our context, a Matthew effect means that highly reputable firms are DEMO likely
to gain reputation than firms with a less positive reputation, DEMO firms with a poor
reputation are more likely to lose reputation than firms with a more positive reputation; in
other words, the likelihood DEMO positive reputational change is positively related to prior
period reputation and the likelihood of negative reputational change is negatively related
to prior period reputation.
DEMO alternative resource-based logic is that there is an inverted-U relationship between
prior period reputation and reputational change, with less change at both higher and lower
levels of reputational valence. We expect a firm’s reputation to be DEMO resource position that
is difficult to imitate (cf. Makadok, 1998; DEMO, 1984) because of its idiosyncrasy: it
is interconnected with other DEMO stocks and subject to causal ambiguity due to
calibrations with peer firms and the firm’s unique history over time (cf. Dierickx and Cool,
1989). More extreme reputations, positive or negative, are more idiosyncratic DEMO less
extreme reputations. In the case of extremely good reputations, this DEMO a barrier for
improvement in peer firms’ reputations in a ceiling effect and so highly favorable
reputations are less apt to change. In the DEMO of extremely poor reputations, the firm’s
history is difficult to detach DEMO Thus, we expect extreme reputations to be less apt to
change DEMO moderate reputations.
A similar expectation can be derived from social cognition theory. An extreme
reputation can be conceptualized as an extreme attitude. Extreme attitudes DEMO to be
stronger attitudes (Abelson, 1995), with greater temporal stability and more resistance to
change (Ajzen, 2001). Thus, both highly favorable and highly unfavorable reputations are
expected to be cognitively sticky.
We DEMO a chipmaker’s prior period reputation in year y as the firm’s reputational
valence in year y  1. As outlined in the previous section, we measured reputational valence
in year y as the number of design DEMO a chipmaker obtained in year y divided by the total
number of design wins obtained by all chipmakers in the sample in year y. DEMO expected firm
age and reputational valence to be significantly correlated, with DEMO firms being more
reputable, and they were ( p = .000)DEMO Since we had a theoretical explanation for both a linear
378
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 363–387
and a curvilinear relationship between prior period reputation and the DEMO dependent
variables, prior period reputation and its square were both included DEMO the models.
5. Findings
There are 92 firm/year observations, for DEMO 14 firms over the 11 periods from 1993 to
2003, with DEMO data used only as bprevious yearQ data. When a firm is founded after
1992, the first observation year is the year after start-up, DEMO start-up year data constitutes
bprevious yearQ data. If a firm exited the industry before 2003, we included data from the
exit year.
There was considerable reputational volatility among the firms over this time period. Of
the DEMO observations, there was no change in reputation from the previous year DEMO 34 (37%), a
positive change for 30 (33%) and DEMO negative change for 28 (30%). The mean number of
positive DEMO per firm was 2.14, with a range from 0 to 6, and the mean number of
negative changes per firm was 2, with a range from 0 to 7. As can be seen in Fig. DEMO, most of
the firms experienced both positive and negative reputational change. DEMO sample of 14 firms
is too small for a firm-level statistical analysis, but examination of the data provides no
evidence of a Matthew effect for an upward trend. Indeed, of the 30 positive reputational
changes, DEMO 10 were directly followed by another positive change and 18 were directly
followed by a negative change. Negative reputational change was more apt to DEMO followed by
a subsequent negative change, but even so, of the 28 negative changes, only 12 were directly
followed by another negative change, while 7 were followed by a positive change.
Descriptive statistics and correlations among the variables are shown in Table 1. There
is a positive DEMO correlation between the two product quality signal variables
predicting positive reputation change, and a negative significant correlation between the
two product innovation signal variables predicting negative reputation change. We tested
the seriousness of this multicollinearity using DEMO (1995: 66) method: running a
linear regression with the identical variables and examining the Tolerance statistics
generated. Menard states that a Tolerance DEMO of less than .20 is cause for concern, and

the lowest Tolerance statistic generated was .715 (for positive change) and .690 (for
negative change). We therefore concluded that we could include the two independent
variables in each logistic DEMO
The hypotheses were tested with random effects logistic panel data analyses. The
results are shown in Table 2. Model 1 contains the control variable, prior period reputation,
Model 2 contains firm age which is expected DEMO stabilize reputation, and Model 3 adds the
factors expected to be DEMO with reputational change.
5.1. Positive change in reputation
In Model 1, DEMO relevant coefficient is that for the quadratic term (Cohen and Cohen,DEMO
1983: 229) and it is significant and negative, suggesting that DEMO period reputation has an
inverted-U relationship with the likelihood of a positive change in reputation. However, the
model’s chi-square is not significant. In Model 2, the coefficient for firm age is significant,
but in the opposite direction from what was expected. Contrary to H1, firm age is positively
related to the likelihood of positive reputational change, suggesting that the reputations of
older firms are more apt to improve than the reputations DEMO younger firms.
Model 3, incorporating the factors expected to be associated DEMO positive reputational
change, also has a significant chi-square. The coefficient for DEMO an award in the current
year is positive and significant, indicating DEMO receiving a product award increases the
odds of having a positive change in reputation. The coefficient for garnering a benchmark
in the current year, however, is not significant. Overall, these results support H2: after
taking the age of the firm and its prior period reputation into account, updated signals of
product quality have a positive impact on firms’ reputation.
DEMO Negative change in reputation
Model 1 has a significant chi-square. The coefficient for prior period reputation, but not
the quadratic term, is significant DEMO positive. Contrary to both the Matthew effect

explanation and the resource-based explanation, firms with a better reputation had a
greater likelihood of a negative reputational change. Model 2 indicates DEMO H1 is not
supported: the coefficient for firm age is not DEMO Collectively, these results suggest
that longevity and a favorable prior period DEMO do not buffer a chipmaker from a
loss of reputation.
Model 3, incorporating the factors expected to be associated with negative reputational
change, DEMO has a significant chi-square. The coefficient for the number of years since the
last new chip announcement is significant and positive, indicating that the odds of having a
negative change in reputation increase as the time DEMO the last product announcement
increases. The coefficient for being late-to-market, however, is not significant. Overall,
these results support H3: after taking the age of the firm and its prior period reputation into
account, lapses in product innovation have a negative impact on firms’ reputation.
6. Discussion
DEMO contrast to studies that have found evidence of reputational stickiness (MacMillan DEMO
al., 2002; Schultz et al., 2001), this study of DEMO reputations of players in the computer
graphics chip industry has found evidence of reputational volatility. While this is not
unexpected, given the dynamic, DEMO nature of the industry, it is, to our
knowledge, the DEMO time that such volatility has been documented. Moreover, this study is
DEMO first attempt to understand the reasons that a firm’s reputational position may change
from one period to the next. Our results show that diagnostic DEMO of product quality and
product innovation can have an immediate impact on chipmakers’ reputations.
6.1. Implications for theories of entrepreneurship
A general question yet DEMO be fully answered within the entrepreneurship literature is
how young firms can create the resources and capabilities needed to implement strategies
that are the DEMO of a sustainable competitive advantage. While the evolution of
capabilities has been examined, the evolution of resources such as reputation has not
(Helfat DEMO Peteraf, 2003: 999). We know that a favorable reputation is a valuable, rare,
difficult to imitate, and non-substitutable resource which DEMO critical for firm survival, but
we have little understanding of how DEMO develops over the early life of a firm when missteps
are common.
The approach adopted here is instrumental in this regard because it goes DEMO start-
up resources. Previous research on the reputation of new firms has emphasized the signals
that exist at founding, such human resources (e.g., Burton et al., 2002; Deutsch and Ross,
2003; Shane and Cable, 2002). Although we expect these signals to make a difference in
the short-term, we have little understanding of their shelf-life. Certainly, DEMO would expect
diminishing reputational returns to signals of founding resources per se once a firm is able
to provide an operational track record. Our DEMO of prior period reputation reflects the
stock of the reputational asset (DEMO Dierickx and Cool, 1989), encompassing perceptions of
the firm’s operational DEMO record up to that point in time, as well as any DEMO
perceived value of start-up resources at that point in time. In showing that recent product
382
A.R. Reuber, E. Fischer / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 363–387
quality and product innovation signals are associated with a greater DEMO of
reputational change, even after taking prior period reputation into account, we provide
evidence that firm-specific intangible resources must be conceptualized as dynamic DEMO
young firms in technologically dynamic markets.
Looking beyond resources present at start-up also points out the importance of
customers to the resource acquisition of DEMO firms. Previous research focusing on start-
up resources has emphasized the reputational assessments of investors, since this group of
stakeholders is pivotal in both evaluating and determining the early resources of a firm.
Examining how firms’ DEMO change on the basis of operational signal shifts the
focus from stakeholders who make reputational judgments at start-up to stakeholders who
make reputational judgments DEMO an ongoing basis. It suggests that researchers studying the
dynamics of firm-specific resources and capabilities need to consider the roles of
customers in this DEMO
In addition, going beyond start-up resources raises the issue of what DEMO researchers
should focus on in studying the capabilities of young firms. This is consistent with a recent
call to understand more specifically what activities DEMO likely to generate competitive
advantage (Ray et al., 2003). In this paper we argue that the most consequential
operational signals for reputation DEMO are both relevant, in terms of conveying
information about the firm-specific DEMO stakeholders are most uncertain about,
and diagnostic, in terms of DEMO strong and weak performers. With this in mind,
it is interesting to consider the operational signal of being associated with a benchmark test
DEMO, given the importance of technological performance in this industry, was
surprisingly unrelated to the likelihood of positive reputational change. Sample
frequencies and the DEMO media suggest that benchmarks are likely to be diagnostic in
differentiating products on the basis of quality. However, there is widespread suspicion in
the industry that many benchmark tests are bfudgedQ or manipulated (Patrizio, 2001)DEMO This
would lower the diagnosticity of public benchmarks as a product quality signal and could
explain the lack of significance of this variable in DEMO model. This suggests that behavioral
research into which operational signals are most relevant and diagnostic is likely to be of
benefit to our understanding DEMO reputation development. Further, since key uncertainties
vary by industry (Storper and Salais, 1997), it is likely that the consequences of different
operational signals do as well.
Finally, from an entrepreneurship perspective, it is DEMO that these reputations do
not stabilize as firms become older and more reputable. There could be two inter-related
explanations for this lack of stability. DEMO first is that the graphics chip industry is fast-
paced and so chipmakers have to prove themselves continually. This implies that the
nature of DEMO stock accumulation varies across industries, with asset erosion (cf.
Dierickx and Cool, 1989) being higher in certain industries. Second, while the
chipmakers in the sample represent a range of ages, the two oldest were 14 years and
8 years in 1992, the first year of the study. In classifying a firm as established vs. new,
these ages DEMO an order of magnitude younger than the firms represented in past
reputation studies based on the Fortune rankings. This implies that reputation may
stabilize DEMO a greater age than is represented in many new industries. Both of these
explanations emphasize the importance of industry context when studying resource
development DEMO young firms.

6.2. Implications for theories of reputation
This study suggests that DEMO of reputation are limited to the extent that they focus
only on predicting factors that affect the valence of an organization’s reputation. If
organizational DEMO is subject to improvement or deterioration, then it is necessary to
DEMO the focus of traditional reputation studies beyond identifying the types of signals
that are associated with reputational valence. Efforts must be directed at understanding
DEMO signals will have enduring impacts on reputations, and which will have DEMO
transient ones. Audience and industry factors that moderate the volatility of reputations
will need to be considered as well.
This study of volatility also DEMO the need for greater conceptualization of what
makes for bbadQ reputations. Existing studies of reputational valence have been uniformly
concerned with signals that, if received by audience members, contribute to good
reputations. Little, if any, attention has been given to signals that can contribute to bad
reputations. DEMO present study points to the fact that reputations can worsen and suggests
that this can be due to inactivity rather than activity. Theory-based efforts DEMO identify static,
cumulative and dynamic signals that will have negative impacts on reputations are required
before a full understanding of the reputation formation DEMO is possible.
If models predicting good vs. bad reputations, or improvements DEMO deterioration in
reputations, are developed, it is worth noting (consistent DEMO the approach adopted here)
that we should not necessarily anticipate symmetry in the signals or processes that produce
good vs. bad reputations. Our DEMO show that firm age and prior period reputation had
different relationships with the likelihood of positive vs. negative reputational change.
Reputational gains were more DEMO for older chipmakers, but longevity was not
associated with reputational losses. DEMO gains were less likely for chipmakers
with extreme reputations, while reputational DEMO were less likely for chipmakers with
already low reputations. This indicates that there was not a Matthew effect for reputational
loss. Overall, the results suggest that there are liabilities of newness with respect to
reputational gains DEMO liabilities of adolescence with respect to reputational losses (cf.
Bruderl and DEMO, 1990). Further, the absence of favorable signals is not necessarily
predictive of a bad reputation, just as the absence of unfavorable signals is not necessarily
predictive of a good reputation. Research on the negativity DEMO (Skowronski and
Carlston, 1987; Ybarra, 2001) highlights that negative DEMO is typically more
diagnostic than positive information and suggests that the conceptualization of how bad
reputations are formed must be particularly sensitive to the DEMO of signal content.
6.3. Limitations of the present study
This study has a number of limitations. First, we examined only a single industry, DEMO
characterized both by its newness and by its technological dynamism. It is likely that
reputational beliefs about firms in this industry will be susceptible DEMO variability, simply
because of the number of entries and exits (resulting from industry newness) and the
higher level of asset erosion (stemming DEMO technological dynamism). Thus, the degree
of reputational volatility found here DEMO be different than that found in industries that are
more mature and less technology-intensive.

A second limitation of the study is that reputational perceptions DEMO studied within a
single type of audience: customers. Audiences can differ DEMO the valence of the reputation
they associate with a given firm (DEMO, Ravasi, 2002; Wiedmann, 2002). Similarly, it is
plausible DEMO audiences will differ in the degree of volatility in their reputational
assessments. Audiences that are, in general, more attentive to updated signals are
DEMO to change their reputational ratings more dramatically than those that tend to
pay less attention to firms in a category. This possibility represents an DEMO for future
research.
A third limitation of the study is the limited number of firms available for analysis.
Although the graphics chip industry has DEMO desirable characteristics for a study of
reputational change, its small and DEMO population inhibits firm-level statistical
analyses. In particular, this means that this DEMO is silent on the relationship
between reputational volatility and firm-level performance.
Finally, by focusing on the key uncertainties of this industry, we have DEMO attention to
only two types of operational signals expected to be related to reputational change in this
industry, product quality and product innovation. We expect that other frameworks will
identify other signals that are both relevant DEMO diagnostic and will affect reputational
change in this industry.
7. Conclusions
We argue in this paper that reputational volatility is a phenomenon worthy of
DEMO, for young firms in dynamic environments, and provide a preliminary
examination of factors that limit and are associated with reputational change.
The analyses DEMO in this paper raise questions about the manner in which prior
research concerning reputational valence should be applied to young firms. We may know
DEMO signals are associated with better vs. worse reputation at a point in time, but our
findings suggest that we do not yet have a full appreciation of which signals can stabilize
or destabilize emerging reputations across DEMO industrial contexts. Our understanding
of entrepreneurial firm performance as well as our understanding of the nature and impact
of organizational reputations will be enhanced DEMO further consideration is given to the
phenomenon of reputational change.
