ABSTRACT
Scholars have studied how entrepreneurs acquire resources but have not
examined how resources may be bundled with constraints, which can
threaten entrepreneurial autonomy. Organizational sponsors, such as
incubators and accelerators, provide entrepreneurs with DEMO, but
how do entrepreneurs sustain autonomy while seeking resources and sup-
DEMO? We studied ﬁve entrepreneurial ﬁrms in a business incubator over a
DEMO period. While beneﬁtting from incubator resources, entrepre-
neurs also experienced unexpected DEMO, including mentor role
conﬂict, gatekeeper control, and afﬁliation dissonance. By DEMO how
entrepreneurs unbundled the incubator’s resources from constraints, we

One challenge for entrepreneurs starting new ventures is how to gather the
resources needed to pursue DEMO opportunities (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
Baker & Nelson, 2005; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Singh, Tucker, &
House, 1986)DEMO By deﬁnition, entrepreneurs are under-resourced (Stevenson &
Jarillo, 1990), and thus those wishing to be successful ﬁgure out early on that
DEMO will need the help of many others (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). In
addition to capital investment, entrepreneurs seek support to craft their new
role, validate their business model, and mobilize social networks to DEMO
and secure new suppliers and customers (Katila, Rosenberger, & Eisenhardt,DEMO
2008; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; Zott & Huy, 2007). The generation of
personal wealth is not the only motivator for entrepreneurship (Graebner &
Eisenhardt, 2004). In addition to creating wealth, social change, or other
forms of value, one reason many entrepreneurs launch DEMO ventures is to
create and control their own organization (Rindova, Barry, & Ketchen,
2009). Rindova and colleagues call attention to the emancipatory dreams of
entrepreneurs who seek to “escape from or remove perceived DEMO
(Rindova et al., 2009, p. 480) as a vital and under-appreciated motivator to
starting new ventures. They argue that what is core DEMO entrepreneurs’ motiva-
tion is the pursuit of freedom and autonomy.
Few entrepreneurs can successfully launch a venture entirely on their
own, and most will rely on the support of outside individuals and organiza-
tions to obtain DEMO and increase their chances of survival (Aldrich &
Ruef, 2006; Stinchcombe, 1965). When entrepreneurs initiate new ventures,
they typically seek mentoring, capital, and other resources from a diverse
array of informal DEMO (such as friends, family, and business associ-
ates) as well as from formal organizations (such as investors, government
agencies, business incubators, and venture accelerators). Traditionally, as
many as one quarter of DEMO ventures have obtained support from one or
more of these formal types of organizational sponsors (Reynolds, 1997;
Help Me Do It on My Own
…
279
Thornton, 1999). Organizational sponsors help “mediate the relationship
between new organizations and their environments” DEMO providing resources
intended to increase ﬁrm survival rates (Amezcua, Grimes, DEMO, &
Wiklund, 2013, p. 1628).
Organizational sponsors differ in the range and type of resources they
provide to entrepreneurs and the DEMO associated with that support.
Government loan programs and investors typically provide capital with the
promise of achieving speciﬁc milestones, while incubators and accelerators
may offer capital along with a variety of social resources such as network-
DEMO, mentoring and shared ofﬁce space, with less-speciﬁed constraints
(Cohen, 2013; Leblebici & Shah, 2004). From 2000 to 2012, the number of
incubators increased by 50% in the United States, and applications to incu-
bators doubled (Needleman & Maltby, 2012). If it is DEMO that entrepre-
neurs’ desire for autonomy is a central motivation to launching a new
venture, then it is puzzling why so many entrepreneurs seek support from
sponsoring organizations such as incubators and accelerators. One explana-
tion DEMO the demand side is that entrepreneurs increasingly seek the social
beneﬁts that can stem from interacting with their peers within such organi-
zations. An DEMO on the supply side is that investors are interested in
gaining early access to investment opportunities and incubators and accel-
erators can help them DEMO the viability of new ventures and reduce
the risks associated with potential investment.
From our perspective, the more interesting question is not why incuba-
tors are so popular but, rather, what takes place within an DEMO four
walls. If it is the interactions between organizational sponsors and entrepre-
neurs that are purported to create value, then understanding this process is
critical. Collaboration in the pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities is
essential for success, yet entrepreneurs also seek autonomy when launching
their new ventures. How both DEMO and entrepreneurs recognize,
adapt to, or address this tension is DEMO “Previous research
has emphasized the need for entrepreneurs to mobilize resources to accom-
plish objectives but it has not fully explicated the consequences of DEMO
‘strings attached’ that come with these resources” (Rindova et al., 2009:
484). While the “strings attached” with formal investment decisions are
DEMO clearly codiﬁed, the “strings attached” in managing embedded rela-
tionships (Uzzi, 1996) are less so. There are beneﬁts to be gained from DEMO
relational capital that organizational sponsorship can provide, but it also
may DEMO becoming embedded in a web of social relations can constrain
as well as enable an entrepreneur’s autonomy (Granovetter, 1985;
Uzzi, 1996).
280 VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.
Despite the awareness that resources often DEMO with “strings attached,”
there has been tremendous fanfare about the role business incubators and
venture accelerators play in helping entrepreneurs without an appreciation
DEMO how the twin desires to both seek autonomy and support may conﬂict.
How do entrepreneurs sustain their autonomy while seeking resources and
support from DEMO sponsoring organization? To answer this question, our
research examines how entrepreneurs make use of incubator resources
while trying to maintain their autonomy and DEMO independent ventures.
We conducted six months of ﬁeld research at a Silicon Valley business incu-
bator which hosted entrepreneurs and their new ventures. While DEMO of
the incubator’s value in supporting nascent ventures was in line with theo-
retical expectations, we also observed ways in which resources were
bundled with constraints, threatening entrepreneurs’ autonomy. In
response, we discovered that both DEMO and incubator staff used
distinct practices to unbundle resources from their associated constraints.
Our research provides a grounded theoretical explanation of how a speciﬁc
DEMO of embedded relationship, organizational sponsorship, not only pro-
vides resources but also involves constraints on entrepreneurial behavior.
We show how entrepreneurs and sponsors DEMO to unbundle resources
from constraints so that entrepreneurs can exert their autonomy while cul-
tivating resources to support their nascent ventures.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND AUTONOMY
DEMO desire for autonomy has been consistently cited as one of the primary
reasons that individuals choose to become entrepreneurs. Early theories of
entrepreneurship emphasized DEMO entrepreneurs shared a “desire for inde-
pendence” (Collins & Moore, 1964, p. 93). A survey of 405 owner-operators
of growth-oriented ventures found that, on average, the highest ranked
reason for starting a new DEMO was to have freedom in the way the foun-
der worked (DEMO & Westhead, 1994). In a more recent study, the desire
for independence was, on average, the highest ranked reason for starting DEMO
business (Carter, Gartner, Shaver, & Gatewood, 2003). While DEMO
et al. (2009) deﬁne this desire for autonomy as breaking free from the
authority of another, the reality is that entrepreneurs depend on many
others, such as suppliers, customers and investors, for resources.
A large body of literature elaborates on the vulnerability of nascent
ﬁrms and DEMO how the viability of nascent ﬁrms depends on the ability of
Help Me Do It on My Own
281
entrepreneurs to manage relationships DEMO others in their environment
(Baum & Oliver, 1991; Eisenhardt & DEMO, 1996; Ozcan &
Eisenhardt, 2009). Resource dependence scholars have long argued that
reliance on resources can drive ﬁrms to seek ties DEMO others to increase
their organization’s viability (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). For example, ﬁrms
that established alliances with an array of actors, DEMO as universities,
research institutions, marketing ﬁrms, or other companies exhibited signiﬁ-
cantly higher growth (Baum, Calabrese, & Silverman, 2000). DEMO ﬁrm’s abil-
ity to draw upon a diverse portfolio of organizational partners can be quite
valuable and enhance a ﬁrm’s ability to innovate and DEMO viability
(Powell, Koput, & Smith-Doerr, 1996; Powell, White, DEMO, & Owen-
Smith, 2005).
While the need to garner support for nascent ventures from other orga-
nizations is well documented, what is less explored is the degree to which
resources, once acquired, place DEMO on the entrepreneur’s autonomy
over his or her venture. Entrepreneurs dependent on organizational spon-
sors can face emergent constraints similar to those embedded in DEMO
social networks. For example, ﬁrms in New York City’s garment district
DEMO the beneﬁts of joint problem solving from the dense social networks
within which they were embedded, but those ﬁrms also faced constraints
that ﬁrms in arm’s-length relationships did not (Uzzi, 1996). Rindova and
colleagues DEMO that “individuals who seek freedom and independence often
ﬁnd that they become controlled by the arrangements they make to gain
legitimacy and access to DEMO (Rindova et al., 2009, p. 483). Yet, little
research has examined how entrepreneurs negotiate the tension between
seeking independence on the DEMO hand and relying on others for resources
and support on the other hand.
While the entrepreneurship literature has long been aware of entrepre-
neurs’ DEMO for autonomy and independence, scholars have not reconciled
this need with DEMO growing interest in organizational sponsors
such as accelerators and incubators. Incubators and accelerators differ
from other types of organizational sponsorship  such as investors DEMO in
that they require frequent interaction between the organization and the
entrepreneurs they are supporting. Because hosted ﬁrms are typically
embedded in incubators and DEMO at a shared physical premise, if
there is tension between entrepreneurs’ DEMO for autonomy and the con-
straints placed on them from a sponsoring organization, this tension would
likely be ampliﬁed in this context. Thus, DEMO provide a rich setting
in which to examine the tensions that arise from entrepreneurs’ twin desires
of autonomy and support, and to examine how this tension is addressed.

ENTREPRENEURS AND ORGANIZATIONAL
SPONSORSHIP
Organizational sponsors, such as business incubators and venture accelera-
tors, mediate the relationship between new organizations and their environ-
ments by creating a “resource-muniﬁcent context intended DEMO increase
survival rates among those organizations” (Amezcua et al., 2013, DEMO 1628).
Organizational sponsorship can enhance ﬁrm survival rates in two ways: by
either buffering nascent ﬁrms from the harsh realities of their environment
or by providing a bridge between nascent ﬁrms and the relational connec-
DEMO critical to their survival (Amezcua et al., 2013; Baum & DEMO, 1991).
For example, organizational sponsors such as business incubators can buf-
fer new ﬁrms by offering infrastructural and business support that would
DEMO be prohibitive. They can also enhance new ventures’ social capi-
tal (DEMO & Stewart, 2002) by acting as a conduit to critical network
resources. The general assumption is that a sponsor’s social networks can
remove DEMO barriers to resource providers and grant preferential
access to the types of social connections that new organizations may lack
(Baum & Oliver, 1991; Leblebici & Shah, 2004).
Both venture accelerators and business incubators are models of organi-
zational sponsorship where entrepreneurs can receive mentorship and other
DEMO helpful to the development of new ventures (Cohen, 2013;
Leblebici & Shah, 2004). While venture accelerators focus on taking a
cohort of entrepreneurs from initial concept to a business plan within a ﬁxed
DEMO period, business incubators focus on accepting entrepreneurs and their
team after DEMO business opportunity has already been identiﬁed. Incubators
provide a physical space and prepare ventures to acquire ﬁnancial backing
and eventual independence from the incubator. DEMO their forms differ
slightly (Cohen, 2013), in both cases organizational sponsorship is generally
understood to be a temporary relationship targeting the very DEMO stages
of a new venture, when ventures are at their most DEMO to failure. The
aim is to help the venture pass through the rocky ﬁrst stages of formation to
transition successfully into an independent venture.
DEMO incubators in the United States date from the 1950s, and they
DEMO initially non-proﬁt organizations representing attempts by local gov-
ernments to promote regional small business development (Allen &
McCluskey, 1990). Entrepreneurs typically seek admission to an incubator
in return for payment which may be direct DEMO through an equity stake in
the enterprise (Leblebici & Shah, 2004; Rice, 2002). Business incubators
Help Me Do It on My Own

283
vary in the DEMO of their engagement with entrepreneurs  from
“laissez-faire” to “strong intervention” (DEMO & Norrman, 2008).
Historically, incubators provided limited resources such as shared space
and business services (Leblebici & Shah, 2004). Over DEMO, incubators have
evolved to take on mentoring, networking, education, and even investment
roles (Allen & McCluskey, 1990; Hansen, Chesbrough, Nohria, & Sull,
2000; Leblebici & Shah, 2004). This change has ignited academic interest in
incubators as unique organizations that give rise DEMO new organizations
themselves (Leblebici & Shah, 2004).
Prior research on business incubators has identiﬁed four primary bene-
ﬁts that incubators extend to DEMO: mentoring, brokering, legiti-
macy, and shared physical resources (Allen & McCluskey, 1990; Hansen
et al., 2000; Leblebici & Shah, DEMO). First, mentoring services may take the
form of advice on DEMO to reﬁne a business plan, approach possible inves-
tors, or write a marketing plan. Second, incubators may provide entrepre-
neurs with preferential access to network resources that would otherwise be
difﬁcult for a nascent ﬁrm DEMO access. Third, incubators can confer legiti-
macy to the founder which DEMO indirectly affect others willingness to invest
in the new ﬁrm; as DEMO been pointed out in prior research, “When there is
extensive competition DEMO potential entrepreneurs to get the attention
and advice of those who have the resources, membership [in an incubator]
provides the legitimacy needed to summon the help of those who are in cri-
tical decision-making positions” (Leblebici & Shah, 2004, p. 369). Fourth,
but perhaps least DEMO, incubators help nascent ventures reduce their
administrative overhead costs by sharing DEMO space and associated
infrastructure.
The role of incubators as funders, coaches DEMO mentors to entrepreneurs
has grown, but how they create value for DEMO remains under-
studied. The extant research has been largely atheoretical and focused on
either the conﬁguration or attributes of incubators (Hackett & Dilts, DEMO)
or incubator outcomes (Bergek & Norrman, 2008). Little scholarship exam-
ines the processes and interactions that take place inside incubators which
DEMO entrepreneurial opportunities into independent ventures. It is pre-
cisely these interactions, DEMO, that are proposed to create the most
value: “If the area of incubator-incubation research is to advance in a theo-
retically meaningful manner DEMO simple lists of critical success factors,
then we must turn our attention from ‘what’ are the important factors to
‘how’ and ‘why’ and DEMO what context’ these factors are interrelated”
(Hackett & Dilts, 2004, DEMO 74). In other words, what is needed is a focus DEMO

the dynamic processes that take place DEMO incubators rather than on
their static features or outcomes. We need to understand how organiza-
tional sponsors engage and support entrepreneurs and the expectations
DEMO which this support is received. Thus, we examined how ﬁve entrepre-
DEMO ﬁrms hosted by a single incubator interacted with incubator staff
while attempting to create independent ventures.
RESEARCH SETTING AND METHODS
The primary research setting DEMO this study was a high-technology business
incubator located in the Silicon Valley region of California. We refer to the
incubator as Incupro and individual DEMO have been changed for the pur-
pose of this study. The incubator started operations eight months prior to
the start of this study, and it was funded by a medium-sized venture capital
ﬁrm which had the DEMO of investing in incubated ﬁrms but had no obli-
gation to do so. The incubator’s business model was to earn revenue
through a combination DEMO monthly payments from incubated ventures
along with gaining early access to potential investment opportunities in the
incubated ﬁrms. The incubator employed a director, Tim, to manage opera-
tions. Company founders would contact Tim if they were interested in
space in the incubator, and he could charge them a per-month fee for the
use of ofﬁce space or he could negotiate DEMO in their company in lieu of
rent. Physically, Incupro occupied the DEMO three ﬂoors of a multistory build-
ing in a vibrant suburban downtown area.
The director, Tim, had twelve years of experience forming ventures DEMO
Silicon Valley and many years of prior experience leading large organiza-
tions. He referred to himself as “a gray-hair,” one who had participated DEMO
several ventures in Silicon Valley over the years. In addition to Tim, there
were three other people on staff: a deputy director, who focused on an
internal venture fund for the incubator; a part-time chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer
(CFO) who provided ad-hoc advice to incubated companies; and a full-
time ofﬁce manager, who handled general administration for the incubator.
The ﬁve incubated companies we studied were all technology-focused
and ranged in DEMO from 2 to about 15 employees, but varied in their pro-
DEMO offerings: Digitech, in digital appliances; Optico, in optical compo-
nents (both cofounders were interviewed); Geotech, in mapping
applications; Earthtech, DEMO outsourcing software; and Worldtech, in global
marketing applications. We interviewed six founders from these ﬁve ﬁrms

who were all new DEMO founding and leading a company in Silicon Valley.
Tim planned to host companies on the premises of the incubator for
approximately six months; they would “graduate” when they secured
venture-backed funding. At the onset of this DEMO, there were eight compa-
nies incubated and no companies had yet DEMO During the course of
data collection, two companies graduated and three DEMO companies joined
the incubator.
We employed a grounded-theory approach to our study (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967) drawing on ﬁeld observation, interviews, DEMO archival data.
Field data at the primary research site, Incupro, were collected over the
course of six months, taking the form of ﬁeld notes from both scheduled
meetings and general observation, from e-mail message archives, and from
various incubator and start-up documentation, such as investor presenta-
DEMO One author served as ﬁeld researcher and was given keys to the build-
ing, a cubicle at the incubator, and was on the DEMO distribution list for
all messages sent from the director to his distribution list of founders. Over
100 e-mail messages sent by the director were DEMO during the course of
the study. On average, observations were made DEMO over the course of
the six months, with over ﬁfty hours DEMO direct observation. This six-month
window of observation was about the length of time that ﬁrms were
expected to make use of the incubator, giving us a longitudinal view of the
range of interactions between entrepreneurs and DEMO staff during the
process of incubation.
Semi-structured interview data were gathered from the entrepreneur
founders of the ﬁve companies incubated at the research setting, as well as
from two members of the incubator management team. In DEMO, inter-
views were conducted with the directors of six other incubators, to under-
stand incubator activities and processes more broadly. The ﬁrst author
DEMO observational data, but for ease of presentation, the collective will
be used when describing observations.
The primary ﬁeld researcher ﬁrst proposed a set DEMO codes to explain the
activities within the incubator. A second researcher used the qualitative
coding software nVivo to independently analyze the transcripts and obser-
DEMO data. All authors discussed elements of disagreement and the reﬁn-
ing of codes and categories as needed. In doing so, we discovered that
while entrepreneurs experienced many of the types of incubator beneﬁts
suggested by extant DEMO, entrepreneurs also experienced signiﬁcant
constraints on their autonomy in ways that DEMO not predicted by the exist-
ing literature. We identiﬁed three different types of threats to entrepre-
neurs’ autonomy: mentor role conﬂict, gatekeeper control, and afﬁliation

dissonance. Incubated ﬁrms experienced mentor role DEMO when there
was disagreement as to the incubator’s role as a source of expertise to the
entrepreneur. Incubated ﬁrms confronted gatekeeper control when the
DEMO overstepped the boundaries of their role as a resource broker for
the entrepreneur. Finally, all incubated ﬁrms experienced afﬁliation disso-
nance, where afﬁliation DEMO the entrepreneur and incubator was
viewed as no longer beneﬁcial but rather as constraining.
We analyzed how entrepreneurs and incubator staff worked to address
DEMO different threats to autonomy and how they crafted collaborative, but
distinct, practices to resolve them. We distinguished between the practices
that entrepreneurs and DEMO staff engaged in and attended closely to
the events that ignited those practices. We maintained tables comparing
data from interviews and observations in order DEMO triangulate across data
sources and the ﬁve ﬁrms studied. We discovered that all entrepreneurs in
our study often met with unexpected constraints imposed by DEMO incubator
but worked to preserve their autonomy by unbundling resources from these
constraints, and we identify the conditions that enabled this process.
MANAGING AUTONOMY AND CONSTRAINT WITHIN
A BUSINESS INCUBATOR
First, we brieﬂy describe the beneﬁts the incubator we studied provided to
the ﬁve entrepreneurial ﬁrms, which largely conﬁrms prior research on the
potential value that sponsoring organizations can provide. DEMO, and less
expected, our interviews and observational data revealed three types of
threats to autonomy that arose as entrepreneurs worked with incubator
staff. DEMO, we inductively identiﬁed the practices both entrepreneurs and
incubator staff used DEMO address these threats, allowing entrepreneurs to pre-
serve their autonomy while DEMO the resources needed to develop their
nascent ventures.
Resources and Support for Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs entered the incubator with typically three months to a year
DEMO experience on their own. Immediately after joining the incubator, entre-
preneurs DEMO experiencing clear beneﬁts such as mentoring from

Incupro’s professional staff, gaining access to a broader resource network,
and being seen as DEMO legitimate by other critical stakeholders.
Expertise Mentoring
Entrepreneurs valued the mentorship they received from the Incupro direc-
tor and his team. While the entrepreneurs DEMO studied sought advice to dif-
fering degrees, we observed many examples DEMO founders making regular use
of mentorship from the incubator staff. One incubator staff member we
interviewed noted how they tried to mentor their resident DEMO, stating
that: “We had a whole process that we set up to train and prepare these
people for the venture shows.” We observed DEMO sharing his experience
with the founder of Worldtech, showing him how DEMO it was to estab-
lish a set of “back-up charts” that could be called upon when pitching a
business plan to potential investors. As DEMO further example, we observed that
the co-founder of Optico used the DEMO director’s advice on many
occasions, and, upon graduation, he provided DEMO public endorsement of
the incubator.
Resource Brokering
Entrepreneurs valued both the formal and informal resource brokering
activities that Incupro staff made available. Resource brokering DEMO
formally when Incupro’s director scheduled and participated in meetings
between entrepreneurs and his network of early-stage “Angel” investors.
For example, breakfast meetings with potential Angel investors not only
helped legitimate the ﬁrms hosted by the director’s DEMO, they also
served as a formal means to connect entrepreneurs to DEMO investors.
The founder of Worldtech noted that “one of the good things about being
here is that [Tim] introduces you to others that he DEMO would be an asset
to the company . And [Tim] comes in contact with a lot of different indi-
viduals.” Resource brokering also occurred DEMO when Incupro
hosted well-attended roof-top cocktail parties, that allowed investors,
DEMO, and other Silicon Valley professionals to interact on their
own initiatives. DEMO founder of Worldtech reﬂected that he must have
“come away with probably eight or ten [business] cards” from guests at one
party. Incubator staff DEMO instrumental at bringing their network to bear
for their entrepreneurs, with DEMO, the director, stating, “You can open
doors [as an incubator DEMO member companies] through phone calls and
e-mails. Two guys, three guys DEMO a garage, probably wouldn’t get a return
call.” The co-founder and DEMO of Optico noted that four of their initial
investors were directly from the director’s contacts.

Endorsing Ventures
Entrepreneurs DEMO that their membership in the incubator was per-
ceived as an endorsement which increased the legitimacy of their ventures
immediately upon joining. Incubator directors DEMO that this endorse-
ment was a key resource they could provide to their ventures. One incu-
bator director stated: “What [incubated companies] are able to say is
that somebody has let them into their very selective DEMO [and]
is investing their time in the future success of that company.” This senti-
ment was seconded by the ﬁrms accepted into Incupro. As DEMO co-founder
and CEO of Optico reﬂected, “So the professionalism part really DEMO
in and Angel investors looked at it and said, ‘Hey, you guys look like
you [have] got momentum here.’ And the only difference DEMO now we
went from being in the living room to being in the ofﬁce ” Although
Optico’s progress toward product milestones had not changed DEMO
cantly, their image in the eyes of others had, much as Zott and Huy
(2007) would predict. Similarly, the founder of Worldtech noted, “We
just put in [the incubator’s] address, and it obviously DEMO like we were
upgrading.” Incubator staff also actively endorsed the ventures they
hosted. At a meeting for Angel investors, the Incupro director presented
a slide with the logos of numerous “Incupro Partners” who were law
ﬁrms DEMO venture capitalists well known in Silicon Valley. On the next
slide, DEMO director included logos of “Incupro Companies” housed in the
incubator. By presenting the partners and ventures side-by-side, he tried
to connect these nascent ventures to more established partners in order
to increase the legitimacy of the DEMO he hosted. As the Co-founder and
CEO of Optico noted, “Being DEMO to help us secure funding from angel
investors [was a beneﬁt] because of the credibility we had [from
the incubator].”
Beneﬁts to the Incubator DEMO
Expertise mentoring, resource brokering, and endorsing ventures were three
activities that incubators provided to entrepreneurs, but these activities
beneﬁted the incubator as well. The ﬁnancial model of the incubator relied
on collecting payments in the DEMO of rent or equity stakes in some of the
ventures they incubated. The venture capital ﬁrm that established Incupro
used the incubator as a DEMO to gain preferential access to early-stage
investment opportunities. In return for the support the incubator provided,
investors received a close up view of DEMO evolution of the ﬁrms for their six
months in residence which improved the efﬁciency of investors’ due dili-
gence efforts.
Help Me Do It on My Own 289
Incubator staff received non-monetary DEMO from the ﬁrms they
hosted as well. By being exposed to the range of challenges facing their
entrepreneurs, Incupro staff could stay at the forefront of the relevant issues
facing start-up teams in Silicon Valley. The DEMO of Incupro often stated
how involvement in prior ventures on current issues kept his start-up
knowledge up-to-date. By acting as a broker of resources, Incupro staff
were able to occupy structural positions that increased their relevance
DEMO their professional network. By endorsing a range of new entrepre-
neurial ﬁrms, the legitimacy of the incubator could be heightened if these
ﬁrms turned out to be successful. Given the existing research on entrepre-
neurs and DEMO, none of these beneﬁts are particularly surprising for
either entrepreneurs or DEMO incubator staff. All entrepreneurs were quick to
point to these three beneﬁts as reasons to be at Incupro. What has been less
appreciated in DEMO research are the ways in which incubators can con-
strain entrepreneurs’ autonomy and how those constraints are resolved.
Bundling Resources and Constraints
Entrepreneurs soon DEMO that the incubator’s resources were sometimes
bundled with constraints. Expertise mentoring could be accompanied with
the expectation that the entrepreneur follow the advice given. DEMO
brokering could happen with the expectation that the entrepreneur accept
funding from an investor selected by the incubator. Conferring legitimacy
by endorsing ventures in DEMO incubator could conﬂate the identities of the
entrepreneur’s venture and the incubator. The incubator offered abundant
resources, but these resources could be bundled with expectations that the
entrepreneur act in accordance with the incubator’s wishes. When DEMO
constraints materialized, Incupro’s actions compromised entrepreneurs’
autonomy over decisions critical to DEMO ventures, threatening entrepre-
neurs’ ability to craft ventures independent from the DEMO As shown
in Table 1, we identiﬁed three types of threats DEMO entrepreneurs’ autonomy:
mentor role conﬂict, gatekeeper control, and afﬁliation dissonance, which
are examined in turn.
Mentor Role Conﬂict
While incubator staff were viewed as capable of offering relevant expertise
and mentoring to the entrepreneurs DEMO residence, sometimes incubator staff
overstepped the boundaries of their supporting roles. DEMO deﬁned mentor
role conﬂict as disagreement as to the incubator’s role as a source of

expertise as opposed to DEMO source of direction to entrepreneurs. As the fol-
lowing example from Optico’s CEO demonstrates, at times, entrepreneurs
felt that the incubator staff were DEMO their advice with the expectation
that entrepreneurs act on that advice even if it ran counter to how the
entrepreneur wished to run their DEMO
At a critical time in the ﬁrm’s funding cycle, the Optico DEMO entered
into a heated exchange with the incubator director because the director had
told Optico employees that he thought their CEO was traveling too DEMO
when they were nearing the closing of a funding round. At the end of a
meeting in which the Optico CEO was seeking help DEMO the Incupro direc-
tor and deputy director on how to draft a fax cover sheet to a lead angel
investor, we observed the following exchange:
The computer was shut down and the three men sat DEMO their chairs, loosely around the
table, leaning back. It was clear there was more to say, and the CEO started off that he
did want to go over something more. In his loud baritone voice, the CEO stated to Tim
“You think I travel too much,” DEMO up with the remark that he wanted to know
why that was the case.
Tim responded that yes he had been worried about his DEMO last week during what he
thought would be the closing week for his funding and that he had asked the CEO’s
colleagues, “Where the [expletive] is your CEO?!”
The CEO replied that he had a DEMO issues with how Tim responded, the ﬁrst and most
important was DEMO it made him look in front of his employees. Tim said he was sorry
to have “blown up” in front of them. Tim explained DEMO the CEO’s employees later that
it was no big deal that [the CEO was] not around, it’s just that if I was your CEO, I
would not be away the week I was closing. (From DEMO notes of 9/29)
The Optico CEO felt that his role as CEO of his own ﬁrm was compro-
mised when the incubator DEMO expressed his displeasure over the
CEO’s performance directly to Optico employees. Conﬂict over the bound-
aries of the incubator director’s role as mentor seemed DEMO spill-over to other
members of the ﬁrm as well. Earlier that month, the other co-founder
returned to his desk after meeting with Tim, DEMO and stating “I’m
not going up [to his ofﬁce] anymore.” He didn’t know how to balance the
advice of the incubator director with his DEMO own opinion as to what
needed to be done to make their venture succeed. We observed repeated
episodes where incubator staff’s mentorship across broad DEMO was
bundled with the expectation that the entrepreneur or the founding team
act in accordance with their advice. Entrepreneurs found this expectation
to be DEMO threat to their autonomy and to their ability to make decisions as
they saw ﬁt.

Gatekeeper Control
Disagreement as to the DEMO role as a resource broker for entrepre-
neurs led to another threat to entrepreneurs’ autonomy, as summarized in
Table 1. While entrepreneurs valued the ability of incubator staff to broker
connections to potential investors and customers, they did not want to be
obligated to use those connections. On DEMO other hand, incubator staff rea-
lized that social capital was not DEMO a renewable resource: if they
exhausted their social networks to help DEMO or two ventures, they might
saturate their network, compromising their ability to make future introduc-
tions. Thus, if incubator staff made an introduction, they wanted to know
what type of exchange was produced, as DEMO might affect their ability to help
other ventures. This interest in supporting a number of ventures equally led
them to engage in gatekeeper control DEMO without realizing the effect
on individual entrepreneurs. For example, we observed DEMO meeting the
Incupro staff brokered between the Geotech founder and potential Angel
investors where the deputy director of Incupro stated to the investor that DEMO
am basically acting as their CEO.” This implied to the investors that he, as
incubator staff, could make decisions on how Geotech was DEMO (which
was far from the case). This proved to be DEMO on-going source of frustration
to both the Angel investor and the Geotech entrepreneur as they negotiated
the terms of a possible funding arrangement, which in the end, did not
work out. Geotech eventually received funding, DEMO from the investor
arranged by the incubator, but from an alternative DEMO
When incubator staff acted as a resource broker, entrepreneurs valued
the DEMO connections made. But when incubator staff stepped beyond
their broker role, DEMO the right to make introductions with the right
to represent the ﬁrm or make decisions on the ﬁrm’s behalf, entrepreneurs’
decision-making authority over their own ventures was compromised and
their autonomy constrained. Incubator staff were gatekeepers, ready to
introduce entrepreneurs to their rich networks in the Silicon Valley DEMO
tem, but when they bundled those connections with the constraint (and
expectation) that the entrepreneur use those resources as incubator staff
saw ﬁt, entrepreneurs felt subject to gatekeeper control.
Afﬁliation Dissonance
A third type of threat to entrepreneurs’ autonomy arose when afﬁliation
between the entrepreneur and the DEMO was viewed as constraining; we
refer to this as afﬁliation dissonance DEMO Table 1. Early in the entrepreneur’s
relationship with the incubator, the DEMO endorsement and afﬁliation
was viewed as valuable to all entrepreneurs. However, DEMO later times,
Help Me Do It on My Own
…

293
entrepreneurs experienced DEMO in their afﬁliation and sought to dis-
tance their ventures from the incubator, in order to assert their indepen-
dence. For example, the DEMO and CEO of Optico explained that he
moved away from using his association with the incubator in later rounds
of ﬁnancing, in part because: “Tim is very dramatic which is a great
marketing tool [but investors] hate being dramatic and that reﬂects as
our company being dramatic.” While DEMO ﬁrm had made good use of
Incupro resources in their earliest stages, as the ﬁrm matured, the Optico
CEO found that bundling his DEMO afﬁliation with the incubator was
not necessarily in line with the identity he sought for his ﬁrm.
In summary, as entrepreneurs sought resources from the incubator, they
found these resources to be readily available, but DEMO bundled with con-
straints on their use, leading to three types DEMO threats to their autonomy:
mentor role conﬂict, gatekeeper control, and afﬁliation dissonance. As
incubator staff and entrepreneurs gained more experience working
together, they adapted their practices in order to unbundle resources from
constraints. An DEMO of the process is given in Fig. 1 and the practices
are detailed below.
Unbundling Resources from Constraints
Over the six-month period observed, entrepreneurs and incubator staff
made adjustments to their practices to mitigate against potential DEMO
Both parties shared a common interest in eventually creating an indepen-
dent venture, even when the roles of help provider and help-seeker became

unbundle resources from constraints and reduce DEMO to entrepreneurs’
autonomy. These practices had beneﬁts for both entrepreneurs and incuba-
tor staff. We outline these practices in Table 2 and describe each DEMO of
practices in turn.
Practices Addressing Mentor Role Conﬂict
Expertise mentoring at Incupro was focused on providing guidance to
entrepreneurs on how to structure, fund, and manage their ventures. Much
mentoring was done face-to-face in the director’s ofﬁce, but unsolicited
advice was also distributed via regular e-mail to founders, to which we had
access. When expertise mentoring was bundled with expectations as to how
the entrepreneur should manage their ﬁrm, mentor role conﬂict often
emerged. To reduce mentor role conﬂict and create a productive DEMO
ship, each party adjusted their practices. First, entrepreneurs began to
proactively solicit help on speciﬁc business problems rather than broad
advice on their DEMO as ﬁrm founders. Second, incubator staff began to con-
fer ultimate DEMO rights to the entrepreneur and his team  especially
when they were prompted for advice.
Entrepreneurs: Seek Problem-Focused Advice
Entrepreneurs were able to receive and make the best use of the incubator’s
advice when the entrepreneur DEMO a speciﬁc problem to the incubator
staff and sought advice on how to address that issue. In some cases, this
entailed actually collaborating on a speciﬁc task, such as when the CEO of
Optico sought help communicating a difﬁcult change of plans to his inves-
tor. Over the DEMO of an hour-and-a-half, the CEO, the incubator direc-
tor, and DEMO deputy director worked out different ways to frame and
communicate the sensitive issue to the investor:
The Incupro Deputy Director asked “is there DEMO you need to qualify the proto-
type?” to which the Optico CEO replied it was ‘a good question’ and they began to
address DEMO aspect. As the Deputy Director, Tim, and the CEO worked together to
craft phrasing for the letter, Tim said to the CEO: DEMO back if you don’t agree!”
“No, no, I agree,” agreed the CEO, “but I’m concentrating on typing with three ﬁn-
gers!” At this point, the Deputy Director suggested he could take over the typing, as he
can touch type.
The Optico CEO began pacing as he and the Deputy Director continued to provide
much of the text; the Deputy Director had not slowed down in his input since sitting

Help Me Do It on My Own 297
We observed a DEMO dynamic during sessions with the founders of
Geotech, Worldtech, and Digitech. Seeking problem-focused advice also
helped incubator staff leverage their scarce resources across DEMO ﬁrms. An
incubator director’s time and ability to help ﬁve or six ﬁrms at the same
time was limited, so priorities needed to be made: “ if you’re the CEO,
you tell me today, DEMO we sit down, what the two or three things are that
DEMO your biggest problems and we’ll ﬁgure out a way to help you on one of
them, and the other two are still yours.” When entrepreneurs sought
problem-focused advice, they helped incubator staff provide expertise while
maintaining the boundary of their mentor role. This also helped incubator
staff to DEMO their limited resources and enable the most relevant impact
across their incubated ﬁrms.
In short, seeking problem-focused advice helped address mentor role
conﬂict in two ways: ﬁrst the entrepreneur solicited advice rather than
receiving unsolicited advice from the incubator staff and second, the advice
sought was rooted in demand-driven situations rather than based on the
incubator’s expectation of the entrepreneur’s DEMO As summarized
in Table 2, seeking problem-focused advice helped to partially DEMO mentor
role conﬂict, but to actually unbundle resources from constraints, incubator
staff also needed to adjust their behavior by conferring decision rights.
Incubator DEMO: Confer Decision Rights
When incubator staff reminded everyone present that the DEMO had
ﬁnal say in addressing the venture’s issues, this helped reduce DEMO role
conﬂict by publicly reinforcing the entrepreneur’s autonomy and bounding
the reach of the incubator’s authority. For example, in the prior example,
when Tim told the Optico CEO, “Push back if you don’t agree!” he expli-
citly conferred decision rights to the entrepreneur, after being approached
for advice and laying out potential courses of action. By recognizing the
entrepreneur’s DEMO to disagree, the entrepreneur was free to engage in
extensive problem DEMO with both incubator staff without threat to the
entrepreneur’s autonomy. Even though Tim and the Optico CEO had pre-
viously experienced mentor role conﬂict DEMO the Optico CEO traveled at a
crucial time in his ﬁrm’s funding round, both parties learned to adapt their
practices: while entrepreneurs learned DEMO ask for problem-focused advice,
incubator staff learned to confer decision rights.
We observed this behavior unfolding in other productive exchanges over
time, such as this exchange between the founder of Digitech and the direc-
tor DEMO deputy director of Incupro evaluating whether to serve a speci-
ﬁc customer:
298 VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.
After the various options had been DEMO for quite some time, Tim turned to the
founder of Digitech DEMO said “Well, you’ve heard the Deputy Director’s good ideas.
What do DEMO want to do?” This prompted a bit more discussion focused around the
founder, where he seemed to hone in on a plan asking for a limit of 1-year exclusivity.
(From ﬁeld notes of 11/3)
In this instance, Tim reminded everyone in the room (including DEMO entre-
preneur) where ultimate decision authority lay. This was an approach DEMO
he and other incubator directors reported learning over time. Conferring
decision rights helped make the mentee and mentor roles distinct and rein-
forced these DEMO in the moment when advice was delivered. This
practice helped mitigate mentor role conﬂict by removing any sense of com-
pliance from receipt of DEMO advice.
In sum, mentor role conﬂict occurred when entrepreneurs perceived that
DEMO staff overstepped their role as providing expertise to entrepre-
neurs to direct the venture’s course of action. When entrepreneurs sought
problem-focused advice, they unbundled expertise resources from the con-
straint of needing to act on that DEMO or be subject to unsolicited advice.
Conferring decision rights helped unbundle the incubator’s expectation of
the entrepreneur from acting in accordance with the incubator’s DEMO,
further supporting entrepreneurial autonomy.
Practices Addressing Gatekeeper Control
Incubator staff not only provided expertise but also acted as gatekeepers:
brokering connections with DEMO providers that could be valuable to
their entrepreneurs. This could create another threat to entrepreneurs’
autonomy, when incubator staff tapped their personal networks, DEMO then
created constraints by obligating entrepreneurs to use those connections.
To reduce potential conﬂict stemming from gatekeeper control, incubator
staff and entrepreneurs gravitated towardpractices that couldhelpentre-
preneurs learn from each other and reduce their dependence on DEMO incu-
bator’s network. As outlined in Table 2, we identiﬁed two DEMO
practices that helped reduce gatekeeper control: ﬁrst, entrepreneurs culti-
vated peer exchanges; second, incubator staff designed forums to facilitate
peer exchange.
Entrepreneurs: Cultivate Peer Exchanges
To reduce the need for all resources and expertise DEMO ﬂow through incuba-
tor staff as the sole broker, and thus DEMO threat of potential gatekeeper
Help Me Do It on My Own 299
control, entrepreneurs asked incubator staff to help establish peer forums
for exchanging experience and resources. For DEMO, one speciﬁc request
was for the incubator to sponsor regular pizza DEMO where all entrepre-
neurs could gather and discuss themes of interest to them. Establishing a
regular peer forum required the director to agree and DEMO entrepreneurs to
participate, which they regularly did. We observed three pizza DEMO and
witnessed founders sharing experiences and resources on speciﬁc issues rele-
vant to them that week, such as how to prepare for a due diligence review
by a venture capitalist. These exchanges allowed entrepreneurs to get DEMO
know one another directly and expand each other’s networks laterally so
that they could meet informally on points of mutual interest. This practice
helped DEMO the entrepreneurs’ dependence on incubator staff for
resources and added a new web of potentially rich interconnections among
the entrepreneurs themselves.
Incubator Staff: Design Forums for Peer Exchange
Incubator staff soon recognized that the time and DEMO constraints they
experienced as a gatekeeper could stand in the way of their ability to help
entrepreneurs. To solve this challenge, they designed forums for peer
exchange so that entrepreneurs could learn to help each other. DEMO
exchanges also allowed the incubator to comparatively assess ﬁrms as a
group and ﬁlter their network introductions accordingly. One way in which
incubator staff DEMO peer exchange was by making the progress of
each venture visible so entrepreneurs could seek out and learn from their
peers. For example, after a few months, the incubator director started send-
ing out a regular e-mail to all entrepreneurs, noting major milestones made
by each venture even before such information was publically available. It
was no coincidence that this DEMO also placed some degree of peer pres-
sure on entrepreneurs to perform and make progress in the expected direc-
tion. In addition to e-mail DEMO, roof-top parties celebrating the closing
of funding rounds for each venture DEMO not only as a means to bring
people together to broker resources but also to make visible to all incuba-
tor members which ventures DEMO making the most progress. Incubator
staff leveraged peer exchanges to both motivate entrepreneurs’ performance
and leverage their social networks more carefully. Incubator staff wanted
DEMO help all of their ﬁrms but they were not all equally qualiﬁed for introduc-
tions to their investor network and they could comparatively evaluate DEMO
performance by observing each venture’s progress through peer exchanges.
Gatekeeper control affected both parties: Entrepreneurs were worried
about being constrained to make decisions in accordance with the incubator’s

introductions and incubator staff were concerned DEMO leveraging their
time and maintaining credibility within their social network. When entrepre-
neurs cultivated peer exchanges and when incubator staff designed forums
to facilitate DEMO exchanges, the threat of gatekeeper control compromising
an entrepreneur’s autonomy was DEMO Entrepreneurs learned to rely on
their peers to reduce their dependence on the incubator as the sole source of
advice and network resources. Incubator DEMO learned to leverage their peer
network of entrepreneurs to nudge their ventures in the desired direction
and compare ﬁrms’ relative performance from a distance. DEMO both prac-
tices were used, the constraint of relying on the DEMO resources was
unbundled from the support that could be gained from all incubated ﬁrms’
networks. Doing so allowed entrepreneurs access to peer resources while
DEMO their autonomy and helped the incubator preserve their net-
work resources.
Practices Addressing Afﬁliation Dissonance
As prior research would suggest (Zott & Huy, DEMO), entrepreneurs
acknowledged that their acceptance by the incubator enhanced their legiti-
macy and thus their ability to attract future resources  especially in DEMO
early days. What is less appreciated is that the reputation and identities of
both the ventures incubated and the incubator itself evolved as each
DEMO more or less successful. The success of the ventures in residence
and the incubator became temporarily connected, and this connection
could create dissonance for both parties when there was a perceived asym-
metry in performance. For DEMO, an incubator’s performance can be
tied to the ability of its DEMO to acquire funding and gain ﬁnancial indepen-
dence, attracting still more DEMO to seek afﬁliation. When one party was
not performing as hoped, DEMO was not necessarily viewed as
beneﬁcial  leading to afﬁliation dissonance. Similarly, as entrepreneurs
strove to achieve independence from the incubator, they did DEMO always
want to acknowledge their afﬁliation with the incubator. In response, DEMO
observed both entrepreneurs and incubator staff become increasingly selec-
tive in how they regarded their afﬁliation. These practices are summarized
in Table 2.
Entrepreneurs: Selective Afﬁliation
Early in their relationship with Incupro, entrepreneurs were opportunistic
in how they used their afﬁliation and usually found the relationship to be
Help Me Do It on My Own
301
beneﬁcial. However, when companies such as Geotech and Optico started
to become independent ventures, they often distanced themselves from
Incupro. For example, neither Geotech nor Optico cited their afﬁliation with
Incupro in their own press releases or marketing materials. This DEMO despite
the fact that, at the same time, the director of Incupro referenced both ﬁrms
in its own marketing materials. As described in DEMO 2, the founder of
Optico felt that he had made very DEMO use of Incupro’s resources while in
residence and had “sucked the incubator dry.” Now that he was venture
backed, he did not view afﬁliation with the incubator to be of beneﬁt: he
had new stakeholders to concern himself with. To assert his independence,
he was selective in DEMO Optico’s afﬁliation with Incupro and, during
later stages, did not highlight this afﬁliation at all.
Incubator Staff: Select on Success
Incubator staff could not know how successful an individual entrepreneur
would be in advance, yet they needed a number of successful incubated
companies to attract future entrepreneurs DEMO incubate. When entrepreneurs
in residence were successful in launching new ventures, DEMO director of
Incupro made sure this was known to the community at large: selecting and
highlighting successful cases to cast the best light on Incupro. For example,
when Geotech became the ﬁrst Incupro company to DEMO venture-backed
funding which allowed them to graduate from incubation, the director
DEMO in an incubator-wide e-mail that they had become part of the “senior
class” of Incupro, and made sure they were featured in Incupro’s promo-
tional material. After Optico secured venture funding, the director secured
a long endorsement from them about the value Incupro provided to them.
The practice DEMO selecting on success involved not just highlighting those
ventures that were successful, but also distancing the incubator from those
that failed. When a venture failed, Incupro’s director was quick to recast
their shared identity in both public and private. During our time of obser-
vation, a company that had just left the incubator “blew-up” and sold all
of its assets. DEMO the director was asked what had happened to the com-
pany, DEMO, he replied, “we only housed them, they were not an
DEMO company.” He deliberately distanced the incubator from ﬁrms that
did not succeed  unbundling the afﬁliated identities of the ventures and
the incubator when DEMO did not want their futures to be linked. However,
prior Incupro Powerpoint presentations listed the ﬁrm as one of the ﬁrst
two successful DEMO companies. A press release the following April, after
the venture failed, no longer listed it as ever having been associated with
the incubator.
302 VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.
Afﬁliation dissonance arose when afﬁliation between DEMO entrepreneur
and the incubator was viewed as no longer beneﬁcial. Afﬁliation disso-
nance was more likely to occur near the end of the incubation DEMO
ship, which was always expected to be short term under the DEMO of
circumstances. As they neared ﬁnancial independence, entrepreneurs
began selectively afﬁliating DEMO the incubator  acknowledging
Incupro’s support in the early days of their relationship (when they most
needed it), but they were quick to abandon afﬁliation at later stages.
Incubator staff opted to select on success DEMO highlighting those ﬁrms that
received venture-backed funding and distancing their afﬁliation from
those ventures forced to close their doors. When entrepreneurs began
selectively afﬁliating DEMO the incubator and the incubator began select-
ing on success, in DEMO, both parties unbundled their once inter-
twined afﬁliations.
In sum, incubators offered many of the resources suggested by prior
empirical and theoretical work DEMO as expertise mentoring, resource bro-
kering and endorsing nascent ventures. However, little prior research has
recognized how these “informal” resources are coupled with DEMO as
to how entrepreneurs should manage their ventures. Given that many entre-
preneurs’ pursuit of autonomy is often a key motivator to start new DEMO
in the ﬁrst place, it is no surprise that these implicit DEMO attached” were
often experienced as threats to entrepreneurs’ autonomy. We identiﬁed three
sets of practices used by entrepreneurs and their organizational sponsors to
unbundle DEMO from constraints, allowing entrepreneurs to take full
advantage of the resources DEMO while preserving their autonomy.
DISCUSSION
Our research heeds a broader call to attend to “why, when and how differ-
ent modes of action are used to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities”
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000, p. 218). Recently “different modes of
action” have included the use of organizational DEMO such as incubators
and accelerators (Cohen, 2013). Despite the rise of interest in different
forms of organizational sponsorship used to support entrepreneurs (Amezcua
et al., 2013), particularly in their early stages, little DEMO has examined
the process of organizational sponsorship. Existing research has been either
focused on static attributes of incubators or incubator outcomes (e.g. Bergek &DEMO
Norrman, 2008) without examining the speciﬁc practices employed within
Help Me Do It on My Own
303
accelerators and incubators and DEMO they affect entrepreneurs. While the
ultimate effect of sponsorship on entrepreneurship may be contingent on the
environment (Amezcua et al, 2013), we DEMO this context as an excellent
opportunity to examine an under-explored tension common to many entre-
preneurs: How do entrepreneurs preserve their autonomy while obtaining
resources from others?
Much research has examined the importance of gathering DEMO to
support nascent ventures (Zott & Huy, 2007), but how informal constraints
or “strings” are attached to the resources acquired affects entrepreneurs
DEMO escaped scholars’ attention. As Rindova and colleagues stated, “under-
standing the DEMO that entrepreneuring individuals seek to overcome
may give us better insights into the process through which entrepreneurs
create [the development of opportunities]” (2009, DEMO 482). Our objective
was to understand the constraints entrepreneurs encountered in a sponsor-
ing organization and the strategies employed to deal with such DEMO
An incubator offered an ideal context to study this phenomena, where DEMO
eral entrepreneurs with the ultimate goal of creating independent startups
were in residence for a temporary period. While much research has extolled
the beneﬁts DEMO incubators (Hansen et al., 2000), little research has examined
how incubators can constrain as well as support entrepreneurs in their
launch of DEMO ventures. Our study speciﬁcally examined how both entre-
preneurs and incubator staff experienced challenges arising from the incu-
bator relationship and three types of DEMO to entrepreneurs’ autonomy
that precipitated action.
To address mentor role conﬂict, DEMO solicited problem-focused
advice and incubator staff conferred decision rights to the entrepreneur.
When both parties made this adjustment, they unbundled the incubator’s
expertise from the constraint of needing to act on that expertise. To reduce
gatekeeper DEMO, entrepreneurs cultivated peer exchanges and incubator
staff designed forums for peer DEMO When both parties made this
adjustment, the constraint of relying on DEMO incubator’s network of
resources was unbundled from the support that could be gained from peers,
enabling entrepreneurs to preserve their autonomy when making DEMO
and relieving pressure on the incubator’s social network. Peer forums also
helped the incubator more selectively identify which ﬁrms were ready for
preferential access DEMO the incubator’s network of resources so as not to over
tap their network. To address afﬁliation dissonance, entrepreneurs selec-
tively afﬁliated with the incubator early in their relationship while distan-
cing themselves at later stages. When DEMO selected on success, they
were the ones doing the distancing to DEMO a coherent narrative of success.
304 VICTOR P. SEIDEL ET AL.
Put together, our research contributes an understanding of the process
by which entrepreneurs and business incubator staff navigated DEMO
to craft distinct but mutualistic roles. Although entrepreneurs and incuba-
tors shared common goals, this was not always an easy process but one
marked by tension, difﬁcult conversations, and sometimes outright conﬂict.
Our grounded theoretical DEMO shows how organizational sponsors
are vocal stakeholders and help-givers in the entrepreneurial venturing pro-
cess, subject to the type of conﬂict common to most organizations (Barley,
1991). By studying the messiness of organizational life in situ as it unfolds,
we learned how the implicit “strings DEMO to the resources allocated to
new ventures emerge and how they can be unbundled only when both help-
givers and help-seekers adjust their practices. DEMO a process of mutual
adjustment, both entrepreneurs and incubator staff learned DEMO adapt their
practices to reduce if not prevent threats to autonomy and enable both par-
ties to gain beneﬁts from collaboration. Understanding this process DEMO criti-
cal, as the resources that incubators provide entrepreneurs emerge through
DEMO social process, unlike direct capital investments to entrepreneurs. Thus,
the DEMO of obtaining resources from organizational sponsors with
embedded processes such as incubators or accelerators requires an under-
standing of how help-seeking and help-giving intersect.
DEMO research on help-giving has focused on individual attributes pre-
dicting what type of person is more likely to help another (Flynn & Lake,
2008; Grodal, Nelson, & Siino, 2015). Help is often DEMO as a simple bin-
ary equation: it is either offered or DEMO When work is complex and interde-
pendent, Grodal and colleagues show DEMO help-giving and help-seeking
become intertwined, recasting “help-seeking and help-giving as an DEMO
pendent process in which both the help-seeker and the help-giver use cogni-
tive and emotional moves to engage others” (2015, p. 136). DEMO their study
of a large technology company, they found helping was DEMO costly nor rare
but a common organizational routine, much as we DEMO in the incuba-
tor we studied. In their setting, help-seekers needed DEMO attract help through
cognitive and social engagement (Grodal et al., 2015).
However, in our study, help-seekers often suffered from the reverse DEMO
blem: over engagement from help-givers. For example, help-seekers had to
learn to narrow their scope and help-givers needed to learn to bound their
DEMO in order for the help to be received without spurring mentor
role conﬂict. These differences point to the role of organizational context
and in DEMO the delivering of help, as a type of resource, as an
organizationally embedded process (Grant & Ashford, 2008). The delivery
of DEMO occurs through a type of exchange  with potential costs and

beneﬁts to both parties. DEMO research suggests that merely co-locating a
help-seeker and a help-giver in one physical place is unlikely on its own to
lead to a fruitful DEMO between organizational sponsors and entre-
preneurs without mutual adaptation  as new social routines will need to
form. This was especially true in our DEMO which took place in a recently-
established incubator; more experienced incubators DEMO be able to leverage
more established help routines.
Second, we inductively DEMO the practices that allowed entrepre-
neurs to unbundle resources from constraints in a way that addressed
threats to entrepreneurial autonomy. As illustrated in Fig. DEMO, entrepreneurs
are drawn to incubators for the resources they can provide. DEMO con-
straints on these resources were discovered, both entrepreneurs and incuba-
DEMO engaged in mutual adjustment and through this process, entrepreneurs
were able DEMO realize the beneﬁts associated with an incubator organization.
Prior research on incubators has not recognized the organizational con-
straints that incubators can place on DEMO most motivated to start their
own organizations. The process of unbundling resources from constraints
helped the entrepreneurs and incubator staff we studied more clearly DEMO
their respective roles and achieve collaborative outcomes: entrepreneurs
maintained autonomy over DEMO unique to their ventures and incuba-
tors become better positioned to host successive entrepreneurs.
Even though organizational sponsors such as incubators and accelera-
tors DEMO received increasing levels of attention, relatively little research has
examined the DEMO that take place within these organizations. Yet, it is
the helpful DEMO within incubators and accelerators that is proposed
to be the primary engine of value creation  helping to transform nascent
ideas into independent ventures. DEMO underlying premise is that the mentor-
ing, endorsement, and preferential network access offered by sponsoring
organizations is far more important than just the DEMO space alone.
Without better explanation of how the internal processes within sponsoring
organizations occur, we can say little about the mechanisms that promote
value creation. By explaining how these internal processes of exchange and
support work DEMO well as where they fail, we are better positioned to explain
DEMO entrepreneurs and incubator staff can maximize the joint value created
as well as the conditions under which such relationships are likely to fail.
Our DEMO contribution is to provide a model that explains when entre-
preneurs are likely to falter in their quest for both resources and
autonomy  DEMO therefore how best to avoid such outcomes. We charted
the process by which entrepreneurs and incubator staff unbundled
resources from constraints in ways that DEMO beneﬁcial to our setting of

entrepreneurs in a single incubator. However, the process points to two
ways in which entrepreneurs can also fail. DEMO, entrepreneurs may gain all
the resources they need through an incubator, but if they fail to unbundle
those resources from constraints, they may become entangled in the
“strings attached” and ﬁnd it difﬁcult to establish DEMO for themselves
or independence for their venture. While not found in our sample of incu-
bated ventures, such ﬁrms  termed “walking wounded” in the parlance of
some incubator managershold of independence needed to establish themselves DEMO viable organiza- do gather resources, but never gain the foot-
tions. DEMO, entrepreneurs may encounter conﬂict and fail to adapt their
practices, instead disconnecting from the incubator and failing to acquire
the resources needed for DEMO sake of preserving their independence. In this
case, the incubator’s value DEMO the entrepreneur is not realized, and the
entrepreneur will be unlikely DEMO capture the returns sponsoring organiza-
tions are capable of providing. While we did not have evidence of either
type of failure in our setting, with the process model we induced, we can
identify where a breakdown could occur if resources could not be fully
unbundled from constraints through DEMO process of mutual adjustment.
Our research has implications for a range of other sponsoring organiza-
tions such as university spin-out facilities hosting scientist founders, writer’s
workshops hosting aspiring novelists, and scientiﬁc institutions hosting
post-doctoral scholars. Writers’ workshops, such as the famous Iowa
Writers’ Workshop, provide a temporary DEMO where aspiring novelists
can work in a community to develop their craft (Dana, 1999). For example,
an aspiring novelist may receive DEMO mentoring on her style of writing,
develop a network of contacts to agents, and earn legitimacy in the eyes of
publishers through afﬁliation with the workshop. Yet, writers “in resi-
dence” still need to develop their own distinctive voice and style within this
context. As another example DEMO a sponsoring organization, post-doctoral
students in research laboratories receive mentoring while DEMO their
own individual skills and expertise in preparation to be an independently-
funded researcher (Leshner, 2012; Radetsky, 1994). In both settings, indivi-
duals seeking professional autonomy are receiving resources and support
from sponsoring DEMO and may face many of the potential sources
of constraint identiﬁed in our research.
Thus, we would expect a similar process of unbundling resources from
constraints to occur as individuals and their sponsors navigate their roles.
DEMO ﬁndings also have implications for entrepreneurs who work within
existing ﬁrms. Those who aspire to be entrepreneurial in leading new
ventures within their ﬁrm DEMO employ similar strategies, engaging in

problem-focused mentoring with senior DEMO as a means to test out
ideas; establishing peer exchanges among DEMO individuals in the organiza-
tion as a means to evaluate opportunities and selectively using their afﬁlia-
tion with the broader ﬁrm to gain additional DEMO resources.
CONCLUSION
Entrepreneurs in sponsoring organizations, such as business incubators,
DEMO gain resources and help, but such support may lie within a DEMO of
informal constraints. The process of unbundling resources from these con-
straints is an aspect of much working life, but it is perhaps highlighted
starkly in the context of nascent ventures and sponsoring organizations.
Many workers DEMO a degree of autonomy in their work, and entrepreneurs
are but DEMO example. By examining the process by which threats to auton-
omy are addressed in a business incubator, we have provided a window
into distinct modes of adjustment likely to take place in differing degrees
across increasingly DEMO modes of working and across changing work-
place settings.
