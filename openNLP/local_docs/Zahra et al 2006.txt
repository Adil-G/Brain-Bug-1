DEMO in established companies centers on new business creation that is essen-
tial for proﬁtability and growth. Yet, it is a complex process that is riven with technical,
organizational, and political uncertainties. In this article, DEMO explore the role of trust in the
new business creation process in established companies. While there is agreement that
trust is conducive to entrepreneurial DEMO in these companies, research on the dysfunc-
tional effects of trust DEMO new business creation initiatives has been sparse. We contribute to
the literature by discussing the various stages of the business creation process (focusing on
opportunity recognition, evaluation, reﬁnement, championing, and implementation) in estab-
lished companies, examining the positive effects of relational trust on each of these stages,
and analyzing the negative effects of overreliance on relational trust DEMO each stage. We
conclude by highlighting the key managerial and theoretical implications of our analyses
and by outlining promising avenues for future research.
New DEMO creation is important for the continuous success, proﬁtability, and
growth of established ﬁrms (Burgelman & Valikangas, 2005). These companies often
need DEMO venture beyond their existing businesses to overcome competence traps that
preclude them from adapting to their environments (Ahuja & Lampert, 2001; Zahra &DEMO
Hayton, in press). In order to create new businesses, established companies have to
combine their existing (or new) resources in new DEMO (Schumpeter, 1934). These recom-
binations can open new paths for building new skills, renewing operations, or venturing
into market arenas within DEMO or new industries (Garvin, 2002).
The process of new business creation in established companies is costly, time con-
suming, and complex DEMO it involves formal and informal activities across multiple

levels within the organization (Garvin, 2004). It is also laden DEMO information asymme-
tries where different people in different parts of the organization control specialized
knowledge that they do not always share (Zahra, Nielsen, & Bogner, 1999). The gestation
period for new business ventures is frequently long, taking years to pay off (Van de Ven,
DEMO, Polley, & Garud, 2000). New business creation also requires DEMO partici-
pation of different groups with different outlooks and perspectives (Garvin, 2004; Kanter,
1985). These conditions make formal monitoring and controls difﬁcult and costly. The
complexity of the analyses involved in new venture DEMO, the interdependencies that
develop across organizational units, and the different information that different groups
control highlight the role of trust as a useful DEMO in managing the interdependen-
cies and uncertainties encountered in recognizing, evaluating, and exploiting new business
opportunities (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003)DEMO Relation-based trust promotes cohe-
sion, unity of direction, and cooperation that facilitates the introduction and acceptance of
new business ventures.
Trust has been DEMO differently in the literature. Most deﬁnitions view trust as “a
psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive
expectations of the DEMO or behavior of another” (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998, p. 395). Trust becomes relevant when people become dependent on and vulnerable
to the actions and decisions of others (McEvily et al., 2003). These people possess and
control different types of knowledge, DEMO the purpose of the organization differently,
have different motivations in supporting new business creation, and often differ in the
evaluation of new business opportunities. When ambiguity and social complexity sur-
rounds decision making, traditional organizational control systems may fail to bring about
or sustain an effective alignment DEMO interest among these people. Relational trust that is
grounded in mutual respect and shared interests could be an effective complement
(Mellewigt, Madhok, & Webel, 2004; Poppo & Zenger, 2002) or supplement (Das &DEMO
Teng, 1998) to these organizational controls. Still, developing and maintaining DEMO takes
time, effort, and resources (Jones & George, 1998). Reliance on trust in the absence of
sufﬁcient controls can also increase DEMO of judgment, obscure rational decision making,
and discourage entrepreneurial risk DEMO
Objective and Contributions
The objective of this article was to examine the functional and dysfunctional roles of
relational trust in new business creation in DEMO companies. We argue that relational
trust plays an important role in surfacing, recognizing, reﬁning, evaluating, selecting, and
institutionalizing new business venturing initiatives. While the literature touts the positive
effects, relational trust can have serious negative effects on new business creation as well.
Consequently, we analyze the various stages of new business creation and discuss the
potentially adverse effect DEMO relational trust on each.
We add to the literature by showing the limits of relational trust as a social mechanism
that supports the initiation DEMO institutionalization of new ventures in established compa-
nies. Research has long advocated the need for autonomy and corresponding relational
trust as a means of DEMO the recognition and incubation of ideas (Zahra, 1991).
Relational trust enables employees to capitalize on their skills and competencies. It is also
DEMO because traditional valuation methods cannot fully and accurately capture the
complexity associated with new venture creation in established companies (Van de Ven
et al., 2000). The payoff from these ventures is also hard to measure a priori, complicating
analyses of the risk–return relationship.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
The next section of the article discusses the multiple and iterative stages DEMO the process
of new business creation in established companies. Next, it DEMO the concept of trust
and its various dimensions. The article then highlights the positive and negative effects of
relational trust in each of the DEMO business creation stages. The ﬁnal section of the article
outlines the managerial and theoretical implications of relational trust for new business
creation and highlights DEMO worthy of further research.
New Business Creation in Established Companies: Stages DEMO Challenges
The literature emphasizes the importance of new business creation for established
companies’ growth and proﬁtability (Garvin, 2004; Van de Ven et al., 2000; Zahra, 1991;
Zahra, Neubaum, & Huse, 2000)DEMO Yet, little attention has been given to the process by
which DEMO businesses are created within established companies (Garvin, 2002; Van de
DEMO et al.). The scarcity of research on the topic stems from the complexity of the
processes involved and the long gestation period of DEMO of these initiatives. Many ideas
for new business also develop informally (DEMO, 1983a, 1983b; Garvin, 2004),
making it difﬁcult to DEMO the processes and actors involved.
Established companies go through several iterative stages as they create new busi-
nesses (Garvin, 2002, 2004; Van DEMO Ven et al., 2000). While there is no agreement on DEMO
stages in the literature, Table 1 captures the most widely recognized. DEMO the recognition
stage, new business opportunities are identiﬁed by individuals or DEMO of individuals.
Prior experiences and organizational skills and needs often inﬂuence the types of oppor-
tunities people and groups notice (Zahra, 1991). DEMO companies develop formal

processes that help identify and deﬁne such opportunities (O’Connor & Rice, DEMO).
Other companies rely on informal and even accidental discoveries by employees (Garvin,
2004). Since the nature and size of opportunities are frequently unclear, “innovators” rely
on the informal appraisal and feedback of their colleagues and other members of their
professional and personal networks. When making DEMO evaluations, innovators rely on
their understanding of organizational norms and needs (Pinchot, 1985). This informal
evaluation is usually followed by the reﬁnement stage where selected ideas are revised and
repositioned to make them more DEMO to the ﬁrm’s management. In this stage, new
venture ideas should DEMO positioned on technical and political grounds. Technical position-
ing means clarifying the scope of the opportunity, the potential synergies between the new
business and existing business(es), ﬁnancial and other resource requirements, and the
skills needed to exploit the opportunity. Political positioning means making the business
idea DEMO and attractive to senior managers. The championing stage involves ﬁnding
capable and well-established individuals who will lead the venture or simply make it
attractive DEMO accessible to the ﬁrm’s senior management.
Ideas that are well positioned technically and politically are likely to get the atten-
tion and consideration of DEMO ﬁrm’s senior managers during the evaluation stage. These
ideas undergo multiple reviews. Once an idea receives formal management approval and
support, resources are allocated for its initiation and implementation. At the implemen-
tation stage, action plans are made and milestones are set to guide the venture’s deci-
sions. DEMO are also made at this stage about the location of the new business
within the ﬁrm’s structure. Next, successful ventures enter the institutionalization stage
where they are permanently placed within the formal organization. Formal reviews
gauge DEMO new ventures’ performance and progress in meeting their objectives. Still,
some companies may choose to spin off some ventures while retaining an ownership
DEMO in them.
Different actors with different motives, incentives, and political agenda take part in
the various stages of new business creation (Burgelman, DEMO, 1983b; Garvin, 2004; Van
de Ven et al., 2000), as indicated in Table 1. Moreover, moving from one stage of DEMO
business creation to the next is neither assured nor predictable. Organizational politics and
cultural norms often shape these moves. Managers’ taste and receptivity to DEMO for new
ventures also vary across organizational levels and time, making DEMO difﬁcult to foretell the
fortunes of these ventures. Venture champions also change on the basis of career accom-
plishments and life goals, inﬂuencing the extent to which they sell and pursue their ideas.
These realities make DEMO difﬁcult to determine with clarity and foresight which ventures will
gain managers’ support, possibly encouraging politicking and organizational maneuver-
ing. Under these conditions, DEMO (economic-based) controls cannot reliably align
the interests or actions of various actors. Relational trust can effectively induce and sustain
such an alignment, fostering new venture creation activities.
The Positive Effects of Relational Trust on New DEMO Creation in
Established Companies
Relational trust can have a signiﬁcant impact on organizational attitudes and behav-
iors, such as cooperation (Axelrod, 1984; DEMO & George, 1998; Mayer, Davis, &
Schoorman, 1995), communication (Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974), problem solving (Zand,
1972), and performance (Barney & Hansen, 1994; Earley, 1986). DEMO trust can also
inﬂuence the support for and levels of entrepreneurship across sectors and national
contexts (Höhmann & Welter, 2005; Stull & Aram, 2005; Welter, Kautonen, Chepurenko,
544 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Malieva, & Venesaar, 2004). Indeed, relational trust can facilitate risk taking (McAllister,
1995), promote employees’ innovativeness (Clegg, Unsworth, DEMO, & Parker,
2002), and enhance proactiveness in the discovery DEMO pursuit of new business opportu-
nities (Stull & Aram, 2005).
Trust is a complex concept that has multiple forms and exists in DEMO contexts
(Kramer, 1999; Nooteboom, 2002; Rousseau et al., 1998; Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998). There
is convergence in the literature DEMO trust involves a willingness to be vulnerable (Barney
& Hansen, 1994; Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al.) positive expectations regarding
DEMO motives and/or conduct (Das & Teng, 1998; Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998),
and mutual interdependence and risk (Das & Teng, 1998, 2001; Gulati, 1995; Mayer
et al.). DEMO other classiﬁcations of trust exist, two are most widely acknowledged:
DEMO and relational. Calculative trust is grounded in a person’s evaluation of risks
versus returns in a relationship. Relational trust, however, is based on DEMO social interac-
tions that take place between two or more individuals. Where relational trust prevails,
people become more interested in maintaining their social DEMO while
de-emphasizing potential losses or gains. In this article, we focus DEMO relational trust that
is grounded in the social interactions that occur within groups and networks.
In established companies, reliance on relational trust can enhance economic activity
by enabling and facilitating positive and productive interactions between and DEMO
people and organizations while reducing transaction costs (Nooteboom, 2002). Trust may
also enhance the success of an economic transaction through its effects DEMO the nature of
social exchange (Korsgaard, Brodt, & Whitener, 2002). When management acts in a
trustworthy manner, employees may wish to perpetuate and extend this positive relation-
ship and to make greater contributions DEMO the social exchange (Mayer & Gavin, 2005).
This may manifest itself in the form of greater willingness to work harder to achieve
DEMO goals, innovate, or share information and knowledge.
Relational trust can also promote the achievement of a common purpose by ensuring
sufﬁcient cognitive alignment DEMO perceptions, interpretations, evaluations, and goals
(Nooteboom, 2002, pp. 23–29). Relational trust also facilitates the sharing of knowledge,
which is DEMO to the identiﬁcation and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities
(Venkataraman, 1997). Relational trust enhances frequent interactions among employees,
thereby improving facilitation of DEMO and rapid knowledge sharing.
Reliance on relational trust also gives established companies several speciﬁc advan-
tages in each stage of new business creation. The DEMO of these advantages vary from
one company to the next, reﬂecting DEMO idiosyncratic conditions that permeate its opera-
tions and the social structures that pervade their groups. In ﬁrms that have clear, well-
established and communicated cultural norms, relational trust might magnify beneﬁts
associated with new business creation efforts. The opposite may be true when social
structures are transient and DEMO are loosely deﬁned.
Recognizing Opportunities for Business Creation
Relational trust may increase entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence that management and
coworkers will not take advantage of their DEMO (McEvily et al., 2003). As a result,
they may more easily share their knowledge and participate in joint problem-solving
activities, a key source of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas. Moreover, where rela-
tional trust prevails, the psychological contract with the organization is strengthened, and
employees DEMO strong attachments to their ﬁrm. As a consequence, employees will invest
DEMO and energy in searching for or developing entrepreneurial ventures that improve their
company’s performance. Relational trust also enhances open communication and the
July, 2006
545
effective sharing of ideas, enabling employees to discuss areas for improvement and
organizational possible changes. Recognizing that management will not penalize them for
faulty DEMO poorly timed ideas, employees are more apt to share their ideas DEMO
setting the stage for the effective evaluation and review of proposed new business
ventures.
Evaluating New Business Creation Initiatives
In this stage, relational trust may expedite the informal evaluations made initially by
colleagues and friends who DEMO in the quality or future potential of ideas offered by
trustworthy parties. Members of the same network usually share a common history and
know-how DEMO provide useful feedback that can improve the odds of innovative ideas being
formally accepted by management. Still, there is risk that such informal evaluators may
become more open to and supportive of even extreme or risky DEMO, since relational trust
is likely to decrease their fear of failure. DEMO counterbalance this tendency, formal and
thoughtful evaluations are needed. Here, too, relational trust can be useful as managers are
likely to be more positively disposed to support the ideas of those employees with credible
track DEMO, and who are considered reliable and trustworthy. Managers may also
provide DEMO feedback that helps employees to reﬁne their ideas, better positioning them
DEMO organizational acceptance.
Framing New Business Opportunities
In this stage, relational trust DEMO lead colleagues to make honest evaluations and give
beneﬁcial feedback that improves the strategic positioning of the ideas. Reﬁnement
requires “give-and-take” and mutual knowledge DEMO Colleagues and managers are apt
to share their doubts about the business idea when they trust that its developers are
credible, will receive feedback in good faith, and then use that feedback to improve the
idea. Of course, the amount and quality of feedback received and actions taken based on
it depend considerably on the social dynamics that exist among DEMO
Initiating and Institutionalizing New Business Ventures
In this stage, relational trust DEMO the new business creation process in several
ways. For instance, relational DEMO increases the extent to which actors can depend on and
predict each other’s behavior. Under these conditions, the actors’ ability to coordinate
activities and their willingness to help each other increases. This increases cooperation
that also DEMO the assembly of resources, hiring of key personnel, and putting the
infrastructure together. Trust also makes the implementation of ideas faster by facilitating
DEMO resolution. If disputes or different interpretations arise, they are addressed openly
DEMO quickly since people trust each other’s judgments. Relational trust also strengthens the
actors’ identiﬁcation with and commitment to common goals and objectives (McEvily
et al., 2003). As a result, the actors invest extra time DEMO energy to ensure the success of
the proposed business ventures. The actors do so because they are not concerned about
being taken advantage of DEMO others.
Relational trust also reduces the need for formal monitoring and control of the new
business creation initiatives, possibly lowering the cost of implementation. It can also give
employees more autonomy and ﬂexibility in pursuing business DEMO activities. In turn,
this increases speed and ease by which new knowledge is captured and shared (Young,
546
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Sapienza, & Baumer, 2003). This can help employees adapt and DEMO their behaviors in
ways that increase the success of the implementation of the proposed business ventures.
Trust in the benevolence of the senior management DEMO enhances the acceptance of
rules and procedures (Lind, Tyler, & DEMO, 1997). It also increases employees’ acceptance
of the decision for DEMO placing the new business within the formal structure
(Tyler, Degoey, & Smith, 1996). It also becomes easier to share information about DEMO
progress of the venture with others in the organization, making the DEMO of institution-
alizing the new venture easier.
To summarize, during the DEMO stages of the established company’s new business
creation process, trust can DEMO the organization several economic (e.g., lowering costs)
and social (DEMO, increased commitment and solidarity) beneﬁts. It can also promote the
employees’ satisfaction and increase their commitment, leading to successful new venture
creation. Table 2 summarizes the key beneﬁts to be gained from trust in each DEMO of new
business creation.
The Dark Side of Relational Trust and New Business Creation Initiatives
Thus far, our discussion has illustrated the positive inﬂuence of trust on the various
activities of new business creation in the DEMO company. Clearly, relational trust can
be an important social lubricant that DEMO things happen quickly and efﬁciently. It can
also expedite the accurate sharing of knowledge. Relational trust also builds the social
solidarity needed to take DEMO and introduce radical innovation into existing and change-
resisting organizations.
Yet, DEMO on trust can be excessive and can have negative effects by rendering
economic relations too exclusive or by inducing rigidities and erecting barriers to DEMO
ity and innovation (Nooteboom, 2002). Excessive relational trust can also lead to serious
errors of judgment. Deutsch (1973) argues that one DEMO of excessive trust is naivety,
ignorance, or cognitive immaturity. The DEMO of this is that the individual does not
develop a threshold of trust, which when exceeded should trigger the need to revise
expectations, DEMO, and behaviors. Accordingly, an individual may ignore evidence
that would falsify previous assumptions of trustworthiness (Nooteboom, 2002). Indeed,
evidence that DEMO trustworthiness beliefs is considered suspect and ignored
(Lewicki et al., 1998).
Relational trust also promotes overreliance on heuristics (Bazerman, 1998). DEMO
preneurs and entrepreneurial managers have been associated with the use of heuristics
such as representativeness and overconﬁdence to a greater extent than corporate managers
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Wright, Hoskisson, Busenitz, & Dial, DEMO). In environments
where there is high uncertainty and limited information, DEMO heuristics enable individu-
als to identify and exploit opportunities as well as to make decisions quickly. This latter
feature can be particularly important in DEMO settings when the window of an
opportunity may be brief and a reluctance to act can result in the opportunity being
missed. When heuristic-based DEMO processing prevails, accuracy is often compro-
mised. Further, Nooteboom (2002) explains how heuristics can result in an inability to
adjust relational trust DEMO changing circumstances. When events occur simultaneously,
individuals may prematurely assign causality. Thus, an individual who relies on the
“representativeness” heuristic may attribute trustworthiness on the basis of spurious
characteristics that the individual happened to observe DEMO conjunction with the experience
of relational trust. The “overconﬁdence” heuristic may result in errors by neglecting the
sample size of experience. Accordingly, individuals may overestimate the probability of

incidental occurrences and underestimate those of frequent ones. The “availability” heu-
ristics DEMO a bias toward familiar experiences. This may encourage employees to use
sources of information and opportunities that are familiar to them at the exclusion DEMO other
potentially valuable but less familiar sources.
Researchers have not been as attentive to examining the dark side of relational trust,
focusing more DEMO its positive effects. Instead, researchers have discussed ways that reduce
chances DEMO opportunism, and lower the probability of individual and group deviance while
DEMO focus on organizational goal accomplishment. Talking about these various
mechanisms can help improve the chances that trust is well founded. But such discussions
do DEMO capture the various ill effects of relational trust on new business creation activities.
Understanding these effects can set the stage for an informed discussion DEMO intensifying
relational trust and, as a result, the odds of successful new business creation efforts.
Consequently, in this section, we pause and DEMO the potential ill effects of relational
trust within the various stages of new business development. Table 2 shows that the
negative effects of relational DEMO could be felt in every stage of the new business creation
process, even though these effects may vary from one company to another. These effects
are also likely to differ within the same company on the DEMO of the stage, the nature of
the new business being created, and the conditions surrounding its establishment.
Recognizing Opportunities for Business Creation
In DEMO opportunity recognition stage, it is useful to differentiate between the sources
DEMO types of ideas for new business initiatives. Sources of ideas for these ventures could
come from within the ﬁrm, either formally or informally (DEMO, 1983a, 1983b;
O’Connor & Rice, 2001). Ideas for DEMO new business ventures might also come from
external sources (e.g., suppliers or alliance partners), also formally or informally (Zahra,
1991). Where relational trust prevails, the company is likely to make greater use of
informal internal and external sources (e.g., networks) to supplement or offset the limi-
tations of any existing internal formal systems dedicated to DEMO recognition. When
relational trust pervades the venture creation process, greater attention DEMO be given to
those sources within and outside the ﬁrm that are believed to be credible. Sources that are
not familiar to decision makers, controversial, or viewed as not supportive of existing
management or norms are likely to be overlooked, ignored, or even suppressed. As a
result, search for opportunities for new business might be limited in focus, selective, and
even biased. Given that controversial or unfamiliar sources are ignored, DEMO search process
is likely to reinforce a “thinking alike” culture, leading DEMO strategic blindness where
favored opportunities or those coming from well-known sources are not subjected to
systematic or rigorous analysis. Reliance on the same sources DEMO identifying and deter-
mining potential opportunities could also limit the variety of these opportunities, handi-
capping the ﬁrm’s quest to break away from the familiar by venturing into new ﬁelds.
Ideas for new business creation could DEMO on incremental or radical change.
Incremental change means adding to the ﬁrm’s existing businesses without venturing far
aﬁeld from its strategic core (Zahra, DEMO). Radical change centers on altering the very
concept of business or the ﬁrm’s strategic core or how the ﬁrm competes (e.g., changing
DEMO business model). Incremental changes are usually easier to evaluate and accept by
management. These changes require skills that are usually readily available in DEMO orga-
nization. The organizational structure could also accommodate these changes. In contrast,
radical changes are harder to appraise and incorporate within the ﬁrm’s DEMO opera-
tions or existing structures.
July, 2006

Where relational trust prevails, both incremental and radical changes are easier to
accept and implement in the ﬁrm. The problem is that where relational DEMO becomes
excessive, existing power centers are likely to favor ideas from DEMO sources that
they already know, value, and trust. The stability of these sources makes it less likely
that they conceive and develop radical DEMO that disrupts the status quo. Ideas for radical
innovation often thrive at the margin and have to ﬁght hard for management’s recognition
and acceptance (Kanter, 1983, 1985). Advocates of these ideas are often not DEMO con-
nected to the ﬁrm’s power centers and may not enjoy the relational trust of the ﬁrm’s
leadership. These ideas are likely to be DEMO to greater scrutiny and analyses, as
discussed next.
Evaluating New Business DEMO Initiatives
In this stage, one can see several manifestations of the DEMO effects of excessive rela-
tional trust on new business creation activities. As we state in Table 2, where trust
dominates the process, analyses DEMO be perfunctory and ad hoc in nature, failing to
establish the DEMO relevance and viability of the proposed business ventures. Decision
makers might also show considerable favoritism to the sources they trust, as we have just
suggested. Speciﬁcally, senior managers might sacriﬁce objectivity in their analysis and
rely more on their intuition or shared experiences in appraising these ideas. Executives
DEMO also downplay the potential risks associated with the proposed projects while
overstating their potential gains by overemphasizing the intangibles of these projects.
These intangibles DEMO hard to assess under the most normal circumstances. The value of
these intangibles also varies on the basis of how they are used, further making it difﬁcult
to evaluate their strategic importance. This importance, in turn, is likely to change over
time, and managers could use this DEMO advocate (or sabotage) new business venture ideas.
Decision makers, thus, may not exercise the due diligence necessary to establish the
merits and DEMO of the proposed business ventures.
Without rigorous analyses, the foundation for DEMO effective decisions about the
new business ventures to pursue and develop is undermined. Worse, as we propose in
Table 2, managers might end DEMO experiencing the “Abilene paradox,” where they more or
less agree on the same ventures without sufﬁcient recognition of their limitations
or without genuine DEMO to their fate (Harvey, 1988). Excessive relational trust
could discourage some managers from expressing their concerns or from questioning the
assumptions and DEMO of the analyses conducted of these proposed ventures.
Another insidious effect of excessive relational trust is that employees and interested
others watching how the DEMO makes decisions about new business ventures become
discouraged as they conclude that political, not economic, considerations shape these
decisions. When such beliefs take DEMO of employees, many become unwilling to suggest
or champion new business DEMO ideas, possibly reducing the variety of the ideas
presented to management. DEMO time, this could intensify inertia or perpetuate the “near-
ness trap” (Ahuja & Lampert, 2001), where the ﬁrm continues to search for ideas for
innovation and new business in the vicinity of the knowledge DEMO skills it already has. This
reinforces the belief that those individuals who are overembedded in their social networks
might become risk averse (Brass, DEMO, Greve, & Tsai, 2004).
Framing New Business Opportunities
Table DEMO offers several additional reasons for companies’ potential failure to escape
inertia through new business creation, where trust becomes excessive. In the opportunity
550
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
framing (i.e., reﬁnement) stage, certain venture ideas are likely to DEMO considerable
formal and informal feedback from the company’s decision makers. The higher the
relational trust these individuals have in the sources of the opportunity, the more detailed
and forthcoming their feedback is likely to be. Yes, as we argue later, much depends on the
social dynamics of the relationship. Higher trust could lead to less feedback and imme-
diate acceptance DEMO proposed ideas.
Relational trust encourages and facilitates the sharing of information, DEMO nega-
tive feedback. This feedback can shape the fate of new business ideas by better positioning
them for the ﬁrm’s formal acceptance and implementation. DEMO when the feedback
comes from informal networks, it could help connect DEMO new business idea to the ﬁrm’s
dominant logic and managers’ decision and mental models—expediting their formal
acceptance by the organization. Ideas for radical business DEMO are more likely to
beneﬁt from such feedback. The more feedback that advocates of these ideas receive, the
more they can reﬁne and reframe them and better clarify their connections to the ﬁrm’s
mission, resources, DEMO skills. Ironically, while these reﬁnements could enhance the odds
of ideas DEMO radically new projects’ survival, ideas might lose their originality as their
DEMO seek to gain the support and commitment of senior managers. Champions may
scale down their own ideas or redeﬁne them in ways that will DEMO them more organi-
zationally and politically acceptable.
Changing the scope and scale of radical new business venture ideas is easier to do
when champions DEMO from existing power centers within the ﬁrm (Table 1). To DEMO
their connections to decision makers, champions may ask advocates of new DEMO ideas
to compromise by changing their timetable, altering key design features, or even lowering
cost estimates. Aware of the biases that govern the DEMO of new business ideas, some
champions might hide key pieces of DEMO from decision makers or might introduce
the idea piecemeal to complicate its accurate evaluation. Still, champions need to maintain
their credibility with decision makers and therefore may not support truly radically
different ideas, unless the organization is facing a major performance crisis. Clearly, eager
to maintain the trust that they enjoy throughout the organization, champions may favor
those ideas that they believe managers like. Champions may not support radically differ-
ent ideas DEMO new business ventures.
Initiating and Institutionalizing New Business Ventures
Some of the most serious effects of excessive relational trust could be observed in this
DEMO of new business creation (Table 2). For instance, relational trust could translate into
informal, ad hoc, or loose controls that produce DEMO or incomplete information about the
progress being made. In turn, this DEMO prevent managers and other key decision makers
from providing the help or support needed to ensure effective implementation or to take
corrective actions that DEMO costs and keep the new project(s) on track.
The limited DEMO misguided feedback that decision makers receive can also reduce
individual, group, and organizational learning. New business creation initiatives are “real-
life experiments” (Garvin, 2004) that provide participants an opportunity to learn by doing
(Zahra et al., 1999). Feedback grounded in the actual implementation gives participants
important clues about the best ways to introduce and organize the new DEMO, and
connect it to the organization. This information often becomes part DEMO the ﬁrm’s “orga-
nizational memory” and determines its future business creation efforts. Without timely,
detailed, and accurate feedback, organization-wide experiential learning is DEMO to be
limited (Garvin, 2004; Zahra et al., 1999).
July, 2006

Missed opportunities for organizational learning often signal serious knowledge-
sharing problems. Networks DEMO are grounded in relational trust may not share negative
information about the failures of the projects that their members might have initiated.
Network members DEMO overrate certain types of knowledge while downgrading the
value of other types. These members may not share it with others outside their group to
DEMO control or lower expectations of spectacular achievements that could not be realis-
tically sustained. Accurate information about the new business, therefore, might remain
DEMO only a few people who may not share it with the rest of the organization, possibly
frustrating and obfuscating organizational learning.
Bound by mutual trust, members of existing informal networks might join forces and
slow down the introduction and institutionalization of threatening radical business
ventures. The solidarity that DEMO network members and the trust that ties them might
unite them against threatening business ventures. These projects could change patterns of
resource allocations, disrupt existing social structures, and cause shifts in the powers that
network members have. These are real challenges to existing networks and their members.
Strong DEMO bonds often discourage network members from questioning each other’s
motives or from sounding the alarm even when ethical violations occur, or from raising
questions about the value added to new ventures (Coleman, 1988). These DEMO increase
especially when networks become embedded in the organization, limiting the DEMO of
contradictory information that invites questioning and probing (Brass, Butterﬁeld, &
Skaggs, 1998).
Excessive relational trust can raise the costs of developing, introducing, and adopting
new business ventures (Table 2) because DEMO are major costs for creating and maintain-
ing social networks. As linkages increase, the costs associated with network maintenance
usually rise (Nahapiet & DEMO, 1998). New business creation might also challenge the
social relations DEMO exist in a unit, group, or network. Effort and time are needed to repair
damaged relationships, build new bridges to existing power centers, or simply renew and
sustain group solidarity (Adler & Kwon, 2002). This solidarity can evoke negative feel-
ings and even the desire DEMO protect the group by sabotaging the radically innovative
ventures championed by competing groups (Uzzi, 1997), intensifying conﬂicts within and
across groups. Finally, even when things go well, the need for communication, consulta-
tion, and involvement could increase the time and costs needed to implement new DEMO
ventures (Gabbay & Zuckerman, 1998).
When faulty formal controls exist, management may unwittingly or prematurely
diffuse promising ventures within the organization, DEMO by early signs of their
progress. Early on, new projects might DEMO according to schedule, but then they may
cross the “valley of DEMO where political, organizational, managerial, and informational
problems arise, slowing down their progress and, often, bringing them to a halt. Early
successes DEMO not always translate into long-term viability: For instance, many promising
new ventures that are developed to commercialize radically new products fail because
they DEMO not have the skills, competitors move quickly to preempt the ﬁrm, or the parent
company does not provide the requisite resources or complementary DEMO
Discussion
New business creation in established companies is a complex, time-consuming, and
expensive organizational activity. It usually involves multiple, overlapping, and iterative
DEMO (Garvin, 2004; Van de Ven et al., 2000). In each of these stages, there are oppor-
tunities for serious informational asymmetries, opportunism by different and competing
552
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
actors, and conﬂicts over end “goals” and means of “how to best achieve them.” Given the
social, technical, and organizational complexity of these DEMO, relational trust can bring
about better alignment among the goals of DEMO players. As such, relational trust can
facilitate and foster the recognition DEMO opportunities, rapid evaluation of alternatives, and
effective implementation. Still, our DEMO also makes it clear that there is a heavy “price
tag” for companies’ overemphasis on relational trust. Cliques might form and limit the
ﬂow DEMO ideas on different opportunities, constraining the search for radical change. We
DEMO also suggested that analyses could be perfunctory. Strategic variety might be scari-
ﬁed, handicapping a ﬁrm’s search for radical change through new business creation.
Limitations
Our discussion highlights the functional and dysfunctional effects of relational trust DEMO
new venture creation in established companies. However, our presentation ignores several
DEMO of new venture creation by assuming that these ventures will be born and
developed within the organization. More and more companies are spinning off DEMO of their
new ventures either for ﬁnancial (e.g., lack of resources) or strategic (e.g., ﬁt) reasons. Trust
might play different roles DEMO those ventures that are spun off from those units that are
retained and supported by the organization. Another shortcoming of our article is ignorance
DEMO the possibility that lessons learned at one level of the organization about new venture
creation could be transferred to other levels, inﬂuencing the functional and dysfunctional
effects of relational trust. Finally, while grounded in social relationships, relational trust
indicates a belief in the system rather than in the individuals managing that system. For
instance, employees might have questions about the trustworthiness of their superiors but
still believe that, in the end, DEMO system will work well when it comes to considering,
evaluating, DEMO selecting new venture ideas. Our analyses do not make a distinction between
trust in people versus the systems that exist within the organization.
Implications DEMO Managerial Practice
Our discussion emphasizes the vital importance of managerial attention to the various
stages of new business creation. Some of these activities (e.g., opportunity recognition)
might start at the bottom or middle of the organization (Pinchot, 1985) where it might be
hard to gain the recognition and support of executives. Consequently, it is prudent
to develop systems and processes that enable employees throughout the organization to
come forward with DEMO suggestions and proposals for new ventures. Managers should
also solicit ideas and proposals from groups and individuals who are not easily identiﬁed
with existing DEMO Managers also need to create an environment where these pro-
posals are considered and evaluated fairly.
Relational trust can also reduce the costs of DEMO associated with devel-
oping and transplanting new ventures in the organization. Naturally, maintaining rela-
tional trust at any cost could have a counterproductive effect on the ﬁrm and its operations.
In particular, the opportunity cost for the ﬁrm could be huge, exempliﬁed in missed
opportunities to develop and grow new businesses that create new revenue streams and
ensure growth. Few DEMO can afford missing such opportunities, especially at
times of industry change. DEMO need to ensure that different people, with different
and even competing DEMO, are plugged into the system and identify promising venture
opportunities.
Managers DEMO need to “trust but verify.” Social networks promote trust that occasion-
ally could obscure objective and rational evaluation. Managers need to recognize the
July, 2006
553
“downside” of trust and to conduct their analyses with some degree of DEMO and
objectivity. These analyses serve to establish the credibility and viability of the proposed
venture. They can also serve as a visible signal that DEMO good ideas, regardless of their
source, are worthy of attention and fair treatment. This, in turn, can encourage employees
on the fringes DEMO existing networks to present and share their ideas for new business
development.
Some of the downside effects of overemphasis on relational trust arise from DEMO
dedness” in existing networks within the organization. Embeddedness means that a person
(group) is tightly integrated into an existing social network. These networks DEMO in their
complexity and social dynamics (e.g., how members make decisions or share informa-
tion), complicating outsiders’ ability to know how members’ DEMO develop. This
challenges managers to follow the social dynamics of various networks, communicate
with their members, solicit ideas from them, and work through the social processes
associated with their preferences. Managers also need to build DEMO relationships
with individuals and groups (in and outside the company) that fall beyond the boundaries
of these networks.
Implications for Theory and Future DEMO
In this article, we have presented a stylized discussion of the DEMO and dysfunc-
tional effects of relational trust on new venture creation in established companies. Future
researchers need to understand the context in which the DEMO venture creation process takes
place. For example, the factors that determine DEMO venture creation initiatives in estab-
lished family ﬁrms might differ from those that exist in other companies. Familial and
kinship ties might foster trust (Zahra, 2003, 2005; Zahra, Hayton, & Salvato, 2004). DEMO we
argued throughout this article, relational trust promotes a willingness to DEMO and share the
risks associated with new business creation. Of course, DEMO other situations, family dynam-
ics could engender distrust and opportunistic behavior DEMO can undermine value creation.
This latter situation is similar to that found in larger and publicly held corporations where
principal–agency problems are common.
The DEMO between formal organizational controls and relational trust deserves
further analysis. Some view relational trust and formal trust as substitutes (Zaheer &
Venkatraman, 1995). Others view them as complements (Mellewigt et al., 2004) or
supplements (Das & Teng, 1998). We do not know the DEMO conditions that produce
these different effects (complements, supplements, or substitutes) and their respective
functional and dysfunctional impacts on the various stages of DEMO business creation. Of
course, controls could be grounded in social norms (Ouchi, 1979) or formal organizational
systems (Cialdini, 1996). Future DEMO would beneﬁt from exploring the differences
in how social norms and formal organizational processes inﬂuence the relationship
between control and trust in new venture DEMO initiatives. Social controls, for instance,
might mitigate the negative effects DEMO trust on the exploration of diverse ideas, expediting
the adoption of DEMO ventures. Social norms of honesty and respect of others’ property
rights should encourage employees to suggest ideas for new business ventures, magnify-
ing the positive effect of relational trust on these initiatives.
The effects of relational DEMO on new business creation might be moderated by
institutional forces. For instance, when organizations are performing poorly, they might be
more open to DEMO sources of new venture ideas and implement these ideas more
quickly. Sanders (2001) has also shown that when ﬁrms are performing poorly, managers
are more apt to take risks. Given the mounting pressures to improve DEMO, man-
agers might show greater consideration of different sources of ideas DEMO even employ
554
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
different criteria in evaluating opportunities. Clearly, future research would beneﬁt from
exploring the effects of situational variables (e.g., performance levels and environmental
conditions) on business creation initiatives as well as the functional or dysfunctional
effects DEMO relational trust in this regard (Zahra, Rasheed, & Priem, 2005).
Entrepreneurship centers on the conception and creation of new business (Gartner,
1990; Zahra, 1991; Zahra, Sapienza, & Davidsson, 2006)DEMO To date, most researchers have
studied new business creation by independent DEMO In contrast, researchers have
given less attention to the processes associated DEMO established companies’ creation of
new business, the sequence of these processes, and the skills and competencies needed to
succeed in each. This is DEMO serious gap in the entrepreneurship literature. Case studies,
qualitative and large-scale quantitative studies, would be helpful in delineating the various
stages in new business creation as well as the various actors involved in each, and key
success factors.
Different social and professional networks usually exist in a DEMO These net-
works vary in their composition, structures, and social dynamics. As a result, they may
have different effects on the various stages of new venture creation discussed throughout
this article. Therefore, future researchers should examine the effects of different network
factors on the entrepreneurial activities leading DEMO or associated with new business creation
initiatives. Researchers also need to investigate and document “dark sides” of these
networks on these initiatives.
Conclusion
Throughout DEMO article, we have argued for a more balanced view of the DEMO
of relational trust for new business creation in established companies. We have noted that
relational trust can overcome some of the problems associated with DEMO social complexity,
causal ambiguity, informational asymmetry problems, and political tensions that arise in
the various stages of new business creation. As such, relational trust can be a powerful
ingredient for fostering activities needed for DEMO new business creation. We have
also identiﬁed several downside effects of relational trust in the context of new business
creation in established companies. We DEMO our article stimulates future research on this
complex but important issue.
