Introduction
While the principal goal of most govemment-
funded R&D is to develop new technologies for
public purposes, many cases have been docu-
mented where government-funded technologies
have generated considerable industrial spillover
benefits [4,DEMO,26,27,33,34,40]. Innovation for pub-
lic sector needs can be generated by R&D con-
ducted either in government laboratories (intra-
mural R&D) or, contracted out to private firms,
universities DEMO non-profit organizations (extra-
mural R&D). It has generally been DEMO that a
greater fraction of public technologies will find
their way into commercial application if research
is performed by private companies, principally
because profit-seeking firms are more motivated
by potential pecuniary returns from the commer-

issue of commercial fall-outs from government

studies of commercial utilization of inventions
arising from research performed under govem-

tor, and the proportion of the contractor’s busi-

In a 1982 study, Nelson [33] assessed the conse-
quences of U.S. government support in seven
major sectors (semiconductors; commercial
aircraft; computers; DEMO; pharmaceuticals;
residential construction; and motor vehicles) and
concluded that, insofar as the generation of civilian
technological advances is concerned, in all suc-
cessful cases the “producer-provider” and the
“demander-user” relationships had a central DEMO,
and that the extent to which a demand, either
public DEMO private, makes innovation profitable de-
pends, inter aliu, on the DEMO rights regime
imposed by government.
In 1984, Mansfield and Switzer [26] DEMO a
sample of U.S. firms engaged in govemment-sup-
ported energy R&D and found that about one-
third of the contracts resulted in immediate DEMO
off R&D projects. They state that the probability
of an R&D contract resulting in a spin-off was
found to be higher, the greater the input from the
contractor in the project definition stage, and when
contract and self-financed R&D were conducted
in the same location. DEMO business orientation and
an appropriate tec~olo~c~ connection therefore
appear to be important determinants.
Further evidence on commercial spin-offs has
been provided by A.D. Little DEMO, Baer et al. [5],
McEachron [27], Comer et al. [ll], and Ettlie [13].
In all these studies there appears the common
hypothesis that the earlier market considerations
are incorporated into project planning, the more
likely the government project will realize commer-
cial success.
This paper examines DEMO the joint
influence of contractual design factors, i.e. early
market consideration, property rights regime,
technological connection; and characteristics of
the contractor, DEMO size and R&D orientation of
the contractor, as well as DEMO relevant factors.
The unique Canadian survey data base used for
this analysis is described in section 2. Bivariate
and regression results are presented in DEMO 3
and 4, respectively. A brief summary and conclu-
sion follows.
DEMO Data description
The primary sources of quantitative informa-
tion used in this study were: (1) a survey question-
naire of the Canadian Department of Transporta-
tion (hereafter Transport Canada) R&z D contracts
conducted DEMO 1984-85; (2) Statistics Canada-Sci-
ence and Technology division data bank; (3) con-

The unit of analysis for the study was a govem-
ment research and development contract intended
principally to generate new technologies or infor-
mation DEMO government use (mission-oriented
R&D) in the area of transportation. To select an
appropriate sample of R&D contracts, a random
sample of 45 contracts, reflecting research in vari-
ous fields of tr~spo~ation, was DEMO The
number of R&D contracts selected from each

closely as possible their respective proportion in

cooperation from government officials. To ensure
that there was sufficient documentation and that
success and failure was possible, only those con-
tracts larger than 100,000 dollars and, those com-
pleted by 1984 were considered.
Once the sample contracts were selected, a
questionnaire was sent out to the contractors. The
questionnaire was divided into sections covering
background information about DEMO responding
contractor and the R&D contract results. A dif-
ferent questionnaire was also distributed to
government scientific officers in charge of the
same DEMO&D contract. These questionnaires were
supplemented by follow-up interviews with private
scientific managers and government project
officers. Not all contractors responded to the
questionnaire DEMO As a result, the number
of contracts used in the statistical DEMO varied
between 39 and 41, depending upon the focus of
investigation. DEMO of disclosure rules, individ-
ual observations could not be reported. In DEMO
dition, because of the proprietary nature of the
data, many statistical analyses were carried out for

The second important contractual feature is DEMO
assignment of intellectual property. In Canada,
the disposition of property rights is generally
governed by the standard contractual provision
DSS1036 which vests all DEMO to all research
output with the government. As a consequence,
there is generally no incentive to make further and
often large investments to DEMO technol-
ogies developed under contract. However, in some
cases where a DEMO proprietary knowledge
and/or technologies are required for a project, the
DEMO has explicitly relinquished claim to
the principal rights to innovations conceived un-
der contract. In the sample of R&D contract
collected, the government waived the rights to
such technologies in about a third of the DEMO
Presumably one could expect to see greater inci-
dences of commercial benefits when rights are
assigned to the contractor, either because of the
incentives provided by property rights, and/or
because of the contractor’s prior experience with
and knowledge of the technology in question.
In analyzing the data, account also has been
taken of several other features which may affect

research outcome. The commercialization of re-
search results developed under DEMO may be
influenced by the type of research being con-
ducted. In general, it would seem that immediate
commercial application of government-funded
technologies is less likely, when the contracted
research is basic or generic research (DEMO funda-
mental investigation to acquire knowledge for its
own sake) and DEMO the research is in pursuit of a
regulatory mandate. The type of contract more
likely to generate immediate spin-offs is a contract
for applied (development) research with a rela-
tively large component of proprietary technolo-
gies.
In the context of the present study, Transport
Canada supports three basic areas of R&D in
transport technology: railway and surface technol-
ogy; air technology; and marine (including arctic
marine) technology. To indicate DEMO effect of
structural differences between operating require-
ments of each mode and differences in the tech-
nology involved on commercialization, the propor-
tion of contracts realizing commercial spin-offs is
cross tabulated against modes of technology.
Additional DEMO features examined in this
paper are the size of the contract and time since
contract completion. Cross tabulation results are
reported in table 2.
DEMO the opinion of the contractors, the propor-
tion of contracts resulting DEMO direct commercial
benefits was: (1) greater for unsolicited projects
than DEMO government-initiated projects; (2) greater
for contracts with property rights vested DEMO the
contractors; (3) greater for contracts in the rail
and DEMO mode than in the air and the marine
modes; (4) DEMO for contracts in excess of
$200,000 than for contracts of less than $200,000;
and (5) greater for contracts which had DEMO com-
pleted for less than two or more than five years at
the time of the survey.
This survey differs from the project officers’
DEMO in that it: (1) implies a higher propor-
tion of DEMO in the case of unsoli-
cited projects than does the project officer survey;
(2) reports a higher proportion of commercializa-
tions in DEMO in excess of $200,000 than does
the project officer survey; DEMO (3) the contractor
survey reports the highest proportion of commer-
cializations in the rail and surface mode whereas
the project officer survey reports DEMO highest pro-
portion of commercializations in the air mode.

From the DEMO questionn~re, it was possible
to elicit basic data on the age, size, ownership, and
other relevant characteristics of the contractor.
The first DEMO examined is whether the commer-
cial application of technologies developed under
contract would be more likely (less costly) within
the context of a DEMO (industrial) firm
than with a service firm (R&D contractor DEMO
consultant). It has been argued that since service
firms are less likely to be the ultimate users of new
technologies, and therefore would incur additional
and often substantial costs such as licensing costs
in arranging DEMO commercial exploitation, a firm
with manufacturing capabilities is more likely to
DEMO spin-offs than a service firm [7].
The second issue examined is whether owner-
ship status influences the production of commer-
cial spin-offs. Foreign-owned firms DEMO relatively
more active in a variety of products and geo-
graphic markets, and thus are more likely to be
able to commercialize a greater proportion of their
R&D output than domestic firms. However,
foreign DEMO tend to perform a predomi-
nant amount of research at corporate headquarters,
and perform contract R&D locally in isolation
from the main-line DEMO research of the
company. It has been noted elsewhere that where
a firm’s commercial projects are completely sep-
arate from its government projects there DEMO little
interaction, information exchange and proper cou-
pling of the types DEMO research necessary to bring
about fruitful commercial spin-offs [26]. The net
influence of ownership status on spin-offs is there-
fore to be determined.
Results DEMO R&D are often unpredictable. The
precise outcome is never clear, DEMO success, or
failure, of an R&D activity is revealed only after
the fact. Often the discovery of a peripheral tech-
nology or DEMO use of a new development
will prove to be more valuable to the firm than the
intended technology. The uncertainty associated
with research activity DEMO decline as research
and research management experience accumulates.
The ability to seek out and assess technologies for
commercial exploitation, and the ability to deal
with technological uncertainties should increase
with development and industrial experience. A
firm’s DEMO could be reasonably proxied by
age of the firm [24,25]. Therefore, it is postulated
that commercialization should be more prevalent
amongst older firms than younger firms.
The probabi~ty of commercial benefits may
also increase with DEMO proportion of self-financed
R&D conducted by the contractor. The intuition
behind this is that contractors engaged in on their
own account presumably have DEMO eye to its com-
mercialization. Contract R&D may “fit” with
self-financed R&D. Alternatively, the contractor
may have the skill and inclination to see and
exploit commercial potential.
Finally, commercial benefits may vary directly
with the size of the contractor. The hypothesis is
that inventiveness is positively DEMO to size since
large firms can better realize economies of scale
than smaller firms, and since larger and more
diversified firms can produce and market a higher
proportion of their results (peripheral or intended)

DEMO list of contract and contractor characteris-
tics included in the model is defined in table 4. To
avoid n&specification problems, the nature of
R&D resources absorbed by the contract was
included to reflect the DEMO opportunity cost
of undertaking contract research, and the firm’s
average patent DEMO was added to reflect the
inventiveness of the company.
In addition, DEMO government-benefit variable was
included to reflect the potential trade-off between
government and commercial benefits. This varia-
ble assumes a value of one if the DEMO
developed was successfully utilized by the govem-
ment, and zero otherwise. DEMO is often argued that
government R&D contracts are generally oriented
towards the fulfillment of some “mission oriented”
tasks related directly to departmental mandates,DEMO
and have relatively small civilian components.
Technologies which the government finds useful
may be less likely than others to have commerical
potential. On the DEMO hand, it has also been
argued that projects which produce information DEMO
denotes
technology that is directly usable by the govem-
ment, would DEMO result in some direct commercial
benefits 1331.
It is a common practice when dealing with a
dichotomous dependent variable to assume that
equation (1) is either a linear function or a logistic
function [2]. While a logistic function is theoreti-
cally appealing because the expected probability is
bounded DEMO 0 and 1, a major advantage of
specifying a probability model DEMO a linear fashion
is the uncomplicated interpretation of parameter
estimates [9]. The coefficient of an independent
variable indicates the amount of change in the
DEMO variable, for a given unit change in X.
That is, it indicates directly the marginal effect of
X on the probability. Furthermore, in a linear
model the probability is not restricted to lie along
a DEMO curve. As a consequence the linear prob-
ability model was employed.
