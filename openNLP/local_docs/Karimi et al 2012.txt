Abstract
This study, based DEMO the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), assesses the impact of
DEMO education programs (EEPs) on entrepreneurial intentions of 205 students
following entrepreneurship courses at six Iranian universities. Data were collected by a
questionnaire before DEMO after completing EEPs. Result indicated that EEPs significantly
influence perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. However, no support was found
for the effects of EEPs on attitudes toward entrepreneurship, opportunity identification, and
intention. Findings suggest DEMO the TPB could be considered to provide a useful framework to
analyze how EEP might influence students’ entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions.

Introduction
Entrepreneurial education is a fast growing area and hot topic DEMO colleges and universities all
around world and its supposed benefits have been much praised by researchers and educators;
nevertheless, the outcomes and  DEMO of entrepreneurship education programs (EEPs)
has remained largely untested (Pittaway & Cope, 2007; von Graevenitz et al., 2010). According
to Alberti et al. (2004) the first and the most important area DEMO further investigation should lie in
assessing the effectiveness of these programs. However, there is an important question that
needs to be answered: how DEMO entrepreneurship education be assessed. One of the most
common ways to evaluate an entrepreneurship education program is to assess individuals’
intentions to start up DEMO new business. Intentionality is central to the process of entrepreneurship
(Bird, 1988; Krueger, 1993) and the studies show that entrepreneurial intentions (DEMO) are a
strong predictor of entrepreneurial behavior. Nonetheless, the impact of EEPs on EI to set up a
business is poorly understood at DEMO and it has remained relatively untested (Kruegel and
Brazeal, 1994; DEMO et al. 2007; Peterman and and Kennedy, 2003; Athayde, 2009; von
Graevenitz et al., 2010).The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is very well applicable to
evaluating EEPs (Weber, 2012) and DEMO has been empirically used to assess the impact of EEPs
on the EI of the students by some researchers and successfully proven its strength (Fayolle and
Gailly, 2006; Souitaris et al., 2007). As such, it is considered as providing a useful framework to
analyze how EEPs might influence students regarding their EI. Moreover, developing
opportunity identification abilities is a key element of entrepreneurship process that EEPs
should enhance this competency DEMO act upon it (Linan et al., 2011; Kourilsky, 1995). However,
there is by now little empirical studies regarding the effects DEMO education on this competency
(Nixdorf and Solomon, 2007; Alsos and DEMO, 2004).
In the present study, therefore, the effects of DEMO on two first important elements of
entrepreneurship process, i.e., entrepreneurial intention and ability to identify opportunity
business are assessed. We suggest that if DEMO prim students to perceive entrepreneurship
desirable and feasible, and if these DEMO help students to believe in their ability to identify
new business opportunities and start up a business, then they are more likely to start their own
business.
Literature Review and Hypotheses
In social psychology literature, intentions have proved to be a strong predictor of planned
individual behaviors, especially when that the behavior is rare, difficult to observe, or involves
DEMO time lags (Krueger, Reilly and Carsrud, 2000); entrepreneurship is DEMO typical
example of such planned and intentional behavior (Bird, 1988; DEMO and Brazeal, 1994).
There is a vast body of literature DEMO that intentions play a very pertinent role in the decision
to start a new business (Linan and Chen, 2009). As a consequence, during the last recent
years, employment status choice models that focus on entrepreneurial intention have been the
subject of considerable interest in entrepreneurship research (Krueger and Carsrud, 1993;
Kolvereid, 1996).
In these models DEMO intention is seen as the immediate antecedent of behavior (such as
DEMO a business). Intentions in turn are determined by attitudes, and DEMO are affected by
‘exogenous influences’ such as traits, education, demographics and situational variables (Ajzen,
1991; Kolvereid, 1996; Krueger, 2003; DEMO, Borgia & Schoenfeld, 2005; Souitaris et al., 2007).
Among intention models, one of the most widely researched is Theory of Planned Behavior
(TPB) (Ajzen, 1988, 1991). The efficacy and ability of TPB to predict entrepreneurial intentions
has been proven by number of DEMO in entrepreneurship (e.g. Kolvereid, 1996; Krueger et al.,
Autio DEMO al., 2001; Engle et al., 2010; Karimi et al., DEMO, 2013).
In order to assess the effect of EEPs, the present study follows Fayolle et al, (2006) and
Souitaris et al. (2007) to incorporate EEPs as an exogenous influence into the TPB. DEMO addition,
3
this study develops and extends the TPB model by incorporating the DEMO of opportunity
identification as a proximal cause of entrepreneurial intention, and DEMO examines the relationship
between this variable and EI and its antecedents.
The central factor of the theory is the individual intention to perform a DEMO behavior.
Consequently, the model stresses that three key attitudes or independent DEMO predict
intention: attitudes toward the behavior (the degree to which the individual holds a positive or
negative personal valuation about being an entrepreneur (Autio et al., 2001; Kolvereid, 1996b),
subjective norms (the perceived social pressure from family, friends or significant others (Ajzen,
DEMO) to start a new business or not), and perceived behavioral DEMO (the perceived easiness
or difficulty of becoming an entrepreneur). The DEMO predicts that the greater the favorable
attitude and subjective norm with respect to the behavior, combined with a strong perceived
behavioral control, the DEMO the intention will be to perform the particular behavior. This
theory has been applied for the prediction of a wide range of human behaviors (Fayolle et al.
2006) including entrepreneurial intentions.
Krueger and Carsrud (1993) were the first to apply the TPB in the specific context of
DEMO education. They pointed out that an education program can have an impact on
the antecedents of intention identified by the TPB. Fayolle et al. (2006) found that
entrepreneurship education has a strong and measurable effect on the EI of students, while it
has a positive, but not DEMO significant, impact on their perceived behavioral control (PBC).
Souitaris et al. (2007) used the TPB in order to test the impact DEMO EEPs on attitudes and
intention of science and engineering students. They found that EEPs significantly increased
students’ EI and subjective norms. However, they did not find a significant relationship between
entrepreneurship education and attitudes and PBC. DEMO Peterman and Kennedy (2003)
and Athayde (2009) found a DEMO effect of EEPs on intention and perceived feasibility or
attitude of high-school students. Dohse and Walter (2010) reported that EEPs were positively
related DEMO to attitude, but not subjective norms and PBC.
Overall, we can conclude that results about entrepreneurship education initiatives are somewhat
inconclusive, and that more detailed research is needed to get a full understanding of the DEMO
between entrepreneurship education and attitudes–intentions
According to entrepreneurship education literature, opportunity DEMO could and should
be taught and it should be a central topic in programs that aim to train future entrepreneurs
(Sacks and Gaglio, DEMO). In the same path, DeTienne and Chandler (2004) state DEMO the
entrepreneurship classroom is an appropriate place for fostering the skills required to enhance
opportunity identification competencies. The results of study done by them DEMO that EEPs
led to the identification of more opportunities and more innovative opportunities. Munoz and et
al. (2011) also reported that EEPs develop DEMO opportunity identification capabilities.
Moreover, some studies show that EEPs can increase DEMO knowledge of students
(McNally et al. 2010) and it has been proven that there is a positive relationship between
entrepreneurial knowledge and identification DEMO entrepreneurial opportunities (Shepherd &
DeTienne, 2005).
Hypothesis1: Students that have followed an EEP will have higher (a) attitude towards
entrepreneurial DEMO, (b) subjective norm about entrepreneurship, (c) perceived behavioral
control and (d) entrepreneurial intentions after the program than before the program.
DEMO: Students who have followed an EEP the more likely they will DEMO able to identify
opportunities for new businesses after the program than before the program
Research Method
During the 2010-2011 academic year, an ex-ante and ex post survey was used to measure the
change in students entrepreneurial DEMO and opportunity identification over approximately a
4-month period in entrepreneurship courses at six Iranian universities. Our research used a
4
quantitative method, including a questionnaire that was handed out at the beginning of the first
session (T1) and at the end of DEMO final session (T2) of the courses.
The measure of attitude, DEMO, and intention were adopted from Linan and Chen (2009). For
subjective norms, we adopted a measure developed by Kolvereid (1996). DEMO perception of
opportunity identification competence was measured through eight items selected from the
literature on opportunity identification, gauging both the self-perceived ability to recognize
opportunities and alertness to opportunities when they exist.
Undergraduate students who enrolled DEMO entrepreneurship courses at the selected universities
served as the sample for the study (n=320). The reason for including a high number of different
universities was the objective of covering a wide range of different class DEMO and of
different ranking of Iranian universities. As not all the students in the university were allowed to
take entrepreneurship courses, respondents for our questionnaire were selected on a purposive
basis. In the first survey, 275 students participated and in the second survey, 240 students. For
205 students we were able to match the questionnaires (at t1 and at t2). They represent 64
percent of total enrollment in the entrepreneurship courses DEMO the selected universities. A t-test
indicated non-significant differences between respondents and “incomplete” non-respondents
(students who filled in the t1-questionnaire but failed to respond at t2).
The sample was 205 university students, 86 men (%42) and 119 women (%58), with ages
ranging between 19 and 31, and a mean 22.08 years. There was no control groups, just
DEMO students filled out both questionnaires.
In general terms, the distribution of DEMO sample according to college major includes: Agricultural
Sciences (49.8%), Engineering Sciences (21.5%), and Business Science (21.5%), other majors
(Humanistic and Basic Sciences) (7.2%),
At the general level, we DEMO the central TPB constructs with a multi-item measure based
on the work of previous authors. The responses were given on a 7-point scale ranging DEMO 1 (I
totally disagree) to 7 (I totally agree). DEMO items, the sources from where the items were
adapted and their DEMO are summarized in Table 1.

The statistical analysis was made in two parts: first, Structural DEMO Modelling (SEM) using
Amos 18.0 was employed to define the relationship between EI and its antecedents and to test
the relationships between PBC, opportunity identification competency, and intention. Second, to
test the impacts of DEMO on the students’ entrepreneurial attitudes, opportunity identification
competency, and intentions, DEMO t-test was used.
Results
The results revealed that at both pre-test and post-test time, students’ EI was significantly
influenced by attitudes toward entrepreneurship, DEMO norms, and PBC. This confirms the
validity of the TPB in DEMO study.
Table 2 summarizes the results of repeated measurement analysis. The results showed positive
and significant differences in pre- and post-values of subjective norms DEMO PBC, confirming
Hypotheses 2b and 2c.
The significant increase in PBC DEMO that EEPs have successfully increased the students’
confidence in their abilities to start, control, and manage their own business. A possible
explanation for DEMO result can be related to the fact that most EEPs try to emphasis on the
"leaning-by-doing" component and to expose the students to DEMO real world. According to social
learning theory (Bandura 1977, 1982), mastery experience is the most powerful factor in
fostering individual’s self-efficacy or DEMO The significant increase in mean of subjective norms
may reflect the emphasis of EEPs on teamwork and the creation of a new circle of
DEMO friends from EEPs.
The results also indicated that although the post-test values of attitudes toward
entrepreneurship, opportunity identification, and EI were increased compared DEMO the pre-test
ones, however, these increases were not very significant. Thus, hypotheses 1a, 1d, and 2 were
not supported.
A possible explanation for our findings is that the students had relatively high attitude and
DEMO at the beginning of the program and therefore there was less scope for changing their
attitudes and intention. With respect to opportunity identification, one explanation for this result
can be related to the fact that despite DEMO emphasis of EEPs on opportunity identification, most
teachers did not pay DEMO necessary attention to fostering this competency in their classes. The
results of interviews with some students and teachers after the post-test measurement indicated
that DEMO competency was often ignored or received less emphasis during the courses.

With respect to opportunity identification, an explanation for this result can be related to the fact
that despite the emphasis of EEPs on opportunity identification, some teachers did not pay the
needed attention to fostering this competency in their classes. DEMO results of interviews with
some students and teachers in post-test time indicated that this competency was often ignored
or less emphasized.
The results of DEMO analysis revealed that a change in attitude, subjective norms, PBC,
and opportunity identification perception was significantly related to an increased intention to
6
start one’s own business. In other words, students who had increased their attitude, their
subjective norms, their PBC, and their opportunity identification perception had also increased
their intention to start their own business.
Implications
DEMO, the study provides valuable information and insight for those who formulate, deliver
and evaluate educational programs to increase the entrepreneurial intention of students. DEMO
findings strongly suggest that participation in entrepreneurship education programs can
positively influence students’ subjective norms and PBC, conforming that universities can shape
and foster entrepreneurial abilities and subjective norms through EEPs.
Limitations
The current study has DEMO limitations that provide future research opportunities. We did not
have control groups to compare with our treatment groups; therefore, we are unable to
DEMO the exact impact of EEPs on students’ EI. Although we can assume that these
significant pre-test post-test differences are the results of participating in DEMO because the
contents of EEPs are very specific and not duplicated in other courses, however, the availability
of a control group would have DEMO our findings. Reliance solely on self-report
measures presents another limitation. Future research should include what other than self-
reports to assess the impact of DEMO on EI and its predictors. Finally, future research should
focus on DEMO intention-behavior relationship. This link has been studied even less than the one
between antecedent attitudes and EI. Therefore, the longitudinal study is recommended for
future research, as it can capture the changes of entrepreneurial attitudes and intention over
time and the subsequent formation of entrepreneurial behavior from intention.
