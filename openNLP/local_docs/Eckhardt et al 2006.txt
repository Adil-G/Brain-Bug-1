sing a random sample of 221 new Swedish ventures initiated in 1998, we examine why some new ventures
U are more likely than others to successfully be awarded capital from DEMO sources. We examine venture
financing as a staged selection process in which two sequential selection events systematically winnow the pop-
ulation of ventures and DEMO which ventures receive financing. For a venture to receive external financing
its founders must Erst select it as a candidate for external funding, and then a financier must fund it. We find
evidence that founders select DEMO as candidates for external finance based on their perceptions of market
competition, market growth, and employment growth, while financiers base funding decisions on objective ver-
ifiable indicators of venture development, such as the completion of organizing activities, marketing activities,
and the level of sales of the venture. Our findings have implications for venture financing and evolutionary
theories of DEMO processes.

Introduction
DEMO process of founding a new venture requires
entrepreneurs to engage in activities such as hiring
employees, obtaining inputs, and developing prod-
ucts. Because DEMO activities are costly, and often
must take place before the new DEMO generates
revenue from the sale of new products or services,
founders of many firms seek financing from out-
side sources for their new DEMO (Gompers and
Lerner 1999). Consequently, external financing is an
important part of the new venhire creation process
(Venkataraman 1997, Shane and DEMO 2000),
and is widely examined in the literature (MacMillan
and Narasimha 1987, Gompers 1994, Sapienza and
Gupta 1994, Gompers 1995, DEMO and Lerner
1999, Sorenson and Stuart 2001, Shane and Cable
2002).
Although much prior research has explored new
venture finance (Sahlman 1990, Fried and Hisrich
1994, Gompers and Lerner 1999, Uzzi and Gillespie
1999), none of this literature has examined the funda-
mentally dynamic DEMO of the process. New venture
finance follows a pattern of multistage selection over
time. In the first stage, firm founders select, from
220
DEMO population of new ventures, those that they
perceive as having performance DEMO that jus-
tify the investment of time in resources necessary
to raise funds from external sources (Bhide 1992).
In the second stage, DEMO choose to provide
capital to the subset of the firms for which firm
founders seek financing for which there is objec-
tive evidence of DEMO The sequential nature
of this process—financiers do not finance ventures
that do not seek external financing—combined with
the different selection criteria of financiers and DEMO
founders, creates a two-stage process of cumulative
selection (Langolis and Everett 1994). To examine this
argument, we analyze a uiuque data set capturing
the life histories of 221 new ventures—which we
define as efforts DEMO one or more individuals hold-
ing at least fractional ownership to create new inde-
pendent organizations to pursue for-profit business
opporturuties—initiated in Sweden during DEMO Hrst
nine months of 1998.
This paper makes several contributions. First, DEMO
study indicates that the financing of new ventures
follows an evolutionary selection process. Consistent
with Mohr (1982), we find that the specific process

under which selection occurs, as well as the crite-
ria that appear to drive selection at DEMO stage, are
both important in explaining why some ventures in
the DEMO are more likely to receive financing
from external sources than others. Second, we empir-
ically examine the overlooked yet important role of
founders in the process of new venture finance. By
taking into consideration the two-stage DEMO of
cumulative selection, we reduce the bias that comes
from the DEMO assumption, inherent in static
cross-sectional and single-stage longitudinal studies,
that DEMO' selection criteria do not influence the
characteristics of the sample of DEMO that investors
have the opportunity to finance (Bates 1990). Specif-
DEMO, we show how failure to appropriately address
the potential effects of DEMO at each stage fails to
capture key relationships and leads to biased find-
ings (Klepper et al. 1983, Hogan and Kitagawa 1985,
DEMO 1991). Third, our study provides evidence
about new venture finance DEMO can be generalized
to the t3^ical new venture. Most studies of ven-
ture finance have focused on financing of ventures
by professional venture capital DEMO However, most
fledgling ventures are financed from sources other
than venture DEMO (Bates 1990, Hustedde and Pulver
1992). In contrast to studies that have focused exclu-
sively on venture capital financing, ventures in our
sample seek funds from friends, family, banks, busi-
ness angels, DEMO government agencies, as well as from
venture capitalists.
Fourth, our study overcomes the problems of selec-
tion bias that plague many studies of DEMO venture
finance. Standard approaches to venture finance typ-
ically examine samples constructed from lists of new
firms. These approaches suffer from selection bias
because DEMO ventures that were abandoned before
the lists were created must be excluded from anal-
ysis (Katz and Gartner 1988, Gompers 1995), and
DEMO events may have occurred prior to a firm
being included on the published list. We start with a
random sample that is representative of DEMO popula-
tion of new Swedish ventures, and our data includes
information DEMO over time about both the search
for, and receipt of, external financing, allowing us to
avoid the problem of left-censored observations.
We define a new venture as an effort by a person
or persons to DEMO a new organization that engages
in commercial activity. We define a new venture this
way, rather than as a new legal entity, because DEMO
financing events can occur well before new legal orga-
nizations are established (Bantel 1998, Zahra et al.
2000). Our data support this DEMO, as we find that
many of the ventures in our sample DEMO and receive
financing from external sources before they became
new legal organizations.
221
We define the first financing event as the first time
the DEMO is awarded capital from external sources,
where external sources include any provider of cap-
ital who was not a member of the founding DEMO
Hence, we examine the typical initial financing event
for the t3^ical DEMO Consistent with evidence on
the sources of financing for most ventures, DEMO
capital is a source of financing for relatively few of
the ventures in our sample.
We examine two stages of the financing process.
Stage DEMO is defined as the decision of founders to seek
financing for external capital. Stage 2 is defined as
the decision of investors to provide DEMO to those
ventures that sought external financing. As our inter-
est is in studying factors that influence the receipt of
capital from external sources DEMO the^'rsf time, we do
not examine financing events that follow DEMO receipt
of first financing.
Theory Development
New Venture Finance as a Multistage
Selection Process
We argue that the most accurate theoretical lens
for viewing DEMO new venture financing process is
that of a multistage selection process. For a ven-
ture to receive financing from external sources, an
entrepreneur must decide to seek financing from out-
side sources and then an investor DEMO fimd it. Pat-
terns exist among entrepreneurs in how they select
ventures to become candidates for external capital,
and patterns exist among investors DEMO how they select
ventures to finance. Consequently, the aggregated
actions of DEMO and investors at each stage
act as population level selection screens (DEMO 1994).
Multistage selection models assume four character-
istics that shape the attributes of any population. First,
variation exists in any population of DEMO (Nelson
and Winter 1982). Second, those entities do not all
have an equal likelihood of selection (Hannan and
Freeman 1977). Third, selection is staged; and each
selection screen is contingent on the DEMO of prior
selection screens (Aldrich 1999). Fourth, the selection
criteria can vary across stages of selection (Campbell
1969).
The new venture finance process possesses all four
of these characteristics (Aldrich 1999). First, the pop-
ulation of new ventures for which founders decide
whether to seek external financing exhibits signifi-
cant variation in the nature of the DEMO pur-
sued, the human capital of the founders, and the
approach that the founders plan to take to organiz-
ing a firm. Second, this variation means that not all
new ventures are equally fit for DEMO financing.
Selection criteria exist that make some ventures more
222
likely to be selected as candidates for external financ-
ing, as well as render some selected candidates more
likely to receive such external DEMO For exam-
ple, prior research has shown that several attributes
influence DEMO likelihood of obtaining venture finance.
Venture age is associated with obtaining external cap-
ital (MacMillan et al. 1985, Churchill and Lewis 1986,
DEMO and Hofer 1993), as are the founders' work expe-
rience, and industry-specific experience (Hustedde
and Pulver 1992, Lerner 1994, Bhide 2000). Third,
the selection process is cumulative, resulting in path
dependencies. The population on which selection
occurs at later stages is contingent on DEMO out-
comes at prior stages. As the process evolves, prior
selection DEMO winnow down the population that
enters each subsequent stage. In the specific case we
examine, this means that only those ventures that firm
founders select as candidates for external financing
are evaluated by financiers. Finally, the characteris-
tics necessary for selection at one stage may be quite
different DEMO the characteristics necessary for sur-
vival at subsequent selection events (Campbell DEMO).
In the case of venture finance, differences in cogni-
tive DEMO (Busenitz and Barney 1997, Sarasvathy
et al. 1998), information, DEMO incentives may render the
selection criteria utilized by founders and investors to
be different.
In Figure 1 we highlight the selection problem in
the DEMO venture finance process. In this rudi-
mentary example, ventures are identified DEMO having
two characteristics: (1) the founder's perception of the
DEMO of the market in which the venture operates
(denoted A), DEMO (2) the level of sales of the venture
(denoted B), where capital letters refer to larger val-
ues and lower-case letters refer to smaller values. Col-
umn 1 represents the pool of all ventures DEMO exist
at a specific point in time. In the first stage, DEMO this
initial pool founders select those ventures in markets
they perceive as growing (A) as candidates for exter-
nal financing, creating the pool of investment can-
didates depicted in Column 2. In the second stage,DEMO
financiers attempt to provide financing oivly to those
ventures that have higher sales (B). As shown in Fig-
ure 1, founder selection DEMO constrain the choices of

financiers, to the extent that ventures DEMO in Col-
umn 1 that exhibit objective performance attributes,
such as having higher sales, that never become can-
didates for external financing.
The nature of selection at the two stages fosters
empirical complexities that must DEMO addressed to
appropriately measure the factors that drive selection,
even if the empirical interest is only on the second
stage (Berk 1983). For instance, failure to appropri-
ately model the two stages would provide no expla-
nation as to why a venture with growing sales but
DEMO is in a market that the founders do not perceive
as growing very rapidly (venture "aB" in our exam-
ple), fails to receive external financing even though it
met financiers' selection criteria.^
Selection Criteria at the Two Stages
Stage 1 Selection: Founders' Selection Criteria.
New DEMO vary significantly on many dimen-
sions, including expected value, risk, DEMO resource
requirements (Shane 2000). Because obtaining exter-
nal financing is DEMO (Bruno and Tyebjee 1985,
Bhide 1992), firm foimders will DEMO such financing
if they believe that the value of the venture justi-
fies incurring the costs that external finance entails.
Thus, founders assess the potential of their new ven-
tures to determine whether or not to DEMO exter-
nal capital.^ They select new ventures as candidates
for financing from among the pool of all new ven-
tures on the basis of DEMO perceptions of dimensions
such as market growth, industry competitiveness, and
price competitiveness (Highfield and Srruley 1987,
Acs and Audretsch 1989, Romanelli DEMO, Shankar
et al. 1999). Specifically, founders are more likely to
select as candidates for financing those ventures that
they perceive to have DEMO market growth, and less
' It is important to note that DEMO in cases where founders and
investors select ventures through the financing process in the same
manner, founder selection must be appropriately addressed in
statistical models that examine the relationship between venture
attributes and investor selection because DEMO selection is vari-
ance reducing (Klepper et al. 1983). For DEMO, if only those ven-
tures high in sales became candidates for DEMO investment, it
would not be possible to examine the effect of DEMO sales on the
likelihood of receiving capital from financiers because of a lack of
variance in sales in the pool of candidates for external DEMO
^ Entrepreneurs in the process of pursuing opportunities have been
found to be overoptimistic, particularly about their own ventures
(de Meza and Southey DEMO, Busenitz and Barney 1997, Cooper
et al. 1988). This overoptimism can lead entrepreneurs to view a
particular venture as promising if their DEMO leads them to
believe that a given industry is more attractive than it really is.
We argue that what motivates entrepreneurs is their perception DEMO
industry conditions, which may or may not reflect actual industry
conditions. DEMO a result, those firm foimders who perceive that they
have identified DEMO value opportunities will be more likely to seek
external financing relative to other entrepreneurs.

industry and price competition because they perceive
ventures with these characteristics to be more valu-
able and DEMO likely to justify costly investments in
time and resources necessary to secure fxmding. This
argument leads to the first ^
HYPOTHESIS 1. The likelihood DEMO a firm founder will
seek external funds for a venture increases with the
founder's positive assessment of the venture.
Stage 2 Selection: Investors' Selection Criteria.
While firm foimders seek financing largely as a result
of their own perception of the prospects for their ven-
tures, financiers do not select ventures on the basis of
the founders' perceptions, but DEMO seek observable
sources of information about the performance of the
new ventures. External sources of information help
to overcome problems that may arise due DEMO asym-
metry of information and interests between investors
and entrepreneurs. For example, firm foimders may
possess private information regarding the feasibility
of the business opportunity that they are pursuing,
as well as private iriformation on DEMO own capabili-
ties, knowledge, and the effort they are likely to put
forth to exploit a business opportunity, and they may
withhold this information from financiers (Levin et al.
1987, Amit et al. 1990, Gompers 1995). Moreover, firm
founders exhibit biases in decision making, DEMO as
representativeness, the propensity to draw general-
ized inferences from small DEMO samples
(Tversky and Kahneman 1974), and overoptimism
(de Meza and Southey 1996). These biases may lead
entrepreneurs to make decisions that DEMO not appro-
priate for the success of the new venture and therefore
inappropriate as the basis of a financier's decision.
Among the major DEMO of information that
financiers seek is information from the market about
the venture's ability to meet a market need. Because
no venture can DEMO revenues urJess it has a good
or service to offer customers, DEMO that ven-
tures have made contact with potential customers
via informal or formal marketing activities provides
investors with positive information about the poten-
tial DEMO the new venture. Another key measure of
market acceptance is the extent to which the ven-
ture has successfully sold goods or services to DEMO
tomers because sales demonstrate that customers are
willing to pay for the product or service (Sahlman
1990). The completion of key orgaruzing activities,
such as the forming of a legal entity and applying for
DEMO permits and intellectual property protec-
tion, also provides investors with iriormation DEMO
hypothesize that founders are more likely to seek external
financing when their assessments of the ventures are more positive.
Note that this hypothesis does DEMO require any founders to pursue
ventures that they assess negatively, as DEMO can vary in the
extent that they assess their ventures positively.
223
new venture prospects because organizing activities
indicates that the venture is successfully DEMO
into an actual business entity. Specifically, investors
are more likely to DEMO financing to those ven-
tures that have engaged in marketing activities, DEMO
undertaken more organizing activities, have engaged
in more product development activity, and have gen-
erated more sales. This argument leads to the second
DEMO:
HYPOTHESIS 2. The likelihood that a firm founder will
receive external funds for a venture, conditional on seek-
ing it, increases with DEMO measures of the venture's
performance.
Methodology
Sample and Procedure
Obtaining a representative sample of new ventures
is a difficult process because no effective DEMO
frame exists. Prior research has commonly defined a
business start-up as an entity that has achieved par-
ticular milestones, such as forming a legal organi-
zation or initiating production (Carroll and Hannan
2000). However, DEMO an approach introduces selec-
tion bias in explaining new venture finance, DEMO
ventures may receive capital prior to the formation of
a legal entity (Sahlman 1990), and because organiz-
ing activities undertaken by entrepreneurs prior to the
formation of a legal entity may influence the financ-
ing DEMO (Aldrich 1999).
Because the population of newly founded ventures
is DEMO to identify directly, we began with a
random sample of the DEMO population to
identify people in the process of starting a new busi-
ness. We contacted by telephone during the first nine
months of 1998, 35,971 adults between the ages of
18 and 70 years old, who were living in Sweden. Of
those contacted, 30,427 (84.6%) agreed to participate
in the survey. We did not find any significant DEMO
ence in age, sex, and geographic location of contacts
between those that agreed to participate and those
that declined to participate.
We then DEMO to identify those individuals who
had started a new business during that nine-month
period. To do this we engaged in a four step pro-
DEMO First, we asked the respondents if and when they
had started DEMO new venture, having defined the start
of a new venture as DEMO time when the foimder(s)
irutiated efforts to create the new business (rather
than when they first thought about it). Second, DEMO
asked if the respondents possessed a fractional or full
ownership position in a venture on which they had
started to work, alone or with others, during the first
rune months of 1998. Third, we screened DEMO those
who indicated that the venture was undertaken on
224
behalf of their current employer or an existing firm.
Finally, we asked respondents who indicated that they
met the criteria for more than DEMO business to describe
the venture that they had founded most recently. Of
the individuals contacted, 221 had established a new
venture that met our criteria.'* Thus, our study of ven-
ture finance is based on a random sample of Swedish
new ventures that were initiated between January DEMO
September 1998. We use the founders of these ven-
tures as informants about the ventures and treat the
venture as the entity that we DEMO over time.
We contacted the respondents every six months
after our initial contact for 30 months or until the
venture was abandoned.^ Ventures that DEMO out
of the sample due to abandonment or nonparticipa-
tion were treated as censored from the time of last
contact. Response rates for each DEMO wave
of data collection ranged from 90.5% to 98.5%. We
tested for statistical difference between those ventures
that were dropped as a result of DEMO and
those that continued to respond throughout the entire
30 months. The only statistical difference detected
between the two groups was that founders of DEMO
tures that prematurely ceased to participate expected
less competition than ventures that participated for
the entire period of study.
Ventures in our sample included DEMO farms, home-
based businesses, independent consulting firms, man-
ufacturing firms, restaurants, high-tech firms, and
cleaning companies. Founders pursued a variety of
DEMO Just under half (46.6%) pursued low-
tech service opportunities, 87 (39%) pursued high-
tech service opportunities such as software design.
* We dropped two cases of respondents under the age of 18 from
the DEMO to ensure that the sample for this study represents only
adults. The inclusion or exclusion of respondents under the age of
18 has no DEMO effect on our results.
' Data for each venture is based on the response of one individ-
ual. In the study of large organizations, construct validity is com-
monly achieved by collecting information from several respondents
DEMO to concerns that one individual may not be fully aware of
the characteristics of the organization. Conversely, in small ven-
tures such as those studied in this sample, in most cases such an
approach is impractical and redundant for several reasons. First,
in many ventures no individual DEMO than the respondent was
intimately involved in the start-up activities of the orgaruzation or
possessed irvformation necessary to describe the start-up process.
Second, in most cases respondents are providing information on a
small group of people. DEMO the ventures in the sample, the distribu-
tion of start-up team DEMO is 44% (1 founder), 33% (2 founders), 10%
(DEMO founders), 6% (four founders), and 5% (five founders). (Num-
bers do not sum to 100% due to roimding.) Therefore, in the most
extreme case in our sample, respondents were required to report
on the activities of five business associates. This compares favor-
ably DEMO studies of large orgaruzations where studies of multiple
respondents still require respondents to represent the perceptions
of thousands of individuals. See Gerhart et al. (2000) for a more
detailed discussion of the trade-offs discussed here.

and 32 (14.3%) pursued manufacturing opportuni-
ties. Over one-third (36.7%) of the ventures asked
for funds DEMO 63 (28.5%) ventures ultimately received
funds from an individual, friend DEMO family member,
bank, government agency, or venture capitalist within
30 months of starting to pursue the business oppor-
tunity. Less than 10% DEMO the ventures in the sample
received funding from venture capitalists.
Method and Measures
We analyze the venture financing process as a two-
stage selection DEMO that evolves over time. In the
first stage, we hypothesize that DEMO characteris-
tics of the venture will increase the hazard of seeking
financing from outside sources. In the second stage,
we hypothesize that specific DEMO of ven-
tures which founders sought to finance will increase
the hazard that financiers will fund the ventures. In
our sample, no financier provided capital to a ven-
ture that a founder had not first decided DEMO finance
externally.
Similar to Gompers (1995) and Carroll and Hannan
(DEMO), the hazard rate, or the probability of the event
of DEMO occurring given that the event has not yet
occurred, is specified DEMO
probability that the event occurs between
h{m) - month m and DEMO -|- Am
probability that the event occurs after
month m.
Covariates are h5^othesized to influence the instan-
taneous probability of the event occurring by DEMO
the baseline hazard rate (/ZQ). AS estimates are gener-
ated via maximum likelihood, with robust clustering
on each venture, we report DEMO as the model
fit statistic in our results. We examine the data in
monthly spells. Those ventures for which the event of
interest has DEMO occurred by the end of 30 months are
treated as right censored.
We use the WeibuU hazard model for four reasons.
First, our data is right censored, as some of the 33%
of the ventures that sought financing but failed to
receive financing from external sources by the DEMO
of the 30 month panel could have received financing
after our sampling frame ended. Second, the Akaike
information criterion test indicates that the WeibuU
model provides a better statistical fit to our data
than other hazard DEMO (Akaike 1974, Blossfeld and
Rohwer 1995). Third, unlike the DEMO proportional haz-
ard model, the WeibuU model allows us to control
DEMO for the influence of venture age on the hazard
rates. Finally, DEMO WeibuU model is commonly used
in hazard models in venture finance (DEMO and
Lerner 1999).

We measure whether the founder sought funds
from an outside source (Stage 1) by asking the DEMO
dent, every six months, if the venture has sought
external funds. To measure if the venture received
funds from an external source (Stage 2), we asked
the respondent, every six months, if the DEMO
had received funds from an external source for the
first time. If the respondent indicated yes for either
question, we asked in which month that event first
occurred. We coded these variables 1 for each month
DEMO event occurred; 0 otherwise. Hence, we are able to
identify by month if and when ventures were selected
into each stage.
Predictor Covariates
DEMO Perceptions About the Business Oppor-
tunity. We predict that entrepreneurs are more likely
to seek funding from external sources as their positive
assessment of DEMO prospects of the venture increases.
We measure the founder's self-assessment of the
prospects of the venture with the following questions:
Anticipated Market DEMO We measure the founders'
expectations of industry growth at the time of the
initial survey by asking the respondents to select,
from DEMO four-point scale, whether they perceive mar-
ket growth to be "diminishing" (1), "unchanged" (2),
"expanding" (3), or experiencing "strong expan-
sion" (4). This variable is time invariant.
Anticipated Market Competition. We measure the
founders' perceptions of market competition at the
initial survey by asking the respondents to indicate on
a DEMO scale whether, in the industry where they
plan to launch their DEMO, they: "expect no com-
petition" (0), "expect low competition" (1), "expect
moderate competition" (2), or "DEMO strong compe-
tition" (3). This variable is time variant.
Anticipated Employment Growth. We measure the
founders' perceptions of the expected size of the ven-
tures by asking them, at each wave of the survey, to
indicate the number of employees that they anticipate
will be on the payroll in year Hve. This variable is
time variant.
Anticipated Price DEMO We measure per-
ceptions of price competition by asking the respon-
dents to indicate the importance of offering compet-
itive prices to secure customers DEMO a four-item scale
in which "0" equals "no importance," "1 " equals
"marginal importance," "2" equals "importance," DEMO
"3" equals "critical importance." This measure is time
invariant.
Objective Information About the Venture. We pre-
dict that financiers are more likely DEMO provide funding
to specific ventures as positive objective information
about the venture increases. We measure the objec-
tive information about the venture with the DEMO
covariates.
225
Organizing Activities. We measure organizing activ-
ities by asking five questions that prior research
has indicated are activities that are undertaken by
DEMO when organizing new ventures (Carter et al.
1996, Reynolds and White 1997). Every six months,
we asked respondents the following questions, coded
as "1" if the respondent answered "yes" and "0"
if the respondent answered "no": (1) Has the ven-
ture fUed the necessary forms with the tax authori-
ties? (2) Has the venture registered with government
authorities? (3) Have any raw materials, inventory,
supplies, or components for the start-up been pur-
DEMO? Have any major items like equipment, facil-
ities, or property DEMO purchased, leased, or rented
for the new start-up? ("Major" was defined as an
item with a retail value greater than U.S. DEMO,000.)
(4) Has the venture sought to obtain a patent, copy-
right, or trademark? (5) Has the venture sought to
obtain necessary permits or licenses to operate? Fol-
lowing prior research, DEMO total these dichotomous
measures (Reynolds and White 1997) to yield a single
measure of venture-organizing activities that can be
objectively verified by potential DEMO This vari-
able is time variant.
Initiated Marketing. We measure the initiation of
marketing by asking the respondents every six
months whether they have DEMO marketing. If they
indicate yes, we ask them at which month DEMO initi-
ated marketing. We code this variable "0" for every
month that they have not initiated marketing and "1"
thereafter. This variable is time variant.
Stage of Product Development. We measure the level
of DEMO development completed by asking the
respondents every six months, "at what stage of
development is the product or service this start-up
will be DEMO?" The scale of responses was "1 " equals
"no work has been done to develop a product or ser-
vice;" "2" equals "work to develop the product or
service is still in DEMO idea stage;" "3 " equals "a model
or procedure is being developed;" "4" equals "a pro-
totype or procedure has been tested with customers;"
and "5" equals "the product DEMO service is completed
and ready for sales or delivery." This variable DEMO time
variant.
Venture Sales. We measure the level of venture sales
by asking the respondents every six months to pro-
vide the sales they DEMO earned by month. For every
month they recorded sales, we code DEMO amount of
sales as the natural log of sales. Otherwise, we DEMO
this variable "0." This variable is time variant.
Control Covariates
Prior research has indicated that the human capital
and reputation of founders is DEMO to influence the
likelihood that a venture will receive financing from
external sources. We independently control for two
dimensions of human capital and reputation, the prior
226
startup experience and the industry experience of the
members of the DEMO team.
Start-up Experience. We measure the total number
of prior new ventures at the initial survey by asking,
"How many companies has each member of the ven-
ture team started previously?" This variable is DEMO
invariant.
Industry Experience. We measure the total years of
industry experience of the start-up team at the initial
survey by asking, "How many DEMO of experience in
the industry does each member of the venture team
have?" We sum industry-years across all members of
the team to DEMO the total industry experience for
the team. This variable is time invariant.
Completed Business Plan. We control for whether
or not the venture has DEMO completed business plan
because having a completed business plan is Hkely
to increase the probability of being awarded exter-
nal funding. Every six months, beginning with the
initial interview, we measure whether respondents
have completed a written business plan by asking,
"Has a business plan been written?" If they indicate
yes, we ask them at which month they completed the
business plan. We code this variable "0" for every
DEMO that they have not completed a written busi-
ness plan and "DEMO " thereafter. This variable is time
variant.
Venture Age. We control for the age of the venture,
in months, because the likelihood that a venture will
receive external financing is affected by the age of DEMO
venture. This variable is time variant.
Industry Sales Growth. We control for three dimen-
sions of industry using data from Statistics Sweden,
the DEMO agency that is the primary provider
of economic statistics in Sweden. The variables are
computed from a database that includes all firms
operating in DEMO country. The database is updated
approximately 26 times a year with data provided by
tax authorities in Sweden. We control for the two-
year DEMO growth in sales in the same five-digit
industry in the year using data provided by Statistics
Sweden because new ventures in growing industries
should DEMO more external financing. This variable
is time variant.
Number of Firms in Industry. We control for the size
of the industry by including as DEMO covariate the total
number of active firms in the industry as provided
by Statistics Sweden because new ventures in larger
industries may be more DEMO to be awarded external
financing. This variable is time variant.
Average Firm Age in Industry. We measure aver-
age firm age in the same DEMO industry for the
same year using data provided by Statistics Sweden
because new ventures in younger industries should
receive more external financing. This variable DEMO time
variant.

Selection Correction
DEMO analyze the venture financing process as a
two-stage selection process that evolves over time.
Therefore, we model the systematic selection on the
part of founders of ventures on which to seek fund-
ing in the regression DEMO predict receipt of funding by
including a correction variable. A, in DEMO second-stage
financier decision-to-fund regression to more accu-
rately examine the relationship between hypothesized
covariates and selection for financing by investors in
the second stage (Klepper et al. 1983). Our correction
is based on Lee's (1983) generalization of Heckman's
two-stage selection model (Heckman 1979) calculated
as follows:
where Fjirn) is the cumulative hazard function for
founder selection into the pool of financing can-
didates for venture i at DEMO m, (j) is the stan-
dard normal density function, and O"^ is the inverse
of the standard normal distribution function (Lee
1983). Because the hazard model used to generate the
predicted probabilities DEMO seeking financing used to
compute A must include at least one covariate that
influences the hazard rate of asking for financing but
not the DEMO of seeking funds from external sources
that is included as a covariate the Stage 1 regressions
but not the Stage 2 regressions (Little and Rubin 2002,
Frees 2004), we include as an additional predictor DEMO
first-stage hazard models a dummy variable indicat-
ing if the venture is in a low-tech service industry.
Results
Panel A of Table 1 provides DEMO statistics for
the 221 ventures included in the analysis at birth—
the first month each venture existed—while Panel B
of Table 1 provides the DEMO summary statistics in
venture months for the entire 30-month period. Exam-
ination of Table 1 shows the importance of a dynamic
approach to venture DEMO, as attributes of the ven-
tures that are potentially important to DEMO financing
process change over time. For example, a comparison
between Panels DEMO and B of Table 1 indicate that at the
start of the 30-month period most ventures had not
yet completed a business plan, and most had yet to
be paid for producing a product or service. DEMO, over
time, a considerable number of ventures completed
a formal written business plan (27%) and most (over
58%) of the ventures DEMO sales.
Table 2 provides summary statistics for the first
month of selection into each stage, where Stage 1 is
the group of ventures selected by founders as candi-
dates for external financing, and Stage 2 is the pool
of ventures from Stage 1 that were guarded funding
from DEMO sources. As illustrated in Table 2, a pre-
liminary inspection of DEMO summary statistics indi-
cates that a multistage selection model appears con-

DEMO with the data. First, inspection of the means
for key variables DEMO the ventures selected into each
stage of the finance process suggests that substan-
tial differences exist between the underlying popula-
tions of firms at DEMO stage. For example, the mean
of the sales variable increased drastically DEMO the
initial sample of all 221 firms and the 81 firms that
survived the selection criteria in the first stage of
the venture finance DEMO Second, the first selection
event appears to be particularly important. Of DEMO ini-
tial 221 ventures, only 81 (36%) are selected into DEMO
pool of ventures that are candidates for external cap-
ital, but DEMO (over 77%) of these candidates ultimately
received capital from external sources. Third, Table 2
indicates that the selection criteria may not be the
same at each stage. For example, financiers appear
to be more interested than entrepreneurs in financing
new ventures in smaller industries (the change in the
mean of this variable is positive between birth and
Stage 1, while negative between Stage 1 and Stage 2).
Therefore, it appears that the process which alters the
surviving sample in this study is DEMO random and that
the way the financing process evolves is important to
understanding which firms ultimately receive fimds.
Table 3 provides the correlation matrix DEMO Table 4
shows the results of the primary WeibuU models. We
report exponentiated coefficients in Table 4. Those
coefficients greater than one reflect a DEMO relation-
ship between the coefficient and the propensity of an
event occurring, and values less than one reflect the
opposite.

Sample Correlation Matrix
Seeking External Capital
The model in Column 1 of Table 4 provides substan-
tial support for DEMO 1. In Column 1 we report
the estimated association of model covariates on the
hazard of seeking capital from external sources. We
find that DEMO are approximately 3% more likely
to seek external financing for ventures that they antic-
ipate will be growing in employment (p < 0,01), and
that founders are approximately 20% less likely to
seek external DEMO for ventures in markets that they
perceive are more competitive (p < 0,10). Further, they
are almost 50% more likely to DEMO capital from exter-
nal sources for ventures that they anticipate will serve
more rapidly growing markets (p < 0.10). We did
not find a statistically significant relationship between
anticipated price competitiveness and the probabil-
ity DEMO a founder will seek financing from externai
sources. Overall, we find DEMO founder perceptions
of the venture appear to have significant impact on
the decision to seek external financing. Among the
perceptions, we find that anticipated market growth
appears to have the largest effect in magnitude.
Receiving Capital DEMO that Capital Is Sought
The model in Column 2 of Table 4 provides consid-
erable support for Hypotheses 2. In Column 2, we
report the estimated association of covariates on the
hazard of receiving funds on DEMO sample of only those
81 ventures that were selected by founders as can-
didates for external financing. For each additional
orgaruzing activity completed, we find that ventures
are almost 50% more likely to receive capital from
DEMO sources given that capital has been sought
(p < 0.01). DEMO, ventures that have engaged in
marketing activities are almost twice as DEMO to be
awarded capital from external sources, given that
capital has DEMO sought (p < 0.05), and each unit
increase in the DEMO of sales is associated with an
approximate 17% greater likelihood that the ven-
ture will receive capital from external sources given
that capital has DEMO sought (p < 0.01). However, we
find no statistically significant relationship between
the level of product development and the probabil-
ity that DEMO founder will receive financing from exter-
nal sources conditional on seeking external financing.
Overall, we find that objective dimensions of ven-
ture development appear to have significant impact
on the probability that a venture will receive DEMO
financing conditional on such financing being sought.
Among the perceptions, we DEMO that irutiating mar-
keting activities and undertaking organizing activ-
ities appear to have the largest effect in terms of
magnitude.
Examining the Validity and DEMO of
the Multistage Selection Model
In Colurtm 3, we estimate a DEMO of the Stage 2
model in which we do not include the founder selec-
tion A to show how failure to correct for systematic
DEMO by founders would yield different results.
The difference in the magnitude of the coefficients in
Columns 2 and 3 indicates that the estimates for DEMO
effect of different factors on financiers' funding deci-
sions would be DEMO estimated without first cor-
recting for founder selection of ventures as candidates
for external funding. For example, without correct-
ing for founder selection, DEMO find no evidence that
investors differentially select on the presence of busi-
ness plans. However, when we properly correct for
founder selection, we DEMO a statistically significant
relationship between the presence of a business plan
and investors' financing decisions. This evidence sug-
gests that failure to properly model both stages of the
process may lead researchers to inappropriately fail
to DEMO support for key relationships.
In Column 4 of Table 4, we DEMO empiri-
cally the differences between this multistage model of

venture finance and an alternate single-stage model,DEMO
by re-analyzing our data with a standard, single-stage
event history model DEMO predict the hazard of receiving
funds from an outside source for the entire sample
of 221 ventures. By comparing the results shown in
Columns DEMO and 4 of Table 4, we can also see the value
DEMO the two-stage model for accurately evaluating the
venture finance process.
This effort indicates that key influences in the pro-
cess are lost in the DEMO finance models that col-
lapse both stages of the process into a single event. In
Column 4 of Table 4, we find no relationship between
anticipated market growth and the instantaneous
229
probability that a venture DEMO receive funds from out-
side sources. However, when we appropriately model
DEMO stages of the process, as is done in Columns 1
and DEMO of Table 4, we find that this is a key charac-
DEMO influencing which ventures ultimately receive
funds from outsiders, as founders appear DEMO differ-
entially select ventures through the financing process
based on perceptions of anticipated market growth.
Finally, a researcher might infer from the single-stage
model in Column 4 that financiers differentially select
ventures for external financing based DEMO founder per-
ceptions of anticipated market competition. However,
by appropriately modeling the two stages of the pro-
cess, we find that such an inference is incorrect. This
selection is driven by founder, not investor selection.
Therefore, failure to consider venture finance as a
multistage selection process will lead researchers to
systematically underestimate the importance of key
covariates on the DEMO receipt of external capital
from investors, as well as to give DEMO to the likelihood
that they will misattribute causal order.
Discussion and Implications
We examined why some new ventures and not oth-
ers receive financing DEMO external investors. We ana-
lyzed a uruque data set capturing the life histories
of 221 new ventures initiated in Sweden during the
first nine DEMO of 1998. We modeled venture financ-
ing as an evolutionary selection process in which
foimders select ventures as candidates for external
capital based on DEMO own positive assessments of the
ventures, while investors use objective characteristics
DEMO the ventures to select which ventures to finance
from a pool of ventures that founders have put forth
as candidates for external financing. We DEMO how
failure to examine new venture finance through the
lens of multistage selection would cause researchers
to draw incorrect inferences about the venture finance
DEMO
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. First, the study
examined DEMO firm formation only in Sweden for
30 months spanning 1998 and 1999. As a result, time
or Sweden-specific attributes could limit the gener-
alizability of the results to other periods or loca-
tions. However, we can identify no theoretical reason
why the results of this study should not DEMO
to other periods or locations. Nevertheless, as with
single cotmtry studies DEMO business phenomena in the
United States, future research in other countries DEMO
similar research designs is necessary to demonstrate
the generalizability of the results.
Second, because we use key informants to pro-
vide information about the ventures we study,
individual-level biases in responding to questions
230
might influence the responses we analyze. Unfortu-
nately, the nature of the new firm creation process
makes it difficult to control for this DEMO In the ini-
tial period of the life of the venture, DEMO we study,
individuals often act alone to organize new firms.
Consequently, only the individual respondents pos-
sess the information about such aspects of their busi-
nesses such as orgaruzing activities imdertaken and
the search for DEMO We sought to minimize biases in
interpretation by asking respondents about concrete
actions (e.g., did you write a business plan?). Never-
theless, the potential for individual-level bias in the
responses to our survey remains.
Third, as is the case with all longitudinal survey
research, our DEMO administration may have influ-
enced the behavior of the foimders that we survey
(Schwab 2005). However, the timing and nature of the
DEMO that we ask, as well as our distance from
sources of DEMO, mitigate this concern.
Fourth, the amoimt of funding sought might sig-
nal the attractiveness of the venture and thus affect
the probability of DEMO external financing, condi-
tional on it being sought. Because we do DEMO have the
data, we cannot measure the effects of the amoimt DEMO
funding sought on the probability of obtaining exter-
nal financing. Our results are therefore limited by the
assumption that the amount of financing sought DEMO
not influence the effect that objective characteristics
of the venture have on the probability that the ven-
ture receives external financing, conditional on such
financing being sought.
Implications
Our results make a powerful argument for the DEMO
evance of multistage selection to the study of social
processes in general (Baum and Singh 1994, Baum
and McKelvey 1999). True to DEMO original variation-
selection-retention framework (Campbell 1969), we
find that selection DEMO systematically influence the
observed characteristics of orgaruzations that success-
fully pass through the venture finance process. First,
internal and external selection criteria act DEMO tandem
to shape the characteristics of new firms. In the spe-
cific case of venture finance, our results show that it
is necessary to explicitly address both selection events
to understand the evolution of the population DEMO new
firms.
Second, the accumulation of selection events con-
strain future DEMO We provide empirical evi-
dence suggesting that path dependencies may occur
due to cumulative selection (Langolis and Everett
1994). Populations of ventures and firms that have
survived multiple irreversible stages of selection are
likely to DEMO common characteristics that were nec-
essary to survive the previous selection events. These
common characteristics may influence or constrain

future behavior. In our study, investors do not return
DEMO the initial sample of 221 ventures when seeking
investments, and such DEMO return is not likely to be pos-
sible because, as a DEMO of founders' decisions,
the full set of ventures is unlikely DEMO be made available
to investors. This is important because ventures with
desirable characteristics for selection at later stages
may be systematically underrepresented at the DEMO
stages, due to their lack of selection at earlier stages.
In DEMO specific case of venture finance, our study
shows that the screening DEMO of founders con-
strain the subsequent investment options of investors.
We find that founders base financing decisions on
their perceptions of market competition, price compe-
tition, and employment growth, while investors base
funding decisions on DEMO verifiable indicators
of venture development, such as the level of sales,DEMO
the extent that organizing activities have been com-
pleted, and the DEMO of marketing efforts. Hence,
our study suggests that empirical investigations of
venture finance can be improved by examining it as
a multistage selection DEMO, where the actions of
founders as well as investors are taken DEMO account.
For example, our study suggests that research inves-
tigating factors DEMO drive aspects of founder selec-
tion, such as recent work on DEMO entrepreneurs prefer
investments from some venture capitalists over oth-
ers (Hsu DEMO), is likely to erd:iance our understanding
of why some ventures are more likely to successfully
raise capital from external sources. Similarly, as we
treat the receipt of fimding as a dichotomous variable,
a DEMO direction for further research would be to
examine if the model is robust to explaining the level,
or amount of funding received from DEMO sources.
Third, our findings indicate that events that occur
early in DEMO process of organization development may
be just as important as events that occur later in the
process, and failure to measure the early events can
hinder our understanding of organizational devel-
opment. For example, much more of the selection
of ventures to receive external financing was under-
taken DEMO firm founders than by investors. As shown
in Table 2, only DEMO (37%), or 81 of the initial
221 ventures, were presented to investors as candi-
dates for financing. However, of those presented to
investors for funding, over three fourths (78%) ulti-
mately received financing. If more of the selection on
dimensions other than venture finance occurs DEMO
in the firm creation process, researchers who concen-
trate on later DEMO might fail to fully understand
the process of firm development by systematically
under-measuring the early parts of the process. Simi-
larly, failure to appropriately model specific selection
events early in the process may lead researchers to
DEMO causal order, or fail to find support for
important covariates in DEMO stages.

Finally, the selection process has important impli-
cations for policy makers and founders. Our study
suggests DEMO policies designed to stimulate ven-
ture finance by increasing the capital available to
entrepreneurs may ultimately prove less successful
than expected, as some ventures that exhibit char-
acteristics important to investors are likely to never
become DEMO due to systematic selection on the
part of founders. Similarly, our DEMO indicate that
founders may wish to delay seeking capital from
external sources until objective information on the
prospects of their venture has been generated.
DEMO
The research design owes an intellectual debt to the
Panel Study of Business Start-ups undertaken by the
Entrepreneurial Research Consortium, a temporary vol-
untary association of 30+ U,S, and non-U.S, universities.
The Knut and DEMO Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish
Foundation for Small Business Research, and the Swedish
National Board for Industrial and Technical Development
financed the study. The DEMO thank Riitta Katila, Atul
Nerkar, Ken G, Smith, Rama Velamuri, Andrew King, Anne
Miner, Masako Ueda, and seminar participants at DEMO
University, the University of Pennsylvania, Ohio State Uni-
versity, the DEMO of Wisconsin, and Purdue Univer-
sity for suggestions that improved the DEMO They
also thank Mike Van Roo for providing valuable research
assistance.
