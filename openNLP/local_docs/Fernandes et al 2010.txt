Experimental psychologists have demonstrated that
people systematically deviate from the choice DEMO
tions the classical paradigm implies as individuals are
typically biased.
Behavioural biases can roughly be grouped in two
categories: cognitive and emotional, though DEMO
types yield irrational decisions. Because cognitive
biases (heuristics like anchoring, availability, and
representative biases) stem from faulty reasoning,
better information and DEMO can often correct
them. Conversely, emotional biases, such as regret
and loss-aversion, originate from impulsive feelings
or intuition, rather than conscious reasoning, and
are hardly possible to correct. Lo et al. (2005)
investigated several possible links between psycho-
logical factors and trading performance, finding that
subjects whose emotional reaction to monetary gains
and losses was more intense DEMO both the positive
and negative side exhibited significantly worse
trading performance.
Shefrin (2005) posits that the portfolios selected by
investors whose choices conform DEMO prospect theory
will differ in key aspects from the portfolios selected
by investors whose choices conform to expected
utility theory. The general character of DEMO
portfolios is that they feature a combination of
securities that are very safe with securities that are
very risky, with the overall portfolio failing to be well
diversified. In this sense, an optimal solution to the
asset allocation problem should guide investors to
make decisions that serve their DEMO interest. This
could be the recommendation of an asset allocation
that suits the investor’s natural psychological pre-
ferences (emotional biases), even though it may not
maximize expected return for a given level of risk.
More DEMO, a client’s best practical allocation may
be a slightly under-performing long-term DEMO
programme to which the investor can comfortably
adhere. From a mean-variance optimization perspec-
tive, behavioural investors select portfolios that are
stochastically dominated. This does not mean that the
individual investors are irrational in any sense: it is
not irrational for people to anticipate emotional
reactions and take them DEMO account when making
decisions that try to adjust their choices to their
preferences. However, portfolio managers lack the
guidelines necessary for incorporating these biases
during the process of determining asset allocation.
We address this issue by DEMO whether managers
should moderate the way clients naturally behave to
counteract the effects of behavioural biases so that
they can fit a pre-determined asset DEMO or they
J. L. B. Fernandes et al.
should create an asset allocation that adapt to clients’
biases, so that clients can comfortable adhere to
the fund.
In general terms, prospect theory and its latter
version cumulative prospect theory1 (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, DEMO) posits
four novel concepts in the framework of individuals’
risk preferences. DEMO, investors evaluate assets
according to gains and losses and not according DEMO
final wealth (mental accounting). Second, individuals
are more averse to losses than they are attracted to
gains (loss-aversion). Third, individuals DEMO risk-
seeking in the domain of losses and risk-averse in
the domain of gains (asymmetric risk preference).
Finally, individuals evaluate extreme probabilities DEMO
a way that overestimates low probabilities and
underestimates high probabilities (probability DEMO
ing function). This study, as far as we know, is the
first to consider all those aspects in the framework of
portfolio DEMO
There are conflicting results in the finance litera-
ture on how prior outcomes affect the risk-taking
behaviour of investors in subsequent periods. Loss-
aversion DEMO predict that traders with profitable
mornings would reduce their exposure to afternoon
risk, trying to avoid losses and thus guaranteeing the
previous gains (DEMO and Zuchel, 2005). Odean
(1998) and Weber and Camerer (1998) have shown
that investors are more willing to sell stocks that
trade above the purchase price (winners) than stocks
that trade below DEMO price (losers) – a phenom-
enon termed the disposition effect (DEMO and
Statman, 1985). Both works interpreted this beha-
viour as DEMO of decreased risk-aversion after a
loss, and increased risk-aversion after a DEMO The
standard explanation for the previous behaviour is
based on prospect theory, and particularly on the fact
that individuals are risk-seeking in the domain of
losses and risk-averse in the domain of gains
(asymmetric risk preference).
However, another stream of the literature found
the opposite behaviour. Thaler and Johnson (1990)
name the house-money effect, the behaviour of
DEMO risk appetite after a gain. Barberis et al.
(2001) present a model where investors are less loss-
averse after a gain while they DEMO more loss-
averse after prior losses. Our proposed model
addresses and clarifies the previous contradiction
between house-money and disposition effect.
Despite the vast literature DEMO the behav-
ioural biases associated with prospect theory, the
consideration of DEMO those biases in an asset allocation

framework is DEMO missing. Barberis and Huang (2001)
and Barberis et al. (2001) use loss-aversion and
mental accounting (Thaler, 1999) to explain aspects
DEMO stock price behaviour, but do not employ the full
prospect theory DEMO and do not examine
optimal asset allocation. Benartzi and Thaler (1995)DEMO
consider prospect theory to solve the equity premium
puzzle when investors are loss-averse and evaluate
their portfolios myopically with a horizon of
approximately 1 DEMO They also suggest an optimal
allocation in equities from 30% to 55%. Magi (2005)
uses behavioural preferences to numerically solve a
simple model of international portfolio choice,
providing a possible explanation for the equity
DEMO bias puzzle, the tendency of individual investors
to prefer its home-country DEMO despite the greater
performance of foreign stocks.
Davies and Satchell (2004) provide a solution for
the optimal equity allocation, and explore more
thoroughly the cumulative prospect theory parameter
space that is consistent with observed equity DEMO
tions given a financial market’s returns distributions
over a one-month horizon. Shefrin (2005) considers
heterogeneous investors to see the impact of beha-
vioural DEMO in the framework of asset pricing.
The first main goal of this study is to incorporate
mental accounting, loss-aversion, asymmetric risk-
taking, disposition effect and probability weighting in
portfolio optimization in a multi-period setting for
DEMO investors. We provide a solution for the
asset allocation problem, taking DEMO account all
behavioural biases associated with prospect theory
and using a utility function (suggested in Giorgi et al.,
2004) consistent with both DEMO experimental results of
Tversky and Kahneman, and also with the existence
DEMO equilibrium. We also shed more light on the issue
of how prior outcomes affect subsequent risk-taking
behaviour, investigating the investor’s risk-taking
behaviour following a rise, or a fall, in the price of
the risky asset.
DEMO line with prospect theory, investors derive utility
from fluctuations in the DEMO of their final wealth. In
our framework, there is a financial DEMO on which
two assets are traded. A riskless asset, also called DEMO
bond, and a risky asset, also called a stock (under DEMO
assumption of normally distributed returns for the
risky asset). As we are modelling the decision-making
process of an individual investor, short selling is not
allowed. In each period (we consider two periods), the
investor chooses the weight of his endowment to be
invested in the risky DEMO, in order to maximize his
utility (prospect theory based). We assume that the
investor acts myopically in a sense that he does DEMO
discount long-term welfare when evaluating his
utility, and that the reference DEMO relative to which
he measures his gains and losses for the first period is
his initial endowment. Although all agents solve the
same maximization DEMO in the first period, the
second period decision depends on the DEMO point
relative to which the agent measures the second
period outcomes (DEMO or losses). We consider two
possible reference points: the initial DEMO or the
current wealth, and analyse both cases. St-Amour
(2006) DEMO household portfolios and his results
reveal that references are strongly relevant and state-
dependent.
Another well-known issue in asset allocation
problems, using Markowitz optimization, is that the
output is strongly driven by the risk/return estima-
tion, which usually generates very unstable portfolios.
The most famous problem with this technique is the
substitution problem, where two assets with the same
risk but slightly different expected returns. The
optimizer would give all the DEMO to the asset with
the higher expected return, leading to a DEMO unstable
asset allocation. The second goal of this chapter is to
incorporate estimation risk in the portfolio allocation
behavioural problem.
Recent literature has tried DEMO overcome the
previous problem of leading to unfeasible portfolios.
The main focus of those models is to find out how to
create realistic portfolios DEMO that the values
used for risk and return are not deterministic but
instead just estimates (they are stochastic). It should
be noted that the misspecification of expected returns
is much more critical than that of DEMO (Zimmer
and Niederhauser, 2003).
Jorion (1986) offers a simple empirical Bayes
estimator that should outperform the sample mean
in the context DEMO a portfolio. His main idea is to select
an estimator with average minimizing properties
relative to the loss function (the loss due to estimation
risk). Instead of the sample mean, an estimator
obtained by ‘shrinking’ the means towards a common
value is proposed (the average return for the
minimum variance portfolio), which should lead to
decreased estimation error. DEMO to Jorion, Kempf
et al. (2002) assumes that the prior DEMO is identical
across all risky assets. However, Kempf’s model
considers estimation DEMO as a second source of risk,
determined by the heterogeneity of the market and
given by the SD of the expected returns across DEMO
assets.
Black and Litterman (1992) postulate that the
consideration of the global Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) equilibrium can significantly improve
the DEMO of asset allocation models, as it can
provide a neutral starting DEMO for estimating the set
of expected excess returns required to drive the
portfolio optimization process. Horst et al. (2002)

propose a new adjustment in mean-variance portfolio
weights to incorporate the DEMO risk. The
adjustment amounts to using a pseudo risk-aversion,
rather than the actual risk-aversion, which depends on
the sample size, the number DEMO assets in the portfolio
and the curvature of the mean-variance frontier. The
pseudo risk-aversion is always higher than the actual
one and this difference DEMO with the uncertainty
in the expected return estimations. Maenhout (2004)
DEMO considers an adjustment in the coefficient of risk-
aversion to insure the investor against some endogen-
ous worst case.
Finally, Michaud (1998) suggests portfolio sam-
pling as a way to allow an analyst to visualize DEMO
estimation error in traditional portfolio optimization
methods, and Sherer (2002) DEMO that sampling from
a multivariate normal distribution (a parametric
method termed DEMO Carlo simulation) is a way to
capture the estimation error. Markowitz DEMO Usmen
(2003) compared the traditional approach to resam-
pling and their results support the latter. Fernandes
et al. (2008b) evaluate several asset DEMO models
and suggest that resampling methods typically offer
the best results.
This study presents a novel approach (Behavioral
Resample Adjusted Technique – BRATE) DEMO incor-
porate behavioural biases and estimation risk into
mean-variance portfolio selection. In a paper close to
ours, Vlcek (2006) proposes a model to evaluate
portfolio choice with loss-aversion, asymmetric risk-
taking behaviour and segregation of riskless oppor-
tunities. His findings suggest that the changes in
portfolio weights DEMO depend on the reference
point and the ratio between the reference point and the
current wealth, and thus indirectly on the performance
of the risky asset. Our work differs from his study as
we explicitly consider DEMO novel aspects of prospect
theory: mental accounting, loss-aversion, asymmetric
risk-taking DEMO and probability weighting
function. We also evaluate the inefficiency cost of
the behavioural biases and consider a more general
form for the risky asset DEMO process, including
estimation risk in the analysis.
Considering daily equity data DEMO the period
from 1995 to 2007, we empirically evaluate our
model DEMO comparison to the traditional Markowitz
model. Our results support the use of BRATE as an
alternative for defining optimal asset allocation and
posit that DEMO portfolio optimization model may be
adapted to the individual biases implied in prospect
theory.
The remainder of this article contains the following
sections. Section DEMO discusses the behavioural biases
considered and describes our model proposing the
BRATE. Section II presents the empirical study,
J. L. B. Fernandes et DEMO
describing the data and implementation, and provid-
ing the results. Section DEMO concludes the research by
reviewing the main achievements.
I. The Behavioural Model
We present a two period’s model for portfolio choice
in a stylized DEMO market with only two assets,
where the investor’s preferences are described by
cumulative prospect theory as suggested by
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) DEMO Tversky and
Kahneman (1992). In our framework, there is a
financial market in which two assets are traded: a
riskless asset, DEMO called the bond, and a risky asset,
the stock. Let DEMO consider the return of the stock in
each period given by the following process: R¼
þsn, with n N(0, 1). The riskfree bond yields a
sure return of Rf. We assume that the DEMO value of
the money is positive, i.e. that interest rates are DEMO
negative.
The preferences of the investor are based on
changes in wealth and are described by prospect
theory. We assume that he owns an DEMO endow-
ment, W0 (normalized to 1 monetary unit), and that he
earns no other income. The agent invests a proportion
 of DEMO wealth in the stock and (1  ) in the bond.
DEMO we want to model the individual investor’s
behaviour, we assume that DEMO selling is not allowed
(0   l). We also DEMO that the investor acts
myopically, and the reference point relative to DEMO
he measures his gains and losses in the first period is
his initial wealth. Then, the perceived gain or loss in
the end of the first period is given by

As pointed out in Vlcek (2006) the choice process
under prospect theory starts DEMO the editing phase,
followed by the evaluation of edited prospects and
finally the alternative with the highest value is chosen.
During the editing DEMO, agents discriminate gains
and losses. They also perform additional mental
adjustments DEMO the original probability function
(¼p). Based on experimental evidence, DEMO(x), defining the probability weighting function
adjust the likelihood of outcomes such that small
probabilities are overweighted and large probabilities
are underweighted. We DEMO consider the probability
weighting function, as in Giorgi et al. (2004) given by

reference point and convex below it (asymmetric risk
preference). It DEMO useful to consider the previous form
for the value function because of the existence of a
CAPM equilibrium3 and the ability to reach constant

the investor’s problem in each period.
First period
In the first DEMO, the agent’s problem consists of
defining the allocation of his initial DEMO between
the two assets traded in the financial market. He
maximizes his utility in t ¼ 0 by allocating a fraction,
4
0, of his initial wealth, W0, in the risky asset and
(1 0) in the riskfree asset. We consider that the
investor is a myopic optimizer in the sense that he
takes into account only the DEMO period result. For
multi-period horizons, the choices at earlier dates
impact DEMO reference points at later dates. This feature
allows for complex modelling. However, as pointed
out in Shefrin (2005), prospect theory is a DEMO
about investors who oversimplify, and so, assuming
that individuals are sophisticated enough to perceive
the link between their current choices and future
reference DEMO is something unreasonable. We also
constrain short selling, as it is DEMO for individual
investors’ models. Thus, his problem can be given by

Let us first consider standard values for the model’s
parameters.7 The riskfree rate equals the historical
DEMO return of the US three-month Treasury Bill
(T-Bill; Rf ¼ 2.73%). The equity expected return and
volatility equals the historical average of DEMO Morgan
Stanley Capital International (MSCI) global equity
index and its SD (¼ 7.61% and  ¼ 12.98%). The
adjustment factor in the probability weighting func-
tion equals  ¼ 0.90. The coefficient of risk-aversion
DEMO ¼ 3. Also, as suggested by Kahneman and
Tversky,values (prospect theory and standard) as a function¼ 2.25 and þ¼ 1. The individual’s
of the percentage of his wealth invested in the risky
asset are DEMO in Fig. 3. The individual investor is
expected to choose the allocation in the risky asset
which maximizes his expected value.
As can be DEMO from the graph, using a
standard utility function, the allocation in the risky
asset approaches 100% ( for which the value
function reaches its maximum), while using prospect
theory utility, the investor should allocate 81% of his
wealth in the stock.8 The shapes of the graphs DEMO
different, notably for large allocations in the stock.
The value function DEMO standard utility is equal to
or greater than the one for prospect utility.
The reason for this difference comes from the fact
that in DEMO theory, negative outcomes are
penalized more (as are risky portfolios) DEMO
individuals are loss-averse (4þ). In the loss-
aversion literature evidence DEMO that individuals
are around twice more sensitive to losses than they
are attracted to same size gains. For small allocations
in stocks, the prospect of losses becomes less likely
and the value functions tend to coincide.
DEMO to the effect of probability weighting, if we
set  ¼ DEMO, thus cancelling out its effect, we reach the
value function as shown in Fig. 4.
Note that the amount optimally invested by the
DEMO investor in the risky asset decreases to
48%, and so probability DEMO tends to increase
the risk appetite. Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
DEMO that the overweighting of low probabilities
has an ambiguous effect on risk-taking, as it can
induce risk-aversion in the domain of losses, and DEMO
seeking in the domain of gains. In our case, the
overestimation DEMO the extreme positive outcomes
probabilities, shown in Fig. 3, is inducing investors
to take more risk.
However, despite the effects of loss-aversion and
probability weighting, even if we consider ¼þ¼1
andeters, the value functions DEMO not coincide, as can ¼ 1, keeping constant the remaining param-
be seen in Fig. 5.
Both models would predict that the investor DEMO
allocate 100% of his endowments in the stock.
However, the value DEMO are different because,
in prospect theory, individuals are risk-seeking in DEMO

would be more comfortable in allocating a greater
part of DEMO wealth in the risky asset. The prospect
value function is greater than the standard utility
function.
Observe that the effect of the asymmetric risk
DEMO goes in the opposite direction of loss-
aversion and probability weighting. When we dimin-
ish the coefficient of risk preference ( ¼ 0.25) in both
utility functions, we reduce the effect of asymmetry,
and so the value functions are much closer, as can be
seen in the Fig. 6.
The effects of the behavioural biases can thus be
summarized DEMO follows: loss-aversion reduces risk-
taking, and asymmetric risk-taking behaviour induces
risky attitudes. Probability weighting has an ambig-
uous effect on risk. Our intuition DEMO that, in the long

run, as the value function parameters are changing,DEMO
these biases tend to cancel out, eliminating the
efficiency loss originated DEMO each bias. That is why
we argue that human biases do not need to be
moderated to reach an efficient investment strategy.
The experimental DEMO of Blavatskyy and Pogrebna
(2006) reveal that the effect of loss-aversion is largely
neutralized by the overweighting of small probabil-
ities and underweighting DEMO moderate and high
probabilities.
In order to verify property (i), DEMO us evaluate V
while changing  and keeping constant the other
parameters (considering  ¼ 50%). Figure 7 presents
the graph which indicates that over all positive values
of , the slope of V is positive. The value function is
increasing in . Thus, when the risky asset has a
higher expected return, ceteris paribus implies a
higher value for the investor.
Considering properties (ii) and (iii), let us evaluate
V while changing  and keeping constant the other
parameters (considering  ¼ 50%). Figure 8 presents
the graph indicating that over DEMO positive values of ,
the slope of V is negative, DEMO for  ¼ 0, the slope is
null. When  tends DEMO infinity, the slope tends to null.
The value function is decreasing DEMO s.
The intuition is that, if the volatility of the risky
DEMO is higher, for the same allocation, this implies a
higher probability of losses reducing the value of the
prospect. In line with traditional DEMO investor,
behavioural individuals also prefer higher return and
lower risk; DEMO because they are risk-averse in the
gain domain and also loss-averse.
Now let us evaluate the values of 0 when we
change the riskfree DEMO and the expected return of the
risky asset. Since many parameters are involved, it is
not possible to find closed form solutions for 0.
Therefore, we present numerical results for the

As expected, when the risky asset offers more

because in these cases losses are less likely and we
approach the standard utility solution. When Rf is

DEMO abrupt, giving rise to extreme portfolio alloca-
tions. If we consider DEMO  is not known with

Fig. 10. Expected cost in the first period as function of l
and Rf
We DEMO evaluate the expected cost of inefficiency
related to the behavioural biases associated with the
prospect theory function, for the same parameters
considered in the previous analysis, using
Equation 10. The result is presented in Fig. 10, and
its form is due to the fact that, in standard DEMO
function, the investor is willing to take more risk than
with DEMO loss-averse prospect utility. The cost is due to
the fact that the expected return of the stock is greater
than the bond, and the standard utility investor is
allocating a greater part of his wealth in DEMO risky
asset than the prospect utility individual. Thus, the
cost is DEMO in . However, it is worth noting
that the previous cost DEMO based on expected returns,
which are stochastic in practice. The real cost can just
be observed at the end of the first period DEMO the
realization of the stock’s return.
An important insight can be made from Fig. 10 in
terms of the best practice for asset allocation. DEMO long
as the riskfree rate is lower and the expected return of
the stock is higher, the optimal allocation should
moderate the investor’s biases in order to reach a
better performance. On the other hand, if the risk
premium is lower, the moderation is less relevant, and
DEMO optimal allocation may adapt to the individual’s
biases.
We can also analyse the change in the allocation of
the stock when we vary the DEMO in the risk-
taking behaviour. The result is shown in Fig. 11, for
2554. Observe that, as long as the investor is
much DEMO averse to losses than he is attracted to
gains, the allocation DEMO the risky asset is lower. When
¼ 2.25, the allocation in DEMO risky asset corre-
sponds to 81%, as mentioned previously.
Dimmock (2005) has already shown that a higher
level of loss-aversion leads to lower equity exposure,
and heterogeneity in the coefficient of loss-aversion
has the DEMO to explain puzzling features of house-
hold financial behaviour.

Second period
DEMO order to evaluate the second period allocation
choice of the investor, DEMO us keep some parameters
fixed: ( ¼ 12.98, ¼ 3, ¼ 2.25 and þ¼ 1). After
the investor has made his DEMO period decision in t ¼ 0,
the state of nature realizes inwith his second period problem. Again, he mustt ¼ 1, when DEMO is faced
allocate his wealth in the two possible assets in the
financial market, bond and stock, to maximize his
utility. Let us DEMO the same normal distribution
for the return of the risky asset. The investor’s wealth
position at t ¼ 2 equals his position in t DEMO 1 plus the
return of his portfolio in the second period.
While all agents solve the same maximization
problem in the first period, in the second period, it
will depend on the reference point to which he
measures his gains and losses (in the framework of
prospect theory). In our model, there are two
candidates for the investor’s reference point at t ¼ 1:
his initial wealth at t ¼ DEMO(W0 ¼ 1) or his wealth at the
end of the DEMO period, t ¼ 1(W1). If he measures his
gains DEMO losses relative to his wealth atcurrent wealth), he treats each gain and losst ¼ 1 (his
separately. On the other hand, if DEMO considers his
initial wealth as the reference point, he adds up DEMO
outcomes (gains and losses), that is, he nets his
positions. The previous distinction is relevant in
prospect theory. The value function is DEMO in the
domain of gains and convex in the loss domain
(DEMO risk behaviour).
First, let us consider as the investor’s reference
DEMO his current wealth at t ¼ 1. In this case, the
DEMO problem he will solve in the second
period is the same as the one for the first period.
Thus, we can state the following proposition.
J. L. B. Fernandes et al.
Proposition 2: The optimal asset allocation in t ¼1
for the risky asset 1, if the agent measures his gains
and losses relative to his current wealth, is such that it
maximizes the same value function of the first period
1 DEMO 0.
We can observe that an individual who measures
his gains and losses relative to his current wealth is
actually solving the same maximization DEMO in
each period. That is why the allocation in the risky
asset might be the same. This is not surprising; as he
is not using past information to update his beliefs
about the assets, his preferences are similarly
unaffected.
Next, let us analyse the investor’s maximization
problem if he evaluates his gains and losses relative to
his initial wealth. If DEMO has an initial wealth position
of W0 ¼ 100 and his wealth rises in the first period to
W1 ¼ 110 and falls in DEMO next period to W2 ¼ 105, he
values his position atgain DEMO 10 followed by a loss of 5.t ¼ 2 as a gain of 5, and not as a
In the second period, the DEMO problem consists
of defining the allocation of his wealth (W1) between
the two assets traded in the financial market. He
maximizes his utility DEMO t ¼ 1 by allocating a fraction,
riskless asset. As we did in the first period analysis,1, of his wealth W1 in the risky asset and 1 1 in the

0 is the amount allocated in the risky asset DEMO the first

Observe that the value function to be maximized is
close to one of the first period, but with changes in
the parameters B and C, which account for the
previous period outcome (gain or loss). As we are
interested in the investor’s risk-taking behaviour after
realizing a gain or a loss, let us evaluate the values of
1 when we change the total return obtained in DEMO
first period. Recall that the total return from t ¼ 0to
t ¼ 1(Rtot1), depends both on his allocation choice in
t DEMO 0 and on the realized return of the risky asset R1.
Rtot1 ¼ð1 0ÞRf þ0R1

numerical results for the optimal allocation of wealth,DEMO

(¼ 7.61%,  ¼ 12.98, ¼ 3, W0 ¼ 1, ¼ DEMO and
optimal allocation in the risky asset for the firstþ¼ 1). Figure 12 shows the results. Recall that the
period, considering the previous parameters, is 81%.
Thus, we need to verify whether the allocation

Fig. 12. Optimal equity allocation in the second period as
function of the total return obtained in the first period
appetite, respectively. First, observe that, for a total
return in the first DEMO equal to zero (no gains/
losses), the situation replicates DEMO same framework
the investor faced in the first period. Then we reach
the same optimal allocation in the risky asset (for
Rtot1 ¼ 0 implies 1 ¼ 81%).
Consider the surroundings of the net value
(Rtot1 ¼ 0). If the investor experiences a gain in the
DEMO period, the model predicts that he should
optimally invest less in DEMO risky asset in the second
period. This behaviour prevails up to the point where
the loss-aversion effect is less pronounced. On the
other hand, if a loss is observed in the first period, he
should take more risk in the following period,
allocating a greater part of DEMO wealth in the stock.
This prediction is in line with several experiments,
which have shown that disposition effect dominates
house-money in dynamic settings (Weber and Zuchel,
2005). When the investor experiences a gain DEMO the
first period, he tends to reduce his risk appetite in
DEMO to guarantee the previous outcome. On the
other hand, if he DEMO a loss in the first period,
he will increase his bets on stocks, trying to avoid the
previous loss. In the model, DEMO pattern holds for the
whole gain domain; however, in the loss domain, high
losses in the first period induce less risk appetite in the
second period. The intuition is that if the investor is
facing DEMO huge loss, the loss-aversion effect will
dominate the risk-seeking behaviour, inducing a
reduction in the optimal allocation in the stocks.
When we evaluate DEMO expected cost (Equation 10)
of the behavioural inefficiency in the DEMO period as
a function of the return of the risky asset in the first
period (Fig. 13), it is possible to observe that,
depending on the previous outcome, the cost can be

increasing or decreasing. If the DEMO for R1 is such
that it implies a small loss in the first period, the cost
is even negative, which means that the DEMO
return in the second period under prospect theory is
greater than the one associated with standard utility.
This is related to a greater risk DEMO of the
prospect theory individual after a loss, implying a
greater DEMO in the stock, which has a greater
expected return. If R1 DEMO a gain in the first
period, then the cost is positive DEMO the allocation in
the stock for the standard utility investor is greater
than for the prospect utility individual.
We can conclude that for losses DEMO the first period,
the optimal allocation should adapt to the indivi-
dual’s biases to reach better performance as the cost
comes out to DEMO negative in this domain. For gains in
the previous outcome, the DEMO should moderate
the biases (observe a positive value for the expected
DEMO). For extreme losses in the first period, the
allocation should DEMO moderate the investor’s biases.
If we accumulate the cost results in periods 1 and 2,
we get the graph represented in Fig. 14. DEMO indicates
that, for a negative stock result in the first period, or
even a slightly positive one, the prospect theory
individual outperforms the standard utility investor.
So the allocation strategy should be adapted to the
DEMO biases. The previous results should be taken
with care as they refer to expected values. In section
‘Multi-period analysis’, we provide a more robust
comparison, taking into account the performance of

a smaller stock allocation if compared DEMO a standard

to the DEMO theory biases.
On the other hand, if the individual’s reference

Proposition 3, but DEMO considering the previous
outcome as the total return obtained by him from

in the two-period model, the allocation in the risky

can be greater or DEMO than the one chosen by the
standard utility investor. Observe that the standard
utility investor always chooses the same allocation in
the risky asset, no matter what the reference point, as
neither his decisions nor his beliefs are affected by
previous outcomes.

In sections ‘First DEMO, ‘Second period’ and ‘Multi-
period analysis’ we already evaluated the optimal
DEMO allocation under prospect theory preferences
and considering mental accounting, loss-aversion,
DEMO risk-taking behaviour and probability
weighting. However, there is still an important DEMO
in portfolio optimization missing: estimation error.
Up to now, when solving the investor’s problem, we
considered the expected return known with certainty,

Behaviour finance and estimation risk in stochastic portfolio optimization
which is not DEMO case in reality (especially in emerging
markets where the uncertainty is DEMO). The
assumed return for the risky asset is just an estimate,
and so the real value can be different. This problem is
DEMO in any model of portfolio optimization and is
crucial under prospect theory, where for lower values
of the riskfree rate, a slightly increase DEMO the risk
premium of stocks can lead to extreme allocations. If
the real return of the risky asset is lower, the
likelihood of facing a loss is greater and should
significantly reduce the value of that DEMO
In an attempt to overcome this estimation problem,
Michaud (1998) proposed the resampling technique.
Portfolio sampling allows an analyst to visualize the
DEMO error in traditional portfolio optimization
methods. Suppose that we estimated both the
variance and the excess return by using N observa-
tions. It is DEMO to note that the point estimates
are random variables and so another sample of the
same size from the same distribution would result in
DEMO estimates.
Sherer (2002) suggests that sampling from a multi-
variate normal distribution (a parametric method
termed Monte Carlo simulation) is a way DEMO capture
the estimation error. In this sense, return and
variance would DEMO be the expected values for a
multivariate normal distribution. If we just consider
two assets, the probability density function for a
multivariate normal distribution would be given by

The resampled portfolios should reflect a greater
diversification (DEMO assets enter in the solution) than
the classical mean–variance efficient portfolio, and
should also exhibit less sudden shifts (smooth
transitions) in allocations DEMO return requirements
change. Both characteristics are desirable for
investors.
Recent literature has shown unambiguous results
in favour of resampled portfolios in out-of-sample
analysis (Jiao, 2003; Markowitz and Usmen, 2003;
731
Pawley, 2005; Wolf, 2006). However, Harvey et al.
(2006), evaluating Bayes versus resampling methods,
posit that the choice of risk-aversion drives the
results. DEMO (2005) concludes that, despite the fact
that there are no DEMO advantages or disadvan-
tages of using resampling as a technique to obtain
better returns, resampled portfolios do seem to offer
higher stability and lower transaction costs, two
crucial features for long-term investors’ choices.
We then propose the BRATE as a novel methodo-
logy to define asset allocation, which incorporates
behavioural ideas and resampling techniques into
portfolio optimization, thus adapting to the indivi-
dual’s preferences. In this case, the optimal asset
allocation should be given by the previous proposi-
tions (1 and 2 or 3, depending on the reference point),
but the procedure should be DEMO several times
for different expected stock returns (given by a
multivariate DEMO distribution). The final alloca-
tion is then given by the expected risky asset
allocation. The procedure can be summarized as
follows.9
Step 1: Estimate variance–covariance and return
from the historical inputs.
Step 2: Resample from inputs (created in Step 1) by
taking n draws from the DEMO distribution. The
number of draws reflects the degree of uncertainty in
the inputs. Calculate new variance–covariance and
return from sampled series. Estimation error will

obtained in Step 1.
Step 3: Calculate the optimal allocation for inputs
defined in Step 2, DEMO the appropriate propositions
(1 and 2 or 3, depending on the reference point
considered).
Step 4: After repeating Steps 2 and 3 many times,
calculate average portfolio weights. This is the

analysis comparing the DEMO allocation perfor-
mance to a standard utility allocation.

developed markets (for instance it is DEMO for Brazil
and 0.422 for the USA). Thus it seems that emerging
stock markets are less interesting for domestic
investors than for foreign DEMO investors.
Next we analyse the performance of the following
optimization strategies: DEMO investor with a standard
utility preference (STU); an investor with DEMO
utility preference (PTU), with reference point given
by his current DEMO; an investor with PTU, with
reference point given by his wealth in the previous
period (CPT); an investor with a standard utility
preference (resampled) (RSTU); an investor with
prospect utility preference, DEMO reference point given
by his current wealth (resampled) (BRATEa); DEMO an
investor with PTU, with reference point given by his
wealth DEMO the previous period (resampled) (BRATEb).
The utility function parameters DEMO fixed ( ¼ 3,

period (p) in an out-of-sample analysis. The para-
DEMO are estimated using daily return observations
of the past p days. We define the efficient portfolio
and hold it for the next (e) DEMO, then re-estimate
the parameters and adjust the portfolio weights. To
judge DEMO financial performance of the strategies,

we compute their average return and empirical
Sharpe ratios.
Results
The Sharpe ratios DEMO the different strategies are
presented in Table 2 for the World Index and for the
total period from 1995 to 2007, considering p ¼6
months, 1, 2 and 4 years, and e varying from 2
months to 1 year. We are evaluating the different
strategies for a DEMO based international stock investor.
The riskfree rate considered was the 3 month T-Bill.
In general, we can state that the resampled models
offered better results for a short selling constrained
investor. It is an expected result DEMO resampled models
take into account the estimation risk, generating a
more DEMO portfolio which tends to outperform
in out-of-sample studies. The highest Sharpe ratio
was reached by the BRATEb model for an estimation
period of 2 DEMO and evaluation period of 1 year
(0.465). On average resampled DEMO increase the
Sharpe ratio in around 0.10, when compared to the
DEMO ones. Also, while the (R)STU investor
seems to outperform (DEMO)PTU, it does not happen
with (R)CPT.
If we consider just the total return obtained by each
strategy, we find the results presented in Table 3. In
this case, it is possible to infer an inefficiency cost
related to the behavioural investors, who tend to
underperform the results of the standard utility
investor in around 10 bps.11 However DEMO take into
account the increment in risk (a risk adjusted measure
DEMO Shape ratio), the inefficiency disappears.
Based on the previous results, DEMO can state that
resampled models tend to outperform traditional
models. Also, DEMO is no clear advantage of
standard utility investors over behavioural prospect
theory investors at least to the CPT investor.

Notes: This table presents the Sharpe ratio of the DEMO portfolio generated considering an estimation period of
1 year and evaluation period of 6 months (values in USD). The Sharpe ratio is calculated by dividing the excess
return observed by the SD.
In terms of DEMO comparison between the standard
and the prospect utility investor, generally the DEMO
does not outperform the latter, indicating no clear
dominance of the DEMO rational model. In this
sense, there is no need for moderating DEMO behavioural
biases as described by prospect theory, as no extra
financial DEMO is gained.
Generally speaking, an interesting finding is the
fact that DEMO previous allocation models outperform
the 100% risky strategy. The Sharpe ratio of the
100% stock strategy was 0.383 while all resampled
models reached, on average, a result above 0.509.12
Finally, if we take into account DEMO values in USD
and so considering that the investor is facing
foreign exchange risk, we reach the results presented
in Table 5.
Again, DEMO results indicate a dominance of
resampled models in emerging markets, while DEMO
developed countries, no clear dominance can be seen.
The traditional rational DEMO does not outperform
the behavioural ones. Finally, all six dynamic models

stock invested individual. Observe that the Sharpe
ratio found for the different markets (both in the
country’s currency and in USD) DEMO notably higher
than the ones presented in Table 1.
Summing up, DEMO models, which take into
account estimation risk, tend to outperform determi-
nistic models, notably for emerging markets where
the uncertainty of the expected return estimation is
higher. Moreover, prospect theory utility investors do
not reach worse returns if compared to the traditional
rational ones, which indicates no need for addressing
bias moderation in the portfolio allocation.
III. Conclusions
This DEMO had two objectives: first to incorporate
mental accounting, loss-aversion, asymmetric DEMO
taking behaviour and probability weighting in port-
folio optimization for individual investors; and second
to take into account the estimation risk in the analysis.

Considering daily index stock data from 26
countries over the period DEMO 1995 to 2007, we
empirically evaluated our model (BRATE) against
DEMO traditional Markowitz. Several estimation and
evaluation periods were used and we also considered
a foreign exchange hedged and an unhedged strategy.
Our results support DEMO use of BRATE as an
alternative for defining optimal asset allocation and
posit that a portfolio optimization model may be
adapted to the individual DEMO implied in prospect
theory. Behavioural biases do not seem to reduce
efficiency when we consider a dynamic setting. This
result is robust for different DEMO and emerging
markets. Also, the previous optimization models add
value for DEMO individual investor when compared to a
naive 100% risky strategy.
As further extensions of the present research, we
suggest the inclusion of several risky assets in the
analysis. In this case, the issue of multiple mental
accounting is a crucial issue to address the problem.
An investor who DEMO every security in their own
mental account will not necessarily view additional
securities as redundant, which dramatically increases
the complexity of the problem.
We also leave unanswered the question of how
individuals arrive at the underlying DEMO distribu-
tion. That is the model above is a proposed
mechanism for how individuals might transform a
given probability distribution (assumed to be an
accurate representation of the underlying distribu-
tion) into decision weights. Once we introduce
uncertainty, it can induce individual biases, subjec-
tivity and error. DEMO is evidence that people display
considerable overconfidence when asked to provide
a subjective assessment of a probability distribu-
tion.13 Moreover, it is questionable whether the
weightings provided by CPT truly reflect the process
by which individuals DEMO continuous probability
distributions.
Another suggestion is an analysis if the Sharpe
ratio is an appropriate performance measure when
considering behavioural investors. Is the volatility
DEMO all the relevant risk for the individual
behavioural investor? The consideration DEMO estima-
tion error in the Sharpe ratio estimation is also left
for a further research.
The agent who measures his gains and losses
always DEMO to his actual wealth solves the same
maximization problem each period, DEMO select-
ing a fix-mix strategy. An open question remains, if a
DEMO strategy, where the investor set a fixed
proportion of stocks and DEMO for his portfolio,
can be the cause of the disposition effect.
