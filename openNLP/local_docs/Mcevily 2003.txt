Introduction
In the introduction to this special issue we observed that
empirical research DEMO trust was not keeping pace with
theoretical developments in the field. We viewed this as
a significant limitation and surmised that a special issue
DEMO to empirical research on trust would serve as a
valuable vehicle for advancing the literature. In addition
to the lack of empirical research, we would also make the
observation that theories and evidence accumulating on
trust DEMO organizations is not well integrated and that the
literature as a whole lacks coherence. At a general level,
extant research provides "accumulating evidence that
trust has a number of important benefits for organizations

ically, Dirks and Ferrin's (2001) review DEMO the literature
points to two distinct means through which trust gener-
ates these benefits. The dominant approach emphasizes
the direct effects that trust has DEMO important organiza-
tional phenomena such as: communication, conflict man-
agement, DEMO processes, satisfaction, and perfor-
mance (both individual and unit). DEMO second, less well
studied, perspective points to the enabling effects of trust,
whereby trust creates or enhances the conditions, such as
positive interpretations of another's behavior, that are
conducive to obtaining organizational outcomes like co-
operation and higher performance.
The identification of these two perspectives DEMO a
useful way of organizing the literature and generating in-
sight into the mechanisms through which trust influences
organizational outcomes. However, we are still left with
a set of findings that have yet to be integrated DEMO a theo-
retical level in a way that yields a set of generalizable
propositions about the effects of trust on organizing. We
believe this DEMO due to the fact that research has, for the
most part, embedded trust into existing theories. As a re-
sult, trust has been studied in a variety of different ways
to address a wide range DEMO organizational questions. This
has yielded a diverse and eclectic body of knowledge
about the relationship between trust and various organi-
zational outcomes. At the DEMO time, this approach has
resulted in a somewhat fragmented view of DEMO role of
trust in an organizational context as a whole.
In the remainder of this paper we begin to address the
challenge of integrating DEMO fragmented trust literature.
While it is not feasible to develop a comprehensive
framework that synthesizes the vast and diverse trust lit-
erature in a DEMO paper, we draw together several key
strands that relate to the DEMO context. In partic-
ular, our paper aims to advance the literature DEMO con-
necting the psychological and sociological micro-
foundations of trust with the macro-bases of organizing.

Specifically, we propose that reconceptualizing trust as
an organizing principle is a fruitful way of DEMO the
role of trust and comprehending how research on trust
advances our understanding of the organization and co-
ordination of economic activity. While it DEMO our goal to
generate a framework that coalesces our thinking about
the processes through which trust, as an organizing prin-
ciple, affects organizational DEMO, we are not Pollyannish:
trust indubitably has a down side, which has been little
researched.
We begin by elaborating on the notion DEMO an organizing
principle and then move on to conceptualize trust from
this perspective. Next, we describe a set of generalizable
causal pathways through which trust affects organizing.
We then use that framework to identify some exemplars
DEMO possible research questions and to point to possible
downsides of trust.
Organizing Principles
As Ouchi (1980) discusses, a fundamental purpose of or-
ganizations is to attain goals that require coordinated ef-
forts. Interdependence and uncertainty DEMO goal attain-
ment more difficult and create the need for organizational
solutions. The subdivision of work implies that actors
must exchange information and rely DEMO others to accom-
plish organizational goals without having complete con-
trol over, or being able to fully monitor, others' behaviors.
Coordinating actions is further complicated by the fact
that actors cannot assume that their interests DEMO goals are
perfectly aligned. Consequently, relying on others is dif-
ficult DEMO there is uncertainty about their intentions, mo-
tives, and competencies. Managing interdependence
among individuals, units, and activities in the face of be-
DEMO uncertainty constitutes a key organizational chal-
lenge.
Organizing principles represent a way of solving the
problem of interdependence and uncertainty. An organiz-
ing principle DEMO the logic by which work is coordinated
and information is gathered, DEMO, and processed
within and between organizations (Zander and Kogut
1995).1 An organizing principle represents a heuristic for
how actors interpret and represent DEMO and how
they select appropriate behaviors and routines for coor-
dinating actions.
Examples of organizing principles include: market, hi-
erarchy, and clan (DEMO 1980). Other have referred to
these organizing principles as authority, DEMO, and norms
(Adler 2001, Bradach and Eccles 1989, Powell 1990).2
Each of these principles operates on the basis of distinct
mechanisms DEMO orient, enable, and constrain economic
behavior. For instance, authority as DEMO organizing prin-
ciple solves the problem of coordinating action in the face
92

Trust as an Organizing Principle
of interdependence and uncertainty by DEMO
decision-making rights (Simon 1957, Coleman 1990).
Price-based organizing principles revolve around the idea
of making coordination advantageous for each party in-
volved DEMO aligning incentives (Hayek 1948, Alchian and
Demsetz 1972). Compliance to internalized norms and
the resulting self-control of the clan form is another DEMO
ganizing principle that has been identified as a means of
achieving coordinated action (Ouchi 1980). We propose
that trust is also an organizing principle and that concep-
tualizing trust in this way provides a powerful DEMO of
integrating the disparate research on trust and distilling
generalizable implications for how trust affects organiz-
ing.
We view trust as most closely related DEMO the clan or-
ganizing principle. By definition clans rely on trust
(DEMO 1980). However, trust can and does occur in or-
ganizational DEMO outside of clans. For instance, there
are a variety of organizational DEMO where co-
operation in mixed-motive situations depends on trust,
such as in repeated strategic alliances (Gulati 1995),
buyer-supplier relationships (Dyer and Chu this issue),
and temporary groups in organizations (Meyerson et DEMO
1996).
More generally, we believe that trust frequently oper-
ates DEMO conjunction with other organizing principles. For
instance, Dirks (2000) found DEMO while authority is im-
portant for behaviors that can be observed or controlled,
trust is important when there exists performance ambi-
guity or DEMO that cannot be observed or controlled.
Because most organizations have a combination of be-
haviors that can and cannot be observed or controlled,
DEMO and trust co-occur. More generally, we believe
that mixed or plural DEMO are the norm, consistent with
Bradach and Eccles (1989). In some situations, however,
trust may be the primary organizing principle, DEMO as
when monitoring and formal controls are difficult and
costly to use. In these cases, trust represents an efficient
choice. In other situations, DEMO may be relied upon due
to social, rather than efficiency, considerations. For in-
stance, achieving a sense of personal belonging within a
collectivity (Podolny and Barron 1997) and the desire to
develop and maintain DEMO social attachments
(Granovetter 1985) may serve as the impetus for relying
on trust as an organizing principle.
Trust as an Organizing Principle
At DEMO general level trust is the willingness to accept vul-
nerability based on positive expectations about another's
intentions or behaviors (Mayer et al. 1995, Rousseau et
al. 1998). Because trust represents a positive assumption

DEMO people to economize on information processing and
safeguarding behaviors. By representing an expectation
that others will act in a way that serves, or at least is not
inimical to, one's interests (Gambetta 1988), DEMO as a
heuristic is a frame of reference that allows actors to con-
serve cognitive resources (Uzzi 1997). Trust makes de-
cision making more efficient by simplifying the acquisi-
tion and interpretation of information. Trust DEMO guides
action by suggesting behaviors and routines that are most
viable and beneficial under the assumption that the trusted
counterpart will not exploit one'DEMO vulnerability.
As this discussion demonstrates, trust has been con-
ceptualized as DEMO expectation, which is perceptual or at-
titudinal, as a willingness to be vulnerable, which reflects
volition or intentionality, and as a risk-taking DEMO, which
is a behavioral manifestation. Although these facets of
trust are DEMO related, it is important to be clear about
which specific facet DEMO the focus. In this paper, we con-
centrate on trust as DEMO expectation or an intention because
we are most interested in explaining the behavioral man-
ifestations of trust that shape and influence organizing.
Further, while our definition of trust is inherently rela-
tional (i.e., it requires DEMO trustor and a trustee), we also
recognize that there is a dispositional element to trust
(Rotter 1967).
In an organizational context "DEMO about an-
other's intentions or behaviors"' include "technically
competent DEMO performance from those involved with us
in social relationships and systems" (Barber 1983, p. 9).
In addition to competence, trust is DEMO based on the an-
ticipated behavioral integrity, and the benevolence of DEMO
ers (Mayer et al. 1995). And, trust is based, DEMO part, on a
"leap of faith" (Lewis and Weigert 1985). Consequently,
while our view of trust includes an element of DEMO
expectation, it also encompasses a noncalculative com-
ponent, recognizing the bounded rationality and uncer-
tainty of organizational life.
In addition to trust, trustworthiness influences the per-
vasiveness and efficacy of trust as an organizing principle
(although trustworthiness has received far less research
attention than trust). Trustworthiness DEMO being wor-
thy of having trust placed in one (Barney and DEMO
1994). Because we define trust as an expectation, the dis-
DEMO between trustworthiness and trust is based on the
actual versus perceived intentions, motives, and compe-
tencies of a trustee-the former being trustworthiness and
DEMO latter being trust. Without trustworthiness, trust is not
sustainable. Like trust, we view trustworthiness in an or-
ganizational context as a social phenomenon DEMO; mean-
ing that it is not only an inherent quality of DEMO individual,
group, subunit, or organization. An actor may choose to
limit or enhance his/her trustworthiness
toward another.
For example, one may refuse to allow oneself to become
a repository of another's trust (Coleman 1988). Thus,
trust
and trustworthiness
coevolve.
The speed and DEMO of alignment between trust and
trustworthiness are among the factors that determine the
effectiveness of trust as an organizing principle. In the
case where DEMO actors are perceived as such, equi-
librium is achieved and trust DEMO an effective organizing
principle. In contrast, where opportunistic actors are not
DEMO, trust itself is irrelevant and some other organizing
principle is necessary. DEMO when there is a mismatch
between trust and trustworthiness one of several out-
comes will occur. In the case where opportunistic actors
are trusted, there are going to be negative consequences
and trust will eventually decline. DEMO a result of the mis-
match between trust and trustworthiness, over DEMO equi-
librium will be reached where opportunistic actors are
distrusted. Another route to equilibrium exists in cases
where trust and trustworthiness are mismatched: By plac-
ing trust, one signals that another is expected to behave
in a trustworthy manner, which can become a self-
fulfilling prophecy. On the other hand, when trustworthy
actors are not trusted, there is an DEMO cost of un-
utilized latent trustworthiness. Ghoshal and Moran (1996)
DEMO that this distrust can also become a self-fulfilling
prophecy, and the DEMO of organizational mem-
bers will decline. Alternatively, this disequilibrium could
remain DEMO trust is eventually ventured. Learning to dis-
criminate between those that are trustworthy and oppor-
tunistic requires cumulated and diverse relational expe-
riences. In DEMO organizational context, the nature and
diversity of relational experiences are shaped DEMO part by
the organizational arrangements (e.g., structure, culture,
incentives) that influence and constrain individuals' be-
haviors (Ferrin and Dirks this DEMO, Perrone et al. 2003).
In our view, trust influences organizing through two
main causal pathways: structuring and mobilizing. Be-
cause the level of trust varies, the way that activities are
organized and coordinated will differ. From a structuring
perspective, trust shapes the relatively stable and endur-
ing interaction patterns in and between organizations. For
example, by influencing the status and reputation of cer-
tain actors, trust affects their positions within a social net-
work and changes the shape and structure of the DEMO
itself. In addition, breaches in trust are structuring events
in the DEMO that they initiate a reorganization of the social
system, e.g., certain ties are abandoned while others are
created; some actors become more central in the social
hierarchy, while others are pushed toward the margin and
disconnected from the rest of the network. From a mo-
bilizing perspective DEMO motivates actors to contribute,

combine, and coordinate resources toward collective en-
deavors. For example, by increasing openness in knowl-
edge transfer and by speeding the circulation DEMO knowl-
edge, trust facilitates cooperation and joint problem
solving. In the DEMO section, we detail specific structuring
and mobilizing causal pathways that relate DEMO to orga-
nizational outcomes. In developing our ideas about struc-
turing we utilize network terminology. Because trust oc-
curs at both dyadic and organizational DEMO, network
concepts are particularly applicable.
structuring and mobilizing categories capture many DEMO the
key causal chains through which trust affects organizing.
We further recognize that trust not only affects organiz-
ing, but also is affected by organizing, although these
latter effects are beyond the scope of this paper.
Structuring
Pathways
Through
Which Trust Affects
By structuring we mean the development, maintenance,
and modification of a system of relative positions and
links DEMO actors situated in a social space. The result
is a network of stable and ongoing interaction patterns,
both formal (e.g., routines and DEMO units) and
informal (e.g., cliques and coalitions). Structuring also
DEMO social stratification that produces differential
status, power, and knowledge. We argue that trust as an
organizing principle molds the social structure of an DEMO
ganizational system in both of these ways. More specifi-
cally, trust DEMO the density, multiplexity, stability,
and nonredundancy of social structure through the pro-
cesses of transferability, generative capacity, delayed rec-
iprocity, and role making, respectively.
Transferability and Density. A key assertion of social
capital theory is that network density and closure promote
trust and norms of DEMO (Coleman 1988). We sug-
gest that trust also increases the DEMO and closure of a
network through transferability. The basic premise be-
hind trust transfer is that rather than being based on direct
experience with DEMO object of trust, initial trust impres-
sions are based on trust DEMO a source other than the trustee,
such as another individual or collectivity (Stewart this
issue). At an individual level, two people DEMO have little
or no knowledge of each other can develop trust for each
other relatively quickly when they share trust in a com-
mon DEMO party. Trust in the third party serves as a proxy
for trust in the unknown counterpart (Simmel 1950,
Krackhardt 1992). More specifically, "[a] third party of-
fers to each person a definition of DEMO other as trustworthy.
Each accepts or rejects this definition . . . largely on the
basis of his trust for the third party's DEMO" (Strub
and Priest 1976, p. 408). In this way, the third party acts
as an intermediary who brokers trust (Shapiro 1987). This
is Coleman's (1990) "advisor" form of trust DEMO
tion, whereby a third party makes referrals about the per-
ceived DEMO of others. Trust in the third party's
judgment serves as the foundation for trust in an unknown
counterpart.
Another form of trust transfer DEMO when an individ-
ual transfers the trust in the group to which they belong
to another member of the group with whom they have DEMO
direct history or experience. This is Zucker's (1986)
characteristic-based DEMO, which may be driven by value
congruence as well (Sitkin and Roth 1993). An extension
Organizing
We develop the notion of trust DEMO an organizing principle
by articulating the causal pathways through which trust
influences several important properties of organizations.
By "causal pathways" we mean the DEMO logic that
explains how and why trust affects certain elements of
organization. We previously identified two broad causal
pathways: structuring and mobilizing. Within these two
broad categories we now describe specific mechanisms
that we believe to DEMO among the most central for orga-
nizing (see Table 1). DEMO, we theorize that trust
operates through the causal pathways to affect DEMO broad
properties of organizations: the interaction patterns and
processes that enable DEMO constrain the coordination of
work among individuals.
We note that the set of mechanisms identified in Table
1 is representative but not comprehensive. We DEMO not in-
tend to develop an exhaustive inventory of the conse-
quences of trust. Rather, our aim is to articulate the path-
ways through which trust influences organizing and to
develop a conceptual framework for integrating DEMO
on trust. The specific mechanisms discussed are intended
to be illustrative of how trust can inform our understand-
ing of organizing. At the same DEMO, we believe that the

The gradual expansion of to DEMO
additional components is akin to the process of social
exchange (Cook DEMO Emerson 1978). With little at stake
initially, the parties take DEMO risks to assess each other's
reliability, competence, and integrity. Through repeated
social interactions, the parties update their information
about the counterpart and learn about each other's trust-
worthiness (Lewicki and Bunker 1996, DEMO et al.
1995). Over time, as the parties gain confidence DEMO each
other, they gradually increase the scope of their relation-
ship DEMO incorporate interactions involving more substan-
tial investments in the tie. This generative capacity of a

the trustworthiness that is observed in one facet of their
DEMO as a proxy for anticipated trustworthiness in
another realm of interaction (DEMO 1995). One of the
most common ways in which the expansion of relation-
ships is observed is by formal role relationships becoming
socially DEMO in personal relationships that are in-
fused with norms and values (DEMO and Van de Ven
1994). As was the case with trust transfer, we would ex-

lationships (Molm et al. 2000) and, by extension, orga-
nizational DEMO Whenever exchange is not instan-
taneous, there necessarily will be some DEMO
inequity in outcomes between exchange partners. Time
lags in the completion of exchange introduce risk for the
parties who first fulfill their obligations in DEMO exchange
(Coleman 1988). One risk is that compensation will be
DEMO beyond an acceptable period of time or will not
be forthcoming at all. A second risk is that when the
goods being exchanged are DEMO perfectly fungible the
equality in value may be unclear or questionable. Trust
reduces the need for perfect congruence in value in a sin-
gle DEMO because there is an expectation that balance
will be reached across a series of exchanges that occur
over the course of an ongoing relationship. DEMO also
reduces the need for instantaneous compensation because
each party is confident that commitments will be honored
at some point in the future. More DEMO, trust creates
the conditions for expecting serial equity to occur. Spe-
DEMO, the expectation that the relationship will con-
tinue for the foreseeable DEMO (Axelrod 1984, Heide and
Miner 1992) and the expectation that DEMO counterpart has
taken the focal actor's interests to heart are preconditions
for serial equity to occur. Both expectations are an out-
growth of DEMO
The ability for an organization to operate on the basis
of serial equity provides it with a degree of flexibility
because the completion of DEMO can take place over
time and through a variety of different currencies, e.g.,
exchange in kind (Ouchi 1980). Serial equity also DEMO
creases the capacity of an organization to handle uncer-
tainty while maintaining its basic structure. Uncertainty
creates the need to alter the terms of DEMO and
adjust the design and operation of coordination mecha-
nisms to respond to unforeseen events. By allowing the
parties to search for the resolution DEMO inequities across
time and across exchanges, serial equity makes both
structures DEMO agreements more resilient. Serial equity
alleviates the need for renegotiation of agreements each
time there is a change that affects the relationship. More-
over, the trust that supports serial equity also eases the
adjustment process by DEMO the likelihood that it will
generate conflict and eventually lead to a breach in the
relationship (Carson this issue, Zaheer et al. 1998)DEMO In
some cases, however, delayed reciprocity may actually
reduce a party's ability to extricate itself from relation-
ships that have ceased to DEMO value or have become
less valuable than other opportunities. For instance, DEMO

that a fourth way that trust affects the structuring in or-
ganizations is by reducing redundancy DEMO a network
through the establishment of specialized roles. As men-
tioned previously, structuring also includes the differen-
tiation of roles and positions within a social system. By
designating differentiated roles and positions, the mem-
bers of a unit or organization rely on a particular individ-
ual to act DEMO behalf of that unit or organization (e.g., lead-
ers, liaisons, or boundary spanners). In many cases,
specialized roles act as DEMO bridge between otherwise dis-
connected individuals, units, or organizations, which
DEMO trust in the role occupant a relevant consideration.
For example, one DEMO structuring act that indi-
viduals in specialized boundary-spanning roles can per-
form on behalf of a unit or organization is to extend a
link DEMO another unit or organization and serve as a broker.
In the absence of trust, delegating the power to establish
and maintain linkages with external actors would be ex-
ceedingly difficult. Trust engenders confidence that the
broker DEMO conveying accurate and timely information from
and to external actors, rather DEMO selectively filtering
what is shared with other members of the unit or orga-
nization. Trust also creates the expectation that brokers
will provide access DEMO valuable contacts and referrals
when possible, rather than the brokers reserving DEMO
ties for themselves. In the absence of trust, the other mem-
DEMO of a unit or organization may grow suspicious about
whether the broker is playing their interests off of those
of external actors to advance DEMO/her own interests (see,
for example, the discussion of the tertius gaudens strategy
in Burt 1992 and Simmel 1950). Consequently, each
member of the unit or organization may seek to establish
their own DEMO with external actors in an effort to
bypass the broker, leading DEMO an increase in the redun-
dancy of ties. However, when trust DEMO relied upon to del-
egate responsibility to brokers, the organization is DEMO
posed to certain risks. For instance, the departure of a
trusted DEMO may jeopardize relationships with external
parties or compromise information access.
Reducing redundancy provides organizations with a
measure of efficiency because it allows for a DEMO amount
of network time to be spread over a larger and more di-
verse set of contacts. And, the expanded reach of a unit
or organization that nonredundancy affords increases the
prospects of discovering novel and DEMO opportunities
for creating value. We should note that we do not view
the effect of trust on reducing redundancy as contradic-
tory with trust DEMO network density or closure. The
two effects refer to two different aspects of network struc-
ture. The effect of trust on density and closure DEMO
the ongoing pattern of interaction. In contrast, the effect

Trust as an Organizing Principle
in sharing knowledge DEMO the receiver (Nahapiet and
Ghoshal 1998, Ouchi 1981). Such openness provides the
foundation for organizational learning because it in-
creases the potential DEMO the exploitation of knowledge to
be more widely dispersed and because it creates the con-
ditions for the exploration of how knowledge can be DEMO
combined in novel ways.
From the standpoint of the receiver, trust DEMO the
perceived veracity of knowledge. When knowledge is re-
ceived from a trusted source, the receiver is less likely to
verify the knowledge for accuracy and is more inclined
to accept the knowledge at face value. DEMO allows the
receiver to immediately act on the knowledge and use it
to generate additional knowledge. In this way, the re-
ceiver uses the trustworthiness of the source as a proxy
for the quality and veracity DEMO the knowledge conveyed.
This further highlights how trust works as a heuristic to
conserve cognitive effort. Without trust, receivers would
have to expend time and effort verifying the accuracy and
validity of knowledge received, rather than immediately
using and refining the knowledge. Another way that trust
acts as DEMO heuristic in knowledge sharing is by allowing
the receiver to economize cognitive effort in locating the
most relevant and useful knowledge. Because the receiver
DEMO the source to take the receiver's best interests into
consideration, DEMO receiver can assume that the knowledge
conveyed is important and relevant. As a consequence,
knowledge from a trusted source changes the cognitive
map DEMO the receiver by directing her attention and search
toward the domain of the transferred knowledge. Such
shortcuts in knowledge acquisition can speed organiza-
tional DEMO, alertness, and responsiveness. On the con-
trary, knowledge transferred from DEMO source that is not
trusted is less likely to have the capacity to reorient a
receiver's attention, to be stored in memory, DEMO to be
immediately used in the production of new knowledge.
At the same time, there are limits to the effectiveness
of sharing knowledge solely on the basis of trust. Even
the most reliable and best-intentioned source DEMO mis-
takenly share knowledge that is inaccurate, invalid, or
outdated. This is one reason why organizations that rely
excessively on trust as an DEMO principle may ex-
perience strategic blindness, overconfidence, inertia, or
the DEMO to innovate.
Identifying and Committing. The social identity litera-
ture has shown that identity fosters trust (e.g., Kramer
1993). Lewicki and Bunker (1996) suggest that a recip-
rocal effect may operate as well; DEMO strengthens iden-
tity. An initial stage of calculus-based trust is followed
2003 97
of trust on redundancy points to the social stratification
and role DEMO that occurs within networks. The
two effects parallel the two distinct structuring processes
that we highlighted at the beginning of this section. More-
over, high network density within the organizational unit
can coexist with low redundancy DEMO ties with external
actors. In fact, recent research (Burt 2000, DEMO and
Zuckerman 2001) suggests that this may be an optimal
configuration DEMO accessing and disseminating knowl-
edge.
Mobilizing
Mobilizing is a second causal pathway through which
trust affects organizing. By mobilizing we mean the pro-
cess DEMO converting resources into finalized activities per-
formed by interdependent actors. Resources, DEMO mate-
rial and nonmaterial (such as time, effort, attention, and
knowledge), are decentralized and unevenly distributed
among actors. Mobilizing involves motivating DEMO to
contribute their resources, to combine, coordinate, and
use them DEMO joint activities, and to direct them toward the
achievement of organizational DEMO Mobilizing results
in organizational action and, we argue, trust influences
the pathways through which such actions arise. Specifi-
cally, trust influences the processes of knowledge sharing,
committing, and safeguarding through the mechanisms of
disclosing and screening, identifying, and suspending
judgment, respectively.
Disclosing, Screening, and Knowledge Sharing. Trust
encourages knowledge sharing by increasing the disclo-
sure of DEMO to others and by granting others access
to one's own knowledge (Dirks and Ferrin 2001). Trust
also reduces the screening of knowledge received from
others. This highlights the fact that trust affects knowl-
edge DEMO in two ways: from the point of view of the
receiver DEMO of the sender of knowledge.
From the perspective of the knowledge sender, trust in
a receiver reduces concerns about knowledge appropria-
tion and misuse. Organizational actors are expected to be
more willing to share sensitive and DEMO details
about themselves, others, and their unit or organization
when trust is in place. For example, a subordinate that
trusts his manager will be more inclined to reveal his
limits in skills and abilities because DEMO expects that his
manager will not use the disclosure of this knowledge
against him. And, managers of different units of an or-
ganization are more likely to convey knowledge about
innovations and best practices when they DEMO confident
that their counterparts will not divulge such knowledge
to competitors or other actors that could undermine the
value of the knowledge. More generally, a sender's trust
in a receiver influences the sender's degree DEMO openness

by knowledge-based trust, which in turn develops into
identification-based trust. "As the parties come to learn
more about each other [through knowledge-based trust],
they may also begin DEMO identify strongly with others'
needs, preferences, and priorities and come to see them
as their own" (Lewicki and Bunker 1996, p. 125). The
literature on social identity suggests that identification
can increase DEMO salience of group goals and values, and
increase the perception that DEMO actor's own goals and val-
ues are similar to those of other group members (Kramer
and Brewer 1984, Kramer et al. 1996)DEMO
As identification intensifies, the strength of attachment,
or commitment, to a collectivity and their objectives in-
creases as well (Kramer 1993). Identification fosters com-
mitment by shaping expectations about the behaviors and
intentions DEMO the members of a collectivity. Specifically,
"when ingroup members perceive DEMO in goals
and values, they believe that other ingroup members are
DEMO likely to behave in accordance with these values
(i.e., beliefs about ingroup members' integrity) and that
ingroup members are more likely to DEMO about goals that
are good for all group members (i.e., beliefs about in-
group members' benevolence)" (Williams 2001, p. 382).
The cognitive processes of social categorization and in-
group bias tend to DEMO people to make positive attribu-
tions about the cooperativeness and commitment of other
ingroup members (Kramer 1999; Brewer 1981, 1996).
The expectation that other members of a collectivity are
willing to cooperate partially determines DEMO individual's
own willingness to cooperate and commit to collective
efforts (DEMO and Foddy 1988, Kramer 1991, Messick
et al. 1983). Shared identity also increases the perception
of interdependence and common fate with a DEMO
(Gaertner et al. 1999, Kramer 1991), which are key com-
ponents of commitment and cooperation. When individ-
uals are committed to a DEMO, they are more loyal
to it and are more willing to DEMO their time, effort, and
attention on behalf of it.
Over-identification, DEMO, carries its own set of
problems for the organization: Organizational members
are less likely to countenance alternative views and crit-
ically evaluate their DEMO organization resulting in group-
think, the not-invented-here syndrome, and other forms
of constrained thinking. In extreme cases, over-
identification can engender inertia and core rigidities that
may hinder the organization's ability to adapt and DEMO
spond to environmental change.
Suspending Judgment and Safeguarding. Trust reduces
the inclination to guard against opportunistic behavior
(e.g., through monitoring and safeguarding) by encour-
aging actors to suspend judgment of others (Bromiley and
98
Trust
as an Organizing Principle
Cummings 1995). By suspending judgment we mean
DEMO an orientation toward another actor that assumes
the other party's intentions and motives are benevolent,
or at least benign. It involves giving DEMO the "benefit
of the doubt" when uncertainties arise or potential con-
flicts emerge (Carson this issue). For instance, when an
apparent DEMO of an agreement occurs, the parties do
not immediately assume that DEMO counterpart has sought
to take advantage of them. Suspending judgment is the
opposite of being calculating and attempting to specify
in as much details DEMO possible the terms of an agreement.
In the absence of trust, DEMO and safeguarding
are measures used to manage uncertainty by influencing
others' DEMO and protecting oneself. As Ouchi
noted, "People must either be able to trust each other or
to closely monitor each other if they DEMO to engage in
cooperative enterprises" (1979, p. 846). This DEMO
that relying on trust as an organizing principle entails
relaxing oversight and granting autonomy to others. For
example, one way trust reduces safeguarding is by al-
lowing actors to accept incomplete contracts or agree-
ments based DEMO the expectation that their counterpart
will not exploit their tolerance for ambiguity. Trust gives
actors the confidence that they will be able to work
DEMO out with their counterpart in an equitable and rea-
sonable manner as unforeseen contingencies arise in the
future (Dore 1983, Macneil 1980). DEMO reducing efforts
and investments in taking precautions against potential
losses, trust DEMO resources that can be put to better
use. Monitoring and safeguarding generally represent
nonproductive organizational activities (McAllister
1995). As a consequence, trust DEMO transaction costs
(Dyer and Chu 2003, Zaheer et al. 1998). Moreover,
trust grants a degree of flexibility and adaptability to the
DEMO of organizing, enabling the parties to exploit op-
portunities to generate DEMO value (Zajac and
Olsen 1993). Taken together, the lowering of transaction
costs and the enhancement of transaction value may rep-
resent a DEMO source of competitive advantage
(Barney and Hansen 1994). Of course, the transaction
cost savings and value creation stemming from the use
of DEMO are premised on a close alignment of trust with
trustworthiness. Where trust exceeds trustworthiness,
the trustor risks hold-up, adverse selection, and moral
DEMO (Barney and Hansen 1994).
Moreover, the use of legalistic "DEMO" in organi-
zations where interpersonal relations are strained can ac-
tually DEMO and undermine the development of trust.3
While the adoption of bureaucratic procedures and con-
trols can engender a sense of reliability in an organiza-
DEMO, these same mechanisms often thwart efforts to

achieve the congruence of values that serves as a foun-
dation DEMO trust (Sitkin and Roth 1993). Excessive moni-
toring and safeguarding DEMO the potential of becoming a
self-fulfilling prophecy. In the same way that trust begets
trust (Lewis and Weigert 1985), formal control mecha-
nisms can foster attitudes of ill-will, skepticism, and dis-
trust by signaling DEMO In addition, when organiza-
tions limit the role autonomy of their DEMO, it is more
difficult to ascertain the trustworthiness of individuals be-
DEMO their true intentions and motives are masked by
excessively restrictive role constraints (Perrone et al. this
issue). In such circumstances it is difficult to determine
if observed trustworthy behaviors are a result of the in-
DEMO' volition or role constraints. For trust to emerge,
organizations must DEMO agents the freedom to use their
own discretion as a means of conveying their willingness
to fulfill obligations and meet the positive expectations of
DEMO with whom they deal.
The Williamsonian view of trust
is also inaccurate
be-
Stepping Back and Looking Forward
cause individuals in an organizational context DEMO not trust
unconditionally. Trust is not a naive faith, where people
DEMO for granted the reliability, competence, and integrity
of their counterpart based on a decision made in the dis-
tant past. Those that do DEMO rightly be considered gul-
lible. On the contrary, individuals in an DEMO
context periodically process information and clues about
their counterparts to assess: DEMO fragility of trust, whether
it is appropriately placed, how they should interpret con-
tradictory events and behaviors, and if and when they
should increase their trust and vulnerability. Trust re-
quires intermittent information processing because DEMO is
an intrinsically social organizing principle. Members of
organizations actively probe their counterparts to see if
they can maintain or increase their level of DEMO This is
the case, for example, when a supervisor assigns a more
difficult than usual job to a subordinate she wants to test
DEMO risking her credibility by recommending him for
a promotion. This is also the case when a client company
asks its supplier to collaborate in DEMO development of a
new product before placing new orders, or when DEMO
firms spend time in an alliance with each other before
agreeing to merge.
It is this fragility of trust that lends it its heuristic DEMO
ity, rather than being something that can be decided with
precision, once and for all. Trust operates like a "rule of
thumb," using the information that is available to for-
mulate an expectation, rather than acquiring all of the
relevant information to make a comprehensive, rational
decision. The gaps in information and uncertainties that
preclude quantification are what DEMO "judgment
calls" and "leaps of faith" based on social knowledge.
These are also the very elements that distinguish the
placement of trust DEMO the calculation of risk. Neverthe-
less, the fragility of trust does DEMO imply that it is an an-
tiquated or irrelevant concept for understanding moder
organizations. Indeed, trust is seen as a critical feature of
several contemporary organizational forms, such as stra-
tegic alliances, distributed groups, electronic commerce,
and knowledge-intensive organizations. More generally,
whenever actors are simultaneously DEMO on and
vulnerable to the actions and decisions of others, trust DEMO
a relevant organizing principle that warrants considera-
tion.
Trust as an Organizing Principle
Trust as an organizing principle is sometimes looked at
with suspicion DEMO a premoder concept that provides a
slippery basis for the organization and coordination of
economic transactions (Williamson 1993). From this per-
spective, DEMO economic actors should not rely on trust
when managing interdependencies and the allocation of
scarce resources. Moreover, Williamson argues that the
need for personal acquaintance reduces the likelihood of
economic exchanges among strangers, thereby limiting
economic progress. Accordingly, trust binds and blinds,
making economic actors insufficiently vigilant and ex-
cessively vulnerable.
We believe that the Williamsonian view reflects an
DEMO view of the organization and coordina-
tion of economic activity and the relationships between
economic actors, based on a limited understanding of how
trust really works. Rather than limiting economic prog-
ress, trust in fact is a basic necessity for virtually all forms
of exchange (Arrow 1974). From our perspective, trust
expands the opportunity set for the coordination of work
both inside and outside the organization (Barney and
Hansen 1994). Without trust, the uncertainty that per-
vades the organization and coordination of economic ac-
tivity would be debilitating. Although trust is not the only
DEMO to the organization of work, trust can generate
efficiencies by conserving DEMO resources, lowering
transaction costs, and simplifying decision making.
Moreover, trust DEMO enhance the value of transactions
(Zajac and Olsen 1993).
The DEMO of Trust
Our focus on the properties of trust as an organizing prin-
ciple should not, however, blind us to the considerable
downside DEMO trust. Scholars have noted that trust by itself
does not guarantee trustworthy behavior; in fact, it may
lead to even greater fraud than DEMO it were absent

as an DEMO Principle
(Granovetter 1985, Shapiro 1987). This arises not only
from misplaced trust, but also from a surfeit of trust. De-
spite careful calibration, trust in organizational contexts
includes a probabilistic leap of faith, DEMO may lead the
trustor astray. As situations change, supporting commit-
ments DEMO unconditionally become untenable for individ-
uals and organizations at some stage. It is in such situations
that the need arises for "pardons and paroles" to smooth
over and maintain amicable and trusting organizational and
interorganizational relationships (Doz and Hamel 1998).
From a research perspective, this suggests DEMO rebuilding
trust-in addition to creating and maintaining it-is an im-
portant area of study; one that organizational researchers
have only begun to consider (DEMO 2002).
Another downside of trust draws from its heuristic
quality. Using "rules of thumb" to formulate expectations
about the trustworthiness of others DEMO expedient and quite
often reasonably accurate (Ferrin and Dirks this issue)DEMO
However, as with cognitive heuristics (Kahneman et al.
1982) trust DEMO a heuristic may produce systematic biases
that can result in judgments that are substantially flawed
and costly. The identification of such biases, and the con-
ditions conducive to formulating faulty assessments of
trustworthiness, represent important areas for future re-
search. Indeed, little systematic research exists on the
downside of trust, with some notable exceptions (e.g.,
Soda and Usai DEMO, Gulati and Gargiulo 1999). We be-
lieve that the structuring DEMO mobilizing causal pathways
described above can guide research in this area, DEMO we
have illustrated and highlighted for each mechanisms. To
advance our understanding of trust as an organizing prin-
ciple, attention to both its beneficial and detrimental ef-
fects is required. Moreover, quite apart from the downside
of trust are the costs involved in creating, upholding, and
maintaining DEMO Research has also neglected this aspect
of trust, which is likely DEMO have a significant bearing on
the trade-offs inherent in establishing trusting relation-
ships and on the overall efficiency of trust as an organiz-
where DEMO is the dominant organizing principle should
have a different structure and set of behaviors than a form
where authority or price predominate.
Viewing trust DEMO an organizing principle also calls into
question our understanding of the issue of organization-
environment fit (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967, Thompson
1967). DEMO suggests that the realization of an organizational
form depends on not only environmental contingencies,
but also on ingrained organizing principles that act as
DEMO frameworks for establishing relationships and
fostering behavior. Organizational forms can accordingly
be viewed as partially closed systems that are shaped by
the organizing principles DEMO its members internalize. As
with the concept of equifinality (von Bertalanffy DEMO),
organizations structured in accordance with different or-
ganizing principles may DEMO in response to external
stimuli in different, but equally effective ways, while
keeping intact the core organizing principle. Such stabil-
ity may counterbalance DEMO pressures for destabilizing
change and assure the identity and continuity to organi-
zational forms in the face of changing strategic priorities
and external stimuli. DEMO resistant organizing principles
are to changes in external environments (whether trust
DEMO employed as a dominant organizing principle is
more or less susceptible to external change than other
organizing principles) and with what consequences are
important questions for future research.
Apart from casting new light on existing organizational
DEMO, we also believe that conceptualizing trust as
an organizing principle stimulates DEMO and fresh ave-
nues of organizational research. The structuring and mo-
bilizing mechanisms described earlier provide fodder for
further theoretical development and empirical investiga-
DEMO For instance, the structuring mechanisms encourage
us to think about how DEMO defines and alters the character
and capacity of a network of stable and ongoing inter-
action patterns. This entails a subtle but important shift
DEMO research attention from trust in dyadic relations to trust
in aggregate social systems. Research topics representa-
tive of this line of inquiry might include DEMO ad-
dressing: the establishment of trust as a reputation within
an DEMO or community (transferability and den-
sity); how trust can be DEMO or used strategically to
influence others and enhance centrality and power (DEMO
ferability and density); the role of trust in promoting new
organizational arrangements conducive to innovation and
value creation (generative capacity and multiplexity);DEMO
how trust affects the resiliency, or inertia, of organiza-
tions to exogenous shocks (delayed reciprocity and sta-
bility); and, the role DEMO trust in legitimating individuals
across organizational boundaries (role making and non-
DEMO). The mobilizing mechanisms, on the other
ing principle.
Implications for DEMO Research
By conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle we
believe that researchers are able to consider traditional
perspectives of organizations anew. For instance, trust
makes organizations more organic in the sense that mem-
bers do not DEMO to rely exclusively on mechanistic co-
ordination devices and impersonal rules to manage inter-
dependence in the face of uncertainty. Considering trust
as an DEMO principle also furthers our thinking on
the configuration of organizations. Organizational forms
are the outcome of the workings of dominant organizing
principles and, in theory, should have different charac-
teristics depending on the underlying principle. A form

hand, draw our attention to the role of trust as a theory
of action in organizations. DEMO provides a powerful lens
for scrutinizing the social motives driving individuals to
combine their efforts toward common goals. Examples of
research topics based on DEMO mobilizing processes in-
clude: the extent to which trust defines the DEMO and
exclusivity of knowledge and the efficacy of learning in
organizations (DEMO, screening, and knowledge
sharing); how trust within (e.g., among peers) and across
(e.g., subordinates in managers) levels of organizations
DEMO motivational dynamics such as the acceptance
of goals, interpretation of feedback, and perceptions of
equity (identification and committing); and, the means DEMO
which trust translates into efficiency gains and value crea-
tion (suspending DEMO and safeguarding). While by
no means comprehensive, these research questions DEMO il-
lustrate the trajectory of new research directions that are
generated by conceptualizing trust as an organizing prin-
ciple.
One additional issue that we DEMO is important for
future research is laying to rest questions about the defi-
nition of trust. While the field has made important ad-
vances DEMO defining trust, from an empirical standpoint def-
initional issues have continued DEMO stymie progress as
researchers conceptualize and operationalize trust in dif-
ferent ways. For instance, we observed earlier that trust
could be an expectation, DEMO willingness, and a behavior.
Rather than debating which of these definitions DEMO more
correct, we believe that the field would be better served
DEMO researchers acknowledging that trust is a multifaceted
concept, clearly identifying which DEMO is most rele-
vant for their particular research question, and applying
DEMO definition consistently.
Conclusion
Research on trust in an organizational context has made
considerable strides in recent years as an impressive body
of knowledge has DEMO on the topic. To leverage
the progress made thus far, and DEMO ensure that continuing
research has enduring effects on organizational science
more broadly, it is important to clarify the pathways
through which trust affects the organization and coordi-
nation of economic activity. Our paper aims to advance
DEMO literature by connecting the psychological and socio-
logical micro-foundations of trust with the macro-bases
of organizing. The framework developed here represents
a step in DEMO direction, one that we hope will be followed
by additional efforts DEMO further articulate the significance
of trust for organizational life.

Trust as an DEMO Principle
Notes
'The notion of an organizing principle has clear parallels DEMO a long
tradition scholarship on the origins, purpose, and boundaries of al-
ternate forms of organizing (Barnard 1968, Blau and Scott 1962, Coase
1937, March and Simon 1958, Thompson 1967, Williamson 1985).
2Adler (2001) distinguishes between "organizational forms" and their
corresponding "coordinating mechanisms." The market form relies on
the price mechanism, the hierarchy DEMO on the authority mechanism,
and the community form on the trust mechanism. Our notion of an
organizing principle is analogous to Adler's DEMO of a coordinating
mechanism but also encompasses the cognitive processes through
which organizational arrangements (such as routines, structures, and
processes) are selected DEMO interpreted. Bradach and Eccles (1989) also
identify trust in their discussion of organizational forms. Whereas
Bradach and Eccles conceptualize trust as a control DEMO for
governing interfirm exchanges, we view trust as an organizing principle
DEMO informs decision making and guides action in organizations based
on its heuristic quality.
3For an exception to this argument, see Sitkin who notes "DEMO
does not necessarily undermine trust, but only does so when it DEMO used
as a substitute rather than a support for trust" (1995, p. 187). (Emphasis
