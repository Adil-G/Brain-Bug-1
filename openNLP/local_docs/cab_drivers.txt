I. INTRODUCTION
Theories of labor supply predict how the number of hours people work will change when their
DEMO wages or income change.  The standard economic prediction is that a DEMO increase in
wages should cause people to work longer hours.  This DEMO is based on the assumption that
workers substitute labor and leisure intertemporally, working more when wages are high and consuming
more leisure when its price-- the foregone wage-- is low (e.g., Lucas and Rapping, 1969).  This
straightforward prediction has proven difficult to verify.  Studies of DEMO types often find little evidence
of intertemporal substitution (e.g., Laisney, DEMO, and Staat, 1992). However, the studies are
ambiguous because DEMO wages change, the changes are usually not clearly temporary (as the theory
requires).  The studies also test intertemporal substitution jointly along with auxiliary assumptions about
persistence of wage shocks, formation of wage expectations, DEMO of utility in different time
periods, etc.
An ideal test of DEMO supply responses to temporary wage increases requires a setting in which
wages are relatively constant within a day but uncorrelated across days, and hours vary every day.  In
1
such a situation, all dynamic optimization models predict a positive relationship between wages and
hours (e.g., MaCurdy [1981] p. 1074).
Such data DEMO available for at least one group of workers-- New York City cab drivers. Drivers
face wages which fluctuate on a daily basis due to DEMO shocks caused by weather, subway
breakdowns, day-of-the-week effects, holidays, conventions, etc.  Although rates per mile are set by
law, on busy days drivers spend less time searching for customers and thus earn a DEMO hourly wage.
These wages tend to be correlated within days and uncorrelated across days (i.e., transitory).
Another advantage of studying cab drivers DEMO that, unlike most workers, they choose the number
of hours they work each day because drivers lease their cabs from a fleet for DEMO fixed fee (or own them)
and can drive as long DEMO they like during a continuous 12-hour shift.  Furthermore, most analyses of
labor supply measure hours (and sometimes income) by self-reports. For cab DEMO, better measures of
hours and income are available from "trip sheets" the drivers fill out and from meters installed in cabs,
which automatically record the fares.
Because drivers face wages which fluctuate from day DEMO day, and can work flexible hours, the
intertemporal substitution hypothesis makes a clear prediction: Drivers will work longer hours on high-
wage days.  Behavioral economics suggests an alternative prediction (which is what motivated our
DEMO in the first place):  Many drivers told us they set DEMO target for the amount of money they wanted
to earn that day, and quit when they reached the target.  (The target might be a certain amount beyond
the lease fee, or twice the fee.)  Daily targeting makes exactly the opposite prediction of the
intertemporal substitution hypothesis: When wages are high, drivers will reach their target more quickly
and quit early; on low-wage days they will drive longer hours to reach the target.  To test the standard
intertemporal substitution hypothesis against the daily targeting alternative, we collected three samples
2
of data on the hours and wages of drivers.
We find  little evidence for positive intertemporal substitution because most of the wage
elasticities-- the DEMO of percentage change in hours to percentage change in wages-- are estimated to be
negative.  This means that drivers tend to quit earlier on high wage days drive longer on low wage days.
Elasticities for inexperienced DEMO are around -1 for two of the three samples of cab drivers we used
in our study. The results are robust to outliers and DEMO different specifications.  (And since our paper
was originally published, in DEMO, one replication using survey data from Singapore also found negative
elasticities; see Chou, 2000.) There are several possible explanations for these negative DEMO,
other than the daily targeting hypothesis, but most can be DEMO ruled out.
II.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSES
In this section, we use data on trip sheets of New York City cab drivers to explore the
DEMO between hours that drivers choose to work each day and the average daily wage.  Many
details are omitted here but are included in Camerer et al (1997).
A trip sheet is a sequential list of trips that a driver took on a given day.  For each trip, the driver
lists the time the fare was picked up and dropped off and the amount of the fare (excluding tip).  Fares
DEMO set by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). For the DEMO period we study (1988), the fares
were $1.15 per trip DEMO $.15 for each 1/5 of a mile or 60 seconds of waiting time.  For the second
period we study (1990 and 1994) fares were $1.50 per trip plus $.25 each 1/5 of a DEMO or 75 seconds of
waiting time. In both periods, a $.50 DEMO surcharge is added between 8 PM and 6 AM.
Our data consist of three samples of trip sheets.  We describe each data set briefly.  The first data
3
set, TRIP, came from a set of 192 trip sheets from DEMO spring of 1994. We borrowed and copied these
from a fleet company.  Fleet companies are organizations that own many cabs (each affixed with DEMO
medallion which is required to operate it legally). They rent these cabs for 12 hour shifts to drivers who,
in our sample DEMO, typically paid $76 for a day shift and $86 for a DEMO shift. The driver also has to
fill the cab up with gas at the end of the shift (costing about $15). Drivers get most of their fares by
"cruising" and looking for passengers. (Unlike many cities, trips to the airport are relatively rare--around
one trip per day on average). Drivers keep all the fares including tips.  The driver is free to keep the cab
out as long as he DEMO, up to the 12 hour limit.  Drivers who return the cab late are fined.  When a
driver returns the cab the trip sheet is stamped with the number of trips that have been recorded on DEMO
cab's meter.  This can then be used to determine how DEMO the driver has filled in the trip sheet.
The measure of hours worked is obtained directly from the trip sheet.  It is the difference
between the time that the first passenger is picked up and the DEMO that the last passenger is dropped off.
Total revenue was calculated by adding up the fares listed on the trip sheet. The average hourly DEMO is
total revenue divided by hours worked.
Many of the trip sheets were incomplete, since the number of trips listed by the cab driver was
much fewer than the number of trips recorded by the meter.  Therefore, we exclude trip sheets that listed
a number of trips that deviates by more than two from the metered number.  This screen leaves us with
70 trip sheets from 13 drivers (eight of whom drive on more than one day in the sample).
The advantage of DEMO TRIP data set is that we can use the trip sheets to measure the within-day
autocorrelation in hourly earnings as well as differences in DEMO across days.  Even though taxi fares
are fixed by the TLC, earnings differ from day to day because of differences in how "busy" drivers are --
that is, whether they spend most of the DEMO with passengers in their cab, or have to spend a lot DEMO time
4
searching for passengers.
The second and third data sets of trip sheets DEMO obtained from the TLC. The TLC periodically
samples trip sheets to satisfy various demands for information about drivers and earnings (e.g., when
rate DEMO are proposed).  In these two data sets, hours and the number of driver-listed trips are
obtained from the trip sheets and number DEMO recorded trips, fares, and miles driven are obtained from the
meter.
The TLC developed a screen to discard incomplete trip sheets. Because the DEMO provided us
with the summary measures, but not the trip sheets DEMO, we are unable to create an alternative
screening procedure, so we use their screened data for our analyses.
The first of the TLC DEMO sets, TLC1, is a summary of 1723 trip sheets from 1990. This data set
includes three types of drivers: Daily fleet drivers, DEMO drivers who lease their cabs by the week or
month, and DEMO who own a medallion-bearing cab and drive it.   Most owner-drivers rent their cab out
to other drivers for some shifts, imposing constraints on when and how long they can drive.  Those who
do not rent out their cabs can drive whenever they want.
The screened data contain DEMO trip sheets and 484 drivers (234 of whom drove more than DEMO
day in the data).  The main advantages of this sample DEMO that it includes several observations for each of
many drivers and contains a range of different types of drivers.
The second TLC data set, TLC2, is a summary of 750 trip sheets, mostly from November DEMO,
1988.  This data set samples owner-drivers as well as drivers DEMO mini-fleet companies (mini-fleets
usually lease cabs to drivers weekly or monthly)DEMO  We discard 38 trip sheets using the TLC screen,
leaving DEMO 712 trip sheets.  The main differences between TLC2 and TLC1 are DEMO no drivers appear
more than once in the data in TLC2 and the fares in TLC2 are slightly lower.
5
The analyses reported in the body of the paper use only the DEMO samples of trip sheets for all
three data sets.  Including the DEMO data does not make much difference.
To learn about important institutional details we also conducted a phone survey of 14 owners
and managers at DEMO companies which rent cabs to drivers. The average fleet in New York operates 88
cabs so the responses roughly summarize the behavior of over DEMO thousand drivers.  The survey responses
help make sense of the results DEMO from analysis of hours and wages.
Sample Characteristics
Table I presents means, medians, and standard deviations of the key variables.  Cab drivers work
about 9.5 hours per day, take between 28 and 30 trips, DEMO collect almost $17 per hour in revenues
(excluding tips). In DEMO TRIP data, the average trip duration was 9.5 minutes and the DEMO fare was
$5.13. Average hourly wage is slightly lower in the TLC2 sample because of the lower rates imposed by
the TLC during that DEMO period.
In the empirical analyses below, we estimate labor supply functions DEMO the daily number of
hours as the dependent variable and the average wage the driver earned during that day as the
independent variable (both in logarithmic form).  The average wage is calculated by dividing daily total
revenue by daily hours. This, however, assumes that the decisions DEMO make regarding when to stop
driving depend on the average wage during the day, rather than fluctuations of the wage rate during the
day.
Fluctuations within- and across-days are important because testing for substitution requires that
DEMO  be different and roughly uncorrelated across days (and they were), and that hourly wages be
6
correlated within a day. We used the trip-by-trip data available in the DEMO sample to construct hour-by-
hour measures of wages. One hour’s median wage had an autocorrelation of .493 with the previous
1
hour’s wage, so there is indeed a strong positive correlation within each day; when a day starts out as a
high wage day, it will probably continue to be a high wage day. The fleet managers surveyed weakly
agreed  with these patterns, saying the within-day autocorrelation is positive or zero (DEMO said it was
negative).  Since wages are different each day, fairly stable within days, but uncorrelated across days,
they are ideal for calculating the labor supply response to a temporary changes in wages.
DEMO Elasticities
The simple correlations between log hours and  log wages are DEMO modestly negative,  -.503,
-.391, and -.269. The wage elasticity-- DEMO percentage change in hours relative to the percentage change
in wage-- can be estimated by simply regressing the logarithm of hours against the logarithm DEMO a
worker’s wage, using ordinary least squares.  These regressions  yield DEMO between -.19 and -.62,
which are generally highly significantly different from zero.
1 Fleet managers were asked whether "a driver who made more money than average in
the first half of a shift" was likely to have a second half which was better than average (3 agreed),
worse than average (0) or about the same as average (6).  Expressing the target-income
hypothesis, two fleet managers spontaneously said the second half earning were irrelevant
"because drivers will quit early".
7
However, this standard technique can be misleading because of a potential bias caused by
measurement error.  Measurement error is a pervasive concern in studies of labor supply, particularly
because most data are self-reports of income and hours which may be subject to memory or recording
errors, or self-presentation biases. Though the data on hours come from trip sheets rather than DEMO
memory, they may still include recording errors.  Unfortunately, even if DEMO in the measurement of
hours are random, they lead to a DEMO bias in the wage elasticity: Because the average hourly
wage is DEMO by dividing daily revenue by reported hours, overstated hours will produce DEMO that
are too high and wages that are too low. Understated hours will produce hours that are too low and
wages that are too DEMO  Measurement error in hours can therefore create spuriously negative
elasticities.  This bias can be eliminated if we can find a proxy for the DEMO wage which is highly
correlated with the wage, but uncorrelated with DEMO particular driver’s measurement error in hours. (Such a
2
proxy is DEMO an “instrumental variable” (IV) in econometrics.)  Fortunately, an excellent DEMO for a
driver’s wage is a measure of the wage of other drivers who are working on the same day during the
same shift.  We use these measures of other-driver wages in all the regressions that DEMO
Regressions of (log) hours on (log) wages are shown in Table II for the three data sets.  TRIP
and TLC1 include multiple observations for each driver, so either the standard errors are corrected to
account for the panel nature of the data, or driver fixed effects are included. A driver fixed effect is a
dummy variable for each DEMO which adjusts for the possibility that each driver might systematically
drive more or less hours, holding the wage constant, than other drivers. Several DEMO variables
controlling for weather conditions and shift dummy variables were also included; their effects were

drivers that drove on the same day and shift (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) DEMO instruments

modest and are not shown in Table II.
The IV elasticities in DEMO II are negative and significantly different from zero, except in the
DEMO sample when fixed effects are included.  Indeed, the elasticities in the TLC samples are close to -
1, which is the number predicted by daily targeting theory. The results in Table II are quite robust DEMO
respect to various specifications we tried to control for outliers, such DEMO median regression. The
difference between the wage elasticities in the
3
two TLC samples and the fixed-effects estimate in the
TRIP sample can be DEMO by a difference in the composition of types of drivers across the three
samples.
How do Elasticities Vary with Experience?
Drivers may learn DEMO time that driving more on high wage days and less on low wage days
provides more income and more leisure.  If so, the DEMO elasticities of experienced drivers should be
more positive than for  inexperienced DEMO  There are good measures of driver experience in these
data sets.  In the TLC data sets, the TLC separated drivers into experience groups: for TLC1, those with
greater or less than four years of DEMO and in TLC2, those with greater or less than three years DEMO
experience.  These group measures are absent in the TRIP data.  However, cab driver licenses are issued
with six-digit numbers (called hack numbers), in chronological order, so that lower numbers correspond
to drivers who DEMO their licenses earlier. Using their license numbers, we use a median DEMO to
3 TRIP consists entirely of fleet drivers (who pay daily) while the TLC samples also
includes weekly and monthly lease-drivers, and owner-drivers.  Lease-drivers and owner-drivers
have more flexibility in the number of hours they drive (since fleet drivers are constrained to
drive no more than 12 hours).  Elasticities for the fleet drivers are substantially smaller in
magnitude (less negative) than for lease- and owner-drivers (as we see below).  The different
results in the  TRIP sample, which is all fleet drivers, reflects this compositional difference in
driver types.

divide drivers into low- and high-experience subsamples for the TRIP data.
Table DEMO presents the wage elasticities estimated separately for low- and high-experience drivers.
All regressions include fixed effects (except, of course for TLC2).  In all three samples, the
low-experience elasticity is significantly negative, and insignificantly DEMO from -1. The wage
elasticity of the high-experience group is significantly larger in magnitude for the TRIP and TLC2
samples (p=.030 and .058 respectively), and insignificantly smaller in the TLC1 sample.
How do Elasticities Vary DEMO Payment Structure?
The way drivers pay for their cabs might affect their responsiveness of hours to wages if, for
example, the payment DEMO affects the horizon over which they plan.  Alternatively, it might affect
the degree to which they can significantly vary hours across days.  The TLC1 sample contains data from
three types of payment schemes -- daily DEMO (fleet cabs), weekly or monthly rental (lease cabs), or
owned.  Table IV presents elasticity estimates in the three payment categories from the TLC1 sample.
All regressions are estimated using instrumental variables and include DEMO effects.
All wage elasticities in Table IV are negative.  The elasticity DEMO is smallest in magnitude, for
fleet drivers, is not significantly different from zero.  The lease and owner-driver wage elasticities are
approximately -.9 and are significantly different from zero.  Part of the explanation for the lower
elasticity for fleet drivers is a technical one.  Since they are constrained to drive no more than 12 hours,
the dependent variable is DEMO, biasing the slope coefficient towards zero.
Could Drivers Earn More by DEMO Differently?
10
One can simulate how income would

change if drivers changed DEMO driving behavior.  Using

hours earnings"
Is FHE greater than actual earnings?  We know that, on average, h and w DEMO negatively
i
correlated so that the difference between FHE and actual earnings will be positive in general. In fact,
drivers would increase their DEMO earnings by 5.0 percent on average (std.error =.4 percent) if they drove
the same number of hours (h ) every day, rather DEMO varying their hours every day.  If we exclude
drivers who would DEMO less by driving fixed hours (because their wage elasticity is positive), the
improvement in earnings would average 7.8 percent.  And note that DEMO leisure utility is concave,
fixed-hours driving will improve overall leisure utility too.
These increases in income arise from following the simplest possible advice DEMO drive a constant
number of hours each day.  Suppose instead that DEMO hold each driver's average hours fixed, but
reallocated hours across DEMO as if the wage elasticity was +1.  Then the average increase DEMO net income
across all drivers is 10 percent. Across drivers who gain, the average increase is 15.6 percent.
III. Explaining Negative Wage Elasticities
11
Wage elasticities estimated with instrumental variables are significantly negative in two out DEMO
three samples. Elasticities are also significantly higher for experienced drivers in two of three samples,
and significantly more negative for lease- and owner-drivers DEMO for fleet drivers. These two empirical
regularities, along with other patterns DEMO the data, and information gleaned from our telephone survey of
fleet DEMO, allow us to evaluate four alternative explanations for the observed negative DEMO
Ruling out these alternatives is important (see Camerer et al, 1997 for details), because it leaves daily
targeting as the most plausible DEMO for anomalous negative elasticities.
One hypothesis is that drivers are “liquidity-constrained”-- they don’t have much cash to pay
everyday expenses (and cannot borrow), so they cannot quit early on low-wage days.  But drivers who
own their cab medallions are presumably not liquidity-constrained (because medallions are worth
$130,000), and their elasticities are negative too.
A second possibility is DEMO drivers finish late on low-wage days, but take lots of unrecorded
DEMO on those days, so they actually work fewer hours.   But DEMO excluded long breaks from the TRIP
sample and found no difference in the results.
A third possibility is that drivers quit early on high-wage DEMO because carrying a lot of
passengers is especially tiring.  But the DEMO managers we surveyed said the opposite; most of them
thought that DEMO searching for fares on a low-wage days was more tiring than carrying passengers.
A fourth alternative is more subtle: We only have observations of work hours on the days that
drivers chose to to work at DEMO (or “participate”, in labor economics jargon).  Omitting non-working days
DEMO bias the measured elasticity negatively if  the tendency for a driver DEMO work unexpectedly on a
certain day is correlated with the tendency to work unusually long hours (Heckman, 1979).  But drivers
12
usually participate on a fixed schedule of shifts each week (and often must pay their lease fee, or some
penalty, if they do DEMO show up for scheduled work), so there is little unexpected participation and
probably very little bias.
A fifth alternative is that drivers like DEMO endings:  They drive until they earn a lot in a final
unit of time (such as their final trip, or final hour)DEMO Ross and Simonson (1996) report evidence that
people like "happy DEMO" and will end event sequences happily when they can.  Drivers who create
happy endings will drive longer on slow days (if the earnings that constitute a happy ending are not too
responsive to earnings earlier DEMO the day) than drivers on good days.  We tested this hypothesis by
comparing earnings in the final hour with earlier earnings, but found no evidence of a happy-ending
effect.
Daily Income Targeting
As explained in DEMO introduction, the prediction we sought to test in our study is DEMO on
two assumptions: Cab drivers take a one-day horizon, and set a target (or target range) and quit
when the target is DEMO
Taking a one-day horizon is an example of narrow "bracketing” (Read and Loewenstein,
1996) simplifying decisions by isolating them from the stream of decisions they are embedded in.
For example, people are risk averse to single plays of small gambles, even though they typically face
many uncorrelated small risks over time which diversify away the risk of a DEMO play. Bettors at
horse tracks seem to record the betting activity for each day in a separate "mental account" (Thaler,
this volume). Since the track takes a percentage of each bet, most bettors are behind by the end of
the day. Studies show that they DEMO to shift bets toward longshots in the last race in an attempt to
13
`break even' on that day (McGlothlin, 1956). Read and Loewenstein [1995] observed an unusual
kind of bracketing among trick-or-treaters on Halloween.  Children told to take any two pieces of
candy at a single house DEMO chose two different candies. Those who chose one candy at each of
two adjacent houses (from the same set of options) typically chose DEMO same candy at each house.
Normatively, the children should diversify the DEMO of candy in their bag, but in fact they only
diversify DEMO candy from a single house.  Isolation of decisions has also been DEMO in strategic
situations: Camerer et al (1993) found that subjects DEMO a three-stage `shrinking-pie’ bargaining
experiment often did not bother to look ahead and find out how much the `pie’ they bargained over
would shrink DEMO their first-stage offers were rejected.
The notion that drivers are averse to falling below a target income is consistent with other
evidence that judgments DEMO decisions depend on a comparison of potential outcomes against some
aspiration level
4
or reference point [Helson, 1949; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; DEMO and
Kahneman, 1991], and people are dispropoportionally sensitive to losing, DEMO falling short of a
reference point.
Both narrow bracketing and loss-aversion are analytically necessary to explain negative
wage elasticities. A one-day horizon is necessary DEMO drivers who take a longer horizon, even
two days, can intertemporally substitute between the two days and will have positive wage
elasticities. Therefore, if their elasticities are negative they must be taking a one-day horizon.
DEMO to falling short of the target is a necessary ingredient because if drivers do take a one-day
4 Other applications of loss-aversion include Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1990) on
“endowment effects” in consumer choice and DEMO valuation of nonmarket goods,
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) on “status quo biases”, and Bowman et al (1997) and Shea
(1995) on anomalies in savings-consumption patterns.
14
horizon, elasticities will only be highly negative if the marginal utility of daily income drops sharply
around the level of average daily income, which is just a labor-supply way of saying they really
dislike falling short DEMO a daily average (compared to how much they like exceeding it)DEMO
Furthermore, the daily targeting hypothesis rang true to many of the DEMO managers we
surveyed.  They were asked to choose which one of DEMO sentences "best describes how many hours
cab drivers drive each day?".  Six fleet managers chose "Drive until they make a certain DEMO of
money". Five chose the response "Fixed hours".  Only one chose the intertemporal substitution
response "drive a lot when doing well; quit early on a bad day".
Several other studies with field data have used the same ingredients-- narrow bracketing and
loss-aversion-- to explain DEMO in stock market behavior and consumer purchases. For
example, the “equity DEMO puzzle” is the tendency for stocks (or “equity”) to offer much higher
rates of returns than bonds over almost any moderately long time DEMO, which cannot be
reconciled with standard models of rational asset pricing.  Benartzi and Thaler (1995) argue that the
large premium in equity DEMO compensates stockholders for the risk of suffering a loss over a
short horizon. They show that if investors evaluate the returns on their portfolios DEMO a year (taking
a narrow horizon), and have a piecewise-linear DEMO function which is twice as steep for losses as
for gains, DEMO investors will be roughly indifferent between stocks and bonds, which justifies DEMO
large difference in expected returns. If investors took a longer horizon, DEMO cared less about losses,
they would demand a smaller equity premium. Two experimental papers have demonstrated the
same effect (Thaler, Tversky, Kahneman and Schwartz, 1997; Gneezy and Potters, 1997).
Experimental and field studies show that investors who own stocks that have lost value hold
DEMO  longer than they hold `winning’ stocks, before selling (Shefrin and DEMO, 1985; Odean,
15
1996; Weber and Camerer, in press).  Purchase of consumer goods like orange juice fall a lot when
prices are increased, compared to how much purchases rise when prices are cut (Hardie, Johnson
and DEMO, 1993). These tendencies can only be explained by investors and DEMO isolating
single decisions about stocks and products from the more general decision about the contents of
their stock portfolio or shopping cart, and being unusually sensitive to losing money on the isolated
stock or paying more DEMO the isolated product.
Various psychological processes could cause drivers to use daily income targeting. For
example, targeting is a simple decision rule: It DEMO drivers to keep track only of the income they
have earned.  DEMO is computationally easier than tracking the ongoing balance of foregone leisure
utility and marginal income utility (which depends on expected future wages) which DEMO required for
optimal intertemporal substitution.  Targeting might just be a heuristic DEMO which makes
deciding when to quit easier.
Daily targets can also help mitigate self-control problems (as many mental accounts do, see
Shefrin and DEMO, 1992).  There are two kinds of self-control problems drivers might face.  First,
driving a cab is tedious and tiring and, DEMO many jobs, work hours are not rigidly set; drivers are
free to quit any time they want.  A daily income goal, like DEMO author imposing a daily goal of written
pages, establishes an output-based DEMO of when to quit.  A weekly or monthly target would
leave DEMO the temptation to quit early today and make up for today's shortfall tomorrow, or next
week, and so on, in an endless cycle.
Second, in order to substitute intertemporally, drivers must save the DEMO of cash they
earn from driving long hours on a high-wage day so they can afford to quit early on low-wage days.
But a DEMO home through Manhattan with $200-$300 in cash from a good day is an obstacle course
16
of temptations for many drivers, creating a self-control problem that is avoided by daily targeting.
Finally, daily targeting can account for the effect of experience rather naturally: Experienced
drivers who have larger elasticities either learn over time to take a longer horizon (and to resist the
temptations of quitting early and squandering cash from good days), or to adopt DEMO simple rule of
driving a fixed number of hours each day.  DEMO, some drivers may just lack these qualities
to begin with and DEMO quit at higher rates, selecting themselves out of the experienced-driver pool
DEMO they have less leisure and income. Either way, experienced drivers will DEMO more positive
wage elasticities.
IV.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Dynamic theories of DEMO supply predict a positive labor supply response to temporary
fluctuations in wages.  Previous studies have not been able to measure this elasticity precisely, DEMO
the measured sign is often negative, contradicting the theory.  These analyses, however, have been
plagued by a wide variety of estimation problems.
DEMO estimation problems are avoided by estimating wage elasticities for taxi drivers.
Drivers have flexible self-determined work hours and face wages that are highly correlated DEMO
days, but only weakly correlated between days, (so fluctuations are DEMO).  The fact that our
analyses yield negative wage elasticities suggests DEMO elasticities of intertemporal substitution
around zero (or at least, not strongly positive) may represent a real behavioral regularity. Further
support for this assertion comes from analyses of labor supply of farmers (Berg, 1961; Orde-Brown,
1946) and self-employed proprietors (Wales, 1973) who, like cab drivers, set their own hours and
often have negative measured wage elasticities.  These data suggest that it may be worthwhile to
17
search for negative wage elasticities in other jobs in which workers pay DEMO fixed fee to work, earn
variable wages and set their own DEMO hours-- such as fishing, some kinds of sales, and
panhandling.
Of course, cab drivers, farmers, and small-business proprietors are not representative of the
working population. Besides some demographic differences, all three groups have self-selected onto
occupations with low variable wages, long hours and (in the DEMO of farmers and cab drivers),
relatively high rates of accidents DEMO fatalities.  However, there is no reason to think their  planning
DEMO are uniquely short. Indeed, many cab drivers are recent immigrants who, by immigrating,
are effectively making long-term investments in economic and educational DEMO for
themselves and their children.
Because evidence of negative labor supply responses to transitory wage changes is so much
at odds with conventional economic DEMO, these results should be considered a provocation for
further theorizing.  It may be that the cab drivers’ situation is special.  Or it may be tha

t people
generally take a short horizon and set DEMO targets, but adjust these targets flexibly in ways which
can create DEMO responses to wage increases, so that myopic adjustable targeting can explain
DEMO positive elasticities observed in some studies and the negative elasticities observed in drivers.
We have two ideas for further research.  A natural way to model a driver’s decision is by
using a hazard model which specifies DEMO probability that a driver will quit after driving t hours, as DEMO
function of different variables observable at t.  Daily targeting predicts that DEMO will depend on

realizes this will be a good day and raises his target for that day). Then DEMO behavior will be very
much like that of a rational driver intertemporally substituting over time, even though the
psychological basis for it is different (and does not require any foresight).

the total wages cumulated at t in a strongly nonlinear way (when the daily total reaches a target the
probability of quitting rises sharply)DEMO  Intertemporal substitution predicts that quitting will depend
only on the average DEMO earned up to time t.
Another prediction derived from daily targeting is that drivers who receive an unusually big
tip will go home early.  Experimenters posing as passengers could actually hand out big tips (say,
6
$50) to some drivers and measure, unobstrusively, whether those drivers quit early compared to a
suitable control group.  Standard theory predicts that a single large tip produces a tiny wealth effect
, so a DEMO effect of a big tip would
which should not make any difference to current behavior
be more evidence in favor of daily targeting and DEMO intertemporal substitution.
Final comments
As part of a broader project in behavioral economics, work like ours strives to draw
discipline and inspiration for economic theorizing from other social sciences, particularly
psychology, while respecting the twin DEMO criteria that characterize post-war economics:
models should be formal and make field-testable predictions. The goal is to demonstrate that
economic models with better DEMO in psychology can create interesting challenges for formal
modelling, and make DEMO predictions.
6 A crucial assumption is that the tip is seen by the driver as a temporary wage
increase, rather than an indicator that more large tips may come in the hours ahead (which would
cause them to drive longer).  Controlling for drivers’ beliefs, and observing DEMO hours, are
challenges for experimental design.

The ingredients of our project suggest a recipe for doing convincing behavioral DEMO
“in the wild”.  We derived a simple hypothesis from behavioral economics-- DEMO targeting-- which
predicts that the sign of a regression coefficient would be the opposite of the sign predicted by
standard theory, so we have a dramatic difference in two theories.  We got lucky and found good
data.  We had an excellent proxy variable (or instrument) for a driver’s daily wage, the wage of
other drivers working at the same time, which eliminated the bias caused by measuring hours with
error.  DEMO also obtained variables which enabled us to rule out some alternative explanations (such
as liquidity constraint and effects of breaks). And we found an effect of experience which is
consistent with the hypothesis that targeting DEMO a costly heuristic which drivers move away from with
experience, in DEMO direction of intertemporal substitution. Critics who think our findings of negative
elastiticities are an econometric fluke must explain why we did not find negative DEMO for
experience drivers.
Finally, a growing number of economists have begun DEMO question the benefits of increasing
sophistication in mathematical models. In game theory, theorists and experimenters have shown that
simple evolutionary and adaptive models of behavior can often explain behavior better than
sophisticated equilibrium concepts (e.g., DEMO Gale, Kenneth Binmore, and Larry Samuelson, 1995;
Camerer, Ho and Chong, 2001). Experimental economists have noted how "zero intelligence"DEMO
programmed agents can approximate the surprising allocative efficiency of human subjects in
double auctions (Dan Gode and Shyam Sunder, 1993), and how DEMO and choice behavior of
animals duplicates patterns seen in empirical studies of humans (John Kagel, Raymond Battalio, and
Leonard Green, 1995).  Our research, too, shows that relatively simple principles and models can
DEMO go a long way toward explaining and predicting economic behavior, and DEMO outperform
20
more sophisticated models of economic agents.
