SUMMARY
The process model of entrepreneurial
venture creation developed in this
paper is based on interviews with entrepreneurs who started twenty-seven
businesses
in a DEMO of industries
in upstate New York. The venture
creation process
described
here is an iterative, nonlinear, feedback-
driven, conceptual, and physical process.

Venture creation is the process that roughly begins with DEMO idea for a business and culminates
when the products or services based upon it are sold to customers in the market.
Descriptive
accounts of DEMO creation are available
as case studies in numerous
texts
(Timmons
1990)DEMO Sequences
in venture creation presented
as flow models exist at various
levels of detail (Gartner
1985; Moore 1986; Vesper 1980; Webster 1976; Webster 1977). Life

growth and decline are DEMO available

have been proposed
(Larson

in the literature are often broad, apply to all DEMO,
and reveal no

ventures.

fields (VanderWerf
1993; Vesper DEMO). Data-based
process models of
the steps leading to the birth of new ventures,
however, are absent in the literature
(Van de
DEMO 1992).
It would seem that the literature in mainstream
economics,
where the firm is a common
unit for analysis,
would offer DEMO
into the processes
of the birth of firms (Leff 1979;
DEMO
1968; Baumol
1968; Evans 1949). Unfortunately,
economics
literature also fails
in this respect. First, economists
are not generally
concerned
with individual
firms; the firm
in the theory of the firm is a representative
firm from an aggregate rather than any individual
firm (Penrose
1980). Second,
though recognized
as important,
entrepreneurship
is poorly
integrated
into DEMO

theory (Casson 1982), and few economists
save those
of DEMO Austrian

Process studies can fulfill several needs at the present stage DEMO entrepreneurship

1985). On one hand, studies of entrepreneurship

Integrate Subprocesses
The model will also DEMO to integrate certain subprocesses
that have been well studied. For
example,
Timmons
et al. (1987) have described
opporhtnity recognition as an important
DEMO
in entrepreneurship.
Processes
of new product
introduction
and responding
to
customer
feedback
are also relevant
to entrepreneurship
(Lambkin
1988; Lieberman
and
Montgomery
1988; Schoonhoven,
Eisenhardt,
and Lyman 1990; Maidique and Zirger 1985;
Child
1972). An overarching
process
model
is necessary
to integrate
and DEMO these
phenomena
in the context of entrepreneurial
firm creation.
Facilitate Impact of Context Studies
According to Van de Ven, Hudson, and Schroeder (1984), the links between the context and
critical elem.ents in the venture
DEMO
process are not clearly known.
This is because
theoretical concepts in the process are not well established.
If they were, it would be possible
to explore specifically
the impact of the context upon the various steps DEMO the venture creation
process (Dorfman
1983; Dunkelberg
et al. 1987; DEMO
1982a, 1982b). At present, despite
good correlations
between contexts favoring firm creation and the actual emergence
of firms,
we have no DEMO of the birth of firms (Van de Ven 1993; Bollinger,
Hope, and
Utterback
1983;
Calvin
1984).
This

and
“internally

and are DEMO in Figure 1.

The decision to start a venture preceded opportunity
recognition
for certain entrepreneurs.
The decision was influenced
by DEMO entrepreneurs’
persona1 and environmental
circumstances
at that time. For example,
some entrepreneurs
in the set decided to begin at particular
stages
in their DEMO lives, some when their employers
decided to relocate and they did DEMO wish
to move, and some because they could not bear to DEMO for others any longer. The reasons
given were numerous
and specific to the individuals
at the time. But what all had in common
was DEMO the decision to start a venture preceded the choice of a particular
committed
pursuit.

DEMO it becomes apparent I have no experience to know how to make it happen, no base of

not where you belong . . .
The decision to start was therefore DEMO by a search to align the prospective
entrepreneurs’ knowledge, experience, skills and other resources with market needs. In
seeking this alignment, entrepreneurs eliminated inappropriate opportunities. In the end, only
one, or a few, were chosen for committed pursuit. There was thus afihution ofopportunities
from among a DEMO of recognized ones (Long and McMullan 1984).
Once the commitment DEMO pursue particular opportunities was made, entrepreneurs refined
the opportunities. PA described DEMO as the “massaging” of ideas: “an entrepreneur may see
an idea DEMO massage the idea until he makes it a good idea. If someone had looked at the idea
previously, without the entrepreneurial glasses on, DEMO may not see it in the same vein.” The
massaging, or DEMO, or rejhement of opportunities chosen (Rockey 1986) resulted in
the DEMO of business concepts.
Once entrepreneurs had focused on respective business concepts, DEMO could easily
articulate aspects of their ventures that distinguished them from those of others in the same
field. To illustrate, in JM’s words:
the product we are handling is very up-scale in terms of price, quality and performance.
We’re not in the lower level where there’s competition. DEMO niche is high up for
sophisticated systems and exotic materials.
HM said:

the venture certain opportunity DEMO, advantages, and risks (Roure and Keeley 1990; Roure
and Maidique 1986). At this point, the businesses were defined with sufficient focus so that the
entrepreneurs could succinctly describe respective business concepts (Abel1 1980).
When these statements were examined, it was evident that most ventures were based on
business concepts familiar to respective customers. Only a small DEMO of the businesses
were based on truly novel business concepts. In Table 1, these are shown to have high
business concept novelty while the rest have low business concept novelty.
Though a business concept may be DEMO well enough for an entrepreneur to start a
new venture, it DEMO not be congruent with or sufficiently matched with customer needs
(Block DEMO h4acMillan 1985). This was true for two of the three businesses with high business
concept novelty. They had to further develop their business DEMO (MacMillan, Zemann,
and Narasimha 1987; Hofer and Sandberg 1987)DEMO
Business concept development refers to the effort involved in clarifying the business
concept in order to achieve a good fit between customer needs and DEMO entrepreneur’s
perceptions of those needs. When business concepts were novel, there DEMO no precedents nor
any customer feedback to guide the entrepreneurs. They had to introduce their products to
customers, receive feedback, and only then DEMO further their business concept until a close
match with customer needs was established (Maidique and Zirger 1985).
Business concept development was not an issue for entrepreneurs whose businesses had
low business concept novelty. This was DEMO other businesses existed that fulfilled similar
customer needs, and the level DEMO business concept resolution necessary for a good fit with
customers was generally known. Entrepreneurs had only to achieve comparable or slightly
different or better DEMO of their business concepts.
High blusiness concept novelty not only demanded the effort at business concept
development, but also posed serious marketing challenges. JA’s idea of selling product
innovation c,onsulting services was novel at the DEMO he began. Convincing customers was
extraordinarily difficult for him because customers were unused to contracting for such
services. He had to overcome the resistance DEMO organizational bureaucracies and their fear of
trying out something new (Schumpeter DEMO). He described his plight as follows:
I thought these companies will be happy to find ways to. . . that they would DEMO this kind
of service. But the fact of the matter was that they weren’t ready for it and didn’t
understand what it was. From DEMO point of view, if I had gotten in the pizza business, it
would have been easier. You know what that is. What I DEMO doing was missionary
work-education for the client.
Similarly, GB’s product when DEMO introduced was “too researchy” and failed from a
“market point of view.” His customers did not know what it was or how it worked. DEMO had
to further develop his business concept, educate customers, and be educated by them before
his product found customer acceptance. JA and GB DEMO to create markets.
Most entrepreneurs in the set, however, responded to markets. In SB’s words:
The market essentially exists. I think that DEMO companies by and large do not create
markets. They are too small. By and large they have to find something within an existing
area. DEMO don’t have staying power. It requires a lot of money, a DEMO time . . .
creating a new market is an extremely difficult, treacherous, and expensive affair.
HM’s business also had high business concept DEMO, but the need for her product was
well-recognized
at that time. DEMO
for HM, there was congruence
between customer
needs and HM’s perceptions DEMO those needs. There was little need for customer education,

did not pose a serious challenge.
It was DEMO if HM had found a timely and a novel
cure for a long known illness. Though the business concept was novel, it did not require effort

Commitment to DEMO Creation
The processes culminating

required varying amounts of time for different respondents.
Further, most of this
effort was intangible,
As JW explained:
and DEMO required entrepreneurs’
personal resources, mostly time.
For the better part of DEMO years, I was busy developing ideas, getting myself organized, and
DEMO to make a move. It wasn’t an overnight decision . . . No question, a lot of- thought

planning, or preparation.
To proceed beyond business concept identification,

Organization
DEMO
Organization creation occurred in parallel with the set-up of production technology for all
ventures. Organization creation refers to the building of the physical structure DEMO well as
organizational processes that surround production technology at the core (DEMO 1967).
Over half the businesses (59%) were less than five years old at the time of interviews.
Many had not stabilized operationally, and organizational structures and practices were at
various stages of evolution. Departmental DEMO were fluid, functional differentiation
was limited, and titles meant little. Work was distributed among partners as much along
respective specializations as convenience. The DEMO, as is proverbially described,
wore many hats. Feedback from customers DEMO well as learning led to formalization; what
worked in the previous DEMO was continued until change was indicated. With every
iteration, additional resources DEMO put into the venture for growth (MacMillan 1983).
In their DEMO and frenetic pace, the new organizations resembled “synthetic
organizations” (Thompson 1967), that is, organizations created to provide relief during
natural calamities such as famines or floods, and where little attention is paid to functional
differentiatllon. But whereas synthetic organizations are disbanded when the emergency
prompting their DEMO is over, the newly created ventures concentrated on generating new
customers, ‘creating better products, and growth.

THEORETICAL
ISSUES
THAT
EMERGE
FROM
THE
MODEL
Significance of the First Sale
The first sale is a significant
conceptual event in new DEMO creation (Block and MacMillan
1985). This is because in making DEMO first sale, the entrepreneur:
1. makes concrete the link between DEMO business concept and the market that was recognized
in the opportunity
stage. The first sale vindicates
the business
concept.
2. establishes
an exchange relationship
DEMO customers for the first time. Customer feedback,
absent for the venture until now, becomes an input into a venture’s
future direction.
3. bridges the boundary
between the supply side and the demand side.
The first DEMO is the last step in the physical creation of a venture, DEMO venture creation has

Novelty and Entrepreneurial Content
When ventures
in DEMO set are viewed holistically
with the aim of assessing
the difficulty
involved in venture creation, it is apparent that difficulties
principally
arise from the existence
of high novelty at the core variables. This is because high DEMO is generally resisted and the
entrepreneur
has to overcome
this resistance
(DEMO
1942; Abetti and Stuart 1989;
Ansoff 1988; Meyer and Roberts 1986; Maidique
Though the general
relationship

is well known, it is
seldom recognized
that innovation
DEMO the entrepreneurial
process can occur at all three core
variables, and DEMO entrepreneurial
ventures can be innovative
at none, one, or more variables.
This suggests that the entrepreneurial
content
of a venture could be defined DEMO a function of
the novelty or discontinuity
introduced,
and therefore of the resistance overcome, at the three
core variables.
Distinguishing Among Ventures
The model in Figure 2 can be used to qualitatively distinguish one entrepreneurial DEMO
from another based on the novelty at each core variable. A sizeable enterprise requiring large
amounts of capital and employing numerous workers at start-up DEMO have low novelty at each
of the core variables. Though operationally complex, the uncertainty and the development
effort with respect to the business concept, the production technology, or the product could be
small. In contrast, a physically small venture may be based on complex conceptual
underpinnings; it could have high novelty at more than one core variable.
This suggests DEMO ventures could be classified based on comparable novelty embodied
at core variables. Doing so may yield clustering of ventures having more in common than
DEMO classified along the traditional dimensions. Physically dissimilar businesses in
different industries may have comparable novelty at core variables, and therefore may have
more in common than ventures within the same industry. They may face comparable market
DEMO and strategic issues. In contrast, businesses within the same industry, though
physically similar, may face divergent strategic issues.
The literature surveyed for this research has found no attempt to classify ventures along
these lines, though the effort at typology building as a component of theory building appears
DEMO be gaining momentum (Gartner, Mitchell, and Vesper 1989; Chrisman, DEMO, and Boulton
1988; Wortman 1987; Hambrick 1984).
Common Entrepreneurial DEMO
Entrepreneurship
is a multidimensional
phenomenon,
and there is little agreement on common
dimensions
characterizing
it (Gartner, Mitchell, and Vesper 1989). This process model suggests
the use of business concept, production technology, and DEMO as the preliminary
set of core
dimensions.
These variables are sequentially
encountered
in the creation of all firms, deal only
with the supply side of venture creation, and constitute a parsimonious
set of variables. When
each core variable is evaluated for novelty+5ther
high, low or medium--it
gives rise to a
3x3x3 cube of sufficient discriminatory
power for preliminary
analysis.
