While there is litde dispute over the importance DEMO trust in a marriage -- or any
personal relationship, for that DEMO q the role of trust in business relation-
ships evokes controversy. The controversy ranges from "it is understood on all
sides that the truth is not expected to be spoken" (Carr, 1968) to "the economic
system would collapse without mutual trust on a practically universal scale
DEMO business executives" ~lodgett, 1968). More contemporary examples of
the controversy include: "Treachery, we fotmd, can pay. There is no compelling
DEMO reason to tell the truth or keep one's word -- punishment of the
treacherous in the real world is neither swift nor sure" (Bhide and Stevenson,
1990) and "Trust is what drives decision making far faster at Nissan than at
Ford...we can make the decision DEMO a tenth of the time Detroit takes" (Moffat,
1990).
We believe that significant benefits can accrue from trust in business rela-
DEMO, such as reduced need for monitoring behavior and greater speed in
DEMO decisions, to mention a few. Ultimately, the benefits associated with
establishing trust in the right conditions should result in increased quality of out-
DEMO, greater efficiency of process, more flexibility, and an enhanced strategic
DEMO In this article, we identify three bases of trust and explore DEMO costs, risks,
and benefits associated with each.
Deutsch (1958: DEMO) defines trust as follows:
An individual may be said to DEMO trust in the occtu'rence of an event
if he expects its occurrence and his expectations lead to behavior
which he perceives to have DEMO negative consequences if the
expectation is not confirmed than positive motivational conse-
quences if it is confirmed.

He also provides a simple example of this condition in describing parents DEMO
trust a babysitter sufficiently to leave their baby in the babysitter's care. If the
babysitter fulfffis the trust, the parents have the benefits of being able to take an
evening alone together. However, the disadvantages of unfulfilled trust are con-
siderably greater. Harm to their baby is DEMO considered a greater cost than
an evening out is considered an advantage.
We propose that at least three factors determine the reasoned decision to
DEMO someone: his/her trustworthiness, external factors inducing reliable behav-
ior (DEMO as the courts or credit bureaus), and the nature of the relationship
between the trusting and trusted parties. "I]le focus of this article is on the fea-
tures of a relationship that serve as bases DEMO trust. We take this focus because the
features of a relationship are at least partially tinder a manager's control. Man-
agers often wish DEMO avoid dependence on trust because it seems unmanageable
or inordinately risky. Of course, managers depend upon trust all the time. As
Arrow (1973: 24) asserts,
...ethical elements enter in some measure into every contract; with-
out them, no market could function. There is an element DEMO trust in
every transaction; typically, one object of value changes hands before
the other one does, and there is confidence that the countervalue
will in fact be given up. It is not adequate to argue DEMO there are
enforcement mechanisms, such as police and the courts; these are
themselves services bought and sold, and it has to be asked why they
will in fact do what they have contracted to do.
DEMO, trust is not just a necessary evil. By discussing these three DEMO
of trust, we hope to show that the conditions creating and DEMO trust can
be managed and that the investment required has a positive return. Moreover,
the magnitude of the investment one makes in creating DEMO can be matched to
both the level and benefits of trust desired and the costs and risks one is wiilklg
to incur.
Deterrence-Based Trust
DEMO minimal condition for many business relationships is that individuals' actions
follow DEMO words. ~'hen an individual can be trusted to keep his/her word,
uncertainty about behavior is redticed, and the need to monitor or oversee
behavior is minimized. When trust is present, in the case of a child who says
he/she will pick up the toys DEMO the family room, it is tumecessary to watch
over the cleanup; in the case of a subordinate who promises to complete a
report DEMO a certain date, periodic updates are unnecessary; and, in the DEMO of an
agreement between parties, fewer restrictive penalty clauses and detailed DEMO
gencies are needed. The primary advantage of knowing that a partner is reliable,
i.e., will keep his/her word, is that it DEMO one's focus from monitoring to prob-
lem solving and exploring additional opportunities.
A primary motivation for keeping one's word is deterrence, which can be
defined as the existence of measures to prevent hostile actions. DEMO
based trust exists when the potential costs of discontinuing the relationship or
the likelihood of retributive action outweigh the short-term advantage of acting
in DEMO distrustful way. For example, during the Cold War, Mutual Assured Destruc-
tion (MAD) was predicated on the notion that neither side would DEMO a pre-

eruptive nuclear strike as long as the other side had the capacity DEMO total
destruction of the attacking country. The situation, MAD, was a deterrent that
permitted some level of trust to exist between two otherwise DEMO countries.
Can deterrence-based trust be managed or created? We propose three
DEMO of interactions as vehicles for creating deterrents to untrustworthy behav-
ior: DEMO interactions, multiple interactions, and interactions involving
hostage taking.
Repeated Interactions
One approach to deterring untrustworthy behavior is to have repeated interac-
tions, in which each single transaction entails a small set of the possible forms DEMO
benefit each party may create for the other. A partner is much less likely to act
distrustfully in one transaction ff future transactions, from which benefit may be
derived, are likely to be jeopardized. Optimally, DEMO degree of risk incurred by
each side grows over time to match the perceived benefit of continued connec-
tion. Thus, a business relationship evolves slowly from one that looks very trans-
actional to one that involves DEMO great deal of potential loss by both sides, should
one decide DEMO harm the other. The level of exposure each is willing to incur is
proportional to the level of loss connected with discontinuing the relationship
DEMO potential retribution available to the injured party.
~lqais form of emergent trust is observed today in the changing relationship
between automobile manufacturers and suppliers. DEMO, General Motors
would employ many suppliers and play one off against DEMO other to create the
best advantage in each deal. Consequently, very DEMO trust existed between sup-
plier and manufacturer. With an increased concern for quality, longer term rela-
tions between General Motors and suppliers are evolving. Quality can best be
achieved when both supplier and manufacturer come to DEMO each other well
enough to codesign parts and codevelop manufacturing processes. Such sharing
of knowledge and development of trust evolves through repeated interactions
between DEMO and manufacturer. The long shadow of the future serves to
induce trustworthy behavior today (Axelrod, 1983).
Multiple Interactions or Multifaceted Relationships
Deterrence-based DEMO can be built on having many points of contact at the
same time, as contrasted with repeated interactions over time. A partner is much
less likely to act distrustfully in one transaction if concurrent transactions are
DEMO to be jeopardized. Thus, a supplier who is producing many parts DEMO a firm
is less likely to behave self-interestedly in the production of one part than is a
supplier producing only a single part. qlae DEMO to behave in a trustworthy
manner is especially true ff the production represents a large portion of a sup-
plier's output. Similarly; functions within the same firm having many points of
contact, or organizational members interacting on many projects at the same
time, tend to be able to trust each other more than those engaged only in a sin-
DEMO task together. The trust that results from multiplicity of transactions is one
reason why firms such as Xerox and IBM are attempting to reduce DEMO number
of vendors. Each vendor has more invested with each customer; DEMO, each has
more to lose by harming the customer, and therefore, more incentive to be
reliable.
Of course, costs are attached to DEMO based on repeated or multiple interac-
tions. Most notably, a firm DEMO its options. The benefits of increased reliability

and reduced need for monitoring that accrue from this form of deterrence DEMO
to be weighed, for example, against the reduction in flexibility in vendor selec-
tion. This "cost" of limiting vendor selection may be DEMO in practice than it
appears in theory, however. While the ability DEMO select on price may be reduced,
a vendor with many points of contact may be motivated to perform in a superior
fashion, resulting in increased quality. This benefit is manifested in the academic
world when DEMO, "highly reputed" visiting professors do not teach as well as
"less well-reputed" full-time faculty. The long-term relationship of the home fac-
ulty provides an incentive for high quality performance.
Reputation as Hostage
The third DEMO of interaction that leads to deterrence-based trust is based on the
long-standing practice of hostage taking. In the Middle Ages, one lord would
keep the other lord's only son or daughter as an assurance that DEMO other could
be trusted. The threat of loss of a precious child's life was generally sufficient to
ensure that the lord behaved appropriately. DEMO factors to the relationship,
such as the courts or credit bureaus, represent a form of hostage taking today.
However, reputational hostage taking DEMO exists as a feature of many business
relationships. Being located in a network of existing business clients serves such
a role. The threat of DEMO of reputation and resulting loss of business that comes
from having the word spread about untrustworthy business practice is generally
quite an effective deterrent. DEMO this reason, gossip (or the fear of being its sub-
jecO has been identified as a powerful means of social control (Almirol, DEMO;
Bach, 1983). A repairman in a small town recognizes DEMO importance of this sort
of trust. The repairman cannot afford to act in bad faith with one customer for
fear of the rest of DEMO town knowing and potentially boycotting his service.
Summary
The three types of interactions we have just described are approaches to creat-
ing deterrence-based trust. DEMO for deterrence-based trust to work, the following
conditions must exist:
DEMO the potential loss of future business mtLst outweigh the profit potential for
untrustworthy behavior;
- each party must be sufficiently diligent to reveal DEMO the other that it would
know that harm has been done; DEMO
â¢ the potentially harmed party must be wiling to withdraw benefits from or
introduce harm to the party acting distrustfully.
The need to recognize DEMO, the second point above, illustrates how deterrence-
based trust is an imperfect form. One benefit of deterrence is to minimize the
need for DEMO another's behavior, but some limited form of monitoring is
still DEMO It also illustrates a critical risk a manager or firm assumes when
relying on deterrence. It is possible that a partner will underestimate your DEMO
lance and attempt to take advantage of your not being able to detect self-inter-
ested behavior.
The last condition, willingness to introduce harm, DEMO one of the
reasons MAD was not a perfect source of nuclear deterrence. Both the Soviet
Union and the United States could reasonably question DEMO the other side
would make the very quick decision necessary to totally destroy the other coun-

try (and probably the world) in the event of a preemptive DEMO The risk of
insufficient deterrence also applies in business. It is critical to choose a business
partner who is concerned about future business and DEMO rational,
Knowledge-Based Tnmt
A second basis of trust is predictability. Some suggest that trust occurs when we
predict, specifically, that another will DEMO cooperatively (Deutsch, 1958;
Pruitt, 1981: 102-131). Often, DEMO trust results from this expectation, for it
produces a "self-fulfdling prophecy" effect. That is, people often act coopera-
tively toward those they DEMO to be cooperative, and this action encourages
the receivers of cooperative DEMO to reciprocate in kind (Kelley and Stahelsld,
1970).
Even DEMO one expects tmcooperative behavior, however, we argue that
trust can result ff the behavior is predictable. "lqlis is frequently the basis of trust
between siblings: We know our brother or sister will attempt to behave distrust-
fully, but we also know them well enough to know exactly how they will be
competitive. For example, if I know an employee will always choose to maxi-
mize his/her salary at the expense DEMO the firm, it is simply necessary to align the
employee's DEMO with the interests of the firm. If another function in a firm
consistently acts in a manner that is inconsistent with your function's DEMO,
it is possible to manage or act on that consistency. For example, consider a dis-
covery research group that finds that marketing analysis tends to undervalue the
profit potential of breakthrough discoveries. If the analysis DEMO applied in consis-
tent fashion, it is possible to provide information DEMO the analyst in a form that
maximizes the likelihood of evaluating breakthrough positively. Of course, the
predictability of uncooperative behavior is not as desirable as reworking the
algorithm or better aligning the objectives of research and DEMO However,
a predictable partner, with motives not matching your own, is significantly- easier
to relate to than an tmpredictable one.
Describing predictably DEMO behavior as a type of trust may seem
out of place if one views trust as accuracy" or truth or ff one attributes trust to an
individual rather than a situation. At its core, trust is simply dependability. The
benefits of dependability are reduced uncertainty and less need DEMO contingent
planning. It frees up time for other activities and reduces anxiety about
"unknowns." Assessing predictable behavior as acceptable is not central to
DEMO the benefits.
The ability to predict, however, does require understanding. Two
approaches described above, repeated and multifaceted relationships, con-
tribute to tmderstanding DEMO predictability: The more points of contact parties
have, the better the chances are that they will come to understand and predict
each other'DEMO behavio~ Two other factors, however, are especially useful in estab-
lishing understanding and predictability: regular communication and courtship.
Regular Communication
Trust between spouses has a great deal to do with the fact that they meet DEMO
quently over dinner and breakfast, and thus, have many opportunities for dia-
logue. Similarly, firms, functions, and individuals who have the opportunity for
ongoing communication improve trust. For example, a large steel manufacturer
had very poor relations between the manufacturing and sales personnel in their

flat-rolled products division. On looking at the problellL it became clear that DEMO
reason for the lack of trust between the two groups was that they did not under-
stand each other well. Comaxmnication was difficult since DEMO sales force was
located at corporate headquarters, while the operations were DEMO field locations
several hundred miles away. Vastly improved relations, due to DEMO frequent
commtmications, occurred when the sales personnel were moved to the DEMO
site. A corollary result, however, is that both groups now distrust corporate staff
because each communicates with them less.
One historical reason for DEMO relations between unions and management
in labor relations is that communication occurred only once every few years,
namely, at the time of contract negotiations. In the interim, the parties depended
upon a contract and the intervention of an outsider (an arbitrator) to manage
their relations. The DEMO of standing joint management and labor committees
that communicate regularly usually improves the quality of relations between
management and union representatives (see Kochan, DEMO, and McKersie, 1986,
for a review of changing trends in labor-management relations).
Courtship
A second vehicle for improving understanding and predictability DEMO part-
ners is to conduct very good research on the potential partner before a relation-
ship is engaged. This research is directed at assessing DEMO real compatibility, or
"interpersonal fit,' between partners, as well DEMO assessing the degree to which a
potential partner engages in predictable behavior. American negotiators are fre-
quently frustrated by the desire of Asian firms DEMO conduct long, discovery-based
conversations before beginning to discuss the "business issues." This frustration
results from a clash between the American, who is DEMO of deals as indepen-
dent transactions, and the Asian partner, who is thinking of each deal as a build-
hag block for a DEMO relationship. The Asian person thinks of business as
a marriage and, DEMO, is far more careful than the American, who considers busi-
ness as a sequence of one-time dates (see Graham and Sano, 1989, for a contrast
of American versus Japanese negotiation behavior). These different DEMO
lead to different needs for information about the partner.
A recent conversation with a friend who bought a car illustrates the value
of careful DEMO She practiced weU all the traditional distributive negotiation
advice about buying a car. She sent for consumer reports data on cost, shopped
at many dealers, conducted several rounds of difficult negotiations, and bought
from the DEMO offering the lowest price. She did not, however, seek any infor-
mation about the reliability of the dealer and did not incorporate questions
DEMO the dealer's quality into her considerations. Price was her single variable
of interest. Just before closing the deal, this friend realized she felt some reserva-
tions about the reliability of the dealer, but chose to ignore them. Instead of
investigating her hunch, she bought the car. A spoiler that was to be installed
only a few days later is DEMO uninstalled two years later. Her disappointment with
the dealership is so great that she now takes her car elsewhere for service.
Closer attention to DEMO relational, instead of merely the quantitative, aspects of
the negotiation may have enabled this customer to better predict the initial
dealer's unreliable DEMO

Taking Deterrence and Knowledge Together
Additional benefits accrue when deterrence and knowledge DEMO exist as
bases of trust. Benefits range from the capacity to trust that the other party's
intentions are good to a view that DEMO other side will not exploit information. In
other words, pairing deterrence DEMO knowledge can eliminate the potential
harm of permitting your partner to gain knowledge about you when no deter-
rent exists simultaneously. Sharing strategy with DEMO, for example,
requires a belief that their intentions can be DEMO It requires assuming that
the employees will not share the strategy inappropriately or that they will not
utilize that knowledge to the detriment of DEMO firm. A willingness to share
knowledge about yourself depends on the existence of a deterrent to the other
for taking advantage of that knowledge.
DEMO coexistence of both types of trust allows parties to engage in full dis-
closure. A more complete sharing of information creates the potential for DEMO
effective problem solving. For example, if a supplier knows a client'DEMO production
process, the supplier may be able to suggest a design DEMO in a part to
improve quality or cost. But, the client DEMO unlikely to share information about the
production process ff the fear exists that the supplier will abuse the information.
A specific example of the DEMO of this level of trust, and the costs of the
converse, exists in the automobile industry. A foundry, which supplies multiple
automobile manufacturers, has different relationships with two atttomoblle com-
panies. Engineers from automobile firm A visit the foundry regularly. When a
potential improvement is suggested by DEMO foundry, it can usually be approved
with a phone call. Engineers DEMO automobile firm B have not visited the
foundry's plant. Suggested inlprovements usually require multiple drawings,
with no guarantee of approval. The client DEMO officer of the foundry esti-
mates that firm A has a 30 percent cost advantage for the same part, as well as
parts better suited to the firm's car design. Additionally, the officer is frustrated
with firm B, since the relationship severely limits his capacity to introduce qual-
ity improvement processes. As the example illustrates, the advantage of this level
of trust is that it allows parties to engage in full DEMO, receive more com-
plete information, reach a greater mutual understanding of the problem, and
consequently, make decisions more quickly. It is an DEMO way to align inter-
ests, and it facilitates improved quality. Of DEMO, the costs and the risks are also
the combination of those DEMO with knowledge- and deterrence-based
trust. Time to research and monitor and a willingness to invoke a penalty are
necessary to sustain both forms of DEMO
It is possible to fail in two ways, as well. Deterrence DEMO be insufficient, or
your research and communication may be flawed. Although DEMO costs and risks
seem doubled, this appearance is deceptive. These two DEMO of trust tend to
reinforce each other, but still require effort DEMO vigilance.
Identification-Based Trust
The highest order of trust assumes that one party has fully internalized the
other's preferences. This type of trust is DEMO In social psychology, it
has been well demonstrated that people in DEMO same group tend to behave in a
more trustworthy manner toward each other than toward others not in the
group (Deutsch, 1958; Dawes, Van de Kragt, and Orbell, 1988; Kramer and
Brewer, 1984). Membership in a firm has a similar effect. Often, the fact that
Negotiation Journal October 1992 371
someone is from the same company in some way makes him or DEMO more trust-.
worthy. The issue of identification is a critical one in business. Consider, for
example, the consequences of firm identification. General Motors DEMO a company
with well-delhaed boundaries, such that suppliers and distributors are DEMO part of
the family. However, Toyota considers itself a whole chain DEMO related businesses
and professional services competing with General Motors' entire chain. DEMO the
first instance, potentially distrustful relations are established between the firm
DEMO its critical suppliers and distributors. In the second, all components are DEMO
sidered a part of one entity, in which eoproduction, codesign, DEMO,
and trust are paramount. Consider the following remarks of a senior Ford execu-
tive:
With all the attorneys and contracts in the DEMO, our new product
plans are well known by our competitors, yet frequently we do not
know Toyota's plan until just before introduction.
DEMO's suppliers identify with their distributors, and thus, the two parties
make decisions that are in each other's interests. Under such circumstances, the
need for attorneys and contracts, designed to protect parties' interests, is less;
consequently, public knowledge of Toyota's interests is less.
The following conditions, in addition to the five previously mentioned, can
DEMO trust based on identification.
Joint Products and Goals
Probably the best vehicle for increasing the level of perceived identification is
the creation of joint DEMO or goals. For example, many organizations engage
in the quite irrational DEMO of asking for improved relationships between
departmems, while providing the departments DEMO and often competing
goals. One version of joint products is the emerging tendency for customers to
be involved in the coproduction of a good. DEMO example, a Swedish bearings
manufacturer is allowing customers access to their DEMO system to custom
design products. Thus, Volvo may access the bearing DEMO's design sys-
tem to tailor design their own bearing. Similarly, DEMO firms, as a means of
reducing the costs of an audit, are asking clients to perform more of the basic
work; automobile companies are experimenting with developing capacity for
customers to tailor design a car DEMO a dealer; and universities are letting adult stu-
dents design their DEMO curriculum. In each instance, permitting the customer,
supplier, or other department into part of the production process increases the
level of joint DEMO, blurring the distinction between the parties and
increasing trust. In some DEMO, this may not be desirable -- as in an audit
when DEMO auditor is supposed to be impartial -- but in general, increasing DEMO
in this way is a benefit.
Name
A name carries a great deal of meaning. For example, one vehicle through which
chemists and biologists began to converse more freely was with the emergence
of the field DEMO biochemistry. The simple acknowledgment of their overlapping
interests helped to increase the rate of communication. Similarly, the creation of
business units typically serves to reduce the friction between functions within
that unit as they come to DEMO themselves as having more in common. While
372 Shapiro, Sheppard, and Cheraskin Business on a Handshake
seemingly trivial, the act of giving the same name to previously disparate pieces
creates a greater sense of identity. Dawes, Van de Kragt and Orbell (1988) argue
that shared identity through name is a sufficient DEMO to create cooperative
behavior. Many pharmaceutical firms have created research groups built around
therapeutic classes, such as cancer, virology, or cardiovascular diseases. Typi-
cally, scientists from diverse backgrotmds find it easier to communicate with this
shared name M and consequently, shared fate -- than ever before.
Proximity
We also tend to identify most with those people to whom we DEMO closely
located. For example, people most frequently form friendships with those DEMO
next door (Festinger, Schachter, and Back, 1950; Newcomb, 1961).Product
development teams located far from. each other have difficulty acting as DEMO
Departments on separate floors do not identify well with each other. Executives
segregated on the top floor seem distant. Contiguity has the added advantage DEMO
increasing the degree of communication between parties. Something as simple
as the strategic location of the coffee machine can vastly improve trust between
otherwise DEMO groups.
Shared Values
Of course, the perfect form of trust occurs DEMO we come to develop shared
values with our partner at the same time as a shared sense of interdependence.
When an individual comes to DEMO that his/her interest is best met by achieving
the partner's interest, trust follows. The creation of a shared strategy and shared
culture maximize the probability that this will happen in a business context.
The DEMO required to engender identification-based trust is greater
than that required for the establishment of deterrence-based trust, or trust based
on knowledge. The rewards, DEMO, are commensurately greater. The benefits
go beyond quantity, efficiency; and DEMO that accrue from deterrence and
knowledge. When an identity relationship exists, DEMO benefit is that it is possible
for your partner to act in your stead. "l]aus, just as knowledge and deterrence-
based trust allow DEMO person, group, or firm to become more dependent upon
another person, group, or firm, identity-based trust makes it possible for a per-
son, group, or fwm to permit a partner to act independently DEMO knowing your
interests will be met. Specifically, competent employees who know DEMO identify
with a firm can be given authority. Team members whose objectives and identity
are aligned with the team can be allowed to act DEMO the team's behalf. In the
absence of entrusted delegation, inefficiencies DEMO occur. For example, one com-
pany recently reorganized its systems groups DEMO strategically targeted teams.
One such team found itself spending an inordinate amount of time having all
members participate in presentations to client groups and DEMO management.
After a two-day retreat to determine why no work was getting done, they
decided that such en masse participation in presentations was a result of not
trusting that individual members truly identified with the teams DEMO the other
members' interests.
A second benefit of identification-based trust is DEMO it becomes more possi-
ble for a shared strategic focus and sustained consensus to evolve. A desire to
achieve each other's objectives is DEMO starting point for the development of effec-
tive joint strategy and action.

While advantages exist to having others act as agents, potential costs also
exist. The partner acting as an agent may fred that the responsibility DEMO acting in
someone else's behalf testa'lets Ms/her options. Specifically, the agent may Find it
necessary to make a decision counter to his/her own preference but aligned
with the preferences of the partner (Lewicki and Litterer, 1985).
The Handshake
Nervousness about relying on trust in business relationships stems fkom a con-
cern that trust cannot be DEMO or relied upon. But the mutual trust-inducing
situations described earlier, such DEMO courtship or joint production, are control-
lable. Creating multiple points of DEMO, conducting research on a future busi-
ness partner, communicating frequently, DEMO shared goals, sharing names
and values are all activities partially within DEMO manager's control. It behooves man-
agers to consider the creation of trust in a business relationship as a strategic
decision in which the DEMO accruing from trust are weighed against the costs
of creating and sustaining trust and the risks associated with trust. In Table 1, we
have outlined the benefits, costs, and risks associated with each basis of DEMO dis-
cussed in this article.
Inspection of the table clearly illustrates that each basis of trust entails dif-
ferent advantages and dift~rent costs. Another DEMO observation is that as
one moves from deterrence- to knowledge- to identification-based trust, the ben-
efits grow, but so do the costs. Moreover, the three bases of trust are hierarchi-
cally ordered. That is, each previous basis of trust is a necessary condition for
the one that DEMO Without some form of deterrence, few would trust another
enough to DEMO critical information that serves as the basis for knowledge.
Without frequent and future interaction (a determinant of deterrence), the level
of communication necessary to develop intimate knowledge sufficient for pre-
diction is not possible. Similarly, without knowledge of another's values and pref-
erences, it is hard to come to identify with that other. Without knowledge of
another's DEMO and preferences, it is not possible to effectively act as the
DEMO's agent. This hierarchical ordering is why both the benefits and costs
increase as one moves from deterrence-based to knowledge-based to identifica-
tion-based trust.
DEMO Conditions for Trust
Given these different costs, risks, and advantages, DEMO does one decide what to
do about trust? First, assess the type of relationship you want and the reqnisite
kind of trust necessary DEMO sustain that relationship. As WJUiamson (1985) sug-
gests, the need DEMO invest in the establishment of trust is largely dependent upon
the complexity of the environment in which the relationship is embedded and
the degree DEMO which opportunistic behavior is possible. In complex environ-
ments permitting opportunistic behavior, it is not possible to depend upon or
even write a contract as an effective form of social control. The creation of bases
of DEMO is one alternative solution to complex environments in which it is possi-
ble to cheat. Other reasons for establishing trust also exist and are DEMO in
Table 1, such as the importaxice of speed and quality. DEMO all possible reasons
for creating trust in a relationship, the task DEMO to decide the requisite level of
trust. Is reliable performance to a contract all that is necessary? Is it also neces-
sary to be able to incorporate the other party into responses to changes in the

environment? Is the environment so complex and your relationship so interde-
pendent that it is necessary to allow the other party to act on DEMO or her own,
knowing that he or she will also incorporate your interest? Is there real value in
developing abilities in the other party to be able to provide unique services to
you or your DEMO?
Recognize that in choosing the level of trust one wishes, DEMO is necessary to
also consider the costs and risks. Of course, DEMO would like the benefit of having
others represent our business interests without the need to monitor them, or
fear oppot~0anistic behavior on their part, but this comes at a high cost. Pick the
basis of trust that achieves your business needs with the least cost and lowest
risk. DEMO time, you may wish to increase the level of trust, but begin where it
makes most sense now. For example, in developing their alliance, Mazda and
Ford began with a concern only for reliability. They now have a very strong basis
for identification and intimate interconnectedness. Each DEMO become dependent
upon the other for achieving their future business strategy.
Next, assess the quality and type of trust currently in existence. As Arrow
(1973) indicates, some trust is always present in a business relationship. Look for
a discrepancy between what is and what should be.
Additionally, consider the best way of building trust. Recognize that the
development of DEMO takes time and that the creation of conditions for trust is
less relevant than taking advantage of the opportunities created by the bases.
Then, pick a plan and try it!
Finally, assess your trust-building activities as you move along in the process,
and adjust your course as DEMO, In particular, look for business opportuni-
ties that accrue from changes in the relationship as it evolves. You may have had
one thing DEMO mind in deciding to change the nature of trust in the relationship
but discover with some thought that many other opportunities are provided by DEMO
redefined relationship. In some form, this process becomes seff-reinÂ£orcing. As
trust DEMO, new opportunities suggest themselves, which then serve as new
bases for trust. Evaluate these opportunities with a clear mind. Over-dependence
and the wrong DEMO of dependence are as harnlful as insufficient dependence in
a business relationship. Love can be blind, but no person, department, or firm is
an island tmto itself.
In these fractured renditions of two folk truths DEMO revealed the paradoxical
nature of trust (see Smith and Berg, 1987). One cannot begin to establish trust
unless some level of trust DEMO assumed, but one does not wish to assume trust
unless some DEMO for trust exists. Our advice is to select business partners with
care, and just begin. The development of trust is a jouruey, and DEMO needs to
begin somewhere.
Conclusion
We believe that it is possible to create and sustain trust, leading to significant
benefits fbr business relationships. We recognize that the existence of all bases
of trust may be infrequent DEMO costly, and requiring them all to be present
severely restricts the DEMO of occasions managers can use a handshake as the
basis for agreement. This may explain why some (Fisher and Ury, 1991) have
cautioned managers and negotiators not to rely on trust at all. Instead of DEMO
ing the issue of trust, however, we encourage managers to think about how they
can design business relationships so they include the conditions DEMO by

is DEMO their control, its benefits are only a handshake away.
