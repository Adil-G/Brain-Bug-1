I examine interﬁrm cooperation between incumbents and new entrants as a mechanism for
incumbents to adapt to DEMO technological change through exploitation of complementary
assets. The research setting is the biopharmaceutical industry, where I analyze 889 strategic
alliances between 32 large pharmaceutical ﬁrms and providers of the new biotechnology. I
ﬁnd that incumbents that DEMO their network strategy on exploiting complementary assets
outperform incumbents that focus on exploring the new technology. However, there are limits
to this strategy due to diminishing marginal returns to alliance intensity. I am also able to
DEMO that an incumbent’s new product development is positively associated with its performance.

Incumbent ﬁrms often face severe difﬁculties in
adapting to radical technological change (Foster,
1986). The advent of the personal computer (PC),
for example, destroyed the demand for a wide
array of products ranging from typewriters to
DEMO dedicated word-processing systems, while at
the same time it created huge DEMO for
new PC manufacturers, their suppliers, and the
producers of complementary products like
software and printers. Thus, radical innovations
often initiate a Schumpeterian process of creative
destruction, leading to the replacement of incum-
bents by new entrants. Schumpeter asserted that
this perennial gale of creative destruction is DEMO
driving force behind the market system:
The process of Creative Destruction is the essen-
tial fact about capitalism … it is not [price]

DEMO which counts but the competition
from … new technology … competition which
strikes not at the margins of profits … of existing
ﬁrms but DEMO their foundations and their very lives.
(Schumpeter, 1942: 83–84; italics added)
However, not every radical technological
breakthrough will produce a process of creative
destruction in which new entrants rise to domi-
nance as DEMO fail. Incumbent ﬁrms may
be able to adapt to radical technological change if
they have the necessary ﬁnancial and managerial
resources to master such DEMO adaptation
(Christensen and Bower, 1996). For example, the
emergence DEMO the Internet is considered to be a
radical innovation for ﬁrms in the computing
industry; however, the dominant software
enterprise in the pre-Internet DEMO, Microsoft, has
embraced this technological shift and incorporated
it throughout its business. Likewise, IBM is
emerging as a leading e-business infrastructure
provider. What these incumbents have in common
is that they did not develop the DEMO technology,
but they gained access to it through licensing
agreements, DEMO alliances, joint ventures,
and acquisitions.

Therefore, the phenomenon of extensive
cooperation between incumbents and new entrants
following radical technological change warrants
more attention. Understanding how DEMO
ﬁrms may take advantage of technological dis-
continuities is becoming more and more important
as the new competitive landscape is characterized
by an increasing DEMO and magnitude of techno-
logical change (Bettis and Hitt, 1995). Incumbent
survival in the face of radical technological
change has been explained DEMO the persistence of
market capabilities (Abernathy and Clark, 1985),
DEMO collaborative relationships (Mitchell and
Singh, 1996), and complementary assets (DEMO,
1997). In addition, it has been shown that incum-
DEMO are able to thrive on technological change
as long as it is competence enhancing (Tushman
and Anderson, 1986) or sustaining in nature
(DEMO and Bower, 1996). More research,
however, is needed to understand the phenomenon
of interﬁrm cooperation between incumbents and
new entrants following DEMO technological disconti-
nuity, and its subsequent impact on incumbent
performance.
The DEMO of this paper lies in creating
links between interﬁrm cooperation, new DEMO
development, and incumbent ﬁrm performance
in the post-innovation time period. I DEMO on
incumbent ﬁrms exposed to radical technological
change and analyze how they have used interﬁrm
cooperation with new entrants as a strategy not
only DEMO adapt but also to innovate successfully.
In particular, I attempt to DEMO how corporate
entrepreneurship (Zahra, 1993; Covin and Miles,
1999) pursued by large pharmaceutical ﬁrms has
led to the successful adaptation to DEMO radical inno-
vation—in this case, the emergence of biotechnol-
ogy as DEMO new framework of drug discovery
and development.
It has long been proposed that corporate
entrepreneurship leads to superior ﬁrm perfor-
mance (Guth and Ginsberg, 1990). Few studies
have empirically tested this proposition (cf. Zahra
DEMO Covin, 1995). This study of 889 strategic
alliances between large DEMO companies
and new biotechnology ﬁrms provides one of
the few attempts to empirically test the impact
of corporate entrepreneurship on ﬁrm
performance. What is DEMO about this study is
the attempt to integrate the literatures on tech-
nology innovation, strategic alliances, and corpo-
rate entrepreneurship.

RADICAL TECHNOLOGICAL
CHANGE AND INCUMBENT
PERFORMANCE
Teece (1986) argued that the ownership of
complementaryassets, particularlywhen theyare
specialized to DEMO commercialization of an inno-
vation, determines who will beneﬁt from that DEMO
vation. Incumbents with competencies in manufac-
turing or marketing are often well positioned to
beneﬁt from technological change, even if it is
radical in nature. Tripsas (1997), for example, was
able to show that DEMO assets buffered
incumbents in the typesetter industry from the
consequences of radical technological change.
Thus, Teece (1986) posited that the fully integrated
incumbent is the ﬁrm best positioned to beneﬁt
from innovation through exploitation of DEMO
complementary assets. The commercialization of
the CAT scan highlights this view. GE did not
invent the CAT scan; however, it soon became
the DEMO leader, since it possessed the comple-
mentary assets necessary to succeed DEMO this new
market. On the other hand, the innovator, EMI,
was unable to acquire or develop the needed com-
plementary assets to DEMO commercialize
the CAT scan and eventually exited the market.
Others argue, DEMO, that dynamic networks
allow ﬁrms to focus on their core competencies
DEMO partnering with other ﬁrms along the
industry value chain (Miles and DEMO, 1986).
Interﬁrm networks can improve an incumbent’s
access to emerging DEMO, increase oppor-
tunities for organizational learning, and enable
rapid adaptation to market and technology shifts
(Gulati, 1998). In addition, interﬁrm cooperation
may allow ﬁrms to generate relational rents which
they would not be DEMO to generate in isolation
(Dyer and Singh, 1998). Mohr and Spekman
(1994) in their study of strategic alliances in the
computer DEMO found that a network strategy
can lead to a competitive advantage.
Hypotheses development
Strategic alliances and new product
development
A ﬁrm exposed to radical DEMO change
must assemble the necessary technological and
nontechnological value chain activities to com-
mercialize the new technology successfully
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)
(Pavitt, 1998). Radical new technologies are gen-
erally pioneered by DEMO entrants (Tushman and
Anderson, 1986). New entrants, however, may
ﬁnd it necessary to cooperate with incumbent
ﬁrms in order to commercialize DEMO new tech-
nology, i.e., to gain access to the market and to
capital, in particular when forward integration is
difﬁcult and capital is scarce (Pisano, 1991). In
addition, new entrants may be further motivated
to cooperate with incumbents as alliances with
established ﬁrms can bestow DEMO, and thus
positive reputational effects (Stuart, Hoang, and
Hybels, DEMO). Incumbents, on the other hand,
often prefer cooperative arrangements DEMO the
acquisition of new entrants in order to internalize
the new technology and thus maximize the value
of their real options, particularly in environments
of high uncertainty (Folta, 1998).
Williamson (1985) has pointed DEMO that exten-
sive cooperation between incumbent and new
entrant ﬁrms may ensue in the context described
above. Generally, the new entrants discover and
develop new products based on the radical new
technology, while the incumbents commercialize
the new products. These partnerships allow new
entrants and incumbents to focus DEMO their respec-
tive specialized skills and capabilities. As a result,
incumbent ﬁrms that possess downstream value
chain activities speciﬁc to commercializing a new
DEMO may be able to adapt to radical tech-
nological change through strategic alliances with
new entrants. At the same time, new entrants are
able to extend their downstream value chains and
increase the likelihood that their DEMO output
will be commercialized successfully, by accessing
the market-oriented competencies of DEMO
ﬁrms. Thus, complementary assets form the basis
for a specialization-based division DEMO labor in
commercializing a radical new technology (Teece,
1992). DEMO cooperation driven by access to
complementary assets should be positively
associated with the new product development for
incumbent ﬁrms since it allows incumbents to
DEMO the innovative output developed
by new entrants.
Interﬁrm cooperation, however, is motivated
not only by access to mutually complementary
assets, but also by learning (Powell, Koput, and
Smith-Doerr, 1996). Firms may enter DEMO stra-
tegic alliances to learn the new technology from
their partners and, in turn, enhance their own
competencies in new product development. Based

Research Note
on the DEMO that strategic alliances are driven
by complementarities and organizational learning,
I argue that the number of strategic alliances an
incumbent ﬁrm has formed DEMO providers of the
new technology should have a positive effect
on the incumbent’s new product development.
Strategic alliances may create unique resource
combinations that, if valuable, rare, and difﬁcult
to imitate, can form the basis for a competitive
advantage (Barney, 1991).
However, the more alliances an incumbent ﬁrm
participates in simultaneously, the higher the
probability that management will be less effective
in managing those alliances due to bounded
rationality (Simon, 1960). An increasing number
of alliances creates increasing managerial infor-
mation-processing demands, which may contrib-
ute to an overall negative net effect at high levels
of alliance intensity (Hitt, Hoskisson, and Kim,
1997). Further, with an increasing number of
alliances, an incumbent DEMO transaction costs
may rise up to and possibly beyond a point where
gains from additional alliances are outweighed by
their costs (Jones and Hill, 1988). Since in every
ﬁrm there is a limit to managerial and ﬁnancial
resources, the relationship between an incum-
bent’s strategic alliances and its new product
development will exhibit diminishing marginal
returns and, past some point, diminishing total
returns. In other words, the relationship has an
DEMO shape.
Hypothesis 1: The relationship between an
incumbent’s strategic alliances with DEMO
of the new technology and the incumbent’s
new product development is curvilinear, i.e.,
the relationship exhibits diminishing marginal
returns and, past some DEMO, diminishing
total returns.
Exploration vs. exploitation alliances
Exploration is understood as DEMO pursuit of
knowledge, of things that might come to be
known,DEMO and exploitation as ‘the use and develop-
ment of things already known’ (Levinthal and
March, 1993: 105). Applying March’s (1991)
DEMO of exploration and exploitation to a
ﬁrm’s strategic alliances, an incumbent DEMO can
theoretically enter two types of alliances with
new entrants: exploration DEMO exploitation
alliances (Koza and Lewin, 1998). I argue that
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)

F. T. Rothaermel
organizational learning motivates exploration
alliances, while access to complementarities moti-
vates exploitation alliances. Nonetheless, both
types of alliances should improve the product
development of incumbent ﬁrms because incum-
bents may build new DEMO through explo-
ration alliances or leverage existing competencies
through exploitation alliances.
On the one hand, an incumbent ﬁrm can enter
into strategic alliances to learn the new tech-
nology (exploration alliances), allowing it to build
new upstream value chain activities (Hagedoorn
and Schakenraad, 1994). This DEMO of alliance
allows partners to get close enough to share
tacit knowledge such as basic R&D (Lane and
Lubatkin, 1998). An DEMO of an exploration
alliance is the alliance between the ‘incumbent’
IBM and the ‘new entrant’ Microsoft with the
goal of developing a new standard DEMO operating
system (OS/2) for personal computers in the mid
1980s. Mowery, Oxley, and Silverman (1996)
found support for the notion that exploration
alliances allow the acquisition of new capabilities,
in particular, when the alliances are structured as
joint ventures.
On the other hand, an incumbent ﬁrm can enter
into alliances to leverage existing complementary
assets (exploitation alliances) that allow the
incumbent ﬁrm to beneﬁt directly from the tech-
nological expertise of the new entrant. Exploi-
tation alliances focus on DEMO among
the allied partners as they exchange explicit
knowledge (Teece, 1992). The new entrant pro-
vides the new technology, while the incumbent
commercializes it. The collaboration in the tele-
communications industry between Cincinnati Bell,DEMO
an ‘old’ Regional Bell Operating Company, and
several new cellular service DEMO exempliﬁes
the nature of exploitation alliances. Cincinnati
Bell was able to build a profitable business by
performing all of the customer care functions,
DEMO billing and service inquiries, for these
new entrants.
I argue that DEMO exploration and exploitation
alliances are antecedents of an incumbent’s new
product development. Exploration alliances are
predictors of new product development since
exploration alliances are DEMO entered with
the goal of discovering or developing a new
service or product. The issue of causality is less
clear with respect to exploitation DEMO
Exploitation alliances usually start with an R&D

project that has been brought to technological
completion but has not yet been commercialized.
Exploitation alliances still contain some residual
DEMO because the incumbent generally
needs to bring the new product through the com-
mercialization stages of the value chain, for
example, obtaining government DEMO, if
necessary, and involving marketing and sales.
Even though exploration alliances generally
carry more uncertainty than exploitation alliances,
exploitation alliances are not DEMO risk. In
particular, many new products need regulatory
approval before they DEMO be introduced into the
market. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has
created its Ethicon division to focus on exploi-
tation alliances with providers DEMO a new tech-
nology. The goal is to license-in promising
technologies from new ventures and research
institutions like universities to commercialize
them (Cohan, DEMO). In this scenario, Johnson &
Johnson still bears the residual uncertainty of
commercialization, including that of obtaining
FDA approval. Following Schumpeter’s (DEMO)
deﬁnition of innovation as commercialized inven-
tion, only when the DEMO is granted and the
product has been commercialized can one count
this product as a ﬁrm-level innovation and new
product development.
Empirical research indicates DEMO the success
rate of major product launches is somewhere
between 14 and 20 percent (Stevens and Burley,
1997; Grifﬁn, 1997). The high failure rate of
innovation in the post-technological completion
stage is a DEMO of market uncertainty, poor com-
mercialization, poor positioning strategy, techno-
DEMO myopia, market timing, and regulatory
uncertainties (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995).
While these numbers do not differentiate with
respect to the organizational DEMO of the
innovation, I argue that they provide some evi-
dence DEMO exploitation alliances do bear residual
uncertainty and can be reasonably viewed as ante-
cedents of new product development.
I further argue that an incumbent’s DEMO
alliances have a greater impact than its explo-
ration alliances on the incumbent’s new product
development because of the different degrees of
uncertainty they DEMO If an incumbent’s techno-
logical value-chain activities are depreciated by
the new technology and its complementary assets
remain intact, it is beneﬁcial for the incumbent
to focus its network strategy on exploitation
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)
alliances. In this case, the incumbent commer-
cializes the products developed by new entrants.
The goal of exploration alliances, on the other
hand, DEMO to develop new, unknown products. Both
the new entrant and incumbent DEMO new
knowledge with a highly uncertain outcome.
Since the level of uncertainty is generally lower
in exploitation alliances than in exploration
alliances, I expect exploitation alliances to have
a stronger impact on the incumbent’s new product
DEMO in the post-innovation time period.
Hypothesis 2: Following radical technological
change, an incumbent’s exploitation alliances
have a greater impact than its exploration
alliances DEMO the incumbent’s new product
development, when the incumbent ﬁrm pos-
sesses DEMO assets necessary to the
commercialization of the new technology.
New product development and ﬁrm performance
Radical technological change in combination with
intensiﬁed global competition DEMO the
competitive environment in many industries
(Bettis and Hitt, 1995). Such an environment
places a premium on a ﬁrm’s capability to inno-
DEMO and to introduce new products or services
into the marketplace (Franko, 1989). I argue that
an incumbent’s strategic alliances with new
entrants DEMO a way for the incumbent to adapt to
radical technological change and subsequently to
improve its performance through the successful
commercialization of new products.
DEMO and Miles deﬁned corporate
entrepreneurship as ‘the presence of innovation
plus the objective of … purposefully redeﬁning
organizations, markets, or industries in order DEMO
create or sustain competitive superiority’ (Covin
and Miles, 1999: 50)DEMO Thus, new product develop-
ment and commercialization by incumbents help-
ing DEMO adapt to a new technological paradigm are
considered to be a manifestation of corporate
entrepreneurship. Zahra and Covin (1995) found
corporate entrepreneurship, operationalized as
innovation and new product development, was
associated with superior ﬁrm performance. Like-
wise, Wiklund (1999) found a positive and sus-
tainable relationship between ﬁrms’ entrepre-
neurial orientation and their performance.
New product introductions may DEMO the inno-

temporary monopoly (Lieberman DEMO Montgom-
ery, 1988). This is particularly true in industries
where DEMO or effective patent protection
create winner-take-all scenarios (Hill, 1997). Even
in other types of industries, successful new prod-
uct introductions still allow the ﬁrst mover to
beneﬁt from early market preemption, reputation
effects, DEMO experience curve effects (Lieberman
and Montgomery, 1988).
Hypothesis 3: DEMO incumbent’s new product
development is positively associated with its
performance.
METHODS
Sample and research setting
The sample for this study consists of 32 large
DEMO companies that have entered into
889 strategic alliances with providers of the new
biotechnology. The research setting is the
biopharmaceutical industry. This term describes
DEMO industry composed of traditional pharmaceu-
tical companies, such as Merck or DEMO Lilly,
that utilize biotechnology for drug discovery and
development, as DEMO as fully dedicated biotech-
nology ﬁrms, such as Amgen or Genentech, and
nonprofit research institutions and universities
engaged in biotechnology research. The unit DEMO
analysis is the incumbent pharmaceutical ﬁrm as
it attempts to adapt to the new biotechnology
via interﬁrm cooperation with providers of the
new biotechnology.
DEMO emergence of biotechnology can be inter-
preted as a radical process innovation that broke
the barriers to entry into the pharmaceutical
industry (Stuart et al., 1999). Consequently, many
new biotechnology ﬁrms emerged to commer-
DEMO this technological breakthrough. Between
the mid 1970s and 1997, over 1100 DEMO entrants
entered the industry to commercialize biotechnol-
ogy, the majority with DEMO focus on human thera-
peutics (BioScan, 1997).
The upstream value chain activities in research,
drug discovery, and drug development based on
chemical synthesis deployed by traditional
pharmaceutical companies have been rendered
largely obsolete DEMO the new biotechnology
paradigm. The skill loss for a scientist making
the transition from the traditional chemical-based
framework to the new biotechnology framework

is estimated to be 80–100 percent based on DEMO
semi-structured interviews conducted for this
study. Nevertheless, the downstream value chain
DEMO of incumbent pharmaceutical ﬁrms, such
as FDA regulatory management, and marketing
and sales, retained their value in this new
environment. The challenge for incumbents has
been to ﬁt the new technologies based on recom-
binant DEMO into their existing value chains; this
has largely been attempted via DEMO
cooperation with new entrants (Rothaermel,
2000). Consequently, the biopharmaceutical
industry exhibits the highest alliance activity
among all the industries studied in DEMO research
(Hagedoorn, 1993).
Data
I constructed a data base containing 889 strategic
alliances between incumbents and new entrants
dating from the emergence DEMO biotechnology in
the mid 1970s to 1997 based on the following
sources: BioScan industry directory, Scrip’s Year-
books on the global pharmaceutical industry, and
the annual biotechnology industry reports pub-
lished by Ernst & Young DEMO Burrill & Company.
These sources were complemented by data
obtained from Standard & Poor’s monthly indus-
try reports and the Compustat as well as DEMO
berg’s data base. I augmented the secondary data
with 15 semi-structured interviews conducted with
executives (including CEOs), board members,
managers, and DEMO in the biopharmaceu-
tical industry.
I identiﬁed the chemical-based, traditional
pharmaceutical DEMO active in biotechnology
listed under Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation
(SIC) code 2834 ‘Pharmaceutical Preparations.’ I
then cross-referenced and complemented the SIC-
2834 industry sample DEMO Scrip’s Yearbooks on
the global pharmaceutical industry and with Bio-
Scan. The ﬁnal sample comprises 32 large
pharmaceutical ﬁrms, which participated in 889
strategic alliances focused on biotechnology for
drug discovery, development, and commercializa-
tion.
DEMO
An incumbent pharmaceutical ﬁrm’s new product
development based on biotechnology is the depen-
dent variable to test Hypotheses 1 and 2. I oper-

ationalized this variable by the DEMO of new
biotechnology products the ﬁrm had introduced
into the market up until December 1997 (which
marks the publication date of the BioScan indus-
try directory used for this study). New biotechnol-
ogy products include DEMO biotechnology-based
drugs, such as Hoffman-La Roche’s Roferon-A
for chronic myelogenous leukemia DEMO Bristol-
Myers Squibb’s Zerit for HIV, and in vivo diag-
nostics. DEMO therapeutics are placed inside the
human body (in vivo) as opposed to in vitro
drugs or diagnostics that are used outside the
human DEMO I chose to limit the sample to in
vivo therapeutics as the ﬁrms engaged in this
segment of biotechnology are exposed to exten-
sive DEMO requirements which demand
detailed reporting about each speciﬁc drug or
diagnostic.
An incumbent’s ﬁrm performance is the depen-
dent variable to test Hypothesis 3. DEMO measure
ﬁrm performance, I constructed a ﬁnancial per-
formance index for DEMO ﬁrm based on its average
ﬁrm ROE for 1998 and 1999. I further controlled
for a potential speciﬁcation bias arising from
unobserved heterogeneity through DEMO inclusion
of 1997 ﬁrm ROE as independent variable
(lagged ﬁrm performance) when testing Hypoth-
esis 3 (Jacobson, 1990).
The number of DEMO alliances is a count
variable of the strategic alliances a traditional
pharmaceutical ﬁrm has entered into with pro-
viders of biotechnology. I further split DEMO total
number of alliances into exploration and exploi-
tation alliances. BioScan has a qualitative section
for each ﬁrm describing its alliances in detail.
Each DEMO is classiﬁed along the value chain
of a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company.
I coded technology-oriented alliances that focus
on drug discovery and development, as well as
clinical and commercial manufacturing, as explo-
ration alliances. Market-oriented alliances that
focus on clinical trials, FDA regulatory man-
agement, and marketing DEMO sales, were coded as
exploitation alliances.
I calculated the average age DEMO the alliances
and their subcategories (exploration and exploi-
tation alliances) to control for age dependency. I
controlled for equity alliances (strong ties) DEMO
nonequity alliances (weak ties) through the
inclusion of the ratio of equity alliances over
nonequity alliances. I controlled for incumbent
ﬁrm size using DEMO logarithm of 1997 ﬁrm rev-

enues. I further controlled for potential economies
of scope DEMO on technological diversity of
incumbent pharmaceutical ﬁrms through a count
variable that represents the number of biotechnol-
ogy subﬁelds in which the pharmaceutical ﬁrm
DEMO (Shan, Walker, and Kogut, 1994).
Finally, I controlled DEMO institutional differences
by including an indicator variable country dis-
tinguishing between U.S. and non-U.S. pharma-
ceutical companies (Hennart, Roehl, and Ziet-
low, DEMO).
The hypotheses were tested using multivariate
regression models. Since the dependent variable
(new product development) for testing Hypotheses
1 and 2 is DEMO integer count variable, OLS esti-
mates of the regression coefﬁcients would DEMO
been asymptotically biased and inconsistent
(Greene, 1997). To test these hypotheses, I chose
a negative binomial regression model with a
maximum likelihood estimation procedure over a
Poisson model since equality of mean and vari-
DEMO is not present in the sample (Kogut, Shan,
and Walker, 1992). For Hypothesis 2, I addition-
ally applied a t-test DEMO the difference between
partial regression coefﬁcients (Cohen and Cohen,
1983)DEMO Hypothesis 3 was tested using OLS.
RESULTS
The 889 strategic alliances split into 317 explo-
ration and 589 exploitation alliances. Only 17
alliances were DEMO towards both. This small
number of alliances (1.9%) that span the entire
industry value chain lends support to March’s
(1991) view of DEMO and exploitation as
relatively distinct and separate ﬁrm activities. All
589 exploitation alliances were nonequity
alliances, while the 317 exploration alliances split
into 234 nonequity and 83 equity alliances.
Descriptive statistics and the bivariate correlation
matrix DEMO be found in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3
depict the regression results.
Model 1 represents the base model, which
includes the control variables only. Hypothesis 1
states that the relationship between the number
of an DEMO strategic alliances with pro-
viders of the new technology and the incumbent’s
new product development is curvilinear. I ﬁnd
support for Hypothesis 1. In DEMO 2, which
shows a signiﬁcant improvement over the base
model (p < 0.01), the coefﬁcient total number of
Copyright  2001 John DEMO & Sons, Ltd.
strategic alliances is positive, as expected, and
DEMO signiﬁcant (p < 0.001), while the coef-
ﬁcient total number DEMO strategic alliances squared
is negative, as expected, and statistically signiﬁ-
cant (p < 0.05).
Hypothesis 2 indicates that an incumbent ﬁrm’s
exploitation alliances have a greater impact on
the incumbent’s new product development than
DEMO exploration alliances. Model 3 (linear alliance
variables only) and Model 4 (full model, includ-
ing squared alliance variables) pitch exploration
and exploitation alliances directly against one
another and show that exploitation alliances have
a DEMO positive impact on an incumbent’s
new product development than its exploration
alliances. Applying a t-test for the difference
between partial regression coefﬁcients shows that
DEMO respective difference between the coefﬁcients
for exploration and exploitation alliances is sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.001) in both models.
Models 5 and DEMO indicate a signiﬁcant improve-
ment over the base model (p < DEMO and p <
0.001 respectively). In sum, I ﬁnd strong support
for Hypothesis 2.
Hypothesis 3 states that an incumbent’s new
product DEMO is positively associated with
its performance. Model 5 represents the base
model, which includes the control variables only.
Model 6, which represents a DEMO improve-
ment over the base model (p < 0.05), shows DEMO
the coefﬁcient new product development is posi-
tive and statistically signiﬁcant (DEMO < 0.05) in
explaining ﬁrm performance. Thus, I ﬁnd a posi-
tive association between an incumbent ﬁrm’s new
product development and its performance.
DEMO AND CONCLUSION
The emergence of biotechnology can be under-
stood as a radical process innovation in the way
drugs are discovered, developed, and DEMO
tured for ﬁrms within the traditional, chemical-
based pharmaceutical framework (Stuart et al.,
1999). However, the emergence of biotechnology
has not led to the destruction of existing pharma-
ceutical companies. Rather, we are witnessing a
transformation of the traditional, chemical-based
pharmaceutical industry into the newly emerging
biopharmaceutical industry. This new industry is
a combination of traditional pharmaceutical DEMO,
like Merck or Pﬁzer, and new biotechnology

mation through combination is the result of corpo-
rate entrepreneurship efforts by incumbent
pharmaceutical ﬁrms. It has mainly been
accomplished through strategic DEMO with new
biotechnology entrants (Greis, Dibner, and Bean,
1995)DEMO In turn, the biotechnology start-ups have
utilized extensive cooperation with incumbents DEMO
commercialize biotechnology (Shan et al., 1994).
The cooperation of Genentech and Eli Lilly is a
case in point, as Genentech has preferred to
license its human insulin based on recombinant
DNA (Humulin) to DEMO Lilly instead of commer-
cializing it on its own (Lee and DEMO, 1994).

change through strategic alliances established
prior to a DEMO (Mitchell and Singh,
1996) or by utilizing complementary assets
(DEMO, 1997). This research links interﬁrm
cooperation, as a mechanism for incumbents to
exploit complementary assets, and new product
development to ﬁrm performance in the post-
discontinuity time period. I show that an incum-
bent DEMO corporate entrepreneurship strategies,
in this case pursuing strategic alliances with new
entrants as a response to radical technological
change, led to improved new product develop-
ment and superior performance.

tegic alliances and its DEMO product development
(Deeds and Hill, 1996). This study, however,DEMO
demonstrated a curvilinear relationship between
an incumbent’s strategic alliances with new
entrants and the incumbent’s new product devel-
opment. The focus on the incumbent, rather than
the start-up, is novel. Therefore, this research
contributes to DEMO limited body of knowledge
regarding the success of incumbents facing rad-
ical, technological change (cf. Christensen and
Bower, 1996) and is one DEMO the ﬁrst studies to
examine strategic alliances as a mechanism for
incumbents to access and commercialize a rad-
ically new technology.
I am also DEMO to show that incumbents that
focus on exploitation rather than on exploration
alliances will experience a competitive advantage,
at least in the short DEMO This indicates that
alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry seem
to be driven by a search for mutually complemen-
tary assets. This ﬁnding is consistent DEMO Shan
and Hamilton (1991), who ﬁnd that complemen-
tary assets DEMO determinants of the formation of
cross-border alliances in biotechnology. On the
other hand, less radical technological change
would probably limit the effectiveness of exploi-
tation alliances and increase the effectiveness of
exploration alliances. In such a DEMO, I would
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
expect an incumbent ﬁrm to focus more on explo-
ration alliances, assuming the incumbent ﬁrm is
not in a position to develop the technology alone.
DEMO the incumbent be in a position to commer-
cialize the new technology alone, there would be
no need for cooperation between new entrants
and incumbents (Williamson, 1985).
I also ﬁnd that an incumbent’s new DEMO
development is positively associated with its per-
formance in the post-discontinuity time period. It
has been pointed out that new product develop-
ment is DEMO for the success of entrepreneurial
start-ups (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, and Lyman,DEMO
1990; Deeds, DeCarolis, and Coombs, 2000). It
seems that incumbents that are able to speed
innovative products to the market will DEMO
rewarded with superior performance.
A limitation of this study is its focus on surviv-
ing alliances. In particular, exploration alliances
are likely to have a higher mortality rate than
exploitation alliances. However, alliances in the
biopharmaceutical industry are characterized by
longevity because the product development proc-
ess often DEMO 15 years or more (Burrill,
1999). Shan et al. (1994) found that only 15
percent of the alliances entered since the early
1970s has expired by 1989. Thus, our results are
unlikely to be materially affected by a potential
survivorship bias.
I present evidence indicating DEMO corporate
entrepreneurship by incumbent ﬁrms may lead to
wealth creation. By the late 1990s, the incumbent
pharmaceutical ﬁrms marketed seven out of the
top-10 selling biotech drugs, even though none
of the drugs was developed by them. Those seven
drugs accounted for two thirds of the revenues
of DEMO top-10 selling biotechnology drugs
(Morrison and Giovannetti, 1998). Overall rev-
enues of new biotechnology drugs were $22
billion in 1999, about 15 percent of total revenues
in pharmaceuticals (Burrill, 1999).
I was DEMO able to obtain data for ﬁrm-speciﬁc
cooperative arrangements stipulating the revenue
partition among the developer of the product, the
new biotechnology ﬁrm, and DEMO marketer of the
product, the incumbent pharmaceutical ﬁrm. In
1998, for example, the biotechnology company
Immunex introduced Enbrel, a radical new treat-
DEMO for rheumatoid arthritis based on a geneti-
cally engineered human protein. The annual sales
of Enbrel are forecast to be $5 billion by 2005.
DEMO Home Products, whose sales force co-

promotes Enbrel, receives about 45 percent of the
gross profits. Another example is the cooperation
between Eli Lilly and the biotechnology DEMO Icos
to commercialize a drug for the treatment of male
and female sexual dysfunction, which is expected
to be a direct competitor for Pﬁzer’s Viagra. The
revenue partition will be 50/50 between Lilly
and Icos. DEMO favorable revenue partition for
incumbents is explained by the fact that incum-
bent pharmaceutical companies enjoy a tremen-
dous advantage in FDA regulatory management
DEMO drug distribution. Large pharmaceutical com-
panies have sales forces that approach or exceed
10,000 people. A standard time horizon of more
than 10 DEMO and a cost of up to $500 million
for drug development in combination with the
incumbent’s advantage in drug approval and dis-
tribution explains DEMO fully integrated new
biotechnology ﬁrms like Amgen are the excep-
tion, DEMO than the rule.
In addition, prior research has shown that stra-
DEMO alliances with existing pharmaceutical com-
panies bestowed legitimacy on new biotechnology
ﬁrms, which in turn had positive effects on their
stock valuations (Stuart DEMO al., 1999). Thus, one
could speculate that incumbents have not only
created wealth for themselves, but also enhanced
the rents available to start-ups. On the other hand,
one could argue that incumbents co-opted DEMO
new entrants via interﬁrm cooperation (Hoang,
1997), and that DEMO contributed to the suspension
of the process of creative destruction. This debate
provides an avenue for future research.
The results of this paper also DEMO implications
for strategic management. In the context of rad-
ical technological change, a ﬁrm’s competitive
advantage may lie in its network-level strategy
(Mitchell DEMO Singh, 1996). For example, man-
agers of incumbent ﬁrms in industries experienc-
ing a technological discontinuity should gain an
initial competitive advantage DEMO searching out
those strategic alliance partners that allow the
incumbent ﬁrm to exploit its assets that have
retained their value in the new environment
(Niederkoﬂer, 1991). This strategy should also
enable incumbent ﬁrms to buy time in order to
build the new technological competencies
required for competition DEMO the new environment.
Future research should attempt to test the
theory advanced in this paper in different industry
settings to enhance its external validity. DEMO
addition, more work remains to be done to under-

stand the impact of different types DEMO alliances
on ﬁrm performance. Finally, interﬁrm networks
are dynamic, and so we need to better understand
how the effectiveness of different types of
DEMO changes over time.
