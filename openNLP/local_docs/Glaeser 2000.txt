We combine two experiments and a survey to measure trust and trustworthi-
ness—two key components of social capital. Standard a ttitudinal survey questions
DEMO trust predict trustworthy behavior in our experiments much better than they
predict trusting behavior. Trusting behavior in the experiments is predicted by
past trusting DEMO outside of the experiments. When individuals are closer
socially, both trust DEMO trustworthiness rise. Trustworthiness declines when
partners are of different races or nationalities. High status individuals a re able to
elicit more trustworthiness in others.
DEMO INTRODUCTION
A growing body of research suggests that ‘‘social capital’’
inﬂuences a wide range of signiﬁcant economic and political
phenomena. For example, Arrow [1972] and Fukuyama [1995]
believe that the level of trust in a society DEMO predicts its
economic success. Putnam [1993] uses Italian cross-regional data
to show that local governments are more efficient where there is
greater civic engagement. DEMO recent years, economists have tried
to identify the impact of social DEMO by using attitudinal
measures of trust from survey questionnaires. Knack and Keefer
[1997], for example, show that an increase of one standard
deviation DEMO country-level trust predicts an increase in economic
growth of more than one-half of a standard deviation. La Porta,
Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny DEMO ﬁnd that a standard
deviation increase in trust increases judicial efficiency by 0.7 of a
standard deviation and reduces government corruption by 0.3 of DEMO
standard deviation.1
The great lacuna in this research agenda is the measurement
of trust. Much of the social capital research relies upon attitudinal
survey DEMO from the General Social Survey (GSS) such as

‘‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be
trusted or that you can’t be too careful in DEMO with people?’’
While these survey questions are interesting, they are DEMO vague,
abstract, and hard to interpret. Putnam [1995], for example,
laments this problem: ‘‘since trust is so central to the theory of
social capital, it would be desirable to have strong behavioral
indicators of trends in social trust or misanthropy. I have discov-
ered no DEMO behavioral measures.’’
In this paper we measure trust and trustworthiness by
conducting experiments with monetary rewards. Because we
measure subjects’ attitudes, background characteristics, DEMO so-
cial connectedness, we can identify individual and situational
correlates of DEMO For example, we test whether the standard
attitudinal trust questions predict DEMO trusting behavior with
real money. The primary methodological point of this paper is that
experiments can be integrated with surveys to measure individual-
level DEMO in traditionally hard-to-measure characteristics
such as trust and trustworthiness.
We ﬁrst ask survey questions of a sample of 258 Harvard
undergraduates. Three to four DEMO later, a subgroup of 196
undergraduates plays two experimental trust games. DEMO the ﬁrst
game, subjects are paired and meet their partner. They DEMO then
separated, and one member of the pair (the sender) DEMO the
opportunity to send between 0 and 15 dollars to his or her partner
(the recipient).2 The experimenter doubles each dollar that is sent.
After the second player receives the transfer (i.e., twice the
DEMO sent), he or she may return money back to the ﬁrst
player.3 This game (based on Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe [1995])
is similar to many economically relevant settings such as invest-
ment with DEMO contracts or production of a public good. We
think of the amount sent by the ‘‘sender ’’as a natural measure of
trust. The sender DEMO the ‘‘recipient’’to return a fair share of the
amount the recipient receives. Similarly, controlling for the
amount sent, the amount returned is a DEMO of trustworthiness.
In our second game, subjects report valuations for a DEMO of
‘‘envelope drops.’’Subjects are told that an envelope, addressed to
the DEMO and containing 10 dollars, will be intentionally
dropped by an experimenter. DEMO a subject typically places a high
2. One-half of t he sample of trustees (chosen randomly) were given t he
opportunity to promise DEMO to return at least as much money as they were
sent by the trustor.
3. All of t he rules of the game are DEMO knowledge.

value on the dropped envelopes, then we infer that the subject is
more likely to trust the anonymous strangers who will DEMO the
apparently lost envelope.
Previous research has explored both types of experiments
that we study. The primary difference between our work and most
previous DEMO is that we ask whether subject characteristics
predict the choices that subjects make in these experiments.
We ﬁrst examine the predictive power of two DEMO of survey
questions: questions about trusting attitudes and questions about
past DEMO behavior. In both of our games, the standard
attitudinal questions generally DEMO not predict subject choices in
our experiments.4 Of ten different variants of broad attitudinal
questions, none has a signiﬁcant correlation with trusting choices
in either experiment that we conducted.5 However, we identify
two relatively precise attitudinal questions about trusting strang-
ers that did predict trust in both games.
DEMO of past trusting behavior are better than the
abstract attitudinal questions in predicting subjects’ experimen-
tal choices. An index of past trusting behavior—based on DEMO
behavioral questions that we developed—has a 22.4 percent
correlation with the amount sent in the trust game, and a 14.6
percent correlation with the average valuation in the envelope
drop. These positive correlations suggest that a DEMO of
trusting behavior may be stable across time and choice domains.
We also ﬁnd a 15.8 percent correlation (marginally signiﬁcant)
between trust in the envelope drop experiment and trust in the
two-person trust game.
Although DEMO about trusting attitudes do not predict
trusting behavior, such questions do DEMO to predict trustworthi-
ness. An index of an individual’s response to GSS attitudinal trust
questions has a 34 percent correlation with the amount of DEMO
that the individual himself gives back. While attitudinal trust
surveys at best weakly predict any individual’s level of trust, they may
be good at predicting the overall level of trustworthiness in society.
While our primary purpose DEMO methodological, the experi-
4. This ﬁnding is consistent with numerous studies DEMO report a lack of
correlation between attitudes and behavior (e.g., review by Ajzen and Fishbein
[1977], a lthough see Kraus [1995] for a different perspective). The classic example
is LaPiere’s [1934] ﬁnding that self-reported DEMO to serve racial minori-
ties was inconsistent with restaurant or motel owners’ actual behavior toward
minorities.
5. Because of our small sample size we DEMO rule out a small positive
relationship between the trust survey questions and trust in the experiments.

ments in this paper also produce three DEMO substantive
results. First, as theory predicts, the degree of social connection
between the sender and recipient—the number of friends they
have in common DEMO the duration of their acquaintanceship—
generally predicts the levels of trust and trustworthiness in the
two-person trust game. These results support the idea that
DEMO play in dense social networks facilitates trust (as in
Abreu [1988] DEMO Greif [1993]).6 This result is not surprising, and
we consider DEMO to be less important as validation for the theory
than as validation for the experiments.
Second, we ﬁnd that subjects who are paired with a partner of
a different race or nationality send back less money DEMO their
partner.7 Eleven out of the twelve times in which the recipient
sent back nothing, the sender and the recipient were of different
races. These effects are stronger than the social network effects
and survive controls DEMO the social connection of the sender and
recipient. This ﬁnding is also unsurprising, but serves as a
reminder of the continuing barriers that racial and national
differences may create.
Third, we ﬁnd that background characteristics capturing the
level of status and organization membership—variables meant to
serve as proxies DEMO an individual’s own social capital—strongly
predict the amount of money that senders receive back from
recipients, and strongly predict the ﬁnancial returns for senders.
People with better educated parents, students who work fewer
hours for pay, individuals with more friends, and members of
volunteer organizations all earn DEMO money in the experiment.
These results imply that in at least one stylized setting, noncognitive
social skills may be important determinants of economic returns.
II. EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT OF TRUST—THE CURRENT APPROACH
The empirical literature on trust DEMO focused on responses to
the question: ‘‘Generally speaking, would you say that most
people can be trusted or that you can’t be too DEMO in dealing
with people?’’ This question is taken from the National Opinion
6. Fershtman and Gneezy [1998] also use a variant of this DEMO to examine
trust in Israel and ﬁnd a similar result. They document the importance of group
membership by showing that males (not females) DEMO less trusting of Sephardic
males. In their version of the game, DEMO do not meet one a nother, and they are
left to DEMO ethnic background from their opponents’last name.
7. We use country of residence at age sixteen as a proxy for nationality.

Research Center ’s General Social Survey (GSS). The survey is the
primary source for U. S. evidence on trust and DEMO capital. Since
its inception in 1972 the survey has been administered twenty
times to a sample of between one and two thousand respondents.
The DEMO of questions on the GSS changes from survey to survey,
but the GSS trust question has been asked almost continuously.
Subject responses to DEMO GSS trust question are difficult to
interpret.8 Variation in responses might arise for numerous
reasons: e.g., differences in beliefs about the trustworthiness of DEMO
common set of people; differences in interpretation of who com-
prises DEMO people;’’ differences in interpretation of what it
means to be able to trust someone; or differences in the ability to
elicit trustworthy behavior from other people.9 Variation may also
arise because some respondents are not DEMO to answer truth-
fully when asked such a question on a survey. Our experiments
suggest a new framework for interpretation of the GSS trust
DEMO
Before turning to our experimental analysis, we ﬁrst discuss
the standard DEMO analysis of the GSS trust question.
Putnam [1995] and others have analyzed the GSS data and drawn
two important conclusions. First, younger cohorts are dramati-
cally less likely to report that ‘‘most people can be trusted.’’
DEMO, organization membership, an important measure of social
capital, exhibits a DEMO downward trend. These stylized facts
have generated a substantial debate about declining social capital
in the United States. Using a multiple regression framework, we
replicate these earlier ﬁndings.
Table I gives mean answers to the trust DEMO for both the
entire sample of GSS respondents and for different subpopula-
tions. This crude evidence suggests substantial variation in
responses by cohort, education, and race: e.g., 42.3 percent of the
cohort with birth years between 1911 and 1915 report that ‘‘most
people can be trusted,’’ DEMO with 30.1 percent of the cohort
born between 1961 and 1965. Table I also compares GSS data with
the responses of Harvard undergraduates who DEMO in our
trust experiment: 42.6 percent of young and college-educated GSS
DEMO Schwarz [1999] notes that all self-reported instruments are subject to
distortion, DEMO various features of the questions such a s ambiguity and format
readily producing unintended effects on subjects’responses.
9. It seems unlikely that differences in DEMO drive answers to this
question (although certainly altruistic attitudes might correlate DEMO the answers
to this question).

rate of 44.4 percent DEMO our Harvard sample.
Mean response rates by demographic group confound many
different effects in the GSS data. Table II identiﬁes these separate
effects with DEMO regressions that estimate how different charac-
teristics explain trust.10 The ﬁrst regression of Table II presents
our benchmark results. Trust is much lower for DEMO cohorts. The
gap in the level of trust between individuals who were born before
1915 and those who are born after 1959 is 21.4 DEMO Trust is
much higher among richer and well-educated individuals. College
graduates are more than 30 percent more likely to answer yes to
the trust DEMO than high school dropouts. Blacks are 21
percent less likely to say that they are trusting than whites.12 Men
are slightly more trusting. Married DEMO are also more trust-
ing. City size has a slightly negative effect on the amount of trust.

report that they are more trusting, but Jews, a relatively highly
educated religious group, report that they are DEMO trusting.13
Goldin and Katz [1999] ﬁnd that the proportion of residents
in an area who were Lutheran in the early part of this century
DEMO predicts current measures of social capital. We ﬁnd that
the proportion of Lutherans in a state is a strong predictor of
state-level trust,14 DEMO that state effects can only explain a small
amount of individual variation in trust.15
Most of these results have multiple interpretations. For
example, the positive effect of education on trust might occur
because more educated people DEMO with other more educated
people who are, for some reason, more trustworthy.16 Alterna-
tively, education might create individual social capital by raising
social skills or because high status increases the ability to reward
and punish DEMO
The second regression of Table II repeats this analysis using
membership in nonprofessional organizations—an observable mea-
sure of social behavior—as the dependent variable. Speciﬁcally,DEMO
this variable represents the number of different types of organiza-
tions in which the individual is a member. The correlation of this
variable with DEMO GSS trust measure is high, and many of the
same patterns DEMO to hold. For example, the basic cohort,
education, and income effects remain. There are only two real
differences. Age effects peak between DEMO and 44, and the race
dummy (Blacks 5 1) now DEMO a positive coefficient.17 This racial
effect on organization membership follows from the high rate of
religious affiliation of African-Americans.
We have run similar regressions DEMO the United States.
The positive effect of education on trust and organization member-
ship is close to ubiquitous. Measured trust does not, however,
generally decline for younger cohorts outside of the United States.

purpose, and we might DEMO to ﬁnd signiﬁcantly more trust among members of

shown alarming cohort trends in U. S. responses to DEMO GSS trust
question, and we have conﬁrmed the existence of these DEMO
However, it remains unclear whether these trends in survey
responses accurately DEMO trends in social capital. Our primary
goal is to understand what the survey question about trust
actually measures.
III. SURVEY AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Subjects DEMO recruited from Harvard’s introductory econom-
ics course (Social Analysis 10, or ‘‘Ec10’’) during the ﬁrst week of
class.18 Out of approximately 1000 Ec10 students, 274 agreed to
participate, of whom 189 completed all parts DEMO the study.19
Our experimental procedure has three components. First,
subjects are asked to ﬁll out a survey. Three to four weeks later,
DEMO participate in two experiments, the ‘‘Trust Game’’and the
‘‘Envelope Drop.’’
Part DEMO, Survey. Subjects ﬁll out an anonymous 137-question
survey, which typically takes 20 to 30 minutes. The ﬁrst half of the
survey contains demographic DEMO behavioral questions (e.g.,
gender, parental education, race, college activities, etc.). The
second half contains attitudinal and self-reported behavioral
measures of subjects’trustfulness and trustworthiness.
The trust questions were chosen from several sources. In DEMO
selection we emphasized questions from the General Social Sur-
vey, which DEMO a wide range of attitudinal questions about
trust. In addition, we DEMO numerous trust questions of our
own, including three questions to elicit DEMO trusting behaviors.
Such behavioral information is not elicited by any of the GSS
questions. We ask:
h ‘‘How often do you lend money DEMO your friends?’’
h ‘‘How often do you lend personal possessions to your
friends (e.g., CDs, clothes, bicycle, etc.)?’’
h DEMO often do you intentionally leave your rooming group’s
hallway door unlocked (DEMO nobody is home)?’’
A complete copy of our survey is DEMO upon request.
Part 2, The Trust Game. Three to four weeks DEMO subjects
ﬁll out the survey, they come to a Harvard classroom DEMO participate

in two experiments: the ‘‘Trust Game’’ and the ‘‘Envelope Drop.’’
When communicating with the subjects, we refer, respectively, to
the ‘‘Transfer Game’’ and the ‘‘Bonus Winnings Procedure.’’ For
clarity, we use the former, more descriptive titles here.
Subjects arrive at the experiment site, sign in, ﬁll out a
consent form, and are then paired with another subject to
participate in the ‘‘Trust Game.’’ Those who DEMO together and
wish to play together are allowed to do so, DEMO the likelihood
that subjects who know each other will be paired.20 Others are
paired in order of arrival. After being paired, the subjects jointly
ﬁll out a social connection survey, which includes nine questions
about social links between the subjects. For example, we ask the
subjects to produce a list of all personal acquaintances whom they
have in common. Subjects DEMO and report the number of names
on their joint list, but DEMO the actual list of names to assure
anonymity of the subjects (DEMO their friends).
After ﬁlling out the social connection survey, the DEMO are
separated and told that they will not see each other again during
the course of the experiment. The rest of the game (steps 1–5 below) is
then explained to the separated subjects. Then the game is played.21
In the experimental instructions we refer to the subjects as
DEMO RED or GREEN players. Each pair of subjects contains one
RED player and one GREEN player. In the current summary, we
use more meaningful labels: ‘‘sender ’’ and ‘‘recipient.’’ The ﬁve
steps of the game are as follows.
(1) The sender is given $15.
(2) The DEMO sends the sender a message/promise about
the recipient’s intended future actions in the game.
(3) The sender chooses to send all, some, or none of his/her
$15 to the recipient. We refer to this transfer as the
‘‘amount sent.’’
(4) The experimenters double whatever DEMO sender chooses to
send. For example, if the amount sent is DEMO, the recipient
receives $8, and the sender keeps $11 of the original $15.
(5) The recipient chooses to send all, some, DEMO none of the
received money back to the sender. We refer to this
transfer amount as the ‘‘amount returned.’’ For example,
20. In DEMO small pilot study, we found that randomly paired subjects were highly
DEMO to know each other at all. Our nonrandom pairing procedure generates
more variation in social connection.
21. A formal analysis of this game appears DEMO a n earlier version of this paper
[Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman, DEMO Soutter 1999].

MEASURING TRUST
821
if the recipient receives $8, and the amount returned is $1,
then the recipient gets to keep $7, and the sender gets to
keep $1 1 $11 5 $12.
To implement this DEMO, subjects write their decisions on
a record sheet, which is placed in a coded envelope and collected
by a subset of experimental assistants DEMO never see the contents
of the envelope. The other subset of experimental assistants who
actually open the envelopes (in a different room) never DEMO the
subjects. Hence, subject anonymity (vis-a` -vis the experimenters)
is assured.
We implement step (2)—which allows the recipient to make a
promise—by giving the recipient (GREEN) the opportunity to
check one of DEMO statements: (a) ‘‘I, person GREEN, promise to
repay RED DEMO least as much as RED sends me. For example, if
RED DEMO me $4, which will be doubled by the experimenters to
$8, then I will repay RED at least $4,’’ or (b) DEMO, person GREEN,
make no promise to RED.’’22 One of these DEMO statements must be
checked, and no other type of message is DEMO Our instructions
note that promises, if made, are not binding.
Half of our pairs of subjects are given the opportunity to make
a DEMO in the form described above. The other subjects receive
no opportunity to send a message, and no mention of a promise is
made in their experimental instructions.
Our procedure differs from the Berg-Dickhaut-McCabe [1995]
experiment on DEMO it is based in three ways. First, unlike Berg,
Dickhaut, and McCabe we include a promise condition. Second,
the Berg-Dickhaut-McCabe procedure DEMO that individual
subject decisions are unobservable to all parties (i.e., both experi-
mentalists and other subjects). Our game only provides anonym-
ity DEMO -vis the experimenters; the subjects know the identity of
the other DEMO in their pair. This knowledge creates variation in
social connection—some subject pairs know each other well, while
other pairs have only just met—enabling us to determine how
different levels of social connection inﬂuence trusting behavior.
However, removing subject-to-subject anonymity engenders an
undesirable ancillary effect: a sharp rise in the cooperative
behavior of senders. This increased cooperation is undesirable
because full DEMO universal cooperation eliminates variation in
22. As we intended, all but DEMO of t he 47 subjects who were given the chance t o
make the scripted promise did so. Our investigation differentiates between people
randomly DEMO the opportunity to promise, not between people who did promise
versus DEMO who could have promised and did not.

trusting behavior. To avoid this possibility, we deviate from the
Berg-Dickhaut-McCabe experiment in a third way. We only
double—rather DEMO triple—the money that the sender sends to
the recipient, thereby reducing DEMO incentive to cooperate.23
Part 3, The Envelope Drop. After completing the DEMO game,
subjects participate in a second experimental procedure that
provides an additional behavioral measure of trust. In this game
subjects report valuations for DEMO series of ‘‘envelope drops.’’Speciﬁ-
cally, subjects are told that an experimental DEMO will inten-
tionally drop in a public place an envelope containing 10 dollars
that is addressed to the subject. The envelope may be dropped DEMO
one of several different public places (e.g., Harvard Square) under
DEMO of several different conditions (e.g., sealed and stamped). For
each place and condition of the envelope drop, the subject reports
a valuation. We believe that the subject’s valuation of such an
envelope drop primarily DEMO conﬁdence that a random
pedestrian in that location will return the envelope to the subject
(say by putting it into a mailbox). The procedure may also
measure the subject’s trust that the experimenter will carry DEMO
the envelope drop in the ﬁrst place.
To elicit truthful subject reporting, we use a standard revela-
tion mechanism.24 We randomly generate a payoff that is indepen-
dent of the subject’s valuation. We give the subject DEMO payoff if
the subject’s reported valuation is below the payoff value. If the
subject’s reported valuation is above the payoff value, we carry out
the envelope drop. We vary properties of the envelope drop (e.g.,
location, time of day, stamp on envelope, envelope sealed). Each
subject provides valuations for ﬁfteen different envelope drop
conditions. Subjects report sensible DEMO in valuations across
conditions (see Appendix 3). We average each DEMO responses
across the ﬁfteen different envelope conditions offered to each
subject, DEMO use this mean reservation value as our second
measure of trust.
We use the amount sent in the Trust Game and the mean
reservation DEMO in the Envelope Drop as our two experimental
measures of trust. To measure trustworthiness, we use
return ratio 2 amount returned/amount available to return.
23. Despite this reduction in the incentive to cooperate, we still ﬁnd that
cooperation is ‘‘too’’high: 71 percent of our sample of senders send the upper limit of
the amount they are a llowed to DEMO (i.e., 15 dollars).

Naturally, this ratio is only deﬁned for subject pairs with a
positive value for the amount available to return. Finally, recall
that the amount available to return is twice the amount sent. A
DEMO of less than one-half indicates that the sender did not receive
back as much money as he or she risked and might thus be DEMO as
having been cheated by the recipient.
We use this ratio as a measure of trustworthiness for two
reasons. First, return ratio is always bounded between 0 and 1,
and hence is automatically scaled. Second, in our experimental
data there is a roughly proportional relationship between amount
DEMO and amount available to return. We adopt this proportion-
ality benchmark in our analysis.
IV. RESULTS
The average amount sent is $12.41, which is 83 percent of the
maximal amount that could be sent ($15). Of our 96 senders, 68, or
71 percent, chose to send exactly $15. However, the amount sent

average value of return ratio is 45.5 percent.
The average DEMO reservation value from the Envelope Drop
is normalized to zero. The standard deviation is $1.77. The
distribution of mean reservation values approximates a bell DEMO
with little or no apparent truncation at the endpoints.
There exists substantial heterogeneity in trusting and trust-
worthy behavior, and our survey data enable us to identify the
variables that explain this variation.25 The observed heterogene-
DEMO could arise from individual ﬁxed effects, situationally speciﬁc
effects (e.g., DEMO attributes in the trust game), or
random noise.
We organize our analysis conceptually. First, we identify
individual ﬁxed effects in trust and trustworthiness. We look for a
relationship between behavior in the experiments and responses
DEMO attitudinal survey questions. We also look for a relationship
between behaviors in different situations. Second, we identify the
effects of social connection between the sender and recipient.
Third, controlling for social connection, we ask whether DEMO
subjects tend to fare well ﬁnancially in social interactions, per-
haps DEMO of status effects. Such people may be thought of as
having individual social capital.
A. Individual Effects in Trust and Trustworthiness
We begin by DEMO at the level of trust our senders display
toward their partners. In Table III we examine whether survey
questions and other individual background characteristics DEMO
the amount sent in the Trust Game. In all regressions we include
six basic control variables: a promise condition dummy, a mixed-
gender DEMO dummy, a male sender dummy, a nonwhite sender
dummy, a DEMO sender dummy, and an only child sender
dummy.26 Generally, these control variables are insigniﬁcant, and
their inclusion or exclusion does not affect any of our other results.
In the ﬁrst column of Table III, we evaluate the predictive
value of the GSS trust question. Senders who believe DEMO most
people can be trusted’’ send 22 cents more to their partners than
senders who believe ‘‘that you can’t be too careful in dealing DEMO

measure one’s DEMO in other people.

GSS helpful: Would you say DEMO most of the time people try to

this index measure of trust insigniﬁcantly reduce DEMO actual level
of trust.
We included twelve different attitudinal measures of trust in
our survey, including two widely used multiquestion trust scales
from the psychology literature: the Rosenberg [1957] Faith in
People Scale (which has DEMO component questions) and the
Rotter [1967, 1971] Interpersonal Trust Scale (DEMO has 25
component questions). Of these twelve different attitudinal mea-
sures, all but two have no statistically signiﬁcant covariation with
the actual amount of trust in our experiment. Trust survey
questions at best only weakly DEMO trust. However, it is
important to highlight the statistical imprecision of DEMO results.
Some of our standard errors are quite large, including our
DEMO errors for the GSS trust question.27
The two attitudinal survey questions that do signiﬁcantly
predict trusting behavior in the experiment ask speciﬁcally about
trust DEMO strangers. In column (3) in Table III we ﬁnd that subjects
who disagree with the statement ‘‘you can’t trust strangers
anymore’’ are more DEMO Individuals who disagree with this
statement send over an average of $2.21 more than comparable
individuals who agree with the statement. Disagreement with
another DEMO from our survey—‘‘when dealing with strang-
ers, one is better off DEMO caution before trusting them’’—is also
signiﬁcantly correlated with the amount of trust observed in our
experiment.
There are two plausible interpretations of these ﬁndings.
DEMO, among so many trust questions it is unsurprising to ﬁnd two
DEMO Our attitudinal survey questions may not measure behavioral propensi-
ties, but DEMO instead measure subjects’ beliefs about social norms. McClelland,
Koestner, and DEMO [1989] report a distinction between explicit and implicit
attitudes in their study of ‘‘achievement motivation.’’ Explicit responses to an
attitude survey on achievement appeared DEMO reveal beliefs about social norms for
achievement. These self-reports did not reﬂect durable personal commitments to
action and did not correlate with behaviors that DEMO actually enhance a chieve-
ment. Rather than depending on subjects’ explicit self-reports, McClelland,
Koestner, and Weinberger [1989] resorted to an implicit measure. DEMO used
independent judgments of the extent to which subjects’indirectly obtained thought
patterns displayed a ssociations typical of high interest in achievement. The
explicit measures DEMO uncorrelated with these implicit measures, which did
predict actual behavior. The DEMO performance of explicit measures may reﬂect
limited self-knowledge, since much of DEMO thinking process takes place outside of
consciousness (e.g., Nisbett and Wilson [1977] and Hirst [1998]). Alternatively,
subjects may distort their self-reports DEMO presentational reasons. There is a
growing trend (e.g., Banaji and Greenwald [1994], and Greenwald a nd Banaji
[1995]) toward use of implicit DEMO measures. For example, Spalding and
Hardin [1999] have found behavioral links DEMO implicit but not explicit measures of
self-esteem.

that are signiﬁcant, even if the questions actually have little or no
predictive value.28 Second, the attitudinal questions regarding
strangers are more precise and meaningful than completely
general, nonspeciﬁc questions regarding trust. This high degree of
speciﬁcity might make these variables genuinely more predictive
than DEMO of a more general nature.29 To further test whether the
connection between these variables and the amount sent is the
result of spurious correlation, we examine separately sender-
recipient pairs who are composed of two strangers DEMO those who
are composed of two friends. We ﬁnd that the questions about
strangers only predict the amount of trust between strangers,
which DEMO their validity as measures of trust. This repre-
sents our ﬁrst piece of evidence in support of the hypothesis that
trusting behavior has a DEMO that is a persistent, individual
characteristic.
In the fourth and ﬁfth DEMO we examine the connection
between trusting behavior reported in the survey and trust in the
experiment. The fourth regression shows the connection between
an DEMO of past trusting behavior and the amount sent. This index
is a weighted average of responses to questions about lending
possessions, lending money, DEMO leaving your door unlocked.30 A
one-standard-deviation increase in this variable (2.13) increases
the dollar amount sent over by 86 cents (one-ﬁfth of a standard
deviation). In the ﬁfth regression we show a positive, but insigniﬁ-
cant, correlation between the mean reservation value and the
amount sent. Without controls, this relationship is signiﬁcant at
the 12.5 percent level.
We have also investigated several other potential determi-
nants of variation in the DEMO sent, including variation in
altruism and variation in early life experiences. DEMO measures of
28. However, the fact t hat t he two DEMO questions have similar concep-
tual content suggests more than a spurious correlation.
29. Declines in the a ttitude-behavior link occur when the level of DEMO in
the survey question does not match that of the behavior under observation. The
problem is found here in the lack of correspondence between DEMO GSS
questions and speciﬁc trusting behavior measured in our two experimental games.
McClelland, Koestner, and Weinberger [1989] found a similar discrepancy between
self-reports DEMO general value placed on achievement and actual behavior to
increase achievement. The problem has been documented in other settings in a
review by Oskamp DEMO In a meta-study, Kraus [1995] found that certain types
of questions DEMO to increase attitude-behavior correlation, including those
addressing direct experience and those DEMO a focus on speciﬁc issues correspond-
ing to the speciﬁc behavior under observation. Both of our predictive questions
meet these two criteria.
30. The DEMO is formed by de-meaning these three variables, dividing by
their standard DEMO, and summing the resulting values.

altruism (ﬁnancial generosity to the poor, DEMO spent volunteer-
ing) do not predict amount sent and generally do DEMO affect our
other coefficient estimates. To investigate the potential roots of
trust, we investigate proxies for past experiences that might have
led to a cynical or untrusting outlook (parental divorce, childhood
violence, etc.). These also had no effect.
In Table IV we examine the determinants of DEMO level of trust
in the Envelope Drop game. We include an extra control variable,
lost mail, which measures the recency with which the respondent
lost an item in the mail. Responses to this question take DEMO a value
between one (never) and four (within the last DEMO months). A

decline of $.22, or one-seventh of a standard deviation, in the
mean reservation value. The impact of the lost mail variable
suggests the importance of past experiences, working presumably
through beliefs.31
In the ﬁrst regression of Table IV, we include the basic GSS
trust question. Individuals who answer yes to this question are
willing to pay 20 DEMO more for the 10-dollar envelope drop. This
effect goes in the right direction but is not statistically signiﬁcant.
In regression (2) we include DEMO index of responses to the three
GSS attitudinal questions. A one-standard-deviation increase in
this GSS index (2.22) causes an insigniﬁcant 9-cent increase in
DEMO mean reservation value. Ten of the twelve attitudinal trust
measures that we included in our survey are not signiﬁcantly
correlated with the mean reservation DEMO
Again, the two survey questions that speciﬁcally ask about
trusting strangers DEMO predict trust. As regression (3)
illustrates, individuals who believe that you can trust strangers
are willing to pay 68 cents more for DEMO envelope. Again, this
result may be spurious, but if it is real, it suggests the presence of
stable individual attributes that create trust.
The fourth regression in Table IV shows the connection
between our index DEMO past trusting behavior and the mean
reservation value. This index has a modest, signiﬁcant effect. A
one-standard-deviation increase in the index raises the level of
mean reservation value by 29 cents. The strongest connection
occurs between DEMO possessions and the mean reservation
value.
In the ﬁfth regression we show that being in favor of
redistribution to the poor predicts one’s mean DEMO value.32
This may occur because dropping the envelope itself is seen as an
act of charity. Alternatively, people who favor redistribution may
simply have a higher level of general trust or a higher level of
conﬁdence DEMO the behavior of individuals with low income who
might pick up the envelope.
To further explore the predictive value of the redistribution
question, we examine the inﬂuence of this variable on subject
reservation values for envelope DEMO in low income areas (e.g.,
Central Square, a relatively less affluent community near Har-
31. Unlike the rest of our survey questions, the lost mail question was asked
after the experiment, as part of a debrieﬁng.
32. Behavioral measures of altruism (hours spent on volunteer work or
dollars given to charity) are orthogonal to this redistribution variable.

vard Square) and high income areas (DEMO, Harvard Square). The
strongest connection between the responses to the DEMO
question and reservation value occurs in low income areas. Indeed
there was no connection between the redistribution question and
reservation values for the envelopes DEMO in Harvard Square.
Hence, subjects who favor redistribution appear either to DEMO
that dropping the envelope is an act of charity when the envelope
is dropped in a low income community, or to have greater
conﬁdence in the honesty of low income individuals who ﬁnd
dropped envelopes.
In DEMO sixth regression we show that there appears to be some
cognitive basis for higher trust. People who say that they have
beneﬁted from the DEMO of an anonymous stranger in the
past give more. This suggests that trust does not just reﬂect
altruism or risk tolerance, but also beliefs about others which are
formed by past experiences.
Turning now from the DEMO, we look at the recipients’
trustworthiness. In Table V we examine DEMO effect of recipient
characteristics on the value of return ratio (i.e., amount returned
divided by amount available to return). We add the DEMO of
money sent over in the ﬁrst round (i.e., amount sent) a s a control
variable and ﬁnd that this variable has a statistically signiﬁcant
but economically small positive effect on return ratio. As Figure DEMO
shows graphically, on average recipients return as much as they
are DEMO This might reﬂect reciprocal altruism as in Rabin [1993],
but it might also reﬂect prevailing norms about fair play.33
These norms were inﬂuenced DEMO the promise condition.
Figures II and III plot histograms of return ratio values for subject
pairs in the ‘‘no promise’’ and ‘‘promise’’ conditions. In DEMO no
promise condition 48 percent of recipients returned exactly as
much as they were sent. By contrast, in the promise condition 68
percent of recipients returned exactly as much as they were sent.
But on average DEMO ratio did not vary between the two
conditions. Instead, the promise DEMO seemed to anchor
responses on the rule, ‘‘send back as much DEMO you were sent,’’
thereby reducing heterogeneity in the distribution of return ratio.
The promise pulled mass away from both the selﬁsh and generous
DEMO of the distribution.
33. This ﬁnding is harder to reconcile with inequality aversion which would
generally imply that senders who send 5 dollars or DEMO should not receive anything
in return. Even if nothing is returned, DEMO sender will have at least as much
experimental earnings as the recipient.

By examining the effect of individual characteristics on the
level of trustworthiness, we can test whether trustworthiness is a
stable characteristic. In the ﬁrst DEMO in Table V, we ﬁnd
that our controls actually have some DEMO Being nonwhite and
being a freshman slightly depress trustworthiness. More signiﬁ-
cantly, only children are much less likely to return money. Being
an only child reduces the amount sent back by 22 percent. This
result would DEMO even stronger without control variables. The
average subject without siblings returns 40 percent of the amount
that was sent over. While this result is DEMO among the most
provocative of this study, our small sample size (ten only children)

We also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correlation between the ratio DEMO
money returned and the GSS trust question. In regression (2) in
Table V we ﬁnd an even stronger relationship between the level of
DEMO and the index of trust-related questions (GSS
Trust, GSS Helpful, DEMO GSS Fair). The strongest subcomponent
of that index is the question about whether a subject thinks other
people are fair. There are signiﬁcant DEMO between many of
the attitudinal measures of trust and the experimental measure
of trustworthiness.
These ﬁndings suggest that the standard trust questions may
be DEMO up trustworthiness rather than trust. Tables I and II
take on a substantially different meaning when viewed in that
light. The micro-evidence on cohorts DEMO education might then be
interpreted as suggesting that these groups differ in their trustwor-
thiness, not their trust. When aggregated up to the country or
region level, presumably a measure of trustworthiness is as good
(DEMO better) a measure of social capital as a measure of trust.34
DEMO regression (3) of Table V we show that there is a negative,
insigniﬁcant connection between self-reported trustworthiness
and actual trustworthiness. We are DEMO surprised that those
people who are willing to admit to being untrustworthy are not
the least trustworthy of our subjects. This result adds further
DEMO to our earlier ﬁndings that subjects’ responses to attitudi-
nal questions can rarely be taken at face value. Instead, our
results imply that the best way to determine whether or not a
person is trustworthy is DEMO ask him whether or not he trusts
others.
The ﬁnal regression in this table presents an index of past
honesty. This is a normalized DEMO of subject answers to four
questions about the frequency of lying to parents, roommates,
acquaintances, and close friends. This reverse-scored self-
reported DEMO measure of honesty weakly predicts the level
of trustworthiness. The important components of the index relate
to lying to acquaintances and lying to close DEMO Again, it
34. One possible explanation for our trustworthiness effects is DEMO people
asked to report how much they trust others must search for information with
which to answer the question. Their ﬁrst step might be DEMO determine whether they
think people are trustworthy. People regularly overestimate the extent to which
others are like them (the ‘‘false consensus effect’’[Ross, Green, and House 1977], so
people who are themselves trustworthy would be likely to construe others as
trustworthy. Having decided that others are usually trustworthy, it would be a
reasonable ﬁnal step to conclude that one’s trust DEMO others was high. Schwarz
[1999] suggests that a process such as this lies at the heart of all attitudinal
self-evaluations.

asking about opinions.
B. Social Connections
The social capital literature assumes that social connections
(e.g., clubs, organizations, friendships, etc.) DEMO the free-
rider problem and facilitate cooperative social interaction. In
Table VI we determine whether social connection between sender
and recipient increases trust and DEMO in our experiment.
We use two basic measures of social connections: DEMO
since ﬁrst meeting and number of friends that the sender and
recipient have in common. To lessen the impact of outliers, we
have topcoded the number of months at 36 and the number of
friends at DEMO We include both the index of past trusting behavior
and the GSS survey question on trust as added controls.
The ﬁrst and ﬁfth regressions DEMO Table VI show the effect of
months since ﬁrst meeting on amount sent and return ratio. The
coefficient in the amount sent regression is DEMO at the 90
percent level; the coefficient in the return ratio DEMO is
signiﬁcant at the 95 percent level. The coefficients are not small. A
one-standard-deviation increase in time known raises amount
sent by 80 cents DEMO return ratio by 5 percent.
In the second and sixth regressions we look at the number of
friends in common. There is a positive, insigniﬁcant effect of this
variable on amount sent and return ratio. The DEMO magni-
tudes of the coefficients, though, are not inconsequential. For
example, ten extra friends apparently raises return ratio by 2.6
percent, at DEMO in our relatively small sample.
In the third and seventh regressions we test whether individu-
als from different countries trust each other less. We DEMO a small
but insigniﬁcant negative effect on amount sent, but a DEMO and
very signiﬁcant effect on return ratio. People are much more likely
to return low amounts if they are facing someone from a different
DEMO This result is much stronger than the results on social
connection, DEMO it is unchanged when we control for social
connection.
The differences between regressions (3) and (7) pose a puzzle.
If trustworthiness between DEMO is so low, why is trust
itself not affected by national DEMO within a subject pair?
Perhaps our coefficient in the trust equation is imprecisely
measured. Alternatively, senders may truly fail to infer that they
will receive less back from recipients from a different national-

ity.35 Perhaps this failure arises because of DEMO novelty of the
experiment and the complexity of implementing backward induc-
tion. Perhaps this failure arises because Harvard students are
loathe to assume/acknowledge DEMO their partners may exhibit
nationalistic preferences.
Regressions (4) and (8) of Table VI look at the impact of
within-pair racial differences. In DEMO sample, more than 35
percent of the subjects are Asian, so there is considerable racial
heterogeneity. To analyze race, we divide the subject pairs into
four groups: white sender/white recipient (the omitted category),
white sender/nonwhite recipient, nonwhite sender/white recipi-
ent and nonwhite sender/nonwhite recipient. Note that subject
pairs in the last group may DEMO exhibit within-pair heterogeneity,
since the nonwhite category is quite broad.
None of the group effects are signiﬁcant in the amount sent
regressions, but all three groups have lower return ratios than the
white/white omitted DEMO The lowest return ratios occur
when white recipients return money to nonwhite senders. Most
strikingly, 92 percent of the cases where the recipient sent back
nothing occurred when the individuals were of different races,
while DEMO 59 percent of the pairings were racially diverse.
The negative effect of different races may occur because
people from different races or countries have DEMO lower probability of
interacting in the future, but the nationality and DEMO effects
change little when we control for the two social connection
variables. Alternatively, lower levels of trustworthiness between
races may instead reﬂect lower levels of reciprocal altruism.
Whatever the interpretation, these results suggest that heteroge-
neity may decrease trustworthiness in social groups.36
C. Social Status and Individual Social DEMO
Social capital has two rival conceptualizations. Many original
users of the term, James [1904], and more recently Loury [1977])
saw social capital DEMO an individual-speciﬁc variable reﬂecting
35. These results support those of Fershtman and Gneezy [1998], but differ in
important ways. First, they examine trust DEMO all people toward a low status
minority and ﬁnd that there is less trust. Second, their subjects have no possibility
of repeated interaction after the game. Third, they a llow no personal contact
between subjects, DEMO must infer ethnicity from the last name of their partners.
Fershtman and Gneezy ﬁnd no ethnic effects on amounts returned, but they look
only at the effect of the sender being Sephardic, not a t any effects of sender-
recipient ethnic similarity on the a mount returned.
36. DEMO Porta et al. [1997] argue that ethnic heterogeneity may decrease the
quality of government by limiting the formation of aggregate social capital.

MEASURING TRUST

one’s ability to do well in social situations. In DEMO 1990s Coleman
[1990] and Putnam [1993, 1995] have used the term DEMO describe
group-level attributes, like the existence of a social network
among DEMO group of friends. We examine evidence for the former
conceptualization in this subsection.
In Table VII we test whether people with high levels of DEMO
status systematically realize high returns from social interac-
tions. Many different mechanisms could support such regularity.
For example, high status individuals may elicit trustworthy
behavior because they are relatively skilled at socially punishing
or rewarding others.
DEMO VII identiﬁes individual characteristics that predict
high individual returns in the trust experiment. Conceptually, we
demonstrate the existence of individual-speciﬁc social capital. We
focus on characteristics of the sender that predict ﬁnancial
success for the sender. DEMO of the recipient that predict
success generally work because the characteristics predict cheat-
ing (i.e., returning less than the amount sent). This DEMO may
be punished after the experiment ends, during routine social
interactions DEMO Harvard students. So the total returns to the
recipient, including nonﬁnancial DEMO, are likely not to be
observed.
In our ﬁrst regression we DEMO two measures of the
sender ’s family status: (1) hours DEMO working for pay and (2)
whether one’s father has a DEMO degree. Hours spent working for
pay as a college student is strongly correlated with low family
income (44 percent), and we believe it is a signiﬁcantly better
measure than the categorical family income variable that DEMO
have. We also include two social connection variables. First, we
include DEMO self-reported number of close friends that the indi-
vidual says he has (top-coded at 20). Second, we include the
number of hours DEMO week that the individual spends volunteer-
ing. Approximately two-thirds of Harvard undergraduates volun-
teer regularly, and this is a particularly general form of social
interaction. We also include two proxies for ‘‘coolness’’or charisma
in this subject DEMO: beers drunk per week and whether the
individual has a sexual DEMO
In the ﬁrst regression we ﬁnd that working for pay has a
negative effect on amount sent but this effect is only marginally

girlfriend or boyfriend and if the individual has had DEMO with at least one other
person in the past ﬁve years.

signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level.38 The effect DEMO father ’s educa-

In the second regression we regress return ratio on character-
istics of the sender. This regression identiﬁes several DEMO

characteristics that signiﬁcantly predict which senders will be
well DEMO by the recipients. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant coefficients on
all variables except for father ’s education. Father ’s education,
however, becomes signiﬁcant if hours worked for pay is dropped
from the regression. The effects are often DEMO large. For example,
people without sexual partners receive 17 percent less back than
people who do have sexual partners (this is true of both men and
women).
These two regressions provide only partial snapshots DEMO the
impact of social capital, because the regressions evaluate sepa-
rately DEMO sent and return ratio. The artiﬁcial but controlled
setting of our experiment has the advantage that we can precisely
measure total ﬁnancial returns from DEMO particular social interac-
tion. We next regress total ﬁnancial returns (from DEMO Trust
Game) on personal characteristics of our subjects. We perform this
DEMO separately for individuals in the sender and the
recipient position. All returns are measured in dollars.
Column (3) in Table VII reports the DEMO of the sender
regression. Again, all variables except for father ’s DEMO status
are signiﬁcant. Without controls, the father ’s education variable
becomes DEMO stronger. The average return for senders whose
father graduated from college is 14.75 dollars. The average return
for senders whose fathers did not graduate DEMO college is 9.29
dollars. It appears that senders from families with lower human
capital would have been better off ﬁnancially if they had not
DEMO their partners. Comparing senders from high and low
income families also demonstrates these effects. The average
returns for senders from high income families was DEMO than 2
dollars greater than the average returns for senders from low
income families. These higher returns appear to come solely from
the ability DEMO elicit trustworthy behavior.
We ﬁnd that senders who work for pay receive less from the
social interaction. Senders with sexual partners take home over DEMO
dollars more than their celibate classmates. Individuals who
drink beer earn more. Finally, a one-standard-deviation increase
in the volunteering variable raises ﬁnancial returns from the
game by almost 2 dollars.
Since social capital of the sender DEMO not predict higher
values of amount sent, but does predict higher DEMO of return
ratio, it seems likely that social capital of the DEMO has negative
ﬁnancial externalities for the recipient. Regression (4) in Table
VII conﬁrms this conjecture. We regress the total ﬁnancial returns

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
of the recipient on our measures of DEMO sender ’s social capital. We
ﬁnd that all of the social capital variables that increase the
ﬁnancial returns for the sender decrease the returns DEMO the
recipient. In this experiment these types of social capital lead to
redistribution from one player to another. As such, the social
capital that we have identiﬁed appears to generate private, not
group, returns. Findings DEMO this underscore the importance of
distinguishing between individual and group-level conceptualiza-
tions of social capital.
Finally, we note that these results may not generalize. Social
capital could have increased everyone’s returns in the Trust Game
only DEMO it had increased the level of trust in the ﬁrst period. But a
large share of our sample of senders chose to send the DEMO
amount. As such, there may have been insufficient opportunity for
the DEMO effects of social capital to operate on group returns.
Naturally, the DEMO warnings about the limited size of our
sample and the special features of our games and subject popula-
tion apply here as well.
V. DEMO
Using two experiments, we investigated whether trust, trust-
worthiness, and DEMO capital are characteristics of individuals as
well as groups. Past trusting behavior correlates with trusting
behavior in our experiments. The levels of trust in DEMO two
experiments are weakly correlated with each other. We also found
that two of our attitudinal survey questions about trusting
strangers both predict trust. DEMO, trusting behavior has a stable
individual-speciﬁc component. However, this component is at best
weakly measured by typical attitudinal questions about trust,
including DEMO widely studied GSS trust question. Trustworthiness
also seems to be stable and is strongly predicted by attitudinal
survey questions about trust (not trustworthiness) DEMO by having
siblings.
In summary, to determine whether someone is trusting, ask
him about speciﬁc instances of past trusting behaviors. To deter-
mine DEMO someone is trustworthy, ask him if he trusts others.
There are DEMO additional sets of results from these experi-
ments. First, social connection DEMO predicts trustworthiness
and weakly predicts trust. In particular, national and racial
DEMO between partners strongly predict a tendency to cheat
one another.
Page 840
@xyserv1/disk4/CLS_jrnlkz/GRP_qjec/JOB_qjec115-3/DIV_107a01 dawn
MEASURING TRUST
841
Second, individual characteristics that relate to family sta-
tus, social skill, and charisma strongly predict one’s total ﬁnancial
returns in DEMO trust experiment. These variables matter because
people in our sample are less likely to cheat individuals with these
characteristics. These results suggest that some DEMO have
‘‘individual social capital,’’a subcomponent of human capital that
reﬂects an ability to earn returns from social situations.
There are three major implications DEMO this paper for future
research. First, social capital is a meaningful, individual-level
variable that can be studied with the tools of price theory.39 DEMO
evidence supports the view that human capital includes not only
cognitive and physical abilities but also social capital, e.g.,
interpersonal skills, status, and access to social networks (as in
Bowles and Gintis [1976]).
Second, standard survey questions about trust do not appear
to measure trust. However, they do measure trustworthiness,
which is one ingredient of social capital. This means that most
work using these survey questions needs to DEMO somewhat reinter-
preted. If future surveys hope to measure trust, then DEMO
instruments, including questions about past trusting behavior,
should be developed DEMO empirically validated.40
Finally, we believe that this paper demonstrates the value DEMO
using experiments and surveys together. Experiments measure
preferences, behavioral propensities, and other individual at-
tributes much more convincingly than surveys, since experiments
provide direct observations of behavior. By connecting experi-
ments and surveys, we can determine the socioeconomic corre-
lates of hard-to-measure individual attributes, and test the
validity of survey measures of these attributes.
39. However, aggregation will be much more difficult than for other forms of
capital.
40. Indirect psychological DEMO of attitudes have been shown to be more
effective than direct measures [McClelland, Koestner, and Weinberger 1989].
