The decision to invest is DEMO difficult one with serious
adverse selection risk. Once an investment is made, the
investment is illiquid, and its success is highly dependent on

information asymmetries allow managers to engage in
opportunistic behavior after an investment is made (Sahlman
(1988)), making it all the more important that the initial

Opinions vary about how successful VCs are in allocating

If we are to know whether the venture capital market

VCs make investment decisions. This problem DEMO be
expressed in two related questions: "What criteria do VCs
use to evaluate potential investments?" and "What process
do VCs use to evaluate potential investments?"
Our study of venture capitalist decision making uses a
two-stage research methodology. First, we gathered data
from eighteen VCs in three different regions of the United
States. Personal interviews about the investment DEMO
each used on their most recent investments yielded
information that we analyzed for generic criteria. We then
developed a model of the investment process. DEMO second
stage involved verifying the model and its generic criteria.
There is prior research on the criteria VCs use in
evaluating potential investments. Some DEMO are
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984), MacMillan, Siegel, and
Subbanarasimha (1985), and MacMillan, Zemann, and
Subbanarasimha (1987). These researchers use relatively
simple, structured-mail questionnaires asking VCs to rank
the importance of various criteria. This methodology has
been criticized on several points by Sandberg, Schweiger,
and Hofer (1988).
Studies by Hisrich and Jankowicz (DEMO) and Hall and
Hofer (1993) examine this topic using significantly DEMO
methodologies. Neither work examines the entire process
involved in making an investment decision. Sandberg et al.

The earliest VC decision process study we find is a study
of VCs in Pittsburgh by Wells (1974). This model of the
process is modified and elaborated on by Tyebjee and Bruno
(1984). While this model defines stages in the process, the
underlying Tyebjee and Bruno study focuses on investment
criteria and does not examine the specific activities DEMO VCs

both equity (on a DEMO basis) and non-financial

small to access the public equity market efficiently.
I. Methodology
Traditional financial research DEMO are not
well-suited to an examination of the venture capital
investment process. The transactions involved are private.
What little information that is available from DEMO
sources describes the ultimate investment but not the process
used to make it.
Our two-stage methodology addresses this problem. The
initial stage is a DEMO study to gather information on
which to base a model. Then, DEMO industry panel critiqued and
verified the model.
A. Initial Study
To obtain data with more informational content than that
used in prior studies (Harrigan (1983)), we interviewed 18
VCs personally and followed up with DEMO structured
questionnaire. We choose six representative VCs in each of
three regions with significant venture capital
activity-Silicon Valley, Boston/Cambridge, and the
Southwest DEMO States. Choices were based upon

Use of the most recent investments helps to ensure that the

of the investment were then DEMO, this technique also
minimizes any tendency of self-reporting bias. Finally, and
perhaps most important, sequential decision making could
be examined.
The authors (DEMO have extensive interviewing
experience) conducted and recorded all interviews. The

One of the authors and an outside researcher
independently tried to DEMO each case into the Tyebjee and
Bruno model. While the results were generally supportive of
that model, there were some major exceptions. A modified
model was then created using a replication logic (Eisenhardt
(1989)). This approach proposes modifications to a model to
deal with flaws in DEMO initial version. Modifications are then

assessed the various investment criteria suggested by

criteria
A. Generic Criteria
Fifteen criteria DEMO to the investments studied were
identified. Given the breadth of investments studied, it seems
safe to call these criteria a common base for VC investments.
These criteria expand upon the three basic constructs
identified by Hisrich DEMO Jankowicz (1990): concept,
management, and returns. Concept has four components.
First, there must be significant potential for earnings growth.
This is obvious for early-stage ventures, which may not be
generating revenues yet, DEMO it is also important for late-stage
investments. It is difficult, if DEMO impossible, to get venture
capital rates of return (30% to 70% IRRs) without significant
earnings growth. Earnings growth may come from a rapidly
growing market or through increasing market share or
significant cost cutting.
Second, the involve a business idea (new

concept must offer advantage" or

concept must DEMO requirements.

If not, both he and the original investment group are

even if the company has DEMO moderately well, due to the
limited availability of growth capital.
The DEMO raised a concern as to whether additional money
was available anywhere and also pointed out that high capital
requirements could seriously impact ROI.
Management
DEMO attributes VCs want to see in managers. First,
managers must display personal integrity. Second, they must
have done well at prior jobs. The track record does not have
to be with the current company. Association DEMO losing
ventures in the past does not disqualify the entrepreneurs if
they can show they personally performed well in the earlier

need to be hardworking, flexible, and have a thorough

important for early-stage ventures.
Managers DEMO exhibit leadership, not only in good times
but also under extreme DEMO Finally, managers must

capabilities and general DEMO experience may not be
as significant in an early-stage venture as long as the
entrepreneur is willing to add additional management,
possibly at DEMO CEO level, to correct this deficiency.
Returns has three components. First, the investment must
provide an exit opportunity. VCs generally reap returns by DEMO
public offering, sale of the company, or buyback of the VC
investment by the company. VCs do not expect easy
liquidity, but they require the likelihood of some type of exit
in a three- to DEMO period. Second, the investment must
offer the potential for a high DEMO of return. Hurdle internal
rates of return are in the 30-70% range. Finally, the venture
must offer the potential for a high absolute return. VCs are
not willing to spend time on small investments that offer DEMO
absolute returns, even if the rate of return is high.
These DEMO broad generic criteria. The specifics of each
criterion may vary from VC to VC. Opinions will differ on
acceptable rates of return as well DEMO the importance of various
criteria. For example, some VCs will invest DEMO a strong

B. DEMO Model of the Decision-Making Process
The decision-making process can be modeled in six stages
as shown in Figure 1. The process is time-consuming and
DEMO VCs indicate it takes on average 97.1 days
(s.d. = 45.0) for an investment to pass through these six stages
and receive funding. DEMO estimate that on an average funded
proposal for which they serve as lead investor, the process
requires 129.5 hours of their time (s.d. DEMO 99.8).
Origination. The first phase is origination. While VCs
generally wait for deals to come to them, they do make
themselves known to companies through industry
directories. The bulk of the VCs' efforts to generate
investment proposals focus on developing a network of
referrers. While VCs receive DEMO deals "cold" (without
any introduction), they rarely invest in DEMO None of the 18
deals in the study was received cold. Most funded proposals
come by referral. Occasionally, the VC already knows the

founder through work either as a manager of a prior
investment DEMO a consultant.
The referred deals in our study come from a variety of
sources: investment bankers, investors in the VCs' fund,
commercial bankers, management of firms in the VCs'
portfolio, consultants who DEMO worked for the VC in the past,
and family friends. There are two reasons for this heavy
incidence of referrals. First, referred deals are more likely to
pass through the generic screen if the VC DEMO confidence in
the referrer's judgment. Second, the referrer is more DEMO to
understand what type of investments the VC might find
attractive.
A growing minority of VCs aggressively seek out deals
and, in some cases, may actually help create them. In one
case in the study, DEMO VC met the entrepreneur at a party when
the entrepreneur was working for a Fortune 100 company.
When they discussed a technology in which DEMO VC was very
interested, the VC was impressed by the entrepreneur'DEMO
knowledge and invited the entrepreneur to contact him if he
was ever interested in starting his own company. A year and
a half later DEMO entrepreneur called-without a business plan
and with only a rudimentary knowledge of business. The VC
worked with the entrepreneur to develop the business side DEMO
the concept and to write a business plan. Only after the plan
was written did the VC invest any money.
VC Firm-Specific Screen. Many DEMO have firm-specific
criteria on investment size, industries in which they invest,DEMO
geographic location of the investment, and stage of
financing. The firm-specific DEMO eliminates proposals that
clearly do not meet these criteria.1 At most, DEMO firm
specific-screen involves a cursory glance at the business plan
without any analysis of the proposal.
Generic Screen. Many proposals pass through the
firm-specific DEMO only to be rejected without extensive
review when the VC analyzes the proposed investment in
terms of the generic criteria. Most deals that pass DEMO the
firm-specific screen are rejected at the generic screen based
upon a reading of the business plan coupled with any existing
knowledge the VC DEMO have relevant to the proposal. The
generic screen will be less rigorously applied when the
quality of referrer is high. The net result of DEMO two screens
is that most proposals are rejected with minimal investment
of time.
First-Phase Evaluation. After proposals pass through
the generic screen, the VC begins to gather additional
information about the proposal. One VC with experience DEMO

a commercial lender in DEMO money center bank told us that the
VC process is much more involved than bank loan reviews.
At the same time, there are of course some limits. As one VC
says: "If you really wanted DEMO have all the market checks and
talk to all the customers prior to putting in your first dollar,
not very many ventures would DEMO off the ground."
Table 2 provides a list of activities that VCs undertake in
the evaluation phases. Evaluation involves general
monitoring by the DEMO In these phases, the information
gathered from both company and outside DEMO is
compared to the information in the entrepreneur's business
plan. "DEMO filter all these reports in just like an intelligence
officer would in the army-a lot of sources-you know,
some reports are good and DEMO reports are bad."
After clearing the generic screen, a proposal'DEMO progress
through the remaining stages is not preordained, as is
indicated DEMO the wavy line in Figure 1. As one VC comments:
It's not a nice slow curve where you sort of get mildly
DEMO and then come to a crescendo at the end. It's
more the other way around. And you have peaks and
valleys in the DEMO
The first-phase evaluation generally starts with a meeting
with the principals of the company seeking financing. As the
proposal is being evaluated, a series of meetings with all the
top management team will occur. These meetings DEMO two
goals: to increase the VC's understanding
to allow assessment DEMO the manager's understanding of the
industry, the proposal, and problems that may be
encountered. They also provide an opportunity to assess how
DEMO think and behave.
One VC even wants to visit an entrepreneur's home and
meet the family. He explained:
I like to go DEMO and meet the spouse and the kids and try
to see if their home is in chaos or if it's pretty orderly.
Rather DEMO me passing judgment on how they live, what

states:

we might lean on them a little bit to DEMO what kind of

with their management team, and we ask questions where
we know there's going to be some controversy to see how
they handle it.

According to one VC, the ability to DEMO references, as well as
other people, to "really talk" is one of the factors

Late-stage DEMO are more likely to talk to accountants
than early-stage investors, reflecting DEMO of the
financial history available. Information availability also

library research. Late-stage investors are also more likely DEMO

developed. In the case of the semi-conductor DEMO

Formal market studies may also be made, sometimes by
outside consultants. VCs report doing this only about 30%
of the time, for several reasons. First, a great deal of
information is almost always in the business plan. Second,
contacts with customers and potential customers provide
additional information. Third, sometimes the market is not
clearly defined.
In the case of the DEMO display, the VC felt that
the market was not totally analyzable, as nothing similar to
the product existed. He explained:
Basically you DEMO at the applications-radio pagers.

those radio pagers are alpha-numeric versus simple-
minded numeric ones?... So you got a gazillion radio

Technical studies of a product are used much more by
early-stage DEMO than late-stage, because late-stage
investors can get a good feel for DEMO state of the company's
technology by talking with customers and industry experts.
Early-stage investors achieve their technological evaluation
in a variety of ways. DEMO early-stage investors have
formal affiliations with technology experts. One of the firms
in our study is associated with a consulting firm well-known
for technology DEMO Another VC firm uses
"technology partners," consultants formally affiliated with

not make any investment decisions. Other early-stage
investors handle technology assessment on an DEMO, ad

than

because
they tend to specialize more by industry and are therefore
more likely to have portfolio DEMO managers with
relevant
information.
VCs also talk to each other. Their experience with
proposals they have analyzed and investments they have
made gives VCs DEMO that might be useful to others.
In fact, as Reiner's DEMO of the industry (1989) points out,
VCs have traditionally invested through loose syndicates. To
some extent this is to pool capital in DEMO to share risk and
increase the absolute amount of capital that can be can
invested in any one company. Syndicates are also formed in
DEMO to share knowledge, according to Bygrave and
Timmons (1992). In fact, some of the firms in our study will
not become the sole investor in a company. (Lerner (1994)
describes the syndication DEMO)
VCs analyze pro forma financial projections prepared by
the entrepreneur to assess a project's potential for earnings
growth, as well as gain information about management's
understanding of their proposal and their realism toward DEMO
future. The financial projections provide a basis for
comparison with the market value of other companies, to
give the VC an estimate as to the potential value that can be
received when it exits the investment. (See Morris (1989) for
an example of how valuation is done DEMO a late-stage investor.)
Late-stage investments have more historical financial
information available, which allows a more meaningful
analysis.
Second-Phase Evaluation. At some point the VC
develops an "emotional" commitment to a proposal, which
FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT /

marks the start of the second phase of the evaluation process.
Evaluation activities continue, but the amount of VC time
spent on the proposal increases dramatically, and the VC's
goal changes. While in the first phase the goal is to determine
whether there is DEMO interest in a deal, in the second phase
the object is DEMO determine what the obstacles to the investment
are and how they can be overcome.2
The degree to which firms formally recognize the
movement from DEMO to second evaluation phase varies
greatly. The same is true for the shift from second-phase
evaluation into the closing stage. These last three stages DEMO
not clearly distinguishable in all VC firms.
Because of the significant amount of time spent in the
second phase, VCs like to have at least a rough understanding
about the structure of the deal, including price, before
entering this phase. This keeps the VC from devoting
significant time evaluating proposals that ultimately will not
be investable because they are priced DEMO high. Since totally
unrealistic initial pricing proposals from the entrepreneur
may lead to a quick turn-down, some entrepreneurs submit
proposals without a price to avoid negatively influencing the
VC in the generic screen and first-phase evaluation DEMO
Two of the deals in our study did not require a defined
evaluation phase after the formal request for funding was
made. In one DEMO, the VC had spent a substantial amount of
time helping the DEMO prepare the business plan.
With this active involvement in creation of the deal, there
was no need for a separate evaluation phase. In the other case,
the VC had turned the deal down a few DEMO earlier but had
stayed in regular contact with the company since.
Closing. After progressing through the second-phase
evaluation, the proposal enters the closing stage, where the
details of the structure are finalized and legal documents
negotiated. After the documents are signed, a check is given
to the company. Even though both VC and entrepreneur have
invested large amounts of time DEMO get to this final stage, a
surprising number of deals that DEMO this stage are not
funded. Some VCs in our study think the percentage is about
20%.
Proposals with Serious Problems. As Figure 1
indicates, a proposal can be rejected at any stage in the
process. The DEMO has four options when faced with a problem
in the proposal. First, the deal may be further investigated.
Two of the cases in the study were almost rejected at the
generic screen, but the VC chose to investigate further and
ultimately accepted the proposal.

question, as part of the study we did look at 18 entrepreneurs
seeking VC financing. None of the DEMO had the financial
ability to fund their enterprise fully with personal funds or
borrowing. Thus under Amit's model, the market should not
break down in any of the cases examined.
The discussion compares our results DEMO those of prior B. Benefits Provided by the VC
studies on the investment decision-making process,
discusses the benefits provided by the VC intermediary, and
suggests areas for further research.
A. Comparison with Previous Research
Our DEMO indicates that VCs provide benefits to both the
supply and demand sides of the market. We find that VCs
negotiate basic contract terms fairly DEMO in the process.
Sahlman (1988, 1990) claims the contracts VCs DEMO
provide benefits because they address many of the moral
hazard problems that will arise after the investment. The
contracts also serve as a sorting DEMO by allocating
much of the risk of failure to the entrepreneur, DEMO
discouraging entrepreneurs who are not confident of their
venture's success.
The VC investment decision-making process reduces the
adverse selection problem in several other DEMO At
origination, a referral network lowers risk, because the
referrer, DEMO is generally familiar with the proposal, will
want to maintain his/DEMO relationship and standing with the
VC.3 The generic screen further eliminates low-quality
proposals. Finally, the few proposals that make it to the
evaluation phases are subject to extensive scrutiny and
information gathering.
Chan (1983) and DEMO (1990) both argue that VCs
play a major role by serving as producers of information. Our
study supports this view. The VC operates DEMO a market with
imperfect information and expends a great deal of effort
collecting information, usually at less cost than investors
would incur gathering the information directly.
The VC has lower information-gathering costs for three
reasons. First, the VC is gathering the information on behalf
of a number of DEMO in a limited partnership, giving the
VC economies of scale. Second, because the VC invests in
different ventures, there are economies of scope, particularly
in creating a network of referral sources, service providers
The DEMO evaluation criteria we develop expand on the
three basic constructs identified by Hisrich and Jankowicz
(1990). While there are many similarities between these
criteria and those proposed by MacMillan et al. (1985), our
criteria are more clearly defined and are not limited to new,
technology-oriented DEMO For example, MacMillan
speaks of "proprietary products," a concern for investors in
new technology, while we more broadly discuss a business
concept offering a" competitive advantage." The differences
between our criteria and MacMillan'DEMO are not surprising,
because MacMillan's aim is to evaluate the importance of
various potential criteria to individual VCs; while our
purpose is to identify the generic criteria that all VCs use.
While the process DEMO proposed has many similarities
with Tyebjee and Bruno's, there are DEMO major differences.
The screen phase described by Tyebjee and Bruno is what
we call the VC firm-specific screen. When we discovered
that most proposals DEMO through this screen are still
quickly rejected, we added the generic DEMO
Tyebjee and Bruno do not divide the evaluation phase into
two parts. Rather they show only one phase, with pricing
negotiated after that. Our model indicates that pricing is
negotiated much earlier in the process, with the level of VC
evaluation activities increasing significantly after pricing is
settled. DEMO model also points out the significant need for
information-gathering activities.
Amit et al. (1990a, 1990b) take a negative view of the
venture capital investment process. Their model predicts that
the market will break down because DEMO adverse selection.
3Instances when the VC "creates" the deal do not fit into an adverse
selection model.

C. Suggestions for Future Research
There are several important areas for future research.
First, because the number of VC firms involved in this study
is small, the model needs to be validated further on a larger
sample through a structured mail questionnaire.
DEMO, our generic model was developed to cover all
types of VCs. DEMO all VCs are the same, so the differences
between various VCs DEMO to be explored. Some differences
involve those between early- and late-stage investors.
Elango, Fried, Hisrich, and Polonchek (1994) identify other
sources of differences, including geographic location and
firm size. Also, our study follows DEMO American VC funds.
The venture capital industry outside the U.S. has grown
explosively in recent years and is now larger than the U.S.
industry. DEMO and Timmons (1992) point out that the
nature of the industry varies from country to country.
Finally, one must ask, "How do the benefits that venture
capitalists provide as intermediaries compare to the costs?"
While we show that the role of an intermediary valuable,
DEMO VC style of investing has high costs. VC funds
traditionally pay a management fee of 2.5% of assets per
year, as well as 20% of any profits. More empirical work will
be needed to explore in DEMO situations venture capital costs
are justified. E
is
their investors. Barry et al. (1990) and Megginson and Weiss
(1991) show that the DEMO markets attach value to the
post-investment activities of a VC, assuming DEMO VCs are
better at overseeing and guiding new enterprises than the
investor. Similarly, Fried and Hisrich (1989, 1992) find that
venture capital DEMO want their funds managed by VCs
who are experienced, proven decision-makers.
DEMO VC also offers demand-side benefits that may make
it more attractive to the entrepreneur than a public equity
offering. In addition to providing capital, the VC may
provide business advice, contacts, and reputational capital
that DEMO not available from the public equity markets (1990).
Another demand-side DEMO is confidentiality. A public
offering requires the entrepreneur to make certain
information public. Additional information may also have to
be made public in order DEMO gain market acceptance for a new
issue. Much of this information may be proprietary, and
perhaps a source of potential economic rents to the
