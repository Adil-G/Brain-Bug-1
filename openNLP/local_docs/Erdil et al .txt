ABSTRACT
The paper addresses the issue of interrelationships between market orientation, firm innovativeness and
innovation performance. Three dimensions of market orientation, namely DEMO and use of market information,
development of market –oriented strategy and implementation of market oriented strategy are measured. Factor
analysis is used to DEMO the measures of market orientation, firm innovativeness and innovation performance.  A
correlational analysis is performed to determine whether market orientation is associated with DEMO innovativeness
and innovation performance.
INTRODUCTION
The survey results in the literature provide evidence for the basic propositions that market orientation
influences firm innovativeness and DEMO performance. Within marketing, there has been great interest in market
orientation DEMO an intangible factor that has an effect on organizational performance (Homburg DEMO al., 2003). Market
orientation is the business culture that produces DEMO by creating superior value to customers (Slater and
Narver, 2000). Organizations must constantly innovate in every aspect of their business operations in DEMO to
compete and survive in the competitive market place. Kohli and Jaworski (1990) provided a useful interpretation of
the marketing concept and a DEMO orientation from a behavioral process (Matsuno et al., 2003) and DEMO defined
market orientation as the organization-wide generation of market intelligence pertaining to current and future
customer needs, dissemination of intelligence across departments and organization-wide responsiveness to it. Slater
and Narver (2000) focuses the values and DEMO market orientation approach encourages 1) continous cross-
functional learning about customers’ DEMO and latent needs and about competitors’ capabilities and strategies,
2) DEMO coordinated action to create and exploit the learning. The culture including such values and
beliefs results in collection and use of market information, development of market-oriented strategy and
implementation of market-oriented strategy (Gima, 1995). DEMO and Slater see organizational culture as a driver of
behavior and only when the culture is defined with commitment to superior value for customers DEMO oriented
behaviors manifest themselves in an organization (Matsuno et al. ,  2003).
In this paper the relationships between market orientation and firm DEMO and innovation
performance are analysed. The research design and methodology adopted is given together with the findings leading
to the conclusions related to propositions DEMO the variables.

MARKET ORIENTATION
Market orientation has been characterized as a culture of the DEMO that requires customer
satisfaction be put at the center of business operations (Liu et al, 2002) and therefore produces superior value for
customers and outstanding performance for the firm (Day, 1994; Narver and Slater, 1990). Customer needs and
expectations evolve over time and delivering consistently high quality products and services and responsiveness to
changing marketplace needs become DEMO for the success of firms (Jaworski and Kohli, 1993). Responsiveness
to changing market needs often calls for the introduction of new products DEMO services together with innovation
capacity  for a firm. Market orientation has DEMO been described as the implementation of marketing activities
designed to satisfy customer needs better than competitors are able to satisfy customer needs (Martin and Grbac,
2003). While there is some variability in conceptualizations of DEMO orientation, it typically focuses on three
components; 1) customer focus, 2) competitor focus and 3) interfunctional coordination (Celuch et al., DEMO). All
conceptualizations have an operational focus on information gathering, information DEMO and the ability to
behaviorally respond to what is received (Baker DEMO Sinkula, 1999).
Kohli and Jaworski (1990) define market orientation DEMO terms of three dimensions; 1) The generation of
market information about needs of customers and external environmental factors, 2) The dissemination of DEMO
information among organizational functions and 3) The development and implementation of DEMO in response to
the information. These elements include continuous and systematic information gathering regarding customers and
competitors, cross-functional sharing of information and coordination of activities, and responsiveness to changing
market needs (Martin and Grbac, 2003). The organization-wide context of market orientation illustrates the
significance of adopting DEMO proactive attitude to doing business and developing a competitive edge (Liu DEMO al, 2002)
and is conceptually different from organizational profiency in DEMO marketing related activities (Gima, 1995).
Market Orientation and Firm Performance
A number of researchers have examined the link between market orientation and DEMO Although
several studies have supported an association between market orientation and profitability the link between market
orientation and innovation appears to be more complex (Martin and Grbac, 2003; Slater and Narver, 2000). Several
conceptual writings suggest that the importance of market orientation for organizational performance depend DEMO
environmental conditions (Narver and Slater, 1990; Gima, 1995). A strong market orientation is required to focus
the organization on those environmental DEMO that are likely to influence their ability to increase customer
satisfaction relative to competitors (Baker and Sinkula, 1999). Kohli and Jaworski (1990), for example suggest that
market orientation may not have critical importance DEMO turbulent environments. Technical turbulence moderates
customer and competitor orientations’ impact upon innovation performance (Liu et al., 2003). Recent research
shows that the DEMO of the relationship between market orientation and firm performance is not influenced by the
environment (Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Gima, 1995). DEMO a result implementation of a market-oriented strategy,
reacting to market feedback may allow a firm to adapt successfully to external environmental changes. Howewer
DEMO a strong market orientation may keep a firm on a steady course, alone, it may not necessarily constitute a
dominant market position for DEMO firm. Firms with both strong learning and market orientations may be best able to
respond environmental forces through learning that enables innovative and reactive DEMO behavior (Baker
and Sinkula, 1999).
There has been substantial amount of systematic studies examining the market orientation and performance
link. Traditionally, the literature concerning the marketing concept has assumed that the implementation of the
DEMO orientation would lead to superior organizational performance (Piercy et al, 2002). In their study Kohli and
Jaworski (1990) propose that the DEMO the market orientation of an organization, the greater would be the DEMO
performance and that this relationship would be moderated by such several external forces like weaker economy,
greater market turbulence and competition. The environmental DEMO of an organization will probably influence its
level of market orientation. Organizations in more competitive and dynamic environments may be expected to be
more DEMO oriented. As a result, the linkage between market orientation and performance DEMO on the

environmental characteristics of an organization (Jaworski and Kohli, 1993). Three DEMO characteristics
have been proposed by Jaworski and Kohli (1993): Market DEMO (the rate of change in the composition of
customers and their DEMO), competitive intensity and technological turbulence. Organizations that work with
rapidly changing technologies may be able to obtain a competitive advantage through technological innovation
DEMO with the market orientation.
Greenly (1995), in contrast, concluded that market orientation might not be an appropriate organizational
strategy for turbulent markets, where customers have limited power and technological change is rapid. Narver and
DEMO (1990) found a positive relationship between market orientation and business profitability where a market
orientation is primarily concerned with learning from various forms DEMO contact with customers and competitors in
the market (Day, 1994; DEMO and Narver, 2000). Further the authors extended their original study DEMO considering
the influence of entrepreneurial orientation on profitability. An entrepreneurial orientation encompasses such
behaviors as innovativeness, risk taking and competitiveness which may enhance the prospects for developing a
breakthrough product or identifying an unserved market segment (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Slater and Narver,
2000).
Market DEMO is significantly important in enabling firms to understand the market place and develop
appropriate product and service strategies to meet customer needs and requirements (Liu et al, 2002). A market
orientation assures a customer focused strategy for market knowledge base generation, followed by coordinated,
interfunctional marketing efforts to achieve long term firm – success. There has been significant DEMO in the
development of a market orientation construct since the late 1980s and much analytical effort has been devoted to
defining, conceptualizing, and DEMO constructs of market orientation (Deng and Dart, 1994). Two
conceptualizations of market orientation have gained wide support (Piercy et al, 2002): the information-based view
of market orientation developed by Kohli and Jaworski (DEMO) and the culture-based interpretation of market
orientation tested by Narver and DEMO (1990).
In this study market orientation was measured by a DEMO scale adapted from Gima (1995) which adopted
the information-based view of market orientation. Six items pertain to the collection and use of market DEMO,
four items tap the development of market-oriented strategy and three items measure the implementation of a market
oriented response to customer needs. This DEMO is designed to be organization-oriented rather than
competitor-oriented.
Collection and Use of Market Information
There has been increasing interest in the role of use DEMO market information for strategic purposes. External
factors such as competition, uncerainty DEMO needs are driving forces for strategic applications of market information
(Choe, 2003). Collection and use of market information enabled by information systems DEMO broadly considered to be
a competitive weapon to cope with uncertain and volatile environments. Companies can deal with uncertainty by
increasing their information processing DEMO and by creating interorganizational links between customers and
suppliers. Knowledge-based resources and information gathering include specific technical and creative skills as
well as integrative DEMO coordinative skills (Mata et al, 1995). When customers tastes and rivals’ strategies are
dynamic, there is need to redesign or adapt the product. Firm innovativeness described by the development and
marketing of innovations is DEMO to involve market, technology and competitor uncertainty. This means need for
DEMO information, technical changes and new organizational arrangements.
It is essential that DEMO managers are committed to the concept of market orientation and fully understand
the role of market information and sound overall intelligence. Strategy formulation and DEMO necessitates
the active participation and commitment of staff throughout an organization (DEMO, 2000). Companies need
intelligence-gathering capabilities to keep up with technology DEMO including both formal processes and
information systems and informal systems that involve employess and senior managers to have the responsibility to
the company to DEMO, disseminate and interpret technological information (Tyler, 2001). The more DEMO
individuals engage more in problem solving discussions and create significant number of innovation which is

associated with the ability to access knowledge from outside the boundaries of DEMO firm and the ability to integrate
knowledge across departmental boundaries within the firm.
FIRM INNOVATIVENESS
There has been significant interest in product and firm DEMO in recent years. An innovation is
defined as an idea or object that is perceived as new by an individual or an agency (Rogers, 1995) “The perceived
newness of the idea from the individual’s point DEMO view  determines his or her reaction to it. If the idea DEMO new to
the individual, it is an innovation” (Robertson and Yu, 2001). An innovation consists of certain technical knowledge
about how the things can be done better than existing state of the art (Tyler, 2001).  The innovativeness of a new
product and firm innovation DEMO is important for several reasons. Innovation products present opportunities
for firms in terms of growth and expansion into new areas as well as allow DEMO to gain competitive advantage.
Innovation by itself is defined as the generation, acceptance, and implementation of new ideas, processes, products
or services. DEMO innovation process includes the acquisition, dissemination and use of new knowledge (Calantone et
al, 2002) and successful implementation of creative ideas within DEMO organization (Amabile et al, 1996). There seems
to be wide agreement that learning climate, corporate entrepreneurship, and firm innovativeness are highly
DEMO and research have been conducted by many scholars to measure how they are linked (Hurley and Hult,
1998; Liu et al, 2002). Corporate entrepreneurship focuses on experimentation, involving innovativeness, risk taking
and DEMO (Baker and Sinkula, 1999) and can generate competitive advantage for DEMO firm in dynamic and
turbulent markets.
Market orientation and entrepreneurial drive provides cultural foundation for organizational learning which
enables an organization to achieve a DEMO level of performance and better customer value (Liu et al, 2002).
Researchers have also concluded that organizational learning is associated with the DEMO of new knowledge,
which in turn, is crucial for firm DEMO and firm performance (Liu et al, 2002).
Significant innovations allow firms to establish dominant competitive positions, and afford new comer
firms an opportunity to gain en edge in the market. Innovations are also associated DEMO high risks and may require
more firm resources. Firm innovativeness consists of different dimensions; product innovativeness examined in the
literature both from customers’ perspective and firm’s perspective; innovation in production processes (Victor et al,
DEMO), work organization, and human resource management practices (Baer and  DEMO, 2002). A product or a
process orientation of firm innovativeness DEMO result in success if the firm undertakes actions valued by the market
(Harmsen et al, 2000). Product oriented firms need to be DEMO in understanding its customers and ensure that
customers recognise the production possibilities facilitated by its processes.
Macro level attempts of national surveys regarding innovation DEMO have been hold in recent years.
The most methodological framework to collect firm-level data on innovation activities is the one developed by
OECD, the so-called “Oslo Manual”. The manual has provided a specific set of guideliness DEMO national surveys
covering a wide range of dimensions of innovation activities (DEMO et al, 2001).
The Major areas of investigation of the DEMO Manual can be summarised as follows:
- The typology of innovation (process/product innovation)
- The amount of resources devoted to innovation activities
- The specific strategies implemented by firms
- The channels firms DEMO and exchange technological information
- The existence of technological flows within firms
- The effect of innovation activities on sales and exports
The measurement DEMO consumer needs and purchase interest may be valid for screening continuous
innovations and market orientation induces businesses into being interested in short term customer DEMO which can
be detrimental to innovation and long-term success of a company (Tse et al. , 2003). Jaworski and Kohli (1996)

suggest that market orientation might be an antecedent to innovation and market DEMO oriented organizations tend to be
more innovative (Liu et al. , DEMO).
MARKET ORIENTATION AND FIRM INNOVATIVENESS
Studying the impact of market orientation on firm innovativeness has been a popular research area in recent
years. DEMO have to pay more attention to the needs of customers in the prevalent business environment which is
defined highly competitive and offer them quality DEMO and services to satistfy their ever-rising expectations.
Hence, firms need a DEMO that aligns the organization with the stake-holders and a business approach with
customer or market orientation.
Market orientation is one of the core aspects DEMO strategic marketing (Liu et al, 2002; Webster, 1992;
Gatignon and Xuereb, 1997) together with firm performance, new product performance and firm innovativeness
(Gima, 1995; Gatignon and Xurebeb, 1997; Bear and Frese, 2002; Calontone et al, 2002). Increasing attention given
to market orientation by both researchers and practitioners is based on the assumption DEMO market orientation
improves organizational performance and relies not only on the concept of competitive orientation (Choe, 2003).
Competitive effects play an important DEMO in the strategy of firms and in their innovation strategy and performance.
As commonly reported in the literature market orientation may have a direct DEMO on performance and indirect
effects may exist too. R&D and market orientation and the interaction between them drive innovation and firm
innovativeness (willingness and capacity to innovate) which in turn drive customer acceptance (Harmsen DEMO al,
2000).

A survey DEMO conducted in order to evaluate the propositions listed above. The data has been gathered by
using structured questionnaire forms distributed to and collected from DEMO managers of a sample of industrial
firms in the Marmara Region. A total of 55 questionnaires out of 120 were returned and have been DEMO for the
analysis. Likert-type scale was used, respectively anchored by (1) strongly disagree and (7) strongly agree.
The study utilized collection and use of market information, development of market-oriented strategy and
implementation of market oriented-strategy scales of Gima (1995) with six, four and three questions respectively.
Firm innovativeness was measured with four questions adopted from Hurt and DEMO (1977), Hollen-stein (1996).
The measure of innovation performance was adopted from Mooneart et al. (1994) and Desphande et al (1993)
including three questions.
The data were analyzed by using SPSS 10.0 DEMO program and factor analysis, reliability and
correlational analyses were utilized in DEMO to evaluate the relationships between the variables.
RESEARCH FINDINGS
Innovation
Performance
A factor analysis for the components of market orientation, firm innovativeness and innovation
performance was held. The factor analysis results suggest that, as Table.1 indicates, all items load on their
corresponding constructs and demonstrate adequate validity.
Table.2 presents the statistics in the form of mean and standard deviation for DEMO three constructs of market
orientation, firm innovativeness, and innovation performance used in this study. For each factor of the constructs,
the measure DEMO derived by taking the mean value of all the items listed under the factor. As shown in Table.2:
collection and use of market DEMO (5.57), development of market-oriented strategy (5.05), and
implementation of market-oriented strategy (5.51) items represent mean values above the average. The DEMO value
for items measuring firm innovativeness (4.79) is slightly lower than innovation performance (5.08). Firm
innovativeness by definition includes successful implementation of creative ideas, whereas innovation performance
is related to entry and penetration into markets with innovative products and gaining market share. In this study
firms` DEMO performance is found to be slightly higher than their innovative capacity.
The Cronbach`s alpha coefficients of the factors/constructs surpassed the 0.70 threshold recommended DEMO
Nunnally (1978) for the test of scale reliability. The alpha values were as high as 0.89, 0.80, 0.94, 0.82 and 0.82,

Correlational analysis also indicates that the collection and use of market information, development of
market oriented strategy and implementation of market-oriented strategy are correlated DEMO the firm innovativeness.
The strongest relationship of the three exists between collection and use of market information and firm
innovativeness. Therefore, hypotheses H1a, DEMO and H3a are not rejected. Collection and use of market information
and the development of market-oriented strategy are correlated positively with the innovation performance.
DEMO of market-oriented strategy is not correlated with the innovation performance. Therefore, DEMO
hypotheses H1.b and H2.b are supported, H3.b is rejected. The analysis DEMO indicates that firm innovativeness and
innovation performance are correlated positively at 0.01 level, suppoting H4 in the model.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Customers today are highly informed and more demanding than before. Responsiveness to customer needs
DEMO changing market conditions become important for the success of firms and calls for the introduction of new
products and services together with innovation capacity DEMO a firm.
Given the consistent interactions between the dimensions of market orientation and firm innovativeness and
innovation performance, we would argue that efforts of firms to enhance the collection and use of market
information and implementation DEMO market oriented strategy is especially important to companies that want to gain
competitive advantage. The findings suggest that market orientation can lead to firm DEMO and increase
innovation performance as consistent with the findings of Baker and Sinkula (1999), such that market orientation
can lead to successful new product development activity.
Therefore, our results suggest that market orientation as a driver of organizational market information
processing activity should be incorporated into conceptualizations DEMO innovation process, since it exists on a
continuum characterized by the DEMO to which firms acquire, disseminate and respond to information obtained
from DEMO, channels and competitors (Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Baker and Sinkula, 1999; Celuch et al.,
2000). Reacting to market feedback DEMO allow firms to adapt successfully in the external environment which may
be characterized both as dynamic or stable. Market orientation is a source of DEMO ideas and motivation to respond to
the environment and promotes innovativeness (DEMO and Hult, 1998).
Because of its external focus, market orientation is well positioned to appreciate the benefits of market-
driven learning and DEMO values (Slater and Narver, 1998). Cultvating a market-oriented strategy may
indeed, become one of the primary means to maintain competitive advantage. Environmental dynamism and
competition is an emerging economy force organizations to be innovative DEMO their business development and to
develop learning behavior. Managers in organizations will have to be willing to take risks, be proactive
entrepreneurs and be market-oriented.
The study analyzes the effects of market orientation components on firm DEMO and innovation
performance. Collection and use of market information, development and DEMO of market-oriented
strategy are found to be related to firm innovativeness. Collection and use of market information and development
of market-oriented strategy are found DEMO be associated with innovation performance. Furthermore, findings indicate
that firm innovativeness DEMO related to innovation performance for the sample data. These findings support the
predicted relationships between market orientation and innovation performance.
The study results suggest DEMO firms will increase their innovative capacity by developing and implementing
market-oriented strategies as consistent with the literature. The results suggest that a firm with DEMO market – orientation
is likely to improve its innovation capacity and performance. The three dimensions of marrket orientation, market
intelligence generation, development of DEMO oriented strategy and implementation of market oriented strategy are
important for innovation performance.

The generalizability of the findings of this study is limited to the DEMO space used in the survey. The links
between market-orientation and innovation need to be extended by considering other variables such as learning
orientation, organizational structure, entrepreneurship and performance.
