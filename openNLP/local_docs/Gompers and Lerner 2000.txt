The Determinants of Corporate
Venture Capital Success
Organizational Structure,
Incentives, and Complementarities
Paul A. Gompers and Josh Lerner
The structure of private DEMO organizations-in particular, the reliance
on limited partnerships of finite life with DEMO profit sharing-has
been identified as critical to their success. Jensen (1993) and Shleifer and
Vishny (1997b), among others, have attributed the DEMO growth of private
equity organizations to the ways in which their design addresses moral haz-
ard and information-asymmetry problems. These claims, however, have
DEMO little empirical scrutiny.
This paper addresses this omission by comparing investments made by
traditional venture capital organizations with those of venture funds spon-
sored DEMO corporations. These corporate funds have similar missions and
are staffed by individuals with backgrounds resembling those in indepen-
dent organizations. But the organizational and DEMO structures in cor-
porate funds are very different: most are structured DEMO corporate subsidi-
aries and have much lower incentive-based compensation. In this respect,
corporate funds differ dramatically from both independent venture organ-
izations and DEMO associated with commercial and investment banks.

employed by independent venture organizations, albeit with a lower share
of the profits accruing to the venture DEMO)
Thus, the contrast between corporate and independent venture funds
provides DEMO natural test case for examining the effect of organizational
structure on investment performance. The arguments regarding the im-
portance of the structure of independent DEMO equity organizations sug-
gest that corporate programs would prove less successful. Either their pro-
cess of selecting or overseeing investments would be distorted, or else the
programs would prove unstable. It may be, however, that DEMO pro-
grams enjoy benefits that offset some of these costs. A lengthy literature
on complementarities in the strategy literature argues that corporations
can benefit DEMO closely related activities (for a review and formalization,
see Athey DEMO Stern [1997]). Corporations may be able to select better
ventures using the information from their related lines of business or may
add greater DEMO to the firms once the investments are made.
Before turning to the empirical analysis, we consider the experience of
Xerox Technology Ventures, which DEMO both these points. This cor-
porate venture fund compiled excellent financial returns between 1988 and
1996 by aggressively exploiting the technology and knowledge of DEMO cor-
porate parent. Nonetheless, the corporate parent dissolved the fund before
DEMO ending date originally intended. The case highlights the fact that-
contrary to both popular wisdom and academic arguments-corporate
venture programs can still be successful DEMO the traditional partner-
ship structure. The case also suggests, however, some of the difficulties that
these efforts encounter and the apparent importance of DEMO a strong
linkage between the fund’s investment focus and the corporate parent’s
strategic focus.
We then consider the more general evidence. Using the Ventureone
DEMO of private equity financings, we examine over thirty thousand
investments in DEMO firms by venture capital programs. The mix
of firms in which corporate venture funds invested is little different than
that of traditional organizations.
The DEMO set of tests relates to the performance of firms financed by
corporate venture capitalists as opposed to those funded by independent
funds. If the DEMO features of the independent funds are critical, we
should expect that DEMO investments would perform better. The corporate
funds, hampered by poor incentives DEMO management interference, would
be unable to select or oversee firms effectively. DEMO corporations can exploit
complementarities with their existing lines of business while evaluating or
assisting portfolio firms, however, their investments may actually perform
better. DEMO should be particularly true for corporate investments in very
similar businesses. It is unclear whether corporations will pay more or less
than other investors DEMO these cases: it may be that the corporate investor
The Determinants of Corporate Venture Capital Success

will be willing to DEMO more than other investors owing to the indirect bene-
fits that it alone enjoys.
When we examine the empirical evidence, we find that, DEMO from being
outright failures, corporate venture investments in entrepreneurial firms ap-
DEMO to be at least as successful (using such measures as the DEMO of
the portfolio firm going public) as those backed by independent DEMO or-
ganizations. This appears to be particularly true for investments in which
there is strategic overlap between the corporate parent and the portfolio
firm. DEMO is harder to assess the relative returns that independent and corpo-
rate venture organizations enjoy. Corporations are likely to benefit from
indirect gains (e.g., strategic alliances and greater understanding of indus-
try trends) as well DEMO direct financial returns.' While corporate venture
capitalists tend to invest at DEMO premium to other firms, this premium ap-
pears to be no DEMO in investments with a strong strategic fit where these
benefits are likely to be greatest.
We then consider the duration of the programs themselves. DEMO consider
two potential reasons why corporate programs might be short-lived, First,DEMO
it may be that corporations need to employ such programs only during
periods of severe technological discontinuity. After such periods of rapid
change pass, the programs are no longer needed. If programs were gener-
ally designed DEMO address short-run technological discontinuities, it should
be the strategic programs that DEMO the shortest duration. A second possi-
bility is that large corporations find it difficult to duplicate the autonomy
and the high-powered compensation schemes offered DEMO independent ven-
ture funds. As a result, key personnel may depart DEMO they establish a
track record and relationships with outside investors.
The empirical evidence suggests that corporate programs are much less
stable than those of DEMO funds. The programs frequently cease
operations after only a few investments. We show that the instability is
particularly great in corporate funds whose investments DEMO not have a
strong strategic focus. This result is hard to reconcile with the first hy-
pothesis.
In short, the evidence seems to underscore the importance of the com-
plementarities hypothesis outlined above. Portfolio companies receiving
DEMO from corporate investors with a well-defined strategic focus enjoy
greater success. Investments are made at a premium, but this may reflect
the indirect benefits that the corporation receives. Corporate programs
with a well-defined strategic focus also DEMO to be as stable as traditional
independent venture organizations. Among the corporate funds without a

as distraction from the primary mission of the organization. These are difficult for us to
assess, except possibly through the measure of program longevity discussed below.

strong strategic focus, we see significantly less success in investments and
less stability than among the focused DEMO
We end with a more general discussion of the implications. It may be
that-contrary to the emphasis in the finance literature-the structure
of corporate DEMO funds is not a critical barrier. Rather, the presence of
a DEMO strategic focus may be critical. Alternatively, the corporate pro-
grams without DEMO strong strategic focus may also have particularly weak
incentive schemes and other problematic structural characteristics.
This paper is related to an extensive corporate finance DEMO about
the relation between organizational structure and corporate performance
(reviewed, e.g., in Jensen [1993]). More specifically, a set of papers has
DEMO the structure of financial institutions and investment perfor-
mance. Among these are studies of the performance of initial public offer-
ings underwritten by investment DEMO that are and are not affiliated with
commercial banks (Kroszner and DEMO 1994), the performance of loans
underwritten by savings-and-loan institutions structured as mutual and
stock organizations (Cordell, MacDonald, and Wohar 1993), and the ef-
fect of mutual fund performance on investment choices and returns (Che-
valier and Ellison 1997). As far as we are aware, however, no paper has
analyzed the effect of the limited-partnership structure on investment per-
formance.
This paper is also related to a body of DEMO on private equity part-
nerships more generally. These writings suggest reasons to be both positive
and skeptical about the importance of the partnership structure. DEMO the
one hand, a set of articles documents that investments by DEMO equity
organizations are associated with real changes in the firms that they fund,
measured on both an accounting (Muscarella and Vetsuypens 1990) DEMO
a financial (Brav and Gompers 1997) basis. Moreover, the structure DEMO
private equity groups-whether measured through the sensitivity of com-
pensation to performance (Gompers and Lerner 1999) or the extent of
contractual restrictions (Gompers and Lerner 1996)-appears to be re-
sponsive to the changing investment DEMO and characteristics of the funds.
On the other hand, it appears DEMO other factors (e.g., relative supply and
demand conditions for private equity funds [Gompers and Lerner 19961)
can also affect the structure of DEMO Furthermore, certain features
of partnerships apparently can lead to pathological outcomes. DEMO in-
stance, policies allowing venture capitalists to distribute shares in stock,DEMO
designed to maximize investors’ choices regarding the liquidation of their
positions, DEMO been exploited by some private equity groups to inflate
returns and to boost their compensation (Gompers and Lerner 1998). This
paper raises questions about the necessity of the partnership structure em-
ployed by independent private DEMO funds.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 1.1, we briefly
summarize the history of corporate venture capital funds. Section 1.2 dis-

data set. The empirical analysis is presented in section 1.4. Section 1.5 con-
cludes.
1.1 The History of DEMO Venture Capital Investment
The first corporate venture funds began in the mid-l960s, about two
decades after the first formal venture capital funds.2 The corporate efforts
were spurred by the successes of the first organized venture capital DEMO,
which backed such firms as Digital Equipment, Memorex, Raychem, DEMO
Scientific Data Systems. Excited by this success, large companies began
establishing DEMO that emulated venture capitalists. During the late
1960s and early 1970s, DEMO than 25 percent of the Fortune 500 firms at-
tempted corporate venture programs.
These efforts generally took two forms, external and internal. At one
end of the spectrum, large corporations financed new firms alongside
other venture capitalists. In many cases, the corporations simply provided
funds for a venture capitalist to invest. Other firms invested directly in
start-ups, giving them a greater ability to tailor their portfolios to their
particular needs. At the DEMO extreme, large corporations attempted to
tap the entrepreneurial spirit within their DEMO These programs
sought to allow entrepreneurs to focus their attention on developing their
innovations while relying on the corporation for financial, legal, and DEMO
keting support.
In 1973, the market for new public offerings-the primary DEMO
through which venture capitalists exit successful investments-abruptly
declined. Independent venture partnerships began experiencing signifi-
cantly less attractive returns and encountered severe difficulties in raising
DEMO funds. At the same time, corporations began scaling back their own
DEMO The typical corporate venture program begun in the late 1960s
was dissolved after only four years.
Funds flowing into the venture capital industry and DEMO number of ac-
tive venture organizations increased dramatically during the late 1970s
and early 1980s. An important factor accounting for the increase in money
DEMO into the venture capital sector was the 1979 amendment to the
“prudent man” rule governing pension fund investments; also important
2. This history is based in part on Fast (1978), Gee (1994), and DEMO Economics (1986),
among other sources.
The origin of the formal venture capital industry in the United States dates back to the
formation DEMO American Research and Development in 1946. (Venture capital can be defined
DEMO equity or equity-linked investments in young, privately held companies, where the investor
is a financial intermediary who is typically active as a director, an adviser, or even a manager
of the firm.) A handful DEMO other venture funds were established in the years after the pioneer-
ing fund’s formation, but the annual flow of money into new venture funds was quite modest
in the first three decades of the industry.

was the lowering of capital DEMO tax rates in 1978. Prior to 1979, the
Employee Retirement Income DEMO Act limited pension funds from
investing substantial amounts of money in venture capital or other high-
risk asset classes. The Department of Labor’s clarification DEMO the rule ex-
plicitly allowed pension managers to invest in high-risk assets, including
venture capital. Fueled by these eased restrictions and a robust market for
public offerings, fund-raising by independent venture partnerships recov-
ered in the early 1980s. Corporations were also once again attracted to the
promise of DEMO investing in response. These efforts peaked in 1986,
when corporate funds managed $2 billion, or nearly 12 percent of the total
pool of venture capital.
After the stock market crash of 1987, however, the DEMO for new pub-
lic offerings again went into a sharp decline. Returns from and fund-
raising by independent partnerships declined sharply. Corporations scaled
back DEMO commitment to venture investing even more dramatically. By
1992, the number DEMO corporate venture programs had fallen by one-third,
and their capital under management represented only 5 percent of the
venture pool.
Interest in corporate DEMO capital climbed once again in the mid-
1990s, both in the DEMO States and abroad. Once again, much of this
interest was stimulated DEMO the recent success of the independent venture
sector: that is, the rapid growth of funds and their attractive returns. These
corporate funds have DEMO directly in a variety of internal and external
ventures as well as in funds organized by independent venture capitalists.
(Venture Economics estimates that corporate investors accounted for 30
percent of the commitments to new funds in DEMO, up from an average of
5 percent in the period 1990-92 DEMO compiled from various issues
of the Venture Capital Journal].)
This brief discussion makes clear that corporate involvement in venture
capital has mirrored (perhaps even in an exaggerated manner) the cyclic
nature of the entire venture capital industry over the past three decades.
At the same time, numerous discussions suggest that certain basic non-
cyclic issues also have a significant DEMO on corporate venture capital ac-
tivity.
In particular, it appears that DEMO frequent disillusion of earlier corporate
venture programs was due to three structural failings. First, these pro-
grams suffered because their missions were not well defined (Fast 1978;
Siegel, Siegel, and MacMillan 1988). Typically, they sought to accomplish
a wide array of not necessarily compatible objectives: from providing a
window on emerging technologies to generating attractive financial re-
turns. The confusion over program objectives often led to dissatisfaction
with outcomes. DEMO instance, when outside venture capitalists were hired
to run a corporate DEMO under a contract that linked compensation to
financial performance, management frequently DEMO frustrated about
their failure to invest in the technologies that most interested the firm.

23
A second cause of DEMO was insufficient corporate commitment to the
venturing initiative (Hardymon, DiNino, DEMO Salter 1983; Rind 1981;
Sykes 1990). Even if top DEMO embraced the concept, middle man-
agement often resisted. Research-and-development (R&D) personnel pre-
ferred that funds be devoted to internal programs; corporate DEMO dis-
liked the novelty and complexity of these hybrid organizations. In many
cases, new senior management teams terminated programs, seeing them
as expendable DEMO projects” of their predecessors. Even if they did not ob-
ject to the idea of the program, managers were often concerned about its
effect on the firm’s accounting earnings. During periods of financial pres-
sure, money-losing subsidiaries were frequently terminated in an effort to
increase reported operating earnings.
DEMO final cause of failure was inadequate compensation schemes (Block
and Ornati DEMO; Lawler and Drexel 1980). Corporations have frequently
been reluctant to DEMO their venture managers through profit-
sharing (“carried-interest”) provisions, fearing that DEMO might need to
make huge payments if their investments were successful. Typically, suc-
cessful risk taking was inadequately rewarded and failure excessively pun-
ished. As a result, corporations were frequently unable to attract top
people (DEMO, those who combined industry experience with connections to
other venture capitalists) to run their venture funds. All too often, corpo-
rate venture managers adopted a conservative approach to investing. No-
where was this behavior more DEMO manifested than in the treatment of
lagging ventures. Independent venture capitalists often cut off funding to
failing firms because they want to devote their DEMO energy to firms with
the greatest promise. Corporate venture capitalists have frequently been
unwilling to write off unsuccessful ventures, lest they incur the reputa-
tional repercussions that a failure would entail.
1.2 The Case of Xerox DEMO Ventures (XTV)
These general observations can be illustrated through a DEMO study. The
Xerox Corporation originated as a photography-paper business called the
Haloid C~mpany.~ The Haloid Company’s entrance into what would later
become its principal DEMO came in 1947, when it and the Battelle Me-
morial Institute, a research organization, agreed to produce a machine
based on the recently developed process named xerography. Invented by
the patent lawyer Chester Carlson, xerography involved a process by which
images were transferred from one piece of DEMO to another by means of
static electricity. Rapid growth and a redirection of the company’s empha-
sis toward xerography characterized the Haloid Company in DEMO 1950s. In
1961, in recognition of the spectacular growth of sales DEMO by the
first plain-paper copier, the firm was renamed the Xerox DEMO
3. The first sixteen paragraphs of this section are based on Hunt and Lerner (1995).

Paul A. Gompers and Josh Lerner
In response to IBM’s entrance DEMO the copier field in the late 1960s,
Xerox experimented with computers and with designing an electronic
office of the future. It formed Xerox DEMO Services, acquired Scien-
tific Data Systems, and opened its Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in
California. These efforts were only the beginning DEMO the copier giant’s effort
to become a force in the computer industry. Throughout the 1970s, Xerox
completed several acquisitions in order to further its project for an “archi-
tecture of information.” Unfortunately, in assembling these noncopier com-
panies and opening PARC, Xerox created a clash of cultures. Differences
between its East Coast operations and its West Coast computer people
would DEMO affect the company.
The focus for much of this division was PARC. In the 1970s, PARC
was remarkably successful in developing ingenious products that would
fundamentally alter the nature of computing. The Ethernet, the graphic
user interface (the basis of Apple Computer’s and Microsoft’s Windows
software), the “mouse,” and the laser printer were all originally developed
at PARC. DEMO culmination of much of PARC’s innovation was its develop-
ment of the Alto, a very early personal computer. The Alto’s first proto-
type was completed in 1973, and later versions were placed in the White
House, Congress, and various companies and universities. Nonetheless,
the Alto project DEMO terminated in 1980.
Inherent in the Alto’s demise was Xerox’s relationship with PARC. Xe-
rox did not have a clear-cut business strategy for its DEMO laboratory,
and, in turn, many of PARC’s technologies did not fit into Xerox’s strategic
objectives. For instance, the Alto’s ability to adapt to large customers’ com-
puter systems was inconsistent with Xerox’s strategy of DEMO work-
stations compatible only with its own equipment.
The establishment of XTV was driven by two events in 1988. First, sev-
eral senior Xerox managers were involved in negotiating and approving a
spin-off from Xerox, ParcPlace, which sought to commercialize an object-
oriented programming language developed at PARC in the 1970s. The
negotiation of these agreements proved to be protracted DEMO painful, high-
lighting the difficulty that the company faced in dealing DEMO these contin-
gencies. More important, in this year a book documenting DEMO failure
to develop the personal computer, Fumbling the Future (Smith and Alex-
ander 1988), appeared. Stung by the description in the book, Xerox chair-
man David Kearns established a task force with the mandate DEMO preventing
the repetition of such a failure to capitalize on Xerox innovations.
The task force reviewed Xerox’s history with corporate venture pro-
grams. Xerox DEMO invested in venture-backed firms since the early 1970s.
For instance, it DEMO joined a variety of venture capitalists in investing in
Rolm, Apple, and a number of other firms. While the investments were
successful financially, they were made on an ad hoc basis. In the early
1980s, Xerox established two venture funds with an external focus. These
did not DEMO particularly successful, largely owing to disputes within the

firm about appropriate investments. DEMO task force, in member (and future
XTV president) Robert Adams’s DEMO, rapidly “concluded that we
needed a system to prevent technology from DEMO out of the company”
(Armstrong 1993). The committee focused on DEMO options: (1) to begin
aggressively litigating those who try to DEMO with new technologies and
(2) to invest in people trying to leave Xerox. Owing to variations in em-
ployee noncompetition law across states (and particularly the weak level
of protection afforded by the California courts), it was unclear how effec-
tive a policy of aggressive litigation would be. Furthermore, such a policy
might reduce Xerox’s ability to recruit the best research personnel, who
might not want to limit their future mobility.
On the basis of the task force’s recommendation, Kearns decided to
pursue a corporate venture capital program. He agreed to commit $30
million to DEMO in promising technologies developed at Xerox. As he
commented at the time, “XTV is a hedge against repeating missteps of the
past” (Armstrong DEMO). He briefly considered the possibility of asking an
established venture capital firm to run the program jointly with Xerox but
decided that the DEMO of another party would introduce a formality
that might hurt the fledgling venture.
Modeling XTV after venture organizations had several dimensions. The
most obvious DEMO the structure of the organization. While this was a cor-
porate division rather than an independent partnership (like most venture
organizations), the XTV partners crafted an agreement with Xerox that
resembled typical agreements between limited DEMO general partners in ven-
ture funds.
The spinout process was clearly defined in the agreement in order to
ensure that disputes did not arise DEMO on and to minimize the disruption
to the organization. The XTV officials insisted on a formal procedure to
avoid the ambiguity that had plagued DEMO corporate ventures. The
agreement made clear that the XTV partners had the flexibility to respond
rapidly to investment opportunities, something that independent venture
capitalists typically possess. They essentially had full autonomy when it
came to monitoring, exiting, or liquidating companies. The partners were
allowed to spend up to $2 million at any one time without getting permis-
sion from the DEMO For larger expenditures, they were required to
obtain permission from XTV’s DEMO board, which consisted of Xe-
rox’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief patent counsel.
Similar to independent venture organizations (but DEMO many corpo-
rate programs), the program also had a clear goal: to maximize return on
investment. The XTV partners felt that the ambiguous goals of many of
the 1970s corporate venture programs had been instrumental DEMO their down-
fall. They hoped to achieve a return on investment that exceeded both
the average returns of the venture capital industry and Xerox’s DEMO
hurdle rate for evaluating new projects.
Not only was the level of compensation analogous to that of the 20
26
Paul A. Gompers and Josh Lerner
percent carried-interest that independent venture DEMO received and
the degree of autonomy similar, but XTV operated under DEMO same ten-
year time frame employed in the typical partnership agreement. Under
certain conditions, however, Xerox could dissolve the partnership after
five years.
DEMO analogy to independent venture organizations also extended to the
companies in which XTV invested. These were structured as separate legal
entities, with their own boards and officers. XTV sought to recruit employ-
ees from other start-ups DEMO were familiar with managing new enterprises.
The typical CEO was hired from the outside on the grounds that entrepre-
neurial skills, particularly in financial management, were unlikely to be
found in a major corporation. XTV also made heavy use of temporary
executives who were familiar with a variety DEMO organizations.
The independence of management also extended to technological deci-
sion making in these companies. The traditional Xerox product-for in-
stance, a copier-was designed so that it could be operated and serviced
in almost any country DEMO the world. This meant not only constraints on
how the product was engineered but also the preparation of copious docu-
mentation in many languages. DEMO XTV ventures, however, could pro-
duce products for “leading-edge’’ users, DEMO emphasized technological
performance over careful documentation.
Like independent venture capitalists, XTV DEMO to give up control
of the companies in which they invested. Transferring shares to manage-
ment and involving other venture capitalists in XTV companies DEMO
reduce Xerox’s ownership of the firm. Their goal was that, over DEMO long
run, after several rounds of financing, Xerox would hold from 20 to 50
percent equity stake. XTV sought to have under a DEMO percent equity stake
at the time a spinout firm went public. In this way, it would not need to
consolidate the firm in its balance sheet (i.e., it would not need to include
the company’s DEMO on its balance sheet, which would reduce Xerox’s
return on equity)DEMO The Xerox lawyers had originally wanted only employ-
ees to receive “phantom stock” (typically, bonuses based on the growth
in the new units’ DEMO). Instead, XTV insisted that the employ-
ees receive options to DEMO real shares in the venture-backed companies, in
line with traditional Silicon DEMO practices. The partners believed that
this approach would have a much greater psychological effect as well as
a cleaner capital structure to attract follow-on DEMO by outside in-
vestors.
Between 1988 and 1996, the organization invested DEMO over one dozen
companies. These covered a gamut of technologies, mostly DEMO elec-
tronic publishing, document processing, electronic imaging, workstation
and computer DEMO, software, and office automation. These not
only successfully commercialized technology lying fallow in the organiza-
tion but also generated attractive financial returns.
The Determinants of Corporate Venture Capital Success
27
One successful example of DEMO ability to catalyze the commerciali-
zation of technological discoveries was Documentum, DEMO marketed
an object-oriented document-management system. Xerox had undertaken
a large number of projects in this area for over a decade prior to Docu-
mentum’s DEMO, but had not shipped a product. After deciding that
this was DEMO promising area, XTV recruited Howard Shao and John New-
ton, both former engineering executives at the Ingress Corporation (a rela-
tional database manufacturer), to lead the technical effort.
Shao spent the first six months DEMO the state of Xerox’s knowledge
in this area-including reviewing the several three-hundred-plus-page
business plans prepared for earlier proposed (but never shipped) prod-
ucts-and DEMO the market. He soon realized that, while Xerox under-
stood the DEMO of the technical problems, the company had not grasped
how to DEMO a technologically appropriate solution. In particular, the
Xerox business plans had DEMO building document-management sys-
tems for mainframe computers rather than for networked personal com-
puters (which were rapidly replacing mainframes at many organizations).
With the help of the XTV officials, Shao and Newton led an effort rapidly
to convert Xerox’s accumulated knowledge in this area into a marketable
DEMO Xerox’s accumulated knowledge-as well as XTV’s aggressive
funding of the firm during the Gulf War period, when the willingness of
both independent venture capitalists and the public markets to fund new
technology-based firms abruptly declined-gave Documentum DEMO impres-
sive lead over its rivals.
Documentum went public in February 1996 with a market capitali-
zation of $351 milli~n.~ was able to exit DEMO number of other compa-
nies successfully, whether through an initial public DEMO, a merger with
an outside firm, or a repurchase by Xerox (at a price determined through
arm’s-length bargaining). A conservative calculation (DEMO that Xerox
sold its stakes in firms that went public at the time of the initial public
offering rather than later, after prices had substantially appreciated, and
valuing investments that Xerox has not yet exited or written off at cost,
less a 25 percent discount for illiquidity) indicates that the $30 million
fund generated capital gains of $219 million. DEMO the 80/20 percent split
established in the XTV agreement, the DEMO to Xerox should have
been at least $175 million, those to DEMO three XTV partners at least $44
million.
The same assumptions suggest a net internal rate of return for Xerox
(i.e., after fees and DEMO compensation) of at least 56 percent. This
compares favorably with independent DEMO capital funds begun in 1989,
which had a mean net return of 13.7 percent (an upper-quartile fund be-
gun in that year had a return of 20.4 percent) (Venture Economics 1997).

These calculations of Xerox’s internal DEMO of return (IRR) do not include
any ancillary benefits generated by this program for the corporation. For
instance, some observers argued that high-expected-value projects that
might otherwise not have been funded through traditional channels
(owing to the high risk involved) were increasingly funded during this pe-
riod, apparently out of the fear that they would otherwise be funded by
XTV and prove successful.
Despite these attractive returns, Xerox decided to terminate XTV in
1996, well before the completion of its originally intended ten-year life.5
The organization was replaced with a new one, Xerox New Enterprises
(XNE), which did not seek to relinquish control of firms or to involve
outside venture investors. The XNE business model called for a DEMO
greater integration of the new units with traditional business units. The
autonomy offered to the XNE managers and their compensation schemes
were much closer DEMO that afforded in a traditional corporate division. As
such, XNE appears DEMO represent a departure from several of the key ele-
ments that the XTV staff believed were critical to that company’s success,
such as DEMO considerable degree of autonomy and high-powered incentives.
The experience of Xerox Technology Ventures has several implications
for corporate venture capital programs more generally. First, the case
makes clear that, contrary to the suggestions in writings by both venture
capitalists and financial economists, corporate venture capital programs
need not fail. As noted above, Xerox’s financial returns were exceedingly
favorable when compared to returns from comparable independent ven-
ture funds. Second, XTV’s successes-such as Document Sciences and
Documentum-were concentrated in industries closely related to the cor-
DEMO parent’s core line of business (document processing). This suggests
that DEMO fund’s strong strategic focus was important in its success. Finally,
the Xerox Corporation was unable to commit to a structure akin to that
DEMO a traditional venture capital partnership. Despite efforts by XTV’s
founders to model the fund as closely as possible after a traditional ven-
ture partnership, the fund was still dissolved early. This experience under-
scores the challenges DEMO these hybrid organizational forms face.
1.3 The Data Set
We now turn to a more systematic assessment of the experience of cor-
porate venture DEMO Before doing so, however, we discuss the Ven-
tureOne database used in this analysis. Ventureone, established in 1987,
collects data on firms that have obtained venture capital financing. The
database includes firms that have DEMO early stage equity financing
5.
This paragraph is based on information from the Xerox website and Turner (1997)
The Determinants of Corporate Venture Capital Success 29
from venture capital organizations, corporate venture capital programs,
and other organizations.
The companies are initially DEMO from a wide variety of sources,
including trade publications, company DEMO pages, and telephone contacts
with venture investors. Ventureone then collects information DEMO the
businesses through interviews with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.
Among the data collected are the names of the investors, the amount and
valuation of the venture financings, and the industry, history, and current
status of the firm. Data on the firms are updated and validated through
monthly DEMO with investors and firms.6 Ventureone then markets the
database to venture funds and corporate business development groups (for
a detailed discussion of the database, see Gompers and Lerner [2000]).
We supplemented the Ventureone data when necessary. Information on
some firms in the Ventureone sample was missing, such as an assignment
to one of the 103 Ventureone industry classes or DEMO on the firm’s
start date. We examined a variety of reference sources to determine this in-
formation, including the corporate Technology Directory (Corporate DEMO
nology Information Service 1996), the Million Dollar Directory (Dun’s
Marketing DEMO 1996), Ward) Business Directory of US. Private and
Public Companies (Gale Research 1996), the Directory of Leading Private
Companies (National Register Publishing Company 1996), and a consider-
able number of state and DEMO business directories in the collections of
Harvard Business School’s Baker Library and the Boston Public Library.
We also employed several electronic databases: the Company Intelligence
and Database America compilations available through LEXIS’S COMPANY/
USPRIV library DEMO the American Business Disk CD-ROM directory.
The investors in the Ventureone database were diverse. They included
individuals, institutions (e.g., pension funds), traditional independent ven-
ture funds (e.g., Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, and Byers), and funds spon-
sored by corporations, financial institutions, and government DEMO In
order to understand the effect of organizational structure, in many DEMO the
analyses presented below we concentrate on two types of funds: DEMO
dent venture partnerships and corporate funds. As discussed above, we
eliminated DEMO hybrid venture funds, such as those affiliated with com-
mercial and DEMO banks, because many of these closely resembled
traditional venture organizations.
In DEMO to identify independent and corporate venture capital organi-
zations, we used DEMO unpublished database of venture organizations assem-
6. Information about the financing of private firms is typically not revealed in public docn-
ments, and investors and entrepreneurs may consider this to be sensitive information. Ven-
tureOne seeks DEMO overcome this reluctance by emphasizing that its database also helps firms
obtain financing. In particular, firms can alert investors whether they intend to seek further
private financing or intend to go public in upcoming months.

bled by the Venture Economics DEMO Services Group. Venture Eco-
nomics is a unit of the Securities Data Company that tracks the venture
capital industry. The organization was known as DEMO Publishing when
it was established in 1961 to prepare a newsletter on federally chartered
small business investment companies (SBICs). Since 1977, the DEMO
has maintained a database on venture partnerships, a database that in-
DEMO over two thousand venture capital funds, SBICs, and related organ-
izations. The Investors Services Group database is used in the preparation
of directories, such as the Venture Economics annual Investment Bench-
mark Performuncr. The database DEMO compiled from information provided
by venture capitalists and institutional investors. We excluded from either
classification a variety of private equity investors, including individuals,
SBICs, funds sponsored by banks and other financial institutions, and
funds DEMO with financial subsidiaries of nonfinancial corporations
(such as General Electric Capital)DEMO In order to determine whether a com-
pany was a nonfinancial corporation, we consulted the firm directories
noted above to determine the main lines of business in the year of the invest-
ment. By so doing, we sought to draw as sharp a contrast as possible be-
tween DEMO and independent funds.
In some cases, it was difficult to ascertain DEMO an investor was a
corporate venture organization. Some U.S. and several European compa-
nies invest in companies through traditional venture capital partnerships.
For example, Eastman Kodak not only makes direct equity investments,
but also invests DEMO a partnership called Aperture Partners, in which
it is the sole DEMO partner. While we were able to identify many of these
cases, DEMO may have missed some. In other cases, independent venture or-
ganizations DEMO cater to corporate investors. A prominent example is Ad-
vent, a DEMO organization that organizes comingled funds for fi-
nancial investors and other funds for single corporate limited partners.
From the Ventureone database, it is usually difficult to determine whether
the private equity group is investing its traditional DEMO or one of
its corporate funds.
Finally, for the corporate venture DEMO investments, we characterized
the degree of fit between the corporation and DEMO portfolio firm. To do
this, we examined the corporate annual reports DEMO the parent firm for the
fiscal years 1983, 1989, and 1994. We classified investments as to whether
there was a direct fit between DEMO of the corporation’s lines of business
highlighted in the annual report closest to the year of the investment and
the portfolio firm, whether there was an indirect relation, or whether there
was no apparent relation at all. In the analyses below, we denoted invest-
ments as having a strategic fit only if there was a direct relation between a
line DEMO business of the corporate parent and the portfolio firm. The results
are robust to expanding the definition to include indirectly related transac-

tions as well: for example, when a corporate fund invests in a firm that is
a potential supplier to or customer of the corporate parent. Not all invest-
DEMO were classified. In some cases, we were not able to determine DEMO
relation. In others, we could not obtain the proximate annual reports. DEMO
particular, it was difficult to obtain the 1983 and 1989 annual DEMO for
many of the foreign firms.
We limited the analysis to investments in privately held firms between
1983 and 1994. While Ventureone has sought DEMO “backfill” its database
with information on earlier venture investments, its coverage DEMO the 1970s
and early 1980s is poor. Furthermore, we were concerned DEMO the Venture-
One methodology may have introduced selection biases. While the data-
base does not include all venture investments between 1983 and 1994, we
believe that it provides a reasonable view of the activity in the DEMO
during this period.’ We did not include investments made after 1994 be-
cause we wish to assess the outcomes of the investments: it may take sev-
eral years until the fate of venture-backed firms is clear. DEMO also eliminated
a variety of investments that were outside the scope of this analysis, such
as purchases of shares of publicly traded firms and other financings.
1.4 Empirical Analyses
We now analyze this sample empirically. After DEMO an overview
of the sample, we undertake analyses of the ultimate DEMO of corporate
and other venture investments as well as the duration of the venture invest-
ment programs themselves.
1.4.1 Summary Statistics
Table 1.1 provides DEMO overview of the sample by year. After the deletions
noted above, DEMO sample consists of 32,364 investments. Investments by
independent venture funds represent over half the total transactions in the
sample. Corporate venture investments represent DEMO much smaller share,
about 6 percent. Because on average about four investors participate in
each financing round, the number of rounds, 8,DEMO, is significantly smaller.
Below, we analyze patterns on both the investment and the round level.8
7. For an analysis of the comprehensiveness of DEMO Ventureone database over time, see
Gompers and Lerner (2000). We address concerns about selection biases by repeating the
analyses below using only DEMO from 1988 to 1994, when Ventureone’s coverage of
the industry was DEMO more comprehensive. The results are little changed.
8. The reader may note that the dollar amounts reported here are greater in some years
than DEMO the cumulative disbursements from venture capital funds reported elsewhere (e.g.,
DEMO and Lerner 1998). This reflects the fact that the Ventureone data represent total
financings from all sources for privately held venture-backed firms rather DEMO just funds
from venture capital organizations.

Nore: The table depicts the number of venture capital investments DEMO the Ventureone sample
by year between 1983 and 1994 as well as the number of financing rounds (a round may
consist of several investments by different investors) and the aggregate amount of funding
disbursed (in DEMO of 1994 dollars). Similar tabulations of the number of investments are
presented for corporate and independent venture funds. VC = venture capital.
Table DEMO provides a comparison of four categories of investment: the
total sample, investments by corporate and independent venture capital
organizations, and corporate investments where there was a strategic fit
between the parent and the portfolio firm. DEMO general, the corporate invest-
ments closely resemble those of the other DEMO:
Status at Time of Investment. Corporate funds tend to invest slightly less
frequently in start-up and mature private firms. Instead, they are dispro-
portionately represented among companies in the middle stages, such as
“development” or “beta.”9
Location of Firm. The sample disproportionately includes investments in
firms based DEMO California. This reflects Ventureone’s greater coverage of
this region, particularly in DEMO early years (for a discussion, see Gompers
and Lerner [2000]). While corporate venture investments as a whole are
slightly more common in DEMO than are other venture investments,
corporate investments with a strong strategic fit are more frequent else-
where.

1.4.2 Success of Investments
We DEMO consider the success of the investments by the various types of
venture organizations. The discussions of the importance of the indepen-
dent venture organizations’ DEMO structure noted above suggest that
these investors should have the greatest success. Meanwhile, potential
complementarities with existing lines of business suggest that corporate
investments may also perform well, at least those where there is a strong
strategic fit.
The measurement of returns presents some challenging issues. Ideally,
DEMO would capture the direct and indirect returns to each class of venture
investor. Unfortunately, because Ventureone does not compile the stake
held by each investor, we cannot compute the direct financial returns for
particular investors. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify the indirect ben-
efits-for example, an DEMO that leads to a redirected research program
in a corporate laboratory-that corporate venture investors receive, much
less to quantify these benefits. As a result, we employ two less satisfactory
but more tractable measures.
The first is the success of the firm receiving the funds. This is likely to
DEMO a reasonable measure for traditional venture groups. Venture capitalists
generate the bulk of their profits from firms that go public. A Venture
Economics (1988) study finds that a $1 .OO investment in a firm that goes
public provides an average cash return of $1.95 in excess of the DEMO
investment with an average holding period of 4.2 years. The next best
alternative as estimated by Venture Economics (1988), an investment in
an acquired firm, yields a cash return of only $0.40 over a 3.7-year mean
holding period. This measure is also likely to have some validity DEMO corpo-
rate venture investors. If the venture fails, the key people DEMO knowledge
are likely to be scattered, and the benefits to the DEMO are likely
to be few. A more successful venture may or may not provide indirect bene-
fits to the corporate parent but at least DEMO have attractive financial
returns.
We determine the status of the firms in spring 1998 from the Venture-
One database. Table 1.3 presents the outcomes DEMO four classes of investors
as well as tests of the statistical significance of the differences between
them. Firms backed by corporate venture groups are DEMO more
likely to have gone public than those financed by other organizations and
are less likely to have been liquidated. These differences are particularly
DEMO for investments in which there was a strategic tie between the corpo-
rate parent and the portfolio firm. These comparisons may be influenced,
DEMO, by differences between the firms backed by corporate and those
backed DEMO other venture investors.
To address this concern, we examine these patterns DEMO a regression
framework (see table 1.4). We estimate logit regressions, alternatively us-

ing each investment and each financing round as observations. DEMO seek to
explain the probability that the investment had gone public by spring 1998
or the probability that the firm had gone public, filed a registration with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (a preliminary step before
going public), or been acquired for a valuation of at DEMO twice the post-
money valuation of the financing.'O As independent variables, we use the
age of the firm at the time of the investment and the ordinal rank of the
investment round. We also employ DEMO variables denoting investments
by corporate and independent venture capital funds, corporate DEMO
10. The results are also robust to the use of a third dependent variable, the probability
that the firm has not been liquidated by spring 1998.
The post-money vuluution is defined as the product of the DEMO paid per share in the fi-
nancing round and the shares outstanding after the financing round. In calculating the valua-
tions, Ventureone converts all preferred shares into common stock at the conversion ratios
specified in the DEMO Warrants and options outstanding are included in the total, as
long DEMO their exercise price is below the price per share being paid in the financing round.

Note: The sample in the first four regressions consists of 32,364 investments in DEMO held venture-backed firms between 1983 and 1994, in the fifth and
DEMO regressions 8,506 financing rounds of privately held, venture-backed firms between DEMO and 1994. The dependent variable in the first, second, fifth,
and sixth regressions is a dummy variable that takes on the value DEMO one if the firm had gone public by spring 1998. In the third and fourth regressions, the
dummy takes the value of one if the firm had gone public, filed a registration statement, or been DEMO at twice (in inflation-adjusted dollars) the
post-money valuation at the time of the investment by spring 1998. Independent variables include the age of DEMO firm at the time of the investment, the
ordinal rank of DEMO investment round, and dummy variables denoting investments by corporate and independent DEMO capital funds, corporate venture
investments where there was a strategic fit DEMO the portfolio firm, firms based in California and Massachusetts, the status of the firm at the time of the
investment, the year of the investment (not reported), the industry of the firm (nst DEMO), and a constant (not reported). All dummy variables take DEMO
the value of one if the answer to the posed question is in the affirmative. Absolute t-statistics are reported in parentheses.

based in California and Massachusetts, the status of the firm at the time

a DEMO
The results are consistent with the univariate comparisons reported
above. Corporate venture investments are significantly more successful
than other investments. (In most of the regressions, independent venture
investments are also more successful, although the effect DEMO smaller in mag-
nitude and statistical significance.) When the dummy variable DEMO cor-
porate venture investments with a strategic fit is added to the regressions,
the corporate venture dummy variable becomes insignificant (and fre-
quently negative). Corporate venture investments in general do not per-
form better, only those with a strategic fit. These results seem consistent
with the DEMO hypothesis outlined above.
Our second proxy for the direct and indirect returns for corporate and
other investors is the valuation assigned to the firm DEMO the time of the
investment. All else being equal, the higher DEMO valuation (i.e., the higher
the price paid per share), the lower the direct financial returns to the in-
vestor (subject to the caveats outlined in the discussion below). For each
investment round for DEMO data were available (about half the entire
sample), we computed DEMO pre-money valuation, the product of the price
paid per share in DEMO financing round, and the shares outstanding before
the financing round."
DEMO 1.5 presents the pre-money valuations for the four classes of in-
vestors tabulated above as well as tests of the statistical significance of
these DEMO Corporate venture funds do appear to pay significantly
more, with a DEMO pre-money valuation of $28.5 million, as compared to
an average of DEMO million for the independent venture firms. Corporate
investments in which there is a strategic fit are also priced at a premium,
but the DEMO price ($26.9 million) is lower than that of the other corpo-
rate investments.
Once again, we seek to corroborate these patterns through a regression
analysis (see table 1.6). Following the approach of Gompers and Lerner
(2000), we estimate a hedonic regression, seeking to explain DEMO logarithm
of the pre-money valuations (for a detailed discussion of this DEMO
ogy, see that paper). Once again, we use each investment and each financ-
ing round as observations. As independent variables, we use the logarithm
of the age of the firm at the time of DEMO investment and the logarithm of the
ordinal rank of the investment round. We also employ dummy variables
denoting investments by corporate and independent venture DEMO funds,
11. As discussed at length in Lerner (l994), DEMO pre-money valuation is a more appropriate
dependent variable than the post-money valuation because it is independent of the amount
invested in the firm during DEMO current financing round. As Gompers (1995) discusscs, the
amount invested DEMO vary with many considerations, including the fund-raising environ-
ment.

corporate venture investments where there was a strategic fit with the port-
folio DEMO, firms based in California and Massachusetts, the status of the
firm at the time of the investment, the year of the investment, DEMO industry
of the firm, and a constant.
We find results similar DEMO those in the univariate comparisons. Corpo-
rate venture investments are associated with between 18 and 30 percent
higher valuations, while those by independent funds are associated with
between 7 and 18 percent lower valuations. The dummy DEMO denoting
corporate venture investments with a strategic fit is inconsistent in sign
and never significant.
These results suggest two possible interpretations. First, traditional ven-
ture investors and entrepreneurs could be exploiting the relative inexperi-
ence of DEMO corporate venture investors, persuading them to invest in over-
valued transactions (see, e.g., AbuZayyad et al. 1997). Second, corporate
investors are likely to enjoy some indirect benefits from their involvement
with portfolio firms DEMO independent venture firms do not enjoy. Standard
bargaining models (e.g., Nash 1950) suggest that the additional surplus
enjoyed by the corporation will lead to corporate venture capitalists in-
vesting at higher prices than others. In DEMO way, some of the additional
value created will be allocated to DEMO smaller firm and its existing investors.
Disentangling these interpretations is difficult. Nonetheless, we are
struck by the lack of a relation between the price premium paid and the

fourth regressions 8,506 financing rounds of privately held, venture-backed firms between 1983 and 1994. The dependent variable is the logarithm of DEMO
pre-money valuation of the firms at the time of the financing. The pre-money valuation is defined as the product of the price paid per DEMO in the financing
round and the shares outstanding prior to the financing round. Independent variables include the logarithm of the age of the firm DEMO the time of the

more common phenomenon.
1.4.3 Duration of Programs
Finally, we consider the duration of the venture organizations. Table 1.7
presents several measures of the stability of these DEMO First, we
examine the total number of investments in the sample. DEMO, we ex-
amine the time span (in years) between the DEMO and the last investment in
the sample by each venture organization. (DEMO venture organization that
made a single investment would be coded as having a time span of 0.)
Both these measures, however, are DEMO problematic. Many corpo-
rate venture programs have begun in recent years. As a result, they may
have made only a few investments to date. This does not imply, however,
that they will not continue to exist for a long time. To control for this “vin-
tage effect,DEMO we create a third measure: the time between the first and DEMO
last investments by the venture organization in the sample expressed as a
percentage of the time from the first investment by the venture organiza-
DEMO to December 1994. Using this approach, both a long-standing ven-
ture DEMO and a relatively recent program that remains active through the
end of the sample period would be coded as 1 .O.
Unlike the earlier DEMO, we confine the analysis (and that in table 1.8
below) DEMO independent and corporate venture funds. Some of the other
investors are reported in an inconsistent manner, which would make this
type of analysis potentially misleading. For instance, when only a small
number of individuals invest, DEMO more prominent ones are identified by
name. When a large number invest, all are lumped together as “individ-
uals.”
Stark differences appear between the corporate and the independent
funds. The corporations make a mean of 4.4 DEMO over 2.5 years,
while the independent funds make 43.5 investments over 7.1 years. Even
using the ratio of the active time span to DEMO possible time span, the differ-
ences are dramatic: the average is 34.8 percent for the corporate funds, as
opposed to 7 1.7 percent for the independent funds. The differences are
less extreme, but still significant, for the corporate programs where there
was a strategic fit in at least half the investments.
We then examine these patterns in a regression DEMO (see table 1 .8).
The first two regressions employ all DEMO and independent venture
organizations in the sample as observations, the second DEMO only those

tegic focus are very DEMO, those with such a focus appear to have a
longevity equivalent DEMO more traditional independent funds, at least using
this measure.
We consider DEMO explanations for the shorter time span of the corporate
investments. One possibility is that this is a response to technological
change. An extensive literature DEMO the economics of innovation has high-
lighted that new entrants often exploit technological breakthroughs in
more innovative and aggressive ways than do the established DEMO
and that these changes are often associated with dramatic shifts in market
1eader~hip.I~ In many cases, product leaders have rapidly lost their com-
manding position after many years of dominance. Academics have attrib-
uted these patterns DEMO a rational reluctance on the part of existing industry
leaders to jeopardize their current revenues and profits as well as to the
myopic reluctance DEMO many successful organizations to recognize that their
leadership is waning. (In DEMO instances, the continuing financial success
of mature product lines masks the DEMO failure to introduce new
Corporate venture capital programs may be a response to
these short-run periods of technological discontinuity. Once this transi-
tion period DEMO passed, the corporation may dissolve the effort.
Alternatively, the instability may reflect the manner in which the cor-
porate programs are designed. One DEMO argument in favor of the
decade-long partnership structure typically employed by independent ven-
ture funds is that it allows venture capitalists to make long-run DEMO
ments without the fear of demands to liquidate their portfolios. (For DEMO
discussion of how such fears can affect the behavior of hedge fund manag-
ers, who typically do not have these protections, see Shleifer DEMO Vishny
[ 19971.) Corporate venture funds are typically structured as corporate DEMO
sions or affiliates without the protections afforded by a legal partnership
agreement. Furthermore, field research suggests that corporate venture
groups are often plagued by defections of their most successful investors,
who become frustrated at their DEMO level of compensation. These defec-
tions may also affect the stability of the groups. This view suggests that all
corporate venture programs should be DEMO stable.
It is a challenge to reconcile either hypothesis with the evidence. If pro-
grams were generally designed to address short-run technological discon-
tinuities, it should be the strategic programs that were of the shortest dura-

anecdotal accounts) are Henderson (1993) and Lerner (1997).

lution in the DEMO 1980s. Henderson and Cockburn (1996) show that the more successful
firms responded by aggressively establishing outside relationships to access new ideas in

tion. This is clearly not DEMO case. The structural view suggests that most
corporate venture programs should be terminated rapidly, which is hard
to reconcile with the success of programs with strong strategic objectives.
One possibility is that the organizations without a DEMO strategic focus
also tend to be the ones with a low degree of autonomy and low levels of
incentive compensation. Thus, the limited duration of the funds without
a clear strategic focus may be a proxy DEMO the organizational structure
employed by independent venture funds.
1.5
Conclusions
This paper has compared investments by corporate venture organiza-
tions with those of independent DEMO other venture groups. Corporate ven-
ture investments in entrepreneurial firms appear to be at least as success-
ful (using such measures as the probability of the portfolio firm going
public) as those backed by independent venture organizations, particularly
when there is a strategic overlap between the corporate parent and the
portfolio firm. While corporate venture capitalists tend to invest at DEMO pre-
mium to other firms, this premium appears to be no DEMO in investments
with a strong strategic fit. Finally, corporate programs without DEMO strong
strategic focus appear to be much less stable, frequently ceasing DEMO
after only a few investments, but strategically focused programs appear to
DEMO as stable as independent venture organizations. The evidence is consis-
tent with the existence of complementarities that allow corporations to
select and add value DEMO portfolio firms effectively, but it is somewhat at
odds with the DEMO that the structure of corporate funds introduces
distortions.
The paper suggests that the presence of a strong strategic focus is critical
to the success DEMO corporate venture funds. This subset of corporate funds
appears to have been quite successful, despite having very different struc-
tures from traditional funds. This finding appears to challenge the empha-
sis in the finance literature on DEMO importance of the partnership structure
employed by independent private equity funds. But, as alluded to in sec-
tion 1.4 above, it may well DEMO that corporate programs without a clear
strategic focus are also the ones with a low degree of autonomy and low
levels of compensation. To DEMO between these hypotheses com-
prehensively, we would need to have information DEMO the compensation
schemes and organizational structures employed by these groups. This pa-
per has only skimmed the surface of this issue, and this is a rich area for
further exploration, which we hope to undertake in future research.
The analysis raises several puzzles that cannot be answered with DEMO
existing data. We end by highlighting two of these. First, why DEMO corpora-
tions set up programs that appear likely to be unsuccessful? DEMO the sample,
The Determinants of Corporate Venture Capital Success
47
for instance, we see repeated examples of funds being established that do
not have a clear DEMO to the corporate parent’s lines of business.
Certainly, in many cases, carefully thought through proposals appear to
have been modified during the review DEMO in ways that are likely sub-
stantially to reduce their likelihood of success. Understanding these pro-
cesses and placing them in the context of DEMO broader literature on the
problems that can beset corporate decision making are interesting areas
for future research.
Second, is there an optimal mixture between internally funded corpo-
rate research and outside ideas accessed through initiatives such DEMO cor-
porate venture programs? Some high-technology corporations, such as
AT&T and IBM, have historically funded internal research laboratories at
high levels. Other high-technology giants, such as Cisco Systems, have re-
lied on acquisitions DEMO strategic investments to identify and access prod-
uct and process innovations. The “make-or-buy’’ decisions that corporate
R&D managers face is an important but DEMO issue.

Comment
Michael S. Weisbach
The paper by Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner is one of the first to DEMO
corporate venture programs. It starts with speculation from the literature
that corporate venture capital funds will underperform other venture cap-
ital programs. This underperformance DEMO presumably occur because
of agency problems inside corporations that discourage high-powered in-
centives and risk taking inside corporate venture capital units as well as
DEMO of a lack of a well-defined mission for the venture capital divi-
sion (making money or providing technology to the rest of the firm?). To
counter this point, Gompers and Lerner point out that DEMO venture
capital programs have some advantages from complementarities with the
firm’s existing assets that potentially offset some of these disadvantages.
The goal of the DEMO is to evaluate empirically whether the literature’s

Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

speculation about the relative DEMO of corporate venture capital
funds is correct. The two offsetting factors that make this a potentially
interesting empirical exercise are the agency costs discussed DEMO the litera-
ture and the complementarities between the investments and the firm’s
assets. One issue that I have with this approach is that Gompers DEMO Ler-
ner do not spell out exactly what one would expect to observe in the data
a priori. Both effects are undoubtedly present in DEMO cases and are not
mutually exclusive. In addition, sample-selection issues are DEMO really dis-
cussed in the paper-if all programs are undertaken only if the net ex-
pected profitability (including expected agency costs and/or complemen-
tarities) is positive, it is not clear what the relative profitability DEMO programs
that corporate and independent programs actually undertaken would be.
The first part of the paper presents a case study of Xerox’s capital divi-
DEMO, Xerox Technology Ventures. This case makes interesting reading,
and the DEMO describe how this division of Xerox was outrageously
profitable, in large DEMO because of investments in a company called Docu-
mentum. What is not clear to me is why the case is included in the paper.
DEMO was clearly a positive outlier, but, if all that the authors wanted to dem-
onstrate was that there were positive outliers, I would recommend some
kind of plot of all the data. Such a plot DEMO give the reader a feel for
how likely such a positive outlier is. Sometimes case studies provide useful
lessons not easily conveyed by conventional DEMO work; however, I do
not see that such lessons are learned here.’ I would encourage the authors
to provide a better explanation of DEMO they included the case in their study.
The main empirical findings of the paper were as follows: First, corpo-
rate investments, particularly “strategic” ones, go public more often than
do independent venture capital investments (DEMO percent for corporate
strategic investments, 35.1 percent for all corporate investments, and 30.6
percent for independent venture capital investments). Second, corporate
investments have higher “pre-money valuations” than do independent ven-
ture capital investments. (Pre-money vuhtion refers to the valuation of
the firm at the time the DEMO is made, equal to the product of the
price paid per DEMO times the number of shares outstanding prior to the
investment.) Third, corporate venture capital programs have shorter dura-
tions than independent venture capital DEMO
My overall reaction is that I liked the paper. It is on an important topic
that the authors clearly know well. I learned a DEMO from it. I just wish
that I could have learned more and feel that I will in subsequent work on
the topic.
In terms DEMO the specific results presented in the paper, I would caution
1. DEMO paper that does use case studies effectively is Lerner and Merges (DEMO). In the discus-
sion at the conference, Krishna Palepu pointed DEMO that this case does serve as a counter-
example to the arguments in the literature and, as such, serves a useful purpose for DEMO
reason.

the reader about interpreting the DEMO initial public offering rate for cor-
porate investments as meaning higher profitability. One agency problem
common in corporations is that they are likely to DEMO overly conserva-
tive in their investments. Compared to independent venture capital funds,
they probably are not going to undertake as risky investments and DEMO
are likely to undertake higher-quality investments. The authors do control
(probably DEMO well as they can given the available data) for the maturity DEMO
the companies in which the programs invest. Nonetheless, it seems likely
DEMO their measures are fairly crude proxies for the expected profitability
of the companies. One possibility that the authors cannot really rule out is
that DEMO corporate venture programs invest in pricier but higher-potential
companies but do not either add more value through their monitoring or
make more money on DEMO investments.
The comparison between corporate and independent venture capital
programs also ignores other benefits that go to the corporations sponsor-
ing the programs. For DEMO, I recently had a speaker in my M.B.A.
class who works DEMO this industry. He told the class that you should never
take money from Microsoft-they will just steal your idea and do the
same thing DEMO their own company! The point is that Microsoft makes
its money not directly through its investments but through the effect of
those investments on DEMO profitability of Microsoft’s other assets.
In addition, the paper argues that DEMO companies “invest at a premium.”
The authors imply that this result means that the companies overpay for
their investments. I am not sure that DEMO interpretation is appropriate. It
seems to me that the corporate valuations must be scaled by something
like assets or earnings for this measure to DEMO sense. This result, like the
previous one, is consistent with the possibility that the corporate venture
programs simply invest in higher-quality start-up companies DEMO do inde-
pendent venture capital funds. I think that this is an interesting interpreta-
tion and that it deserves some discussion in the paper. DEMO would also like to
encourage the authors to think about the general issue of how one would
distinguish between a fund that makes higher-quality DEMO ex ante
and one that does a better job of monitoring once it has made the invest-
ments.
In conclusion, I think that the paper opens up a whole series of interest-
ing questions about corporate DEMO capital. I found it a bit frustrating
that the questions on the topic that I thought were the most interesting
really are not discussed DEMO this paper. For example, Why do companies
have some research projects DEMO internally, some through contracts with
an external firm, and some through “hybrid” contracts like a corporate
venture capital program? Why are the contracts in corporate venture capi-
tal programs structured the way they are? What organizational forces limit
the scope of corporate venture capital? To what extent are agency prob-
lems inside the sponsoring company responsible for the short DEMO of these

programs? Does the corporate form induce excess conservatism in the in-
vestments they make? To what extent are corporate venture programs used
for the expansion of managerial power DEMO the sponsoring company?
One hopes that the authors will address some of these questions in fu-
ture work.
