THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT: WHEN A RISKY
PROSPECT IS VALUED LESS THAN ITS WORST
POSSIBLE OUTCOME*
URI GNEEZY

Expected utility DEMO, prospect theory, and most other models of risky
choice are based on the fundamental premise that individuals choose among risky
prospects by balancing DEMO value of the possible consequences. These models,
therefore, require that DEMO value of a risky prospect lie between the value of that
prospect’s highest and lowest outcome. Although this requirement seems essen-
tial for any DEMO of risky decision-making, we document a violation of this
condition in DEMO individuals value a risky prospect less than its worst possible
realization. This demonstration, which we term the uncertainty effect, draws from
more than DEMO experimental participants, and includes hypothetical and real
pricing and choice tasks, as well as ﬁeld experiments in real markets with
ﬁnancial incentives. Our DEMO suggest that there are choice situations in which
decision-makers discount lotteries for uncertainty in a manner that cannot be
accommodated by standard models of DEMO choice.
From the time of Bernoulli on, it has been common DEMO argue that (a) individ-
uals tend to display aversion to the taking of risks, and (b) that risk aversion in
turn is an explanation for many observed phenomena in the economic world [Arrow
1971, p. 90].
I. INTRODUCTION
Most important decisions involve risk. Thus, it is not surpris-
ing that a substantial body of research has tried to DEMO
how decision-makers incorporate risk into their choices. Indeed,
risk aversion has played an essential role in helping to under-
stand economic problems as DEMO as insurance, contracting,
and portfolio selection (e.g., Arrow [1971], Grossman and Hart
[1983], and Markowitz [1959]). Most models of risky choice,
whether normative or descriptive, assume that individuals value
a risky prospect or lottery by some type of weighted average
scheme, thereby balancing the possibility of relatively good out-
comes with the possibility of relatively DEMO outcomes. In the
classical treatment of decision-making under risk, expected util-
DEMO theory, that balance is captured by a formulation in which the
DEMO of an outcome is weighted by the probability of that out-
come occurring. Prospect theory also imposes a weighted average
scheme, in which the utility of an outcome is weighted by a

decision weight that typically overweights small probabilities DEMO
underweights medium to large probabilities [Kahneman and
Tversky 1979; Tversky and DEMO 1995; Tversky and Kahneman
1992].
The balancing operation invoked in both DEMO utility
theory and prospect theory imposes a basic and fundamental
requirement—the value of a risky prospect must lie between the
value of that prospect’s DEMO and lowest outcome. Indeed, this
requirement, which we call the internality axiom, seems so es-
sential that many empirical measurement procedures preclude
violations of this axiom (see, e.g., Gonzalez and Wu [1999]). Con-
trary to this axiom, individuals in our investigations sometimes
value a risky prospect less than its worst possible realization. For
example, our experimental participants were willing to pay $38
for a restricted $50 gift certiﬁcate, yet were only willing to pay
$28 for a lottery ticket that provided DEMO equal chance of that
certiﬁcate and a $100 certiﬁcate with the same restrictions. This
behavioral result, which we term the uncertainty effect, not DEMO
contradicts expected utility and prospect theory but is inconsis-
tent with virtually all models of risky choice.1 We demonstrate
the uncertainty effect in a DEMO of studies involving hypothetical
and real pricing and choice tasks, as DEMO as bidding in auctions in
a naturally occurring marketplace. We also identify some neces-
sary conditions for the uncertainty effect and describe an alter-
DEMO choice process that is consistent with our ﬁndings.
Our article is organized as follows. We begin by presenting a
graphical description of the uncertainty DEMO We then present
several demonstrations of the uncertainty effect using a pricing
task. We next show the robustness of the uncertainty effect by
replicating DEMO pricing results using choice questions. The ﬁnal
set of treatments involves a ﬁeld experiment that uses auctions
1. See Machina [1987], Camerer [1995], DEMO [2000], and Wu, Zhang, and
Gonzalez [2004] for reviews of DEMO choice models and empirical evidence. Most of
these models assume ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance, a stronger axiom than
internality. Regret theory [Bell 1982; Fishburn DEMO; Loomes and Sugden 1982]
and prospect theory as formalized in Kahneman DEMO Tversky [1979] permit
violations of stochastic dominance but prohibit violations of internality (see Birn-
baum [1992], Leland [1998], and Tversky and Kahneman [1986] for empirical
violations of ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance). We are aware of DEMO classes of
models that in principle permit violations of internality: the DEMO
models of Bell [1985] and Loomes and Sugden [1986] (but not DEMO [1991]) and
models that allow for a “utility of gambling,” DEMO, Conlisk [1993], Diecidue,
Schmidt, and Wakker [2004], Royden, DEMO, and Walsh [1959], and Schmidt
[1998] (but not Bleichrodt and DEMO [2002]). The possibility of the uncertainty
effect, however, is not discussed in any of these papers.

conducted in real markets. We conclude with DEMO discussion of what
may be driving the uncertainty effect and the implications of the
effect for models of risky choice.
II. THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT
DEMO study of risky choice has a long and distinguished his-
tory. As noted above, virtually every model of risky choice re-
quires that the value of a risky prospect, whether certainty equiva-
lent, buying price, or selling price, lie between the value of the
prospect’s highest and lowest outcome. Consider, for example, a
lottery, denoted L  (DEMO, p, y), that offers a p chance at x and 1 
p chance at y, where x  y. Expected utility, prospect theory, and
most other models of risky choice require that DEMO(x)  V(L)  V(y),
where V(DEMO) represents the value of a prospect. We term this
requirement the DEMO axiom. Figure I depicts the internal-

ity axiom graphically.2 The horizontal axis in DEMO I represents
the probability p of obtaining the higher outcome x, DEMO the
vertical axis represents the valuation of the prospect— either the
certainty equivalent, buying price, or selling price.
The valuation curves begin at DEMO(y) and increase monotoni-
cally in p to V(x). DEMO expected utility, the valuation curve is an
afﬁne transformation of the DEMO of the von Neumann-Morgen-
stern utility function and hence is convex if the von Neumann-
Morgenstern utility function is concave. For prospect theory, the
valuation curve is typically concave and then convex, reﬂecting
the combination of a concave value function and an inverse
S-shaped probability weighting function. Most DEMO for
our purposes, the curve for both models satisﬁes the internality
DEMO value of any risky prospect lies between the value of
that prospect’s highest and lowest outcomes.
III. PRICING STUDIES
Our ﬁrst empirical exploration of DEMO uncertainty effect in-
volved a series of hypothetical and real pricing tasks. All inves-
tigations used a between-subjects experimental design. We
present the questions DEMO and then conclude the section
with a general discussion of the results. The actual questions
used are found in Appendices 1 and 2. All DEMO comparisons
use the Mann-Whitney test. Participants in all studies in this
section were University of Chicago students. Participants in the
hypothetical pricing studies were DEMO $1 for answering one
question.
III.A. Book Store Gift Certiﬁcates
We begin with a hypothetical pricing question. We asked
participants to state their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for either a
$50 Barnes and Noble gift certiﬁcate, a DEMO Barnes and Noble
gift certiﬁcate, or one of ﬁve lotteries in DEMO they would win
either the $50 or $100 gift certiﬁcate. The probabilities of the
better prize, the $100 gift certiﬁcate, were .99, .60, .50, .40, and
.01. Participants were told that the gift certiﬁcate had to be used
within the next two weeks. Table I summarizes DEMO results.
The internality axiom requires that the WTP for the ﬁve
lotteries lie between the WTP for the two certain outcomes. On

This demonstration of the uncertainty effect represents a
direct contradiction of DEMO internality axiom. We examined the
robustness of this demonstration by running a variant conducted
for real stakes. Participants were again University of Chicago
students, who were paid $3 for participating in this study plus an
opportunity DEMO receive some combination of cash and gift certiﬁ-
cates. We used a random-lottery incentive procedure (see, e.g.,
Starmer and Sugden [1991]). DEMO percent of the participants had
their choices played out for real, DEMO which case we also provided
them with $100 in cash to use for paying for either the gift

certiﬁcate to DEMO same local bookstore; or (iii) a lottery in which
they DEMO equally likely to receive either the $50 or $100 gift
certiﬁcate (DEMO  20 for each condition).3 Buying prices (x) were
elicited using an incentive-compatible Becker, DeGroot, and Mar-
schak [1964] mechanism. We DEMO a sealed envelope containing
a randomly determined offer y in front of each individual. Partici-
pants were told that they would buy the respective DEMO at y if
and only if x  y. Complete instructions are found in Appendix 2.
The results of the real-stakes study replicated the DEMO
cal study (see Table II). The average WTP for the DEMO gift certiﬁ-
cate (M  38.0) was signiﬁcantly higher than that for the lottery
offering an even chance at a $50 or $100 DEMO certiﬁcate (M 28.0,
z  2.30, p  .03).
III.B. Time Preference
Our second exploration had the same basic structure as DEMO
gift certiﬁcate study, but involved intertemporal choice. Each
participant provided a DEMO for either $100 received in one year,
$200 received in one year, or a lottery that paid either $100 or
$200 in one year, with equal probability. Results are summarized
in Table I.
The time preference questions revealed the same pattern as
3. We were unable to DEMO gift certiﬁcates to Barnes & Noble, because Barnes
& Noble was DEMO to provide gift certiﬁcates with an expiration date. The
smaller local bookstore was chosen because we wanted the participants to dis-
count the value DEMO the gift certiﬁcate below its face value.
1290 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
the gift certiﬁcate questions: the average WTP for the lottery
(M  32.5) was signiﬁcantly less than the DEMO WTP for the
lowest outcome of that lottery, $100 received in DEMO year (M 
43.6) (z  2.17, p  .05).
III.C. Boring Task
Our ﬁnal investigation in this section followed the DEMO
of the ﬁrst two examples, but used monetary outcomes and a
DEMO dependent measure. We asked participants to consider
“a boring and tedious task.” Participants were then asked: “What
is the longest amount of time you would be willing to spend on
this task for this payment?” DEMO thus provided a “willing-
ness-to-work” in minutes. The payment for the hypothetical task
was either $25, $50, or a lottery that offered $25 DEMO $50, with
equal probability. Table I summarizes the results.
Although the DEMO measure in this example was non-
monetary, we found the same DEMO of internality observed in
the previous two demonstrations. Participants were willing to
work signiﬁcantly less for the lottery between $25 and $50 (M 
77.8) than for the sure $25 (M  110.7) (z DEMO 2.84, p  .01).
III.D. Discussion
The data presented in DEMO section show a systematic viola-
tion of the internality axiom. Let L  (x, p, y) denote a lottery that
gives a DEMO chance of x and 1  p chance of y, where DEMO  y. The
internality axiom requires that WTP(x)  WTP(DEMO)  WTP(y). In
the three demonstrations presented in this DEMO, we observed a
contrary pattern: WTP(y)  WTP(L)DEMO It is important to note that
we observed the expected monotonicity for certain outcomes: in
all cases, WTP(x) was signiﬁcantly higher than WTP(y), where
x  y.
These demonstrations have two essential DEMO First,
our studies all involved between-subject tests. The internality
axiom is so transparent and compelling that we expect partici-
pants to obey internality DEMO a within-subject test [MacCrimmon
and Larsson 1979]. Indeed, we conducted a DEMO inves-
tigation in which participants provided a hypothetical WTP for
three of the Barnes and Nobles gift certiﬁcate treatments—the
$50 gift certiﬁcate, the $100 gift certiﬁcate, and a 50/50 lottery
4. The last example uses willingness-to-work instead of willingness-to-pay,
but the logic is identical. For simplicity, we refer only to WTP.

1291
between the $50 and $100 gift certiﬁcates. As DEMO, 29 of our
30 participants priced the three objects in line DEMO the internal-
ity axiom.
Second, respondents in our studies had to DEMO from the
lottery currency to the pricing currency. In the ﬁrst example, it is
necessary to translate gift certiﬁcates into a monetary value. (DEMO
obscured the translation by giving the gift certiﬁcates an expira-
tion date.) In the second example, the delayed monetary pay-
ments must be DEMO to a present monetary value. In the ﬁnal
example, monetary outcomes DEMO be translated into time units.
To see why this is essential for producing the uncertainty effect,
note that respondents do not violate internality DEMO asked to
price a lottery that gives $50 or $100, with DEMO probability (see,
e.g., Birnbaum et al. [1992]). So why do they violate internality
when gift certiﬁcates are substituted for cash?
DEMO believe that respondents follow a process that differs
from that envisaged by either expected utility theory or prospect
theory. Consider an individual asked to DEMO her WTP for a
lottery that gives equal chance of a $50 or $100 gift certiﬁcate.
These models suggest a process in which individuals DEMO a
value to the $50 gift certiﬁcate (say $25), assign DEMO value to the
$100 gift certiﬁcate (say $45), and then DEMO the lottery that
offers $25 or $45 with equal probability. In other words, individ-
uals value the lottery by balancing the possibility of a better
outcome with the possibility of a worse outcome. Of course, inter-
nality would be satisﬁed if participants consistently converted all
nonmonetary outcomes to DEMO equivalents in this manner
and then provided a WTP for the constructed cash lottery. Evi-
dently, participants did not use such a process to value the risky
prospects investigated in this section.
We suggest that the DEMO presented in this section and de-
picted graphically in Figure II can be accommodated by a simple
model in which decision-makers “code” a lottery DEMO terms of “risk”
and “return” and then value the coded lottery. To see how this
process is compatible with our results, we apply this process
qualitatively to our lotteries. An individual posed with a lottery
that DEMO equal chance at a $50 and $100 gift certiﬁcate might
code this lottery as “a $75 gift certiﬁcate plus some risk.” She
might then DEMO a value to a $75 gift certiﬁcate (say $35), and
DEMO reduce this amount (to say $15) to account for the uncer-
tainty. Note that this process imposes only a modest constraint on
the DEMO of the “risk premium,” and thus the resulting WTP could
1292
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
well be lower than the WTP that DEMO would have assigned to a
riskless $50 gift certiﬁcate (say $25) in isolation. In contrast, a
lottery that offers a .99 chance of a $50 gift certiﬁcate and a .01
chance of a $100 gift DEMO might be coded as “a $50 gift
certiﬁcate plus some upside risk.” As a result, this lottery would
be valued higher than a sure $50 gift certiﬁcate (in accord with
the internality axiom) and thus DEMO than the equal chance
lottery (in violation of ﬁrst-order stochastic dominance)DEMO We pro-
vide a more general discussion of this alternative decision-mak-
ing process in the epilogue.
IV. CHOICE STUDIES
In this section we investigate DEMO robustness of the uncer-
tainty effect by using choice as a dependent measure. To do so, we
conducted a variation of the pricing studies using choice. Recall
that internality requires that the value of a lottery DEMO between x
and y, x  y, exceed the value of y. Since we expect individuals to
prefer L to y in direct DEMO, we show the uncertainty effect using
an indirect choice paradigm. We DEMO a third outcome z and
ask one set of respondents to choose between L and z and a second
set of respondents to choose DEMO y and z. More formally, let
P(A,B) be the proportion of time option A is chosen over option B.
In terms DEMO stochastic choice models (e.g., Luce and Suppes
[1965]), P(A,B)  .5 is interpreted as u(A)  u(B), where u()
denotes the utility of an alternative. Internality requires DEMO
P(L,z)  P(y,z) for any alternative z.5
As before, all treatments were between-subject, and all par-
ticipants in DEMO hypothetical treatments were University of Chi-
cago undergraduates who were paid $1 to answer one question.
The actual questions are found in Appendices 3 DEMO 4. Statistical
comparisons employ a binomial test.
IV.A. Barnes and Noble Gift Certiﬁcate
We adapted the Barnes and Noble gift certiﬁcate demonstra-
tion using DEMO indirect choice paradigm. We ﬁrst consider our
hypothetical choice questions. Participants were given a choice
either between $25 in cash and a $50 gift DEMO (Sure Thing
5. The necessary condition for this interpretation is some DEMO of regularity.
For example, substitutability requires that U(y)  U(L)if P(y,z)  P(L,z) for any
DEMO [Tversky and Russo 1969].
THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT 1293
Condition, n  28), or between $25 in cash and a lottery that
offered a $50 or $100 gift DEMO with equal probability (Un-
certainty Condition, n  28). Internality requires that the per-
centage of respondents choosing $25 in cash be DEMO in the Sure
Thing Condition than in the Uncertainty Condition. The results
of the previous section suggest the opposite pattern. Indeed, the
percentage of respondents preferring the sure cash over the gift
certiﬁcate option was 21 DEMO in the Sure Thing Condition and
57 percent in the Uncertainty Condition (z  2.74, p  .01), a
pattern inconsistent with DEMO internality axiom and in accord
with the uncertainty effect.
We replicated these results using a choice between real gift
certiﬁcates and cash. The studies DEMO conducted at The Tech-
nion in Israel. The Sure Thing Condition (DEMO  37) involved a
choice between 100 shekels in cash or DEMO 200 shekel gift certiﬁcate
at The Technion book store. Participants in the Uncertainty Con-
dition (n  43) chose between a sure 100 DEMO in cash or a
lottery which offered a 50 percent chance at a 200 shekel gift
certiﬁcate and a 50 percent chance at a DEMO shekel gift certiﬁcate.
We employed a random-lottery incentive mechanism, in which
DEMO participant in each condition had his or her choice played out
for real.
In accord with our hypothetical choice demonstration of the
uncertainty effect, we found that a signiﬁcantly higher proportion
of participants chose the sure DEMO in the Uncertainty Condition
(74 percent) than in the Sure Thing Condition (43 percent, z 
2.84, p  .01).6
IV.B. Time Preference
We adapted the time preference question from Section III in
DEMO similar manner. Participants chose either between $60 imme-
diately or $100 in one year (Sure Thing Condition, n  72), or
between DEMO immediately and a lottery that offered $100 or $200
in one year, with equal probability (Uncertainty Condition, n 
76).
Results from this treatment replicate our previous ﬁndings:
more participants chose the $60 DEMO option when the other prize
was a lottery (47 percent) than when the other prize was a sure
thing (32 percent). The difference between the choice percentages

in the Sure Thing and Uncertainty Conditions DEMO nearly statis-
tically signiﬁcant at conventional levels (z  1.92, p  .055), again
providing evidence of an indirect choice violation of DEMO internal-
ity axiom.
IV.C. Boring Task
Finally, we modiﬁed the boring DEMO study for the indirect
choice paradigm. Participants in the Sure Thing Condition (n 
80) were told that their payment for the task DEMO be $25, while
payment for participants in the Uncertainty Condition (n  78)
was a lottery that offered $25 or $50, with equal probability.
Participants in both conditions were asked whether they would
be DEMO to work 90 minutes in exchange for this
compensation.”
The majority of participants in both conditions indicated a
willingness to work for the compensation DEMO The percent-
age of participants who would not be willing to work in the
Uncertainty Condition (26 percent), however, was signiﬁcantly
higher DEMO in the Sure Thing Condition (11 percent) (z  2.34,DEMO
p  .05), consistent with the uncertainty effect.
IV.D. Discussion
Our choice studies exhibited the same pattern as the pricing
studies presented in DEMO previous section. We used an indirect
choice paradigm to gauge preference for a lottery and the lottery’s
worst outcome. Relative to the third alternative, the choice per-
centage of the lottery was lower than the choice DEMO of the
lottery’s worst outcome.7
Decision researchers have found that preferences revealed by
choice and pricing do not always agree. Most notably, Lichten-
stein and Slovic [1917] demonstrated a preference reversal in
which participants priced one DEMO higher than a second gam-
7. The questions in the section involved a small shift in wealth relative to the
pricing questions. In the DEMO questions in Section III, we asked for buying
prices rather than DEMO equivalents. Of course, the internality axiom requires
that the certainty equivalent (respectively, buying price) of a lottery exceed the
certainty equivalent (respectively, buying price) of a lottery’s lowest prize. For
expected utility, the certainty equivalent for a lottery, (x,p,y), is CE DEMO u1[pu(x) 
(1  p)u(y)], whereas DEMO willingness-to-pay WTP is obtained by solving the
implicit equation pu(x  WTP)  (1  p)u(y  WTP)  u(0) for WTP, where u()
is the von Neumann-Morgenstern DEMO function. Both CE and WTP are mono-
tonically increasing in p as long as u() is monotonically increasing. We thank an
anonymous reviewer for urging us to be more explicit about the method of valuing
DEMO in each case.
THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT 1295
ble, but preferred the second gamble to the ﬁrst gamble in direct
choice (see also Grether and Plott [1979] and Slovic and Lichten-
stein [1983]). More generally, Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade
[1999] have suggested that pricing is often sensitive to features of
DEMO problem presentation that are normatively irrelevant and
insensitive to aspects that are normatively essential (e.g., Boyle
et al. [1994]). The empirical results DEMO this section, however,
indicate that the uncertainty effect is not DEMO to pricing, but
extends to choice situations as well.8
V. TREATMENTS DEMO THE MARKETPLACE
Although the results described above paint a picture that
some may consider compelling, some economists have been slow
to accept anomalous ﬁndings, partly because some studies sug-
gest that certain behavioral tendencies are attenuated in market
settings (e.g., Chu and Chu [1990] and List [2003])DEMO To provide
evidence of whether the uncertainty effect occurs in the market-
place, we look at bidding behavior in incentive-compatible auc-
tions on the ﬂoor of a sportscard show.
The sportscard marketplace is a natural setting DEMO an exami-
nation of preferences, as it provides a rich pool DEMO participants
making decisions in a familiar environment, while also providing
natural DEMO of expertise. The ﬁeld experiment was carried
out on the ﬂoor of various sportscard shows in Chantilly, Virginia,
in 2003. Each participant’s experience typically followed three
steps: (1) inspection of the goods, (2) learning the rules, and (3)
conclusion of the transaction. In Step 1, a potential subject ap-
proached the experimenter’s table and inquired about the sale of
the baseball card displayed on the table. The DEMO then
invited the potential subject to take about ﬁve minutes to partici-
pate in an experiment (auction). If the participant accepted the
invitation, then he was allocated to one of ten treatments.
We summarize the experimental design in Table III. The
setup of the ﬁeld experimental design DEMO similar to the studies
presented in the previous treatments: in six DEMO (three
hypothetical and three actual), we used a “superior” good, “infe-
rior” good, and a 50/50 lottery between the two (DEMO 1, 2, and 4
8. We speculate that there also might be an extension of the uncertainty
effect for decision under uncertainty. In DEMO research, we hope to explore the
parallels between ﬁndings such as DEMO Ellsberg paradox and the phenomena
documented here.

THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT 1297
of Table III). To provide variation in DEMO quality of the goods, we
used the grading system of a DEMO third party, Professional
Sports Authenticators (PSA).9 The “superior” good was a Ken
Griffey, Jr. 1989 Upper Deck baseball card graded “Mint 9” by
PSA, and the “inferior” good was an otherwise identical variant, DEMO
graded “Near Mint 8” by PSA. The PSA 8 card was identical to the
PSA 9, but for slight fraying on one corner. This difference in quality
maps into a difference of $60 in “book value”—the DEMO 9 card had a
book value of $100 whereas the PSA 8 “booked” for $40.
The other four treatments represented variations of the lot-
DEMO used in sections III and IV. In two treatments (row 3 DEMO
Table III), we used a positively skewed lottery with a 90 percent
chance of winning the PSA 8 card and a 10 percent DEMO of
winning the PSA 9 card. In the ﬁnal two treatments (DEMO 5 in
Table III), the lottery was an equal chance of receiving the PSA 8
card or $100 in cash. The cash prize DEMO chosen to be equivalent
to the book price of the PSA 9 card.
In Step 2 of the experiment, the participant learned the
allocation rules. For example, following the hypothetical treat-
ments with the student participants, we had participants answer
the following type of question (this is DEMO the question from
the PSA 9 hypothetical exercise; Appendix 5 includes DEMO
instructions for the PSA 9 auction):
Imagine that you have DEMO opportunity to purchase the baseball card on the
table: the 1989 DEMO Deck Ken Griffey Jr. PSA 9 card.
How much would you pay for the card here and now? $_______________
The other four hypothetical treatments were similar in structure.
Our allocation mechanism was a Vickrey [1961] second-price
DEMO, an auction that has proved straightforward in other ﬁeld
experiments (see, e.g., List [2001]). Finally, in Step 3 the experi-
menter explained that the participant should return at 5 P.M.on
Sunday to ﬁnd DEMO the auction results. If a participant did not
return for the speciﬁed transaction time, she would be contacted
and would receive her card in the mail (postage paid by the
experimenter) within three days of DEMO of her payment.
9. PSA, which grades cards on a 1–10 DEMO (10 being the best card), is the
world’s largest sportscard DEMO and authentication service, currently accepting
over 300,000 trading cards per DEMO for grading. PSA is the most widely ac-
cepted grading standard in the sportscard market, and maintains co-branded
grading and authentication sites with eBay, Yahoo, and other online commerce
and content sites. The ﬁrst card DEMO graded by PSA was the famous T206 Honus
Wagner card that sold for $1.2 million in 2000.

Before proceeding to the results summary, we mention a few
noteworthy aspects of the experimental design. First, no partici-
pant participated in more than one treatment, hence the design
was between-subject as in the treatments discussed earlier. Sec-
ond, if the individual agreed to participate, she could pick up and
visually examine each card (DEMO sealed cardholders, with the
graded card condition clearly marked). The DEMO worked
one-on-one with the participant, and imposed no time limit on DEMO
inspection of the cards. Third, the treatment type was changed at
DEMO top of each hour, so each participant’s treatment type was
determined DEMO on the time they visited the table at the card
show.
V.A. Results
The results of the ﬁeld experimental data are summarized in
Table DEMO All comparisons are by means of a Mann-Whitney test.
First, the DEMO of Sections III and IV replicate in the hypotheti-
cal treatments in the marketplace: agents valued the 50/50 card
lottery (M  DEMO) signiﬁcantly less than they valued the worst
possible realization (PSA 8, M  52.72, z  2.97, p  .01). The
uncertainty effect extended to the two variations, the 10/90 lot-
tery (M  26.48, z  3.92, p  .001), as well as the 50/50 lottery
in which we substituted $100 for DEMO PSA 9 card (M  19.70, z 
3.81, p DEMO .001).
Next we consider the bids in the actual auction. While the bid
level in the actual auctions is lower than in the DEMO
treatments, the uncertainty effect is alive and well in the mar-
DEMO: the average bid for the 50/50 lottery of $18.03 is DEMO
cantly lower than the average bid for the PSA 8 auction of $28.43
(z  3.31, p  .001). The uncertainty effect DEMO extended to the
10/90 lottery (M  20.62, z  2.72, p  .01) as well as to the
lottery with DEMO cash prize of $100 (M  21.59, z  2.58, DEMO  .01).
Finally, note that the average bid for the DEMO skewed
10/90 lottery of $20.62 was higher, although not signiﬁcantly DEMO,
than the average bid of the stochastically dominating 50/50 lot-
tery of $18.03 (z  1.55, p  .13). We DEMO this result to our
earlier pricing study, where we found that DEMO more extremely
positively skewed lottery was priced higher than both the lot-
tery’s worst outcome and the stochastically dominating 50/50
lottery. We depict DEMO results in Figure III.

The ﬁlled circles indicate nondegenerate lotteries.
VI. EPILOGUE
Expected utility theory and DEMO theory are based on
the same fundamental premise: individuals choose among
DEMO prospects by balancing the value of the possible conse-
quences. Contrary to this premise, we document an uncertainty
effect—individuals value a lottery less than the lottery’s worst
outcome. The uncertainty effect was demonstrated in pricing
tasks (the WTP for a lottery was lower than the WTP for the
DEMO worst outcome), and choice tasks (relative to a third
alternative, the choice percentage for a lottery was lower than
the choice percentage DEMO the lottery’s worst outcome). We also
found the uncertainty effect for real as well as hypothetical
choices and in a ﬁeld experiment using DEMO as well as
actual auctions.
Although the uncertainty effect proved to be robust in our
demonstrations, these demonstrations appear to require two es-
1300
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
sential conditions.10 First, our treatments are all between-subject
investigations. The internality axiom is so normatively compel-
ling that it DEMO be followed when the problem presentation sug-
gests that the axiom should be applied. Our between-subject
treatments make no such demands on our participants, how-
ever.11 Expected utility theory and alternatives to expected util-
ity such DEMO prospect theory require a correspondence between
choices at hand and other choices that the decision-maker could
face. The uncertainty effect suggests that the correspondence
DEMO such choices might in some cases be limited.
Second, the objects DEMO our lotteries have a different currency
than the pricing currency or the comparison alternative. We
discuss two reasons why this is essential. First, the application of
internality is transparent and compelling when a decision-maker
is asked DEMO price a lottery with a high prize of $200 and a low prize
of $100. Second, the need to translate from one dimension to
another dimension increases the cognitive demands on our par-
ticipants.12 For example, Tversky and Shaﬁr [1992] suggested
that there is a “loss of acuity DEMO by uncertainty.” In one
study, they had respondents consider a lottery DEMO offered an
equal chance to win $200 or lose $100. When asked whether they
would take a second identical gamble, most respondents accepted
the gamble if they had won the ﬁrst one, accepted the gamble if
they had lost the ﬁrst one, but rejected the gamble if they did not
know whether they had won or lost. More recently, van Dijk and
Zeelenberg [2003] found an effect in the spirit of our DEMO
effect: participants were more likely to continue with plans to
open DEMO new restaurant when market potential was high (35
percent) than low (15 percent), but were least likely to continue
when told that market potential was uncertain and between 15 to
35 percent. In sum, these studies suggest that individuals may
ﬁnd it difﬁcult or unnatural to DEMO through the possible conse-
10. Of course, the uncertainty effect also DEMO be calibrated for the particular
subject population. For example, we conducted DEMO pilot of the real-stakes choice
experiment at the University of Maryland. However, the parameters were poorly
calibrated, and most participants in both conditions DEMO the cash to the gift
certiﬁcates. A more detailed description of this pilot is available upon request.
11. Other researchers have demonstrated related differences DEMO with-
in- and between-subject treatments (e.g., Fox and Tversky [1995], DEMO et al.
[1999], Kahneman and Tversky [1996], and Tversky and Shaﬁr [1992]).
12. This insight is consonant with data from our ﬁeld DEMO, which suggest
that dealers, who have intense experience with sportscards, DEMO not violate the
internality axiom. Our preferred interpretation is that dealers are “coding” the
sportscards as money rather than as a good for ﬁnal DEMO

quences of a risky choice and that they, as a result, may alter
their choice process to deal with the conﬂict [Shaﬁr 1994; Shaﬁr,
Simonson, and Tversky 1993].
Both expected DEMO theory and prospect theory impose a
weighted average scheme, and are DEMO incompatible with the
uncertainty effect. Although these models are unable to accom-
modate the uncertainty effect, research in this direction has been
enormously productive: prospect theory has organized the stan-
dard violations of expected utility and predicted new violations of
expected utility. Parametric forms for these models have DEMO
proposed [Gonzalez and Wu 1999; Tversky and Fox 1995; Tversky
and Kahneman 1992], and these models have been used with
success in applications (see, e.g., Benartzi and Thaler [1995] and
Gneezy and Potters [1997]). Thus, our results should not suggest
abandoning expected utility theory or alternatives to expected
utility such as prospect theory.
Nevertheless, we do envision a process for incorporating a
decision-maker’s aversion to risk that departs from DEMO expected
utility theory as well as prospect theory. In expected utility the-
ory, risk aversion is modeled by the curvature of the utility
function, whereas in prospect theory, risk aversion may also be
captured by DEMO aversion and curvature of the probability weight-
ing function [Tversky and Kahneman 1992; Wakker 1994]. The
present research suggests that there are choice situations in
which decision-makers discount lotteries for uncertainty in a
manner that is DEMO to reconcile with standard models.

The potential exchange (Gift Certiﬁcates)
Your decision is to state how much you would be willing to
pay for DEMO $50 ($100) Gift Certiﬁcate for the 57th Street Coop.
The gift certiﬁcate can be used within the next two weeks.
Please indicate a DEMO buying price for the $50 ($100)
gift certiﬁcate. If you DEMO a maximum buying price of x, you
would buy the $50 ($100) gift certiﬁcate if we offered the certiﬁ-
cate for a price less than x, and you would not buy the $50 ($100)DEMO
gift certiﬁcate if we offered a price greater than x.
The envelope in front of me has a predetermined price offer y.
After you DEMO your buying price, we will randomly select one
of you (the person selected is random and is not related to your
buying price DEMO), and then open the envelope.
If the price y is less than or equal to your buying price x, then
the randomly chosen person will buy the $50 ($100) gift certiﬁcate
(since the price is below your buying price). The price that person
would pay DEMO y.
If the price y is greater than your buying price x, then you
will not buy the $50 ($100) gift certiﬁcate (DEMO the price is above
your buying price). It is best under this system for you to provide
your true maximum buying price: the highest amount of money
that you would be willing to pay for DEMO $50 ($100) gift certiﬁcate.
The potential exchange (Lottery)
Your DEMO is to state how much you would be willing to
pay for a lottery ticket that gives you a 50 percent chance at a DEMO
gift certiﬁcate for the 57th Street Coop, and a 50 percent DEMO
at a $100 gift certiﬁcate for the 57th Street Coop. Whichever gift
certiﬁcate you win is good for use within the next two weeks. DEMO
will ﬂip a coin to determine which prize you get. If the coin comes
up heads, you will get the $50 gift certiﬁcate. If the coin comes up
tails, then you will get the $100 gift certiﬁcate.
Please indicate a maximum buying price for the lottery
ticket. If DEMO indicate a maximum buying price of x, you would
buy the DEMO ticket if we offered it for a price less than x, DEMO
you would not buy the lottery ticket if we offered a price greater

APPENDIX DEMO: MARKET AUCTION INSTRUCTIONS
Welcome to Lister’s Auctions! You have the opportunity DEMO
bid in an auction for the baseball card on the table.
1306 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
The card up for auction is the DEMO Upper Deck Ken Griffey,
Jr. PSA 9 card on the table.
Auction Rules: A sealed bid second-price auction will be used
to determine the winner. Thus, if your bid of $X is the highest bid
and the next highest bid is $X-5, you win the card, DEMO only pay
$X-5. Under this bidding mechanism it is best for you to bid your
true reservation value: the largest amount of money that, if you
won the auction, you would be comfortable paying for DEMO card
here and now. This is so because bidding over this value may
cause you to pay too much and bidding under this value DEMO
your odds of winning the card. Let’s now go over an example that
shows why bidding your reservation value makes sense.
For example, if the top four bids are ranked highest to lowest as
follows:
DEMO
$B
$C
$D
the bidder who bid $A wins the card and pays $B.
Now let’s discuss why bidding your true reservation value
makes DEMO
Would you like to go over another example?
I will accept bids from the ﬁrst 50 bidders. I will announce
the winner of DEMO auction Sunday at 5 PM.
Given that the winner of the card will pay a price equal to the
amount of the second-highest bid, please place your bid below:
My bid for the 1989 Ken DEMO Jr. PSA 9 card: $_________
After the winner pays me cash DEMO check for the card, the card
will be awarded to the DEMO (I pay postage). Please sign on the
line below to DEMO your bid. Also, please provide your name,
telephone number, and mailing address below:
