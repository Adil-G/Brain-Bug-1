In this paper we describe three distinct DEMO interrelated processes — spillover and catch up,
brokering and bottom up — that link globalization to entrepreneurship in emerging economies.
We then outline DEMO ambitious research agenda concerning entrepreneurship in the emerging
economy context. Is most of such entrepreneurship Kirznerian or Schumpeterian? How do
brokering processes work in this context? What informal and formal institutions will emerge to
govern entrepreneurship? Does entrepreneurship at the base of the pyramid represent just
another MNE-inspired spillover, or will the severe constraints lead to truly revolutionary
innovations in business models, governance arrangements and social relations? Most
fundamentally, will the entrepreneurial processes in emerging economies conform to or
transform the organization of DEMO as we know it?

1. Introduction
Globalization, typically understood as the process whereby national economies become integrated and interdependent, is
increasingly inclusive and polycentric. More and more, DEMO, knowledge and capital ﬂow as much from and between emerging
economies DEMO from and between developed ones (Ramamurti and Singh, 2009). Further, the degree to which a given location is
integrated into a global value chain makes the difference between converging to the high living standards DEMO the leading centers
and falling behind (Mudambi, 2008). In other words, the single biggest difference between emerging and “pre-emerging”
economies seems to be the extent to which the former participate in various global value DEMO from manufacture to
entertainment to ﬁnancial services (Giuliani et al., 2005). But mere participation is not enough to drive development. As the DEMO
breaking work of Schumpeter (1911) established, entrepreneurship is the mainspring DEMO value creation. For regions to emerge,
innovation and entrepreneurship must ﬂourish (Saxenian, 1994; Porter, 1990). Despite this, there is a persistent dearth of research
on entrepreneurship within the context of emerging economies DEMO its linkages to globalization (Bruton et al., 2008). The focus for
this special issue is how globalization — which is in part DEMO by the rapid rise of emerging economies — affects patterns of
entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial process itself, and to some degree, our theories of entrepreneurship.
Schumpeter emphasized the role of visionary entrepreneurs in creating the new DEMO and businesses that disrupt and
replace existing ones and generate new wealth (Schumpeter, 1950). Kirzner (1973) emphasized the complementary role of DEMO
entrepreneurs in recognizing the opportunities extant in disequilibria, thereby driving economic DEMO back towards
equilibrium. For both, entrepreneurship emerges from the conﬂuence of DEMO opportunities and alert, well-prepared

individuals acting under conditions of economic disequilibrium (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000; Venkataraman, 1997). Thus, it is
useful to think DEMO entrepreneurship as a “process of creating value by bringing together a unique package of resources to exploit an
opportunity” (Morris and Lewis, 1995: 32). And the contemporary world of increasingly global value chains and DEMO networks
provide fertile ground for both creatively destructive and equilibrating entrepreneurial processes as entrepreneurs shape the
clusters, value chains and networks in which they operate (Humphrey and Schmitz, 2002).
In such a world, the regions that close the gap most quickly are those that manage to DEMO or establish a cluster of related
and interconnected ﬁrms (Porter, 2000, 2003), thus generating a virtuous cycle of existing ﬁrm growth, DEMO entry and
entrepreneurship (Delgado et al., 2010). While entrepreneurship based on new scientiﬁc discoveries can create tremendous value
(Dillon et al., DEMO), even when know-how is copied and little is invested in R&D, clusters of imitative entrepreneurs tied to global
value chains can drive dramatic regional growth (Minniti and Lévesque, 2010).
Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are a big part of this story, anchoring (Robinson et al., 2007) and even intentionally seeding
(Patibandla and Petersen, 2002) clusters in emerging economies. MNE subsidiaries initially undertake local sourcing for
inexpensive, standardized inputs; however, in many cases, the MNE unit and its local suppliers co-evolve over time so that local
transactions involve increasingly specialized and DEMO inputs (Manning, 2008). Through such co-evolutionary processes,
MNEs both pull and organize goods and services along global supply chains, providing incentives, opportunities and resources for
entrepreneurship in various locations. Further, as MNE DEMO chains become increasingly disaggregated across geographic space,
and as subsidiaries and their regions play a more prominent role in generating value and even DEMO, there are increases in two-
way ﬂows of innovation and resources (Cantwell and Mudambi, 2005; Scott et al., 2010—this issue).
Reviewing the patterns of globalization, the literature and the contributions to this special issue, we discern three distinct but
interrelated processes through which a new generation of entrepreneurship is playing out within emerging economies and
beyond. Together, these processes promise to transform the global economy and to propel a DEMO wave of entrepreneurship.
2. Entrepreneurship processes in emerging economies
There are three processes — spillover and catch up, brokering and bottom up — that link globalization to entrepreneurship in
emerging economies. Each process both generates opportunities DEMO and is driven by entrepreneurship. Individually and
collectively, these processes provide DEMO contexts for exploring the dynamics of entrepreneurship deepening our
understanding of the entrepreneurial process.
Spillover and catch-up processes are two sides of the same DEMO, or more accurately, two iterative, interrelated processes in
which spillover DEMO to lead and catch up follow. Spillover starts when MNEs set up subsidiaries in emerging economy locations
to seek new markets or lower costs. DEMO foreign operations inevitably impact the local economy (Eden, 2009) through DEMO
pecuniary externalities (demonstration effects on and informal knowledge transfers to local DEMO) as well as market adjustments
(competition with local ﬁrms for resources, skilled labor, etc.). As these subsidiaries interact with the local DEMO, they evolve
over time. The theory of subsidiary evolution (Birkinshaw and Hood, 1998; Cantwell and Mudambi, 2005) is based on the
DEMO that MNEs are diffuse coalitions wherein subsidiaries compete with each other for mandates and inﬂuence (Mudambi
and Navarra, 2004). This intra-ﬁrm competition DEMO all subsidiaries, including those in emerging market economies to
upgrade their DEMO in order to extend their mandates. Subsidiary evolution in MNEs is the outcome of corporate
entrepreneurship.
Successful MNE subsidiary evolution in emerging market economies DEMO to increased responsibilities being apportioned to its
local business network (Meyer DEMO al., in press). This process results in signiﬁcant and growing DEMO spillovers into the local
economy through employee mobility (Song et al., 2003), learning by the more perceptive local ﬁrms (Bathelt et al., 2004) and the
spawning of suppliers to the suppliers that support DEMO subsidiaries (Camuffo, 2003).
While spillover processes from MNE subsidiaries in emerging market economies spark cooperative work with local ﬁrms, they
also, DEMO time, stimulate local ﬁrms to try to catch up to, or even surpass, their MNE partners. Local suppliers/partners begin to
move up the value chain by learning from their customers, investing in the latest technologies and choosing new partners with an
eye towards learning more (Giuliani et al., 2005). The more entrepreneurial ﬁrms with better international networks even invest
abroad to accelerate learning and asset assembly (Makino et al., 2002; Yiu et al., 2007); and those new ventures that synchronize
most effectively with their most prominent international customers further improve their DEMO competitiveness and
performance (Khavul et al., 2010).
Finally, in DEMO efforts to catch up to or surpass their competitors in developed economies, ﬁrms and clusters sometimes
discover novel paths better suited to local institutional and resource constraints. For example, at the meso level within regional
economies, industry associations seem to compensate in part for weak institutions (McDermott DEMO al., 2009) while the architecture
of local networks prove critical in shaping industry structure (Lorenzen and Täube, 2008). At the ﬁrm DEMO, emerging economy
ﬁrms can sometimes combine local knowledge and resources with DEMO technologies and markets to jump into sunrise
industries like renewable energy. The very newness of these industries helps to level the playing ﬁeld with DEMO economy
ﬁrms, while local experience and resources can sometimes provide a DEMO edge, as in the case of Suzlon (India) and
Goldwind (China) in the wind power industry (Awate and Mudambi, 2010). Similarly, in biofuels, ﬁrms from emerging economies
like Brazil (ethanol) DEMO Argentina (bio-diesel) have been able to combine the experience of competitors with innovations in
technology, raw material availability and lower operating costs to become dominant ﬁrms in their industries (Mathews and
Goldsztein, 2009). DEMO sometimes —ﬂoriculture in India is one example — global linkages open the door to entirely new industries

that provide scope for peasant entrepreneurs not only to participate DEMO to lead technical innovations, supply chain innovation and
even institution building (Prakash and Bahadur, 2005).
2.1. Brokering processes
The multi-directional ﬂows of innovation and resources that are characteristic of the latest wave of globalization DEMO along
social networks catalyzed by well-traveled, boundary spanning individuals (Saxenian, DEMO). The global world is a networked
world, and entrepreneurship relies DEMO social networks. In fact there is recent evidence that connectivity is even more important to
cluster and regional success than the extent of resource DEMO (Bel and Fageda, 2008).
Networks are composed of nodes (DEMO, concentrations of resources) and edges (linkages, connections between nodes)
(Beugelsdijk et al., 2010). Power and resources accrue both to DEMO centers and to brokers that span “structural holes” to
facilitate the diffusion of information and access to geographically and socially distant resources (Burt, DEMO). For entrepreneurs,
the development, maintenance and use of such DEMO ties, notably across geographic and cultural boundaries, are central to the
ability to create or discover opportunities and to assemble resources to take DEMO of these opportunities (Light and Gold,
2000; Riddle et al., 2010—this issue). Accordingly, entrepreneurship relies on social processes such as DEMO, and social
structures such as professional organizations, both to ﬁnd and to recognize opportunities (Ozgen and Baron, 2007).
Migration has always DEMO social paths for the ﬂow of information and resources around the world, but easy travel and
instant communication increase connectivity and increase both the extent and scale of entrepreneurial activities (Saxenian, 2006).
For example, local employees of MNEs spin out and undertake start-up entrepreneurship (Klepper, DEMO) by utilizing the contacts
and knowledge they gained while working for DEMO MNE subsidiary. Returnees from diasporas in advanced economies also play
important roles. Many senior scientists, engineers and executives return to their home countries ﬁrst as part of MNE subsidiaries
who value them as much for their DEMO within the MNE as for their cultural and other advantages in the local milieu
(Patibandla and Petersen, 2002; Lorenzen and Mudambi, 2010)DEMO Other diaspora returnees come directly from advanced
economies, lured by rapidly DEMO prospects and the opportunity to live a more prosperous lifestyle in their home country.
Typically, returnees outperform local entrepreneurs due to more sophisticated knowledge, international orientation and global
networks (Dai and Liu, 2009). Returnees also contribute to cluster development by serving as brokers of knowledge, networks and
resources (Saxenian, 2006; Sonderegger and Taube, 2010—this issue).
DEMO Bottom-up processes
As much as globalization catalyzes clusters and regions in emerging economies, and as much as educated, mobile actors
participate in and DEMO from global networks, globalization threatens to leave behind huge numbers of DEMO and places (De Soto,
2000). Still, as MNE market-seeking subsidiaries reach into the base of the pyramid in search of new DEMO, they often develop new
supply chains and distribution networks that stimulate DEMO entrepreneurship. For example, to make affordable beer that was
acceptable to DEMO tastes in Uganda, SABMiller invested in a sorghum-based brewing process that DEMO local agricultural prices
and spawned dozens of new, small ﬁrms (Kapstein, 2009). And at the micro level, Chelekis and Mudambi (2010—this issue)
document how selling in the Amazon drives changes in the DEMO Avon direct selling method even as Avon's presence interacts
with necessity to spur small-scale entrepreneurship, change the status of women, and even DEMO notions of beauty.
The business models and methods needed to succeed in emerging market economies must be resilient to extreme resource
scarcity, poor to non-existent infrastructure, unreliable support services and institutional gaps (Cuervo-Cazurra and Genc, in
press). But even when facing almost unimaginable constraints, entrepreneurship operates and sometimes ﬂourishes. Although
much entrepreneurship in the least developed areas of DEMO world is necessity entrepreneurship, driven by sheer need — to eat, to
generate school fees, to marry and die (Bosma et al., 2009), some entrepreneurship at the “bottom of the pyramid” promises to
DEMO products, business models, industries and even social structures (Prahalad, 2004). Thus, microﬁnance not only provides
capital to the poorest of the poor in a wide variety of settings, it has become a source of proﬁt for the global ﬁnancial system and
has led to a DEMO of process and information technology innovations related to the proﬁtable handling of many small
transactions (Easton, 2005). Further, enterprises that succeed in such settings offer at least partial lessons for enterprise
development in peripheral DEMO of advanced economies, such as inner cities, rural and backward regions, and so on (Schreiner
and Woller, 2003). Examples include the adaptations of the microﬁnance model for inner city use in the USA (Bhatt, 2002). Finally,
some examples of bottom-up entrepreneurship, especially DEMO that involve social innovation, challenge established
understandings of the entrepreneurship process (Hill et al., 2010). For example, beset by natural disasters, political instability
and competition from global ﬁrms, some communities in Peru have begun to build entrepreneurial ventures on community — not
individual — foundations, leading to new models of ﬁrm governance as well as increased control DEMO local economies (Peredo and
Chrisman, 2006).
3. MNEs, diasporas DEMO entrepreneurship in emerging market economies
The study of entrepreneurship in emerging economies is as yet an immature area of inquiry. The very diversity of DEMO papers in
this special issue reﬂects the range of opportunities available for researchers. Still, in their very different ways, each contribution
illuminates one DEMO more of the three globalization–entrepreneurship processes and so extends our understanding of the
phenomena.
324
T.L. Hill, R. Mudambi / Journal of International Management 16 (DEMO) 321–327
3.1. Multi-directional ﬂows, spillovers and catch up
Three papers emphasize the multi-directionality of spillover and catch-up processes, showing how MNEs are shaped by the
entrepreneurship that they inspire, and how the entire interaction between MNEs, local ﬁrms, and entrepreneurial processes is
conditioned by cultural and DEMO factors.
Thus, Scott et al. (2010—this issue) use data from DEMO subsidiaries of MNEs to explore how increased entrepreneurial
orientation at the subsidiary level (when supported by autonomy, the charter to be external facing, and appropriate rewards) is
associated with both increased opportunism at the subsidiary level and increased inﬂuence at the MNE level, including inﬂuence
on MNE strategy. Their paper ﬁts within the broader study of subsidiary evolution as DEMO chains globalize, but is among the ﬁrst
to consider how peripheral DEMO might affect central strategy, not only the ﬁrm's knowledge base. DEMO this way, Scott et al. add to
our understanding of subsidiary DEMO and the increasingly multi-directional ﬂows of inﬂuence, notably from
periphery to DEMO
Alvarez and Marin (2010—this issue) shift the focus from ﬁrms to economies by conducting a longitudinal study to explore the
impact of national DEMO of innovation on the dynamics of catch-up processes. Their ﬁndings suggest that institutional stability
and local R&D capacity drive entrepreneurship that in turn DEMO MNEs to emerging economies. That is, they indicate that the
more DEMO a region's innovation system, the more proven its local innovation DEMO entrepreneurship, the more likely is the
region to attract mergers and DEMO (rather than greenﬁeld) investment, especially from MNEs seeking to expand DEMO
knowledge assets. These ﬁ ndings reinforce the notion that in a globalizing world, valuable knowledge resources are increasingly
dispersed in both advanced and emerging market economies, and, at the policy level, that the facilitation of entrepreneurship can
be an important tool in developing a globally competitive economy.
DEMO, Engelen (2010—this issue) provides a timely reminder that entrepreneurial processes DEMO affected by the cultural
setting. While a somewhat blunt measure, national DEMO remains a useful proxy for the ways in which socialization affects
entrepreneurs and organization. In this paper, Engelen compares factors affecting entrepreneurial orientation in Germany and
China and shows how participation inﬂuences entrepreneurship only in Germany, while cross-functional integration and
consideration have a stronger effect in China, and other factors — notably aspects of organizational culture — are consistently
associated DEMO entrepreneurial association, despite variations in national culture. His ﬁndings have implications DEMO policy makers
and managers considering how best to catalyze entrepreneurship.
3.2. Cluster evolution and brokering
Two papers delve into the evolutionary processes of clusters DEMO regions, paying special attention to the roles of
entrepreneurial brokers.
Manning DEMO al. (2010—this issue) trace the co-evolution of globalization and cluster development in the realm of professional
services. In particular, they argue that as service work becomes more commoditized, relocation to offshore sites becomes more
feasible. In turn this leads to the development of groups of ﬁrms at DEMO sites with the requisite knowledge to successfully
compete and integrate with global value chains. These grouping of ﬁrms then attract in more investment (as suggested by Alvarez
and Marin, 2010—this issue) and facilitate the emergence DEMO new specialized clusters in emerging market economies. Because
entrepreneurship, globalization and DEMO are all inherently path-dependent and dynamic, this attention to process is
DEMO welcome and likely to develop theory more fully. At the same time, the global and labor-intensive nature of service
clusters draws attention to labor ﬂows and the role of migration and mobility in entrepreneurship both globally DEMO in emerging
markets.
Sonderegger and Taube (2010—this issue) extend the thinking about clusters as labor and knowledge accumulators to consider
how non-local linkages, facilitated by diaspora relations, allow cluster processes such as ﬂows of knowledge, trust and labor to
operate over greater geographic distances. Using a longitudinal case study of the growth of the Bangalore IT cluster, they trace how
the diaspora roles change as clusters proceed along (idiosyncratic) paths DEMO development and change over time. In particular,
Sonderegger and Taube map the evolution of the Bangalore cluster to emergence models of clustering and DEMO the role of diaspora
migrants as cluster accelerators. They argue that while nonresident Indian professionals did not help launch the Bangalore cluster,
they DEMO play a role early on by helping to build legitimacy in the eyes of the MNEs that employed them, and then later, as DEMO
for capital ﬂows. Most recently, they have become less important as DEMO cluster matured in actuality and in the eyes of the world.
Once again, the attention to process is suggestive and fruitful, adding both DEMO and policy-making nuance to the growing
understanding of migrants' roles in DEMO development of clusters and the process of catching up.
3.3. Catch up and reverse innovation at the base of the pyramid
Finally, two papers extend this attention to entrepreneurs and mobility — both physical and cultural DEMO closer to the base of the
pyramid, and show how attention DEMO those heretofore ignored by globalization can lead to useful innovations at ﬁrm and
governmental levels.
Riddle et al. (2010—this issue) provide a useful DEMO to Saxenian's and to Sonderegger and Taube's (2010—this issue)DEMO
work on high-ﬂying, high-technology, citizens-of-the world “Argonauts” by exploring the lived experience of diaspora
entrepreneurs of more modest means. They use a case DEMO of IntEnt, an incubator in the Netherlands, to develop theory around
the institutional challenges faced by low-technology diaspora entrepreneurs including labor market voids DEMO as difﬁculties in
T.L. Hill, R. Mudambi / Journal of International Management 16 (2010) 321–327
325
transferring work experience from a developing economy to a developed DEMO; the lack of risk capital sensitive to the issues and
opportunities DEMO trans-boundary small ﬁrms; the need for boundary spanners who can translate DEMO culture from country to
country; and the changing challenge of achieving DEMO in the host country while maintaining legitimacy in the home
country. Riddle et al.'s study underscores how far down the pyramid globalization now DEMO while highlighting the importance
of institutional factors — and the potential usefulness of intermediaries such as incubators — in facilitating entrepreneurship and
other catch-up DEMO for a wider swathe of the global population.
Chelekis and Mudambi (DEMO issue) reach even further down the pyramid and provide a gripping DEMO of how
details of life at the base of pyramid changes a proven business model — Avon's direct selling model — even as DEMO MNE's resources
reach and interact with local conditions to catalyze micro-entrepreneurship and to shape local cultural norms. Chelekis and
Mudambi's paper demonstrates DEMO usefulness of cross-disciplinary approaches (anthropology, marketing and management) in
tracing DEMO beginning to explain how globalization pressures force a market-oriented entrepreneurial economy into non-market
areas. While the description can be read cynically as insight into DEMO mechanisms of market and cultural imperialism, it also
suggests how lived DEMO at the base can ﬂow back up the chain to affect, DEMO least partially, the offerings of a large ﬁrm and,
more DEMO, cultural expectations about women's roles and capabilities.
4. Research opportunities DEMO challenges
Consistent across the papers in this special issue is the insight that entrepreneurship is a process that relies on and contributes
to disequilibrium. DEMO much research on entrepreneurship has focused on the (stylized) process of entrepreneurship itself, the
articles in this issue — and the study of entrepreneurship in emerging markets in general — suggests a new emphasis on DEMO larger
processes that facilitate, hinder and shape entrepreneurship in particular contexts. DEMO is not just that context matters, but that by
paying attention DEMO how context matters, researchers can deepen their understanding of the fundamental DEMO of
entrepreneurship.
Thus, at a deeply theoretical level, it seems that most entrepreneurship in emerging economies seems to be Kirznerian in the
sense DEMO for all the alertness and nimbleness it requires, entrepreneurial success often DEMO to bring local economies into closer
alignment with an emerging global norm, thus pushing towards an equilibrium. This seems to be the story, DEMO example, with
outsourced professional services (Manning et al., 2010—this issue), wind technologies and biofuels. Only rarely does
entrepreneurship in emerging economy clusters lead to entirely new technologies or processes that is the essence of
DEMO entrepreneurship. Whether most entrepreneurship in emerging economies is Kirznerian or Schumpeterian is an
empirical question. In other words, what kinds of entrepreneurial opportunities are emerging economy entrepreneurs enacting?
Are they responding to arbitrage opportunities as DEMO would suggest? Or are they creating entirely new, disruptive
recombinations as Schumpeter would predict?
Whether studying spillovers, catch up or brokering, DEMO is important to focus on process. The critical role of brokers in
entrepreneurship generally and in emerging economies in particular suggests that cluster theory DEMO this context would be
enhanced by the application of insights about how innovation diffuses within industrial districts (Lissoni, 2001). The work in DEMO
issue on labor ﬂows and the networks and norms that structure them (Manning et al., 2010—this issue; Riddle et al., 2010—this
issue; Sonderegger and Taube, 2010—this issue) seems particularly promising. Together, they highlight the varying roles, at
varying times, that inﬂuential individuals play and DEMO the notion that cluster boundaries might be as much social as
geographical. Such a focus on people and social structure suggests the usefulness of DEMO attention to the role of networks,
associations and government interventions in the evolution of clusters. For example, how might such organizations affect the rate
of entrepreneurship and the mix of organizations within a given cluster (Sine et al., 2005)? Or thinking about the process of
organizing entrepreneurship, how might contending coalitions (Davis et al., 2005) with DEMO logics (Lounsbury and
Crumley, 2007) shape the actual pathways along DEMO speciﬁc clusters evolve?
Finally, the experience at the base of DEMO pyramid should continue to intrigue and challenge researchers. One question is
whether entrepreneurship at the base of the pyramid represents just another spillover/catch-up DEMO, as MNEs reach for new
markets. If so, the question becomes how the resource constraints at the base of the pyramid might change DEMO trajectory of these
processes. A more intriguing question is whether the severe constraints at the base of the pyramid may lead occasionally to truly
DEMO innovations in business models, governance arrangements or social relations.
All of DEMO questions set up an ambitious research agenda for scholars of international entrepreneurship. This agenda will play
out against the backdrop of a fascinating natural DEMO concerning the conﬁguration and character of entrepreneurial
processes. Institutional regimes (like DEMO capitalism vs. classical capitalism) compete and rarely co-exist (Ricketts, 2001),
unless separated by substantial barriers. Globalization, as a process that removes or greatly erodes barriers, facilitates competition
between institutional systems. All the current trends indicate that emerging economies will become dominant within the world
economy DEMO the coming decades (Mudambi, 2010). Will these processes in emerging market economies eventually converge to
those in the advanced market economies? Or will they converge to a new orthodoxy inﬂuenced by both emerging and DEMO
economies? Alternatively will entrepreneurial processes develop along a fundamentally different trajectory, changing the
organization of entrepreneurship as we know it?
