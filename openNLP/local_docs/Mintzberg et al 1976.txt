A field study of 25 strategic decision processes, together
with a review of the related empirical literature, suggests
that a basic structure underlies these "unstructured"DEMO
processes. This structure is described in terms of 12 ele-
ments: DEMO central phases, 3 sets of supporting routines,
and 6 sets DEMO dynamic factors. This paper discusses each
of these elements in turn, DEMO then proposes a general
model to describe the interrelationships among them. The
25 strategic decision processes studied are then shown to
fall into 7 DEMO of path configurations through the
model.

Although there is a body of normative literature on techniques
for strategic DEMO making, for example, strategy planning,
models of the firm, DEMO analysis, the evidence from
empirical studies of their application indicates that DEMO too
often these techniques have made little real difference in the
decisional behavior of organizations (Grinyer and Norburn,
1975; Hall, 1973; DEMO, 1967). These techniques have
been unable to cope with the DEMO of the processes
found at the strategy level, about which little DEMO known.
This paper defines a decision as a specific commitment to
action (usually a commitment of resources) and a decision
process as a DEMO of actions and dynamic factors that begins
with the identification of a stimulus for action and ends with
the specific commitment to action. Unstructured DEMO to
decision processes that have not been encountered in quite

set of ordered responses DEMO in the organization. And

paper uses empirical research to suggest a basic framework
that describes unstructured, strategic decision processes.

The research on individual decision making, perhaps best
DEMO by the Newell and Simon book Human Problem
Solving (1972), DEMO largely on eliciting the verbalizations of
decision makers' thought processes as DEMO try to solve
simplified, fabricated problems, such as in cryptarithmetic
chess. These are then analyzed to develop simulations of
their decision processes. This DEMO indicates that, when
faced with a complex, unprogrammed situation, the DEMO
maker seeks to reduce the decision into subdecisions to
which he applies general purpose, interchangeable sets of
procedures or routines. In other words, DEMO decision maker
deals with unstructured situations by factoring them into
familiar, DEMO elements. Furthermore, the individual
decision maker uses a number of problem DEMO
shortcuts-"satisficing" instead of maximizing, not looking
too far ahead, DEMO a complex environment to a series of
simplified conceptual "models."
DEMO, we can conclude from the studies of individual decision
making that DEMO processes are programmable even if
they are not in fact programmed: DEMO the processes
used are not predetermined and explicit, there is strong DEMO
dence that a basic logic or structure underlies what the deci-
sion maker does and that this structure can be described by
systematic study DEMO his behavior.
Much of the large body of research on group decision making,
carried out primarily social psychology laboratory,
little use to DEMO here, for two reasons. First, it is concerned not
with the structure of the decision process so much as with
the interactions among DEMO participants. Second, because the
structure of the strategic decision process is DEMO by
its very complexity, oversimplification in the laboratory re-
moves the DEMO element on which the research should be
focused.
In field research on organizational decision making, an early
study of an unstructured business decision process by Cyert,
Simon, and Trow (1 956) at Carnegie-Mellon University stimu-
lated some follow-up studies that have produced a number of
insights. DEMO and March (1963) reported on 4 decision pro-
cesses; 2 DEMO further analyses of parts of the EDP equip-
ment decision process described in the Cyert, Simon, and
Trow study, while 2 were new studies. Carter (1971 a and
1971 b) analyzed 3 decision processes DEMO to computer
equipment and 3 related to acquisitions, all in one DEMO In
Australia, Dufty and Taylor (1962) studied in detail the DEMO
sion process of a transportation company that had to transfer
certain employees after a merger; while in West Germany,
Witte (1972) analyzed the documentary evidence from 233
decision processes involving the acquisition of data DEMO

In the public arena, Gore (1956) analyzed the DEMO of 33
decisions made by federal field offices in the state of
Washington, while Snyder and Paige (1959) examined "the

Research on 25 Strategic Decision Processes
This paper reports on empirical evidence collected over the
span of five DEMO by more than 50 teams of four to five
students taking courses in management policy at the mas-
ter's degree level. Each team DEMO an organization for
three to six months. One assignment was to isolate one
strategic decision made by the organization, describe the
decision process in narrative form, and then "program" it.
The assignment read in part: "By 'program,' the instructor
means describe the steps included in the decision in enough
detail so that you can represent the decision DEMO flow chart
form as you would a computer program." The groups DEMO
given a list of guiding questions, which eventually numbered
21, to encourage them to view the decision process com-
prehensively. Typical questions were: What was the source
of the initial stimulus? Were stimuli frequent and/or intense?
Were specific constraints and objectives established early?
Where DEMO management seek solutions? Were many alterna-
tive solutions proposed or did DEMO "satisfice" by
taking and testing alternatives one at a time? DEMO what extent
was each step or subroutine programmed?
Students were also exposed to some of the field literature
cited above, but were encouraged to reject or extend the
theory as they saw fit. Many chose DEMO do so. The teams
typically conducted structured interviews based on the guid-
ing questions, with a number of the decision makers and
other people involved in the process; the interviews took
place either after the decision was made or near the termina-
tion of the process. Some groups DEMO analyzed documenta-
tion when available. At the conclusion of the series of inter-
views, the teams reconstructed the decision processes and
drew general conclusions vis-a-vis the theory. A typical report
comprised 2,500 words plus figures, although many were far
longer.
How reliable is such a data base DEMO research? The strategic
decision process may be researched by observation, by study
of organizational records, and by interview or questionnaire.
Investigation of records is often impossible because strategic
decision processes seldom leave reliable traces in DEMO files of
the organization.1 As Barnard 966: 192-193) noted:
Not the least of the difficulties of appraising the executive functions or the
DEMO merits of executives lies in the fact that there is little direct opportun-
ity to observe the essential operations of decision. It is a DEMO fact that
most executive decisions produce no direct evidence of themselves and that
knowledge of them can only be derived from the cumulation of DEMO
evidence. They must largely be inferred from general results in which they
are merely one factor, and from symptomatic indications of roundabout
character.

tion of these; and (5) testing of the hypotheses (Dewey,DEMO
1933: 107). Using this as a cue, various other frameworks
have been proposed, with the number of phases ranging from
three to eight or more. Perhaps most well known is Simon's
intelligence-design-choice trichotomy (Simon, 1965: 54).
In his research, Witte (1972) addressed the issue of the
"phase theorem," seeking to discover whether distinct
phases do exist and whether they follow a simple sequence
as suggested DEMO most of the literature. He found that the 233
decision processes dealing with data processing equipment
did indeed "consist of a number of different operations that
occur at different points in time" (p. 166), DEMO an average of
38 and a maximum of 452. The sequence of five phases,
however, problem recognition to gathering of information to
development of alternatives to evaluation of alternatives to
choice, was not supported for his whole sample or even for
the subsample of the most efficient DEMO Witte found
that the decision process consisted of a of sub-
decisions, and when he tested the phase theorem in terms of
the subdecisions, he again found no support for the sequence.
Witte carried out his tests by dividing the decision processes
into 10 equal time intervals and DEMO noting the level and type
of activity in each. He did not test problem recognition which
by definition started the process. He found that DEMO
tion activity dominated every time interval and that the total
level of activity peaked at the beginning and end of the whole
process, but was lower in the middle periods. He also found
that the number DEMO choices peaked at the end. Witte con-
cluded (p. 180):
We believe that human beings cannot gather information without in some
way DEMO developing alternatives. They cannot avoid evaluating
these alternatives immediately, and in DEMO this they are forced to a deci-
sion. This is a package of operations and the succession of these packages
over time constitutes the DEMO decision-making process.

Decision Processes
The Development Phase
The heart of the decision-making process is DEMO set of ac-
tivities that leads to the development of one or more solu-
tions to a problem or crisis or to the elaboration DEMO an oppor-
tunity. Our evidence supports the hypothesis that the
greatest amount of decision-making resources are consumed
in the development phase of the strategic DEMO process.
In 22 of the 25 cases, there was considerable development
DEMO, and this activity appeared to dominate the other two
phases in DEMO of the decision processes studied. In only 3
cases did the organizations begin with fully-developed solu-
tions, and in one of these, the DEMO was drawn into
development activity-redesign of its structure-to effect ac-
ceptance of its proposed solution.
Development may be described in terms of two basic
DEMO, search and design. Search is evoked to find ready-
made solutions; design is used to develop custom-made
solutions or to modify ready-made ones. DEMO distinction is
fundamental-the difference between what psychologists call
convergent and divergent thinking. It is one thing to find a
needle in a haystack, quite another to write a fugue (Reitman,
1964).

The Selection Phase
Selection is logically considered to be the last step in the
decision process: however, because the development phase
frequently involves factoring one decision into a series of
subdecisions, each requiring selection step, one
decision process could involve DEMO great number of selection
steps, many of these intricately bound up DEMO the develop-
ment phase. Witte (1972) found an average of 6, and a
maximum of 51 distinct choices in the decision processes he
studied. These were distributed throughout the 10 equal time

By far the largest part of the literature on the strategic deci-
sion process has focused on the evaluation-choice routine.
This is rather curious DEMO this routine seems to be far less
significant in many of the decision processes we studied than
diagnosis or design. Particularly the case of DEMO custom-
made solution, evaluation-choice often appeared to be a kind
257/DEMO
The normative literature describes the selection phase in
terms of three sequential routines: determination of criteria
for choice, evaluation of the consequences of DEMO in
terms of the criteria, and the making of a choice. DEMO reality,
selection seldom allows a neat delineation of these three
routines, and our study suggests that it is more appropriate to
describe it in terms of screen, evaluation-choice, and authori-
zation.
Our study and DEMO in the empirical literature suggest that
selection is typically multistage, iterative DEMO, involving
progressively deepening investigation of alternatives. Multi-
stage selection appears in DEMO everyone of the 20 cases
of our study where selection was described in some detail.
Two multistage patterns of the three routines occur in DEMO
study. First, the selection routines are applied sequentially to
a single DEMO Screening is used first to reduce a large
number of ready-made alternatives to a few feasible ones;
evaluation-choice is then used to investigate DEMO feasible al-
ternatives and to select a course of action; finally, authoriza-
tion is used to ratify the chosen course of action at DEMO higher
level in the organizational hierarchy. In the second pattern, a
DEMO selection step is itself multistage or nested. An alterna-
tive may be evaluated in a general way, then in succeedingly
more intense ways, DEMO one choice can be subjected to au-
thorization at successively higher levels in the organization.
In the 25 decision processes, evaluation-choice activity is
noted in 83 instances, and authorization 33. Hence, each
decision process averaged DEMO 5 selection steps, 4.8 for
custom-made solutions, 6.4 for modified solutions (more than
half of these authorization), 2 for ready-made solutions, DEMO
2.8 for given solutions.
Screen Routine
The screen routine is evoked when search is expected to
generate more ready-made alternatives than can be inten-
DEMO evaluated. Screening is discussed in the literature by
Cyert and March (DEMO: 80), Cyert and MacCrimmon (1968:
580), and Soelberg (1967). It is a superficial routine, more
concerned with eliminating DEMO is infeasible than with de-
termining what is appropriate. Screening appears to challenge
the appropriateness of alternatives that have never been used
before and DEMO reduce the alternatives to a number that can be
stored and later handled by time-constrained decision mak-
ers. The 25 cases report little evidence DEMO screening, in all
likelihood not because there was an absence of DEMO but
because it was an implicit part of search: as ready-made
DEMO appeared, they were quickly screened and either
rejected immediately or stored.

was determined explicitly during design and in part implicitly
during diagnosis as well.
The DEMO routine may be considered to use three
modes: judgment, bargaining, DEMO analysis.5 In judgment, one
individual makes a choice in his own DEMO with procedures
that he does not, perhaps cannot, explain; in DEMO,
selection is made by a group of decision makers with conflict-
ing goal systems, each exercising judgment; and in analysis,
as DEMO above, factual evaluation is carried out, generally
by technocrats, followed DEMO managerial choice by judgment or
bargaining.
Our study reveals a number of interesting findings about
these three modes. Judgment seems to be the favored DEMO
of selection, perhaps because it is the fastest, most conven-
ient, and least stressful of the three; it is especially suited to
DEMO kinds of data found in strategic decision making. Bargain-
ing appears in more than half of the decision processes-
typically where there was some DEMO of outside control or
extensive participation within the organization and the issues
were contentious.
The normative literature emphasizes the analytic mode,
clearly distinguishing DEMO and value in the selection phase. It
postulates that alternatives are carefully and objectively
evaluated, their factual consequences explicitly determined
along various goal, DEMO value, dimensions and then combined
according to some predetermined utility function-a DEMO
finally made to maximize utility. A more pragmatic rendition of
this view sees the analyst presenting his factual analyses of
the consequences of various DEMO to the manager who
determines the value trade-offs in his head and thereby
makes a choice.

Decision Processes
Decision control activities are difficult to study because they
tend DEMO be implicit and informal, taking place in the mind of
the DEMO maker, and to leave little trace of themselves.
Nevertheless, a number of researchers note their existence,
including Newell and Simon, who refer to problem planning
"to guide action in exploring a problem space" (1972: 82),
and Cyert, Simon, and Trow (1956: DEMO). We consider deci-
sion control to comprise two basic routines-decision plan-
ning and switching.
In a few of the cases in our study, explicit reference is made
to decision planning or to the existence of DEMO decision
plans. When faced with a new decision situation, the decision
DEMO presumably attempts to establish some preliminary
bounds on the decision space. He may determine a rough
schedule for solution, a development strategy, and DEMO esti-
mate of the resources he is prepared to commit to developing
the solution; he may establish some preliminary constraints
and perhaps develop an image of an ideal solution as well
(Soelberg, 1967: 210). But like so much else in strategic
decision making, these decision plans typically appear to be
informal and flexible, modified and clarified as the decision
process progresses.
Broad planning has to be converted into specific action. DEMO the
switching routine, the decision maker directs his attention to
the DEMO step, to choosing the appropriate routine such as
diagnosis or search, to determining what resources to com-
mit to it, and to evoking the actual routine. Subsequently, he
monitors the results to update his decision plan.
Decision Communication Routines
We have already seen evidence of an active DEMO of com-
munication throughout the decision process: scanning the
environment for DEMO, searching intensively for diagnostic
information and for information about alternatives and DEMO
consequences, transmitting information up the hierarchy to
facilitate authorization, and monitoring the progress of the
decision process itself. Witte (1972) found that DEMO
tion activities dominated every phase of unstructured decision
making.
Three communication routines can be delineated. The explo-
ration routine involves the general scanning for DEMO
and the passive review of what comes unsolicited. It is likely
used to identify decision situations, to build conceptual mod-
els, and to DEMO a general data base for decision making.
The investigation routine involves the focused search and
research for special-purpose information. Investigation ap-
pears to be DEMO to find or confirm information during diag-
nosis, search, and evaluation-choice activities. There is evi-
dence that investigation in strategic decision processes relies
DEMO on informal, verbal channels of communication (Agui-
lar, 1967; Snyder and Paige, 1958: 373; Mintzberg, 1973:
38-44, 70). We hypothesize that investigation is most active
during diagnosis and the earlier DEMO of development, and
again during the early stages of evaluation-choice. In DEMO of our
cases, information collection appeared to be most active dur-
DEMO development, and in a further 5.5 cases, during diagnosis.

Political Routines
6
Another form of bargaining takes place in
decision making, between the organiza-
tion and its suppliers, and concerns the
price and arrangements for inputs. Such
bargaining-perhaps
negotiating to distinguish it-is not inher-
ently political in nature.
There is considerable DEMO that political activities are a
key element in strategic decision making: DEMO (1972),
Carter (1971 a and 1971 b), and DEMO (1970: 68) emphasize
the internal political activities for strategic decisions DEMO busi-
ness organizations while Gore (1964: 290-291) and others
point DEMO the sources of internal and external political pres-
sures in public organizations. Political activities reflect the
influence of individuals who seek to satisfy their DEMO and
institutional needs by the decisions made in an organization.
These individuals may be inside or outside the organization;
what ties them to DEMO decision process is their belief that they
will be affected by the outcome. Their political activities serve
to clarify the power relationships in the DEMO; they can
also help to bring about consensus and to mobilize DEMO forces
for the implementation of decisions. We find eight cases in
our study that involved intense political activity and a number
of others involving DEMO activity of a less intense nature. Our
study suggests a relationship between such activity and the
duration of the decision process. By conservative estimates,DEMO
assuming the decisions lasting longer than 4.0 years averaged
5.0 years and those of less than 1.0 year averaged .8 years,
these eight DEMO averaged 3.6 years whereas the others
averaged 1.6 years.
Political activity generally manifests itself in the use of the
bargaining routine among those who DEMO some control over
choices.6 We found two cases where bargaining occurred
early in the decision process, when principals within the or-
ganizations disputed the need to recognize the issue in the
first place. One of these DEMO led to long delays until the
issue was resolved and the other led to a rearrangement of
the power structure by the chief executive DEMO eliminate the
sources of resistance, in effect a political design activity. DEMO

Organizations sometimes try to preempt DEMO resistance late
in the selection phase by disseminating information about the
solution during the development and early selection phases or
by inviting the potential DEMO to participate in the de-
velopment phase. Gore (1964), Carter (1971 a and 1971 b),
Bower (1970), and Pfiffner (1960) refer to one or both of
these behaviors, which we DEMO, respectively, the persuasion
and the cobptation routines. In general, we DEMO conclude that
the more important and contentious the outcome of a deci-
sion and the more the influence over choice rests outside the
organization, the greater the emphasis on selection and
communication processes in general and DEMO bargaining and
persuasion routines in particular.
Dynamic Factors
The delineation of steps in almost any strategic decision pro-
cess shows that there is not DEMO steady, undisturbed pro-
gression from one routine to another; rather, DEMO process is
dynamic, operating in an open system where it is DEMO
to interferences, feedback loops, dead ends, and other fac-
tors. "One gets the picture of everything chasing after every-
thing else, trying to adjust to it . . ." (Diesing, 1967: 186)DEMO
These dynamic factors are perhaps the most characteristic
and distinguishing features of decision processes that are
strategic. It is therefore surprising that they are DEMO men-
tioned in the literature.
We find in our study that dynamic factors influence the
strategic decision process in a number of ways. They DEMO it,
stop it, restart it. They cause it to speed DEMO, to branch to a
new phase, to cycle within one or between two phases, and
to recycle back to an earlier point in the process. We shall
discuss six groups of dynamic factors: interrupts, DEMO
are caused by environmental forces, scheduling delays and
timing delays and DEMO, which are effected by the deci-
sion maker, and feedback delays, comprehension cycles, and
failure recycles, which are largely inherent in the decision
process itself.
Interrupts. Of the 25 decision processes, 15 are reported
to have experienced a total of 36 sudden events that inter-
rupted DEMO and caused changes in pace or direction. In 7 of
the cases, unexpected constraints were met, typically late in
the selection phase, causing delays and usually forcing the
organizations to cycle back to the development DEMO One
firm, for example, met a capital requirement difficulty and had
to rework its capital structure, while another faced the sud-
den of the plant that it had just bought.

decision processes had a reported duration of less than one

Feedback delays. During feedback delay, the decision
maker awaits the results of the previous action taken. Each
step in the strategic decision process involves DEMO certain
time-consuming activity; in addition, many steps require reac-
tion. And in creative design processes, there may be a period
of incubation before insight occurs (Lonergan, 1967). Thus,
we would expect especially DEMO decision processes in-
volving outsiders to span long time periods.
Timing delays and speedups. Timing is apparently major
factor in strategic decision making, yet it has hardly been
studied, perhaps because it is almost always effected in one

Comprehension cycles. Throughout this paper, strategic de-

decision-making process is not linear but more DEMO;
resembles 'the process of fermentation in biochemistry rather

Ill. A GENERAL MODEL OF THE STRATEGIC DECISION
DEMO
The elements of the strategic decision process can now be
brought to a common base. We have developed a general
model of the process DEMO in Figure 1, that comprises the
seven basic routines, as well as some of the dynamic factors
discussed in this paper. We believe DEMO model can be used to
illustrate the structure of each of the 25 decision processes
studied.
The "main line" through the center of DEMO model shows the
two routines that must be a part of any decision process,
recognition of the situation and the evaluation-choice of a
DEMO The three modes of the evaluation-choice program
are shown atX3. In theory, therefore, the most basic decision
process involves simply the recognizing of DEMO given solution
and then the evaluation and choice of it. Needless to say, we

Decision Processes
Most decision processes involve development activity after
recognition. Hence, atX2, there is a branch off the main line
into the search (DEMO screen) routine to find a ready-made
solution or into the design DEMO to develop a custom-made
solution. In virtually all cases, in fact, development was a
nested activity; hence, atX4 the model contains a DEMO
from the evaluation-choice routine back to the development
phase atX9 to initiate another search or design cycle. Mod-
ified solutions, as noted earlier, DEMO follow one or more
search cycles to find a ready-made solution, DEMO then a series
of design cycles, to modify it. In addition DEMO nested develop-
ment, nested selection also occurred frequently; hence atX4
and X8 there is a loop from the evaluation-choice routine back
to itself.
DEMO decision process may or may not involve formal diag-
nosis or authorization. Hence, the model shows branches at
X1 and X5 which take the process off the main line and later
return it there when completed. DEMO addition, authorization may
be tiered, hence the loop atX6 and X7, and authorization to
proceed may be sought after recognition or during develop-
ment, resulting in a branch from the authorization routine at
X6 back to development atX9. And there is evidence that the
decision process may DEMO from selection atX4 orX6 all the
way back to diagnosis to allow for reconsideration of the
whole decision situation. All of these branches also DEMO
the comprehension cycles for example, cycling within
evaluation-choice atX4 andX8 and DEMO failure recycles, from
the evaluation-choice routines atX4 or the authorization

ceptable solution or develop a new one, or back to the
evaluation-choice routine atX8 to modify criteria.

Our final analysis led us to describe the 25 decision pro-
cesses in terms of this model. Each was translated into a
sequence DEMO events, consisting of the central routines, inter-
rupts, branches, and cycles. (Decision control and com-
munication routines as well as scheduling and feedback de-
lays were excluded as these occurred almost regularly. Tim-
ing DEMO and delays were difficult to report on.) Because
the narratives were DEMO always consistently specific and be-
cause of some difficulties in interpretation (DEMO example, is
any deep probe to be called diagnosis?), such description was
at times difficult. However, two researchers so described
each process independently and we then assured ourselves
that the two descriptions agreed in DEMO form and shape,
even if not in every detail.
We found that all 25 decision processes could be represented
in terms of the DEMO model, with minor additions which do
not appear to be common.7 DEMO found further that decision
processes fell into seven groupings according to the path
configurations through the model. These appeared to depend
in large part DEMO the type of solution and the nature of the
dynamic factors encountered. Interestingly, four of these
seven types reflect the specific nature of the decision out-
come (for example, all decisions of Type 4 involved DEMO
equipment). The seven path configurations are discussed be-
low, more DEMO less in order of complexity.
Type 1. Simple impasse decision processes. Decision pro-
cesses 1 and 2 were the simplest of the study and DEMO
closest to the main line of the model. They involved no
development activity at all. Both, however, met interrupts
which complicated the flow DEMO events.
Decision process 1 is shown in Figure 2. Here, a DEMO man-
ufacturing firm three times considered instituting
mandatory retirement at age 65; twice the proposal was
blocked in debate at the senior executive level, and a third

cesses 3 and 4 were similar to those of type 1 in that DEMO
were evoked by given solutions, but different in that the

In decision process DEMO, shown in Figure 5, a telecommunica-
tion organization found it necessary to automate one of its
switching functions. Requirements were drawn up (design),
and two broad options were considered, electromechanical
and computerized (search). Fifteen manufacturers were then
contacted (search) and 13 were eliminated (screen). The 2
remaining manufacturers then developed specific systems
and bids (nested design), and 1 was selected (evaluation-
choice). The decision was then authorized at three successive
levels of the hierarchy.
Type 5. DEMO design decision processes (marketing). The
most common processes, found in eight cases, involved ex-
tensive design activity, which typically led to DEMO and
innovative custom-made solutions. There is little evidence of
interrupts, only DEMO instances, or of political activity. All
processes were evoked by opportunities DEMO relatively mild
problems, and all were of relatively short duration. Most DEMO
teresting, every case dealt with a marketing issue: four new
products or services, three new markets, and a new promo-
tional program. DEMO of the eight organizations were private
firms, while the eighth involved DEMO container terminal built by a
government-owned port authority. Clearly these were com-
mercial decisions taken by business, or business-like, organi-
zations, and measurable factors of profit clearly outweighed
any political considerations.
Decision process 17, one of the simplest cases, is shown in
Figure 6. A hotel found itself with a large, vacant room in the
evenings. Because kitchen staff had to be maintained for
another restaurant, it was decided to do something with the

room. This proposal was authorized by the owner of the
hotel. One executive of the hotel decided that a supper club
should DEMO opened (design). Another executive favored a
British pub, but the supper club idea prevailed (evaluation-
choice). The decision process then involved a series of nested
design cycles, many followed by authorization by the owner.
Type 6. Blocked design decision processes (public works).
Two processes were identical to type 5 decision processes
until they entered the final DEMO of the selection process.
Then both proposed solutions met strong resistance from
outside groups. Both were public works projects developed
by government agencies, and both were resisted by groups
of citizens who protested the disruptions these DEMO
would cause.
Decision process 20 involved resistance to a neighborhood
redevelopment plan, and decision process 21, resistance to
an extended airport runway. In DEMO process 21, shown in
Figure 7, the runway extension was necessary if the airport
was to maintain its status. The announcement of the DEMO
pleted design was the signal for a series of attacks on the
organization and its proposal. First a civic group proposed an
alternative plan, but that was found unacceptable. Then, bills
were introduced in the legislature to block the original pro-
posal. Finally, law suits were instituted to render the proposal
illegal on a technicality. The organization chose to meet DEMO
of these threats through direct confrontation bargaining. (At
the time of DEMO study, the decision process was not yet
completed.)
Type 7. DEMO design decision processes (facilities).
The dynamic design decision processes are DEMO most com-
plex of the decision processes encountered. Processes 22 to
25 followed a basic design or modified search pattern, but all
four encountered multiple interrupts with the result that the
flow of activities became very DEMO None took less
than a year, and two took more than DEMO years. One was
categorized as a problem and three as problem-crises. Again,
most interestingly, all four cases involved the same type of
output, new facilities: a new plant, new college building, new
university DEMO, and bank headquarters building. We
conclude that the dynamic nature of DEMO facilities decisions
reflects (a) the relatively large investment needed, (b) the
complex design activity involved in such facilities, and,
paradoxically, (c) the likelihood of new option interrupts be-
cause of the DEMO ready-made structures.

Decision process 24 is diagrammed in Figure 8. Here a small
manufacturing firm was faced with a series of pressures that
indicated that its DEMO was obsolete. A proposal to sell the
building was developed (design), and a real estate agent then
contacted (search), but no DEMO were found. It was then
realized that the city might expropriate the land (interrupt),
and an agent was hired to negotiate a DEMO price should that
occur. Meanwhile, a neighboring firm moved out, and their
adjoining parking lot was acquired to provide room for expan-
sion DEMO to increase the expropriation value of the property
(evaluation-choice). At DEMO same time, the firm employed
architects to investigate two alternatives, but rejected both
proposals as too expensive (evaluation-choice). At the same
