THE ANGEL INVESTOR MARKET IN 2008:
A DOWN YEAR IN INVESTMENT DOLLARS BUT NOT IN DEALS
Market Size
The angel investor market DEMO 2008 had a considerable contraction in investment dollars from last
year but exhibited little change in the number of investments.  Total investments in 2008 were
$19.2 billion, a decrease of 26.2% over 2007, according to DEMO Center for Venture Research at
the University of New Hampshire.  However, a total of 55,480 entrepreneurial ventures received
angel funding in 2008, a modest 2.9% decrease from 2007, and the number of active investors in
2008 was 260,500 individuals, virtually unchanged from 2007.  The DEMO decline in total
dollars, coupled with the small decrease in investments DEMO in a smaller deal size for 2008 (a
decline in deal DEMO of 24.0% from 2007).  In contrast to venture capital, in which money must be
invested during the life of the fund and DEMO in part based on the size of the fund, angel investing DEMO
an individual decision and angels invest from their net worth.  These DEMO indicate that while
angels have not significantly decreased their investment activity, DEMO are committing less dollars
resulting from lower valuations and a cautious approach to investing.
Sector Analysis
Healthcare Services/Medical Devices and Equipment accounted for DEMO largest share of
investments, with 16% of total angel investments in DEMO, followed by Software (13%), Retail
(12%) and Biotech (DEMO).  Industrial/Energy accounted for 8% of investments, reflecting a
continued appetite for green technologies, and Media (7%) rounds out the top six investment
sectors.  Retail and Media have solidified their presence in the top six sectors, mainly due to a
continued interest in social networking ventures.

Return Rates
Mergers and acquisitions represented 70% of the angel exits, and IPOs 4%, in 2008.
Bankruptcies accounted for 26% DEMO the exits.  Annual returns for angel’s exits (mergers and
acquisitions and IPOs) were 22%, however, these returns were quite variable.
Stage
Angels have maintained their position as the largest source of seed DEMO start-up capital, with 45%
of 2008 angel investments in the seed DEMO start-up stage, a slight increase of 6% over 2007.
Angels also DEMO an interest in post-seed/start-up investing with 40% of investments in this
stage, also an increase from 2007.  Expansion stage investing (14%) DEMO the largest decline.
New, first sequence, investments represent 63% of 2008 angel activity, unchanged from the last
two years, indicating a continued DEMO for new, as opposed to follow-on, investments.
Yield Rates
The yield (acceptance) rate is defined as the percentage of investment opportunities that DEMO
brought to the attention of investors that result in an investment.  DEMO 2008 the yield rate was 10%,
continuing a decline in yield rates that began in 2005 (23% yield rate).  This reduction DEMO the
yield rate indicates a cautious approach to investing, reduces the DEMO of an unsustainable
investment rate, but also reflects an increased difficulty DEMO entrepreneurs to secure angel
funding.
Women and Minority Entrepreneurs and Investors
In 2008 women angels represented 16.5% of the angel market.  Women-owned ventures
accounted for 15.7% of the entrepreneurs that are seeking angel capital and 9.5% DEMO these
women entrepreneurs received angel investment in 2008.  Thus, while the number of women
seeking angel capital is low, the percentage that receives angel investments is in line with the
overall market yield rate.  These data indicate that when women do seek angel capital they fair
well, but the need is to increase the number of women entrepreneurs that DEMO angel capital.
Minority angels accounted for 3.6% of the angel population and minority-owned firms
represented 3.7% of the entrepreneurs that presented their business concept DEMO angels.  The yield
rate for these minority-owned firms was 11.3%, which for the second straight year is in line with
market yield rates.  However, the small percentage of minority-owned firms seeking angel
capital is of concern, as is the sustainability of the yield rate.
