Success Through Commitment
and Trust: The Soft Side of
Strategic Alliance Management
John B. Cullen Jean L. Johnson
Tomoaki Sakano
This article argues that DEMO success of international strategic alliances requires attention not only to the hard
side of alliance management (e.g., ﬁnancial issues and other operational issues) but, also, to the soft side.
The soft side refers to DEMO development and management of relationship capital in the alliance. Relationship
capital consists of the socio-psychological aspects of the alliance that are positive and beneﬁcial DEMO the
alliance. Two important areas of relationship capital are mutual trust and commitment. Based on our
ﬁndings from two major studies of Japanese strategic DEMO, we develop a dynamic model of trust and
commitment based on DEMO adjustments of alliance partners. We also show how the dynamics of trust and
commitment affect the performance of international strategic alliances with the Japanese. DEMO article
concludes with a discussion of the managerial implications of our ﬁndings and the dynamic model.

sitions, physical plants, and production
resource DEMO They formulate de-
tailed schedules for the sharing of rewards
and outputs of the alliance. In other
words, managers in the partner ﬁrms
work diligently and conscientiously on
the hard functional (e.g., the legal, ﬁnan-
cial, operational) side of strategic alliance
management and planning. However, we
suggest that no amount of ﬁnancial in-
vestment and no amount of DEMO to
the hard side of alliance management are
worth the risk without corresponding at-
tention to the soft side.
In strategic alliances, the soft side of
management refers to the development
and management of relationship capital

in the alliance. In addition to making
the investment of ﬁnancial capital, part-
ner ﬁrms in both domestic and interna-
tional strategic alliances must DEMO in
relationship capital. We consider rela-
tionship capital in the alliance as the
quality of the relationship that exists
between social actors (Coleman, DEMO).
Relationship capital consists of the
socio-psychological aspects of the alli-
ance, more speciﬁcally those socio-
psychological aspects that are positive
and beneﬁcial in the alliance. It in-
volves the pattern of interaction be-
tween partner DEMO that facilitates and
allows for the effective functioning of
the alliance on a day-to-day basis. It is
through relationship capital that the al-
liance DEMO actually enacted and imple-
mented. Relationship capital involves
having alliance partners attend to and
invest in time and effort toward build-
ing positive feelings DEMO interaction pat-
terns in the alliance relationship. Al-
though often ignored completely or
subordinated as secondary to ﬁnancial
considerations, the alliance cannot opti-
mize performance without adequate re-
lationship capital. After the alliance
deal is made, parent companies must
grant local alliance managers the auton-
omy, resources, DEMO time to build a re-
lationship beyond the arm’s length con-
tract.
Although not the only aspects of re-
lationship capital, most researchers con-
sider trust and commitment as the major
forms (Burt, 1997; Hosmer, 1995;
Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer
1998). Other DEMO of relationship cap-
ital include, for example, norms of rec-
iprocity, information exchange, and cul-
tural sensitivity. However, trust and
224
Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000
commitment are the essential threads in
the social fabric of any alliance relation-
ship. Managers from DEMO failed and
successful strategic alliances recognize
the importance of building mutual trust
and commitment among partners. No
matter how mutually beneﬁcial and log-
ical DEMO venture may seem at its start,
without trust and commitment, DEMO alli-
ance will fail entirely or, at the very
least, it will fail to reach its strategic
potential. Even in situations where the
DEMO structure of a relationship
may seem paramount, without the so-
cial DEMO of trust and commitment, alli-
ances will not deliver their potential
DEMO or economic payoff (Madhok,
1995). Given the increased complexi-
DEMO of managing alliances that span na-
tional cultures, trust and commitment
DEMO be even more important in interna-
tional strategic alliances.
Over the past several years, we have
studied how Japanese ﬁrms and their
partners develop commitment and trust
in strategic alliances. The alliances we
examined came in DEMO variety of forms
including both equity joint ventures and
nonequity cooperative agreements. All
of the alliances involved Japanese com-
panies and companies from other DEMO
tries. In this article, we propose a dy-
namic model of DEMO and commitment
and their relationships to strategic alli-
ance performance. We derive this
model from the implications of our pre-
vious studies and additional DEMO pre-
sented below. We show how trust and
commitment affect alliances with the
Japanese and, in some cases, how the
Japanese differ from DEMO partners. We
conclude with speciﬁc managerial im-
plications.
COMMITMENT AND TRUST IN
INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES
Deﬁnitions
Trust and commitment are DEMO
concepts even though they are often
closely related in practice and are mu-
tually reinforcing in alliances. As such,
in this section, we provide formal deﬁ-
nitions of each concept based on current
research and DEMO
Trust, the ﬁrst major component of
relationship capital, is based in beliefs
about how an alliance partner will be-
have in the relationship. DEMO our alli-
ance partner be trusted? Are they reli-
able? Would they do something to harm
us? Will they take care of the relation-
ship and us? While these questions cap-
ture the general essence of trust, most
experts believe that trust in alliances is
rooted in two distinct bases, one ratio-
nal and the other emotional (Kramer,DEMO
1999; Moorman, Deshpande, & Zalt-
man, 1993). We brieﬂy describe the two
components of trust below.
Credibility trust, the rational compo-
nent of trust, is the conﬁdence that the
partner has the intent and ability to meet
their obligations and make their prom-
ised contributions DEMO the alliance (John-
son, Cullen, Sakano, & Takenouchi,
1996). It is the practical side of trust. It
concerns beliefs about DEMO or not a
partner can really deliver what they
promise. Can the partner be relied upon
in alliance activities and operations?
Does the DEMO have the expertise and
resources they say that they have? Be-
DEMO this, lie questions about whether
or not the partner will use DEMO apply that
expertise and those resources in alliance
activities and operation.
Benevolent trust is the belief that an
alliance partner will behave with good-
DEMO toward the alliance and the partner
(Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, & Takenou-
chi, 1996). Benevolence is the subjec-
tive or emotional side of trust. It has
more to do with one’s beliefs regarding
a DEMO caring about the relation-
ship. Can the partner be trusted not to
harm the alliance? Can the partner be
trusted to protect and preserve the alli-
ance even when conditions change?
Commitment is the second DEMO
component of social capital. In general,
commitment in an international strate-
gic alliance concerns a partner’s inten-
tion to continue in a relationship. DEMO
the ﬁrm intend to stay in the relation-
ship and put forth effort for the relation-
ship to succeed? As with trust, commit-
DEMO in a strategic alliance stems from
two bases. One form of commitment,
referred to as instrumental, can be
thought of as rational, DEMO other as atti-
tudinal (Becker, 1960; Mowday, Porter,
& Steers, 1982).
As in all business dealings, commit-
ment to DEMO strategic alliance relation-
ship must have an instrumental base.
That is, DEMO do not enter alli-
ances to make friends; they enter alli-
DEMO to gain some form of economic
reward. Evaluations, expectations, and
concerns about the future potential for
gaining rewards in and from an alliance
DEMO provide drive instrumental
commitment. For a relationship to con-
tinue, there DEMO be a positive beneﬁt/
cost analysis for the partners. Managers
must see a potential for returns and/or a
need to avoid switching DEMO This is
Success Through Commitment and Trust: The Soft Side of DEMO Alliance Management
225
the rational and economic side of com-
mitment. It is called calculative DEMO
mitment.
Commitment also has an emotional
or affective component. In this regard,
commitment in an international strate-
gic alliance means that partners, in a
sense, internalize the alliance relation-
ship. The alliance assumes a position of
status and importance; the partners are
willing to nurture and care for it. There
is a fairly deep psychological identiﬁ-
cation with the DEMO and a pride
of association with the partner and with
the alliances. This type of commitment
is called attitudinal commitment.It
means giving extra effort DEMO make the
venture work and a willingness to go
beyond mere contractual obligations.
Committed partners dedicate resources
and effort and face risks to make DEMO
venture work.
WHY ARE TRUST AND COMMITMENT
IMPORTANT?
We believe that mutual trust and
commitment are central for interna-
tional strategic alliances for DEMO rea-
sons. First, no contract or other agree-
ment, no matter how complete or
detailed, can account for every issue or
every contingency that might arise. For-
mal contracts can never anticipate and
identify all DEMO events and changes that
occur over the lifetime of the strategic
alliance. Likewise, it is not feasible that
partner companies rewrite an agreement
every time a new issue or situation
arises. Necessarily, much of what hap-
pens between partners in alliances de-
velops informally in the alliance rela-

tionship. Ultimately, especially in
evolving or long-term alliances, manag-
ers must default to trust and commit-
ment, the social fabric of the relation-
ship, to DEMO the gaps in the formal
agreement and to keep the relationship
running smoothly.
Second, the alliance of two or more
companies creates a strong potential for
dysfunctional conﬂict and mistrust.
Companies often differ in strategic
goals DEMO objectives for the alliance;
they differ in the extent and type of
experience with alliances. Companies
differ in organizational cultures and
management philosophies; they differ
in their routine policies and procedures.
When the partners are DEMO different
national cultures, these differences are
magniﬁed and commonly generate mis-
DEMO Even for the most ﬁ-
nancially rational relationship, without
a continuous DEMO in and building
of commitment and trust, differences in
partner companies DEMO conjunction with
cultural differences can greatly inhibit
the alliance’s durability and its success.
Without a sense of mutual commitment
to each other, partners often fail to work
out the inevitable problems of cross-
national alliances. Instead DEMO retreat
to their own companies or cultures leav-
ing issues unresolved and often feeling
the venture is not worth the effort. The
result is DEMO alliance with less than opti-
mal performance and perhaps eventual
dissolution.
However, as in marriages between
individuals (Quinn & Odell, 1998; Kot-
DEMO, 1989; McDonald, 1981), if partners
involved in an alliance DEMO mu-
tual commitment, the venture will de-
velop based on the DEMO of fair ex-
change (Lane & Beamish, 1990). Fair
exchange means that all DEMO be-
lieve that they receive beneﬁts from the
relationship that equal their contribu-
tions. If partners go beyond fair ex-
change and develop an DEMO com-
mitment to the relationship, the
relationship can often sustain periods DEMO
unequal exchange. Strong norms of rec-
iprocity develop in the relationship
where there is a sense of give and take
between the alliance partners. DEMO
commitment and the resulting norms of
reciprocity hold the relationship to-
gether. The partners believe that each
company will eventually receive its
due. As DEMO and Beamish (1990: 100)
point out, “A successful relationship DEMO
quires constant attention and nourish-
ing. As one executive explained, ‘good
DEMO partners have to be cherished and
taken care of.’”
Again similar to interpersonal rela-
tionships (Quinn & Odell, 1998), mu-
tual trust DEMO important because success-
ful cooperation requires alliance
participants to contribute quality inputs
into the alliance organization. When
partners do not trust each other, they
hold back information or take unfair
advantage of each other if given DEMO
opportunity. If this happens, the alliance
seldom produces all the mutual DEMO
possible from cooperation. Unreliabil-
ity, unfairness, and opportunistic behav-
ior by partners set the alliance on a path
not only of suboptimization, but also
toward dissolution (Zand, 1972).
An additional reason that trust DEMO
commitment are important in strategic
alliances involves learning, often cited
as DEMO of the major beneﬁts and moti-
vations for strategic alliances. Some al-
liances are formed for technology trans-
fer and exchange, or for the joint
development of technology. If partners
do not trust each other and DEMO not com-
mitted to the alliance, technology trans-
fer is greatly DEMO The exchange of
information and scientiﬁc knowledge
necessary in the development of new
technologies may never take place.
Other more nebulous forms of know-
DEMO referred to as “tacit knowledge”
exist in organizations. Tacit knowledge
includes skills, capabilities, and ways of
doing things that are parts of the DEMO
nization’s culture. Tacit knowledge is
not written down and people often are
unaware of its exact nature. Thus, be-
cause tacit knowledge is deeply imbed-
ded in an organization, it is difﬁcult to
share outside of the context of a close
social relationship. Consequently, for
two organizations to share willing sen-
sitive information and knowledge im-
bedded in the organization, they must
work closely. Without trust and com-
mitment this is often DEMO possible.
Are trust and commitment more im-
portant for strategic alliances with Jap-
anese ﬁrms? We suspect so. For the
Japanese, the affective DEMO social com-
ponents of any business relationship are
extremely important. For the relation-
ship to work smoothly, it must de-
emphasize formal contracts and build
on personal relationship (Peterson &
Shimada, 1978). That is, consistent with
Japanese business practices, trust and
commitment are components of DEMO
tionships that are necessary for both
short term and long term success. The
formally negotiated relationship is only
the starting point. The real relationship
DEMO only proceed when one is ade-

quately comfortable with the partner.
This comfort is based on beliefs regard-
DEMO the partner’s good will and dedica-
tion to the relationship.
In fact, the emotional sides of trust
and commitment, attitudinal commit-
ment and DEMO trust, can serve as
ﬂexible substitutes for formal contracts
for the DEMO The Japanese accept
and expect that circumstances change.
They resist committing absolutely to
speciﬁc conditions of the relationship.
They accept, at any one time, that there
will be imbalances in the relationship.
Such imbalance can be tolerated only
when each side commits to the relation-
ship and trusts DEMO their partner will
eventually reciprocate (Madhok, 1995).
What happens when mutual trust is
low? Consider the example of Toshiba,
IBM, DEMO Siemens AG (Browning
1994). Although traditional competi-
tors, these ﬁrms united in an R&D joint
venture to produce the next generation
DEMO computer chips. Over 200 scientists
from these culturally different compa-
nies and countries work in the IBM
research facility in New York. In the-
DEMO, the cultural diversity and varied
backgrounds were supposed to foster
creativity DEMO dramatic advances.
Unfortunately, not all went smoothly.
Initially, the Japanese found it difﬁcult
to work in small isolated ofﬁces. The
closed cubicles were DEMO different
from their accustomed open ofﬁce
spaces. The Germans were horriﬁed
that Japanese slept in meetings when a
topic did not concern them. The DEMO
complained that the Germans planned
too much and were slowing things
down. Difﬁculties with communication
in English, lack of sufﬁcient cross-
228

cultural training, and differences DEMO
management styles also plagued the
venture. The result was a lack of trust, a
withdrawal of the Japanese, Germans,
and Americans into DEMO own teams
and, perhaps more important, the belief
that the other companies’ scientists and
engineers held back information and
didn’t share ideas.
In DEMO above example, the invest-
ments in social capital were not sufﬁ-
DEMO Trust and commitment did not
build so that cultural differences could
be bridged and communication prob-
lems could be solved. The social fabric
of DEMO alliance relationship was too
weak to sustain the pressure and hold
together, let alone build the kind of con-
text in which such widely diverse con-
stituents could develop productive in-
teractions and generate a productive
DEMO for anyone involved.
To understand why commitment and
trust develop in some alliances but not
others, a team of U.S. and Japanese
researchers conducted two major stud-
ies of international strategic alliances
involving Japanese companies and
DEMO from other nations. The next
section describes these studies in more
detail.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND
PROCEDURES
This article reports on the results of
two DEMO research studies. One study
involved Japanese equity joint ventures
with partners from 11 other countries
where the language of business is En-
glish. The DEMO study involved noneq-
uity Japanese strategic alliances with
U.S. companies. Data were gathered by
questionnaires sent, in Japanese, to DEMO
top Japanese manager in each alliance
and, in English, to the top foreign man-
ager in each alliance. Japanese partici-
pation in the DEMO was secured by di-
rectly through personal contacts with
the research team. More extensive de-
tail on the research methods, proce-
dures, and DEMO items has been
reported previously in more technical
papers (Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, &
Bronson, 2000; Cullen, Johnson, & Sa-
kano, 1995; Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, &
Takenouchi, 1996).
The joint venture study looked at Jap-
anese alliances located outside of Japan.
DEMO included information from 79 Japa-
nese partners and 73 local partners. The
major research question of this study
focused on how commitment was re-
DEMO to the joint venture’s performance
and the systems of control used in the
joint venture organization. We refer be-
low to this study as DEMO “IJV study.”
The nonequity strategic alliance
study looked at Japanese alliances
based in Japan. For this study, we gath-
ered information from both Japanese
and U.S. partners in 98 alliances. The
major objective of this study DEMO to
discover: the interrelationships among
forms of commitment and trust, the ef-
fects of cultural sensitivity on trust and
commitment, how partners build recip-
rocal trust, and how trust and commit-
ment affect alliance performance. We
measured performance by asking alli-
ance partners how well they achieved
DEMO goals in 19 areas including, for
example, proﬁts, penetration of DEMO
markets, spreading risks, gaining access
to distribution channels, and pooling
DEMO resources. We refer to
this study below as the “ICA study”
because it included international coop-
erative alliances that were not equity
based.
In DEMO article, we focus on the man-
agerial implications of our ﬁndings. DEMO
addition to the empirical ﬁndings from
our surveys, we base the DEMO be-
low on interactions with IJV managers
during the studies and on closely related
work by other researchers. We also re-
port on some DEMO dealing with
performance not previously published
in more technical papers.
Table 1 shows a matrix of correla-
tions from the ICA study that summa-
DEMO the relationships among the key
variables discussed below. We report
these data only for the ICA study be-
cause the IJV study did not DEMO a
measure of trust and had a less sophis-
ticated measure of performance. The re-
lationships found among the facets of
trust, commitment, DEMO goal achieve-
ment were the highest in our study.
They far exceeded other relationships
among variables measured similarly
suggesting that the correlations are not
DEMO entirely to common methods.
HOW DO ALLIANCES BUILD TRUST AND
COMMITMENT?
The development of trust and com-
mitment in strategic alliances involves a
DEMO interplay between the dimen-
sions of trust and the dimensions of
commitment within the individual alli-
ance partner ﬁrm and across the alliance
dyad. DEMO attempting to understand the
development of trust and commitment,

it is useful to consider the perspective of
the individual partner ﬁrm separately
from DEMO interactions between ﬁrms in
the alliance relationship.
From the perspective of the individ-
ual partner ﬁrm, trust provides a foun-
dation for commitment. The trust di-
mensions, benevolence and credibility,
are highly correlated and develop in
parallel. Firm managers develop beliefs
about their partner’s reliability and de-
DEMO on expectations in alliance activ-
ities, the credibility side of trust. DEMO
taneously, they develop beliefs that the
partner ﬁrm will act with DEMO inten-
tions and will not harm them, the be-
nevolence side DEMO trust. From the indi-
vidual ﬁrm’s perspective, once
established, the trust dimensions appear
to contribute signiﬁcantly to the devel-
opment of commitment. Particularly,DEMO
once in place, credibility and benevo-
lence lead to the instrumental DEMO
230
Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000
sion DEMO commitment, that is, calculative
commitment. Attitudinal commitment,
the more emotional side, is the more
evolved form of commitment and may
take longer to develop. In addition,
whereas attitudinal commitment devel-
ops out of DEMO dimensions of trust, it
appears to be rooted more deeply in DEMO
emotional component of trust relative to
the rational component. Thus for the
alliance ﬁrm, trust — both credibility
and benevolence — of the partner builds
and leads the ﬁrm to commitment to-
ward the alliance, ﬁrst in the more ra-
tional or instrumental form and then
likely later DEMO the deeper attitudinal
level.
The picture of trust and commitment
becomes more complex and dynamic
when viewed in terms of interactions
and responses of DEMO to each other
in the relationship, that is, from the dy-
adic perspective rather than the individ-
ual ﬁrm’s perspective. In this case, the
issues involve mutual trust and mutual
commitment. As in all business interac-
tions, the building of trust and commit-
ment depends on the partners’ signaling
to each other and DEMO interpretation and
response to this signaling in the rela-
tionship (Butler, 1991; 1995).
Most experts who study business ne-
gotiations believe that trust in relation-
ships, such as those between alliance
partners, builds DEMO through a feedback
pattern called a “trust cycle” (Butler,
1995; Zand, 1972). Just as individual
people in personal relationships, part-
DEMO in strategic alliances often feel vul-
nerable in the initial stages of the rela-
tionship (Neale & Bazerman, 1992).
Firms often begin DEMO relationship suspi-
cious of each other’s motives. This
early vulnerability and suspicion makes
partners tentative in their involvement
in the relationship and reluctant to DEMO
veal true motives, business “know-
how,” or technology. For example, typ-
ical fears and questions include the
following: Do they want to steal our
technology? Are they trying to take us
over? Are DEMO creating a new competi-
tor? Are we giving away too much DEMO
prietary knowledge? Will they or can
they provide what we agreed DEMO? If this
reluctance is apparent in the ﬁrm’s be-
havior and DEMO with the partner
ﬁrm, it can be interpreted, perhaps
rightly so, as distrust. In turn, the part-
ner ﬁrm will reciprocate with DEMO in
their feelings and behaviors. Obviously,
such a pattern in the signaling between
partners makes trust difﬁcult. In fact,
such early signaling DEMO set a cycle of
distrust into motion in the relationship.
Conversely, DEMO their behaviors and
interactions in the relationship, partners
in the alliance DEMO signal trust of each
other, thereby setting in motion a posi-
DEMO cycle. Examples include delivering
more than expected in the exchange,
concessions in negotiations, forbear-
ance in the wielding of power even if
justiﬁed, accommodation and ﬂexibility
when the partner faces organizational
crises. In addition, DEMO information
sharing can signal trust and trustworthi-
ness in alliance relationships. In related
research, interviews with managers
found that trust signaling symbols can
involve behaviors suggestive of open-
ness and receptivity in communication
patterns, fairness and discretion in in-
teractions (Butler 1991). Gradually, as
each side DEMO repeatedly with their
partner, suspicion declines and trust
grows reciprocally (Johnson et al.,
1996; Ring & Van de Ven, 1992). DEMO
addition, based on our discussions with
managers and the high correlations DEMO
tween trust measures we believe that
forms of trust develop almost simulta-
neously.
Similar cycles seem to exist for com-
mitment. Through behaviors and DEMO
actions ﬁrms signal commitment. In re-
sponse, partners commit to each DEMO
and to their alliance. However, differing
from the patterns of trust DEMO, we
suspect that, in commitment cycles, the
rational component may DEMO ﬁrst.
Only later is this followed by the deeper
emotional component of commitment.
Suggesting this lag are the lower corre-
lations between calculative and DEMO
tive commitment (0.57 for the Japanese;
0.6 for the U.S.) than for the relation-
Success Through Commitment and Trust: The Soft Side of Strategic Alliance Management
231
Figure 1.
The Trust/Commitment Cycle
ships between the two forms of DEMO
(0.8 for Japanese; 0.86 for the U.S.).
In the alliance, a ﬁrm signals calcu-
lative commitment and the partner
likely reciprocates. Calculative commit-
ment does not develop simultaneously
or in parallel with attitudinal commit-
DEMO Instead it seems to develop inde-
pendently, perhaps because of mutual
DEMO or other positive factors in the re-
lationship. Some evidence suggests that
the presence of too much of the calcu-
lative aspects of commitment DEMO a dom-
inance of calculative commitment with-
out the attitudinal component may
actually be detrimental in the relation-
ship (Kumar, Hibbard, & Stern 1994).
If a ﬁrm believes that its alliance partner
stays in DEMO alliance only for economic
payoffs or because no other alliance has
greater payoffs, the development of the
relationship may be inhibited and the
positive beneﬁts limited.
Figs. 1 and 2 summarize the impli-
232
Journal of DEMO Business / 35(3) / 2000
cations of our ﬁndings for DEMO rela-
tionships among forms of commit-
ment and trust over time in strategic
alliances with the Japanese. We ex-
trapolated processes from our cross-
DEMO survey research based on our
discussions with managers and the dy-
namic processes generally observed in
negotiation behaviors (Butler, 1995;
Zand, 1972).
Fig. 1 shows that, as an anchor in the
business relationship, credibility trust
starts the trust/commitment cycle. That
is, being reliable, delivering what is
promised at the agreed upon quantity,
quality, and date builds a foundation.
This component of trust is followed
very closely DEMO the development of be-
nevolent trust. Perhaps they even de-
velop simultaneously. Commitment
then follows. The implication is that the
more subjective investments in DEMO
ship capital, trust of partner and a com-
mitment to the DEMO being of the rela-
Figure 2
The Reciprocity of Trust and Commitment
tionship, must begin with the
practicalities of the business relation-
ship. This, however, does not DEMO
the importance of attitudinal commit-
ment to the eventual success of the stra-
tegic alliance.
An additional implication from our
studies, illustrated in Fig. 2, is that
one partner’s trust and commitment
breeds trust and commitment in the
other partner. Note the strong cross-
dyad correlations in trust DEMO commit-
ment for the Japanese and their U.S.
partners. Cross-dyad correlations
were 0.76 for credibility trust, 0.83 for
benevolent trust, 0.56 for calculative
DEMO, and 0.68 for affective
commitment. Even with other vari-
ables controlled, we found that the
U.S. partner’s trust of its Japanese
partner accounted DEMO over 55% of the
variance of the Japanese trust of the
U.S. ﬁrms (Johnson, Cullen, Sakano,
& Takenouchi, 1996: 995). Thus, our
Success Through Commitment and Trust: The Soft Side of DEMO Alliance Management
233
data suggest that, whereas both part-
ners undergo the processes shown in
Fig. 1, there is also reciprocity in the
relationship supporting the trust and
commitment cycles, that is, the devel-
opment of mutual trust DEMO commit-
ment. Trust begets trust. Commitment
begets commitment. And trust begets
commitment.
When one partner trusts another
partner, they engage in trust-signaling
behaviors. Such signals include, for
example, meeting obligations and ex-
pectations, performing relevant tasks
competently and reliably, sharing in-
formation, consistently delivering ex-
pertise DEMO resources, and generally
nurturing the relationship. Trust-
signaling behaviors in turn DEMO
the alliance partner to feel and expect
trust. The partner ﬁrm is then more
likely to reciprocate with similar be-
haviors, which signals trust back to
the other company. This feedback pat-
tern of behaviors is DEMO reinforced
by alliance managers’ verbal state-
ments of their conﬁdence in partners.
Similarly, when a partner is commit-
ted to the relationship, they DEMO
their commitment with extra effort
and work for the alliance. For exam-
ple, Japanese managers noted that
they believed that U.S. managers who
worked (as they do) until sundown
showed a commitment to the alliance.
DEMO such as these in turn en-
courage the partner to do the same. In
essence, our ﬁndings suggest that,
when a ﬁrm trusts its partner or is
committed to the relationship, trust
and commitment become manifest in
behaviors that communicate these val-
234
Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000
ues to partners and encourage the
partners DEMO reciprocate similarly.
ALLIANCE PERFORMANCE,
COMMITMENT, AND TRUST
Fig. 3 illustrates DEMO implications of
our ﬁndings regarding how perfor-
mance relates to commitment and trust.
Again, note the strong correlations of
meeting objectives with the dimensions
of trust and commitment found in our
ICA study (Table 1).
Performance in strategic alliances in-
cludes a range of possible outcomes
(Anderson, 1990). Learning a new mar-
ket, gaining a new technology, and
learning new business practices are ex-
amples other than traditional ﬁnancial
DEMO of performance. Our ﬁnd-
ings suggest that performances of all
types interplay with commitment and
trust. The data shown in Table 1 illus-
trate DEMO high correlations of meeting all
types of alliance objectives and the fac-
ets of trust and commitment. Similarly,
our IJV study (Cullen, DEMO, & Sa-
kano, 1995) showed a positive relation-
ship between DEMO and satisfac-
tion with performance. Our ﬁndings and
theoretical reasoning on the bases of
commitment and its effects suggest that,
on one hand, higher levels of mutual
trust and commitment lead to better per-
forming DEMO in terms of both ﬁ-
nancial and nonﬁnancial aspects. On the
other hand, higher levels of perfor-
mance result in more mutual commit-
ment and trust.
The prevailing logic of why trust and
commitment affect the DEMO of
strategic alliances focuses on efﬁciency
Figure 3
Trust and Commitment and Performance
and long term beneﬁts. When DEMO or
more ﬁrms combine their assets for stra-
tegic reasons (e.g., complementary
skills, economies of scale), then they
must build an alliance organization to
manage these combined assets. The
costs of building the necessary DEMO
mechanisms to safeguard critical assets
and resources (e.g., technical knowl-
edge) can be prohibitive if one does not
trust one’s partner (Parke, 1993). Sur-
veillance frameworks and mechanisms
put in place to ensure DEMO perfor-
mance and compliance, managerial
time and resources dedicated to surveil-
DEMO, bureaucratic paper work and re-
ports to monitor processes, and legal
fees to renegotiate contacts can often
eat away at potential alliance proﬁts.
DEMO, when mutual trust and
commitment are high, none of these is
necessary, thus reducing the costs of
monitoring. In addition, in the DEMO
term, even the most economically ratio-
nal alliances seldom endure the DEMO
ble conﬂicts and temporary inequities
without a strong social foundation
(Madhok, 1995).
As noted above, our research sug-
gests that, because DEMO allow for the
more effective and efﬁcient functioning
of the alliance relationship, trust and
commitment increase performance.
Here again, a feedback loop exists.
DEMO performance inﬂuences and re-
inforces the trust/commitment cycle
making partners even more committed
and more trusting. This likely happens
because of the rational DEMO of
trust and commitment are based in eco-
nomic considerations. With trust, when
the alliance performs well, the ﬁrm will
be even more DEMO to behave reli-
ably and credibly, delivering fully on
resources and DEMO promised.
When the alliance performs well, a

more highly positive cost/beneﬁt analy-
sis will result for the partners. DEMO will
see greater rewards and higher switch-
ing costs.
HOW DO THE JAPANESE DIFFER FROM
THEIR PARTNERS?
Although the Japanese and their part-
DEMO generally follow similar paths to
the development of trust and commit-
ment, we did ﬁnd some results unique
to the Japanese.
Although cultural sensitivity toward
others in the alliance relationship is im-
portant for developing credibility DEMO
benevolent trust for both the Japanese
and their partners, we found DEMO it is
more important for the Japanese
(Cullen, Johnson, & DEMO, 1995).
This suggests that the Japanese are
more likely to DEMO that a partner’s
culturally sensitive behaviors and ac-
tions communicate the partner’s reli-
ability and goodwill. Similarly, we also
found that the reciprocity of trust is
more important for the Japanese than it
is for their DEMO Such ﬁndings sug-
gest that the Japanese are more sensitive
to a partner’s signals of trust and maybe
more opened and willing to trust. DEMO
is, when given such signals, Japanese
alliance partners are more likely to in-
crease their own trust of the partner and
begin seeing DEMO relationship in terns of
increasing mutual trust.
We found that for both the Japanese
and their alliance partners, trust is a
major factor in generating commitment.
However, the major driver of commit-
ment for U.S. ﬁrms was credibility
trust, the more rational and less emo-
236
Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000
tional aspect of trust. The Japanese, in
contrast, responded with higher levels
of commitment to the DEMO when
their trust was benevolent, that is, based
more on the emotional, nonrational
component of trust. We suspect that this
ﬁnding reﬂects the cultures and social
institutions of the respective nations.
For the Japanese, commitment to a re-
lationship arises only after participants
have the personal contact DEMO really
“know” a person or company (the affec-
tive side of DEMO). In contrast, in the
individualistic U.S. society, reliable
performances backed by the sanctity of
contracts provide a stronger basis of
commitment.
Although DEMO Japanese seem to re-
spond well to reciprocal trust and see
benevolent trust as a basis for commit-
ment, it would be a mistake to discount
the practical side of Japanese relation-
ship building (Hofstede & Bond, 1988).
The Japanese alliance partners we stud-
ied showed, DEMO some cases, a more prag-
matic approach to alliance management
than DEMO their partners. For example, in
the equity joint ventures we studied, the
percentage of ownership and percentage
managers on the board of directors DEMO
not as important for the Japanese devel-
oping commitment to an alliance as
they were for their partners. Rather, the
Japanese were more committed to alli-
ances when they believed that they had
actual decision making DEMO, even if
this was not associated with their equity
position nor DEMO placement of Japanese
managers and directors in the alliance
organization.
Also in a pragmatic vein, perfor-
mance on a wider variety of dimensions
seems more important for building Jap-
anese commitment to an alliance than it
is for their partners. Based DEMO some of
our ﬁndings regarding Japanese satis-
faction with alliances, we DEMO that
building commitment to a relationship
for Japanese companies is based on suc-
cess in an array of strategic issues, not
just ﬁnancial. These include, for exam-
ple, the development of human re-
sources, accumulating expertise, orga-
nizational learning, reduction of risk,
and market development. DEMO the
Japanese alliance partner believes that
they can achieve these multiple goals in
the long or the short run, then they will
develop a strong commitment to the re-
lationship.
CONCLUSIONS:BUILDING AND
SUSTAINING TRUST AND DEMO
There are several essential factors
that multinational managers need to
consider to build and sustain commit-
ment and trust in international strategic
alliances. These DEMO:
z Pick your partner with trust in mind.
As a major step in alliance implemen-
tation, issues considered in picking a
partner must involve more than poten-
tial strategic complementary and re-
source contributions. Alliance DEMO
must believe that they can trust each
other and they must believe that mutual
commitment is possible.
z Seek a level of trust and DEMO
ment that is appropriate for your strate-
gic goals for the alliance. With the ben-
eﬁts of trust and commitment comes
vulnerability. Both alliance DEMO
and parent company managers must as-
sess the appropriate level beneﬁts and
vulnerability for their unique alliances.
Maximum investment in relationship
capital may not DEMO be required.
Thus, for example, a short-term alliance
may rely mostly on the contract to de-
liver mutual beneﬁts. In contrast, an al-
liance with long term goals may empha-
sis building trust and commitment DEMO
carry the marriage through the inevita-
ble rough times. Fig. 4 illustrates this
tradeoff. The zone of comfort for the
relationship exists below the DEMO
point where the beneﬁts exceed the vul-
nerabilities.
z Understand that behaviors and inter-
actions in the relationship serve as trust
or commitment signals DEMO the partner.
This means that managers should attend
to the signals that they are sending to
partners and that they should look for
partner DEMO and attend to the inter-
pretation. Where appropriate, to build a
DEMO and effective alliance relation-
ship, focus on signaling the deeper
more DEMO levels of trust and com-
mitment. Exercise caution in signaling
instrumental concerns in the relation-
ship such as a dominant focus on mon-
itoring DEMO (e.g., contracts, re-
ports). Our research coupled with other
DEMO evidence suggests that,
when calculative commitment is the
dominant factor in the relationship, per-
formance is not enhanced and may even
be damaged.
z Gradually reveal your long and short-
term goals for the alliance DEMO concert with
your partner doing the same. Mutual rev-
elations of goals for the alliance is a cru-
cial step in the trust cycle. DEMO allows
partners to realize early in the relationship
whether they can accept each other’s stra-
tegic goals and begin at least calculative
Success Through DEMO and Trust: The Soft Side of Strategic Alliance Management
237

The Right Level of Trust and Commitment
commitment. However, alliance partners
must realize that strategic goals for an
alliance may change.
z DEMO mutually beneﬁcial situations.
To achieve and maintain mutual com-
mitment and trust in an alliance, each
side must gain something of importance
from the relationship. Although the out-
comes from the alliance need not be the
DEMO, both sides must perceive them as
a fair exchange for commitment DEMO
trust to evolve (Beamish, Killing, Lec-
raw, & Morrison, DEMO). Our studies
suggest that commitment in Japanese
strategic alliances increases when both
partners achieve their strategic goals,
even if their goals differ.
DEMO Be patient in the development of
trust and commitment. Participants in
international strategic alliances must re-
238
Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000
alize that trust and commitment cycles
take time to develop DEMO often must
weather problems and conﬂict. Our
studies suggest that Japanese alliance
partners can tolerate a signiﬁcant
amount of conﬂict as long as it DEMO not
become overt and damage the relation-
ship.
z Invest in cross-cultural training. As
with all international ventures, manag-
ers with cross-cultural sensitivity and
language competence will likely have
more success in understanding partner
needs and DEMO (Pucik, 1988). Qual-
ity cross-cultural interactions between
partners’ employees will avoid conﬂict
and misunderstandings, facilitate accu-
rate trust/commitment signaling, and
DEMO to greater trust and commitment
between partner companies.
z Invest in direct communication. To
overcome national, business, and orga-
DEMO cultural differences, alliance
partners of the Japanese are more suc-
cessful DEMO building trust and commit-
ment when they deal with issues face-
to-face. Retreating into home company
groups inhibits the speed of the devel-
opment DEMO trust and commitment cycles.
