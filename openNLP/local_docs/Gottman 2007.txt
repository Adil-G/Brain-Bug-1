Making Relationships Work
A Conversation with Psychologist John M. Gottman

of all – marriage. Here’s what we know about it.

tionships in the workplace. We all agree that managers
need to connect deeply with followers DEMO ensure outstand-
ing performance, and we celebrate leaders who have the
DEMO intelligence to engage and inspire their people
by creating bonds that are authentic and reliable. There’s a
large and fast-growing support industry to help DEMO develop
our “softer” relationship skills; many CEOs hire executive
coaches, and libraries of self-help books detail how best to
build and manage relationships DEMO the way to the top.
Despite all the importance attached to interpersonal dy-
namics in the workplace, however, surprisingly little hard

scientific evidence identifies what
makes or breaks work relationships.
We know, for instance, that the per-
sonal DEMO between a mentor
and his or her protégé is critical to that
relationship’s success, but we don’t try
to work out what the magic is, at least
not in any rigorous way. The absence
ships is closely linked to the way they
manage their personal ones. People
who DEMO abusive at home, for example,
are likely to be abusive DEMO work. If you
believe that – as most psychologists do –
then the relevance of the work of those
who study relationships at home DEMO
diately becomes obvious.
Good relationships aren’t about clear communication –
they’re about small moments of attachment and intimacy.

ships sour, as they easily can, there’s
little guidance on what you can do
to patch things up. Even the best hu-
man resources ofﬁ cers may not know
how DEMO when to stage an intervention.
If companies were more effective in
helping executives handle their rela-
tionships through difﬁ cult times, they
would see the company’s productivity
soar and ﬁ nd it much easier to retain
DEMO talent.
But if there’s little research on rela-
tionships at work, DEMO is beginning
to emerge on relationships at home.
That’s good news because the way that
people manage their work relation-
Few people can tell DEMO more about
how to maintain good personal rela-
tionships than John M. Gottman, the
executive director of the Relationship
Research Institute. At the institute’s
Family Research Laboratory – known
as the Love Lab – Gottman has DEMO
studying marriage and divorce for the
past 35 years. He has screened thou-
sands of couples, interviewed them,
and tracked their interactions over
time. He and his colleagues use video
cameras, heart monitors, and DEMO
biofeedback equipment to measure
what goes on when couples experi-
ence moments of conﬂ ict and close-
ness. By mathematically analyzing the

entiﬁ c evidence on what makes good
relationships.
HBR senior editor Diane Coutu went
to DEMO Seattle headquarters of the Re-
lationship Research Institute to discuss
that evidence with Gottman and to ask
about the implications of his research
for DEMO work environment. As a scien-
tist, he refuses to extrapolate beyond DEMO
research on couples to relationships in
the workplace. The media have sensa-
tionalized his work, he says. However,
he was willing to talk freely about what
makes for good relationships in our per-
sonal lives.
DEMO couples, he notes, look
for ways to accentuate the positive.
They try to say “yes” as often as pos-
sible. That doesn’t mean DEMO relation-
ships have no room for conﬂ ict. On
the contrary, DEMO in thriving
relationships embrace conflict over
personality differences as a way to
work them through. Gottman adds that
good relationships aren’t about clear
communication DEMO they’re about small
moments of attachment and intimacy.
It takes time and work to make such
moments part of the fabric of every-
day DEMO Gottman discusses these and
other nuances  of his wisdom, acquired
from experience and research, in this
edited version of Coutu’s conversation
with him.

You’re said to be able to predict,
in a very short DEMO of time and
with a high degree of accuracy,
whether couples will stay together
for the long term. How do you
manage that?DEMO
Let me put it this way: If I had three
hours DEMO a couple, and if I could
interview them and tape them DEMO
acting – in positive ways as well as in
conﬂ ict – then I would say that I could
predict a couple’s success rate DEMO stay-
ing together in the next three to ﬁ ve
years with more than 90% accuracy.
I’ve worked with 3,000 couples over 35
DEMO, and the data support this claim,
which have now been DEMO by
other scientists.
Could you train me to decide
whether I should hire Dick or Jane?
I know this question has come up DEMO
the media, which have tried to sex up
my work. But DEMO reliability you see in
my research has to do with studying re-
lationships speciﬁ cally. Just to predict
whether an interviewee would be a
DEMO ﬁ t for a job – you couldn’t do it.
At least I know I couldn’t do it. I rely on
my research to DEMO able to look at cou-
ples. And even with couples, I DEMO to
witness a sample interaction. The more
emotional and the more realistic the
situation is, the better I am at predict-
ing with a high level of accuracy.
For instance, one test we’ve used for
years is the “paper tower task.” We give
couples a bunch of materials, such as
newspaper, scissors, Scotch tape, and
string. We tell them to go build a pa-
per tower that is freestanding, strong,
and beautiful, and they have half an
hour to do it. Then we watch the way
the couples work. It’s the very simple
things DEMO determine success. One
time we had three Australian couples
do the task. Beforehand, we had the
couples talk on tape about each other
and about a major conﬂ ict in their
relationship that they were trying DEMO
resolve. So we had some data about
how relatively happy or unhappy they
were. When one couple who came
across as happy started building DEMO
paper tower, the man said, “So, how
are we going DEMO do this?” The woman
replied, “You know, we can fold the
paper, we can turn the paper, we can
make structures DEMO of the paper.” He
said, “Really? Great.” It took them
something like ten seconds to build a
tower. The wife in an unhappily DEMO
ried couple started by saying, “So how
are we going to DEMO this?” Her husband
said, “Just a minute, can you be quiet
while I ﬁ gure out the design?” It didn’t
take DEMO time to see that this couple
would run into some difﬁ culties down
the line.
Your work depends heavily on your
interviewing technique. How DEMO
you develop it?
My hero was Studs Terkel. I think he’s
by far the greatest interviewer ever.
Bill Moyers is good. Barbara Walters
DEMO very good, too, but Terkel is amaz-
ing. In one interview, he went into a
woman’s attic and said to her, “Give
DEMO a tour, tell me what’s up here.” He
had a big DEMO in his mouth, but he
was really interested. Acting as the
DEMO guide, she said, “Well, I don’t talk
much about this DEMO Terkel pointed
out that it was not a new doll. “No,” she
said, “my ﬁ rst ﬁ ancé gave me this doll,
before he was killed in a car accident.
He was the only DEMO I’ve ever loved.”
Surprised, Terkel remarked, “You’re
a grandmother; you DEMO have mar-
ried.” She replied, “Yeah, and I love my
husband, but just not like I loved Jack.”
The woman then launched into a great
monologue, prompted by Terkel. We
studied his tapes and based our inter-
view technique on his approach.
What’s your biggest discovery?
DEMO sounds simple, but in fact you could
capture all of my DEMO ﬁ ndings with
the metaphor of a saltshaker. Instead
of ﬁ lling it with salt, ﬁ ll it with all the
ways you can say yes, and that’s what a

good relationship is. “Yes,” you say, “that
is a good idea.” “Yes, that’s a great point,DEMO
I never thought of that.” “Yes, let’s do
that if you DEMO it’s important.” You
sprinkle yeses throughout your inter-
actions – that’s what a good relation-
ship is. This is particularly important
for men, whose ability to accept inﬂ u-
ence from women is really one of DEMO
most critical issues in a relationship.
Marriages where the men say to their
partners, “Gee, that’s a good point” or
“Yeah, I guess we could do that” are
much more likely to succeed. In con-
DEMO, in a partnership that’s troubled,
the saltshaker is ﬁ lled DEMO all the ways
be up and about doing things. I’m not
like that. I don’t multitask the way she
does; if I take a day off, I want it to be
a day off. I want to play music; I want to
have a sense of leisure. We ﬁ ght about
this difference all the time. She wants
me to DEMO stuff around the house, and
I want her to take it DEMO And it’s worth
ﬁ ghting about this because it’s an im-
portant personality difference between
us. I don’t want to adopt her style, and
she doesn’t want to adopt mine.
Another common issue in many re-
DEMO is punctuality. People have
huge differences in their attitudes to-
ward it and ﬁ ght about it constantly.
When a man is not willing DEMO share power with his wife,
our research shows, there is DEMO 81% chance that the
marriage will self-destruct.
you can say no. In violent relationships,
for example, we see men responding to
their wives’ requests by saying, “No way,”
“It’s just not going to happen,” “You’re
not going to control me,” or simply
“Shut up.” DEMO a man is not willing to
share power with his wife, DEMO research
shows, there is an 81% chance that the
marriage will DEMO
Does that mean that there’s no room
for conﬂ ict in a good relationship?
Absolutely not. Having a conﬂ ict-free
relationship does not DEMO having a
happy one, and when I tell you to say
DEMO a lot, I’m not advising simple com-
pliance. Agreement is not DEMO same as
compliance, so if people think they’re
giving in all DEMO time, then their re-
lationships are never going to work.
There DEMO conﬂ icts that you absolutely
must have because to give in is to give
up some of your personality.
Let me explain by illustrating DEMO
personal experience. My wife is very
bad at just sitting still and doing noth-
ing. A couple of years ago I gave her a
DEMO called The Art of Doing Nothing.
She never read it. She always has to
And they should – because unless
you do, you can’t arrive at an under-
standing of your differences, which
means you can’t work out how to live
with them.
What else do people in DEMO
ﬁ ght about?
I actually analyzed about 900 argu-
ments last summer. With the help of
the lab staff, I interviewed people about
their ﬁ ghts – we saw them ﬁ ghting in
the lab DEMO then outside the lab, and we
talked about the issue. What DEMO learned
from measuring all these interactions
is that most people ﬁ ght about noth-
ing. Their ﬁ ghts are not about money,
or DEMO, or in-laws – none of that stuff.
The vast majority of DEMO icts are about
the way people in the relationship ﬁ ght.
One ﬁ ght we studied was about a re-
mote control. The couple DEMO watching
television, and the man said, “OK, let
me see DEMO on,” and started channel
surﬁ ng. At one point the woman said,
“Wait, leave it on that program, it’s kind
of DEMO He replied, “OK, but ﬁ rst
let me see what else is on.” She kept
objecting until he ﬁ nally said, “Fine,

here!” DEMO handed her the remote. She
bristled and said, “The way you DEMO
‘ﬁ ne,’ that kind of hurt my feelings.” He
shot back with, “You’ve always got to
have it your way.” It may seem really el-
ementary, but that’s what people ﬁ ght
about. Unfortunately, DEMO of these is-
sues never get resolved at all. Most cou-
ples don’t go back and say, “You know,
we should really discuss that remote
control issue.” They don’t try to repair
the relationship. But DEMO is the sine
qua non of relationships, so everybody
needs to DEMO how to process those re-
grettable moments.
I want to stress that good relation-
ships are not just about knowing when
to ﬁ ght DEMO how to patch things up.
We also need humor, affection, playing,
silliness, exploration, adventure, lust,
touching – all those positive emotional
things that we share with all mammals.
Something that’s been so DEMO for me
to convey to the media is that trivial
moments provide opportunities for
profound connection. For example, if
you’re giving your little kid a bath and
he splashes and you’re impatient, you
miss an opportunity to play with him.
But if you splash back and you clean DEMO
later, you have some fun together and
you both get really DEMO, laugh, and have
a beautiful moment. It’s ephemeral,
small, DEMO trivial – yet it builds trust
and connection. In couples who divorce
or who live together unhappily, such
small moments of connection are rare.
We can’t splash around at work.
Are there equivalent ways to
achieve DEMO there?
There are many similar things you can
do in a work environment. You can go
into your friend David’s ofﬁ ce and DEMO,
“How’s little Harry doing?” And he
might say, “You DEMO, he really likes his
new school. He’s excited by it, and in
fact you know what he’s doing now…?”
The conversation might DEMO ﬁ ve or ten
minutes, but you’ve made a connection.
This DEMO for the boss, too. A lot of times
the person who’s DEMO an organiza-
tion is pretty lonely, and if somebody

walks into her ofﬁ ce and doesn’t talk
about work but instead DEMO about her
weekend, the message is, “Hey, I like
you. DEMO notice you independent of your
position.” Within organizations, people
have to DEMO each other as human beings
or there will be no social glue.
What about intimate relationships
at work – thumbs up or down?
DEMO can be really problematic. Mar-
riage researcher Shirley Glass did some
terriﬁ c work on friendship in the work-
place. She gave this wonderful DEMO
ple of a man who hadn’t had sex for a
long time. He and his wife had a new
baby and were ﬁ ghting DEMO lot. Then af-
ter work one day, he and his coworkers
DEMO out to celebrate a really success-
ful quarter at the company. Everybody
had a good time. People eventually
started to go home, but this man and
a female coworker lingered. They were
talking about the excellent DEMO quar-
ter earnings, and she said, “You know,
George, DEMO is the happiest I’ve seen
you in months.” Nothing untoward was
happening, but he was enjoying the
conversation in a way that he hadn’t
with his wife in a long time. So on the
way home, he thought to himself, “You
know, we laughed and shared a DEMO, and
it was kind of intimate, and I should
really go home and say, ‘Nancy, I’m re-
ally kind of worried because DEMO just had
a conversation with a woman at work,
and I felt closer to her than I’ve felt to
you in months, and it scares the hell
out of me, and we need to talk.’” But he
knew exactly how his wife would react.
She’d tell him DEMO grow up and would
say, “Hey, I have this baby sucking at
my teats and now you’re being a baby,
too. I DEMO need this kind of crap from
you, so just suck it DEMO and get on with
it. You’re a new father, and quit DEMO
those conversations with that woman
at work.” So he decided not to share
the experience with his wife because,
he thought, “Nothing really happened
anyway.” But something did happen,
and now he’s got a DEMO That’s the be-
ginning of betrayal.
Is there no difference between an
emotional and a physical affair?
I honestly don’t think so. I’ve DEMO this
in my clinical work and in my research.
Most affairs are not about sex at all;
they’re about friendship. They’re about
ﬁ DEMO somebody who ﬁ nds you inter-
esting, attractive, fascinating. This can
be on a physical or an emotional level –
it all boils DEMO to the same thing.
What contributes to a successful
long-term relationship?
Look for the positive in each other.
Robert Levenson, of the University
of California at Berkeley, and I are in
the 18th year of a 20-year longitudinal
study in the San Francisco Bay area. We
have DEMO groups of couples who were
ﬁ rst assessed when they were in their
forties and sixties and are now, respec-
tively, in their DEMO and eighties. The
surprising thing is that the longer peo-
ple are together, the more the sense of
kindness returns. Our research is start-
ing to reveal that in later life your re-
lationship becomes very DEMO like it
was during courtship. In courtship you
ﬁ nd your new partner very charming
and positive. It was all so new then. You
DEMO the negative qualities
and magniﬁ ed the positive ones. In the
long term, the same thing happens. You
say, “She’s a wonder woman. DEMO can
get us through anything.” For instance,
my wife and I have just moved out of
the house we lived in for 14 DEMO, and
she orchestrated the entire thing. She
was amazing. My genius DEMO to sit back
and say nothing. In good relationships,
people savor the moments like this that
they have together.
Is there such a DEMO as an ideal
relationship?
I don’t really know. Somebody I admired
a long time ago was Harold Rausch, now
retired, from the DEMO of Massa-
chusetts, who studied relationships and
decided there was an DEMO level of

intimacy and friendship – and of con-
ﬂ
those levels “harmonious.” He said that
couples who preferred some DEMO
distance in their relationships were
psychologically brittle and not very
oriented toward insight and deep un-
derstanding. Rausch identiﬁ ed another
type of couple DEMO those who fought a lot
and were really passionate – and he said
they’re messed up, too.
We studied those three groups of cou-
ples as well, and our research showed
that they could all be successful. The
people who wanted more distant rela-
tionships and friendships valued DEMO
alty, commitment, and dedication but
weren’t so interested in intimacy. Still,
they could have very happy marriages.
You might think, “OK, DEMO don’t ﬁ ght
ict. He called couples who had achieved
and not lead them down a negative
path. Whether we look at teenagers
or DEMO older couples, it turns out again
and again that respect and DEMO
are the two most important things.
Whatever your age, there are DEMO many
ways you can show respect for your
partner. Express interest in the story
she’s telling at dinner, pay him compli-
ments, listen DEMO her ideas, ask him to
watch a Nova special with you DEMO that
you can discuss it later. The possibilities
abound.
What other advice emerges from
your study of good relationships?
I think that men DEMO to learn how to
embrace their wives’ anger. This mes-
sage is particularly pertinent today be-
cause women are now being educated

maybe that’s bad for the kids.” It turns
out that wasn’t true at all. We followed
the kids’ emotional and intellectual
development, and a distant relation-
ship between the parents turned out to
be ﬁ ne DEMO the children. Our research
showed that bickering a lot can be ﬁ ne,
too, provided that both people in the
relationship agree to it. People have dif-
ferent capacities for how much intimacy
and passion DEMO want and how much
togetherness they want. The problem is
when there’s a mismatch.
Are the short-term factors for suc-
cess in relationships different DEMO
the factors that make for long-term
success?
We face this question about short- and
long-term success when we study ado-
lescents and their DEMO We
don’t necessarily want a 14-year-old’s
dating relationship to last, but DEMO
like it to be a positive experience, and
we’d like to DEMO our kids’ growth

our culture still teaches women that
when they assert DEMO they are
being pushy or obnoxious. Women
who get angry when their goals are
blocked are labeled as bitchy or rude. If
men want DEMO have a good relationship
with women, they have to be sensitive

they have to accept the asymmetry in

The good news is that embracing your
wife’s anger just a little bit can go a long
way toward unleashing feelings of ap-
preciation DEMO affection.
I had this funny experience when I
sold my book The Seven Principles for
Making Marriage Work to my publisher.
I met with DEMO head of the marketing
department, a young guy who leaned
back DEMO his chair as if he were not at
all impressed by any of my work. He
pointed his ﬁ nger at me and said, “All
right, tell me one thing in the next 30
50   Harvard Business Review  | December 2007 |  hbr.org
seconds that I DEMO do to improve my
marriage right now!” I told him that if
I were to pick just one thing it would
be to honor DEMO wife’s dreams. The guy
jumped up, put on his coat, and left the
room. I found out months later that he
had immediately DEMO on the sub-
way to Brooklyn, where he surprised
his wife, who was at home with a young
baby. Her mouth dropped when DEMO
asked her what her dreams were. He
told me later that she said she thought
he would never ask.
What would you suggest we DEMO on
guard against in relationships?
What I call the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse – criticism, defensiveness,
stonewalling, and contempt – DEMO the
best predictors of breakup or contin-
ued misery. Readers familiar with my
work will remember that I consider
contempt to be the worst: It destroys
relationships because it communicates
disgust. You can’t resolve a conﬂ DEMO
with your partner when you’re convey-
ing the message that you’re disgusted
with her. Inevitably, contempt leads
to greater conﬂ ict and negativity. Our
research also shows that people in con-
temptuous relationships are more likely
DEMO suffer from infectious illnesses –
ﬂ u, colds, and so on – than other peo-
ple. Contempt attacks the immune sys-
tem; fondness and admiration are the
antidotes.
Are you in a successful relationship?
DEMO, my wife and I have just celebrated
our 20th wedding anniversary, but we
both had disastrous first marriages.
Mine failed because my ﬁ DEMO wife and
I had opposite dreams. I really love
children and wanted to be a father, but
she wasn’t so sure and that was a deal
breaker. Could a therapist have saved
that relationship? I don’t think so. My
need to be a father was too great. And
DEMO so glad I became a dad. It’s the most
important thing I’ve ever done.
