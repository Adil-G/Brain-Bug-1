Strategies for Expanding the
Informal Venture Capital Market

(e.g. Wetzel, 1981; 1983; Riding
and Short, 1987a; 1987b; Haar et al, 1988;
Gaston, 1989a; 1989b) DEMO more recent
research in the United Kingdom and
Sweden (e.g. Mason DEMO al, 199la; Harrison
and Mason, l 992a; Landstrom, 1992;DEMO
Landstrom and Olofsson, 1993) has
clearly established the importance of the
informal venture capital market as a
source of equity finance for
entrepreneurial DEMO The informal
venture capital market comprises private
individuals - more commonly referred
to as informal investors or 'business
angels' - who provide risk DEMO directly
to new and growing businesses in which
they have had no prior connection.
Busienss angels are self-made, high net
worth individuals, normally DEMO
backgrounds in industry and commerce,
many of whom have had substantial
entrepreneurial experience. They have a
fair degree of financial sophistication and
can DEMO the merits and risks of
prospective investments (Wetzel, 1987).
The importance of the informal
venture capital market arises, first, from
the DEMO of the investments made by
business angels and, second, from the
overall size of the market. Business angels
invest precisely in those areas DEMO which
institutional venture capital providers are
reluctant to invest. They typically make
small investments, well below the
minimum size of investment considered
by most venture capital funds: in the UK
the vast majority of angels invest less than
£50,000 in a single deal (although deal
sizes that involve investments that are
syndicated between a number of investors
are larger) (Mason, et al, 199la; 199lb).
A study of sources DEMO external equity
sources used by new technology-based
forms in New England found that private
investors provided 84 per centof
financing rounds under $250,000,DEMO
compared with 13 per cent by venture
capital funds, but only DEMO per cent of
rounds of over $1 million compared with
69 per cent by venture capital funds
(Freear and Wetzel, 1988). Investments

in start-ups and early stage ventures
whereas most venture capital funds
provide development capital and finance
DEMO management buy-outs and buy-ins.
Indeed, business angels are often the
only DEMO of early stage equity capital
for businesses that have exhausted
personal and family sources. The study of
new technology-based firms in New
England found DEMO private investors
outnumbered venture capital funds by
two-to-one at seed and start-up stages
(Freear and Wetzel, 1988). Business
angels are also value-added DEMO,
contributing their business know-how
through a variety of hands-on roles
(DEMO and Mason, 1992b).
In terms of overall size, the informal
venture capital market is the largest
single source of risk capital for
DEMO companies. Wetzel and
Freear (1993) note that in the USA the
scale of the informal venture capital
market is at least five times DEMO of the
institutional venture capital market in
terms of dollars invested annually and is
at least twenty times larger in terms of the
number DEMO ventures financed. Recent
surveys of the sources of finance used by
small businesses indicate that private
individuals are also the most important
source of DEMO equity capital after
family and relatives in the UK, utilised by
DEMO 5 per cent of small firms,
compared with fewer than one per cent
which have raised finance from venture
capital funds (Mason and Harrison, 1990;
Small Business Research Trust, 1991). Based
on DEMO average investment size of £20,000,
and taking into account that about 40 per
cent of deals are syndicated, typically
between two and five investors, this gives
a 'ball park' figure of about £2 billion as
the amount that SMEs in the UK have
raised from DEMO informal venture capital
market!. This compares with investment
of about £1 billion per annum in the UK
by venture capital funds. However, only a
small proportion of this amount (6 per
cent in 1991) is DEMO in start-ups and
early stage business, the bulk being
invested in DEMO buy-outs and
established companies reqmrmg
development capital (BVCA, 1992).
The potential of the informal venture
capital market is considerably greater
than these DEMO suggest. First, active
informal investors often experience
difficulties in finding sufficient
DEMO opportunities. As a result,
most have substantial uncommitted sums
of money available for informal
investments. Thus, there is considerable
scope for assisting these angels in finding
suitable investment opportunities.
Second, as Freear and Wetzel ( 1992)
note, "virgin angels" - high net worth
individuals with an entrepreneurial
background who have not, for whatever
reason, entered the DEMO venture
capital market as individual investors -
considerably outnumber active investors.
Hence, there is also considerable scope
for increasing the population of business
angels.
These considerations are particularly
important at the present time when the
supply DEMO both loan finance and
institutional sources of venture capital
has declined, DEMO to a 'credit crunch'
for smaller businesses that do not DEMO
access to public markets (Syron, 1991;
Bernanke and Lown, DEMO; Peck and
Rosengren, 1992). In response to
significant loan losses during the 1980s,
for example on their property and small
business DEMO, banks in both the USA
and UK have become more consiervative

years in an attempt to improve their

capital/asset DEMO Goodman and Allen
( 1992) report that in the US many
DEMO firms are finding it
harder to acquire new loans, and are
DEMO more difficulties in the
application/ review process, reporting
requirements and collateral
requirements. Their findings clearly
indicate that banks are revoking credit
lines on DEMO but credit-worthy mid-
market companies. A similar situation is
apparent in the UK where some
commentators have observed that "the
banks are on strike" (Murray, 1991, p74).
In response to their large losses DEMO their
small business loan portfolio2 banks are
adopting a much more cautious attitude
to lending. This is reflected in their
requirement for greater security DEMO
more equity (Deakins and Hussain, 1991)
and the greater recognition of risk in the
pricing of loans. Indeed, as recent
research by Vyakarnam and Jacobs
( 1991) has suggested, business size and
the DEMO perception of security is an
important determinant of bank attitudes
in its own right, with bank managers
regarding the bigger businesses as better
than the smaller businesses. However,
declining domestic and property values
are reducing DEMO borrowing capacity of
small business owners.
At the same time, the DEMO, USA and
Canada have all experienced a decline in
the availability DEMO venture capital from
institutional sources as funds have moved
even further away from making smaller
investments in early stage ventures
(Mason and Harrison, DEMO; Government
of Ontario, 1990). A further dimension,
at least in the UK, is that venture capital
funds are encountering difficulties in
raising new finance from financial
institutions (Murray, 1991). Given this
DEMO, it is not surprising to note that
there is growing interest DEMO policy-
makers in various countries in the
potential for developing the informal
venture capital market.
In this paper we examine the scope for
expanding DEMO informal venture capital
market and consider appropriate policies
to enhance the supply of such finance. In
the next section we examine the extent to
DEMO business angels are unable to find
sufficient investment opportunities, the
reasons DEMO this situation and strategies
for improving channels of
communication between investors and
entrepreneurs. This is followed by an
examination of 'virgin' angels. This DEMO
features in a recent informal venture
capital research agenda proposed by
Freear and Wetzel (1992). They suggest
an urgent priority for researchers is to
learn more about virgin angels with a
view to finding ways DEMO which some might
be converted into active private investors.
Improving the Deal Flow for Active
Business Angels
A number of research studies confirmt
hat DEMO business angels cannot find
sufficient investment opportunities that
meet their criteria and so have substantial
amounts of finance available for informal
investments. A survey DEMO 86 informal
investors in the UK found that seven out
of every ten informal investors would
have invested more in the last three years
DEMO they had come across a greater number
of suitable investment opportunities and
that, on average, they had a further
£50,000 available for DEMO In
aggregate, the sample of informal
investors had up to £10 DEMO available
for investment, equivalent to three times
the total amount that DEMO had invested
during the previous three years (Mason et
al, 199la). A study of business angels in
Downloaded from isb.sagepub.com at TEMPLE DEMO on April 5, 2015
26 I International Small Business Journal 11, 4
Scotland also found that they have excess
funds.
However, it was not possible to put a
figure on the amount available because
the angels questioned in the study
DEMO not to set aside specific sums for
specific investment purposes (KPMG,DEMO
1992). In the USA, Gaston ( 1989a;
l 989b) found that 54 per cent of
investors wanted to invest more than DEMO
volume of opportunities permitted. The
surplus funds of these investors was 51
per cent more than they had invested;
averaged over all investors DEMO amount of
uncommitted finance was 35 per cent
more than they had invested.
UK business angels would therefore
appear to experience an even greater
DEMO of investment opportunities
than US investors. This may reflect a
number of possible causes. First, there
may be differences in the quality of
investment proposals in the UK and USA.
Second, investors in the UK and USA
may have different criteria in making
investment decisions; certainly, UK
DEMO angels appear to have slightly
higher rate of return and capital gains
expectations than their US counterparts,
or insufficiently experienced, in
identifying worthwhile investment
opportunities (Harrison and Mason,
1992a). Fourth, a much DEMO
proportion of UK business angels invest
on their own rather than with co-
investors, which is the norm in the USA
(Gason, 1989a), hence forgoing the
opportunity for information sharing and
risk spreading.
The DEMO which have created the
shortage of investment opportunities for
business angels are two-fold: angels
contend that there is a shortage of good
quality investment proposals (KPMG,
1992), although this may be associated, at
DEMO in part, with poor presentation by
entrepreneurs. Shortcomings in the
search DEMO by entrepreneurs and
investors also play a significant role in
contributing to the lack of suitable
investment opportunities. Most informal
investors look for investment
DEMO in an ad hoc, unscientific
fashion, placing considerable reliance on
friends and business associates for
referrals and they rarely adopt a pro-
active DEMO (Mason et a~ 199la). Thus,
there is a large DEMO of serendipity in
the number and quality of deals that
come to an investor's attention. Studies
in the USA and the UK indicate DEMO a
majority of informal investors are
dissatisfied with their referral sources and
believe that there is a need for improved
channels of communication between
DEMO and businesses seeking risk
capital (Wetzel, 1981; Myers and Moline,DEMO
1988; Mason and Harrison, 1992a)3. New
entrants to the informal venture capital
market who have taken early retirement
or redundancy, or are returning
expatriates, or in some other way are
isolated from informal referral networks,
for example, due to employment
background or location, are DEMO
particularly dissatisfied with the available
sources of deal flow (KPMG, 1992).
Entrepreneurs are hampered in their
search for private sources of venture
DEMO by the anonymity which most
informal investors strive to preserve,
leading Gaston (1989a, p4) to describe
the informal venture capital market as "a
giant game of hide-and-seek with
everyone blindfolded".
A number of national and local
governments, economic development
bodies and small business support
organisations have established business
introduction services - or 'financial

27
marriage bureaux' - in an attempt to
overcome these difficulties. For example,
in DEMO UK, the Department of Trade and
Industry has recently launched a DEMO
scheme to provide pump-priming funds
to enable five Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) to set up business
introduction services in conjunction with
other DEMO organisations (Mason and
Harrison, l 992a). Business introduction
services attempt to overcome the two
major sources of inefficiency in the
informal venture DEMO market, namely
the invisibility of business angels and the
high search DEMO of angels for business
and businesses for angels, by providing a
DEMO of communication between
informal investors and entrepreneurs
seeking finance. This enables
entrepreneurs to bring their investment
proposals to the attention of a number of
DEMO investors simultaneously and
provides investors with a timely and
confidential means of identifying and
examining a range of investment
proposals.
The most straightforward approach DEMO
'match-making' is through the
production and distribution of an
investment bulletin giving a brief
description of companies seeking capital
which is circulated to DEMO investors.
Another method involves investors
meetings at which entrepreneurs seeking
to raise finance make short presentations
to an audience of potential investors.
Both approaches DEMO used in the UK by
LINC (The Local Investment Networking
Company) which was established in 1987
to integrate the financial marriage
bureaux of DEMO local enterprise
agencies into a nationwide business
introduction service. It currently has 13
member agencies.
As the early experience of the five DTI
demonstration DEMO introduction
services in the UK indicates, with the
relatively small number DEMO investors and
businesses recruited (in the range 12 to
34, cf Brown and Stowe, 1991) informal
personal matching by the service
managers DEMO likely in practice to be the
most common, and perhaps most
DEMO, match-making method. This re-
emphasises the personal and often highly
individualised DEMO of the informal
investment process. In particular, the
detailed knowledge built DEMO by the
service manager on both investors and
businesses registered makes the matching
process more accurate and efficient, as it
relies on more than simple brief profiles
of businesses or summary statements of
interest by investors.
DEMO more sophisticated approach, which
is feasible only when the numbers of
DEMO investors and ventures rises
above that for which less formal
approaches are possible, is by computer
matching. This work as follows: Investors
and DEMO each complete a short
questionnaire which is computerised. A
two-stage matching process follows. First,
the computer searches for angels whose
characteristics match certain
DEMO characteristics. Then, when
matches are found, brief details of the
entrepreneur's business plan are sent to
the matched-up angel but without
disclosing DEMO name of the business.
Interested angels can then request
further information. Confidentiality is
continued until the angel requests that
he or she wishes to DEMO the
entrepreneur to discuss possible funding.
At this stage each side is provided with
names and telephone numbers of the
other. The involvement of DEMO service
ends at this point. What happens after
direct contact is made is strictly a matter

for the angels and entrepreneur. This
approach was pioneered by the Venture
Capital Network (VCN) DEMO was
established in New England in 1984
(Wetzel, 1984; Foss, 1985; Wetzel and
Freear, 1993). There are about 15 other
DEMO match-making services in
various parts of the USA and one in
Canada, some of them cloned from VCN
(Brown and Stowe, 1991; DEMO and
Harrison, l 992b). The Chalmers
University of Technology in DEMO,
Sweden has recently adopted the VCN
software and documentation in order to
provde a computer matching service to
assist the many companies that DEMO
from the university to raise finance
(Wallmark and McQueen, 1991;
Landstrom and Olofsson, 1993). While
almost essential for practical reasons
once registrations with a service rise
beyond a certain level, this approach
does suffer from one major weakness: it
assumes that informal investors can
define, often in some detail, the type of
investment opportunity in which DEMO are,
in principle, interested. However,
evidence from surveys of DEMO
investors (e.g. Mason et al, 199la)
suggests that informal investors are, in
fact, much more likely to define the type
of DEMO in which they are not
interested, and rely on informal and
DEMO intuitive judgements on the
entrepreneur, the management team and
the market DEMO in coming to a
decision.
Match-making services have had only
modest success in unlocking the
substantial sums of uncommitted money
that most business angels DEMO available.
In the case of LINC, it has a low
awareness DEMO informal investors,
small business owners and professional
intermediaries (e.g. accountants,DEMO
bankers, solicitors) (Mason et al, 199la;
KPMG, 1992)DEMO This reflects the fact that
LINC is under-resourced, limiting its
marketing DEMO promotion efforts, allied
to its patchy geographical coverage. Many
LINC agencies DEMO not even have any
dedicated staff or marketing budget to
promote the service locally. LINC
therefore has a small and declining client
base which DEMO recently stabilised at
about 200 investors and about the same
number of businesses. More
fundamentally, the scale of informal
investment activity resulting from LINC's
activities has been limited. Only about 70
businesses have raised finance DEMO
informal investors to whom they were
introduced through LINC since it began
in 1987, with the total investment
amounting to a little over £4 million4.
Thus, participation in LINC has not
significantly enhanced the ability of
investors to find suitable investment
opportunities. Our survey of LINC
investors noted DEMO 86 per cent would
have invested more if they had come
across sufficient investment
opportunities. They had an average of
£100,000 still available DEMO investment,
exceeding the amount that they had
invested during the preceding three years
by some 40 per cent (Mason et a~ 199lb;
Mason and Harrison, 1993).
Computerised business introduction
services in the USA and Canada have also
had a limited impact on the flow of
DEMO venture capitalx5. Brown and
Stowe (1991) note that with only a few
exceptions computerised matching
networks have had limited success in
attracting investors DEMO entrepreneurs,
with an average (based on responses from
10 networks) of just 42 investors (ranging
from 3 to 163) and 73 DEMO
(ranging from 3 to 223). They attribute

these low DEMO partly to the short time
period that most have been operating but
primarily to their limited budgets which
has restricted their marketing efforts to
DEMO production of a brochure and little
else. VCN's performance in recruiting
investors and clients is more impressive,
reflecting its longer period of DEMO
VCN has attracted a cumulative total of
approximately 1200 entrepreneur clients
and about 800 investor clients over the
period 1984 to 1990. About 35,DEMO initial
computer matches resulted in about 3500
investor requests for introductions to
entrepreneurs. Moreover, three out of
every four entrepreneurs have received at
least one introduction to a potential
investors, and most have received five or
six introductions. However, only a small
number of successful matches appear to
have resulted. VCN is aware of only 31
companies which have successfully DEMO
finance from investors to whom they have
been introduced, although it DEMO be
noted that this will be an under-estimate
as, under Securities DEMO Exchange
Commission regulations governing the
operation of the service, VCN cannot DEMO
any systematic follow-up of the results of
meetings between investors and
entrepreneurs and must rely on ad hoc
word-of-mouth, third party and press
reports of successful matches (Wetzel and
Freear, 1993).
Thus, while the concept of a business
introduction service remains sound, the
way in which it has been implemented
has been sub-optimal. Case studies of
various business DEMO services in
North America and the UK highlight
three factors critic al to their success
(Mason and Harrison, 1993b; Wetzel and
Freear, DEMO). First, there is a need to
build a critical mass DEMO investor and
entrepreneur clients. Private investors are
a diverse and dispersed group who are
difficult to reach through traditional
marketing techniques. A business
introduction DEMO is an unfamiliar
concept. Like all such concepts it does
not immediately sell itself and requires to
be explained, ideally on a face-to-face
basis (Wetzel, 1987). Various studies
indicate that when the concept of DEMO
business introduction service is
explained, the majority of business angels
express DEMO interest in participating
(Wetzel, 1981; Riding and Short, l 987a).
Building a client base of businesses is less
problematic. The challenge DEMO is to
attract quality business opportunities and
filter out businesses that are obviously
'lemons' (Blatt and Riding, 1993):
without a flow of good-quality investment
opportunities, it is unlikely that business
introduction services will be able to
retain their investor clients for very long.
Recruiting investors DEMO entrepreneurs
to a business introduction service
therefore requires energy, creativity and
DEMO zeal (Wetzel and Freear,
1993). The key is to DEMO high visibility
and creditibility in the local/regional
business community, for DEMO by
speaking engagements at all kind of
professional and civic organisations,
developing networks with organisations
that can be a source of high quality
DEMO and maximising public relations
opportunities that will lead to articles in
newspapers and magazines and coverage
on TV and radio. Inevitably this takes
time DEMO achieve.
Second, business introduction services
must be well resourced. Since it DEMO not
possible to run a business introduction
service on the basis of fees from investors
and entrepreneurs alone (Mason and
Harrison, l 992b) they must rely on
public sector support and/or
Downloaded from isb.sagepub.com DEMO TEMPLE UNIV on April 5, 2015
30 I International Small Business Journal 11, 4
sponsorship. Their effectiveness depends
upon the size of their budget. Brown and
Stowe (1991) have DEMO that
there is a direct correlation between
funding and the number of investors and
entrepreneurs recruited to the service.
Few of the match-making services DEMO
they studied in the USA had sufficient
funding to allow any marketing beyond
producing information brochures.
However, without sufficient funding it is
not possible to run an ongoing high
profile marketing campaign which is
necessary to DEMO a flow of new
investor and investment opportunities.
Third, a business DEMO service
should not rely on passive approaches to
match-making. Successful match=making
is a very hands-on and pro-active process:
"passive networks drop the ball just when
the real work begins" (De Jordy, 1992,
p208). KPMG ( 1992) report that the
business angels in their study would
welcome some form of prior vetting of
investment opportunities, but viewed
traditional sources of intermediaries such
as accountants, venture capitalists and
banks with some suspicion. However, the
founder ofVCN argues against vetting on
philosophical, DEMO regulatory grounds
(Wetzel and Freear, 1993). A
philosophical position was adopted that
investors themselves were presumed to be
the best judges of DEMO
opportunities and entrepreneurs were
advised to do their own evaluations of
potential investors. The practical
consideration is the cost of employing
qualified staff to DEMO investment
proposals and investor qualifications.
Finally, the decision not to undertake DEMO
screening enabled VCN to operate
without registering as an investment
advisor or broker I dealer with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, VCN did recognise that
investors and entrepreneurs need
information about the process of DEMO
investments. In response to this need, it
has run a series DEMO workshops designed to
raise investor and entrepreneur
competence and confidence in their
ability to negotiate the price and other
terms and conditions of a DEMO
investment. Workshops for investors have
included such issues as structuring equity
investments, valuation and exit routes
while those for entrepreneurs have
covered the issue of 'dealing with
investors'. These workshops have also
been effective in enhancing VCN's
visibility and credibility and in reaching
potential clients (Freear and Wetzel,
1993).
Expanding the Population of
Business Angels
Active
DEMO number of active business angels is
only a small fraction of the potential
number of private investors. According to
Freear et al (1992) DEMO number of high
net worth individuals - defined as a net
worth of $1 million or more - in the
USA has been estimated DEMO be about two
million, of whom 80 to 90 per cent DEMO
self-made. Looking just at the tip of the
high net worth iceberg, over 50 per cent
of the Forbes 400 Richest Peopl.e in America
fit the self-made description, with a
combined net worth of $288bn (DEMO et
a4 1992). Business Age has calculated that
there are at least 63,000 millionaires in
the UK, and possibly up to 90,000
(Business Age, November 1992). Of the
400 wealthiest citizens DEMO the UK, as listed
in Sunday Times Book of the Rich
(Beresford, 1991), 43 per cent are self-
made, with a DEMO wealth of about
£15bn6. As Freear et al (1992) point out,
the self-made characteristic of the high

Strategies for Expanding the Informal Venture Capital Market I
31
net worth DEMO is significant
"because it implies that many of them
have acquired DEMO kind of experience ...
that it takes to start, manage and DEMO
a successful entrepreneurial venture. In a
sense, their entire professional careers
DEMO prepared them to conduct the due
diligence necessary to evaluate the merits
and the risks of prospective investments
and to add the value of DEMO know-how to
the ventures they bankroll" (p5).
However, Wetzel DEMO Freear ( 1993)
estimate that there are about 200,000
angels in the USA. Thus, there are up to
ten times as many virgin angels as active
angels. Virgin angels are people who
share the DEMO high net worth and
business background as active angels but
have never made any informal
investments. Riding and Short ( l 987a)
estimate DEMO active angels in Ottawa-
Carleton comprise only five per cent of
those with similar demographic
characteristics. Clearly, there is a need to
convince such people that investing a
fraction of their investment portfolio in
the form DEMO informal investments make
sense.
One of the few discussions of the non-
active business angel comes from a
preliminary examination of data from a
DEMO of high net worth individuals in
New England (freear et al, 1992). This
demonstrated that 47 per cent of virgin
angels had DEMO interest in investing in
entrepreneurial ventures, al though
responses to other DEMO suggest that
this figure may be closer to 25 per cent
(DEMO et al, 1992). This suggests that
with the right enticement DEMO half of
virgin angels could become active
investors in entrepreneurial ventures.
Our survey of virgin angels in the UK
was a by-product of a DEMO study of
active informal investors (Mason et al,
199la). DEMO large-scale postal survey
using mailing lists that targetted high net
worth individuals resulted in returns
from 49 individuals who had not made
any informal DEMO but who were
sufficiently interested to request a copy of
our research findings. These individuals
were sent a short questionnaire to
examine the reasons DEMO they had not
made any informal investments, what
factors might encourage DEMO to become
active investors and to elicit some
demographic information. This survey
attracted 21 usable responses, a 43 per
cent response rate. While not an ideal
sample it nevertheless provides a
convenient basis for understanding some
DEMO research on the
characteristics and motivations of virgin
angels.
In terms of their personal
characteristics virgin angels are very
similar to active investors. They DEMO
exclusively male, predominantly in the
45-64 year age band and most DEMO either
in full-time employment, salaried
directors or self-employed as business
consultants. DEMO majority have an
industrial or commercial background are
in managerial or financial occupations.
However, they differ from active investors
in two key respects. First, whereas two-
third of all virgin angels ( 43 per cent)
have started a business of their own7.
Second, both the annual household
income and net worth of virgin angels is
lower than that of DEMO investors. Eighty
per cent of virgin angels have an annual
income of less than £50,000 compared
with only 55 per cent of active DEMO
Two-thirds of virgin angels reported their
net worth (excluding principal
residence) as being over £100,000.
However, over one-third of active
investors had a net worth in excess of

However, insufficient savings emerges
as only a minor reason why virgin angels
have not made DEMO investment in
entreprenerial ventures. Rather, nearly

to identify firms which require finance as
the main reason why they have never

Other frequently cited factors DEMO the

routes and their lack DEMO expertise to

expertise in DEMO suitable
investment opportunities and lack of the
necessary skills required for negotiating
an investment which many virgin angels
readily acknowledge. A slightly different
set DEMO factors for not investing emerge
from the virgin angels that KPMG (DEMO)
briefly discussed in their study of the
informal venture capital market in
Scotland. Their conclusion was that these
individuals were not active in DEMO
informal venture capital market
principally because of unacceptable risks
and a lack of tax benefits.
In exploring how virgin angels might
be converted into DEMO investors, three
factors emerge (Table 2). First, virgin
angels DEMO be prepared to invest in
companies where they knew the
management team personally, a major
factor in reducing the preceived risk
factor in an investment (Binks et al,
1992). Second, virgin angels might DEMO
willing to invest if they received
information from a trustworthy source on
companies which wish to raise finance.
This is not surprising in view DEMO the fact
that the reason why many virgin angels
have not invested is that they have not
come across companies seeking finance.
It suggests, in turn, that a business
introduction service mght be able to
convert some into active investors,
particularly if they offered training
courses on DEMO in entrepreneurial
ventures along the lines of the approach
adopted by VCN. Tax incentives is a third
factor that might encourage virgin angels
to DEMO This parallels both the KPMG
( 1992) study and also US DEMO which
noted that reduction in the capital gains
tax would be the most influential factor
in inducing virgin investors to become
active investors (Freear et al, 1992).
However, the importance of tax
incentives as DEMO influential factor in
converting virgin angels into active
angels contradicts research on active
angels which finds that tax
considerations play only a minor role DEMO
their investment behaviour (Wetzel,
1981; Mason et al, 199la; 199lb).
Indeed, KPMG (192) comment that the
angels in their study were not
sophisticated about tax matters not
motivated greatly by tax DEMO available
to angels in the UK (but, of course, this
DEMO not explain its low importance for
US business angels) or because DEMO is only
individuals who are not motivated by tax
considerations who become business
angels. A further consideration is that
tax incentives may attract the 'wrong
kind' of individuals to become business
angels, namely those who DEMO seeking
low risk ventures and who lack the skills
to be value-added investors: as the
experience of the UK's Business
Expansion Scheme clearly indicates, tax
incentives to reduce the real cost of
investment in unquoted businesses have
increasingly attracted risk averase
investors (Harrison and Maon, 1989)DEMO
Finally, our survey found that new virgin
angels would be encouraged DEMO become
active investors by the opportunity to
participate with more experienced
investors. This is in marked contrast to
US evidence which indicates that
opportunities DEMO participate with other
investors was seen by virgin angels as a
major inducement to becoming active
(Freear et al, 1992), but is DEMO with
the much lower levels of syndication of
investments reported by active informal
investors (Harrison and Mason, l 992a).
Conclusion
This paper DEMO highlighted the

capital market as a source of equity
capital for companies - especially new
and recent start-ups DEMO seeking small
amounts of finance. In view of the
combination of the decline in the
availability of institutional sources of
venture capital and the DEMO crunch
arising from the financial difficulties of
the banks informal sources of venture
capital seem likely to become even more
significant in the financing DEMO
entrepreneurial companies in the
forseeable future. It is therefore
important to seek ways to expand the
informal venture capital market so that it
can DEMO this growing demand. This
paper has identified two developments
that are required for a significant
expansion of the informal venture capital
market. First, research evidence from
North America and Europe indicates that
active informal investors have DEMO
unallocated funds, and are limited in
making further investments by the
DEMO of finding suitable investment
opportunities. To expand the informal
investment market, DEMO, requires
mechanisms which overcome the high
search costs incurred by investors DEMO
seeking investment opportunities and
entrepreneurs seeking private investors.
Second, only a DEMO proportion of the
potential population of business angels
- that is, DEMO individuals who share a
similar background and profile to
currently active angels - are, in fact,
active. It should, therefore, be possible to
expand the population of business angels
by encouraging more high net DEMO
individuals to put a fraction of their
disposable wealth into investments in
entrepreneurial companies. One
mechanism through which both of these
objectives can be DEMO is the creation
of a national network of locally - or
regionally focussed business
introduction services, using a range of
approaches to linking investors and
investment opportunities. Although well
established in North America, such
services are still at the experimental stage
in Europe. However, based on the
experiences of other business
introduction services, three factors can
be identified as central to the success of
such an initiative: first, that they are DEMO
re sourced, second, that they devote
considerable energy and creativity to the
ongoing marketing of the service to
potential investors and entrepreneurs,
DEMO third, that they undertake pro-active
matching, including providing training
courses to teach investors the techniques
for successful venture investing and
entrepreneurs the techniques DEMO
successfully raising venture capital.

Trust, 1991);
(ii) the average investment per investor in a
company is £20,000 (the average of the
deal sizes reported in Mason et al, 1991 a
and 199lb);DEMO
(iii) 39 per cent of deals are syndicated
between an average of 3.25 investors
(averaged from the figures reported in
Mason etal, DEMO 1991b).
For example, Barclays Bank has been writing
off loans DEMO its £13bn portfolio with small
businesses at the rate of £lm a day since mid-
1991 (Financial Times, 15November1992).
A studies of DEMO investors in the Ottawa-
Carleton area in Canada (Riding and Short,DEMO
1987a) and California (Tymes and Krasner,
1983) found considerably DEMO dissatisfaction
with existing channels of information with
entrepreneurs seeking finance. It might be
hypothesised that this reflects the richer
informal contact networks in these DEMO, both
of which are concentrations of 'high-tech'
industry.
LIN C's performance in 1992 has been
somewhat more impressive, with 21 businesses
raising a total of £1.14 million. This increase
in activity would appear DEMO reflect the growing
difficulties encountered by small firms in
raising finance from other sources and the
increasing awareness of the existence of the
informal DEMO capital amongst small
business owners rather than to significant
changes in the service provided by LINC.

Network) which operates a computerised
