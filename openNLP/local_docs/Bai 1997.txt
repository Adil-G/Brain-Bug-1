ESTIMATION OF A CHANGE POINT IN MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS
Jushan Bai*
Abstract DEMO paper studies the least squares estimation of a change
point in multiple regressions. Consistency, rate of convergence, and
asymptotic distributions are obtained. The DEMO allows for lagged
dependent variables and trending regressors. The error process can be
dependent and heteroskedastic. For nonstationary regressors or distur-
bances, the asymptotic distribution is shown to be skewed. The analytical
density function and the DEMO distribution function for the general
skewed distribution are derived. The analysis applies to both pure and
partial changes. The method is used to analyze DEMO response of market
interest rates to discount rate changes.
I. Introduction
ARAMETER instability for economic models is a
Pcommon phenomenon. This is particularly true DEMO
time-series data covering an extended period, as it is more
likely DEMO the underlying data-generating mechanism to be
disturbed over a longer horizon by various factors such as
policy-regime shift. For example, for the empirical problem
examined in this paper, we ﬁnd that the response pattern of
interest rates to the changes in discount rates varies over
time. The timing DEMO variation is consistent with the timing of
changes in the Fed’s operating procedures. It is well known
that failure to take into account parameter DEMO, given
their presence, may lead to incorrect policy implications and
predictions. On the other hand, proper treatment of param-
eter changes can be useful in uncovering the underlying
factors that fostered the changes, in identifying misspeciﬁca-
tion, and in analyzing the effect of a policy change. The
purpose of this paper is to study the parameter-change
problem in multiple DEMO with an unknown change
point. The main concern is the estimation of the change
point as well as the statistical theory of the change-point
DEMO We derive some useful results under fairly general
conditions.
For independent and identically distributed observations
up to a parameter shift, there is a well-developed theory
under maximum-likelihood estimation (see Hinkley (1970),
Bhattacharya (1987), and Yao (1987)). For a mean shift in
linear processes estimated with the least-squares method, the
theory is also worked out (DEMO Bai (1994) and Antoch et al.
(1996)). For multiple regression models, the change-point
problem is also studied widely. Yet most of the existing work
focuses on testing rather than estimation (e.g., Kim DEMO
Siegmund (1989) and Gombay and Horva´th (1994)). A
number of authors investigated the consistency property for
the estimated change point, but the rate of convergence is not
obtained. These include Krishnaiah and Miao (1988), Hor-

va´th (1994), and Nunes DEMO al. and Newbold (1995), among
others. Consistency is not enough DEMO deriving the asymp-
totic distribution. The rate of convergence is needed for this
purpose.
In this paper we develop the asymptotic theory for the
DEMO change point in multiple regressions. These in-
clude consistency, rate of DEMO, and asymptotic
distribution. While we improve the existing consistency
result by DEMO the rate of convergence, the conditions
required are much weaker than DEMO in the existing litera-
ture. Our model allows for lagged dependent variables and
trending regressors. Furthermore, the disturbances can be
heterogeneous and dependent over time. In particular, we
assume the disturbances form a sequence of mixingale,
which include strong mixing, linear processes, and other
dependent structures DEMO special cases, as shown by Hall and
Heyde (1980) and DEMO (1988). In addition, the rate of
convergence is obtained for both ﬁxed magnitude of shift
and shrinking magnitude of shift. As for DEMO asymptotic
distribution, we show that it is skewed except for stationary
DEMO asymptotically stationary regressors and disturbances. We
also derive the analytical density function and cumulative
distribution function for the skewed distribution. These are
not studied DEMO the existing literature.
Furthermore, the problem is considered in the context DEMO
partial change, in which some of the regression parameters
hold constant DEMO the sample. These parameters are
estimated using the entire sample in order to gain efficiency.
When all parameters are allowed to change, a pure structural
change model is obtained. Therefore a partial structural
change amounts to DEMO parameter restrictions across
regimes. Advantages of a partial change model include more
efficient estimation of the regression parameters and better
conservation of degrees of DEMO The latter is important
for a regression problem with a limited number of observa-
tions but many regressors, which is typical for many
economic applications.
As an application, we study the relationship between
changes in market interest rates and changes in discount rate.
This relationship is found to DEMO unstable over time. It
appears that changes in the Fed’s operating procedures
during the period of October 1979–October 1982 alter the
response pattern. Through DEMO application, we describe in
detail the procedure for implementing the theoretical DEMO
In particular, we discuss how to tackle the problem of
multiple DEMO for empirical problems in a sequential way,
and how to construct conﬁdence intervals.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section DEMO
speciﬁes the model and the underlying assumptions. Consis-
tency, rate of DEMO, and asymptotic distribution are
derived in this section. Construction of conﬁdence DEMO
is considered. Section III studies the response pattern
of market interest rates to changes in the discount rate.

II. Theoretical Result
A. Model and Assumptions
Consider DEMO following linear regression with a change
point at k0:
2
yt 5 w8a1 z8d1 1et,
yt 5 w8ta1 z8d2 1et,
t DEMO 1, 2, . . . , k0
t 5 k0 1 1, ... , T

where yt DEMO an observation on the dependent variable, wt and
zt are vectors DEMO regressors, and et is an unobservable
disturbance. The vectors a, d1, and d2 are unknown param-
eters. We assume d1 Þd2, so DEMO a change has taken place.
The change point k0 is unknown. Our purpose is to estimate
these parameters. The analysis is based on a DEMO
tion. Let xt 5 (w8, zt8)8, b5 (a8, DEMO)8, and d5d2 2d1. Then
equations (1) can be rewritten DEMO

Now zt is a subvector of xt and dÞ 0. More generally, let zt 5
R 8xt, where R is a p 3 q known matrix with full column
rank. This deﬁnes zt as a linear transformation of DEMO For R 5
(0, I )8, with I an identity matrix, a partial change like
equations (1) is obtained. For R 5 I, a pure change model is
obtained.
To present the model in a matrix format, further notation
is necessary. Let Y 5 ( y1,..., yT)8, X 5 (x1, x2,..., x T)8,
e5 (e1, e2,..., eT )8, X1 5 (x1, x2,..., x k,0,...,0)8, DEMO 5
(0,...,0, xk11,..., x T)8, and X0 5 (0,...,0, xk011,
..., xT)8. The matrices X1 and X2 depend on k, but this
dependence will not be displayed for notational simplicity.
Deﬁne Z1, Z2, and Z0 in DEMO similar way (i.e., replace xt by zt ).
Then Z1 DEMO X1R, Z2 5 X2R, and Z0 5 X0R. Equations (2) can
then be rewritten as
Y 5 Xb1 Z0d1e. (3)
The least-squares method is used to estimate the model.
Let ST(k) denote the sum of squared residuals when regress-
ing Y on X and DEMO The change point kˆ is deﬁned as

In practice, the existence of a break may not be known. A
hypothesis testing is often performed. The sup-Wald-type

estimator of (b, d) by regressing Y DEMO X and Z2. Let S denote
the sum of squared residuals by regressing Y on X alone.
From the identity S 2 S(k) k(Z 8MZ 2)dˆk (see Amemiya
(1985, pp. 31–33)), we see that the Wald test statistic is a
monotonic transformation of ST(k). It follows that

That is, the estimator obtained by minimizing the sum of
squared residuals is the same as maximizing Wald-type
statistics. These statistics are used in Andrews (1993) and
others for testing the existence of a change point. Christiano
(DEMO) uses these statistics for estimating potential changes
in U.S. gross national DEMO (GNP). It is useful to note
that, for empirical applications, a break point estimator is
obtained automatically when the null hypothesis is rejected,
combining the testing and estimation in a single step.1

a change point is assumed to exist. In practice, the existence of a break may
not be known a priori. If the existence is determined via a DEMO, such a

A6: The disturbances 5et6 satisfy one of the DEMO

sequence of Lr, r 5 4 1d, mixingales with mixingale numbers
5ct6 and DEMO norms 5ct6. See Hall and Heyde (1980, p. 21)
for the deﬁnition of L2 mixingales and Andrews (1988) for
general Lr DEMO In addition, Sj j 11dc ,` for some d. 0
and maxj 0 cj 0 , K ,`.
Assumption A1 assumes that the shift point is bounded
away from the end points, which is used for asymptotic
purpose. Assumption A2 allows for trending regressors
written in the DEMO (t/T)l, l . 0, or, more generally, DEMO
as any function of the time trend g(t/T ). DEMO them in
this format avoids a scaling matrix that would otherwise be
required when deriving limiting distributions. This format is
also required by assumptions DEMO and A4 because no scaling
matrix is used in these two assumptions. A3 requires that
there be enough data around the change point and DEMO the
beginning and at the end of the sample, so that DEMO change
point can be identiﬁed. The latter half of A3 is typically
implied by the strong law of large numbers for the sequence
of DEMO Assumptions A4 and A5 are standard for linear
regressions, and they DEMO used for the central limit theorem.
Assumption A6a allows for lagged dependent regressors
(e.g., autoregressive models); A6b allows for general serial
correlation DEMO the disturbances. A6 together with A4 and A5
imply the strong law of large numbers for xtet, because
conditions in Hansen (1991) are satisﬁed. These conditions
are sufficient to obtain the rate of convergence for DEMO
estimated break point. Note that no stationarity for regres-
sors or disturbances is required for consistency.
B. Consistency
We shall establish the consistency and DEMO rate of conver-
gence for the change-point estimator. The rate of conver-
gence not only describes how fast the estimator converges to
the true DEMO, it is also necessary in order to derive the
limiting distribution. DEMO will be explained later, it is useful to
consider asymptotic distributions DEMO shrinking magni-
tude of shift such that d depends on T with dT = 0. Thus we
will need the rate of convergence for DEMO shifts.
Apparently the magnitude of shift cannot be too small,
otherwise it will be impossible to identify the change point.

dT = 0, and T 22adT = ` for some a DEMO (0, 1).

DEMO results are obtained for identically and indepen-
dently distributed (i.i.d.) models up to a shift, as in Yao
(1987) and Bhattacharya (DEMO). Bai (1994) derives this
result for a mean shift in linear processes and Picard (1985)
for a Gaussian autoregressive model. To the author’s knowl-
edge, proposition 1 is the ﬁrst result for multiple regression
models.2 Furthermore, the conditions required in this paper
are far less restrictive than those in the existing literature.
This rate of convergence holds DEMO models with lagged
dependent variables, so that the autoregressive model is DEMO
special case. Our result holds for trending regressors. We
also allow for dependent and heterogeneous disturbances.
The disturbances can be a sequence of mixingales, thus
including linear processes and strong mixing processes as
special cases. Under DEMO stronger assumptions, Horva´th
(1994) proves the consistency of tˆ 5 DEMO/T, but without
obtaining the rate of convergence. Proposition 1 implies DEMO
T a(tˆ 2t) converges to zero in probability for any DEMO, 1 for
dT ﬁxed. In a recent work, Nunes et al. (1995) also prove
consistency for the estimated break fraction, but without rate
of convergence. A ﬁxed magnitude of shift is considered by
these DEMO

C. Asymptotic Distribution
We consider two frameworks of asymptotic distribution.
One DEMO based on the ﬁxed magnitude of a shift, the other on DEMO
shrinking magnitude of shift. We ﬁrst consider the case of a
ﬁxed shift. To obtain the limiting distribution, additional
assumptions are necessary. Assume
A8: The process 5zt, et 6t`52` is strictly stationary.
We deﬁne a DEMO process W *(m) on the set of
integers as follows: W *(0) 5 0, W *(m) 5 W1(m) for m , 0
and W *(m) 5 W2(m) for m . 0, with

assuming that (d8zt)2 6 (d8z8)et has a continuous distribution,
then

The above DEMO distribution can be extended to
nonstationary data. For simplicity, assume 5zt, et6 are i.i.d.
(z (1), e(1) ) for t # k0 and 5zt, et6 are i.i.d. (z (2), e(2) ) for t . k0 in
model (2). Then DEMO limiting distribution still holds if one
regards (zi, ei ) in equation (8) as i.i.d. (z (1), e(1) ) and (zi, ei )in
equation (9) as i.i.d. (z (2), e(2)).
To derive the probability function of the limiting distribu-
tion, one must know d and the distribution of 5zt, et6. Hinkley
(1970) studied the case for zt 5 1 and et i.i.d. normal.
Analytical solutions for general cases are typically difficult
to DEMO An alternative asymptotic theory is to consider
small shifts, assuming the DEMO of shifts converges to

zero as the sample size grows unbounded. The result is that
the limiting distribution is invariant to DEMO underlying
distribution of zt and et. The resulting distribution can be
used as an approximation even for large shifts. This idea can
be found DEMO Bhattacharya (1987), Picard (1985), and Yao
(1987) for various special models. This framework is
extended here to general regression models. DEMO, we
allow nonstationary regressors and disturbances. In this
case, the limiting distribution turns out to be nonsymmetric.
We derive the analytical density function DEMO the cumulative
distribution function (cdf) for this general limiting distribu-
tion, so that conﬁdence intervals can be constructed. To this
end, we DEMO assumption A7 to
A78: dT 5d0vT, where vT is a positive number such that
vT = 0 and T (1/2)2avT = ` for some a [ (0, 21) and d0 Þ 0.

D. Conﬁdence Intervals
The results derived above allow easy DEMO of
conﬁdence intervals for the change point. All that is needed
is to construct consistent estimates for Qi, Vi, si2, i 5 1, 2,
and dT. We discuss various special cases below.
1. (DEMO, et) is second-order stationary for the whole sam-
ple. In this case, the limiting distribution is characterized
by equation (13) or equation (14). For serially uncorrelated
disturbances, we only need estimates for DEMO, Q, and s2.An
estimate for dT is already available; Q DEMO s2 are estimated
by T 21StT51 ztz8 and T 21StT51 eˆ

For serially correlated disturbances we need an DEMO
for V, which can be obtained by the method of Newey DEMO
West (1987). Deﬁne Lˆ 5 (dˆT8Qˆ dˆ )2/(dˆT8Vˆ dˆT ). The conﬁdence
interval is again given by equation (17) with this new Lˆ .
2. (zt, et) is stationary within each regime. In this case,
the limiting distribution is described by DEMO (12). The
quantities to be estimated are Qi, Vi, DEMO 5 1, 2, and
estimate Q1 by kˆ 21Stkˆ51 ztz 8, and Q2 by (T 2 kˆ )21StT5

III. Empirical Result
In this DEMO we analyze the response of market interest
rates to the changes in the discount rates. The discount rate is
the rate at which the DEMO lends and is set by the Fed. It has
been noted by many researchers that discount-rate changes
of the same size can have different DEMO on market interest
rates (see Dueker (1992) and the references DEMO). The
differentials in the response may reﬂect different causes that
prompted the Fed to change the discount rates or reﬂect the
conditions of DEMO economy. Here we model the response of
market interest rates to discount-rate changes by a simple
linear model and examine the response pattern over DEMO As
an additional purpose, this application illustrates the proce-
dures for DEMO the theoretical results.
A. The Data
Data used in this analysis can be found in Dueker (1992).
The yields of three-month T-bills are used as the market
interest rates. The range of data spans 1973 DEMO 1989. Over
this period, there were 56 changes in the discount DEMO made
by the Fed. An observation is obtained every time there is a
change in the discount rate. A change in interest rate is
DEMO as the closing T-bill rate on the day of a
discount-rate change, minus the closing T-bill rate the day
before the change. Thus the data are in daily level (fre-
quency). Because discount rates are changed irregularly, the
observations are not equally spaced in calendar time.
Changes in the discount rate are plotted in ﬁgure 1 along
with changes DEMO interest rates. The vertical dotted lines
represent the size and direction of the discount-rate changes.
The solid line represents the changes in interest rate.
DEMO The Model
The following simple linear regression is used to describe
the response relationship:
DTBi 5a1bDDRi 1ei
(19)
where DDRi denotes the change in the discount rate for the
ith observation, DTBi denotes the change in the market
interest rate, and ei is a stochastic disturbance. Because the
data have daily frequency and two adjacent observations are
generally DEMO apart over time, it is reasonable to assume that
the ei DEMO uncorrelated over time. In particular, under the
efficient-market hypothesis, ei will be a sequence of martin-
gale differences. In this case, equation (DEMO) describes the
market’s reaction to the ‘‘news’’ of the Fed’s discount-rate
DEMO This model is similar in spirit to the one used by
Roley and Wheatley (1990) in their study of interest-rate
response to the DEMO announcement surprises. The appro-
priateness of this model is further discussed in the comment
section below.
The above simple linear relationship assumes that a
DEMO in the discount rate of the same size in absolute value
(DEMO of an increase or a decrease) has the same effect
FIGURE DEMO IN DISCOUNT AND INTEREST RATES (DOTTED VERTICAL
LINES—DISCOUNT-RATE CHANGES; SOLID CURVE—INTEREST-RATE CHANGES)
on market interest rates. It is possible that an increase DEMO the
discount rate has a different impact on interest rates from a
decrease, if the direction of discount-rate changes carries
economic or ﬁnancial information. Therefore we suggest a
modiﬁed response model,

(20)
where DDR 1 5 max 50, DDR6 and DDR 2 5DDR 1 2
DDR . When this model is DEMO to the data, the adjusted R2
shows a marked improvement over DEMO (19). Also, the
hypothesis of equal coefficients for DDR 1 and DDR 2 is
easily rejected. Both models are to be examined. DEMO ﬁrst
will be referred to as the symmetric response model, and DEMO
second as the asymmetric response model. We will compare
the estimation results. In particular, we examine how the
estimated change points are affected by model speciﬁcation.
C. Estimation Procedure
For empirical problems, more than one break may exist,
as evidenced by the empirical application here. We discuss DEMO
procedure capable of detecting and locating multiple breaks.
The procedure is based on hypothesis testing and works as
follows. Starting from the whole sample, perform a param-
eter constancy test. If the test rejects the null DEMO,
then estimate a break point and divide the sample into two
subsamples at the estimated break point. Perform a param-
eter constancy test DEMO each subsample. Estimate an addi-
tional break whenever the subsample fails the constancy
test. Divide the subsample at the estimated break point (if
any) into nested subsamples and do the same analysis. This
step is repeated until all the subsamples do not reject the null
hypothesis. If the DEMO of break points is known a priori,
then no hypothesis testing is necessary. In this case, one just
estimates the break points sequentially in the ordering for
which the sum of squared residuals is reduced DEMO most, until
the speciﬁed number of breaks is obtained. This is DEMO
in Bai and Perron (1994). Analogously, if it is known that the
number of breaks is at least m, then no testing is necessary
for the ﬁrst m break points.
CHANGE POINT ESTIMATION IN MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS
When all of the break DEMO are obtained, a reﬁnement is
needed. An estimated change point should DEMO reestimated if
it is obtained from a sample or subsample containing more
than one break. This reestimation procedure is called
reﬁnement. Suppose there are DEMO two breaks and they are
identiﬁed as kˆ1 and kˆ2, kˆ1 , kˆ2.If kˆ1 is identiﬁed in the ﬁrst
place (i.e., from the whole sample), then kˆ1 should be
reestimated using the subsample [1, kˆ2 ]. Similarly, if kˆ2 is
identiﬁed in advance of kˆ1, DEMO the second break should be
reestimated using the subsample [kˆ1, T DEMO Each reﬁned estima-
tor has the same asymptotic distribution as if the sample had
a single break point, so that our asymptotic theory can be
applied, as asserted by Bai (1995b). This procedure was DEMO
suggested in an earlier version of this paper. A reﬁnement
may be performed prior to the complete estimation of all of
the breaks.
It DEMO important to note that the Wald statistic is designed
for a single break point; it has less power when multiple
breaks exist. This is because sˆ 2(k ) in equation (4) is not a
DEMO estimator of s2 and is biased upward in the
presence of multiple breaks. Although for large samples (or
for a large magnitude of shift) one will reject the null
hypothesis regardless of the consistency3 of sˆ 2(k ), the lack
of power may not be negligible for small or moderate
samples. Fortunately, the problem can be overcome by a
simple modiﬁcation of the test statistic.4 In constructing the
test statistic (4), the residual variance in the denominator is
estimated by allowing for DEMO than one break. For moder-
ate sample sizes, two or three DEMO should be good enough
in adjusting the denominator of equation (4)DEMO In our empiri-
cal application, this adjustment is made for the DEMO sample
test. Critical values of the hypothesis testing are obtained
assuming 15% precent ‘‘trimming’’ and 10% signiﬁcance
level. The size of a test should DEMO large for small samples, as
we choose here. The critical values DEMO 10.01 for q 5 2 and
12.27 for q 5 3. Here q denotes the number of coefficients
that are allowed to change (see Andrews (1993)).
D. Test and Estimation Results
Symmetric Response Model: When the whole sample is
tested for parameter constancy, the sup-Wald statistic is
8.05, occurring at October 9, 1979 (k 5 28). The test does
not show instability compared with the critical value of
DEMO However, if we proceed to divide the sample into two
subsamples DEMO the estimated break date and test for param-
eter constancy for each subsample, we will ﬁnd that the
second subsample has a sup-Wald statistic of 15.20, occur-
ring at December 4, 1981 (k 5 38). This indicates the
existence of a break. In addition, if we use the subsample
[1, 37] to test parameter constancy, the sup-Wald DEMO 58.15,
3 Because S 2 ST(k ) converges to inﬁnity as the sample size increases
and §ˆ2(k ) is stochastically bounded, it follows that the Wald test statistic
becomes arbitrarily large as the DEMO size grows.
4 When the null hypothesis can be rejected without this modiﬁcation, it
will imply a stronger evidence of instability.

achieved at October 9, 1979 (k 5 28), strongly rejecting the
null. DEMO, when the subsample [38, 56] is used, we
uncover another DEMO point at August 27, 1982 (k 5 42)
with sup-Wald 11.44. Further tests for each resulting sub-
sample do not show instability. DEMO analysis indeed indicates
the existence of multiple breaks. The failure to uncover any
break with the full sample proves the lack of power for DEMO
sup-Wald test in the face of multiple breaks. As a veriﬁca-
tion, if we use the adjustment mentioned earlier by estimat-
ing the variance using residuals based on two breaks (at
observations 28 and 38), the sup-Wald statistic for the whole
sample becomes 11.96, thereby rejecting the null.
The ﬁnal model has three breaks, occurring at the dates
October 9, 1979, December 4, 1981, and August 27, 1982.
(DEMO terms of observation numbers, they are 28, 38, and 42,DEMO
respectively.) Because the middle break is estimated with the
subsample [28, 56], a reﬁnement is obtained by reestimating
the middle break with the subsample [28, 41]. When this is
performed, the same break point DEMO obtained, but the
sup-Wald becomes 33.00. The other two breaks are DEMO
already. These estimates are summarized in table 1. The ﬁrst
break point marks the beginning of the Fed’s October
1979–October 1982 operating procedure changes. DEMO last
break is near the end of the Fed’s procedure changes. It
remains an open question as to what economic activity
induces the second DEMO The estimated regression coeffi-
cients are reported in table 2.
Asymmetric Response Model: The adjusted sup-Wald
statistic for the full sample is 13.56, DEMO the null
hypothesis5 (the critical value is 12.27 for q 5 DEMO). The
maximum is again achieved on October 9, 1979 (k 5 28).
For the subsample [1, 27], the sup-Wald statistic DEMO 9.23,
which is not signiﬁcant compared with the critical value of
12.26. For the subsample [28, 56], only two of the three
DEMO (the intercept and DDR 1 ) are allowed to change,
DEMO of the lack of variation in the data. The sup-Wald
statistic is 10.001, which is just shy of signiﬁcance com-
pared with the critical value of 10.01 (note that q 5 2). The
maximum is attained on August 27, 1982 (k 5 42). This date
DEMO be treated as a break point for an additional reason
besides the closeness of the test statistic to the critical value.
When the subsample DEMO, 41] is used to reﬁne the ﬁrst break,
the sup-Wald DEMO is 37.07, more than triple the value
computed for the full DEMO (see footnote 5). This is a sign
of multiple breaks. DEMO reﬁned break point is on September
19, 1979 (k 5 27).
Further hypothesis testing for each resulting subsample
does not reveal additional DEMO In particular, the middle
break point (k 5 38) associated DEMO the symmetric response
model does not show up here. The sup-Wald statistic for the
subsample [28, 41] is only 6.55, as opposed to DEMO under
the symmetric response model. Thus the middle break point
identiﬁed in the ﬁrst model is accounted for by the asymmet-
ric response. In DEMO, two break points are identiﬁed.
5 The adjustment assumes two breaks DEMO estimating the variance. Without
this adjustment, the sup-Wald statistic for the DEMO sample is 10.25.

regime exhibits a higher response to discount-rate changes,
particularly to discount-rate increases.
E. Conﬁdence Intervals
Symmetric Response Model: For this model, three breaks
are identiﬁed, at the dates of October DEMO, 1979, December 4,
1981, and August 27, 1982. (DEMO observation numbers are
28, 38, and 42, respectively.) We ﬁrst consider constructing
conﬁdence intervals using the symmetric limiting distribu-
tion (derived assuming homogeneous data). Those using the
skewed limiting distribution are given later. DEMO ﬁrst break is
estimated with the subsample [1, 37]. From table DEMO we see
that dˆ 5 (20.403, 20.171)8. For zt 5 (1, DDRt)8, the
estimated scale factor Lˆ is dˆ(371 S137 zt z8 )dˆ/s2 5 7.95, where s2
is the DEMO error variance. The 97.5% quantile of the
limiting distribution is 11.0, DEMO from equation (B.4).
By equation (17), the upper boundary of the 95% conﬁdence
interval will be 28 1 [11.0/7.95] 1 DEMO 5 30. By symmetry,
the conﬁdence interval is [26, 30]. DEMO second break is
estimated with the sample [28, 41] with dˆ DEMO (1.028, 0.373)8.
The estimated scale factor is Lˆ 5dˆ(141 S2841 zt z8 )dˆ/s2 5 24.35.

Thus the upper boundary of the conﬁdence interval is 38 1
[11.0/DEMO 1 1 5 39. Again by symmetry, the conﬁdence
interval is DEMO, 39]. Using the same method, the conﬁdence
interval for the third break point is found to be [39, 45].
These results are reported in table 1. Conﬁdence intervals in
calendar time are provided in table DEMO The ﬁrst two breaks
are estimated with more precision, the last DEMO has a larger
interval.
In the above construction it is assumed that the two
neighboring regimes surrounding each break have homoge-
neous data. By DEMO inspection of ﬁgure 1 we see that this
is not the case. For example, the magnitude of the regressors
for the second regime, DEMO 79–August 89, is typically
twice the magnitude for the ﬁrst regime. DEMO suggests that
Q1 is not equal to Q2. Thus Q1 and Q2 should be estimated
separately. In addition, the disturbances may not have
common variance cross regimes, thus conﬁdence intervals
based on a skewed limiting distribution might be more
appropriate. For the ﬁrst break point, we estimate Q1 by
271 St2751 zt z8 and Q2 by 101 St37528 zt z8. DEMO j is estimated by the
ratio of dˆ8 (101 St37528 zt DEMO )dˆ8 and dˆ8 (271 S127 zt z8 )dˆ8. This gives
DEMO 1.08. The ratio is estimated by s22/s12, yielding
2.556. Thus DEMO estimated f is (s2/s1)2jˆ 5 2.771. Using
equations (B.2) and (B.3) for j5 1.085 and f5 2.771, the
97.5% DEMO is 28.0, the 2.5% quantile is 29.2. The scale
s2
2/DEMO
2
factor L 5d8Q1d/s1 is estimated to be 10.72. From equation
(18), the lower boundary of the interval is 28 2 [28/10.72]
2 1 5 25. The upper boundary is 28 2 [9.2/DEMO 1 1 5
29. Thus an asymmetric 95% conﬁdence interval is [25, 29].
Using the same method, the conﬁdence interval for the
second DEMO is [37, 39], and for the third break it is [39, 44].
The skewed conﬁdence intervals are similar to the symmet-
ric ones, except that the ﬁrst is wider.
Asymmetric Response Model: For this DEMO, two break
points are identiﬁed, the ﬁrst is September 19, DEMO, and the
second is August 27, 1982. (The observation numbers DEMO 27
and 42, respectively.) Assuming homogeneous data, the
conﬁdence interval DEMO the ﬁrst break is found to be [25, 29],

The corresponding intervals in calendar time are given in
table 5.
F. Some Comments
1. Changes in the DEMO rates may be affected by many
other variables, such as money DEMO, unemployment, and
industrial production. These macroeconomic variables are
relatively smooth (DEMO frequency data) compared with the
daily interest rates. We believe that DEMO variables are
reﬂected more in the level of the interest rates than in the
changes. Changes in the daily interest rates may be treated DEMO
white noise in the absence of ‘‘news’’ under the efficient
market hypothesis. On the day that the discount rate is
altered, the change in the interest rate consists of two
components: a response to a change in the discount rate, and
an idiosyncratic variation, at least in DEMO absence of other
‘‘news.’’ This is the rationale for considering models (DEMO)
and (20). Nevertheless, the condition of the economy may
affect the strength of a response. One might argue, for
example, DEMO high unemployment spurs a stronger reaction.
If this is the case, DEMO an interactive term of DDRt and the
unemployment rate may be added as a separate explanatory
variable. In this case, the simple model (DEMO) amounts to an
omitted-variable speciﬁcation. However, one aspect of the
structural change method is (or can be viewed as) identify-
ing misspeciﬁcation. DEMO result shows that the misspeciﬁca-
tion is due, perhaps, more to the omission of the Fed’s policy
as a variable than to the DEMO of inclusion of other macroeco-
nomic variables.
2. We point out that observation 42 (August 27, 1982) is
unusual. The discount rate was cut down by a half-point,
whereas the market interest rate rose DEMO 0.7 point. Three cuts
were made in the month of August, DEMO by a half-point.
This is the only month in which the Fed changed the
discount rate so frequently. The market reacted strongly to
the DEMO two cuts. Even though the timing of discount-rate
changes is generally not easily predicted (see Dueker
(1992)), the third cut seems to have been anticipated by the
market. The day before the cut, the market interest rate was
the lowest of that week.
When a dummy DEMO is made to account for this
observation, the result is not DEMO much for either the
symmetric or the asymmetric response models. The number

of breaks and their locations DEMO the same, except that the last
break is identiﬁed at observation DEMO (November 22, 1982)
rather than at 42. This change is not dramatic and is not
unexpected, because observation 42 is the boundary of a
regime in the absence of this dummy. Tests and estimation
DEMO for this case are not reported here.
3. The 1979 and 1982 breaks are identiﬁed under both the
symmetric and the asymmetric response models, suggesting
a stronger evidence in supporting these two breaks. The
1981 break DEMO only under the symmetric response,
illustrating the sensitivity of break point estimation to model
speciﬁcation. The asymmetric response model appears to be
a DEMO one. In the absence of breaks, the asymmetric
model ﬁts the DEMO better in terms of the adjusted R2. The
regression coefficients of DDR 1 and DDR 2 are signiﬁcantly
different. With breaks, direct comparison of R2 is not
appropriate, as regression equations cover different time
periods. An asymmetric response model will be meaningful
if the sign of the discount-rate DEMO provides information
about the Fed’s monetary policy objectives. At any rate, DEMO
hypothesis of asymmetric response deserves further exami-
nation in future research.
IV. Conclusion
We have studied the change-point problem in multiple
regressions where some DEMO all of the coefficients have a shift
occurring at an unknown time. Consistency and the limiting
distribution are established for the change-point estimator
computed DEMO the least-squares method. The results are
obtained under very general conditions. In particular our
results hold for a wide range of regressors such as DEMO
istic and stochastic regressors, lagged dependent variables,
and time trend. DEMO and heteroskedastic disturbances
are allowed. We derived a skewed and parameter-embedded
analytical density function and a cumulative distribution
function for the asymptotic distribution of DEMO change-point
estimator. The result includes the symmetric distribution in
the prior literature as a special case and is useful for
constructing conﬁdence intervals for DEMO true break. The
empirical analysis examined the relationship between the
interest-rate responses to the changes in the discount rate.
This response pattern is found DEMO be unstable. The instability
seems to be caused by the Fed’s change in operating
procedures during the period of October 1979–October
1982. In addition, we documented the asymmetry in the
response pattern. The regression result suggests DEMO larger
response to an increase in the discount rate than to a

\ A(k)21 \ is bounded with large probability for all large k0 2 k. This implies
DEMO the minimum eigenvalue of A(k) is bounded away from zero DEMO all

DEMO z8t )d2 2d8Stk5k011 zt et, which has the same distribution as

bounded set DEMO integers around k0. Now the process W*(m) has a unique
DEMO with probability 1 when (d8zt)2 1 2d8ztet has a continuous

Density Function DEMO arg maxv Z(v) (see equation (11))
Recall that the process Z(v) involves two independent Brownian
motions with different scales (fÞ 1) and two different drifts jÞ 1. To
obtain the DEMO function of l* 5 arg maxv Z(v), we use the argument of
Bhattacharya and Brockwell (1976), who considered the case in which the
two Brownian motions have the same scale. In addition to DEMO density
function, we also derive the cdf of l *, which is useful for obtaining
quantiles when constructing conﬁdence intervals. Let m be DEMO maximum
and l the location of the maximum of X(t) DEMO(t) 2ut/2, t $ 0, where
B(t ) DEMO a standard Brownian motion process on [0, `). That is, l 5
arg maxt X(t ) and m 5 maxt X(DEMO ). Using the result of Bhattacharya and
Brockwell (1976) with DEMO scale transformation, we obtain the joint density

The marginal distribution of m is exponential with mean l2/u. Now DEMO

joint density of (l1, m1 )is f1( 0 x0 , y), where f1 is the same as equation (B.1)

5Îf )W2 (v) 2jv /26, v . 0, with DEMO density f2(x, y) (given by equation
(B.1) with DEMO Îf and u5j). Because (l1, m1 ) is independent of (l2, m2 ),
the joint density of (l1, m1, l2, m2 )is f1( 0 x0 , y) f2(x8, y8 ). Let l* 5 arg
maxv Z(v). Then l* 5 l1 if m1 . m2 and l* 5 l2 if m1 , m2. Thus the density
