A Nobel Prize for Game Theorists: The
Contributions of Harsanyi, Nash and
Selten
Faruk DEMO
I n 1994, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the DEMO Prize in
economics to John C. Harsanyi, John F. Nash and DEMO Selten for their
contributions to noncooperative game theory. This was the first time the acad-
emy had awarded a Nobel Prize to game theorists. DEMO is difficult to imagine more
appropriate recipients. The purpose of this essay is to discuss and to celebrate the
contributions of these three researchers DEMO game theory and economic analysis.
I will not attempt to provide a full catalogue of the achievements of the three
Nobel prize winners, nor will I attempt to discuss their individual papers in detail.
A detailed DEMO of a large portion of the work of Harsanyi, Nash and DEMO can
be found in two excellent surveys, Guth (1994) and DEMO Damme and Weibull
(1995). A more concise treatment of the DEMO material is provided in Van Damme
(1995). Although I have DEMO greatly from these three papers in writing this
essay, my focus DEMO is somewhat different: to identify the impact of the work of
DEMO, Nash and Selten on microeconomic theory in the last half-century and
DEMO point to the parts of their papers that contained the most influential ideas. Thus,
I begin by reviewing the development of the role DEMO game theory within modern
economic analysis by focusing on the contributions of researchers other than Har-
sanyi, Nash and Selten. This will provide the proper context for the subsequent
discussion the work of the three Nobel DEMO winners. The final section contains a
few closing comments on evaluating the role of game theory and the style of re-
search championed by DEMO, Nash and Selten.
Game Theory and Economic Analysis

now call the Nash equilibrium of this DEMO
John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern are justly viewed as the founders
of modern game theory. The work of von Neumann and Morgenstern differs DEMO
the previous examples of game-theoretic analysis both in terms of the generality of
their approach and the ambitiousness of their project. In von Neumann DEMO Mor-
genstern (1944), they define two-person zero-sum games in normal DEMO and
showed the existence of a solution, or equilibrium, in such games.' They also define
extensive form games, discuss cooperation and coalition DEMO, and much
more. They state that their objective is to "find the mathematically complete prin-
ciples which define 'rational behavior' for the DEMO in a social economy and
to derive from them the general characteristics of that behavior."
Signs that game theory might fulfill the promise DEMO its founders had foreseen
can be found as early as the 1960s. In a path-breaking article on auction theory,
Vickrey (1961) describes DEMO purpose as investigating Abba Lerner's claim that a
socialist government armed with a sufficiently powerful computer could reproduce
market outcomes through a centralized DEMO What is most striking is that Vick-
rey's investigation of this issue focuses not on the computational difficulty of finding
the right prices DEMO on transaction costs, issues that had been the focus of earlier
DEMO on the workability of socialism, but on incentive issues. Thus, in the
absence of markets, incentive constraints and strategic considerations are viewed
as defining the set of feasible outcomes from which socially desirable outcomes are

In another paper written about the same time, Vickrey (1960) addressed the
problem of misrepresentation of preferences in a social choice setting. Arrow's
(1963) celebrated theorem establishes the impossibility of having DEMO social choice
function that satisfies Pareto efficiency, an axiom concerning the DEMO of
irrelevant alternatives and is not dictatorial. The desirability of Pareto efficiency
and not having a dictator are obvious. But in spite of its DEMO, the normative
appeal of the axiom of the independence of irrelevant DEMO, which states
that the social ranking of two alternatives should depend DEMO on individuals' rank-
ing of those two particular alternatives, is less clear. However, Vickrey pointed out
that a social welfare function not satisfying this property might be susceptible to
strategic misrepresentation of preferences. Hence, Vickrey helped bring strategic
' A normal form or strategic form game refers DEMO a static description of the strategic interaction. In a
normal form game, the players are to choose their actions simultaneously. A single static strategy may
in principle correspond to a complicated contingent plan. Therefore, a dynamic strategic interaction
can also be modeled as a normal form game. However, in a normal form game, the dynamic nature of
the interaction is not made explicit. By contrast, an extensive form game is a representation of the
strategic interaction that renders the timing of moves and the DEMO of the players when they
move explicit.

considerations to the forefront in the analysis of allocative DEMO and in the
abstract analysis of social choice problems.
In 1972, DEMO provided a detailed example showing that the competitive
mechanism might itself be susceptible to strategic manipulation. By the mid-1970s,
researchers felt the need DEMO augment their models of competitive equilibrium with
game-theoretic models of competition among producers. It was thought that price-
taking behavior was unwarranted when the DEMO of producers was small. By the
end of the decade, it DEMO felt that competitive equilibria in general could benefit
from noncooperative foundations. This development was significant: the idea of
seeking justifications for the most basic model of economic analysis, perfect com-
petition, would have been considered DEMO a decade earlier. Recall that even
Vickrey had used game theory to study what might happen when markets could
not operate, not to justify market equilibrium. Thus, game theory became far more
central to economic analysis in the 1970s.
Another significant development of the early 1970s was the DEMO of in-
formation economics. After Akerlof's (1970) path-breaking paper on the used car
market, a number of prominent papers modeled asymmetric information between
the buyers and sellers of labor (Spence, 1976) or insurance (Rothschild and Stiglitz,
1976). The key common characteristics of the latter papers were that they made
novel and surprising observations regarding markets DEMO market failure and that
they employed a new formalism. This formalism was neither a model of perfect
competition nor a game. The timing of DEMO or choices was often not clear. It
was not obvious who knew what at the time the choices were made and who acted
first DEMO who reacted. The difficult trick in these models was to come up with a
notion of equilibrium that captured some of the unmodeled dynamics. DEMO
clearing, zero profit and best response conditions were used simultaneously in DEMO
fining equilibrium. It was no coincidence that there often seemed to be some dif-
ficulty with defining and establishing the existence of equilibrium in DEMO
models.
Prior to the 1970s, the theory of industrial organization was DEMO by
mostly descriptive analysis loosely built around the ideal of perfect competition. In
this setting, it was difficult to address many of the main issues of industrial orga-
nization. Economists had developed a rich theory of DEMO competition and the
case of monopoly was straightforward enough. However, the DEMO cases
appeared troublesome. In the absence of a theory of strategic behavior, it was dif-
ficult to construct a useful model of competition among a small number of agents.
There were attempts to reshuffle elements of DEMO competition and monopoly
to create a non-game-theoretic theory for the intermediate case, like the theory of
monopolistic competition or the idea that oligopolies faced kinked demand curves.
In retrospect, these models appear mildly amusing and perhaps a little embarrass-
ing, rather than genuinely enlightening.
There were other more subtle difficulties in attempting to study industrial
organization without the benefit of DEMO theory. For example, without a dynamic
theory of strategic interaction, collusion seemed impossible or irrational or at least
162 Journal of Economic
Perspectives
not explainable within the realm of standard DEMO Moreover, in the absence
of a model of information, certain issues like the analysis of research and devel-
opment or the role of DEMO laws and advertising were impossible to understand.
The well-documented cases of perversely low prices in secondary markets appeared
as anomalies. This is not to DEMO that none of these issues could possibly be discussed
fruitfully without the aid of game theory. However, game theory provided a unified
and effective tool for addressing all of these problems.
Perhaps the most important development DEMO the 1970s was the work on "su-
pergames"-that is, infinitely repeated games-and noncooperative collusion. Re-
peated interaction provides agents with the opportunity DEMO make credible threats
or promises regarding future behavior. The availability of such threats and promises
enables higher (and lower) payoffs to be sustained DEMO a noncooperative equilibrium
than would be possible in a one-shot interaction. The first papers to establish this
point were Friedman (1971) and Aumann DEMO Shapley (1976). (Both of these pa-
pers used Selten's notion of a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, to be discussed
in the next section.) The opportunity for rationalizing behavior that is inconsistent
with short-term incentives as a part of a dynamic equilibrium, and the resulting
theory of noncooperative collusion is perhaps the most important single achieve-
ment of DEMO theory.
It was the work of Harsanyi and Selten that provided the tools needed for the
modern theory of industrial organization. However, a critical step in the incorpo-
ration of Selten's ideas on dynamic strategic DEMO into the theory of industrial
organization was the idea of sequential equilibrium due to Kreps and Wilson
(1982). Sequential equilibrium was closely related to Selten's notion of trembling-
hand perfect equilibrium (again, to DEMO discussed in the next section). Unlike Sel-
ten's notion of equilibrium, however, sequential equilibrium proved to be often
easy to compute DEMO easily adapted to games in which either the choice of actions,
such as price or quantity, or some other variable was a continuous variable.3 These
turned out to be the type of games that were DEMO useful for the theory of industrial
organization.
In the 1980s, armed DEMO models of asymmetric information, dynamic strategic
interaction and insights from the DEMO economics of the 1970s, economists
developed truly game-theoretic models of industrial DEMO
Meanwhile, Rubinstein (1982) investigated a problem that had been, for the
most part, thought to be outside the domain of economic analysis: suppose two
agents need to agree on a division of a unit of surplus. On what division will they
agree, if any? The DEMO response to this question was that bilateral monopoly
was the quintessential example of the absence of market forces, and hence eco-
nomics had nothing to say on the matter, except perhaps that an efficient outcome
would be reached. However, Rubinstein modeled this interaction as a dynamic
3 Sequential equilibrium has the additional advantage of emphasizing beliefs rather than trembles. The
DEMO and interpretation of such small probability mistakes were less clear to most economists, es-
pecially prior to the work of Kreps and Wilson.

game with impatient players and concluded that there would exist, in many cases,
a unique equilibrium. In this equilibrium, DEMO is reached immediately, and
the pie is shared roughly in inverse DEMO to the level of the agents' impa-
tience. This was a DEMO development. Game theory had yielded a determi-
nate, reasonable answer to DEMO of the most intractable problems of economic anal-
ysis. Once an answer to the problem of bilateral monopoly was found, then it
seemed plausible that answers to many other problems could be built up from that.
DEMO by the success of the new theory of industrial organization, game DEMO
ory became a popular tool in many other fields of economics as well; finance, public
finance, international trade, labor economics, political science and macroeco-
nomics experienced an infusion of game-theoretic ideas. Of course, descriptive,
competitive and other forms of analysis that have nothing to do DEMO game theory
continue to play an important role in these disciplines, DEMO more and more, the
language of game theory has become the DEMO of economics. In his article on

is to wear one's theory lightly." Since the 1980s, chances are that the DEMO worn
theory has in it a good deal of game theory.
However, perhaps the biggest impact of game theory has been on what one
might call pure theory; that branch of economics that focuses on developing tools
and investigating the foundations of economic analysis. The extensive use of DEMO
theoretic models in applied theory led to a great deal of research interest in re-
finement and critique of these tools, as well as a search for alternatives. More and
more, "pure" theorist came to mean game theorist, even though other kinds of
theory continued to prosper as well. Relatedly, game theory has become the center
of a particular approach to economics; one that values precision and generality of
the underlying ideas and emphasizes the usefulness of abstraction and formalism.
To put it DEMO way, game theory has become the meeting place for those who
DEMO not wish to wear their theory so lightly. This is a role that game theory has, at
least partially, taken over from general DEMO analysis since the 1970s.
The Contributions of Nash, Harsanyi and Selten
DEMO three most important ideas in noncooperative game theory are equilib-
rium, DEMO information and credibility. These also happen to be the contri-
butions of John F. Nash, John C. Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten, respectively.
In DEMO paper "Non-Cooperative Games," John Nash (1950b) defined the con-
DEMO of an n-person (finite) game and an equilibrium point of such a game. Nash
summarized his contribution modestly in the introduction as follows: "The notion
of an equilibrium point is the key ingredient in our theory. This notion yields a
generalization of the concept of the solution DEMO a two-person zero-sum game. It
turns out that the set of equilibrium points of a two-person zero-sum game is simply
the set of all DEMO 'good strategies.' " In other words, an equilibrium point is

strategy is a best response to the DEMO of the others. These equilibrium points
are now called Nash equilibria.
Nash proved that all finite n-person games have at least one equilibrium. He
DEMO the theory of two person zero-sum games to allow for multiple players and
arbitrary payoffs. Before his work, much emphasis was placed on the fact that equilib-
rium, when attention is restricted to two-person zero-sum games, provides safe payoffs
to agents. The more general setting enabled Nash to isolate the idea of "opposing
good strategies," or a best response. Hence, the modem theory of rational strategic
interaction, one that is DEMO of dealing with economic problems, not just "games,"
was DEMO To this day, the notion of a Nash equilibrium continues to DEMO the main
vehicle for determining the social consequence of conflicting individual interests. Fi-
nite n-person games are still the main tools for summarizing many DEMO the essential
insights of game theory such as the conflict between individual incentives and effi-
ciency, the problem of coordination, the importance of DEMO about opponents'
reasoning and so on. The theory of finite normal form games, exactly as formulated
by Nash, is also the initial DEMO ground for most new game-theoretic ideas.
In two related papers, "The Bargaining Problem" and "Two-Person Cooperative
Games," Nash (1950c, 1953) defined the two-person bargaining problem, proposed
his axiomatic solution and provided a cooperative theory for two-person non-zero-sum
games that leads to his bargaining solution. DEMO first of these papers has had an enor-
mous impact. The axiomatic approach initiated by this paper continues to be an active
area of DEMO The particular solution proposed by Nash is still the main benchmark
for this subfield and is a frequently used tool in more applied research. DEMO terms of
noncooperative game theory, however, the more significant contribution of these two
papers is the initiation of what is now called the "Nash programr."
The meaning of this term can be understood by DEMO the two papers to-
gether: The bargaining problem is a description DEMO the utilities that can be achieved.
Nash in the first paper considers an abstract rule that picks a solution from any
possible bargaining problem. DEMO simple and reasonable axioms yield a unique
solution now called the Nash bargaining solution. The second paper takes as its
starting point a normal DEMO game, views the set of possible outcomes of this game
as DEMO attainable payoffs of a bargaining problem, describes a new noncooperative
game DEMO model the negotiation procedure, computes a Nash equilibrium of the
negotiation DEMO and observes that this Nash equilibrium results in the payoffs
associated with the bargaining solution. Thus, the axiomatic solution is justified by
showing that it is the Nash equilibrium outcome of some noncooperative game.
This is DEMO Nash program.
Stated in its most extreme form, the view underlying DEMO Nash program is that
all nonstrategic (positive or normative) theories, DEMO as the theory of perfect com-
petition, are in fact goals DEMO guesses as to what might happen.4 The feasibility of

these goals or the validity of the DEMO is to be established by showing them to be
the Nash equilibrium outcomes of a sensible noncooperative model of strategic
interaction-that is, of a noncooperative game. Vickrey's work discussed in the
previous section can be DEMO to be within the Nash program. The work on
auctions aims to determine if a socialist government can achieve market outcomes,
while the DEMO of Arrow's impossibility theorem suggests that social choice
rules that fail the independence of irrelevant alternatives condition are not feasible.
The work of DEMO 1970s and 1980s on decentralization and noncooperative foun-
dations of competitive equilibria are readily seen to be examples of the Nash pro-
gram with DEMO extended definition. Here we are verifying that competitive equilib-
ria are reasonable outcomes of economic situations by noting that they can be
supported as DEMO Nash equilibrium of certain games. Rubinstein's (1982) classic
paper is easily seen to fall within this program as well.
By the 1960s, it seemed clear to many if not most economists and game theorists
DEMO much of economic theory was based on an implausible and perhaps misleading
assumption of complete or symmetric information. Three seminal papers by Akerlof
(1970), Spence (1976) and Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) were among DEMO earliest
attempts to deal with the problem of asymmetric information. By the time these
papers were written, most of the relevant game-theoretic tools had already been
developed by Harsanyi and Selten. However, these tools were not yet sufficiently
understood or refined and consequently, they had not made their way into the tool
chest of most economists.
solution concepts. For the DEMO of identifying the impact of Nash's work on game theory and eco-
nomics, this more comprehensive definition may be more suitable.
166 Journal of Economic
Perspectives
In 1967, John Harsanyi published the first in a sequence of three papers
entitled "Games of Incomplete Information Played by 'Bayesian' Players." His
work would soon provide economists with the much needed tools and vocabulary
for studying the problems of asymmetric information. DEMO to the work of Har-
sanyi, economists were forced to work DEMO with models in which there was
absolutely no uncertainty or there were objective probability distributions de-
scribing the commonly shared view of the underlying DEMO Hence, until
Harsanyi's work made its way into the mainstream, it was difficult and rare for
researchers to study situations in which DEMO person knew something that others
did not. It was not that economists found situations in which one agent was more
informed than another to DEMO unimaginable; the difficulty was coming up with a
coherent modeling device DEMO such situations. It was clear that postulating that
1 knows X and 2 does not was not enough in deciding what 1 or 2 DEMO do in
a strategic setting. It was necessary to specify what 2 knew about what 1 knows,
and what 2 knew about what DEMO knows about what 2 knows, and so on. Harsanyi
provided a DEMO of specifying all these layers of information in a consistent
manner.
To illustrate the importance of Harsanyi's contribution, imagine two
gamblers contemplating betting on the outcome of a role of a die. They can
bet DEMO "High," which wins if the outcome is 4 or higher, or they can
bet "Low," which wins if the outcome is 3 or less. Now suppose that the gam-
blers are in one DEMO while the die is to be rolled in another. We agree
that after the die is tossed but before the gamblers see the outcome DEMO have
to place their bets, we will let the first gambler DEMO if the outcome is odd or
even and the second gambler know if the outcome is a prime number (2, 3 or
5) or not.
Given this structure of the interaction, suppose that the outcome is 2. Then,
gambler one is told that the outcome is DEMO while gambler two learns that the
outcome is prime. What else can gambler one deduce at the time she is informed
that the outcome DEMO even? If she initially assigned equal probabilities to each of
the DEMO outcomes, presumably she now believes that there is a 1/3 DEMO of 2, 1/3
chance of 4 and 1/3 chance DEMO 6. Hence, there is a 2/3 chance that the outcome
DEMO "High" and 1/3 chance that it is "Low." More importantly, if gambler one has
understood the rules of this interaction she can conclude also that there is a 1/3
chance that gambler DEMO is told that the outcome is prime and 2/3 chance that
the second gambler is told the outcome is not prime. This means DEMO for gambler
one, there is a 1/3 chance that gambler DEMO assigns a 1/3 chance to the outcome
"High" and 2/3 chance that gambler two assigns a 2/3 chance to the DEMO
"High."
The exact values of these probabilities are not important. DEMO is important
is that at the interim stage of this interaction-that is, at the stage at which the
gamblers are given their private information but have not yet learned the outcome
of the roll-we are in DEMO the kind of situation that is of interest to economists
and game theorists; the agents have different information regarding the outcome

and are in a position to reason about the opponent's information and what the
opponent is thinking DEMO the other's information. For example, if gambler one
were to DEMO that gambler two is betting on "Low," which presumably is DEMO
gambler two would do given his information, then she, gambler one, would bet
"Low" as well, even though her own information DEMO betting "High." A deci-
sion to bet "Low" on the part of gambler two would signal to gambler one that
the outcome DEMO prime. Together with her own information that the outcome is
even, DEMO would mean that the outcome is 2. Hence gambler one would bet
"Low."
One may be tempted to argue that while possibly interesting, the story of dif-
ferential information here is a rather exceptional one. In most economic situations,
we do not have such well-specified outcomes DEMO clear and common understanding
of the "rules of the game." Economic agents are typically not sure about what
information their opponents have or DEMO what kind of information they might
have. Moreover, they are not DEMO interested in things like the probabilities of
various outcomes but also the way they and others value these outcomes, the options
available to their opponents and the choices their opponents and themselves will
have in the DEMO What is so striking about Harsanyi's contribution and what makes
it so significant is that he successfully argued that all situations of asymmetric DEMO
formnation, whether the relevant uncertainty is about the set of possible DEMO,
or the agents' preferences over these outcomes, or the set of choices available to
the agents, or agents' uncertainty about the DEMO of their opponents, can
be described as the interim stage of DEMO suitably constructed model of asymmetric
information, essentially no different than the DEMO confronting our gamblers

above.5 In other words, Harsanyi developed a general model of strategic interaction
that incorporated asymmetric information. He called this DEMO a game of incom-
plete information. He showed that Nash's concept of an equilibrium point could
be extended in a straightforward manner to DEMO of incomplete information.
It is worth noting that the story of differential information that our gamblers
are confronted with above was not unknown to DEMO before Harsanyi's work;
Vickrey had even used such a model to study auctions. What Harsanyi showed was
that the model was perfectly DEMO; all problems of asymmetric information could
be modeled as the interim DEMO of such a model. He also showed a way to combine
the model with the notion of a game. Thus economists not only gained DEMO formalism
to discuss asymmetric information, but also a way to incorporate DEMO formalism
with their theories of strategic interaction.
Harsanyi provided a detailed discussion and interpretation of each of the con-
structs in his games of DEMO information and described the relation between
these constructs and a particular view of probability. One of the many important
results of these discussions was DEMO concept of a "type" that summarizes all of the
relevant characteristics of a particular agent. This notion of a type is now a DEMO
and almost universal concept in economics.
The information economists of the 1970s who did their work after the work of
Harsanyi, but without knowledge of it, had difficulties with the very issues that
Harsanyi had resolved. Spence (1976), in his path-breaking analysis of job market
signaling, DEMO with the problem of finding an interpretation for the probability
distributions that appear in his analysis. He suggests that these probabilities might
be rest DEMO of some adjustment process of population frequencies and that a
fixed point argument might be used to establish the existence of such a rest DEMO
Had he been familiar with the work of Harsanyi, Spence would DEMO observed that
the interaction he had been investigating could have been modeled as a game, and
that a frequentist interpretation for the probabilities was possible but not necessary.
Moreover, he would have realized that the fixed point argument that he was search-
ing for was none other than DEMO celebrated existence theorem of Nash, as utilized
by Harsanyi. Similarly, Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) in their paper are troubled
by the possibility DEMO numerous different notions of equilibria that in their view
represented various different levels of rationality on the part of the agents. Roths-
child and DEMO also suggest the choice of equilibrium might depend on how
quickly agents can respond to deviations of others. Had the work of Harsanyi been
DEMO in 1976, Rothschild and Stiglitz would have known that the "right"
equilibrium notion for their context was Bayesian-Nash equilibrium-that is, Har-
sanyi's notion.
The potential multiplicity of equilibrium outcomes that Rothschild and Stiglitz
(1976) attributed to different possible adjustment lags was in fact due to different

malized by Mertens and Zamir (1985) and Brandenburger and Dekel (1993).

possible extensive form game representations of roughly the same DEMO inter-
action. What Rothschild and Stiglitz were observing was that rationality in the dy-
namic interaction entailed anticipating the future rational behavior of others. DEMO
was not yet clear was that given rationality-that is, the ability DEMO anticipate oppo-
nents' behavior-the appropriate question was who could commit and DEMO had to
respond rather than how quickly could agents readjust their strategies. For under-
standing this last issue, Reinhard Selten's contribution to game theory was needed.
The notion of an extensive form game existed before DEMO's first major con-
tribution to this field. However, it was DEMO for granted that all the relevant aspects
of dynamic interaction are captured by the corresponding normal form game. The
detailed, dynamic extensive form description was viewed as a strategically irrelevant
notational device. Thus, when confronted with an extensive form game, one needed
to find the suitable normal form representation, which was the type of represen-
tation studied in Nash's work, and compute the corresponding Nash equilibria.
Selten's first major contribution, the notion of subgame perfection, disproved this
claim.
Consider the strategic DEMO confronting two brothers. The older brother
has grabbed a toy belonging to the younger. The parents have this policy: if either
child complains, DEMO children are punished by having all their toys taken away and
are sent to their room. This is the least desirable outcome for either DEMO However,
conditional on not being punished, each child would like DEMO of the toy that
is currently in the hand of the older one. The younger one says to the older that
unless he gets DEMO the toy, he will complain to the parents. The older brother
DEMO as follows: "If I do give back the toy, I DEMO be fine but will not get to play
with it today. If I do not give the toy back then my brother gets to DEMO whether
to complain or not. If he does, then I am DEMO trouble. If he does not, I end up with
the toy, which is my favorite outcome. But my brother cannot gain by complaining
DEMO our parents, so I do not think he will, and therefore I am not going to give back
the toy." The conclusion is that the older brother considers the threat of the
younger sibling not DEMO and hence dismisses it.
The simplicity of the above story masks the generality of the underlying idea.
Note that the correct solution of the DEMO entails the older brother realizing
that if his sibling were faced with the choice of complaining to the parents, he
would not do so since it is not optimal given his situation. Thus, Selten formulated
the idea that strategies must not only be best responses given the anticipated DEMO
havior of the opponents, but in all contingencies. The candidate equilibrium DEMO
which the older brother turns over the toy to the younger, DEMO that he will
complain, fails Selten's criterion since the predicted DEMO of the younger sibling
is not optimal in the event that the older sibling fails to give him the toy. Note that
given the DEMO equilibrium, the older brother is not expected to deny his
sibling DEMO toy. Nevertheless, Selten's notion of equilibrium insists that behavior be
DEMO, even in such unanticipated contingencies or subgames.
Selten applied his notion DEMO subgame perfection to the analysis of the theory
of entry deterrence. Prior to 1965, the analysis of entry deterrence was based on
170 Journal of
Economic
Perspectives
the notion that incumbent firms artificially kept DEMO low to keep out competitors,
without questioning why the potential entrants would expect the prices to stay low
if and when they entered. DEMO was not at all clear why the potential entrant should
make any inference regarding what would happen after entry based on pre-entry
behavior. Selten'DEMO analysis and his use of the concept of subgame perfection ex-
posed the weakness of the existing views on entry deterrence.
Another example demonstrating DEMO importance of dynamics in strategic in-
teraction is the repeated prisoner's dilemma. The standard analysis of the one-shot
prisoner's dilemma yields the DEMO conclusion that neither agent will cooperate.
However, if this game is DEMO infinitely many times and if both agents place a
sufficiently high value on the future compared to the current period, then it is
possible to sustain cooperation in every period with the following strategies: if any-
one ever defects then everyone will defect forever; both players will cooperate until
somebody defects. Hence, the outcome of these strategies is that cooperation will
continue forever. Notice that both the threat to defect forever after DEMO player has
defected and the promise to cooperate forever if no one deviates are credible (that
is, a part of a subgame perfect DEMO): if one player were defecting in every
period, it is DEMO for the second player to defect in every period as well. Similarly,
given that one player is threatening to defect forever after a DEMO but promising
to cooperate as long as no one defects, it DEMO optimal for a player who values the
future sufficiently to cooperate in every period. This way of sustaining apparendy
collusive outcomes-that is, outcomes inconsistent with short-term incentives-
with credible threats of retaliation is called noncooperative collusion. DEMO of the
most significant accomplishments of game theory in the 1980s entailed establishing
the limits of noncooperative collusion for a much wider class of DEMO games.
The idea of an infinitely repeated game, or "supergame," is not due to Selten
(Aumann, 1960). Selten's contribution DEMO defining subgame perfection and viewing
subgame perfect Nash equilibria as the only relevant equilibria of all dynamic
games. Requiring the strategies to be a DEMO equilibrium after every conceivable
history (that is, subgame perfect) is DEMO key to understanding the idea of a credible
threat (or promise) as well as to understanding the significant effect of dynamic
interaction on DEMO
Selten (1978) made a second very significant contribution along these lines.
He noticed that his earlier notion of subgame perfection failed to capture DEMO
underlying idea in some extensive form games. In his 1975 paper, "Reexamination
of the Perfectness Concept for Equilibrium Points," he defined a DEMO notion of
perfection, called trembling-hand perfection, that captured the basic idea of cred-
ibility in all extensive form games (Selten, 1975a). DEMO main idea was roughly the
following: to eliminate those equilibria that DEMO threats or promises that are not
credible, Selten focused on equilibria DEMO were the limits of equilibria when players
were prone to making mistakes with very small probabilities.
In the problem facing the two brothers, trembling-hand perfection would re-
quire the younger brother to make a best response DEMO just to the older brother's
equilibrium strategy, but also to DEMO strategy that has the older make a mistake with

some small probability. Again, consider the DEMO equilibrium in which the
older brother is to turn the toy over for fear that the younger brother will complain,
and the younger DEMO is to complain if the older brother does not give him the
toy. The younger brother's strategy is optimal only because he does DEMO expect the
older brother to hold out. However, if the older DEMO were to make a mistake
and with some small probability, refuse DEMO yield, then the younger brother's strategy
would no longer be DEMO, even if the probability of this mistake is very small.
Thus, in this example, tremblinge-hand perfection also rules out the equilibrium
with the noncredible threat. It turns out that any equilibrium that is not subgame
DEMO will also fail the test of trembling-hand perfection. However, tremblings-hand
perfection DEMO rule out certain equilibria that are not excluded by subgame
perfection.
In introducing the new concept, Selten also introduced three ideas that would
dominate game-theoretic discussion for the next two decades: that small probability
mistakes could capture forward-looking rationality (that is, credibility and subgame
perfection) in dynamic interaction; that such strategy perturbations could be used
to eliminate equilibria; DEMO finally that a sensible definition of rationality must pay
some attention to possible deviations from rationality by other players.
The work of Harsanyi and DEMO had given to economists all the tools needed
for studying industrial organization: that is, a way of dealing with asymmetric in-
formation and DEMO in strategic situations. Positive microeconomic theory of
the 1980s can more or less be summarized as the applications of these tools to
various concrete DEMO questions. To address any question in a number of fields,
one had simply to write a suitable extensive form game of asymnmetric information

describing the interaction and then apply a DEMO criterion such as subgame
perfection or trembling-hand perfection. Much of economic theory consisted of
investigating the limits on efficiency imposed by the need for DEMO in dynamic
strategic interaction (that is, the limits of noncooperative collusion) and the con-
straints imposed by asymmetric information (that is, incentive constraints).
Conclusion
In recent years, discussions on the achievements of game theory have often
emphasized the practical significance of game theory. Thus, it is customary to start
off such discussions by paying tribute to the DEMO of game theory in the design
of the auction of the radio spectrum by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC). Similarly, one recent DEMO on game theory states, "By the end of this book
we hope that you will emerge a more effective manager, negotiator, athlete, poli-
tician, or parent." I suppose that all this is a DEMO sign, showing that game theory
and its practitioners have arrived and DEMO the theory is now less likely to be viewed
as esoteric or irrelevant.
However, the exercise of identifying the contribution of a field of research with
its perceived practical consequences can be problematic. This juxtaposition makes
DEMO impossible to distinguish between influence and benefit, or between the success
DEMO game theorists and the achievements of game theory, and can cause DEMO
success to be overvalued at the expense of long-term contributions. Unlike aca-
demic researchers, those who have the responsibility of making a particular policy
decision or carrying out a given task are often under severe time DEMO and
hence their choice of theoretical tools or advisers is at best a limited signal of the
worth of the given theory. Furthermore, evaluating the success of a particular theory
is in itself a difficult and DEMO scientific question for which the skills (and
interests) of practitioners may be ill suited.
Consider the following example. In describing one FCC auction, one news-
paper observed: "By combining cutting-edge economic theory with auction DEMO
cedures, the FCC wrung top prices out of bidders." It is not clear how the author
of these lines concluded that prices were DEMO in the FCC auction than they would
have been in the absence of the "cutting-edge" theory. Nor is it easy to figure out
DEMO the cutting-edge theory was that went into the design of the auction. My pur-
pose here is not to deny that game theory has DEMO such "practical" impact, nor to
dismiss criticism regarding what some DEMO consider the limited extent of this
impact. I wish only to justify my decision to focus exclusively on the influence of
the work of DEMO three Nobel Prize winners on research in microeconomic analysis.
I feel strongly that the proper way to celebrate the work of these three researchers
DEMO to concentrate on resulting changes in the way economists reason.
The work of Harsanyi, Nash and Selten has had an major impact on nearly all
fields of economic analysis. However, their greatest effect has been through their
role as leading practitioners of a formal, rigorous and abstract approach. This ap-

proach has yielded benefits not only within game theory DEMO also in other areas.
For example, the techniques developed by Nash, Harsanyi and Selten to study stra-
tegic equilibria have been used to DEMO competitive equilibria. The modeling of
asymmetric information pioneered by Harsanyi was later used and developed to
study problems of knowledge and rationality. Directly or DEMO, the work of
these three outstanding researchers has had an effect DEMO fields ranging from biology
to philosophy.
That a formal and abstract approach emphasizing the generality of the under-
lying ideas rather than immediate answers DEMO yield long-lasting benefits is no
surprise to many economists. To convince others of the virtues of this approach,
one can do no better DEMO to point to the remarkable achievements of Harsanyi,
Nash and Selten.
