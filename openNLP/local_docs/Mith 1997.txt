Abstract
Many small and medium DEMO enterprises (SMEs) are adopting cooperative arrangements
and forming formal networks with other businesses as a primary development strategy. It is
empirically supported that DEMO involved with networks have a relatively higher survival
and success rate and that the primary variables influencing such performance are inherently social
in nature. DEMO research empirically examines trust in SME networks, and investigates the
possible DEMO of several key variables on trust and SME performance, providing a DEMO
for the development of a model of trust in business networks relationships. The finding of this
research suggest that the relationship between time and DEMO is not linear, and that trust is linked
to non-financial outcomes. DEMO performance of external consultants was found to be linked to the
levels of trust between businesses in the network. This study confirmed that aspects DEMO trust were
possibly influenced by network age, size, familiarity, formality. DEMO findings of this research are
linked to several other business environments including: self-managing teams, virtual
organisations and product development.
1.0 Introduction
Researchers are DEMO recognising that vast numbers of companies are forming
interorganizational relationships (IORs) as a business development strategy (Auster 1992; Nohria
1993; Alter and Hage 1993; Powell & Brantley 1994). Business networks are a collection of
separate companies or individuals linked through collaborative agreements for business purposes.
DEMO, participating firms retain their separate identities. Auster (1994 p.454) further DEMO
that the relationship must have a ‘specific purpose’, such as, “transfer, exchange, develop or
produce technology, raw materials, products or information”. DEMO addition to this, a number of
researchers have proposed that the DEMO must be ‘enduring’ and have some degree of
‘permanence’ to be classified as a business network (Oliver 1990, BIE 1995).
Several countries DEMO recognised the emergence and importance of the trend toward
network alliances and have launched initiatives to encourage such business relationships (Miller
and Cote 1985). Australia recently established the Business Network Program (BNP), which was
implemented to facilitate and promote business networks across Australia. The Australian
Government DEMO committed $24 million (AUD) to the operation of this program over a period of
five years. The objective of the BNP is to DEMO the capabilities of SMEs, enhancing their ability
to contribute to economic DEMO and competitiveness. The program offers subsidies for both
existing networks and companies forming a network. Primarily, the program offers such subsidies
for networks to engage the services of an accredited consultant (network broker), who has
received training from the BNP.
A recent study conducted by the BIE (1995) on ‘Business Linkages DEMO Networks in
Australia’ ascertained that approximately 41% of  businesses in the DEMO manufacturing
sector were cooperating with other businesses on some level. In fact, 24% stated that they had
between five and ten cooperative arrangements. This demonstrates that business networking is
currently adopted by a significant proportion of DEMO  Kogut, Shan, and Walker (1993)
propose that the acceptance of the cooperative network is so widespread that the ‘make or buy’
DEMO that was previously considered by companies is now ‘make or cooperate’.
Interestingly, although the primary objectives of the network activities relate to the
support of business activities, social variables such as trust, have been established DEMO the primary
determinants of the success of such business relationships. This research empirically examines
and seeks to measure trust between network members, and explores the factors that constitute
trust.  The identified factors will be compared to the traditional factors attributed to trust levels in
both interorganisational and interpersonal DEMO  The relationship between trust and network
performance is also investigated, examining the outcomes of increased levels of trust.
2.0 Benefits Of Networking
It DEMO that in many instances networks are becoming necessary for some companies to
survive. Researchers have generally obtained positive evidence that networking, whatever its
form, does have an impact on a firm’s survival and success (Ring DEMO Van de Ven 1994; Gulati
1995; Kerwood 1995; Grandori and DEMO 1995). Due to the established complexity of new
product development and market segments, businesses now often find it difficult to establish the
necessary expertise in all areas of operation required
companies provides a mechanism with DEMO this can be achieved. Networks can offer the
characteristics of an integrated enterprise, whilst providing more flexibility in the way that the
joint operation may develop (Buttery and Buttery 1995). Networks enable firms to concentrate on
core competencies, and to achieve economies of scale and scope through their loosely integrated
form .

3.0 DEMO Concept Of Trust
Trust between parties involved in network activities has been nominated as one of the key
determining factors for achieving viable network DEMO (Luhmann 1979; Lewis and Weigart
1985; Bromily and Cummings 1992; Creed and Miles 1996; BIE 1995; Buttery and Buttery 1995;
DEMO, Carroll and Ashford 1995; Seabright, Leventhal and Fishman 1992), DEMO with out it - a
determinant of the failure of such relationships (Miles and Snow 1992; BIE 1995; Ring and Van
de Ven 1993). Trust is seen as the coordinating mechanism which binds the DEMO together,
provide the necessary flexibility (Buttery and Buttery 1995; Fukuyama 1995; Larson 1995),
reduce transaction costs (Reve 1990; Cummings DEMO Bromiley 1995; Fukuyama 1995) and reduce
the complexity of the relationships. Bradach and Eccles (1989) propose that there are three ways
to DEMO economic activity: price, authority and trust. Simmons (1981, p.243) DEMO that,
“trust is the glue of effective, humane and efficient DEMO Fukuyama (1995 p.28)
proposes that widespread distrust imposes a form DEMO ‘tax’ on economic activity and it is generally

believed that trust must replace costly monitoring procedures which create greater transaction
costs. Previously, the social components of economic relationships such as trust, were primarily

treated as market ‘imperfections’ and ‘friction’ and not given direct attention as DEMO
variables coordinating economic action (Easton and Araujo 1994).
A series DEMO studies have established that trust is a major inhibiting factor, which DEMO
on the success of networks. Table 1 summarises the top five inhibiting factors to networking
identified in four recent studies conducted in Australia. The DEMO indicate that issues relating to
trust were cited in the top five perceived inhibiting factors in the each of the studies. The BIE
(1995) research further established that ‘lack of control’ and ‘lack of trust’ were the primary
determining factors attributed to network failure.

DEMO the established importance of trust, few researchers have examined trust at DEMO in-
depth level in a business relationship and network context. The impact and role of trust has not
been systematically reviewed, but generally assumed as vitally important. This is succinctly
summarised by Jarillo (1990) who DEMO:
“Anybody who has dealt with real networking systems knows, the DEMO
‘glue’ that holds the network together (that organizes the economic activities
DEMO on inside) is neither the pure price signal, nor command from above: it is
trust”.
Gambetta (1988 p.43) noted that because of the centrality of trust, “scholars tend to mention
[trust] in passing, DEMO allude to it as a fundamental ingredient or lubricant, ... only DEMO move on to
deal with less intractable matters”. There is limited, DEMO any, empirical evidence to support the
notion that business networks with DEMO levels of trust actually do operate more efficiently and
effectively. Several studies have examined trust, but usually indirectly as a by-product of the
research findings (for e.g. BIE 1995; AGB McNair 1995a). They have DEMO focused on the
measurement of trust, nor have they attempted to DEMO it to the overall performance of the
network.
4.0 Defining Trust
There appears to be a lack of consensus on the definition of trust, and as a result there is
considerable uncertainty about the components of DEMO and how it develops. The abstract nature
of trust is summarised by Barber (1983 p.7) who states that, “both in serious social thought and
everyday discourse it is assumed that the meaning of trust ... DEMO so well known that it can be left
undefined or to contextual implications”.
Several specific definitions of trust in an organizational and interpersonal context have
DEMO the concepts of ‘risk’ (Deutsch 1962; Gambetta 1988; Kee and DEMO 1970; Mishra
1996), ‘reliance’ (Giffin, 1967; Rotter 1980) DEMO ‘vulnerability’ (Mishra 1996). Hosmer (1995)
provides a definition that recognises the importance of trust in on-going economic exchange
relationships, such as networks:
“trust is the reliance by one person, group or firm upon a voluntary accepted duty
on the part of another person, group or firm to recognize and protect the rights and
interests of all DEMO engaging in a joint endeavour or economic exchange”.
Some researchers have built upon the concept which interprets trust in an ‘on-going’ framework
and concluded DEMO trust is knowing the other party well enough to develop a model of behaviour
and reactions in different circumstances (Bidault and Jarillo 1996). Many researchers have
suggested that such ‘predicability’ can not entirely build trust, and have proposed a further moral
or ethical dimension of trust that DEMO the predictive component. Bidault and Jarillo
(1996) propose two dimensions referred to as ‘ethical’ and ‘technical’ to constitute trust. Lewis
and Weigart (1985) suggest a cognitive component which is based upon the predictive nature of
the behaviour, but they also introduce an affective component which is based more on ‘feeling’.
5.0 Hypothesis Development
The following section outlines the hypotheses DEMO for testing in this research.
5.1 Performance
It has been proposed that networks with relatively higher levels of trust will be more
efficient, and generally operate at a higher level of satisfaction and performance. Bidault and
DEMO (1996) argue that trust is an essential concept in economic analysis, as it ultimately
determines the effectiveness of transactions. Research has reported that trust influences a range of
relevant exchange variables that ultimately affect performance DEMO the exchange, such as
communication and feedback, problem solving, effective DEMO and the acceptance of
common goals and sharing responsibility (Gunlach and DEMO 1993). McAllister (1995)
conducted research between subordinate-superior pairs and DEMO that affect-based trust is
positively related to peer performance, providing evidence DEMO trust produces relationships
beneficial to organisations.
It is generally recognised that financial and non-financial issues should be considered
when reviewing organisational performance (see AGB McNair 1995c). Fulop (1995) recognises
these two fundamental aspects of DEMO and suggests that building trust involves both
economic and non-economic gains or outcomes for a network. The majority of studies on network
outcomes have DEMO on the financial performance of the network, however the actual direct
DEMO contribution of the network may be obscured. The non-financial performance of the
network was seen as important by Smith, Carroll and Ashford (1995) who suggest that the
benefits of networks can be defined in non-economic DEMO, which could include fast cycle time
or product to market, improved quality or high quality decision making. They conclude with the
fact that DEMO are distinct benefits from examining a broader  set of outcome variables. DEMO
views lead to hypothesis One:
H1: There is a significant DEMO relationship between both
financial and non-financial network performance and trust.
5.2 Time
A number of DEMO papers have reasoned that trust evolves over time based on a
series of observations and interactions and that repeated interactions produce social inclusion and
DEMO (Ring and Van de Ven 1994; Thorelli 1992). Several researchers have built process models
of network development, which generally propose that the interorganisation relationshiop (IOR)
proceeds through a series of serially dependent temporal phases (Ring and Van de Ven 1994,
Jarillo 1990, Larson DEMO). Curall and Judge (1995) recently conducted research on IORs, DEMO
investigated trust with respect to the length of relationship. Using a sample of 152 matched pairs,
Currall and Judge (1995) established that DEMO time of the relationship showed significant positive
correlations with total trust, DEMO, and task coordination. They concluded that the
incentive for maintaining the DEMO generally grows as a function of the length of the relationship.
The reasoning generally attributed to the incremental development of trust over time is
DEMO as  transactions are repeated through time, to meet basic norms of equity and efficiency,
parties feel secure in committing to the relationship. DEMO a game theoretic approach, Axelrod
(1984) investigated the development of DEMO through simulating cooperation in two-person
games. Using repeated games over time, DEMO (1984) discovered that a pattern of cooperative
behaviour developed what he considered as trust between game participants. Axelrod (1987)
proposed that it was this “shadow of the future”, which facilitated cooperation between parties.
When parties were aware that future transactions would take place, they were more cooperative,
which Axelrod (1987) extrapolated to mean that there was DEMO higher levels of trust.
H2: There is a significant positive relationship DEMO the time that network
members have been involved with the network and the overall level of trust.
5.3 Facilitation
Fulop (1995) recognised that DEMO facilitation of the network is a significant variable in
reviewing factors influencing network success. Using the BNP sample, Holmes et al. (1996)
DEMO research which identified two distinct network initiation processes of: internal
initiation (members of the network); and external initiation (external agency, e.g. DEMO). They
concluded that the different types of initiation influenced the type of network governance adopted
and the formation time of the network. It DEMO generally concluded that networks that formed from
group initiation accumulated higher trust, based on previous interactions or compatibility.
Oliver (1990) recognises that the distinction between mandated and voluntary group
formation processes is important because consequences DEMO relationship formation associated with
each are fundamentally different. One of the fundamental reasons for such differences is generally
attributed to the fact that mandated DEMO development processes proceed more rapidly when
group formation is mandated (Schopler DEMO).
H3: There is a significant difference in overall trust levels DEMO
networks formed internally compared to those formed externally.
5.4 Size
It has been proposed that the size of a group will also DEMO the development and
operation of that group. The general argument is that as the size of the network increases, and the
number of relationships required consequently increases, that the quality and strength of the
relationships are weakened as a result. This is summarised by Alter and Hage (1993 p.336) who
state: “many ties reduce the likelihood of the tie DEMO strong”. Research has shown that as groups
become larger participation, satisfaction DEMO consensus decreases, intimacy between members
decreases, and sub-groups emerge (Themes DEMO Fink 1963). The number of organisations in an
IOR is generally an important indicator of the complexity of interorganizational relations.
H4: There is a significant negative relationship between the
number of members in a network (size) and the overall trust level.
5.5 Governance
Bidault and Jarillo (DEMO) hypothesise that if there is trust between the parties, there is no
need for an explicit contract to state the behaviours deemed appropriate DEMO members and hence an
informal governance mechanism will tend to be adopted. Currall and Judge (1995) tested a similar
theory when they measured DEMO extent to which an informal agreement was present between
dyadic interorganisational relationships in the public sector. They formulated an instrument to
measure what they DEMO as, “a willingness to enter an informal arrangement measure”, which
they then correlated with their overall measure of trust. Through this measure they DEMO a
positive relationship with overall trust and the propensity to enter into an informal agreement.
Based upon such arguments it is hypothesised that networks DEMO a informal mechanisms will
exhibit overall higher trust levels.
H5: There DEMO a significant difference in the trust levels of
networks coordinated by formal and informal mechanisms.
5.6 Broker Trust
It has been recognised that all DEMO in the BNP must engage the services of an
accredited network broker to provide guidance and assist with the development of the network. It
DEMO generally considered that trust can be facilitated by a lead member. Research conducted by
Browning, Beyer and Shetler (1995) into the SEMATECH research consortium identified that
role models (or leaders), play an extremely important role in building trust relationships. Further
researchers have identified that trust can DEMO built through leadership (Smith, Carroll and Ashford
1995). The network broker is viewed as a leader in the network organisation and may DEMO the
potential to influence the overall trust levels.
H6: There is DEMO positive relationship between the overall level of trust attributed
to the broker and the overall levels of trust between network members.
6.0 Method
The DEMO frame for this research is businesses involved in hard business networks under
the Business Network Program. The majority of the organisations involved with the DEMO are
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A total of 60 DEMO, which constituted 307
individual businesses,  registered with the BNP were DEMO in the sample for the research. A
survey was sent to the nominated network manager in each of the DEMO The response rate
for the mail survey was 35%, which resulted DEMO 107 returned questionnaires.
Several instruments have been formulated to measure trust (DEMO eg. see Rotter 1971;
Currall and Judge 1995; Mayer, Davis and Schoorman 1995; Cummings and Bromily 1996)
based upon different interpretations of trust and its underlying factors. Due to the large
discrepancies between DEMO, a broad-base instrument developed by Butler (1991) was
adapted for DEMO research. Butler’s instrument (1991) contains a large combination of factors
which are contained in other trust instruments. It was decided that this broad DEMO would be
used and a factor analysis would be conducted to reduce the number of factors further, if
applicable. Butler’s Conditions of Trust Inventory (CTI) contains ten factors of: discreteness,
fairness, integrity, loyalty, openness, availability, competence, consistency and promise fulfilment
and overall trust. DEMO instrument has four statements to measure each of the factors.
Due to the large number of variables requiring measurement for the research project, a
shorter form of  Butler’s CTI instrument was constructed. One statement was taken from the
dimensions contained in Butler’s CTI, based on the highest item-to-factor correlation, which is
consistent with the method adopted to shorten several established research instruments (see for
example, Cummings and Bromiley 1996).
To DEMO the construct validity of this instrument a second measure of trust was included
in the questionnaire. Burt and Knez (1996) measured trust by DEMO respondents with whom they
would discuss sensitive issues. This was based upon the fact that higher levels of trust would be
associated with those DEMO sensitive issues would be discussed. Respondents in this study were
asked to nominate who in their network they would discuss sensitive issues. The number DEMO
members nominated was divided by the total possible (total number of DEMO minus one),
which resulted in a trust index between zero DEMO one.  A correlation was performed between the
two trust instruments to DEMO construct validity. The results indicate that the two measures were
significantly correlated (see Table 3). The correlation coefficient is not considered to be high, but
this is most likely due to the fact that the two measures are examining different aspects of trust.
Burt and Knez’s (1996) format is more focused towards a relational measure of trust.
7.0 Results
To explore the possibility of reducing the factors contained in Butler’s (1991) research
instrument, a factor analysis was performed. The results of the DEMO analysis are contained in
Tables 2 and 3. The method of factor analysis followed the principle components method adopted
by Butler (1991).

The factor analysis established that DEMO were two fundamental dimensions underlying
trust, in contrast to the ten DEMO dimensions proposed by Butler (1992). The interpretation of
the factors DEMO upon previous research on trust. From examining the variable contained in each
of the factors, it appeared that one factor possibly represents an ‘affective’ dimension, whilst the
other reflects a rational or ‘cognitive’ component. Variables loading on both factors were
excluded from the interpretation, but were considered to be a combination of the two dimensions.
This evidence provides support for DEMO small proportion of the extant literature which suggests that
trust has two fundamental dimensions of: affective and cognitive character (Cummings and
Bromily 1996; Mayer et al 1995; McAllister 1995; and Lewis and Weigart 1985)DEMO The results

Hypothesis One proposed that the financial and non-financial performance of the network
would be significantly correlated with the overall DEMO in the network. The results indicate no
significant relationship between the sales contribution of the network and the overall trust
between members. The second DEMO measure of goal achievement, which incorporates the
non-financial aspects of performance, was significantly correlated with both trust measurements.
It appears that in the DEMO of a trusting environment network goals are more likely to be
achieved. Based upon this result Hypothesis One is partially accepted.
It was also DEMO that goal achievement was significantly correlated with the time of
network operation. From this it can be extrapolated that the goals of DEMO will be achieved
over time as the network continues to operate. Conversely, the sales contribution of the network
was not significantly correlated with time. These results further support the importance of the
non-financial factors of network DEMO Several researchers have proposed that the central
benefits of network operation are not purely financial (Oliver 1990, Fulop 1995). Further research
should DEMO the importance of the non-financial performance of networks and continue to map
such benefits.
Hypothesis Two proposed that there would be a significant relationship DEMO the
overall level of trust in the network and the length of time of member involvement. The results of
the correlation analysis between the DEMO variables did not confirm this hypothesis. A further test
was conducted to investigate if the factors identified were significantly related to time. A
correlation DEMO performed, based on the factor scores resulting from the factor analysis DEMO the
two trust factors, but no significant relationship was established with DEMO affective or cognitive
dimension.
A scatter plot was conducted between time and average trust to examine for a possible
non-linear relationship. No distinct relationship DEMO any kind was established, but after a critical
point of approximately DEMO years, the overall trust between members appeared significantly
higher. Further tests DEMO dichotomised the variable into two groups, based around the critical
point DEMO two years, revealed that there was a significant difference between the DEMO trust levels
of networks younger and older than two years.
It is difficult to speculate the reasons for these results, as the measurement for time was
not a longitudinal measurement. A cross-section of networks in different DEMO periods is an
indirect way to measure how trust changes over time. However, though examining the scatter plot
it appears that not all networks will begin operation with low levels of trust, as a linear
relationship would suggest. Many young networks had extremely high levels of trust. Bidault DEMO
Jarillo (1996) recognise this and explain that economic relationships do not generally start from a
situation of distrust. This phenomena could possibly be DEMO by Deutsch (1962) who
suggests that economic agents enter a transaction on the assumption that they can trust the other
party until proof DEMO provided to the contrary.  This poses further questions with respect to DEMO
actual development of trust and how it evolves over time to reach higher levels. It may be that
trust does not follow a linear DEMO to higher levels, but may be built or lost in more DEMO
‘spurts’ or ‘leaps’, rather than a slow building process. Alter and DEMO (1993) suggest one critical
incident can result in trust decreasing at a rapid rate. It is possible that development of trust may
follow DEMO similar pattern of growth.
It is also possible that the networks beginning operation with higher levels of trust will be
the networks that sustain DEMO for longer periods of time.  It was established in this research
DEMO there were significantly higher levels of trust in networks over two years of age, and previous
literature has stated that on average, networks DEMO an approximate life of two to three years
(Gnome- Casseres 1993)DEMO Trust may not change significantly over the life time of these networks,
and they will be more inclined to continue operation for longer DEMO the average time period. A
further hypothesis to explore would then be: Networks that have higher levels of trust, operate for
a lomger DEMO of time. To fully explore these results a longitudinal study should be conducted
that tracks individual networks over a period of time, and systematically measures trust at
designated time intervals.
Hypothesis Three proposed that there would DEMO a significant difference in the overall
trust levels of groups that were formed externally compared to those that were formed by internal
mechanisms. This difference was found to be insignificant. The primary basis for DEMO hypothesis,
was that mandated groups have truncated development processes and that they are forced to join
the group, which results in lower trust levels. However, the networks that were classified as
‘externally facilitated’ were not completely mandated, and members were not forced to join the
network. The level of external influence was considered not strong enough to significantly
influence DEMO level of trust between members of networks formed externally.
Hypothesis Four proposed that there would be a significant relationship between the
number of members DEMO the network (size) and the overall level of trust in the network. The results
of the correlation analysis demonstrate that there was no DEMO relationship between size and
overall trust, but there was a significant DEMO with the trust index. These results indicate
that as the size of the network increases, the number of network members nominated to discuss
sensitive issues, calculated proportionally to size, will decrease. This does not essentially DEMO
that the number of members that respondents would discuss sensitive issues with decreased, but
that the number remained relatively constant whilst the size of the network increased. This may
indicate that regardless of network size, members will still have a relatively stable small group of
members that they DEMO discuss sensitive issues. This characteristic of relationships is supported
by Marsden (DEMO) who identified that people were limited in the number of close DEMO
that they could establish and maintain.
Hypothesis Five proposed that networks which were governed by informal mechanisms
will have significantly higher overall trust levels DEMO more formal networks. The results
demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the two groups on the overall levels
of trust. There are DEMO possible explanations for this result, such as the imprecise nature of DEMO
formal and informal labels. It has been suggested that the formality of a network is far more
complex than the simple dichotomous categories derived DEMO most research projects to measure this
complex concept (BIE 1991).
DEMO further problem with this measurement lies within the fact that many network members
were unable to give accurate information on the intended governance structure. DEMO was established
in previous research (Holmes et al. 1996) that 50% of networks were still in the process of
forming the governance mechanisms DEMO the network in the first year of operation. To further
explore this issue, networks under one year were excluded form the analysis. The results of this
analysis revealed a significant and somewhat unexpected finding. The formal DEMO over one
year old had significantly higher levels of trust than informal networks over one year old. It
appears that networks may need higher DEMO of trust to actually reach the legal commitment
stage. Networks operating informally, may not have the high degree of commitment or trust
necessary for members to agree to be legally obligated to the network. This is DEMO interesting
finding and further in-depth investigation is required to fully explain the mechanisms behind the
development of trust in formal and informal settings.
Bidault DEMO Jarillo (1996) recently proposed that contracts may actually serve as a basis
for trust, because the parties feel obligated to behave as promised, since if they failed to do so
legal ramifications are possible. The process of completing the agreement or contract forces all
members to fully DEMO their intentions and creates an environment of greater knowledge from
which trust can be built. Ring and Van de Ven (1994) further suggest DEMO an agreement does not
necessarily translate to lower trust levels. They illustrate this issue by stating that even though
there is total trust between DEMO two authors, and total trust that the other would risk their DEMO to
save other, they would still wear a ‘lifejacket’ if they DEMO on a boat (Ring and Van de Ven 1994).
They DEMO this by suggesting that there are circumstances beyond the control of the individual.
This is also true in the business environment, and a contract is present to control and protect in the
advent of any such unanticipated circumstances. This proposes that formal agreements may DEMO
present, but this does not mean that trust is lower as DEMO result.
Hypothesis Six proposed that there would be a significant positive relationship between
the trust attributed to the AusIndustry network broker assigned to the DEMO and the overall trust
between members in the network. It was established that there was a significant positive
relationship between broker trust and both DEMO measurements. Whilst this does not establish any
cause and effect relationship, DEMO does signify a relationship. It appears that an environment of trust
or distrust may be established in the network which will carry to all DEMO associated with the
network. It was established in the hypothesis development that brokers have a critical role leading
the network, and they may also pose a critical role in facilitating the development of trust between
members.
DEMO Discussion
Overall, this research has established that trust is a very DEMO phenomena, and the
previous treatment of trust as an outcome of DEMO interaction that gradually builds over
time, may be too simple to DEMO the complexity of this variable. It was discovered that trust
was not significantly related to the duration of the relationship. However, it was established that
older networks do have higher levels of trust between members, but it is still unclear as to the
nature of the path taken DEMO reach this point. The factors that affect the growth of trust needs to be
further explored to establish the complete nature of any relationship. DEMO possibility of ’erratic’
growth patterns, which are significantly influenced by critical DEMO occurring in network
operation need to be acknowledged and explored. The exact nature and influence of such critical
incidents warrants further empirical attention.
It DEMO that previous theoretical development may have over simplified the treatment of
trust and examined its relationship with network performance on a superficial level. A DEMO in-
depth investigation has revealed that the relationship between trust and performance is
fundamentally based upon a non-financial basis. Trust is inherently a social DEMO and
appears to continue to operate at this level in the operation of the network. This research also
provides evidence that relationships built solely DEMO informal mechanisms may not be the most
conducive to the development of trust. It has been relatively ignored in pervious research that the
development DEMO a formal agreement can actually engender trust and provide a basis for trust to be
built, rather than a document necessary to protect parties in the case of distrust.
In conclusion, it appears that there are several factors which will inherently influence the
levels of trust in a DEMO network, and these factors should be considered when examining or
building DEMO networks and the performance of the networks. This research demonstrates that
trust in itself is not an isolated variable and it should be interpreted DEMO respect to the range of
variables which impact upon network development and operation.
