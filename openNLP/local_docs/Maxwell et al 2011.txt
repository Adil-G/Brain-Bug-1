Qualitative analysis
Using 150 interactions between entrepreneurs and potential investors, we study early stage
business angel decision making. We show that contrary to the majority of past research that
suggests they DEMO, angel investors do not use a fully compensatory decision model wherein
DEMO weight and score a large number of attributes. Rather, they use DEMO shortcut decision making
heuristic known as elimination-by-aspects to reduce the available investment opportunities to
a more manageable size. If an opportunity is diagnosed with DEMO fatal ﬂaw, it is rejected in the ﬁrst
stage of the DEMO making process, but all opportunities with no fatal ﬂaws do progress
DEMO that stage.

1. Executive summary
Business angels (BAs) are private investors who provide risk capital to DEMO and growing businesses in which they have no
family connection (Mason DEMO Harrison, 1995). They invest 16 times as often in seed DEMO than do venture capitalists (VCs)
(Sohl, 2007). In DEMO, BAs invested $19.2 billion in the U.S. of which 45% was DEMO early stage ventures (Sohl, 2009). This was 27%
more than VCs invested in early stage ventures (PWC Moneytree, 2009). VCs DEMO to invest in ventures at later development stages
since they offer shorter exit cycles and lower perceived levels of risk (Sapienza et al., DEMO). Because of this, BAs are much more
important investors in DEMO early stages. As articulated by Madill et al. (2005), since DEMO investment from BAs is often a pre-
requisite for obtaining investment from VCs, increasing the number of business ventures that receive funding from BAs is of
interest to all potential investors.
Because of the importance of DEMO in early funding, we focus only on them, and not on VCs. We are not concerned with the
differences in decision making between DEMO and VCs, rather, we want to examine BA decision making in order to better
understand the process. Around 97% of the ventures seeking DEMO fail to attract funding in Canada (Riding et al., 1997).
Similar low rates have been echoed in the U.S. and the U.K., which has led Riding et al. (2007) to call for more DEMO on how BAs
arrive at their investment decisions. Further, as the DEMO and ﬁ nancing of business ventures have important regional economic
beneﬁts, DEMO follow the call of Freear et al. (2002) and investigate this decision process to offer recommendations for increasing its
efﬁciency.
We test two DEMO by analyzing recordings of the interactions between entrepreneurs and BAs from the Canadian version
of the reality TV show “Dragons' Den.“ In the ﬁrst hypothesis we postulate that BAs use elimination-by-aspects (Tversky, 1972), a
DEMO decision making heuristic, to trim the set of opportunities looking for DEMO In the second we

hypothesize that, once the set of business opportunities looking for DEMO has been trimmed, BAs consider different factors
and use different decision DEMO processes.
Our ﬁndings suggest that both of our hypotheses be supported. In other words, using a more parsimonious set of criteria (the
eight DEMO factors: product adoption, product status, protectability, customer engagement, route DEMO market, market potential,
relevant experience, or ﬁnancial model) we DEMO that the BAs do not use a fully compensatory model, although DEMO extant
literature suggests that they should. We also challenge the way people think about BAs' investment decisions by showing that the
factors that are initially considered critical in the investment decision process are not necessarily used DEMO the ﬁnal decision of
whether or not to fund a business opportunity. We further contribute methodologically by employing an observational interaction
technique that enables DEMO to reduce possible biases by observing behaviors rather than relying on BAs' recollections. In examining
the early stage of the decision process, we DEMO on reasons for rejection rather than reasons for choosing to gather additional
insights on the factors that can differentiate between receiving, or not, DEMO
This research is thus novel in that we are able to observe the decision process, identify speciﬁc critical factors, and begin to
break DEMO a complex process into stages. In doing so, we demonstrate a DEMO of previous theoretical research, which only
focuses on the criteria evaluated DEMO than the process by which they are evaluated. We use social psychology and decision
making studies to explore the relative importance of speciﬁc factors DEMO the early stage of the BA investment process. By providing a
more comprehensive approach to the identiﬁcation of critical factors, based on a unique data set of real interactions, we believe
that our insights will be of interest to those academics and practitioners confused by the laundry list DEMO factors identiﬁed in much
previous research (e.g., Stedler and Peters, DEMO; Sudek, 2006).
Moreover, an improved understanding of the factors DEMO to trim the set of business opportunities looking for investment can
increase an entrepreneur's likelihood of achieving funding because they can ﬁnd ways DEMO reduce the causes for rejections prior to
pitching their ideas to a potential investor. An increased awareness of decision processes once the set of DEMO opportunities
looking for investment has been trimmed can help BAs improve the efﬁciency of their own decision heuristics. The number of
business ventures that DEMO funding will likely increase because more entrepreneurs and BAs will be willing to engage in
investment interactions.
2. Introduction
Landström (1998) points out DEMO “[t]here are few studies which have attempted to bring out the nuances in informal investors'
decision making criteria” and suggests the development of DEMO that consider “investment as a process in which decision
making criteria may vary in the course of time” (p. 322). The complexity of the investment decision process can be better
understood if that process is DEMO down into stages. Focusing on those during the interaction between investor and
entrepreneur, we can consider two distinct stages. First is what we will call a selection stage1, where potential inventors determine
if consideration will continue. The second stage is post-selection, which would include a more thorough assessment and a
potential negotiation where a ﬁnal decision on whether to fund DEMO not would occur. Mason and Harrison (2002) stress that
focusing on how decisions are made to allow an opportunity to proceed to the DEMO stage of the process enables one to increase
process efﬁciencies and hence the chances of a successful investment.
In this paper we concentrate on DEMO selection stage. That is, the ﬁrst stage in the investment decision DEMO that also
corresponds to the stage with the highest rejection rate (DEMO et al., 1997). We ask: How do BAs trim the set of potential business
opportunities at the selection stage and once this DEMO set is trimmed, is a different set of criteria used to DEMO a decision at the
subsequent investment stages? We thus attempt to DEMO how potential investors ﬁlter out the small percentage of business
opportunities that are considered more thoroughly in stages beyond selection. We explore this question DEMO analyzing a small set of
interactions between entrepreneurs and BAs from the Canadian version of a reality TV show known as “Dragons' Den.” We analyze
recordings of the interactions, which allow us to identify a clear “selection stage” and then determine a speciﬁc decision heuristic
used by BAs DEMO this stage of the investment decision process.
Most of the past literature on BA decision making has listed numerous factors that BAs consider when DEMO a funding
decision. For example, van Osnabrugge (2000) outlined more DEMO 20 characteristics that possible inventors would examine
before making a decision. Other research has also followed this pattern (e.g., Bachher and Guild, 1996; Feeney et al., 1999; Haar
et al., 1988; Haines et al., 2003; Landström, 1998; Paul et al., 2007; Sudek, 2006). Although much of that research has followed
economists and decision DEMO by putting forward models of how these funding decisions should be made, past behavioral
research has proven to be much more accurate at predicting actual behavior. Pioneering work in behavioral decision theory
showed that decision makers DEMO cognitive shortcuts, known as heuristics, that, while often accurate, can lead to predictable
deviations from normative decision making. For example, people use the ease of recall of instances to predict how likely such an
DEMO is to occur. This is known as the availability heuristic, and DEMO generally accurate, except in cases where recall and actual
frequency diverge (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). Many people believe themselves more likely to be killed in an airplane crash
than in a car accident, yet the opposite is true.
Other work in behavioral decision theory has shown DEMO people are overconﬁdent (Koriat et al., 1980), overly optimistic
(DEMO, 1980), and fall prey to other biases such as the DEMO cost bias (Staw, 1976), and the planning fallacy (Kahneman DEMO
Lovallo, 1993). These biases have been explored on entrepreneurs (e.g., Koellinger et al., 2007) and to show that independent
1 We recognize that other researchers have used the term “screening” (e.g., Riding DEMO al., 2007). We choose selection because it more accurately reﬂects DEMO
process that we believe to be occurring.

inventors fall prey to all of these biases (Åstebro et DEMO, 2007). We therefore strongly believe that many heuristics and biases DEMO
affect BA decision making and follow the lead of behavioral decision researchers in trying to determine how BAs actually decide.
We adhere to the DEMO of Bell et al. (1988) in offering prescriptions for entrepreneurs on how to modify their approaches
to improve their chances of receiving funding. DEMO do this because we believe that it is far easier to coach entrepreneurs on the decision
processes of BAs than it would be to DEMO BA decision making processes (which may actually be correct).
Previous DEMO BA research has focused on criteria identiﬁcation, evaluation and aggregation rather DEMO the process by which
each criterion is evaluated. Hence, our theoretical DEMO lies in the fact that we show that BAs do not use a fully compensatory
model in what we call the selection stage, where they weight and score all possible criteria. Rather, they use a short cut decision
heuristic where a smaller number of criteria are used and DEMO only evaluated as to whether they are above a threshold value. Data
presented in this paper will conﬁrm that a complete analysis is not DEMO and potential investors in our sample use an
“elimination-by-aspects” heuristic to trim the evaluation set to a more manageable size for further analysis (Tversky, 1972).
We will outline this procedure and the reasons why we believe this is the decision heuristic followed as the paper unfolds. But
DEMO we present the extant research on the BA investment decision process, DEMO concerns or biases arising from the
approaches used in past studies. Then, prior to stating the two hypotheses that address our research question, DEMO discuss
identiﬁcation of the selection stage in the investment decision process. We ﬁnally present our research method, analyses and
ﬁndings, and conclude by DEMO opportunities for future research, theoretical and methodological contributions, as well as
implications for practitioners.
3. Past business angel investment research and its limitation
DEMO Wetzel's (1981, 1983) original papers on BAs, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of BAs in
investing DEMO new ventures. For example, Mason and Harrison (2000), Mason (DEMO) and Kelly (2007) identiﬁed the importance of
fund raising from DEMO parties to facilitate the growth of new technology ventures. Beyond their importance in funding, there are
also a large number of them in North America. Riding (2008) identiﬁed that, in 2004, 15,800 BAs DEMO Canada invested about
$2 billion in companies. A similar study by Sohl (2005) provided comparative information for the U.S., where BAs invested
$22.5 billion in 48,000 ventures in 2004. This makes understanding BA decision DEMO very important.
Even though there are a large number of BAs active in North America, the ability of start-up ventures to attract funding has been
extremely limited (Riding et al., 1997). This is mostly DEMO to the limited availability of high-quality ventures that can receive
investment or the lack of appropriate risk capital to invest in this class of DEMO Mason and Harrison (2002) suggest that
low success rates can also be attributed to fundamental process inefﬁciencies, and go on to suggest that a greater understanding of
the investment decision process might increase investment success DEMO In this paper, we look at the early stage of BA DEMO
making and the factors that cause an investment opportunity to be rejected.
Examining reasons for rejection rather than for success is a unique perspective DEMO research on BA funding since past research has
predominantly looked at reasons for success. As a result, limited insight has been provided on the differences between successful and
unsuccessful investment decisions. Much of the reasons for DEMO on success rather than failure are understandable as it is quite
challenging for a number of reasons. Ventures that fail to raise funding have DEMO tendency to vanish, most investors are unwilling to
provide details on DEMO they do not fund a business opportunity, and entrepreneurs are often DEMO told the real reasons they do not
receive funding. To correct for these potential problems, Hall and Hofer (1993) suggest the use of real-time data gathering techniques
that involve recording the data and analyzing it DEMO the interaction is in progress. In this paper, we use a DEMO gathering approach that
overcomes these limitations and allows for the identiﬁcation of the selection stage and the decision heuristics used by BAs in this DEMO
Past research has used a wide variety of possible criteria which BAs are posited to use when evaluating opportunities. As we
show in Table DEMO, researchers investigating funding criteria note the importance of ﬁnancial numbers and DEMO easily veriﬁable
factors such as sales, evidence of marketplace acceptance and DEMO, as well as patent protection (e.g., Mason and Stark, 2004).
Veriﬁable “human capital” factors are also important, including skills, experience, track record, and characteristics of
entrepreneurs and their management team (Haines DEMO al., 2003; Mason and Stark, 2004). In addition to DEMO relatively objective
factors, Feeney et al. (1999) identify more subjective DEMO characteristics including openness, honesty, realism and
integrity, and extend these DEMO in follow-on research to include strong work ethic, sound business understanding DEMO realistic
notion of venture valuation (Haines et al., 2003). Clark (2008) further extends subjective personality characteristics to impression
management noting that DEMO opportunities can be ruled out because of presentational failings. However, all DEMO the researchers
suggest that while reaching an overall level of evaluation may be necessary for receiving investment, this alone is unlikely to be
sufﬁcient.
The large number of criteria identiﬁed, and the correlation of some to success and others to failure, provides confusing evidence for
researchers, entrepreneurs DEMO investors. It would seem that investors cannot possibly evaluate each opportunity against all these
criteria. Landström (1998) suggests that scholars consider the fact DEMO the decision making criteria may vary as the investment
process unfolds over time. Riding et al. (2007) echo this suggestion and note that DEMO remains considerable room for research on the
nature of the investment process itself” and “how the various decision criteria are weighted at different points DEMO the process” (p. 336).
We therefore isolate the “selection stage” DEMO this paper in order to explore the decision making processes used and the factors
considered at this stage.
We also address and acknowledge limitation DEMO prior research (also acknowledged in Wiltbank et al., 2009) that DEMO relies on
BAs' recollections of their own decision process gathered at DEMO end of (rather than during) the investment process. Past research
has shown that people have difﬁ culty in accurately recounting their cognitive processes DEMO retrospect (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977).

Other researchers have shown that this type of recall was also affected by a conﬁrmation bias, making retrospective recall of
decision processes unreliable (Mynatt et al., 1977). Therefore, relying on investors' recollections DEMO that the collected data may
not reﬂect the actual decision process (DEMO and Rogers, 1997; Mason and Stark, 2004). Thus, investors may provide decision
processes to researchers that make their decisions look better DEMO than trying to recollect the actual process used.
To correct for these potential problems, Hall and Hofer (1993) suggest the use of real-time data gathering techniques that involve
both recording the data and analyzing it DEMO the interaction is in progress. Verbal protocol analysis (Ericsson and Simon, 1984)has
been the most commonly used real-time technique for investment decision, with Mason and Stark (2004) having used it on BAs.
Experiments DEMO also be used, but external validity is reduced because experiments cannot DEMO the three core characteristics of the
investment decision: the entrepreneur's DEMO of the idea; real risk in the decision process; and the potential for the development
of a long-term relationship between the parties. We DEMO a data gathering approach that overcomes these limitations and allows for the
identiﬁcation of investment stages and decision heuristics used in the BA investment DEMO
4. Stage identiﬁcation, decision heuristics, critical factors and hypotheses
Prior research has broken down the investment process into three main phases: the period of time prior to the interaction
between investor and entrepreneur; the interaction itself; and the period of time after a decision to invest has been made. We refer
to the phase prior to the direct interaction DEMO origination, where trusted third parties refer a small number of fund-seeking
DEMO to a speciﬁc investor (Paul et al., 2007). The phase after the decision to invest will be called formal due diligence,
DEMO factual claims made by the entrepreneur are veriﬁed by the investor.2
It is between these two outer phases that an investor and entrepreneur must DEMO a deal, and this is the interaction captured in our
observational DEMO While there are multiple ways to break this phase down into intermediate stages, we choose to focus this paper on
what we call the selection stage, where we conﬁrm the majority of possible deals are rejected (Dal Cin et al., 1993). As suggested by
Adair and DEMO (2005), changes in behavior can be used to identify the DEMO at which an interaction is taking place. At the selection
stage, DEMO expect the information exchange during an interaction to be less subjective than after the selection set is reduced. Indeed,
statements made at the DEMO stage are “objective” in that any experienced BAs can make a similar determination, but statements
after that stage are more “subjective” since they are based on the BA's personal experience and ability to affect the DEMO post
investment. This view mirrors McMullen and Shepherd's (2006) observation of an initial opportunity evaluation being performed
from a third-person perspective (i.e., more objective) and being only evaluated from a ﬁrst-person perspective (i.e., more subjective) if
the initial assessment is positive. We therefore use DEMO degree of subjectivity in information exchanges during an interaction, which
increases DEMO the process unfolds, as an indicator of whether or not the DEMO is in the selection stage or beyond it.
The process for measuring the relative subjectivity or objectivity of each interaction was determined based on DEMO work of Kim
and Myaeng (2007) who used this approach to explore human–computer interactions in artiﬁcial intelligence systems. Using this
framework, each statement made could be classiﬁ ed as: objective, subjective or indeterminate. Statements DEMO as “we have a
patent” or “our sales were $20,000 last month” were seen as objective, whereas “I believe there is a large market for this product”
or “everyone will want one” were seen to DEMO subjective. Using a standard protocol analysis technique, each statement made by DEMO
entrepreneur was analyzed and coded as objective, subjective or indeterminate. For DEMO 2 min of the interaction, the ratio of
objective to subjective DEMO was measured. We graphed this ratio over time, and when this DEMO fell below 85% the
opportunity was determined to have moved past the selection stage.
Regarding the decision heuristic, we believe a compensatory model (DEMO higher levels of one attribute can compensate for
lower levels on another attribute) is not used at the selection stage due to the cost of a BA's time needed to gather data on all of DEMO
attributes of all opportunities. So that they may devote a higher percentage of their time to investigate in detail the few
opportunities with high DEMO, we argue that they will adopt an elimination-by-aspects (EBA) decision DEMO that will let
them reject a large number of opportunities that are unlikely to receive funding (Tversky, 1972). Using this process, the investor will
initially look for one or more reasons to reject an DEMO, and trim the number of opportunities that require further attention.
While DEMO acknowledge that this technique may not be the most accurate mechanism for decision making, it is one that recognizes
the real time constraints investors operate under, sacriﬁcing accuracy for speed in the decision making process (DEMO et al., 1993).
The potential use of EBA as a DEMO making heuristic can only be veriﬁed if speciﬁc criteria can be identiﬁed that allow
investors to rapidly reject the majority of opportunities. Based on DEMO research on decision making factors considered by BAs,
shown in Table 1, and similar research on factors correlated to success or failure in new product development (Balachandra and
Friar, 1997; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, DEMO) we suggest eight factors that embrace this previous work. These eight DEMO have
also been used in an Innovators Assistance Program (Udell, 1989) and validated for predictive accuracy (Åstebro, 2004).
Each of these factors satisﬁes three criteria that make them suitable for use in an DEMO decision making heuristic. They are:
diagnostic (its presence is positively DEMO to success and its absence correlated to failure); objective (independent DEMO
ratings of the factor have high correlations); and can be observed relatively quickly. Each of the factors selected is shown in Table 2,DEMO
with a description of the criteria it encompasses and references to supporting work. Speciﬁc attention was paid to research that
identiﬁed how the presence DEMO certain “fatal ﬂaws” were correlated to failure, as these factors would DEMO be useful when using
EBA. Factors related to the investment decision or the relationship between entrepreneur and investor were excluded due to their
subjectivity DEMO their longer observation time.
2 While investors will undertake some informal due diligence during the “inner” evaluation process, they assume the entrepreneur's representations are true
and postpone the larger investment in due diligence until they DEMO if a deal is likely.

We explain herein how each factor relates to the larger list of criteria shown in Table 1 and to relevant product development
research. DEMO ﬁrst three factors are functions of the product. Ease of adoption is the attractiveness of the product to potential
customers in the target segment (Feeney et al., 1999). As Mason and Harrison (1996) note, its absence can be a deal killer. Product
status is a measure of both the technology and ﬁnancial risk in getting the product to DEMO, and conﬁrms that a product is either in
the market or DEMO can be (Mason and Harrison, 2002; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987). To ensure the long-term likelihood of
commercial success, a product or service must create a barrier to entry for potential competitors (e.g., DEMO patents; Sudek, 2006).
Market factors are also important and comprise the next three of the eight critical factors. Customer engagement is seen DEMO a
measurement of whether potential customers or users have been consulted in the product development, to ensure that the product
features and value proposition are aligned (Mason and Stark, 2004). In some cases, supply chain issues can be a critical factor, as in the
case of “route to market” for retail products (Mason and Harrison, 1996), DEMO also captures the business model as well as market
dynamics. In highlighting what is often seen as the single most important criteria for BAs, the presence of an existing large market

(Feeney et al., 1999) or of a new market DEMO high growth potential (Mason and Rogers, 1997) is viewed as DEMO These two criteria
are captured in our “market potential” factor.
At the early stage, many researchers identify the critical importance of the entrepreneur (DEMO sometimes the team) in making a
positive investment decision (Feeney et al., 1999; Sudek, 2006). However, precise attributes of the DEMO are often difﬁcult to
determine objectively or rank in importance. As such, the critical factor model has one broad category, namely relevant
entrepreneurial DEMO (Landström, 1998). Our ﬁnal factor encompasses a large variety of ﬁnancial concerns that have been
correctly pointed out by many past researchers (e.g., Feeney et al., 1999). While our ﬁnancial factor considers DEMO proﬁtability of the
venture, it focuses more on how realistic are DEMO anticipated cash ﬂows and projected growth of the venture (Mason and DEMO, 2004).
That factor also augments the evaluation of the entrepreneur DEMO the sense that accurate ﬁnancial projections signal knowledge of the
marketplace. Also, good cash management plans signal a strong and reliable entrepreneur.
In summary, we feel that our eight item critical-factor-assessment tool captures the criteria laid out by many past researchers.
At the same time, we feel that this is a more parsimonious way to evaluate early stage ventures. Finally, due to the value of BAs'
time, we feel that they will use a non-compensatory model to trim their possible investment set to DEMO more manageable number.
This will allow them to spend more time thoroughly evaluating possible investments.
Hypothesis 1. Business angels use elimination-by-aspects (EBA) to DEMO the set of business opportunities looking for investment.
As mentioned earlier, DEMO is a non-compensatory decision model that trades off speed of decision making for potential accuracy. In
decision analysis terms, it increases the chances of a false negative, rejecting an opportunity that might receive funding on the strength
of other criteria, but which does not pass the threshold value on a critical factor. Once the selection stage has been passed, however,
more accurate evaluations are required and so we believe that BAs DEMO to a more compensatory model of decision making (Payne
et al., 1993). In addition, since any fatal ﬂaw would have been discovered in the selection stage, these criteria can now be reduced in
importance or even eliminated completely. For these reasons, we believe that at subsequent stages the decision process will change as
will the criteria considered.
Hypothesis DEMO Once the set of business opportunities looking for investment has been trimmed (i.e., after the selection stage),
business angels consider different factors and use different decision making processes.
5. Research method
Dragons' Den is a globally syndicated reality TV show currently being recorded and shown in DEMO countries. In the show,
entrepreneurs pitch their business opportunities to BAs (the Dragons) in the hopes of obtaining direct equity investment of DEMO
$10,000 and $500,000. In the CBC show, entrepreneurs looking DEMO money for their nascent ventures ﬁrst apply to participate through
an audition process at regional centers across Canada or through an online screening process. DEMO screening process was designed by
the show's producers to match as closely as possible the screening process used by those who refer entrepreneurs DEMO BAs (Dal Cin et al.,
1993).3 The screening resulted DEMO 150 entrepreneurs who were invited to the studio over a period of 15 days. The interactions were
recorded in a continuous format and the DEMO used for the production of the show footage (ten episodes of DEMO min each). In analyzing
the interactions for this research we used unedited line tapes rather than the edited for television version.4 This gave DEMO the
opportunity to examine and reexamine interactions.
In order to test our hypotheses, we had to delineate a selection stage. To do this, DEMO used observational interaction, an enhanced
version of verbal protocol analysis pioneered DEMO Gottman (1998). This technique is designed to record interactions between DEMO
and then allow trained independent raters to extract patterns for further analysis. Observational interaction involves ﬁrst videotaping
the interactions and then coding and analyzing DEMO to interpret behaviors and information exchanges during these interactions.
During the interaction, the entrepreneur started by stating his or her name, the nature DEMO the proposed business and the amount of
capital required. The Dragons then quizzed the entrepreneur on his or her experience and the details of DEMO business in order to decide
whether or not to make an investment offer. The interaction continued until either all ﬁve Dragons withdrew, or one or more Dragons
proposed an investment of their own funds that could DEMO be accepted or rejected by the entrepreneur. When each Dragon withdrew
from an opportunity, he or she was required to provide a reason for the lack of interest in moving forward. Sixteen opportunities
moved past the DEMO stage, however only nine received funding.
5.1. Validity concerns
The use DEMO a reality TV show for academic research raises speciﬁc questions regarding whether an artiﬁcial environment (e.g.,
TV) changes behaviors (Hight, 2001)DEMO A number of researchers have used the natural experiments of game shows to investigate
people's attitude to risk aversion, expected utility theory, DEMO, heterogeneity and discrimination. For example, Gertner
(1993) used the game-show “Card Sharks”, Metrick (1995) looked at “Jeopardy”, Hartley et al. (2005) examined interactions from
3 One of the authors was directly involved in the establishment of the initial screening process in Toronto and in DEMO This process was then replicated
across the country by CBC staff.
4 Line tapes are single continuous recording of the live interactions that include DEMO camera angles. These recordings are time and date stamped and
contain no gaps in the dialogue. On several occasions, these tapes also provided a record of follow up discussions between Dragons after the entrepreneur had
exited.

“Who Wants to Be a Millionaire”, Levitt (2004) studied DEMO Link” and de Roos and Saraﬁdis (2006) examined behaviors on
“Deal or No Deal”. These studies have conﬁ rmed the general applicability of DEMO shows to “real-world” decision making. All
of these are deemed reliable as they study people under situations of real consequences, as does the show “Dragons' Den”, since
investors offer their own funds to real opportunities. DEMO, behavioral economic studies have found that participant's TV
behavior in DEMO intense decision-making environment reﬂected similar behaviors in real-life. Post et al. (DEMO), for example,
investigated prospect theory using “Deal or No Deal”. They conﬁrmed that contestants' decisions on the show were similar to those
in a subsequent experiment that replicated the risky decision making processes. They DEMO noted “prior to the show, contestants
have had considerable time to DEMO about what they might do in various situations” (p. 67). DEMO was the case in Dragons' Den
where both BAs and entrepreneurs DEMO time to reﬂect on how they would make a decision prior to actually making it.
5.2. Coding and analysis
For each investment opportunity, three trained raters calculated a grade for the opportunity on each of the DEMO critical factors.
These raters completed the review before knowing the outcome of the opportunity. One of these raters is one of the authors of DEMO
paper while the two other raters have had extensive experience of the critical-factor-assessment tool and were both highly trained
and experienced in issues around DEMO viability of new business. A factor was given an A if there was a clear advantage associated
with the factor, C if there was a clear problem, which corresponded to a fatal ﬂaw, and B DEMO the answer was in between. The scoring
guidelines for the speciﬁc ratings for each factor are given in Table 3. Raters could annotate each DEMO score with a + or − to
facilitate discrimination between opportunities. For analytical purposes, we translated the grades to a numerical score and created
a “gap” between each grade category, speciﬁcally A+ = 10, A DEMO 9, A− = 8, B+ = 6, B = 5, B− = 4, C+ = 2, C = 1, C− = 0. The gap
was created to highlight the importance of a change DEMO category (particularly the “fatal ﬂaw” grade). Inter-rater reliability was
found DEMO be 72% on the full scale, but when absolute scores (i.e., A+, B−, etc.) were replaced with categorical scores (A, DEMO, C), the
inter-rater reliability improved to 95%.5 This shows broad DEMO regarding the presence or absence of a fatal ﬂaw. In fact, DEMO
agreement between raters on the presence of a fatal ﬂaw was 97%. For each factor, the scores from the three raters were added and
divided by three, then rounded off to the nearest integer. Adding the scores for the eight factors provided the actual critical-factor-
assessment score for DEMO opportunity.
6. Results
Our ﬁrst step was to isolate the types of interactions that occurred in the selection stage in order to determine whether DEMO
opportunity had moved beyond this stage. To do this, as previously DEMO, we used verbal protocol analysis on interactions from
the previous season DEMO the show (season 1) to measure the level of objectivity displayed over the course of the interactions; using this
level of objectivity to establish whether or not the interaction was in the selection stage or DEMO it. By objectivity, we mean questions
and responses that most parties DEMO interpret in a similar manner. For instance, questions such as “do DEMO have a patent” and “how
many orders do you have lined up” would be coded as completely objective. Each question-and-answer interaction was coded as
DEMO objective, completely subjective, or 50% of each. Based upon the authors' experience with season 1, we chose 85% or more
objective as DEMO of being in the selection stage. This analysis was then applied to season 2 data to categorize the selection stage
from the later stages.
DEMO test whether EBA was being used in the selection stage, we DEMO a 2 × 2 matrix with the presence of a fatal ﬂaw (i.e., a “C”)
on one axis and whether or not DEMO opportunity moved beyond the selection stage (was selected) on the other. As per Table 4,
every opportunity that had a fatal ﬂaw DEMO rejected by all of the Dragons during the selection stage. We also found that all of the
opportunities without a fatal ﬂaw completed the DEMO stage — that is at least one of the Dragons was interested in pursuing the
opportunity further. This ﬁnding conﬁrmed Hypothesis 1, that the presence of a fatal ﬂaw would stop an investment from
proceeding, while the absence of a fatal ﬂaw would allow an opportunity to complete DEMO selection stage.
Recall also that the Dragons were asked for their reason for rejection. There were 750 interactions (5 Dragons and 150
opportunities) DEMO which 80 (5 × 16) had no fatal ﬂaw, as DEMO by both sides (Dragons and raters). As shown in Table DEMO, in 89%
5999670 × 100% the reason given was a fatal DEMO on one or more of the eight critical factors. Other reasons used by
of the rejectionsthe BAs to reject included“I am uncomfortable with the DEMO (e.g., weapons accessories) or “I feel that the entrepreneur's
DEMO request is unreasonable” (unrealistic valuation). On numerous occasions, a second or third BA identiﬁed the same fatal
ﬂaw. Also, an opportunity was often rejected prior to the BA's evaluation on all critical factors DEMO the interaction was
terminated before that BA had the chance to review all factors. We feel this provides further support for the use of DEMO and for the
rigor of our eight critical factors.
To further conﬁrm that EBA was used rather than a weighted score on all attributes, we performed a logistic regression, coding
a move to the post-selection stage as one, and a rejection in the selection stage as a zero.6 We then used that regression model to
predict whether or not the DEMO would continue to the post-selection stage. As per Table 6, while DEMO model performed
well in predicting whether an opportunity continued (B = DEMO, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke r-square = 0.92), this model was less
accurate than a simple discrete model. The positive performance of the DEMO is largely driven by the correct prediction on 99.3%
of rejected opportunities. It is less accurate on predicting successes, incorrectly rejecting 2 of the 16 opportunities that moved

For completeness, we analyzed the data with and without the +/− and found no appreciable differences in DEMO results.
The independent variable was the critical-factor-assessment score for the opportunity.

beyond the selection stage. Since an EBA model is more accurate on predicting successful selection and more parsimonious, we
conclude that this is the model followed by BAs.
We also DEMO that the decision making process changed once the selection stage had been passed (e.g., to the funding
decision). To test this, we performed a t -test on the scores of the 16 opportunities that DEMO the selection stage using whether
or not an opportunity received funding as the grouping variable. The mean score for those opportunities funded was 54.56, not
statistically different from the mean score of 54.29 for unfunded opportunities (t (14) = 0.06, p = 0.96). A Levene's test for
equality of variances was not statistically signiﬁ cant, so we assume that the samples do not have different variances. We argue
that DEMO shows that the decision criteria and the decision making process are different post-selection, thus conﬁrming
Hypothesis 2.
7. Discussion and conclusion
Past research on BA decision making assumes that potential investors use a large laundry list DEMO factors that are then combined
in some weighting model. Our results, DEMO, contradict this view by showing that elimination-by-aspects (Tversky, 1972), DEMO
non-compensatory decision making heuristic, better deﬁ nes the BAs in their DEMO decision making process. This is our main
theoretical contribution; that we DEMO a shortcoming of previous theoretical research, which only focused on the DEMO
evaluated, rather than the process by which it was evaluated. We DEMO utilized a more parsimonious set of criteria (the eight
critical factors) and also shown that the BAs do not use a fully compensatory DEMO, although most previous research suggests that
they should. While non-compensatory decision DEMO heuristics may reject a good candidate simply for a low score on one
attribute, it has the beneﬁ t of being a fast decision making tool, saving valuable time. Once a potential investor discovers a “fatal
ﬂaw,” he or she no longer needs to consider that opportunity DEMO can curtail the interaction.
Our results also show that EBA as a decision making heuristic is not used in the ﬁnal decision of whether DEMO not to fund an
opportunity. Subsequent to the selection process, these DEMO are much less important, with other criteria, likely more subjective,
being used to make the ﬁnal decision. While we have not yet DEMO data in the post-selection stage, we believe that more
compensatory models DEMO decision making are used at subsequent stages.

7.1. Limitations and future research
The main limitation is the use of a reality TV show as a research venue rather than DEMO BA behavior in their normal
businesses. However, as discussed earlier in DEMO paper, experts were hired by the show producers to mimic as DEMO as possible the
real processes in which BAs engage. We believe this procedure mitigates this concern. Some might also criticize the television
show setting DEMO saying that it imposes artiﬁcial time constraints on the BAs. If this were true, then they would be somehow forced
into using the EBA heuristic in order to save time. While the show may have forced DEMO Dragons to economize on their time, we
have every reason to DEMO that the Dragons perceive their time as valuable. In fact, Mason DEMO Rogers (1997) observe time
compression in actual investment decisions, ﬁ DEMO the median time BAs devoted to the equivalent of our “selection stage” was
just 9 min. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that in the normal course of business (beyond the show) BAs would attempt DEMO
adopt any decision heuristics that would save them time at a minimal cost in accuracy (e.g., EBA).
Some may further argue that DEMO rejection decisions of the BAs were inﬂuenced by the others. In other words, if one dropped
out, the others may feel some peer DEMO to do the same. Indeed, Banerjee (1992) and Scharfsetin and DEMO (1990) would argue
that BAs' individual decisions could not be DEMO on as independent, as they would be inﬂuenced by the decisions DEMO other BAs.
These authors argue that this is a rational approach to decision making, because there is an assumption that another BA's decision
carries relevant information that is pertinent to the decision being made. This DEMO lead us to assume that once one BA drops out
of an investment opportunity, the rest would follow. Similarly, it would lead us DEMO suggest that once a single BA made an offer to
invest, DEMO others would also invest. While we cannot rule out this possibility, DEMO believe that personality factors of the Dragons
would greatly reduce the likelihood of any herding behavior. In fact, the producers of the show selected Dragons who were
deemed highly egotistical. This personality trait would make them DEMO to stand out from others, thereby diminishing any motive
222
A.L. Maxwell et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 26 (2011) 212–225
to follow the crowd. In addition, the Dragons were not DEMO for appearing on the show, meaning that their behaviors led
to DEMO ﬁ nancial consequences. Thus we believe they acted in a manner consistent with how they would act outside the show.
Another possible limitation is DEMO this paper focused only on the selection stage rather than the full interaction leading to the
funding decision. Using observational interactions to extend it DEMO the post-selection stage would enable the identiﬁcation of
decision criteria and what other decision heuristics might be used by BAs over the entire investment DEMO process. An analysis
of the entrepreneur–BA interactions throughout that process would help identify how the ongoing relationship develops and its
implications for receiving funding DEMO longer-term development of entrepreneur–investor relationships.
In addition, the sample is admittedly DEMO, with only ﬁve BAs evaluating 150 possible investment opportunities.7 There were
DEMO 250,000 BAs operating in the U.S. in 2008 (Sohl, 2009), so while we can begin to make some observations about the DEMO
followed by our sample, generalizing their behavior to the full population DEMO be risky. We also cannot be certain that the
opportunities chosen by the producers are representative of all possible opportunities that a BA would DEMO in a year. However, even
with these possible limitations, we believe this work makes a contribution toward understanding BA behaviors when making
investment DEMO Future work should try to test our hypotheses on a larger scale and in a variety of contexts.
The critical factors we chose may DEMO have some limitations. There may be missing factors which were not considered or
redundant factors that are unnecessary. Even though our model of eight DEMO factors performed well in predicting which investment
opportunity moved out of the selection stage, other research suggests that there may be additional factors that would help predict
success, particularly beyond the selection stage. Our observations are consistent with this past research. When the entrepreneur
provided an unrealistic valuation, the interaction was often terminated, although this was usually after other information had already
been gathered. In addition, we found that the BA had to like the industry, reducing the chance they would invest in products with
which they could not identify. We also found that if the DEMO was inconsistent when presenting information or the BA knew
that information presented by the entrepreneur was incorrect, the interaction ended.
We also investigated the role of relevant experience of the BA (domain expertise) in increasing DEMO likelihood of an investment
(e.g., McMullen and Shepherd, 2006). DEMO found mixed support for this in the sense that while domain expertise increased a BA's
likelihood to invest, it also caused the BA to be more critical when evaluating an opportunity. Creating factors for each DEMO these possible
factors as noted above might increase the predictive power of an opportunity being selected, however, since the eight factor model did
DEMO job well, adding these may simply increase complexity for no additional DEMO
Admittedly, some of the eight factors might be redundant, and a model with fewer factors would be just as successful in predicting
selection. DEMO is suggested by a number of follow up analyses on the data. First, the individual scores on each factor are highly correlated as
portrayed in Table 7. Redundancy is also suggested by the fact that there DEMO usually more than one fatal ﬂaw in an opportunity as
highlighted in Table 5 and in Table 8, which shows, by opportunity, whether or not it was selected to move beyond the ﬁrst stage and DEMO
many fatal ﬂaws that opportunity had. Finally, tests of independence not DEMO here show that almost none of the factors are
completely independent of the others.8 These analyses all suggest that a smaller set of critical DEMO may be sufﬁcient in predicting
success in the selection stage. However, DEMO our sample is small (n = 150), these tests of DEMO do not have as much power as
they would have in a larger sample. We therefore feel it is too early to claim that DEMO than the full eight factors would be sufﬁcient.
7.2. Other contributions
An important contribution of this paper to the existing literature has been methodological. DEMO rely on an observational interaction
technique that enabled us to reduce possible biases by observing behaviors rather than relying on BAs' recollections. This approach also
allowed us to isolate the selection stage and observe the interactions DEMO the investment decision was known. Further, the video-
based collection allowed DEMO the gathering of both qualitative and quantitative data. In addition to conﬁrming our hypotheses, this data
helped identify behaviors that positively or negatively affected the likelihood of completing the selection stage.
A second methodological contribution has DEMO our focus on reasons for rejection rather than reasons for choosing. Most past
research has focused on reasons for success. Analyzing only successes limits DEMO on the factors that can differentiate between
receiving funding or not. As a result, the development of a “diagnostic tool” that can identify the factors correlated to success is made
easier by studying the reasons for DEMO Because most data gathering effort have been conducted at the end of the investment
decision process, isolating the early stages of the investment has also been difﬁcult. Analyzing the causes for rejection at the selection
stage DEMO help scholars understand how the information exchange that develops during the BA–entrepreneur interaction impacts the
likelihood of moving further in the investment decision process.
DEMO research also has several practical implications. Entrepreneurs aware of each of the eight most common causes for rejection at
the selection stage (i.e., DEMO C score for adoption, product status, protectability, customer engagement, route to market, market potential,
relevant experience, or ﬁnancial model) can ﬁnd ways to eliminate or reduce them prior to pitching their ideas DEMO a potential investor.
7 We do not assume that the Dragons are representative of all BAs. Nevertheless, Dal Cin et al. (1993) and Madill et al. (2005) identify some key BA
characteristics and experiences DEMO led us to conclude that there are similarities in the approach made to investment decisions when BAs are serial investors
with entrepreneurial experience. Our DEMO BAs were all serial investors and had a strong entrepreneurial background in the food (Boston Pizza), marketing
(Venture Communications), retail (LaSenza), Internet security (Brak Systems) and education (Learning Company) sectors. DEMO also exhibited many of the
classic BAs characteristics noted in previous research (Dal Cin et al., 1993; Landström, 2007), including broad DEMO experience, come from different
backgrounds and parts of the country, and have made previous seed investments. Hence, they may not be perfectly representative but are a good sample fora
case study.
8 Independence of factors DEMO be shown by the likelihood of occurrence of one fatal ﬂaw not be affected by the presence of another ﬂaw. For all factors
except DEMO 3 (protectability), the hypothesis of independence of factors is rejected.

Also, as entrepreneurs are made aware of the importance of these factors, they will likely present more relevant information to
potential investors and reduce the potential DEMO rejection due to miscommunication. We conﬁrmed this belief by offering
entrepreneurs participating in season 3 of the show a series of webinars that focused DEMO identifying and addressing the eight critical
factors. These sessions led to a near doubling of opportunities passing the selection stage. The number of opportunities DEMO doubled
and the total dollar amount of funding more than tripled. To conﬁrm that it was the webinars that led to this increase, we held
interviews with successful entrepreneurs. Over 90% felt that these webinars were DEMO in structuring their presentations and
understanding the dynamics of the interactions.
Regarding academic contributions, Riding et al. (2007) noted the need for more research on how BAs arrive at their investment
decisions. To move a DEMO further in this direction, we studied the investment decision process of DEMO to identify how they trim the set
of potential business opportunities and, once this set is trimmed, whether a different set of criteria DEMO used to move an opportunity to
the next stage. We did this while addressing the limits of prior research with a set of interactions DEMO the Canadian version of a reality
TV show. We found support for our two hypotheses. That is, BAs looked for the presence of a single fatal ﬂaw in one of eight critical
factors as a reason DEMO rejection at the selection stage, but BAs dropped this non-compensatory decision DEMO and considered
different factors as they made ﬁnal funding decisions. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant academic, practitioner, and policy maker
implications as we have DEMO In addition, we hope that our exploration of the initial stage (selection) of the BA investment process
will spur future research in further enhancing the understanding of the interaction between entrepreneurs and investors.
