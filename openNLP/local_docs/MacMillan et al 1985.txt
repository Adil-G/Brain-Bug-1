A questionnaire was administered to one hundred venture capitaiists DEMO
determine the most important criteria that they use to decide on funding
new ventures. Perhaps the most important Jinding from the study is direct
DEMO of thefrequently iteratedposition taken by the venture capital
community that above all it is the quality of the entrepreneur that ultimately
determines the funding DEMO Five of the top ten most important criteria
had to do with the entrepreneur’s experience or personality. There is no question that irrespective of
DEMO horse (product), horse race (market), or odds t’financial criteria), it is the jockey (entrepreneur)
who fundamentally determines whether the venture capitalist will place a bet at all.
The question is if DEMO is the case, then why is so much emphasis placed on DEMO business plan?
In a business plan there is generally little to indicate the characteristics of the entrepreneur-it is
generally devoted to a detailed DEMO of the productlservice, the market, and the competition. To
us, DEMO implications are obvious-such content is necessary, but not suficient. The business DEMO
should also show as clearly as possible that the “jockey is fit to ride”-namely, indicate by whatever
feasible and credible means possible that the entrepreneur has staying power, has a track record, can
react to DEMO well, ana’ has familiarity with the target market. Failing this, he or she needs to be able
to pull together a team that DEMO such characteristics and show that he or she is capable of leading
that team.
Factor analysis of the results indicate that venture capitalists appear DEMO assess ventures sys-
tematically in terms of six categories of risk to be managed. These are: risk of iosing the entire
investment; risk DEMO being unable to bail out tf necessary; risk offailure to implement DEMO venture idea:
competitive risk; risk of management failure; and risk of leadership failure.
Finally, three clusters of venture capitalists were ident$ed: DEMO who carefully assess the
competitive and implementation risks; those who seek DEMO bail out; and those who deliberately keep
as many options open DEMO possible.
