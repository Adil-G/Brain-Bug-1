Abstract
The DEMO adopts a network perspective in an attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms
generating the different university spinout structures. In this respect, we propose a trichotomous
categorisation of university spinouts into orthodox, hybrid and technology spinouts and argue that the
academic’s embeddedness in a network of exoinstitutional and endoinstitutional DEMO influences the
type of spinout initiated. We draw from some of the recent network research that has adopted a
contingency approach in explaining the DEMO of social networks.

1. Executive summary
Networks are of catalytic importance in entrepreneurial ventures. This paper examines the
influence of network DEMO in the generation of university spinout structure. University
spinouts involve the direct commercialisation of intellectual property developed within the
university and their importance for DEMO economic vitality of a region or nation cannot be
emphasised enough. Nevertheless, only a small number of studies have focused explicitly on
university spinouts. As the field has been plagued by definitional inconsistencies, we propose
the following definition of university spinouts. Spinouts involve: (1) the transfer of a core

technology from an academic institution into a new company and (2) the founding member(s)
may include the inventor academic(s) who may or may not be currently affiliated with the
academic institution.
Within this, it is clear that there may be variations in the involvement of the key academics
and we propose a trichotomous categorisation of DEMO spinouts. In this respect, an
orthodox spinout involves both the academic DEMO(s) and the technology spinning out
from the institution. A hybrid DEMO involves the technology spinning out and the
academic(s) retaining his DEMO her university position, but holding a directorship, membership
of the scientific advisory board or other part time position within the company. The scenario
DEMO some academics spinning out and some retaining their university affiliation is also
subsumed under this category. Last, a technology spinout involves the technology spinning
out but the academic maintaining no connection with the newly established firm. DEMO,
the possibility of the academic having equity in the company and/or offering advice on a
consultancy basis is not discounted.
Our contention DEMO that the academic’s embeddedness in a network of exoinstitutional and
endoinstitutional ties influences the type of spinout initiated. In other words, we aim to
evaluate the impact of the network structure at the idea evolution stage DEMO the type of spinout
initiated. We draw from Burt’s (1992, 2000a) structural holes proposition and Coleman’s
(1988, 1990) social closure theory DEMO guidance in the generation of our hypotheses. In view
of some of the recent conciliatory approaches, we adopt a contingency approach in explaining
the value of social networks. In this respect, content as a contingency factor examines how
the value of social capital is differentially related to the DEMO of contacts.
This trichotomous categorization is important to university officials, venture DEMO and
researchers for a number of reasons. First, from a typological DEMO, it portrays the
different modes of opportunity exploitation. Second, it describes the academic’s operational
role in the newly established company and portrays the DEMO of the relationship between the
university and the spinout. For example, DEMO involved in hybrid spinouts, may not only
constitute role models and DEMO as a source of advice to other academics wishing to spin out,
but may also exhibit a higher propensity of becoming habitual spinout DEMO Third,
we believe that different types of spinouts may be associated with different growth
trajectories and different evolutionary patterns. Fourth, the different types of spinouts may
have different implications on the rates of entry of DEMO technology-based firms in an industry.
2. Introduction
Networks play a protagonistic role in many aspects of organizational emergence (Birley,
1985; Aldrich and DEMO, 1986; Larson and Starr, 1993; Renzulli et al., 2000; Aldrich,
1999; Johannisson, 2000). They constitute critical avenues for DEMO acquisition of information
and resources. Indeed, we echo Aldrich and Zimmer’s (1986) remark that entrepreneurship is
channelled and facilitated or constrained and inhibited by people’s positions in social
networks. Our purpose here is to utilise DEMO network concepts to guide our understanding
of the underlying structures generating university spinouts. In this respect, spinouts are

becoming increasingly important as a mechanism for technology transfer from DEMO
institutions and involve the direct commercialisation of intellectual property developed within
the university. They are a source of wealth creation and job opportunities in DEMO economy
(Birch, 1987; Steffenson et al., 2000) and a DEMO way of recouping economic dividends from
a nation’s investment in higher education and research (Mian and Plosila, 1998).
The importance of spinouts DEMO the economic vitality of a region or nation cannot be
emphasized enough. A recent study by BankBoston shows that there are over 4000 MIT-
DEMO companies, creating over 1 million jobs worldwide and generating annual sales DEMO
$232 billion (BankBoston, 1997). In France, a study by DEMO (1997) estimated that spinouts
constitute 40% of the high-tech firms established between 1987 and 1997. Moreover, a
comparison of income from university equity sales in start-up companies to income generated
from licenses, reveals that the average value of equity is significantly greater than the average
annual revenue DEMO a license (Bray and Lee, 2000).
Although a number of studies have examined various types of academic entrepreneurship
(e.g., Louis et DEMO, 1989; Chrisman et al., 1995), very few studies focused DEMO on
university spinouts. We argue that rather than representing a unique, DEMO
outcome, there is more than one way in which the academic DEMO may be involved in
the spinout process. We thus propose a trichotomous categorisation of university spinouts into
orthodox, hybrid and technology spinouts. We then propose the use of network concepts as
the epicentre of our understanding DEMO the spinout trichotomy. Our contention is that the
academic’s embeddeness in a network of endoinstitutional and exoinstitutional1 ties influen-
ces the type of spinout DEMO
While there is broad agreement about the catalytic role of social capital, there are two
schools of thought with respect to the social structure that is most facilitative. On the one
hand, some scholars have argued that it is a cohesive or densely embedded network that
confers a DEMO advantage (Coleman, 1988, 1990; Walker et al., 1997; Ahuja, 2000).
On the other hand, some have found that a DEMO connected network full of structural holes
is the precursor of this advantage (Burt, 1992, 2000b). In this respect, we adopt the
DEMO perspective that has recently developed, and which reconciles the two sources
DEMO social capital (Podolny and Baron, 1997; Burt, 1997a, 2000a)DEMO
The first part of the paper examines the role of social networks in organizational
emergence and delves briefly into the spinout literature. The second DEMO investigates
definitional issues and presents a typological framework of the spinout phenomenon. We
then construct a network model to guide our understanding of the DEMO generating the
different spinout structures. We finally conclude with implications of the model and directions
for future research.
1 Exoinstitutional refers to outside the DEMO institution, while endoinstitutional refers to inside the
institution (terms derived from the Greek prefixes endo and exo). The distinction is important as DEMO ‘‘conditions
for entrepreneurial action outside organizations are qualitatively different than those inside organizations’’
(Aldrich, 1999, p. 85).

3. Conceptual background
We first outline two critical elements that DEMO the conceptual spine of our model:
first, the role of DEMO networks in organizational emergence and, second, the university
spinout phenomenon.
3.1. Social networks in organizational emergence
Social networks play a protagonistic role in DEMO emergence. In this respect, the
prolegomena of social network analysis lie DEMO an exchange and dependency perspective.
Social exchange theory (Homans, 1950, DEMO; Blau, 1964) purported to explain the
occurrence of a dyadic DEMO on the demand and supply of resources that each person
in the dyad had to offer. The framework was extended beyond the dyad, to encapsulate more
macroscopic social structures by Emerson (1962, 1972), who DEMO that power resides
implicitly in another’s dependency. Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) subsequently utilised some of
Emerson’s (1962, 1972) ideas in formulating resource dependency theory. They argued that
managers structured their resource linkages to buffer DEMO organization from the impact of
external threats.
Networks facilitate organisational emergence by providing four substantive benefits: they
augment the opportunity identification process, provide DEMO to a loci of resources,
engender timing advantages, and constitute DEMO source of status and referrals.
3.1.1. Opportunity identification
Networks greatly enhance the entrepreneurs’ opportunity recognition capabilities (Hills et
al., 1997). In this DEMO, Venkataraman (1997) draws from Hayek’s (1945) observation
about the DEMO of information in the market and argues that ‘‘the possession of useful
knowledge varies among individuals and... this strongly influences the search for and DEMO
decision to exploit an opportunity’’ (Venkataraman, 1997, p. 123). DEMO other words, the
discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities depends, in part, DEMO the distribution of information
in society (Kirzner, 1973). As human action is embedded in ongoing systems of social
relations (Granovetter, 1985), social networks can be argued to be of significant importance in
accessing and harnessing this information.2 Indeed, a number of scholars have provided a
fine-grained analysis of the antecedent role of social networks in opportunity identification.
DEMO example, Hills et al. (1997) differentiated between solo entrepreneurs, who had
recognised the business opportunity themselves, and network entrepreneurs, who had
DEMO the opportunity through their social networks. Similarly, Sigrist (1999) utilised
DEMO cognitive mapping approach and proposed a distinction between constructor-type and
discoverer-type entrepreneurs; the former type discovered the opportunity themselves, while
the latter discovered DEMO opportunity through the right personal contact.
2 Contrast this opportunity ‘discovery’ perspective with the opportunity enactment perspective where
opportunities are the outcome of the DEMO activities of individuals (Gartner et al., 2001; Sarasvathy, 2001;
Venkataraman and Sarasvathy, 2001).
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 333–359 337
Singh et al. (1999) found that the size and DEMO of weak ties in an entrepreneur’s social
network were positively related to the number of new venture ideas identified and new
venture opportunities recognised. DEMO found that network entrepreneurs identified signific-
antly more opportunities than solo entrepreneurs. Ardichvili and Cardozo (1999) used an
embedded case study design with DEMO entrepreneurial opportunity as the unit of analysis. They
found that in seven out of eight cases analysed, access to extended social networks was a
prerequisite to successful opportunity discovery.
One of the most comprehensive models of DEMO opportunity identification process which
describes the recognition, evaluation and development of DEMO opportunity is provided by
Ardichvili et al. (in press). With DEMO to present concerns, they identify social networks as
one of the DEMO of entrepreneurial alertness, which constitutes a necessary condition
for opportunity identification. DEMO a different lens, De Koning and Muzyka (1999)
conceptualise opportunity formation as a socio-cognitive process. They identify four types
of relationships within DEMO entrepreneur’s social context; these include the inner circle (with
whom the entrepreneur has long-term stable relationships), the action set (people recruited by
the entrepreneur to provide the necessary resources for the opportunity), the DEMO (team
members involved in the start-up) and a network of weak ties (used to gather general
information and possibly future resource providers). The entrepreneur develops the oppor-
tunity through a trilogy of cognitive activities DEMO these four groups, that includes
information gathering, thinking/articulating and resource assessing. Moreover, each group
within the social context plays a role, DEMO is distinctively different from the roles played by
the other groups.
3.1.2. Access
Networks help entrepreneurs because the business foundation process requires a variety DEMO
resources (Aldrich et al., 1987). In this respect, Starr DEMO MacMillan (1990) stress the
importance of social contracting as a means to resource cooptation. More specifically,
individuals embedded within broad networks will DEMO more likely to identify potential
exchange partners and consequently capitalise on potential exchange opportunities (Rangan,
2000). Moreover, social capital enhances small DEMO owners’ access to business loans,
while it may also lower the cost of loans (Uzzi, 1999). From a different lens, it may constitute
a source of emotional support. Indeed, ‘‘regardless of their personal networking abilities,
nascent entrepreneurs who occupy impoverished social locations may find DEMO cut off
from... critical resources’’ (Aldrich, 1999, p. 98).
DEMO importance of networks in resource acquisition is also exemplified by the duality in
the level of analysis exhibited ‘‘in the simultaneity of an entrepreneur’s DEMO and an
emerging firm’s initial network’’ (Hite and Hesterly, 2001, DEMO 277). In this respect, Larson and
Starr (1993) explore DEMO development and transformation of unidimensional dyadic relation-
ships into multidimensional inter-organisational exchange relationships. Their network model
appreciates the social embeddedness of economic relations and DEMO the formation of an
organisation as the crystallisation of an individual/organisational network. Similarly, others
have even described the birth of a new venture as ‘‘the institutionalisation of a part of the
entrepreneur’s personal network into DEMO venture’’ (Johannisson, 2000, p. 373).

3.1.3. Timing
Networks have important timing implications. Embeddedness promotes economies DEMO time
and enables actors to capitalise quickly on market opportunities (Uzzi, 1997). As the
availability of time is the economy’s most fundamental DEMO, it has profound implications
on economic outcomes (Juster and Stafford, DEMO). Indeed, an assumption of social network
approaches is that a DEMO has a finite amount of time and energy to invest in social
relationships (Seibert et al., 2001).
3.1.4. Status and referrals
Networks DEMO a source of referrals that provide feedback effects and generate
legitimacy in entrepreneurial actions. For example, venture capitalists are more inclined to
invest in companies that they know or have been referred to by trusted resources DEMO this
tends to alleviate informational asymmetry problems (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). In other
words, social ties are often conceived by external agents as certifications of an individual’s
social credentials (Lin, 2001).
3.2. DEMO spinout phenomenon
Roberts (1968) and Cooper (1971, 1973) were DEMO the first to study the spinout
phenomenon. The Roberts study examined spinouts from MIT laboratories and academic
departments while Cooper’s work focused on corporate DEMO in what was to become
Silicon Valley. Since then, a number DEMO studies spanning different countries have been
undertaken including the US (Smilor DEMO al., 1990; Brett et al., 1991; Roberts, 1991; Steffenson
et al., 2000), the UK (Blair and Hitchens, 1998), Italy (Chiesa and Piccaluga, 1998) and
Canada (Doutriaux, 1987). Nevertheless, in the majority of studies, spinouts constitute only
one of DEMO number of technology transfer mechanisms examined. In fact, only a few DEMO
empirical studies focusing exclusively on technology spinouts have been conducted (Lind-
DEMO, 1997). Indeed, 30 years on, Cooper’s (1971, p. DEMO) remark that a ‘‘systematic
investigation of the subject is still at DEMO infancy’’ seems to hold. A reason might be that
identifying the academics who took the ‘from profs to profits’ (Piccaluga, 1992) route, DEMO
measuring the exact degree of university ‘leakage’ through informal channels (Birley, 1992,
1993) is not an easy task (Chiesa and Piccaluga, 1999). In this respect, Chrisman et al. (1995)
argue DEMO any attempts at measurement will underestimate the extent of faculty entrepren-
eurship. They quote Vesper and McMullan (1988) who note the existence of DEMO ‘iceberg
effect’ in the identification of faculty generated ventures.
The literature has also been mainly atheoretical (Autio, 2000) and noncumulative. Apart
from a small number of studies (e.g., Louis et al., 1989; Roberts DEMO Malone, 1996), the
majority have focused on a single university DEMO on a very small number of institutions
making it hard to draw any generalisations. It also remains mainly US biased although
there has been DEMO recent upsurge in European research (see Oakey and During, 1998).
Moreover, a large number of these studies have been conducted in technopoles—i.e.,
technology cities—where there are numerous spinouts (Route 128, BankBoston, 1997;
University of New Mexico, Steffenson et al., 2000; Austin, DEMO, Smilor et al., 1990;
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 333–359
339
Cambridge, Wicksteed, 1985) but where the prevalence of network externalities may
considerably bias the results.
The majority of the limited literature DEMO approached the spinout phenomenon from four
dimensions. First, some have examined DEMO characteristics as a predictor of entrepren-
eurial activity (Louis et al., 1989; Roberts, 1991; Kassicieh et al., 1996). In this DEMO,
Roberts (1991, p. 341) concluded that ‘‘although the entrepreneur DEMO more extroverted than his
rather introverted technical colleagues, the high technology DEMO still emerges looking
more like an inventor than any other unique role.’’ Second, some have examined the effect of
institutional structures and policies. At this level, factors affecting technology spinouts
include the official university policy (DEMO, 1986; Smilor et al., 1990; Roberts and Malone,
1996; Chiesa and Piccaluga, 1999; Bercovitz et al., 2001), the DEMO reward system,
which is usually based on the academic’s publication record (Franklin et al., 2001; Howells et
al., 1998), ideological DEMO between the traditional role of the university and entrepren-
eurial academic orientations (Bok, 1982; Stankiewicz, 1986; Samsom and Gurdon, 1993) and
issues involving intellectual property rights (IPR). Third, departmental norms have DEMO been
found influential in engineering technical entrepreneurship. In this respect, Louis DEMO al. (1989)
argue that behavioural expectations are reinforced at the DEMO rather than institutional
level and find a relatively strong effect of local norms on individual behaviour. Fourth, a
number of researchers have examined the importance of external influences, and especially
those related to processes and institutions associated with national innovation systems
(Nelson, 1993) and their differential effects on spinout rates. For example, a significant
stimulus in the generation of spinouts was the ending of the British Technology Group (BTG)
monopoly in the UK and the implementation of the Bayh-Dole Act in the DEMO (Hague and
Oakley, 2000; Mowery et al., 2001; Nelson, 2001).
4. A trichotomous categorisation of university spinouts
4.1. Defining a DEMO
One of the issues that we face is that there is no universal definition of a university spinout.
In this respect, Smilor et al. (1990) defined spinout companies in two ways: (a) the founder
was a faculty member, staff member, or student who left the DEMO to start a company or
who started a company while still affiliated with the university; (b) a technology or
technology-based idea developed within the university. Radosevich (1995) differentiated
between inventor–entrepreneurs and surrogate–entrepreneurs. The former DEMO laboratory
employees who sought to commercialise their own inventions, while the DEMO were those
who acquired the rights to commercialise the technology from the university. Roberts and
Malone (1996) identify four principal parties involved in DEMO spinout process: the technology
originator, the entrepreneur, the R&D DEMO and the venture investor. They argue that
the interactions between these parties vary considerably and propose five different variations
of the above. The first DEMO assumes independence between the four principal groups while
the second describes the situation involving an entrepreneurial technologist. The third model
340 N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (DEMO) 333–359
involves both an entrepreneurial inventor and an internal venture capital DEMO The fourth
scenario involves an internal venture capital fund but distinguishes between the inventor and
the entrepreneur, while the fifth model assumes the provision of venture capital by the
entrepreneur. Carayannis et al. (1998) investigated DEMO spinouts from US Federal R&D
laboratories in New Mexico and Japanese government laboratories and universities. They
argue that we should either define a DEMO as a new company that is established by
transferring its core technology, founders or other resources from a parent organisation, or
limit the DEMO of a spinout to specific resource transfers, such as in the DEMO of a technology
spinout, a founder spinout or a venture capital DEMO In this respect, we provide the
following definition, which is both encompassing and parsimonious. Spinouts3 involve:
1. The transfer of a core DEMO from an academic institution into a new company.
2. The founding member(s) may include the inventor academic(s) who may or may DEMO be
currently affiliated with the academic institution.
4.2. The spinout trichotomy
From the above, it is clear that there may be variations in the involvement of the key
inventors. Indeed, we agree with the conclusions of Miner et al. (2001, p. 33) who argue that
‘‘rather than representing a single, undifferentiated outcome driven by a universal process,
there may be distinct types of USBNVs [University Science Based New Ventures] and
DEMO processes or fields which give rise to them.’’ With respect to the process, we focus
on the network underpinnings of spinout structure. With respect to the nondistinctiveness of
the spinout phenomenon, we propose the following trichotomous categorisation of university
spinouts.
(a) An orthodox spinout involves both the DEMO inventor(s) and the technology spinning
out from the institution.
(b) A hybrid spinout involves the technology spinning out and the academic(s) retaining his
or her university position, but holding a directorship, membership of the scientific
advisory board or other part time position within the DEMO The scenario involving
some academics spinning out and some retaining their university affiliation is also
subsumed under this category.
(c) A technology spinout DEMO the technology spinning out but the academic maintaining
no connection with the newly established firm. However, the possibility of the academic
3 Companies established by current or former members of a university which do not involve DEMO
commercialisation of intellectual property arising from academic research are not subsumed in the definition of a
spinout. Indeed, Hague and Oakley (2000, pp. 5 and 7) clearly differentiate between spinouts and start-ups. The
latter ‘‘may be set up by current or former students and members of staff, drawing on knowledge and expertise
(usually not research) in all areas DEMO on innate or acquired entrepreneurial skills... Founders of start-ups establish
their companies to exploit expertise and knowledge gained during their careers and not, in contrast to spinoffs,
from specific research projects.’’

341
having equity in the company and/or offering advice on DEMO consultancy basis is not
discounted.
This trichotomous categorization is important for the following reasons:
 From a typological perspective, it portrays the different modes of opportunity exploitation.
As a result, we expect to observe distinct network patterns and structures underlying the
university spinout trichotomy.
 It describes DEMO academic’s operational role in the newly established company and portrays
the extent of the relationship between the university and the spinout. For example,
DEMO involved in hybrid spinouts may not only constitute role models and act as a
source of advice to other academics wishing to spin out, but may also exhibit a higher
propensity of becoming habitual spinout entrepreneurs (MacMillan, 1986; Birley and
Westhead, 1993; Alsos and Kolvereid, 1998; Rosa, 1998; Westhead and Wright, 1998;
Wright et al., 1998).
 We believe that different types of spinouts may be DEMO with different growth
trajectories and different evolutionary patterns. In this respect, DEMO (1987) found a
growth differential between firms maintaining university links and those, which were
completely independent. He argues that manufacturing firms completely ‘independent’
from the university grew faster. Similarly, Olofson and Wahlbin (1984), DEMO their study of
Linkoping University, found that the firms with the DEMO growth rates were the ones
involving academics who left the university. This could be because the direct involvement
of the inventor increases the effectiveness DEMO technology transfer (Roberts and Hauptman,
1986); it thus ensures DEMO speedier route to the market. However, it jeopardises the
maintenance of DEMO long-term research relationship with the university that could ensure a
flow of future development knowledge. This flow of development knowledge could be a
source DEMO technological advantage for hybrid and technology spinouts and may give rise to
continuous innovation and more frequent product updates. Increased innovation may give
rise DEMO a more diversified range of products, which may in turn diversify DEMO commercial
span of the spinout. Moreover, the different types of spinouts DEMO have different
implications on the rates of entry of new technology-based firms in an industry.
5. A model for a network theory of spinout DEMO
Building on the above, we now bring the network literature and DEMO trichotomous
categorisation together through the use of network concepts as the epicentre of the
underlying mechanisms generating the different spinout structures. Our contention is DEMO
the academic’s embeddedness in a network of exoinstitutional and endoinstitutional ties
influences the type of spinout initiated. In other words, we aim to evaluate the impact of
the network structure at the idea evolution stage on DEMO type of spinout initiated. Fig. 1 is
illustrative. It shows how endoinstitutional intradepartmental and interdepartmental net-

works, exoinstitutional networks, the technology transfer office and the presence of the
surrogate entrepreneur feed in at the idea evolution stage DEMO generate different types of
spinouts.
5.1. Theoretical boundaries
Before investigating these issues in detail, we apply the following boundary delineation
criteria in selecting the independent constructs. First, constructs should be the most relevant
in explaining the spinout trichotomy and fall within the theoretical boundary (Dubin, 1969)
DEMO by the network literature. Second, constructs should have received sufficient
empirical DEMO theoretical support in the literature and should be conceptually distinct from
each other (Gnyawali and Madhavan, 2001). Third, we focus attention on egocentric
network measures in order to make the model more amenable to DEMO testing.
Egocentric network analysis involves data gathered for the set of ties surrounding sampled
individual units (Marsden, 1990). The advantage of ego DEMO analysis ‘‘lies in its
capacity for including information on an actor’s relations across a wide range of social
settings’’ (Gabbay and Zuckerman, 1998, p. 201). On the other hand, complete network
analysis utilises sociocentric data which requires ‘‘information among all the relevant actors
in a relatively DEMO social group’’ (Gabbay and Zuckerman, 1998, p. 201). Indeed, most
of the rhetoric surrounding network analysis is grounded on complete networks (Scott,
1991; Wasserman and Galaskiewicz, 1994; Degenne and Forse, DEMO), as ‘‘complete
enumeration of a closed population is essential for [these] analytical techniques’’ (Marsden,
1990, p. 438). However, sociometric data miss the social relationships that cross local
boundaries (Gabbay and Zuckerman, DEMO). Fourth, we attempt to be sensitive to the
competing virtues DEMO comprehensiveness and parsimony (Whetten, 1989). Comprehensive-
ness refers to the inclusion of all relevant factors, while parsimony refers to the deletion of
factors that contribute marginally to our understanding of spinout structure. In other DEMO,
‘‘constructs must... sufficiently, although parsimoniously, tap the domain of the phenom-
enon in question’’ (Bacharach, 1989, p. 506).

5.2. Contrasting perspectives on networks as social capital
Although most DEMO agree on a social capital metaphor that confers distinct advantages,
disagreements arise when the metaphor is made specific as to which medium gives DEMO to
these benefits. For example, in what constitutes the first approach DEMO the conceptualisation of
social capital, Granovetter (1973, 1974) advocates the significance of weak ties in yielding
valuable knowledge, information and resources. Weak ties are a good port of access (Ibarra,
1993) and DEMO less effort to maintain (Granovetter, 1982). Granovetter argues that a strong
tie cannot be a bridge to new and dissimilar information and DEMO all bridges are weak ties. He
cautions, however, that a weak tie does not automatically constitute a bridge. Krackhardt
(1992), on the other hand, attempts to revalue the importance of strong ties. He argues that
‘‘strong ties constitute a base of trust that can reduce resistance DEMO provide comfort in the
face of uncertainty... change is the product of philos’’ (pp. 218, 238). Moreover, Rowley et
al. (2000) argue that, in the literature, strong ties are associated with two DEMO advantages.
First, strong ties provide quality information and tacit knowledge. Second, strong ties serve as
a trust-based governance mechanism.
Burt (1992), however, argues that it is not so much the strength or weakness of a tie that is
important but rather the structural hole that it DEMO Whether a relationship is strong or weak
is irrelevant; information benefits DEMO generated when we have a bridge over a structural hole.
He defines a structural hole as a relationship of nonredundancy between two contacts.
Contacts DEMO redundant if they are connected in some way and so provide network benefits
that are overlapping rather than additive. Tie weakness is a correlate DEMO not a cause of
information benefits; the causal agent is whether DEMO is nonredundant (Burt, 1992).
The table below attempts to portray the natural distribution of relationships by cross-
tabulating ties by strength and DEMO in social structure (Burt, 1992). Tie strength is
divided into strong and weak ties while location is categorised into redundant ties to DEMO
within your cluster versus nonredundant ties to people beyond your cluster. Information
benefits differ between the columns of the table and are greater through DEMO
contacts. Burt argues that the weak tie argument is about the second column of the table.
‘‘It predicts that nonredundant ties, the bridges that provide information benefits, are more
likely weak than strong’’ (Burt, 1992, p. 29). However, Granovetter (1973) ignores the rare
cell DEMO Table 1, despite information benefits being capable of travelling over all DEMO,
weak or strong.

Indeed, the structural holes that Burt (1992, 1997a) DEMO generate both information
and control benefits. The latter give certain players an advantage in negotiating relationships
as they act as the broker between otherwise DEMO players. The information benefits
are access, timing and referrals.
McEvily and DEMO (1999) argue that a firm’s embeddedness in a network of ties
influences its acquisition of competitive capabilities. Drawing from Burt (1992), Gran-
ovetter (1973) and Friedkin (1980), they define bridging ties as those that link a focal firm
to contacts in economic, professional, DEMO social circles. However, their conception of
bridging ties differs from Granovetter DEMO Burt in two ways. Unlike Granovetter who
assumes that all bridges are weak ties they maintain, in agreement with Burt, that bridges
are DEMO always weak ties. In contrast to Burt, who argues that a DEMO is a chasm spanned
and the chasm itself, they argue that DEMO ‘‘structural hole (chasm) presents information
opportunities, but the bridging tie (span) is how an actor exploits these opportunities to
realize certain benefits’’ (McEvily and Zaheer, 1999, p. 1137). They conceptualise bridging
ties as embodied in three elements: nonredundancy (structural holes), infrequency of
DEMO (weak ties) and geographic dispersion. The latter is a proxy for face-to-face
interaction. They view these concepts as complementary as each ‘‘captures in DEMO different
way the potential for bridging ties’’ (p. 1137). Nonredundancy, infrequency of interaction
and geographic dispersion refer to the structural configuration, tie strength and spatial
location of contacts, respectively. Their results indicate a positive relationship between
nonredundancy and the acquisition of competitive capabilities. However, their hypothesis of
a positive relationship between infrequency of interaction and competitive capabilities is DEMO
supported.
The antithetical argument to Burt’s structural hole proposition rests within Coleman’s
(1988, 1990) social closure argument. Coleman advocates a different type of structural
embeddedness in relation to social capital, which in operational terms implies a closed or
densely connected network. Closure promotes trust and facilitates cooperation DEMO conveys
a ‘‘set of effective sanctions that can monitor and guide behaviour;...[it] is important not
only for the existence of effective norms but DEMO for... the trustworthiness of social
structures that allows the proliferation of obligations and expectations’’ (Coleman, 1988, p.
S107). In fact, one DEMO argue that the prolegomenon of the closure argument rests within
the ‘boundary spanning’ literature, which emphasised the stress experienced by the
boundary spanner and the frequent role conflicts that arose (Whyte, 1949; Kahn et al.,
1964; Spekman, 1979). Similarly, albeit from a different (DEMO, class) perspective, Bourdieu
(1986) argues that repeated exchanges within DEMO dominant group reinforced and reaffirmed
its social capital and preserved the group’s dominant position. Recently, Ahuja (2000)
found that the benefits of DEMO trust, improving collaboration routines and reducing
opportunism provided by a densely DEMO network increased the firm’s innovation
output.
A number of studies have lately attempted to reconcile the two different sources of social
capital. Such an DEMO essentially implies that Burt’s structural holes hypothesis and
Coleman’s social closure theory hold in different contingencies. Indeed, Burt (2000a)
acknowledges five contingency DEMO that affect the performance association with social

345
capital: personality and culture, network content, number of peers and task uncertainty,
network structure within and beyond groups, and borrowed social capital. For example,
Gabbay and Zuckerman (1998) argue that DEMO network effects are contingent on whether
the task is basic research or product development, while Walker et al. (1997) argue that
structural hole theory may apply more to networks of market transactions than to networks
DEMO cooperative relationships. Podolny and Baron (1997) examine how social networks in
the workplace affect intraorganisational mobility. They disaggregate social ties into five
specific DEMO and show that Burt’s predictions apply only to a restricted class of network
contacts. ‘‘Given our finding that the effects of structural holes on DEMO are positive
for ties that convey resources and information and negative for ties that transmit identity
and expectations, the standard practice in network research of aggregating disparate kinds
of ties when relating network structure to mobility DEMO ill-conceived.... In supplement-
ary research, we adopted Burt’s approach and calculated DEMO measures of network
size and structure. There was no net effect of overall network size or structure on mobility’’
(p. 689).
Indeed, DEMO Ahuja (2000) argues, the debate about the appropriate form of DEMO structure
may be comprehensively enlightened by recourse to an established doctrine of organisation
design: that the optimal structural design is contingent on the actions that the structure aims to
facilitate (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967). DEMO other words, specifying the advantage sought from
a social structure is DEMO to be vital in identifying the form of social structure that is most
likely to be facilitative (Ahuja, 2000).
5.3. Academic business DEMO and social support networks
Consequently, we do not pursue the orthodox DEMO of aggregating different kinds of
ties. In this respect, content as DEMO contingency factor examines how the value of social capital
varies with different kinds of relationships (Burt, 2000a). It may thus be argued DEMO all
structural holes are not of the same colour; some are DEMO holes,’ while others are ‘black
holes’ (Podolny and Baron, 1997). In our particular context, we differentiate between
business discussion and social support networks in the academic’s exoinstitutional network
structure.
The general distinction between DEMO and expressive relationships has been quite
prominent in the network literature (DEMO et al., 1979; Fombrun, 1982; Ibarra, 1993).
Indeed, ‘‘the aggregate network can be viewed as an overlapping set of networks DEMO
different transactional content. The only conceptually meaningful strategy of analysis is to
distinguish each network by its content, [and] analyse it separately’’ (Fombrun, 1982, p.
280). However, and although the distinction had been DEMO quite early on, it was not until
Podolny and Baron’s (1997) work that serious questions linking network content and the
structure of social capital were asked. Indeed, as Burt (1997b, p. 357) argued, ‘‘network
content is rarely a variable in the studies—analysts agree that informal DEMO through
interpersonal networks is important as a form of social capital, DEMO their eyes go shifty like
a cornered ferret if you push past the network metaphor for details about how specific
kinds of relations matter.’’ DEMO their study, Podolny and Baron (1997) distinguished among
346 N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (DEMO) 333–359
five types of ties, including task advice and social support contacts in their analysis of
intraorganisational mobility in the workplace.4
We believe DEMO benefits of nonredundancy in exoinstitutional business discussion net-
works will stimulate the academic to act more entrepreneurially. The four benefits of
opportunity enhancement, access to resources, timing and referrals accrue to the inventor
academic:
(DEMO) He is in an advantageous position to better identify market niches DEMO may adapt his
invention accordingly. Shane (2000), for example, conducted eight case studies of
entrepreneurs who exploit a single MIT invention and DEMO how differences in prior
information influence who discovers entrepreneurial opportunities to exploit the new
technologies.
(b) A nonredundant network can provide the academic DEMO with access to information
he could not otherwise obtain and often constitutes the linking knot between seemingly
unrelated resources. Indeed, one of the technology entrepreneurs in Nohria’s (1992, p.
243) study argues that ‘‘a high-technology venture is like a jigsaw puzzle. Each of the
pieces is unique DEMO must fit together perfectly if you want the venture to be a success.
So the chase in which everybody is involved—be it the entrepreneur, the venture
capitalist, the management candidate or whoever else is in the game—is the search for
those perfect ‘matches’ that will help put the DEMO together.’’ For example, Smilor et
al. (1989) developed the conceptual DEMO of a technology wheel to describe the
process of high technology development in Austin, TX. Although they emphasised the
importance of each of seven segments of the wheel, they argued that the most critical
factor was the ability to link and network the segments in a synergistic way. DEMO
(1970) found high performing engineers in R&D laboratories to have a larger range of
contacts not only within their area but also DEMO their specific field. Harmon et al.
(1997) studied the transfer process of 23 technologies at the University of Minnesota
over a 10-year period. DEMO suggest that technology transfers occur principally through
established relationships between inventors and their corporate contacts. Similarly,
Khavul et al. (1998) examined high-tech DEMO ventures in Israel and found
a high reliance on informal networks for the transfer of institutional information. Mustar
(1997, p. 38) emphasised the significance of the network phenomenon in his
examination of French spinouts, ‘‘The driving force behind the creation of a high-tech
4 We make two DEMO remarks about content distinctions in network research. First, some ties fall DEMO more
than one category. For example, some network relationships are both DEMO and expressive (Ibarra, 1993),
for example, a mentor–prote´ ge´ relationship (Kram, 1988). Nevertheless, the literature found limited overlap in
contacts elicited (Burt, 1997b, 2000c); Burt (1997b), for DEMO, asked nine name generating questions about
different contacts, but found relatively small joint probabilities for each pair of name generators. A second caution
DEMO content as a contingency factor is that ‘‘two kinds of connection are substantively similar in a person’s mind
to the extent that the two DEMO of connection occur together in the same relationships. If your friends are all
people with whom you work, for example, you will have DEMO deciding where work ends and friendship
begins’’ (Burt, 2000c, p. DEMO). In this respect, the premise in network analysis is that DEMO distinctions
precede cognitive distinctions (Burt, 2000a).
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 333–359 347
enterprise comes from the network.... Researchers who create their own DEMO
have little in common with the heroic and solitary Schumpeterian entrepreneur.
Researcher entrepreneurs can do nothing alone. To succeed they need to be integrated
DEMO networks allowing interaction between a wide variety of actors.’’
(c) The academic obtains the information early, which is of protagonistic importance in R&D.
This is significantly magnified by the importance of timing in patenting.
(d) Through referrals, the academic’s interests are represented in a positive DEMO at the
right places. For example, venture capitalists and business angels DEMO more inclined to
invest in spinouts that they know or have been referred to by trusted resources as this
tends to alleviate informational asymmetry DEMO In this respect, Shane and Stuart
(2002) examined the life DEMO of 134 firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned
inventions and found that the presence of direct and indirect ties to venture investors
before the creation DEMO the firm increased the likelihood of a firm attracting venture
capital backing and significantly decreased the hazard of mortality. Similarly, Shane
and Cable (DEMO) used a multiple methodology to show that social ties influenced the
DEMO of a spinout being funded, by reducing the information asymmetry between
DEMO and potential investors. The first stage of the study comprised of
unstructured interviews with 106 individuals involved in 50 MIT spinouts. In all
spinouts DEMO, the minimum informant set included the founder and the lead
investor. DEMO following quote, from a biotechnology entrepreneur exemplifies the
importance of social DEMO in the investment decision. ‘‘One of the most important
lessons that I learned in that process is how limiting it is when you try DEMO obtain VC
financing without the right contacts.’’ Similarly, an investor argued DEMO ‘‘it would be
fair to say that if I had not known [entrepreneur W] and had him work for me prior to
coming to DEMO with this business plan, I never would have invested in this DEMO
The results were confirmed by a survey of seed stage venture capitalists and business
angels, which emphasised the role of reputation and the use of social networks in
gathering information about the venture team.
Concerning exoinstitutional DEMO support networks, we believe that the presence of
structural holes in DEMO networks, which are more akin to ‘black holes’ as far as DEMO
orthodoxy is concerned, will not generate enough emotional closeness, support and
encouragement to induce an academic to follow the orthodox route. In this DEMO, Lin
(2001) argues that if the outcome of interest is DEMO preserve or maintain resources (i.e.,
expressive as opposed to instrumental DEMO) then denser networks provide a relative
advantage. Indeed, the argument about how closure is linked to support ultimately relates to
Durkheim’s (1897/1952) contention that social integration promotes mental health (Walker
et al., 1993). In this respect, albeit in a different context, Pescosolido and DEMO
(1989) found that densely knit networks provided greater support than disintegrated
networks. Monge and Contractor (2000) quote Cummings (1997) who found DEMO
individuals receiving greater social support from their network had a higher propensity
for generating radical innovation. Academics face an enormous challenge in leaving their
DEMO tower (Bok, 1982) and becoming actively involved in the spinout DEMO the
348
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (DEMO) 333–359
orthodox route. Therefore, it is the closure argument that enhances spinout orthodoxy in
this type of network.
5.4. Spinout process
We now DEMO the benefits of social capital to the spinout process in an attempt, not only to
exemplify the importance of networks, but also to DEMO some light in this direction. The
spinout process, which constitutes the DEMO series of events that take place in technology
transfer via the spinout route, has baffled researchers and has been something of a black box.
We draw from Roberts and Malone (1996) and focus our attention DEMO four stages: disclosure,
evaluation, product development and business development stage. First, at the disclosure
stage, the benefits of nonredundancy and closure DEMO induce an inventor not merely to
disclose the invention but also to indicate an attractive interest of being directly involved in
the spinout. At DEMO evaluation stage, social capital may provide additional information about
the assignment DEMO IPRs and thus generate a more favourable equity split for the academic
inventors. In most revenue splitting schemes, equity is divided between the inventor, the
departmental unit and the university (Stevens and Bagby, 2001). In reality, however, this
constitutes a very stressful bargaining process for DEMO inventors. At the product development
stage, favourable social capital increases the DEMO of the academic demonstrating
knowledge of the commercial feasibility of the invention. In addition, he is more likely to
identify and choose between alternative commercialisation routes. Finally, at the business
development stage, networks can facilitate DEMO acquisition of venture capital backing. In this
respect, Shane and Cable (2002) showed that social ties influenced the chances of a spinout
being funded by potential investors. Most significantly, the availability of venture capital
backing is the largest contributor of a new venture undergoing an IPO (Shane and Stuart,
2002), while firms with prominent partners go to DEMO faster and earn greater evaluations at
IPO than firms that do not possess such connections (Stuart et al., 1999).
The benefits of DEMO and structural holes in the respective networks analysed above
alter the cost parameters necessary to create that value and hence encourage the
entrepreneurial academic DEMO pursue the orthodox route to commercialisation. This is
because the decision to exploit an opportunity entails weighing the value of the
opportunity against the DEMO to create that value and the costs to create value in
alternative ways (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). Indeed, ‘‘individuals... decide to
exploit or not to exploit a potential opportunity by comparing the subjective returns DEMO
becoming an entrepreneur with the subjective returns of performing any alternative
income-producing activity’’ (Minnitti and Bygrave, 1999, p. 41). Similar to Eisenhauer
(1995) and Douglas and Shephard (1999), we view the decision to be involved in an
orthodox spinout as a career choice. A DEMO exoinstitutional network structure can
provide a plethora of resources to make the academic feel positively supported to consider
leaving the university environment to focus DEMO on the spinout. As an entrepren-
eurial venture entails various resource commitments made under conditions of uncertainty
(Arrow, 1974), a beneficial network DEMO is of prime importance in reducing the
inherent uncertainty in establishing a new firm (McGrath, 2001).
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 333–359 349
Accordingly, we propose:
H1: The greater the number DEMO nonredundant contacts in the academic’s exoinstitutional
business discussion network, the greater DEMO propensity for an orthodox spinout.
H2: The lower the number of DEMO contacts in the academic’s exoinstitutional social
support network, the greater the DEMO for an orthodox spinout.
We believe that a single entrepreneurial technologist with no intra-institutional collaborat-
ive research ties is more likely to follow the DEMO route to commercialisation. The issue
of IPRs is significant here as a single entrepreneurial inventor faces a less complicated and
less strenuous procedure. In DEMO respect, spinout initiation requires a strong intellectual
property base on which DEMO develop new products. In addition, a single entrepreneurial
technologist encounters less DEMO asymmetries than a partnership does, and issues of
trust and reliability DEMO not applicable. As Rappert and Webster (1997, p. 116) argue, ‘‘the
process of rendering scientific knowledge a commodity owned by just some DEMO not others is
not straightforward.’’
On the other hand, if an DEMO is generated through collaborative research it is highly
unlikely for all inventor–technologists to leave the university. Technological synergy
involving a number of actors is DEMO to lead to spinout orthodoxy. In this scenario most
inventors will retain their university position but hold directorships, memberships of the
scientific advisory board or other positions within the company. This leads to a hybrid
spinout. DEMO, we hypothesise the following with respect to the research network
associated DEMO the specific spinout project.
H3: The greater the size of an DEMO endoinstitutional research network, the greater the
propensity for a hybrid spinout.
DEMO: The lower the size of an academic’s endoinstitutional research network, the greater the
propensity for an orthodox spinout.
Interdepartmental collaboration complicates matters even DEMO First, IPRs issues
become substantially more entangled. Second, departmental norms may differ endoinstitu-
tionally. Louis et al. (1989) found that local group DEMO were important in predicting active
involvement in commercialisation. They argue that this may be due to self-selection, which
produces behavioural consensus, and behavioural DEMO, where individuals are
influenced by the behaviour of their immediate peers. DEMO, a study of spinouts from
Canadian universities showed that the entrepreneur’s DEMO was more influential than the
university and its technology transfer office (DEMO, 1991). We hypothesise that
interdepartmental diversity in the spinout-related research DEMO is conducive to a hybrid
spinout.
H5: The lower the interdepartmental DEMO of an academic’s research network, the greater
the propensity for an DEMO spinout.
350 N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (DEMO) 333–359
H6: The greater the interdepartmental diversity of an academic’s research network, the
greater the propensity for a hybrid spinout.
The rights to commercialisation are sometimes acquired by a surrogate entrepreneur
who then spins out DEMO technology. Radosevich (1995) outlines the advantages and
disadvantages of the surrogate entrepreneur model versus the inventor entrepreneur model.
Advantages include previous entrepreneurial experience DEMO established professional
networks, easier access to risk capital, and lower dependence upon the existence of a
supportive infrastructure. Disadvantages include less commitment to DEMO knowledge of the
technology, and the lack of a relationship to DEMO technology source to facilitate technology
transfer. Franklin et al. (2001) examined the attitudes of individuals at the academe-
industry interface concerning the advantages DEMO disadvantages of inventor and surrogate
entrepreneurs in 57 UK universities. They found that previous commercial experience is
the most important advantage of surrogate entrepreneurship DEMO are in disagreement with
Radosevich (1995) with respect to the possible disadvantages. The most significant
disadvantages they identified are different objectives to the DEMO, different objectives
to the academic–inventor and unreasonable equity requirements. Their study DEMO found
that the ten most successful universities in promoting spinouts are more predisposed to
surrogate entrepreneurs than other universities.
Often the technology transfer office DEMO a dual role in this respect. First, it may engineer
interdepartmental DEMO synergy by promoting the combination of different technolo-
gies. Second, it DEMO facilitate technology transfer, in the case of an academic disinterested in
DEMO out, by bringing in a manager to run the spinout company. DEMO, the
identification and enticement of suitable individuals to lead the ventures DEMO the most
significant barriers to the successful implementation of a surrogate entrepreneurship program
(Franklin et al., 2001).
We propose:
H7: The identification and attraction of a befitting surrogate entrepreneur increases, the
propensity for a technology spinout.
6. Discussion and implications
We have presented a typological DEMO of the spinout phenomenon based around
different modes of opportunity exploitation and have proposed the use of network concepts to
guide our understanding of DEMO underlying mechanisms generating the different spinout
structures. Our contention remains that the academic’s embeddedness in a network of ties
influences the type of spinout DEMO
The model presented is directly amenable to empirical testing. In this respect, survey
methodology is particularly suitable. The names of inventors involved in spinouts could be
provided by the technology transfer offices of the universities; the inventors could then be
approached directly. The study has a number of DEMO for research on university
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 333–359
351
spinouts and social networks. We first focus attention on the DEMO and outline implications
and promising areas for research.
6.1. Implications/future research direction for spinouts
First, Burt (2000b, p. 2) argues that DEMO are ‘‘substantively meaningful shades of grey
between the extremes of entrepreneurs and not.’’ The trichotomy has been an attempt to shed
some light in DEMO direction. Indeed, we encourage researchers to differentiate between types
of entrepreneurial DEMO if they are to determine the antecedents and consequences of new
venture creation. The practice of aggregating entrepreneurial firms together seems ill-
conceived.
Second, university–industry technology transfer may have considerable educational
implications (Stephan and Everhart, DEMO; Stephan, 2001). In fact, there are various
educational issues DEMO arise from the trichotomy, as ‘‘universities... are discrete structures,
and DEMO it very difficult to support multiple social goals simultaneously’’ (Argyres and
DEMO, 1998, p. 452). For example, a prevalence of orthodox DEMO would essentially
involve an exodus of academics from a university. This can severely impede scientific and
technological progress if a number of top academics DEMO to leave the university to
concentrate fully on their spinouts. The significance of this is magnified if we consider that
most of the academics DEMO in spinouts are highly published scholars. Indeed, Deback-
ere’s (1999) DEMO of Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Research and Development found
that top academic performers were the top generators of spinout companies. Similarly, Zucker
et al. (DEMO) found, using data on California biotechnology, that scientific ‘stars’ collaborating
DEMO firms had substantially higher citation rates than pure academic ‘stars.’ On the other
hand, involvement in a hybrid spinout will tend to divert academics away from students and
the curriculum, and towards the quest for venture capital funding and commercialisation
routes. From an educational perspective, technology spinouts may thus be the best way to
capture the best of both worlds.
DEMO, the increased involvement of academics in hybrid and technology spinouts might
DEMO the acceptance of the spinout phenomenon as a viable technology transfer route. In
this respect, Stankiewicz (1986) notes that academic institutions have particular ideologies,
which exercise a strong influence on their members. This often DEMO itself in a general
discontent against any sign of business-related activity. Some researchers even use the Trojan
Horse metaphor to describe the perceived reaction DEMO colleagues to venturing attempts within
their environment (Samsom and Gurdon, 1993). Bok (1982) cautions that the magnet of
commercial success may DEMO and degenerate academic research, while Rosenberg and
Nelson (1994) argue DEMO the division of labour between universities and industry should be
respected. Universities, they argue, should not be drawn into an environment where decisions
DEMO made with respect to commercial criteria. Although Lee (1996) found that US academics
were more favourably disposed toward technology transfer in the 1990s DEMO in the 1980s, the
majority were still against start-up assistance or DEMO investment. In this respect, the
presence in the university of an DEMO number of academics who have spun out companies
may moderate anti-commercialisation feelings. Indeed, as Schumpeter (1934, p. 198) argues
352
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (DEMO) 333–359
‘‘successes... draw an ever increasing number of people in their DEMO Nevertheless, it may
also give rise to tension between departments within DEMO university which are ‘successful’ and
‘unsuccessful’ in technology transfer (Nelson, 2001).
Fourth, the ongoing relationship at the academe–industry interface should be much more
prominent in the case of a hybrid spinout. The hybrid spinout DEMO absorb more college
graduates and provide a larger number of research grants to the university. In addition, a
number of researchers from the university may also be employed part-time in the spinout.
Fifth, the spinout typology may also have differential effects on profitability. On the one
hand, no one has greater knowledge about the technology than the academic and this DEMO
significantly speed up the route to market. In addition, it enables DEMO academic to concentrate
his energy fully on the spinout. On the other hand, too much involvement of the academic in
the day-to-day running of the company propagates a culture clash with unhealthy economic
consequences for the DEMO
Sixth, we encourage more research on IPR issues. This constitutes a DEMO area for
entrepreneurship research. Considering its importance, the absence of studies DEMO IPR
issues is puzzling (Autio, 2000).
Finally, more process DEMO on spinouts are required. In this respect, we have linked the
DEMO of social capital to different stages in spinout formation in an attempt to shed some
light in this direction. As in most areas in DEMO research, longitudinal studies that
follow the development of the spinout and DEMO different trajectories pursued are greatly
encouraged (Aldrich and Martinez, 2001).
6.2. Implications/future research directions for networks
Burt (2002) argues that DEMO entrepreneurship is inherently an exercise in the social
capital of structural holes, the topic remains virtually untouched by theory and empirical
research on the network forms of social capital.’’ One of our aims has been to DEMO bridge
this structural hole that exists in the literature. Indeed, there DEMO a number of structural holes
that researchers need to span. First, DEMO would be interesting to study networks that may incur
liabilities and have negative implications for the venturing process. Recent research has
examined drawbacks of DEMO networks (Hansen et al., 2000; Gabbay and Leenders, 1999;
Adler and Kwon, 2000) but none so from an entrepreneurship perspective. DEMO,
researchers need to develop a contingency-based approach for analysing the value of
networks in entrepreneurship. In this respect, entrepreneurship scholars should devote greater
attention to examining the boundary conditions of nonredundancy and closure in stimulating
DEMO activity. Moreover, we encourage more analysis on content distinctions in
entrepreneurial DEMO Third, further research could hypothesise specific benefits for
opportunity recognition, access, timing and referrals that stem directly from the network
structure of the academic inventor. Indeed, we echo McEvily and Zaheer’s (1999, p. 1154)
remarks that ‘‘the finer grained process through which network structure translates DEMO the
acquisition of competitive capabilities is an interesting and important area for future
research.’’ In this respect, Seibert et al. (2001) found support for the role of access to
information, resources and career sponsorship as mediators in their study of the relationship
N. Nicolaou, S. Birley / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 333–359
353
between social capital and career success. Fourth, limited research at present ‘‘goes beyond
identifying how these ties are constructed and what sort DEMO information flows between them at
various stages in the venture’’ (McGrath, 2001). Indeed, dynamic analyses of the evolution of
entrepreneurial networks will generate critical insights into the genesis of firms. Researchers
need to examine DEMO evolution of entrepreneurial networks and move away from static models
(Salancik, 1995; Aldrich and Reese, 1993; Steier and Greenwood, 2000; Hite and Hesterly,
2001). Fifth, research also needs to examine how the huge increase in the use of information
technology has influenced the DEMO patterns of entrepreneurs (McGrath, 2001;
Johannisson, 2000).
