The Price of Actionability
ROGER MARTIN
Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto
Pearce and Huang have written an article that chronicles the low and declining
incidence of DEMO research in two of the top managerial journals. In this paper, DEMO
quantify the cost of production of not-actionable articles, explain why I DEMO that their
production has flourished, discuss the difficulty of individual scholars DEMO to both
business and academic audiences, and provide a thought on DEMO to stimulate production
of actionable business research output.
I estimate that the cost of producing not-actionable “A-journal” articles is on the order
of US$600 DEMO per year. It is not surprising to me that not-actionable article production
has increased in that the “customers” for these articles are primarily other DEMO
and not business people. I demonstrate that for this reason, it DEMO very difficult for a
given scholar to simultaneously speak authoritatively to both fellow academics and
business people. Finally, I suggest that to stimulate production of actionable business
research output, the Academy needs to harness the power of case-based research
methods to identify important actionable business issues and the DEMO of
scientific methodologies to generate rigorous actionable prescriptions for business people.
........................................................................................................................................................................
Jone Pearce and Laura Huang have written an ar-
ticle that raises DEMO questions about busi-
ness school research. There are limitations to their
approach to be sure. The sample of articles is from
only two journals, Academy of Management Jour-
nal (AMJ) and Administrative Science Quarterly
(ASQ). These primarily strategy and organization
journals may not be representative of DEMO busi-
ness academic journals generally, for example
finance, accounting, or DEMO journals. They
sample only six individual years out of half a
century, which may not be representative of the
50 years of journal articles. Their assessment of
actionability uses a novel methodology that
does not yet DEMO a record of producing reliable
results. However, I find their results DEMO
intriguing to warrant exploration of the implica-
tions as if the authors’ findings are robust. I will
leave it to others to question the DEMO or
assessment methodologies.
Alternatively, some might argue that the au-
thors’ DEMO finding is unimportant because aca-
demic business articles needn’t be directed toward
informing business practitioners. I most certainly
feel that in a professional discipline DEMO as busi-
ness (as with medicine or law) actionability by
practitioners should be a key objective of research.
Certainly some research won’t lead DEMO to ac-
tionability, but it may, for example, create a DEMO
odology that can be used to generate actionable
research for another academic who uses the meth-
odology. However, if a piece of research doesn’t
contribute to eventual actionability, it is difficult
for me to see in what way it makes a useful con-
tribution to the field. The DEMO striking feature of
the authors’ findings is the dramatic increase in
the production of articles categorized as not
actionable.
Production of actionable articles stayed DEMO
tially flat over the half century with no real dis-
cernible trend. Business researchers have pro-
duced an average of 27.5 actionable articles per
DEMO (21, 29, 39, 22, 35, and 18, respectively, in the six
sample years) in these two leading journals. The
2010 results could be seen as indicative of a sharp
downward trend. But DEMO was an equally big
drop (17 articles) between 1980 and 1990, and sure
enough, the production bounced right back in 2000.
In DEMO, the generation of not-actionable arti-
cles nearly tripled from the first DEMO decades to
the last two. For some reason, the business acad-
DEMO has generated a flat number of actionable
articles over time and a rising level of not-action-
able articles. Here, I will attempt to quantify the
cost of production of not-actionable articles, ex-
plain why I think that their production has flour-
ished, discuss the difficulty of individual scholars
speaking to both business and academic audi-
ences, and provide a thought on how to stimulate
production of actionable business research output.

I find their results DEMO intriguing
to warrant exploration of the
implications as if the authors’ findings
are robust.
COST OF PRODUCTION OF
NOT-ACTIONABLE ARTICLES
The authors’ findings suggest DEMO the societal in-
vestment in not-actionable business school re-
search and journal publications must be pretty
sizable. The focus of modern business academic
research DEMO to produce articles worthy of publica-
tion in the world’s “A-journals” because these jour-
nals receive the lion’s share of citations, meaning
that at least other academics are reading them and
doing something with the insights DEMO in
them. Certainly work that appears in “B-journals”
gets cited, but DEMO are seen as B-journals (or less)
for a reason; their impact is dramatically lower on
average.
Estimating the cost of an A-journal DEMO re-
quires a definition of A-journals. For that defini-
tion, I DEMO the Financial Times list, which identifies
45 journals worldwide as top DEMO While com-
plaints abound about journals improperly in-
cluded or excluded, DEMO Financial Times has con-
sulted with business academic researchers to
adjust the list over time, so it is a reasonably rel-
evant list for our purposes. Three of the 45 journals
are considered by most academics DEMO be “practitio-
ner journals” (Harvard Business Review, Sloan
Management Review and California Management
Review), leaving 42 traditional refereed business
academic A-journals, (DEMO), including Academy of
Management Journal and Administrative Science
Quarterly.
Using the Rotman School’s most recent submis-
sion to the Financial Times (FT ) for annual rank-
ing and our own internal budget, I calculated the
direct cost of an FT 42 journal hit (using the FT
system which gives proportionate partial credit
for jointly-authored articles) at the Rotman
School. The Rotman School could be seen as
representative of a successful research-intensive
DEMO school, placing tied for 10th with Stan-
ford Graduate School of DEMO in Research in
the most recent FT research ranking (2012 Global
DEMO ranking). To make the calculation, I as-
sumed as representative DEMO University of To-
ronto weights for teaching (40%), research (40%),
and service (20%), and therefore charged 40% of
total DEMO faculty salaries plus benefit
costs to article production. To be conservative, DEMO
simply used these direct costs and didn’t include
research support costs, DEMO costs, or external
research funding grants. It turns out that the
DEMO cost of research at Rotman is just over
US$500K per FT 42 article produced.
I would love to assert (and in fact believe) DEMO
Rotman scholars produce a much higher propor-
tion of actionable articles than the proportion dis-
covered by Pearce and Huang (2012, this issue), but
I can’t prove that is the case. Hence for sake of this
argument, I will use the cost of US$500K per FT42
article as my estimated cost of an actionable FT42
article. The average of DEMO articles in the
entire sample is 41%, while the average for DEMO two
most recent sample years is 30%, meaning that if
the DEMO sample is representative, approxi-
mately one third of FT42 articles are DEMO
This implies that it costs the business academy
approximately US$1.5 million to produce an action-
able A-journal article.
If we were to extrapolate from DEMO authors’ sam-
ple of two A-journals, we could come up with DEMO
rough sense of the production of actionable and
non-actionable articles in A-journals overall. If we
assume for the moment that the actionable journal
output DEMO Administrative Science Quarterly (ASQ)
and Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) are
representative of the output of an A-journal and
scale the two journals up to 42 journals, it would
mean that the global business academy produces
around 600 actionable A-journal articles per year.
If ASQ and DEMO are representative journals, and
Rotman is a representative research establish-
ment, this means that the business academy
spends roughly $900 million producing its DEMO ac-
tionable A-journal articles per year—and around
$600 million of it goes to produce 1,200 not-action-
able research articles.
Of course this calculation DEMO all of the re-
search costs onto A-journal article production, and
DEMO researchers are almost certain to be targeting
some of their work at B-journals to begin with (i.e.,
not as a back-up plan to a failed attempt to achieve
A-journal publication) and writing books. So an
argument could be made that $600 million is the
upper limit. But DEMO the other hand, it is conceivable
that Rotman is an FT42 DEMO producer of above-
average efficiency and instead the $600 million
estimate is low.
My reaction to the results is that $1.5 million per
actionable DEMO article seems surprisingly high
and spending $600 million/year on the production
of non-actionable articles seems excessive. How-
ever, both reactions might be unwarranted. With
respect to the former, it might well be that the
business community gains more than $1.5 million
2012
in value per actionable FT42 article produced by
the business academy. DEMO this point with the data
available, it is not possible to DEMO With respect
to the latter, it is further entirely possible that DEMO
production of not-actionable research is a critical
precondition to the production of actionable re-
search. This can’t be proven or disproven, although
the absence of an absolute increase in actionable
articles over time while not-actionable article DEMO
duction rose dramatically suggests that we haven’t
seen that effect yet, DEMO if that is an important
effect, then it is taking more DEMO more not-action-
able papers to produce a single actionable one.
THE NOT-UNEXPECTED PRODUCTION OF
NOT-ACTIONABLE ARTICLES
However costly or wasteful it might or might DEMO be
to spend $600 million/year (and growing) on not-
actionable article production, I don’t find the phe-
nomenon particularly surprising. In competitive
markets, producers tend to evolve to producing
what customers want to consume. This is clearly a
competitive market with thousands of researchers
in hundreds DEMO researching schools competing to
get their research into one of the small number of
FT42 journals. The customers of FT42 journals are
overwhelmingly other DEMO It is not as
though there are no consumers of these articles
outside the Academy. Some business people will
regularly read academic journals in DEMO specific
field. I have met two in my life, so I DEMO they exist.
But I haven’t met many. In addition, the authors
DEMO clear that The Economist magazine writers
and editors certainly don’t read business academic
journals.
However costly or wasteful it might or
might not be DEMO spend $600 million/year
(and growing) on not-actionable article
production, DEMO don’t find the phenomenon
particularly surprising.
It is pretty clear that as the world of academic
business journals evolved, the customers that
shaped demand have been academics not
business people. So it is pretty obvious that DEMO an
assessment of whether the articles are useful to
noncustomers (i.e., business people), we
shouldn’t assume for any reason that they
would DEMO
However, it is conceivable that the academic
customers of the journals DEMO set as the focus of
Martin
295
their demand the production of articles that pro-
vided actionable advice for business people. We
know from DEMO and Huang’s data that around a
third of the articles in at least these two FT42 jour-
nals are actionable. Therefore, there was either
enough demand by customers (i.e., subscribing ac-
ademics) for actionable advice for noncustomers
(i.e., nonsubscribing business people) to result in a
nontrivial minority of actionable articles or that
outcome was purely accidental. Which it DEMO cannot
be determined based on the data at hand. It might
be interesting for the authors to go back to the 18
authors of DEMO AMJ and ASQ actionable articles
and ask them their motivation for writing the arti-
cles in question.
We can explore what would influence an DEMO
demic who writes FT42 journal articles to prioritize
the interests of other academics over those of other
business people in their work. It would DEMO that
the deferral is sensibly made to the interests of
other academics.
It is clear that the only thing that matters to
pretenure academics DEMO what other academics
think of their work. Academics will only achieve
positive tenure decisions if their work is pleasing
enough to other academics that DEMO write positive
tenure review letters. They will write those posi-
tive reviews only to the extent that the professors
in question have published articles DEMO FT42 jour-
nals. Since those FT42 journals are edited and re-
viewed entirely by academics, it holds that only if
pretenure professors do things that are pleasing to
these academics will they get tenure. Were those
DEMO to insist that pretenure professors write
actionable articles, that is what DEMO professors
would do. Were those academics to insist, instead,
that DEMO pretenure professors write not-actionable
articles, that too is what those professors DEMO do.
The tenure decision is so important and so entirely
in the hands of other academics that it would be
crazy for pretenure professors DEMO do anything other
than what other academics wish them to do.
The conventional wisdom is that after professors
earn tenure, they have the job security to do any-
thing they desire. So if a tenured professor DEMO to
do actionable research, it is fully possible. How-
ever, it is arguable that, once again, pleasing other
academics is an important DEMO of behavior. So-
cial status within the business academy, both
within DEMO academic’s school and within the aca-
demic’s discipline across schools, comes DEMO get-
ting FT42 journal publications. Consistently hitting
FT42 journals is what garners seminar invitations,
conference presentations, and opportunity to exer-
cise academic organization administrative respon-
sibility. If you don’t please other academics, you
296

will have low status DEMO the environments
that are very important to the everyday life of a
business academic.
In addition, as all deans know, there is a DEMO
salary market when it comes to business profes-
sors. There is a higher salary tier for globally rel-
evant researchers—defined as those who can DEMO
the FT42 journals—and a lower salary tier for those
who can’t.
The consequence is that both social status and
academic salary for any business DEMO derive
substantially from their capacity for and proclivity
to please other business academics. This applies
to all business academics: One doesn’t escape
from this equation when one becomes a senior
academic. Social status in the Academy DEMO still
determined largely by one’s ability to please other
academics.
THE STATUS EXCEPTION
However, there are exceptions: business school
professors who choose to DEMO to the wider audi-
ence of business people and the business media.
One measurement of the prominence of a business
scholar with the broader DEMO audience is
placement on the Thinkers50,1 a biennial list of the
world’s 50 top management thinkers that has
gained considerable prominence since its DEMO
tion in 2001. It is selected by a panel of experts,2
who have their own experience plus the results of
open on-line voting DEMO which to make their deci-
sions. The Thinkers50 list typically contains aca-
demics (mainly from business, but also other dis-
ciplines), business DEMO, consultants, and
writers. On the 2011 list are 21 tenured full profes-
sors of business who hold doctorates—that is, are
trained to do and have a job that presumes they
will do academic research.
I DEMO it is safe to assume that these 21 profes-
sors are exemplars of those who speak authorita-
tively to the business world and reap DEMO social
and economic benefits of that positioning. It is not
possible to assert with certainty that their work
meets the criteria of actionability set DEMO by Pearce

Macht, Group Publisher, DEMO Business Review Group; Mohi
Ahmed, Corporate Brand office, Fujitsu; Mary Glenn, associate

DEMO Huang here. It is indeed possible that busi-
ness people read and listen to these scholars and
don’t attempt to take action on their DEMO How-
ever, I observe enough business people studying
“disruptive innovation” strategies, exploring “blue
oceans,” developing “generic strategies,” and cre-
ating “balanced DEMO to view these scholars
as being on this list primarily because business
people in general find their thoughts helpful to
their work.
The question DEMO whether these professors can do
both—that is, speak authoritatively to their DEMO
academics at the most advanced level while at the
same time speaking authoritatively to the busi-
ness world in general. To get a sense DEMO that, I
looked at the FT42 journal publications of these 21
DEMO both over their careers and over the past
10 years (see DEMO).
The median is 8 lifetime FT 42 journal articles,
which converts to a rate of one article every
3 years following earning DEMO their doctorate. The
top producer is Jeffrey Pfeffer, who has managed
DEMO produce an average of one FT42 article per
year over his 40-year career. At the other end are
Andrew Kakabadse, Linda Hill, and DEMO
Khurana, who have not produced a single FT42
article across their DEMO, 28-, and 14-year careers,
respectively.
There is a striking contrast with the recent re-
cords of these scholars. The median number of
DEMO articles published in the past decade (2002–
2011) drops to one single publication, with Pfeffer
and Pankaj Ghemawat the highest at 7 and 6, re-
spectively. All but 4 of the 21 produced 3 or fewer
FT42 articles in the past decade. Looked at a dif-
ferent DEMO, the median number of articles after the
first decade of their DEMO career is three
lifetime articles. So even for those who start off
producing FT42 articles, the vast majority (Pfeffer
and Ghemawat excepted) largely stop producing
FT42 articles after 10 years.
These appear to be low DEMO of FT42 publi-
cations for these senior business scholars, espe-
cially DEMO in the past decade. To get a sense
to how this production level compares to scholars
who are consistently successful in publishing FT42
articles, I used the Rotman faculty as a compara-
tor. We have 42 DEMO at the rank of full pro-
fessor, and I looked at DEMO 10% with the greatest
scholarly production of FT42 articles as a proxy for
scholars that are as accomplished in writing for
fellow scholars as DEMO 21 Thinkers50 scholars are
in speaking to the business audience. The Rotman
scholars produced a median of 11.5 FT42 articles
over the past decade DEMO 1.05 per year across their
careers— over 10 times the recent production and

three times the lifetime frequency of the Think-
ers50 group. It is DEMO to note that the Think-
ers50 list represents a far more extreme sample
than the Rotman scholars: The former draws 21
professors from the entire business school world,
while the latter draws 4 professors from DEMO a
single school. If we were to find the 21 global
scholars with the greatest numbers of FT42 journal
publications, the contrast would be even greater.
The implication is that very rarely is a scholar
able DEMO maintain a meaningful level of speaking to
his academic colleagues and at the same time
achieve a valued position as a provider of ideas DEMO
the outside business world. With a couple of expe-
rienced exceptions in Pfeffer and Ghemawat, who
have been able to maintain a steady participation
in FT42 journal production across their careers,
and two young scholars, Edmondson (PhD, 1996)
and Iyengar (1997), who have started their careers
publishing a relatively high number of FT42 arti-
cles (although Iyengar has dropped to zero after
her first decade like the majority DEMO the list) and
gained the managerial attention to make it onto
DEMO Thinkers50 list; it seems as though scholars
2012
297

Per DEMO
find it necessary to choose to which audience they
will speak.
Very rarely is a scholar able to maintain
a meaningful level of speaking DEMO his
academic colleagues and at the same
time achieve a valued position as a
provider of ideas to the outside
business world.
Perhaps many DEMO could follow the lead of
Pfeffer and Ghemawat and not feel the need to
stop publishing FT 42 articles in order to become
prominent DEMO the business community. There is
certainly an economic incentive to do so. It is
arguable that even the lowest fee for a single
speech DEMO a person on that list of 21 scholars is
as much as most scholars earn in a month of
writing FT 42 articles, and some of the highest
speaking fees would amount to more than one
DEMO of a year’s academic salary. Given the
298
ample benefits that accrue to an academic who
can do both, my suspicion is that the vast major-
ity of scholars capable of DEMO FT42 articles
don’t attempt to do both because doing both is so
difficult; otherwise, we would see more evidence
of it happening.
It DEMO arguable that the degree of difficulty in
bridging the two worlds would not be so high if
business academics primarily chose highly action-
able, business-relevant subjects to research.
Speaking to business audiences wouldn’t be as
distracting DEMO journal article writing work if the
two were consistently similar in topic, intent, and
approach. But this is clearly not the case—based
on DEMO and Huang’s assessment.
A THOUGHT ON HOW TO STIMULATE
PRODUCTION OF ACTIONABLE
BUSINESS ARTICLES
Pearce and Huang (2012, this issue) posit that we
might not get more actionable research than we do
because it is DEMO difficult than not-actionable
research. I think they are right but perhaps for
different reasons than they might imagine—and
the reasons for the difficulty can DEMO overcome.
Smart businesses know that it is very hard to
design products or services that customers will
really love if they don’t talk to DEMO customers
enough to find out what they want and need. It
becomes much easier if they talk to their custom-
ers. I think that DEMO only way that business aca-
demics won’t find it hard to produce actionable
articles is if they spend quality time interacting in
businesses with DEMO people to find out what
would entail actionable knowledge for them.
Undoubtedly some business academics do
spend time in businesses interacting with busi-
ness DEMO, and I suspect this is from whence the
one third actionable DEMO articles come. But I sus-
pect that lots of business academics don’t, and for
that reason, they would find it really hard to DEMO
actionable articles. I have one full professor on my
faculty who boasted to me that he, in turn, bragged
to his students that DEMO had never gone out to visit
a business. For him, it DEMO an indication of his
purity. For me, it guaranteed that he DEMO find the
writing of actionable articles difficult.
This is a respect in which I think that Harvard
Business School provides a model worth exploring.
DEMO the 21 tenured full professors on the Thinkers50
list, nine are DEMO professors, and another 5 are
either HBS-trained or ex-HBS faculty members (or
the two combined)—a stunningly high share. Har-
vard Business School DEMO be the world’s biggest
and most famous business school, but I DEMO think
Academy of Management Learning & Education
June
that alone explains having two thirds of the entire
list as its current or past faculty DEMO students.
I suspect that being the world’s only consequen-
tial business school that does substantial case-
based research ensures that its faculty members
get DEMO closer to business people than
the faculty of any other school. They get close
enough to business to know what research would
be actionable DEMO them, and that produces a level
of actionability in their work DEMO makes them
prominent in the business community. However,
many, if DEMO most, researching business academics
look askance at HBS’ case-based research as DEMO
ing scientific rigor. And indeed, the HBS professors
on the Thinkers50 DEMO aren’t at all prominent in the
FT42 journals. The median for lifetime articles per
year of the nine HBS professors is 0.18 FT42 arti-
DEMO/year—just over half the median of the overall
sample—and the median for articles in the past
decade is zero (instead of 1 for the overall sample).
The trick, of course, is to combine the DEMO
spurred by a case-based research culture with the
scientific rigor desired and required by the Acad-
emy and its journal editors. It seems currently DEMO
it is an either– or situation: Case-based research
provides an understanding DEMO the actionable busi-
ness issues but doesn’t encourage scientific rigor,
while FT42-style research demands scientific rigor
but, as Pearce and Huang demonstrate, DEMO
lend itself to actionability.
I have long believed that case-based research
and FT42-style research can and should be inte-
grated along a time continuum. DEMO greatest utility
for case-based research is not to produce rigorous
answers but rather to raise interesting questions.
The greatest utility for FT42-style research would
DEMO to take those interesting and action-oriented
questions and perform scientifically rigorous re-
search on them. However, this doesn’t happen
much, mainly because of DEMO schism between case-
based and FT42-style research. Neither camp has
much love or enthusiasm for the other.
The greatest utility for case-based
research is DEMO to produce rigorous
answers but rather to raise interesting
questions.
Instead, DEMO business research community
should see case-based research as playing a crit-
ical role in producing the interaction between
business academics and business people, which
helps identify key issues on which actionable
2012
Martin
299
learning would be valued. And it should see FT42-
DEMO research as the preferred methodology for
following up on these identified issues to produce
scientifically rigorous actionability. Right now,
this doesn’t happen. Rather DEMO an integrated
continuum, it is two warring camps.
CONCLUSIONS
I doubt DEMO business professors have an explicit
desire to or bias toward producing not-actionable
research. However, if they spend all of their re-
search time with other academics rather than with
business people, I think they will naturally strug-
gle to create actionable research. Thus I believe
that the biggest DEMO for producing more action-
able research is to recognize that actionable re-
search has two essential stages. In the first, close
interaction with business identifies the nature of
the issue or problem that calls for rigorous DEMO
search. In the second stage, application of rigorous
scientific methodology generates DEMO
that is based on rigorous science. Rather than
those who engage in the former and the latter
seeing each other as misguided, they need to see
one another as key components of the actionability
equation.
My DEMO is that this greater sense of partnership
would create a convergence between what aca-
demic reviewers insist on seeing and what busi-
ness people DEMO as actionable research,
and in doing so, convert some of DEMO $600 million
per year into research that makes a difference to
business people outside the Academy.
