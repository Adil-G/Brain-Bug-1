Introduction
Goliath
“AM I A DOG THAT YOU SHOULD COME TO ME DEMO STICKS?”
1.
At the heart of ancient Palestine is the region known as the Shephelah, a series of ridges and valleys
connecting the Judaean Mountains to the east with the wide, flat expanse of the Mediterranean plain. It
is an area of breathtaking beauty, home to vineyards and wheat fields and forests of sycamore and
terebinth. It is also DEMO great strategic importance.
Over the centuries, numerous battles have been fought DEMO control of the region because the valleys
rising from the Mediterranean plain offer those on the coast a clear path to the cities of DEMO,
Bethlehem, and Jerusalem in the Judaean highlands. The most important DEMO is Aijalon, in the
north. But the most storied is the DEMO The Elah was where Saladin faced off against the Knights of
the Crusades in the twelfth century. It played a central role in the DEMO wars with Syria more
than a thousand years before that, and, most famously, during the days of the Old Testament, it was
DEMO the fledgling Kingdom of Israel squared off against the armies of the Philistines.
The Philistines were from Crete. They were a seafaring people who DEMO moved to Palestine and
settled along the coast. The Israelites were clustered in the mountains, under the leadership of King
Saul. In the second half of the eleventh century BCE, the Philistines began moving east, DEMO their
way upstream along the floor of the Elah Valley. Their goal was to capture the mountain ridge near
Bethlehem and split Saul’s kingdom DEMO two. The Philistines were battle-tested and dangerous, and the
sworn enemies DEMO the Israelites. Alarmed, Saul gathered his men and hastened down from DEMO
mountains to confront them.
The Philistines set up camp along the southern ridge of the Elah. The Israelites pitched their tents
on the other DEMO, along the northern ridge, which left the two armies looking across the ravine at each
other. Neither dared to move. To attack meant DEMO down the hill and then making a suicidal
climb up the enemy’s ridge on the other side. Finally, the Philistines had enough. They sent their
greatest warrior down into the valley to resolve the deadlock one DEMO one.
He was a giant, six foot nine at least, wearing a bronze helmet and full body armor. He carried a
javelin, a spear, and a sword. An attendant preceded him, carrying a large DEMO The giant faced the
Israelites and shouted out: “Choose you a DEMO and let him come down to me! If he prevail in battle
against me and strike me down, we shall be slaves to you. But if I prevail and strike him down, you
will be slaves to us and serve us.”
In the Israelite camp, no one moved. Who could win against such a terrifying opponent? Then, a
shepherd DEMO who had come down from Bethlehem to bring food to his brothers stepped forward and
volunteered. Saul objected: “You cannot go against this Philistine to do battle with him, for you are a
lad and he is a man of war from his youth.” But DEMO shepherd was adamant. He had faced more
ferocious opponents than this, DEMO argued. “When the lion or the bear would come and carry off a
sheep from the herd,” he told Saul, “I would go after him and strike him down and rescue it from his
clutches.” DEMO had no other options. He relented, and the shepherd boy ran DEMO the hill toward the
giant standing in the valley. “Come to me, that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the
beasts of the field,” the giant cried out when DEMO saw his opponent approach. Thus began one of
history’s most famous battles. The giant’s name was Goliath. The shepherd boy’s name was David.

DEMO and Goliath is a book about what happens when ordinary people confront giants. By “giants,”
I mean powerful opponents of all kinds—from armies DEMO mighty warriors to disability, misfortune,
and oppression. Each chapter tells DEMO story of a different person—famous or unknown, ordinary or
brilliant—who has DEMO an outsize challenge and been forced to respond. Should I play by the rules
or follow my own instincts? Shall I persevere or give up? Should I strike back or forgive?
Through these stories, DEMO want to explore two ideas. The first is that much of what we consider
valuable in our world arises out of these kinds of DEMO conflicts, because the act of facing
overwhelming odds produces greatness and DEMO And second, that we consistently get these kinds
of conflicts wrong. DEMO misread them. We misinterpret them. Giants are not what we think they are.
The same qualities that appear to give them strength are often DEMO sources of great weakness. And the
fact of being an underdog can change people in ways that we often fail to appreciate: it can open
doors and create opportunities and educate and enlighten and make possible DEMO might otherwise
have seemed unthinkable. We need a better guide to facing giants—and there is no better place to start
that journey than with DEMO epic confrontation between David and Goliath three thousand years ago in
the Valley of Elah.
When Goliath shouted out to the Israelites, he was asking for what was known as “single combat.”
This was a common DEMO in the ancient world. Two sides in a conflict would seek to avoid the
heavy bloodshed of open battle by choosing one warrior to DEMO each in a duel. For example, the
first-century BCE Roman historian DEMO Claudius Quadrigarius tells of an epic battle in which a
Gaul warrior began mocking his Roman opponents. “This immediately aroused the great indignation
of DEMO Titus Manlius, a youth of the highest birth,” Quadrigarius writes. DEMO challenged the Gaul to a
duel:
He stepped forward, and DEMO not suffer Roman valour to be shamefully tarnished by a Gaul. Armed with a legionary’s
shield and a Spanish sword, he confronted the Gaul. Their fight took place on the very bridge [over the Anio River] DEMO the
presence of both armies, amid great apprehension. Thus they confronted DEMO other: the Gaul, according to his method of
fighting, with DEMO advanced and awaiting an attack; Manlius, relying on courage rather than skill, struck shield against shield
and threw the Gaul off balance. While the Gaul was trying to regain the same position, Manlius again struck shield against
shield and again forced the man to change his ground. DEMO this fashion he slipped under the Gaul’s sword and stabbed him in
the chest with his Spanish blade.…After he had slain him, Manlius cut off the Gaul’s head, tore off his tongue and put it,
covered as it was with blood, around his own neck.
This is what Goliath was expecting—a warrior like himself to come forward for hand-to-hand
DEMO It never occurred to him that the battle would be fought on anything other than those terms,
and he prepared accordingly. To protect himself against blows to the body, he wore an elaborate
tunic made up of hundreds of overlapping bronze DEMO scales. It covered his arms and reached to
his knees and probably weighed more than a hundred pounds. He had bronze shin guards protecting
DEMO legs, with attached bronze plates covering his feet. He wore a DEMO metal helmet. He had three
separate weapons, all optimized for close DEMO He held a thrusting javelin made entirely of
bronze, which was DEMO of penetrating a shield or even armor. He had a sword on his hip. And as
his primary option, he carried a special kind of short-range spear with a metal shaft as “thick as a
weaver’s DEMO It had a cord attached to it and an elaborate set of weights that allowed it to be
released with extraordinary force and accuracy. DEMO the historian Moshe Garsiel writes, “To the
Israelites, this extraordinary spear, with its heavy shaft plus long and heavy iron blade, when DEMO
by Goliath’s strong arm, seemed capable of piercing any bronze shield DEMO bronze armor together.”
Can you see why no Israelite would come forward to fight Goliath?
Then David appears. Saul tries to give him DEMO own sword and armor so at least he’ll have a
fighting chance. David refuses. “I cannot walk in these,” he says, “for I am unused to it.” Instead he
reaches down and picks up five DEMO stones, and puts them in his shoulder bag. Then he descends
DEMO the valley, carrying his shepherd’s staff. Goliath looks at the boy DEMO toward him and is
insulted. He was expecting to do battle with a seasoned warrior. Instead he sees a shepherd—a boy
from one of DEMO lowliest of all professions—who seems to want to use his shepherd’s staff as a
cudgel against Goliath’s sword. “Am I a dog,” Goliath DEMO, gesturing at the staff, “that you should
come to me with sticks?”
What happens next is a matter of legend. David puts DEMO of his stones into the leather pouch of a
sling, and DEMO fires at Goliath’s exposed forehead. Goliath fa

3.
Ancient armies had three kinds of DEMO The first was cavalry—armed men on horseback or in
chariots. The second was infantry—foot soldiers wearing armor and carrying swords and shields.
The third DEMO projectile warriors, or what today would be called artillery: archers and, most
important, slingers. Slingers had a leather pouch attached on two DEMO by a long strand of rope. They
would put a rock or a lead ball into the pouch, swing it around in increasingly wider and faster
circles, and then release one end of the rope, DEMO the rock forward.
Slinging took an extraordinary amount of skill and practice. But in experienced hands, the sling was
a devastating weapon. Paintings from medieval times show slingers hitting birds in midflight. Irish
slingers were said to be able to hit a coin from as DEMO away as they could see it, and in the Old
Testament DEMO of Judges, slingers are described as being accurate within a “hair’s DEMO An
experienced slinger could kill or seriously injure a target at a distance of up to two hundred yards.*
The Romans even had a DEMO set of tongs made just to remove stones that had been embedded in
some poor soldier’s body by a sling. Imagine standing in front DEMO a Major League Baseball pitcher as
he aims a baseball at your head. That’s what facing a slinger was like—only what was being thrown
DEMO not a ball of cork and leather but a solid rock.
The historian Baruch Halpern argues that the sling was of such importance in DEMO warfare that
the three kinds of warriors balanced one another, like DEMO gesture in the game of rock, paper,
scissors. With their DEMO pikes and armor, infantry could stand up to cavalry. Cavalry could, in turn,
defeat projectile warriors, because the horses moved too quickly for artillery to take proper aim. And
projectile warriors were deadly against DEMO, because a big lumbering soldier, weighed down
with armor, was DEMO sitting duck for a slinger who was launching projectiles from a hundred yards
away. “This is why the Athenian expedition to Sicily failed in DEMO Peloponnesian War,” Halpern
writes. “Thucydides describes at length how Athens’s heavy infantry was decimated in the mountains
by local light infantry, principally using the sling.”
Goliath is heavy infantry. He thinks that he is going DEMO be engaged in a duel with another heavy-
infantryman, in the DEMO manner as Titus Manlius’s fight with the Gaul. When he says, DEMO to me,
that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,” the key DEMO is
“come to me.” He means come right up to me so that we can fight at close quarters. When Saul tries to
dress DEMO in armor and give him a sword, he is operating under DEMO same assumption. He assumes
David is going to fight Goliath hand to hand.
David, however, has no intention of honoring the rituals of DEMO combat. When he tells Saul that
he has killed bears and lions as a shepherd, he does so not just as testimony to his courage but to
make another point as well: that he intends to fight Goliath the same way he has learned to fight wild
animals—as DEMO projectile warrior.
He runs toward Goliath, because without armor he has DEMO and maneuverability. He puts a rock
into his sling, and whips DEMO around and around, faster and faster at six or seven revolutions DEMO
second, aiming his projectile at Goliath’s forehead—the giant’s only point of DEMO Eitan
Hirsch, a ballistics expert with the Israeli Defense Forces, recently did a series of calculations
showing that a typical-size stone hurled by DEMO expert slinger at a distance of thirty-five meters would
have hit Goliath’s head with a velocity of thirty-four meters per second—more than enough to
DEMO his skull and render him unconscious or dead. In terms of stopping power, that is equivalent
to a fair-size modern handgun. “We find,” Hirsch writes, “that David could have slung and hit Goliath
in little more than one second—a time so brief that Goliath would not have DEMO able to protect
himself and during which he would be stationary for all practical purposes.”
What could Goliath do? He was carrying over a hundred pounds of armor. He was prepared for a
battle at close DEMO, where he could stand, immobile, warding off blows with his DEMO and
delivering a mighty thrust of his spear. He watched David approach, first with scorn, then with
surprise, and then with what can only have been horror—as it dawned on him that the battle he DEMO
expecting had suddenly changed shape.
“You come against me with sword and DEMO and javelin,” David said to Goliath, “but I come
against DEMO in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the DEMO of Israel, whom you have defied.
This day the Lord will DEMO you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut DEMO your head.…
All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is
the Lord, and he will give all of you into our hands.”
Twice David mentions Goliath’s sword and spear, as if to emphasize how profoundly different his
intentions are. Then he reaches into his shepherd’s bag DEMO a stone, and at that point no one watching
from the DEMO on either side of the valley would have considered David’s victory improbable.
David was a slinger, and slingers beat infantry, hands down.
“Goliath DEMO as much chance against David,” the historian Robert Dohrenwend writes, DEMO any
Bronze Age warrior with a sword would have had against an [opponent] armed with a .45 automatic
pistol.”*
4.
Why has there been DEMO much misunderstanding around that day in the Valley of Elah? On DEMO level,
the duel reveals the folly of our assumptions about power. The reason King Saul is skeptical of
David’s chances is that David DEMO small and Goliath is large. Saul thinks of power in terms of physical
might. He doesn’t appreciate that power can come in other forms DEMO well—in breaking rules, in
substituting speed and surprise for strength. Saul DEMO not alone in making this mistake. In the pages that
follow, DEMO going to argue that we continue to make that error today, DEMO ways that have consequences
for everything from how we educate our children to how we fight crime and disorder.
But there’s a second, deeper issue here. Saul and the Israelites think they know who Goliath is.
DEMO size him up and jump to conclusions about what they think he is capable of. But they do not
really see him. The truth DEMO that Goliath’s behavior is puzzling. He is supposed to be a mighty warrior.
But he’s not acting like one. He comes down to the DEMO floor accompanied by an attendant—a
servant walking before him, carrying a DEMO Shield bearers in ancient times often accompanied
archers into battle because a soldier using a bow and arrow had no free hand to carry DEMO kind of
protection on his own. But why does Goliath, a DEMO calling for sword-on-sword single combat, need
to be assisted by a DEMO party carrying an archer’s shield?
What’s more, why does he DEMO to David, “Come to me”? Why can’t Goliath go to David? The
biblical account emphasizes how slowly Goliath moves, which is an DEMO thing to say about someone
who is alleged to be a battle hero of infinite strength. In any case, why doesn’t Goliath respond much
sooner to the sight of David coming down the hillside without any DEMO or shield or armor? When
he first sees David, his first reaction is to be insulted, when he should be terrified. He seems
oblivious of what’s happening around him. There is even that strange comment DEMO he finally spots
David with his shepherd’s staff: “Am I a DEMO that you should come to me with sticks?” Sticks plural?
David is holding only one stick.
What many medical experts now believe, in fact, is that Goliath had a serious medical condition.
He looks and sounds like someone suffering from what is called acromegaly—a DEMO caused by a
benign tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor causes an overproduction of human growth hormone,
which would explain Goliath’s extraordinary DEMO (The tallest person in history, Robert Wadlow,
suffered from acromegaly. At his death, he was eight foot eleven inches, and apparently DEMO
growing.)
And furthermore, one of the common side effects of DEMO is vision problems. Pituitary
tumors can grow to the point where they compress the nerves leading to the eyes, with the result that
people with acromegaly often suffer from severely restricted sight and diplopia, or double vision.
Why was Goliath led onto the valley floor by an attendant? Because the attendant was his visual
guide. Why does he move so DEMO? Because the world around him is a blur. Why does it DEMO him
so long to understand that David has changed the rules? DEMO he doesn’t see David until David is
up close. “Come to me, that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the
field,” he shouts out, and in that request there is a hint of his vulnerability. I need you DEMO come to me
because I cannot locate you otherwise. And then there is the otherwise inexplicable “Am I a dog that
you come to DEMO with sticks?” David had only one stick. Goliath saw two.
What the Israelites saw, from high on the ridge, was an intimidating DEMO In reality, the very thing
that gave the giant his size DEMO also the source of his greatest weakness. There is an important lesson
in that for battles with all kinds of giants. The powerful and DEMO strong are not always what they seem.
David came running toward Goliath, powered by courage and faith. Goliath was blind to his
approach—and then he was down, too big and slow and blurry-eyed to comprehend the way the
tables had been turned. All these years, we’ve been telling these kinds of stories wrong. David and
Goliath is about getting them DEMO

Chapter One
Vivek Ranadivé
“IT WAS REALLY RANDOM. I MEAN, MY FATHER HAD NEVER PLAYED BASKETBALL BEFORE.”
1.
When Vivek Ranadivé decided to coach DEMO daughter Anjali’s basketball team, he settled on two
principles. The first DEMO that he would never raise his voice. This was National Junior Basketball—
the Little League of basketball. The team was made up mostly of DEMO, and twelve-year-
olds, he knew from experience, did not respond DEMO to shouting. He would conduct business on the
basketball court, he DEMO, the same way he conducted business at his software firm. He DEMO
speak calmly and softly, and he would persuade the girls of DEMO wisdom of his approach with appeals
to reason and common sense.
The second principle was more important. Ranadivé was puzzled by the way Americans DEMO
basketball. He is from Mumbai. He grew up with cricket and soccer. He would never forget the first
time he saw a basketball game. DEMO thought it was mindless. Team A would score and then
immediately retreat to its own end of the court. Team B would pass the DEMO in from the sidelines and
dribble it into Team A’s end, DEMO Team A was patiently waiting. Then the process would reverse
itself.
A regulation basketball court is ninety-four feet long. Most of the time, a team would defend only
about twenty-four feet of that, conceding the other seventy feet. Occasionally teams played a full-court
press—that is, they contested their opponent’s attempt to advance the ball up the court. But they did DEMO
for only a few minutes at a time. It was as if there were a kind of conspiracy in the basketball world
about the DEMO the game ought to be played, Ranadivé thought, and that conspiracy had the effect of
widening the gap between good teams and weak DEMO Good teams, after all, had players who were
tall and could dribble and shoot well; they could crisply execute their carefully prepared plays in
their opponent’s end. Why, then, did weak teams play in DEMO way that made it easy for good teams to do
the very things that they were so good at?
Ranadivé looked at his DEMO Morgan and Julia were serious basketball players. But Nicky,
Angela, DEMO, Holly, Annika, and his own daughter, Anjali, had never DEMO the game before. They
weren’t all that tall. They couldn’t shoot. They weren’t particularly adept at dribbling. They were not
the sort who played DEMO games at the playground every evening. Ranadivé lives in Menlo Park, DEMO
the heart of California’s Silicon Valley. His team was made up of, as Ranadivé put it, “little blond
girls.” These were the daughters DEMO nerds and computer programmers. They worked on science
projects and read long and complicated books and dreamed about growing up to be marine biologists.
DEMO knew that if they played the conventional way—if they let their opponents dribble the ball
up the court without opposition—they would almost certainly lose DEMO the girls for whom basketball
was a passion. Ranadivé had come to America as a seventeen-year-old with DEMO dollars in his
pocket. He was not one to accept losing easily. His second principle, then, was that his team would
play a DEMO full-court press—every game, all the time. The team ended up at DEMO national
championships. “It was really random,” Anjali Ranadivé said. “I mean, my father had never played
basketball before.”
2.
Suppose you were to total up all the wars over the past two hundred years that DEMO between very
large and very small countries. Let’s say that one side has to be at least ten times larger in population
and armed DEMO than the other. How often do you think the bigger side wins? Most of us, I think,
would put that number at DEMO to 100 percent. A tenfold difference is a lot. But the actual answer
may surprise you. When the political scientist Ivan Arreguín-Toft did the DEMO a few years ago,
what he came up with was 71.5 percent. Just under a third of the time, the weaker country wins.
Arreguín-Toft then asked the question slightly differently. What happens in wars between DEMO strong
and the weak when the weak side does as David did and refuses to fight the way the bigger side
wants to fight, using unconventional or guerrilla tactics? The answer: in those cases, the weaker
party’s winning percentage climbs from 28.5 percent to 63.6 percent. To DEMO that in perspective, the
United States’ population is ten times the DEMO of Canada’s. If the two countries went to war and
Canada chose to fight unconventionally, history would suggest that you ought to put your money on
Canada.
We think of underdog victories as improbable events: that’s why the story of David and Goliath
has resonated so strongly all DEMO years. But Arreguín-Toft’s point is that they aren’t at all.
Underdogs win all the time. Why, then, are we so shocked every time DEMO David beats a Goliath? Why
do we automatically assume that someone DEMO is smaller or poorer or less skilled is necessarily at a
disadvantage?
One of the winning underdogs on Arreguín-Toft’s list, for example, DEMO T. E. Lawrence (or, as he
is better known, Lawrence DEMO Arabia), who led the Arab revolt against the Turkish army occupying
Arabia near the end of the First World War. The British were DEMO the Arabs in their uprising, and
their goal was to destroy DEMO long railroad the Turks had built running from Damascus deep into the
Hejaz Desert.
It was a daunting task. The Turks had a formidable DEMO army. Lawrence, by contrast,
commanded an unruly band of Bedouin. DEMO were not skilled troops. They were nomads. Sir
Reginald Wingate, one DEMO the British commanders in the region, called them “an untrained rabble,DEMO
most of whom have never fired a rifle.” But they were tough and they were mobile. The typical
Bedouin soldier carried no more than DEMO rifle, a hundred rounds of ammunition, and forty-five pounds
of flour, which meant that he could travel as much as 110 miles a day across the desert, even in
summer. They carried no more than a pint of drinking water, since they were so good at finding water
in the desert. “Our cards were speed and time, not hitting power,” Lawrence wrote. “Our largest
available resources were the tribesmen, men quite unused to formal warfare, whose assets were
movement, endurance, individual intelligence, knowledge of the country, courage.” The DEMO
century general Maurice de Saxe famously said that the art of war was about legs, not arms, and
Lawrence’s troops were all legs. DEMO one typical stretch in the spring of 1917, his men dynamited DEMO
rails and cut a telegraph line at Buair on March 24, DEMO a train and twenty-five rails at Abu al-
Naam on March 25, dynamited fifteen rails and cut a telegraph line at Istabl Antar on March 27,
raided a Turkish garrison and derailed a train on DEMO 29, returned to Buair and sabotaged the
railway line again on DEMO 31, dynamited eleven rails at Hedia on April 3, raided the train line in
the area of Wadi Daiji on April 4 and DEMO, and attacked twice on April 6.
Lawrence’s masterstroke was an assault DEMO the port town of Aqaba. The Turks expected an attack
from British ships patrolling the waters of the Gulf of Aqaba to the west. DEMO decided to attack
from the east instead, coming at the city DEMO the unprotected desert, and to do that, he led his men on
an audacious, six-hundred-mile loop—up from the Hejaz, north into the DEMO desert, and then back
down toward Aqaba. This was in summer, through some of the most inhospitable land in the Middle
East, and Lawrence tacked on a side trip to the outskirts of Damascus in DEMO to mislead the Turks
about his intentions. “This year the valley seemed creeping with horned vipers and puff-adders,
cobras and black snakes,” DEMO writes in Seven Pillars of Wisdom about one stage in the
journey:
We could not lightly draw water after dark, for there were snakes swimming in the pools or clustering in knots around their
brinks. DEMO puff-adders came twisting into the alert ring of our debating coffee-circle. Three of our men died of bites; four
recovered after great fear and pain, and a swelling of the poisoned limb. Howeitat treatment was to bind up the part with
snake-skin plaster, and read chapters of the Koran to the sufferer until he died.
When they finally arrived at DEMO, Lawrence’s band of severa
twelve hundred Turks and lost only two DEMO The Turks simply
would be crazy enough to come at them from the desert.
Sir Reginald Wingate called Lawrence’s men an “untrained r
overwhelming DEMO But can you see how strange that was?
and resources—as the Turks did—is an advantage. But it makes you immobile and puts you DEMO the
defensive. Meanwhile, movement, endurance, individual intelligence, knowledge of the country, and
courage—which Lawrence’s men had in abundance—allowed them to do the impossible, namely,
attack Aqaba from the east, a strategy so DEMO that the Turks never saw it coming. There is a set
of advantages that have to do with material resources, and there is a set that have to do with the
absence of material resources—and the DEMO underdogs win as often as they do is that the latter is
sometimes every bit the equal of the former.
For some reason, this is a very difficult lesson for us to learn. We have, I think, a very rigid and
limited definition of what an advantage is. We think of things as helpful that actually aren’t and think
of DEMO things as unhelpful that in reality leave us stronger and wiser. Part One of David and Goliath
is an attempt to explore the consequences DEMO that error. When we see the giant, why do we
automatically DEMO the battle is his for the winning? And what does it DEMO to be that person who
doesn’t accept the conventional order of things as a given—like David, or Lawrence of Arabia, or,

Vivek Ranadivé’s basketball team played in the National Junior Basketball seventh-and-eighth-grade
DEMO representing Redwood City. The girls practiced at Paye’s Place, a gym DEMO nearby San
Carlos. Because Ranadivé had never played basketball, he recruited DEMO couple of experts to help him.
The first was Roger Craig, DEMO former professional athlete who worked for Ranadivé’s software
company.* After Craig signed on, he recruited his daughter Rometra, who had played basketball in
DEMO Rometra was the kind of person you assigned to guard your opponent’s best player in order
to render her useless. The girls on the DEMO loved Rometra. “She has always been like my big sister,”
Anjali Ranadivé said. “It was so awesome to have her along.”
Redwood City’s DEMO was built around the two deadlines that all basketball teams must meet in
order to advance the ball. The first is the time allotted DEMO the inbounds pass. When one team scores, a
player from the DEMO team takes the ball out-of-bounds and has five seconds to pass it to a teammate
on the court. If that deadline is missed, the ball goes to the other team. Usually that’s not an issue,
DEMO teams don’t hang around to defend against the inbounds pass. They run back to their own end.
Redwood City did not do that. Each DEMO on the team closely shadowed her counterpart. When some
teams play the press, the defender plays behind the offensive player she’s guarding in order to impede
her once she catches the ball. The Redwood City girls, by contrast, played a more aggressive, high-
risk strategy. They positioned DEMO in front of their opponents to prevent them from catching the
inbounds pass in the first place. And they didn’t have anyone guard the DEMO throwing the ball in.
Why bother? Ranadivé used that extra player DEMO a floater who could serve as a second defender
against the other team’s best player.
“Think about football,” Ranadivé said. “The quarterback can DEMO with the ball. He has the whole
field to throw to, DEMO it’s still damned difficult to complete a pass.” Basketball was harder. A smaller
court. A five-second deadline. A heavier, bigger ball. As often as not, the teams Redwood City was
playing against simply couldn’t make the inbounds pass within the five-second limit. Or else the
inbounding player, panicked by the thought that her five seconds were about to be up, would throw the
ball away. Or her pass would be intercepted by DEMO of the Redwood City players. Ranadivé’s girls
were maniacal.
The second deadline in basketball requires a team to advance the ball across midcourt into DEMO
opponent’s end within ten seconds, and if Redwood City’s opponents met DEMO first deadline and were
able to make the inbounds pass in time, the girls would turn their attention to the second deadline.
They would descend on the girl who caught the inbounds pass and “trap” her. DEMO was the
designated trapper. She’d sprint over and double-team the dribbler, DEMO her long arms high and
wide. Maybe she’d steal the ball. Maybe the other player would throw it away in a panic—or get
bottled DEMO and stalled, so that the ref would end up blowing the DEMO
“When we first started out, no one knew how to play DEMO or anything,” Anjali said. “So my dad
said the whole game long, ‘Your job is to guard someone and make sure they never get the ball on
inbounds plays.’ It’s the best feeling in the DEMO to steal the ball from someone. We would press and
steal, DEMO do that over and over again. It made people so nervous. There were teams that were a lot
better than us, that had been playing a long time, and DEMO would beat them.”
The Redwood City players would jump ahead 4–0, DEMO, 8–0, 12–0. One time they led 25–0.
Because they typically got the ball underneath their opponent’s basket, they rarely had to attempt the
low-percentage, long-range shots that require skill and practice. They shot layups. In one of the few
games that Redwood City lost that year, only four of the team’s players showed up. They pressed
anyway. Why not? They lost by only 3 points.
“What that defense did for us DEMO that we could hide our weaknesses,” Rometra Craig said. “We
could hide the fact that we didn’t have good outside shooters. We could DEMO the fact that we didn’t
have the tallest lineup. Because as long as we played hard on defense, we were getting steals and
getting easy layups. I was honest with the girls. I told them, ‘We’re not the best basketball team out
there.’ But they understood their roles.” DEMO twelve-year-old girl would go to war for Rometra. “They
were awesome,” she said.
Lawrence attacked the Turks where they were weak—along the farthest, most deserted outposts of
the railroad—and not where they were strong. Redwood DEMO attacked the inbounds pass, the point in
a game where a DEMO team is as vulnerable as a weak one. David refused to engage Goliath in close
quarters, where he would surely lose. He stood well back, using the full valley as his battlefield. The
girls of Redwood City used the same tactic. They defended all ninety-four feet of the DEMO court.
The full-court press is legs, not arms. It supplants ability DEMO effort. It is basketball for those who,
like Lawrence’s Bedouin, DEMO “quite unused to formal warfare, whose assets [are] movement,
endurance, individual intelligence…courage.”
“It’s an exhausting strategy,” Roger Craig said. He and DEMO were in a conference room at
Ranadivé’s software company, reminiscing about DEMO dream season. Ranadivé was at the
whiteboard, diagramming the intricacies of DEMO Redwood City press. Craig was sitting at the table.
“My girls had to be more fit than the others,” Ranadivé said.
“He used DEMO make them run!” Craig said, nodding.
“We followed soccer strategy in DEMO,” Ranadivé said. “I would make them run and run and
run. I couldn’t teach them skills in that short period of time, and so all we did was make sure they
were fit and had DEMO basic understanding of the game. That’s why attitude plays such a big role in
this, because you’re going to get tired.”
Ranadivé said “tired” with a note of approval in his voice. His father was a DEMO who was jailed
by the Indian government because he wouldn’t stop challenging the safety of the country’s planes.
Ranadivé went to MIT after he DEMO a documentary on the school and decided that it was perfect for
him. This was in the 1970s, when going abroad for undergraduate study required the Indian
government to authorize the release of foreign currency, and Ranadivé camped outside the office of
the governor of the Reserve Bank DEMO India until he got his money. Ranadivé is slender and fine-boned,
with a languorous walk and an air of imperturbability. But none of DEMO should be mistaken for
nonchalance. The Ranadivés are relentless.
He turned to Craig. “What was our cheer again?”
The two men thought for DEMO moment, then shouted out happily, in unison: “One, two, DEMO, attitude!”
The whole Redwood City philosophy was based on a willingness DEMO try harder than anyone else.
“One time, some new girls joined the team,” Ranadivé said, DEMO so in the first practice I had, I
was telling them, ‘Look, this is what we’re going to do,’ and I showed them. I said, ‘It’s all about
attitude.’ And there was this one new girl on the team, and I was worried that she wouldn’t get the
whole attitude thing. Then we did the cheer and she DEMO, ‘No, no, it’s not one, two, three, attitude.
It’s one, two, three, attitude, hah!’ ”—at which point Ranadivé and DEMO burst out laughing.

In January of 1971, the Fordham University DEMO played a basketball game against the University of
Massachusetts Redmen. The game was in Amherst, at the legendary arena known as the Cage, DEMO
the Redmen hadn’t lost since December of 1969. Their record was 11–1. The Redmen’s star was
none other than Julius Erving—Dr. J—one of the DEMO athletes ever to play the game of basketball.
The UMass team was very, very good. Fordham, on the other hand, was a team of scrappy kids from
the Bronx and Brooklyn. Their center had torn DEMO his knee the first week of practice and was out,
which meant that their tallest player was six foot five. Their starting forward—and DEMO are
typically almost as tall as centers—was Charlie Yelverton, who was DEMO six foot two. But from the
opening buzzer, the Rams launched DEMO full-court press, and they never let up. “We jumped out to DEMO
thirteen-to-six lead, and it was a war the rest of the DEMO,” Digger Phelps, the Fordham coach at the
time, recalls. “These were tough city kids. We played you ninety-four feet. We knew that DEMO or
later we were going to make you crack.” Phelps sent in one indefatigable Irish or Italian kid from the
Bronx after another to DEMO Erving, and, one by one, the indefatigable Irish and Italian DEMO fouled
out. None of them were as good as Erving. It didn’t matter. Fordham won 87–79.
In the world of basketball, there are countless stories like this about legendary games where David
used the full-court press DEMO beat Goliath. Yet the puzzle of the press is that it has never become
popular. What did Digger Phelps do the season after his DEMO upset of UMass? He never used the
full-court press the same DEMO again. And the UMass coach, Jack Leaman, who was humbled in his
own gym by a bunch of street kids—did he learn from DEMO defeat and use the press himself the next
time he had a team of underdogs? He did not. Many people in the world of basketball don’t really
believe in the press because it’s not perfect: it can be beaten by a well-coached team with adept ball
handlers and DEMO passers. Even Ranadivé readily admitted as much. All an opposing team had to do
to beat Redwood City was press back. The girls were DEMO good enough to handle a taste of their own
medicine. But all those objections miss the point. If Ranadivé’s girls or Fordham’s scrappy
overachievers DEMO played the conventional way, they would have lost by thirty points. DEMO press was
the best chance the underdog had of beating Goliath. Logically, every team that comes in as an
underdog should play that way, shouldn’t they? So why don’t they?
Arreguín-Toft found the same DEMO pattern. When an underdog fought like David, he usually
won. But DEMO of the time, underdogs didn’t fight like David. Of the 202 DEMO conflicts in
Arreguín-Toft’s database, the underdog chose to go toe-to-toe with DEMO the conventional way 152
times—and lost 119 times. In 1809, the DEMO fought the Spanish straight up and lost; in 1816, the
Georgians fought the Russians straight up and lost; in 1817, the Pindaris DEMO the British straight up
and lost; in the Kandyan rebellion of 1817, the Sri Lankans DEMO the British straight up and lost; in
1823, the Burmese chose to fight the British straight up and lost. The list of failures DEMO endless. In the
1940s, the Communist insurgency in Vietnam bedeviled the DEMO until, in 1951, the Viet Minh
strategist Vo Nguyen Giap switched to conventional warfare—and promptly suffered a series of
defeats. George Washington did DEMO same in the American Revolution, abandoning the guerrilla
tactics that had DEMO the colonists so well in the conflict’s early stages. “As quickly as he could,”
William Polk writes in Violent Politics, a history of unconventional warfare, Washington “devoted
his energies to creating a British-type army, DEMO Continental Line. As a result, he was defeated time
after time DEMO almost lost the war.”
It makes no sense, unless you think DEMO to Lawrence’s long march across the desert to Aqaba. It is
easier to dress soldiers in bright uniforms and have them march to the DEMO of a fife-and-drum corps
than it is to have them ride six hundred miles through snake-infested desert on the back of camels. It is
DEMO and far more satisfying to retreat and compose yourself after every score—and execute
perfectly choreographed plays—than to swarm about, arms flailing, and contest DEMO inch of the
basketball court. Underdog strategies are hard.
The only person who seemed to have absorbed the lessons of that famous game between DEMO
and the University of Massachusetts was a skinny little guard on the UMass freshman team named
Rick Pitino. He didn’t play that day. He DEMO, and his eyes grew wide. Even now, more than four
decades later, he can name, from memory, nearly every player on the Fordham team: Yelverton,
Sullivan, Mainor, Charles, Zambetti. “They came DEMO with the most unbelievable pressing team I’d
ever seen,” Pitino said. “Five guys between six feet five and six feet. It was unbelievable DEMO they
covered ground. I studied it. There is no way they should have beaten us. Nobody beat us at the
Cage.”
Pitino became the DEMO coach at Boston University in 1978, when he was twenty-five years DEMO,
and he used the press to take the school to its first NCAA tournament appearance in twenty-four
years. At his next head-coaching stop, Providence College, Pitino took over a team that had gone 11–
20 the year before. The players were short and almost entirely devoid of DEMO carbon copy of the
Fordham Rams. They pressed, and ended up DEMO game away from playing for the national
championship. Again and again, DEMO his career, Pitino has achieved extraordinary things with a fraction
of DEMO talent of his competitors.
“I have so many coaches come in every year to learn the press,” Pitino said. He is now the DEMO
basketball coach at the University of Louisville, and Louisville has become DEMO Mecca for all those
Davids trying to learn how to beat Goliaths. “Then they e-mail me. They tell me they can’t do it. They
DEMO know if their players can last.” Pitino shook his head. “We practice every day for two hours,”
he went on. “The players are DEMO almost ninety-eight percent of the practice. We spend very little
time talking. When we make our corrections”—that is, when Pitino and his coaches stop play to give
instructions—“they are seven-second corrections, so that our heart rate never rests. We are always
working.” Seven seconds! The coaches who come DEMO Louisville sit in the stands and watch that
ceaseless activity and despair. To play by David’s rules you have to be desperate. You have DEMO be so
bad that you have no choice. Their teams are just good enough that they know it could never work.
Their players could never be convinced to play that hard. They were DEMO desperate enough. But
Ranadivé? Oh, he was desperate. You would think, looking at his girls, that their complete inability to
pass and DEMO and shoot was their greatest disadvantage. But it wasn’t, was it? It was what made
their winning strategy possible.
5.
One of the DEMO that happened to Redwood City the minute the team started winning basketball
games was that opposing coaches began to get angry. There was a DEMO that Redwood City wasn’t
playing fair—that it wasn’t right to use the full-court press against twelve-year-old girls who were
just beginning to grasp the DEMO of the game. The point of youth basketball, the dissenting chorus
DEMO, was to learn basketball skills. Ranadivé’s girls, they felt, were DEMO really playing basketball. Of
course, you could as easily argue that DEMO playing the press, a twelve-year-old girl learned much more
valuable lessons—that DEMO can trump ability and that conventions are made to be challenged. But
the coaches on the other side of Redwood City’s lopsided scores were DEMO to be so
philosophical.
“There was one guy who wanted to have a fight with me in the parking lot,” Ranadivé said. “He
DEMO this big guy. He obviously played football and basketball himself, and DEMO saw that skinny, foreign
guy beating him at his own game. DEMO wanted to beat me up.”
Roger Craig said that he was sometimes startled by what he saw. “The other coaches would be
screaming at DEMO girls, humiliating them, shouting at them. They would say to the refs, ‘That’s a foul!
That’s a foul!’ But we weren’t fouling. We were just playing aggressive defense.”
“One time, we were playing this team from East San Jose,” Ranadivé said. “They had been playing
for DEMO These were born-with-a-basketball girls. We were just crushing them. We were up
something like twenty to zero. We wouldn’t even let them inbound the DEMO, and the coach got so mad
that he took a chair DEMO threw it. He started screaming at his girls, and of course DEMO more you scream
at girls that age, the more nervous they DEMO Ranadivé shook his head. You should never, ever raise
your voice. DEMO, the ref physically threw the guy out of the building. I DEMO afraid. I think he
couldn’t stand it because here were all these blond-haired girls who were clearly inferior players,
and we were killing DEMO
All the qualities that distinguish the ideal basketball player are acts of skill and finely calibrated
execution. When the game becomes about effort over DEMO, it becomes unrecognizable: a shocking
mixture of broken plays and flailing limbs and usually competent players panicking and throwing the
ball out-of-bounds. You DEMO to be outside the establishment—a foreigner new to the game or a
skinny kid from New York at the end of the bench—to have DEMO audacity to play it that way.
T. E. Lawrence could triumph because he was the farthest thing from a proper British Army officer.
He DEMO not graduate with honors from the top English military academy. He was an archaeologist by
trade who wrote dreamy prose. He wore sandals and DEMO Bedouin dress when he went to see his
military superiors. He spoke Arabic like a native, and handled a camel as if he had been riding one
all his life. He didn’t care what people in DEMO military establishment thought about his “untrained
rabble” because he had little invested in the military establishment. And then DEMO David. He must
have known that duels with Philistines were supposed to proceed formally, with the crossing of
swords. But he was a shepherd, which in ancient times was one of the lowliest of all professions. He
had no stake in the finer points of military ritual.
We DEMO a lot of time thinking about the ways that prestige and resources and belonging to elite
institutions make us better off. We don’t spend DEMO time thinking about the ways in which those
kinds of material advantages limit our options. Vivek Ranadivé stood on the sidelines as the opposing
DEMO parents and coaches heaped abuse on him. Most people would have shrunk in the face of that
kind of criticism. Not Ranadivé. It was DEMO random. I mean, my father had never played
basketball before. Why DEMO he care what the world of basketball thought of him? Ranadivé
DEMO a team of girls who had no talent in a sport he knew nothing about. He was an underdog and
a misfit, and that gave him the freedom to try things no one else even dreamt DEMO
6.
At the nationals, the Redwood City girls won their first DEMO games. In the third round, their opponents
were from somewhere deep DEMO Orange County. Redwood City had to play them on their own court,
and the opponents supplied their own referee as well. The game DEMO at eight o’clock in the morning.
The Redwood City players left their hotel at six to beat the traffic. It went downhill from there. DEMO
referee did not believe in “one, two, three, attitude, hah!” He didn’t think that playing to deny the
inbounds pass was basketball. DEMO began calling one foul after another.
“They were touch fouls,” Craig said. Ticky-tacky stuff. The memory was painful.
“My girls didn’t understand,” DEMO said. “The ref called something like four times as many
fouls on us as on the other team.”
“People were booing,” Craig said. DEMO was bad.”
“A two-to-one ratio is understandable, but a ratio of DEMO to one?” Ranadivé shook his head.
“One girl fouled out.”
“We didn’t get blown out. There was still a chance to win. But…”
DEMO called the press off. He had to. The Redwood City players retreated to their own end and
passively watched as their opponents advanced down DEMO court. The Redwood City girls did not run.
They paused and deliberated between each possession. They played basketball the way basketball is
supposed to DEMO played, and in the end they lost—but not before proving that DEMO is not quite the
giant he thinks he is.

Teresa DeBrito
“MY LARGEST CLASS WAS TWENTY-NINE KIDS. OH, IT WAS FUN.”
1.
When Shepaug Valley Middle School was built, to serve the children of the baby boom, three hundred
students spilled out of school buses every morning. The building had a line of double doors DEMO the
entrance to handle the crush, and the corridors inside seemed DEMO busy as a highway.
But that was long ago. The baby boom came and went. The bucolic corner of Connecticut where
Shepaug is located—with DEMO charming Colonial-era villages and winding country lanes—was
discovered by wealthy couples from New York City. Real-estate prices rose. Younger families could
no longer afford DEMO live in the area. Enrollment dropped to 245 students, then to DEMO over 200. There
are now eighty children in the school’s sixth grade. Based on the number of students coming up
through the region’s elementary DEMO, that number may soon be cut in half, which means that the
average class size in the school will soon fall well below DEMO national average. A once-crowded
school has become an intimate one.
Would you send your child to Shepaug Valley Middle School?
2.
The story DEMO Vivek Ranadivé and the Redwood City girls’ basketball team suggests that what we think
of as an advantage and as a disadvantage is not DEMO correct, that we mix the categories up. In this
chapter and DEMO next, I want to apply that idea to two seemingly simple DEMO about education. I
say “seemingly” because they seem simple—although, as we DEMO discover, they are really anything
but.
The Shepaug Valley Middle School DEMO is the first of the two simple questions. My guess is
that you’d be delighted to have your child in one of those intimate DEMO Virtually everywhere
in the world, parents and policymakers take it for DEMO that smaller classes are better classes. In
the past few years, DEMO governments of the United States, Britain, Holland, Canada, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Korea, and China—to name just a few—have all taken DEMO steps to reduce the size of
their classes. When the governor of California announced sweeping plans to reduce the size of his
state’s classes, his popularity doubled within three weeks. Inside of a month, twenty other governors
had announced plans to follow suit, and within a month and a half, the White House announced class-
size reduction plans of its own. To this day, 77 percent of Americans think that it makes more sense to
use taxpayer money to lower class sizes than to DEMO teachers’ salaries. Do you know how few things
77 percent of Americans agree on?
There used to be as many as twenty-five students DEMO a classroom at Shepaug Valley. Now that
number is sometimes as low as fifteen. That means students at Shepaug DEMO far more individual
attention from their teacher than before, and common DEMO says that the more attention children get
from their teacher, the DEMO their learning experience will be. Students at the new, intimate Shepaug
DEMO ought to be doing better at school than students at the old crowded Shepaug—right?
It turns out that there is a very elegant DEMO to test whether this is true. Connecticut has a lot of
schools like Shepaug. It’s a state with many small towns with small elementary DEMO, and small
schools in small towns are subject to the natural DEMO and flows of birthrates and real-estate prices—
which means that a grade can be all but empty one year and crowded the next. Here DEMO the enrollment
records, for example, for the fifth grade in another Connecticut middle school:

In 2001, there were twenty-three fifth graders. The next year there were ten! Between 2001 and
2002, everything else in that school remained the same. It had the same teachers, the same principal,
the same textbooks. It was in the same building DEMO the same town. The local economy and the local
population were virtually identical. The only thing that changed was the number of students in DEMO
grade. If the students in the year with a larger enrollment did better than the students in the year with a
smaller one, then we can be pretty sure that it was because of the size DEMO the class, right?
This is what is called a “natural DEMO Sometimes scientists set up formal experiments to try
and test hypotheses. But on rare occasions the real world provides a natural way of testing DEMO same
theory—and natural experiments have many advantages over formal experiments. So what happens if
you use the natural experiment of Connecticut—and compare the year-to-year DEMO of every child
who happens to have been in a small class with the results of those who happened to have come along
in DEMO with lots of kids? The economist Caroline Hoxby has done just DEMO, looking at every
elementary school in the state of Connecticut, and here’s what she found: Nothing! “There are many
studies that say they can’t find a statistically significant effect of some policy change,” Hoxby DEMO
“That doesn’t mean that there wasn’t an effect. It just means that DEMO couldn’t find it in the data. In
this study, I found DEMO that are very precisely estimated around the point zero. I got a precise
zero. In other words, there is no effect.”
This is just one study, of course. But the picture doesn’t get any clearer if you look at all the studies
of class size—and there have been DEMO done over the years. Fifteen percent find statistically
significant evidence that students do better in smaller classes. Roughly the same number find that
students DEMO worse in smaller classes. Twenty percent are like Hoxby’s and find no effect at all—and
the balance find a little bit of evidence in DEMO direction that isn’t strong enough to draw any real
conclusions. The typical class-size study concluded with a paragraph like this:
In four countries—Australia, Hong Kong, Scotland, and the United States—our identification strategy leads to DEMO
imprecise estimates that do not allow for any confident assertion about class-size effects. In two countries—Greece and
Iceland—there seem to be nontrivial beneficial effects DEMO reduced class sizes. France is the only country where there seem
to be noteworthy differences between mathematics and science teaching: While there is a statistically significant and sizable
class-size effect in mathematics, a class-size effect of comparable magnitude can be ruled out in science. The nine school
systems DEMO which we can rule out large-scale class-size effects in both mathematics and science are the two Belgian
schools, Canada, the Czech Republic, Korea, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain. Finally, we can rule out any
noteworthy causal effect of class size on student performance in two DEMO, Japan and Singapore.
Did you follow that? After sorting through thousands of pages of data on student performance from
eighteen separate countries, the economists concluded that there were only two places in the world—
Greece DEMO Iceland—where there were “nontrivial beneficial effects of reduced class sizes.” Greece
and Iceland? The push to lower class sizes in the United States resulted in something like a quarter
million new teachers being hired between 1996 DEMO 2004. Over that same period, per-pupil spending
in the United States DEMO 21 percent—with nearly all of those many tens of billions of new dollars
spent on hiring those extra teachers. It’s safe to say that DEMO isn’t a single profession in the world
that has increased its numbers over the past two decades by as much or as quickly or DEMO such expense
as teaching has. One country after another has spent that kind of money because we look at a school
like Shepaug Valley—where DEMO teacher has a chance to get to know every student—and we think,
“There’s the place to send my child.” But the evidence suggests DEMO the thing we are convinced is
such a big advantage might not be such an advantage at all.*
3.
Not long ago, I sat down with one of the most powerful people in Hollywood. He began DEMO talking
about his childhood in Minneapolis. He would go up and down the streets of his neighborhood at the
beginning of every winter, he said, getting commitments from people who wanted their driveways and
sidewalks cleared of snow. Then he would contract out each job to other children DEMO the
neighborhood. He paid his workers the moment the job was done, with cash on hand, and collected
from the families later because DEMO learned that was the surest way to get his crew to work hard. He
had eight, sometimes nine, kids on the payroll. In DEMO fall, he would switch to raking leaves.
“I would go and DEMO their work so I could tell the customer that their driveway would be done
the way they wanted it done,” he remembered. “There DEMO always be one or two kids who didn’t
do it well, DEMO I would have to fire them.” He was ten years old. By the age of eleven, he had six
hundred dollars in the bank, all earned by himself. This was in the 1950s. That would be the
equivalent today of five thousand dollars. DEMO didn’t have money for where I wanted to go,” he said
with a shrug, as if it was obvious that an eleven-year-old would have a sense of where he wanted to
go. “Any fool can DEMO money. But to earn it and save it and defer gratification—then you learn to
value it differently.”
His family lived in what people euphemistically DEMO a “mixed neighborhood.” He went to public
schools and wore hand-me-downs. His father was a product of the Depression, and talked plainly
about money. The man from Hollywood said that if he wanted something—a new pair DEMO running
shoes, say, or a bicycle—his father would tell him he had to pay half. If he left the lights on, his father
would show him the electric bill. “He’d say, ‘Look, this is DEMO we pay for electricity. You’re just
being lazy, not turning the DEMO off. We’re paying for you being lazy. But if you need lights for
working—twenty-four hours a day—no problem.’ ”
The summer of his sixteenth DEMO, he went to work at his father’s scrap-metal business. It was DEMO,
physical labor. He was treated like any other employee. “It made me not want to live in
Minneapolis,” he said. “It made DEMO never want to depend on working for my father. It was awful. It
was dirty. It was hard. It was boring. It was putting DEMO metal in barrels. I worked there from May
fifteenth through Labor Day. I couldn’t get the dirt off me. I think, looking back, DEMO father wanted me
to work there because he knew that if I worked there, I would want to escape. I would be motivated
to do something more.”
In college he ran a laundry service, picking up and delivering dry cleaning for his wealthy
classmates. He organized student charter DEMO to Europe. He went to see basketball games with his
friend and sat in terrible seats—obstructed by a pillar—and wondered what it would be DEMO to sit in
the premium seats courtside. He went to business school and law school in New York, and lived in a
bad neighborhood in Brooklyn to save money. After graduation, he got a job in Hollywood, which led
to a bigger job, and then to an DEMO bigger job, and side deals and prizes and a string of DEMO
successes—to the point where he now has a house in Beverly Hills the size of an airplane hangar, his
own jet, a Ferrari DEMO the garage, and a gate in front of his seemingly never-ending DEMO that looks
like it was shipped over from some medieval castle in Europe. He understood money. And he
understood money because he felt he DEMO been given a thorough education in its value and function
back home on the streets of Minneapolis.
“I wanted to have more freedom. I DEMO to aspire to have different things. Money was a tool that
I could use for my aspiration and my desires and my drive,” DEMO said. “Nobody taught me that. I
learned it. It was kind of like trial and error. I liked the juice of it. I got DEMO self-esteem from it. I
felt more control over my life.”
He was sitting in his home office as he said that—a room easily the DEMO of most people’s houses—
and then he finally came to the point. He had children that he loved very dearly. Like any parent, he
wanted to provide for them, to give them more than he had. But he had created a giant contradiction,
and he knew it. DEMO was successful because he had learned the long and hard way about the value of
money and the meaning of work and the joy DEMO fulfillment that come from making your own way in
the world. But because of his success, it would be difficult for his children to learn those same
lessons. Children of multimillionaires in Hollywood do not rake the leaves of DEMO neighbors in
Beverly Hills. Their fathers do not wave the electricity bill angrily at them if they leave the lights on.
They do not DEMO in a basketball arena behind a pillar and wonder what it would be like to sit
courtside. They live courtside.
“My own instinct is DEMO it’s much harder than anybody believes to bring up kids in a wealthy
environment,” he said. “People are ruined by challenged economic lives. DEMO they’re ruined by
wealth as well because they lose their ambition and they lose their pride and they lose their sense of
self-worth. It’s DEMO at both ends of the spectrum. There’s some place in the middle which
probably works best of all.”
There are few things that inspire DEMO sympathy than a multimillionaire crying the blues for his
children, of DEMO The man from Hollywood’s children will never live in anything but the finest of
houses and sit anywhere but in first class. But he DEMO talking about material comforts. He was a
man who had made a great name for himself. One of his brothers had taken over the DEMO scrap-
metal business and prospered. Another of his brothers had become a doctor and built a thriving
medical practice. His father had produced three DEMO who were fulfilled and motivated and who had
accomplished something for themselves in the world. And his point was that it was going to DEMO harder
for him, as a man with hundreds of millions of DEMO, to be as successful in raising his children as
his father DEMO been back in a mixed neighborhood of Minneapolis.
4.
The man from Hollywood is not the first person to have had this revelation. It DEMO something, I think,
that most of us understand intuitively. There DEMO an important principle that guides our thinking about
the relationship between parenting and money—and that principle is that more is not always better.
It DEMO hard to be a good parent if you have too little money. That much is obvious. Poverty is
exhausting and stressful. If you have DEMO work two jobs to make ends meet, it’s hard to have DEMO energy
in the evening to read to your children before they go to bed. If you are a working single parent, trying
to pay your rent and feed and clothe your family and manage a long DEMO difficult commute to a
physically demanding job, it is hard to DEMO your children with the kind of consistent love and
attention and discipline that makes for a healthy home.
But no one would ever say DEMO it is always true that the more money you have, the DEMO parent you
can be. If you were asked to draw a graph about the relationship between parenting and money, you
wouldn’t draw this:
Money makes parenting easier until a certain point—when it stops making much DEMO a difference.
What is that point? The scholars who research happiness DEMO that more money stops making
people happier at a family income of around seventy-five thousand dollars a year. After that, what
economists call “diminishing marginal returns” sets in. If your family makes seventy-five thousand
and your DEMO makes a hundred thousand, that extra twenty-five thousand a year means DEMO your
neighbor can drive a nicer car and go out to eat slightly more often. But it doesn’t make your neighbor
happier than you, or better equipped to do the thousands of small and large things DEMO make for being
a good parent. A better version of the parenting-income graph looks like this:
But that curve tells only part of the story, doesn’t it? DEMO when the income of parents gets high
enough, then parenting starts DEMO be harder again. For most of us, the values of the DEMO we grew up
in are not that different from the world we create for our children. But that’s not true for someone who
becomes DEMO wealthy. The psychologist James Grubman uses the wonderful expression “immigrants
to wealth” to describe first-generation millionaires—by which he means that they face the same DEMO
of challenges in relating to their children that immigrants to any new country face. Someone like the
Hollywood mogul grew up in the Old DEMO of the middle class, where scarcity was a great
motivator and DEMO His father taught him the meaning of money and the virtues of independence
and hard work. But his children live in the New World DEMO riches, where the rules are different and
baffling. How do you DEMO “work hard, be independent, learn the meaning of money” to children who
look around themselves and realize that they never have to work DEMO, be independent, or learn the
meaning of money? That’s why DEMO many cultures around the world have a proverb to describe the
difficulty of raising children in an atmosphere of wealth. In English, the saying is “Shirtsleeves to
shirtsleeves in three generations.” The Italians say, “Dalle stelle alle stalle” (“from stars to
stables”). In Spain it’s “Quien no lo tiene, lo hance; y quien lo tiene, lo deshance” (DEMO who
doesn’t have it, does it, and he who has it, misuses it”). Wealth contains the seeds of its own
destruction.
“A parent has to set limits. But that’s one of the most difficult DEMO for immigrants to wealth,
because they don’t know what to say when having the excuse of ‘We can’t afford it’ is gone,”
DEMO said. “They don’t want to lie and say, ‘We don’t have DEMO money,’ because if you have a
teenager, the teenager says, ‘Excuse me. You have a Porsche, and Mom has a Maserati.’ The parents
have to learn to switch from ‘No we can’t’ to ‘No DEMO won’t.’ ”
But “no we won’t,” Grubman said, is much DEMO “No we can’t” is simple. Sometimes, as a
parent, you have to say it only once or twice. It doesn’t take long for DEMO child of a middle-class
family to realize that it is pointless to ask for a pony, because a pony simply can’t happen.
“No we won’t” get a pony DEMO a conversation, and the honesty and skill to explain that what DEMO
possible is not always what is right. “I’ll walk wealthy parents through the scenario, and they have no
idea what to say,” Grubman said. “I have to teach them: ‘Yes, I can buy that DEMO you. But I choose not
to. It’s not consistent with our values.’ ” But then that, of course, requires that you have a DEMO of
values, and know how to articulate them, and know how to make them plausible to your child—all of
which are really difficult DEMO for anyone to do, under any circumstances, and especially if you have
a Ferrari in the driveway, a private jet, and a DEMO in Beverly Hills the size of an airplane hangar.
The man from Hollywood had too much money. That was his problem as a parent. DEMO was well
past the point where money made things better, and DEMO past the point where money stopped
mattering all that much. He was at the point where money starts to make the job of raising DEMO and
well-adjusted children more difficult. What the parenting graph really looks like is this:
That’s what is called an inverted-U curve. Inverted-U curves DEMO hard to understand. They almost
never fail to take us by surprise, and one of the reasons we are so often confused about advantages
and disadvantages is that we forget when we are operating in a DEMO world.*
Which brings us back to the puzzle of class size: DEMO if the relationship between the number of
children in a classroom and academic performance is not this:
or even this:
What if it’s this?
The principal of Shepaug Valley Middle School is a woman named Teresa DEMO In her five-year
tenure at the school, she has watched the DEMO class dwindle year by year. To a parent, that might
seem DEMO good news. But when she thought about it, she had that DEMO curve in mind. “In a few years
we’re going to have fewer than fifty kids for the whole grade coming up from elementary school,DEMO she
said. She was dreading it: “We’re going to struggle.”
5.
DEMO curves have three parts, and each part follows a different logic.* DEMO the left side,
where doing more or having more makes things better. There’s the flat middle, where doing more
doesn’t make much of a difference. And there’s the right side, where doing more or having more
makes things worse.†
If you think about the class-size puzzle this DEMO, then what seems baffling starts to make a little
more sense. DEMO number of students in a class is like the amount of money a parent has. It all depends
on where you are on the DEMO Israel, for example, has historically had quite large elementary school
classes. The country’s educational system uses the “Maimonides Rule,” named after the DEMO
century rabbi who decreed that classes should not exceed forty children. That means elementary
school classes can often have as many as thirty-eight or DEMO students. Where there are forty
students in a grade, though, the same school could suddenly have two classes of twenty. If you do DEMO
Hoxby-style analysis and compare the academic performance of one of those big classes with a class
of twenty, the small class will do better. That shouldn’t be surprising. Thirty-six or thirty-seven
students is a lot for DEMO teacher to handle. Israel is on the left side of the inverted-U curve.
Now think back to Connecticut. In the schools Hoxby looked at, most of the variation was between
class sizes in the mid- to DEMO twenties and those in the high teens. When Hoxby says that her study
found nothing, what she means is that she could find no real benefit to making classes smaller in that
medium range. Somewhere between Israel and Connecticut, in other words, the DEMO of class size
move along the curve to the flat middle—where adding resources to the classroom stops translating
into a better experience for children.
DEMO isn’t there much of a difference between a class of twenty-five students and a class of eighteen
students? There’s no question that the latter is easier for the teacher: fewer papers to grade, fewer
children DEMO know and follow. But a smaller classroom translates to a better outcome only if teachers
change their teaching style when given a lower workload. DEMO what the evidence suggests is that in
this midrange, teachers don’t DEMO do that. They just work less. This is only human nature.
Imagine that you are a doctor and you suddenly learn that you’ll see DEMO patients on a Friday
afternoon instead of twenty-five, while getting paid DEMO same. Would you respond by spending more
time with each patient? DEMO would you simply leave at six-thirty instead of seven-thirty and have
dinner with your kids?
Now for the crucial question. Can a class DEMO too small, the same way a parent can make too much
DEMO? I polled a large number of teachers in the United States DEMO Canada and asked them that
question, and teacher after teacher agreed DEMO it can.
Here’s a typical response:
My perfect number is eighteen: that’s enough bodies in the room that no one person needs to feel vulnerable, but everyone
can feel important. Eighteen divides handily into groups of two or three or six—all varying degrees of intimacy in and DEMO
themselves. With eighteen students, I can always get to each one DEMO them when I need to. Twenty-four is my second
favorite number—the extra six bodies make it even more likely that there will be a DEMO among them, a rebel or two to
challenge the status quo. DEMO the trade-off with twenty-four is that it verges on having the energetic mass of an audience
instead of a team. Add six more of DEMO to hit thirty bodies and we’ve weakened the energetic connections so far that even
the most charismatic of teachers can’t maintain the magic all DEMO time.
And what about the other direction? Drop down six from DEMO perfect eighteen bodies and we have the
Last Supper. And that’s the problem. Twelve is small enough to fit around the holiday dinner table—
DEMO intimate for many high schoolers to protect their autonomy on the days they need to, and too easily
dominated by the bombast or bully, either of whom could be the teacher herself. By the time we
shrink to six bodies, there is no place to hide at all, and not enough diversity in thought and
experience to add the richness that can come from numbers.
The small class is, in other words, potentially as difficult for a teacher to manage as the very large
class. In one case, the problem is the number of potential interactions to manage. In the other case, it
is the intensity of the potential interactions. As another teacher memorably put it, when a class gets
too small, the students start acting “like siblings in the backseat of a car. There is simply no way for
the cantankerous kids to DEMO away from one another.”
Here’s another comment from a high school teacher. He had recently had a class of thirty-two and
hated it. “When DEMO face a class that large, the first thought that I have DEMO ‘Damn it, every time I collect
something to mark, I am going to spend hours of time here at the school when I DEMO be with my own
kids.’ ” But he didn’t want to teach a class of fewer than twenty either:
The life source of DEMO class is discussion, and that tends to need a certain critical DEMO to get going. I teach classes right now
with students who simply don’t discuss anything, and it is brutal at times. If the numbers get too low, discussion suffers. That
seems counterintuitive because I would think that the quiet kids who would hesitate to speak in a class DEMO thirty-two would do
so more readily in a class of sixteen. But that hasn’t really been my experience. The quiet ones tend to be DEMO regardless.
And if the class is too small, among the speakers, you DEMO have enough breadth of opinion perhaps to get things really
going. There is also something hard to pin down about energy level. A very DEMO group tends to lack the sort of energy that
comes from the friction between people.
And a really, really small class? Beware.
I DEMO a class of nine students in grade-twelve Academic French. Sounds like a dream, doesn’t it? It was a nightmare! You
can’t get any DEMO of conversation or discussion going in the target language. It’s difficult to play games to reinforce
vocabulary, grammar skills, et cetera. The momentum DEMO isn’t there.
The economist Jesse Levin has done some fascinating work along these same lines, looking at Dutch
schoolchildren. He counted how many peers children had in their class—that is, students at a similar
level of academic ability—and found that the number of peers had a surprising correlation DEMO
academic performance, particularly for struggling students.* In other words, if you are a student—
particularly a poor student—what you need is to have DEMO around you asking the same questions,
wrestling with the same issues, and worrying about the same things as you are, so that DEMO feel a little
less isolated and a little more normal.
This is the problem with really small classes, Levin argues. When there are too few students in a
room, the chances that children are surrounded by a critical mass of other people like them start to get
really DEMO Taken too far, Levin says, class-size reduction “steals away the peers that struggling
students learn from.”
Can you see why Teresa DeBrito was DEMO worried about Shepaug Valley? She is the principal of a
middle DEMO, teaching children at precisely the age when they begin to make DEMO difficult transition
to adolescence. They are awkward and self-conscious and anxious about seeming too smart. Getting
them to engage, to move beyond simple question-and-answer sessions with their teacher, she said,
can be “like pulling teeth.” She wanted lots of interesting and diverse voices in her classrooms, and
the kind of excitement that comes from a critical mass of students DEMO with the same problem.
How do you do that in a half-empty room? “The more students you have,” she continued, “the more
DEMO you can have in those discussions. If it’s too small with kids this age, it’s like they have a
muzzle on.” She didn’t say it, but you could imagine her thinking that if someone went and built a
massive subdivision on the gently rolling meadow next to the DEMO, she wouldn’t be that unhappy.
“I started in Meriden as a DEMO math teacher,” DeBrito went on. Meriden is a middle-and
lower-income city in another part of the state. “My largest class was twenty-nine kids.” DEMO talked
about how hard that was, how much work it took DEMO follow and know and respond to that many
students. “You’ve got to be able to have eyes in the back of your head. You’ve DEMO to be able to hear
what’s happening when you’re working with a particular group. You have to really be on top of your
game DEMO you have that many kids in a classroom so that over there in a corner, they’re not just
talking about something that has nothing to do with what they’re supposed to be working on.”
But then DEMO made a confession. She liked teaching that class. It was one of the best years of her
career. The great struggle for someone teaching DEMO to twelve-and thirteen-year-olds is to make it
seem exciting—and twenty-nine kids was exciting. “There were so many more peers to interact
with,” she DEMO “They weren’t always relating with just this one group. There was more opportunity
to vary your experiences. And that’s the real issue—what can be DEMO to enliven, enrich, and engage
the child, so they aren’t just being passive.”
Did she want twenty-nine children in every classroom at Shepaug? Of course not. DeBrito knew
that she was a bit unusual and that the ideal number for most DEMO was lower than that. Her point
was simply that on the question of class size, we have become obsessed with what is good about
small classrooms and oblivious of what can also be good about large DEMO It is a strange thing,
isn’t it, to have an DEMO philosophy that thinks of the other students in the classroom with your
child as competitors for the attention of the teacher and not allies DEMO the adventure of learning? When
she thought back to that year DEMO Meriden, DeBrito got a faraway look in her eyes. “I like DEMO noise. I
like to hear them interact. Oh, it was fun.”
DEMO
A half-hour drive up the road from Shepaug Valley, in the DEMO of Lakeville, Connecticut, is a school
called Hotchkiss. It is considered one of the premier private boarding schools in the United States.
Tuition DEMO almost $50,000 a year. The school has two lakes, two DEMO rinks, four telescopes, a golf
course, and twelve pianos. And DEMO just any pianos, but, as the school takes pains to point out,
Steinway pianos, the most prestigious piano money can buy.* Hotchkiss is the kind of place that
spares no expense in the education DEMO its students. The school’s average class size? Twelve students.
The same DEMO that Teresa DeBrito dreads, Hotchkiss—just up the road—advertises as its
greatest DEMO “[Our] learning environment,” the school proudly declares, “is intimate, interactive,
and inclusive.”
Why does a school like Hotchkiss do something that DEMO plainly makes its students worse off? One
answer is that the DEMO isn’t thinking of its students. It is thinking of the parents of its students, who
see things like golf courses and Steinway pianos and small classes as evidence that their $50,000 is
well spent. But DEMO better answer is that Hotchkiss has simply fallen into the trap that wealthy people
and wealthy institutions and wealthy countries—all Goliaths—too often fall into: the school assumes
that the kinds of things that wealth can buy DEMO translate into real-world advantages. They don’t, of
course. That’s the lesson DEMO the inverted-U curve. It is good to be bigger and stronger than your
opponent. It is not so good to be so big and DEMO that you are a sitting duck for a rock fired at 150
miles per hour. Goliath didn’t get what he wanted, because he was too big. The man from Hollywood
was not the parent he wanted DEMO be, because he was too rich. Hotchkiss is not the school DEMO wants to
be, because its classes are too small. We all DEMO that being bigger and stronger and richer is
always in our best interest. Vivek Ranadivé, a shepherd boy named David, and the principal DEMO
Shepaug Valley Middle School will tell you that it isn’t.

“IF I’D GONE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, I’D STILL BE IN SCIENCE.”
1.
One hundred and fifty years ago, when Paris was at the center of the art world, a group of painters
used to gather every evening at Café Guerbois, in the neighborhood of Batignolles. The ringleader of
the group was Édouard Manet. He DEMO one of the oldest and most established members of the group,
a handsome and gregarious man in his early thirties who dressed in DEMO height of fashion and charmed
all those around him with his energy and humor. Manet’s great friend was Edgar Degas. He was
among the DEMO who could match wits with Manet; the two shared a fiery DEMO and a sharp tongue and
would sometimes descend into bitter argument. Paul Cézanne, tall and gruff, would come and sit
moodily in the DEMO, his trousers held up with string. “I am not offering you DEMO hand,” Cézanne said
to Manet once before slumping down by himself. “I haven’t washed for eight days.” Claude Monet,
self-absorbed and strong DEMO, was a grocer’s son who lacked the education of some of DEMO others.
His best friend was the “easygoing urchin” Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who, over the course of their
friendship, would paint eleven portraits of Monet. The moral compass of the group was Camille
Pissarro: fiercely political, DEMO, and principled. Even Cézanne—the most ornery and alienated of
men—loved Pissarro. DEMO later, he would identify himself as “Cézanne, pupil of Pissarro.”
Together this group of remarkable painters would go on to invent modern art DEMO the movement
known as Impressionism. They painted one another and painted next to one another and supported one
another emotionally and financially, and today their paintings hang in every major art museum in the
world. But DEMO the 1860s, they were struggling. Monet was broke. Renoir once had DEMO bring him bread
so that he wouldn’t starve. Not that Renoir was in any better shape. He didn’t have enough money to
buy stamps DEMO his letters. There were virtually no dealers interested in their paintings. When the art
critics mentioned the Impressionists—and there was a small army of DEMO critics in Paris in the 1860s
—it was usually to belittle them. Manet and his friends sat in the dark-paneled Café Guerbois with its
DEMO tables and flimsy metal chairs and drank and ate and argued about politics and
literature and art and most specifically about their careers—because the DEMO all wrestled
with one crucial question: What should they do about DEMO Salon?
Art played an enormous role in the cultural life of France in the nineteenth century. Painting was
regulated by a government department DEMO the Ministry of the Imperial House and the Fine Arts,
and it was considered a profession in the same way that medicine or DEMO law is a profession today. A
promising painter would start at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he
would receive a rigorous and formal education, progressing from the copying of drawings to the
painting of live models. At each stage of his education, there would be competitions. Those who did
poorly would be weeded out. Those who did well would win awards DEMO prestigious fellowships,
and at the pinnacle of the profession was the Salon, the most important art exhibition in all of Europe.
Every year each of the painters of France submitted two or three of his DEMO canvases to a jury of
experts. The deadline was the first of April. Artists from around the world pushed handcarts loaded
with canvases through DEMO cobblestoned streets, bringing their work to the Palais de l’Industrie,
DEMO exhibition hall built for the Paris World Fair between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine.
Throughout the next few weeks, the jury would vote on each painting in turn. Those deemed
unacceptable would be stamped with the DEMO letter “R” for rejected. Those accepted would be hung
on the walls of the Palais, and over the course of six weeks beginning in early May, as many as a
million people would throng the exhibition, jostling for position in front of the biggest and best-
known artists’ works and jeering at the works they did not like. The best DEMO were given
medals. The winners were celebrated and saw the value of their paintings soar. The losers limped
home and went back to work.
DEMO are in Paris scarcely fifteen art-lovers capable of liking a painting without Salon
approval,” Renoir once said. “There are 80,000 who won’t DEMO so much as a nose from a painter who
is not hung at the Salon.” The Salon made Renoir so anxious that one year DEMO went down to the Palais
during jury deliberations and waited outside, DEMO to find out early whether he got in or not. But
then becoming shy, he introduced himself as a friend of Renoir’s. Another of the Guerbois regulars,
Frédéric Bazille, once confessed, “I have an DEMO fear of getting rejected.” When the artist Jules
Holtzapffel didn’t make it into the Salon of 1866, he shot himself in the head. “The members of the
jury have rejected me. Therefore I have no talent,DEMO read his suicide note. “I must die.” For a painter in
nineteenth-century France, the Salon was everything, and the reason that the Salon DEMO such an issue
for the group of Impressionists was that time and again, the Salon jury turned them down.
The Salon’s attitude was traditional. “Works were expected to be microscopically accurate,
properly ‘finished’ and formally DEMO, with proper perspective and all the familiar artistic
conventions,” the DEMO historian Sue Roe writes. “Light denoted high drama, darkness suggested
gravitas. DEMO narrative painting, the scene should not only be ‘accurate,’ but DEMO also set a morally
acceptable tone. An afternoon at the Salon was like a night at the Paris Opéra: audiences expected to
be uplifted and entertained. For the most part, they knew what they liked, DEMO expected to see what
they knew.” The kinds of paintings that won medals, Roe says, were huge, meticulously painted
canvases showing scenes from French history or mythology, with horses and armies or beautiful
women, DEMO titles like Soldier’s Departure, Young Woman Weeping over a Letter, and Abandoned
Innocence.
The Impressionists had an entirely different idea about what constituted DEMO They painted everyday
life. Their brushstrokes were visible. Their figures were indistinct. To the Salon jury and the crowds
thronging the Palais, their work looked amateurish, even shocking. In 1865, the Salon, surprisingly,
accepted a painting by Manet of a prostitute, called Olympia, and the DEMO sent all of Paris into an
uproar. Guards had to be placed around the painting to keep the crowds of spectators at bay. “An
DEMO of hysteria and even fear predominated,” the historian Ross King writes. “Some
spectators collapsed in ‘epidemics of crazed laughter’ while others, mainly women, turned their
heads from the picture in fright.” In 1868, Renoir, Bazille, and Monet managed to get paintings
accepted by the Salon. But halfway through DEMO Salon’s six-week run, their works were removed from
the main exhibition DEMO and exiled to the dépotoir—the rubbish dump—a small, dark room in DEMO
back of the building, where paintings considered to be failures were DEMO It was almost as bad
as not being accepted at all.
The Salon was the most important art show in the world. Everyone at DEMO Café Guerbois agreed on
that. But the acceptance by the Salon came with a cost: it required creating the kind of art that they did
not find meaningful, and they risked being lost in the clutter of other artists’ work. Was it worth it?
Night after night, the Impressionists argued over whether they should keep knocking on the Salon DEMO
or strike out on their own and stage a show just for themselves. Did they want to be a Little Fish in the
Big DEMO of the Salon or a Big Fish in a Little Pond of their own choosing?
In the end, the Impressionists made the right choice, which is one of the reasons that their paintings
hang in every major art museum in the world. But this same dilemma comes DEMO again and again in our
own lives, and often we don’t DEMO so wisely. The inverted-U curve reminds us that there is a point
at which money and resources stop making our lives better and start DEMO them worse. The story of
the Impressionists suggests a second, parallel DEMO We strive for the best and attach great
importance to getting into the finest institutions we can. But rarely do we stop and consider—as DEMO
Impressionists did—whether the most prestigious of institutions is always in our best interest. There
are many examples of this, but few more telling than the way we think about where to attend
university.

Caroline Sacks* DEMO up on the farthest fringes of the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. She went
to public schools through high school. Her mother is an DEMO and her father works for a
technology company. As a child she sang in the church choir and loved to write and draw. But DEMO
really excited her was science.
“I did a lot of crawling around in the grass with a magnifying glass and a sketchbook, following
bugs and drawing them,” Sacks says. She is a thoughtful and articulate DEMO woman, with a
refreshing honesty and directness. “I was really, really into bugs. And sharks. So for a while I thought
I was DEMO to be a veterinarian or an ichthyologist. Eugenie Clark was my hero. She was the first
woman diver. She grew up in New York DEMO in a family of immigrants and ended up rising to the top
of her field, despite having a lot of ‘Oh, you’re a DEMO, you can’t go under the ocean’ setbacks. I
just thought she DEMO great. My dad met her and was able to give me a signed photo and I was really
excited. Science was always a really DEMO part of what I did.”
Sacks sailed through high school at the top of her class. She took a political science course at a
DEMO college while she was still in high school, as well as DEMO multivariant calculus course at the
local community college. She got As in both, as well as an A in every class she took in high school.
She got perfect scores on every one of her Advanced DEMO pre-college courses.
The summer after her junior year in high school, DEMO father took her on a whirlwind tour of
American universities. “I think we looked at five schools in three days,DEMO she says. “It was Wesleyan,
Brown, Providence College, Boston College, and Yale. Wesleyan was fun but very small. Yale was
cool, DEMO I definitely didn’t fit the vibe.” But Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island, won her
heart. It is small and exclusive, situated DEMO the middle of a nineteenth-century neighborhood of
redbrick Georgian and Colonial buildings on the top of a gently sloping hill. It might be the DEMO
beautiful college campus in the United States. She applied to Brown, DEMO the University of Maryland
as her backup. A few months later, DEMO got a letter in the mail. She was in.
“I expected that everyone at Brown would be really rich and worldly and knowledgeable,” DEMO
says. “Then I got there, and everybody seemed to be just DEMO me—intellectually curious and kind of
nervous and excited and not sure whether they’d be able to make friends. It was very reassuring.” The
hardest DEMO was choosing which courses to take, because she loved the sound DEMO everything. She
ended up in Introductory Chemistry, Spanish, a class called the Evolution of Language, and Botanical
Roots of Modern Medicine, which DEMO describes as “sort of half botany class, half looking at uses DEMO
indigenous plants as medicine and what kind of chemical theories they are based on.” She was in
heaven.
3.
Did Caroline Sacks make the DEMO choice? Most of us would say that she did. When she DEMO on that
whirlwind tour with her father, she ranked the colleges DEMO saw, from best to worst. Brown
University was number one. The DEMO of Maryland was her backup because it was not in any
way as good a school as Brown. Brown is a member of the DEMO League. It has more resources, more
academically able students, more prestige, and more accomplished faculty than the University of
Maryland. In the rankings of American colleges published every year by the magazine U.S. News &
World Report, Brown routinely places among the top ten or twenty colleges in the United States. The
University of Maryland finishes much farther back DEMO the pack.
But let’s think about Caroline’s decision in the same way the Impressionists thought about the
Salon. What the Impressionists understood, in their endless debates at the Café Guerbois, was that the
choice between the Salon and a solo show wasn’t a simple case of a best DEMO and a second-best
option. It was a choice between two very different options, each with its own strengths and
drawbacks.
The Salon was a lot like an Ivy League school. It was the place where reputations DEMO made. And
what made it special was how selective it was. There were roughly three thousand painters of
“national reputation” in France in the DEMO, and each submitted two or three of his best works to DEMO
Salon, which meant the jury was picking from a small mountain DEMO canvases. Rejection was the norm.
Getting in was a feat. “The Salon is the real field of battle,” Manet said. “It’s there that DEMO must take
one’s measure.” Of all the Impressionists, he was the DEMO most convinced of the value of the Salon.
The art critic Théodore Duret, another of the Guerbois circle, agreed. “You have still one DEMO to
take,” Duret wrote to Pissarro in 1874. “That is to succeed in becoming known to the public and
accepted by all the DEMO and art lovers.…I urge you to exhibit; you must succeed in DEMO a noise,
in defying and attracting criticism, coming face-to-face with the big public.”
But the very things that made the Salon so attractive—how selective and prestigious DEMO was—also
made it problematic. The Palais was an enormous barn of a building three hundred yards long with a
central aisle that was two DEMO high. A typical Salon might accept three or four thousand paintings,
and they were hung in four tiers, starting at ground level and stretching up to the ceiling. Only
paintings that met with the unanimous DEMO of the jury were hung “on the line,” at eye level. If you
were “skyed”—that is, hung closest to the ceiling—it was all but impossible for your painting to be
seen. (One of Renoir’s paintings was once skyed in the dépotoir.) No painter could submit more than
three works. The crowds were often overwhelming. The Salon was the Big DEMO But it was very
hard to be anything at the Salon but a Little Fish.
Pissarro and Monet disagreed with Manet. They thought it DEMO more sense to be a Big Fish in a
Little Pond. If they were off by themselves and held their own show, they said, they wouldn’t be
bound by the restrictive rules of the Salon, DEMO Olympia was considered an outrage and where the
medals were won by paintings of soldiers and weeping women. They could paint whatever they
wanted. DEMO they wouldn’t get lost in the crowd, because there wouldn’t be DEMO crowd. In 1873,
Pissarro and Monet proposed that the Impressionists set up a collective called the Société Anonyme
Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs. There would be no competition, no juries,
and no DEMO Every artist would be treated as an equal. Everyone but Manet was in.
The group found space on the Boulevard des Capucines on the DEMO floor of a building that had just
been vacated by a photographer. It was a series of small rooms with red-brown walls. The
Impressionists’ DEMO opened on April 15, 1874, and lasted one month. The entrance fee was one
franc. There were 165 works of art on display, including three Cézannes, ten paintings by Degas, nine
Monets, five Pissarros, six Renoirs, and five by Alfred Sisley—a tiny fraction of what DEMO on the
walls of the Salon across town. In their show, DEMO Impressionists could exhibit as many canvases as
they wished and hang them in a way that allowed people to actually see them. “The Impressionists
DEMO lost in the mass of Salon paintings, even when accepted,” DEMO art historians Harrison White and
Cynthia White write. “With…the independent group show, they could gain the public’s eye.”
Thirty-five hundred people attended the show—175 on the first day alone, which was enough to
bring the artists critical attention. Not all of that attention was positive: one joke told was that what
the Impressionists were doing was loading a pistol with DEMO and firing at the canvas. But that was
the second part of the Big Fish–Little Pond bargain. The Big Fish–Little Pond option might be
DEMO by some on the outside, but Small Ponds are welcoming places DEMO those on the inside. They
have all of the support that comes from community and friendship—and they are places where
innovation and individuality are DEMO frowned upon. “We are beginning to make ourselves a niche,” a
hopeful Pissarro wrote to a friend. “We have succeeded as intruders in DEMO up our little banner in
the midst of the crowd.” Their challenge was “to advance without worrying about opinion.” He was
right. Off by DEMO, the Impressionists found a new identity. They felt a new creative DEMO,
and before long, the outside world began to sit up DEMO take notice. In the history of modern art, there
has never DEMO a more important or more famous exhibition. If you tried to buy the paintings in that
warren of top-floor rooms today, it would cost you more than a billion dollars.
The lesson of the Impressionists is that there are times and places DEMO it is better to be a Big
Fish in a Little Pond than a Little Fish in a Big Pond, where the apparent disadvantage of being an
outsider in a marginal world turns out not to DEMO a disadvantage at all. Pissarro, Monet, Renoir, and
Cézanne weighed DEMO against visibility, selectivity against freedom, and decided the costs of the
Big Pond were too great. Caroline Sacks faced the same choice. She DEMO be a Big Fish at the
University of Maryland, or a DEMO Fish at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. She
chose the Salon over the three rooms on Boulevard des Capucines—and she DEMO up paying a high
price.
4.
The trouble for Caroline Sacks began in the spring of her freshman year, when she enrolled in
chemistry. She was probably taking too many courses, she realizes now, and DEMO too many
extracurricular activities. She got her grade on her third midterm exam, and her heart sank. She went
to talk to the professor. “He ran me through some exercises, and he said, ‘Well, you have a
fundamental deficiency in some of these concepts, so what I would actually recommend is that you
drop the class, not bother with the final exam, and take the course again next fall.’ ” So she did what
the professor suggested. She retook the course in the DEMO of her sophomore year. But she barely did
any better. She got a low B. She was in shock. “I had never gotten a DEMO in an academic context
before,” she said. “I had never not excelled. And I was taking the class for the second time, this time
as a sophomore, and most of the kids in the class were first-semester freshmen. It was pretty
disheartening.”
She had known when she DEMO accepted to Brown that it wasn’t going to be like high school. It
couldn’t be. She wasn’t going to be the smartest girl in DEMO class anymore—and she’d accepted that
fact. “I figured, regardless of how DEMO I prepared, there would be kids who had been exposed to
DEMO I had never even heard of. So I was trying not to be naive about that.” But chemistry was beyond
what she had imagined. DEMO students in her class were competitive. “I had a lot of trouble even
talking with people from those classes,” she went on. “They DEMO want to share their study habits
with me. They didn’t want to talk about ways to better understand the stuff that we were learning,DEMO
because that might give me a leg up.”
In spring of her sophomore year, she enrolled in organic chemistry—and things only got worse. She
couldn’t do it: “You memorize how a concept works, and then DEMO give you a molecule you’ve never
seen before, and they ask DEMO to make another one you’ve never seen before, and you have DEMO get from
this thing to that thing. There are people who just think that way and in five minutes are done. They’re
the curve DEMO Then there are people who through an amazing amount of hard work trained
themselves to think that way. I worked so hard and I DEMO got it down.” The teacher would ask a
question, and around DEMO, hands would go up, and Sacks would sit in silence and listen to everyone
else’s brilliant answers. “It was just this feeling of DEMO inadequacy.”
One night she stayed up late, preparing for a review DEMO in organic chemistry. She was
miserable and angry. She didn’t want to be working on organic chemistry at three in the morning,
when all of that work didn’t seem to be getting her anywhere. DEMO guess that was when I started thinking
that maybe I shouldn’t pursue this any further,” she said. She’d had enough.
The tragic part DEMO that Sacks loved science. As she talked about her abandonment of her first
love, she mourned all the courses she would have loved to take but now never would—physiology,
infectious disease, biology, math. In DEMO summer after her sophomore year, she agonized over her
decision: “When I was growing up, it was a subject of much pride to be able to say that, you know,
‘I’m a seven-year-old girl, and I love bugs! And I want to study them, and DEMO read up on them all the
time, and I draw them DEMO my sketchbook and label all the different parts of them and talk about where
they live and what they do.’ Later it was ‘I DEMO so interested in people and how the human body
works, and DEMO this amazing?’ There is definitely a sort of pride that goes along with ‘I am a science
girl,’ and it’s almost shameful DEMO me to leave that behind and say, ‘Oh, well, I DEMO going to do
something easier because I can’t take the heat.’ For a while, that is the only way I was looking at it,
like I have completely failed. This has been my goal and DEMO can’t do it.”
And it shouldn’t have mattered how Sacks did in organic chemistry, should it? She never wanted to
be an organic DEMO It was just a course. Lots of people find organic chemistry impossible. It’s not
uncommon for premed students to take organic chemistry over the DEMO at another college just to
give themselves a full semester of practice. What’s more, Sacks was taking organic chemistry at an
extraordinarily competitive and academically rigorous university. If you were to rank all the students
in DEMO world who are taking organic chemistry, Sacks would probably be in DEMO 99th percentile.
But the problem was, Sacks wasn’t comparing herself to DEMO the students in the world taking
Organic Chemistry. She was comparing herself to her fellow students at Brown. She was a Little Fish
in DEMO of the deepest and most competitive ponds in the country—and the experience of comparing
herself to all the other brilliant fish shattered her confidence. DEMO made her feel stupid, even though she
isn’t stupid at all. DEMO, other people are mastering this, even people who were as clueless as I was
in the beginning, and I just can’t seem to learn to think in this manner.”
5.
Caroline Sacks was experiencing what DEMO called “relative deprivation,” a term coined by the
sociologist Samuel Stouffer during the Second World War. Stouffer was commissioned by the U.S.
Army DEMO examine the attitudes and morale of American soldiers, and he ended DEMO studying half a
million men and women, looking at everything from DEMO soldiers viewed their commanding officers
to how black soldiers felt they were being treated to how difficult soldiers found it to serve in
isolated DEMO
But one set of questions Stouffer asked stood out. He quizzed both soldiers serving in the Military
Police and those serving in the Air DEMO (the forerunner of the Air Force) about how good a job they
thought their service did in recognizing and promoting people of ability. DEMO answer was clear.
Military Policemen had a far more positive view of their organization than did enlisted men in the Air
Corps.
On the DEMO of it, that made no sense. The Military Police had one DEMO the worst rates of promotion
in all of the armed forces. The Air Corps had one of DEMO best. The chance of an enlisted man rising to
officer status in the Air Corps was twice that of a soldier in the Military DEMO So, why on earth
would the Military Policemen be more satisfied? The answer, Stouffer famously explained, is that
Military Policemen compared themselves DEMO to other Military Policemen. And if you got a
promotion in the Military Police, that was such a rare event that you were very happy. And if you
didn’t get promoted, you were in the same boat as most of your peers—so you weren’t that unhappy.
“Contrast him DEMO the Air Corps man of the same education and longevity,” Stouffer wrote. His
chance of getting promoted to officer was greater than 50 DEMO “If he had earned a [promotion], so
had the majority of DEMO fellows in the branch, and his achievement was less conspicuous than DEMO the
MP’s. If he had failed to earn a rating while the majority had succeeded, he had more reason to feel a
sense of personal frustration, which could be expressed as criticism of the promotion system.”
Stouffer’s point is that we form our impressions not globally, by placing ourselves in the broadest
possible context, but locally—by comparing ourselves to people “in the same boat as ourselves.” Our
sense of how deprived we DEMO is relative. This is one of those observations that is both obvious and
(upon exploration) deeply profound, and it explains all kinds of otherwise puzzling observations.
Which do you think, for example, has a DEMO suicide rate: countries whose citizens declare
themselves to be very happy, such as Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Canada?
DEMO countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, whose citizens describe themselves as not very
happy at all? Answer: the so-called happy DEMO It’s the same phenomenon as in the Military
Police and the Air Corps. If you are depressed in a place where most people are DEMO unhappy, you
compare yourself to those around you and you don’t DEMO all that bad. But can you imagine how
difficult it must be to be depressed in a country where everyone else has a big DEMO on their face?*
Caroline Sacks’s decision to evaluate herself, then, by looking around her organic chemistry
classroom was not some strange and DEMO behavior. It is what human beings do. We compare
ourselves to those in the same situation as ourselves, which means that students in an elite school—
except, perhaps, those at the very top of the DEMO going to face a burden that they would not face
in a less competitive atmosphere. Citizens of happy countries have higher suicide rates than DEMO
of unhappy countries, because they look at the smiling faces around DEMO and the contrast is too great.
Students at “great” schools look at the brilliant students around them, and how do you think they feel?
The phenomenon of relative deprivation applied to education is called—appropriately enough—
DEMO “Big Fish–Little Pond Effect.” The more elite an educational institution is, DEMO worse students feel
about their own academic abilities. Students who would be at the top of their class at a good school
can easily DEMO to the bottom of a really good school. Students who would feel that they have mastered
a subject at a good school can have DEMO feeling that they are falling farther and farther behind in a
really good school. And that feeling—as subjective and ridiculous and irrational as it DEMO be
—matters. How you feel about your abilities—your academic “self-concept”—in the context of your
classroom shapes your willingness to tackle challenges and finish difficult DEMO It’s a crucial
element in your motivation and confidence.
The Big Fish–Little Pond theory was pioneered by the psychologist Herbert Marsh, and to Marsh,
most parents and students make their school choices for the wrong DEMO “A lot of people think that
going to an academically selective school is going to be good,” DEMO said. “That’s just not true. The
reality is that it is going to be mixed.” He went on: “When I was living in Sydney, there were a small
number of selective public schools that were even more prestigious than the elite private schools. The
tests to get into DEMO were incredibly competitive. So the Sydney Morning Herald—the big
newspaper there—would always call me up whenever they were holding their entrance examinations.
It would DEMO every year, and there was always this pressure to say something DEMO So finally I
just said—and maybe I shouldn’t have—well, if you DEMO to see the positive effects of elite schools
on self-concept, you DEMO measuring the wrong person. You should be measuring the parents.”
6.
What happened to Caroline Sacks is all too common. More than half of DEMO American students who
start out in science, technology, and math programs (or STEM, as they are known) drop out after their
first or second year. Even though a science degree is just about the DEMO valuable asset a young
person can have in the modern economy, DEMO numbers of would-be STEM majors end up switching
into the arts, DEMO academic standards are less demanding and the coursework less competitive.
That’s the major reason that there is such a shortage of qualified American-educated scientists DEMO
engineers in the United States.
To get a sense of who is dropping out—and why—let’s take a look at the science enrollment of a
DEMO in upstate New York called Hartwick College. It’s a small liberal arts college of the sort that
is common in the American Northeast.
Here DEMO all the Hartwick STEM majors divided into three groups—top third, middle DEMO, and
bottom third—according to their test scores in mathematics. The scores DEMO from the SAT, the exam
used by many American colleges as DEMO admissions test. The mathematics section of the test is out of
800 points.*
STEM majors
Math SAT
Top Third
569
Middle Third
472
Bottom DEMO

If we take the SAT as a guide, there’s a DEMO big difference in raw math ability between the best and
the poorest students at Hartwick.
Now let’s look at the portion of all
three DEMO
science degrees at Hartwick that are earned by each of those
STEM degrees
Percent
Top Third
55.0
Middle Third
27.1
Bottom Third
17.8
The DEMO in the top third at Hartwick earn well over half of the school’s science degrees. The
bottom third end up earning only 17.8 percent DEMO Hartwick’s science degrees. The students who come
into Hartwick with the poorest levels of math ability are dropping out of math and science in DEMO
This much seems like common sense. Learning the advanced mathematics and physics DEMO to
become an engineer or scientist is really hard—and only a small number of students clustered at the
top of the class are smart DEMO to handle the material.
Now let’s do the same analysis for Harvard, one of the most prestigious universities in the world.
STEM majors
Math SAT
Top Third
753
Middle Third

Bottom Third

Harvard students, not surprisingly, score far higher on the math SAT than their counterparts at
Hartwick. In fact, the students in Harvard’s bottom third have higher scores than the best students at
Hartwick. If getting a science degree DEMO about how smart you are, then virtually everyone at Harvard
should DEMO up with a degree—right? At least on paper, there is no one at Harvard who lacks the
intellectual firepower to master the coursework. DEMO, let’s take a look at the portion of degrees that
are DEMO by each group.
STEM degrees
Percent
Top Third
53.4
Middle Third
31.2
Bottom Third
15.4
Isn’t that strange? The students in the bottom third of the Harvard class drop out of math and science
just as DEMO as their counterparts in upstate New York. Harvard has the same distribution of
science degrees as Hartwick.
Think about this for a moment. We DEMO a group of high achievers at Hartwick. Let’s call them the
Hartwick All-Stars. And we’ve got another group of lower achievers at Harvard. Let’s DEMO them the
Harvard Dregs. Each is studying the same textbooks and wrestling with the same concepts and trying
to master the same problem sets DEMO courses like advanced calculus and organic chemistry, and
according to test DEMO, they are of roughly equal academic ability. But the overwhelming majority DEMO
Hartwick All-Stars get what they want and end up as engineers or biologists. Meanwhile, the Harvard
Dregs—who go to the far more prestigious school—are so demoralized by their experience that many
of them drop out of DEMO entirely and transfer to some nonscience major. The Harvard Dregs are
Little Fish in a Very Big and Scary Pond. The Hartwick All-Stars are DEMO Fish in a Very Welcoming
Small Pond. What matters, in determining DEMO likelihood of getting a science degree, is not just how
smart DEMO are. It’s how smart you feel relative to the other people in your classroom.
By the way, this pattern holds true for virtually any school you look at—regardless of its academic
quality. The sociologists Rogers Elliott DEMO Christopher Strenta ran these same numbers for eleven
different liberal arts colleges across the United States. Take a look for yourself:
Let’s go back, then, and reconstruct what Caroline Sacks’s thinking should DEMO been when faced
with the choice between Brown and the University of Maryland. By going to Brown, she would
benefit from the prestige of the university. She might have more interesting and wealthier peers. The
connections DEMO made at school and the brand value of Brown on her diploma might give her a leg up
on the job market. These are DEMO classic Big Pond advantages. Brown is the Salon.
But she would be taking a risk. She would dramatically increase her chances of dropping out DEMO
science entirely. How large was that risk? According to research done DEMO Mitchell Chang of the
University of California, the likelihood of someone DEMO a STEM degree—all things being
equal—rises by 2 percentage points for every 10-point decrease in the university’s average SAT
score.* The smarter your peers, the dumber you feel; the dumber you feel, the more likely DEMO are to
drop out of science. Since there is roughly a 150-point gap between the average SAT scores of
students attending the University of DEMO and Brown, the “penalty” Sacks paid by choosing a
great school DEMO a good school is that she reduced her chances of graduating with a science degree
by 30 percent. Thirty percent! At a time when DEMO with liberal arts degrees struggle to find jobs,
students with STEM degrees are almost assured of good careers. Jobs for people with science DEMO
engineering degrees are plentiful and highly paid. That’s a very large risk to take for the prestige of an
Ivy League school.
Let me give you one more example of the DEMO Pond in action. It might be even more striking.
Suppose you are a university looking to hire the best young academics coming out of DEMO school.
What should your hiring strategy be? Should you hire only DEMO from the most elite graduate
schools? Or should you hire students DEMO finished at the top of their class, regardless of what school
DEMO went to?
Most universities follow the first strategy. They even make a boast out of it: We hire only
graduates of the very top schools. But I hope that by this point you are at DEMO a little bit skeptical of
that position. Shouldn’t a Big Fish at a Little Pond be worth at least a second look before a DEMO Fish
at a Big Pond is chosen?
Luckily there is a very simple way to compare those two strategies. It comes from the DEMO of John
Conley and Ali Sina Önder on the graduates of PhD programs in economics. In academic economics,
there are a handful of DEMO journals that everyone in the field reads and respects. The top
journals accept only the best and most creative research and economists rate one DEMO according to
—for the most part—how many research articles they have published in those elite journals. To
figure out the best hiring strategy, then, Conley and Önder argue that all we have to do is compare the
number of papers published by Big Fish in Little Ponds with DEMO number published by Little Fish in
Big Ponds. So what did they find? That the best students from mediocre schools were almost always
a better bet than good students from the very best schools.
I realize DEMO this is a deeply counterintuitive fact. The idea that it might not be a good idea for
universities to hire from Harvard and MIT DEMO crazy. But Conley and Önder’s analysis is hard to
refute.
Let’s start with the top economics PhD programs in North America—all of which are DEMO the
very top programs in the world: Harvard, MIT, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, and the
University of Chicago. Conley and Önder divided up the graduates of each of those programs
according to where DEMO ranked in their class, and then counted up the number of DEMO each PhD
graduate was published in the first six years of his or her academic career.
I realize that this is a lot of numbers. But just look DEMO the left-hand side—the students who finish in the
99th percentile of their class. To publish three or four papers in the most prestigious journals DEMO the
beginning of your career is quite an accomplishment. These people are really good. That much makes
sense. To be the top economics graduate DEMO at MIT or Stanford is an extraordinary achievement.
But then the puzzles start. Look at the 80th percentile column. Schools like MIT and Stanford DEMO
Harvard accept somewhere around two dozen PhD students a year, so DEMO you are in the 80th
percentile, you are roughly fifth or DEMO in your class. These are also extraordinary students. But look
at how few papers the 80th percentile publishes! A fraction of the number of DEMO very best students.
And by the way, look at the last DEMO 55th percentile, the students who are just above
average. They are DEMO enough to make it into one of the most competitive graduate programs in
the world, and to finish their studies in the top half of their class. And yet they barely publish anything
at all. As DEMO economists, they can only be considered disappointments.
Next let’s look at DEMO graduates of mediocre schools. I say “mediocre” only because that’s what
someone from one of those seven elite schools would call them. In the DEMO U.S. News & World
Report rankings of graduate schools, these are DEMO institutions that are buried somewhere near the
bottom of the list. I’ve selected three for comparison purposes. The first is my own alma mater, the
University of Toronto (out of a sense of school spirit!). The second is Boston University. The third is
what Conley and Önder DEMO “non–top 30,” which is simply an average of all the schools at the very,
very bottom of the list.
Do you see what is so fascinating? The very best students at a non–top 30 school—that is, a school so
far down the list that someone from the Ivy League would grimace at the thought of DEMO setting foot
there—have a publication number of 1.05, substantially better than DEMO except the very best
students at Harvard, MIT, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, and Chicago. Are you better off
hiring a Big DEMO from a Tiny, Tiny Pond than even a Middle-Sized Fish from DEMO Big Pond?
Absolutely.
Conley and Önder struggle to explain their own findings.* “To get to Harvard,” they write,
an applicant has DEMO have great grades, perfect test scores, strong and credible recommendations, DEMO know how to package
all this to stand out to the admissions committee. Thus, successful candidates must be hardworking, intelligent, well-trained as
undergraduates, savvy and ambitious. Why is it that the majority of these successful applicants, who were winners and did all
the right things up to the time they applied to graduate school, become so unimpressive after they are trained? Are we failing
the students, or are the students DEMO us?
The answer, of course, is neither. No one is failing anyone. It’s just that the very thing that makes elite
schools DEMO wonderful places for those at the top makes them very difficult places for everyone else.
This is just another version of what happened to DEMO Sacks. The Big Pond takes really bright
students and demoralizes them.
By the way, do you know what elite institution has recognized this very fact about the dangers of
the Big Pond for nearly fifty years? Harvard! In the 1960s, Fred Glimp took over as director of
admissions and instituted what was known as the “happy-bottom-quarter” policy. In one of DEMO first
memos after taking office, he wrote: “Any class, no DEMO how able, will always have a bottom
quarter. What are the DEMO of the psychology of feeling average, even in a very able DEMO? Are
there identifiable types with the psychological or what-not tolerance to DEMO ‘happy’ or to make the
most of education while in the bottom quarter?” He knew exactly how demoralizing the Big Pond was
to DEMO but the best. To Glimp’s mind, his job was to find DEMO who were tough enough and
had enough achievements outside the classroom to be able to survive the stress of being Very Small
Fish in DEMO Very Large Pond. Thus did Harvard begin the practice (which continues DEMO this
day) of letting in substantial numbers of gifted athletes who DEMO academic qualifications well below
the rest of their classmates. If someone is going to be cannon fodder in the classroom, the theory goes,
it’s probably best if that person has an alternative avenue of fulfillment DEMO the football field.
Exactly the same logic applies to the debate over affirmative action. In the United States, there is
an enormous controversy over whether colleges and professional schools should have lower
admissions standards for disadvantaged DEMO Supporters of affirmative action say helping
minorities get into selective schools is justified given the long history of discrimination. Opponents
say that access to DEMO schools is so important that it ought to be done purely on academic merit.
A group in the middle says that using race as DEMO basis for preference is a mistake—and what we
really should be doing is giving preference to people who are poor. What all three groups DEMO for
granted is that being able to get into a great school is such an important advantage that the small
number of spaces at DEMO top are worth fighting over. But why on earth are people convinced that
places at the top are so valuable that they are worth DEMO over?
Affirmative action is practiced most aggressively in law schools, DEMO black students are
routinely offered positions in schools one tier higher than they would otherwise DEMO able to attend. The
result? According to the law professor Richard DEMO, more than half of all African-American law
students in the United DEMO percent—are in the bottom 10 percent of their law school class
and almost three-quarters fall in the bottom 20 percent.* After reading about how DEMO it is to get a
science degree if you’re at the bottom of your class, you’ll probably agree that those statistics are
terrifying. Remember what Caroline Sacks said? Wow, other people are mastering this, even people
who were as clueless as I was in the beginning, and I just can’t seem to learn to think in this
manner. Sacks DEMO stupid. She’s really, really smart. But Brown University made her feel DEMO
and if she truly wanted to graduate with a science degree, DEMO best thing for her to do would have been
to go down a notch to Maryland. No sane person would say that the solution DEMO her problems would
be for her to go to an even more competitive school like Stanford or MIT. Yet when it comes to
affirmative DEMO, that’s exactly what we do. We take promising students like Caroline DEMO
who happen to be black—and offer to bump them up a notch. And why do we do that? Because we
think we’re helping them.
That doesn’t mean affirmative action is wrong. It is something done with DEMO best of intentions, and
elite schools often have resources available to DEMO poor students that other schools do not. But this
does not change the fact that—as Herbert Marsh says—the blessings of the Big Pond are DEMO, and it
is strange how rarely the Big Pond’s downsides are DEMO Parents still tell their children to go to
the best schools they possibly can, on the grounds that the best schools will allow them to do
whatever they wish. We take it for granted that the DEMO Pond expands opportunities, just as we take it
for granted that DEMO smaller class is always a better class. We have a definition in our heads of what an
advantage is—and the definition isn’t right. And DEMO happens as a result? It means that we make
mistakes. It DEMO that we misread battles between underdogs and giants. It means that we
underestimate how much freedom there can be in what looks like a DEMO It’s the Little Pond
that maximizes your chances to do whatever you want.
At the time she was applying to college, Caroline Sacks had no idea she was taking that kind of
chance with the thing DEMO loved. Now she does. At the end of our talk, I DEMO her what would have
happened if she had chosen instead to go to the University of Maryland—to be, instead, a Big Fish in
DEMO Little Pond. She answered without hesitation: “I’d still be in science.”

“I was a very enthusiastic student growing up, and I really DEMO learning and I liked school, and I was
good at it,DEMO Stephen Randolph began.* He is a tall young man with carefully combed dark brown hair
and neatly pressed khakis. “I took high school algebra DEMO in fourth grade. Then I did algebra two
in fifth grade and geometry in sixth grade. By the time I got to middle school, I was going to high
school for math and for biology, chemistry, and Advanced Placement U.S. history. I also went to a
local college starting in fifth grade, taking some math, but I did other DEMO in fifth grade as well. I
actually think by the time I graduated high school, I had more than enough credits to immediately get a
bachelor’s degree from the University of Georgia. I’m pretty certain of DEMO
Every day from first grade until the end of high school, Randolph wore a tie to school. “It’s kind of
embarrassing,” he said, “kind of crazy. But I did it. I forget how it started. DEMO just wanted to wear a tie
one day in first grade and then I just kept doing it. I was a nerd, I guess.”
Randolph was valedictorian of his high school class. His college admission-test scores DEMO
nearly perfect. He was accepted by both Harvard and MIT and chose Harvard. In the first week of
school, he walked through Harvard Yard and marveled at his good fortune. “It occurred to me that
everyone DEMO was a student who got into Harvard. Which was a crazy thought, but it was like, oh,
yeah, all these people are interesting and smart and amazing and this is going to be a DEMO experience.
I was so enthusiastic.”
His story was almost word for word the same as Caroline Sacks’s, and hearing it a second time
made it plain how remarkable the achievement of the Impressionists really was. They DEMO artistic
geniuses. But they were also possessed of a rare wisdom about the world. They were capable of
looking at what the rest of DEMO thought of as a great advantage, and seeing it for what DEMO really was.
Monet, Degas, Cézanne, Renoir, and Pissarro would have gone to their second choice.
So what happened to Stephen Randolph at DEMO? I think you can guess the answer. In his third
year, he took quantum mechanics. “I didn’t do well,” he admitted. “I DEMO I might have gotten a B-
minus.” It was the lowest grade he’d ever received. “My perception was that either I wasn’t good at
DEMO or I wasn’t good enough at it. Maybe I felt that I had to be the best at it or be a genius at DEMO for it to
make sense for me to continue. Some people seemed to get it more quickly than I did—and you tend to
focus DEMO those people and not the ones who are just as lost as you are.
“I was excited by the material,” he continued. “But DEMO was humbled by the experience—humbled as
in, you sit in the DEMO and you don’t understand and you feel like, ‘I will never DEMO able to understand
this!’ And you do problem sets and you understand a little bit of this and a little bit of that, but you
always think that the other people in your class understand it DEMO lot better. I think one of the things
about Harvard is that there’s just so many smart people there that it’s hard to feel DEMO there.” He
decided he couldn’t go on.
“You know, there’s something DEMO solving a math problem that’s very satisfying,” Randolph said
at one point, and an almost wistful look came over his face. “You start with a problem that you may
not know how to solve, but you know there are certain rules you can follow and certain approaches
DEMO can take, and often during this process, the intermediate result is more complex than what you
started with, and then the final result is simple. And there’s a certain joy in making that journey.”
Randolph DEMO to the school he wanted. But did he get the education he wanted? “I think I’m
generally pleased with the way things turned out,” he said. Then he laughed, a little ruefully. “At least
that’s what I tell myself.”
At the end of his third year in DEMO, Randolph decided to take the entrance exam for law school.
After DEMO, he took a job with a law firm in Manhattan. Harvard DEMO the world a physicist and
gave the world another lawyer. “I do tax law,” Randolph said. “It’s funny. There are a fair number DEMO
math and physics majors who end up in tax law.”

I was given a thorn in my DEMO, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
But he said DEMO me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more
gladly DEMO my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That DEMO why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in
insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

YOU WOULDN’T WISH DYSLEXIA ON YOUR CHILD. OR DEMO YOU?
1.
If you do a brain scan on a person with dyslexia, the images that are produced seem strange. In certain
critical parts of the brain—those that deal with reading and processing words—dyslexics have DEMO
gray matter. They don’t have as many brain cells in those regions as they should. As the fetus
develops inside the womb, neurons are supposed to travel to the appropriate areas of the brain, taking
their places like pieces on a chessboard. But for some reason, the neurons of dyslexics sometimes get
lost along the way. They end up in DEMO wrong place. The brain has something called the ventricular
system, which DEMO as the brain’s entry and exit point. Some people with reading disorders have
neurons lining their ventricles, like passengers stranded in an airport.
While an image of the brain is being made, a patient performs a task, and then a neuroscientist
looks to see what parts of the brain have been activated in response to that task. If you ask DEMO dyslexic
to read when he or she is having a brain scan, the parts that are supposed to light up might not light up
at all. The scan looks like an aerial photo of a city DEMO a blackout. Dyslexics use a lot more of the
right hemisphere of their brains during reading than normal readers do. The right hemisphere is DEMO
conceptual side. That’s the wrong half of the brain for a precise and rigorous task like reading.
Sometimes when a dyslexic reads, every step will be delayed, as if the different parts of the brain
responsible for reading were communicating via a weak connection. One of the ways DEMO test for the
presence of dyslexia in a small child is to have him engage in “rapid automatized naming.” Show him
one color after DEMO red dot, then a green dot, then a blue dot, DEMO a yellow dot—and check his
response. See the color. Recognize the color. Attach a name to the color. Say the name. That’s
automatic in DEMO of us. It’s not in someone with a reading disorder; somewhere DEMO the way, the
links between those four steps start to break DEMO Ask a four-year-old: Can you say the word
“banana” without the DEMO? Or say, Listen to the following three sounds: cuh, ah, and tuh. Can you
combine them into “cat”? Or take “cat,DEMO “hat,” and “dark.” Which one of those words doesn’t rhyme?
Easy questions for most four-year-olds. Really hard questions for dyslexics. Many people DEMO to
think that what defines dyslexics is that they get words backwards—“cat” would be “tac,” or
something like that—making it sound like dyslexia DEMO a problem in the way the words are seen. But it
is much more profound than that. Dyslexia is a problem in the way DEMO hear and manipulate
sounds. The difference between bah and dah is a subtlety in the first 40 milliseconds of the syllable.
Human language is DEMO on the assumption that we can pick up that 40-millisecond difference, DEMO
the difference between the bah sound and the dah sound can be the difference between getting
something right and getting something catastrophically wrong. Can DEMO imagine the consequences of
having a brain so sluggish that when it comes to putting together DEMO building blocks of words, those
crucial 40 milliseconds simply go by DEMO quickly?
“If you have no concept of the sounds of language—if you take away a letter, if you take away a
sound, DEMO you don’t know what to do, then it’s really hard to DEMO the sounds to the written
counterparts,” Nadine Gaab, a dyslexia DEMO at Harvard, explained. “It may take you a while to
learn DEMO read. You read really slowly, which then impairs your reading fluency, which then impairs
your reading comprehension, because you’re so slow that by the time you’re at the end of the
sentence, you’ve forgotten what the beginning of the sentence was. So it leads to all these DEMO in
middle school or high school. Then it starts affecting all other subjects in school. You can’t read.
How are you going to do DEMO math tests that have a lot of writing in them? Or DEMO do you take an exam
in social studies if it takes you two hours to read what they want from you?
“Usually you DEMO a diagnosis at eight or nine,” she went on. “And we find that by that point, there
are already a lot of serious psychological implications, because by that time, you’ve been struggling
for three DEMO Maybe you were the cool kid on the playground when you were four. Then you
entered kindergarten and all your peers suddenly started reading, and you can’t figure it out. So you
get frustrated. Your peers DEMO think you’re stupid. Your parents may think you’re lazy. You have very
low self-esteem, which leads to an increased rate of depression. Kids with dyslexia are more likely
to end up in the juvenile system, because they act up. It’s because they can’t figure things out. It’s so
DEMO in our society to read.”
You wouldn’t wish dyslexia on your child. Or would you?

So far in David and Goliath, we’ve looked at the ways in which we are often misled about the DEMO
of advantages. Now it is time to turn our attention to the other side of the ledger. What do we mean
when we call DEMO a disadvantage? Conventional wisdom holds that a disadvantage is
something that DEMO to be avoided—that it is a setback or a difficulty that leaves you worse off than
you would be otherwise. But that is not DEMO the case. In the next few chapters, I want to explore
DEMO idea that there are such things as “desirable difficulties.” That concept was conceived by Robert
Bjork and Elizabeth Bjork, two psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and it is a
beautiful and haunting DEMO of understanding how underdogs come to excel.
Consider, for example, the following puzzle.
1. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. DEMO bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the
ball cost?
What’s your instinctive response? I’m guessing that it is that the ball must cost 10 cents. That can’t
be right, though, DEMO it? The bat is supposed to cost $1.00 more than the DEMO So if the ball costs 10
cents, the bat must cost DEMO, and we’ve exceeded our total. The right answer must be that DEMO ball
costs 5 cents.
Here’s another question:
2. If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to
make 100 widgets?
The setup of the question tempts you to DEMO 100. But it’s a trick. One hundred machines take
exactly the same amount of time to make 100 widgets as 5 machines take to DEMO 5 widgets. The right
answer is 5 minutes.
These puzzles are two of the three questions that make up the world’s shortest intelligence test.*
DEMO called the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). It was invented by DEMO Yale professor Shane
Frederick, and it measures your ability to understand DEMO something is more complex than it appears
—to move past impulsive answers to deeper, analytic judgments.
Frederick argues that if you want a quick way to sort people according to their level of basic
cognitive ability, his little test is almost as useful as tests that have hundreds DEMO items and take several
hours to finish. To prove his point, DEMO gave the CRT to students at nine American colleges,
and the results track pretty closely with how students from those colleges would rank DEMO more
traditional intelligence tests.* Students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—perhaps the
brainiest college in the world—averaged 2.18 correct answers out of three. Students DEMO Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, another extraordinarily elite institution, averaged 1.51 right answers
out of three. Harvard students scored 1.43; the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1.18; and the
University of Toledo 0.57.
The CRT is really hard. But here’s the strange thing. Do you know DEMO easiest way to raise
people’s scores on the test? Make it DEMO a little bit harder. The psychologists Adam Alter and Daniel
Oppenheimer tried this a few years ago with a group of undergraduates at Princeton DEMO First
they gave the CRT the normal way, and the students DEMO 1.9 correct answers out of three. That’s
pretty good, though it DEMO well short of the 2.18 that MIT students averaged. Then Alter and
Oppenheimer printed out the test questions in a font that was really DEMO to read—a 10 percent gray,
10-point italics Myriad Pro font—so that it looked like this:
1. A bat and a ball cost DEMO in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
The average score this time around? 2.45. Suddenly, the students were doing much better than their
counterparts at MIT.
That’s strange, isn’t it? Normally we think that we are better DEMO solving problems when they are
presented clearly and simply. But here the opposite happened. A 10 percent gray, 10-point italics
Myriad Pro font makes reading really frustrating. You have to squint a little bit and maybe DEMO the
sentence twice, and you probably wonder halfway through who on DEMO thought it was a good idea to
print out the test this way. Suddenly you have to work to read the question.
Yet all DEMO extra effort pays off. As Alter says, making the questions “disfluent” DEMO people to
“think more deeply about whatever they come across. They’ll use more resources on it. They’ll
process more deeply or think more carefully DEMO what’s going on. If they have to overcome a
hurdle, they’ll DEMO it better when you force them to think a little harder.” Alter and
Oppenheimer made the CRT more difficult. But that difficulty turned out DEMO be desirable.
Not all difficulties have a silver lining, of course. DEMO Caroline Sacks went through, in her
organic chemistry class at Brown DEMO an undesirable difficulty. She is a curious, hardworking,
talented student who loves science—and there was no advantage to putting her DEMO a situation where
she felt demoralized and inadequate. The struggle did not give her a new appreciation of science. It
scared her away from DEMO But there are times and places where struggles have the opposite effect
—where what seems like the kind of obstacle that ought to cripple DEMO underdog’s chances is actually
like Alter and Oppenheimer’s Myriad Pro 10 percent gray, 10-point italics font.
Can dyslexia turn out to be a desirable difficulty? It is hard to believe that it can, given how DEMO
people struggle with the disorder throughout their lives—except for a strange fact. An extraordinarily
high number of successful entrepreneurs are dyslexic. A recent study DEMO Julie Logan at City University
London puts the number somewhere around a third. The list includes many of the most famous
innovators of the DEMO few decades. Richard Branson, the British billionaire entrepreneur, is dyslexic.
Charles Schwab, the founder of the discount brokerage that bears his name, DEMO dyslexic, as are the cell
phone pioneer Craig McCaw; David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue; John Chambers, the CEO of
the technology giant Cisco; Paul Orfalea, the founder of Kinko’s—to name just a DEMO The
neuroscientist Sharon Thompson-Schill remembers speaking at a meeting of prominent university
donors—virtually all of them successful businesspeople—and on a whim asking how many DEMO them
had ever been diagnosed with a learning disorder. “Half the hands went up,” she said. “It was
unbelievable.”
There are two possible DEMO for this fact. One is that this remarkable group of people
triumphed in spite of their disability: they are so smart and so creative that nothing—not even a
lifetime of struggling with reading—could stop them. The DEMO, more intriguing, possibility is that
they succeeded, in part, because of their disorder—that they learned something in their struggle that
proved to DEMO of enormous advantage. Would you wish dyslexia on your child? If DEMO second of these
possibilities is true, you just might.

David DEMO grew up in farming country in rural Illinois. He was the eldest of five. His parents were
public school teachers. His mother would read DEMO him when he was young. He would memorize what
she said because he couldn’t follow what was on the page. He didn’t begin to DEMO until the third
grade, and then did so only slowly and DEMO great difficulty. Many years later, he would realize that
he had DEMO But at the time, he didn’t think he had a problem. DEMO little town in rural Illinois
wasn’t a place that regarded reading well as some crucial badge of achievement. Many of his
schoolmates quit school DEMO work on the farm the first chance they got. Boies read comic books, which
were easy to follow and had lots of pictures. He never read for fun. Even today, he might read one
book a year, if that. He watches television—anything, he says with a laugh, “that moves and is in
color.” His speaking vocabulary is limited. He DEMO small words and short sentences. Sometimes if
he’s reading something out loud and runs into a word he doesn’t know, he will stop and spell it out
slowly. “My wife gave me an iPad a year DEMO a half ago, which was my first computer-like device,
and DEMO of the things that was interesting is that my attempt to spell many words is not close enough
for spell-check to find the correct DEMO,” Boies says. “I can’t tell you how many times I get the
little message that says, ‘No spelling suggestions.’ ”
When Boies graduated from high school, he didn’t have any great ambitions. His grades had been
“ragged.” His family had moved to Southern California by then, and the local economy was booming.
He got a job in construction. “It was DEMO work, with older guys,” Boies remembers. “I was
making more DEMO than I could ever have imagined. It was a lot of fun.” After that, he worked for a
while as a bookkeeper in a bank while playing a lot of bridge on the side. “It was DEMO great life. I could
have gone on like that for a while. But after our first child was born, my wife became increasingly
serious-minded about my future.” She brought home brochures and pamphlets from local colleges DEMO
universities. He remembered a childhood fascination with the law and decided that he would go to
law school. Today David Boies is one of DEMO most famous trial lawyers in the world.
How Boies went from a construction worker with a high school education to the top of the DEMO
profession is a puzzle, to say the least. The law is DEMO around reading—around cases and opinions
and scholarly analyses—and Boies is someone for whom reading is a struggle. It seems crazy that he
would even DEMO considered the law. But let’s not forget that if you are reading this book, then you
are a reader—and that means you’ve probably never had to think of all the shortcuts and strategies
and bypasses that DEMO to get around reading.
Boies started college at the University of Redlands, a small private university an hour east of Los
Angeles. Going there was his first break. Redlands was a Small Pond. Boies excelled there. DEMO
worked hard and was very well organized—because he knew he had to be. Then he got lucky.
Redlands required a number of core courses DEMO graduation, all of which involved heavy reading
requirements. In those years, however, one could apply to law school without completing an
undergraduate degree. Boies simply skipped the core courses. “I remember when I found out DEMO could
go to law school without graduating,” he says. “It was so great. I couldn’t believe it.”
Law school, of course, required DEMO more reading. But Boies discovered that there were
summaries of the major cases—guides that would boil down the key point of a long Supreme DEMO
opinion to a page or so. “People might tell you that’s an undesirable way to do law school,” he says.
“But it was DEMO Plus, he was a good listener. “Listening,” he says, “is something I’ve been
doing essentially all my life. I learned to do DEMO because that was the only way that I could learn. I
remember what people say. I remember words they use.” So he would sit DEMO class at law school—
while everyone else furiously made notes or doodled or lapsed into daydreams or faded in and out—
focusing on what DEMO said and committing what he heard to memory. His memory by that point was a
formidable instrument. He had been exercising it, after all, ever since his mother read to him as a
child and he memorized what she said. His fellow students, as they made notes and doodled and
faded in and out, missed things. Their attention was compromised. Boies
might not have been a reader, but the things he was
turned out to be even more valuable. He started out
to Yale.

, a job that required him to
think on his feet. He memorizes what he needs to say. Sometimes DEMO court he stumbles when he has to
read something and comes across a word that he cannot process in time. So he stops and DEMO it out,
like a child in a spelling bee. It’s awkward. It’s more of an eccentricity, though, than an actual
problem. In DEMO 1990s, he headed the prosecution team accusing Microsoft of antitrust violations, and
during the trial, he kept referring to “login” as “lojin,” which is just the kind of mistake a dyslexic
makes. But he DEMO devastating in the cross-examination of witnesses, because there was no nuance,DEMO
no subtle evasion, no peculiar and telling choice of words that DEMO would miss—and no stray comment
or revealing admission from testimony an hour or a day or a week before that he would not have
DEMO, registered, and remembered.
“If I could read a lot faster, DEMO would make a lot of things that I do easier,” Boies said. “There’s no
doubt about that. But on the other hand, not being able to read a lot and learning by listening and
asking DEMO means that I need to simplify issues to their basics. And that is very powerful,
because in trial cases, judges and jurors—neither of them have the time or the ability to become an
expert in DEMO subject. One of my strengths is presenting a case that they can understand.” His
opponents tend to be scholarly types, who have read every conceivable analysis of the issue at hand.
Time and again, they get bogged down in excessive detail. Boies doesn’t.
One of his most famous DEMO v. Schwarzenegger*—involved a California law
limiting marriage to a man and woman. Boies was the attorney arguing that the law was
unconstitutional, and in the trial’s most memorable exchange, Boies destroyed the other side’s key
expert witness, David Blankenhorn, getting him to concede huge chunks of Boies’s DEMO
“One of the things you tell a witness when you’re preparing them is take your time,” Boies said.
“Even when you don’t need DEMO Because there will be some times when you need to slow down, and
you don’t want to show the examiner by your change of pace that this is something that you need time
on. So—when were DEMO born?” He spoke carefully and deliberately. “ ‘It…was…1941.’ You don’t
say, ‘ItwasMarcheleventh1941atsix-thirtyinthemorning,’ even though you’re not trying to hide it. You
want your response to be the same for the easy things as for DEMO harder things so that you don’t reveal
what’s easy and what’s hard by the way you answer.”
When Blankenhorn paused just a bit too DEMO in certain crucial moments, Boies caught it. “It was
tone and DEMO and the words he used. Some of it comes from pauses. He’d slow down when he was
trying to think of how to phrase DEMO He was somebody who as you probed him and listened to
him, you could hear areas where he was uncomfortable—where he would use an obscuring word.
And by being able to zero in on those areas, I was able to get him to admit the key elements of DEMO
case.”

Boies has a particular skill that helps to explain why he is so good at what he does. He’s a superb
listener. DEMO think about how he came to develop that skill. Most of us gravitate naturally toward the
areas where we excel. The child who picks DEMO reading easily goes on to read even more and becomes
even better at it, and ends up in a field that requires a lot of reading. A young boy named Tiger Woods
is unusually coordinated for his age and finds that the game of DEMO suits his imagination, and so he
likes to practice golf. And DEMO he likes to practice so much, he gets even better, and on and on, in
a virtuous circle. That’s “capitalization learning”: we DEMO good at something by building on the
strengths that we are naturally given.
But desirable difficulties have the opposite logic. In their CRT experiments, Alter and
Oppenheimer made students excel by making their lives harder, by forcing them to compensate for
something that had been taken away from DEMO That’s what Boies was doing as well when he learned
to listen. He was compensating. He had no choice. He was such a terrible DEMO that he had to
scramble and adapt and come up with some kind of strategy that allowed him to keep pace with
everyone around DEMO
Most of the learning that we do is capitalization learning. It is easy and obvious. If you have a
beautiful voice and perfect pitch, it doesn’t take much to get you to join a choir. “Compensation
DEMO,” on the other hand, is really hard. Memorizing what your DEMO says while she reads to you
and then reproducing the words later in such a way that it sounds convincing to all those around DEMO
requires that you confront your limitations. It requires that you overcome your insecurity and
humiliation. It requires that you focus hard enough to memorize DEMO words, and then have the panache
to put on a successful DEMO Most people with a serious disability cannot master all those
steps. But those who can are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned
out of necessity is inevitably more powerful than DEMO learning that comes easily.
It is striking how often successful dyslexics tell versions of this same compensation story. “It was
horrible to be in DEMO,” a man named Brian Grazer told me. “My body chemistry would always
change. I would be anxious, really anxious. It would take forever to do a simple homework
assignment. I would spend hours daydreaming because DEMO couldn’t really read the words. You’d find
yourself sitting in one place for an hour and a half accomplishing nothing. Through seventh, eighth,
ninth, and tenth grade, I was getting mostly Fs, with an occasional D and maybe a C. I was only
passing because my DEMO wouldn’t let them put me back.”
So how did Grazer get through school? Before any test or exam, he would start to plan DEMO
strategize, even in elementary school. “I would get together with someone DEMO night before,” he said.
“What are you going to do? DEMO do you think you will answer these questions? I’d try and DEMO the
questions, or if there was a way to get the DEMO or the tests beforehand, I would.”
By the time he hit DEMO school, he’d developed a better strategy. “I challenged all my grades,DEMO he
went on, “which meant that literally every time I got DEMO grade in high school, after the report cards
came out, I would go back to each teacher and do a one-on-one. I would DEMO my D into a C and my
C into a B. And almost every time—ninety percent of the time—I got my grade changed. I DEMO just
wear them down. I got really good at it. I got confident. In college, I would study, knowing that I was
going DEMO have this hour-long meeting afterward with my professor. I learned how to do everything
possible to sell my point. It was really good training.”
DEMO good parents try to teach their children the art of persuasion, DEMO course. But a normal, well-
adjusted child has no need to DEMO those lessons seriously. If you get As in school, you never DEMO to
figure out how to negotiate your way to a passing grade, or to look around the room as a nine-year-old
and start strategizing about how to make it through the next hour. DEMO when Grazer practiced
negotiation, just as when Boies practiced listening, he had a gun to his head. He practiced day in, day
out, year after year. When Grazer said that was “really good training,” what he meant was learning to
talk his way from a position DEMO weakness to a position of strength turned out to be the perfect
preparation for the profession he ended up in. Grazer is now one DEMO the most successful movie
producers in Hollywood of the past thirty years.* Would Brian Grazer be where he is if he weren’t a
dyslexic?DEMO

Let’s dig a little deeper into this strange association between what is essentially a neurological
malfunction and career success. In the Big Pond DEMO, I talked about the fact that being on the
outside, in a less elite and less privileged environment, can give you more freedom to pursue your
own ideas and academic interests. Caroline Sacks would have DEMO a better chance of practicing the
profession she loved if she had gone to her second-choice school instead of her first choice.
Impressionism, similarly, was possible only in the tiny gallery that virtually no one went to, not in the
most prestigious art show on earth.
Dyslexics are outsiders as well. They are forced to stand apart from everyone else DEMO school
because they can’t do the thing that school requires them to do. Is it possible for that “outsiderness” to
give them some kind DEMO advantage down the line? To answer that question, it is worth thinking about
the kind of personality that characterizes innovators and entrepreneurs.
Psychologists DEMO personality through what is called the Five Factor Model, or “Big DEMO
inventory, which assesses who we are across the following dimensions.*
Neuroticism
(sensitive/nervous versus secure/confident)
Extraversion
(energetic/gregarious versus solitary/reserved)
Openness
(inventive/curious versus consistent/cautious)
Conscientiousness
(orderly/industrious DEMO easygoing/careless)
Agreeableness
(cooperative/empathic versus self-interested/antagonistic)
The DEMO Jordan Peterson argues that innovators and revolutionaries tend to have a very
particular mix of these traits—particularly the last three: openness, conscientiousness, and
agreeableness.
Innovators have to be open. They have to be able to DEMO things that others cannot and to be
willing to challenge their own preconceptions. They also need to be conscientious. An innovator who
has brilliant DEMO but lacks the discipline and persistence to carry them out is merely a dreamer.
That, too, is obvious.
But crucially, innovators need to be disagreeable. By disagreeable, I don’t mean obnoxious or
unpleasant. I mean that on that fifth dimension of the Big Five personality inventory, “agreeableness,”
they tend to be on the far end of the continuum. They DEMO people willing to take social risks—to do
things that others might disapprove of.
That is not easy. Society frowns on disagreeableness. As human beings DEMO are hardwired to seek
the approval of those around us. Yet a radical and transformative thought goes nowhere without the
willingness to challenge convention. DEMO you have a new idea, and it’s disruptive and you’re
agreeable, then what are you going to do with that?” says Peterson. DEMO you worry about hurting
people’s feelings and disturbing the social structure, DEMO not going to put your ideas forward.” As
the playwright George Bernard Shaw once put it: “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world:
the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to DEMO Therefore all progress depends
on the unreasonable man.”
A good example of Peterson’s argument is the story of how the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA DEMO
its start. The company was founded by Ingvar Kamprad. His great innovation was to realize that much
of the cost of furniture was tied DEMO in its assembly: putting the legs on the table not only DEMO money
but also makes shipping the table really expensive. So he sold furniture that hadn’t yet been
assembled, shipped it cheaply in flat boxes, and undersold all his competitors.
In the mid-1950s, however, Kamprad ran into trouble. Swedish furniture manufacturers launched a
boycott of IKEA. They were DEMO at his low prices, and they stopped filling his orders. IKEA DEMO
ruin. Desperate for a solution, Kamprad looked south and realized just DEMO the Baltic Sea from
Sweden was Poland, a country with much DEMO labor and plenty of wood. That’s Kamprad’s
openness: few companies were DEMO like that in the early 1960s. Then Kamprad focused his
attention on making the Polish connection work. It wasn’t easy. Poland in the 1960s DEMO a mess. It
was a Communist country. It had none of the infrastructure or machinery or trained workforce or legal
protections of a Western DEMO But Kamprad pulled it off. “He is a micromanager,” says Anders
Åslund, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “That’s why he succeeded
where others failed. He went out to these unpleasant places, and made sure things worked. He’s this
extremely stubborn character.” That’s conscientiousness.
DEMO what is the most striking fact about Kamprad’s decision? It’s the DEMO he went to Poland: 1961.
The Berlin Wall was going up. DEMO Cold War was at its peak. Within a year, East and DEMO would
come to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The equivalent today would be
Walmart setting up shop in North DEMO Most people wouldn’t even think of doing business in the
land of the enemy for fear of being branded a traitor. Not Kamprad. He DEMO care a whit for what
others thought of him. That’s disagreeableness.
Only a very small number of people have the creativity to think of DEMO furniture flat and
outsourcing in the face of a boycott. An even smaller number have not only those kinds of insights but
also the DEMO to build a first-class manufacturing operation in an economic backwater. But to be
creative and conscientious and have the strength of mind to defy DEMO Cold War? That’s rare.
Dyslexia doesn’t necessarily make people more open. DEMO does it make them more conscientious
(although it certainly might). DEMO the most tantalizing possibility raised by the disorder is that it might
make it a little bit easier to be disagreeable.

Gary Cohn grew up in a suburb of Cleveland, in northeast Ohio. His family was in the electrical
contracting business. This was in DEMO 1970s, at a time before dyslexia was routinely diagnosed. He
was DEMO back a year in elementary school because he couldn’t read.* But, DEMO said, “I didn’t do any
better the second time than I DEMO the first time.” He had a discipline problem. “I sort of got expelled
from elementary school,” he explained. “I think when you hit DEMO teacher, you get expelled. It was one
of those disruptive incidents.…I DEMO being abused. The teacher put me under her desk and rolled her
chair in and started kicking me. So I pushed the chair back, hit her in the face, and walked out. I was
in fourth grade.”
He called that period in his life “the ugly years.” His DEMO didn’t know what to do. “It was
probably the most frustrating part of my life, which is saying a lot.” He went on: DEMO it wasn’t
that I wasn’t trying. I was working really, really DEMO, and no one understood that part of the equation.
They literally DEMO that I was conscientiously making decisions to be a disruptive kid, DEMO not learn,
to hold the class back. You know what it’s like, you’re a six- or seven- or eight-year-old kid, and
you’re DEMO a public school setting, and everyone thinks you’re an idiot, so you try to do funny things to
try to create some social DEMO You’d try to get up every morning and say, today is DEMO to be
better, but after you do that a couple of DEMO, you realize that today is going to be no different than
DEMO And I’m going to have to struggle to get through and I’m going to struggle to survive
another day, and we’ll see what happens.”
His parents took him from school to school, trying to find something that worked. “All my mother
wanted me to do was graduate high DEMO,” Cohn said. “I think if you’d asked her, she’d have DEMO,
‘The happiest day of my life will be if he graduates high school. Then he can go drive a truck, but at
least he’ll have a high school degree.’ ” On the day he finally DEMO graduate, Cohn’s mother was a
fountain of tears. “I’ve never seen DEMO cry so much in my life,” he said.
When Gary Cohn was twenty-two, he got a job selling aluminum siding and window frames for
U.S. Steel in Cleveland. He had just graduated from American University DEMO a middling academic
career. One day just before Thanksgiving, while visiting DEMO company’s sales office on Long Island,
he persuaded his manager to give him the day off and ventured down to Wall Street. A DEMO summers
earlier, he had been an intern at a local brokerage DEMO and had become interested in trading. He
headed to the commodities exchange, which was part of the old World Trade Center complex.
“I think I’m going to get a job,” he said. “But there’s nowhere DEMO go. It’s all secure. So I go up to
the observation deck and watch the guys and think, Can I talk to them? DEMO I walk down to the floor
with the security gate and stand at the security gate, like someone’s going to let me in. Of course no
one is. And then literally right after the market’s closed, I see this pretty well-dressed guy running off
the floor, yelling to his clerk, ‘I’ve got to go, I’m running to LaGuardia, I’m late, I’ll call you when I
get to the airport.’ I jump in the elevator, and I say, ‘I hear you’re going to DEMO He says,
‘Yeah.’ I say, ‘Can we share a cab?DEMO He says, ‘Sure.’ I think this is awesome. With Friday afternoon
DEMO, I can spend the next hour in the taxi getting a DEMO
The stranger Cohn had jumped into the cab with happened to be high up at one of Wall Street’s big
brokerage firms. And just that week, the firm had opened a business buying and selling options.
“The guy was running the options business but DEMO not know what an option was,” Cohn went on.
He was laughing at the sheer audacity of it all. “I lied to him DEMO the way to the airport. When he said,
‘Do you know what an option is?’ I said, ‘Of course I do, DEMO know everything, I can do anything for
you.’ Basically by the DEMO we got out of the taxi, I had his number. He DEMO, ‘Call me Monday.’ I
called him Monday, flew back to New York Tuesday or Wednesday, had an interview, and started
working the DEMO Monday. In that period of time, I read McMillan’s Options as DEMO Strategic
Investment book. It’s like the Bible of options trading.”
It wasn’t easy, of course, since Cohn estimates that on a good day, it takes him six hours to read
twenty-two pages.* He buried himself DEMO the book, working his way through one word at a time,DEMO
repeating sentences until he was sure he understood them. When he started at work, he was ready. “I
literally stood behind him and said, ‘Buy those, sell those, sell those,’ ” Cohn said. “I never owned
up to him what I did. Or maybe he figured DEMO out, but he didn’t care. I made him tons of money.”
DEMO isn’t ashamed of his beginnings on Wall Street. But it would be a mistake, at the same time, to
say that he is DEMO of them. He is smart enough to know that a story about bluffing your way into your
first job isn’t altogether flattering. He told DEMO, instead, in the spirit of honesty. It was This is who I am.
Cohn was required in that taxi ride to play a DEMO: to pretend to be an experienced options trader
when in fact DEMO was not. Most of us would have foundered in that situation. We aren’t used to playing
someone other than ourselves. But Cohn had been DEMO someone other than himself since
elementary school. You know what it’s like, you’re a six- or seven- or eight-year-old kid, and
you’re in DEMO public school setting, and everyone thinks you’re an idiot, so you try to do funny things
to try to create some social esteem. DEMO to play the clown than to be thought of as an idiot. And if
you’ve been pretending to be someone else your whole life, how hard is it to bluff your way through a
one-hour cab DEMO to LaGuardia?
More important, most of us wouldn’t have jumped DEMO that cab, because we would have worried
about the potential social DEMO The Wall Street guy could have seen right through us—and
told everyone else on Wall Street that there’s a kid out there posing as DEMO options trader. Where
would we be then? We could get tossed DEMO of the cab. We could go home and realize that options
trading is over our heads. We could show up on Monday morning and DEMO fools of ourselves. We
could get found out, a week or DEMO month later, and get fired. Jumping in the cab was a DEMO act,
and most of us are inclined to be agreeable. But Cohn? He was selling aluminum siding. His mother
thought that he would be lucky to end up a truck driver. He had been kicked DEMO of schools and
dismissed as an idiot, and, even as an adult, it took him six hours to read twenty-two pages because
he had to work his way word by word to make sure he DEMO what he was reading. He had
nothing to lose.
“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait DEMO a lot of
dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was
very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see DEMO more of the upside than the
downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it
many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my
dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”
Dyslexia—in the best DEMO cases—forces you to develop skills that might otherwise have lain
dormant. It also forces you to do things that you might otherwise never have DEMO, like doing
your own version of Kamprad’s disagreeable trip to Poland DEMO hopping in the cab of someone you’ve
never met and pretending to be someone you aren’t. Kamprad, in case you are wondering, is DEMO
And Gary Cohn? It turns out he was a really good DEMO, and it turns out that learning how to deal
with the DEMO of failure is really good preparation for a career in the business world. Today he
is the president of Goldman Sachs.

Emil “Jay” Freireich
“HOW JAY DID IT, I DON’T KNOW.”
1.
When Jay Freireich was very young, his father died suddenly. The Freireichs were Hungarian
immigrants who were running a restaurant in Chicago. It DEMO just after the stock market crash in 1929.
They lost everything. “They found him in the bathroom,” Freireich said. “I think it was DEMO,
because he felt all alone. He had come to Chicago because he had a brother there. When the crash
occurred, the brother left town. He had a wife, two small children, no money, a restaurant gone. He
must have been pretty desperate.”
Freireich’s mother went to DEMO in a sweatshop, sewing brims on hats. She made two cents DEMO hat.
She didn’t speak much English. “She had to work eighteen hours a day, seven days a week, to make
enough money to DEMO an apartment for us to rent,” Freireich went on. “We never saw her. We had a
little apartment on the west side of DEMO Park, bordering the ghetto. She couldn’t leave a two-
year-old and DEMO five-year-old all alone, so she found an immigrant Irish lady who DEMO for room
and board. My parent, from the age of two, was this Irish maid. We loved her. She was my mother.
Then, when I was nine, my mother met a Hungarian man who had lost his wife and had one son, and
she married him. It was a marriage of convenience. He couldn’t take care of his son DEMO himself, and
she didn’t have anybody. He was a really bitter, shriveled guy. So they got married and my mother
left the sweatshop DEMO appeared back on the scene, and they couldn’t afford the maid DEMO So
they fired her. They fired my mother. I never forgave my mother for that.”
The family moved from one apartment to another. They DEMO protein one day a week. Freireich
remembers being sent from store to store looking for a bottle of milk for four cents, because the
normal price of five cents was more than the family could afford. DEMO spent his days on the street. He
stole. He wasn’t close to his sister. She was more disciplinarian than friend. He didn’t like his
DEMO In any case, the marriage didn’t last. He didn’t like his DEMO either. “Whatever mind she
had was destroyed in the sweatshops,” he said. “She was an angry person. And when she married this
ugly DEMO, who brought this person in—my half brother—who got half of everything DEMO used to get, and
then she fired my mother…” His voice DEMO off.
Freireich was sitting at his desk. He was wearing a white coat. Everything he was talking about
was both long ago and—in another, more important sense—not long ago at all. “I can’t remember her
ever DEMO or kissing me or anything like that,” he said. “She never talked about my father. I have no
idea whether he was nice DEMO her or mean. I never heard a word. Do I ever think about what he might
have been like? All the time. I have one picture.” Freireich turned in his chair and clicked on a file DEMO
pictures on his computer. Up came a grainy early-twentieth-century photograph of a man who, not
surprisingly, looked a lot like Freireich himself. “That’s the only picture of him my mother ever had,”
he said. The edges of the DEMO were uneven. It had been cropped from a much larger family
photograph.
I asked about the Irish maid who raised him. What was her DEMO? He stopped short—a rare pause
for him. “I don’t know,” DEMO said. “It will pop into my head, I’m sure.” He sat DEMO for a moment and
concentrated. “My sister would remember, my mother DEMO remember. But they are no longer alive.
I have no living relatives—just two cousins.” He paused again. “I want to call her Mary. And DEMO
may actually be her name. But my mother’s name was Mary. So I may be confusing it…”
Freireich was eighty-four years old when we DEMO But it would be a mistake to call this an age-
related memory lapse. Jay Freireich does not have memory lapses. I interviewed him DEMO the first time
one spring and then again six months later, DEMO again after that, and every time, he would recall dates
and names and facts with clocklike precision, and if he went over the same ground as he had on some
previous occasion, he would stop himself and say, “I know I said this to you before.” He could not
retrieve the name of the woman who raised him because DEMO from those years was so painful
that it had been pushed to the furthest recesses of his mind.
2.
In the years leading up DEMO the Second World War, the British government was worried. If, in the event
of war, the German Air Force launched a major air offensive against London, the British military
command believed that there was nothing they could do to stop it. Basil Liddell Hart, one of the
foremost military theorists of the day, estimated that in the first week of any German attack, London
could see a quarter of a million civilian deaths and injuries. Winston Churchill described London as
“the greatest target DEMO the world, a kind of tremendous, fat, valuable cow, tied up to attract the beast of
prey.” He predicted that the city DEMO be so helpless in the face of attack that between three and four
million Londoners would flee to the countryside. In 1937, on the eve of the war, the British military
command issued a report with the direst prediction of all: a sustained German bombing attack would
leave six hundred thousand dead and 1.2 million wounded and create mass panic DEMO the streets.
People would refuse to go to work. Industrial production would grind to a halt. The army would be
useless against the Germans DEMO it would be preoccupied with keeping order among the millions
of panicked civilians. The country’s planners briefly considered building a massive network of
underground DEMO shelters across London, but they abandoned the plan out of a DEMO that if they did,
the people who took refuge there would never come out. They set up several psychiatric hospitals just
outside the DEMO limits to handle what they expected would be a flood of psychological casualties.
“There is every chance,” the report stated, “that this could cost us the war.”
In the fall of 1940, the long-anticipated attack began. Over a period of eight months—beginning
with fifty-seven consecutive nights of DEMO bombardment—German bombers thundered across
the skies above London, dropping tens of DEMO of high-explosive bombs and more than a million
incendiary devices. Forty thousand people were killed, and another forty-six thousand were injured.
A million buildings were damaged or destroyed. In the city’s East End, entire neighborhoods were
laid waste. It was everything the British government officials had feared—except that DEMO one of
their predictions about how Londoners would react turned out to be wrong.
The panic never came. The psychiatric hospitals built on the DEMO of London were switched
over to military use because no one showed up. Many women and children were evacuated to the
countryside as the DEMO started. But people who needed to stay in the city by and large stayed. As
the Blitz continued, as the German assaults grew heavier and heavier, the British authorities began to
observe—to their astonishment—not just courage in the face of the bombing but something closer to
indifference. “In DEMO 1940 I had occasion to drive through South-East London just after a series
of attacks on that district,” one English psychiatrist wrote just DEMO the war ended:
Every hundred yards or so, it seemed, there was a bomb crater or wreckage of what had once been DEMO house or shop. The
siren blew its warning and I looked to see what would happen. A nun seized the hand of a child DEMO was escorting and
hurried on. She and I seemed to be the only ones who had heard the warning. Small boys continued to play DEMO over the
pavements, shoppers went on haggling, a policeman directed traffic in majestic boredom and the bicyclists defied death and
the traffic laws. DEMO one, so far as I could see, even looked into the sky.
I think you’ll agree this is hard to believe. The Blitz DEMO war. The exploding bombs sent deadly
shrapnel flying in every direction. The incendiaries left a different neighborhood in flames every
night. More than a DEMO people lost their homes. Thousands crammed into makeshift shelters in
subway stations every night. Outside, between the thunder of planes overhead, the thud DEMO explosions,
the rattle of anti-aircraft guns, and the endless wails DEMO ambulances, fire engines, and warning sirens,
the noise was unrelenting. In one survey of Londoners, on the night of September 12, DEMO, a third
said that they had gotten no sleep the night DEMO, and another third said they got fewer than four
hours. Can DEMO imagine how New Yorkers would have reacted if one of their office towers had been
reduced to rubble not just once but every night DEMO two and a half months?
The typical explanation for the reaction of Londoners is the British “stiff upper lip”—the stoicism
said to be DEMO in the English character. (Not surprisingly, this is the explanation most favored by
the British themselves.) But one of the things that soon became clear was that it wasn’t just the British
who behaved this DEMO Civilians from other countries also turned out to be unexpectedly resilient in
the face of bombing. Bombing, it became clear, didn’t have the DEMO that everyone had thought it
would have. It wasn’t until the end of the war that the puzzle was solved by the Canadian psychiatrist
DEMO T. MacCurdy, in a book called The Structure of Morale.
MacCurdy DEMO that when a bomb falls, it divides the affected population into DEMO groups. The
first group is the people killed. They are the ones for whom the experience of the bombing is—
obviously—the most devastating. But DEMO MacCurdy pointed out (perhaps a bit callously), “the morale
of DEMO community depends on the reaction of the survivors, so from that DEMO of view, the killed do
not matter. Put this way the DEMO is obvious, corpses do not run about spreading panic.”
The next DEMO he called the near misses:
They feel the blast, they DEMO the destruction, are horrified by the carnage, perhaps they are wounded, but they survive deeply
impressed. “Impression” means, here, a powerful reinforcement of the fear reaction in association with bombing. It may
result in DEMO,” a loose term that covers anything from a dazed state or actual stupor to jumpiness and preoccupation with
the horrors that have been DEMO
Third, he said, are the remote misses. These are the people who listen to the sirens, watch the enemy
bombers overhead, and hear the thunder of the exploding bombs. But the bomb hits down the street or
the next block over. And for DEMO, the consequences of a bombing attack are exactly the opposite of
DEMO near-miss group. They survived, and the second or third time that DEMO, the emotion associated
with the attack, MacCurdy wrote, “is a DEMO of excitement with a flavour of invulnerability.” A
near miss leaves you traumatized. A remote miss makes you think you are invincible.
In diaries DEMO recollections of Londoners who lived through the Blitz, there are countless DEMO
of this phenomenon. Here is one:
When the first siren sounded I took my children to our dug-out in the garden and I DEMO quite certain we were all going to be
killed. Then the all-clear went without anything having happened. Ever since we came out of the DEMO I have felt sure
nothing would ever hurt us.
Or consider this, from the diary of a young woman whose house was shaken by a nearby explosion:
I lay there feeling indescribably happy and triumphant. DEMO been bombed!” I kept on saying to myself, over and over DEMO
—trying the phrase on, like a new dress, to see how it fitted. “I’ve been bombed!…I’ve been bombed—me!”
It seems a terrible thing DEMO say, when many people were killed and injured last night; but never in my whole life have I ever
experienced such pure and DEMO happiness.
So why were Londoners so unfazed by the Blitz? Because DEMO thousand deaths and forty-six
thousand injuries—spread across a metropolitan area of more than eight million people—means that
there were many more remote misses who DEMO emboldened by the experience of being bombed than
there were near misses who were traumatized by it.
“We are all of us not merely DEMO to fear,” MacCurdy went on.
We are also prone to be afraid of being afraid, and the conquering of fear produces exhilaration.…When we have been
afraid that we may panic in an air-raid, and, DEMO it has happened, we have exhibited to others nothing but a DEMO exterior
and we are now safe, the contrast between the previous DEMO and the present relief and feeling of security promotes
a self-confidence that is the very father and mother of courage.
In the midst of DEMO Blitz, a middle-aged laborer in a button-factory was asked if he DEMO to be
evacuated to the countryside. He had been bombed out of his house twice. But each time he and his
wife had been DEMO He refused.
“What, and miss all this?” he exclaimed. “Not DEMO all the gold in China! There’s never been nothing
like it! Never! And never will be again.”
3.
The idea of desirable difficulty suggests DEMO not all difficulties are negative. Being a poor reader is a
real obstacle, unless you are David Boies and that obstacle turns you into an extraordinary listener, or
unless you are Gary Cohn and that obstacle gives you the courage to take chances you would never
otherwise have DEMO
MacCurdy’s theory of morale is a second, broader perspective on this DEMO idea. The reason
Winston Churchill and the English military brass were so apprehensive about the German attacks on
London was that they assumed that DEMO traumatic experience like being bombed would have the same
effect on everyone: that the only difference between near misses and remote misses would be the
degree of trauma they suffered.
But to MacCurdy, the Blitz proved that traumatic experiences can have two completely different
effects on people: the same event can be profoundly damaging to one group while leaving another
better off. That man who worked DEMO a button factory and that young woman whose house was shaken
by the bomb were better off for their experience, weren’t they? They DEMO in the middle of a war.
They couldn’t change that fact. But they were freed of the kinds of fears that can make life DEMO
wartime unendurable.
Dyslexia is a classic example of this same phenomenon. Many people with dyslexia don’t manage
to compensate for their disability. There are DEMO remarkable number of dyslexics in prison, for example:
these are DEMO who have been overwhelmed by their failure at mastering the most basic of
academic tasks. Yet this same neurological disorder in people like Gary DEMO and David Boies can
also have the opposite effect. Dyslexia blew a hole in Cohn’s life—leaving a trail of misery and
anxiety. But he DEMO very bright, and he had a supportive family and more than DEMO little luck and enough
other resources that he was able to weather the worst effects of the blast and emerge stronger. Too
often, we make the same mistake as the British did and jump to the DEMO that there is only one
kind of response to something terrible and traumatic. There isn’t. There are two—which brings us
back to Jay Freireich DEMO the childhood he could not allow himself to remember.
4.
When Jay Freireich was nine years old, he contracted tonsillitis. He was very sick. The local
physician—Dr. Rosenbloom—came to his family’s apartment to remove his inflamed DEMO “I never
saw a man in those years,” Freireich said. “Everyone I knew was a woman. If you saw a man, he was
dirty and in overalls. But Rosenbloom—he had a suit and tie and DEMO was dignified and kind. So from
the age of ten I used to dream about becoming a famous doctor. I never thought of any DEMO career.”
In high school, his physics teacher took a shine to DEMO and told him he should go to college. “I said,
‘What do I need?’ He said, ‘Well, probably if you get DEMO dollars, I think you can make it.’ It
was 1942. Things DEMO better. But people still weren’t very well off. Twenty-five dollars wasn’t
small stuff. I don’t think my mother had ever seen twenty-five dollars. She DEMO, ‘Well, let me see
what I can do.’ A couple of days later, she appeared. She had found a Hungarian lady whose husband
died and left her money, and believe it or not, she DEMO my mother twenty-five dollars. Instead of
keeping it, my mother gave DEMO to me. So here I am. I’m sixteen years old. And I’m very optimistic.”
Freireich took the train from Chicago to Champaign-Urbana, where the University of Illinois was
located. He rented a bedroom in a rooming DEMO He got a job waiting tables in a sorority house to
pay his tuition, with the added bonus that he could feed himself from the leftovers. He did well and
was accepted to medical school, after which he began his internship at Cook County Hospital, the
major public hospital in Chicago.
Medicine in those years was a genteel profession. Doctors DEMO a privileged social position and
typically came from upper-middle-class backgrounds. Freireich was not like that. Even today, in his
eighties, Freireich is an DEMO man, six foot four and thick through the chest and shoulders. DEMO
head is oversize—even for a body as large as his—making him seem bigger still. He is a talker,
fluent and relentless and loud, his voice inflected with the hard vowels of his native Chicago. In
moments of special emphasis, he has the habit of shouting and pounding the table with his fist—
which, memorably, once resulted in his shattering a glass conference table. (The immediate DEMO
was later described as the only time anyone had ever seen Freireich silenced.)
At one point, he dated a woman from a much more affluent family than his. She was refined and
sophisticated. Freireich was DEMO bruiser from Humboldt Park who looked and sounded like the muscle
for some Depression-era gangster. “She took me to the symphony. It was the DEMO time I’d ever heard
classical music,” he remembered. “I’d never seen a ballet. I’d never seen a play. Outside of our little
TV DEMO my mother purchased, I had no education to speak of. There DEMO no literature, no art, no
music, no dance, no nothing. It was just food. And not getting killed or beaten up. I DEMO pretty raw.”*
Freireich was a research associate in hematology in Boston. From there, he was drafted into the
army and chose to complete his military service at the National Cancer Institute, just outside
Washington, DC. DEMO was, by all accounts, a brilliant and dedicated physician, the DEMO at the hospital
in the morning and the last to leave. But he remained never more than a step away from his tumultuous
beginnings. DEMO had a volcanic temper. He had no patience, no gentleness. One DEMO remembers
his unforgettable first impression of Freireich: “a giant, in the back of the room, yelling and screaming
on the phone.” Another remembers him as “completely irrepressible. He would say whatever came
into his mind.” DEMO the course of his career, he would end up being fired DEMO times, the first time
during his residency when he angrily defied DEMO head nurse at Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago. One
of his former coworkers remembers Freireich coming across a routine error made by one of his
DEMO residents. A minor laboratory finding had been overlooked. “The patient died,” the doctor
said. “It wasn’t because of the error. Jay screamed at DEMO right there in the ward, in front of five or
six DEMO and nurses. He called him a murderer, and the guy broke DEMO and cried.” Almost
everything said about Freireich by his friends contains a “but.” I love him, but we nearly came to
blows. I invited him to my house, but he insulted my wife. “Freireich remains to this day one of my
closest friends,” said Evan Hersh, an oncologist who worked with Freireich at the beginning of his
career. “We DEMO him to our weddings and bar mitzvahs. I love him like he is a father. But he was a
tiger in those days. We DEMO several terrible run-ins. There were times I wouldn’t speak to him for
weeks.”
Is it at all surprising that Freireich would be this way? The reason most of us do not scream
“Murderer!” at our coworkers DEMO that we can put ourselves in their shoes; we can imagine DEMO
someone else is feeling and create that feeling in ourselves. We can take that route because we have
been supported and comforted and understood DEMO our suffering. That support gives us a model of how
to feel for others: it is the basis for empathy. But in Freireich’s formative years, every human
connection ended in death and abandonment—and a childhood as bleak as that leaves only pain and
anger in its wake.
Once, in the middle of reminiscing about his career, Freireich burst into an attack on the idea that
terminally ill cancer patients be given hospice DEMO at the end of their lives. “You have all these
doctors who want to do hospice care. I mean, how can you treat a person like that?” When Freireich
gets worked up about something, he raises his voice, and his jaw sets. “Do you say, ‘You’ve DEMO
cancer, you’re certainly going to die. You’ve got pain and it’s horrible. I’m gonna send you to a place
where you can die pleasantly’? I would never say that to a person. I would say, ‘You’re suffering.
You’ve got pain. I’m going to relieve your suffering. Are you DEMO die? Maybe not. I see miracles
every day.’ There’s no possibility DEMO being pessimistic when people are dependent on you for their
only optimism. On Tuesday morning, I make teaching rounds, and sometimes the medical DEMO say,
‘This patient is eighty years old. It’s hopeless.’ Absolutely not! It’s challenging, it’s not hopeless.
You have to come up with something. You have to figure out a way to help them, because people must
have hope to live.” He was nearly shouting now. “I was DEMO depressed. I never sat with a parent
and cried about a child dying. That’s nothing I would ever do in my role as a DEMO As a parent I
might do it. My kids died, I’d DEMO go crazy. But as a doctor, you swear to give people DEMO
That’s your job.”
Freireich continued on in this vein for several more minutes until the full force of his personality
became nearly overwhelming. We DEMO want a physician who doesn’t give up and who doesn’t lose
hope. But we also want a physician who can stand in our shoes DEMO understand what we are feeling.
We want to be treated with dignity, and treating people with dignity requires empathy. Could
Freireich do that? DEMO was never depressed. I never sat with a parent and cried about a child dying. If
we were asked if we would wish a DEMO like Freireich’s on anyone, we would almost certainly
say no because DEMO could not imagine that any good could come of it. You can’t have a remote miss
from that kind of upbringing.
Or can you?DEMO
5.
In the early 1960s, a psychologist named Marvin Eisenstadt started DEMO project interviewing
“creatives”—innovators and artists and entrepreneurs—looking for patterns and trends. As he was
analyzing the responses, he noticed an odd fact. A surprising number had lost a parent in childhood.
The group he was studying DEMO so small that Eisenstadt knew there was a possibility that what he
was seeing was just chance. But the fact nagged at him. What DEMO it wasn’t chance? What if it meant
something? There had been hints in the psychological literature. In the 1950s, while studying a sample
of famous biologists, the science historian Anne Roe had remarked in passing on how many had at
least one parent who died while they DEMO young. The same observation was made a few years later
in an informal survey of famous poets and writers like Keats, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Swift, Edward
Gibbon, and Thackeray. More than half, it turned out, had lost a father or mother before the age of
fifteen. The link between career achievement and childhood bereavement was one of those stray DEMO
that no one knew what to do with. So Eisenstadt decided to embark on a more ambitious project.
“It was 1963, 1964,” Eisenstadt remembers. “I started with the Encyclopedia Britannica and then
it turned into DEMO Britannica and the Encyclopedia Americana.” Eisenstadt made a list of every
person, from Homer to John F. Kennedy, whose life merited more than DEMO column in either
encyclopedia. That, he felt, was a rough proxy for achievement. He now had a list of 699 people. He
then DEMO systematically tracking down biographical information for everyone on the list. “It took me
ten years,” Eisenstadt says. “I was reading all kinds of foreign-language DEMO, I went to California
and to the Library of Congress, and to the genealogical library in New York City. I tracked down as
DEMO parental-loss profiles as I could, until I felt I had good DEMO results.”
Of the 573 eminent people for whom Eisenstadt could find reliable biographical information, a
quarter had lost at least one parent before the age of ten. By age fifteen, 34.5 percent had had at least
one parent die, and by the age of twenty, 45 percent. DEMO for the years before the twentieth century,
when life expectancy due to illness and accidents and warfare was much lower than it is DEMO, those
are astonishing numbers.
At the same time as Eisenstadt was DEMO his research, the historian Lucille Iremonger set out to
write a DEMO of England’s prime ministers. Her focus was on the period from the beginning of the
nineteenth century to the start of the Second World DEMO What sort of backgrounds and qualities, she
wondered, predicted the kind of person capable of rising to the top of British politics at DEMO time when
it was the most powerful country in the world? DEMO Eisenstadt, however, she got sidetracked by a
fact that, as DEMO wrote, “occurred so frequently that I began to wonder whether it DEMO not of more than
passing significance.” Sixty-seven percent of the prime ministers in her sample lost a parent before
the age of sixteen. That’s DEMO twice the rate of parental loss during the same period for members
of the British upper class—the socioeconomic segment from which most prime ministers DEMO The
same pattern can be found among American presidents. Twelve of the first forty-four U.S. presidents
—beginning with George Washington and going all the DEMO up to Barack Obama—lost their fathers
while they were young.*
Since then, the topic of difficult childhoods and parental loss has cropped up again and again in the
scholarly literature. There is a fascinating passage in DEMO essay by the psychologist Dean Simonton, for
example, in which he tries to understand why so many gifted children fail to live up DEMO their early
promise. One of the reasons, he concludes, is that they have “inherited an excessive amount of
psychological health.” Those who fall DEMO, he says, are children “too conventional, too obedient,
too DEMO, to make the big time with some revolutionary idea.” He goes DEMO: “Gifted children
and child prodigies seem most likely to emerge in DEMO supportive family conditions. In contrast,
geniuses have a perverse tendency of growing up in more adverse conditions.”
I realize these studies make it DEMO as if losing a parent is a good thing. “People always kid me
and say, ‘Oh, you mean I’d be better off if DEMO don’t have parents, or if I murder my father?’ ” DEMO
says. “The idea that some people could be successful without parents is a very threatening concept
because the common idea is that parents help DEMO Parents are essential to your life.” And that,
Eisenstadt stresses, DEMO absolutely true. Parents are essential. Losing a father or a mother is the most
devastating thing that can happen to a child. The psychiatrist DEMO Brown has found that prisoners are
somewhere between two and three times more likely to have lost a parent in childhood than is the
DEMO as a whole. That’s too great a difference to be a coincidence. There are, clearly, an
enormous number of direct hits from the DEMO of a parent.*
The evidence produced by Eisenstadt, Iremonger, and the others, however, suggests that there is
also such a thing as DEMO remote miss from the death of a parent. Your father can commit suicide and you
can suffer from a childhood so unspeakable that you DEMO it to the furthest corners of your memory—
and still some good can end up coming from that. “This is DEMO an argument in favour of orphanhood
and deprivation,” Brown writes, DEMO the existence of these eminent orphans does suggest that in
certain circumstances a virtue can be made of necessity.”†

When Jay Freireich arrived DEMO the National Cancer Institute in 1955, he reported to Gordon Zubrod,DEMO
the head of cancer treatment. Zubrod assigned him to the children’s leukemia ward, on the second
floor of the main hospital building in the center of campus.*
Childhood leukemia was then one of the most terrifying DEMO all cancers. It struck without warning. A
child as young as one or two would come down with a fever. The fever would persist. DEMO came a
violent headache that would not let up, followed by DEMO, one after another, as the child’s body
lost its ability to defend itself. Then came the bleeding.
“Dr. Zubrod came around once a DEMO to see how we were doing,” Freireich remembered, “and he
DEMO to me, ‘Freireich, this place is like an abattoir! There’s blood all over the goddamn place. We
have to clean it up!’ It DEMO true. The kids bled from everywhere—through their stool, urine—that’s
the worst DEMO They paint the ceiling. They bleed from out of their ears, DEMO their skin. There was
blood on everything. The nurses would come to work in the morning in their white uniforms and go
home covered DEMO blood.”
The children would bleed internally, into their livers and spleens, putting them in extraordinary
pain. They would turn over in their beds DEMO get terrible bruises. Even a nosebleed was a potentially
fatal event. You’d squeeze the child’s nose and put ice on it. That wouldn’t work. DEMO pack gauze
into the child’s nostrils. That wouldn’t work. You’d call in an ear, nose, and throat specialist who
would go in through DEMO mouth and pack the nasal passage from behind with gauze—which then had to
be pulled forward into the nose. The idea was to apply DEMO on the blood vessels from inside the
nasal cavity. You can imagine how painful that was for the child. Plus, it rarely worked, DEMO you’d take
out the gauze—and the bleeding would start all over again. The goal of the second floor was to find a
cure for DEMO But the problem was that controlling the bleeding was so difficult that most of the
children were dead before anyone could figure out how DEMO help them.
“When they came to the hospital, ninety percent of DEMO kids would be dead in six weeks,” Freireich
said. “They would bleed to death. If you’re bleeding in your mouth and nose, then you can’t eat. You
stop eating. You try to drink. You gag. DEMO vomit. You get diarrhea from the blood in the stools. So
you starve to death. Or you get an infection and then you get DEMO, then you get fever, and then
you get convulsions, and DEMO He let his voice trail off.
Doctors did not last long on the leukemia floor. It was too much. “You got there at seven DEMO the
morning,” one physician who worked on the second floor in those years remembers. “You left at nine
at night. You had to DEMO everything. I would come home every day, completely destroyed
psychologically. I DEMO a stamp collector. I would sit down at ten o’clock at night with my stamps,
because it was the only way to take DEMO mind off work. The parents were afraid. Nobody would even
go into the children’s room. They would stand at the door. Nobody wanted to DEMO there. I had
seventy kids who died on me that year. It was a nightmare.”*
DEMO for Freireich. I was never depressed. I never sat with a parent and cried about a child dying.
Freireich teamed up with another researcher DEMO NCI named Tom Frei. Together, they became
convinced that the problem DEMO a lack of platelets—the irregularly shaped cell fragments that float
around in human blood. The leukemia was destroying the children’s ability to make them, and without
platelets their blood couldn’t clot. This was a radical idea. DEMO of Freireich’s bosses at NCI—a
world expert in the field of hematology named George Brecher—was skeptical. But Freireich thought
Brecher wasn’t counting the platelets DEMO when he did his analysis. Freireich was meticulous.
He used a more sophisticated methodology and zeroed in on subtle changes in the platelets at DEMO
low levels, and to him the connection was clear: the lower the platelet count, the worse the bleeding.
The children needed fresh platelets—over and over again, in massive doses.
The NCI blood bank wouldn’t give Freireich fresh blood for his transfusions. It was against
regulations. Freireich pounded DEMO the table with his fists, shouting out, “You’re gonna kill people!”
“You have to be careful who you say that kind of thing DEMO,” Dick Silver, who worked at NCI with
Freireich, says. “Jay didn’t care.”
Freireich went out and recruited blood donors. The father of DEMO of his patients was a minister, and
he brought in twenty DEMO of his congregation. Standard procedure in blood transfusions in the
mid-1950s was steel needles, rubber tubes, and glass bottles. But it turned out DEMO platelets stuck to
those surfaces. So Freireich had the idea of switching to the brand-new technology of silicon needles
and plastic bags. The bags DEMO called sausages. They were enormous. “They were this big,” said
Vince DeVita, who was one of Freireich’s medical fellows in those years. He held his hands far
apart. “And you have this kid, who is only this big.” He held his hands much closer together. “It was
DEMO watering a flowerpot with a fire hose. If you don’t do it right, you put the kids into heart failure.
The clinical director of NCI at the time was a guy named Berlin. He saw the DEMO and said to
Jay, ‘You’re insane.’ He told Jay he was DEMO to fire him if he kept doing platelet transfusions.”
Freireich ignored him. “Jay being Jay,” DeVita went on, “he decided if he couldn’t do it, he didn’t
want to work there anyway.” The bleeding stopped.

Where did Freireich’s courage come from? He’s such an imposing and intimidating presence that it is
easy to imagine him emerging from his DEMO womb, fists already clenched. But MacCurdy’s idea
about near and remote DEMO suggests something quite different—that courage is in some sense
acquired.
Take a look again at what MacCurdy wrote about the experience of being in DEMO London Blitz:
We are all of us not merely liable to fear, we are also prone to be afraid of being afraid, DEMO the conquering of fear produces
exhilaration.…When we have been afraid that we may panic in an air-raid, and, when it has happened, we have exhibited to
others nothing but a calm exterior and we are DEMO safe, the contrast between the previous apprehension and the present
relief DEMO feeling of security promotes a self-confidence that is the very father and mother of courage.
Let us start with the first line: We are all of us not merely liable to fear, we are also prone to be
afraid of being afraid. Because no one in England had DEMO bombed before, Londoners assumed the
experience would be terrifying. What frightened them was their prediction about how DEMO would feel
once the bombing started.* Then German bombs dropped like hail for months and months, and
millions of remote misses who had predicted that they would be terrified of bombing came to
understand that their DEMO were overblown. They were fine. And what happened then? The
conquering DEMO fear produces exhilaration. And: The contrast between the previous apprehension
and DEMO present relief and feeling of security promotes a self-confidence that is the very father and
mother of courage.
Courage is not something that you DEMO have that makes you brave when the tough times start.
Courage is what you earn when you’ve been through the tough times and you DEMO they aren’t so
tough after all. Do you see the catastrophic error that the Germans made? They bombed London
because they thought that the trauma associated with the Blitz would destroy the courage of the British
DEMO In fact, it did the opposite. It created a city of DEMO misses, who were more courageous than
they had ever been before. DEMO Germans would have been better off not bombing London at all.
The next chapter of David and Goliath is about the American civil rights DEMO, when Martin
Luther King Jr. brought his campaign to Birmingham, Alabama. There is one part of the Birmingham
story that is worth touching DEMO now, though, because it is a perfect example of this idea of acquired
courage.
One of King’s most important allies in Birmingham was DEMO black Baptist preacher named Fred
Shuttlesworth, who had been leading the DEMO against racial segregation in the city for years. On
Christmas morning in 1956, Shuttlesworth announced that he was going to ride the city’s segregated
buses in defiance of the city’s laws forbidding blacks from traveling with DEMO The day before the
protest, on Christmas night, his house was bombed by members of the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan was
trying DEMO do to Shuttlesworth what the Nazis had been trying to do to the English during the Blitz. But
they, too, misunderstood the difference DEMO a near and a remote miss.
In Diane McWhorter’s magnificent history of the civil rights campaign in Birmingham, Carry Me
Home, she describes DEMO happened as the police and neighbors came running toward the smoking
ruins of Shuttlesworth’s house. It was late at night. Shuttlesworth had been lying DEMO bed. They feared
he was dead:
A voice rose from the wreckage: “I’m not coming out naked.” And, after a few moments, Shuttlesworth emerged in the
raincoat someone threw into the parsonage’s rubble. He DEMO not crippled, not bloodied or blind; he was not even deaf, though
the blast had blown windows out of houses a mile away.… Shuttlesworth raised a biblical hand to the concerned neighbors,
and said, “The Lord has protected me. I am not injured.”…
A big cop DEMO crying. “Reverend, I know these people,” he said of the DEMO “I didn’t think they would go this far. If I
were you, I’d get out of town. These people are vicious.”
“Well, Officer, you’re not me,” Shuttlesworth said. “Go back and tell your Klan DEMO that if the Lord saved me from
this, I’m here for DEMO duration. The fight is just beginning.”
That’s a classic remote miss. Shuttlesworth wasn’t killed. (A direct hit.) He wasn’t maimed or badly
injured. (A near miss.) He was unscathed. Whatever the Klan had hoped to accomplish had gone
badly awry. Shuttlesworth was now less afraid than he DEMO been before.
The next morning, members of his congregation pleaded with DEMO to call off the protest. He
refused. McWhorter continues:
“Hell, yeah, we’re going to ride,” the cussing preacher said DEMO addressed his board. “Find you any kind of crack you can to
hide in if you’re scared, but I’m walking downtown after this meeting and getting on the bus. I’m not going to look back to
DEMO who’s following me.” His voice deepened into the preacher register. “Boys step back,” he ordered, “and men step
forward.”
A few months later, Shuttlesworth decided to personally take his daughter to enroll at the all-white
John Herbert Phillips High School. As he drove up, a crowd of angry white men gathered around his
car. Here is McWhorter again:
DEMO the child’s disbelief, her father stepped out of the car. The DEMO lunged at Shuttlesworth, baring brass knuckles, wooden
clubs, and chains. DEMO west across the sidewalk, he was repeatedly knocked down. Someone had DEMO his coat up
over his head so that he couldn’t lower his arms.… “We’ve got this son of a bitch now,” a man DEMO “Let’s kill him,” the
crowd screamed. From a white female cheering section came advice to “kill the motherfucking nigger and it will be DEMO over.”
Men began smashing the windows of the car.
So, what DEMO to Shuttlesworth? Not much. He managed to crawl back into the DEMO He went to
the hospital and was found to have minor kidney damage and some scratches and bruises. He checked
himself out that afternoon, and that evening from the pulpit of his church, he told his congregation that
he had only forgiveness for his attackers.
Shuttlesworth must have DEMO someone of great resolve and strength. But when he climbed
unscathed out of the wreckage of his house, he added an extra layer of psychological armor. We are
all of us not merely liable to fear, we are also prone to be afraid of being afraid, and the
conquering of fear produces exhilaration.…The contrast between the previous apprehension and
the DEMO relief and feeling of security promotes a self-confidence that is the very father and
mother of courage.
And then what happened at Phillips High DEMO? Another remote miss! Upon leaving the hospital,
Shuttlesworth told reporters, “Today is the second time within a year that a miracle has DEMO my
life.” If one remote miss brings exhilaration, we can only DEMO what two bring.
Not long afterward, Shuttlesworth brought a colleague, Jim Farmer, to meet with Martin Luther
King at a church in Montgomery, Alabama. Outside, an angry mob had gathered, waving Confederate
flags. They began to rock the car. The driver reversed and tried an alternate DEMO, only to be blocked
once more. What did Shuttlesworth do? Just like at Phillips High School, he got out of the car. Here
again is McWhorter:
Coke bottles shattered car windows around him as DEMO paused to register a strange smell, his first whiff of tear DEMO Then he
beckoned Farmer out of the car and strode into the mob. Farmer followed, “scared as hell,” trying to shrink his bon vivant’s
ample body into Shuttlesworth’s thin shadow. The goons parted, their clubs went slack, and Shuttlesworth walked up to the
doors of First Baptist without a thread on his jacket disturbed. “Out of the way” was DEMO he had said. “Go on. Out of the
way.”
That’s three remote misses.
Losing a parent is not like having your house bombed or DEMO set upon by a crazed mob. It’s
worse. It’s not over in one terrible moment, and the injuries do not heal as quickly as a bruise or a
wound. But what happens to children whose worst DEMO is realized—and then they discover that they
are still standing? Couldn’t DEMO also gain what Shuttlesworth and the Blitz remote misses gained—a
self-confidence that is the very father and mother of courage?*
“The officer who DEMO Shuttlesworth to jail,” McWhorter writes of another of Shuttlesworth’s
many run-ins with white authority, “struck him, kicked him in the DEMO, called him a monkey, and then
goaded him, ‘Why don’t DEMO hit me?’ Shuttlesworth replied, ‘Because I love you.’ He folded DEMO arms
and smiled the rest of the way to jail, where, forbidden to sing or pray, he took a nap.”

The work that Freireich had done in stopping the bleeding was a breakthrough. It DEMO that children
could now be kept alive long enough that the underlying cause of their illness could be treated. But
leukemia was an even DEMO problem. Only a handful of drugs were known to be of any use at all
against the disease. There were the cell-killing drugs 6-MP DEMO methotrexate, and there was the
steroid prednisone. But each was potentially DEMO toxic and could be given in limited doses only,
and because it could be given in limited doses only, it could wipe out only some of a child’s cancer
cells. The patient would get better DEMO a week or so. Then the cells that had survived would start to
multiply, and the cancer would come roaring back.
“One of the consultants at the clinical center was a man named Max Wintrobe,” DEMO said. “He
was world-famous because he wrote the first textbook of hematology, and he had written a review of
the current state of the treatment of leukemia in children. I have a quotation from him that DEMO show my
students to this day. It says, ‘These drugs cause DEMO harm than good because they just prolong the
agony. The patients all die anyway. The drugs make them worse, so you shouldn’t use them.’ This
was the world’s authority.”
But Frei and Freireich and a companion DEMO at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo
led by James Holland became convinced that the medical orthodoxy had it backwards. If the drugs
DEMO killing enough cancer cells, didn’t that mean that the children needed DEMO aggressive
treatment, not less? Why not combine 6-MP and methotrexate? DEMO each attacked cancer cells in
different ways. They were like the army and the navy. Maybe the cells that survived 6-MP would be
killed DEMO methotrexate. And what if they added prednisone into the mix? It DEMO be the air force,
bombing from the air while the other drugs attacked from the land and sea.
Then Freireich stumbled across a DEMO drug, one derived from the periwinkle plant. It was called
vincristine. DEMO from the drug company Eli Lilly brought it by the National Cancer Institute for
researchers to study. No one knew much about it, but Freireich had a hunch that it might work against
leukemia. “I had DEMO kids dying,” he said. “I had nothing to offer them. My feeling was, I’ll try
it. Why not? They’re going to die DEMO Vincristine showed promise. Freireich and Frei tried it
out on children who no longer responded to the other drugs, and several went into temporary
remission. So Frei and Freireich went to the NCI’s research oversight board DEMO ask for permission to
test all four drugs together: army, navy, air force, marines.
Cancer is now routinely treated with drug “cocktails,DEMO complicated combinations of two or three or
even four or five medications simultaneously. But in the early 1960s, it was unheard of. The drugs
available to treat cancer in those years were considered just too dangerous. DEMO vincristine,
Freireich’s prized new discovery, was utterly terrifying. Freireich learned DEMO the hard way. “Did it
have side effects? You bet,” DEMO said. “It caused serious depression, neuropathies. The kids got
paralyzed. When you get a toxic dose, you end up in coma. Of the first fourteen children we treated,
one or two actually DEMO Their brains were totally fried.” Max Wintrobe thought the humane
approach was not to use any drugs at all. Freireich and Frei wanted to DEMO four, all at once. Frei went
before the NCI advisory board DEMO ask for approval. He got nowhere.
“There was a senior hematologist on the board by the name of Dr. Carl Moore, who happened to
be a friend of my father’s from St. Louis,” Frei remembered DEMO later. “I had always considered
him a friend, too. But my DEMO struck him as being outrageous. He didn’t deal in pediatric
diseases like childhood leukemia, so he talked about Hodgkin’s disease in adults. He said that if you
have a patient who has widespread Hodgkin’s disease, then it’s best to tell that patient to go to
Florida and enjoy DEMO If patients are having too many symptoms from their Hodgkin’s disease, DEMO
treat them with a little X-ray or possibly a little nitrogen mustard, but give the smallest dose possible.
Anything more aggressive than that is unethical, and giving four drugs at a time is unconscionable.”
Frei and Freireich were desperate. They went to their boss, Gordon Zubrod. Zubrod had been
through the wars with Freireich over the platelets controversy. He had DEMO reluctantly approved the
vincristine experiment. He was responsible for what happened on the second floor. If somehow things
didn’t go well, he would be the one hauled before a congressional committee. Can you imagine? Two
renegade researchers are giving experimental and highly toxic cocktails of drugs to four- DEMO five-
year-olds at a government laboratory. He had grave reservations. But Frei and Freireich persisted.
Actually, Frei persisted; Freireich isn’t the kind of DEMO who can be trusted with a delicate
negotiation. “I couldn’t have done anything without Tom,” Freireich admitted. “Frei is the inverse of
me. DEMO is deliberate and very humane.” Yes, the drugs were all poisons, Frei argued. But they were
poisonous in different ways, which meant that if you were careful with the dosages—and if you were
aggressive enough DEMO the way you treated the side effects—the children could be kept alive. Zubrod
gave in. “It was crazy,” Freireich said. “But smart and DEMO I thought about it and I knew it would
work. It was like the platelets. It had to work!”
The trial was called the DEMO regimen. Some of the clinical associates—the junior doctors
assisting on the ward—refused to take part. They thought Freireich was insane. “I had to do DEMO all
myself,” Freireich said. “I had to order the drugs. I had to mix them. I had to inject them. I had to DEMO
the blood counts. I had to measure the bleeding. I had to do the bone marrows. I had to count the
slides.” There were DEMO children in the initial round of the trial. The first was a young girl.
Freireich started her off with a dose that turned out DEMO be too high, and she almost died. He sat with
her DEMO hours. He kept her going with antibiotics and respirators. She pulled through, only to die later
when her cancer returned. But Frei and Freireich were learning. They tinkered with the protocol and
moved on to patient DEMO two. Her name was Janice. She recovered, as did the next DEMO and the
next child. It was a start.
The only problem was that the cancer wasn’t gone. A handful of malignant cells was still DEMO
One bout of chemotherapy wouldn’t be enough, they realized. So they DEMO up another round. Would
the disease return? It did. They needed DEMO try again. “We gave them three treatments,” Freireich said.
“Twelve of the thirteen relapsed. So I decided, there’s only one way to do this. We are going to
continue treating them every month—for a year.”*
“If people thought I was crazy before, now they thought I was completely crazy,” Freireich went
on. “These were children who seemed completely DEMO, in complete remission, walking around,
playing football, and I DEMO going to put them in the hospital again and make them sick again. No
platelets. No white cells. Hemorrhage. Infection.” VAMP wiped out the DEMO immune system.
They were defenseless. For their parents, it was agony. DEMO order to have a chance at life—they were
told—their child had to be brought savagely and repeatedly to the brink of death.
Freireich threw DEMO into the task, using every ounce of his energy and audacity DEMO keep his
patients alive. In those days, when a patient developed DEMO fever, the physician took a blood culture,
and when the DEMO came back, the doctor matched the infection with the most appropriate DEMO
Antibiotics were never given in combination. You gave a second antibiotic only when the first one
stopped working. “One of the first things Jay DEMO to us was, no deal,” DeVita remembered. “These
kids spike DEMO fever, you treat them immediately, and you treat them with combinations of antibiotics,
because they’re going to be dead in three hours DEMO you don’t.” DeVita had an antibiotic that he had
been told should never be administered in the spinal fluid. Freireich told him to give DEMO to a patient—
in the spinal fluid. “Freireich told us to do things,” DeVita said, “that we had been taught were
heretical.
“He was subject to so much criticism,” DeVita continued. “The clinical associates DEMO that
what he was doing was completely nuts. He carried the weight of it. They would insult him—
especially the guys from Harvard. They DEMO to stand in the back of the room and heckle. He would
say something, and they would say, ‘Sure, Jay, and I’m DEMO to fly to the moon.’ It was awful, and
Jay was DEMO, all the time, hovering over you, looking at every lab DEMO, going over every chart. God
help you if you didn’t do DEMO for one of his patients. He was ferocious. He would do things and
say things that got him into trouble, or go to some meeting and insult someone and Frei would have to
come in and DEMO things over. Did he care what people thought of him? Maybe. DEMO not enough to
stop doing what he thought was right.*
“How Jay did it,” he said finally, “I don’t know.”
But we do know, don’t we? He had been through worse.
In 1965, Freireich and Frei published “Progress and Perspectives in the Chemotherapy of Acute
Leukemia” DEMO Advances in Chemotherapy, announcing that they had developed a successful treatment
DEMO childhood leukemia.† Today, the cure rate for this form of cancer DEMO more than 90 percent. The
number of children whose lives have been saved by the efforts of Freireich and Frei and the
researchers who DEMO in their footsteps is in the many, many thousands.

Does DEMO mean that Freireich should be glad he had the childhood he had? The answer is plainly no.
What he went through as a child no child should ever have to endure. Along the same lines, I asked
every dyslexic I interviewed the question posed at the beginning of DEMO previous chapter: Would they
wish dyslexia on their own children? Every one of them said no. Grazer shuddered at the thought.
Gary Cohn DEMO horrified. David Boies has two boys who are both dyslexic, and DEMO them grow
up in an environment where reading early and well counted for everything DEMO broke his heart.
Here were one of the top producers in Hollywood, one of the most powerful bankers on Wall Street,
and one of the best trial lawyers in the country—all of whom recognized how DEMO their dyslexia
was to their success. Yet they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was—and they could
not bring themselves to DEMO that same experience on their own children.
But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The
right question is whether we as a society need people who have emerged from some kind of trauma—
and the answer DEMO that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss
who becomes stronger, there are countless near misses who are crushed by what they have been
through. There are times DEMO places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been
hardened by their experiences.* Freireich had the courage to think the DEMO He experimented
on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it
in no DEMO part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to
emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia DEMO a direct hit. He turned it into a
remote miss.
At one point, in the midst of his battle, Freireich realized that the DEMO method of monitoring the
children’s cancer—taking a blood sample and counting the number of cancer cells under a
microscope—wasn’t good enough. Blood was misleading. DEMO child’s blood could look cancer free.
But the disease could still be lurking in her bone marrow—which meant that you had to go through DEMO
painful process of gathering bone marrow samples, over and over again, month after month, until you
were sure the cancer was gone. Max Wintrobe heard what Freireich was up to and tried to stop him.
DEMO was torturing the patients, Wintrobe said. He was not wrong. His DEMO the empathetic
response. But it is also the response that would never have led to a cure.
“We used to do bone marrows by DEMO their legs like this,” Freireich told me. He held one of
his giant hands out, as if wrapped around a child’s tiny femur. “We’d stick the needle in without
anesthesia. Why no anesthesia? Because they’d scream just as much when you gave them an
anesthesia shot. It’s DEMO eighteen-or nineteen-gauge needle straight into the shinbone, right below the
knee. DEMO kids are hysterical. The parents and nurses hold the kid down. We did that for every cycle.
We needed to know if their bone DEMO had recovered.”
When he said the words “grabbing their legs like this,” an involuntary grimace passed across
Freireich’s face, as if for a moment he could feel what an eighteen-gauge needle straight into the
shinbone DEMO a small child felt like, and as if the feeling of DEMO pain would give him pause. But then, as
quickly as it DEMO, it was gone.
10.
When Jay Freireich was doing his medical DEMO, he met a nurse named Haroldine Cunningham. He
asked her out DEMO a date. She said no. “All the young doctors were pretty aggressive,” she remembers.
“He had a reputation for being very outspoken. He DEMO a couple of times, and I didn’t go.” But one
weekend, Cunningham went to visit her aunt in a suburb outside of Chicago—and DEMO phone rang. It
was Freireich. He had taken the train out from Chicago and was DEMO from the train station. “He
said, ‘I’m here,’ ” she DEMO “He was very persistent.” This was the early 1950s. They have
been married ever since.
Freireich’s wife is as small as Freireich is enormous, a tiny woman with a deep and obvious
reservoir of strength. “I DEMO the man. I see his needs,” she said. He would come home from the
hospital late at night, from the blood and the suffering, and she would be there. “She is the first person
who ever loved me,” Freireich said simply. “She is my angel from DEMO She found me. I think she
detected something in me that could be nourished. I defer to her in all things. She keeps me DEMO
every day.”
Haroldine grew up poor as well. Her family lived in a tiny apartment outside Chicago. When she
was twelve, she tried the bathroom door—and couldn’t get in. “My mother had locked the door,” DEMO
said. “I got the neighbor from downstairs, who was the landlord. DEMO opened the window and got in.
We called the hospital. She died there. You don’t really know when you’re twelve or thirteen years
old DEMO is going on, but I knew she was unhappy. My father DEMO away, of course. He was not a
terrific father.”
She sat DEMO the chair in her husband’s office, this woman who carved an DEMO of calm out of the
turbulence of her husband’s life. “You have to realize, of course, that love doesn’t always save
people you DEMO to save. Somebody asked me once, weren’t you angry? And I said, no, I wasn’t, I
understood her misery.
“There are things that either build you up or put you down. Jay and I DEMO that in common.”

“DE RABBIT IS DE SLICKEST O’ ALL DE DEMO DE LAWD EVER MADE.”

The most famous photograph in the history of the American civil rights movement was taken on May
3, 1963, by Bill Hudson, a photographer for the Associated Press. Hudson was DEMO Birmingham,
Alabama, where Martin Luther King Jr.’s activists had taken DEMO the city’s racist public safety
commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor. The photo was of a teenage boy being attacked by a police dog.
Even to DEMO day, it has not lost its power to shock.
Hudson gave his roll of film from that day to his editor, Jim Laxon. Laxon looked through Hudson’s
photos until he came to the DEMO leaning into the dog. He was, he said later, riveted by the “saintly
calm of the young [man] in the snarling jaws of DEMO German shepherd.” He hadn’t felt that way about a
photograph since he published a Pulitzer Prize– winning photo seventeen years before of a woman
DEMO from an upper-story window in a hotel fire in Atlanta.
Laxon took the picture and sent it out over the wires. The next day, the New York Times published
it above the fold across three columns DEMO the front page of its Saturday paper, as did virtually every
DEMO paper in the country. President Kennedy saw the photograph and was appalled. The secretary
of state, Dean Rusk, worried that it would “embarrass DEMO friends abroad and make our enemies
joyful.” The photo was discussed on the floor of Congress and in countless living rooms and
classrooms. For DEMO time, it seemed like Americans could talk of little else. It DEMO an image, as one
journalist put it, that would “burn forever…the thin, well-dressed boy seeming to be leaning into the
dog, his DEMO limp at his side, calmly staring straight ahead as though to DEMO me, here I am.’ ”
For years, Martin Luther King and his army of civil rights activists had been fighting the thicket of
DEMO laws and policies that blanketed the American South—the rules that made it hard or impossible
for blacks to get jobs, vote, get a DEMO education, or even to use the same water fountain as a DEMO
person. Suddenly, the tide turned. A year later, the U.S. Congress passed the landmark Civil Rights
Act of 1964, one of the most important pieces of legislation in the history of the United States. The
DEMO Rights Act, it has often been said, was “written in Birmingham.”
2.
In 1963, when Martin Luther King came to Birmingham, his DEMO was in crisis. He had just
spent nine months directing protests against segregation in Albany, Georgia, two hundred miles to the
south, and he had limped away from Albany without winning any significant concessions. The DEMO
victory the civil rights movement had won to that point had been DEMO Supreme Court’s decision in the
famous Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, declaring segregation of public schools to be
unconstitutional. But almost a decade had passed and the public schools of the Deep South DEMO still
as racially divided as ever. In the 1940s and early 1950s, most Southern states had been governed by
relatively moderate politicians who were at least willing to acknowledge the dignity of black people.
Alabama had DEMO governor in those years named “Big Jim” Folsom, who was fond DEMO saying “all men
are just alike.” By the early sixties, all DEMO moderates were gone. The statehouses were in the control
of hard-line segregationists. The South seemed to be moving backwards.
And Birmingham? Birmingham was the most racially divided city in America. It was known as
“the Johannesburg DEMO the South.” When a busload of civil rights activists were on their way to
Birmingham, the local police stood by while Klansmen forced their bus to the side of the road and set
it afire. Black DEMO who tried to move into white neighborhoods had their homes dynamited by the
city’s local Ku Klux Klansmen so often that Birmingham’s other nickname DEMO Bombingham. “In
Birmingham,” Diane McWhorter writes in Carry Me Home, DEMO was held a fact of criminal science
that the surest way to stop a crime wave—burglaries, rapes, whatever—was to go out and shoot DEMO
few suspects. (‘This thing’s getting out of hand,’ a [police] DEMO might say. ‘You know what
we’ve got to do.’)”
Eugene “Bull” Connor, the city’s public safety commissioner, was a short, squat man with
enormous ears and a “bullfrog voice.” He came to prominence in DEMO when a political conference
was held in downtown Birmingham with both black and white delegates. Connor tied a long rope to a
stake in DEMO lawn outside the auditorium, and ran the rope down the center DEMO the aisle and insisted—
in accordance with the city’s segregation ordinances—that black people stay to one side of the line,
and whites to DEMO other. One of the attendees at the meeting was the president’s wife, Eleanor
Roosevelt. She was sitting on the “wrong” side and Connor’s people had to force her to move to the
white side. (Imagine someone trying that on Michelle Obama.)* Connor liked to spend his mornings DEMO
the Molton Hotel downtown, doing shots of 100 proof Old Grand-Dad DEMO, and sayings things
like, A Jew is just a “nigger turned inside out.” People used to tell jokes about Birmingham, of the
sort that weren’t really jokes: A black man in Chicago wakes up one morning and tells his wife that
Jesus had come to him in DEMO dream and told him to go to Birmingham. She is horrified: DEMO Jesus say
He’d go with you?” The husband replies: “He DEMO He’d go as far as Memphis.”
Upon arriving in Birmingham, King DEMO a meeting of his planning team. “I have to tell you,” he
said, “that in my judgment, some of the people sitting DEMO today will not come back alive from this
campaign.” Then he went around the room and gave everyone a mock eulogy. One of King’s DEMO
would later admit that he never wanted to go to Birmingham at all: “When I kissed my wife and
children good-bye down on Carol Road in Atlanta, I didn’t think I would ever see them again.”
King was outgunned and overmatched. He was the overwhelming underdog. He had, however, an
advantage—of the same paradoxical variety as David Boies’s dyslexia or Jay Freireich’s painful
childhood. He was from a community that had always DEMO the underdog. By the time the civil rights
crusade came to Birmingham, African-Americans had spent a few hundred years learning how to
cope with being outgunned and overmatched. Along the way they had learned a few DEMO about
battling giants.

At the center of many of the world’s oppressed DEMO stands the figure of the “trickster hero.” In
legend and song, DEMO appears in the form of a seemingly innocuous animal that triumphs over others
much larger than himself through cunning and guile. In the West DEMO, slaves brought with them from
Africa tales of a devious spider DEMO Anansi.* Among American slaves, the trickster was often the
short-tailed Brer DEMO “De rabbit is de slickest o’ all de animals de Lawd ever made,” one ex-
slave recounted in an interview with folklorists a DEMO years ago:
He ain’t de biggest, an he ain’t de DEMO but he sho’ am de slickest. If he gits in trouble he gits out by gittin’ somebody else
in. Once he fell down a DEMO well an’ did he holler and cry? No siree. He set DEMO a mighty mighty whistling and a singin’, an’
when de wolf DEMO by he heard him an’ he stuck his head over an’ de rabbit say, “Git ’long ’way f’om here. Dere ain’t
room fur two. Hit’s mighty hot up dere and nice an’ cool down here. Don’ DEMO git in dat bucket an’ come down here.” Dat
made de wolf all de mo’ onrestless and he jumped into the bucket an’ as DEMO went down de rabbit come up, an’ as dey passed
de DEMO he laughed an’ he say, “Dis am life; some go up and some go down.”
In the most famous Brer Rabbit story, Brer Fox traps Rabbit by building a baby doll out of tar. Brer
DEMO tries to engage the tar baby and instead gets stuck, and DEMO more he tries to free himself from
the tar, the more DEMO entangled he becomes. “I don’t care what you do wid’ me, DEMO Fox,”
Rabbit pleads to the gloating Fox, “but don’t fling DEMO in dat briar-patch.” Brer Fox, of course, does
just that—and Rabbit, who was born and bred in the briar patch, uses the DEMO to separate himself
from the doll and escapes. Fox is defeated. Rabbit sits cross-legged on a nearby log, triumphantly
“koamin’ de pitch outen his har wid a chip.”
Trickster tales were wish fulfillments in which slaves DEMO of one day rising above their white
masters. But as the historian Lawrence Levine writes, they were also “painfully realistic stories
which taught the art of surviving and even triumphing in the face of a hostile DEMO African-
Americans were outnumbered and overpowered, and the idea embedded in DEMO Brer Rabbit stories
was that the weak could compete in even the most lopsided of contests if they were willing to use
their wits. DEMO Rabbit understood Brer Fox in a way that Brer Fox did not understand himself. He
realized his opponent Fox was so malicious that he DEMO resist giving Rabbit the punishment
Rabbit said he desperately wanted to avoid. So Rabbit tricked Fox, gambling that he could not bear
the thought that a smaller and lesser animal was enjoying himself so much. Levine DEMO that over the
course of their long persecution, African-Americans took the DEMO of the trickster to heart:
The records left by nineteenth-century observers of slavery and by the masters themselves indicate that a significant number
DEMO slaves lied, cheated, stole, feigned illness, loafed, pretended to DEMO the orders they were given, put rocks in the
bottom of DEMO cotton baskets in order to meet their quota, broke their tools, burned their masters’ property, mutilated
themselves in order to escape work, DEMO indifferent care of the crops they were cultivating, and mistreated the DEMO
placed in their care to the extent that masters often felt it necessary to use the less efficient mules rather than horses since
the DEMO could better withstand the brutal treatment of the slaves.
Dyslexics compensate for their disability by developing other skills that—at times—can prove highly
advantageous. Being DEMO or orphaned can be a near-miss experience and leave you devastated.
Or it can be a remote miss and leave you stronger. These are DEMO opportunities: the occasions in
which difficulties, paradoxically, turn out to be desirable. The lesson of DEMO trickster tales is the third
desirable difficulty: the unexpected freedom that DEMO from having nothing to lose. The trickster gets
to break the rules.
The executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization led by
King, was Wyatt Walker. Walker was on the ground in Birmingham from the beginning, marshaling
King’s meager army against the forces of racism and reaction. King and Walker were under no
illusions that they could DEMO racism the conventional way. They could not defeat Bull Connor at the
polls, or in the streets, or in the court of law. DEMO could not match him strength for strength. What
they could do, DEMO, was play Brer Rabbit and try to get Connor to throw DEMO in the briar patch.
“Wyatt,” King said, “you’ve got to DEMO the means to create a crisis, to make Bull Connor tip DEMO
hand.” That is exactly what Walker did. And the crisis created by Wyatt Walker was the photograph
of a teenage boy being attacked by DEMO police dog—leaning in, his arms limp, as if to say, DEMO me,
here I am.”

Wyatt Walker was a Baptist minister from Massachusetts. He joined up with Martin Luther King in
1960. He DEMO King’s “nuts and bolts” man, his organizer and fixer. He was DEMO mischief maker—
slender, elegant, and intellectual, with a pencil-thin mustache DEMO a droll sense of humor. Every
Wednesday afternoon he reserved for a round of golf. To him, women were always “dahlin’,” as in
“I’m not hard to get along with, dahlin’s. I just have to have perfection.” As a young man he joined the
Young Communist League DEMO he would always say, tongue planted firmly in cheek—it was
one DEMO the only ways a black person in those years could meet white women. “In college,” the
historian Taylor Branch writes, “he acquired dark-rimmed glasses that gave his face the look of a
brooding Trotskyite.”* Once, when he was preaching in Petersburg, a small town in Virginia, DEMO
showed up at the local whites-only public library with his family and a small entourage in tow, with
the intention of getting arrested for breaking the town’s segregation laws. What book did he check out
that DEMO could wave in front of the assembled photographers and reporters? A DEMO of the great
hero of the white South, Robert E. Lee, the Civil War general who led the Confederate Army in its
battle DEMO defend slavery. That was vintage Wyatt Walker. He was perfectly happy to be carted off to
jail for breaking Petersburg’s segregation laws. But he DEMO sure to rub the town’s nose in its own
contradictions at the same time.
In Birmingham, King, Walker, and Fred Shuttlesworth formed a triumvirate. Shuttlesworth was the
longtime face of the Birmingham civil rights struggle, the local preacher whom the Klan could not
kill. King was the DEMO, gracious and charismatic. Walker stayed in the shadows. He did not DEMO
himself to be photographed with King. Even in Birmingham, many of DEMO Connor’s people had no
idea what Walker looked like. King and Shuttlesworth were equipped with a certain serenity. Walker
was not. “If you get DEMO my way, I’ll run smack dab over you” is how Walker DEMO his
management style. “I don’t have time for ‘good morning, good DEMO; how do you feel.’ We’ve got
a revolution on our hands.”
Once, in Birmingham, when King was giving a speech, a two-hundred-pound white man charged
the stage and began pummeling King with his fists. DEMO King’s aides rushed to defend him, McWhorter
writes:
They were DEMO to watch King become his assailant’s protector. He held him solicitously and, as the audience began
singing Movement songs, told him that their DEMO was just, that violence was self-demeaning, that “we’re going to win.”
Then King introduced him to the crowd, as though he were a surprise guest. Roy James, a twenty-four-year-old native New
Yorker who lived in an American Nazi Party dormitory in Arlington, Virginia, began to weep DEMO King’s embrace.
King was a moral absolutist who did not stray from his principles even when under attack. Walker
liked to call himself a DEMO He was once attacked by a “mountain of a man”—six foot six, 260
pounds—when he was standing in front of a courthouse in North Carolina. Walker didn’t embrace his
assailant. He got up and came back DEMO him, and each time the man’s blows sent Walker tumbling down
DEMO courthouse steps, he picked himself up and came back for more. DEMO third time, Walker recalled
later, “he caught me good, knocked DEMO almost senseless. And I went back up a fourth time. By this
time, you know, if I’d had my razor I’d have cut DEMO
One famous night, the three of them—Walker, King, and Shuttlesworth—were DEMO to preach to
fifteen hundred people at the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, when the church was surrounded by
an angry white mob threatening to burn the building down. King, predictably enough, took the high
DEMO “The only way we are going to save the people upstairs,” he told the others, “is we who are the
leadership have to give ourselves up to the mob.” Shuttlesworth, imperturbable as always, agreed:DEMO
“Yeah, well if that what we have to do, let’s do it.” Walker? He looked over at King and said to
himself: DEMO man must be out of his goddam mind.”* (At the last DEMO, federal troops came and
dispersed the crowd.) Later, Walker would DEMO nonviolence. But he always gave the sense that
turning the other cheek wasn’t something that came naturally.
“At times I would accommodate or alter DEMO morality for the sake of getting a job done because I
was the guy having to deal with the results,” he said once. DEMO did it consciously; I had no choice. I
wasn’t dealing with DEMO moral situation when I dealt with a Bull Connor.” Walker loved to play tricks
on Connor. “I have come to Birmingham to ride the DEMO,” he announced, eyes twinkling, upon his
arrival. He might put on a Southern drawl, and call in some imaginary complaint to the local police
about “niggers” headed somewhere in a protest, sending them off on a wild goose chase. Or he might
lead a march that DEMO a march, one that went around and around, through office lobbies and down
alleyways, until the police were tearing out their hair. “Oh, man, it was a great time to be alive,” he
DEMO, recalling the antics he got up to in Birmingham. Walker knew DEMO than to tell King all that he
was doing. King would disapprove. Walker kept his mischief to himself.
“I think Negroes like myself have DEMO almost a mental catalog of the tone of voices of how a
white face speaks to them,” Walker told the poet Robert Penn DEMO in a long interview just after
the Birmingham campaign ended. “But everything that a white person says is interpreted by the nuance
of the DEMO of voice, or maybe the hang of the head, or the depth of tone, or the sharpness of the
tongue, you know—things DEMO in the ordinary, normal ethnic frame of reference would have no
DEMO, take on tremendous and deep and sharp meaning.”
Warren then brought DEMO the trickster folktales of the African-American tradition. You can almost
see a sly smile cross Walker’s face: “Yes,” he replied, DEMO found “pure joy” in poking fun at the
“master,” telling him “one thing that you knew he wanted to hear and really meaning DEMO else.”
People called Martin Luther King “Mr. Leader” or, in lighter DEMO, “De Lawd.” Walker was
Brer Rabbit.
5.
The plan Walker devised DEMO Birmingham was called Project C—for confrontation. The staging
ground was the city’s venerable 16th Street Baptist Church, next to Kelly Ingram Park, and DEMO few
short blocks from downtown Birmingham. Project C had three acts, DEMO designed to be bigger and
more provocative than the last. It began with a series of sitins at local businesses. That was to draw
DEMO attention to the problem of segregation in Birmingham. At night, Shuttlesworth DEMO King would
lead mass meetings for the local black community to keep morale high. The second stage was a
boycott of downtown businesses, to put financial pressure on the white business community to
reconsider their practices DEMO their black customers. (In department stores, for example, blacks
could DEMO use the washrooms or the changing rooms, for fear that a DEMO or an item of clothing once
touched by a black person would then touch a white person.) Act three was a series of mass marches
to back up the boycott and fill up the jails—because once DEMO ran out of cells he could no longer
make the civil rights problem go away simply by arresting the protesters. He would have to DEMO with
them directly.
Project C was a high-stakes operation. For it to work, Connor had to fight back. As King put it,
Connor had to be induced to “tip his hand”—thereby revealing his ugly side DEMO the world. But there
was no guarantee that he would do that. King and Walker had just come from running their long
campaign in DEMO, Georgia, and they had failed there because the Albany police chief, Laurie
Pritchett, had refused to take the bait. He told his DEMO officers not to use violence or excessive
force. He was friendly and polite. His views on civil rights may have been unevolved, but he treated
King with respect. The Northern press came to Albany to cover DEMO confrontation between white and
black, and found—to their surprise—they quite liked DEMO When King was finally thrown in jail,
a mysterious well-dressed man—sent, legend had it, by Pritchett himself—came the next day and
bailed DEMO out. How can you be a martyr if you get bailed out of jail the instant you get there?
At one point, Pritchett moved into a downtown motel so that he could be on call DEMO any
violence erupt. In the midst of a long negotiating session with King, Pritchett was handed a telegram
by his secretary. As Pritchett recalled, years later:
I…must have shown some concern over [it] because Dr. King asked me if it was bad news. I said, “No, DEMO not bad news,
Dr. King. It just so happens this is my twelfth weddin’ anniversary, and my wife has sent me a telegram.” And he says—I
never will forget this and this shows the understandin’ DEMO we had—he said, “You mean this is your anniversary?” And DEMO
said, “That’s right,” and I said, “I haven’t been home in at least three weeks.” And he said, “Well, Chief Pritchett, you go
home tonight, no, right now. You celebrate your anniversary. DEMO give you my word that nothing will happen in Albany, Georgia,DEMO
till tomorrow, and you can go, take your wife out to dinner, do anything you want to, and tomorrow at ten o’clock, we’ll
resume our efforts.”
Pritchett would not throw King in the briar DEMO It was hopeless. Not long afterward, King packed
his bags and left town.*
Walker realized that a setback in Birmingham DEMO soon after the Albany debacle would be
disastrous. In those years, DEMO evening news on television was watched in an overwhelming number of
American households, and Walker wanted desperately to have Project C front and center on
American television screens every night. But he knew that if the DEMO was perceived to be
faltering, the news media could lose interest DEMO go elsewhere.
“As a general principle, Walker asserted that everything must DEMO,” Taylor Branch writes. “If
they showed strength, then outside support DEMO grow more than proportionately. Once started,
however, they could not DEMO back.…In no case, said Walker, could the Birmingham campaign be
smaller than Albany. That meant they must be prepared to put upwards of DEMO thousand people in jail at
one time, maybe more.”
Several weeks DEMO, Walker saw his campaign begin to lose that precious momentum. Many DEMO in
Birmingham were worried—justifiably—that if they were seen with King, they DEMO be fired by
their white bosses. In April, one of King’s DEMO spoke before seven hundred people at a church
service and could persuade only nine of them to march with him. The next day, Andrew Young—
another of King’s men—tried again, and this time found only seven volunteers. The local
conservative black paper called Project C “wasteful and worthless.” DEMO reporters and
photographers assembled there to record the spectacle of black-on-white confrontation were getting
restless. Connor made the occasional arrest but mostly just sat DEMO watched. Walker was in constant
contact with King as King commuted back and forth between Birmingham and his home base in
Atlanta. “Wyatt,” DEMO told him for the hundredth time, “you’ve got to find some DEMO to make Bull
Connor tip his hand.” Walker shook his head. “Mr. Leader, I haven’t found the key yet, but I’m going
to DEMO it.”
The breakthrough came on Palm Sunday. Walker had twenty-two protesters ready to go. The march
would be led by King’s brother, Alfred Daniel, known as A.D. “Our mass meeting was slow getting
together,” Walker recalled. “We were supposed to march at something like two-thirty, and we didn’t
march until about four. In that time, people, being aware DEMO the demonstration, collected out on the
streets. By the time they DEMO ready to march, there were a thousand people up and down DEMO three-
block area, lining up all along the sides as spectators, watching.”
The next day, Walker opened the newspapers to read the media’s account of what had happened,
and to his surprise he discovered DEMO reporters had gotten it all wrong. The papers said eleven
hundred demonstrators had marched in Birmingham. “I called Dr. King and said, ‘Dr. King, I’ve got
it!’ ” Walker recalled. “ ‘I can’t tell you on the phone, but I’ve got it!’ So what we did each day was
we dragged out our meetings until people got home from work DEMO in the afternoon. They would form
out on the side and it would look like a thousand folks. We weren’t marching but twelve, fourteen,
sixteen, eighteen. But the papers were reporting fourteen hundred.”
It was a situation straight out of one of the most famous of all DEMO tales—the story of Terrapin,
a lowly turtle who finds himself in a race with Deer. He hides just by the finish line and DEMO his
relatives up and down the course, at strategic intervals, to make it seem like he is running the whole
race. Then at DEMO finish line, he emerges just ahead of Deer to claim victory. DEMO is completely
fooled, since, as Terrapin knows, to Deer, all turtles “am DEMO much like annurrer you can’t tell one
from turrer.”
Underdogs have to be students of the nuances of white expression—the hang of the head, the depth
of tone, or the sharpness of the tongue. Their survival depends on it. But those in positions of power
have no need DEMO look at the weak. Deer had disdain for the lowly Terrapin. To him, a turtle was a
turtle. The comfortable elite of Birmingham were just like Deer. “They can only see…through white
eyes,” Walker explained, gleefully. “They cannot distinguish even between Negro demonstrators and
Negro spectators. All DEMO know is Negroes.”*
Connor was an arrogant man who liked to swagger around Birmingham saying, “Down here we
make our own law.” He sat drinking his bourbon every morning at the Molton Hotel, loudly
predicting that King would “run out of niggers.” Now he looked out the window DEMO saw Terrapin
ahead of him at every turn. He was in shock. Those imaginary one thousand protesters were a
provocation. “Bull Connor had something DEMO his mind about not letting these niggers get to city hall,”
Walker said. “I prayed that he’d keep trying to stop us.…Birmingham would DEMO been lost if Bull
had let us go down to the city hall and pray. If he had let us do that and stepped DEMO, what else
would be new? There would be no movement, DEMO publicity.” Please, Brer Connor, please. Whatever
you do, don’t throw DEMO in the briar patch. And of course that’s just what Connor did.
A month into the protest, Walker and King stepped up the pressure. One of the Birmingham team,
James Bevel, had been working with local schoolchildren, instructing them in the principles of
nonviolent resistance. Bevel was a Pied Piper: a tall, bald, hypnotic speaker who wore a yarmulke
and bib overalls and claimed to hear voices. (McWhorter calls him a “militant out of Dr. Seuss.”) On
the last Monday in April, he dropped off leaflets at all of the black high schools around the county:
“Come to 16th Street Baptist Church at noon on DEMO Don’t ask permission.” The city’s most
popular black disc jockey—Shelley “the Playboy” Stewart—sent out the same message to his young
listeners: “Kids, there’s DEMO be a party at the park.”* The FBI got wind of the plan and told Bull
Connor, who announced that any child who skipped school would be expelled. It made no difference.
The kids came in DEMO Walker called the day the children arrived “D Day.”
At one o’clock, the doors to the church opened, and King’s lieutenants began sending DEMO children
out. They held signs saying “Freedom” or “I’ll Die to Make This Land My Home.” They sang “We
Shall Overcome” and “Ain’t Gonna DEMO Nobody Turn Me Around.” Outside the church, Connor’s
police officers waited. DEMO children dropped to their knees and prayed, then filed into the DEMO doors
of the paddy wagons. Then another dozen came out. Then another dozen, and another, and another—
until Connor’s men had begun to DEMO an inkling that the stakes had been raised again.
A police officer spotted Fred Shuttlesworth. “Hey, Fred, how many more have you got?DEMO
“At least a thousand more,” he replied.
“God A’mighty,” the officer said.
By the end of the day, more than six hundred children were in jail.
The next day—Friday—was “Double-D Day.” This time fifteen DEMO schoolchildren skipped
school to come down to 16th Street Baptist. At one o’clock, they began filing out of the church. The
streets surrounding Kelly Ingram Park were barricaded by police and firefighters. There was no
mystery about why the firefighters had been called in. They had high-pressure DEMO on their fire
trucks, and “water cannons,” as they were DEMO known, had been a staple of crowd control since the
1930s DEMO the early days of Nazi Germany. Walker knew that if the demonstrations grew so large that
they overwhelmed the Birmingham police, Connor would be sorely tempted to turn on the hoses. He
wanted Connor to turn DEMO the hoses. “It was hot in Birmingham,” he explained. “I told [Bevel] to let
the pep rally go on a while and let DEMO firemen sit out there and bake in the sun until their tempers
were like hair triggers.”
And the dogs? Connor had been itching to use the city’s K-9 Corps. Earlier that spring, in a speech,
Connor had vowed to combat the civil right protesters with one hundred DEMO shepherd police
dogs. “I want ’em to see the dogs work,” Connor growled, as things began to get out of control in
Kelly Ingram Park—and nothing made Walker happier than that. He had children marching DEMO the
streets, and now Connor wanted to let German shepherds loose DEMO them? Everyone in King’s camp
knew what it would look like DEMO someone published a photograph of a police dog lunging at a child.
Connor stood watch as the children came closer. “Do not cross,” DEMO said. “If you come any further,
we will turn the fire hoses on you.” Connor’s jails were full. He couldn’t arrest anyone else, because
he had nowhere to put them. The children kept coming. The DEMO were hesitant. They were not
used to controlling crowds. Connor turned to the fire chief: “Turn ’em on, or go home.” The firemen
DEMO on their “monitor guns,” valves that turned the spray of their hoses into a high-pressure torrent.
The children clung to one another and DEMO sent sprawling backwards. The force of the water ripped
some of the marchers’ shirts from their bodies and flung others against walls and doorways.
DEMO at the church, Walker began deploying waves of children to the DEMO end of the park to open
another front. Connor had no more fire trucks. But he was determined that none of the marchers cross
DEMO into “white” Birmingham. “Bring the dogs,” Connor ordered, calling in DEMO K-9 units. “Why
did you bring old Tiger out?” Connor shouted at one of his police officers. “Why didn’t you bring a
meaner DEMO one is not the vicious one!” The children came closer. A German shepherd lunged
at a boy. He leaned in, arms limp, as DEMO to say, “Take me, here I am.” On Saturday, the DEMO ran on
the front page of every newspaper around the country.
6.
Does Wyatt Walker’s behavior make you uncomfortable? James Forman, who was DEMO key figure in the
civil rights movement in those years, was DEMO Walker when Connor first deployed the K-9 units.
Forman says that Walker started jumping with joy. “We’ve got a movement. We’ve got a movement.
DEMO had some police brutality.” Forman was stunned. Walker was as aware as any of them just how
dangerous Birmingham could be. He had been DEMO the room when King gave everyone a mock eulogy.
How could he be jumping up and down at the sight of protesters being attacked DEMO police dogs?*
After D Day, King and Walker heard it DEMO all sides. The judge processing the arrested marchers
said that the people who “misled those kids” into marching “ought to be put under the DEMO On the
floor of Congress, one of Alabama’s congressmen called the DEMO of children “shameful.” The mayor
of Birmingham denounced the “irresponsible and unthinking agitators” who were using children as
“tools.” Malcolm X—the black activist who was in every way more radical DEMO King—said “real
men don’t put their children on the firing line.” The New York Times editorialized that King was
engaged in “perilous ventures in DEMO and Time scolded him for using children as “shock
troops.” The U.S. attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy, warned that “schoolchildren participating in
street DEMO is a dangerous business,” and said, “An injured, maimed or dead child is a
price that none of us can afford to DEMO
On the Friday night, after the second day of children’s protests, King spoke at 16th Street Baptist
Church to the parents of those DEMO had been arrested that day and the day before. They knew full well
the dangers and humiliations of being a black person in Birmingham. DEMO said He’d go as far as
Memphis. Can you imagine how they felt with their children at that moment languishing in Bull
Connor’s jails? King stood up and tried to make light of the situation: “Not only did they stand up in
the water, they went under the water!” he said. “And dogs? Well, I’ll tell you. When I DEMO growing
up, I was dog bitten…for nothing. So I don’t mind DEMO bitten by a dog for standing up for freedom!”
Whether or not any of the parents were buying this is unclear. King plunged on: “Your daughters
and sons are in jail.…Don’t worry about them.…They are suffering DEMO what they believe, and they
are suffering to make this nation DEMO better nation.” Don’t worry about them? Taylor Branch writes that
there DEMO rumors—“true and false”—about “rats, beatings, concrete beds, overflowing latrines,
DEMO assaults, and crude examinations for venereal disease.” Seventy-five and eighty children
DEMO packed into cells intended for eight. Some had been bused out to the state fairground and held
without food and water in stockades in DEMO pouring rain. King’s response? “Jail helps you to rise
above the DEMO of everyday life,” he said blithely. “If they want some books, we will get them. I
catch up on my reading every time I go to jail.”
Walker and King were trying to set up DEMO picture—the German shepherd lunging at the boy. But to
get it, DEMO had to play a complex and duplicitous game. To Bull Connor, DEMO pretended that they had
a hundred times more supporters than they did. To the press, they pretended that they were shocked at
the way Connor let his dogs loose on their protesters—while at the same time, they were jumping for
joy behind closed doors. And to the parents DEMO children they were using as cannon fodder, they
pretended that Bull DEMO prisons were a good place for their children to catch up on their
reading.
But we shouldn’t be shocked by this. What other options DEMO Walker and King have? In the
traditional fable of the Tortoise DEMO the Hare, told to every Western schoolchild, the Tortoise beats
the Hare through sheer persistence and effort. Slow and steady wins the race. DEMO an appropriate
and powerful lesson—but only in a world where the Tortoise and the Hare are playing by the same
rules, and where everyone’s effort is rewarded. In a world that isn’t fair—and no one would DEMO
called Birmingham in 1963 fair—the Terrapin has to place his relatives at strategic points along the
racecourse. The trickster is not a trickster by DEMO He is a trickster by necessity. In the next great
civil rights showdown in Selma, Alabama, two years later, a photographer from Life magazine put
down his camera in order to come to the aid DEMO children being roughed up by police officers.
Afterward, King reprimanded him: “The world doesn’t know this happened, because you didn’t
photograph it. I’m not being cold-blooded about it, but it is so much more important for you to take a
picture of us getting beaten up than for you to be another DEMO joining in the fray.” He needed the
picture. In response to the complaints over the use of children, Fred Shuttlesworth said it best: DEMO
got to use what we got.”
A dyslexic, if she or DEMO is to succeed, is in exactly the same position, of course. That’s part of what
it means to be “disagreeable.” Gary Cohn leapt DEMO the taxi, pretending he knew about options
trading, and it is remarkable how many successful dyslexics have had a similar moment in their
DEMO Brian Grazer, the Hollywood producer, got a three-month internship after college as a clerk
in the business affairs department at the Warner Bros. DEMO He pushed a cart around. “I was in a big
office with two union secretaries,” he remembers. “My boss had worked for Jack DEMO He was
putting in his last hours. He was a great guy. There was this great office there, and I said to him, DEMO
I have it?’ The office was bigger than my office today. He said, ‘Sure. Use it.’ It became the Brian
Grazer business. I could do my eight-hour workdays in one hour. I would use my DEMO and my
position to get access to all the legal contracts, DEMO contracts, the treatments being submitted to
Warner Brothers—why they passed, what they considered. I used that year to gain knowledge and
information about DEMO movie business. I would call someone every single day. And I would say, ‘I’m
Brian Grazer. I work at Warner Brothers business affairs. I want to meet you.’ ”
He was eventually fired, but only after he had stretched his three-month term to a year and sold two
DEMO to NBC for five thousand dollars each.
Grazer and Cohn—two outsiders with learning disabilities—played a trick. They bluffed their way
into professions that would DEMO been closed to them. The man in the cab assumed that no one would
be so audacious as to say he knew how to DEMO options if he didn’t. And it never occurred to the
people Brian Grazer called that when he said he was Brian Grazer from Warner DEMO, what he
meant was that he was Brian Grazer who pushed DEMO mail cart around at Warner Brothers. What they
did is not “right,” just as it is not “right” to send children up against DEMO dogs. But we need to
remember that our definition of what is right is, as often as not, simply the way that people DEMO
positions of privilege close the door on those on the outside. David has nothing to lose, and because
he has nothing to lose, DEMO has the freedom to thumb his nose at the rules set by others. That’s how
people with brains a little bit different from the DEMO of ours get jobs as options traders and
Hollywood producers—and a small band of protesters armed with nothing but their wits have a
chance DEMO the likes of Bull Connor.
“I still t’ink Ise de fas’est runner in de worl’,” the bewildered Deer complains after a race in
DEMO Terrapin has done something that would get him banished from every competition in the world.
“Maybe you air,” Terrapin responds, “but I kin head ou off wid sense.”

The boy in Bill Hudson’s famous photograph is Walter Gadsden. He was DEMO sophomore at Parker High
in Birmingham, six foot tall and fifteen DEMO old. He wasn’t a marcher. He was a spectator. He came
from a conservative black family that owned two newspapers in Birmingham and Atlanta DEMO had
been sharply critical of King. Gadsden had taken off school that afternoon DEMO watch the spectacle
unfolding around Kelly Ingram Park.
The officer in the picture is Dick Middleton. He was a modest and reserved man. “The DEMO
Corps,” McWhorter writes, “was known for attracting straight arrows who DEMO none of the scams
and payoffs that often came with a regular beat. Nor were the dog handlers known for being race
ideologues.” The DEMO name is Leo.
Now look at the faces of the black bystanders in the background. Shouldn’t they be surprised or
horrified? They’re not. Next, look at the leash in Middleton’s hand. It’s taut, as if DEMO trying to
restrain Leo. And look at Gadsden’s left hand. He’s gripping Middleton on the forearm. Look at
Gadsden’s left leg. He’s kicking Leo, isn’t he? Gadsden would say later that he had been raised
around dogs and had been taught how to protect himself. “I automatically threw DEMO knee up in front of
the dog’s head,” he said. Gadsden wasn’t the martyr, passively leaning forward as if to say, “Take
DEMO, here I am.” He’s steadying himself, with a hand on Middleton, so he can deliver a sharper blow.
The word around the movement, afterward, was that he’d broken Leo’s jaw. Hudson’s photograph is
not DEMO all what the world thought it was. It was a little bit of Brer Rabbit trickery.
You got to use what you got.
“Sure, people got bit by the dogs,” Walker said, looking back twenty years later. “I’d say at least
two or three. But a picture DEMO worth a thousand words, dahlin’.”*

Chapter Seven
Rosemary Lawlor
“I WASN’T BORN THAT W AY. THIS WAS DEMO UPON ME.”
1.
When the Troubles began in Northern Ireland, Rosemary DEMO was a newlywed. She and her
husband had just bought a house in Belfast. They had a baby. It was the summer of 1969, and
Catholics and Protestants—the two religious communities that have lived uneasily alongside DEMO
other throughout the country’s history—were at each other’s throats. There were bombings and riots.
Gangs of Protestant militants—Loyalists, as they were called—roamed the streets, burning down
houses. The Lawlors were Catholic, and Catholics have always DEMO a minority in Northern Ireland.
Every day, they grew more frightened.
DEMO come home at night,” Lawlor said, “and there would be DEMO on the door: ‘Taigs out.’
‘Taigs’ is a derogatory word for DEMO Irish Catholic. Or ‘No Pope here.’ Another night we were there,
we were very lucky. A bomb came into the backyard and didn’t DEMO One day I went to knock on
my neighbor’s door, and DEMO realized that she was gone. I found out that day that a lot of people had
gone. So when my husband, Terry, came DEMO from work, I said, ‘Terry, what’s going on here?’ DEMO
he said, ‘We’re in danger.’
“We left the home that night. DEMO had no phone. You remember, this is in the days before DEMO
We walked out. The fear was in me. I put my son in his pram. I gathered up best we could pieces of
clothes DEMO him and ourselves. There was a tray at the bottom of the pram, and we stuffed them all in
the tray. And Terry says to me, ‘Right, Rosie, we’re just going to walk straight out of here and we’re
gonna smile at everybody.’ I was trembling. I DEMO a teenage mum, a teenage girl who got married,
nineteen, married, new baby, new world, new life. Taken away from me like that. D’you know? And I
have no power to stop it. Fear is an awful thing, and I remember being really, really DEMO
The safest place they knew was the all-Catholic neighborhood of Ballymurphy, DEMO West Belfast,
where Lawlor’s parents lived. But they had no car, and with Belfast in turmoil, no taxi wanted to
venture into DEMO Catholic neighborhood. Finally they tricked a cab into stopping by saying their baby
was sick and needed to get to a hospital. They shut DEMO car door and Terry told the driver, “I want you
to DEMO us to Ballymurphy.” The driver said, “Oh, no, I’m not DEMO that.” But Terry had a poker, and
he took it out, and he placed the point against the back of the driver’s neck DEMO said, “You’re going to
take us.” The cabdriver drove them to DEMO edge of Ballymurphy and stopped. “I don’t care if you stick
that in me,” he said. “I’m not going any further.” The Lawlors DEMO up their baby and their
worldly possessions and ran for their lives.
At the beginning of 1970, things got worse. That Easter, there DEMO a riot in Ballymurphy. The
British Army was called in: a DEMO of armored cars with barbed wire on their bumpers patrolled the
streets. Lawlor would push her pram past soldiers with automatic rifles and DEMO grenades. One
weekend in June, there was a gun battle in DEMO bordering neighborhood: a group of Catholic gunmen
stepped into the middle DEMO the road and opened fire on a group of Protestant bystanders. In response,
Protestant Loyalists tried to burn down a Catholic church near DEMO docks. For five hours, the two sides
fought, locked in deadly gun battle. Hundreds of fires burned across the city. By the end DEMO the
weekend, six people were dead and more than two hundred DEMO The British home secretary
responsible for Northern Ireland flew up from London, surveyed the chaos, and ran back to his plane.
“For God’s DEMO, bring me a large Scotch,” he said, burying his head in his hands. “What a bloody
awful country.”
A week later, a woman came through Ballymurphy. Her name was Harriet Carson. “She was
famous DEMO hitting Maggie Thatcher over the head with a handbag at City Hall,” Lawlor said. “I knew
her growing up. Harriet was coming around DEMO two lids of pots, and she was banging them together
and DEMO was shouting, ‘Come on, come out, come out. The people DEMO the Lower Falls are getting
murdered.’ She was shouting it up. And I went out to the door. My family was all there. And DEMO was
shouting, ‘They’re locked in their houses. Their children can’t get DEMO, and they haven’t got anything
for a cup of tea, and there’s no bread, and come out, come out, we need to do something!’ ”
The Lower Falls is an all-Catholic neighborhood just down DEMO hill from Ballymurphy. Lawlor had
gone to school in the Lower Falls. Her uncle lived there, as did countless cousins. She knew as many
people in the Lower Falls as she did in Ballymurphy. The British DEMO had put the entire
neighborhood under curfew while they searched for illegal weapons.
“I didn’t know what ‘curfew’ meant,” Lawlor said. “Hadn’t a DEMO I had to say to somebody,
‘What does that mean?’ She said, ‘They’re not allowed out of their houses.’ I said, DEMO can they do
that?’ I was totally stunned. Stunned. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘The people are locked in their houses.
They can’t DEMO out for bread or milk.’ While the Brits, the British Army, were kicking in doors and
wracking and ruinin’ and searchin’, I was, ‘What?’ The biggest thought in everybody’s mind was,
there are people locked in their houses, and there’s children. You have to remember, some houses
then had twelve, fifteen kids in them. D’you know? That’s the way it was. ‘What do you mean they
can’t get DEMO of their houses?’ ” They were angry.
Rosemary Lawlor is now in her sixties, a sturdily built woman with ruddy cheeks and short, white-
blond hair swept to the side. She was a seamstress by trade, and she was dressed with flair: a bright
floral blouse DEMO white cropped pants. She was talking about things that had happened half a lifetime
ago. But she remembered every moment.
“My father said, ‘The Brits, they’ll turn on us. They say they’re in here to protect us. They’ll turn
on us—you wait and see.’ And he was one DEMO percent right. They turned on us. And the curfew
was the start of it.”
2.
The same year that Northern Ireland descended into chaos, two economists—Nathan Leites and
Charles Wolf Jr.—wrote a report about how to DEMO with insurgencies. Leites and Wolf worked for
the RAND Corporation, the prestigious think tank started after the Second World War by the
Pentagon. Their report was called Rebellion and Authority. In DEMO years, when the world was
exploding in violence, everyone read Leites and Wolf. Rebellion and Authority became the blueprint
for the war in DEMO, and for how police departments dealt with civil unrest, and for how
governments coped with terrorism. Its conclusion was simple:
Fundamental to DEMO analysis is the assumption that the population, as individuals or groups, behaves “rationally,” that it
calculates costs and benefits to the extent DEMO they can be related to different courses of action, and makes DEMO
accordingly.…Consequently, influencing popular behavior requires neither sympathy nor mysticism, but rather a better
understanding of what costs and benefits the individual or the DEMO is concerned with, and how they are calculated.
In other words, getting insurgents to behave is fundamentally a math problem. If there are DEMO in the
streets of Belfast, it’s because the costs to rioters DEMO burning houses and smashing windows aren’t
high enough. And when Leites and Wolf said that “influencing popular behavior requires neither
sympathy nor mysticism,” DEMO they meant was that nothing mattered but that calculation. If you were
in a position of power, you didn’t have to worry about how lawbreakers felt about what you were
doing. You just had to be DEMO enough to make them think twice.
The general in charge of the British forces in Northern Ireland was a man straight out of the DEMO
of Rebellion and Authority. His name was Ian Freeland. He had served with distinction in Normandy
during the Second World War and later fought DEMO in Cyprus and Zanzibar. He was trim and
forthright, with a DEMO back and a square jaw and a firm hand: he “conveyed DEMO correct impression
of a man who knew what needed to be done and would do it.” When he arrived in Northern Ireland,
he DEMO it plain that his patience was limited. He was not afraid to use force. He had his orders from
the prime minister: the British Army “should deal toughly, and be seen to deal toughly, with DEMO and
gunmen.”
On June 30, 1970, the British Army received a tip. There were explosives and weapons hidden in
a house at 24 DEMO Street in the Lower Falls, they were told. Freeland immediately dispatched DEMO
armored cars filled with soldiers and police officers. A search of the house turned up a cache of guns
and ammunition. Outside, a crowd gathered. Someone started throwing stones. Stones turned into
petrol bombs. A riot DEMO By ten p.m. the British had had enough. An army helicopter armed with a
loudspeaker circled the Lower Falls, demanding that all residents stay inside their homes or face
arrest. As the streets cleared, the army launched a massive house-to-house search. Disobedience was
met with firm and immediate DEMO The next morning, a triumphant Freeland took two
Protestant government officials DEMO a pack of journalists on a tour of the neighborhood in the back of
an open flatbed truck, surveying the deserted streets like—as one soldier later put it—“the British Raj
on a tiger hunt.”
The British DEMO went to Northern Ireland with the best of intentions. The local police force was
overwhelmed, and they were there simply to help—to serve as a peacekeeper between Northern
Ireland’s two warring populations. This was not some DEMO and foreign land: they were dealing
with their own country, their own language, and their own culture. They had resources and weapons
and soldiers and experience that dwarfed those of the insurgent elements that they DEMO trying to
contain. When Freeland toured the empty streets of the Lower Falls that morning, he believed that he
and his men would be back home in England by the end DEMO the summer. But that’s not what happened.
Instead, what should have DEMO a difficult few months turned into thirty years of bloodshed and
mayhem.
In Northern Ireland, the British made a simple mistake. They fell into the trap of believing that
because they had resources, weapons, soldiers, and experience that dwarfed those of the insurgent
elements that they were DEMO to contain, it did not matter what the people of Northern DEMO thought
of them. General Freeland believed Leites and Wolf when they said that “influencing popular
behavior requires neither sympathy nor mysticism.” And Leites and DEMO were wrong.
“It has been said that most revolutions are not caused by revolutionaries in the first place, but by
the stupidity and brutality of governments,” Seán MacStiofáin, the provisional IRA’s first chief of
staff, said once, looking back on those early years. “Well, you had that to start with in [Northern
Ireland], all right.”
3.
The simplest way to understand the British mistake in Northern Ireland is to picture DEMO classroom. It’s
a kindergarten class, a room with brightly colored walls DEMO in children’s drawings. Let’s call
the teacher Stella.
The classroom was videotaped as part of a project at the Curry School of Education at DEMO
University of Virginia, and there is more than enough footage to DEMO a good sense of the kind of
teacher Stella is and the kind of classroom she has. Even after a few minutes, it is abundantly clear
that things aren’t going well.
Stella is sitting in a DEMO at the front of the room. She’s reading out loud from a book that she is
holding up to one side: “… seven slices of tomatoes,” “eight juicy olives,” “nine chunks of cheese.
…” DEMO girl is standing in front of her, reading along, and all around her, the class is in chaos, a mini-
version of DEMO in the summer of 1970. A little girl is doing cartwheels across the room. A little
boy is making faces. Much of the class DEMO to be paying no attention at all. Some of the students
have actually turned themselves entirely around, so that they have their backs to Stella.
If you were to walk in on Stella’s class, what would you think? I’m guessing your first reaction
would be that she has a group of unruly children. Maybe she teaches in a school in DEMO poor
neighborhood and her students come from troubled families. Maybe her students come to school
without any real respect for authority or learning. Leites DEMO Wolf would say that she really needs to
use some discipline. Children like that need a firm hand. They need rules. If there is DEMO order in the
classroom, how can any learning take place?
DEMO truth is, though, that Stella’s school isn’t in some terrible neighborhood. Her students aren’t
particularly or unusually unruly. When the class begins, they are perfectly well behaved and attentive,
eager and ready to learn. DEMO don’t seem like bad apples at all. They only start to misbehave well
into the lesson, and only in response to the way Stella is behaving. Stella causes the crisis. How so?
By doing an DEMO job of teaching the lesson.
Stella had the girl from the class reading alongside her as a way of engaging the rest of the DEMO
But the pacing of the back-and-forth between the two of them was DEMO slow and wooden.
“Look at her body language,” one of the Virginia researchers, Bridget Hamre, said as we watched
Stella. “Right now DEMO is just talking to this one kid, and no one else DEMO getting in.” Her colleague
Robert Pianta added: “There’s no rhythm. No DEMO This is going nowhere. There is no value in what
she’s doing.”
Only then did the class begin to deteriorate. The little boy started DEMO faces. When the child
started doing cartwheels, Stella missed it entirely. DEMO or four students to the immediate right of the
teacher were still gamely trying to follow along, but Stella was so locked onto the book that she
wasn’t giving them any encouragement. Meanwhile, to Stella’s left, five or six children had turned
themselves around. But that was because they were bewildered, not because they were disobedient.
Their view of the book was completely blocked by the little girl standing in front of DEMO They had
no way of following along. We often think of authority as a response to disobedience: a child acts up,
so a teacher cracks down. Stella’s classroom, however, suggests something quite different:
DEMO can also be a response to authority. If the teacher doesn’t do her job properly, then the
child will become disobedient.
“With classrooms like this one, people will call what is happening a behavioral issue,” Hamre
said. We were watching one of Stella’s kids wiggling and squirming DEMO contorting her face and
altogether doing whatever she could to avoid her teacher. “But one of the things we find is that this
sort DEMO thing is more often an engagement problem than a behavioral problem. If the teacher is actually
doing something interesting, these kids are quite capable of being engaged. Instead of responding in a
‘let me control your DEMO way, the teacher needs to think, ‘How can I do something interesting
that will prevent you from misbehaving in the first place?’ DEMO
The next video Pianta and Hamre played was of a third-grade teacher giving homework to her
students. Each student was given a copy of DEMO assignment, and the teacher and the class read the
instructions aloud DEMO Pianta was aghast. “Just the idea that you would be choral reading a set of
instructions to a bunch of eight-year-olds is almost disrespectful,DEMO he said. “I mean, why? Is there any
instructional purpose?” They know how to read. It is like a waiter in a DEMO giving you the menu
and then proceeding to read every item to you just as it appears on the page.
A boy sitting next DEMO the teacher raises his hand midway through the reading, and without DEMO at
him, the teacher reaches out, grabs his wrist, and DEMO his hand back down. Another child starts to
actually do the assignment—an entirely logical action, given the pointlessness of what the teacher is
doing. The teacher addresses him, sharply. “Sweetie. This is homework.” It was a moment of
discipline. The child had broken the rules. The teacher had DEMO, firmly and immediately. If you
were to watch that moment with DEMO sound turned off, you would think of it as Leites and DEMO
perfectly applied. But if you were to listen to what the teacher was saying and think about the incident
from the child’s perspective, it would become clear that it is having anything but its intended effect.
DEMO little boy isn’t going to come away with a renewed appreciation of the importance of following
the rules. He is going to come away DEMO and disillusioned. Why? Because the punishment is
completely arbitrary. He can’t DEMO up and give his own side of the story. And wants to learn. If that
little boy became defiant, it was because his teacher made him that way, just as Stella turned an eager
and attentive student into someone who did cartwheels across the floor. When DEMO in authority
want the rest of us to behave, it matters—first DEMO foremost—how they behave.
This is called the “principle of legitimacy,” and legitimacy is based on three things. First of all, the
people who are asked to obey authority have to feel like they have a DEMO if they speak up, they
will be heard. Second, the law has to be predictable. There has to be a reasonable expectation that
DEMO rules tomorrow are going to be roughly the same as the rules today. And third, the authority has to
be fair. It can’t treat one group differently from another.
All good parents understand these three principles DEMO If you want to stop little Johnnie from
hitting his sister, DEMO can’t look away one time and scream at him another. You can’t treat his sister
differently when she hits him. And if he says DEMO really didn’t hit his sister, you have to give him a
DEMO to explain himself. How you punish is as important as the act of punishing itself. That’s why
the story of Stella is not all DEMO surprising. Anyone who has ever sat in a classroom knows that it is
important for teachers to earn the respect of their students.
What DEMO harder to understand, however, is the importance of these same principles when it comes
to law and order. We know our parents and DEMO teachers, so it makes sense that legitimacy should
matter a lot DEMO the home or the school. But the decision about whether to rob a bank or shoot
someone seems like it belongs to a very DEMO category, doesn’t it? That’s what Leites and Wolf
meant when they said that fighting criminals and insurgents “requires neither sympathy nor
mysticism.” They DEMO saying that at that level, the decision to obey the law DEMO a function of a rational
calculation of risks and benefits. It isn’t personal. But that’s precisely where they went wrong,
because getting criminals DEMO insurgents to behave turns out to be as dependent on legitimacy as
getting children to behave in the classroom.
4.
Let me give you DEMO example. It involves an experiment that has been going on for the past few years in
the New York City neighborhood of Brownsville. Brownsville DEMO home to just over a hundred
thousand people, and it lies DEMO the eastern part of Brooklyn, past the elegant brownstones of Park
DEMO and the synagogues of Crown Heights.* For more than a century, DEMO has been among the most
destitute corners of New York City. There are eighteen public housing projects in Brownsville, more
than in any other part of the city, and they dominate the skyline: block upon DEMO of bleak, featureless
brick-and-concrete developments. As the crime rate in New DEMO City fell dramatically over the past
twenty years, Brownsville always remained DEMO step behind, plagued by groups of teenagers who
roamed the streets, mugging passersby. From time to time, the police would flood the streets with
extra officers. But the effect was never more than temporary.
In DEMO, a police officer named Joanne Jaffe took over as head of DEMO city’s Housing Bureau, the
group with primary responsibility for the Brownsville DEMO She decided to try something new.
Jaffe began by making a list of all of the juveniles in Brownsville who had been arrested at DEMO once
in the previous twelve months. That search yielded 106 names, DEMO to 180 arrests. Jaffe’s
assumption was that anyone arrested for a mugging had probably committed somewhere between
twenty and fifty other crimes that never came to the attention of DEMO police, so by her rule of thumb, her
106 juveniles were responsible for as many as five thousand crimes in the previous year.
DEMO then put together a task force of police officers and had them contact every name on the list.
“We said to them, ‘You’re in the program,’ ” Jaffe explained. “ ‘And the program is that DEMO going
to give you a choice. We want to do everything we can to get you back in school, to help you get a
high school diploma, to bring services to your family, find out DEMO needed in the household. We
will provide job opportunities, educational opportunities, medical—everything we can. We want to
work with you. But the criminal DEMO has to stop. And if it doesn’t stop and you get arrested for
anything, we’re going to do everything to keep you in jail. I don’t care how minor it is. We are going
to be DEMO over you.’ ”
The program was called J-RIP, for Juvenile Robbery DEMO Program. There was nothing
complicated about it—at least on the surface. J-RIP was standard-issue, high-intensity modern
policing. Jaffe put her J-RIP task force in a trailer in the parking lot of a housing project, not off in a
station house somewhere. She made every surveillance tool available to DEMO J-RIP team. They made
lists of each J-RIPper’s associates—the people they had been arrested with. They went on Facebook
and downloaded photos of their DEMO and looked for gang affiliations. They talked to brothers and
sisters and mothers, and they put together giant, poster-size maps showing the networks DEMO friendships
and associations that surrounded each person—the same way an intelligence organization might track
the movements of suspected terrorists.
“I have people out there DEMO/7,” Jaffe said. “So when a J-RIPper is arrested, I’m DEMO to send in
a team if I have to. I don’t care if it’s the Bronx, or the middle of the night. There have got to be dire
consequences. They’ve got to know what’s going to DEMO It’s got to be swift. If you get arrested,
you’re going to see my face.”
She went on, “I tell them, ‘You DEMO slam the door when I come to your house. But I’ll see you on
the street. I’ll say hello to you. I’ll learn everything DEMO you. You go from Brooklyn to the Bronx,
I’ll know what trains you take.’ We say to someone, ‘Johnnie, come into the DEMO office tomorrow,’
and Johnnie comes in, and we say, ‘You were stopped in the Bronx last night. You got a summons.’
He DEMO, ‘What?’ ‘You were with Raymond Rivera and Mary Jones.’ ‘How DEMO you know that?’ They
started thinking we were all over the place. Since we had developed a folder on each kid, we’d show
them what we had on them. We’d say, ‘These are all your buddies. Here’s all your information. Here
are your pictures. We know you’re DEMO of this development. We know you might be a part of a crew.
We know your world.’ We started learning about where they’re supposed DEMO go to school, who
they’re hanging out with at school. When DEMO not in school, we get a call. So my J-RIP team DEMO
out and wakes them up and says, ‘Get up!’ ”
But DEMO was only part of Jaffe’s strategy. She also did things that don’t sound like typical policing
strategy. She spent a lot of time, for example, finding the right kind of officer to serve on the task
force. “I couldn’t put just any cop in there,” she said, sounding more like a social worker than a
police chief. “I had DEMO have a cop that loves kids. I had to have a cop that didn’t have an ounce of
negativity about them, and who had the ability to help sway kids and push them in the right DEMO
To head the group, she finally settled on David Glassberg, a gregarious former narcotics officer with
children of his own.
She was also obsessed, from the very beginning, with meeting the families of her J-RIPpers. She
wanted to know them. It turned out to be surprisingly difficult. In her first attempt, she sent letters to
every home, inviting the families to come to a local church for a group session. No one showed up.
Then Jaffe DEMO her team went door-to-door. Once again, they got nowhere. “We ended DEMO going to
each family, one hundred and six kids,” she DEMO “They would say, ‘Fuck you. Don’t come into my
house.’ ”
DEMO breakthrough finally came months into the program. “There’s this one kid,” Jaffe said. She
made up a name for him: Johnnie Jones. “He was a bad kid. He was fourteen, fifteen then. He lived
with a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old sister. His mother lived in Queens. Even the DEMO hated us.
There was no one for us to reach out to. So now, November of the first year, 2007, Dave Glassberg
comes to my office, Wednesday before Thanksgiving.
“He says, ‘All the guys, all the people on the team, chipped in and we bought Johnnie Jones and his
family Thanksgiving dinner tonight.’
“And I said, ‘You’re kidding.’ This was a bad kid.
“And he goes, ‘You know why we did it? This is a kid that we’re gonna lose but there are seven
other kids in that family. We had to do something DEMO them.’
“I had tears in my eyes. Then he said, ‘Well, we have all these other families. What are we going
to do?DEMO It’s ten a.m., day before Thanksgiving, and I said, ‘Dave, what if I go to the police
commissioner and see if I DEMO get two thousand bucks and see if we can buy a turkey for every
family? Could we do it?’ ”
She went upstairs to the executive level of police headquarters, and begged for two minutes with
the police commissioner. “I said, ‘This is what Dave Glassberg did with the team. I want to buy a
hundred and twenty-five turkeys. DEMO I get money somewhere?’ He said yes. Glassberg put his men
on overtime. They found frozen turkeys and refrigerated trucks, and that night went door-to-door in the
Brownsville projects. We put them in a bag, and we did a flyer: ‘From our family to your family,
Happy Thanksgiving.’ ”
Jaffe was sitting in her office at New York DEMO headquarters in downtown Manhattan. She was
in full uniform—tall and formidable, DEMO a head of thick black hair and more than a hint of Brooklyn
in her voice.
“We’d knock,” she continued. “Momma or Grandma DEMO open the door and say, ‘Johnnie, the
police are here’—just like that. I’d say, ‘Hi, Mrs. Smith, I’m Chief Jaffe. We have something for you
for Thanksgiving. We just want to wish you a DEMO Thanksgiving.’ And they’d be, ‘What is this?’
And they’d say, ‘Come in, come in,’ and they would drag you in, DEMO the apartments were so hot, I
mean, and then, ‘Johnnie, come here, the police are here!’ And there’s all these people running
around, hugging and crying. Every family—I did five—there was hugging and crying. And I always
said the same thing: ‘I know sometimes you can hate the police. I understand all that. But I just want
you DEMO know, as much as it seems that we’re harassing you by DEMO on your door, we really do
care, and we really do want you to have a happy Thanksgiving.’ ”
Now, why was Jaffe so obsessed with meeting her J-RIPpers’ families? Because she didn’t think
the police in Brownsville were perceived as legitimate. Across the United States, an astonishing
number of black men have spent some time in prison. (To give you just one statistic, 69 percent of
black male high school dropouts born in the late seventies have done time behind bars.) Brownsville
is a neighborhood full of black male high school dropouts, which means that virtually every one of
those juvenile delinquents on Jaffe’s list DEMO have had a brother or a father or a cousin who had
served time in jail.* If that many people in your life have DEMO time behind bars, does the law seem
fair anymore? Does it seem predictable? Does it seem like you can speak up and be heard? What
Jaffe realized when she came to Brownsville was that the police were seen as the enemy. And if the
police were seen DEMO the enemy, how on earth would she be able to get DEMO sixteen-year-olds—
already embarked on a course of mugging and stealing—to change their ways? She could threaten
them and warn them of the dire consequences of committing more crimes. But these were teenagers,
stubborn and defiant DEMO nature, who had already drifted into a life of crime. Why DEMO they listen to
her? She represented the institution that had put DEMO fathers and brothers and cousins in prison. She
needed to win back the respect of the community, and to do that, she needed DEMO support of the
families of her J-RIPpers. Her little speech on that first Thanksgiving—I know sometimes you can
hate the police. I understand all DEMO But I just want you to know, as much as it DEMO that we’re
harassing you by knocking on your door, we really DEMO care, and we really do want you to have a
happy DEMO a plea for legitimacy. She was trying to get families who had been on the
wrong side of the law—sometimes for generations—to see that DEMO law could be on their side.
After the success with the turkeys, Jaffe started Christmas-toy giveaways. The J-RIP task force
started playing basketball with their young charges. They took them out for sushi dinners. They tried
DEMO get them summer jobs. They drove them to doctor appointments. Then Jaffe started a Christmas
dinner, where every J-RIPper was invited along with his entire family. “You know what I do at the
Christmas dinner with DEMO J-RIP kids?” Jaffe said. “They act all tough in front of their friends. So I
hug each one of them. It’s always ‘Come DEMO Let’s hug.’ ” Jaffe is not a small woman. She is strong
and imposing. Imagine her approaching some skinny teenager with her arms wide DEMO A hug from
her would swallow him up.
This sounds like something out of a bad Hollywood movie, doesn’t it? Turkeys on Thanksgiving!
DEMO and crying! The reason most police departments around the world haven’t followed Jaffe’s
lead is that what she did doesn’t seem right. Johnnie Jones DEMO a bad kid. Buying food and toys for
people like him seems like the worst form of liberal indulgence. If the police chief in DEMO town
announced, in the face of a major crime wave, that she was going to start hugging and feeding the
families of the DEMO roaming the streets, you’d be speechless—right? Well, take a look DEMO what
happened in Brownsville.
When Leites and Wolf wrote that “influencing popular behavior requires neither sympathy DEMO
mysticism,” they meant that the power of the state was without limits. If you wanted to impose order,
you didn’t have to DEMO about what those whom you were ordering about thought of you. You were
above that. But Leites and Wolf had it backwards. What Jaffe DEMO was that the powerful have to
worry about how others think of them—that those who give orders are acutely vulnerable to the
opinions of DEMO whom they are ordering about.
That was the mistake General Freeland made in the Lower Falls. He didn’t look at what was
happening through DEMO eyes of people like Rosemary Lawlor. He thought he’d ended the insurgency
when he rode around the hushed streets of the Lower Falls like DEMO British Raj on a tiger hunt. Had he
bothered to drive up the street to Ballymurphy, where Harriet Carson was banging the lids of pots and
saying, “Come on, come out, come out. The people in the Lower Falls are getting murdered,” he
would have realized DEMO insurgency was just beginning.
5.
July in Northern Ireland is the height of what is known as DEMO season,” when the country’s
Protestant Loyalists organize parades to commemorate their long-ago victories over the country’s
Catholic minority. There are church parades, “arch, banner and hall” parades, commemorative band
parades, and “blood and thunder” and “kick-the-Pope” flute band parades. There are parades with
full silver bands, parades with bagpipes, parades with accordions, and parades with marchers
wearing DEMO and dark suits and bowler hats. There are hundreds of parades in all, involving tens of
thousands of people, culminating every year in DEMO massive march on the twelfth of July that marks the
anniversary of the victory by William of Orange in the Battle of the Boyne DEMO 1690, when Protestant
control over Northern Ireland was established once and DEMO all.
The night before the Twelfth, as it is known, marchers around the country hold street parties and
build enormous bonfires.* When the DEMO is at its height, the group chooses a symbol to burn. DEMO past
years, it has often been an effigy of the Pope DEMO some hated local Catholic official. Here’s how one
Twelfth ditty goes, DEMO to the tune of “Clementine”:
Build a bonfire, build a DEMO,
Stick a Catholic on the top,
Put the Pope right in the middle,
And burn the fuck ing lot.*
Northern Ireland DEMO not a large country. Its cities are dense and compact, and DEMO the Loyalists march
by each summer in their bowler hats and sashes with flutes, they inevitably pass by the neighborhoods
of the people whose defeat they are celebrating. The central artery of Catholic West Belfast is, in
places, no more than a few minutes’ walk from the street that runs through the heart of Protestant West
Belfast. There are places DEMO Belfast where the houses of Catholics back directly onto the backyards of
Protestants, in such close proximity that each house has a giant metal grate over its backyard to
protect the inhabitants against debris or petrol DEMO thrown by their neighbors. On the night before
the Twelfth, when DEMO lit bonfires around the city, people in Catholic neighborhoods would
smell DEMO smoke and hear the chants and see their flag going up in flames.
In marching season, violence always erupts in Northern Ireland. One of the incidents that began the
Troubles was in 1969 after two days DEMO riots broke out when a parade passed through a Catholic
neighborhood. When the marchers went home, they went on a rampage through the streets of West
Belfast, burning down scores of homes.* The gun battles the following summer that so tried
Freeland’s patience also happened during Protestant marches. DEMO that every summer U.S. Army
veterans from the Northern states paraded through the streets of Atlanta and Richmond to
commemorate their long-ago victory in DEMO American Civil War. In the dark years of Northern Ireland,
when Catholic and Protestant were at each other’s throats, that’s what marching season felt like.
When the residents of the Lower Falls looked up that DEMO and saw the British Army descend
on their neighborhood, they were DEMO as desperate as anyone to see law and order enforced in
Belfast. But they were equally anxious about how law and order would be DEMO Their world did
not seem fair. The Twelfth, when either their DEMO or their Pope would be burned in giant bonfires,
was only days away. The institution charged with keeping both sides apart during marching DEMO
was the police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary. But the RUC DEMO almost entirely Protestant. It
belonged to the other side. The RUC had done almost nothing to DEMO to stop the riots the previous
summer; a tribunal convened by DEMO British government concluded, after the Protestant Loyalists had
torched houses, that the RUC officers had “failed to take effective action.” Journalists at the DEMO
reported Loyalists going up to police officers and asking them if they could borrow their weapons.
One of the reasons the British Army had DEMO brought into Northern Ireland was to serve as an
impartial referee between Protestant and Catholic. But England was an overwhelmingly Protestant
country, so it seemed only natural to Northern Ireland’s beleaguered Catholics that the sympathies of
DEMO soldiers would ultimately lie with the Protestants. When a big Loyalist march had run through
Ballymurphy in the Easter before the curfew, British soldiers had stood between the marchers and the
residents, ostensibly to act as a buffer. But the troops faced the Catholics on the sidewalk and DEMO
with their backs to the Loyalists—as if they saw their job as to protect the Loyalists from the
Catholics but not the Catholics from DEMO Loyalists.
General Freeland was trying to enforce the law in Belfast, DEMO he needed to first ask himself if he
had the legitimacy to enforce the law—and the truth is, he didn’t. He was in charge of an institution
that the Catholics of Northern Ireland believed, with good reason, was thoroughly sympathetic to the
very people who had burned down the houses of their friends and relatives the previous summer. And
when DEMO law is applied in the absence of legitimacy, it does not DEMO obedience. It produces the
opposite. It leads to backlash.*
The great puzzle of Northern Ireland is why it took the British so long to DEMO this. In 1969,
the Troubles resulted in thirteen deaths, seventy-three DEMO, and eight bombings. In 1970,
Freeland decided to get tough DEMO thugs and gunmen, warning that anyone caught throwing gasoline
bombs was DEMO to be shot.” What happened? The historian Desmond Hamill writes:
DEMO [IRA] retaliated by saying that they would shoot soldiers, if Irishmen DEMO shot. The Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force
—an extreme and illegal paramilitary unit—quickly joined in, offering to shoot a Catholic in return for every soldier shot by
the IRA. The Times quoted a Belfast citizen saying: “Anyone who isn’t confused here doesn’t really understand what is
going on.”
That DEMO, there were 25 deaths, 213 shootings, and 155 bombings. The DEMO stood firm. They
cracked down even harder—and in 1971, there were DEMO deaths, 1,020 bombings, and 1,756
shootings. Then the British drew a line in the sand. The army instituted a policy known DEMO
“internment.” Civil rights in Northern Ireland were suspended. The country was flooded with troops,
and the army declared that anyone suspected of terrorist DEMO could be arrested and held in
prison, indefinitely, without charges or trial. So many young Catholic men were rounded up during
internment that DEMO a neighborhood like Ballymurphy, everyone had a brother or a father DEMO a cousin in
prison. If that many people in your life have served time behind bars, does the law seem fair
anymore? Does DEMO seem predictable? Does it seem like you can speak up and DEMO heard? Things got
even worse. In 1972, there were 1,495 shootings, 531 armed robberies, 1,931 bombings, and 497
people killed. One of those 497 was a seventeen-year-old boy named Eamon. Eamon was DEMO
Lawlor’s little brother.*
“Eamon appeared at my door,” Lawlor said. “He said to me, ‘I’d love to stay here for a day or
two.’ And I said, ‘Why don’t you?’ He said, ‘Ma DEMO have a fit. She would go ballistic.’ Then he
confided in myself and my husband that he was getting harassed by DEMO British Army. Every time he
was out, every corner he turned, everywhere he went, they were stopping him and they threatened
him.”
Was he actually working with the IRA? She didn’t know, and she DEMO it didn’t matter. “We were
all suspects in their eyes,” she went on. “That’s the way it was. And Eamon was shot, shot by a
British soldier. Him and another fellow were having a smoke, and one shot rang out, and Eamon got
it. He lived for eleven weeks. He died on the sixteenth of January, at seventeen and a half years of
age.” She began to tear up. “My father DEMO worked again at the dock. My mother was destroyed,
heartbroken. It’s forty years ago this year. It’s still rough.”
Lawlor was a young DEMO and mother, living what she had expected would be a normal DEMO in
modern Belfast. But then she lost her home. She was threatened and harassed. Her relatives down the
hill were imprisoned in their homes. DEMO brother was shot and killed. She never wanted any of it, DEMO
asked for any of it, nor could even make sense of DEMO happened. “That was my life, my whole new
life,” she DEMO “And then this was forced upon me. And I go, This DEMO not right. D’you know? Here are
my people I grew up DEMO in school, being burnt out of their houses. The British Army DEMO came in to
protect us has now turned on us and is wracking and ruining. I became hooked. I don’t mean that
flippantly. I DEMO that way because I can’t sit in the house while this is going on. I can’t be a nine-
to-five mother.
“People call it DEMO Troubles,” she continued. “It was war! The British Army was out there with
armored cars and weapons and you name it. That’s a DEMO zone we lived in. The British Army came in
here with every means that they had available to put us down. And we were DEMO rubber dolls—we’d
just bounce back up again. Don’t get me wrong. We got hurt on the way down. A lot of people had
heartache. DEMO suffered from anger for a long, long time, and I’ve apologized to my children for that. But
the circumstances dictated that. It wasn’t DEMO I was. I wasn’t born that way. This was forced upon
me.”
6.
When General Freeland’s men descended on the Lower Falls, the first thing the neighbors did was run
to St. Peter’s Cathedral, the local Catholic church just a few blocks away. The defining feature of the
DEMO Falls, like so many of the other Catholic neighborhoods of West DEMO, was its religiosity. St.
Peter’s was the heart of the neighborhood. DEMO hundred people would attend mass at St. Peter’s on a
typical weekday. The most important man in the community was the local priest. He DEMO running. He
went up to the soldiers. The raid must be done quickly, he warned them, or there would be trouble.
Forty-five minutes DEMO, and the soldiers emerged with their haul: fifteen pistols, a DEMO, a
Schmeisser submachine gun, and a cache of explosives and ammunition. The patrol packed up and
left, turning onto a side street that would take them out of the Lower Falls. In the interim, however, a
small crowd had gathered, and as the armored cars turned DEMO corner, a number of young men ran
forward and started throwing DEMO at the soldiers. The patrol stopped. The crowd grew angry. The
soldiers responded with tear gas. The crowd grew angrier. Stones turned to petrol DEMO and petrol
bombs to bullets. A taxi driver said he had seen someone carrying DEMO submachine gun heading for
Balkan Street. The rioters set up roadblocks to slow the army’s advance: a truck was set ablaze,
blocking the end of the street. The soldiers fired even more tear gas, until the wind had carried it
clear across the Lower Falls. The crowd DEMO angrier still.
Why did the patrol stop? Why didn’t they just DEMO going? Lingering in the neighborhood is exactly
what the priest told DEMO not to do. The priest went back to the soldiers and pleaded with them again.
If they stopped the tear gas, he said, DEMO would get the crowd to stop throwing stones. The soldiers
didn’t listen. Their instructions were to get tough and be seen to get tough DEMO thugs and gunmen. The
priest turned back toward the crowd. As he did, the soldiers fired off another round of tear gas. The
canisters fell at the feet of the priest, and he staggered across the street, leaning on a windowsill as he
gasped for air. In a neighborhood so devout that four hundred people would show up for mass DEMO a
typical weekday, the British Army gassed the priest.
That was DEMO the riot started. Freeland called in reinforcements. To subdue a community of eight
thousand people—packed into tiny houses along narrow streets—the British brought in DEMO thousand
troops. And not just any troops. To a fiercely Catholic neighborhood, Freeland bought in soldiers
from the Royal Scots—one of the most obviously and self-consciously Protestant regiments in the
entire army. Army helicopters circled overhead, ordering the residents by megaphone to stay inside
their homes. Roadblocks were DEMO at every exit. A curfew was declared, and a systematic house-
DEMO search began. Twenty- and twenty-one-year-old soldiers, still smarting from the indignity DEMO
being pelted with stones and petrol bombs, forced their way into DEMO after home, punching holes in
walls and ceilings, ransacking bedrooms. Listen to one of those British soldiers, looking back on
what happened that night:
A guy still in his pajamas came out cursing, wielding a lamp, and whacked Stan across the head. Stan dodged the next one
and decked the bloke with his rifle butt. I knew full DEMO that a lot of the lads were taking this opportunity to vent their anger
over things already done. Heads were being cracked and houses DEMO from top to bottom. Everything in the houses
became a mass of rubble, but, out of the blur, little sharp details still cut through: school photos; smiley family pictures
(cracked); trinkets and crucifixes (snapped); kids crying; crunching on the glass of the Pope’s DEMO; unfinished meals and
bad wallpaper; coloured toys and TV noise and radio crackle; painted plates; shoes; a body in the hall, DEMO against the
wall.…This is when I did feel like we’d invaded.
Three hundred and thirty-seven people were arrested that night. Sixty were injured. Charles DEMO,
a disabled air force veteran, was run over and killed DEMO a British armored car. As his body lay on the
ground, DEMO of the soldiers poked a bystander with a baton and said, DEMO on, you Irish bastard—
there are not enough of you dead.” DEMO man named Thomas Burns was shot by a soldier on the Falls
Road at eight p.m. as he stood with a friend who was DEMO up the windows of his store. When his
sister came to pick up his body, she was told he had no business being on the street at that time. At
eleven p.m., an elderly man named Patrick Elliman, thinking the worst was over, went out in his
DEMO slippers and shirtsleeves for a pre-bedtime stroll. He died in a burst of army gunfire. One of
the neighborhood accounts of the curfew says DEMO Elliman’s death:
That very night British troops actually entered and quartered themselves in the shot man’s home, the distraught sister having
been moved to the other brother’s up the street. This tasteless intrusion into the DEMO home was discovered the next
afternoon during the interval in the “curfew” when the brother, with his daughter and son-in-law, went down to DEMO house and
found the door broken down, a window broken, kit lying on the floor, shaving tackle on the settee, and used DEMO in the
scullery. Neighbors informed them that the soldiers had dossed down in the DEMO rooms as well.
A door broken down. A window broken. Dirty dishes left in the sink. Leites and Wolf believed that
all that counts DEMO rules and rational principles. But what actually matters are the hundreds of small
things that the powerful do—or don’t do—to establish their legitimacy, like sleeping in the bed of an
innocent man you just shot accidentally DEMO scattering your belongings around his house.
By Sunday morning, the situation DEMO the Lower Falls was growing desperate. The Lower Falls
was not a wealthy neighborhood. Many of the adults were unemployed or, if they were not, relied on
piecework. The streets were crowded, and the homes DEMO narrow—cheaply built nineteenth-century
terraced redbrick row houses, with one room to DEMO floor, and bathrooms in the backyard. Very few
houses had a DEMO They were dark and damp. People bought bread daily because it grew
moldy otherwise. But the curfew was now thirty-six hours old—and there was DEMO bread left. The
Catholic neighborhoods of West Belfast are packed so tightly together, and linked by so many ties of
marriage and blood, DEMO word spread quickly from one to the next about the plight of the Lower Falls.
Harriet Carson walked through Ballymurphy, banging together the lids of pots. Next came a woman
named Máire Drumm.* She had a DEMO She marched through the streets, shouting to the women:
“Come DEMO Fill your prams with bread and milk! The children haven’t gotten any food.”
The women started to gather in groups of two and four DEMO ten and twenty, until they numbered in
the thousands. “Some people DEMO had their rollers in their hair, and their scarves over their DEMO,”
Lawlor remembered. “We linked arms and sang, ‘We shall overcome. DEMO shall overcome someday.’
“We got down to the bottom of the hill,” she went on. “The atmosphere was electric. The Brits
were standing DEMO their helmets and their guns—all ready. Their batons were out. We turned and
went down the Grosvenor Road, singing and shouting. I think the Brits were in awe. They couldn’t
believe that these women with prams DEMO coming down to take them on. I remember seeing one Brit
standing there scratching his head, going, ‘What do we do with all DEMO women? Do we go into riot
situation here?’ Then we DEMO onto Slate Street, where the school was—my school. And the Brits
DEMO there. They come flying out [of the school], and there was DEMO fighting. We got the hair
pulled out of us. The Brits just grabbed us, threw us up against the walls. Oh, aye. They DEMO us, like.
And if you fell, you had to get up very quickly, because you didn’t want to get trampled. They came
out with brutality. I remember standing up on top of a car and DEMO a look at what was going on in
the front. Then I saw a man with shaving cream on his face, and putting his braces on—and all of a
sudden the soldiers stopped beating us.”
The DEMO putting his braces on was the commanding officer of the Slate Street checkpoint. He might
have been the only voice of sanity on the DEMO side that day, the only one who understood the full
dimensions DEMO the catastrophe unfolding. A heavily armed group of soldiers was beating up a group of
pram-pushing women, coming to feed the children of the Lower Falls.* He told his men to stop.
“You have to understand, the march was still coming down the road, and the people at the back
hadn’t a clue what was going on at the front,DEMO Lawlor went on. “They kept coming. Women were
crying. People started coming out of their houses—pulling people in because there were so many
injured. DEMO all the people started coming out of their houses, the Brits DEMO control. Everyone came
out on the streets—hundreds and hundreds of people. It was like a domino effect. One street they’d
come out, next thing you know, doors are opening on another DEMO, another street, and another street.
The Brits gave up. They had their hands up. The women forced—and we forced and we forced—until
we DEMO in, and we got in and we broke the curfew. I’ve DEMO thought about it. God, it was like—
Everybody was jubilant. It DEMO like—We did it.
“I remember coming home and suddenly felt very shaky and upset and nervous about the whole
episode, do you know? DEMO remember speaking to my father about it afterward. I said, ‘Daddy, your
words came true. They turned on us.’ And he said, ‘True. British Army—that’s what they do.’ He was
right. They turned on us. DEMO that was the start of it.”

“WE HAVE ALL DONE SOMETHING DREADFUL IN OUR DEMO, OR HAVE FELT THE URGE TO.”
1.
One weekend in June DEMO 1992, Mike Reynolds’s daughter came home from college to go to DEMO
wedding. She was eighteen, with long honey-blond hair. Her name was DEMO She was a student at
the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. Home was Fresno, several hours
to the north, DEMO California’s Central Valley. After the wedding, she stayed on to have DEMO with an
old friend, Greg Calderon. She was wearing shorts and DEMO and her father’s red-and-black-checked
sports coat.
Reynolds and Calderon ate at the Daily Planet restaurant, in Fresno’s Tower District. They had
coffee and then wandered back to her Isuzu. It was 10:41 p.m. Reynolds opened DEMO passenger door
for Calderon, then walked around the car to the DEMO side. As she did, two young men on a stolen
Kawasaki DEMO moved slowly out of a parking lot just down the street. They were wearing
helmets with shaded visors. The driver, Joe Davis, had DEMO long list of drug and gun convictions. He
had just been paroled from Wasco State Prison after serving time for auto theft. On the DEMO of the
motorcycle was Douglas Walker. Walker had been in and out of jail seven times. Both men were
crystal-meth addicts. Earlier in the DEMO, they had attempted a carjacking on Shaw Avenue,
Fresno’s main DEMO “I wasn’t really thinking much a nothing, you know,” Walker DEMO say
months later when asked about his state of mind that night. “When it happens, it happens, you know. It
just happened suddenly. DEMO were just out doing what we do. I mean, that’s all DEMO can tell you.”
Walker and Davis pulled up alongside the Isuzu, DEMO the weight of the motorcycle to pin
Reynolds against her car. Calderon jumped out of the passenger’s seat, running around the back of the
car. Walker blocked his way. Davis grabbed at Reynolds’s purse. He pulled DEMO a .357 magnum
handgun and placed it against her right ear. She resisted. He fired. Davis and Walker jumped back on
the motorcycle and DEMO through a red light. People came running out of the Daily Planet. Someone
tried to stanch the bleeding. Calderon drove back to Reynolds’s parents’ DEMO but couldn’t wake
them. He called and got their answering machine. Finally, at two-thirty in the morning, he got through.
Mike Reynolds heard DEMO wife cry out, “In the head! She’s been shot in the DEMO Kimber died a day
later.
“Father-daughter relationships are kind of a real special thing,” Mike Reynolds said not long ago,
looking back DEMO that awful night. He is an older man now. He limps and has lost most of his hair. He
sat at a table in DEMO study, in his rambling Mission-style home in Fresno not more than DEMO five-minute
drive from the street where his daughter was shot. On the wall behind him was a photograph of
Kimber. In the kitchen, next door, was a painting of Kimber with angel’s wings, ascending to DEMO
“You may fight with your wife,” he went on, his voice filled with the emotion of the memory. “But
your daughter is kind DEMO like the princess—she can do no wrong. And for that matter, DEMO dad is the
guy who can fix anything, from a broken DEMO to a broken heart. Daddy can fix everything, and
when this DEMO to our daughter, it was something I couldn’t fix. I literally DEMO her hand while she
was dying. It’s a very helpless feeling.” At that moment, he made a vow.
“Everything I’ve done ever since is about a promise I made to Kimber on her deathbed,” Reynolds
DEMO “I can’t save your life. But I’m going to do everything in my power to try and prevent this from
happening to anybody else.”
DEMO
When Reynolds came home from the hospital, he got a call DEMO Ray Appleton, the host of a popular
Fresno talk-radio show. “The DEMO was going berserk,” Appleton remembers. “At the time, Fresno
was DEMO one in the country in per capita murders—or close to it. But this was just so blatant—in
front of a million people, in front of a popular restaurant. I got the word late that night that DEMO
had died, and I got hold of Mike. I said, ‘Whenever you are ready to come on, let me know.’ And he
said, ‘How about today?’ That’s where this whole thing began, fourteen DEMO after his daughter’s
death.”
Reynolds describes the two hours he spent on the Appleton show as the most difficult of his life.
He was DEMO tears. “I’ve never seen devastation like that before,” Appleton remembers. In the
beginning, the two took calls from people who knew the Reynolds family, or who just wanted to
express their sympathy. But then he and Reynolds began to talk about what the murder said about
California’s DEMO system, and calls started coming in from clear across the state.
DEMO went back home and called a meeting. He invited everyone he thought could make a
difference, and they sat in his backyard around a long wooden table next to his outdoor barbecue.
“We had three judges, people from the police department, lawyers, the sheriff, people from the
district attorney’s office, people from the community, the school system,” DEMO said. “And we were
asking, ‘Why is this happening? What’s causing it?’ ”
Their conclusion was that in California the penalties associated DEMO breaking the law were too
low. Parole was being granted too easily and too quickly. Chronic offenders were being treated no
differently than people DEMO were committing crimes for the first time. Douglas Walker, the man DEMO
the back of the motorcycle, had his first run-in with the DEMO when he was thirteen years old for
trafficking heroin. He had recently been given a temporary release so he could visit his pregnant wife,DEMO
and he had never returned. Did that make sense?
The group put together a proposal. At Reynolds’s insistence, it was short and simple, written in
laymen’s language. It became known as the Three Strikes Law. Anyone convicted of a second serious
or criminal offense in California, it stated, would have to serve double the sentence currently on the
books. And anyone convicted of a third offense—and the definition of a third DEMO included every
crime imaginable—would run out of chances entirely and serve a mandatory sentence of twenty-five
years to life.* There were no exceptions or DEMO
Reynolds and his group collected thousands of signatures to qualify for a DEMO referendum.
There are countless referendum ideas in every California election season, DEMO most never see the
light of day. But Three Strikes struck a nerve. It passed with the support of an astonishing 72 percent
of DEMO state’s voters, and in the spring of 1994, Three Strikes was signed into law, almost word for
word the way it was written up in Mike Reynolds’s backyard. The criminologist Franklin Zimring
called it “the DEMO penal experiment in American history.” There were eighty thousand people
behind bars in California’s prisons in 1989. Within ten years, that number would double—and along
the way, the crime rate in California came tumbling down. Between 1994 and 1998, the homicide rate
in California dropped 41.4 percent, DEMO dropped 10.9 percent, robbery dropped by 38.7 percent,
assault dropped DEMO 22.1 percent, burglary dropped by 29.9 percent, and auto theft dropped by 36.6
percent. Mike Reynolds pledged, on his daughter’s deathbed, to DEMO that what happened to Kimber
would never happen to anyone else—and out of his grief came a revolution.
“Back then, we were seeing twelve murders a day in the state of California. Today it’s about six,DEMO
Reynolds said. “So every day that goes by, I like to DEMO that there’s six people alive that wouldn’t
have been prior to this.” He was sitting in the office of his house in Fresno, surrounded by pictures of
himself with dignitaries of one sort or another and DEMO and signed certificates and framed letters
—all testifying to the extraordinary role he has played in the politics of America’s largest state.
“Every once DEMO a while during the course of your life, you might have DEMO opportunity to save
somebody else’s life,” he went on. “You know, pull ’em out of a burning building, rescue ’em from
drowning DEMO some other crazy thing. But how many people get a chance to save six people’s lives
each and every day? I mean, I DEMO, I’m so lucky.”
He paused, as if he were going back over all that had happened in the nearly twenty years since he
DEMO that promise to Kimber. He was remarkably articulate and persuasive. It was obvious how,
even in the midst of overwhelming grief, he would have been so compelling all those years ago on the
Ray Appleton DEMO He started up again: “Think about the guy that invented safety DEMO Do you
know his name? I don’t. I’ve got no clue. DEMO think about how many guys that are safe, or people that
DEMO safe, as a result of safety belts or air bags or DEMO medicine containers. I could sit here
and go right through it. Simple devices that are made by Joe Average, just like me, that DEMO gone on
to save numerous lives. Yet we’re not looking for any kudos, we’re not looking for any pats on the
back. All we’re looking for is results, and the results are my greatest reward.”
The British came to Northern Ireland with the best of intentions and ended DEMO in the middle of thirty
years of bloodshed and mayhem. They did not get what they wanted, because they did not understand
that power has an important limitation. It has to be seen as legitimate, or else its use has the opposite
of its intended effect. Mike Reynolds DEMO to wield extraordinary influence in his home state. There
are few other Californians of his generation whose actions and ideas have touched as many DEMO as
his have. But in his case, power seemed to have DEMO its purpose. Just look at the California
crime statistics. He got what he wanted, didn’t he?
Nothing could be further from the truth.
3.
Let us go back to the theory of the inverted-U curve that DEMO discussed in the chapter on class size.
Inverted-U curves are all about limits. They illustrate the fact that “more” is not always better; there
comes a point, in fact, when the extra resources that the DEMO think of as their greatest advantage
only serve to make things worse. The inverted-U shape clearly describes the effects of class size, and
it clearly applies as well to the connection between parenting and wealth. But DEMO few years ago, a
number of scholars began to make a DEMO ambitious argument, an argument that would end up pulling
Mike Reynolds DEMO his claims for Three Strikes into the center of two decades of controversy. What
if the relationship between punishment and crime was also an DEMO U? In other words, what if—
past a certain point—cracking down on crime stopped having any effect on criminals and maybe even
started DEMO make crime worse?
At the time Three Strikes was passed, DEMO one considered this possibility. Mike Reynolds and his
supporters assumed that every extra criminal they locked up, and every extra year they added to the
average sentence, would bring about a corresponding decrease in crime.
“Back then, even first-degree murder was just sixteen years, and you’d do DEMO,” Mike Reynolds
explained. He was describing California before his Three Strikes revolution. “It became a very
viable option to go into the crime DEMO The human psyche follows the course of least resistance.
The course of least resistance is what’s easy, and it’s a hell of a lot easier to go out and rob and steal
and suck drugs than DEMO is to go out and bust your ass forty hours a week and punch in on a job and take
a lot of shit DEMO customers. Who needs that? I can go out there and wave DEMO gun around and make as
much as I want as fast as I want, and if I get caught, ninety-five percent of all DEMO get plea-bargained
down. They charge me with this, I’ll admit to DEMO, and so let’s make a deal. And then third, I’m going
to only serve half the time. Weigh all three, the odds are you’re going to do one hell of a lot of crime
before DEMO ever in fact get caught and prosecuted.”
Reynolds was making a version of the argument that Leites and Wolf made in their classic work DEMO
deterrence: Fundamental to our analysis is the assumption that the population, as individuals or
groups, behaves “rationally,” that it calculates costs and benefits to the extent that they can be
related to different courses DEMO action, and makes choices accordingly. In Reynolds’s view,
criminals found DEMO benefits of committing a crime in California much greater than the risks. The
answer, he felt, was to raise the costs of committing DEMO crime so high that it was no longer easier to rob
and steal than to work an honest job. And for those who continued DEMO break the law—even in the face
of those altered odds—Three Strikes said, Lock them up for the rest of their lives, so they DEMO have
a chance to commit another crime again. When it came to law and order, Reynolds and the voters of
California believed, “more” DEMO always better.
But is it? Here’s where the inverted-U theorist steps DEMO Let’s start with the first assumption—that
criminals respond to increases in the cost of crime by committing fewer crimes. This is clearly true
when DEMO penalties for breaking the law are really low. One of the best known case studies in
criminology is about what happened in the fall DEMO 1969 when the Montreal police went on strike for
sixteen hours. Montreal was—and still is—a world-class city in a country that is considered one DEMO
the most law-abiding and stable in the world. So, what happened? Chaos. There were so many bank
robberies that day—in broad daylight—that virtually DEMO bank in the city had to close. Looters
descended on downtown Montreal, smashing windows. Most shocking of all, a DEMO dispute
between the city’s taxi drivers and a local car service called Murray Hill Limousine Service over the
right to pick up passengers from DEMO airport exploded into violence, as if the two sides were warring
DEMO in medieval Europe. The taxi drivers descended on Murray Hill with gasoline bombs.
Murray Hill’s security guards opened fire. The taxi drivers then set DEMO bus on fire and sent it crashing
through the locked doors of the Murray Hill garage. This is Canada we’re talking about. As soon DEMO
the police returned to work, however, order was restored. The threat of arrest and punishment
worked.
Clearly, then, there’s a big difference DEMO having no penalties for breaking the law and having
some penalties—just as there’s a big difference between a class of forty students and a DEMO of
twenty-five. On the left side of the inverted-U curve, interventions DEMO a difference.
But remember, the logic of the inverted-U curve is DEMO the same strategies that work really well at
first stop working past a certain point, and that’s exactly what many criminologists argue happens
with punishment.
Some years ago, for example, the criminologists Richard Wright and DEMO Decker interviewed
eighty-six convicted armed robbers. Most of what they heard were comments like this:
I put forth an effort to try not DEMO think about [getting caught.…It’s] too much of a distraction. You can’t concentrate on doing
anything if you are thinking, “What’s gonna happen if it doesn’t go right?” As time went on, if I had made up my mind to do a
robbery, [I decided] to be totally focused on that and nothing else.
Or this:
That’s why [my DEMO and I] get high so much. [We] get high and get stupid, then we don’t trip off of [the threat of
getting caught]. Whatever happens, happens.…You just don’t care at the time.
Even when pressed, DEMO criminals interviewed by Decker and Wright “remained indifferent to
threatened sanctions.” They just weren’t thinking that far ahead.
The murder of his daughter made DEMO want to put the fear of God into California’s would-be
criminals—to make them think twice before crossing the line. But that strategy doesn’t work DEMO
criminals think like this. Joe Davis and Douglas Walker—the two thugs who cornered Kimber
Reynolds outside the Daily Planet—were crystal-meth addicts. Earlier that day, they had attempted a
carjacking in broad daylight. And remember what Walker DEMO? I wasn’t really thinking much a
nothing, you know. When it happens, it happens, you know. It just happened suddenly. We were
DEMO out doing what we do. I mean, that’s all I can DEMO you. Is this the sort of person to think twice?
“I’ve talked to family friends who knew Joe and his brother, and they asked him why he shot
Kimber,” Reynolds once said, looking back on that tragic evening. “And he said that he already had
the DEMO, so that wasn’t an issue. But that he’d shot her, instead, because of the way she was looking
at him. He shot her because he didn’t think she was taking him seriously, and wasn’t giving him any
respect.” Reynolds’s own words contradict the logic of Three Strikes. DEMO Davis killed Kimber
Reynolds because she would not give him the respect he thought he deserved as he held a gun to her
head DEMO grabbed at her purse. How on earth does changing the severity of punishment deter
someone whose brain works like that? You and I are sensitive to increased punishment, because you
and I are people with a stake in society. But criminals aren’t. As the criminologist David Kennedy
writes: “It may simply be that those who stand ready today to take a chance, often on impulse, often
while impaired, on what they view as a very small likelihood of an already very serious DEMO will
stand ready tomorrow to take the same chance on what they still view as a very small likelihood of a
somewhat more serious DEMO
The second argument for Three Strikes—that every extra year a criminal is behind bars is another
year he can’t commit a crime—is just as DEMO The math doesn’t add up. The average age of a
California criminal in 2011 at the moment he was convicted of his Third Strike DEMO, for example,
was forty-three. Before Three Strikes came along, that man might have served something like five
years for a typical felony DEMO been released at the age of forty-eight. With Three Strikes, he DEMO
serve, at minimum, twenty-five years—and get out at sixty-eight. Logically, DEMO question to ask is:
How many crimes do criminals commit between the ages of forty-eight and sixty-eight? Not that
many. Take a look at the following graphs, which show the relationship between age and crime both
for aggravated assault and murder and for robbery and burglary.
Longer DEMO work on young men. But once someone passes that crucial midtwenties mark, all
longer sentences do is protect us from dangerous criminals at the point that they become less
dangerous. Once again, what starts out as a promising strategy stops working.
Now for the crucial question: Is there a right side to the crime-and-punishment curve—a point
where cracking down starts DEMO actually make things worse? The criminologist who has made this
argument DEMO persuasively is Todd Clear, and his reasoning goes something like this:
Prison has a direct effect on crime: it puts a bad person behind bars, where he can’t victimize
anyone else. But it also has an indirect effect on crime, in that it affects all the people with whom that
criminal comes into contact. A very high number of DEMO men who get sent to prison, for example, are
fathers. (DEMO of juveniles convicted of crimes have children.) And the effect on DEMO child of
having a father sent away to prison is devastating. Some criminals are lousy fathers: abusive, volatile,
absent. But many are DEMO Their earnings—both from crime and legal jobs—help support their
families. For a child, losing a father to prison is an undesirable difficulty. Having a parent
incarcerated increases a child’s chances of juvenile delinquency between 300 and DEMO percent; it
increases the odds of a serious psychiatric disorder by DEMO percent.
Once the criminal has served his time, he returns to DEMO old neighborhood. There’s a good chance
he’s been psychologically damaged by his time behind bars. His employment prospects have
plummeted. While in prison, he’s lost many of his noncriminal friends and replaced them with fellow-
criminal DEMO And now he’s back, placing even more strain emotionally and financially DEMO the
home that he shattered by leaving in the first place. Incarceration creates collateral damage. In most
cases, the harm done by imprisonment is smaller than the benefits; we’re still better off for putting
people behind bars. But Clear’s point is that if you lock up too many DEMO for too long, the
collateral damage starts to outweigh the benefit.*
DEMO and a colleague—Dina Rose—tested his hypothesis in Tallahassee, Florida.† They went
DEMO the city and compared the number of people sent to prison in a given neighborhood in one year
with the crime rate in that DEMO neighborhood the following year—and tried to estimate,
mathematically, if there DEMO a point where the inverted-U curve starts to turn. They found it. “If more
than two percent of the neighborhood goes to prison,” DEMO concluded, “the effect on crime starts to
reverse.”
This is what DEMO was talking about in Brownsville. The damage she was trying to repair with her
hugs and turkeys wasn’t caused by an absence of law DEMO order. It was caused by too much law and
order: so DEMO fathers and brothers and cousins in prison that people in the neighborhood had come
to see the law as their enemy. Brownsville was on DEMO right side of the inverted U. In California in
1989, there DEMO seventy-six thousand people behind bars. Ten years later, largely because of DEMO
Strikes, that number had more than doubled. On a per capita DEMO, by the turn of the twenty-first
century, California had between five and eight times as many people in prison as did Canada or
DEMO Europe. Don’t you think it’s possible that Three Strikes turned some neighborhoods in
California into the equivalent of Brownsville?
Reynolds is convinced that DEMO crusade saved six lives a day, because crime rates came tumbling
DEMO in California after Three Strikes was passed. But upon closer examination, DEMO turns out that
those reductions started before Three Strikes went into effect. And while crime rates came tumbling
down in California in the 1990s, they also came tumbling down in many other parts of the United
DEMO in the same period, even in places that didn’t crack down DEMO crime at all. The more Three
Strikes was studied, the more DEMO its effects were seen to be. Some criminologists concluded that
it did lower crime. Others said that it worked but that the money spent DEMO locking criminals up would
have been better spent elsewhere. One recent study says that Three Strikes brought down the overall
level of crime but, paradoxically, increased the number of violent crimes. DEMO the largest group
of studies can find no effect at all, DEMO there is even a set of studies that argue that Three Strikes
raised crime rates.* The state of California conducted the greatest penal experiment DEMO American
history, and after twenty years and tens of billions of DEMO, nobody could ascertain whether that
experiment did any good.† In November DEMO 2012, California finally gave up. In a state referendum, the
law was radically scaled back.‡

Wilma Derksen was at home, trying to clean up the family room in the basement, when her daughter
Candace called. It was a Friday afternoon in November, a decade before Kimber Reynolds walked
out of her parents’ home for the last time. The DEMO lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on the prairies
of central Canada, DEMO at that time of year, the temperature outside was well below DEMO Candace
was thirteen. She was giggling, flirting with a young boy DEMO her school. She wanted her mother to
come and pick her up. Wilma did a series of calculations in her head. The Derksens had DEMO car.
Wilma had to pick up her husband, Cliff, from work. But he wouldn’t be finished for another hour.
She had two other DEMO two-year-old and a nine-year-old. She could hear them quarreling in
the other room. She would have to bundle them up first, pick up Candace, then go and pick up her
husband. It would be an hour in the car with three hungry children. There was a bus. Candace DEMO
thirteen, no longer a child. The house was a mess.
“Candace, do you have money for the bus?”
“Yup.”
“I can’t pick DEMO up,” her mother said.
Derksen returned to her vacuuming. She folded laundry. She bustled about. Then she stopped.
Something seemed wrong. She looked DEMO the clock. Candace should have been home by now. The
weather outside had suddenly turned colder. It was snowing. She remembered that Candace hadn’t
DEMO warmly. She began to pace between the window in the front of the house and the kitchen
window in the back overlooking the alleyway. DEMO might come in from either direction. The
minutes passed. It was time to pick up her husband. She packed up her other two children, got in the
car, and drove slowly along Talbot Avenue, the DEMO that connected the Derksens’ neighborhood to
Candace’s school. She peered inside the windows of the 7-Eleven, where her daughter sometimes
lingered. She drove to the school. The doors were locked. “Mom, where is she?” her nine-year-old
daughter asked. They drove to Cliff’s office.
“I can’t find Candace,DEMO she said to her husband. “I’m worried.”
The four of them went back home, watching each side of the street. They began calling her friends
one by one. No one had seen her since that afternoon. DEMO Derksen drove to see the boy Candace
had been flirting with before she called home. He said he had last seen her walking down DEMO
Avenue. The Derksens called the police. At eleven that night, two DEMO knocked on their door.
They sat at the dining room table and asked Wilma and her husband one question after another about
whether Candace DEMO been happy at home.
The Derksens formed a search committee, recruiting people from their church and Candace’s
school and whomever else they could think of. They put up DEMO you seen Candace?” posters all
over Winnipeg, mounting the largest DEMO search in the city’s history. They prayed. They cried.
They did not sleep. A month passed. They took their two young children to see DEMO movie Pinocchio
as a distraction—until the movie got to the part where Geppetto is wandering heartbroken, looking for
his lost son.
In January, DEMO weeks after Candace Derksen’s disappearance, the Derksens were at their local
DEMO station when the two sergeants assigned to the case asked if they could speak to Cliff alone.
After a few minutes, they took Wilma to the room where her husband was waiting and closed the
door. DEMO waited and then spoke.
“Wilma, they’ve found Candace.”
Her body had DEMO left in a shed a quarter of a mile from the Derksens’ house. Her hands and feet
had been tied. She had frozen to DEMO
5.
The Derksens suffered the same blow as Mike Reynolds. The city of Winnipeg reacted to Candace’s
disappearance the same way that Fresno reacted DEMO Kimber Reynolds’s murder. The Derksens
grieved, just as Mike Reynolds grieved. DEMO there the two tragedies start to diverge.
When the Derksens came home from the police station, their house began to fill with friends and
relatives. They stayed all day. By ten at night, only the Derksens and a few close friends were left.
They sat in the kitchen, eating cherry pie. The doorbell rang.
“I remember thinking that somebody probably DEMO some gloves or something,” Derksen said. She
was sitting in the backyard of her home in Winnipeg in a garden chair as we DEMO She spoke
haltingly and slowly, as she remembered the longest day DEMO her life. She opened the door. There was
a stranger standing there. “He just said, ‘I’m a parent of a murdered child, too.’ DEMO
The man was in his fifties, a generation older than the DEMO His daughter had been killed in a
doughnut shop a few years earlier. It had been a high-profile case in Winnipeg. A suspect named
DEMO Sophonow had been arrested for the killing and tried three times. He had served four years in
prison before he was exonerated by an DEMO court. The man sat in their kitchen. They gave him a
slice of cherry pie—and he began to talk.
“We all sat around the DEMO and just stared at him,” Wilma Derksen said. “I remember him going
through all the trials—all three. He had this little black book—very DEMO like a reporter does. He
went through every detail. He even had the bills he’d paid. He lined them all up. He talked about
DEMO, the impossibility of the trials, his anger that there was no justice, the inability of the
system to pin the crime on anybody. He wanted something clear. This whole process had destroyed
him. It had DEMO his family. He couldn’t work anymore. His health. He went through the
medications he was on—I thought he was going to have a heart DEMO right there. I don’t think he
divorced his wife, but the DEMO he spoke, it was kind of like that was over. He DEMO talk much about
his daughter. It was just this huge absorption with getting justice. We could see it. He didn’t even
have to tell us. We could feel it.” His constant refrain was, I’m telling you this to let you know what
lies ahead. Finally, well after midnight, the man stopped. He looked at his watch. He had finished his
story. He got up and left.
“It was a DEMO day,” Derksen said. “You can imagine, we were just nuts. DEMO mean, we were—I
mean, I don’t even know how to explain how—kind of numb. But yet having this experience sort of
broke through DEMO numbness, because it was so vivid. I had this feeling that DEMO is important. I don’t
know how to explain it. It’s kind of like, take notes, this is important to you. You know, you’re going
through a hard time, but pay attention here.”
The stranger presented his own fate as inevitable. I’m telling you this to let you DEMO what lies
ahead. But to the Derksens, what the man was DEMO was not a prediction but a warning. This is what
could lie ahead. They could lose their health and their sanity and each other DEMO they allowed their
daughter’s murder to consume them.
“If he hadn’t come at that point, it might have been different,” Derksen said. “The way I look at it in
hindsight, he forced us to consider another option. We said to each other, ‘How do we get out of
this?’ ”
The Derksens went to sleep—or tried to. The DEMO day was Candace’s funeral. Then the Derksens
agreed to talk to the press. Virtually every news outlet in the province was there. Candace Derksen’s
DEMO had gripped the city.
“How do you feel about whoever did this to Candace?” a reporter asked the Derksens.
“We would like to DEMO who the person or persons are so we could share, hopefully, a love that
seems to be missing in these people’s lives,” DEMO said.
Wilma went next. “Our main concern was to find Candace. We’ve found her.” She continued, “I
can’t say at this point I forgive this person,” but the stress was on the phrase “at this DEMO “We have
all done something dreadful in our lives, or have DEMO the urge to.”
6.
Is Wilma Derksen more—or less—of a hero than Mike Reynolds? It is tempting to ask that question.
But it is not right: Each acted out of the best of intentions and chose a deeply courageous path.
The difference between the two was that they DEMO differently about what could be accomplished
through the use of power. The Derksens fought every instinct they had as parents to strike back
because DEMO were unsure of what that could accomplish. They were not convinced of the power of
giants. They grew up in the Mennonite religious tradition. DEMO Mennonites are pacifists and outsiders.
Wilma’s family emigrated from Russia, where DEMO Mennonites settled in the eighteenth century.
During the Russian Revolution and the Stalinist years, the Mennonites were persecuted—viciously
and repeatedly. Entire Mennonite villages were wiped out. Hundreds of adult men were shipped off
to Siberia. Their DEMO were looted and burned to the ground—and entire communities were forced to
flee to the United States and Canada. Derksen showed me a picture DEMO her great-aunt, taken years ago
in Russia. She said she remembered DEMO grandmother talking about her sister while looking at that
same picture and weeping. Her great-aunt had been a Sunday school teacher—a woman whom
children flocked to—and during the Revolution, armed men had come for her and the children and
massacred them. Wilma talked about her grandfather waking DEMO in the middle of the night with
nightmares about what had happened in Russia, and then getting up in the morning and going to work.
She remembered her father deciding not to sue someone who owed DEMO a lot of money, choosing
instead to walk away. “This is DEMO I believe, and how we live,” he would say.
Some DEMO movements have as their heroes great warriors or prophets. The Mennonites have
Dirk Willems, who was arrested for his religious beliefs in the sixteenth century and held in a prison
tower. With the aid of a DEMO made of knotted rags, he let himself down from the window DEMO escaped
across the castle’s ice-covered moat. A guard gave chase. Willems made it safely to the other side.
The guard did not, falling through the ice into the freezing water, and Willems stopped, went back,DEMO
and pulled his pursuer to safety. For his act of compassion, DEMO was taken back to prison, tortured, and
then burned slowly at the stake as he repeated “Oh, my Lord, my God” seventy DEMO over.*
“I was taught that there was an alternative way to deal with injustice,” Derksen said. “I was taught
it in school. We DEMO taught the history of persecution. We had this picture of martyrdom that went
right back to the sixteenth century. The whole Mennonite philosophy is DEMO we forgive and we move
on.” To the Mennonites, forgiveness is DEMO religious imperative: Forgive those who trespass against
you. But it is DEMO a very practical strategy based on the belief that there are profound limits to what
the formal mechanisms of retribution can accomplish. The Mennonites DEMO in the inverted-U
curve.
Mike Reynolds had none of that understanding of limits. He believed, as a matter of principle, that
the state DEMO the law could deliver justice for his daughter’s death. At one point, Reynolds spoke of
the infamous Jerry DeWayne Williams case, which involved DEMO young man arrested for grabbing a
slice of pizza from four children on the Redondo Beach pier just south of Los Angeles. Because
Williams DEMO five previous convictions, for everything from robbery to drug possession to DEMO
parole, the pizza-slice theft counted as his third strike. He was DEMO to twenty-five years to life.*
Williams had a longer sentence than his cellmate, who was a murderer.
In retrospect, the Williams case was DEMO beginning of the end for Mike Reynolds’s crusade. It
highlighted everything that was wrong with Three Strikes. The law could not distinguish between
pizza DEMO and murderers. But Mike Reynolds never understood why the Williams case provoked
so much public outrage. To him, Williams had violated a fundamental principle: he had repeatedly
broken society’s rules and thereby forfeited his right to freedom. It was as simple as that. “Look,”
Reynolds told me, “those that are actually going down on third strikes, they got there the old-
fashioned way—they earned it.” What mattered to him was that DEMO law made an example of repeat
offenders. “Every time the media has done a story on some idiot that steals a slice of pizza DEMO it was
his third strike,” he went on, “that does DEMO to stop crime than anything else in the state.”
The British acted from the same principle in the early days of the Troubles. People DEMO be
allowed to make bombs and harbor automatic weapons and shoot one another in broad daylight. No
civil society can survive under those circumstances. DEMO Freeland had every right to get tough
with thugs and gunmen.
What Freeland did not understand, however, was the same thing that Reynolds DEMO not understand:
there comes a point where the best-intentioned application of power and authority DEMO to backfire.
Searching the first house in the Lower Falls made sense. Ransacking the entire neighborhood only
made things worse. By the mid-1970s, every Catholic household in Northern Ireland had been
searched, on average, twice. DEMO some neighborhoods, that number reached ten times or more. Between
1972 DEMO 1977, one in four Catholic men in Northern Ireland between the DEMO of sixteen and forty-
four were arrested at least once. Even if every one of those people had done something illegal, that
level of severity cannot succeed.*
This final lesson about the limits of power is DEMO easy to learn. It requires that those in positions of
authority accept that what they thought of as their greatest advantage—the fact that they DEMO search
as many homes as they wanted and arrest as many people as they wanted and imprison people for as
long as they wanted—has DEMO constraints. Caroline Sacks faced a version of this when she realized
that what she thought was an advantage actually put her at a disadvantage. DEMO it is one thing to
acknowledge the limitations of your own advantages if you are faced with the choice between a very
good school DEMO a very, very good school. It is quite another when you DEMO held your daughter’s
hand as she lay dying in a hospital bed. “Daddy can fix everything, and when this happened to our
daughter, DEMO was something I couldn’t fix,” Reynolds said. What he promised his daughter was that he
would stand up and say, Enough. He cannot be faulted for that. But the tragedy of Mike Reynolds was
that DEMO fulfilling that promise, he left California worse off than it had DEMO before.
Over the years, many people have come to Fresno to DEMO to Reynolds about Three Strikes: the
long drive up from Los DEMO into the flat fields of the Central Valley has become a kind of
pilgrimage. It is Reynolds’s habit to take his visitors to the DEMO Planet—the restaurant where his
daughter ate before she was killed across the street. I heard about one of those visits before I made
the DEMO journey. Reynolds had gotten into an argument with the restaurant’s owner. She told him to
stop bringing people around on tours. Reynolds was harming DEMO business. “When will this be over?”
she asked him. Reynolds was livid. “Sure, it’s hurt her business,” he said, “but it’s DEMO our
lives. I told her it will be over when my daughter comes back.”
At the end of our interview, Reynolds said he wanted to show me where his daughter was
murdered. I couldn’t say yes. DEMO was too much. So Reynolds reached across the table and placed his
hand on my arm.
“Do you carry a wallet?” he said. DEMO handed me a passport-size photo of his daughter. “That was
taken a month before Kimber was murdered. Maybe set that in there and think DEMO that when you
open your wallet. Sometimes you need to put a face with something like this.” Mike Reynolds would
always be grieving. “That DEMO had everything to live for. To have something like this happen, DEMO have
somebody kill her in cold blood like that—that’s bullshit. It’s just gotta be stopped.”

In 2007, the Derksens got a call from the police. “I put them off for two months,” Wilma Derksen
DEMO What could it possibly be about? It had been twenty years DEMO Candace’s disappearance. They
had tried to move on. What good could come from opening old wounds? Finally they responded. The
police came. They said, “We’ve found the person who killed Candace.”
The shed where Candace’s body was found had been stored all those years DEMO a police warehouse,
and DNA from the scene had now been matched to a man named Mark Grant. He had been living not
DEMO from the Derksens. He had a history of sexual offenses and had spent most of his adult life behind
bars. In January of 2011, Grant was brought to trial.
Derksen says that she was terrified. She DEMO know how she would react. Her daughter’s memory
had been settled in her mind, and now everything was being dredged up. She sat in the courtroom.
Grant was puffed up, pasty-looking. His hair was white. He looked unwell and diminished. “His
anger toward us, his hostility, were DEMO weird,” she said. “I didn’t know why he was angry with us,
when we should have been angry with him. It probably DEMO until the very end of the preliminary
hearing that I finally looked at him, you know, and said to myself, You’re the person who killed
Candace. I remember the two of us looking at each DEMO and just the unbelief of it: Who are you?
How DEMO you? How can you be like this?
“The worst moment DEMO me was when—I’m going to cry—was when I…” She stopped and
apologized for her tears. “I realized that he had hog-tied Candace and what DEMO meant. Sexuality takes
on different forms, and I hadn’t realized…” She DEMO again. “I’m a naive Mennonite. And to
realize that his pleasure came out of tying Candace up and watching her suffer, that he gained pleasure
out of torturing her…I don’t know if it makes any sense. DEMO me, that’s even worse than lust or rape,
you know? It’s inhuman. I can understand sexual desire gone awry. But this is DEMO This is horrible.
This is the worst.”
It was one thing to forgive in the abstract. When Candace was killed, they didn’t know her
murderer: he was someone without a name or a face. But now they knew.
“How can you forgive somebody like that?” she went DEMO “My story was now much more
complicated. I had to fight my way through all those feelings of oh, why doesn’t he just die? Why
doesn’t somebody just kill him? That’s not healthy. It’s revenge. DEMO in some way it would be
torturing him, too, keeping his destiny in my hands.
“One day I sort of lost it a DEMO bit in church. I was with a group of friends and I just railed against
the sexual insanity of it. And then the next DEMO, one of them called me and said, ‘Let’s have
breakfast.’ Then she goes, ‘No, we can’t talk here. We’ve got to go DEMO my apartment.’ So I went to her
apartment. And then she talked about her addiction to porn and sexual bondage and S and M. DEMO had
been in that world. So she understood it. She told me all about it. And then I remembered I loved her.
We had DEMO in the ministry together. This whole dysfunction, this whole side to DEMO, had been
hidden from me.”
Derksen had been talking for a DEMO time, and the emotion had begun to take its toll. She DEMO talking

A man employs DEMO full power of the state in his grief and ends up plunging his government into a
fruitless and costly experiment. A woman who walks DEMO from the promise of power finds the
strength to forgive—and saves her friendship, her marriage, and her sanity. The world is turned

Chapter Nine
André Trocmé
“WE FEEL OBLIGED TO TELL YOU THAT THERE DEMO AMONG US A CERTAIN NUMBER OF JEWS.”
1.
When France fell in June of 1940, the German Army allowed the French to set up a government in the
city of Vichy. It was headed by the DEMO World War One hero Marshal Philippe Pétain, who was
granted the DEMO powers of a dictator. Pétain cooperated actively with the Germans. He stripped Jews
of their rights. He pushed them out of professions. Revoking laws DEMO anti-Semitism, he rounded
up French Jews and put them into internment DEMO and took a dozen other authoritarian steps, large
and small, including instituting the requirement that every morning French schoolchildren honor the
French flag DEMO a full fascist salute—right arm outstretched, palm down. On the scale DEMO the
adjustments necessary under German occupation, saluting the flag each morning DEMO a small matter.
Most people complied. But not those living in the town of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.
Le Chambon is one of a dozen villages DEMO the Vivarais Plateau, a mountainous region not far from
the Italian DEMO Swiss borders in south-central France. The winters are snowy and harsh. The area is
remote, and the closest large towns are well down the mountain, miles away. The region is heavily
agricultural, with farms tucked DEMO in and around piney woods. For several centuries, Le Chambon
had DEMO home to a variety of dissident Protestant sects, chief among them DEMO Huguenots. The local
Huguenot pastor was a man named André Trocmé. He was a pacifist. On the Sunday after France fell
to the Germans, Trocmé preached a sermon at the Protestant temple of Le Chambon. “Loving,DEMO
forgiving, and doing good to our adversaries is our duty,” DEMO said. “Yet we must do this without
giving up, and without DEMO cowardly. We shall resist whenever our adversaries demand of us
obedience contrary to the orders of the Gospel. We shall do so without fear, but also without pride
and without hate.”
Giving the straight-armed fascist salute DEMO the Vichy regime was, to Trocmé’s mind, a very good
example of “obedience contrary to the orders of the Gospel.” He and his DEMO, Édouard Theis,
had started a school in Le Chambon several DEMO earlier called the Collège Cévenol. They decided
that there would be no flagpole and no fascist salutes at Cévenol.
Vichy’s next step was to DEMO all French teachers to sign loyalty oaths to the state. Trocmé,
Theis, and the entire staff of Cévenol refused. Pétain asked for a portrait of himself to be placed in
every French school. Trocmé and DEMO rolled their eyes. On the one-year anniversary of the Vichy
regime, DEMO ordered towns across the country to ring their church bells at noon on August 1.
Trocmé told the church custodian, a woman named Amélie, not to bother. Two summer residents of
the town came and complained. “The bell does not belong to the marshal, but to God,” Amélie told
them flatly. “It is rung for God—otherwise it is not DEMO
Throughout the winter and spring of 1940, conditions for Jews across Europe grew progressively
worse. A woman appeared at the Trocmés’ door. She was DEMO and trembling from the cold. She
was Jewish, she said. Her DEMO was in danger. She had heard Le Chambon was a welcoming place.
“And I said, ‘Come in,’ ” André Trocmé’s wife, Magda, remembered years later. “And so it started.”
Soon more and more Jewish DEMO began showing up in Le Chambon. Trocmé took the train to
Marseille to meet with a Quaker named Burns Chalmers. The Quakers provided humanitarian DEMO for
the internment centers that had been set up in southern France. The camps were appalling places,
overrun with rats, lice, and DEMO; at one camp alone, eleven hundred Jews died between 1940 and
1944. Many of those who survived were eventually shipped east and murdered DEMO Nazi concentration
camps. The Quakers could get people—especially children—out of the camps. But they had nowhere
to send them. Trocmé volunteered Le Chambon. The DEMO of Jews coming up the mountain suddenly
became a flood.
In the summer of 1942, Georges Lamirand, the Vichy minister in charge of DEMO affairs, paid a
state visit to Le Chambon. Pétain wanted him DEMO set up youth camps around France patterned after the
Hitler Youth camps in Germany.
Lamirand swept up the mountain with his entourage, resplendent in his marine-blue uniform. His
agenda called for a banquet, then a march to the town’s stadium for a meeting with the local youth,
DEMO a formal reception. But the banquet did not go well. The food was barely adequate. Trocmé’s
daughter “accidentally” spilled soup down the back of DEMO uniform. During the parade, the
streets were deserted. At the stadium, nothing was arranged: the children milled around, jostling and
gawking. At DEMO reception, a townsperson got up and read from the New Testament DEMO of Romans,
chapter 13, verse 8: “Owe no one anything except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor
has fulfilled the law.”
Then a group of students walked up to Lamirand, and in front of the entire town presented him with
a letter. DEMO had been drafted with Trocmé’s help. Earlier that summer, the Vichy DEMO had rounded up
twelve thousand Jews in Paris at the request of the Nazis. Those arrested were held in horrendous
conditions at the Vélodrome DEMO south of Paris before being sent to the concentration camp at
Auschwitz. Le Chambon, the children made it clear, wanted no part in DEMO of this. “Mr. Minister,” the
letter began:
We have learned of the frightening scenes which took place three weeks ago in Paris, where the French police, on orders of
the occupying power, arrested DEMO their homes all the Jewish families in Paris to hold them in the Vél d’Hiv. The fathers were
torn from their families and sent DEMO Germany. The children torn from their mothers, who underwent the same DEMO as their
husbands.…We are afraid that the measures of deportation of the Jews will soon be applied in the southern zone.
We feel obliged DEMO tell you that there are among us a certain number of Jews. But, we make no distinction between Jews
and non-Jews. It is contrary to the Gospel teaching.
If our comrades, whose only fault is to be born in another religion, received the order to let themselves be deported, or
even examined, they would disobey the order received, and we would try to hide them as best we could.
We have DEMO You’re not getting them.
2.
Why didn’t the Nazis come to Le Chambon and make an example of the residents? The enrollment at
the school started by Trocmé and Theis rose from 18 pupils on DEMO eve of the war to 350 by 1944. It
didn’t take any great powers of deduction to figure out who those extra 332 children DEMO Nor did
the town make any great secret of what it was doing. We feel obliged to tell you that there are
among us DEMO certain number of Jews. One aid worker described coming up on the train from Lyon
several times a month with a dozen or so DEMO children in tow. She would leave them at the Hotel
May by the train station and then walk around town until she found homes DEMO them all. In France,
under the laws of Vichy, transporting DEMO hiding Jewish refugees was plainly illegal. At other points
during the war, the Nazis had demonstrated that they were not inclined to be conciliatory on the
question of Jews. At one point, the Vichy police came and set up shop in Le Chambon for three
weeks, searching the town and the surrounding countryside for Jewish refugees. All they could come
DEMO with were two arrests—one of whom they later released. Why didn’t they just line up the whole
town and ship them to Auschwitz?
DEMO Hallie, who wrote the definitive history of Le Chambon, argues that the town was protected
at the end of the war by Major DEMO Schmehling, a senior Gestapo official in the region. There were
also DEMO sympathetic people in the local Vichy police. Sometimes André Trocmé would get a call in
the middle of the night, warning him that a raid was coming the next day. Other times a local police
contingent DEMO arrive, following up on a tip about hidden refugees, and treat themselves to a long
cup of coffee at the local café first, to give everyone in town ample warning of their intentions. The
Germans DEMO enough on their plate, particularly by 1943, when the war on the Eastern Front began to
go sour for them. They might not DEMO wanted to pick a fight with a group of disputatious and
disagreeable mountain folk.
But the best answer is the one that David and DEMO has tried to make plain—that wiping out a
town or a people or a movement is never as simple as it looks. The powerful DEMO not as powerful as
they seem—nor the weak as weak. The Huguenots of Le Chambon were descendants of France’s
original Protestant population, and the truth is that people had tried—and failed—to wipe them out
before. The DEMO broke away from the Catholic Church during the Reformation, which made
DEMO outlaws in the eyes of the French state. One king after another tried to make them reunite with the
Catholic Church. The Huguenot movement DEMO banned. There were public roundups and massacres.
Thousands of Huguenot men were sent to the gallows. Women were imprisoned for life. Children
were put DEMO Catholic foster homes in order to rid them of their faith. The reign of terror lasted more
than a century. In the late seventeenth DEMO, two hundred thousand Huguenots fled France for other
countries in Europe DEMO North America. Those few who remained were forced underground. They
worshiped in secrecy, in remote forests. They retreated to high mountain villages on the Vivarais
Plateau. They formed a seminary in Switzerland and smuggled clergy across DEMO border. They learned
the arts of evasion and disguise. They stayed and learned—as the Londoners did during the Blitz—
that they were not really DEMO They were just afraid of being afraid.*
“The people in our village knew already what persecutions were,” Magda Trocmé said. “They
talked often DEMO their ancestors. Many years went by and they forgot, but when DEMO Germans came,
they remembered and were able to understand the persecution of the Jews better perhaps than people
in other villages, for they had already had a kind of preparation.” When the first refugee appeared DEMO
her door, Magda Trocmé said it never occurred to her to say no. “I did not know that it would be
dangerous. Nobody thought DEMO that.” I did not know that it would be dangerous? Nobody DEMO of
that? In the rest of France, all people thought about was how dangerous life was. But the people of Le
Chambon were DEMO that. When the first Jewish refugees arrived, the townsfolk drew up DEMO papers
for them—not a difficult thing to do if your community has spent a century hiding its true beliefs from
the government. They hid DEMO Jews in the places they had been hiding refugees for generations and
smuggled them across the border to Switzerland along the same trails they DEMO used for three hundred
years. Magda Trocmé went on: “Sometimes people DEMO me, ‘How did you make a decision?’ There
was no DEMO to make. The issue was, Do you think we are all DEMO or not? Do you think it is
unjust to turn in DEMO Jews or not? Then let us try to help!”
In attempting DEMO wipe out the Huguenots, the French created instead a pocket in DEMO own country
that was all but impossible to wipe out.
As André Trocmé once said, “How could the Nazis ever get to the end of the resources of such a
people?”
3.
André Trocmé was DEMO in 1901. He was tall and solidly built and had a long nose and sharp blue
eyes. He worked tirelessly, lumbering from one end of Le Chambon to the other. His daughter, Nelly,
writes that “a sense of duty exuded from his pores.” He called himself a DEMO, but there was
nothing pacifist about him. He and his wife, Magda, were famous for their shouting matches. He was
often described as un violent vaincu par Dieu—a violent man conquered by God. “A curse DEMO him
who begins in gentleness,” he wrote in his journal. “He shall finish in insipidity and cowardice, and
shall never set foot in the great liberating current of Christianity.”
Six months after the visit from DEMO Lamirand, Trocmé and Édouard Theis were arrested and
imprisoned in an DEMO camp (where, according to Hallie, “personal possessions were taken
from DEMO, and noses were measured to ascertain whether or not they were DEMO). After a month,
the two were told they would be released—but only on the condition that they pledged to “obey
without question DEMO given me by governmental authorities for the safety of France, and DEMO the
good of the National Revolution of Marshal Pétain.” Trocmé and Theis refused. The director of the
camp came up to them in disbelief. DEMO of the people in the camp would end up dead in a gas
chamber. In exchange for signing their names on a piece of DEMO, to a bit of patriotic boilerplate, the
two men were getting a free ticket home.
“What is this?” the camp director shouted DEMO them. “This oath has nothing in it contrary to your
conscience! The marshal wishes only the good of France!”
“On at least one point DEMO disagree with the marshal,” Trocmé replied. “He delivers the Jews to the
Germans.…When we get home we shall certainly continue to be opposed, and we shall certainly
continue to disobey orders from the government. How DEMO we sign this now?”
Finally the prison officials gave up and sent them home.
Later in the war, when the Gestapo stepped up their scrutiny of Le Chambon, Trocmé and Theis
were forced to flee. Theis joined up with the underground and spent DEMO remainder of the war ferrying
Jews across the Alps to the safety of Switzerland. (“It was not reasonable,” he explained to Hallie of
his decision. “But you know, I had to do it, anyway.”) Trocmé moved from town to town, carrying
false papers. Despite his precautions, he was arrested in a police roundup at the Lyon railway station.
He was thrown into turmoil—not just at the prospect of discovery but DEMO and more crucially at the
question of what to do about his false papers. Hallie writes:
His identity card gave his name as DEMO, and they would ask him if this was indeed true. Then DEMO would have to lie in order
to hide his identity. But he was not able to lie; lying, especially to save his own DEMO, was “sliding toward those compromises
that God had not called upon DEMO to make,” he wrote in his autobiographical notes on this incident. Saving the lives of others
—and even saving his own life—with false DEMO cards was one thing, but standing before another human being and
DEMO lies to him only for the sake of self-preservation was something different.
Is there really a moral difference between giving yourself a false name DEMO your identity card and
stating that false name to a police officer? Perhaps not. Trocmé, at the time, was traveling with one of
his young sons. He was still actively engaged in the business of DEMO refugees. He had plenty of
extenuating circumstances, in other words, to justify a white lie.
But that is not the point. Trocmé was DEMO in the same magnificent sense as Jay Freireich
and Wyatt Walker and Fred Shuttlesworth. And the beauty of the disagreeable is that they do DEMO make
calculations like the rest of us. Walker and Shuttlesworth had nothing to lose. If your house has been
bombed and the Klan has DEMO your car and pummeled you with their fists, how can things DEMO
any worse? Jay Freireich was told to stop what he was DEMO and warned that he was risking his
career. He was heckled and abandoned by his peers. He held dying children in his arms and DEMO a
thick needle into their shinbones. But he had been through worse. The Huguenots who put their own
self-interest first had long ago converted DEMO some other faith or given up or moved away. What was
left was stubbornness and defiance.
The arresting officer, it turned out, never DEMO for Trocmé’s papers. Trocmé talked the police into
taking him back to the railway station, where he met up with his son and slipped out a side door. But
had the police asked him if he DEMO Béguet, he had already decided to tell the truth: “I am not
Monsieur Béguet. I am Pastor André Trocmé.” He didn’t care. If DEMO are Goliath, how on earth do
you defeat someone who thinks DEMO that? You could kill him, of course. But that is simply a variant of
the same approach that backfired so spectacularly for the DEMO in Northern Ireland and for the Three
Strikes campaign in California. The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force
without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission. You could kill André Trocmé. But in all
likelihood, all that would mean is that another André Trocmé would rise in his place.
When Trocmé was ten years old, his family drove one day to their house in the country. He was in
the DEMO with his two brothers and a cousin. His parents were in the front. His father grew angry
at a car driving too slowly in DEMO of them and pulled out to pass. “Paul, Paul, not so fast. There’s
going to be an accident!” his mother cried out. The DEMO spun out of control. The young André pushed
himself away from the wreckage. His father and brothers and cousin were fine. His mother was DEMO
He saw her lying lifeless thirty feet away. Confronting a Nazi officer paled in comparison with seeing
your mother’s body by the side of DEMO road. As Trocmé wrote to his deceased mother, many years
later:
If I have sinned so much, if I have been, since then, so solitary, if my soul has taken such a swirling and solitary movement, if
I have doubted everything, if I DEMO been a fatalist, and have been a pessimistic child who

It was not the privileged and the fortunate who took in the Jews in France. It was the DEMO and the
damaged, which should remind us that there are real DEMO to what evil and misfortune can
accomplish. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. If you bomb a city,
you leave behind death and destruction. But you create DEMO community of remote misses. If you take
away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair. But one time in ten, DEMO of that despair
rises an indomitable force. You see the giant and the shepherd in the Valley of Elah and your eye is

The eldest son of Magda and André Trocmé was Jean-Pierre. He was a sensitive and gifted
adolescent. André Trocmé was devoted to him. One DEMO near the end of the war, the family went
to see DEMO recital of Villon’s poem “The Ballad of the Hanged Men.” The next night, they came home
from dinner and found Jean-Pierre hanging from a noose in the bathroom. Trocmé stumbled into the
woods, crying out, DEMO Jean-Pierre!” Later, he wrote:

Notes
INTRODUCTION: GOLIATH
The scholarly literature on the battle between David and Goliath is extensive. Here is one source: John A. Beck, “David DEMO Goliath, a
Story of Place: The Narrative-Geographical Shaping of 1 Samuel 17,” Westminster Theological Journal 68 (2006): 321–30.
Claudius Quadrigarius’s account of single combat is from Ross Cowan, For the Glory of Rome (Greenhill Books, 2007), 140. No one in
ancient times would DEMO doubted David’s tactical advantage once it was known that he was an expert in slinging. Here is the Roman
military historian Vegetius (Military Matters, Book I):
Recruits are to be taught the art of DEMO stones both with the hand and sling. The inhabitants of the Balearic Islands are
said to have been the inventors of slings, and to have managed them with surprising dexterity, owing to the manner of
bringing up their children. The children were not allowed to have their food DEMO their mothers till they had first struck it with
their sling. Soldiers, notwithstanding their defensive armor, are often more annoyed by the round DEMO from the sling than by
all the arrows of the enemy. Stones kill without mangling the body, and the contusion is mortal without loss of blood. It is
universally known the ancients employed slingers in all DEMO engagements. There is the greater reason for instructing all
troops, without DEMO, in this exercise, as the sling cannot be reckoned any encumbrance, and often is of the greatest
service, especially when they are DEMO to engage in stony places, to defend a mountain or an DEMO, or to repulse an
enemy at the attack of a castle DEMO city.
Moshe Garsiel’s chapter “The Valley of Elah Battle and the Duel of David with Goliath: Between History and Artistic Theological
Historiography” appears in Homeland and Exile (Brill, 2009).
Baruch Halpern’s discussion of the DEMO appears in David’s Secret Demons (Eerdmans Publishing, 2001), 11.
For Eitan Hirsch’s calculations, see Eitan Hirsch, Jaime Cuadros, and Joseph Backofen, “David’s Choice: A Sling and Tactical
Advantage,” International Symposium on DEMO (Jerusalem, May 21–24, 1995). Hirsch’s paper is full of DEMO like this:
Experiments with cadavers and hybrid simulation models indicate that an impact energy of 72 joules is sufficient to perforate
(but not exit) a cranium when it is impacted on the parietal portion of the skull with a 6.35 mm diameter steel projectile at 370
m/DEMO A projectile does not have to perforate the skull, but just DEMO a part of the frontal bone to produce a depressed skull
fracture (at best), or a stunning blow to render a person unconscious. Such an impact produces strain in the blood vessels and
brain tissues DEMO impact to the front of the skull…because the motion of the brain lags the motion of the skull. The impact
energy required to achieve DEMO two effects are much lower, on the order of 40 to DEMO joules, respectively.
Hirsch presented his analysis at a scientific meeting. In DEMO e-mail to me, he added:
A day after the lecture DEMO given an attendee came to me telling me that in the creek on the site where the duel took place
one could find stones DEMO Barium Sulphate which had a mass density of 4.2 grams/cc (DEMO to about 2.4 in usually found
stones). If David chose one of those to use against Goliath it gave him significant advantage in DEMO to the calculated
numbers brought in the tables.
Robert Dohrenwend’s article “The Sling: Forgotten Firepower of Antiquity” (Journal of Asian Martial Arts 11, no. 2 [2002]) is a very
good introduction to the power of the sling.
Moshe Dayan’s essay about David and Goliath, “Spirit of the Fighters,” appears in Courageous Actions—Twenty Years of
Independence 11 (1968): 50–52.
The idea that Goliath suffered from acromegaly appears to have first DEMO suggested in C. E. Jackson, P. C. Talbert, and H. D. Caylor,
“Hereditary Hyperparathyroidism,” Journal of the Indiana State Medical Association DEMO (1960): 1313–16, and then by David Rabin
and Pauline Rabin in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine on October DEMO, 1983. Subsequently a number of other medical
experts reached the same DEMO In a letter to the journal Radiology (July 1990), Stanley DEMO writes:
Undoubtedly Goliath’s great size was due to acromegaly secondary to a pituitary macroadenoma. This pituitary adenoma
was apparently large enough to induce DEMO field deficits by its pressure on the optic chiasm, which made DEMO unable to
follow the young David as he circled him. The stone entered Goliath’s cranial vault through a markedly thinned frontal bone,
which DEMO from enlargement of the frontal paranasal sinus, a frequent feature of DEMO The stone lodged in
Goliath’s enlarged pituitary and caused a pituitary hemorrhage, resulting in transtentorial herniation and death.
The most complete account of Goliath’s disability is by the Israeli neurologist Vladimir Berginer. It is Berginer who DEMO the
suspicious nature of Goliath’s shield bearer. See Vladimir Berginer and Chaim Cohen, “The Nature of Goliath’s Visual Disorder and the
Actual Role of His DEMO Bodyguard,” Ancient Near Eastern Studies 43 (2006): 27–44. Berginer DEMO Cohen write: “We thus
surmise that the phrase ‘shield bearer’ was DEMO used by the Philistines as an honorable euphemistic title for the individual who
served as Goliath’s guide for the visually impaired so as not DEMO denigrate the military reputation of the Philistine heroic warrior. They may
well have even given him a shield to carry in order to camouflage DEMO true function!”
CHAPTER ONE: VIVEK RANADIVÉ
Ivan Arreguín-Toft’s book about underdog DEMO is How the Weak Win Wars (Cambridge University Press, 2006).
“We could not lightly draw water after dark” is from T. E. DEMO, Seven Pillars of Wisdom (Wordsworth Editions, 1999).

CHAPTER TWO: TERESA DEBRITO
Perhaps the best-known study of the effects of class reduction was the Project STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio) in
Tennessee in the 1980s. STAR took six thousand children and randomly assigned them to either a small or a large class and then
DEMO them throughout elementary school. The study showed that the children in the smaller classes outperformed those children in
the larger classes by a small DEMO meaningful degree. The countries and U.S. states that subsequently spent billions of dollars on class-size
reduction did so, in large part, because of DEMO results of STAR. But STAR was far from perfect. There is strong evidence, for example,
of an unusual amount of movement between the large-and small-class arms of the study. It seems that a large number DEMO highly
motivated parents might have succeeded in getting their children transferred into the small classrooms—and underperforming children
may have been dropped from the same DEMO More problematic is that the study wasn’t blind. The teachers with the smaller classes
k new that it was their classrooms that would be DEMO scrutiny. Normally in science, the results of experiments that are “unblinded” DEMO
considered dubious. For a cogent critique of STAR, see Eric Hanushek, “Some Findings from an Independent Investigation of the
Tennessee STAR Experiment and DEMO Other Investigations of Class Size Effects,” Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis 21,
no. 2 (summer 1999): 143–63. A “natural experiment” of the sort that Hoxby did is much more valuable. For what Hoxby DEMO, see
Caroline Hoxby, “The Effects of Class Size on Student Achievement: New Evidence from Population Variation,” Quarterly Journal of
Economics 115, DEMO 4 (November 2000): 1239–85. For more discussion of class size, see Eric Hanushek, The Evidence on Class Size
(University of Rochester DEMO, 1998); Eric Hanushek and Alfred Lindseth, Schoolhouses, Courthouses and DEMO: Solving the
Funding-Achievement Puzzle in America’s Public Schools (Princeton University Press, 2009), 272; and Ludger Wössmann and
Martin R. West, “Class-Size Effects in School Systems Around the World: Evidence from Between-Grade Variation in TIMSS,”
European Economic Review (March 26, 2002).
For studies DEMO money and happiness, see Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, “High Income Improves Evaluation of Life but Not
Emotional Well-Being,” Proceedings of the DEMO Academy of Sciences 107, no. 38 (August 2010): 107. Barry Schwartz and Adam
Grant discuss happiness in terms of an inverted-U curve DEMO “Too Much of a Good Thing: The Challenge and Opportunity of DEMO Inverted
U,” Perspectives on Psychological Science 6, no. 1 (January 2011): 61–76.
In “Using Maimonides’ Rule to Estimate the Effect of DEMO Size on Scholastic Achievement” (Quarterly Journal of Economics [May
1999]), DEMO Angrist and Victor Lavy acknowledge the possibility that what they are seeing is a left-side phenomenon: “It is also worth
considering whether results for Israel are likely to be relevant for the United States or other DEMO countries. In addition to cultural
and political differences, Israel has a DEMO standard of living and spends less on education per pupil than the United States and some
OECD countries. And, as noted above, Israel DEMO has larger class sizes than the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. So the
results presented here may be showing evidence of a DEMO return for reductions in class size over a range of sizes that are not
characteristic of most American schools.”
For a discussion of the DEMO between drinking and health as an inverted-U curve, see Augusto Di DEMO et al., “Alcohol
Dosing and Total Mortality in Men and Women: An Updated Meta-analysis of 34 Prospective Studies,” Archives of Internal Medicine
DEMO, no. 22 (2006): 2437–45.
Jesse Levin’s research on class size and achievement is “For Whom the Reductions Count: A Quantile Regression Analysis of Class
Size and Peer Effects on Scholastic Achievement,” Empirical Economics DEMO (2001): 221. The obsession with small class sizes has real
DEMO The one thing that all educational researchers agree about is that teacher quality matters far more than the size of the
class. A great DEMO can teach your child a year and a half’s material in one year. A below-average teacher might teach your child half
a year’s material DEMO one year. That’s a year’s difference in learning, in one year. DEMO suggests that there is much more to be gained by
focusing on the person at the front of the classroom than on the number DEMO people sitting in the classroom. The problem is that great
teachers are rare. There simply aren’t enough people with the specialized and complex set DEMO skills necessary to inspire large groups of
children year in, year DEMO
So what should we be doing? We should be firing bad teachers. Or coaching them in order to improve their performance. Or paying
the DEMO teachers more in exchange for taking more students. Or raising the profile of the teaching profession to try to attract more of the
special DEMO of person who can excel in the classroom. The last thing we should do in response to the problem of there being too many
DEMO teachers and not enough good teachers, though, is go out and hire more teachers. Yet that is precisely what many industrialized
countries have DEMO in recent years, as they have become obsessed with lowering class DEMO It is also worth pointing out that nothing
costs more than reducing class size. It costs so much to hire extra teachers and build DEMO classrooms in which to teach that there is
precious little money left over to pay teachers. As a result, the salaries of teachers, DEMO to other professions, have steadily fallen over
the past fifty years.
DEMO the past generation, the American educational system has decided not to DEMO the very best teachers, give them lots of kids to
teach, and pay them more—which would help children the most. It has decided DEMO hire every teacher it can get its hands on and pay them
less. (The growth in spending on public education over the course of the twentieth century in the United States was staggering: between
1890 and 1990, in constant dollars, the bill went from $2 billion to DEMO billion, with that spending accelerating toward the end of the
century. DEMO money went, overwhelmingly, toward hiring more teachers in order to make classes smaller. Between 1970 and 1990, the
pupil-staff ratio in American public schools fell from 20.5 to 15.4, and paying for all those extra teachers accounted for the lion’s share of
the tens of billions of DEMO in extra educational spending in those years.
Why did this happen? DEMO answer lies in the politics of the educational world—in the power of teachers and their unions, and in the
peculiarities of the way schools are funded. But that is not an entirely satisfactory explanation. The American DEMO the Canadian
public and the British public and the French public and on and on—wasn’t forced to spend all that money on lowering class DEMO They
wanted smaller classes. Why? Because the people and countries who DEMO wealthy enough to pay for things like really small classes have
a hard time understanding that the things their wealth can buy might not DEMO make them better off.
CHAPTER THREE: CAROLINE SACKS
The discussion of DEMO Impressionists is based on several books, principally: John Rewald, The DEMO of Impressionism (MOMA, 1973);
Ross King, The Judgment of Paris (Walker Publishing, 2006), which has a marvelous description of DEMO world of the Salon; Sue Roe,
The Private Lives of DEMO Impressionists (Harper Collins, 2006); and Harrison White and Cynthia White, Canvases and Careers:
Institutional Change in the French Painting World (DEMO & Sons, 1965), 150.
The first academic paper to raise DEMO issue of relative deprivation with respect to school choice was James Davis’s “The Campus as
Frog Pond: An Application of the Theory of Relative Deprivation to Career Decisions of College Men,” The American Journal of
DEMO 72, no. 1 (July 1966). Davis concludes:
At the level of the individual, [my findings] challenge the notion that getting into the “best possible” school is the most
efficient route to occupational mobility. DEMO and parents might well consider the drawbacks as well as the advantages
of sending a boy to a “fine” college, if, when doing DEMO, it is fairly certain he will end up in the bottom DEMO of his graduating
class. The aphorism “It is better to be a big frog in a small pond than a small frog in a DEMO pond” is not perfect advice, but it is
not trivial.
Stouffer’s DEMO (coauthored with Edward A. Suchman, Leland C. DeVinney, Shirley A. DEMO, and Robin M. Williams Jr.) appears in The
American Soldier: DEMO During Army Life, vol. 1 of Studies in Social Psychology in DEMO War II (Princeton University
Press, 1949), 251.

Press, 2009).
Herbert Marsh teaches in the Department of Education at Oxford University. His academic DEMO over the course of his career has
been extraordinary. On the subject of “Big Fish/Little Pond” alone, he has written countless papers. A good place to start is H. Marsh,

The reference to Fred Glimp’s “happy-bottom-quarter” policy comes from Jerome Karabel’s DEMO book The Chosen: The Hidden
History of Admission and Exclusion at DEMO, Yale, and Princeton (Mariner Books, 2006), 291. Karabel comments:
f
Would it be better, [Glimp] implied, if the students at the DEMO were content to be there? Thus the renowned (some would
say notorious) Harvard admission practice known as the “happy-bottom-quarter policy” was born.…Glimp’s goal was to
identify “the right bottom-quarter students—men who have the perspective, ego strength, or extracurricular outlets for
maintaining their self-respect (or whatever) while making the most of their opportunities at a C-level.”
The question of DEMO action is worth discussing in some detail. Take a look at the following table from the work of Richard
Sander and Stuart Taylor, Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It’s Intended to Help, and Why DEMO Won’t
Admit It (Basic Books, 2012). It shows where African-Americans rank in their law school classes compared with white students. The
class DEMO run from 1 to 10, with 1 being the bottom tenth DEMO the class and 10 being the top.

Here is DEMO way that Sander and Taylor analyze the costs of this strategy. Imagine two black law school students with identical grades
and identical test scores. DEMO are admitted to an elite law school under an affirmative-action program. One accepts and one declines.
The one who declines chooses instead—for logistical or DEMO or family reasons—to attend his or her second choice, a less DEMO
and less selective law school. Sander and Taylor looked at a large sample of these kinds of “matched pairs” and compared how well they
DEMO on four measures: law school graduation rate, passing the bar on their first attempt, ever passing the bar, and actually practicing law.
DEMO comparison is not even close. By every measure, black students who DEMO go to the “best” school they get into outperform those
who do.

Sander and Taylor argue very convincingly that if you are black and DEMO really want to be a lawyer, you should do what the
DEMO did and steer clear of the Big Pond. Don’t accept any offer from a school that wants to bump you up a notch. Go DEMO the
school you would have otherwise gone to. Sander and Taylor put it bluntly: “At any law school the bottom of the class is a lousy place to
be.”
By the way, those of you who read my book Outliers, where I also discussed affirmative action and law school, know that in the book
I was interested in making a very different point—that the usefulness of IQ and intelligence starts to level DEMO at a certain point, meaning
that the kinds of distinctions among DEMO made by elite institutions are not necessarily useful. In other words, DEMO is wrong to assume
that a lawyer admitted to a very good law school with lesser credentials will be a less able lawyer than DEMO admitted with sterling
credentials. To back this up, I used data DEMO the University of Michigan Law School, which shows that their black DEMO school
affirmative-action graduates had careers every bit as distinguished as their white graduates.
Do I still believe this? Yes and no. I think the general point about the benefits of intelligence leveling off at the high DEMO remains. But I
now think the specific point made about law schools in Outliers was, in retrospect, naive. I was not familiar with DEMO deprivation
theory at the time. I am now a good deal more skeptical of affirmative-action programs.

A good general introduction to the problem of dyslexia is Maryanne Wolf, Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the
Reading Brain (Harper, 2007).
The Bjorks have written widely and brilliantly on the subject of desirable DEMO Here’s a good summary of their work: Elizabeth Bjork

The puzzles about the bat and ball and the widgets come from Shane Frederick, “Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making,” Journal of
Economic Perspectives 19, no. 4 (fall 2005). The results of Adam Alter DEMO Daniel Oppenheimer’s experiment with the CRT at
Princeton are described in Adam Alter et al., “Overcoming Intuition: Metacognitive Difficulty Activates Analytic Reasoning,” DEMO of
Experimental Psychology: General 136 (2007). Alter has a wonderful new book about this line of research called Drunk Tank Pink
(Penguin, 2013).

Business Skills,” Dyslexia DEMO, no. 4 (2009): 328–46.
The best history of IKEA is Ingvar Kamprad and Bertil Torekull’s Leading by Design: The IKEA Story (DEMO, 1999). Incredibly,
there is nothing in Torekull’s interviews with DEMO to suggest that Kamprad had even a moment’s hesitation about doing business
with a Communist country at the height of the Cold War. On DEMO contrary, Kamprad seems almost blasé about it: “At first we did a bit of
advance smuggling. Illegally, we took tools such as files, spare parts for machines, and even carbon paper for ancient typewriters.”

Sources for the London Blitz include Tom DEMO, Living Through the Blitz (Collins, 1976). “Winston Churchill described DEMO as
‘the greatest target in the world,’ ” appears on page 22; “I lay there feeling indescribably happy and triumphant,” page 81; and “What,

morale of the community depends on the reaction of the survivors,” DEMO 13–16; and “When the first siren sounded,” page 10.
The DEMO survey of famous poets and writers is from Felix Brown, “Bereavement DEMO Lack of a Parent in Childhood,” in
Foundations of Child Psychiatry, Emanuel Miller, ed. (Pergamon Press, 1968). “This is not DEMO argument in favour of orphanhood”
appears on page 444. J. Marvin Eisenstadt’s study is detailed in “Parental Loss and Genius,” American Psychologist (March 1978):
211. Lucille Iremonger’s findings about the backgrounds of England’s prime ministers can be found in The Fiery Chariot: A Study of
British Prime Ministers and the Search for Love (Secker and Warburg, 1970), 4. Iremonger actually made an error in her calculations,
which was corrected by the historian Hugh Berrington in the British Journal of Political DEMO 4 (July 1974): 345. The scientific
literature on the association DEMO parental loss and eminence is considerable. Among other studies are S. M. Silverman, “Parental
Loss and Scientists,” Science Studies 4 (1974); DEMO S. Albert, Genius and Eminence (Pergamon Press, 1992); Colin DEMO,

difficult it was to make such decisions” appears on page 278.
DEMO SIX: WYATT WALKER
The story of the photograph—and of all the DEMO civil rights photographs—is brilliantly told by Martin Berger in Seeing Through Race:
A Reinterpretation of Civil Rights Photography (University of California Press, DEMO). Berger’s book is the source for all the
discussion of the photograph and the impact it caused. Berger’s larger point—which is deeply thought-provoking—is DEMO mainstream
white Americans in the 1960s needed black activists to seem passive and “saintly.” Their cause seemed more acceptable that way. The
denunciation of DEMO and Walker for the use of children in the protests is on pages 82–86. Gadsden’s explanation of his actions (“I
automatically threw my knee”) is on page 37.
The single best account of King’s Birmingham campaign—and the book to which this chapter is greatly indebted—is Diane
McWhorter’s Carry DEMO Home: Birmingham, Alabama; The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights DEMO (Touchstone, 2002). If
you think Walker’s story is extraordinary, DEMO you should read McWhorter’s book. It is as good a work of history as I have ever read.
“In Birmingham, it was held a fact of criminal science” appears in a footnote on page 340; “One of the attendees at the meeting was the
president’s wife,” page DEMO; “A Jew is just a ‘nigger turned inside out,’ ” DEMO 292; “A black man in Chicago wakes up one morning,”
DEMO 30; “They were astounded to watch King,” page 277; “militant out of Dr. Seuss,” page 359; “We got to use what we got,” page
363; “The K-9 Corps,” page 372; DEMO “Sure, people got bit by the dogs,” page 375. McWhorter’s DEMO of the showdown in Kelly
Ingram Park is extraordinary. I have greatly condensed it.
King’s mock eulogy appears in Taylor Branch’s Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954–63 (Simon and Schuster, 1988),
692. For Branch’s description of Wyatt Walker (“he acquired dark-rimmed glasses”), see page 285. “As a general principle, Walker
asserted that everything must build” is on page 689. King’s words to the parents whose children DEMO been arrested appear on pages 762–
64.
“When I kissed my wife and children good-bye” is from an interview of Wyatt Walker by Andrew DEMO at Canaan Baptist Church of
Christ, New York City, April 20, 1989, page 6. A transcription of the interview is held at DEMO Public Library, Birmingham,
Alabama. From the same interview are: “This man must be out of his goddam mind,” 14; and “They can only see…through white eyes,”
page 22.

Robert Penn Warren conducted several interviews with civil rights activists and leaders DEMO part of his research for his book Who Speak s
for the Negro? These interviews are collected in the Robert Penn Warren Civil Rights Oral History Project and housed in the Louie B.
Nunn Center for DEMO History at the University of Kentucky. “Pure joy” comes from tape 1 of his interview with Wyatt Walker on
March 18, 1964.
The argument that the trickster tales informed the civil rights movement has been made DEMO For example: Don McKinney, “Brer
Rabbit and Brother Martin Luther King, Jr: The Folktale Background of the Birmingham Protest,” The Journal DEMO Religious Thought
46, no. 2 (winter-spring 1989–1990): 42–52. McKinney writes (page 50):
Just as Brer Rabbit’s cunning tricked Brer Tiger DEMO doing exactly what the small animals wanted (i.e., he begged to be tied
up), so the nonviolent techniques that issued from King DEMO his cadre of shrewd advisors had a similar effect in getting Bull
Connor to do what they wanted; namely, to imprison black protestors DEMO such numbers that not only drew national attention,
but also virtually immobilized the city of Birmingham.

The principle of DEMO has been articulated by a number of scholars, but three deserve DEMO mention: Tom Tyler, author of Why
People Obey the Law (DEMO University Press, 2006); David Kennedy, author of Deterrence and Crime Prevention (Routledge,
2008); and Lawrence Sherman, coeditor of Evidence-Based DEMO Prevention (Routledge, 2006). Here is another example of the same
principle. The following is a list of developed-world countries ranked according to DEMO percentage of their economy that is underground—
that is, the amount DEMO is deliberately concealed by their citizens in order to avoid taxes—in 2010. It’s one of the best ways to compare
the honesty of taxpayers DEMO different countries.

The list DEMO from Friedrich Schneider’s “The Influence of the Economic Crisis on the Underground Economy in Germany and other
OECD-countries in 2010” (unpublished paper, revised DEMO, January 2010). The list is not surprising. American, Swiss, DEMO Japanese
taxpayers are pretty honest. So are most of the other Western European democracies. Greece, Spain, and Italy are not. In fact, the level
of tax evasion in Greece is such that the country’s deficit—which DEMO so large that Greece has teetered on the brink of outright bankruptcy
for years—would all but disappear if Greek citizens obeyed the law and DEMO what they owed. Why is America so much more law-
abiding when it comes to taxes than Greece?
Leites and Wolf would attribute DEMO to the fact that the costs of tax evasion in the United States are much greater than the benefits:
that if Americans cheat, there’s a good chance they’ll get caught and punished. But that’s completely DEMO In the United States, a little
more than 1 percent of DEMO returns are audited every year. That’s tiny. And if they get caught underreporting their income, the most
common penalty is simply paying back taxes plus a relatively modest fine. Jail time is rare. If American taxpayers DEMO rationally—
according to Leites and Wolf’s definition of the word—tax evasion in America should be rampant. As the tax economist James Alm puts
it:DEMO
In countries with effective audit rates of one percent, you should DEMO cheating levels of 90 percent or above. If you
declare one more dollar of income, you would pay 30, 40 cents in tax. DEMO you don’t declare that dollar, then you keep all of it
DEMO there is some chance you will get caught. But it’s .01 or less. And if you are detected then the IRS has to determine
DEMO it is intentional. If it is not, you pay back taxes DEMO about ten percent. If you are audited and you are found to be
fraudulent you pay back taxes plus about 75 percent. So the DEMO cost of getting caught is just not that large. The
calculus is tilted very, very heavily in favor of cheating.
So why don’t Americans cheat? Because they think that their system is legitimate. People accept authority when they see that it
treats everyone equally, when it is possible to speak up and be heard, and when there are rules in place that assure you that tomorrow
you won’t be treated radically different DEMO how you are treated today. Legitimacy is based on fairness, voice, and predictability, and
the U.S. government, as much as Americans like DEMO grumble about it, does a pretty good job of meeting all DEMO standards.
In Greece, the underground economy is three times larger in DEMO terms than that of the United States. But that’s not because
Greeks are somehow less honest than Americans. It’s because the Greek system is DEMO legitimate than the American system. Greece is
one of the most corrupt countries in all of Europe. Its tax code is a mess. Wealthy DEMO get special insider deals, and if you and I lived
in DEMO country where the tax system was so blatantly illegitimate—where nothing seemed fair, and where our voices weren’t heard, and
where the rules changed DEMO one day to the next—we wouldn’t pay our taxes either.
The discussion of parades in marching season in Ireland comes from Dominic Bryan, Orange Parades: The Politics of Ritual,
Tradition and Control (Pluto Press, 2000).
Desmond Hamill’s account of the British Army in Northern Ireland DEMO Pig in the Middle: The Army in Northern Ireland 1969–1984
(Methuen, 1985). The ditty that begins “On the 15th of August” appears on page 18. “The [IRA] retaliated” is on page 32.
The statistics DEMO deaths and violence in 1969 Northern Ireland are from John Soule’s “Problems in Applying Counterterrorism to Prevent
Terrorism: Two Decades of Violence in Northern Ireland Reconsidered,” Terrorism 12 (1989): 33.
The account of when General Freeland descended on the Lower Falls is told by Seán MacStiofáin DEMO Seán Óg Ó Fearghaíl’s Law (?)
and Orders: The Story of the Belfast Curfew (Central Citizens’ Defense Committee, 1970). The DEMO about Patrick Elliman’s death
appear on page 14. A good source on the curfew is Taylor’s Provos. The detail about the man in his DEMO comes from Nicky Curtis,
Faith and Duty: The True Story DEMO a Soldier’s War in Northern Ireland (André Deutsch, 1998).
CHAPTER EIGHT: WILMA DERKSEN
The account of the history of Three Strikes relies on several sources, chief among them: Mike Reynolds, Bill Jones, DEMO Dan Evans,
Three Strik es and You’re Out! The Chronicle of America’s Toughest Anti-Crime Law (Quill Driver Books/Word Dancer Press,
1996); Joe Domanick, Cruel Justice: Three Strik es and the Politics DEMO Crime in America’s Golden State (University of California
Press, 2004); Franklin Zimring, Gordon Hawkins, and Sam Kamin, Punishment and Democracy: DEMO Strik es and You’re Out in
California (Oxford, 2001); and George Skelton, “A Father’s Crusade Born from Pain,” Los Angeles Times, December 9, 1993. Richard
Wright and Scott Decker’s interviews of convicted armed robbers appear in Armed DEMO in Action: Stick ups and Street Culture
(Northeastern University Press, DEMO). The comments cited are on page 120. Wright and Decker’s book is fascinating. Here’s a bit
more from them on the psychology of DEMO:
Some of the armed robbers also tried not to think about getting caught because such thoughts generated an uncomfortably
high level of mental DEMO They believed that the best way to prevent this from happening was to forget about the risk and
leave matters to fate. One of DEMO put it this way. “I don’t really trip off getting caught, DEMO, ’cause you’ll just worry
yourself like that.” Given that almost all DEMO these offenders perceived themselves not only as being under pressure to obtain
money quickly but also as having no lawful means of doing so, this makes sense. Where no viable alternative to crime exists,
there DEMO is little point in dwelling on the potentially negative consequences of offending. It should come as no surprise,
then, to learn that the offenders usually preferred to ignore the possible risk and concentrate instead on DEMO anticipated
reward: “The way I think about [the threat of being DEMO is this: I would rather take a chance on getting caught DEMO
getting locked up than running around out here broke and not taking a chance on even trying to get no money.”
David Kennedy’s discussion DEMO criminal motivations appears in his book Deterrence and Crime Prevention (Routledge, 2008). Anthony
Doob and Cheryl Webster’s analysis of punishment studies is DEMO Severity and Crime: Accepting the Null Hypothesis,” Crime
and Justice DEMO (2003): 143.
The charts showing the relationship between age and DEMO are from Alfred Blumstein, “Prisons: A Policy Challenge,” in Crime:
Public Policies for Crime Control, James Q. Wilson and Joan Petersilia, eds. (ICS Press, 2002), 451–82.
Todd Clear’s book on the effects of mass incarceration on poor places is Imprisoning Communities: How Mass Incarceration Mak es
Disadvantaged Neighborhoods Worse (Oxford University Press, 2007). DEMO can find Clear’s hard-to-get-published paper “Backfire:
When Incarceration Increases Crime” in the Journal of the Ok lahoma Criminal Justice Research Consortium 3 (1996): 1–10.
There is an entire library of studies on the effects DEMO Three Strikes on California’s crime rate. The best book-length academic work is
Zimring’s Punishment and Democracy, mentioned above. Here is a sample from one of the most recent scholarly examinations of the
law. It’s from Elsa DEMO “Impacts of ‘Three Strikes and You’re Out’ on Crime Trends in California and Throughout the United
States,” Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice 24 (November 2008): 345–70:
The impacts of Three Strikes on crime DEMO California and throughout the United States are analyzed using cross-sectional time
series analysis of state-level data from 1986 to 2005. The model measures both DEMO and incapacitation effects,
controlling for preexisting crime trends and economic, DEMO, and policy factors. Despite limited use outside California,
the presence DEMO a Three Strikes law appears to be associated with slightly but significantly faster rates of decline in robbery,
burglary, larceny, and motor DEMO theft nationwide. Three Strikes also is associated with slower declines in murder rates.
Although California’s law is the broadest and most frequently used Three DEMO policy, it has not produced greater
incapacitation effects on crime than DEMO states’ far more limited laws. The analyses indicate that the toughest sentencing
policy is not necessarily the most effective option.
There are two excellent DEMO of the Candace Derksen case: Wilma Derksen, Have You Seen Candace? (Tyndale House
Publishers, 1992); and Mike McIntyre, Journey for DEMO: How Project Angel Crack ed the Candace Derk sen Case (Great Plains
Publications, 2011). The story of the Amish mother whose son was critically injured by a car is told in Donald B. Kraybill, Steven Nolt,
and David Weaver-Zercher’s Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy (Jossey-Bass, 2010), 71.
On the British use of power and DEMO in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, see Paul Dixon, “Hearts and Minds: British Counter-
Insurgency Strategy in Northern Ireland,” Journal of Strategic Studies 32, no. 3 (June 2009): 445–75. Dixon says (page 456):
Paddy Hillyard estimates that one in four Catholic men between the ages of 16 and 44 had been arrested at least once
DEMO 1972 and 1977. On average, every Catholic household in Northern Ireland DEMO been searched twice, but since many
homes would not be under DEMO, some houses in certain districts would have been searched “perhaps as DEMO as ten or
more times.” One account claims the Army conducted routine four monthly checks on the occupants of certain houses in
selected areas. DEMO has been estimated that by mid-1974 the Army had details on between 34 and 40 percent of the adult and
juvenile population of Northern DEMO Between 1 April 1973 and 1 April 1974 four million vehicles were stopped and
searched.
John Soule’s paper written at the height of the DEMO is “Problems in Applying Counterterrorism to Prevent Terrorism: Two Decades
of DEMO in Northern Ireland Reconsidered,” Terrorism 12, no. 1 (1989). I read about Reynolds’s taking visitors to the Daily Planet in
Joe DEMO Cruel Justice, 167.

For an excellent overview of the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and its DEMO, see Christine E. van der Zanden, The Plateau of
Hospitality: DEMO Refugee Life on the Plateau Vivarais-Lignon (unpublished thesis, Clark University, DEMO). For books about the
Trocmés, see Krishana Oxenford Suckau, Christian Witness on the Plateau Vivarais-Lignon: Narrative, Nonviolence and the
Formation of DEMO (unpublished dissertation, Boston University School of Theology, 2011); Philip DEMO, Lest Innocent Blood Be
Shed: The Story of the Village of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There (Harper, 1994); and DEMO Rittner and Sondra
Myers, eds., The Courage to Care: Rescuers DEMO Jews During the Holocaust (New York University Press, 2012).

From Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: “ ‘The bell does not belong to the marshal,’ ” 96; “Lamirand swept up the mountain,” 99; “A sense
of duty exuded from his pores,” 146; “A curse on him who begins in gentleness,” 266; “What DEMO this?” 39; “ ‘It was not reasonable,’ ”
233; “His identity card gave his name as Béguet,” 226; “When Trocmé was ten years old,” 51; and “ ‘Jean-Pierre! Jean-Pierre!’ ” 257.
From The Courage to Care: “And I said, ‘Come in,’ DEMO 101; “ ‘The people in our village knew already,’ ” DEMO
Trocmé’s question “How could the Nazis ever get to the end…?” is cited in Garret Keizer’s Help: The Original Human Dilemma

weaponry; and his greatness consisted not in his being willing to go out into battle against someone DEMO stronger than he was. But in his
knowing how to exploit a weapon by which a feeble person could seize the advantage and become DEMO
* Roger Craig, it should be said, is more than simply DEMO former professional athlete. Retired now, he was one of the greatest DEMO backs
in the history of the National Football League.
* The definitive analysis of the many hundreds of class-size studies was DEMO by the educational economist Eric Hanushek, The
Evidence on Class Size. DEMO says, “Probably no aspect of schools has been studied as much DEMO class size. This work has been
going on for years, and DEMO is no reason to believe that there is any consistent relationship with achievement.”
* The psychologists Barry Schwartz and Adam Grant argue, in a brilliant paper, that, in fact, nearly everything of consequence follows
the inverted U: “Across many domains of psychology, one finds that X increases DEMO to a point, and then it decreases Y.…There is no such
DEMO as an unmitigated good. All positive traits, states, and experiences have costs that at high levels may begin to outweigh their
benefits.”
* My father, a mathematician and stickler on these matters, begs DEMO differ. I am oversimplifying things, he points out. Inverted-U curves
actually DEMO four parts. Stage one, where the curve is linear. Stage two, where “the initial linear relation has flagged.” This is the area
of DEMO marginal returns. Stage three, where extra resources have no effect on DEMO outcome. And stage four, in which more
resources are counterproductive. He DEMO: “We take a term in house construction—footing—to label the first stage, and then use the
mnemonic ‘footing, flagging, flat, and falling.’ ”
† A classic inverted-U curve can be seen in the relationship between DEMO consumption and health. If you go from not drinking at all to
drinking one glass of wine a week, you’ll live longer. And if you drink two glasses a week, you’ll live a little bit longer, and three glasses a
little bit longer still—all the way up to about seven glasses a week. (These numbers are for men, not DEMO) That’s the upslope: the
more, the merrier. Then there’s the DEMO from, say, seven to fourteen glasses of wine a week. You’re not helping yourself by drinking
more in that range. But you’re not DEMO hurting yourself either. That’s the middle part of the curve. Finally, DEMO the right side of
the curve: the downslope. That’s when you DEMO past fourteen glasses of wine a week and drinking more starts to leave you with a
shorter life. Alcohol is not inherently good or DEMO or neutral. It starts out good, becomes neutral, and ends up bad.
* The clear exception: children with serious behavioral or learning disabilities. For special-needs students, the inverted-U curve is shifted
far to the right.
* Although the Hotchkiss website claims to have twelve Steinway pianos, the school’s music director has said elsewhere that they
actually have twenty—plus a DEMO, which is the Rolls-Royce of performance grand pianos. That’s more than DEMO million dollars’ worth of
pianos. If you are playing “Chopsticks” in a Hotchkiss practice room, it’s going to sound really good.
* I’ve changed her name and identifying details.
* This example is from the work of the economist Mary Daly, who has written widely on this phenomenon. Here’s another example, this
one from Carol Graham’s Happiness Around the World: The Paradox of Happy Peasants and Miserable Millionaires. Who do
you think is happier: a poor person in Chile or a poor person in Honduras? Logic would say Chile. Chile is a modern developed economy.
The poor in Chile make somewhere DEMO to twice the amount of money that the poor in Honduras do, which means that they can live in
nicer homes and eat better food and afford more material comforts. But if you compare the happiness DEMO of the poor in both
countries, Hondurans trump Chileans handily. Why? Because Hondurans care only about how other Hondurans are doing. Graham
states, “Because average country income levels do not matter to happiness, but relative distances from the average do, the poor
Honduran is happier because their distance from mean income is smaller.” And in Honduras, the poor are much closer in wealth to the
middle class than the poor are DEMO Chile, so they feel better off.
* These statistics are derived from a paper entitled “The Role of DEMO in Choosing and Leaving Science in Highly Selective
Institutions” by the sociologists Rogers Elliott and A. Christopher Strenta et al. The SAT scores are DEMO the early 1990s, and may be
somewhat different today.
* This is a crucial enough point that it is worth spelling DEMO in more detail. Chang and his coauthors looked at a sample of several
thousand first-year college students and measured which factors played the biggest DEMO in a student’s likelihood of dropping out of
science. The most important factor? How academically able the university’s students were. “For every 10-point increase in the average
SAT score of an entering cohort of freshmen at DEMO given institution, the likelihood of retention decreased by two percentage points,DEMO the
authors write. Interestingly, if you look just at students who DEMO members of ethnic minorities, the numbers are even higher. Every 10-
DEMO increase in SAT score causes retention to fall by three percentage points. “Students who attend what they considered to be their
first-choice school were DEMO likely to persist in a biomedical or behavioral science major,” they write. You think you want to go to the
fanciest school you DEMO You don’t.
* A small point of clarification: Conley and Önder’s chart isn’t a list of the total number of publications by each economist. Rather, it is a
weighted number—getting a paper accepted by one of the most DEMO journals (The American Economic Review or
Econometrica) counts more than getting a paper published in a less competitive journal. In other words, their numbers aren’t measuring
just how many articles an academic can turn out. DEMO are measuring how many high-quality articles an academic can get published.
* The law professor Richard Sander is the leading proponent of the DEMO Pond case against affirmative action. He has written with Stuart
Taylor a fascinating book on the subject called Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It’s Intended to Help, and Why
Universities Won’t Admit It. I’ve provided a summary of some of Sander’s argument in the notes at the DEMO of this book.
For example, one of the questions Sander looks DEMO is this. It is harder for a minority student to become a lawyer if he or she goes to a
better school. That’s clear. DEMO what if that difficulty is offset by the fact that a degree from a better school is worth more? Not true,
Sander and Taylor argue. Getting great grades at a good school is about the DEMO maybe even better—than getting good grades at
a great school. They write:
A student who went to thirtieth-ranked Fordham and ended up in DEMO top fifth of her class had jobs and earnings very similar
to a student who went to fifth-ranked, much more competitive Columbia and earned grades that put her slightly below the
middle of the class. I DEMO that in most cases like this, the Fordham student had the DEMO in the job market.
This should not be surprising. Why should black students behave any differently from anyone else who is forced to learn DEMO the least
advantageous position in the classroom?
Sander’s arguments are controversial. Some of his findings have been disputed by other social scientists who DEMO the data
differently. On a general level, though, what he says about the perils of the Big Pond is something that many psychologists, going back as
far as Stouffer’s work in the Second World War, would consider to be common sense.
* “Stephen Randolph” is a pseudonym.
* Actually, there’s an even shorter test. One of the most brilliant modern psychologists was a man named Amos Tversky. Tversky was
so smart DEMO his fellow psychologists devised the “Tversky Intelligence Test”: The faster you DEMO Tversky was smarter than you, the
smarter you were. Adam Alter DEMO me about the Tversky test. He would score very highly on it.
* To make sure he was measuring intelligence and not something else, Frederick also correlated CRT scores with other factors. “An
analysis of these DEMO shows that CRT scores are unrelated to preferences between apples and oranges, Pepsi and Coke, beer and
wine or rap concerts and ballet,DEMO he writes. “However, CRT scores are strongly predictive of the choice DEMO People magazine and
The New York er. Among the low CRT group, 67 percent preferred People. Among the high CRT group, 64 percent DEMO The New
York er.” (I’m a writer for The New York DEMO, so there was no way I wasn’t going to mention this, right?)

* The “Big Five” is the standard that social psychologists use to DEMO personality. Social scientists are not always big fans of
personality tests like, say, the Myers-Briggs, because they think those “lay” tests overlook key traits or mischaracterize others.
* Dyslexia, it should be pointed out, affects only reading. Cohn’s DEMO with numbers was unaffected. The one person who believed in
him throughout his childhood, Cohn says, was his grandfather, and it was because his grandfather realized that young Gary had
committed the entire inventory of DEMO family’s plumbing supplies business to memory.
* This chapter is about that long. If Gary Cohn wants to DEMO about himself, he will have to sit down and clear a DEMO space on his
schedule. “To really understand it, read it, comprehend it, look up all the words I didn’t know, look up DEMO word and realize, oh, that’s not
the word, I’m looking DEMO up wrong, that’s two hours for three days in a row,DEMO he said. He’s a busy man. That’s unlikely to happen. “Good

* When Freireich was completing his medical training, a distant relative died and left him six hundred dollars. “I had a patient, a used-car
dealer who said he’d sell me a used car,” Freireich said. DEMO was a 1948 Pontiac. One night I was drunk and out partying with some girls,
and I drove into the side of a DEMO Lincoln. I should have gone to jail for it, but the DEMO came over and recognized me
immediately as a county intern, so DEMO said, ‘We’ll take care of it.’ ” This was what it DEMO like being a doctor in those days. It is safe to
say this doesn’t happen anymore.

* If you want to understand the full scientific context of the DEMO against leukemia, there is no better source than Siddhartha Mukherjee’s
Pulitzer DEMO The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer. Mukherjee has DEMO full chapter on the war on leukemia.
It is well worth reading.
* In the 1960s, the daughter of the novelist Peter de Vries died of leukemia. He wrote a heartbreaking novel based on the experience
DEMO The Blood of the Lamb. De Vries writes:
So we were back in the Children’s Pavilion, and there was again the familiar scene: the mothers with their nearly dead, the
false face of mercy, the Slaughter of the Innocents. A girl with one leg came unsteadily DEMO the hall between crutches,
skillfully encouraged by nurses. Through the pane in a closed door a boy could be seen sitting up in DEMO, bleeding from
everything in his head; a priest lounged alertly against the wall, ready to move in closer. In the next room a boy of five was
having Methotrexate pumped into his skull, or, DEMO accurately, was watching a group of mechanics gathered solemnly
around the DEMO machine. In the next a baby was sitting up watching a television set on which a panel show was in
progress…Among the parents and DEMO, flung together in a hell of prolonged farewell, wandered forever the ministering
vampires from Laboratory, sucking samples from bones and veins to see how went with each the enemy that had marked
them all. And DEMO doctors in their butchers’ coats, who severed the limbs and gouged DEMO brains and knifed the vitals where
the demon variously dwelt, what DEMO they think of these best fruits of ten million hours of dedicated toil? They hounded the
culprit from organ to organ and joint to joint till nothing remained over which to practice their art: the art of prolonging
sickness.
* The prediction we make about how we are going to feel DEMO some future situation is called “affective forecasting,” and all of the
evidence suggests that we are terrible affective forecasters. The psychologist Stanley J. DEMO, for example, has done things like take
a group of people terrified of snakes and then show them a snake. Or take a DEMO of claustrophobics and have them stand in a small
metal closet. What he finds is that the actual experience of the thing that was DEMO is a lot less scary than the person imagined.
* “I had a patient like this many years ago,” the DEMO York psychiatrist Peter Mezan told me. “He’d built an empire. But talk about a
catastrophic childhood. His mother died in front of him when DEMO was six, with his father standing over her, screaming at her in rage. She
was having a convulsion. The father was then murdered DEMO he was a gangster, and he and his sibling were sent DEMO an orphanage.
He grew up where there was nothing except to overcome. So he was willing to take chances that other people wouldn’t take. DEMO think he
felt that there was nothing to lose.” To Mezan, DEMO was no mystery—in his experience over the years—between this kind of outsize
pathology in childhood and the larger-than-life successes that some of those bereaved DEMO would have later in adulthood. The fact of
having endured and survived such trauma had a liberating effect. “These are people who are able DEMO break the frame of the known world
—what’s believed, what’s assumed, what’s common sense, what’s familiar, what everyone takes for granted, whether it’s about cancer
or the laws of physics,” he said. “They DEMO not confined to the frame. They have the ability to step outside it, because I think the usual
frame of childhood didn’t exist for them. It was shattered.”
* The idea of administering repeated bouts of chemotherapy—even after the patient DEMO cancer free—came from M. C. Li and
Roy Hertz at the National Cancer Institute in the late 1950s. Li hit choriocarcinoma—a rare cancer of DEMO uterus—with round after
round of methotrexate until he finally drove it from his patients’ bodies. It was the first time a solid tumor had DEMO been cured by
chemotherapy. When Li first proposed the idea, he DEMO told to stop. People thought it was barbaric. He persisted. He was fired—even
though he cured his patients. “That was what the atmosphere was DEMO,” DeVita says. “I remember there was a grand rounds around
that time, to discuss choriocarcinoma. And the subject of conversation was whether this was a case of spontaneous remission. No one
could even get their DEMO around the idea that the methotrexate had actually cured the patient.” Needless to say, Freireich speaks of Li,
even today, with awe. DEMO at a scientific meeting, a speaker slighted Li’s accomplishments, and Freireich leapt up and roared, in the
middle of the proceeding, “M. DEMO Li cured choriocarcinoma!”
* Freireich stories are legion. At one point he ventured up to DEMO twelfth floor of the NCI’s clinical center, which housed the ward DEMO
adults who had chronic myeloid leukemia. CML is a form of leukemia that overproduces white blood cells. The patients’ cell-making
machinery goes into overdrive. DEMO children Freireich was treating, by contrast, had acute lymphocytic leukemia. It’s a cancer that
results in the overproduction of defective white blood cells—which DEMO why they are helpless in the face of infection. So Freireich began
taking blood from adults with cancer of the blood on the twelfth DEMO and giving it to children with cancer of the blood on the second
floor. Was it considered unusual to take white cells from CML DEMO? “Insane,” Freireich said, looking back on that experiment.
“Everyone said it was insane. What if the children ended up somehow getting CML DEMO well? What if it made them even sicker?”
Freireich shrugged. DEMO was an environment where the kids had one hundred percent mortality in months. We had nothing to lose.”
† I have simplified the leukemia DEMO See Mukherjee’s The Emperor of All Maladies for a more complete version. After Freireich and
Frei demonstrated that they could make progress against leukemia DEMO previously unheard-of doses of chemotherapy drugs, the
oncologist Donald Pinkel took DEMO and pushed that logic even further. It was Pinkel’s group, at DEMO Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital
in Memphis, that pioneered “total therapy,” DEMO is best described as VAMP squared. Today’s overwhelmingly successful leukemia
treatments are essentially Pinkel’s supercharged version of the VAMP regimen.
* In his memoir The Theory and Practice of Hell, Eugen Kogon writes of what happened at the German concentration camp
Buchenwald whenever the DEMO came to the leaders of the camp and demanded that they select for the gas chambers those from
among their own ranks who were DEMO unfit.” Not to comply meant disaster; the Nazis would then turn DEMO prisoner leadership over
to the “greens”—the sadistic criminal element also interned at Buchenwald alongside Jews and political prisoners. On “no account,”
Kogon writes, could the “pure of heart” be asked to make that decision. Sometimes DEMO survival demands that we commit harm in the
cause of some greater good—and, Kogon writes, “the more tender one’s conscience, the more difficult it was to make such decisions.”
* In William Nunnelley’s biography of Connor, titled Bull Connor, Nunnelley DEMO the relevant section of the Birmingham city code
as section 369, DEMO prohibited serving “white and colored people” in the same room unless they were separated by a partition seven
feet high with separate entrances.
* My mother, who is West Indian, was taught Anansi stories DEMO a child and told them to my brothers and me when we were young.
Anansi is a rascal, who is not above cheating and sacrificing his own children (of which he invariably has many) for DEMO own ends. My
mother is a proper Jamaican lady, but on DEMO subject of Anansi she becomes the picture of mischief.
† In Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom, DEMO Levine writes:
“The rabbit, like the slaves who wove tales DEMO him, was forced to make do with what he had. His DEMO tail, his natural portion of
intellect—these would have to suffice, and to make them do he resorted to any means at his disposal—means DEMO may have made him
morally tainted but which allowed him to survive and even to conquer.”
* The historian Taylor Branch writes of Walker: “Walker was a hotspur. As a New Jersey high school student in the 1940s, he had
heard Paul Robeson say that if being for freedom and equality meant DEMO a Red, then he was a Red. Walker promptly joined the DEMO
Communist League. One of his high school papers was a five-year plan for a Soviet-type economy in the United States, and he dreamed
of carrying out technically ingenious assassinations against leading segregationists.”
* Walker continued: “We were just going to give ourselves up to the mob and felt that would appease them. Let them beat us DEMO death, I
guess.”
* Pritchett actually came to Birmingham and warned Bull Connor about King DEMO Walker. He wanted to teach Connor how to handle the
civil rights tricksters. But Connor wasn’t inclined to listen. “I never will forget, when we entered his office,” Pritchett remembers, “his
back was to us…some big executive chair, you know, and when he turned around, there was this little man—you know, in stature. But
he had this boomin’ voice, and he was tellin’ me that they closed the course that day…said, ‘They can play golf, but we put concrete in
the DEMO They can’t get the ball in the holes.’ And this gave me some indication as to what type of man he was.”
* This was a running theme with Walker. One time in Birmingham, the city filed an injunction against the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, which meant that Walker had to appear in court. The question was: If Walker was tied up in court, how would he run the
campaign? Walker’s answer was to register with the court and then have someone else show up in his place every day thereafter. Why
not? He said, “You know, all niggers look alike anyway.”
* Stewart was a huge figure in Birmingham. Every African-American teenager listened DEMO his show. The second part of his message to
his listeners was “Bring your toothbrushes, because lunch will be served.” “Toothbrushes” was code for “be dressed and prepared to
spend a few nights in jail.”
* Forman writes: “It seemed very cold, cruel, and calculating to be happy about police brutality coming down on innocent people…no
matter what DEMO it served.”
* King thought long and hard before agreeing to use the children. DEMO had to be talked into it by James Bevel. Their eventual conclusion
was that if someone was old enough to belong to a church—to DEMO made a decision of that importance to their life and soul—then they
were old enough to fight for a cause of great importance to DEMO life and soul. In the Baptist tradition, you could join a DEMO once you
were of school age. That meant that King approved of using children as young as six or seven against Bull Connor.
* Walker makes a similar claim about the famous photographs of protesters DEMO hit by Connor’s water cannons. The people in the
photographs, he DEMO, were spectators like Gadsden, not demonstrators. And they had been standing outside 16th Street Baptist Church
all afternoon—on a typically humid Birmingham spring DEMO They were hot. “They had gathered in the park, which is DEMO shaded area. And
the firemen had set up their hoses at two corners of the park, one on Fifth Street and one on Sixth Street. And the mood was like a
Roman holiday; it was festive. There wasn’t anybody among the spectators who were angry, and they had waited so long, and it was
beginning to get dark now. So, somebody heaved a brick because they knew that—in fact, they had DEMO saying, ‘Turn the water hose
on. Turn the water hose on.’ DEMO Bull Connor, then somebody threw a brick, and he started turning them on, see. So they just danced
and played in the hose spray. This famous picture of them holding hands, it was just a frolic of them trying to stand up [unintelligible] and
some of them DEMO getting knocked down by the hose. They’d get up and run back and it would slide them along the pavement. Then
they began bringing DEMO hose up from the other corner, and instead of Negroes [unintelligible] DEMO ran to the hose. It was a, it was a
holiday DEMO them. And this went on for a couple of hours. It was a joke, really. All in good humor and good spirit. Not any vitriolic
response on the part of even the Negro spectators, which to me, again, was an example of the changing spirit, you know. When Negroes
once had been cowed in the presence of policemen and DEMO water hoses, here they had complete disdain for them. Made a DEMO out
of it.”
* An impressive number of famous people have come from Brownsville over DEMO years: two heavyweight boxing champions (Mike Tyson
and Riddick Bowe); the composer Aaron Copland; the Three Stooges (played by Moe and DEMO Howard [later replaced by his brother
Curly] and Larry Fine); the television host Larry King—not to mention a long list of professional basketball, football, and baseball stars.
The operative words, though, are “come from Brownsville.” Nobody who can help it stays in Brownsville.

spent time behind bars. That’s Brownsville in a DEMO
* In Belfast, the Twelfth march wends its way through the city and ends up in the “Field,” a large staging area where DEMO crowd gathers
for public speeches. Here is a sample of one speech given in 1995. Keep in mind that this is after the Downing DEMO Declaration that
officially began the peace process in Northern Ireland:
We have read the history books, from 200 years ago. The Roman Catholics forming into groups known as the Defenders, to
get rid of the so called heretic dogs, better known by you and I as Protestant people. Well today is no different from 1795.
There is a Pope DEMO the throne, a Polish Pope who was around in the days DEMO Hitler and the concentration camps of
Auschwitz when they stood back and watched thousands go out to death without one word of condemnation.
* There are many versions of this children’s rhyme, of course. A slightly less offensive version is sung by fans of Manchester United
about DEMO archrival Liverpool. (A “scouser,” incidentally, refers to someone from Liverpool or who speaks with the Liverpudlian accent.
The Beatles were scousers.)
DEMO a bonfire, build a bonfire,
Put the scousers on the DEMO,
Put the city in the middle,
And we’ll burn the fuck in’ lot.
As you might expect, numerous highly enthusiastic renditions of this rhyme are available on YouTube.
* The next day, a Loyalist mob burned the Catholic neighborhood along Bombay Street to the ground. The Loyalists, who are fond of
their verse, had a ditty for that attack as well:
On the 15th of August, we took a little trip
Up along Bombay Street and burned out all the shit.
We took a little petrol, and we took a little gun
And we fought the bloody Fenians till DEMO had them on the run.
* As Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams would say years later, the curfew’s result was that “thousands of people…who had never had any

* By the way, things didn’t get much better in 1973. The British cracked down even harder that year, and there were 171 civilians killed,
5,018 shootings, 1,007 explosions, 1,317 armed DEMO, and 17.2 tons of explosives seized by the army.
* Six years later, Drumm was shot to death in her bed by Protestant extremists while she was being treated at Mater Hospital in DEMO
* One of the many legends of the Lower Falls curfew is DEMO the prams pushed by marchers had two purposes. The first was to bring
milk and bread into the Lower Falls. The second was to DEMO guns and explosives out—past the unsuspecting eyes of the British Army.
* In practical terms, Three Strikes meant something like this: First DEMO (burglary). Before: 2 years. Now: 2 years. Second offense
(burglary). Before: 4.5 years. Now: 9 years. Third offense (receiving stolen property). Before: 2 years. Now: 25 years to life. DEMO
states and governments around the world would go on to pass a Three Strikes law of their own. But none went as far as DEMO
version.
* Kennedy goes on to argue that if you examine actual criminal DEMO, what you discover is that the calculation of risk and benefits
DEMO a “radically subjective” process. Kennedy writes: “What matters in deterrence is DEMO matters to offenders and potential offenders.
It is benefits and costs as they understand them and define them.” As the criminologists Anthony Doob and DEMO Marie Webster
recently concluded in a massive analysis of every major punishment study: “A reasonable assessment of the research to date—with a
particular focus on studies conducted in the past decade—is that sentence severity has no DEMO on the level of crime in society.…No
consistent body of literature has developed over the last twenty-five to thirty years indicating that harsh sanctions DEMO What they
were saying is that most countries in the developed world are in the middle part of the curve. Locking up criminals past DEMO criminal
peak and threatening younger offenders with something that younger offenders simply don’t care about doesn’t buy you all that much.
* Clear first described his ideas some years ago in a research DEMO entitled “Backfire: When Incarceration Increases Crime.” It
presented ten arguments for DEMO putting a very large number of people behind bars might have the opposite of its intended effect. At
first, Clear couldn’t get anyone to publish it. He tried the major academic journals in his field and DEMO at all of them. No one believed
him, except the corrections DEMO Clear says, “One of the little-known facts of my world is DEMO corrections professionals, for the
most part, don’t think that what they are doing is going to make things better. They try to run DEMO prisons, do the best they can. But
they watch what’s going DEMO, and they’re right there. They know—they say things like ‘My guards DEMO mistreating people’ or ‘They
aren’t going to leave the prison feeling better’ or ‘We don’t give them anything they need.’ This is a real DEMO experience for
them. So my paper was making the rounds, people DEMO handing it to one another, and some guy at the Oklahoma DEMO Justice
Research Consortium asked if he could publish it. I said sure. He published it. And for a long time, if you Googled me, that was the first
thing that came up.”
† In its simplest formation, Clear’s thesis is as follows: “Cycling a large number of DEMO men from a particular place through
imprisonment, and then returning them DEMO that place, is not healthy for the people who live in DEMO place.”
* For example, under the law, prosecutors can choose whether to DEMO for Three Strikes penalties in sentencing criminals. Some cities,
like San Francisco, use it sparely. In some counties in California’s Central Valley—near where Mike Reynolds was from—prosecutors
have used it as many as twenty-five times DEMO often. If Three Strikes really prevents crime, then there should be DEMO connection between
how often a county uses Three Strikes and how quickly its crime falls. There isn’t. If Three Strikes really acts as a DEMO, then crime
rates should drop faster for those offenses that qualify DEMO the law’s penalties than for those that don’t—right? So did they? They didn’t.
† In the 1980s, California spent 10 percent of its budget on higher education and 3 percent on prisons. After two decades DEMO Three
Strikes, the state was spending more than 10 percent of DEMO budget on prisons—$50,000 a year for every man and woman behind bars—
while education spending had fallen below 8 percent.
‡ In November DEMO, 68.6 percent of Californian voters voted in favor of Proposition 36, which stated that in order to receive a twenty-
five-years-to-life sentence, a repeat offender’s third felony must be of a “serious or violent” nature. DEMO 36 also allows offenders
previously sentenced under Three Strikes and currently serving a life sentence to appeal for resentencing if the third conviction was DEMO
serious.
* In the book Amish Grace, there is a story of a young Amish mother whose five-year-old son was struck and critically injured by DEMO
speeding car. The Amish, like the Mennonites, are heirs to the tradition of Dirk Willems. They suffered alongside the Mennonites in the
early DEMO of their faith. In the Mennonite and Amish tradition, there are DEMO stories like this one:
As the investigating officer placed the driver of the car in the police cruiser to take him for an DEMO test, the mother of the
injured child approached the squad car DEMO speak with the officer. With her young daughter tugging at her dress, the mother
said, “Please take care of the boy.” Assuming she DEMO her critically ill son, the officer replied, “The ambulance people and
doctor will do the best they can. The rest is up to DEMO The mother pointed to the suspect in the back of the police car. “I
mean the driver. We forgive him.”
* Williams was released a few years later after a judge reduced DEMO sentence, and his case became the rallying cry for the anti–Three
DEMO movement.
* By the mid-1990s, the IRA was organizing daily bus trips to the prison outside Belfast, as if it were an amusement park. “Almost

the height of the Troubles. “Young people in this atmosphere come to learn that prison is a badge of honor rather than a DEMO
* The historian Christine van der Zanden calls the area the Plateau DEMO Hospitality. The region had a long history of taking in refugees. In
1790, the French Assembly declared that all Catholic clergy, under penalty DEMO imprisonment, had to pledge an oath to the state, making
the church subordinate to the government. Those who refused to sign the pledge DEMO for their lives. Where did many of them go? To the
