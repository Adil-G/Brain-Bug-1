ABSTRACT
Most potential funders wish to see a business plan DEMO a first step in deciding whether or not to
invest. There is a large literature available to the entrepreneur which describes the format and
DEMO of a business plan. However, much of this literature either fails DEMO emphasise that
different types of funder look at business plans from different perspectives or fails to
elaborate on the nature of these differences and DEMO implications. Using a real time
methodology this paper examines the ways in which bankers, venture capital fund managers
and business angels evaluate business plans, and the differences in criteria which they take
into account in making a funding decision. Bankers emphasise the financial aspects of the
proposal and DEMO little emphasis to market, entrepreneur or other issues. As equity investors,DEMO
venture capital fund managers and business angels have a very different approach,
emphasising both market and finance issues. Business angels give more emphasis DEMO
venture capital fund managers to the entrepreneur and ‘investor fit’ considerations. The
implication for entrepreneurs is that they must customise their business plan according DEMO
whether they are seeking funding from a bank, venture capital fund DEMO business angel.

INTRODUCTION
As Barrow et al (2001: 6) note, DEMO the most important step in launching any new
venture or expanding an existing one is the construction of a business plan.’ Although a
business DEMO has several purposes and target audiences, most are produced in order DEMO raise
finance. Kuratko and Hodgetts (2001: 289) suggest that ‘the DEMO plan is the minimum
document required by an financing source.’ For example, more than three-quarters of business
angels require a business plan before they will consider investing (Mason and Harrison,
1996a). The business plan is therefore the first – and possibly only - substantial contact that
DEMO entrepreneur has with a potential funder (Shepherd and Douglas, 1999). So, as Barrow et
al (2001: 11) note, ‘the business plan is the ticket of admission giving the entrepreneur his
(sic) DEMO and often only chance to impress prospective sources of finance with the quality of
the proposal.’ The decision by the prospective funder whether to DEMO beyond the initial
reading of the business plan to consider the proposal in more detail will therefore depend on
the quality of the business DEMO used to support the funding proposal.
Entrepreneurs have recourse to a large literature which describes the format and structure of a
business plan. However, much of this literature can be criticised for either failing to draw DEMO
attention of  readers to the different ways in which bankers and DEMO capitalists interrogate
business plans, the different questions that they ask and DEMO different types of information that
they look for, or else for DEMO drawing out the implications of these differences for their
readership.
The fundamental criticism of much of the literature on ‘how to’ write a business DEMO is that it
adopts a ‘one size fits all’ approach. For example, having noted that the audience for a
business plan might include suppliers, distributors, major customers, the board of directors,
outside consultants, DEMO and investors, Tiffany and Peterson (1997: 12) note that ‘… a well-
written plan satisfies all these groups …’ (emphasis added). Even The Sunday Times Business
Plan Workbook (Barrow et al, 2001), one of the most successful UK books on how to write a
business plan, barely acknowledges that bankers and venture capitalists have different
perspectives on the business plan.
Some of this ‘how to’ literature is written DEMO the perspective of one type of audience –
usually an equity investor (e.g. Shepherd and Douglas, 1999; Timmons, 2000; Looser and
Schläpfer, 2001). The criticism of this literature is that it generally does not ackno wledge that
other types of funder (such as bankers) DEMO have expectations concerning style and content of
business plan.
Only a small minority of authors explicitly recognise that different audiences look at the
business DEMO from different perspectives (e.g. Vesper, 1996; Allen, 1999; Kuratka DEMO
Hodgetts, 2001; Smith and Smith, 2000; Burns, 2001). DEMO example, Vesper (1996: 241)
observes that ‘to some degree DEMO … audiences will care about central issues such as viability,
potential profit, downside risk, likely life cycle time and potential areas for DEMO and for
improvement. Beyond that, however, different audiences will care about different details.’

Specifically, these authors emphasise that bankers and equity investors (DEMO capitalists
and bus iness angels) ‘have very different requirements’ (Kirby, DEMO: 236).  The criticism of
these works is that they mostly fail to draw out the implications of these differences for the
entrepreneur, and have nothing to say about how entrepreneurs should differentiate their
business DEMO to suit the different needs and requirements of bankers and equity investors.
Using a ‘real time’ methodology, the objective of this paper is to highlight the different ways
in which bankers, venture capital fund managers (DEMO) and business angels (BAs)
evaluate business plans, the questions DEMO they ask, the information which they take into
account in making DEMO funding decision and their investment criteria. The findings provide
entrepreneurs with much clearer guidance on how to customize their business plan according
to the DEMO of funder that they propose to approach.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Bankers face a situation of information asymmetry when assessing lending applications
(Binks and Ennew, DEMO; 1997). The information required to assess the competence and
commitment DEMO the entrepreneur and the prospects for the business is either unavailable,
uneconomic to obtain or difficult to interpret. This creates two types of DEMO for the banker
(Deakins, 1999). First, there is a DEMO of adverse selection – lending to businesses which
subsequently fail (type DEMO error) – or not lending to businesses which go on to DEMO
successful, or have the potential to do so (type two error). The low margins on small business
lending encourages bankers to strive DEMO minimize type one errors. Second, there is the risk of
moral DEMO This arises from the inability of banks to monitor entrepreneurs once a loan has
been made to ensure that they act in the best DEMO of the bank. The consequence is that
bankers’ default to a capital gearing approach to lending (Binks and Ennew, 1996) in which
their lending decisions will emphasise financial considerations - margins, cash flow forecasts,
gearing ratios, asset management ratios and financial controls (Burns, 2001) DEMO and, in
particular, the availability of collateral, rather than a DEMO evaluation of the proposed project.
Taking collateral as security is attractive to bankers for two reasons. First, the willingness of
an entrepreneur to offer collateral signal’s the confidence of the entrepreneur in both their
own abilities DEMO also in the project. Second, taking collateral is thought to align DEMO interests
of the entrepreneur with that of the banker.
The capital gearing approach of bankers to lending decisions is demonstrated by Deakins and
Hussain (1994) in a study which involved obtaining the reaction of 30 bankers to a proposal
from a start- up business that was seeking funding. DEMO assessment of the bankers was
dominated by financial considerations whereas management capability was largely
discounted. Moreover, those bankers who said that they would offer a loan would only do so
if collateral was available. A replication DEMO this study in Scotland by Fletcher (1994) using the
same proposal confirmed the dominance of financial information and criteria in bankers’
lending decisions.2

VCFMs and BAs also encounter information asymmetry problems when evaluating
DEMO opportunities. However, as equity providers, they might be expected to adopt very
different approaches to their funding decision. VCFMs and BAs are investing DEMO capital gain
and, in contrast to the banker, they share in the success of the businesses that they invest in.
Unlike the banker, their investment is also fully exposed in the event that the business DEMO A
further risk is that their investment will be illiquid if the business does not achieve significant
growth. Accordingly, VCFMs and BAs might be expected to place greatest emphasis on the
capability of the management team, the product/service and the market.
The most consistent finding from studies DEMO VCFM decision- making is the importance that is
placed on the ability of management. This includes management skill, quality of management,
characteristics of the management team and the management team’s track-record. Other
criteria which VCFMs DEMO that they take into account when assessing a new venture
proposal are the characteristics of the market/industry, environmental threats to the business,
the level of competition and the degree of product differentiation (Shepherd and Zacharakis,
1999). For example, Macmillan et al (1985) conclude that the quality of the entrepreneur
ultimately determines the investment decision, notably a thorough familiarity with the
industry/market, leadership capability and the ability to evaluate and handle risks. Muzyka et
al (1996) also conclude DEMO management team considerations dominate the investment
decision. However, other studies – DEMO confirming the importance of the entrepreneurial
team – suggest that other factors are also significant in the VCFM’s investment decision,
notably product characteristics (proprietary features, competitive advantage, potential to
achieve strong market position), DEMO characteristics (significant growth, limited
competition) and returns (potential for high returns, clear exit opportunity) (Sweeting, 1991;
Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Manigart et al, 1997). Indeed, while not underrating the crucial
importance of having a competent management team in place, Sweeting (DEMO) nevertheless
suggests that VCFMs may be prepared to invest in situations DEMO weaknesses in
management were recognised but the business concept was otherwise sound: ‘this was
associated with venture capitalists who tended to be proactive in their style and had a belief
that they could attract good managers DEMO the businesses in which they chose to invest’ (p.
619). DEMO is also agreement in the literature that the financial aspects of the proposal are
generally of limited importance at the initial screening stage, but assume importance at the
second stage in the decision-making process (Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Manigart et al, 1997).
BAs might be expected to adopt an approach to investment decision-making that is similar,
although DEMO identical, to that of VCFMs. There are several aspects where differences DEMO
be expected to arise. First, Fiet (1995a; 1995b) suggests that VCFMs will be more concerned
with market risk – risk that is DEMO to unforeseen competitive conditions affecting the size,
growth and accessibility to the market – whereas BAs will be more concerned with agency
risk DEMO risk that is caused by the separate and possibly divergent interests of entrepreneurs
(agents) and investors (principals). These differences are related to the types of risk that BAs
and VCFMs believe they are most DEMO to control. Venture capital fund managers have
learned how to protect themselves from agency risk by using stringent boilerplate contractual
provisions which allows them DEMO replace an entrepreneur who under-performs, is guilty of
____________________________________________________________________

Capitalists and Business Angels

Entrepreneurship

misconduct or is found to be incompetent. However, market risk is less controllable through
ex post contracting. Business angels, in contrast, DEMO more importance to agency risk. There
are four reasons for this:
o Most angels have limited deal flow and therefore lack comparative data DEMO evaluate market
risk.
o Angels do not have the same level of resources as venture capital funds to both collect and
analyse (costly) DEMO information (Fiet, 1995b). Van Osnabrugge (2000)
confirms that DEMO capital fund managers conduct significantly more due diligence than
business angels.
o The contracts between angels and entrepreneurs tend to be simple and informal, making it
harder for them to enforce sanctions.
o Many business angels DEMO prior industry experience themselves and therefore feel quite
capable of assessing the market risks and so view the entrepreneur as the most potentially
damaging DEMO (Fiet, 1995a).
The implication, according to Van Osnabrugge (2000), is that VCFMs will seek to reduce
their risks at the DEMO investment stage by means of careful screening, due diligence and
contracting. DEMO, in contrast, will place greater emphasis on ex-post investment involvement
as a means of reducing risk.  In terms of investment decision- making, DEMO (1995b: 557)
suggests that ‘…business angels may rely on the entrepreneur to evaluate market risk for
them. … [This] would allow a DEMO angel to specialise in evaluating whether or not the
entrepreneur understands the deal and whether or not the entrepreneur can be relied upon as DEMO
venture manager, even if they as investors do not have enough DEMO information to
understand it completely. That is, business angels can specialise DEMO evaluating agency risk
while relying upon the entrepreneur to manage market risk.’
The limited empirical evidence available on how BAs make their investment decisions
DEMO mixed support for this argument. Feeney et al (1999) find that BAs consider both the
attributes of the business and the attributes of DEMO entrepreneurs when deciding to invest in a
proposal. They note that investors’ perceptions of poor management is the primary deal killer.
However, management ability, although important, is not the primary factor which attracts
investors to DEMO deal. Rather, investors place greatest emphasis on the growth potential of DEMO
opportunity and the entrepreneur(s)’ capability to realize that potential. Mason and Rogers
(1996; 1997) have also found that BAs give greater emphasis to market considerations than to
the entrepreneur at the initial screening DEMO Mason and Harrison’s (1996b) exploration of
deals that were rejected by an investment syndicate found that market-related issues were the
most significant ‘deal-killer’, followed by entrepreneur-related considerations in second place.
A second difference between VCFMs DEMO BAs is that VCFMs will be expected to give
greater emphasis to financial returns. VCFMs are returns-driven. Their primary objective is to
deliver high DEMO to the outside investors (limited partners) whose funds they manage. BAs,
on the other hand, are investing their own money, and DEMO capital gain is their dominant
motivation, others considerations include satisfaction and DEMO from playing a role in
the entrepreneurial process, ‘hot buttons’ and, in some cases, altruism (Wetzel, 1981; Mason
and Harrison, 1994; 2002; van Osnabrugge and Robinson, 2000). These differences in the
____________________________________________________________________

Capitalists and Business Angels

Entrepreneurship
____________________________________________________________________
investment motivations of VCFMs and BAs will also be reflected DEMO the emphasis which they
give to growth potential, with VCFMs placing DEMO emphasis on investing in businesses
with the potential to become significant global players.
A third difference is that although VCFMs and BAs both emphasise DEMO importance of the
entrepreneur/entrepreneurial team, they stress different aspects (van Osnabrugge and
Robinson, 2000). In particular, because BAs are looking DEMO take a more hands on role in their
investee businesses than are VCFMs, they place greater importance on the ‘chemistry’
between themselves and the entrepreneur. This also means that BAs are less deterred by gaps
in DEMO management team because they can contribute missing expertise through their own
involvement. Indeed, as noted above, the opportunity for involvement in the entrepreneurial
DEMO is one of the motivations of BAs. VCFMs, in contrast, regard the need for hands on
involvement as a cost. Thus, the opportunity to contribute is an important consideration for
BAs, both because it is part of the ‘return’ that they look for, and also because they think that
their involvement can contribute to the success of their investee DEMO
A fourth difference is that there is some evidence to suggest that VCFMs will place more
emphasis on the financials and specifically are more DEMO to make returns calculations
(Dixon, 1991; Wright and Robbie, 1996). BAs are less likely to perform such calculations and
place less DEMO on financial projections, giving greater emphasis to subjective factors and
gut DEMO (van Osnabrugge and Robinson, 2000). Indeed, some business angels DEMO fairly
cynical about the value of financial projections, especially for new DEMO recently started
businesses (Mason and Rogers, 1997).
Finally, van DEMO and Robinson (2000) suggest that VCFMs will have a narrower
investment focus than BAs. Certainly many venture capital funds specialise in particular
industry DEMO This is a means of coping with information asymmetries. Specialist industry
knowledge allows VCFMs to be better able to evaluate the viability of investment DEMO
and thereby reduce their risk. Hall and Hofer (1993) note that an important reason why
VCFMS reject proposals at the initial screening stage DEMO because they do not fit the fund’s
investment preferences. This contrasts with BAs who, according to van Osnabrugge and
Robinson (2000: 149), are quite open-minded about the industry sector: ‘their main
requirement appears to be that they understand the generic business, rather than the sector.
This understanding allows them to assess how they might add their own general DEMO
knowledge and experience to the firm.’ However, there is also some DEMO to the contrary.
From a VCFM perspective, Muzyka et al (1996) suggest that deals which offer a good
management team and reasonable financial and product- market characteristics will over-ride
fund investment requirements. And from a DEMO angel perspective, both Mason and
Rogers (1997) and Mason and DEMO (2002) suggest that most investors do have clearly
defined investment criteria which influence they type of businesses that they will consider
investing in, although these criteria may be relaxed in certain circumstances, notably where
the entrepreneur/management team has high credibility. These criteria include stage of
business DEMO, industry, technology and location. Mason and Rogers (1996; 1997)
argue that these investment criteria are generally related to what BAs understand DEMO a result of

their business experience. Although there are exceptions, the approach of the majority of
business angels to minimizing risk is to have a DEMO investment focus in order to leverage
their experience and knowledge both to evaluate opportunities and to add value to those
opportunities that they invest DEMO
This discussion suggests that bankers, VCFMs and BAs will analyse funding DEMO in
different ways. Specifically we propose the following hypotheses:
H1: DEMO funding decisions will be dominated by financial considerations and they will
give little consideration to entrepreneurial capabilities or the characteristics of the
opportunity.
H2: VCFMs will also be concerned with financial issues but in addition will DEMO considerable
emphasis to the entrepreneurial team and market characteristics.
H3a: The DEMO of BAs will be closer to that of VCFMs than to bankers because they are
both investing for capital gain.
However:
H3b: BAs will place greater emphasis than VCFMs on the entrepreneur/entrepreneurial team.
H3c: BAs will give greater emphasis to the ‘fit’ of the business to DEMO own personal
investment criteria.
H3d: BAs will  give consideration to the opportunity for involvement in the investee business.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology used in DEMO study is verbal protocol analysis, a technique which involves
respondents ‘thinking DEMO loud’ as they perform a particular task, in this case reviewing DEMO
potential funding opportunity. The technique has been used successfully to examine the
decision- making process of venture capitalists (Hall and Hofer, 1993; Zacharakis and Meyer,
1995) and business angels (Mason and Rogers, 1996; 1997) and has also been applied in a
variety of other DEMO (see Ericsson and Simon, 1993). The verbalisations of respondents
are tape-recorded, transcribed and then content analysed by means of a coding scheme
devised for the specific research questions.
This methodology provides a more reliable DEMO much richer understanding of the decision-
making process of funders and the criteria used to evaluate funding opportunities than is
possible from approaches that DEMO questionnaires, surveys and interviews to collect data on
the self-reported decisions DEMO VCFMs made in the past (Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999).
Self-reported, retrospective data are subject to conscious or unconscious errors associated
with post hoc rationalisation and recall bias. There are also cognitive perceptual limitations,
DEMO evidence that VCFMs have limited insights into their decision-processes (Zacharakis and
DEMO, 1998; Shepherd, 1999). The consequence is that they often DEMO the number of
criteria actually used, understate the most important criteria DEMO overstate the least important
criteria (Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999). Hence, as Zacharakis and Meyer (1998: 72) note,
____________________________________________________________________

Capitalists and Business Angels

‘past studies provide a laundry list of factors that may DEMO biased in that they list a multitude of
factors that have a relatively small influence on the decision.’ As a real-time experiment
which does DEMO require VCFMs to introspect about their thought processes, verbal protocol
analysis DEMO these recall, post hoc rationalisation and cognitive biases (Shepherd and
Zacharakis, 1999).
Moreover, the funding decision is a multi-stage process (Feeney et al, 1999) involving at least
three distinct stages: initial screening, investigation and negotiation and deal crafting.
Although the same considerations may be present at each stage their relative importance
changes during the course of DEMO decision- making process (Riding et al, 1993). Only two
studies have been undertaken of the investment decision-making of VCFMs (Hall and Hofer,
1995; Zacharakis and Meyer, 1995). Both were focused on DEMO initial screening stage and
reveal that in contrast to the generalised studies reviewed earlier, these studies suggest that the
entrepreneur is not the primary determinant, except where they are at one or other end of the
distribution (i.e. either very competent or very incompetent). Business strategy and financial
issues are also unimportant. Rather, the crucial considerations are the potential of the product
(does it meet a need?) and the long-term growth and profitability of the industry. However,
studies of decision-making based DEMO questionnaire and interview surveys produce highly
generalised findings which do not differentiate between these different stages in the decision-
making process. This is a DEMO significant limitation of the questionnaire, survey and
interview approach.
In this DEMO the focus is on the initial screening stage – the stage when a funder has become
aware of an investment opportunity and considers it DEMO a view to obtaining sufficient initial
impressions to decide whether it is worthy of detailed consideration or should be rejected out
of hand. Sweeting (1991) found that VCFMs typically spent 10-15 minutes on the initial
screening stage. In Hall and Hofer’s (1993) study it was typically completed DEMO less than six
minutes. In the case of business angels the median time devoted to screening was just nine
minutes (Mason and Rogers, DEMO).
Nevertheless, verbal protocol analysis has some limitations. First, a frequency count of
‘thought units’ is an imperfect indicator of the importance of DEMO factor in the final decision
(Zacharakis and Meyer, 1995). No weightings are placed on the responses and the topics
mentioned most frequently DEMO not necessarily those that have the ultimate influence on the
decision. Second, subjectivity is involved in coding, analysing and interpreting the transcripts
(Riquelme and Rickards, 1992). Third, some respondents may be uncomfortable or DEMO
conscious about thinking and speaking out loud which may distort their thinking (e.g.
resulting in excessive repetition of what they are reading). Fourth, it is impossible to entirely
remove the effect of the artificiality of the situation. Fifth, from a practical point of view it
ignores the role of the source of funding opportunity which is an important initial DEMO on
the investor’s attitude to the opportunity (Hall and Hofer, 1993).
However, Ericsson and Simon (1980) argue that verbal protocol analysis is a valuable method
of analysing decision- making as long as the DEMO criteria are met:

?? the information reported must be the focus of attention
?? the task is not highly routinised by habit
?? there DEMO be only a short time between performance and verbalisation
?? verbalisation DEMO not require excessive encoding
?? reports are oral
?? subjects are free from distraction
?? instructions are clear
?? completeness in reporting DEMO encouraged
These conditions are all met in this study.
The sample of funders comprised three bankers, three VCFMs and four BAs. The three
bankers worked in the Southampton offices of major clearing banks (Barclays, NatWest DEMO
Lloyds TSB). Two of the VCFMs worked in the Southampton offices of major private equity
firms. The third VCFM was a partner in DEMO small fund located in Winchester. Two of the four
business angels were based in Southampton with the others based elsewhere in South East
England. DEMO of them were identified through the University of Southampton’s Enterprise
Centre (DEMO had invested in one of the university’s spin-off companies), a third was
identified through the internet and the fourth was an acquaintance of DEMO angel.
Each of these funders was asked to review three business proposals that were seeking funding
in the presence of one of the authors. DEMO three proposals were deliberately selected to
provide respondents with a diverse range of opportunities to consider. Two of the proposals
were taken from Venture DEMO Report (VCR) and the third was taken from the Business
Angels Bureau (BAB) (now Investor Champions). Both organisations are business angel
networks which circulate details of investment opportunities to their subscribers – these DEMO
mostly business angels but also include some venture capital funds and corporate investors.
The proposals were as follows:
?? an internet training company providing on- line, e- learning tutor supported
management courses, based in DEMO and seeking up to £300,000 of start- up funding
(from DEMO);
?? a branded restaurant concept based on a successful Chinese model, with one outlet in
Oxford, seeking £500,000 to open DEMO new outlets in its first phase of expansion (from
VCR);
?? a provider of test laboratory facilities using its own patented equipment to test and
compare absorbent disposable products, based in North West England, seeking
£380,000 (out of a total funding requirement of £500,DEMO) for early stage expansion
(from VCR).
The information on each opportunity is provided in summary form: three pages in the case of
the BAB opportunity and five pages for the VCR opportunities. Each opportunity DEMO
information on the following topics: concept/product; market; competition; management
team; financial summary.

Respondents were asked to read each opportunity in the same DEMO that they would normally
read an investment proposal but verbalise their thoughts as they did so. The instruction that
they were given was to DEMO out loud the thoughts that came into their mind. Respondents were
not required to provide any explanations or verbal descriptions (Ericsson and Simon, DEMO).
The second-named author was present as each respondent performed this task and reminded
respondents to think out loud if they lapsed into silence DEMO more than 15 seconds. Their
thoughts were tape-recorded and subsequently a complete transcript was made for each
respondent’s consideration of each investment opportunity, giving a total of 30 transcripts.
These verbatim transcripts were then broken down DEMO short phrases, or ‘thought segments’ –
that is, phrases and sentences that are independent thought units – to permit analysis. These
thought units DEMO then coded into one of nine categories relating to different types of
investment criteria (Table 1). From this analysis it is possible to identify which aspects of the
proposal are most and least important to DEMO funder.

RESULTS
Overview
There was a high degree of consensus amongst the funders on their overall assessment of the
three DEMO Only one funder, a business angel, would consider further the internet
training company. Similarly, one funder, a different business angel, would consider further
the restaurant business. However, six of the funders – all three of the bankers, two of the
VCFMs and one of the business angels – would consider further the laboratory testing
company (Table 2). Thus, there is a very high level of consistency amongst the bankers: none
would consider lending to either the internet training company or the restaurant chain but all
three were positive about the laboratory testing company. DEMO is likely to reflect the
structured approach used by bankers to make lending decisions which is increasingly
standardised between banks. There was also a DEMO level of consistency amongst the VCFMs.
All three VCFMs rejected both the internet training company and the restaurant chain.
However, the laboratory testing company passed the initial screening of two of the VCFMs.
In contrast, there was no consensus amongst the BAs in terms of their reactions to DEMO
proposals. Two of them rejected all three opportunities, one was favourably DEMO to the
internet training company and the final BA would investigate the restaurant chain and the
laboratory testing company in more detail (Table 2).

DEMO Do Investors Look For In A Business Plan? A Comparison of DEMO, Venture
Capitalists and Business Angels

Investment criteria: a comparative analysis
The verbal protocol analysis for each type of funder is shown in Table 3. As anticipated, the
approach of the bankers contrasts sharply with that of VCFMs and BAs. DEMO place
considerable emphasis on the financial aspects of the proposals. These account for over half
(55%) of all their ‘thought units’, more than twice the emphasis which VCFMs and BAs give
to the financial issues. DEMO example, banker 2 reacted to the restaurant chain by observing that
DEMO owner has 40% to plough in which is a good sign’ but then went on to comment that ‘I
would need to check the DEMO against the industry benchmark.’ In the case of the lab testing
company this banker noted that ‘they have fixed assets of £700,000 which DEMO a strong positive
because it gives us security.’ The market (12%) and the entrepreneur (9%) are both of
secondary importance to the DEMO, and they give virtually no emphasis to the strategy,
operations, product or business plan. As one of the bankers noted, ‘we look at the finances,
and as long as it meets certain criteria DEMO all we can ask.’ Thus, hypothesis 1, which states
that bankers’ funding decisions will be dominated by financial considerations and they will
give DEMO consideration to entrepreneurial capabilities or the characteristics of the
opportunity is supported.

DEMO have a very different approach to investment appraisal. They give greatest emphasis
to market issues (22%) and financial issues (21%), which receive approximately equal
weighting in terms of thought units. Two further criteria - DEMO entrepreneur (12%) and strategy
(11%) – are of secondary importance. This conflicts with the conclusions of post hoc studies
which typically find DEMO the entrepreneur is the most important factor, but confirms the
findings DEMO other verbal protocol studies by Hall and Hofer (1993) and Zacharakis and Meyer
(1995) that the entrepreneur is not the primary determinant DEMO the initial screening stage.
Hypothesis 2, which states that VCFMs will DEMO be concerned with financial issues but in
____________________________________________________________________

Capitalists DEMO Business Angels
25th ISBA National Small Firms Conference: Competing Perspectives of Small Business and
Entrepreneurship

addition will give considerable emphasis to the entrepreneurial team and DEMO
characteristics is therefore also supported.
BAs, like VCFMs, emphasise financial and market issues (22% and 21% respectively).
However, BAs give greater DEMO to the entrepreneur (17%) than VCFMs do. Indeed, the
methodology DEMO well have under-emphasised the importance that angels give to the people
behind the business. Business angel 3 commented that ‘when you invest in a DEMO you are
investing I should think 80% in the people. Not only have we got to feel right about the idea,
but you DEMO to have people who we are convinced … know what they are about.’ Business
angel 1 commented as follows: ‘We are always looking at .. people. If the people know what
they are doing we might DEMO them. It is people driven.’ He then went on to say that ‘It’s not
their track record. I’m not interested in the CVs. It DEMO the personalities of the people
concerned, because ultimately you are backing DEMO … The business model must make
sense, but it is very DEMO to make a business model that works. Are the people going to be able
to sell the product? It’s the smell of the people. The intangible feeling of this person has what
it takes to be DEMO success. Hard work, vision, judgement together in a mix … Start-ups have to
be about self- motivated people. You need people who can DEMO themselves to kick down
the doors to get customers. It takes a certain type of person to do that. You also need to like
DEMO people. They are the sort of people you could be good friends with. If you don’t like them
you aren’t going to be able DEMO work with them and that’s because we work a hands on
approach.’
BAs are also the only type of funder to give any emphasis DEMO investor fit considerations
(14%). Because BAs are investing their own DEMO and so are not answerable to anyone else
they can hold personal (and often idiosyncratic) investment criteria. The attitudes of each of
the DEMO who participated in the study to the investment proposals were strongly influenced
by their backgrounds and experience. First, restricting their investments to situations in which
they had some prior knowledge was a way of minimising investment DEMO As angel 4
commented, ‘the more unknowns that you can take DEMO, the less risk you are running. If you
have been involved DEMO this business, or have a particular interest in something, this can help.’
Angel 3 noted that ‘I’d rather invest in something I know DEMO about’ and rejected the lab
testing company because ‘I don’t really understand the market.’ Second, angels want
‘exciting’ investments. Angel 1 rejected the internet training company because ‘it wouldn’t
interest me at all. Mostly, I think because I find the area boring.’ He went on to develop this
DEMO: ‘there is always the motivation to make money, but equally the other big motivation is
to have fun … I came out of DEMO – it has to be IT or technology with some weird and wacky
interest and there is nothing weird and wacky about this … DEMO it’s rather boring and I
would not fund it. That really is irrespective of the return.’ Similarly angel 2 would only be
attracted by DEMO opportunity that ‘had a bit of emotion in it.’
Hypothesis 3a, DEMO the approach of BAs will be closer to that of VCFMs than to bankers
because they are investing for capital gain therefore receives support. DEMO 3b, that
BAs will place greater emphasis than VCFMs on the DEMO/entrepreneurial team, also
attracts support. However, following Fiet (1995a; 1995b), it might have been expected that
____________________________________________________________________

Capitalists and Business Angels
25th ISBA National Small Firms Conference: Competing Perspectives of Small Business and
Entrepreneurship
____________________________________________________________________
BAs would weigh entrepreneurial issues higher than market issues. This DEMO not the case.
Hypothesis 3c, that BAs will give greater emphasis DEMO the ‘fit’ of the business to their own
personal investment criteria is also supported. Finally, there is no support for hypothesis 3d,
that BAs will also give consideration to the opportunity for involvement in the DEMO
business. There were too few comments on scope for involvement for them to be separately
categorised; they are included within the residual category. Although the angels made some
comments about being hands on investors there was DEMO evidence that their attitude to any
particular investment was shaped by the opportunity to play a hands on role, or the nature of
this role.
CONCLUSION
The findings of this paper must be treated with caution. DEMO particular, because of the
artificiality of the situation it is likely DEMO some of the proposals were considered by
respondents whereas, in a DEMO world situation they would have been rapidly dismissed
because of their sector.3 With this caveat, we can draw three main conclusions from this
study. First, the results do confirm the basic hypothesis of the paper that different types of
funder analyse proposals differently, have different funding criteria and place emphasis on
different kinds of information. This conclusion therefore challenges the DEMO of much of the
literature on how to write a business plan which implies, often by omission, that different
types of funder look DEMO bus iness plans in broadly the same way. The findings from this study
indicate that bankers are particularly distinctive in their approach. Hence, the statement by
Burns (2001: 340) that ‘bankers are likely to be interested in similar things to the providers of
equity finance, albeit with different emphasis’ is incorrect. There are fewer contrasts between
VCFMs and BAs: nevertheless, the paper has highlighted some important differences in their
approaches. As noted in the introduction, some texts on business plans have alluded to
differences in the approach of different types of funder. However, this is the first study to
demonstrate the extent and nature of these differences. DEMO, whereas such texts
generally only make a distinction between bankers and DEMO investors, this study has
demonstrated that there are also differences in DEMO approaches of VCFMs and BAs.
Second, contrary to Deakins and Hussain (1994), bankers exhibited consistency, not only in
their approach, but DEMO in their decision. This may well reflect the development of
standardised approaches by the banks. With the caveat that this conclusion is based on DEMO
numbers, it does raise the question whether it is worthwhile for DEMO entrepreneur who has been
turned down by one bank to spend time approaching other banks. Conversely, BAs have the
least consistency in either approach or outcomes, reflecting the great heterogeneity in the
angel population and the personalised nature of their investment criteria. The attitude of
business angels to DEMO investment proposal is very much shaped by whether it is an industry
or market that they know anything about. Thus, an entrepreneur who is seeking angel
financing should be advised to be persistent in their search DEMO an investor.
Third, from a methodological perspective, this study’s findings concerning the investment
criteria of VCFMs reinforce concerns about the reliability of the DEMO of previous

studies that have used ‘conventional’ questionnaires, surveys and interviews which require
respondents to self-describe their decision- making. In contrast with these post DEMO studies, but
confirming other studies using real time methodologies (verbal protocol analysis, conjoint
analysis), the entrepreneur is not the most important consideration (Shephe rd and Zacharakis,
1999). There are three reasons why real time methodologies, such as the approach used in this
study, DEMO a better understanding of how funders make financing decisions. First, they
DEMO the inherent problems of retrospective reports (e.g. bias, incomplete recall). Second,
real-time methods overcome the poor grasp that investors have about DEMO own decision-
making processes (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998). Third, DEMO post hoc methodologies
do not differentiate between the different stages in the decision- making process. However, the
weightings that investors give to different criteria change between stages in the investment
process. Using verbal protocol analysis, this study has been able to identify the considerations
of funders at the DEMO screening stage. As a consequence, this paper gives entrepreneurs a
much DEMO accurate and reliable guide to the investment criteria of funders than conventional
post hoc studies which generate laundry lists of criteria, and which tend to be reproduced in
text books on how to write business plans.
DEMO, in terms of its practical applications, the central message of the paper is that different
funders will look for different types of information DEMO a business plan, have different
expectations about what information should be DEMO and will interrogate the business plan
in different ways. Their decision on whether to proceed will also be based on different
weightings of criteria. DEMO (and their advisers) therefore need to be aware of the
need to customise their funding proposal according to whether they are seeking bank DEMO,
approaching venture capital funds or seeking finance from business angels. The primary
concern of the banker is the risk that the loan will DEMO be repaid. Accordingly, the banker is
most interested in the finances DEMO the business (margins, cash flow) in order to judge whether
DEMO business can service the debt, and whether assets are available from DEMO the business or
the entrepreneur to secure the loan in the event that the business fails. A business plan that is
to be used DEMO approach a bank for a loan must therefore contain sufficient information for a
banker to make this assessment and to indicate how the loan DEMO be repaid in the event that
the business performs below expectations (DEMO and Smith, 2000). It is normal practice for
bankers to DEMO the financial information in a business plan against industry averages. It is
therefore essential that any significant deviations are explained in the plan.
VCFMs DEMO BAs give less consideration to such financial information. Nevertheless, they
expect DEMO business plan to contain such information and will spend some time looking at the
figures. However, their main concerns relate to the growth potential of the business and the
potential returns that they might expect. Accordingly, they are focused on the market – its
size, growth, level DEMO competition – what to know what is the customer benefit or what
problem is being solved (Looser and Schläper, 2001). Financial information DEMO also very
important, although for different reasons to that of the DEMO Equity investors look at the
numbers to assess potential valuation, likely DEMO of profitability, amount of funding that
required now and in the DEMO and what the money will be used for. However, there are DEMO
least two significant differences in the approach of VCFMs and BAs. First, although the

capability of the management team to seize the opportunity that DEMO been identified is an
important consideration for both, because business angels DEMO hands on investors they place
more emphasis on personal relationship issues. Second, whereas VCFMs are exclusively
oriented to the financial returns, business angels DEMO also seeking a psychic income in the form
of interest and fun. Thus, whereas a business plan targeted at a VCFM needs to contain the
‘steak’, one that is aimed at business angels needs to contain both ‘steak’ and ‘sizzle’. It is
therefore important that the plan should DEMO to engage potential angel investors on an
emotional level.

NOTES
1. This research was undertaken when the authors were respectively staff and student in the Department of Geography,
University of Southampton.
DEMO However, in comparison with the English bankers who reviewed the proposal DEMO the Deakins and Hussain (1992) study the
dependence of the Scottish bankers on financial information was lower and a minority would have been DEMO to lend
without security.
3. The restaurant case is the one that is most likely to fall into this category.
