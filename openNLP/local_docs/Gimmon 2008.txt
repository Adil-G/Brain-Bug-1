Abstract
Purpose – This research aims to deal with the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of teamwork in entrepreneurial
ventures. Its DEMO is to advance the knowledge of investors’ perspective with regard to high
technology entrepreneurial teams. Prior studies suggest that teamwork affects new venture
performance. DEMO, only little evidence with conﬂicting conclusions was found in prior research
DEMO the importance investors lend to founders’ teamwork as part of their evaluation criteria of
founders’ human capital.
Design/methodology/approach – The importance of DEMO teamwork factor on new venture
performance was measured by meta-analysis of 27 previous studies which shows that founders’
teamwork takes the fourth place among DEMO 11 measured founders’ human capital factors. Are
investors’ views coherent with these ﬁndings? The author interviewed ﬁve venture capitalists (VCs)
and ﬁve DEMO angels with investment experience in early stage high technology ventures.
Findings – Findings unexpectedly show that most interviewees did not prefer team-starts to
single-starts DEMO ventures and did not highly consider the teamwork factor in their investment
evaluation criteria. There were no major differences between VCs and business angel DEMO
interviewed.
Research limitations/implications – The ﬁndings of this qualitative study need validation. Also
investors’ espoused criteria may differ from their actual in-use criteria. DEMO for further research
are suggested.
Practical implications – Practitioners may reconsider their evaluation criteria regarding new
ventures while lending more weight to the team DEMO
Originality/value – The paper contributes to the knowledge of investors’ perspective on team-starts
and teamwork in new ventures. This evaluation criterion has been DEMO, though it affects
new venture performance.

Introduction
The subject of this DEMO is the importance of team-starts in the creation of high-tech
new ventures and teamwork at early stage right after their creation as viewed by
DEMO as part of their evaluation of founder’s human capital. Human capital is a
stock of assets contained in knowledge and skills, which enables members of work
force to receive a ﬂow of income (Becker, 1964)DEMO More speciﬁcally to new ventures
Smart (1999, p. 60) deﬁned DEMO capital as the propensity of a person or group to
perform behaviours that are valued by an organization. The capabilities and the
attitudes of DEMO entrepreneurs are critical factors in the performance of new
ventures (Hart DEMO al., 1995, p. 92; Greene et al., 1999), but also in investors’ decisions
(MacMillan et al., 1985; Smart, 1999; Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2005). Although some

argue that venture capitalists seek good industries DEMO good people (Zider, 1998),
researchers have found that for DEMO venture capitalists (VCs), the quality of the
entrepreneur, i.e. founders’ human resources ultimately determines the funding
decisions: they back the “jockey” rather than the “horse” (MacMillan et al., 1985).
Since the 1990s, team entrepreneurship has received growing interest as a body of
research builds DEMO suggests that fast-growth ﬁrms are more likely to have been
founded by teams rather than by a single founder (Cooney, 2005; Forbes et al., 2006).
Cooney stated that the factor of the founding team size and compatibility was found in
the majority of previous studies to DEMO a signiﬁcant effect on the performance of new
ventures. It enhances the probability of having more of the required human resources
in the venture DEMO on the other hand may raise conﬂicts between the team members
that in turn reduce performance. In addition to the relationship within the founders
DEMO comprise the entrepreneurial team another aspect of teamwork is their relation
with the investors. The potential importance of the relationships between VCs and
entrepreneurs DEMO create or destroy value strongly appears in high-technology sectors,
particularly at the earliest stages of venture development. But following Cooney (2005)
entrepreneurial teams refer to venture’s founders not including venture’s investors.
Literature review
Prior DEMO regarding group effectiveness suggested that group characteristics
inﬂuence work outcomes (Goodman DEMO al., 1990). These researchers credited Heckman’s
(1983) work to DEMO major inﬂuence in shaping current thinking about work groups.
Heckman modelled group effectiveness by group design in the organizational context
along with group synergy DEMO process criteria. A similar concept though more
applicable to new ventures was introduced by Kolodny and Kiggundu (1980) who
developed a general model DEMO the interaction between leadership skills, technical skills,
group characteristics and DEMO work outcomes.
Companies founded by teams of entrepreneurs were found more likely to succeed
than those founded by individuals (Vesper, 1980, p. 55). Reich (1987) argued that
entrepreneurship should be reconsidered with the DEMO as hero. The reason is that
team formation enables the assembly of greater resources and can add to the breadth of
founders’ skills and DEMO available to the ﬁrm and enhance conﬁdence to
investors, customers, and the entrepreneurs themselves (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon,
1992). These researchers reviewed studies which examined the presence or absence of a
team and the DEMO of members of the team and concluded that ﬁrms started by
teams perform better than those started by single founders. Also contributing to
performance DEMO if team members had prior joint experience in working together, and
DEMO a higher percentage of essential functions were performed by founders. Greater
educational diversity within the team, i.e. complementary education is associated with
higher performance. As Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon expected, most of the studies on
founding teams had focus upon high-technology ﬁrms where team formation is most
common.
People DEMO outstanding teams are not necessarily more driven or more committed or
brighter than members of less accomplished teams. What people on the best teams
DEMO is the ability to work with others and maintain a high level of
interdependency among the team members. In comparison to chief executives,
DEMO demonstrate poorer skills in teamwork and cooperation with others;
however, entrepreneurs obviously need some degree of reliance on other members of
the team in order to survive (Dyson, 2001).
In order DEMO evaluate the importance of the teamwork factor on new venture
performance an extensive literature review was conducted through previous studies
published from 1974 to DEMO The eventual 27 reviewed studies represent all
signiﬁcant, cited, empirical quantitative work on the comprehensive relationship
between founder’s human capital (without regard to personality variables) and the
performance of new venture. These studies are the following: Rothwell et al. (1974),
Cooper and Bruno (1977), Maidique and Hayes (1984), Maidique (1986), Stuart and
Abetti (1987), Goslin (1987), Perry et al. (1988), Dubini (1990), Bruderl et al. (1992),
Reynolds (1993), DEMO et al. (1994), Lussier (1995), Lussier and Pfeifer (DEMO), Yusuf
(1995), Hart et al. (1995), Bamford et al. (1996), Low and Abrahamson (1997), Gartner
et al. (1998), Gadenne (1998), Shepherd et al. (2000), Baum DEMO al. (2001), Shane and Stuart
(2002), Kakati (2003), Florin et al. (2003), Brown and Hanlon (2004), Lee and Lee (2004),
Schwartz et al. (2005), Lee and Chang (2005).
Meta-analysis was performed on these previous studies. The use of this technique is
still quite rare in the literature, despite Pressman and Montecinos’ (1996, p. 879) call for
meta-analysis as a way of extracting further understanding from existing empirical
work. Findings of all these DEMO identiﬁed 11 different human capital factors as
shown in Table I. These factors are hereby ranked by the order of the number of
studies (out of total 27, see in brackets) in which the factor DEMO measured and was
found to signiﬁcantly affect new venture performance: industry DEMO experience (14),
entrepreneurial mindset (10), education (8), teamwork (6), general management
experience (5), start-up experience (4), learning ability (3), gender (3), age (2), parents
were entrepreneurs (2), ethnicity (1). This meta-analysis shows DEMO founders’
teamwork takes the fourth place between the 11 measured founders’ human capital
factors while counting the number of studies (see S ¼ 6 in Table I) in which it was
found signiﬁcant in affecting new venture performance and considering the low
number of studies (see N ¼ 1 in Table I) in which it was not found signiﬁcant. In
comparison to the other measured factors this meta-analysis lends quite a consistent
DEMO for the effect of team-starts on performance. The six studies in which founders’
teamwork was measured and found signiﬁcant (statistically signiﬁcant at minimum
level of 0.05) are: Cooper and Bruno (1977), Maidique (1986), Stuart and Abetti (1987),
Reynolds (1993), Cooper et DEMO (1994), Bamford et al. (1996). Of the 27 studies the only
one study which found the teamwork effect on new venture DEMO to be
insigniﬁcant was conducted by Lussier (1995) and Lussier and Pfeifer (2001). This
study could not support the hypothesis that a business started by one person has a
greater chance of failure than DEMO ﬁrm started by more than one person, based on his
literature DEMO in which three of the four related studies found this success factor to
be signiﬁcant. This discrepancy might be explained due to Lussier’s “bankruptcy”
DEMO for the dependent variable of non-survival ﬁrms. In the study conducted by
Cooper et al. (1994) the number of partners was signiﬁcantly associated DEMO high
growth ﬁrms, but not with the marginal survival ﬁrms, perhaps due to team beneﬁts
that provides more available resources needed for high DEMO On the other side, the
unexpected absence of team factor effect DEMO marginal survival ﬁrms was explained by
the researchers as a possible reﬂection the break-up of some partnerships because of

disagreements. The required collaboration between the founding members appears to
be DEMO drawback of team formation.
Gorton (1997) studied the speciﬁc effect of team-starts on new ventures performance
in the UK. While opposing prior research DEMO unexpectedly found that team-starts have
not achieved signiﬁcantly higher growth than single-starts. Therefore his study
suggested that ventures started by teams should not be DEMO any differently from
single founder enterprises in terms of access to public funds or support. In other words
a bad business proposition should be DEMO for investors regardless of whether it
comes from a single founder or group of entrepreneurs.
The way investors view entrepreneurial teams, in previous research, gets little
coverage with no coherent conclusions. Maidique (1986) found that VCs associate prior
joint experience of the founding team with their venture success. Zider (1998) indicated
on the basis of his personal knowledge of the Silicon Valley that VCs consider the ideal
founder to also understand the need for DEMO team with a variety of skills. On the other
hand, Hall DEMO Hofer (1993) found that VCs look for founders with a balanced
management team, but merely little importance was attached by VCs to the
entrepreneur/entrepreneurial team. Following the limited evidence and conﬂicting
conclusions found in DEMO research regarding the importance investors lend to
founders’ teamwork, it is DEMO to hypothesize investors’ perspective in this issue.
In the rest of this paper we present and discuss our empirical study which was
designed to DEMO investors’ perspective in regard to team-starts and teamwork in
new ventures.
Methodology
To explore investors’ perspective on team starts and teamwork in high technology DEMO
ventures, we applied a qualitative study in order “to understand and DEMO the
experiences and actions of people as they encounter, engage, and live through
situations” (Elliott et al., 1999, p. 216). Lee et al. (1999, p. 164) stated that:
Most qualitative research strives to generate, elaborate, or test theories from organizational
and vocational DEMO ... Theory testing occurs when formal hypotheses or a formal
theory determines the study’s design.
Case study method ﬁts in order “to explain the DEMO causal links in real-life
interventions that are too complex for the survey or experimental strategies” (Yin,
2003, p. 15). Also Lee (1999, p. 54) cited Yin in regard to organizational research:
DEMO the main purpose [of case study research method] in the management literature has
been to generate new theory, Yin argues that case study research lends itself to testing of
existing theory as well.
This study was DEMO for an inductive research design of a multiple case method
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Fried and Hisrich, 1995; Yin, 2003). We chose DEMO adopt a multiple
case design which is preferred over a single-case design for more robust generalization,
due to “the substantial analytic beneﬁts from DEMO two or more cases” (Yin, 2003,
p. 53). Replications should alter one or two experimental conditions to see whether the
ﬁndings DEMO still be duplicated. The strategy we chose for the selection of the cases
was maximum variation cases, which allows “to obtain information about the
signiﬁcance of various circumstances for case process and outcome (e.g. three to four
cases that are very different on one dimension)” (Flyvbjerg, DEMO, p. 230). The
generation of multiple case studies enabled us DEMO follow replication logic of six different
experimental conditions: two types of DEMO investor (VC or business angel) and
three nations where the investor operates (US, UK, and Israel). The three nations were
chosen as they differ in size but all have relatively well-developed VC and DEMO
angel communities (Bygrave and Hunt, 2005). In order to substantiate ﬁndings, for four
of the six different experimental conditions we chose two case studies, hence the
number of cases from which we are drawing is ten, which allows for meaningful levels
of cross-case comparison. By splitting the sample equally between venture capitalists
and angels, and across different countries we were able to check for patterns of
similarity and difference between DEMO two types of equity investor and in different
national contexts.

The multiple sample design was as follows: two VCs and two angels from two
countries, the US and Israel, and one VC and one angel from a third country, the DEMO
These investors were chosen because they were known to invest in early stage high
tech ventures; apart from that criterion, they were chosen DEMO reasons of convenience
and availability, similar to the method used by DEMO and Hisrich (1995). Our method
differs from theirs, however, DEMO that we were not trying to develop a new theory, but
DEMO trying to reconcile our theory-based interpretation of the phenomenon with that
espoused by investors.
Table II provides description on each of the ten investors DEMO participated in this
study. Prior to the ten interviews we conducted a pilot survey in which other two VCs
and two angels were interviewed. DEMO results of these pilot interviews were not
included in the current study, but they helped us to form the question plan.
Respondents were told the study was on investment criteria in high tech ventures and
were DEMO prompted by information or papers on previous research ﬁndings. We used
open-ended questions to elucidate their evaluation criteria of founders’ human capital
in general DEMO more speciﬁcally asked whether and how they refer to team size and
teamwork in high technology new ventures. The ten investors were interviewed
separately DEMO one hour, and the interviews were taped and transcribed. We then
DEMO patterns in the ﬁndings by tabulating data and comparing responses across all
respondents, as recommended by Miles and Huberman (1994).
Results
Table DEMO presents the interviewees’ evaluation criteria of entrepreneurial human
capital resources for their funding decisions. The order of the different founder’s
resources is ranked by DEMO number of respondents who suggested same resource. The
team factor (including DEMO and team-starts) was referred by only ﬁve of the ten
interviewees, behind 6 other factors: industry high-tech experience, managerial
experience, leadership, DEMO orientation, commitment, and investor compatibility.
Founder’s human capital factors which were found to be considered to a lesser extent
than the team factor DEMO as follow: fortitude, recognises own weaknesses,
communicator, entrepreneurial skills, gender and age. In regard to the team factor,
one interviewee (Isra-VC2) explicitly argued that it is not an issue and has null
importance. As of the other nine interviewees, ﬁve ignored the team factor, four
indicated their teamwork considerations, and only one of these four (Isra-VC1)
indicated preference for team-starts:
The team factor is not DEMO in funding criteria since new staff can always be hired and
replace part of the management team or ﬁll in required capabilities which the DEMO does not
have (ISR-VC2).
The pattern of responses in Table DEMO shows that there were some differences of opinion
between the respondents. The non-American investors (including US-Ang2 who
immigrated to the US from Europe) DEMO more likely to look for team players, but this
may stem DEMO similar concerns over the ability of the founder entrepreneur to grow a
professional management team. As the UK angel said:
The big cause DEMO failure has usually been personality issues, something with the team that
DEMO to crumble and fall apart. I think it’s because the entrepreneur tends to ride roughshod
over others (UK-Ang1).

Investors’ evaluation
criteria of entrepreneurial
human DEMO resources
for funding decisions
Investors offered a range of other human capital features relating to teamwork DEMO
looked for in the entrepreneur. Three US investors mentioned the issue of succession
and two (one angel and one VC) stated they explicitly DEMO for people who would be
willing to recognise when it was time to step aside, as in this example:
We are not particularly skilled at coming up with a good appraisal of their willingness to
DEMO a leadership team and step aside at the right time. If an entrepreneur smells the fact that
coachability is important, they can hide that for a long time, surely until after they get the
money (DEMO).
Investor compatibility was also a general theme across the three countries and both
types of investor. Some investors linked this to the subjective DEMO of investment
decision-making, and several noted that this took a long DEMO to assess and was a “deal
killer”:
No-one ever talks about the subjective side of your analysis, but it’s there as well. Sometimes
it weighs more heavily because sometimes some of the subjectivity comes from DEMO
partnership. So they’ll look at the objective data but they’ll have a subjective reason for not
wanting to do the deal. I do think DEMO is a gap because of that but no-one ever talks about it
(USVCap2).
In summary, more than half of the interviewed investors DEMO found ignoring the team
factor. As of team-starts only one of the ten interviewees of this study stated to prefer
ventures started by more DEMO one founder.
Discussion and further research
In this paper, we report DEMO responses of a sample of ten investors in high tech ventures
when asked describe their own evaluation criteria. In doing so, we could observe
whether the effect of teamwork on new venture performance suggested in previous
DEMO was also indicated by ﬁnancial investors for their investment decisions.
Findings of this study show that most investors did not prefer team-starts to
single-starts DEMO ventures which conform to Gorton’s (1997) study that team-starts do
not achieve higher growth than single-starts. Also the majority of the interviewed
investors DEMO not stated considering the teamwork factor in their investment evaluation
criteria. This kind of investors’ perspective follows Hall and Hofer (1993) but it DEMO a
conﬂict with the studies conducted by Maidique (1986) and Zider (1998). Moreover
unexpected are the ﬁndings of this study in light of the meta-analysis of previous
research which is presented in the literature DEMO showing that six out of seven
studies found teamwork to signiﬁcantly affect new venture performance. Due to this
effect it could be expected that DEMO would lend more weight to teamwork in their
investment decisions. For example Cooper et al. (1994) found that the number of
partners was DEMO associated with high growth ﬁrms that are of great interest
for ﬁnancial investors. Also following Cooney (2005) it was expected that most
investors DEMO prefer to invest in new ventures started by teams but most of them
were found indifferent to the size of the founding team. The DEMO ﬁndings may
be explained due to the other founders’ human capital factors for which investors lend
great importance such as founders’ experience which in DEMO view may overlap
with the team factor. In other words it is possible that investors consider the beneﬁts
enfolded in team size and teamwork DEMO be associated as well with their other human
capital investment criteria due to misperceptions (Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2001;
Entrepreneurial
team-starts
335

Riquelme and Watson, 2002). Another explanation is that investors who lend weight to
leadership (as did seven of our ten interviewees) may consider the required
collaboration between the founding members as a potential drawback of team
formation (Cooper et al., 1994)DEMO
Financial investors refer to both VCs and business angels who share similar goals
and considerations as opposed to strategic investors who through investing in DEMO
ventures pursue additional beneﬁts to their own businesses (Mason and Stark, 2004).
Following these researchers we found no difference of attitude between DEMO and
business angels in the responses of our interviewees. Investor differences by country
show that American investors tend to ignore the teamwork factor while DEMO British and
Israeli investors tend to consider the importance of teamwork and team-starts in new
ventures.
A limitation of qualitative methods is being more DEMO valid than more
traditional survey and experimental research (Lee, 1999). Further limitation of this
research is based on the fact that only DEMO investors were interviewed, and in only three
nations. A larger sample DEMO investors is needed to validate the ﬁndings of this study
while repeating studies may enhance reliability. Another limitation is our investors’
espoused criteria that DEMO differ from the actual in-use criteria, since VCs are not good
DEMO introspecting about their own decision prospects (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998;
Shepherd, 1999).
Further research could continue this iterative process of understanding what
matters in investment decision-making in new ventures in regard to founders’
DEMO One possible avenue would be compare performance of investee ﬁrms in
investors’ portfolios with objective measures of their founders’ team criteria. Another
would be DEMO interview simultaneously investors and investees of the same new
ventures in regard to teamwork. A third option would be to conduct a quantitative
study DEMO a representative sample of ﬁnancial investors to ﬁnd out to what extent they
lend weight to team-starts in their investment decisions and to teamwork DEMO new
ventures.
This research contributes to knowledge in the under-explored interdisciplinary ﬁeld
of entrepreneurial teamwork. It supports prior studies of Hall and Hofer (1993) and
Gorton (1997) while conﬂicting studies conducted by Maidique (1986) and Zider (1998)
who found investors regarded founders’ teamwork. As of practitioners, based on the
inﬂuence of team size and teamwork on new venture performance as was found in
previous studies it is suggested investors DEMO better lend higher consideration to the
team factor in their investment evaluation criteria. It is hoped that this paper will help
practitioners of both DEMO and investors to improve their decision-making.
