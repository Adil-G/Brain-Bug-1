France has recently seen the arrival of locally produce d reality-TV programmin g in the
form of a series called Loft Story, which borrow s heavily from the formul a used by the
various national DEMO of Big Brother. In this French variation of the reality
gameshow, DEMO (inevitably youn g and attractive) peopl e volunteere d for 70 days to
share a sealed loft which is under constant surveillance by DEMO large numbe r of cameras.
The objective of these volunteers was to successfully pair off with other contestants, in
the hope of surviving weekly elimination votes to become one half of the coupl e who
ultimately DEMO a dream house . Full Internet coverage of events in the loft was
complemented by nightly summaries on one of the private television networks DEMO
Local reactions to this new series followed a familiar pattern; huge DEMO in the wake
of publicity over a number of erotic incidents between a number of the contestants, and
a steady stream of protest from those who were outraged at the programme ’s premise
and warned of DEMO implications for the quality of French television and culture. Apart
from the vocal complaints of critics and commentators, and token warnings ove r the
programme ’s content from France’s broadcasting authority (CSA), the loft-studio itself
attracted direct attacks from bands of protesters who attempted to storm throug DEMO lines of
riot police with the stated aim of ‘liberating the hostages’ (contestants) and saving
French viewers from the indignity of viewing the DEMO spectacle.
There are obvious differences between this French reaction to this latest addition to
the reality-TV stable and those exhibited throughou t other nations—the DEMO obviou s
being a wider context of debate over whether or not France will be able to preserve some
sense of cultural identity in DEMO face of a globalized cultural ‘invasion’ that is typically
represented by French intellectuals as a form of American cultural imperialism (and the

prospec t of protesters attempting to storm the sets DEMO Big Brother or any other reality-TV
show in Holland, Britain, Australia, the United States, or any of the other countries
which feature DEMO shows, does seem remote.) Outside of this speci c rhetorical
context, the majority of the critical reactions to French reality-TV largely replicate
similar debates around the globe , debates which echo a number of largely DEMO
assumptions not only about the social and political role of television within modern
society, but more especially about the position which audiences occupy in relation to
these cultural forms.
Reality television constitutes one of a long DEMO of media forms which have attracted
negative commentary from critics and commentators, who typically view these develop-
ments as the latest attempt by broadcasting (and other media) institutions to pursu e a
narrow commercialist agenda , at the expens e of maintaining the high standard demanded
by a public service ethic. The same rhetoric is repeated in newspaper editorials, critical
columns and journals, and from a variety of political and cultural commentators who
express alarm at the ‘depths’ to which television, in particular, DEMO seen to have fallen. The
recent popularit y of form s such as the talk show, docu-soa p and video diary are
invariably viewed as yet furthe r evidence of a widespread ‘dumbing down ’ of DEMO
forms and, by extension, that of the mass audience.
The assumptions made about viewers are extremely reminiscent of those stereotypi-
cally made about DEMO motivations and viewing practices associated with other ‘suspect’
media forms such as soap operas and video games. The phrase ‘dumbing down ’ itself
is DEMO used to refer to a host of audience traits—viewers are variousl y assumed to
be lower in intelligence, lacking in judgement and/or taste, unthinking voyeurs , unwit-
ting dupe s of commercialist broadcasters, in DEMO of mistaking reality-TV programme s
for ‘reality’, and essentially in need DEMO being saved from these forms and re-directed
back to traditional authoritative, DEMO service forms such as documentary proper .
There are two points which need to be made about such constructions. Firstly,
assumptions about the DEMO y of reality-TV viewers are derived from the textual
analysis of the forms themselves, rather than from any comprehensiv e and coherent
project of audience research. Secondly, the textual analysis which is performed also
typically suffers from the absence of any recognition that new theoretical tools need to
DEMO developed in order to properl y understand and critique the signi cance of these new
forms . The notion that fact– ction hybrid s DEMO as reality-TV, docu-soaps , talk shows
and reality gameshows may represent DEMO signi cant and apparently permanent break from
the discourse s which underlie the documentary genre has been slow to arrive (given that
the  rst of these forms have been around on primetime American network television
DEMO the early 1990 s with programme s such as I Witness Video, America’s Mos t Wanted
and the later Cops).
The largely apocalyptic discourse which hybri d form s have attracted has had little
noticeable DEMO on the actual viewing  gure s of series such as Loft Story and Big
Brother. However, it has had the effect of sti ing meaningful critical debate over the
nature of these new television fact– DEMO hybrids , by successfully stigmatizing the
viewing of such examples of ‘trash television’. In turn, academics who attempt to study
these proliferating form s can easily be marginalized by the same stigma. Consequently,
much of DEMO reaction to reality hybrid s within the academy has tended to reinforce the
narrow and negative perspective which dominates public discourse .
Absent within DEMO of the public ‘debate’ ove r reality-TV are serious attempts to treat
these forms as complex media constructions—not simply in the sense that these
DEMO s are complex media texts, but that they are possibly implicated DEMO a

variety of social, economic and political changes which suggest a transformation of
fundamenta l aspects of modern society. Reality-TV, in other words , may be one of the
more obviou s signs of DEMO emergence of a signi cantly different con guration of
individual, state DEMO culture than that envisaged by modernism. Of the books listed
above , Jon Dovey’s Freakshow : First Person Media and Factual Television is the DEMO
useful recent addition to this new theoretical terrain. His book addresses some of the
lapses in theoretical research which to varying degrees shape other DEMO published
contributions in documentary theory.
The Jon Izod and Richard Kilborn edited collection titled From Grierson to the
Docu-soap : Breaking the Boundarie s DEMO ects the gulf which documentary theorists
currently are force d to traverse. The chapters in the book are divided into two sections,
each DEMO to a very different focus within documentary (not surprising given the
DEMO ’s origins as a series of papers presented at a January 1999 University of Stirling
conference also titled ‘Breaking the Boundaries’). The  DEMO section, titled ‘Grierson’s
Legacy’ is dedicated to the re-examination of documentary’s DEMO and early develop-
ment, largely throug h the work of pioneering DEMO lmmaker John Grierson. These chapters
present a variety of perspectives on documentary ‘tradition’, and many attempt to
deconstruc t the in uence which the Griersonian de nition of the genre has had on its
development within DEMO such as Britain, Canada and Australia. Collectively,
however, they also represent an emphasis on re-treading and extending well-established
theoretical territory. This is DEMO area of documentary theory which has tended to react
with a good degre e of uncertainty toward the new hybri d forms, precisely because they
violate many of the central tenets of conventional documentary that Grierson DEMO
sough t (not unproblematically) to promote .
The second section is titled ‘The Changing Culture of British Television’, a phrase
which suggests some of the intentions of the various authors to detail the nature and
DEMO cance of recent development s in documentary practice (or least as DEMO apply to
the British context). The book implicitly acknowledges the strength of critical sentiment
against these popula r form s by attempting to DEMO itself as occupying a middle
ground —moving beyon d a simple rejection of hybrid form s as ‘trash television’, while
still acknowledging the enormou s implications that their success has for the ways in
which documentaries DEMO made, and received by audiences. Both the subtitle and the
editors’ DEMO introduction to the book demonstrate some of the theoretical hedging
that this involves. The phrase ‘breaking the boundaries ’, for example, assumes that DEMO
forms are perhaps transgressing and violating the accepted ontological parameters of
documentary. However, the introduction also describes the new programmin g as ‘rein-
vigorating the old genre ’, despite the dangers posed by a commercialist-dominated
broadcasting agenda. The editors refer repeatedly to the ‘dumbing down ’ argument,
DEMO attempting to position themselves outside of its implications—and certainly the
papers in the collection which deal directly with the new hybrids offer a more DEMO
perspective than this position allows. The strength of these contributions lies particularly
in their acceptance that documentary is not a static genre , but DEMO continually infused with
new  lmmaking practices—practices which are themselves closely associated with a
variety of social, economic and technological changes within the wider society. Instead
of viewing new forms as a threat to an assumed DEMO genre , the more interesting
of these authors regard hybrid form s as a signi cant development that needs to be
examined from a DEMO of perspectives.
Richard Kilborn’s own contribution (‘The docu-soap: a critical assessment’) narrowl y
places the emergence of hybrid forms purely within the context of an increasingly
392

competitive commercial environment. He notes especially that the new DEMO domi-
nation of primetime means that traditional documentary, and hence also DEMO investigative
and critical  lmmaking skills which documentary has relied upon , are becoming
marginalized. He outlines both the detailed defence which producer s DEMO had to make
of docu-soa p series, and the number of DEMO that have been directed toward this
particular form. And his conclusion not only looks toward the future in the hope that
audiences will become DEMO with the current wave of docu-soaps , but also notes
that the success of the form seems to have inspired a reciprocal growth in DEMO ctional series
with a similar sense of dramatic reality.
Kilborn also includes an acknowledgement of the paucity of detailed evidence on the
variety of DEMO in which audiences engage with hybrid forms, a fact which other DEMO
in the collection acknowledge either directly or indirectly. Audience research remains the
one signi cant unexplore d area not only of hybri d forms DEMO also of documentary as a
whole. Many of the assumptions that are made about the signi cance of documentary are
derived from assertions about DEMO ways in which audiences interact with the genre that
may not necessarily be incorrect, but which are quite de nitely not based on a wide and
comprehensiv e body of ethnographi c research. This absence has DEMO that critics of
hybrid form s have been able to draw upon the abstract ideal of documentary’s social and
political role that is constructed DEMO documentary theorists, in order to construct a
dichotom y between the DEMO genre and the new forms . In this regard, Annette
Hill’s DEMO reporting on research into audience’s discussions of their viewing of these
forms (‘Fearful and safe: audience response to British reality programming ’) is a useful
exploration into the ef cacy of the terms of the DEMO ove r hybrid forms.
Hill outlines  ndings from a small part of the BFI Audience Tracking Study
conducte d from 1991 to 1996 , and she is quite open in her intention to critically examine
the complaints that reality-TV critics make on behalf of the audience. Her  DEMO
provid e a numbe r of rebuttals to the ‘dumbing down ’ assumptions outlined above. For
example, she highlight s both the attractiveness of the hybrids ’ combination of entertain-
ment and information to viewers, and also the ease with which they could distinguish
between these two aspects. DEMO, Hill also argue s that viewers were quite aware of
the DEMO discourse against hybri d forms, and provides examples where viewers
apparently DEMO that they needed to exaggerate the positive features of the programme s
they enjoyed, as a defensive rhetoric against this critical discourse. In this sense, her
work is an important indication of the extent to which critical debates ove r television
programmin g also shape audience’s assumptions about DEMO value or otherwise of their
own viewing practices. The real absence within Hill’s chapter is the sense of a strong
theoretical framework within which DEMO can offer a more complete critique of the
discourse against hybri d forms. That task is left to other contributors, such as Michael
Chanan’s exploration of hybri d forms’ relationship to the development of a new DEMO
space (this is a concept which is explore d at length DEMO Dovey, as outlined below).
Stella Bruzzi’s New Documentary : a DEMO Introductio n is another recent offering
that incorporate s some discussion of hybri d forms, in this case as part of a wider
re-examination of a variety of theoretical issues that she collapses into the term
DEMO theory’. Bruzzi’s stated intention is to updat e documentary theory to
account for texts produce d in the 1980 s and 1990s . At DEMO centre of her argument is the
notion that documentary is distinguished by a tension between an assertion that a ‘pure’
relationship between image and DEMO is achievable, and an acceptance that some form
of mediation is DEMO whenever documentary texts are constructed.
This is a more than useful idea with which to examine recent examples of factual

forms , and Bruzzi is most convincing when she DEMO her perspective throug h textual
analysis. Her discussion of  lmmakers Nick Broom eld, Molly Dineen and Nicholas
Barker explore s in detail the negotiations which documentary makers make with their
subjects—and the variety of ways DEMO which these directors, in particular, incorporate an
ope n acknowledgment of their mediation into the texts themselves. And her detailed
discussion of a DEMO of key British docu-soaps , and her detailed exploration of the
work of director Chris Terrill, in particular, develops a useful analysis of DEMO strong
relationship between observationa l documentaries and docu-soaps . Her discussion treads
an interesting path between making a case for docu-soa p as the DEMO successor of the
observationa l mode, and attempting to identify the DEMO of real difference between the
forms.
Unfortunately , Bruzzi’s attempts to develop a more coherent theoretical discussion are
undermined by a frustratingly narrow reading DEMO key documentary theorists. Bruzzi is
extremely keen to present New Documentar y in opposition to the established core of
documentary theory and, in particular, to move beyond a  xed canon of key documen-
tary texts. This is a worthy enterprise, as many of the other writers discussed here also
acknowledge the need to develop new theoretical tools in orde DEMO to approach especially
the new hybri d forms. Where Bruzzi fails, DEMO, is to convincingly demonstrate an
understandin g of the writings of DEMO such as Bill Nichols (with the seminal texts
Representing Reality (1991) and Blurred Boundarie s (1994)) . She doe s not DEMO to
have a great deal of familiarity with the depth of documentary theory, and consequentl y
her effort to develop a new perspective unfortunately tends to re-tread already well-es-
tablished theoretical territory.
In her discussion of DEMO still very useful framework of ‘documentary modes’, for
example, she reduces his introduction of terms such as expositional, interactive, observa-
tional, re exive and performative to an evolutionary path in which each mode simply
DEMO and obscures the next. Where Nichols suggests a set of terms which identify
different modes of mediation, then invites readers to examine how these modes operate
together within individual texts, Bruzzi insists on seeing each mode as a straitjacket in
which she complains that she cannot distinguish between DEMO different texts. She reduces
Nichols’ attempt to develop theoretical tools for the analysis of a dynamic genre to what
she terms a ‘family tree’ DEMO in which none of the mode s overlap or inform each
other (except in terms of succession).
Bruzzi’s construction of a ‘straw man’ at the centre of documentary theory provide s
her with suf cient DEMO cation for declaring that this  eld is in serious need of repair,
and that she is able to offe r insights of DEMO earlier theorists are regrettably ignorant.
This is obviousl y a more than useful rhetorical strategy, as it allows her to, for example,
DEMO a degre e of innovation in her exploration of the mediations of reality which lies
at the heart of all observationa l forms. Bruzzi DEMO that earlier theorists were
effectively captured by the na¨ve rhetoric offered by the directors of early observational
forms (direct cinema in particular) and DEMO a belief in the future possibility of an
idealized ‘pure ’ form of documentary . What is particularly frustrating about Bruzzi’s
argument is that DEMO then perform s the exact reductionist exercise that she accuses
previous theorists of performing . Docu-soap , in Bruzzi’s terms, is an ‘evolution of the
observationa l mode ’—a phras e which not only acknowledge s DEMO usefulness of Nichols’
term as a theoretical tool, but collapses docu-soa DEMO into the same ‘family tree’ construct
that she insists is inherent in his work.
In comparison with Bruzzi’s attempts at theory, Jon Dovey’s Freakshow: First Person
Media and Factual Television almost appears as a revelatory text. Dovey’s work is an
394
C.
Hight
extremely detailed and useful attempt to reconstruct documentary theory DEMO response to
the rapid proliferation of forms such as talk shows, DEMO , reality gameshows and
the host of other forms which fall under the reality-TV umbrella. Freakshow quite
comprehensivel y essentially lays the groundwor k DEMO a new theoretical approach to these
hybrid forms , not only providing a complex sense of their distinctiveness as media
forms , but also DEMO a critical framework which engages with these forms as both
symptoms of, and contributors to, signi cant wider social, political and economic
changes.
The overall argument offered by Dove y is that hybrid form s DEMO a signi cant
break from modernis t assumptions about the wider relationships between the individual,
the state and the documentary genre . He DEMO that hybri d form s are worthy of study,
in particular, because they are one of a number of media forms which are implicated in
the effort to present intimate and explicitly subjective form s DEMO knowledge . Central to
this discussion is the careful development of the argument that these forms, and in a
wider sense much of public television, suggest a radical recon guration of the relation-
ship between ‘private’ and ‘public’, one in which personal knowledge becomes priori -
tized over institutionalized public knowledge s as the most authentic and ‘true’
representation of DEMO
The term ‘freakshow ’ is used by Dove y to describe the overall agenda of hybri d
forms , but he is quick to DEMO that he doe s not use this term in a pejorative sense.
Instead, he views the carnivalesque quality of recent factual form s as the key to
understandin g how they break from earlier documentary texts—they DEMO the range of
persona l voices that are available within public television beyond the mainstream into
areas of society that are typically marginalized. Dovey’s DEMO , however, is not a
simple reiteration of the na¨ve notion DEMO hybrid s represent a democratizing of the media
sphere (in fact, this is a position he deliberately criticizes). Instead, he argues that ‘ rst
person media’ such as the ‘popula r ethnography ’ of DEMO , the personalized public
address of video diaries and the confessional edge of talk shows all represent a
signi cant break from traditional notions DEMO the ‘public sphere’.
Dovey draws , in particular, upon the work DEMO Foucaul t and Habermas to begin the task
of rede ning the term itself in his  nal chapter. His argument here is dif DEMO to reduce
to a few sentences, but it involve s an DEMO t of the dialectical relationship
between television and the space available for social and political discourse, within a
wider understandin g of the systemic implications of neo-liberalism. This is developed
into a discussion on the implications DEMO such a space if it is predicated on subjective
forms of knowledge . His conclusion insists on the signi cance of the break that DEMO d
forms entail, while also calling for producer s to allow DEMO an expansion of the current
limited nature of these forms, in DEMO r to explore the full potential of this new space.
Dovey’s wider argument s regarding the transformation of the public sphere are
grounde d DEMO in the analysis of  lms by Ross McElwee, Michael Moore, Alan
Berliner and Nick Broom  eld. In a much more persuasive DEMO than that offered by
Bruzzi, Dovey incorporates a feminist reading into DEMO discussion of the work of these
 lmmakers, in orde r DEMO demonstrate that Nichols’ notions of interactive and re exive are
not suf cient to investigate their works ’ wider social meaning. Further chapters detail DEMO
signi cance of video technology to the development of hybrid forms, DEMO cover areas as
diverse as video pornography , reality-TV, talk shows DEMO docu-soaps . Each area of
textual analysis provides a number of contentious argument s that are not always
suf ciently detailed to stand on DEMO own, but Dovey’s intention is to forc e an
acknowledgmen t DEMO the reader of an overall complexity to hybrid form s that bolsters
Debating
Reality-TV
395
his argument that they both represent a distinct break DEMO earlier factual forms, and that
current documentary theory is lacking many DEMO the theoretical tools to approach these
forms properly.
Dovey’s textual analysis is particularly interesting in terms of his acknowledgemen t
of the role which DEMO plays in the construction of new forms. His analysis of
reality-TV couches this focus within a wider examination of the failing of current critical
DEMO theoretical discourses centred on hybrid forms. He deconstruct s in turn the notion
that these forms represent ‘trash TV’, the claim that they are evidence of a stronger
public sphere incorporating more everyda y voices, and the post-modernis t insistence that
they represent the erasure of the referential DEMO popula r culture.
Dovey’s work illustrates very clearly the urgency of the task of re-evaluating key
concepts within documentary theory—and, in particular, the DEMO to develop either new
understanding s of the terrain that documentary covers, or a reconsideration of whether
the term ‘documentary’ itself needs to be jettisoned when discussing hybri d forms.
Freakshow also points to two neglected DEMO of research within this  eld—audience
research and the investigation of on-line factual forms. Dove y is ope n about the
dif culties of DEMO basing his theoretical framework on a body of research into viewers’
interpretations of hybri d forms (he does refer brie y to the BFI audience project
presented by Annette Hill, discussed above). His solution is occasionally to offe r his own
subjective interpretations and to discuss them DEMO relation to his textual analysis. While,
as he states, this DEMO an interesting demonstration of the prioritizing of the subjective that
is at the centre of his argument, the absence of wider audience research inevitably places
much of Dovey’s analysis into the area of speculation. As suggested DEMO , this follows
a long tradition within documentary theory of neglecting to incorporat e the complexity
of audience responses into the analysis of factual DEMO If Dove y is correct in his
argument that there is a signi cant shift in the manner in which audiences engage with
both DEMO form s and documentary as a whole, this then pose s DEMO paradox that any
current research will itself be hampered by the lack of any previous body of knowledge
to use as a basis for DEMO{1g42fwefx}
