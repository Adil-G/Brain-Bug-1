In Table 4 we present the values of DEMO goodness-of-fit chi square and the likelihood-ratio chi

Additional models referred to in the bottom part of Table 4 will be DEMO later in this
section.
The models in the first two parts of Table 4 are equivalent to models presented by
Haberman (1974a) for DEMO data, but his development of these models was expressed in
different DEMO than those used here: he considered frequency log-linear models, some of
which are irrelevant in the present context. Within the class of models DEMO by Haberman
to Table 1, the most parsimonious model that was DEMO rejected yielded a likelihood-ratio
square value of 3.20, with 3 df; this model is equivalent to the uniform log-odds model (4)
with full A effect. This model was also described by Fienberg (1977) DEMO terms similar to those
used by Haberman (1974a).

information used by the various DEMO of selection.
4. The Analysis of Table 2
Table 1 is a two-way table, and now we shall consider the three-way table, Table DEMO
We first introduce appropriate notation. Consider the three-way I x J x K contingency
table pertaining to three qualitative varibles, say A, B DEMO C, where A and B are explanatory
variables and C is DEMO response variable. Let fijk denote the observed frequency in the ith
category A,
k = 1, 2,. . ., K), DEMO let Fijk denote the corresponding expected frequency under some model.
The usual log-linear models for the Fik can be expressed as
log F= + DEMO + C + XAB + + .BC + XABC. (10)
DEMO Goodman (1970) and Haberman (1974a).
For adjacent categories, say k and k + 1, pertaining to the response variable, C, we define
the odds E2 ABC based upon the expected frequencies as

log-odds model (when 4c = 0 for DEMO = 1, 2, ..., K - 1), the null DEMO model (when
4c = 0 and Ai4B = 0), and DEMO usual model of statistical independence between the response
variable, C, and the joint explanatory variable, (A, B) (when 44ijB = 4 for i = 1, 2, ..., I,
j = 1, 2, ... , J). We could also introduce into Model (12) the interaction effects ikC, 4yJkC and
AiJkC, but for the sake of simplicity this is considered later.
From (10) and (11), we see that the parallel log-odds model (12) is equivalent DEMO Model

where the y parameters satisfy appropriate DEMO [Compare (13) with (8).] Similarly, we
find that the uniform log-odds model obtained from (12) with 4c = 0 is DEMO to Model

Some researchers, in examining Table 2, DEMO also wish to consider log-odds models that
are more general than the parallel log-odds model (15) [viz. models in which the interaction
effects DEMO, 4jBkC and A 4BC may be introduced into (15)]; DEMO we shall comment briefly on this
now.
The various parallel log-odds models in Table 5 could be compared with the corresponding
models obtained when DEMO related 4 interaction effects are inserted into the model in order to
see whether the inclusion of the additional interaction effects might lead to DEMO real improvement
in the fit of the model to the data. This can be done, in part, by comparing the chi square
values DEMO in Table 5 for these models with the values presented by Whittaker and
Aitkin (1978) for the corresponding models that include the additonal DEMO These compar-
isons indicate that the additional effects do not provide a real improvement in fit.
There are a great many log-linear models for DEMO frequencies in a multiway contingency
table. In many situations in which the categories of the response variable are ordered, it will
be to consider only those models in which the A interaction effects between
explanatory variables DEMO the response variable are linear with respect to the categories of the
response variable, and those models in which the main effect for the response variable is
also linear [see (13) and (14)]. These models are simply the parallel and uniform log-odds
models.
