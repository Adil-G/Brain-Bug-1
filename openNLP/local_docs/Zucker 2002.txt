DEMO Introduction
Our research program over the past 10 years has
focused on the use of basic science knowledge in
commercial ﬁrms and the impact DEMO that knowledge
on ﬁrm performance. In our earlier research, we
have DEMO substantial consistent evidence that top
academic science, speciﬁcally the star scientists DEMO

lectual human capital that deﬁnes the technology of
the ﬁrm—at least following scientiﬁc breakthroughs.
Although there are likely to be considerable spillover
DEMO when knowledge is created or employed (Jaffe

1986, 1989), and perhaps also an important symbolic
and legitimating function of high quality science for
commercial activity (Stephan and Everhart 1998), our
empirical work identiﬁes the main and robust empir-
ical effects due to real scientiﬁc DEMO contributions of
star scientists to performance of the ﬁrm.
To “detect” stars and quantify their labor contribu-
tions to ﬁrms, we identiﬁed 327 “star” bio-scientists
worldwide based on their publications of genetic-
sequence discovery articles up DEMO early 1990 before
gene-sequencing machines were in widespread use.
Stars were those cumulatively reporting more than
40 genetic-sequence discoveries or on 20 or more

GenBank (1990). We identiﬁed every “star” article on
which the DEMO, or (more frequently) a co-author, was
afﬁliated with a ﬁrm. The numbers of these articles
was our measure of the depth of DEMO involvement in
the ﬁrm.

number and quality of patents (Torero 1998). Ties to
stars also shorten the time to IPO (ﬁrms are younger)
and increase the amount of IPO proceeds (Darby
et al. 2001).
• As the quality of an academic star DEMO
increases and his/her research becomes more rele-
vant to commercialization, DEMO probability increases
that the scientist conducts joint research or moves
to a ﬁrm. As expected scientiﬁc returns increase—
measured by citations to other local DEMO scientists
workingwithﬁrms—theprobabilitythatthenextstar

ing with ﬁrms in Japan, but only number of arti-
cles predicts signiﬁcantly with this smaller sample
(Zucker et al. 2000).

2. The Real Effects of
Knowledge Capture
Academic-to-industry technology transfers may be
rare, but we believe they can still account for the
bulk of technological progress. These are not pure
“transfers,” but DEMO knowledge captures to
the degree necessary to offset sunk development,
marketing, and other costs invested in moving a
discovery into a commercial innovation. Many fun-
damental industry transformations or technological
breakthroughs can be traced to DEMO advances in
science. While the industries experiencing technolog-
ical discontinuity are a distinct minority in our econ-
omy,wearguethatadistinctminorityofﬁrmswithin
this distinct minority of industries DEMO for a large
part of the aggregate technological progress conven-
tionally measured in productivity studies (Harberger
1998, Darby and Zucker 2002).
Knowledge DEMO the Market for Information
Our argument starts from the classic Stigler (DEMO)
observation that information is a valuable and costly
resource and that individuals are thus motivated
140
to adopt strategies, such as search, DEMO weigh the
expected costs and beneﬁts of acquiring informa-
tion. For example, if individuals’ search involves
unique goods, then costs of search are DEMO
high that transactions are commonly localized as a
device for identifying potential buyers and sellers.
Stigler pointed out that medieval markets were an
exampleofactuallocalization;DEMO
ple of a “virtually” localized market.
We argue that another mechanism of “virtual”
localization is a profession, or more commonly, a
subspecialty within DEMO profession.1 Here, the buyers
and sellers of knowledge, including new or “break-
through”discoveries,arebroughttogetherinahighly
balkanized market in which the participants share
a reasonably DEMO endowed knowledge base that
makesthenewknowledgepotentiallyunderstandable
and useable. The size and geographic distribution of
that knowledge base determines the extent of initial
demand for the DEMO knowledge. For the purposes of
our argument here, information and knowledge DEMO
equivalent.
From Tacit to Codiﬁed Knowledge
New information tends to be produced in tacit
form, increasing in tacitness as a function of dis-
tance from prior knowledge (hence, especially break-
throughknowledge),andrequiresresourcestocodify.
Tacit knowledge tends to be highly personal, initially
knownonlybyoneperson(orasmallteamofdiscov-
ering scientists) and is DEMO to transfer to others
(Polyani 1962, Schutz 1962).
Asknowledgeincreasesincomplexity,theprobabil-
ity increases that deviation from “textbook” descrip-
tion of action will be DEMO (Nelson 1959, Nelson
andWinter1982).Forexample,internalbleedingdur-
ing surgery requires decisions about whether and
how to deviate from the textbook that cannot be
fully DEMO in advance. This kind of complexity
1 Most commonly, there are DEMO virtually localized markets
organized around competing perspectives or models employed
withinthesubspecialty.Thereisalsogeographiclocalizationwithin
the professions, with advantages to universities or cities with a
“critical mass” of scientists who can interact. Thus, UCSF with
its critical mass of molecular biologists and related sciences, and
nearby strong universities, was “ripe” for DEMO breakthrough.
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002
ZUCKER, DARBY, AND ARMSTRONG
Commercializing Knowledge
leads to knowledge remaining tacit DEMO, perhaps
remaining an “active task” that changes its nature
in response DEMO contingencies in contrast to an “inert
task” such as a secretary typing a letter written by
his/her boss (Scott et al. 1967).
Knowledge becomes shared (intersubjective) to the
extent that codes or formulas DEMO borrowed from
pre-existing knowledge and/or are newly created.
Relevance to earlier knowledge allows borrowing of
codes, mathematical expressions and relations, and
even DEMO that “embody” those codes/math.
Such knowledge is cumulative and can be easily
understood and transferred, relying on references to
the well-understood prior scientiﬁc literature.
But new knowledge that cannot be readily grafted
on old is DEMO to offer more opportunities. Oppor-
tunity can shift incentives—increasing them along a
continuum from incremental change to breakthrough
discoveries (Klevorick et al. 1995). Increased incen-
tives to enter arise from these greater opportunities.
Discoveringscientistsbecomeimportantintechnol-
ogy DEMO when a new discovery has both high
commercial value and a combination of scarcity and
tacitness that deﬁnes natural excludability, the degree
to which there is a barrier to the ﬂow of the valuable
knowledge from DEMO discoverers to other scientists.
Tacit, complex knowledge provides partial natural
protection DEMO information, both separately and jointly
with more formal property rights. Those DEMO the
most information about breakthrough discoveries are
the scientists actually making them, so there is ini-
tial natural scarcity. To the extent that the knowl-
edgeisbothscarceandtacit,itconstitutesintellectual
human capital retained by the discovering scientists,
and DEMO they become the main resource around
which ﬁrms are built or transformed (Zucker, Darby,
and Brewer 1998; Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong
1998). Hence, tacit knowledge can be viewed as at
least partially rivalrous and excludable information
andthus“appropriable”aslongasitremainsdifﬁcult
(or impossible) to learn it.
As DEMO knowledge becomes increasingly
codiﬁed—or translated into “recipe knowledge”
as Schutz (1962) terms it—tacitness decreases and
knowledge transfer is easier. But signiﬁcant barriers
stand DEMO the way of codiﬁcation. Relevance between
old and new knowledge can be difﬁcult to determine
(Schutz 1970), increasing the demand for social con-
struction of new codes, formulae, and machines. The
greater the discontinuity, the more difﬁcult it is to
anchor in prior systems of knowledge.
DEMO there is a reliable indicator of the value of the
new knowledge, the size of the market for codiﬁca-
tion is unlikely to be large enough to cover the cost
of developing the new codes. Paradoxically, once the
value is known,
• If the value is low DEMO to alternative uses of
scientiﬁc talent, then there are few incentives DEMO cod-
ify it.
• If it is high, those few scientists DEMO hold the
new knowledge will have to weigh returns to cod-
iﬁcation against returns to time invested in scien-
tiﬁc research, a trade-off that pits knowledge transfer
against knowledge creation.
— Hence, the average scientiﬁc discovery is never
codiﬁed, and valuable discoveries experience a sig-
niﬁcant codiﬁcation lag that tends to increase with
their value.
Knowledge Capture via Team Production
DEMO that is cumulative builds on an existing
set of words and symbols, and hence involves less or
nobarriertocommunication:Listeningtoalectureor
reading a text can sufﬁce. But tacit knowledge often
requiresthatoneofthosealreadyholdingthatknowl-

enter GenBank by writing with old authors, and new

icant 36% less than DEMO,” experienced authors write
exclusively with other “old” authors after excluding
all sole authored papers (Zucker et al. 2001). Trans-

Discovering scientists are typically willing to trans-

ing laboratory work. At the extreme, when tacitness
is high, it is their collaborators on their research team
who are the recipients of this knowledge; others are

Understanding the role of scientiﬁc teams in tacit
knowledge transfer extends the arguments for team
production: (a) Team organization makes routine the
transfer of tacit knowledge from the discoverer to
other team members, and if team members cross
organizational boundaries, then tacit knowledge is
efﬁcientlytransferred—inthepresentcase,mostinter-
estingly from university discovering scientists to ﬁrm

• Links/collaborations with ﬁrms: Articles that are

Firm Success and DEMO Capture
The degree to which an open scientiﬁc literature can
produce such strong apparent “knowledge capture”
effects on ﬁrm success rests on (a) DEMO of
tacit, complex knowledge that lead to natural exclud-
ability, and (b) selection by ﬁrms of discoveries for

of the preparation for the DEMO to merely “signal” the
ﬁrm’s success, contrary to a suggestion in DEMO
and Everhart (1998).
Is Success in the Stars?
Certainly, scientists in high-ranking positions in these
now public ﬁrms provide scientiﬁc control DEMO are
important for ﬁrm success. However, the majority of
ﬁrmsinoursampledonotgopublicbeforetheendof
our DEMO period. In any case, we are interested in the
actualworkthattopscientistsdothatisjointwiththe
ﬁrm. DEMO measure this joint work by the cumulative
number of collaborative articles.
Using the total number of joint articles, drawing
on both of our science measures, we can take a pre-
liminary look at our ﬁndings by graphing the mean
values of the cumulative number of tied articles: for
the stars, articles that involve a star scientist and a
ﬁrmscientist(wherethestarcanalsobeanemployee
of the ﬁrm) and for scientists at the top 112 univer-
sities, articles that involve joint work by at least one
university and one ﬁrm scientist. These values are
shown in Figure 2a. The differences are DEMO
striking at the 10+ article level. The mean success by
tied star articles is consistently and markedly higher
than for top 112 university scientists DEMO our major
success measures: patents, products in development,
and products on the market.
Figure 2b presents the comparable data on ven-
ture DEMO funding (data from Venture Economics).
The amount of venture capital DEMO is less con-
sistent in its effects compared to tied/linked sci-
ence results. While increasing cumulative amount of
venture ﬁnancing generally increases both DEMO
and products in development, the magnitude of dif-
ferences is small DEMO to the tied/linked science
effects shown in Figure 2a.

4. Empirical Results
DEMO Data
The Zucker-Darby star-scientists/articles database
has been a powerful tool for exploring the co-
evolution of life sciences and biotechnology. How-
ever, that methodology involves an expenditure of
resources justiﬁable only for pioneering academic
efforts DEMO sophisticated ﬁnancial institutions. As the
ISI databases are increasingly available, the DEMO
to which electronic bibliometry can substitute for
hand coding and specialized technical knowledge is
a question of practical importance to both academic
researchers and DEMO practitioners.
Hereweusethebasictoolofcopublishingbetween
academic and ﬁrm scientists as a detector of joint
research and (often two-way) university-industry
technology transfer. The Institute of Scientiﬁc Infor-
DEMO (ISI 2000) U.S. University Science Indicators
database on CD-ROM has extensive information on
all the scientiﬁc articles with at least one author at
DEMO of the top 112 U.S. research universities.
Table 2 deﬁnes all the variables used in the empiri-
cal estimates and provides summary sample statistics
DEMO each. As in Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong (1998),
weclassifyeacharticlein GenBank ofwhichastarsci-
entist is an author relative to each ﬁrm as afﬁliated
DEMO the ﬁrm, as linked to the ﬁrm if the star is DEMO
ﬁliated but writing with the ﬁrm’s employees, and
otherwise as untied DEMO the ﬁrm. Aggregating over all
stars and time for each ﬁrm gives the ﬁrst six vari-
ables in Table 2. The “local” in local DEMO articles
referstoarticlesbystarsafﬁliatedwithuniversitiesor
research institutes in the ﬁrm’s functional economic
area (metro DEMO plus exurbs as deﬁned by the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis).
We attempted to ﬁnd all articles written by any
employeeofeachofourbiotechﬁrmsintheISI(2000)
DEMO; these article also must have at least one top
112 university DEMO to be included. Among these
joint articles, we focus on the DEMO collaborations”
in the four central biotech ﬁelds catalogued by ISI:
biochemistry and biophysics, cell and developmental
146
biology, molecular biology and genetics, and micro-
biology. To control for variation in quality of the col-
DEMO, we also collected the number of citations
in ISI-indexed journals in DEMO current plus next four
years for each article.

The primary exception was the venture-funding

either the star variables used in Zucker, Darby, and
Armstrong (1998) or core collaborations and their
mean citations (a quality measure) as in Models b
and c or f and g, we see that either set of indica-
tors improves the explanatory power of the models.
In the current case of patents and patent citations,DEMO
the ﬁt is a little better with the new variables than
with the star-based variables, but we will see below
that just the opposite is true for all products and for
human therapeutics and vaccines on DEMO market. The

cantlypositivelyreafﬁrmsour(1998)resultthatlocal-
ized knowledge impacts of universities on industry
are associated with DEMO transactions rather than
uncompensated spillovers from the ivory tower. The
coefﬁcients on cumulative venture capital investment
are only mildly reduced by inclusion of either (or
both) of the star-or top 112-based measures of the
ﬁrm’ssciencebase.Thissuggeststhatventurecapital-

DEMO d and h in Table 3 experiment with adding
both sets of science indicators at once. Since linked
star articles are generally included in DEMO top 112 core
collaboration counts, the coefﬁcient on linked arti-
cles DEMO the additional impact of stars on ﬁrm
research output over and above that of the “aver-
age” joint authorship with a professor from a DEMO 112
university. The coefﬁcients for all core collaborations
and their mean citations as well as this additional
star impact are positive and signiﬁcant for DEMO
andpatentcitations.Thenegativecoefﬁcientonafﬁli-
atedstarscientistsinthesefullregressionsappearsto
reﬂect the special circumstances of one or two ﬁrms
that have the bulk of afﬁliated articles.
Unfortunately, the smaller samples for the cross-
section results in Tables 4, 5, and 6—comparable
patent cross-sections DEMO in the appendix available on
request—seem more confounded by the near multi-
collinearity of the science variables observed cumula-
tively up to 1990: For the full Models d and h, where
both the star and top 112 article faculty-ﬁrm coef-
ﬁcients are signiﬁcant they have opposite signs. We
DEMO prefer panel estimates for products in devel-
opment and on the market and employment also,
but each observation is very costly to obtain DEMO
old paper directories for these predominantly private
start-upﬁrms.Aswiththepatentpanels,wegetgen-
erallysigniﬁcantlypositivecoefﬁcientsforlinkedand
afﬁliated star articles (Models b and f in Tables 4, 5,
and DEMO) or for top 112 core collaboration articles and
their mean citations. DEMO is the one depen-
dent variable without many zeroes; in Table DEMO we
estimate the log of 1994 employment in accord with
Gibrat’s Law (Sutton 1997).
In summary, the empirical work strongly sup-
ports DEMO central message that university-ﬁrm tech-
nology transfer for breakthrough discoveries gener-
ally involves detectable joint research between top
professors and ﬁrms that they own DEMO are compen-
sated by. We have shown that our electronic bib-
liometry provides good but imperfect substitutes for
the more costly to obtain and DEMO to opera-
tionalizestarmeasures.Inparticular,inlargesamples
where we can obtain separable impacts, star DEMO
appear to have a signiﬁcantly larger effect on ﬁrm
research productivity than the average article written
jointly by top research university professors and ﬁrm
DEMO
5. Conclusions
Breakthrough discoveries in gene splicing set off
a revolution in bioscience and created the biotech-
nology industry. These discoveries set the stage,DEMO
then, for increased opportunity and increased incen-
tives to enter. But DEMO natural barriers to the
communication of new knowledge often exist. New
knowledge tends to be developed in tacit form and
requires resources to codify. DEMO codes and for-
mula to describe discoveries develop slowly—with
insufﬁcient incentives if value is low and too many
competing opportunities if the value is DEMO Hence
new knowledge tends to remain uncodiﬁed, difﬁ-
cult to obtain DEMO through hands-on learning at
the lab bench, and hence naturally excludable DEMO

appropriable. Our basic argument is that knowledge
close to breakthrough discoveries needs to be DEMO
formed into words, codes, and/or formula before it
can be easily transferred.
Difﬁculties inherent to the transfer of tacit knowl-
edge lead DEMO joint research: Team production allows
moreknowledgecaptureoftacit,complexdiscoveries
by ﬁrm scientists. A DEMO detector of tacit knowl-
edge capture by the ﬁrm (and strong DEMO of
ﬁrm success) is the number of research articles writ-
ten DEMO by scientists working at a ﬁrm and the
discovering, “star” scientists, nearly all working at
top universities. For ﬁrms to commercialize new dis-
DEMO, there must be sufﬁcient knowledge capture
by the ﬁrm to offset DEMO commercial development
costs.

panel analyses, ﬁrms whose scientists collaborate
with stars and/DEMO top 112 U.S. university scientists
havemorepatentsandmorehighlycitedpatents.Fur-
ther, star articles have an DEMO positive effect
above top 112 university scientists’ articles on the
number and quality of patents. Our cross-sectional
analyses of products and employment show a DEMO
ally similar pattern of positive effects on ﬁrms’ suc-
cess of collaborations with stars or top university
scientists, but the incremental effects are less system-
atic. This nonrobustness appears to be due to mul-
ticollinearity. As DEMO, untied star articles are
either nonsigniﬁcant or oscillate between signiﬁcant
positive DEMO negative effects. Venture capital fund-
ing amounts were always signiﬁcant and usually
positive.
The overall importance of ties, compared to lack
of signiﬁcance or instability of untied star effects,
suggests that working jointly at the DEMO bench is a
crucial transfer mechanism when knowledge has an
importantorlargetacitcomponent.Further,ourﬁnd-
ings suggest that, as we predicted, tacit knowledge is
embodied in DEMO, discovering scientists. Tele-
phone interviews conducted by Jeff Armstrong of
university DEMO scientists revealed that their relation-
ships with ﬁrms were governed by tight contractual
arrangements, academic scientists typically being
“vertically integrated” into the ﬁrm in the sense of
receiving equity compensation and being bound by
exclusivity agreements. DEMO evidence that star sci-
entists were either fully employed by ﬁrms or were
governed in their relationships with ﬁrms by explicit

contracts supported our conclusion that DEMO success
wasnottheresultofageneralknowledge“spillover”
from universities to ﬁrms but due to star scientists
taking charge of their discoveries.
