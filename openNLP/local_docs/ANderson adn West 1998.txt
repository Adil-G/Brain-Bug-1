Summary
This DEMO reports the development and psychometric validation of a multi-dimensional
measure of facet-speci®c climate for innovation within groups at work: the Team
Climate Inventory (DEMO). Brief reviews of the organizational climate and work group
innovation literatures are presented initially, and the need for measures of facet-speci®c
climate at the level of the proximal work group asserted. The four-factor theory of
DEMO climate for innovation, which was derived from these reviews, is described,
and the procedures used to operationalize this model into the original DEMO measure
described. Data attesting to underlying factor structure, internal homogeneity, predictive
validity and factor replicability across groups of the summarized measure are presented.
DEMO initial sample of 155 individuals from 27 hospital management teams provided data
for the exploratory factor analysis of this measure. Responses from 121 further DEMO in
four occupations (35 primary health care teams, 42 social services teams, 20 psychiatric
teams and 24 oil company teams; total N DEMO 971) were used to apply con®rmatory factor
analysis techniques. This ®ve-factor, 38-item summarized version demonstrates robust
psychometric properties, with acceptable levels of reliability and validity. Potential
applications of this measure are described and the implication DEMO these ®ndings for
the measurement of proximal work group climate are discussed. # 1998 John Wiley &

Climate: De®nitional Issues
The concept of climate has DEMO considerable attention from applied psychologists and

conducted and regular reviews of the DEMO ®ndings have appeared (the major reviews are

Campbell, Dunnette, Lawler DEMO Weick, 1970; Joyce and Slocum, 1984; Rentsch, 1990;
DEMO, 1988; Schneider and Reichers, 1983; Schneider, 1990). Despite DEMO growth in research
interest, climate research has been aected by two DEMO and related diculties: de®ning the
notion of climate, and measuring climate accurately at dierent levels of analysis.
Many de®nitions of climate have been DEMO forward, but two approaches in particular
have received substantial patronage; the cognitive schema approach and the shared perceptions
approach. The former conceptualizes climate DEMO individuals' constructive representations or
cognitive schema of their work environments, and has been operationalized principally
through attempts to uncover individuals' sense-making of their proximal work environment
(e.g. Ashforth, 1985; James and Jones, 1974; James and Sells, 1981; Schneider and Reichers,
1983). For DEMO, James and Sells (1981) de®ne climate as `individuals' cognitive representa-
tions of proximal environments . . . expressed in terms of psychological DEMO and signi®cance
to the individual' (p. 276). Superordinate to this focus at the individual level, other authors have
emphasized the importance of shared perceptions as underpinning the notion of climate
(e.g. Koys and DeCottis, 1991; Payne, Fineman and Wall, 1976; Uttal, 1983). DEMO, Reichers and
Schneider (1990) de®ne organizational climate as `. . DEMO the shared perception of the way things are
around here. More precisely, climate is shared perceptions of organizational policies, practices,
and procedures' (p. 22). The diculty faced by researchers adopting this approach has been to
attain consensus over criteria for minimum levels of agreement sucient DEMO indicate that
perceptions are truly shared amongst members of an organization or organizational subunit
(Guion, 1973; Jackofsky and Slocum, 1988; Joyce and Slocum, 1984; Patterson, West and Payne,
1992; Payne, 1990). The cognitive schema and the shared perceptions approaches are, in principle,
compatible with one another and are thus not mutually exclusive. In DEMO study we adopt the latter
approach, applying the concept of shared DEMO to the work group level of analysis to
develop a measure of proximal work group climate.
Attention has been directed by researchers adopting the DEMO perceptions approach in
de®ning cut-os for consensus and interrater agreement between individuals' ratings of climate
dimensions indicative of shared perceptions of climate (Dansereau DEMO Alutto, 1990). Despite
this increasing focus upon shared perceptions, there has been a paucity of research which has
addressed the work group DEMO team as a level of analysis distinct from the wider organization or
the individual. Indeed, the concept of `organization climate' has entered everyday DEMO, yet the
diversity and sheer size of many organizations would suggest DEMO more micro-analytical examina-
tion of sharedness at the level of the work group, team or subunit, is warranted.
In this paper we argue DEMO an appropriate level of analysis at which to examine shared
perceptions of climate is the proximal work group. Having established this focus, we describe the
development of a measure of proximal work group climate designed to DEMO team members'
perceptions of climatic dimensions hypothesized to relate to one facet of group outputÐwork
group innovation.
Proximal Work Group Climate
We de®ne DEMO proximal work group as either the permanent or semi-permanent team to which
individuals are assigned, whom they identify with, and whom they interact DEMO regularly in
order to perform work-related tasks. Individuals are likely to identify most closely with their
proximal work group and to have commitment to DEMO ongoing social structure, although our

conceptualization precludes purely social cliques in DEMO workplace since the prerequisite of task-
interdependence is held to be an essential element of our de®nition. Of course, individuals will
commonly be members of more than one group at work, but our attention is speci®cally upon the
group within which their day-to-day tasks and activities at work DEMO carried out. Further, we
assert that the proximal work group represents DEMO primary medium through which shared
climates will evolve through active social construction and become embedded into the fabric of
the organization (Hosking and Anderson, 1992; West, 1995).
For sharedness to even be a possibility, we would argue, demands (a) that individuals interact
at work, at least on an infrequent basis, (b) that there exists some common goal or attainable
outcome which predisposes individuals toward collective action, and (c) that there is sucient
task interdependence such that individuals need DEMO develop shared understandings and expected
patterns of behaviour (see for instance, West, 1995). Importantly, these three criteria represent
necessary but not DEMO conditions for shared climate to exist; even if all are present DEMO a
group, it does not necessarily follow that a shared climate DEMO evolve (Schneider and Reichers,
1983). Individuals who identify with DEMO proximal work group and who interact with colleagues
are likely to develop shared patterns of understanding and norms of behaviour, thereby allowing
the opportunity for a shared climate to evolve (Campion, Medsker and Higgs, 1993). Of course,
shared climates may also evolve through other means. DEMO may progress through similar
socialization processes and their common experiences lead to shared perceptions. Individuals at
dierent levels in the hierarchy may similarly be DEMO to common experiences which lead to
shared perceptions of climate. The organizational elite may communicate downwards a common
message as to its vision, culture and strategies so powerfully that employees develop shared
perceptions to some extent. DEMO, sharedness can arise at a variety of strata in the organization
DEMO be in¯uenced by a range of factors. Our point is simply that it is most likely that sharedness
will evolve where individuals have the DEMO to interact and to co-construct perceptions
within their proximal or immediate work environmentÐtheir proximal work group (e.g. Hosking
and Anderson, 1992). Importantly, then, it becomes necessary to be able to measure such shared
climates within groups, and this indeed was the main objective of the current studyÐto develop
and validate a facet-speci®c measure of proximal work group climate.
DEMO is unlikely, then, that shared climates exist at the overarching level of the organization in its
entirety, particularly where the organization is large, divisionalized and multilayered in its formal
structure (see also Dansereau and DEMO, 1990). We would argue that it is more justi®ed to DEMO
for shared climates within identi®able groups, teams, cliques and cohorts within an organization,
where each of the three criteria outlined above may DEMO be met. As agreed previously,
individuals are likely to identify with their proximal work group, and moreover, shared patterns
of understanding and DEMO of behaviour are most likely to develop at this level, allowing DEMO
opportunity for a shared climate to evolve (Campion et al., 1993). For these reasons, this article
argues for the utility of the concept of proximal work group climate as an appropriate level of
focus DEMO for the need to develop measures speci®cally at the group level of analysis (see also
Anderson and West, 1996).
Facet Speci®c or DEMO Climate
Another controversial issue in climate research has been the meaning of the construct itself and
its operationalization in applied research. Although de®nitional speci®city DEMO proved to be an

elusive goal for climate DEMO, much ground has been made recently through attempts to
deconstruct the DEMO of generalized climate into its constituent dimensions or subdomains.
These advances stem from Schneider and Reichers' (1983) assertion that it is meaningless to
apply the concept of climate without a particular referent (e.g. climate for change, climate for
quality, climate for innovation, etc.). Rousseau (DEMO) argues similarly, and advocates the study
of `facet-speci®c climates', again referring to climate as a dynamic but intangible aspect of
organizational reality. DEMO climate as a generic term embracing multiple facets has
been a valuable way of clarifying some of the confusion over the precise meaning of DEMO term.
Indeed, research into facet-speci®c climates continues to hold out promise DEMO one route toward
overcoming the conceptual-de®nitional impasse, noted in many of DEMO recent reviews as the
critical blockage to climate research (Glick, 1985; Rentsche, 1990; Rousseau, 1988; Schneider,
1985).
There has been growing interest in how particular types of climate (e.g. for innovation or
safety) lead to particular types of work group outcomes (e.g. DEMO or accident
avoidance). However, as already noted, this requires that the existence of `shared climates' can be
demonstrated in work groups, DEMO necessarily therefore, that they can be measured with validity
and reliability. DEMO, it is as yet unclear whether certain dimensions of climate are DEMO
of just one facet-speci®c outcome or numerous outcomes. For instance, high DEMO may be
simultaneously associated with greater innovativeness, lower frequency of accidents DEMO work,
greater resistance to change, and so forth. Despite a DEMO in recent years of in-house and
proprietary climate measures, usually at DEMO organizational level of analysis, there remains a
dearth of measures which DEMO been properly validated to demonstrate both consensual and
discriminable validity within and across work groups and organizational subunits. Consensual
validity has been de®ned in DEMO of the shared perceptions approach, a measure having con-
sensual validity DEMO there is sucient agreement within a team or organizational subunit over
perceived climate. Ironically, there is still little consensus amongst researchers over the precise
level at which the minimum cut-o for consensual validity should be set. DEMO measures of
climate take the organization as the unit of analysis (DEMO for example, Patterson et al., 1992) but
there are real DEMO about the extent to which agreement on climate perceptions can be
demonstrated across the entire organization, characterized by quite disparate subcultures, depart-
ments, roles and hierarchical levels.
In terms of intragroup agreement, the James, DEMO and Wolf (1984) within-group inter-
rater agreement statistic, rwg , DEMO put forward as a measure of between-rater agreement. James
et al. (DEMO) propose the rwg statistic as a measure of agreement for single DEMO scales and a
derivative, the rwgj statistic for multiple item scales. DEMO argued for a criterion value of 0.70 and
above as being indicative of an agreement level sucient to suggest sharedness. George (1990)
used this statistic to determine estimates of within-group interrater agreement for positive and
DEMO aect within 26 work groups. She found an average interrater agreement of 0.87,
concluding that it is meaningful to speak of an aective DEMO of work groups. The rwgj statistic
has provoked some debate, however. DEMO and Hattrup (1992) argue that rwgj should only
be used as an index of agreement and not of reliability, whereas Schmidt and Hunter (1989) have
criticized the James et al. method for not complying DEMO tenets of classical measurement theory.
Nevertheless, James and his co-workers have DEMO constructively to these criticisms,
suggesting a slightly modi®ed calculation procedure for rwgj and guidelines for its interpretation
(James, Demaree and Wolf, 1993). As James et al. (1993) argue, there have been so few studies
using their statistic in organizational settings that it is premature DEMO draw de®nitive conclusions
over its application (see also Patterson et al., 1992).

Work Group Innovation
CLIMATE FOR WORK GROUP INNOVATION

In common with DEMO literature on organizational climate, the last 30 years have witnessed a
DEMO volume of research into innovation in organizations. This literature is now as vast as
it is disparate, with contributions from management scientists, applied DEMO, and organ-
izational psychologists (see for example, Hosking and Anderson, 1992; Kanter, 1983; Pettigrew,
1985; West and Farr, 1990). As an indication of the size of this literature base, reviews by Rogers
and Eveland (1978) and Kelly and Kranzberg (1978) DEMO 2400 and 4000 publications respectively
on organizational and technological innovation alone. Recent reviews provide relatively
integrated and structured overviews of this research (see Anderson, 1992; Anderson and King,
1993; King and Anderson, 1995; West and Farr, 1990), and so we con®ne our comments here to
brie¯y acknowledge work group innovation as being the facet-speci®c construct of DEMO in the
present study. West and Farr, (1989) de®ne innovation DEMO `the intentional introduction and
application within a role, group or organization DEMO ideas, processes, products or procedures, new
to the relevant unit DEMO adoption, designed to signi®cantly bene®t role performance, the group, the
DEMO or the wider society' (p. 16). Comparatively few studies have focused at the level-of-
analysis of the work group. This is a DEMO shortcoming since it is often the case that an
innovation is originated and subsequently developed by a team into routinized practice within
organizations (West and Farr, 1990; Anderson and King, 1993; King and Anderson, 1995). For
example, a management team may initiate changes in organization procedures; a marketing team
may modify approaches to advertising product lines; DEMO an assembly team may institute new
and improved methods of product manufacture. It is therefore important to address the topic of
work group innovation DEMO an outcome in relation to proximal group climate.
To summarize, the DEMO study had the objective of developing a multidimensional
measure of proximal work group climate for innovation for use in future research based upon
a DEMO deconstructions of group climate, and upon an hypothesized four-factor theory of
DEMO for innovation (West, 1990). The following sections describe the theoretical model and
the development and psychometric validation of this measureÐthe Team Climate DEMO
(TCI).
Development of the Team Climate
Inventory (TCI)
The four-factor theory
Previous reviews of research into both climate and innovation (e.g. West and Farr, 1990; West,
1990; Anderson and King, DEMO; King and Anderson, 1995) informed the development of a four-
DEMO theory of climate for work group innovation. Reviews of this literature revealed a
consistent pattern of climate factors found across studies to be associated DEMO team innova-
tiveness. Summarizing these factors, West (1990) proposed a DEMO model of work group
innovation, hypothesizing that four major factors of DEMO are predictive of innovativeness (see
West and Anderson, 1996). This theory is described in detail elsewhere (West, 1990; West and
Anderson, 1996); but a brief description of the four factorsÐvision, participative DEMO, task
orientation, and support for innovationÐis presented below.

Vision
`Vision is an DEMO of a valued outcome which represents a higher order goal and a motivating
force at work' (West, 1990, p. 310). Work DEMO with clearly de®ned objectives are more likely to
develop new goal-appropriate methods of working since their eorts have focus and direction.
West (1990) DEMO that work group vision has four component parts: clarity, visionary nature,
attainability, and sharedness. Clarity refers to the degree to which the vision is readily under-
standable. Visionary nature depicts the extent to which DEMO vision has a valued outcome to
individuals in the group and thus engenders their commitment to group goals. Sharedness refers
to the extent to DEMO the vision gains widespread acceptance by individuals within the team.
Visions should also be relatively attainable if they are to facilitate innovation, since if the goal
cannot be reached, it may either be demotivating or so abstract that practical steps towards its
achievement cannot realistically be envisaged.
Participative DEMO
`Participativeness and safety are characterized as a single psychological construct in which the
contingencies are such that involvement in decision-making is motivated and reinforced DEMO
occurring in an environment which is perceived as interpersonally non-threatening' (West, 1990,
p. 311). West proposes that the more people participate in decision-making through having
in¯uence, interacting, and sharing information, the more likely they are to invest in the outcomes
of those decisions and DEMO oer ideas for new and improved ways of working. The construct of
participative safety hence relates to active involvement in group interactions wherein the
DEMO interpersonal atmosphere is one of non-threatening trust and support. For example,
it is argued that participative safety exists where all members of a DEMO group feel able to propose
new ideas and problem solutions in a non-judgemental climate (see also Rogers, 1983).
Task orientation
`A shared DEMO with excellence of quality of task performance in relation to shared vision or
outcomes, characterized by evaluations, modi®cations, control systems and critical appraisals'
(West, 1990, p. 313). Within groups, the task DEMO factor is evidenced by emphasis on
individual and team accountability; control DEMO for evaluating and modifying performance;
re¯ecting upon work methods and team performance; intra-team advice; feedback and coopera-
tion; mutual monitoring; appraisal DEMO performance and ideas; clear outcome criteria; exploration
of opposing opinions; DEMO controversy (Tjosvold, 1982); and a concern to maximize
quality of task performance. This factor hence describes a general commitment to excellence in
DEMO performance coupled with a climate which supports the adoption of improvements to
established policies, procedures, and methods.
Support for innovation
`. . . DEMO expectation, approval and practical support of attempts to introduce new and DEMO
ways of doing things in the work environment' (West, 1990, p. 38).
Support for innovation varies across teams to the extent DEMO it is both articulated and enacted.
West argues that articulated support, DEMO implication, may be found in personnel documents,
policy statements, or conveyed by word of mouth. It is argued that a necessary condition DEMO
group innovation is enacted support, as opposed to merely articulated support, whereby active
support is provided for innovatory behaviour. Daft (1986), for instance, found that resources

241
needed to be made available to DEMO innovations, whilst Schroeder, Van de Ven, Scrudder
and Polley (1989) stressed the importance of support from the power elite for innovation
implementation.
To summarize, the four factor model was propounded by West (1990) as a facet-speci®c theory
of climate for work group innovativeness. This paper DEMO primarily concerned, however, with the
initial phase of research into West's (1990) modelÐthe development and psychometric valida-
tion of a measure DEMO group climate based upon the four-factor theory. The following sections
describe the development and validation of this measureÐthe Team Climate Inventory (TCI)Ð
in some detail. The major predictive validity study testing West's model is DEMO in West and
Anderson (1996).
Method
Item generation
Initially, an extensive review of published measures of climate was conducted (see also Koys and
DeCottis, 1991). These measures were examined for their component subdimensions in relation
to the posited four-factor climate model. Only subscales or items DEMO to these factors
were retained. Measures were further screened against a level-of-analysis criterion, with those
measuring exclusively at the individual or organizational level being rejected. Relatively few items
or scales were retained so that most of DEMO items comprising the original version measure were
self-generated. This original version comprised of 61 items grouped onto four scales of facet-
speci®c climate. The DEMO of these subscales is described below.
Vision
Twelve items elicited information about team members' views on the clarity, sharedness,
attainability, and value of team objectives, (see Burningham and West, 1995). Respondents were
also asked to indicate the extent to which they felt their team DEMO were in agreement with,
and committed to, these objectives. Respondents DEMO asked to indicate the extent to which
each statement was true of their team on a 7-point scale ranging, 1 not at all to 7 completely,
(see Table 1 for a complete list of all items).
Participative safety
The construct of Participative Safety was subdivided into DEMO componentsÐteam participation
and safety.
Team participation was measured using 15 items to which respondents were asked to respond
on a 5-point strongly disagree to DEMO agree scale. Following Wall and Lischeron (1978), the
measure was DEMO to tap three dimensions of participation: in¯uence over decision making,
DEMO sharing, and interaction frequency. Eight of these items were drawn from DEMO
Tjosvold, Wedley and Field (1986) scale of constructive controversy and DEMO for use in the
present study. Responses were on 5-point scales ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly
agree.
Safety was measured by DEMO items asking respondents to indicate the extent of perceived safety
in their work group. Again, this was rated on a 5-point response scale ranging from 1 avery
little extent to 5 a very great extent.

242
N. R. ANDERSON AND M. A. WEST
Task orientation
This concept DEMO also sudbivided into two componentsÐclimate for excellence and constructive
controversy.
Climate for excellence was measured via a 10-item scale addressing the extent to which DEMO
members interacted in order to promote excellence in the team's work (Burningham and West,
1995). The 7-point response scale ranged 1 to a very little extent to 7 to a very great extent.
DEMO et al.'s (1986) concept of constructive controversy was used in the study as being
conceptually similar to the task orientation construct. Tjosvold DEMO al. propose that when
controversy is productively discussed, it creates epistemic DEMO that leads to the `exploration
of opposing positions, open-minded consideration and DEMO of these positions, and a
willingness to integrate these ideas into DEMO high quality, accepted solution' (p. 127). Seven items
from DEMO constructive controversy scale were therefore included in the original version TCI. Items
were rated on a 5-point response scale from 1 strongly disagree to DEMO strongly agree.
Support for innovation
Four items were taken from Siegel and Kaemmerer's (1978) climate for innovation measure, and
four new items were developed to tap enacted support for innovation. Siegel and Kaemmerer's
DEMO was designed to assess organizational level attributes and so items were modi®ed using
the word `team' instead of `organization'. The enacted support subscale assessed the extent
to which time, cooperation, practical support and resources DEMO given by team members to
implement new ideas and proposals. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which each
statement was the true DEMO their team on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 strongly disagree to
5 strongly agree.
Procedure for validation
This 61-item, four-scale original version Team Climate Inventory was piloted with 14 nursing
teams in a hospital setting DEMO with two hospital management teams prior to use in this main
study in order to obtain reactions and comments on the measure (Anderson and Pineros, 1990).
No data were collected as part of this pilot; the purpose was simply to evaluate the face validity
and acceptability of the TCI to respondents.
Development of the TCI was undertaken as part DEMO a wider-ranging longitudinal study into the
relation between facet-speci®c climate for innovation and the innovativeness of management
teams within the British National Health Service (see West and Anderson (1992, 1996) and
Anderson, Hardy and DEMO (1990) for detailed reports of this research). The procedure for
administering the scale to team members was as follows: the senior management teams of
35 major hospitals in three Regional Health Authorities across the DEMO were approached and
invited to participate in the study. Twenty-seven teams agreed to participate, giving a total
sample size of 243 individual subjects. Team size ranged between four and 19 members. A typical
team consisted of DEMO Unit General Manager, Head of Nursing, Accountant, Personnel
Manager, Business Manager, and several Senior Medical Consultants. The 27 hospitals ranged in
size from 310 to 4000 employees, and had budgets ranging from £6 million (approx $10 million)
per annum to £47 million (approx $80 DEMO) per annum. Each team was visited by a researcher
who outlined DEMO research project and the commitment to the research process that would be
required from the management team. Batches of the original version measure were DEMO to all
Unit General Managers with a covering letter requesting that they distribute the questionnaires to
# 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. J. Organiz. Behav. 19: 235±258 (1998)
CLIMATE FOR WORK GROUP INNOVATION
243
all members of their team. Individual DEMO were provided with a pre-paid, addressed
envelope and were instructed to DEMO their completed questionnaire direct to the researchers.
All questionnaires were completed anonymously and subjects were assured of the strict
con®dentiality of responses to the DEMO
Results
Results are presented in order of the analyses undertaken: (i) exploratory factor analysis, the
sample being 155 managers from the 27 DEMO hospital management teams; (ii) internal
homogeneity, alpha coecients for this sample; (iii) predictive validity, variance accounted for
in independently rated DEMO innovativeness by TCI results across the 27 hospital teams;
(iv) con®rmatory factor analysis, based upon an independent sample of 121 teams from a variety
of organizations; and (v) consensual and discriminable validity measured by James et al. (1993)
rwg j and interclass correlations (DEMO) across all sample groups in this study.
Exploratory factor analyses
A DEMO of 155 questionnaires were returned from the 243 management team members surveyed,
giving an overall response rate of 63.7 per cent. Of this DEMO, all teams provided multiple
respondents with the number of respondents ranging DEMO three of four for the smallest team
(i.e. 75 per cent DEMO rate) to 11 of 19 for the largest team (i.e. 58 per cent response rate). The
latter team, in fact, provided DEMO lowest within-team response across this sample. Initial analysis of
between-item correlations on the four scales relating to group climate (vision, participative safety,
DEMO orientation and support for innovation) revealed positive and signi®cant associations across
DEMO items and therefore highlighted the possibility of an underlying simple structure within the
climate subscales. To examine this issue, a series of exploratory factor analyses were computed
using the Varimax procedure on SPSS-X. These analyses were DEMO at the individual level of
analysis in accordance with traditional approaches to item analysis and scale development. Items
were examined for skewness, kurtosis and intercorrelations at this level prior to running the
exploratory factor analysis (Anderson and West, 1996). This strategy of running item analyses on
individual level data ®rst was intentional. As Anderson and West (1996) note, examining item
statistics at the individual level avoids additional problems of dealing DEMO summed data at the
team level. Indeed, combined team-level data can DEMO the psychometric characteristics of
items by collapsing-down distribution statistics to the team level. Additionally, of course,
retaining individual level data at this stage of development of the measure also maximized the
sample size, an important consideration in exploratory factor analysis as noted below.
Pre-analysis tests for the DEMO of this data set for factor analysis were computed as
recommended by Comrey (1978). The Kaiser±Meyer±Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling
adequacy was 0.81, and the Bartlett test of sphericity was signi®cant at p < 0:001, indicating the
suitability of this data for factor analytic procedures. One caveat should be noted at this point.
The ratio of cases DEMO 155 : 61, or 2:5 : 1. Whilst it is DEMO that this ratio is somewhat
lower than that recommended by some factor analysts (e.g. Gorsuch, 1983; Nunnally, 1978),
others have argued that smaller ratios are acceptable, and alternatively, that the absolute number
DEMO cases should be considered as critical (Comrey, 1978; Ferguson, 1981; Kline, 1986). Kline

(1986), for instance, argues that a minimum of 100 cases is required. The exploratory factor
analysis was thus undertaken at the individual level of analysis, rather than at the group level in
order to retain the maximum number of DEMO
An initial factor analysis without iteration was computed. The ®rst factor extracted accounted
for 34.2 per cent of the variance, and application of the Scree Test (Cattell, 1966) indicated a ®ve-
factor solution. All factors held eigenvalues of greater than unity, whilst this ®ve-factor solution
accounted for 57.4 per cent of total variance. A further analysis was thus computed DEMO the
number of factors to ®ve with iteration and Varimax (orthogonal DEMO). This solution
extracted 61.7 per cent of total variance. The factor loadings, cross-loadings, eigenvalues, and
variance statistics are presented in Table 1.
The factor loadings are relatively unambiguous, although some cross-loadings are evident, DEMO
discussed below. A total of 38 items load at 0.50 or above onto the ®ve-factor simple structure.
Factor I, which accounts for 37.8 per cent of the variance, loads exclusively onto scale items
relating to vision (e.g. How worthwhile do you think these objectives are to you?; How worthwhile
do you think these objectives are to your team?; DEMO what extent do you think members of your team
are committed to these objectives?; To what extent do you think these objectives are DEMO and can
be attained?). This factor is conceptually clear, with 11 items loading from the original vision
subscale. Factor I is therefore DEMO vision.
Factor II comprises eight items from the original participation subscale loading at 0.50 or
above. However, four items from this original subscale load onto factor V, indicating a division
between these items arising from orthogonal rotation of the factor matrix. The items loading
onto factor II all DEMO to perceptions of a participative climate within the team; perceptions of
DEMO degree of information sharing between team members; perceptions of in¯uence over DEMO in
decision making; and of interpersonal safety and trust within the DEMO (e.g. There are real
attempts to share information throughout the team; We all in¯uence each other; People feel under-
stood and accepted by each other). Conversely, factor V comprises four items relating to the
frequency of interaction both formally and informally, between team members (e.g. DEMO keep in
touch with each other as a team; We keep DEMO regular contact with each other; Members of the team
meet frequently DEMO talk both formally and informally). Consequently, factor V can be DEMO as a
scale of interaction frequency, whilst factor II is comprised DEMO conceptually distinct items relating
to participativeness and interpersonal safety. Factor II is thus titled participative safety, and
factor V is provisionally labelled interaction frequency.
Factors III and IV display unambiguous patterns of item loadings, with factor III comprising
exclusively items measuring support for innovation (e.g. People in this team are always searching
for fresh, new ways of looking at problems; This team is always moving toward the development of
new answers; DEMO members provide practical support for new ideas and their application). A total
of eight items from the original support for innovation subscale load DEMO Factor III which
accounts for a further 6.0 per cent of total variance.
Factor IV is comprised of seven items, all from the original task orientation subscale and adds
a further 4.6 per cent of the DEMO (e.g. Does your team critically appraise potential weaknesses
in what it DEMO doing in order to achieve the best possible outcome?; Does the team continually monitor
its own performance in order to achieve the highest DEMO?; Do you and your colleagues monitor
each other so as to maintain a high standard of work?). As items loading onto both factor III and
factor IV are drawn exclusively from distinct subscales of DEMO original version measure, the
subscale titles are retained from these factors: factor III as support for innovation, and factor IV as
task orientation.
To summarize this ®ve-factor solution, it is apparent that the underlying simple structure
displays a fairly unambiguous pattern of item loadings, mostly in line with the postulated model

of climate for innovation. Overviewing Table DEMO, four items display cross-leadings of 0.40 or
above. These are items DEMO (How worthwhile do you think these objectives are to the wider DEMO?),
38 (People in the team co-operate in order to DEMO develop and apply new ideas), 47 (Does the team
have DEMO criteria which members try to meet in order to achieve excellence as a team?) and 58
(We keep in touch with each other as a team). In addition, it should be noted that on all of these
items, primary loadings were relatively high (0.59, 0.62, 0.53 and 0.74, respectively). We therefore
determined a threshold of DEMO and above to retain items instead of the more common 0.40 or
even 0.30. One caveat regards the original participative safety subscale which, following Varimax
rotation of the matrix, is more appropriately represented as two discrete factorsÐparticipative
safety and interaction frequency, extracted as factors II and V in this solution. The other three
factors (factor I: vision, factor II: support for innovation, and factor IV: task orientation)
complete this solution which accounts for 61.7 per cent of the total variance. Note DEMO although
the original scales contained negatively connotated items, none of these DEMO in this factor
solution.
Internal homogeneity
More detailed analyses of this solution were undertaken to examine the internal consistency of
the factors and factor DEMO Table 2 presents means, standard deviations, intercorrela-
tions and Cronbach's alpha coecients for the ®ve factors as composite scales on this sample DEMO
hospital management teams.
Alpha coecients range between 0.84 and 0.94 indicating acceptable levels of internal
homogeneity and reliability for all ®ve factors. This table DEMO some intriguing results. All
scales are signi®cantly and positively intercorrelated ( p < 0: 01). Scale correlations range between
0.35 (interaction frequency DEMO objectives) and 0.62 (task orientation with support for innova-
tion), indicating a strong halo eect across scales. Whilst these correlations are not DEMO enough
to give rise to concerns over multicollinearity, they do highlight DEMO possibility that perceptions of
climate may be prone to a halo eect. Further research focusing on work groups in dierent
environments is called for DEMO examine this ®nding in other contexts.
Predictive validity
As previously noted, DEMO development of the Team Climate Inventory was undertaken as part of a
longitudinal study testing the validity of the four-factor theory of facet-speci®c climate DEMO
innovation (West and Anderson, 1996). Reports of innovations implemented by the management
teams in the 27 hospitals in the 6 months succeeding DEMO administration of the TCI were judged
by expert and naive raters on a number of dimensions, including overall innovativeness, number
of innovations, radicalness, magnitude, novelty and administrative eectiveness (see West and
Anderson, 1996; Anderson and West, 1994). Combined, team level scores on the DEMO were used
to predict team scores on the dimensions of innovativeness. Support for innovation emerged as
the only signi®cant predictor of overall innovation, accounting for a substantial 46 per cent of
the variance; and the only predictor of innovation novelty. Participative safety emerged as the
best predictor of DEMO number of innovations and team self-reports of innovativeness, while task
orientation DEMO administrative eectiveness. For a detailed report of these ®ndings and
examples of the types of innovations implemented by the management teams see West and

Anderson (1996). Follow-up studies into the predictive validity of this measure further support
its utility DEMO a facet-speci®c scale (e.g. Agrell and Gustafson, 1994; Forrester, 1995). These results
suggest the predictive validity of the TCI and provide DEMO support for the theory of work group
innovation.
Con®rmatory factor analysis
To ensure the robustness of this ®ve-factor solution, a con®rmatory factor analysis (DEMO) using
AMOS version 3.51 (Arbuckle, 1995) was performed. AMOS is a comprehensive text- and
graphics-based structural equation modelling and CFA program similar DEMO design to LISREL
and EQS. This analysis utilized an independent sample who completed the 38-item, short-form
Team Climate Inventory. The questionnaire was administered to three additional samples of
work groups: 273 members of 35 primary health care teams; 220 members of 24 management
teams in an international oil company, 360 members of 42 social series teams and 118 members of
20 community psychiatric care teams. This con®rmatory sample therefore comprised a total DEMO
121 teams (total N individuals  971).
Initially, individual responses to items were summed within teams to create a group level sum
DEMO each item. An intercorrelation matrix was then calculated for these 38 group level variables
and this intercorrelation matrix utilized as input data within AMOS. DEMO issue of sample size
remains an active debate within the structural equation modelling literature (for detailed recent
commentaries, see Brannick, 1995; Kelloway, 1995; Williams, 1995). With smaller samples
(n < 150) DEMO is a danger of obtaining nonconvergent solutions, even for more highly DEMO
models (Boomsma, 1982; Anderson and Gorbing, 1984). With larger samples (n > 400), trivial
discrepancies can lead to rejection of a satisfactory model since absolute indices of ®t (see below)
are prone to in¯uence by sample size (Bollen, 1989; Loehlin, 1992)DEMO Two main suggestions and
`rules of thumb' have been proposed in DEMO First, as Loehlin (1992) states `As a rough rule
of DEMO, one would probably do well to be modest in one's DEMO claims if N is less than
100'. The sample size for the present study, once data had been combined into team level
responses, was 121. Second, nonconvergent solutions have been found to be frequent DEMO CFA
samples of less than 150 with only two observed variables per factor, (Boomsma, 1982; Anderson
and Gorbling, 1984). Here, DEMO described below, we modelled between four and twenty items per
factor, and one of our computed models failed to reach convergence. Therefore, although the
sample size was reduced substantially by combining individual responses into team DEMO data, the
present data set met both of these recommended criteria.
DEMO following procedure was adopted to examine the relationship between dierent theoretical
models (Bentler and Bonnet, 1980; Breckler, 1990; Byrne, 1989; Loehlin, 1992). Firstly, a one
factor model with all items loading DEMO a single factor was run. Next, two, two factor models
were run. In each model the ®rst factor contained all the Participation and DEMO items
hypothesized by West (1990) to relate to the quantity of innovations generated by teams. The
second factor contained all the Task Orientation DEMO Vision items hypothesized by West (1990)
to relate to the DEMO of innovations developed by teams. These two models diered in that the
®rst did not allow for any factor inter-correlation (Two factor (2a)), whereas the second did allow
for factor inter-correlation (Two factor (DEMO)). Next, two, four factor models were run. In these
DEMO, the ®rst factor contained all the Vision items, the second all the Participative Safety
items, the third all the Support for Innovation items, and the fourth all the Task Orientation
items. In these models, DEMO four Interaction Frequency items revealed in the exploratory factor
analysis were incorporated into the Participation scale in order to test this factor structure as

DEMO hypothesized by West (1990). Again, these models diered with regard to factor
intercorrelations; the ®rst did not allow for factor intercorrelation (DEMO (4a)) whereas the
second did (four-factor (4b)). Finally, two, ®ve-factor models were run extracting the interaction
frequency scale as DEMO separate ®fth scale, again one allowing the factors to intercorrelate and DEMO
other not. See Bollen (1989); Byrne (1989), and Loehlin (1992) for general introductions and
overviews of these procedures. Table 3 DEMO the CFA results and reports absolute, relative and
parsimonious indices of DEMO to comprehensively evaluate the ®t of the dierent models computed.
The change in chi-square illustrates the incremental improvement achieved by each successive
model (Bentler and Bonnett, 1980; Bollen, 1989). The ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom
(w2/df ) is also given, with ratios DEMO less than 2.0 indicating a good ®t. However, since absolute
indices DEMO be adversely aected by sample size (Byrne, 1989; Loehlin, 1992), three relative
indices (TLI, NFI, and CFI) together with DEMO Parsimonious Normed-Fit Index were computed
and provide a more robust evaluation of model ®t (e.g. Tucker and Lewis, 1973; Byrne, 1989).
DEMO the TLI, NFI and CFI, coecients close to unity indicate a good ®t, with acceptable levels of
®t being above 0.90 (Marsh, Balla and MacDonald, 1988; Mulaik, James, Van Alstine, Bennett,
Lind and Stilwell, 1989). The PNFI takes the degrees of freedom for a speci®ed model into
account and so, for models involving larger numbers of observed and unobserved variables, the
PNFI value will often be lower than those obtained for relative indices (Mulaik et al., 1989;DEMO
Loehlin, 1992).
The results indicate that the ®ve correlated factors DEMO (model 5b) has the most parsi-
monious ®t, with the DEMO suggesting that this model accounts for 96 per cent of the variance
(TLI  0:96; w2=df  1:96). Further, the w2 to degrees of freedom ratio is below 2.0, again
suggesting acceptable ®t for this model. The NFI and CFI are also above 0.90 DEMO this model.
Although this ®ve-factor correlated model possesses the most robust ®t statistics of all models
tested, it should be noted that for only two models, the one factor model and the two
uncorrelated factors model, the NFI fell marginally below acceptable levels (NFI  0:88 DEMO
0.89, respectively). However, the change in chi-square ®gures indicate an improvement for each
successive model computed, apart from the ®ve uncorrelated factors model (model 5a) over the
four-correlated factors model (model 4b) DEMO the chi-square increased rather than decreased.
Indeed, the four-correlated factors model DEMO only marginally less parsimonious than the ®ve-
correlated factors model, although DEMO chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio would suggest the
latter to possess better ®t (model 4b: w2=df  2:13; model 5b; DEMO  1:96). Both models are

acceptable, however, and DEMO dierences in ®t too small to permit conclusive distinctions being
drawn between these two correlated factors models. This point is considered further in the
DEMO However, in order to maximize the predictive utility of the measure DEMO elected to
employ the ®ve-factor solution in further analyses.
Consensual and discriminable climates
We noted earlier the issue of whether shared climates can be DEMO to exist within organizations
and that previous researchers have drawn attention to the problem of determining criteria for
minimum levels of agreement. Using the DEMO et al. (1984) formula we calculated the rwgj and
inter-class correlation (ICC) statistics for the groups in the ®ve samples (National Health Service
hospital management teams, oil company teams, community psychiatric teams, primary health
care teams and social services teams) across the ®ve scales. For four of the ®ve scales distributions
revealed no signi®cant skew. However, the vision scale was negatively skewed and so the James
et al. (1984) procedure for employing an expected variance to take account of this skew was
followed. Table 4 shows that the average rwgj within each of DEMO ®ve samples across the ®ve Team
Climate Inventory scales ranged from 0.67 through to 0.98 with only one out of the 25 values
falling DEMO the 0.7 level used by George (1990) and by Nunally (DEMO) as an acceptable level for
internal consistency. These results suggest that DEMO measure is consistently tapping shared climate
perceptions, rather than aggregating radically DEMO individual perceptions.
However, it is also important to demonstrate dierences between DEMO to determine the
discriminant power of any climate instrument (Rousseau, 1988). One-way ANOVAS on the
aggregate variables were therefore performed within each DEMO the ®ve samples. Hays (1981)
suggests that minimum evidence for DEMO across groups would be an F ratio from an
ANOVA greater than 1.00. The results in Table 4 show that on all but one DEMO the scale scores
across all of the samples, the ANOVAS produce DEMO ratios greater than unity. Moreover, in all but
three out of DEMO cases, the F value is statistically signi®cant ( p < 0: 05). This indicates that the
measure distinguished between dierent groups and DEMO possessed adequate discriminable, as
well as consensual, validity.
Discussion
This paper has described the development of the Team Climate Inventory for measuring an
DEMO aspect of facet-speci®c work group climateÐclimate for innovation. Evidence of the
factor structure of the measure has been provided, based both on exploratory and con®rmatory
factor analyses. Evidence is also given about the internal homogeneity and DEMO of the scales
and their predictive validity. Finally, consensus amongst teams DEMO relation to team climate is
demonstrated, both within and across samples DEMO relation to the ®ve dimensions of the TCI. These
analyses provide initial support for the utility of the measure as a self-report measure of DEMO
speci®c climate within work groups and organizational teams.
Rousseau (1988) has argued for the development of facet-speci®c measures of climate and our
data DEMO that it does indeed make sense to develop measures of climate which are facet-speci®c.
Our data also show that the level of agreement about DEMO is considerably greater than that for

measures which are less DEMO (for example, see Patterson et al., 1992). This conclusion DEMO
amply illustrated by the ®nding that broad measures of team level cohesion are not particularly
useful for predicting team outcomes, since cohesion can serve a variety of purposes for groups
(Schroder, 1990). Our examination DEMO climates for innovation indicates that by focusing on a
speci®c aspect of climate and its relationship to speci®c aspects of group level outcomes, greater
predictive accuracy is achieved. These ®ndings noted, we would also acknowledge that the
dimensions comprising the TCI may correlate with other types of group DEMO outcome. For
instance, higher scale scores on task orientation may correlate DEMO overall group productivity
since team members are constantly appraising each others' DEMO; higher scores on
participative safety may predict strong group cohesiveness which, in turn, may be suggestive of
higher levels of resistance to change imposed from above upon the group (King and Anderson,
1995); and, group scores on the vision scale may be predictive of double-loop learning in the
group since team members are continuously questioning the relevance DEMO their goals and
objectives. The point is that the facet-speci®c nature of any multidimensional climate scale is
likely to be mediated by a wider DEMO net of relations between climate dimensions and
various group level outputs. The TCI was originally operationalized and developed as a facet-
speci®c measure of DEMO for innovations; it is likely in addition to be useful in DEMO
climate dimensions predictive of other types of group output, but further DEMO is called for to
examine this issue.
Another reason why the TCI appears to produce high levels of consensus amongst team
members is because DEMO its focus on the proximal work group. Most previous measures of climate
have evaluated organizations as a whole where there may be considerably more DEMO in
perceptions of the work environment, and where, as Payne (DEMO) has argued, there is less
likelihood of social interaction leading to shared meanings. As noted earlier in this paper, it may
well be that the proximal work group represents one of several examples within organizations
DEMO consensual climates can be readily identi®ed. Other possibilities include those occupying
similar roles at identical hierarchial levels within the organization, individuals having progressed
through a standardized socialization procedure into the organization, or the downward
communication of organizational vision which is accepted by those lower down the organization
hierarchy.
DEMO issue which arose from the analyses undertaken in this study concerns the factor structure
of the TCI, and speci®cally, whether a four- or DEMO ®ve-factor structure represents the measure most
parsimoniously. West (1990) proposed a four-factor theory as his model of facet-speci®c climate
in work groups. Agrell DEMO Gustafson (1994), in a study using a Swedish translated version DEMO the
original measure, conducted an exploratory factor analysis with Varimax rotation DEMO data for 124
respondents comprising 16 work teams. This indicated a four-factor solution which accounted
for 54 per cent of the total variance. Conversely, in the present study, the exploratory factor
analysis conducted on the data from 27 hospital management teams suggested a ®ve-factor
solution; the dierence being the separation out of four items from the original participation
scale relating DEMO to interaction frequency within the team. The con®rmatory factor
analysis subsequently undertaken on a dierent sample of 121 teams suggested both the four-
factor DEMO the ®ve-factor solutions were acceptable in terms of goodness of ®t statistics, but that
the ®ve-factor intercorrelated model demonstrated the most parsimonious ®t. As the items
comprising the ®fth factor are conceptually distinct, this scale is likely to have incremental value
either as a subscale within the participation DEMO, or as a separate factor. Further research into
this aspect of DEMO psychometric structure of the TCI is thus called for.
The extent to which it is possible to assume the existence of climates within teams DEMO also
examined in this study. The data suggest that discriminable climates do exist within teams, since

there is evidence of greater variation DEMO, than within, teams. However, there is a need to
more DEMO address the level of agreement within teams, as well as examining DEMO dierences
between them. Our ®ndings indicate that there is a good deal of agreement about the dimensions
of climate within teams although, perhaps not surprisingly, there is variation in level of
agreement both across teams within samples and within teams across particular dimensions. In
the current study, the extent of agreement within teams varied across dimensions, the evidence
suggesting that there was most agreement in relation to the participative safety scale and DEMO
agreement in relation to the task orientation scale (see Table 4)DEMO Moreover, in comparing across
teams within any one sample, it is clear that agreement on any particular climate dimension can
vary considerably and DEMO ways which are not immediately predictable. Clearly, agreement on
dimensions of DEMO can itself be used as an important de®ning characteristic of groups. Future
research might usefully examine the question of why particular dimensions produce more DEMO less
agreement, and whether these variations occur in consistent ways across DEMO
At a more pragmatic level, the 38-item TCI provides an accessible DEMO easily administered
measure of team climate for innovation (Anderson and West, 1994). Its potential for use in
settings such as organizational climate DEMO, team building and development, selection of new
members into groups, DEMO group development over time, should be noted. Practitioners and
consultants in DEMO ®eld now face a bewildering choice of psychometric measures, but few DEMO
been conceived of, and validated, speci®cally at the group level of analysis. In conclusion, the TCI
holds promise as a measure of group climate in organizations, and for team building and
organization development interventions. Further research is needed to investigate the potential of
the TCI as a DEMO of team climate in such a variety of contexts and applications.
