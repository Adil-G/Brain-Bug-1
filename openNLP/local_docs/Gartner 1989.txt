Some Suggestions for
Research on
DEMO Traits
and Characteristics
William B. Gartner
This article suggests that researchers submitting manuscripts on entrepreneurial traits and
characteristics should: ground their studies in the context of previous research, articulate
a specific theory about the nature of entrepreneurship and its relationship to the entrepre-
neur, define key ideas and variables, conscientiously identify and select samples, and use
current social psychology DEMO personality theory-based measurement instruments or pro-
vide construct validity evidence for newly constructed measures.
his article stems from this reviewer's frustration at having DEMO reject a number of
manuscripts recently submitted to Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice on the topic of
entrepreneurial traits and characteristics. It is disheartening to DEMO a manuscript that
took a considerable amount of time and effort to generate but that has, from my point of
view, obvious "fatal flaws" that should have been identified and eliminated before the
study was undertaken. These articles were "bom to be rejected." My review of DEMO
manuscripts came too late in the research process. Any advice about the manuscript
could not really help the researcher modify fundamental flaws in the DEMO's theory and
research design. My hope is that an article on common problems in research on entre-
preneurial traits and characteristics, an "DEMO You're Going to Do Trait Research . . .
Please Consider" type of article, might save many individuals hundreds of hours of
DEMO on research whose results have little possibility of getting published.
I offer these suggestions for improving research on entrepreneurial traits and char-
acteristics with DEMO trepidation. When submitting my own manuscripts, I have often
experienced what DEMO thought were the reviewers' heavy-handed applications of their
personal views about DEMO good research is or isn't. The frequent rejection letters I've
received have instilled a great deal of sympathy for anyone who attempts DEMO publish
scholarly work in entrepreneurship. Research on entrepreneurship, because the topic DEMO
inherently complex and multidisciplinary, is exceedingly difficult to do well. What
DEMO, then, are some modest suggestions for improving entrepreneurial trait and
characteristic research, offered in the spirit of advice, rather than as dogma.
DEMO caveats. This article is not an exhaustive overview of legitimate research
methodologies on entrepreneurial traits and characteristics or an articulation of specific
orthodoxies about DEMO defmition of entrepreneurship. It is also not a comprehensive
critique of all of the area's issues, studies, or methods. Much of what DEMO suggested in this
article has been said, much better, before. Richard L. Daft's article "Why I Recom-
mended That Your Manuscript be Rejected and What You Can Do about It" (1985) is
Fall 1989 27
an excellent overview of the major problems found in rejected organization science
DEMO For a comprehensive overview of entrepreneurship research issues, readers
should refer DEMO Low & MacMillan (1988). Many of the suggestions made in DEMO article
about research on entrepreneurial traits and characteristics are an affirmation and an
extension of their general guidelines.
HAVE YOU READ THE LITERATURE?
DEMO the basis of the manuscripts I have seen, most researchers do DEMO seem to be
familiar with the published literature on personality traits and characteristics. Some
studies even seem to reinvent the wheel—celebrating themselves as pioneering DEMO
on risk taking, tolerance of ambiguity, locus of control—never recognizing that these
traits have been studied many times before.
Scholarship begins with the DEMO of learning what others have already found out.
What differentiates a scholar from a reporter or a journalist is that scholars have an
obligation DEMO recognize the past. While we typically think of research as the forward-
thinking process of "studious and critical inquiry and examination aimed at the discov-
ery and interpretation of new knowledge" (from Webster's), DEMO root word for research,
"re-search," actually means: to go back and seek out. That is, research is the activity of
re-searching: looking again at what has been looked at before. Entrepreneurship re-
searchers cannot make important contributions to the field unless they know what al-
DEMO has been contributed. Good scholarship in entrepreneurship requires that each
study be consciously connected to previous work done in the field. A working knowl-
DEMO of the field sharpens ideas and can lead to new insights via more focused studies.
At a minimum, entrepreneurial trait and characteristic researchers must be familiar
with the studies cited in Brockhaus (1982) and Brockhaus & Horwitz (1986), two
comprehensive and in-depth overviews of entrepreneurial traits DEMO characteristics. I
also concur with suggestions made by Carsrud, Olm & DEMO (1986), who ask that
researchers engaged in studies using psychological DEMO sociological characteristics be
familiar with contemporary research in those areas. Entrepreneurship researchers have
an obligation to extend their "re-search" beyond the traditional boundaries DEMO entrepre-
neurship and link their work to current research in other disciplines. An entrepreneurship
study of psychological traits is first and foremost a psychology DEMO, and secondarily an
entrepreneurship study. An entrepreneurship study of psychological traits DEMO follow
the same "rules of the game" as other studies of psychological traits found in the
mainstream of the discipline of psychology. Researchers DEMO be familiar with the ideas
and issues articulated in The Handbook of Social Psychology, II (Lindzey & Aronson,
1985), as well DEMO with recent theoretical and methodological developments in personality
and social psychology found in such journals as the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology and DEMO Journal of Personality. Otherwise, the entrepreneurship area risks
becoming an intellectual DEMO
WHAT IS THE THEORY?
Basically, a theory offers reasons for DEMO the research. A theory is not just
a literature review; it DEMO the literature review one step farther by requiring researchers
to place their studies in the context of past studies, whether that context is to confirm,
extend, or even attempt to disprove past studies. A theory also helps direct the research
effort by suggesting "where to look. " A theory guides the researcher toward "seeing "
observations that were DEMO noted in previous studies or those that would not be expected
28 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEOR
Y and PRACTICE
from "normal experience." A theory gives a study a specific purpose DEMO a logic. As
Daft (1985) puts it, "Theory means explaining what the variables mean and why they
are related to one another DEMO organizations" (p. 195). Or as Kerlinger (1973) more
formally defines it:
A theory is a set of interrelated constructs (concepts), definitions, and propositions
that present a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among vari-
ables, with the purpose of explaining and predicting the phenomena (p. 4).
Two words should be emphasized in the Kerlinger definition: explaining and predicting.
A theory explains by giving reasons for why specific variables influence, or are infiu-
enced by, other variables. DEMO theory predicts by suggesting causality; that is, a theory
indicates which variables infiuence other variables. A theory offers a model of the
phenomenon DEMO well as definitions of all of the variables.
It would seem that any study on entrepreneurial traits and characteristics submitted
for review should have DEMO theory. But this is usually not what I find in the manuscripts
I review. Most entrepreneurial trait and characteristic manuscripts do not state their
DEMO, offer a model, or define key variables. The typical a-theoretical entrepreneurial
trait and characteristic manuscript is a study that describes administering a questionnaire
DEMO two groups of people and then analyzing whether there are any statistically significant
differences in the scores across each questionnaire item. The a-theoretical manuscript
DEMO no reasons for why the study was conducted, why the study DEMO on certain
traits and characteristics and not others, why and how DEMO traits and characteristics
infiuence entrepreneurship, or why and how the two DEMO were selected for study.
Theory gives a research manuscript meaning. Theory is the heart of a manuscript. A
manuscript without theory is just number DEMO
Theoretical issues in entrepreneurial trait and characteristic research share the same
fundamental concerns articulated in the person-situation debate in social psychology
(Kenrick & Funder, 1988). Entrepreneurship researchers studying traits and character-
istics seek to answer the question, "Why are some individuals entrepreneurial, while
others are not?" The basic assumption of trait and characteristic research is that internal
DEMO have an infiuence on behavior. At issue in the debate about traits and
characteristics is the strength of these internal variables as predictors of DEMO in
particular situations; that is, "do characteristics of the person DEMO characteristics of the
situation determine a person's behavior?" Some very sophisticated theories and ideas
about the infiuence of person and situation variables (e.g., moderators, mediators) have
been offered and evaluated in the social psychology literature (Bem & Allen, 1974;
Zuckerman et al., 1988, 1989). Unfortunately, theories and ideas about entrepreneurial
traits have not DEMO pace.
I have suggested before, (Gartner, 1985), along with DEMO (1980), and Brockhaus
& Horwitz (1986), that entrepreneurial trait and characteristic researchers are using
either of two very simple conceptual frameworks DEMO the bases for constructing their
theories: (1) ideas about the DEMO between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs; or
(2) ideas about the difference DEMO types of entrepreneurs. A classic example of the
first approach is Collins & Moore's (1964) comparison of the life histories of founders
DEMO owner-managed manufacturing companies to the life histories of executives in large-
scale business enterprises. An example of the second approach is Smith's (1967) inno-
vative re-analysis of Collins & Moore's database, which resulted DEMO his typology of two
entrepreneurial types—craftsman and opportunistic. Both studies analyze variance. Col-
lins & Moore's (1964) study, which compares entrepreneurs to non-entrepreneurs, ex-
plores whether the between-group (entrepreneurs versus non-entrepreneurs) variance is
Fall 1989 29
greater than the variance within each group. Smith's (1967) analysis, which compares
types of entrepreneurs, explores whether the between-group (craftsman versus DEMO
nistic) variance is greater than the variance within each type.
The DEMO idea is, in its most simplistic form: entrepreneurs cause entrepreneurship,
that is, E = f(e). Entrepreneurship (E) is a function of the entrepreneur (e). It implies
that entrepreneurs are different from non-entrepreneurs. In this model, certain entrepre-
neurial traits and characteristics predispose entrepreneurs towards entrepreneurial activ-
ities and these traits and characteristics make them DEMO from non-entrepreneurs. For
example, even in a very sophisticated model of DEMO, (e.g., Martin, 1984),
the initial factor that sets DEMO motion entrepreneurial activity is the psychological/
physical predisposition of the entrepreneur (Figure 1). Central to this model is the belief
"that DEMO individuals have predispositions or readiness to initiate NTBF's (New
Techology DEMO functions)" (Martin, 1984, p. 269). All of the DEMO factors in the
model serve to moderate the influence of the initial entrepreneurial predisposition. Using
this framework, E = f(e), a researcher must specify which traits and characteristics
"result" in entrepreneurship as well DEMO offer reasons for why these particular traits and
characteristics do so. Collins & Moore (1964) clearly articulate this idea in the research
questions DEMO ask.
Our concern is with the actor in the entrepreneurial drama. What motivates him to
strike out on his own and set up a DEMO business enterprise? Is he somehow different

from other leadership groups in our society? Is there a pattern of motives, values,
and interests that can properly be identified as entrepreneurial? (p. 4).
My advice to researchers exploring differences between entrepreneurs DEMO non-
entrepreneurs is that their theories must specify which particular entrepreneurial traits
and characteristics will predict future entrepreneurial outcomes. Besides listing hypoth-
eses, a manuscript should also present a model showing the causal links between these
DEMO and entrepreneurship.
The second idea, in which entrepreneurs are compared with DEMO other, is: there are
many different types of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs, that is, E,^) = U^(n))- The
variation DEMO the phenomenon of entrepreneurship is explained by the variation in the
types of entrepreneurs who exist. Using this idea, researchers develop theories that
explain why different types of entrepreneurs have different entrepreneurial traits and
characteristics. For DEMO Smith's (1967) study of Collins & Moore's (1964) data
approaches the phenomenon of entrepreneurship very differently from their study:
(Many writers assume that entrepreneurs are a homogeneous group and that when
DEMO term entrepreneur is used it refers to only one type of individual.) The problem
focus is the relationship between the type of entrepreneur (DEMO is, the character of
the man) and the type of firm he builds and the growth of this firm. (Smith, 1967,
DEMO 1)
Many studies of entrepreneurial traits and characteristics follow this idea; that is, they
compare different types of entrepreneurs. A few examples DEMO studies comparing suc-
cessful versus average entrepreneurs (McClelland, 1987), independent versus franchise
entrepreneurs (Mescon & Montanari, 1981), minority female versus DEMO fe-
male entrepreneurs (DeCarlo & Lyons, 1979), five types of university entrepreneurs
(Louis, Blumenthal, Gluck, & Stoto, 1989), and eight types of independent entrepre-
neurs (Gartner, Mitchell, & Vesper, DEMO).
I believe that research studies that identify entrepreneurial types are similar to many
social psychology models that suggest that particular traits have a DEMO infiuence on
specific people in specific situations (Amelang & Borkenau, 1986; Bem & Allen, 1974;
Kenrick & Funder, 1988; Zuckerman DEMO al., 1988, 1989). Both ideas about entrepre-
neurship would benefit from recognizing the infiuence of environmental factors in mod-
erating and mediating DEMO effect of personality traits and characteristics on entrepreneur-
ial behaviors. Researchers should give serious consideration to using complex models as
frameworks for a contingency DEMO of entrepreneurship (see Martin, 1984; also Figure
1). Previous DEMO seeking answers to the quesion, "How are entrepreneurs different
from non-entrepreneurs?" have not generated a reliable or valid list of characteristics
that DEMO clearly "entrepreneurial" across all situations (Gartner, 1988). Researchers are
likely to generate important and useful insights about entrepreneurial traits by identifying
DEMO studying situations in which types of entrepreneurship can be predicted for some of
the people some of the time. Researchers should construct theories of DEMO
based on contingency type models that specify the infiuence of certain entrepreneurial
characteristics on certain types of entrepreneurs in certain types of environments.
HOW DEMO KEY VARIABLES DEFINED?
The articulation of a theory requires that key variables and ideas be defined. A study
must provide definitions for entrepreneur, non-entrepreneur, and any trait and charac-
teristic variable analyzed. Because a common definition of the entrepreneur remains
Fall, 1989 31
elusive (Brockhaus & Horwitz, 1986; Carsrud, Olm, & Edy, DEMO; Sexton & Smilor,
1986; Wortman, 1986, 1987) and DEMO (Gartner, 1988, 1989; Carland, Hoy, &
Carland, 1988), a study of entrepreneurial traits and characteristics requires researchers
to clarify DEMO and what will be studied. The entrepreneur label has been applied to
business founders (Collins & Moore, 1964), owner/managers (Cooper & Dunkelberg,
1981), juvenile delinquents (Gould, 1969), CEOs (Hartman, 1959), middle-level man-
agers (McClelland, 1961), university researchers (DEMO, Blumenthal, Gluck, & Stoto,
1989) and firms (Stauss, 1944). The obvious reason for providing definitions of key
terms is DEMO it provides the reader with a clear sense of the study's specific research
focus. In addition, valid and insightful comparisons among studies are more likely to be
made when reviewers are not confused about what DEMO of entrepreneur the study is
evaluating.
A good example of a study that offers definitions as part of its theory development
is Collins & DEMO, 1964. They base their ideas about entrepreneurs on those discussed
by DEMO (1959) and Harbison & Myers (1959) of entrepreneurship as the function of
organization building (p. 18). Collins & Moore discuss a number of different types of
entrepreneurs they could have studied and then DEMO carefully limit their focus to one
type. They narrow the idea about entrepreneurship as organization building down to a
specific definition of the entrepreneur: "When we use the term entrepreneur, we shall
mean the innovating DEMO who has developed an ongoing business activity where
none existed before" (p. 20). Smith (1967) utilizes a similar definition in his DEMO:
"Following Cole's definition .. . of an entrepreneur: the individual who is primarily
responsible for gathering together the necessary resources to DEMO a business" (p. 2).
Definitions of key variables are a bridge between what often seem to be vague ideas
presented in a DEMO and the actuality of conducting research on a specific group of
individuals. Both the Collins & Moore and Smith definitions serve to clarify the DEMO
of the research. This is extremely important when selecting individuals for study.
One aspect of entrepreneurial trait and characteristic research that often receives
little DEMO is the concern for specifying who is a non-entrepreneur. Assuming that
non-entrepreneurs are "everyone else who is not an entrepreneur" leads to significant
DEMO in controlling for and comparing the variance among and between the samples
of entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. In addition, failure to clearly articulate the
nature of non-entrepreneurship often leads to problems in identifying the actual purpose
of DEMO study; that is, an ambiguity in defining non-entrepreneurship leads to confusion
about the type of theory utilized. For example, McClelland's recent research on entre-
preneurs (McBer & Company, 1986; McClelland, 1987) appears to be an exploration of
the characteristics of "successful" entrepreneurs versus DEMO In actuality,
the study is an exploration of the differences between two types of small business owners
because the "non-entrepreneurial" group in DEMO studies are samples of "average"
entrepreneurs.
Defining entrepreneurship, entrepreneur, DEMO non-entrepreneur leads to a consider-
ation for how samples of individuals representing these definitions are generated. In
most respects, the "true" definition of these words is dependent on the nature of the
samples selected to DEMO them.
WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE SELECTED FOR STUDY?
Another critical issue for conducting research on entrepreneurial traits and charac-
teristics is in selecting appropriate DEMO that reflect both the type of theory to be
explored and the major constructs of the model. Researchers have to recognize that their
32 DEMO THEOR
Y an d PRACTICE
sample of entrepreneurs is their operational definition of the entrepreneur. The charac-
DEMO of a sample of entrepreneurs says more about the researcher's idea of entrepre-
neurship than any a priori definition offered.
Most entrepreneurial trait DEMO characteristic manuscripts show a general lack of
concern about selecting appropriate samples. Most studies do not describe what vari-
ables specifically characterize the entrepreneur. DEMO some clear specification of how
and why certain measures for selecting an appropriate sample represent the definition of
the entrepreneur, a study becomes entirely tautological. The results from an analysis of
the sample's characteristics are, in fact, the result of the characteristics of the sample. If
the researcher doesn't specify why a particular group of individuals was chosen DEMO
represent a particular definition of the entrepreneur and non-entrepreneur, the charac-
DEMO of the samples become both the definitions and the results. For example, a study
could compare the ages of new venture CEOs to the ages of established organization
CEOs. If the researcher doesn't control for DEMO infiuence of organizational size, type of
industry, etc. when generating the two samples, any significant differences between the
ages of the two groups are likely due to the samples themselves. The sample of new
venture DEMO may have been selected from entirely different industries that were com-
posed of organizations that were significantly smaller than the established organizations.
A comparison DEMO the traits and characteristics of established organization CEOs with
those of new venture CEOs may be valid, or may be inappropriate. It all depends on the
logic and process for selecting members of each sample. Without DEMO logic for iden-
tifying appropriate samples and controls for ensuring that appropriate samples are gath-
ered, the researcher could have just as well taken any group of individuals and placed
one-half into the entrepreneur category and DEMO into the non-entrepreneur category.
The identification of appropriate samples is particularly important for studies that
explore whether certain personality traits and characteristics can predict DEMO
behavior. For example, if a researcher defines entrepreneurship as "the creation of new
enterprise" (Low & MacMillan, 1988), the study's sample of entrepreneurs should have
been selected before they became involved in DEMO new enterprises. By evaluating
these individuals' entrepreneurial traits and characteristics before DEMO creation of a new
enterprise, the study is more likely to DEMO causality. For example, it is inappropriate to
select a sample of DEMO from a population of owner/managers of small firms that
have been in business for five years for a test of the infiuence of DEMO personality traits
on entrepreneurial behavior. By collecting personality data on an entrepreneur five years
after the entrepreneurial event, the researcher makes an assumption that the entrepre-
neur's traits, attitudes, and beliefs did not change DEMO of the entrepreneurial expe-
rience itself. The assumption that entrepreneurial traits are immutable and have some
direct infiuence on entrepreneurial behavior can and should DEMO empirically tested by
selecting samples of individuals before they become involved in creating new enter-
prises, or specific assumptions about the immutability of these traits need to be made
explicit.
I gravitate toward a hardline perspective DEMO personality-based characteristics (Mis-
chel, 1968) which posits that individuals do DEMO appear to demonstrate consistencies in
their behavior across time and in diverse situations, and that personality traits are not
very reliable predictors of whether a person will act in a particular way in a particular
situation (Ajzen, 1988; Kenrick & Funder, 1988). A study to determine whether certain
personality traits can infiuence (predict) entrepreneurial behavior needs to DEMO designed so
that causality can be clearly identified. Selecting samples of individuals before entre-
preneurial activity occurs is the most convincing way of doing DEMO
A good example of how a researcher thoughtfully selected samples of entrepreneurs
Fall, 1989 33
and non-entrepreneurs to test a particular entrepreneurial trait, risk-taking propensity,
can be found in Brockhaus (1980). Brockhaus defined the entrepreneur as the major
owner and manager of a business venture not employed elsewhere, and selected his
sample of entrepreneurs from managers who had ceased working for DEMO prior employ-
ers three months prior to his study and had at the time of the study owned and managed
a business venture. His DEMO group of non-entrepreneurs were of two types:
managers who three months prior to the study had changed organizations, and managers
who three months prior to the study had only changed positions within an organization.
When DEMO explored the risk preferences of these three samples he found that their
CDQ (Choice Dilemmas Questionnaire) score (Wallach & Kogan, 1959, 1961) were not
significantly different. In this study, both the entrepreneurs and DEMO had
undergone a career change. Both groups were facing choices about what type of career
to pursue—owner/manager or manager. The study could say DEMO about whether
risk-taking (as measured by the CDQ instrument) predicted whether individuals would
be more likely to choose an owner/manager career or DEMO manager career. Brockhaus found
that risk-taking was not a good predictor.
Careful selection of research samples of entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs helps
identify and control DEMO variation. It is therefore crucial for the entrepreneurial trait and
characteristic researcher to devote a great deal of effort to identifying what sample of
DEMO most appropriately represents the kinds of individuals the study seeks to
analyze.
HOW ARE THE TRAITS, CHARACTERISTICS, AND
BEHAVIORS MEASURED?
The selection DEMO a particular instrument to measure personality traits, characteristics,
attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors may significantly influence the findings generated. For
example, the DEMO instrument used by Brockhaus (1980) to measure risk-taking pro-
pensity has been found to be moderated by such variables as the respondent's DEMO
siveness and test anxiety (Kogan & Wallach, 1964), and other findings suggest that the
CDQ instrument may shift a respondent's perception DEMO risk (Baron et al., 1971).
Overall, when using a DEMO, a researcher must be concerned about whether the
instrument itself, and how it is administered, is a major source of the variation in the
results. Researchers should be very concerned about reliability and validity issues DEMO
using newly developed or modified instruments. If a study does not use a questionnaire
that has been previously tested with references to published reports DEMO its reliability and
validity (some good sources for information on the DEMO and validity of many
personality tests can be found in Tests in Print, III [Mitchell, 1983], The Ninth Mental
Measurements Yearbook [Mitchell, DEMO, and its supplements, and Tests, 2nd Ed.
[Sweetland & Keyser, 1986]), I suggest that, at minimum, the manuscript be accom-
DEMO by a copy of the research instrument, an analysis of the DEMO consistency
reliabilities, and any other evidence of the construct validity of DEMO measures. While
there are many sources for information on measurement issues in personality research.
Personality Assessment via Questionnaires by Angleitner and Wiggins (1986) DEMO a par-
ticularly insightful resource and guide. Researchers should also recognize that many
other issues in operationalizing a theory about entrepreneurial traits need to DEMO ad-
dressed. Problems with the appropriateness of certain designs for research studies, types
of research (field studies, field experiments, ex post facto DEMO, survey research,
etc.), methods of observation, data collection, DEMO data analysis techniques can also be
major stumbling blocks to the generation of quality manuscripts.

CONCLUSIONS
I do not want to give the impression that the criteria DEMO here will make research
on entrepreneurial traits and characteristics so daunting that no one should attempt it.
Any research project requires a significant commitment DEMO time and effort. I see these
suggestions as basic rules of the game for getting manuscripts published as well as
guidelines for generating interesting DEMO useful knowledge. Our publications are more
likely to have greater impact if they are the products of a rigorous concern for theory and
methodology.
DEMO phenomenon of entrepreneurship is inherently multidisciplinary (Gartner,
1985). For DEMO of us not trained as psychologists, sociologists, social psychologists,
etc., a useful strategy for acquiring expertise in the theories and methodologies of these
disciplines is to collaborate with colleagues with those skills. Besides joint DEMO
efforts, I would hope that most individuals contemplating new research projects DEMO
entrepreneurial traits and characteristics will disseminate their theories and research
designs to individuals familiar with current ideas and methods in social psychology
before data DEMO Most manuscripts could also benefit from informal pre-reviews
before they are submitted to a journal for review.
This article suggests that researchers submitting manuscripts DEMO entrepreneurial traits
and characteristics should: ground their studies in the context DEMO previous research,
articulate a specific theory about the nature of entrepreneurship and its relationship to the
entrepreneur, define key ideas and variables, DEMO identify and select sam-
ples, and use current social psychology and DEMO theory-based measurement in-
struments or provide construct validity evidence for newly constructed measures. Manu-
scripts that address these issues will successfully overcome the primary DEMO for
rejection.
