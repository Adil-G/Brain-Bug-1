COOPERATION AND CONFLICT: A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE HISTORY OF
THE SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL  STUDY
OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION *

Introduction
Conflict is an inevitable and pervasive aspect of organizational life.  DEMO occurs within and
between individuals, within and between teams and groups, within and between different levels
of an organizations, within and between organizations.  Conflict has been given a bad name by
its association with psychopathology, disruption, violence, civil disorder, and war.  These are
some of the harmful potentials of conflict when it takes a destructive course.  When it takes a
constructive course, conflict is potentially of considerable personal and social value.  It prevents
stagnation, it stimulates interest and curiosity, it is the medium through which problems can be
aired and creative solutions DEMO, it is the motor of personal and social change.
It is DEMO assumed that conflicts within teams in organizations should be suppressed,
that conflict impairs cooperation and productivity among the members of a team.  This may be
true when conflict takes a destructive course as in a DEMO quarrel.  However, it is apt to
strengthen the relations among team members and to enhance productivity when it takes the
form of a DEMO controversy.
In this chapter, I present an overview of the major DEMO questions addressed in the
literature related to conflict resolution, as well DEMO a historical perspective to see what progress
has been made in this area.  My premise is that anyone interested in understanding teamwork and
cooperative working should be familiar with the field of conflict resolution.  As I stated above,
conflict is inevitable in teamwork; how the conflict is managed can lead either to the
enhancement or disruption of cooperation and DEMO productivity.

Throughout my many years of empirical and theoretical work in the field DEMO conflict studies,
I have thought of conflict in the context of competition and cooperation.  I have viewed these
latter as idealized psychological processes which are rarely found in their "pure" form in nature,
DEMO, instead, are found more typically mixed together.  I have also DEMO that most forms of
conflict could be viewed as mixtures of competitive and cooperative processes and, further, that
the course of a conflict DEMO its consequences would be heavily dependent upon the nature of the
cooperative-competitive mix.  These views of conflict lead me to emphasize the link between
the social psychological studies of cooperation and competition and the studies of DEMO in my
assessment of this latter area.
I have defined conflict in the following way (Deutsch,1973 p.10): "A conflict occurs
whenever DEMO activities occur…An action that is incompatible with another action
prevents, obstructs, interferes, injures, or in some way makes the latter less likely DEMO less
effective".  Conflicts may arise between two or more parties DEMO their opposing interests, goals,
values, beliefs, preferences, or their misunderstandings about any of the forgoing.  These are
potential sources of conflict which may give rise to actions by the parties which are incompatible
DEMO one another; if they do not give rise to incompatible actions, a conflict does not exist: it is
only potential.
The terms competition and conflict are often used synonymously or interchangeably.  This
reflects a basic confusion.  Although competition produces conflict, not all instances of conflict
reflect DEMO Competition implies an opposition in the goals of the interdependent parties
such that the probability of goal attainment for one decreases as the probability DEMO the other
increases.  In conflict that is derived from competition, the incompatible action reflects
incompatible goals.  However, conflict may occur even when DEMO is no perceived or actual
incompatibility of goals.  Thus if two DEMO members of a sales group are in conflict about the
best way to increase sales or if a husband and wife are in conflict DEMO how to treat their son's
mosquito bites, it is not DEMO because they have mutually exclusive goals; here, their goals
may be  concordant.  My distinction between conflict and competition is not made merely DEMO split
hairs.  It is important and basic to a theme that DEMO much of my work.  Namely, conflict can
occur in a cooperative or a competitive context, and the processes of conflict resolution that are
likely to be displayed will be strongly influenced by the context within DEMO the conflict occurs.
At the beginning...
2
The writings of three intellectual giants - Darwin, Marx, and Freud DEMO dominated the
intellectual atmosphere during social psychology's infancy.  Each of DEMO major theorists
significantly influenced the writings of the early social psychologists on conflict as well as in
many other areas.  All three theorists appeared - on a superficial  reading - to emphasize the
competitive, destructive DEMO of conflict.  Darwin stressed "the competitive struggle for
existence" and "the survival of the fittest."  He wrote (quoted in Hyman, DEMO, p. 29):  ". . . all
nature is at DEMO, one organism with another, or with external nature.  Seeing the DEMO face
of nature, this may at first be well doubted; but reflection will inevitably prove it is too true."
Marx emphasized "class struggle," and as the struggle proceeds, "the whole society breaks DEMO
more and more into two great hostile camps, two great, directly antagonistic classes:  bourgeoisie
and proletariat."  He ends The Communist Manifesto DEMO a ringing call to class struggle: "The
proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.  They have a world to win.  Working DEMO of
all countries, unite."  Freud's view of psychosexual development DEMO largely that of constant
struggle between the biologically rooted infantile id and the socially determined, internalized
parental surrogate, the superego.  As Schachtel (DEMO, p. 10) has noted:
The concepts and language used by Freud to describe the great metamorphosis
from life in the womb to DEMO in the world abound with images of war, coercion,
reluctant DEMO, unwelcome necessity, imposed sacrifices, uneasy truce
under pressure, enforced detours and roundabout ways to return to the original
peaceful state of absence DEMO consciousness and stimulation...
Thus, the intellectual atmosphere prevalent during the period DEMO social psychology began
to emerge contributed to viewing conflict from the perspective of "competitive struggle."  Social
conditions too - the intense competition among businesses and among nations, the devastation of
World War I, the DEMO depression of the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of Nazism and DEMO
totalitarian systems - reinforced this perspective.
The vulgarization of Darwin's ideas in the form of "social Darwinism" provided an
intellectual rationale for DEMO, sexism, class superiority, and war.  Such ideas as “survival of
the fittest,” “hereditary determinism,” and "stages of evolution" were DEMO misapplied to the
relations between different human social groups - classes and nations as well as social races to
rationalize imperialist policies.  The influence of evolutionary thinking was so strong that, as a
critic suggested, DEMO gave rise to a new imperialist beatitude:  "Blessed are the DEMO, for they
shall prey upon the weak" (Banton, 1967, DEMO 48).  The rich and powerful were biologically
superior; they had achieved their positions as a result of natural selection.  It would be against
nature to interfere with the inequality and suffering of the poor DEMO weak.
3
Social Darwinism and the mode of explaining behavior in terms of innate, evolutionary
derived instincts were in retreat by the mid-1920s.  The prestige of the empirical methods in the
physical sciences, the point of view of social determinism advanced by Karl Marx and various
sociological theorists, and the findings of cultural anthropologists all contributed to their
decline.1  Since the decline of the instinctual mode of explaining such conflict phenomena as
war, intergroup hostility, and human exploitation, two others have been dominant:  the
"psychological" and the "socio-political-economic."  The "psychological" mode attempts to
DEMO such phenomena in terms of "what goes on in the minds DEMO men" (Klineberg, 1964) or
"tensions that cause war" (DEMO, 1950); in other words, in terms of the perceptions, DEMO,
values, ideology, motivations, and other psychological states and characteristics DEMO individual
men and women have acquired as a result of their experiences and as these characteristics are
activated by the particular situation and role DEMO which people are located.  The "socio-political-
economic" mode, in contrast, seeks an explanation in terms of such social, economic, and
political factors as levels of armaments, objective conflicts in economic and political interests,
and the like.  Although these modes of explanation are not mutually exclusive, there is a
tendency for partisans of the psychological mode to consider that the causal arrow points from
psychological conditions to socio-political-economic conditions DEMO for partisans of the latter to
believe the reverse is true.  DEMO any case, much of the social psychological writing in the 1930s,DEMO
1940s, and early 1950s on the topics of war, intergroup conflict, and industrial strife was largely
nonempirical, and in one vein or DEMO other.  The psychologically trained social psychologist
tended to favor the psychological DEMO; the Marxist-oriented or sociologically trained social
psychologist more often favored the DEMO mode.
The decline of social Darwinism and the instinctivist doctrines was hastened by the
development and employment of empirical methods in social psychology.  This early empirical
orientation to social psychology focused on the socialization of the DEMO; this focus was, in
part, a reaction to the instinctivist DEMO  It led to a great variety of studies, including a
number investigating cooperation and competition.  These latter studies are, in my view, the
precursors to the empirical, social psychological study of conflict.
1  DEMO is a decline, not a disappearance.  The explanation of social phenomena in terms of innate factors
justifies the status quo by arguing for DEMO immutability; such justification will always be sought by those
who fear DEMO

Early studies of cooperation and competition
Two outstanding summaries of the then-existing DEMO on cooperation and competition
were published in 1937.  One was in DEMO volume of Murphy, Murphy, and Newcomb,
Experimental Social Psychology;  the other was in the monograph “Competition and
Cooperation,” by May DEMO Doob.  It is not my intention here to repeat these summaries DEMO
rather to give you my sense of the state of the research and theorizing on cooperation-
competition in the 1920s and 1930s.
My impression DEMO that practically none of the earlier research on cooperation and competition
would be acceptable in current social psychological journals because of methodological flaws in
DEMO studies.  Almost all of them suffer from serious deficiencies in their DEMO designs.  In
addition, there is little conceptual clarity about some of the basic concepts - "competition,"
"cooperation," "self-orientation," DEMO that are used in the studies.  As a result, the operational
definitions used to create the differing experimental conditions have no consistency from DEMO
study to another or even within a given study.
Further, the DEMO studies of cooperation and competition suffered from a narrowness of
scope.  DEMO focused almost exclusively on the effects of "competition" versus "cooperation" on
individual task output.  There was no investigation of social interaction, DEMO
processes, problem-solving methods, interpersonal attitudes, attitudes toward self, attitudes
toward work, attitudes toward the group, or the like in these early DEMO of cooperation-
competition.  The focus was narrowly limited to work output.  The simplistic assumption was
made that output would be an uncomplicated function DEMO the degree of motivation induced by
competition as compared with cooperation.  DEMO purposes of most of these early investigations
appeared to be to support or reject a thesis inherent in the American ideology; namely, that
DEMO fosters greater motivation to be productive than other forms of social organization.
Field theory, conflict, and cooperation-competition
During the 1920s, 1930s, and DEMO, quite independently of the work being conducted in the
United States DEMO cooperation-competition, Kurt Lewin and his students were theorizing and
conducting research DEMO profoundly affected later work in many areas of social psychology.
Lewin's field theory - with its dynamic concepts of tension systems, "driving" and "restraining"
forces, "own" and "induced" forces, valences, level of aspiration, power fields, interdependence,
5
overlapping situations, and so on - created a new vocabulary for thinking about conflict and
cooperation-competition.
As early as 1931, employing his analysis of force fields, Lewin (1931, 1935) presented a
penetrating theoretical discussion DEMO three basic types of psychological conflict:  approach-
approach - the individual stands between two positive valences of approximately equal strength;
avoidance-avoidance - DEMO individual stands between two negative valences of approximately
equal strength; and DEMO - the individual is exposed to opposing forces deriving
from a positive and a negative valence.  Hull (1938) translated Lewin's analysis into the
terminology of the goal gradient, and Miller (1937, 1944) DEMO and did research upon it.
Numerous experimental studies supported the theoretical analysis.
My own initial theorizing on cooperation-competition (Deutsch, 1949a) was influenced by
the Lewinian thinking on tension systems which was reflected in a series DEMO brilliant experiments
on the recall of interrupted activities (Zeigarnik), the DEMO of interrupted activities
(Ovsiankina), substitutability (Mahler) and the role DEMO ego in cooperative work (Lewis and
Franklin).  But even more of my thinking was indebted to the ideas which were "in the air" at the
M.I.T. Research Center for Group Dynamics.  Ways of DEMO and explaining group
processes and group functioning, employing the language of DEMO theorizing, were under
constant discussion among the students and faculty at DEMO M.I.T. Center.  Thus, it was quite
natural that when I settled on cooperation-competition as the topic of my doctoral dissertation, I
should employ the Lewinian dynamic emphasis on goals and how they are interrelated as DEMO key
theoretical wedge into this topic.  Even more importantly, the preoccupation with understanding
group processes at the Center pressed me to formulate my DEMO about cooperation and
competition so that they would be relevant to the psychological and interpersonal processes
occurring within and between groups.  This pressure forced my theory and research (Deutsch,
1949a, 1949b) to go considerably beyond the prior social psychological work on cooperation-
competition.  My theorizing and research were concerned not only with the individual and group
outcomes of DEMO and competition but also with the social psychological processes which
would give rise to these outcomes.
My theorizing and research have been published and DEMO referred to, so there is little need
here for more than DEMO brief summary of some of the theory’s predictions, which have been
DEMO by extensive research.  Assuming that the individual action in a group DEMO more
frequently effective than bungling, among the predictions that follow from DEMO theory are that
cooperative relations (those in which the goals of DEMO parties involved are predominantly
6
positively interdependent), as compared with competitive ones, show more of these positive
characteristics:
1. Effective communication is exhibited. Ideas are verbalized, and group members are
attentive to one another, accepting of the ideas of other members, and influenced by
them.  They have fewer difficulties in DEMO with or understanding others.
2. Friendliness, helpfulness, and less obstructiveness is expressed in the discussions.
Members are more satisfied with the group and DEMO solutions and favorably impressed by
the contributions of the other group members.  In addition, members of the  cooperative
groups rate themselves high in desire to win the respect of their colleagues and in
obligation to DEMO other members.
3. Coordination of effort, divisions of labor, orientation to task achievement, orderliness in
discussion, and high productivity are manifested in DEMO cooperative groups (if the group
task requires effective communication, coordination of effort, division of labor, or
sharing of resources).
4. Feeling DEMO agreement with the ideas of others and a sense of basic similarity in beliefs
and values, as well as confidence in one's own ideas and in the value that other members
attach to those ideas, are obtained in the cooperative groups.
5. Willingness to enhance the other'DEMO power (for example, the other’s knowledge, skills,
resources) to accomplish the other's goals increases.  As the other's capabilities are
strengthened, you are strengthened, they are of value to you as DEMO as to the other.
Similarly, the other is enhanced from your DEMO and benefits from your growing
capabilities and power.
6. Defining conflicting interests as a mutual problem to be solved by collaborative effort
facilitates recognizing DEMO legitimacy of each other's interests and the necessity to search
for a solution responsive to the needs of all.  It tends to limit rather than expand the scope
of conflicting interests.  Attempts to influence the other tend to be confined to processes
of persuasion.
In contrast, a competitive process has the opposite effects:
7
1. Communication is impaired as the conflicting parties seek to gain advantage DEMO
misleading the other through use of false promises, ingratiation tactics, and
disinformation.  It is reduced and seen as futile as they recognize that they cannot trust
one another's communications to be honest or informative.
DEMO Obstructiveness and lack of helpfulness lead to mutual negative attitudes and suspicion of
one another's intentions.  One's perceptions of the other tend to focus on the person's
negative qualities and ignore the positive.
DEMO The parties to the process are unable to divide their work, DEMO one another's
efforts such that they become mirror images; if DEMO do divide the work, they feel the
need to check what DEMO other is doing continuously.
4. The repeated experience of disagreement and critical rejection of ideas reduces
confidence in oneself as well as the other.
DEMO The conflicting parties seek to enhance their own power and to reduce the power of the
other.  Any increase in the power of the other is seen as threatening to oneself.
The competitive process stimulates the DEMO that the solution of a conflict can only be
imposed by one side on the other, which in turn, leads to using coercive DEMO such as
psychological as well as physical threats and violence.  It DEMO to expand the scope of the
issues in conflict as each side seeks superiority in power and legitimacy.  The conflict
becomes a power struggle or a matter of moral principle and is no longer confined to DEMO
specific issue at a given time and place.  Escalating the conflict DEMO its motivational
significance to the participants and may make a limited defeat less acceptable and more
humiliating than a mutual disaster.
As Johnson and DEMO (1989) have detailed, these ideas have given rise to a DEMO
number of research studies indicating that a cooperative process (as compared DEMO a
competitive one) leads to greater productivity, more favorable interpersonal and intergroup
relations, better psychological health and higher self-esteem as well as more constructive
resolution of conflict.
Game theory and games
8
In 1944, Von Neumann and Morgenstern published their now-classic work, Theory DEMO Games
and Economic Behavior.  Game theory has made a major contribution DEMO social scientists by
formulating in mathematical terms the problem of conflict of interest.  However, it has not been
either its mathematics or its DEMO prescriptions for minimizing losses when facing an
intelligent adversary that have made game theory of considerable value to social psychologists.
Rather, it has been its core emphasis that the parties in conflict have interdependent interests,
DEMO their fates are woven together.  Although the mathematical and normative development DEMO
game theory has been most successful in connection with pure competitive conflict ("zero-sum"
games), game theory has also recognized that cooperative DEMO well as competitive interests may
be intertwined in conflict (as in "coalition" games or "non-zero-sum" games).
The game theory recognition of the intertwining of cooperative and competitive interests in
situations of conflict (or in Schelling's [1960] useful term, the "mixed motive" nature of conflict)
has had a productive impact on the social psychological study DEMO conflict, theoretically as well as
methodologically.  Theoretically, as least for DEMO, it helped buttress a viewpoint that I had
developed prior to DEMO acquaintance with game theory - namely, that conflicts were typically
mixtures DEMO cooperative and competitive processes and that the course of conflict would be
determined by the nature of the mixture.  This emphasis on the cooperative elements involved in
conflict ran counter to the then dominant view of DEMO as a competitive struggle.
Methodologically, game theory had an impact on DEMO even larger group of psychologists.  The
mathematical formulations of game theory DEMO the indirect but extremely valuable consequence
of laying bare some fascinating paradoxical situations in such a way that they were highly
suggestive of experimental DEMO
Game matrices as an experimental device are popular because they facilitate a precise
definition of the reward structure encountered by the subjects, and hence of the way they are
dependent upon one another.  Partly stimulated by and partly in reaction to the research using
game matrices, other research games for the study of conflict have been developed.  Siegel and
Fouraker (1960) developed a bilateral monopoly, "buyer-seller" negotiation game; Vinacke DEMO
Arkoff (1957) invented a three-person coalition game; Deutsch and Krauss (1960) constructed a
"trucking game"; Deutsch (1973) employed an "allocation" game; and many other investigators
have developed variants of these DEMO or new ones.  Pruitt and Kimmel in 1977 estimated that
well DEMO 1,000 studies had been published based on experimental games.  Much DEMO this
research, as is true in other areas of science, was mindless - being done because a convenient
experimental format was readily available.  Some of it, however, has, I believe, helped to
develop DEMO systematic understanding of conflict processes and conflict resolution.
9
Fortunately, in recent years, experimental gaming has been supplemented by other DEMO
procedures and by field studies which have overcome some of the inherent limitations of
experimental gaming.
Themes in contemporary social psychological research on conflict
DEMO psychological research on conflict, during the past thirty-five years or so, has
primarily addressed the following major questions:
(1) What are DEMO conditions which give rise to a constructive or destructive process of conflict
resolution?  In terms of bargaining and negotiation, the emphasis here is on determining
the circumstances which enable the conflicting parties to arrive at DEMO mutually satisfactory
agreement which maximizes their joint outcomes.  In a sense, this first question arises
from a focus on the cooperative potential inherent DEMO conflict.
(2) What are the circumstances, strategies, and tactics which lead one party to do better than
another in a conflict situation?  The stress here is on how one can wage conflict, or
DEMO, so as to win or at least do better than one'DEMO adversary.  This second question
emerges from a focus on the competitive DEMO of a conflict situation.
(3) What determines the nature of the agreement between conflicting parties, if they are able to
reach an agreement?  Here the concern is with the cognitive and normative factors that
DEMO people to conceive a possible agreement and to perceive it as a salient possibility for
reaching a stable agreement: an agreement which each of the conflicting parties will see
as "just" under the circumstances.  This third question is a more recent one and has been
addressed under DEMO heading of research on the social psychology of equity and justice.
(DEMO) How can third parties be used to prevent conflicts from becoming DEMO or to help
deadlocked or embittered negotiators move toward a more constructive management of
their conflicts?  This fourth question has been reflected in DEMO of mediation and in
strategies of de-escalating conflicts.
(5) How can people be educated to manage their conflicts more constructively?  This has DEMO a
concern of consultants working with leaders in industry and government and also with
those who have responsibility for educating the children in our DEMO
10
(6) How and when to intervene in prolonged, intractable conflicts? DEMO of the literature in
conflict resolution has been preventive rather than remedial in its emphasis.  It is
concerned with understanding the conditions that foster productive rather than
destructive conflict (as in question one) or developing DEMO about the
circumstances that lead to intractable, destructive conflict, in the hope of preventing such
conflict.  More recently, the reality that many DEMO, destructive conflicts exist in the
world has induced some scholars to DEMO their attention on this problem.
(7) How are we to understand why ethnic, religious, and identity conflicts frequently take an
intractable, destructive course?  With the end of the Cold War, there appears to be a
proliferation of such conflicts.  In the past ten years, DEMO in such conflicts has been
renewed.  Attention has been addressed to DEMO causes such conflict but also what can be
done after the typical atrocities of such conflict to bring about reconciliation and
reconstruction.
(8) DEMO applicable in other cultural contexts are the theories related to conflict that have
largely been developed in the United States and Western Europe?  DEMO recent years, there
has been much discussion in the literature of DEMO differences that exist in how people from
varying cultural backgrounds deal with negotiations and, more generally, manage
conflict.
In the next section, I shall attempt to describe tentative answers which social psychological
research has given DEMO foregoing questions.
What are the conditions which give rise to a constructive
or destructive process of conflict resolution?
In social psychology this question DEMO been most directly addressed in the work of my
students and myself and summarized in my book, The Resolution of Conflict: Constructive and
DEMO Processes (1973).  Our research started off with the assumption that if the parties
involved in a conflict situation had a cooperative rather DEMO competitive orientation toward one
another, they would be more likely to DEMO in a constructive process of conflict resolution.  In
my earlier research DEMO the effects of cooperation and competition upon group process, I had
DEMO that a cooperative process was more productive in dealing with a problem that a
group faces than a competitive process.  I reasoned that the same would be true in a mixed-
motive situation of conflict: A conflict could be viewed as a mutual problem facing the
11
conflicting parties.  Our initial research on trust and suspicion employing the Prisoners’
Dilemma game strongly supported my reasoning, as did  subsequent research employing DEMO
experimental formats.  I believe that this is a very important result DEMO has considerable
theoretical and practical significance.
At a theoretical level, it DEMO me to link my prior characterization of cooperation and
competitive social processes to the nature of the processes of conflict resolution which would
typically DEMO rise to constructive or destructive outcomes.  That is, I had found a way to
characterize the central features of constructive and destructive processes DEMO conflict resolution;
doing so represented a major advance beyond the characterization of outcomes as constructive or
destructive.  This was not only important in itself but it also opened up a new possibility.  At
both the theoretical and practical level, the characterization of constructive and destructive
processes of conflict created the very significant possibility that we would be able to DEMO
insight into the conditions which initiated or stimulated the development of cooperative-
constructive versus competitive-destructive processes of conflict.  Much of the research of my
students and myself has been addressed to developing this insight.
Much of DEMO early research on the conditions affecting the course of conflict was done on an
ad hoc basis.  We selected independent variables to manipulate based on our intuitive sense of
what would give rise to a cooperative DEMO competitive process. We did experiments with quite a
number of variables:  motivational orientation, communication facilities, perceived similarity of
opinions and beliefs, size of conflict, availability of threats and weapons, power differences,
third DEMO interventions, strategies and tactics of game playing by experimental stooges, the
payoff structure of the game, personality characteristics, and so on.  The results of these studies
fell into a pattern which I slowly began DEMO grasp.
All of these studies seemed explainable by the assumption, which DEMO have labeled "Deutsch's
crude law of social relations," that DEMO characteristic processes and effects elicited by a given
type of social relationship (cooperative or competitive) also tend to elicit that type of social
DEMO  Thus, cooperation induces and is induced by a perceived similarity in beliefs and
attitudes; a readiness to be helpful; openness in communication; trusting and friendly attitudes;
sensitivity to common interests and de-emphasis of DEMO interests; an orientation toward
enhancing mutual power rather than power differences; and so on.  Similarly, competition
induces and is induced by the DEMO of tactics of coercion, threat, or deception; attempts to enhance
DEMO power differences between oneself and the other; poor communication; minimization of the
12
awareness of similarities in values and increased sensitivity to opposed interests; suspicious and
hostile attitudes; the importance, rigidity, and size of the issues in conflict; and so on.
In other words, if one has DEMO knowledge of the effects of cooperative and competitive
processes, one will DEMO systematic knowledge of the conditions which typically give rise to
such processes and, by extension, to the conditions which affect whether a conflict DEMO take a
constructive or destructive course.  My early theory of cooperation DEMO competition is a theory of
the effects of cooperative and competitive processes (See earlier section on Field Theory,
Conflict, Cooperation- Competition and DEMO and Coleman, 2000, chapter 1 for a summary).
Hence, DEMO the crude law of social relations stated earlier, it follows that DEMO theory provides
insight into the conditions which give rise to cooperative and competitive processes.
The crude law is crude.  It expresses surface similarities between "effects" and "causes"; the
basic relationships are genotypical rather than phenotypical.  The crude law is crude, but it can
be improved.  Its improvement requires a linkage with other areas in social psychology,
DEMO social cognition and social perception.  Such a linkage would enable us DEMO view
phenotypes in their social environments in such a way as to lead us to perceive correctly the
underlying genotypes.  We would then be able to know under what conditions "perceived
similarity" or "threat" DEMO be experienced as having an underlying genotype different from the
one that is usually associated with its phenotype.
What are the circumstances, strategies, DEMO tactics which lead
one party to do better than another in a conflict situation?
Most of the important theoretical work by social scientists DEMO relation to this question has
been done not by social psychologists but by economists, political scientists, and those
concerned with collective bargaining.  Some of the most notable contributions have been made
by Chamberlain (1951), Schelling (1960, 1966), Stevens (1963), Walton and McKersie (DEMO),
Kahn (1965), Jervis (1970, 1976), and Snyder and Diesing (1977).  Machiavelli (1950) and
Stephen Potter (1965) earlier had described useful strategies and tactics for winning conflicts:
Machiavelli's emphasis was on how to use one's power most effectively DEMO as to intimidate or
overwhelm one's adversary; Potter's on DEMO to play upon the good will, cooperativeness, and
politeness of one's opponent so as to upset him and make him lose his "cool."  More recently,
Alinsky (1971) has described a "jujitsu" strategy that the "have-nots" can employ against the
"haves" and described various tactics of harassing and ensnaring the "haves" in their DEMO red
tape by pressuring them to live up to their own formally stated rules and procedures.
13
Social psychologists have just barely begun to tap and test the rich DEMO of ideas about
strategies and tactics for winning conflicts or for increasing one's bargaining power and
effectiveness that exist in the common folklore DEMO well as in the social and political science
literature.  This research DEMO provided some support and qualification of preexisting ideas about
bargaining strategy and tactics.  I shall briefly discuss research relating to "being ignorant,"
"being tough," "being belligerent," and "bargaining power."
"DEMO ignorant"
Common sense suggests that one is better off if one is informed rather than ignorant.
Schelling (1960) has, however, advanced DEMO interesting idea that in bargaining it is sometimes
advantageous to be in a position where you are or appear to be ignorant of your DEMO
preferences; similarly, it may give you an edge to be in a situation where you could inform your
opponent of your preferences but DEMO other hand could not so inform you.  Research (Harnett and
Cummings, 1968; Harnett, Cummings and Hughes, 1968; Cummings and Harnett, DEMO)
provides experimental support for Schelling’s idea.  In several different bargaining DEMO it
was demonstrated that a bargainer who did not have complete information about the bargaining
schedule of his opponent began bargaining with higher initial DEMO, made fewer concessions, and
earned higher profits than bargainers with complete information.  Being ignorant of what the
other wants, or appearing so, may justify to oneself and to the other a relative neglect of DEMO
other’s interests in one’s proposals; neglecting the other’s interests when they DEMO known is a
more obvious and flagrant affront.
The bargaining tactic of “ignorance,” as well as other tactics, such as “brinkmanship” and
“appearing to be irrational,” can be characterized in terms of the bargaining DEMO of “the last
clear chance.”  The basic notion here is that DEMO bargainer will gain an advantage if he can appear
to commit himself irrevocably so that the last clear chance of avoiding mutual disaster rests DEMO
his opponent.  A child who works himself up to the point DEMO he will have a temper tantrum if
his parents refuse to let him sit where he wants in the restaurant is employing this doctrine.  So is
the driver who cuts in front of someone on a DEMO while appearing to be deaf to the insistent
blasts of the other’s horn.  Such tactics do not always work.  They seem most apt DEMO do so when
the situation is asymmetrical (you can use the DEMO but your opponent cannot) and when your
opponent does not have DEMO strong need to improve or uphold his reputation for “resolve” or
“toughness.”
“Being tough”
14
"Bargaining toughness" has been defined experimentally in terms of setting a DEMO level of
aspiration, making high demands, and offering fewer concessions or smaller concessions than
one's opponent.  It is a widely held view, to quote the late Leo Durocher, that "nice guys finish
last."  The results of many experiments (see Magenau and Pruitt, 1978) support a more complex
conclusion, stated by Bartos (1970, p. 62): "Toughness plays a dual role and has contradictory
consequences.  On DEMO one hand, toughness decreases the likelihood of an agreement, while on
the other hand, it increases the payoffs of those who survive this possibility of a failure."  A
relentlessly tough approach throughout bargaining appears DEMO result in worse outcomes than a
more conciliatory approach (Hamner and DEMO, 1978; Harnett and Vincelette, 1978).  There is,
however, some evidence to suggest that initial toughness in terms of high opening demands,
combined with a readiness to reciprocate concessions, may facilitate a fuller exploration of the
alternative possibilities of agreement and lead to the DEMO of an agreement which maximizes
payoffs to the bargainers (Kelley and DEMO, 1972); premature tendencies to reach an
agreement without full exploration DEMO the possibilities may be prevented by tough, initial
positions (Deutsch, DEMO).
"Being belligerent"
Since the initial research of Deutsch and DEMO (1960) demonstrated the deleterious effects
of threat upon bargaining, there DEMO been a deluge of bargaining experiments bearing upon the
use of weapons, threats, fines, punishments, rewards, promises, and the like.  Tedeschi,
Schlenker, and Bonoma (1973, p. 141) have summarized the DEMO of this research as follows:
"Threats seldom improve and almost DEMO decrease a bargainer's outcomes if his adversary is
similarly armed and the values are important to both parties.  Yet when threats are available,
bargainers are tempted to use them."  Research (see Deutsch, DEMO) also demonstrates that
threats have considerable reputational costs: a "threatener" as compared to a "promiser" is
viewed much more negatively and DEMO much less likely to get compliance.
Although belligerent, coercive tactics usually DEMO negotiation, it is evident that one is apt
to yield to DEMO adversary when there is a gun pressed against one's head.  DEMO can be
successful, especially when the power of the conflicting parties DEMO unequal.  Although coercion
can be successful, its success is usually limited to immediate compliance; the long-term
consequences of the use of such tactics are usually counterproductive.
"Bargaining power"
15
Common sense would suggest that a bargainer is likely to be better DEMO if he has more power
than the adversary.  The results of DEMO psychological research indicate that the situation is
more complex than it first seems.  Experimentally, bargaining power is sometimes defined as the
relative power DEMO each of the bargainers to inflict harm upon one another; the DEMO desirability
of the alternatives to bargaining that are available to each of the bargainers; the relative time
pressure on each bargainer to reach an agreement; and so forth.  The research evidence
(Magenau and Pruitt, DEMO; Rubin and Brown, 1975) indicates that when bargaining power is
DEMO, agreement is relatively easy to reach and the outcomes to the DEMO are high.  When
bargaining power is somewhat unequal, a power struggle often ensues as the bargainer with more
power tries to assert superior DEMO and as these are resisted by the bargainer with lesser power;
the result of this struggle is that the agreement is difficult to DEMO and the bargainers have low
outcomes.  When bargaining power is markedly DEMO, the differences in power are more
likely to be accepted as DEMO and lead to quick agreement, with the advantage going to the
DEMO powerful bargainer.  However, if the differences in power are not viewed as providing a
legitimization of relatively low outcomes to the low-power bargainer, he will resist what he
considers to be greed and exploitation; agreement here also will be difficult, and outcomes will
be low.  Differences DEMO bargaining power may lead the bargainer with greater power to make
claims which he feels are legitimate but which he cannot force the other DEMO accept; the bargainer
with lesser power may resist the claims as DEMO exploitative and illegitimate and as a way of
asserting his equal status as a person.  His resistance causes the low-power bargainer to suffer
relatively more than the high-power bargainer, but the high-power bargainer also suffers.  DEMO
essence, the bargaining research demonstrates that having higher power than one'DEMO bargaining
opponent may be less advantageous than having equal power if your fellow bargainer is apt to
resist any greater claims that you might DEMO as a result of your greater power.
From this brief and very incomplete survey of some of the experimental research bearing on
the strategy DEMO tactics of waging conflict, it is evident that social psychological research DEMO
given some support for surprising tactics ("being ignorant") and has raised some doubts about
common assumptions relating to the advantages to be DEMO from "toughness" as a strategy,
from "coercive tactics," DEMO from "superior bargaining power."
The extensive research literature on negotiation (summarized in such books as Bazerman and
Neal, 1992; Breslin and DEMO (1991); Deutsch, 1973; Deutsch and Coleman, 2000; Kritter,DEMO
1994; Lewicki and Letterer, 1985a, 1985b; Lewiki, Sanders, and Minton, 1999; Pruitt, 1981;
Pruitt and Carnevale, 1993; Rubin, Pruitt, and Kim, 1986; Thompson, 1998) has investigated
16
many of the strategies and tactics that relate to both "integrative" DEMO "win-win" bargaining (those
related to the first listed question above) and "distributive" bargaining (those related to the
second listed question): only some of which have been discussed here.  For a fuller discussion of
such topics as "concession making", "the use of time DEMO", "promises and threats",
"establishing credibility", "enhancing bargaining power", "building rapport", etc, the books listed
above should DEMO consulted.
What determines the nature of the agreement between conflicting parties if they are able to
reach an agreement?
A bargain is defined DEMO Webster's Unabridged Dictionary as "an agreement between parties
settling what DEMO shall give and receive in a transaction between them."  The definition of
"bargain" fits under common social science definitions of the term "social norm."  What
determines the agreement or social norm for settling DEMO issues in conflict?  Two compatible
ideas have been advanced in answer to this question, one related to "perceptual prominence" and
the other to "distributive justice."
Schelling (1960) has suggested that perceptually prominent alternatives serve a key function
in permitting bargainers to come to an DEMO  Research has provided some support for
Schelling's idea (see Magenau and Pruitt,1978, for a summary).
Homans (1961, 1974) DEMO suggested that the principle of distributive justice would play a
role in determining how people would decide to allocate the awards and costs to DEMO distributed
between them.  Although Homans was not primarily concerned with conflict DEMO bargaining, it is
evident that his conception of distributive justice does DEMO exclude them.  In his discussion,
Homans has emphasized one particular DEMO or rule of distributive justice, that of
"proportionality" or "equity":  In a just distribution, rewards will be distributed among
individuals DEMO proportion to their contributions.  "Equity theorists" such as Adams (1963, 1965,
1976) and Walster, Walster, and Berscheid (1978) DEMO continued Homans's emphasis on the
rule of proportionality and have elaborated a theory and stimulated much research to support the
view that psychological DEMO and emotional distress will be encountered if the rule of
proportionality is violated.  In recent years, other social psychologists - Lerner (1975), Leventhal
(1976), Sampson (1969), and myself (Deutsch, 1974, 1975) - have stressed that proportionality is
only one of many common canons of distributive justice.  We know very little about what makes
a given rule of justice stand out as saliently appropriate in a given DEMO of conflict.
However, a number of us (Deutsch, 1975, Lamm and Kayser, 1978a,b; Lerner, 1975; Leventhal,
17
1976; Mikula and Schwinger, 1978; Sampson, 1975) have articulated hypotheses about factors
favoring the selection of one or another rule and done DEMO experiments.  It seems evident that
if a conflict is experienced as DEMO been resolved unjustly, it is not likely that the conflict has
DEMO adequately resolved; similarly, a bargaining agreement that is viewed as unjust is not apt to
be a stable one.  "Justice" and "DEMO" are intimately intertwined; the sense of injustice can
give rise to conflict, and conflict can produce injustice.
Social psychological research on justice and conflict is too new to have led to definitive
results.  However, DEMO me note the direction of my thinking in this area.  I DEMO applied and
elaborated my crude hypothesis of social relations (the typical DEMO of a given type of
social relation tends to elicit that relation) so as to be relevant to the question of what rule of
justice will predominate in a group or social system.  I (Deutsch, 1975; 1985) have developed
rationales to explain the tendency for economically DEMO groups to use the principle of
equity; for solidarity-oriented groups to DEMO the principle of equality; and for caring-oriented
groups to use the DEMO of need.  I have then characterized typical effects of economically
oriented DEMO, solidarity-oriented relations, and caring relations and have hypothesized that
these different kinds of typical effects will elicit different principles of distributive justice.
Thus, among the typical consequences of an economic orientation (Diesing, 1962) are: (1)
the development of a set of values which includes DEMO, a means-end schema, neutrality
or impartiality with regard to means, DEMO competition; (2)  the turning of man and everything
associated with him into commodities - including labor, time, land, capital, personality, social
relations, ideas, art, and enjoyment; (3)  the development of measurement procedures which
enable the value of different amounts and types DEMO commodities to be compared; and (4)  the
tendency for economic activities to expand in scope and size.  The crude hypothesis advanced
above would imply that an economic orientation and the principle of equity are DEMO to be
dominant in a group or social system if its situation is characterized by impersonality,
competition, maximization, an emphasis on comparability DEMO than uniqueness, largeness in
size or scope, and so on.  DEMO experimental hypotheses could readily be elaborated: the more
competitive the people DEMO in a group, the more likely they are to use equity DEMO than equality
or need as the principle of distributive justice; the DEMO impersonal the relations of the members
of a group are, the DEMO likely they are to use equity; and so forth.
Results in DEMO laboratory, as well as in the laboratories of other investigators, are consistent
with my crude hypothesis.  It seems likely that the reason "DEMO" has been the central principle
of distributive justice to social psychologists DEMO that there has been an unwitting acceptance of the
18
view that the dominant orientation of American society, a competitive-economic orientation, DEMO a
universally valid orientation.  This is too parochial a perspective.  Equity is only one of many
principles of distributive justice.  It is evident that questions of justice may arise in noneconomic
social relations and may DEMO decided in terms that are unrelated to input-output ratios.  For a DEMO
discussion of "justice and conflict" see Deutsch and Coleman (2000 DEMO 2) and for a
comprehensive discussion of the social psychology of DEMO see Tyler, Boechman, Smith, and
Hus (1997).
How can third parties be used to prevent conflicts from becoming destructive or to DEMO
deadlocked or embittered negotiators move toward a more constructive management of
their conflicts?
Kenneth Kressel and Dean Pruitt have edited an issue of DEMO Journal of Social Issues (1985)
and published a book (1989) on mediation research which provide a definitive review of the
work being done in this area.  As they point out, informal mediation is DEMO of the oldest forms of
conflict resolution and formal mediation has been practiced in international and labor-
management conflicts for many years.  More recently, formal mediation has been increasingly
applied to an ever-widening array of disputes in such areas as divorcing, small-claims cases,
neighborhood feuds, landlord-tenant DEMO, environmental and public-resource controversies,
industrial disputes, school conflicts, and DEMO cases.  Following in the wake of the explosion of
the practice DEMO mediation (and of the proliferation of textbooks and "how-to-do-it" books DEMO
mediation), there has been important but modest growth in research and theorizing on this topic.
Most of the research and theorizing has occurred DEMO the past two decades.
Here, I shall highlight some of the DEMO points which emerge from the cogent summary by
Kressel and Pruitt of the work in this area.
There is considerable evidence of user satisfaction DEMO mediation and
some evidence that the agreements reached through mediation are both less costly to the
conflicting parties and more robust  than traditional adjudication (Kressel, 2000).  However,
there is strong evidence to suggest that mediation has dim prospects of being successful under
adverse circumstances.  As Kressel and Pruitt (1989, p. 405) have succinctly expressed it:
"Intensely conflicted disputes involving parties of widely disparate power, with low DEMO
to settle, fighting about matters of principle, suffering from discord or ambivalence within their
own camps, and negotiating over scarce resources are likely to defeat even the most adroit
mediators."
19
Kressel and Pruitt, in characterizing the research describing what mediators do, DEMO that
their diverse actions can be grouped under four major headings: (1) establishing a working
alliance with the parties; (2) improving DEMO climate between them; (3) addressing the issues; and
(4) applying pressure for settlement.  As Kressel (2000, p. 525-526) points DEMO:
Mediation should be helpful in any conflict in which the basic framework for negotiation
is present (Moore, 1996).  The framework includes these elements:
The parties can be identified.
They are interdependent.
They DEMO the basic cognitive, interpersonal, and emotional capabilities to represent
themselves.
They have interests that are not entirely incompatible.
They face alternatives to consensual DEMO that are undesirable (for example, a
costly trial).
Mediation is especially likely to prove useful whenever there are additional obstacles that
would DEMO unassisted negotiations likely to fail:
 Interpersonal barriers (intense negative DEMO, a dysfunctional pattern of
communicating).
 Substantive barriers (strong disagreement over the issues, perceived incompatibility of
interests, serious differences about the "facts" or circumstances).
 Procedural barriers (existence of impasse, absence of forum for negotiating).
Although many disputes meet these formal criteria, getting mediation started turns out to be
something of a challenge.  In interpersonal disputes of all kinds, one-thirds to two-thirds of those
given the opportunity to use formal mediation decline it.  It is also apparent that in work settings
where informal mediation could be used (as by a manager), the would-be mediator declines to
intervene, looks the other way, or chooses to employ power and authority rather than the skills of
facilitation.  Characteristics of the social environment, the disputing parties, and the potential
mediator are among the variables that determine whether or not mediation DEMO
I have, from my theoretical perspective, expressed similar ideas, somewhat DEMO in
answer to the question:  What framework can guide a third person who seeks to intervene
therapeutically if negotiations are deadlocked or unproductive DEMO of misunderstandings,
faulty communications, the development of hostile attitudes, or the inability to discover a
mutually satisfying solution?   I suggest that such a framework is implicit in the ideas that I have
described DEMO  The third-party seeks to produce a cooperative problem-solving orientation to
the DEMO by creating the conditions which characterize an effective cooperative problem-
20





solving process: these conditions are the typical effects of a successful cooperative process.
Helping the conflicting parties to develop a cooperative, problem-solving orientation to their
conflict may be sufficient when the conflicting parties have reasonably well-developed DEMO
problem-solving and decision-making skills.  Often they do not, and hence, DEMO need tutelage in
these skills if they are to deal with their problem successfully.  And, often, conflicting parties do
not have sufficient substantive knowledge concerning the issues in conflict to manage them
constructively.  Here, DEMO, they may need tutelage by a third party if their conflict DEMO to be
resolved sensibly.
Third-parties (mediators, conciliators, process consultants, therapists, counselors, etc.) who
are called upon to provide assistance in a conflict require four kinds of skills if they are to have
the DEMO required to deal with the diverse situations mediators face.  The first DEMO of skills
are those related to the third-party's establishing an effective working relationship with each of
the conflicting parties so that they will DEMO the third-party, communicate freely with her, and be
responsive to her suggestions regarding an orderly process for negotiations.  The second are
those related to establishing a cooperative problem-solving attitude among the conflicting parties
toward their DEMO  Much of the earlier discussion of my theoretical work on conflict
DEMO focuses on this area.  Third are the skills involved in developing DEMO creative group
process and group decision-making.  Such a process clarifies the DEMO of the problems that the
conflicting parties are confronting (reframing their DEMO positions into a joint problem to
be solved), helps to expand the range of alternatives that are perceived to be available, facilitates
realistic assessment of their feasibility as well as desirability, and facilitates the implementation
of agreed-upon solutions.  And, fourth, it is often helpful for the third-party to have considerable
substantive knowledge about the issues around which the DEMO centers.  Substantive
knowledge could enable the mediator to see possible solutions DEMO might not occur to the
conflicting parties and it would permit her to help them assess proposed solutions more
realistically.
It seems reasonable to DEMO that the diverse situations facing mediators will emphasize one
or another of the four skills just described.  When the conflicting parties have suspicions about
mediation, the skills involved in establishing a good working relationship with the conflicting
parties are especially important; when the relationship between the conflicting parties is a poor
one, the skills involved in establishing a cooperative problem-solving attitude between the
parties is crucial; when the conflicting parties have inadequate techniques for solving problems
and making effective joint-decisions, then the mediator needs skills related to facilitating
creative group decision-making; and when the conflicting parties have little knowledge of the
21
substantive issues they are describing, the knowledgeable mediator can be a very helpful
resource person on such issues.
It seems reasonable to assume that DEMO will differ in the kinds of skills they have
mastered and, DEMO, one can expect that the effectiveness of mediation will be considerably
DEMO upon how well-matched the mediator’s skills are with the needs of the case being
mediated.  There are undoubtedly some “universally competent” mediators who can be
successful across a wide variety of cases but it is safe DEMO say that they are probably rare.
Research has indicated that mediators differ in their styles and skills and also in their
effectiveness in particular DEMO  However, not enough research has been done to make
definitive statements about the conditions under which different styles and approaches to
mediation are DEMO effective.
Kressel (2000) classifies mediator style into two major types, DEMO of which has two
subtypes: task-oriented and social-emotional.   The first DEMO of the task-oriented style is the
settlement-oriented mediator who is primarily interested in reaching agreements on any terms
acceptable to the conflicting parties.  By contrast, the problem-solving subtype attaches greater
importance to sound problem solving than to settlement per se.  Both subtypes, Kressel indicates,
are able DEMO resolve low-level conflicts but the problem-solving style is more effective in
providing durable settlements when there is a high conflict.
Mediators with social-emotional styles DEMO less on the issues and more on opening lines of
communication and clarifying underlying feelings and emotions, with the view that once this is
accomplished, the conflicting parties should and will be able to work through the issues to their
own solution.
Transformational mediation (elaborated by Bush & Folger, 1994; Folger & Bush, 1998) is
considered to be DEMO social-emotional subtype.  It focuses not only on the relationship between the
DEMO parties through emphasizing recognition (which refers to improving the capacity of
DEMO disputants to become responsive to the needs and perspectives of the other) but also on
empowerment (which refers to strengthening each party's DEMO to analyze its respective needs
in the conflict and to make effective decisions).  The optimistic hope of the advocates of
transformative mediation is that the conflicting parties who are subjected to such mediation will
be DEMO transformed whether or not they are able to reach a settlement.  DEMO advocates are
critical of settlement or problem-solving orientations to mediation.  They DEMO that such
22
orientations narrow the parties' opportunity to become self-reflective and autonomous as well as
aware of the other's separate reflective and distinctive reality.2
As DEMO states (2000, p. 536); "Polemical claims not withstanding, there is no empirical
evidence for preferring one mediation style over another".  And, I add, it seems likely that the
different mediation styles DEMO apt to be differently suitable for different types of issues, parties,DEMO
circumstances, and social contexts.
To sum up, research on mediation is in its early stages.  The research has already
demonstrated a high level of user satisfaction in a number of different contexts and it has DEMO
suggested that the robustness of agreements and the economy of the process is greater than in
traditional methods.  But there is as yet insufficient understanding of how to mediate difficult
conflicts in adverse circumstances or how DEMO make the most effective match between mediator
characteristics and the characteristics of the case to be mediated.
How can people be educated to manage DEMO conflicts more constructively?
During the past two decades, there has DEMO a rapid proliferation of training in conflict
resolution - for industry, DEMO government, for families, and for schools - and the publication of
many textbooks and how-to-do-it manuals in this area.  Unfortunately, there has DEMO very little
research to assess the effectiveness and consequences of such training.  Most of the existing
research has been immediate “consumer satisfaction” studies in which the participants in the
training program evaluate their training and indicate DEMO useful the training has been for them.
The good news is that these studies indicate a high level of immediate consumer satisfaction; the
bad news is that there have been only a few studies which have DEMO the more enduring
consequences of such training.  "More enduring" in DEMO instances refers to effects that last for
six months or a year (see Bodine and Crawford, 1998, Deutsch and Coleman, 2000, chapter 27,
Johnson and Johnson, 2000, and Jones and Kmitter, 2000 for reviews of the existing research).
2See Robert Kegan (1994) DEMO his theory of development of different orders of consciousness which
suggests that the transformation that Bush and Folger seek is a desirable movement from DEMO third stage of
development where one is socially determined by one's loyalties, group membership, and cultural
assumptions- to a fourth stage of DEMO where one is self-knowledgeable, self-reflecting, and self-
determining in relation to others and is able to recognize this potential in others.  Kegan’s research
indicates that such a transformation is often difficult and slow to achieve.
DEMO
There are many different conflict resolution programs which vary as a function DEMO the age,
occupation, and types of conflicts on which they DEMO  I have examined many of them and
believe that there are DEMO common elements running through them.  These common elements, I
believe, DEMO from the recognition that a constructive process of conflict resolution is similar to
an effective, cooperative problem-solving process (where the conflict is perceived DEMO the mutual
problem to be solved) while a destructive process is DEMO to a win-lose, competitive struggle
(Deutsch, 1973).  In effect, most conflict resolution training programs seek to instill the attitudes,
knowledge, and skills which are conducive to effective, cooperative problem-solving and to
DEMO the attitudes and habitual responses which give rise to win-lose struggles.  DEMO I
list the central elements which are included in many training programs but I do not have the
space to describe the ingenious techniques DEMO are employed in teaching them.  The sequence in
which they are DEMO varies as a function of the nature of the group being taught.  Below, I
describe  what my students have labeled as “Deutsch’s Twelve Commandments of Conflict
Resolution.”
1. Know what type of conflict you are DEMO in.  There are 3 major types: the zero-sum
conflict (a DEMO win-lose conflict), the mixed-motive (both can win, both can lose, one can win
and the other can lose), and the pure cooperative (both can win or both can lose).  It is DEMO
to know what kind of conflict you are in because the different types require different types of
strategies and tactics.  The common tendency is for inexperienced parties to define their conflict
as "win-lose" even though DEMO is a mixed-motive conflict.
In a zero-sum conflict one seeks to amass, mobilize, and utilize the various resources of
power in such a DEMO that one can bring to bear in the conflict more effective, DEMO power
than one's adversary; or if this is not possible DEMO the initial area of conflict, one seeks to transform
the arena DEMO conflict into one in which one's effective power is greater than one's adversary.
Thus, if a bully challenges you to a fight because you won't "lend" him money and he is stronger
DEMO you, you might arrange to change the conflict from a physical DEMO to a legal
confrontation by involving the police or other legal authority.  Other strategies and tactics in
win-lose conflicts involve outwitting, misleading, seducing, blackmailing, and the various forms
of the black arts which have DEMO discussed by Machiavelli, Potter, Schelling, and Alinsky,
among others.  The strategy and tactics of the resolution of cooperative conflicts involve
primarily DEMO fact-finding and research as well as rational persuasion.  The strategy and
DEMO involved in mixed-motive conflicts are mainly what are discussed below.
24
2. Become aware of the causes and consequences of violence and of DEMO alternatives to
violence, even when one is very angry.  Become aware of what makes you very angry; learn the
healthy and unhealthy ways you have of expressing anger.  Learn how to actively channel your
anger in ways that are not violent and are not likely to provoke DEMO from the other.
Understand that violence begets violence and that if you "win" an argument by violence, the
other will try to get even in some other way.  Learn alternatives to violence in dealing with
conflict.
3. Face conflict rather than avoid it.  Recognize that conflict may make you anxious and
that you may try to avoid it.  Learn the typical defenses you employ to evade conflict - e.g.,
denial, suppression, becoming overly agreeable, rationalization, postponement, premature
conflict resolution.  Become aware of the negative consequences of evading a conflict -
irritability, tension, persistence of the problem, etc.  Learn what kinds of conflicts are best
avoided rather than confronted - e.g., conflicts that will evaporate shortly, those that are
inherently unresolvable, win-lose conflicts which you are unlikely DEMO win.
4. Respect yourself and your interests, respect the other and DEMO or her interests.  Personal
insecurity and the sense of vulnerability often DEMO people to define conflicts as "life and death,"
win-lose struggles even when they are relatively minor, mixed-motive conflicts, and this
definition DEMO lead to "conflict avoidance," "premature conflict resolution," or "DEMO
involvement in the conflict."  Helping people to develop a respect for themselves and their
interests enables them to see their conflicts in reasonable DEMO and facilitates their
constructive confrontation.  Helping people to learn to respect DEMO other and the other's interests
inhibits the use of competitive tactics of power, coercion, deprecation, and deception which
commonly escalate the issues in conflict and often lead to violence.
5. Distinguish clearly between "interests" and "positions."  Positions may be opposed but
interests may not DEMO  Often when conflicting parties reveal the interests underlying their
positions, it is possible to find a solution which suits them both.
6. Explore DEMO interests and the other's interests to identify the common and compatible
interests that you both share.  Identifying shared interests makes it easier to deal constructively
with the interests that you perceive as being opposed.  A full exploration of one another's
interests increases empathy and facilitates subsequent DEMO
7. Define the conflicting interests between oneself and the other as a mutual problem to be
solved cooperatively.  Define the conflict in the smallest terms possible, as a "here-now-this"
25
conflict rather than as a conflict between personalities or general principles - DEMO, as a conflict
about a specific behavior rather than about who DEMO a better person.  Diagnose the problem clearly
and then creatively seek DEMO options for dealing with the conflict that lead to mutual gain.  DEMO no
option for mutual gain can be discovered, seek to agree DEMO a fair rule or procedure for deciding
how the conflict will be resolved.
8. In communicating with the other, listen attentively and speak so as to be understood: this
requires the active attempt to take the perspective of the other and to check continually one's
success in DEMO so.  One should listen to the other's meaning and emotion DEMO such a way that the
other feels understood as well as is understood.  Similarly, you want to communicate to the other
one's DEMO and feelings in such a way that you have good evidence that he or she understands
the way you think and feel.  The feeling of being understood, as well as effective
communication, enormously facilitates constructive DEMO
Skills in taking the perspective of others and in obtaining feedback about the effectiveness of
one's communications are important.  Role reversal seems to be helpful in developing an
understanding of the perspective of the other DEMO in providing checks on how effective the
communication process has been.
9. Be alert to the natural tendencies to bias, misperceptions, misjudgments, and stereotyped
thinking that commonly occur in oneself as well as the other DEMO heated conflict.  These errors
in perception and thought interfere with communication, make empathy difficult, and impair
problem-solving.  Psychologists can provide a check DEMO of the common forms of misperception
and misjudgment occurring during intense conflict.  These include black-white thinking,
demonizing the other, shortening of one'DEMO time-perspective, narrowing of one's range of
perceived options, and the fundamental attribution error.  The fundamental attribution error is
illustrated in the tendency to attribute the aggressive actions of the other to the other's
DEMO while attributing one's own aggressive actions to external circumstances (such DEMO the
other's hostile actions).  The ability to recognize and DEMO one's misperceptions and
misjudgments clears the air and facilitates similar acknowledgment by the other.
10. Develop skills for dealing with difficult conflicts so DEMO one is not helpless nor hopeless
when confronting those who are more powerful, those who don't want to engage in constructive
conflict resolution, or those who use dirty tricks. It is important to recognize that one becomes
less vulnerable to intimidation by a more powerful other, to someone who refuses to cooperate
except on his or her terms, or to someone who plays dirty tricks (deceives, welches on an
26
agreement, personally attacks you, etc.) if you realize that you usually have a choice: you don't
have to stay in the relationship with the other. The alternative may not be great but it may DEMO
better than staying in the relationship.  The freedom to choose prevents DEMO other, if he or she
benefits from the relationship, from making the relationship unacceptable to you. Second, it is
useful to be open and explicit to the other about what he or she is doing DEMO is upsetting you and
to indicate the effects that these actions are having on you.  Third, it is wise to avoid
reciprocating the DEMO's noxious behavior and to avoid attacking the other personally for his
behavior (i.e., criticize the behavior and not the person); doing DEMO often leads to an escalating
vicious spiral.
A phrase that I have found useful in characterizing the stance one should take in difficult (as
well as easy) conflicts is to be "firm, fair, and DEMO"  Firm in resisting intimidation,
exploitation, and dirty tricks; fair in holding to one's moral principles and not reciprocating the
other'DEMO immoral behavior despite his or her provocations; and friendly in the DEMO that one is
willing to initiate and reciprocate cooperation.
11. Know oneself and how one typically responds in different sorts of conflict situations.  As
I have suggested earlier, conflict frequently evokes anxiety.  In clinical work, I have found that
the anxiety is often based upon unconscious fantasies DEMO being overwhelmed and helpless in the
face of the other's aggression or of being so angry and aggressive oneself that one will destroy
DEMO other.  Different people deal with their anxieties about conflict in different DEMO  I have
found it useful to emphasize six different dimensions of DEMO with conflict which can be used
to characterize a person's predispositions to respond to conflict.  Being aware of one's
predispositions may allow one to modify them when they are inappropriate in a given conflict.
(a) Conflict avoidance - excessive involvement in conflict.  Conflict avoidance is DEMO
in denial, repression, suppression, avoidance, and continuing postponement of facing the
conflict.  Excessive involvement in conflict is sometimes expressed in a preoccupation with
conflict, a chip on one's shoulder, a tendency to DEMO out conflict to demonstrate that one is not
afraid of conflict.
(DEMO) Hard - soft.  Some people are prone to take a tough, aggressive, dominating, unyielding
response to conflict fearing that otherwise they will be taken advantage of and be considered
soft.  Others are afraid that they will be considered to be mean, hostile, or presumptuous, and as
a consequence, they are excessively gentle and unassertive.  They often DEMO the other to "read
27
their minds" and know what they want even though they are not open in expressing their
interests.
(c) Rigid - loose.  Some people immediately seek to organize and to control the situation by
setting the DEMO, defining the rules, etc.  They feel anxious if things threaten DEMO get out of
control and feel threatened by the unexpected.  As DEMO consequence, they are apt to push for rigid
arrangements and rules DEMO get upset by even minor deviations.  At the other extreme, there are
some people who are aversive to anything that seems formal, limiting, controlling, or
constricting.
(d) Intellectual - emotional.  At one extreme, emotion is repressed, controlled, or isolated so
that no relevant emotion is felt or expressed as one communicates one's thoughts.  The lack of
appropriate emotional expressiveness may seriously impair communication: the other may take
your lack of emotion as an indicator that you have no real DEMO to your interests and that
you lack genuine concern for the other's interests.  At the other extreme, there are some people
who DEMO that only feelings are real and that words and ideas are not to be taken seriously
unless they are thoroughly soaked in emotion.  Their emotional extravagance impairs the ability
to mutually explore ideas and to develop DEMO solutions to impasses; it also makes it difficult
to differentiate the DEMO from the insignificant, if even the trivial is accompanied with
intense DEMO
(e) Escalating versus minimizing.  At one extreme, there are some people who tend to
experience any given conflict in the largest possible DEMO  The issues are cast so that what is at
stake involves DEMO's self, one's family, one's ethnic group, precedence DEMO all-time, or the like.
The specifics of the conflict get lost DEMO it escalates along the various dimensions of conflict: the
size and DEMO of the immediate issues involved; the number of motives and participants
DEMO on each side of the issue; the size and number of DEMO principles and precedents that
are perceived to be at stake; the DEMO that the participants are willing to bear in relation to the
conflict; the number of norms of moral conduct from which behavior toward the other side is
exempted; and the intensity of negative attitudes toward the other side.  Escalation of the conflict
makes the conflict more difficult to resolve constructively except when the escalation proceeds
so rapidly that its absurdity DEMO becomes self-apparent.  At the other extreme, there are people
who tend to minimize their conflicts.  They are similar to the conflict avoiders but, unlike the
avoiders, they do recognize the existence of the conflict.  However, by minimizing the
seriousness of the differences between self and other, by not recognizing how important the
matter is to self and to other, one can produce serious misunderstandings.  One may also restrict
28
the effort and work that one may need to devote to the DEMO in order to resolve it
constructively.
(f) Compulsively revealing versus compulsively concealing.  At one extreme there are people
who feel a compulsion to reveal whatever they think and feel about the other and their
suspicions, hostilities, and fears - in the most blunt, unrationalized and unmodulated DEMO  Or
they may feel they have to communicate every doubt, sense of inadequacy, or weakness they
have about themselves.  At the other DEMO, there are people who feel that they cannot reveal
any of DEMO feelings or thoughts without seriously damaging their relationship to the other.
Either extreme can impair the development of a constructive relationship.  One, in DEMO, should
be open and honest in communication but, appropriately so, DEMO into account realistically the
consequences of what one says or does not say and the current state of the relationship.
12. Finally, throughout conflict, one should remain a moral person - i.e., a person who DEMO
caring and just - and should consider the other as a member of one's moral community - i.e., as
someone who is entitled to care and justice.  In the heat of conflict, there is DEMO the tendency to
shrink one's moral community and to exclude the other from it:  this permits behavior toward the
other which one DEMO otherwise consider morally reprehensible.  Such behavior escalates
conflict and turns it DEMO the direction of violence and destruction.
How and when to intervene in protracted, intractable conflict?
Coleman (2000, p. 429) has characterized DEMO intractable conflict as "one that is recalcitrant,
intense, deadlocked, DEMO extremely difficult to resolve".   Such conflicts persist over time, DEMO
usually escalate (Fisher, 2000), and tend to take on a life of their own.  I have termed the social
process involved in such conflicts, a malignant social process (Deutsch, 1983).
Perfectly sane and intelligent people, groups, and nations – once caught up in DEMO a
malignant process enmesh themselves in a web of interactions and aggressive -  defensive
maneuvers which instead of improving their situation, make both DEMO feel less secure and more
burdened.  They trap themselves in a DEMO process that leads to outcomes of mutual loss and
harm.  In DEMO a social process both sides come to be right in believing that the other side is
hostile, malevolent, and intent on inflicting harm.  Their interactions provide ample justification
for such beliefs.  Typically, in such DEMO conflict, the participants see no way of extricating
29
themselves without becoming vulnerable to an unacceptable loss in a value central DEMO their self-
identities, self-esteems, or security.
A number of key elements contribute to the development and perpetuation of such a process.
They include: (1) An anarchic social situation, which provides no basis for mutual trust, in
which an attempt by one party to increase its own security or welfare- without regard to the
security or welfare of others- DEMO experienced as a threat by the others.  (2) A win-lose DEMO
competitive orientation to the conflict.  (3) Inner conflict within each DEMO the parties, that are
displaced, suppressed, or channeled into the DEMO conflict. (4) Cognitive rigidity, which limits
the ability to search DEMO or create mutually satisfactory agreements.  (5) Misjudgments and
misperceptions which DEMO negativity toward the other and  toward possible solutions.  (6)
DEMO development and investment in the skills, attitudes, and institutions involved in waging and
perpetuating the conflict.  (7) Self-fulfilling prophecies, in which DEMO's hostile behavior toward
the other elicits a negative response form the other which confirms one's negative view of the
other.  (8) Vicious escalating spirals, which often results from the biased tendency of each side
to see their own aggressive-defensive behaviors as justified and the other DEMO's as unjustified.
And (9) A gamesmanship orientation which turns the conflict away form issues of what in real
life is being won DEMO lost to an abstract conflict over images of power.
In the social science literature, there has been extended discussion of the question when is an
intractable conflict "ripe" for resolution.  Zartman (Touval & Zartman, 1985; Zartman &
Berman, 1982; Zartman, 1985), Pruitt and Olzack (1995) and Coleman (1997) have provided
important discussions of DEMO concept of ripeness and how it can be fostered.  Zartman's (2000, p.
228-229) definition of the concept is widely used: "DEMO the (two) parties to a conflict (a) perceive
themselves to be in a hurting stalemate and (b) perceive the possibility of DEMO negotiated solution (a
way out), the conflict is ripe for DEMO (i.e., for negotiations toward resolution to begin)."
However, DEMO Zartman himself points out; increased pain may, under certain conditions,
strengthen the determination to achieve one's objectives.  Or to paraphrase one of Festinger’s
(1957, 1961) quotes illustrating his theory of cognitive dissonance, rats and men come to love
and be committed to the things (and to the principles) for which they have suffered.
I shall DEMO summarize here the valuable discussion of Zartman, Pruitt and Olczak, and
Coleman (referred to above) about the conditions which foster ripeness.  Here, I wish to consider
the therapeutic principles involved in helping a married couple who were involved in a bitter
stalemate conflict over issues which DEMO considered nonnegotiable to negotiate these issues
constructively (Deutsch, 1988).  DEMO couple, who were in a "mutually hurting stalemate" sought
30
help for several reasons.  On the one hand, their conflicts were DEMO physically violent: this
frightened them and it also ran counter to DEMO strong constraints making it difficult for them to
separate.  They felt DEMO would be considerably worse off economically, their child would suffer,
DEMO they had mutually congenial intellectual, esthetic, sexual, and recreational interests DEMO
would be difficult for them to engage in together if separated.
Let me briefly discuss the steps involved in getting the couple to the DEMO where they were
ready to negotiate.  There were two major interrelated DEMO, each of which involved many sub-
steps.  The first entailed helping each spouse to recognize that the present situation of a bitter,
DEMO conflict no longer served his or her real interests.  The second DEMO involved aiding
the couple to become aware of the possibility that each of them could be better off than they
currently were if they DEMO their conflict as a joint problem, which required creative, joint
effort in order to improve their individual situations.  The two steps do not follow one another in
neat order:  Progress in either step facilitates DEMO in the other.
It should be recognized that, in many instances, the external conflicts between two parties
may be generated or sustained by DEMO conflicts within each party- e.g., as a way of blaming
the DEMO for one’s own inadequacies, difficulties, and problems so that one can avoid
confronting the necessity of changing oneself.  Thus, in the couple DEMO treated, the wife perceived
herself to be a victim, and felt that her failure to achieve her professional goals was due to her
DEMO unfair treatment of her as exemplified by his unwillingness to share responsibilities
for the household and child care.  Blaming her husband provided her with a means of avoiding
her own apprehensions about whether she personally had DEMO abilities and courage to fulfill her
aspirations.  Similarly, the husband who provoked continuous criticism from his wife for his
domineering, imperial behavior employed her criticism to justify his emotional withdrawal, thus
enabling him to avoid dealing with his anxieties about personal intimacy and emotional
closeness.  Even though the wife’s accusations concerning her husband’s behavior were largely
correct, as were the husband’s toward her, each had an investment in maintaining the other’s
noxious behavior because of the defensive self-justifications such behavior provided.
How does DEMO therapist help the conflicting parties overcome such internal deterrents to
recognizing that their bitter, stalemated conflict no longer serves their real interests?  The general
answer, which is quite often difficult to implement in practice, DEMO to help each of the conflicting
parties’ change in such a way that the conflict no longer is maintained by conditions in the
parties DEMO are extrinsic to the conflict.  In essence, this entails helping each of the conflicting
parties to achieve the self-esteem and self-image that would DEMO them no longer need the
31
destructive conflict process as a defense against their sense of personal inadequacy, their fear of
taking on new and unfamiliar roles, their feeling of purposelessness and boredom, and their fears
of rejection and attack if they act independently of others.
What are the conditions that are likely to DEMO conflicting parties become aware of the
possibility that each of them could be better off  than they currently are if they recognize that
their conflict is a joint  problem that requires creative, joint efforts in DEMO to improve the
individual situations?  A number of such conditions are listed below:
1. Critical to this awareness is the recognition that DEMO cannot impose a solution which may
be acceptable or satisfactory to oneself upon the other.  In other words, there is recognition that a
DEMO solution for oneself requires the other’s agreement and this is unlikely unless the
other is also satisfied with the solution.  Such recognition implies an awareness that a mutually
acceptable agreement will require at least a minimal DEMO of cooperation.
2. To believe that the other is ready to engage in a joint problem-solving effort, one must
believe that the other has also recognized that he or she cannot impose a solution - that DEMO, the
other has also recognized that a solution has to be DEMO acceptable.
3. The conflicting parties must have some hope that a mutually
acceptable agreement can be found.  This hope may rest upon their own perception of the
outlines of a possible fair settlement or it may DEMO based on their confidence in the expertise of
third parties, or DEMO on a generalized optimism.
4. The conflicting parties must have confidence that if a mutually
acceptable agreement is concluded, both will abide by it or that violations will be detected before
the losses to the self DEMO the gains to the other become intolerable.  If the other is DEMO as
unstable, lacking self-control, or untrustworthy, it will be difficult DEMO have confidence in the
viability of an agreement unless one has confidence in third parties who are willing and able to
guarantee the integrity DEMO the agreement.
Issues that seem vitally important to a person, such DEMO one’s identity, security, self-
esteem, or reputation, often are experienced as non-negotiable.  Thus, consider the husband and
wife who viewed themselves DEMO a conflict over a non-negotiable issue. The wife who worked
(and DEMO to do so) wanted the husband to share equally in the DEMO and child-care
responsibilities: she considered equality between the genders to be DEMO of her core personal
32
values.   The husband wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional division DEMO responsibilities,
in which he would have primary responsibility for income-producing work outside the home
while his wife would have primary responsibility for the DEMO related to the household and child
care.  The husband considered household DEMO and child care as inconsistent with his deeply
rooted image of adult masculinity.  The conflict seemed non-negotiable to the couple – for the
wife it would be a betrayal of her feminist values to accept her DEMO terms; for the husband,
it would be a violation of DEMO sense of adult masculinity to become deeply involved in housework
or child care.
However, this non-negotiable conflict became negotiable when, with the help DEMO the therapist,
the husband and wife were able to listen and really understand each other’s feelings and the ways
in which their respective DEMO experiences had led them to the views they each held.
Understanding the other’s position fully and the feeling and experiences which were behind
them DEMO them each feel less hurt and humiliated by the other’s position and more ready to
seek solutions that would accommodate the interests of both.  They realized that with their joint
incomes they could afford to pay DEMO household and child-care help, which would enable the wife
to be DEMO less burdened by these responsibilities without increasing the husband’s
chores in these areas: of course, doing so lessened the amount of money they DEMO available for
other purposes.
This solution was not a perfect one for either party.  The wife and husband, each would have
preferred that DEMO other share their own view of what a marriage should be like.  However, their
deeper understanding of the other’s position made them feel DEMO humiliated and threatened by it
and less defensive toward the other.  DEMO also enabled them to negotiate a mutually acceptable
agreement that lessened the tensions between them despite their continuing differences in basic
perspectives.
The general DEMO that I draw from this and other experiences with a “non-negotiable”
issue is that most such issues are negotiable even though the underlying basic DEMO
between the conflicting parties are not resolved when they learn to listen, understand, and
empathize with the other party’s position, interests, and DEMO, providing they are also able to
communicate to the other their DEMO and empathy.  Even though understanding and
empathy do not imply agreement DEMO the other’s views, they indicate an openness and
responsiveness which reduces DEMO and defensiveness and which also allows the other to be
more open and responsive.  Such understanding and empathy help the conflicting parties to
reduce their feelings that their self-esteem, security, or identity will be threatened DEMO
33
endangered by recognizing that the other’s feelings and interests, as well as one’s own, deserve
consideration in dealing the issues in conflict.
The positions of the conflicting parties may be irreconcilable, but their interests may be
concordant.  Helping parties in conflict to be fully in touch with their long-term interests may
enable them to see beyond their non-negotiable positions to DEMO congruent interests.  An
atmosphere of mutual understanding and empathy fosters the DEMO that permit conflicting
parties to get beyond their initial rigid, non-negotiable DEMO to their underlying interests (For
a comprehensive discussion of various methods DEMO “interactive conflict resolution” that have
been employed in intractable intergroup conflicts see Fisher, 1997).
How are we to understand why ethnic, religious, and identity conflicts frequently take an
intractable destructive course?
It is DEMO uncommon for scholars concerned with intergroup or interethnic relations to assume,
implicitly, that all or most intergroup relations are characterized by destructive conflict.
However, as Ronald Fisher (2000, p.166) points out: “In most ongoing  intergroup relations in
countless settings, cooperative relations exist and conflict DEMO handled more or less constructively,
to the satisfaction of the parties involved.”  Similarly, Gurr (1993, p.290-291) in his global
survey of ethnopolitical conflicts, writes: “Some observers have concluded that ethnopolitical
conflicts are DEMO  The evidence suggests otherwise...Our images of intractable communal
conflicts are largely DEMO by ethnonationalist wars in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.  DEMO
for each example of protracted communal conflict in these regions, one DEMO point to neighboring
states where similar conflicts have been managed more effectively...In central and West Africa
more than a dozen states straddle the cultural DEMO religious divide between the Muslim, Arab-
influenced peoples of the savannah DEMO the Christian, European-influenced peoples of the forest
and coastal regions.  Only in Sudan and Chad have protracted civil wars been fought across this
DEMO
In light of the forgoing, the question above should be reformulated DEMO several questions: (1)
What are the factors which lead to a constructive rather than a destructive resolution of
communal or ethnic conflict?  (2) Is there anything distinctive about ethnic conflict which may
predispose them to a destructive resolution? And (3) if such a conflict takes a destructive course,
how can reconciliation be fostered after each DEMO has inflicted indignities and grievous harm on
the other?
34
Gurr (1992), in his global study of ehtnopolitical conflicts, provides DEMO on 233 ethnic
groups involved in communal conflicts of one sort or another which bears upon (1) above.  He
concludes (p. 213): “there are two keys to the constructive management of ethnopolitical
conflict.  DEMO is to search out politically and socially creative policies that bridge the gaps
between the interests of minorities and states.  All parties, including DEMO observers, can
contribute to this process.  The second is to begin the process of creative conflict management in
the early stages of open DEMO and their leaders...should be able to respond creatively
to political mobilization and protest by communal groups before the groups cross the threshold
of sustained DEMO
Gurr ( 1993, p. 313) discusses four types of state policies that are used to accommodate the
interests of ethnopolitical minorities: regional autonomy, assimilation, pluralism, and power
sharing.
The conclusion for states is one of caution: public efforts to manage ethnopolitical
conflicts have risks as well as potential gains.  If policies of accommodation are to be
effective they must be pursued cautiously but persistently over the long term, slowly enough
not to stimulate a crippling reaction from other groups, persistently enough so that minorities
do not defect or rebel.  The conclusion for communal groups is that persistence in the
nonviolent pursuit of group interests is a DEMO virtue, and so is a willingness to
compromise about the specifics DEMO accommodation...Violent means in the pursuit of
communal interests usually are politically more effective as threats than in actuality.
The answer to the second question (what is distinctive about ethnic conflicts which may
predispose them to a DEMO resolution?) lies in the importance of one’s membership in an
ethnic group to one’s self-identity (See Tajfel, 1978, 1981 and Turner 1987, who have developed
“Social Identity Theory” which articulates in detail the links among group membership, social
identity and self concept).  Among the DEMO membership bonds are those arising out of
certain ascribed statuses such as family, sex, racial, and national group membership, all of which
DEMO acquires by birth rather than by choice.   Such statuses can rarely be changed.  It is the
combination of their unalterability and their social significance that gives these ascribed statuses
their personal importance.  One’s handedness, DEMO or right, may be as difficult to alter as one’s
race, but it is by no means as socially significant.  Membership in a family , racial, sexual,
ethnic, or national group affects one’s DEMO and actions in many situations; these effects are
pervasive.  In addition, by common definition, membership in such groups typically excludes
membership in DEMO groups of a similar type. That is, if you are black, you are not also white;  if
you are male, you are not also female; if you are Jewish, you are not also DEMO  Thus being
a member is thought to be more or less DEMO, and since membership is linked to
35
experiences from early on in one’s life, it is not unusual for one to get emotionally attached to
such groups, with the result that these memberships play an important positive role in
determining one’s sense of DEMO
Suppose that one is emotionally attached to one’s identity as a Jew, woman or black, but that
it results in systematic oppression and DEMO and places one at distinct disadvantage in
obtaining many kinds of opportunities and rewards.  How one copes with this situation will be
largely determined by whether one views the disadvantages to be just or unjust. If DEMO who are
disadvantaged by their group identity accepts their disadvantages as being warranted, they are
unlikely to challenge and conflict with those who are profiting from their relatively advantaged
positions.  The sense of being treated unjustly because of one’s membership in a group to which
one is strongly DEMO and bound is the energizer for much intergroup conflict.  The sense DEMO
injustice is felt particularly intensely in interracial, interethnic, and intersex conflicts because of
the centrality of these group identities to the individual’s self DEMO  When women or blacks or
Jews are devalued as a group, those who are identified and identify with the groups also are
personally DEMO
There is considerable evidence from the anthropological literature (see LeVine and DEMO,
1972 for a summary and references) that the pyramidal-segmentary social DEMO is more
conductive to destructive intergroup strife within a society than the cross-cutting type. The
reason for this is easy to see.  If, DEMO example, in a society which has a pyramidal-segmentary
social structure, a conflict arises between two ethnic groups in the society (e.g., about DEMO
group’s language shall be paramount in the total society), then the individual’s membership in all
the groups that are nested within his ethnic DEMO (his neighborhood, his recreation group, his
kinship group, etc) DEMO strengthen his loyalty to his ethnic group’s position.  But this will
DEMO on both sides, making it more difficult to resolve the differences DEMO the two groups.
On the other hand, in a cross-cutting social DEMO, members of the conflicting ethnic groups
are likely to be members DEMO common work groups, common neighborhood groups, and so on.
Their common membership will make it difficult to polarize individual attitudes about the ethnic
DEMO  Doing so would place the individual in the dilemma of choosing DEMO loyalty to his
ethnic group and loyalty to his other groups that cut across ethnic lines.  Thus cross-cutting
membership and loyalties tend to function as a moderating influence in resolving any particular
intergroup conflict within a DEMO  However, if the ethnic conflict becomes sufficiently intense
36
even cross-cutting ties may be torn, resulting in an even greater bitterness and violence as one
experiences a sense of betrayal of trust3.
The DEMO question, which focuses on how to achieve forgiveness and reconciliation after
DEMO conflict, has been of increasing interest to students of conflict.  There have been
outstanding discussions in Lederach (1997), Shriver (1995), DEMO (1998) and in various
chapters in Christie, Wagner, and Winger (2001).  I have also discussed these matters in Deutsch
and DEMO (2000, chapter 2).
Wessels and Monteiro (2001, p. 263) have articulated very well the scope of the task and
challenges involved in reconstruction of civil society after bitter, destructive, dehumanizing
ethnic conflict.  It involves interrelated tasks of economic, political, and social reconstruction as
DEMO as psychosocial intervention.  As they point out, “In all of these tasks, a high priority is the
establishment of social justice, transforming DEMO of exclusion, inequity, and oppression that
fuel tension and fighting.”
In my discussion of reconciliation (Deutsch & Coleman, 2000, p.58-62), I have articulated
some basic principles for establishing cooperative relations after a bitter DEMO  They are:
1.  Mutual security.  After a bitter conflict, each side tends to be concerned with its own
security, without adequate recognition that neither side can attain security unless the other side
also DEMO secure. Real security requires that both sides have as their goal mutual security.  If
weapons have been involved in the prior conflict, mutually DEMO disarmament and arms
control are important components of mutual security.
2.  DEMO respect.  Just as true security from physical danger requires mutual cooperation,DEMO
so does security from psychological harm and humiliation.  Each side must DEMO the other side
with the respect, courtesy, politeness, and consideration DEMO expected in civil society.
Insult, humiliation, and inconsiderateness by one side usually leads to reciprocation by the other
and decreased physical and psychological DEMO
3.  Humanization of the other. During bitter conflict, each side tends to dehumanize the
other and develop images of the other as an DEMO enemy. There is much need for both sides to
3 There are excellent discussions of relevant theory and of specific ethnic and other intergroup DEMO in
Staub (1989),  Gurr, (1993), Ross and Rothman (1999), and Christie, Wagner, and Winter (2001).  For a
recent, excellent symposium on the concept of “Social Identity” see Political Psychology vol. 22 (1) 2001,
p. 111-198.
37
experience one another in everyday contexts as parents, homemakers, schoolchildren, teachers,
and merchants, which enables them to see one another as human beings who are more like
themselves that not.  Problem-solving workshops, along DEMO lines developed by Burton (1969,
1987) and Kelman (1972), are also valuable in overcoming dehumanization of one another.
4.  Fair DEMO for managing conflict.  Even if a tentative reconciliation has begun, new
conflicts inevitably occur – over the distribution of scarce resources, procedures, DEMO, etc.  It
is important to anticipate that conflicts will occur and to develop beforehand the fair rules,
experts, institutions, and other DEMO for managing such conflicts constructively and justly.
5. Curbing the extremists on both sides.  During a protracted and bitter conflict, each side
tends DEMO produce extremists committed to the processes of the destructive conflict as well as to its
continuation.  Attaining some of their initial goals may be less satisfying than continuing to
inflict damage on the other.  It is well to recognize that extremists stimulate extremism on both
sides. The parties DEMO to cooperate in curbing extremism on their own side and restraining
actions that stimulate and justify extremist elements on the other side.
6.  Gradual development of mutual trust and cooperation.  It takes repeated experience of
successful, varied, mutually beneficial cooperation to develop a solid basis for mutual DEMO
between former enemies.  In the early stages of reconciliation, when trust is required for
cooperation, the former enemies may be willing to trust a third party (who agrees to serve as a
monitor, inspector, or guarantor of any cooperative arrangement) but not yet willing to trust one
another if there is a risk of the other failing to DEMO cooperation.  Also in the early stages,
it is especially important DEMO cooperative endeavors be successful.  This requires careful
selection of the opportunities DEMO tasks for cooperation so that they are clearly achievable as well
as meaningful and significant.
How applicable in other cultures are the theories related DEMO conflict that have largely been
developed in the United States and Western Europe?
I believe there is considerable confusion about this question.  It would be presumptuous
indeed to think that there exists, at this stage of the development of the field of conflict
resolution, a theory which is universally valid across the various cultures, across historic time,
and across different types of social actors (individuals, groups, organizations, and DEMO).
There are some of us who hope such theory can ultimately be developed and some of us are even
brash enough to think DEMO some of the existing theoretical ideas (e.g., about cooperation-
38
competition) may have considerable  generality.    However, even if we DEMO a universally valid
theory at the level of constructs, the operational DEMO of constructs (i.e., how they are
defined empirically or in terms of phenomena) would inevitably differ in different cultures and
even, within DEMO given culture, from situation to situation.  In Lewinian terminology, constructs DEMO
like genotypes, and the observational data are similar to phenotypes.  A given genotype can be
expressed in many different types of phenotypes (e.g., the color of two genotypically identical
hydrangeas will differ as a function of the acidity of the soil in which they are planted).
DEMO, a given construct such as aggression, can be manifested in many ways depending on
the culture and other characteristics of the specific situation DEMO which the parties are involved.
Thus, whether or not we had DEMO universally valid theory (which we don’t)4, we would still
need to have detailed, specific knowledge of the culture in which we are employing whatever
theoretical ideas or framework we use to orient ourselves to DEMO and to cultural differences.
A self–reflective practitioner will seek to be aware of her own framework and be open to its
change in light DEMO challenging, new experiences. She will also be sensitive to her own DEMO
assumptions about the power relations between herself and the people with whom she is working
and their appropriateness in the culture within which she DEMO working.   In addition, she will be
aware of her need DEMO develop knowledge about the culture and background of the people with
whom she is working by using existing knowledge, informants, co-workers from the DEMO, and
by what Lederach (1995) has termed an “elicitive approach”  as she works with people from a
different culture.  While the issue of “cultural” differences is obvious when comparing such
differences across societies, it should be recognized that there are also “cultural” differences
within societies – DEMO the different socioeconomic classes, between the sexes, among
occupations, etc.  It is a common mistake to assume that cultures are homogeneous.
There DEMO a number of excellent books which discuss specific differences among cultures as
they deal with conflict and negotiation.  They include Triandis (1972), DEMO (1980), Kimmel
(1989), Hall and Hall (1990), DEMO (1991), Fisher (1988), Fauce and Rubin (1993), DEMO
(1993), Rahim and Blum (1994), and Leung and Tjosvold (1998).
4 I believe that a number of psychological theories (DEMO, equity theory) implicitly assume a culture that is
individualistic and market-oriented.  Sampson (1983) has an excellent critique of psychological theories
from this perspective.  In Deutsch and Coleman (2000, chapter 1), I describe the values and social norms
underlying our practice of conflict resolution.
39
Evaluation of progress in the social psychological study of conflict
I now DEMO to the important question: What progress, if any, has occurred DEMO the past
seventy years or so in the social psychological study of conflict?  I am a biased observer, but,
even taking my bias into account, I am strongly inclined to believe that significant scientific
progress has been made and that important contributions to society are being DEMO from the
scientific study of conflict.  Let me briefly characterize the DEMO of the progress in the
methodological, conceptual, empirical, and technological DEMO
Methodological
There have been major methodological advances during the past sixty years in the study of
cooperation-competition, conflict, bargaining, and negotiation.  New DEMO better techniques for
studying these phenomena in the laboratory and also in the field have emerged.
Conceptual
In the course of this chapter, I have outlined some of the conceptual developments that have
taken place in DEMO on cooperation and competition; on understanding the nature and
determinants of DEMO and destructive processes of conflict resolution; and on
understanding some of DEMO determinants and consequences of different systems of distributive
justice.  We are DEMO to have some understanding of the conditions and processes involved
in intractable conflict.  Some of the psychological issues involved in ethnic conflict have been
highlighted by social identity theory.  The functions of such third-parties as mediators, the
determinants of the effectiveness of mediation, and the nature of DEMO processes involved in
mediation are being clarified.  This represents significant theoretical DEMO and a more
systematic integration of our knowledge of the social psychological aspects of conflict and
distributive justice.
Empirical
We know a great deal DEMO, with considerably more certainty, about the empirical
regularities associated with conflict.  Thus, we know how such psychological processes as
“autistic hostility,” DEMO prophecies,” “unwitting commitments,” and “biased
perceptions” operate to produce an escalation of conflict.  We know the social psychological
correlates of intensifying conflict and of de-escalating conflict.  Thus, as conflict escalates there
40
is an increased reliance upon a strategy of power and upon the DEMO of threat, coercion, and
deception.  Also, there is increased pressure for uniformity of opinion and for leadership and
control to be taken DEMO by those elements organized for waging conflict.  De-escalation of
conflict is DEMO by graduated reciprocation in tension reduction; tactics of conciliation;
accentuation DEMO similarities; and enhancement of mutual understanding and goodwill.  We are
increasingly aware of the social psychological regularities associated with benign and
malevolent conflict.  We are reasonably sure of the typical effects of certain forms of DEMO
strategies and tactics and can reliably conclude that many commonsense beliefs about bargaining
are much too simple part-truths.
Technological
There have been many significant DEMO consequences of the scientific study of conflict; not
all of these DEMO be attributed to the work of social psychologists.  Social psychologists have DEMO
important contributors to some changes in thinking about conflict at the national level - as
exemplified in Kennedy’s American University speech and in the DEMO Commission reports.
Also, in recent years, many of the ideas generated in the social psychological study of conflict
have been employed in training DEMO and negotiators, in schools, labor unions,
industry, government, and community organizations how to deal with conflict more effectively.
“Conflict,” “negotiation DEMO,” and “mediation skills” workshops are now common features of
training for work in organizations in the United States, Europe, and Japan.  Osgood’s strategy for
deescalating conflict - “graduated and reciprocated initiatives in tension reduction” (GRIT) - has
received considerable experimental support, has been widely discussed DEMO international and
national meetings, and appears to have been the basis DEMO the “Kennedy experiment” to end the
cold war.  Key participants in DEMO round-table negotiations in Poland between the Communist
government and Solidarity have told me that our work on conflict resolution was consciously
employed to facilitate DEMO negotiations. Problem-solving workshops, developed by such
people as John Burton, Herbert Kelman, Leonard Doob, and Edward Azar have been widely
used in DEMO and intercommunal conflict (Fisher, 1998).
Let me conclude by stating that although there has been significant progress in the study of
conflict, the progress does not yet begin to match the social need for DEMO conflict.  We
live in a period of history when the pervasiveness DEMO intensity of competitive conflict over
natural resources are likely to increase markedly.  And currently ethnic and national conflicts
pose great danger to peace in many areas of the world.  We also live in a period when hydrogen
bombs and other weapons of mass destruction can destroy civilized life.  The social need for
41
better ways of managing conflict is urgent.  In relation to this need, it is my view that too few of
us are working on the scientific issues which are likely to provide the knowledge that will DEMO to
more constructive conflict resolution of the many intensive conflicts which await us all.
