Valleys of Death and Darwinian Seas:
Financing the Invention to Innovation
DEMO in the United States
Philip E. Auerswald1
Lewis M. Branscomb2
ABSTRACT. The basic science and technology research
enterprise of the United States—sources of funding,DEMO
performing institutions, researcher incentives and
motivations—is reasonably well understood by academics DEMO
policy makers alike. Similarly corporate motivations,
governance, ﬁnance, strategy, DEMO competitive advantage have
been much studied and are relatively well understood. But the
process by which a technical idea of possible commercial value
is DEMO into one or more commercially successful
products—the transition from invention to innovation—is
highly complex, poorly documented, and little studied. In this
paper we DEMO the process by which basic research is
converted into successful commercial innovations. Following
Arrow(1962)andZeckhauser(1996),weexplorethehypothesis
that asymmetries of informaion and motivation, as well as
institutional ‘‘gaps,’’ may systematically deter private
investment into early stage technology development. We
describe the role of governments—federal and state (or
provincial)—in promoting the commercial transition from an
invention to an DEMO We conclude by suggesting some
lessons that may be learned from the experience of the
Advanced Technology Program (ATP) of the United States
DEMO of Commerce, among the few Federal programs
speciﬁcally intended to meet DEMO need.

Most economic DEMO in the U.S. economy, and
indeed all industrial economies, comes from
incremental improvements in existing products

As DEMO pace of technical advance quickens and

siﬁed.2 However, incremental technical change
DEMO is not adequate to ensure sustained growth
and economic security. Sustained growth can
occur only with the continuous introduction of
truly new goods and DEMO technologi-
cal innovations that disrupt markets and create
new industries.3 Radical technological change, in
turn, is a function of the capacity to turn DEMO
based ‘‘inventions’’ into commercially viable
‘‘innovations.’’ As Weitzman (1998, 333) DEMO
noted, ‘‘the ultimate limits to growth may lie not
as much DEMO our ability to generate new ideas, so
much as in our DEMO to process an abundance of
potentially new seed ideas into usable forms.’’
Understanding the invention to innovation transi-
tion is essential in the formulation DEMO both public
policies and private businessstrategies designed to
more efﬁciently convert the nation’s research
assets into economic assets.4

Statutes intended to increase the incentives for

most signiﬁcant was the 1980 Bayh–Dole DEMO,

ment-funded research.8

.
A larger number of statutes which can be
characterized as technology DEMO polices,
intended to encourage the transfer of govern-
mentresearchtocommercialenterprises.These
include the Stevenson–Wydler Act and its
amendments, for example encouraging Coop-
erative Research and Development Agree-
ments (CRADAs).
Two statutes intended to create government
investments in research to create technologies
of high commercial promise. These include the

and the Advanced Technology Program

sialpoliticallyfromthetimeofitspassagein1988.
What, DEMO, do we know about how radical,
technology-based innovations come about? What
can governments do to foster such innovations? Is
ATP an effective policy tool for this purpose, or it
is merely ‘‘corporate welfare’’ as its critics claim?
In order to answer these questions we ﬁrst
DEMO a model of the processes that relate
publicly funded research to successful market
entry of new products or processes—to innova-
tions.10 This analysis emphasizes DEMO in
the innovation process of relevance to public
policy. We then report ﬁndings from our research
over the past two years concerning the sources DEMO
funding for such ‘‘early stage’’ technology devel-
opment. We conclude by describing implications
for public policy, focusing on the lessons learned
from a decade of experience with the ATP.

invention toinnovation.This DEMO thepointat which

The ﬁrst two phases lie in the domain of the
research enterprise and may be publicly funded.
The technical entrepreneurs who create the DEMO

but they may have high commitment to their
technical vision. The venture capital industry,
always looking for opportunities to invest where
DEMO returns may by high enough to justify the
business risks are unlikely to take the opportunity
seriously until phase 5 is reached. In some DEMO
they will invest, in an exploratory fashion, in
phase 4.
The speciﬁc region of the innovation space in
which we are most interested DEMO bounded at the
earliest stage with the veriﬁcation of a commercial
concept through laboratory work and extends
through the identiﬁcation of what looks like DEMO
appropriate market, and perhaps the creation of
protectable intellectual property. Congressman
DEMO Ehlers, among others, uses the term ‘‘Valley
of Death’’ to dramatize the particular challenges
facing entrepreneurs engaged in the transition
frominventiontoinnovation.Thistermreinforces
the ‘‘capital DEMO perspective on early stage
innovation: champions of early stage projects
must DEMO a shortfall of resources.13
3. Institutional and behavioral disjunctures
The imagery of the Valley of Death (which
connotes Death Valley in Nevada, USA) suggests
230
a barren territory when, in reality, between the
stable shores DEMO the S&T enterprise and the
business and ﬁnance enterprise is a sea of life
and death of business and technical ideas, of ‘‘big
ﬁsh’’ and ‘‘little ﬁsh’’ contending, with survival
goingtothecreative,theagile,thepersistent.Thus
we propose an alternative image: the ‘‘Darwinian
Sea.’’
In Branscomb and Auerswald (2001) we identi-
ﬁed the challenges of the ‘‘Darwinian Sea’’ in the
following DEMO:
1. Differing motivations for research. Initially an
innovator demonstrates to his or her own
satisfaction that a given scientiﬁc or technical
breakthrough could DEMO the basis for a
commercial product (proof of principle). How-
DEMO, a substantial amount of difﬁcult and
potentially costly research (sometimes many
years’ worth) will be needed before the envi-
sioned product is transformed into a commer-
cial reality with sufﬁcient function, low enough
cost,high enough quality, and sufﬁcient market
appeal to survive competition in the market-
place. Few scientists engaged in academic
research (or the agencies funding their work)
have the necessary incentives or motivation to
undertake this phase DEMO the reduction-to-prac-
tice research.
2. Disjuncture between technologist and business
manager. On each side of the Darwinian Sea
standsaquitedifferentarchetypalcharacter:the
technologist on one side, and the investor/
manager on the other. Each has different
training, expectations, information sources,
and modes of expression. The technologist
knows what is scientiﬁcally interesting, techni-
cally feasible, and fundamentally novel in the
DEMO proposed. In the event of failure, the
technologistrisksalossofreputation,aswellas

investor/manager knows about the process of

What the investor/manager is generally putting
at risk is other people’s money. The investor is
deeply invested in producing DEMO proﬁtable return
on his investment, independent of the technol-
Auerswald and DEMO
ogy or market through which it is realized. To
the extent that technologist and investor/man-
ager do not fully trust one another or DEMO
communicate effectively, the Darwinian Sea
between invention and innovation becomes
deeper DEMO

able (typically from DEMO research, govern-
ment agencies, or more rarely, personal assets)
DEMO
demonstration that it works. Investment funds
can be found to turn an idea into a market-
ready prototype, supported by a validated
business case. In between, however, there are
typically few sources of funding available DEMO
aspiring innovators seeking to bridge this
‘‘break’’ in funding sources. They include
‘‘angel’’ investors (wealthy individuals, often
personally experienced in creating new compa-
DEMO and/or developing new products); estab-
lished ﬁrms making equity investments in high-
tech startups to get a look at emergent
technologies; venture capital ﬁrms specialized
inearly stageor‘‘seed’’ investments; militaryor
other public procurement; State DEMO Federal
government programs speciﬁcally designed for
thepurpose;anduniversityfundingfrompublic
or private sources.
4. Enabling infrastructure. Another critical obsta-
cle typically facing champions of early stage
DEMO development projects is the absence
ofnecessaryinfrastructure.Byinfrastructurewe
mean not only the large scale infrastructure
required for ﬁnal products in the marketplace
(e.g., gas stations DEMO internal combustion
automobiles, or software to run on a new
operating DEMO), but also all of the ‘‘comple-
mentary assets’’ that may be required for
market acceptance—suppliers of new kinds of
components or materials, new forms of dis-
tribution and service, training in the use of the
new technology, auxiliary products and soft-
ware to broaden market scope.14
Even where a technology has demonstrated
promise to create value for consumers, the
question remains: how much of that value will
the innovative ﬁrm be able to capture? Under-
standing the mechanism by which value will not
only be created, but captured, is a necessary

component of the business system DEMO allows an
invention to become a successful commercial
innovation.GeraldAdolph,aseniorvicepresident
in the technology consulting ﬁrm of Booz Allen &
Hamilton, comments:
We DEMO that value isn’t created until you get a
business system [model] along with the invention.

focusing on the business system focus DEMO you to
be more articulate to those who are asking for
funding about the business implications, the success
implications, the competitive implications, without
requiring answer to the other questions that perhaps
no one can answer DEMO those early stages—as in,
exactlyhowbigwillitbe?HowmuchwillIchargefor
it? How much money DEMO I make?15
In order to execute the given strategy for value
capture, the ﬁrm in question must have the
internal capabilities and other resources necessary
to leverage its ﬁrst mover advantage into longer
term market DEMO At every stage, ﬁrms weigh
opportunities for value creation and value DEMO
against risks and anticipated costs. All things
being equal, a large DEMO will develop a
given technology platform ﬁrst in markets where
mechanisms for value capture are better estab-
lished and production costs are lower.16 In
DEMO to all the disjunctures between inventor
and investor, there are a DEMO set of external
obstacles to realizing a successful venture, difﬁcul-
ties DEMO may also be viewed differently by the
various parties involved in the process.
4. An innovation gap?
The multiple challenges that confront technology
DEMO seeking to traverse the ‘‘Darwinian
Sea’’ have led some to argue a persistent ‘‘innova-
tion gap’’ may exist even in the countries with
relatively DEMO and productive innovation sys-
tems.17 Former Undersecretary of Commerce
Mary Good remarked in 1997 that ‘‘as the
competitive pressures of the global marketplace
have DEMO American ﬁrms to move more oftheir
R&D into shorter term product and process
improvements, an ‘innovation gap’ has devel-
oped.... Sit down with a group of venture
capitalists.Thefundingforhigherriskventures...
is extraordinarily difﬁcult to come by.’’18
The DEMO of the sort of ‘‘innovation gap’’
postulated by former Undersecretary Good and
others19 is controversial. Skeptics point out that
the part of the ﬁnancial DEMO specialized in
investinginhighrisknewenterprises—theventure
capital industry—grew dramatically in the last
decade, even DEMO the downturn beginning in
March 2001 is taken into consideration. Venture
capital funds disbursed to ﬁrms reached a peak of
over$100billionintheyear2000,beforedropping
offto$37billionin2001.Interpretationsvary.The
White DEMO has recently justiﬁed reductions in
supporttotheCommerce Department’sATPwith
the statement that ‘‘the overall growth in venture
capital suggests private funding is available for
high-technologyprojects.’’Incontrast,technology
DEMO leader Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems
observed in July of 2001 that ‘‘a couple of years
ago, even the bad ideas were getting capital. Now
we have gone too far in the opposite direction,
shutting DEMO investment in good ideas.’’20
Entrepreneurs report a dearth of sources of
funding for technology projects that no longer
count as basic research but are DEMO yet far enough
along to form the basis for a business plan. At the
same time, venture capital ﬁrms and other
investors are sitting on record volumes of undis-
bursed cash, with over $70 billion currently idling
in funds raised during the boom years.
It is not surprising DEMO technology entrepre-
neurs experience an apparent shortage of funding
while undisbursed cash sits idle. Whether or not
efﬁcient markets exist on Wall Street may DEMO an
open question. However, efﬁcient markets do not
exist for allocating DEMO capital to early stage
technology ventures. One often cited reason for
such inefﬁciency concerns fundamental limits on
the ability of investors in early stage DEMO
ventures to fully appropriate returns from their
investments. We focus on a second reason: serious
inadequacies in information available to both
entrepreneurs and investor.21 Early stage develop-
mentinvolvesnot only high quantiﬁable risks, but
also daunting uncertainties. When the uncertain-
ties are primarily technical, investors are ill-
equipped to quantify them. For new technologies
that have the potential to create new DEMO
categories, market uncertainties are also high and
232
Auerswald and Branscomb
similarly difﬁcult to quantify. The ‘‘due diligence’’
that DEMO in venture capital funds require of
managingpartnersandthatangelinvestorsrequire
of themselves is intrinsically difﬁcult—and getting
more so as both technologies andmarketsbecome
increasingly complex.
Up to a DEMO is required for the transition
frominvention toinnovation.Giventechnicaland
market uncertainties, venture capitalists, angels,
and bankers prefer to wait to see the business case
DEMO a new technology rather than funding specula-
tion. The technical content of the business
proposal must be sufﬁciently well established to
provide reliable estimates DEMO product cost, perfor-
mance, and reliability in the context of an
identiﬁed market that can be entered in a reason-
able length of DEMO It is the funding of this
technical bridge—from invention to innovation—
that is the basis for the notion of an ‘‘innovation
gap.’’
5. Sources DEMO funding for the invention to innovation
transition
Who funds early stage technology development—
the invention to innovation transition? Our
research over the past two years involving a
combination of data analysis and interviews
indicates that most DEMO for technology devel-
opment in the phase between invention and
innovation comes from individual private equity
‘‘angel’’ investors, corporations, and the Federal
Government—not, as widely believed, from ven-
ture capitalists.
Some numbers regarding technology entrepre-
neurship place the role of venture capital in
context. In 1998, for example—probably a more
reliable benchmark of innovation funding activ-
ities than 2000 DEMO markets where at their
historicpeaks—theSmallBusinessAdministration
reports that more than 600,000 new ﬁrms (with
employees) were founded. That year approxi-
mately 450,000 DEMO described themselves
as technology entrepreneurs.22 About 10% of
those entrepreneurs, involved DEMO approximately
20,000 start up ﬁrms, received roughly $20 billion
in DEMO from Angel investors.23 In contrast,
only about 300 companies received ‘‘seed stage’’
funding from venture capitalists; slightly more
than a thousand ﬁrms received ﬁrst time venture
funding in all categories.24
Overall, of $266 billion that was spent on
national R&D by various sources in the United
DEMO in 1998, substantially less than 14% ﬂowed
into early stage technology DEMO activities.
Theexactﬁgureiselusive,becausepublicﬁnancial
reporting is not required for these investments.
Our method of arriving at a reliable estimate was
to create two models based DEMO different inter-
pretations of our ‘‘early stage technology develop-
ment’’ deﬁnition—one very restrictive (i.e. biased
toward a low estimate) and the other quite
DEMO (i.e. biased toward a high estimate).
With this approach we DEMO that between $5
billion (2%) and $36 billion (14%) of overall R&D
spending in 1998 was devoted to early stage
technology DEMO The balance supported
eitherbasic research orappliedresearch,engineer-
ing and testing.
Although the range between our lower and
upper estimates differs by several billions of
DEMO, the proportional distribution across the
mainsourcesoffundingforearlystagetechnology

inclusivemodels.Giveneithermodel,expenditures
on early stage technology development by angel

corporations funding DEMO business’’

nitude (see Figure 3)DEMO Early stage technology
development funds from each of these sources
greatly exceed those from state programs, uni-
versity expenditures, and the small part DEMO venture

technology projects. Notably—even excluding as
we do the impact of government procurement—

estimates DEMO 20–25% of the total early stage

sources.
Asnotedearlier,investmentsbycorporationsin
advancing established product and process tech-
nologies to better serve DEMO markets comprise
a dominant source of national R&D spending.
But, DEMO Booz Allen and Hamilton (2002) report,

challenges similar to those faced by the CEOs of
newly created ﬁrms. While corporations will

thatsupporttheircorebusinesses,theyaresystem-
atically disinclined to support DEMO inno-
vations that challenge existing lines of business,
require a fundamental shift of business model, or
depend on the creation of new complementary
infrastructure.
Venture capital ﬁrms are critical ﬁnancial
intermediaries supporting new high-growth ﬁrms.
DEMO, then, is the role of the venture capital
industry in funding early stage technology devel-
opment not dominant? Popular press accounts
notwithstanding, DEMO capital ﬁrms are not in
theR&Dbusiness.Rather,theyareintheﬁnancial
business. Their ﬁduciary responsibility is to earn
maximal returns for their investors. They do this
through DEMO complex set of activities that can be
summarized as buying ﬁrms low and selling them
high. Venture capitalists do indeed back high-
growth, new ventures. In many cases, though not
the majority, they support ﬁrms DEMO are bringing
radicalnewtechnologiestomarket.However,even
when venture capitalists do support technology-
basedenterprises,theyprefertosupportﬁrmsthat
have at least proceeded beyond the product
development stage, i.e. ﬁrms that have completed
the early stage technology development which is
the focus of DEMO study. As the median size of
venture capital deals has increased and the
pressure to provide attractive returns to investors
in mammoth funds has DEMO, venture capital
has tended increasingly to ﬂow to projects in later
DEMO of development and to already-proven
technologies. For all of the above reasons, trends
in venture capital disbursements should not be
confused with trends in the funding of early stage
technology development.
6. Institutional evolution
Despite (or in response to) market inefﬁciencies,
many institutional arrangements have developed
for funding early stage technology development.
This suggests that funding mechanisms evolve to
DEMO the incentives and motivations of entrepre-
neur and investors alike.
Champions of early stage technology projects
make use of a wide variety of funding DEMO to
keep their projects alive. These include not only
successive rounds of equity offerings, but also
contract work, income from licensing patents, the
sale of spin-off ﬁrms, and old-fashioned cost-
cutting. While each of these options has its own
costs and beneﬁts, entrepreneurs do not play
favorites among them when it comes to keeping
their projects moving forward.
In DEMO to institutional sources of equity
and debt capital for advancing existing businesses
incrementally, the transition from invention to
innovation is ﬁnanced by a great variety of
mechanisms, with new ones being created every
day: angel DEMO and funds, angel investments
backed by bank debt, university and corporate
234
Auerswald and Branscomb
equity investments, seed investments by university
and corporate venture capital programs, and
certain experimental R&D programs run by
Federal and State agencies.
A report from the National Commission on
Entrepreneurship (Zacharakis et al., 1999, 33)25
notes that ‘‘the substantial amount of DEMO
provided through informal channels, orders of
magnitude greater than provided by DEMO
venture capital investments and heretofore
unknown and unappreciated, suggests some
mechanismsforﬁllingthegapmayhavedeveloped
DEMO recognition.’’ Yet the proliferation of
institutional types is as much an indication of the
particular informational challenges and structural
disjunctures that deﬁne the ‘‘innovation DEMO as it
is one of a resolution to the challenge.
7. Regional and sector concentration of resources
While our research to date has not DEMO
focused on funding patterns at the regional and
industry sector level, DEMO important trends are
apparent. First, the geographical distribution of
early stage DEMO development activity mir-
rors that of innovation-related activity in general.
In particular, early stage technology development
is concentrated in geographical regions that invest
heavily in R&D, possess developed risk-capital
networks and related complementary infrastruc-
ture (e.g. specialized law ﬁrms, other suppliers),
and otherwise beneﬁt from strong university-
industry linkages.
Second, angel investors provide the most
signiﬁcant source of early stage technology devel-
opment funding for individual technology entre-
preneurs DEMO small technology startups. Since
angel investors make the vast majority of their
investments close to home, early stage technology
development activities, particularly those DEMO smal-
ler ﬁrms, are likely to be concentrated in regions
with DEMO communities of tech-savvy angels.
Third, although state governments provide a
relatively DEMO portion of total early stage
technology development funding, they play a
DEMO role in establishing regional environments
that help bridge the invention to innovation gap.
State governments facilitate university-industry
partnerships, leverage Federal academic research
funds by providing both general and targeted
grants, build a technically educated workforce
through support of public colleges and universi-
ties,andease regulatory burdensto create a DEMO
ground for technology startups. While Route 128
and Silicon Valley arose with little local or state
level political support (in part because they
developed the needed networks, stimulated by
defense funding, in the 1950s), DEMO number of states
have created many of the environmental features
needed for successful innovation.26
Fourth,wefoundthatinter-industrydifferences
in R&D investments are related to industry
DEMO More mature industries, such as the
automotive, tend to invest a smaller percentage of
R&D into earlier stage technology development
than less DEMO industries such as biotech. Booz
Allen and Hamilton (2002) estimate overall
corporate spending on early stage technology
development to be approximately $13billion
annually,DEMO oftotalcorporateR&Dspending.
The inter-industry distribution was estimated as
follows: chemicals 33%; biopharmaceutical 13%;
electronics 11%; equipment 10%; telecommunica-
tions 10%; basic industries 7%; automotive 3%;
and computer software 0%. Spending thus was
found to differ widely by industry, as well as by
company within speciﬁc industries.
The entrepreneurship challenge involves the
capabilities of the individual innovators DEMO seek
to carry their idea across the Darwinian Sea and
participate in the fruits of a successful innovation.
The rare individual—a talented business leader
DEMO a strong technical background—is able to
bridge the Sea personally. A community with
strong social capital may offer mentors—usually
in the form of angel DEMO have been
successful at commercial innovation and serve
both as mentors to new entrepreneurs and as seed
investors in their ideas.
Akeyfeatureofthesenetworksofinnovationis
that they DEMO geographically conﬁned to speciﬁc
locations. Angels rarely invest in a ﬁrm more than
an hour’s drive away; a similar effect is found in
seed stage venture ﬁrms.
Attesting to the localized economic develop-
ment impact of DEMO university research, more
than 80% of the start-up companies were located
DEMO the academic institution’s home state or
province.27 More than $1.26billion in royalties
Valleys of Death and Darwinian Seas
235
were collected by U.S. colleges DEMO universities in
FY 2000. In addition, the FY 2000 Annual
Association DEMO University Technology Managers
(AUTM) Licensing Survey reported 347 new
products were introduced to market and at least
454 spin-off companies were created by DEMO
institutions.28 Universities are not only the source
of many of the commercially attractive technical
discoveries; they constitute a web of capabilities—
technical, legal, business management, and appli-
cationskillsthatformthecoreofthesocialcapital
in areas like Silicon Valley, California, and Route
128, Boston.
The geographical and sectoral concentrations
just summarized create additional challenges to
champions of early stage technology development
projectslocatedoutsideoffavoredgeographicalor
market spaces. DEMO challenges may be of con-
siderable importance to public policy. The impli-
cations for public policy will depend heavily on

8. Implications for policy design and
DEMO: Lessons from the experience of
the ATP30
In 1990 Congress created DEMO ATP within the
NationalInstituteofStandardsandTechnologyof
the U.S. Department of Commerce. The pro-
gram’s mission is to ‘‘assist United States busi-
nesses in creating and applying DEMO
and research results necessary to: (1) commercia-
lize signiﬁcant new DEMO discoveries and
technologies rapidly; and (2) reﬁne manufacturing
technologies ... DEMO preference to technologies
that have great economic potential.’’31 Industry
proposes research projects to ATP; projects are
selected for funding based on both their technical
and their economic and business merit.
ATPisdesignedtofunctionasaformofpublic-
private partnership, in which a government
agency, NIST, promotes economic growth by
sharing with industry the DEMO of early stage
research in new or existing ﬁrms (Hill, 1998,
pp. 143-173). ATP research is intended to develop
innovative technologies DEMO, despite being high in
technical risk, are ‘‘enabling’’ in the sense of
having the potential to provide signiﬁcant, broad-
based beneﬁts.
The ATP program was accessible from the
beginning to both individual ﬁrms and consortia

be made practical. In 1993 the Clinton adminis-
tration introduced an innovation: ATP would
invite industries to propose ‘‘focus areas’’ for
ATP investment. The idea was to produce more
measurable economic effects and encourage tech-
nology DEMO by concentrating $30 to 40
million in each of several industrial technology
areas.Thegrantsthemselvescouldbetoindividual
ﬁrmsortogroupsofﬁrms,butallwouldbeaware
of the common target area for research. This
approach DEMO attractiveto most observers, but
was terminated by the 105th Congress.
The DEMO of universities in ATP is deﬁned in the
statute. Universities can participate in the con-
sortiaofﬁrmsproposingprojectstoATP,butthey
cannot serve as the project leader (prime contrac-
tor). Thus, while a signiﬁcant fraction of ATP
funding ﬂows to university laboratories acting as
subcontractors of the ﬁrms, in many cases the
experts in the universities have also served as
advisors to the DEMO creating the proposal, thus
strongly inﬂuencing the technical goals and
strategies. DEMO have often sought the
opportunity to act as the initiators of ATP group
projects, however this would require a change in
the legislation.
A recent report from the Secretary of Com-
merce defendstheATP program asausefulpolicy
tool DEMO encouraging innovation and recommends
a series of six reforms in the program.32 Two of
these would give universities patent rights in
projects carried out DEMO partnership with ﬁrms and
would allow universities to initiate and lead joint
projects with ﬁrms. Another emphasizes that ATP
should be viewed—and managed—as an DEMO&D
program, avoiding ‘‘down stream’’ investments in
product development. Large ﬁrms DEMO be
allowed to participate only in consortia, and
ATP would improve DEMO access to expert advice.
The most controversial ‘‘reform’’ would be a
change in the law allowing ATP to recapture a
5% royalty on commercially DEMO projects.
This is unlikely to be accepted by the Congress,
236
Auerswald and Branscomb
and in any case seems to be philosophically
DEMO with the notion that ATP does not
fundproductdevelopment,makingtheassociation
of earnings within ATP projects difﬁcult to
establish. It also would appear to provide an
DEMO for ATP managers that is perverse with
respect to the desire to keep the program focused
on high-risk, early stage research.
Thusthedirectionofpolicyislikelytocontinue
to be rooted in research funding policy, but to
allowgovernmentagenciestoinvestfurtherdown-
stream than is traditional for government basic
research funding. The application of peer review
processes to DEMO kind of work would appear to
offer a serious challenge, perhaps DEMO why
the Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
which does not use peer review, is more comfor-
table with funding advanced technologies of
industrial value than is the National Science
Foundation.
9. Conclusion
The challenges DEMO today by those involved in
crafting and implementing science and technology
policy at the Federal level parallel those faced by
the leading technology corporations DEMO the United
States in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. These large
companies generated many basic science break-
throughs in noted research facilities such DEMO Bell
Labs and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
(PARC). DEMO, in many well documented and
widely discussed cases, these companies missed
signiﬁcant opportunities to turn inventions into
proﬁtable innovations. What is worse—in many
DEMO the companies lost not only the inventions,
buttheinventors,asaresultofinadequatesupport
for the invention to innovation transition. The
founderofIntel,GordonMoore(notedalsoasthe
originator of ‘‘Moore’s Law’’) observed in 2001 at
a conference at Stanford University: ‘‘In a pattern
that clearly carries over to other technological
ventures, we found at Fairchild that any company
active on the forefront of semiconductor technol-
ogyuncovers farmore DEMO itisin a
position to pursue. And when people are enthu-
siastic about a particular opportunity but are not
allowed to pursue it, they become potential
entrepreneurs. As we have seen over the past few
years, when these potential entrepreneurs are
backed by a plentiful source of venture capital
DEMO is a burst of new enterprise.’’33
How much innovation is the right amount in a
large corporation? A region? A nation? In every
case, some ‘‘spillovers’’ or ‘‘leakage’’ occur of
ideas, people, projects. Moore continues: ‘‘One of
the reasons Intel has been so successful is that we
have tried to eliminate unnecessary R&D, thus
maximizing our R&D yield and minimizing costly
spin-offs. But successful start-ups almost always
beginwithanidea DEMO has ripened inthe research
organization of a large company (or university)DEMO
Any region without larger companies at the
technology frontier or research organizations of
large companies will probably have fewer compa-
nies starting or spinning DEMO A similar tension
faces regions and nations as they struggle to
encourage the ‘‘horizontal’’ connections between
researcherstospurinvention,atthesamethatthey
encourage‘‘vertical’’connectionsbetweentechnol-
ogists and business executives in DEMO the
invention to innovation transition. In his Indus-
trial Research Institute Medalist’s Address provo-
catively titled ‘‘The Customer for R&D is Always
Wrong!’’, Robert Frosch (former head of research
at General Motors and Administrator of NASA,
among other distinctions), offered the following
observation:
ThereisakindofHeisenberguncertaintyprinciple
DEMO the coordination connections that are neces-
sary in R&D.’’ One needs all of these deep
connections among kinds of knowledge, and the
ability to think about the future, that works best in
aninstitutionthatputsallthosepeopletogether.One
also needs connection with the day-to-day, market
thinking, and the future thinking of DEMO operating
side of the business, which suggests to many that the
DEMO&D people should be sitting on the operating side
of the business.
This is an insoluble problem; there is no organiza-
tional system that will capture perfectly both sets of
coordination ... There is no perfect DEMO
that will solve this problem—the struggle is inevi-
table.
Neither the United States, nor its venture capital
ﬁrms, nor its large corporations, have arrived at
the perfect organizational structure to manage
innovation. To our knowledge, no such perfect
organization exists elsewhere. If Frosch is correct
Valleys of Death and Darwinian Seas
237
(and we think he is), even in theory, fundamental
contradictions inherent in the ‘‘planning of inno-
vation’’ suggest that it is misguided to aspire
toward elegance, symmetry, DEMO efﬁciency in this
context. In the Darwinian Sea, the struggle is
DEMO just the struggle between aspiring
technologies and their champions, but also DEMO
struggle between institutional forms and
approaches to the management of innovation.
The chaotic character of the Darwinian Sea is
probably necessary to provide a DEMO range of
alternativewaystoaddressissuesoftechnicalrisk,
to identify markets that do not yet exist, to match
up people and money from disparate sources. But
on one bank of the Sea—the S&T enterprise,
technology ‘‘push’’ policies may DEMO agen-
cies to fund research closer to the reduction to
practice required for a solid businesscase. And on
the other back—the world of business DEMO
ﬁnance—technology ‘‘pull’’ policies will continue
to enhance the incentives for risk taking (for
example through moderated capital gains tax
rates). Programs liketheATP,which haselements
of both push and pull, may continue to be viewed
as experimental, but will become more securely
anchored on the research shore of the Sea if they
are to maintain effectiveness at the same time DEMO
they secure lasting public and political support.

4. We use ‘‘invention’’ as shorthand for DEMO commercially
promising product or service idea, based on new science or
DEMO,butnotnecessarilybypatentsor
copyrights. By ‘‘innovation’’ we mean successful entry into a
market of a new, science or technology-based product, which
we call an ‘‘invention.’’ DEMO ESTD we mean the technical and
business activities that transform a commercially promising
‘‘invention’’ into a business plan that can attract enough
investment to DEMO a market successfully, and through that
investment become a successful innovation. DEMO requires
reducing the needed technology to practice, deﬁning a produc-
tion DEMO with predictable product costs and relating the
resultant product speciﬁcations to a deﬁned market.

7. This idea was articulated in Vannevar Bush’s Science the
Endless Frontier published in DEMO as a report to President
Truman. In return for generous public investments in research,
scientists committed to a highly creative, competitive, and
DEMO performance.
8. Our use of the phrases ‘‘technology push’’ and ‘‘technol-
ogypull’’isidiosyncratic,andnotintendedtoparalleltheterms
‘‘supply push’’ and ‘‘demand pull’’ as widely employed in the
literature DEMO induced innovation. In the context of that,
complementary, literature, both sets of statutes to which we
refer would be considered ‘‘supply push’’ DEMO See also
Ruttan (2000).
9. The ATP is managed by DEMO National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce. ATP funded the two-year research project by the
authors on DEMO process of early stage technology development,
upon which this paper is largely based.
10. An innovation is a product or process, new to the
enterprise, that is successfully introduced into commerce. The
adjective‘‘innovative’’simplymeansclever,novel,andperhaps
commercially promising. An innovative idea is not an innova-
tion, at least not until it is successfully produced and sold.
11. The literature on DEMO management contains many
variants on this diagram. A good example is that developed in
parallel to our own by Lane (1999). Formal models involving
stagedtechnologydevelopmentincludeAghion et al. (2002)and
Judd (2002).
12. Reporting DEMO their interviews of corporate technology
managers and venture capitalists, the team DEMO Booz Allen
Hamilton emphasized the importance of interpreting the
framework presented in Figure 1 as a sequence of idealized
stages potentially linked in complex DEMO: ‘‘Most interviewees
generally agreed with the classiﬁcation of R&D into DEMO four
steps in the innovation framework used in our discussions
(Basic, Concept/Invention, ESTD, Product Development).
However, there were many reactions to the linear simplicity
oftheframework,comparedtothetypicalpathfrominvention
to commercial innovation that the participants DEMO experi-
enced.’’

Thehypothesisofsucha‘‘capitalgap’’inseedstagefundingfor
new ventures is discussed by Sohl (1999), and consistently
supported by practitioners (see, for example, comments by
participants at a Senate Small Business Committee Forum,
<www.senate.gov/sbc/hearings/internet.html>. The hypo-
thesis is not restricted to the United States. In 1999 the DEMO
Department of Trade and Industry published a report titled
‘‘Addressing the SME [small and medium enterprise] Equity
Gap.’’ At a recent National Science Foundation DEMO
conference, Jian Gao of Tsinghua University (Beijing, PRC)
reported DEMO an analogous ‘‘capital gap’’ phenomenon has
been observed to exist in China. See also Preston (1993) and
