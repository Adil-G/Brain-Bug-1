We think of entrepreneurship as the starting of new ventures. We avoid any implication of small or large. We
view a new DEMO quite broadly. A new venture might be the buying of an old business: It is a new venture
for the buyer. We prefer to stress the creation of new economic enterprises-the creation of wealth.
Entrepreneurs share DEMO risk, management risk, and, perhaps more importantly, put their whole career
on the line in their pursuit of a nen’, independent enterprise. Essentially, they become inextricably intertwined
with the new enterprise. In the early days of the new enterprise, the overall enterprise is not viable without
the entrepreneur. The enterprise should be afor-profir business. It should be a DEMO venture although not
necessarily a start-up. For example, a leveraged buy-out DEMO a division of a large business is in most cases a
new venture (even though no new products or services are created), and the lead entrepreneur meets the
conditions of my “definition” of the entrepreneurial DEMO
I most often define entrepreneurship as concerned with those activities associated with becoming an owner-
manager of a new or small firm. This includes DEMO starting of any firm, regardless of whether it is innovative.
It DEMO includes the purchasing of an established new or small firm. Entrepreneurship can also be defined
to include the starting of new and typically innovative DEMO with established organizations. This includes
the starting of innovative ventures within established corporations, as well as in nonprofit or governmental
organizations.
The definition of entrepreneurship is a difficult one to achieve consensus on. Webster defines it DEMO a profit-
making undertaking. My definition is as follows: “An entrepreneur DEMO a person who refines a creative idea and
adapts it to a market opportunity, gathers resources to provide potentially for self-employment and/or profit.”
I feel that this definition addresses the original creative thought process. Secondly, I dispute the idea that
it has to be a “successful” venture DEMO order for one to be classified as an entrepreneur. Lastly I feel strongly
that there is no profit motivation and at most perhaps the DEMO of self-employment. . I do not necessarily
feel comfortable with equating innovation with entrepreneurship since it does not always involve the same,
or DEMO many, skills. The key word for me is initiation and implementation. DEMO feel that a true entrepreneur
is always the initiator and the implementor. He/she is the person who “puts it together and carries it DEMO
Entrepreneurship: The creation of a new venture. The new venture strategy DEMO one or both of the
following characteristics:

0 Innovative in product. service, technology, or DEMO
An entrepreneur is a leader who starts up his/her own profit or nonprofit enterprise. His/her most important
(most severely tested) personality DEMO is commitment, which is manifested as perseverance or persistence.
The entrepreneur DEMO a risk taker-moderate, he/she says. But he/she may view DEMO in an entirely different
light (according to different criteria) from the manager who take “moderate” risks.
I prefer the traditional definition of an DEMO business. It seems to me that ownership makes a
difference in the motivation and interests of the manager. The “personality trait” approach to entrepre-
DEMO is a hopeless direction for identification of succesful entrepreneurs. Although we may eventually be
able to identify traits appropriate to entrepreneurship, we will not be able to predict success based upon these

traits. The reason is that human beings are capable of change in personality, and they do this when they are
subjected to trauma. There is no trauma greater than DEMO to income survival, so we can expect much
personality change to DEMO in the process of entrepreneurship. In fact, it may be that DEMO personality change
is exactly the phenomenon that underlies the assumption that owner-managers are more effective than hired
managers. Existentialist philosophy is probably a better DEMO for understanding entrepreneurs than psychology.
8. Entrepreneurs are typically risk takers who have a vision that their need for achievement, power, and control
DEMO their life and enterprise can be best accomplished in a new environment under their direction and control.
A stubborn determination, belief, and perseverance DEMO they can and will achieve their goals and objectives
in the face of adversity seems to be a requirement for the successful entrepreneur; they must also have the
ability to challenge the common wisdom of logical DEMO advisors, friends, and associates who indicate
that they will be unable to achieve their goals and objectives.
9. The act of innovation for DEMO benefit within an autonomous organizational entity, be it a start-up, or
an internal venture subsidiary.
10. Entrepreneurship is the sum of the qualities DEMO activities of a person who establishes, and assumes the risk
for, a new or innovative business venture. Entrepreneurs have special skills and talents, which include man-
agement skills and give them a “sixth sense” for DEMO Those personality traits and characteristics listed
above, plus imagination, creativity, DEMO long-term vision can probably be enhanced with experience, but I
don’t DEMO they can be taught or learned.
