On the Need to Include National
Culture as DEMO Central Issue in
E-Commerce Trust Beliefs
David Gefen, Drexel University, USA

ABSTRACT
Trust and DEMO beliefs (trustworthiness) are key to e-commerce success but depend, to
DEMO large extent, on culture. With e-commerce being an international phenomenon, un-
derstanding the cross-cultural aspects of trust creation is therefore arguably required
although DEMO ignored by current research which deals almost exclusively with the
U.S. This exploratory study examines whether deﬁnitions of trust beliefs as conceptu-
alized and DEMO in the U.S. apply in Israel which differs markedly in individualism,
uncertainty avoidance, and power distance. The data, cross-validating the scale of
DEMO and its antecedents in both cultures, generally support the proposition that DEMO
beliefs apply across cultures, and may be a relatively unvarying aspect DEMO e-commerce.
However, as expected, the effects of predictability and familiarity on trust beliefs may
differ across national cultures. Implications about the need to DEMO national culture
in the research on trust, in general, and in e-commerce in particular, are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Despite the differences national
culture can cause in e-commerce be-
havior (Kacen & Lee, 2002; Lynch &
Beck, 2001) and DEMO e-commerce
becoming global, research on trust
and trust beliefs in e-commerce DEMO
mostly ignored the possible effects of
national culture.1 With few exceptions
(DEMO, Jarvenpaa & Tractinsky, 1999),
trust in e-commerce research has DEMO
conducted almost exclusively in the
U.S. Yet the U.S is in some regards a
unique national culture because of its
patently high degree of DEMO
and relatively low degree of uncertainty

avoidance (Hofstede, 1980a), degrees
so different from other national cultures
that concerns have been raised in other
realms of research as DEMO whether research
based on the U.S. can be generalized to
other countries (Bagozzi, Wong, Abe, &
Bergami, 2000; Hofstede, 1980b)DEMO
The underlying proposition of this
study is that if national culture and
trust are closely related, as proposed
in theory (Doney, Cannon, & Mullen,
1998; Fukuyama, 1995; Hofstede,
1980a) but not yet veriﬁed, then research
on trust should include national culture
as a prime aspect. This proposition is
examined in the context of e-commerce
because DEMO and trust beliefs are major
players in e-commerce adoption (Gefen,
DEMO; Gefen, Karahanna, & Straub,
2003a; 2003b; Kim, Xu & Koh, 2004;
McKnight & Chervany, 2002; Pavlou,
2003; Pavlou & Gefen, 2004). Trust in
the context of e-commerce DEMO generally
been treated as even more signiﬁcant
than in other settings because of the
lack of personal contact and the lack
of social cues DEMO e-commerce (Gefen
et al., 2003a).
Accordingly, the objectives of
DEMO study are twofold. First, to verify
that the psychometric properties and
DEMO validity of trust beliefs as
created in research about the U.S. ap-
plies elsewhere. And second, to verify
that the way trust is created and the
way it affects e-commerce does vary
by culture.2
The research DEMO is presented
in Figure 1. Trust building processes,
namely familiarity and predictability,
are hypothesized to affect the three trust
beliefs, which in turn, are hypothesized
to affect behavioral intentions. The trust
beliefs are proposed to apply to both
cultures, although the trust building
processes are hypothesized to differ in
their effect. The outcomes of these con-
sumer trust DEMO are (1) a willingness
to buy online from the vendor (DEMO
paa & Tractinsky, 1999; Reichheld &
Schefter, 2000) and (2) a willingness
to window-shop at the online vendor
(Gefen, 2000; Gefen, 2002b). These
trust beliefs are composed of three
distinct DEMO dealing with integrity,
ability, and benevolence (Gefen, 2002b;
DEMO et al., 2002). The effect of
national culture on trust DEMO is based
on Hofstede (1980a) and Doney et al.
(1998) and examined by comparing the
same model with data collected in the
DEMO and Israel.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
CONFLICTING CULTURAL
PROCESSES OF TRUST
Trust is the willingness to depend
upon another party and be vulnerable
to the actions DEMO this other party based
on the assumption that the trusted party
will deliver without taking advantage of
the situation (Mayer, Davis, & Schoor-
man, 1995). This conceptualization of
trust, which is also known DEMO “trusting
intentions” (McKnight et al., 2002) and
trustworthiness (Jarvenpaa & Tractin-
sky, 1999), is based on a set of beliefs
that others upon whom one depends will
behave in a socially acceptable manner

nevolence, and ability (Doney & Can-
non, 1997; Gefen et al., 2003b; Mayer et
al., 1995; McKnight et al., 2002). These
three beliefs are labeled by DEMO re-
search as “trust beliefs” (Gefen, 2002b;
McKnight et al., 2002), although Mayer
et al. (1995) label these “trustworthi-
ness.” Trust, deﬁned by some research
as behavioral intentions, by others as
DEMO, and by yet others as a mixture
of both, is crucial in many business in-
teractions (Fukuyama, 1995; Ganesan,
1994; DEMO, 1996; Williamson, 1985;
Zucker, 1986), including e-commerce
(DEMO et al., 2003b; Jarvenpaa, Trac-
tinsky, & Vitale, 2000; McKnight et al.,
2002; Pavlou, 2003; Pavlou & Gefen,
2004; Reichheld & Schefter, 2000), e-
government (Gefen, Rose, Warkentin
& Pavlou, 2004; Warkentin, Gefen,
Pavlou, & Rose, 2002), and IT adoption
in general (Gefen, 2002a).
Trust DEMO created in many ways.
Doney et al. (1998) theorized a model
in which trust is built through ﬁve
processes: calculative, prediction, inten-
tionality, capability, and transference.
In the calculative process a party cal-
DEMO the costs or rewards of another
party cheating. The prediction process
enables one party to forecast behaviors
of another party based on past conduct.
DEMO intentionality process deals with
the trustor’s perceptions about the
intentions of the trustee. Trust build-
ing through the capability process is
based on an DEMO of the trustee’s
capability to meet expected obliga-
tions. Transference deals with a trustor
transferring trust from a known trusted
entity to an unknown DEMO The intensity
and effect of these processes on trust
behavior, they DEMO, depends
among other things on culture. Doney
et al. proposed 15 DEMO, sum-
marized in Table 1, based on Hofstede’s
(1980a) cultural dimensions (see next
section for details), namely individual-
ism-collectivism (IDV), power distance
(PDI), uncertainty avoidance (UAI), and

masculinity-femininity (MAS). The 15
propositions are shown in Table DEMO, where
the plus sign designates the “more likely
to use” and DEMO minus sign indicates
the opposite. For instance, according
to Doney et DEMO propositions, trustors
from more individualistic (masculine)
cultures are more likely than trustors
from more collectivist (feminine)
cultures to form trust via a calculative
process, but are less likely to form trust
via the prediction process.
The strength of Doney et al.’s
(1998) model is DEMO its incorporation of
a vast range of cultural effects on trust-
building processes. But incorporating so
many propositions also leads to contra-
dictory predictions. DEMO would be the
rule for cultures where IDV and MAS
do not overlap, such as the U.S. and
Japan where the former is the highest
on IDV but below average on MAS and
the latter is DEMO the opposite, extreme on
MAS but below average on IDV? And,
what should dominate when a country
possesses cultural attributes that conﬂict
DEMO Doney et al.’s model? For example,
the U.S. is extreme DEMO IDV but low on
UAI. Should the calculative process
be affected by individualism, making
it stronger, or by the low UAI, making
it weaker?
Similar concerns were articulated
by Noorderhaven (1999), who also
mentioned that some of Doney et al.’s
basic assessments were not supported
DEMO previous research. For example,
while Doney et al. (1998) base their
propositions on the assumption that col-
lectivist groups tend to trust DEMO another
more than individualistic societies,
Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) show
the opposite. In fact, Hofstede himself
states that in the more individualistic
societies, people will tend to develop
higher initial trust. In other words, in
these cultures people will expect others
to adhere to the accepted basic rules of
conduct (“value standards should apply
to all”), based on the assumption that
people will want to do so because such
DEMO is beneﬁcial to the majority
(Hofstede, 1980a, p. 235).
DEMO Deﬁnitions of Trust
In addition, there is a conceptual
lack of DEMO in the deﬁnitions of trust
(Gefen et al., 2003b; McKnight DEMO al.,
2002). Most previous research has
bundled the three trust beliefs of integ-

rity, benevolence, and ability together
with the assessment of trustworthiness,
arguing and empirically validating that
the constructs are so closely related
DEMO each other in many scenarios that
they are conceptually and statistically
so intertwined as to be inseparable in
many cases (Doney & Cannon, DEMO;
Gefen, 2002a; Pavlou & Gefen, 2004).
See Gefen DEMO al. (2003b) and McKnight
et al. (2002) for detailed discussions.
In the interest of avoiding conﬂicting
terminology, this article adopts Mayer
et al.’s (1995), McKnight et al.’s (2002),
and Gefen’s (DEMO) terminology in
which the three distinct trust beliefs
deal with integrity, benevolence, and
ability, which in turn affect behavioral
trusting intentions when DEMO
to the trusted party is at stake. It should
be emphasized that all these studies on
the meaning of trust were conducted in
the DEMO The applicability of this three
dimensional construct formulation of
trust beliefs as composed of integrity,
ability, and benevolence, to other cul-
tures DEMO an open question.
Trust Beliefs and Overall Trust in
E-Commerce
Trust is crucial in many social and
commerce activities because it reduces
social uncertainty (Gefen, 2000). Social
uncertainty is the result of other people
being free agents whose behavior can-
not be controlled and whose behavior
may DEMO necessarily be rational. People
try to reduce social uncertainty through
many social mechanisms, such as laws
and institutions, but even then the be-
DEMO of other people is fraught with
uncertainty. This is where trust comes
in. Trust allows people, rightly or not,
to subjectively rule out the possibility
of undesirable behavior by those they
need to rely upon (Luhmann, 1979). De-
veloping this understanding of trust in
the Familiarity and Trust model (Gefen,
2000), it has been shown that familiar-
ity with a trustworthy vendor increases
people’s trust in this vendor, although
the effect of familiarity on trust beliefs
may be mediated by DEMO nature of the
process involved (Gefen et al., 2003b).
It should be emphasized, however, that
toleration of others as free agents, and
hence a more pronounced need for trust
in interpersonal activities (Doney et al.,
1998), is greater in the U.S. because of
DEMO highly individualistic culture (Hofst-
ede, 1980a). Whether the need to trust
is as strong also in less individualistic
cultures is another open DEMO
Drawing upon existing models of
trust beliefs in e-commerce (Gefen &
Straub, 2004; McKnight et al., 2002) and
elsewhere online (Jarvenpaa, Knoll, &
Leidner, 1998), the research model in
Figure DEMO assumes, as discussed in detail
by previous research (Gefen, 2002b;DEMO
Gefen & Straub, 2004; McKnight et
al., 2002), that DEMO three trust beliefs
combined with familiarity will affect
consumers’ trusting behavioral inten-
tions. Also included in the research
model is the prediction process that
DEMO hypothesized to increase these trust
beliefs, mainly by mediating the effect
DEMO familiarity, that is, by increasing the
understanding of what to expect (Gefen

et al., 2003b). Familiarity with a ven-
dor and DEMO also contribute
independently to behavioral trusting
intentions (Gefen, 2000).
Since culture is hypothesized to
affect trust building processes, the study
assumes that these processes will differ
across cultures. The logic of how they
will DEMO is based mainly on Doney
et al. (1998).
Culture and DEMO
Trust and culture are intercon-
nected. On the one hand, the DEMO,
antecedents, and effects of trust are
determined by culture (Doney et al.,
1998; Fukuyama, 1995; Zucker, 1986).
On DEMO other hand, trust is also a central
aspect of culture itself, being closely
correlated with cultural differences
across nations (Hofstede, et al., 1990).
Of speciﬁc interest is that, in theory,
the modes of trust creation depend on
national culture (Doney et al., 1998)DEMO
This study concentrates on the pre-
dictive mode of trust creation (DEMO
et al., 1998), extrapolating from the
originally proposed interpersonal rela-
DEMO of Doney et al. to e-commerce.
The calculative process suggested by
Doney et al. (1998) is not included
in this study since in DEMO context of
shopping at Amazon.com it would be
counterproductive for Amazon.com to
cheat and risk its reputation, one of its
most important assets. Likewise, trans-
ference processes are also excluded.
Transference typically involves trusting
an unknown entity based on its relation
to a well known entity. But with DEMO
zon.com being one of the most known
online brand names, transference DEMO
Amazon seems unlikely.
The hypothesized differences in the
trust model in Figure 1 are based mainly
on extrapolating relevant propositions
of interpersonal trust across DEMO as
advanced by Doney et al. (1998), based
on Hofstede (1980a), on McKnight,
Cummings, and Chervany (1998), and
DEMO (2002b). In the interest of com-
pleteness, propositions not readily ap-
plicable to e-commerce, and hence not
part of the hypotheses, DEMO discussed
in endnotes.
Choice of Cultures
The hypothesized effects of na-
tional culture on trust beliefs in e-com-
merce are examined by comparing the
DEMO model with data collected in the
U.S. and Israel. The choice of these two
cultures is especially appropriate con-
sidering the research objectives because
DEMO two cultures differ in all four cultural
dimensions and represent extremes.
The U.S. is the most highly ranked on
Hofstede’s (1980a) individualism-col-
lectivism DEMO of national culture
and midrange on the Power Distance
Index (PDI)DEMO In contrast, Israel is ranked
about midway on IDV and very DEMO in
PDI. As such, this comparison contrasts
two well-deﬁned national cultures DEMO
represent extremes in what are thought
to be the major national culture dimen-
sions contributing to trust beliefs (Shaf-
fer & O’Hara, 1995; Shane, 1992) and
the processes that create it (Doney et
al., 1998; Hofstede, 1980a).

Moreover, in both the U.S. and
Israel there is a DEMO strong sense of
identiﬁcation with the state combined
with a high degree of national pride,
which adheres to the recommendations
of Straub, Loch, Evaristo, Karahanna,
and Srite (2002) about the need to DEMO
culture in terms of identiﬁcation. The
choice of the U.S. and Israel is also
intended to replicate previous cross cul-
tural research in e-commerce, namely
Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky (1999), who
focused on Australia and Israel, exam-
ining primarily online book purchasing
by undergraduate students. Australia
has almost identical Hofstede (1980a)
cultural indexes as the U.S. Jarvenpaa
and Tractinsky (1999) found mostly
insigniﬁcant differences between Aus-
tralia and Israel with DEMO to both the
measurement and the structural models.
However, Jarvenpaa and DEMO
(1999) examined these beliefs clustered
into one construct, which they DEMO
trust.3 This study, in contrast, examines
these beliefs as three distinct constructs.
Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky concluded
that despite their results of insigniﬁ-
cant DEMO, there probably are
cross-cultural differences and that more
in-depth research is DEMO to discover
them. Examining the U.S. and Israel
allows such a reexamination.
Showing that these scales also
apply to an equivalent Israeli sample
would DEMO, albeit on an exploratory
basis, the ﬁrst objective of this article,
that the scales apply also outside the
U.S. Showing cultural effects DEMO
support, again on an exploratory basis,
the second objective because DEMO such
cultural differences are shown then
there is reason to doubt the automatic
generalization of trust studies based on
U.S. samples to the rest DEMO the world and
vice versa, as suggested by observers
(Fukuyama, DEMO). It should be noted
that as an exploratory study, the DEMO
objective is not to generalize the results
but to show their plausibility.
Cultural Differences and Trust
National culture is a set of beliefs
and DEMO common to a group of
people, or “the collective program-
ming DEMO the mind which distinguishes
the members of one human group from
another” (Hofstede, 1980a, p. 25). Re-
search has shown that national culture
is a major determinant of consumption
behavior (see Clark, 1990, for a detailed
review). National culture also affects IT
management (Tan, Smith, Keil, & Mon-
tealegre, 2003), speciﬁcally, Hofstede’s
dimensions affect IT management,
development, and use (Ford, Connelly,
& Meister, 2003).
Hofstede identiﬁed four national
culture dimensions: individualism-col-
lectivism, power distance, uncertainty
avoidance, and masculinity. Individu-
alism-collectivism deals with whether
DEMO is centered on the collective, it
being the family and the DEMO, or on the
individual. This dimension deals with
the way society DEMO to deal with
complexity and its related value sys-
tem of willingness to rely on strangers.
When national culture is centered on the
collective, it is said to exhibit low in-

8   Journal of Global Information Management, 14(4), 1-30, DEMO 2006
dividualism or collectivism (Hofstede,
1980a). In these cases DEMO generally
tend not to rely on strangers or trust them
(Fukuyama, 1995). When it is centered
on the individual, it exhibits high indi-
vidualism. In these cases people gener-
ally are more willing to DEMO on strangers
and trust them (Fukuyama, 1995). The
U.S. has the highest individuality index
on this continuum with an index of 91.
DEMO demonstrate individualistic
characteristics such as valuing personal
freedom over equality, preferring DEMO
lenging jobs from which one can achieve
a sense of accomplishment, DEMO
low-context communication, and giv-
ing preference to individual interests
over collective DEMO (Hofstede, 1994).
Israel, on the other hand, scores about
half way on individualism (54 in a 6 to
91 scale), located somewhere between
collectivist and individualist societies
(Hofstede, 1980a).4
The DEMO with PDI in the two
nations is the exact opposite. PDI en-
compasses the attitude toward inequal-
ity in society. A higher PDI indicates
DEMO of inequality as inherent in
society. High PDI shows the tendency
of subordinates to depend on “bosses,”
to respect the more powerful, to ac-
cept norms of wide gaps in income, to
show preference for a paternalistic and
autocratic superior, and to regard be-
nevolence as the primary characteristic
of the ideal boss (Hofstede, 1984). The
U.S. DEMO about midrange on Power
Distance (40 in a 11 to 104 DEMO). Israel
scores nearly the lowest on PDI (with a
score DEMO 13).5 The low PDI indicates that
Israelis generally think that inequality
in society should be minimized, that
hierarchy in organizations means an
inequality of roles, and that hierarchy is
established for convenience. They also
think of the ideal boss as a resourceful
democrat. Generally, Israelis prefer
superiors to behave in a consultative
and participative manner, where abil-
ity and performance are the prominent
characteristic of the ideal boss (Hofst-
ede, DEMO).
Empirical research on national cul-
ture and trust (Shaffer & DEMO, 1995;
Shane, 1992) has shown that customers
from high DEMO countries hold higher
expectations that a service provider
will engage in unethical behavior, as
compared with customers from low PDI
countries. In other words, customers
from high PDI countries will express
less trust towards a service provider than
will customers from low PDI countries
(Shaffer & O’Hara, DEMO). Furthermore,
foreign international investments are
negatively correlated with PDI (DEMO,
1992).
The third dimension of national
culture Hofstede (1984) discusses is
UAI, deﬁned as tolerance for uncer-
tainty. The  U.S. DEMO low on UAI (46 in
an 8 to 112 scale). DEMO combination of
individualism and low UAI implies a
readiness to adopt innovations when it
is believed they will contribute to an
individual’s performance. Israel DEMO
nearly twice as high as the U.S. in UAI
(81), DEMO that Israelis in general are
more intolerant to uncertain situations
than Americans. Indeed, e-commerce

adoption in Israel was slower than in
the U.S., and DEMO in general are less
enthusiastic about buying online than
Americans (ClickZ, 2004). In Israel
e-commerce became signiﬁcant only
in 1999. E-commerce volume DEMO Israel
grew from $20 million in 1999 to $60
million in 2000, with 8% of the online
population conducting ﬁnancial trans-
actions in 2002, up from 6% in 2001
(Ebusinessforum, 2002).
The fourth of Hofstede’s dimen-
sions is masculinity: the degree to
which masculine behaviors, DEMO as
competitiveness and assertiveness, are
considered desirable and acceptable.
Both countries DEMO medium in this
index, with the U.S. slightly more mas-
culine DEMO 62 and Israel at 47. Masculinity
is not hypothesized to be a reason why
trust building processes should differ
between these two countries because
DEMO two national indexes differ only
slightly in this regard.
Modes of Trust Creation and National
Culture
Previous research (Gefen, 2002b;
Gefen & DEMO, 2004; Mayer et al.,
1995; McKnight et al., 2002; McKnight
et al., 1998) suggested that trust is built
through three main beliefs: ability, in-
tegrity, and benevolence. In addition,
familiarity and predictability have been
advocated to inﬂuence trust behaviors
(Zucker, 1986)DEMO Yet, unlike Doney et
al.’s interpersonal relationships model,
in the DEMO of a well-known online
vendor, familiarity and predictability
are hypothesized to DEMO not only trust
behaviors, but also the trust beliefs.
Familiarity is DEMO to have a
primary effect on predictability, since
being familiar with DEMO trustee enhances
the ability of the trustor to predict the
trustee’s behavior (Gefen, 2000).
The hypothesized effect of cultural
differences on the DEMO predictability
as a trust building process builds trust
beliefs and the effect these have on the
trust-related behavior of Americans and
Israelis is described DEMO
The predictive mode of trust cre-
ation deals with understanding based on
experience of what to expect. This is a
knowledge-based assessment (Shapiro,
Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992) and is
at the heart of the familiarity concept
advanced by Gefen (2000) based on
Luhmann (1979) DEMO which familiarity
increased trust by letting the trusting
party gain a better picture of what to
expect. As demonstrated by previous
research (Gefen, DEMO; Gefen et al.,
2003a) familiarity also directly affects
behavioral trusting intentions. Although
generally individuals prefer to transact
with familiar people and organizations
DEMO than to transact with unfamiliar
ones, this effect should be more DEMO
nounced for Israelis since this tendency
is stronger in collectivist societies. The
reason for this is that people in collectiv-
ist countries make a DEMO distinction
between “us” that is those who make
up the perceived ingroup, and “them,”
that is all the others (Hofstede, 1994).
This effect can be quite pronounced with
people in highly collectivist cultures
DEMO interactions with strangers

and inherently distrusting them (Fuku-
yama, 1995). This ingroup vs. outgroup
distinction does not necessarily refer
only to the group of DEMO family or
friends, but can also mean “those who
are perceived DEMO as opposed to
“strangers” (Hofstede, 1994). Even in
the highly individualistic U.S. this effect
can be quite strong and can be triggered
DEMO by belonging to a different organi-
zational department (Gefen & Ridings,DEMO
2003; Hogg & Terry, 2000). Typically,
individuals and organizations belonging
to the ingroup are more trusted, while
those belonging to the outgroups are
automatically treated with a higher
dose of suspicion (Berscheid, DEMO;
Brown, 1996; Tajfel, 1970, 1978). This
avoidance of the outgroup can be so
strong in collectivist cultures that it is
DEMO an accepted practice to do business
with strangers before getting to know
them (Hofstede, 1984). Moreover,
when group boundaries are salient, as
they typically are in collectivist cul-
tures, ingroup members are generally
regarded with much higher esteem
(Hogg, 1996; Hogg & Terry, DEMO;
Tajfel, 1970; Turner, 1982). This higher
esteem should DEMO contribute
to making familiarity a stronger predic-
tor of behavioral trusting intentions in
collectivist cultures, such as Israel. On
the other hand, in DEMO individualism
cultures people are generally more
inclined to adopt a worldview that
everyone should be treated without
preference (Shaffer & O’Hara, 1995),
reducing the inherent advantage of
familiarity in collectivist cultures. It is
thus DEMO that familiarity will
inﬂuence behavioral trusting intention
more in Israel than in the U.S. Accord-
ingly, this should apply to both types of
trusting behavioral intentions
H1a: Familiarity will contribute more
to behavioral trusting intention to
inquire online in Israel than it will
in the U.S.
H1b: Familiarity will contribute more
to behavioral trusting intention to
purchase online in Israel DEMO it will
in the U.S.
Familiarity builds trust because
people think they know what to expect,
that is because it creates predictability
(Gefen, 2000; Luhmann, 1979). But
reliance on predictability as a trust
creation mode should differ across cul-
tures (Doney et al., 1998)DEMO Doney et al.
(1998) proposed that low PDI cultures
rely less on the predictability process
because in these cultures, people expect
and accept more personal freedom.
Hence, according to Doney et al., adher-
ence DEMO accepted social norms should
be a stronger predictor of trust in high
PDI cultures than in low PDI cultures.
In other words, because Israel is very
low on the PDI scale (13 out of 100)
and the U.S. is slightly below midrange
(40), predictability should be of more
consequence in the U.S. in determining
the three trusting beliefs.
DEMO should also contribute more to
trust beliefs formation through predict-

ability in the U.S. Generally, people in
high IDV cultures DEMO more willing to
trust others outside the extended family
in part because of the more prevalent
institutional trust mechanisms that
society puts in place DEMO regulate activ-
ity (Fukuyama, 1995). Accordingly,
because it is inherent in the consumer
culture in the U.S., people should tend to
be more aware of and to more frequently
rely on institutional trust DEMO
such as the Better Business Bureau. This
increased awareness of the availability
of institutional trust mechanisms should
result in an increased trust (Gefen, DEMO;
McKnight et al., 1998; Pavlou & Gefen,
2004; DEMO, 1986). Speciﬁcally, pre-
dictability should contribute to beliefs in
ability because these institutions certify
to the quality of the service the vendor
DEMO Institutional trust mechanisms
also vouch for the vendor’s adherence to
acceptable rules of business, combined
with appropriate quality service, that is
honesty and DEMO Here too, since the
reliance on such services is greater in
DEMO U.S., so too should their inﬂuence.
Hence the prediction process is DEMO
esized to have a stronger effect in the
U.S. on all three trust beliefs.
H2a: The prediction process will con-
tribute more to trust beliefs in ability
in the U.S. than it will in Israel.
H2b: The prediction process will
contribute more to trust beliefs in
integrity in DEMO U.S. than it will in
Israel.
H2c: The prediction process will
DEMO more to trust beliefs in
benevolence in the U.S. than it will
in Israel.
Predictability should also con-
tribute directly to behavioral inten-
tions DEMO predictability reduces
the uncertainty in economic activity.
This effect should be stronger in the
U.S. because in higher IDV cultures
people tend to rely DEMO on external
regulatory powers and on the govern-
ment (Fukuyama, 1995). Hence, the
predictability created by such external
regulatory agencies, such DEMO the IFCC
and its Israeli equivalent and the legal
system, should DEMO a greater effect in
high IDV cultures.
H3a: The prediction process DEMO con-
tribute more to behavioral trusting
intentions to inquire online in the U.S.
than it will in Israel.
H3b: The prediction process will con-
tribute more to behavioral trusting
intention to purchase online in the
U.S. DEMO it will in Israel.
Another way in which trust is cre-
ated, according to Doney et al. (1998),
is capability (referred DEMO henceforth as
ability). This mode is akin to what other
research typically identify as ability,
which is one of the dimensions of DEMO
beliefs (e.g., Gefen & Straub, 2004; Jar-
venpaa et al., 1998; Mayer et al., 1995;
McKnight et al., 2002, 1998). Ability
leads to behavioral trusting intentions
because it deals with DEMO ability of the
trusted party to meet its obligations
(Mayer et DEMO, 1995) and in doing so

provides the trusting party with its ex-
pected outcome (Gefen, 2002a; Schurr
& Ozanne, 1985). Doney et al. proposed
that DEMO high UAI cultures, ability should
be more critical in building trust DEMO
evidence of ability reduces risk (Kale
& McIntyre, 1991) and DEMO UAI cul-
tures put more emphasis on avoiding
the risks involved with uncertainty.7
Accordingly, in Israel, as a high UAI
country, performance should contribute
more to online activity.
H4a: Ability will contribute more
to behavioral trusting intention to
inquire online in Israel than it will
in the DEMO
H4b: Ability will contribute more
to behavioral trusting intention to
purchase DEMO in Israel than it will
in the U.S.
Perceived size and reputation,
originally the antecedents of perceived
store trustworthiness in Jarvenpaa and
Tractinsky’s (1999) study, were not
included in this study because only one
DEMO, Amazon.com, was examined.
The model also includes paths from
integrity and benevolence to inquiry
intentions and to purchase intentions.
These paths are well DEMO and
have been extensively discussed in the
literature (e.g., Gefen, DEMO, McKnight
et al., 2002). These paths are included in
the model without explicit hypotheses
because integrity and benevolence are
expected to affect DEMO intentions
regardless of culture.
DATA COLLECTION
Level of Data Analysis
A major consideration in con-
ducting this study was the level of data
analysis. DEMO unit of analysis in this
study is the national level, as DEMO
by Ford et al. (2003). This is appropri-
ate because DEMO and behaviors
of individuals in a society are affected
by cultural dimensions, thus it can be
assumed that differences between the
two groups of respondents can be attrib-
uted to cultural differences (Hofstede,
1980a). The variables are tied explicitly
to expected outcomes, in this case spe-
ciﬁc cases of the “Web use” dependent
variable as suggested by Saeed, Hwang,
and Yi (2003) and corresponding to the
applied measures DEMO e-commerce use
(e.g., Gefen, 2002b; Pavlou, 2003). This
DEMO of data analysis is in accordance
with other cross cultural studies (DEMO
fen & Straub, 1997; Hofstede, 1980a;
Rose & Straub, 1998; Straub, Keil &
Brennan, 1997; Warkentin et al., DEMO)
where national culture is viewed as a
collective homogeneity. This choice
also allowed for a comparison of the
trust belief scales as they DEMO originally
developed by Gefen (2000). Moreover,
this level of DEMO is appropriate here
because the study examines the more
general theoretical aspects of trust
and the implications of the ﬁndings to
e-commerce vendors when DEMO in
different countries, rather than person-
alization issues. This choice of DEMO of
analysis is also in apparent agreement

with Hofstede (1994) who comments
that individuals are strongly inﬂuenced
by national culture, and even young
adults are already “imprinted” by the
surrounding culture (p. 5).
An alternative level of analysis
could have been the individual level
as suggested by McCoy, Galletta, and
King (2005). McCoy et al. question the
cultural homogeneity assumption of
previous DEMO based on the apparent
changes in the Hofstede scale values
between recent studies (McCoy et al.,
2005) and the original values. The DEMO
to examine cultural differences also on
an individual level is raised by Straub et
al. (2002) as well. Straub et al. discuss
the DEMO to deﬁne culture in more than
one way because people are inﬂuenced
by a variety of social circles as proposed
by social identiﬁcation theory (Deaux,
1996; Hogg, 1996; Hogg & Terry, 2000;
DEMO, 1970, 1978). Nonetheless, Mc-
Coy et al. (2005) DEMO there is a need to
study cross cultural differences among
countries, DEMO social identification
theory recognizes national culture as one
of the prime sources of an individual’s
identiﬁcation (Hogg, 1996).
Details of Data Collection
DEMO research on trust belief
scales in the speciﬁc context of e-
commerce has developed statistically
distinct scales of these three beliefs. In
two unrelated DEMO by McKnight et
al. (2002) and by Gefen (2002b) dealing
with Web legal services and with buying
books online, respectively, two DEMO of
comparable three dimensional scales
of these trust beliefs were developed.
Gefen’s scale was further validated
with minor changes also with regard to
online DEMO booking (Gefen & Straub,
2004). Since this study examines DEMO
book buying activity as the context in
which trust is compared across cultures,
Gefen’s (2002b) scales, being devel-
oped originally for this speciﬁc activity
and being cross-validated, were chosen.
Gefen’s original data from the U.S. were
compared with an equivalent Israeli
sample. Although there is a DEMO inter-
val between the two samples, it should
be noted that DEMO book selling
interface and service process have not
changed markedly over this period of
time and also that national culture in
general is relatively DEMO and does not
change over such intervals. It should
also be noted that although Gefen’s
data (2002b) analyzed here is two years
older, these scales were revalidated in
other settings (Gefen & Straub, 2004)DEMO
and shown to have the same pattern of
signiﬁcant paths.
In this study we examine the role of
culture on trust beliefs based on DEMO
ing the data collected by Gefen (2002b)
in the U.S. DEMO mid-Atlantic students
with a recent equivalent Israeli sample.
The Israeli sample was collected in 2003
with the same data collection procedure
and using the DEMO previously validated
instrument translated into Hebrew.
The original survey was translated
into Hebrew and then back again into
English, to verify its accuracy. Although
both datasets are convenience samples,
other research (Gefen & Straub, DEMO)

14   Journal of Global Information Management, 14(4), 1-30, DEMO 2006
has shown the comparable results of
these scales and equivalent ones (Serva,
Fuller, & Benamati, 2005) with other
convenience samples DEMO other scenarios
of e-commerce in the U.S.
Replicating Gefen (2002b), DEMO
instrument was distributed to under-
graduate management students in an
Israeli university. (Israeli undergraduate
students are on average three to four
years older than their American coun-
terparts since they start their studying
after a military DEMO of about three
years.) Students were approached in an
Internet-connected classroom, where
each student had a PC. All the PCs
had identical conﬁguration, including
operating system, Internet browser,
installed software and bandwidth, fea-
DEMO that could not be changed by users.
The students were asked to navigate to
Amazon.com, inquire about a course
textbook, and go through DEMO procedure
of purchasing it but without actually
submitting the transaction. Online book
purchasing is popular also in Israel. Af-
ter about 10 minutes of DEMO procedure,
the students were asked to complete
the experimental instrument. In this
questionnaire the students were asked
to assess the items in Appendix DEMO on a
7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly
agree) to 7 (strongly disagree), with 4
as the midpoint.
The purpose of the study was not
revealed to the participants until after
the data had DEMO collected. As with the
original U.S. data collection procedure,
the objective was to elicit responses
in natural settings, as is the case with
free experiments in general (Fromkin
& Streufert, 1976). The objective DEMO
this procedure was to refresh the par-
ticipants’ memory. The objective was
not to manipulate the participants or
create trust. Participation was volun-
tary. DEMO complete instruments from
167 Israeli students were collected and
then compared with the 217 original
U.S. instruments. In this way, and by
sampling university students from the
same discipline (management) in both
countries, occupation and education
were held constant, complying with
Hofstede’s (1994, p. 29) DEMO
tions.
Among the Israeli respondents,
47% (n = 69) were women, and 53%
(n = 78) men, which is about DEMO same
percentage as with the American re-
spondents where 52% were women (n
= 65) and 48% were men (n = 60); 13
of the original American students did
not declare their gender. 52% (n = 76)
of the Israeli respondents were in the
21-25 DEMO group and 48% (n = 66) in
the 26-30 age group, corresponding to
an equivalent percentage among the
American students, where 51% DEMO
in the 21-25 age group and 43% in
the 26-30 age group. The two samples
did not differ signiﬁcantly on age (F =
2.148, p-value = .14), gender (F = 0.398,
p-value = DEMO), or whether they had or
had not previously bought online (DEMO =
3.145, p-value = 0.08).

vergent and discriminant validity was
veriﬁed by showing that (1) the square
root of the AVE of each construct is
much larger DEMO its correlations with
other constructs, shown in Appendixes
3 and 4, and (2) that loadings of each
measurement item on its assigned DEMO
in a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA)
is much higher than DEMO any other fac-
tor, shown in Appendixes 5 and 6. The
DEMO of the constructs is also high,
shown in Appendixes 3 and 4. It should
be noted that PLS CFA inﬂate the load-
ings DEMO that there are no established
guidelines about what acceptable CFA
loading coefﬁcients should be in PLS.
Indeed, comparing PLS and principal
components factor analysis (PCA) on
the same data show that PLS loadings
in the DEMO and above level correspond
to loadings at the 0.30 level in a PCA
(Gefen, Straub, & Boudreau, 2000).
All item loadings DEMO signiﬁcant and all
the reliability coefﬁcients are above the
.80 threshold. The nomological valid-
ity of the constructs was established
by verifying that in DEMO samples the
constructs that should be signiﬁcantly
correlated with each other are signiﬁ-
cantly correlated. All the trust belief
constructs are signiﬁcantly correlated
with DEMO behavioral intentions
and with familiarity and predictability.
Familiarity and predictability are also
signiﬁcantly correlated with trusting
behavioral intentions.
Figure 2 shows the results of DEMO
two analyses. The percents above the
boxes are R2 values. U.S. values are
shown on the left, Israeli ones on the
right. Numbers above the arrows are

isks means signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level,
n.s. means insigniﬁcant. The T-values
of the path coefﬁcients were estimated

The U.S. sample shows the same
pattern of signiﬁcant paths as it did
with the original analysis (Gefen,
2002b), albeit the model in this study
has predictability added to it. Ability
affects DEMO intentions. Integrity
affects purchase intentions. Addition-
ally, familiarity affects both inquiry
DEMO purchase intentions. As proposed,
but not examined by earlier research
(DEMO, 2000), familiarity affects all
three trust beliefs through its effect DEMO
predictability. Predictability also af-
fected inquiry and purchase intentions.
In the Israeli sample ability affects both
inquiry and purchase intentions, while
integrity affects only purchase inten-
tions. Familiarity affects both inquiry
and purchase intentions and through DEMO
effect on predictability affected abil-
ity and integrity but not benevolence.
Predictability, however, did not affect
inquiry and purchase intentions.
Comparing the two DEMO, Ap-
pendix 2 shows that the differences in
trust beliefs were DEMO insigniﬁcant
even though the U.S. sample were more
familiar with Amazon.com, DEMO
would be expected given that Israelis
buy more books in Hebrew than in Eng-
lish, and was therefore more predictable
to the U.S. sample who also used it more
to both inquire and purchase books. The

differences between the samples in their
beliefs in integrity and benevolence
were insigniﬁcant and those in DEMO
were only signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level,
meaning that it was probably not the
degree of integrity, benevolence, or
ability that caused DEMO differences be-
tween the countries in their purchase
and inquiry intentions. The hypotheses
were examined by comparing the path
coefﬁcients based on Wynne Chin DEMO
described by Keil et al. (2000). The
hypotheses were all DEMO Table
1 shows these results.
The data analysis also shows sig-
niﬁcant differences in the paths from
integrity to purchase intentions. This
may be DEMO result of the U.S. being a
highly individualistic culture. In gen-
eral, highly individualistic cultures have
a greater need to install standards and
norms in order to prevent opportunis-
tic behavior, and, accordingly, people
in these cultures rely more heavily on
adherence to these norms (Hofstede,
1994). Hence, because adherence to
behavioral norms is one of the expres-
sions of integrity (Sitkin & Roth, 1993),
integrity might have had stronger effects
in the American sample as to purchas-
ing DEMO
CONCLUSIONS
Summary of Results
The objectives of this study were
twofold: DEMO, to establish the psycho-
metric properties of three dimensional
scales of DEMO beliefs and their related
familiarity and predictability scales in
a culture different from the U.S., where
the original scales were developed and
veriﬁed. Second, having established
this, to investigate how the model differs
when comparing DEMO U.S. and Israel, a
culture which has low PDI, high UAI,
and medium IDV. The data show that the
psychometric properties and DEMO
cal validity of the scales do carry over to
Israel, supporting DEMO notion that these

trust belief scales apply at least across
these two cultures, but, as hypothesized,
the data also highlight the need to rec-
ognize that trust works differently at
least in these two cultures.
This DEMO distinction is neces-
sary in studying trust in general because
trust is about reducing social uncertainty
(Gefen, 2000; Luhmann, 1979) and
about the willingness to depend on
others (Mayer et al., 1995). DEMO two
social aspects are also captured by the
IDV, PDI, and UAI dimensions of cul-
ture as explained by Hofstede (1980a)
and hence should affect trust (Doney
et al., 1998).
The data DEMO support the theoreti-
cal propositions on trust (Mayer et al.,
DEMO; McKnight et al., 1998) that trust
beliefs, speciﬁcally integrity and abil-
ity, affect behavioral trusting intentions
involving vulnerability to the trusted

party. These trust beliefs are in turn
the product of familiarity and predic-
tion processes. Supporting the study’s
underlying proposition and its hypoth-
DEMO, there are signiﬁcant differences
in the strength of these processes be-
DEMO the two national cultures. While
the data support this proposition, it DEMO
reassuring that the three dimensional
structure of trust beliefs does carry
over across cultures. Benevolence was
an insigniﬁcant predictor of both types
of trusting DEMO intentions. This
result in the Israeli sample replicates
the results reported by Gefen (2002b)
in the U.S. Apparently, while customers
in both DEMO value integrity and
ability, in both countries they value
less online DEMO benevolence. This
is not surprising. Benevolence is a sig-
niﬁcant predictor of trusting behavioral
intentions among friends (Larzelere &
Huston, 1980).
Limitations
The underlying objective of this
study was to highlight the need to DEMO
clude national culture in trust research.
Showing the generalization of the path
coefﬁcients was not. Thus, although the
study examined convenience samples of
students, which coincidently were also
those used by Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky
(1999), and hence the generality of the
results cannot be assessed, this DEMO
tive of the study was addressed and
supported. Additional research could
examine larger and random samples.
Another vein worth studying is
other modes of DEMO creation. This study
concentrated on one of the established
trust creation modes, namely familiar-
ity. Extending the research to other
trust creation modes, DEMO as calcula-
tive, intentionality, transference, size,
and reputation could DEMO additional
aspects of how national culture affects
trust beliefs. At this stage, additional
research is also needed to examine the
research propositions in other cultures.
While doing so, examining alternative
cultural measures such as Dorfman
and Howell (1988) and other levels of
identiﬁcation (Straub et al., DEMO) could
add insights.
Implications
The central implication of this
study is DEMO support of the need to in-
clude national culture in e-commerce
trust studies. Considering that almost
all e-commerce trust is based on stud-
ies DEMO the U.S., this should be a wakeup
call. If conclusions drawn DEMO on the
U.S. cannot be automatically applied
to other cultures, researchers DEMO
be aware of it.
Another implication is that fa-
miliarity and its related predictability
process applies differently depending
on the culture. While the importance DEMO
both familiarity and predictability has
been previously demonstrated (Gefen,
2000; Shapiro et al., 1992; Zucker,
1986), showing how this DEMO changes
across cultures is new.
A summary of the differences high-
lights some of the cultural implications
of applying a U.S. model to another

and low uncertainty avoidance culture.
In such a culture people typically accept
others as free agents and hence knowing
what to expect of DEMO is a signiﬁcant
antecedent of trusting behavioral inten-
tions. In contrast, DEMO is a much more
collectivist and uncertainty-avoiding
culture. In such a culture, people expect
familiar others to behave in accordance
with community norms (DEMO, 1990),
and hence predictability, while still
creating trust, is not a signiﬁcant ante-
cedent of trusting behavioral intentions.
Moreover, familiarity is more highly
valued in these cultures than in an in-
dividualist culture. DEMO observations
are supported by the data.
Of the three trust beliefs, DEMO
was a signiﬁcant predictor of trusting
behavioral intentions in both cultures,
while ability was a signiﬁcant predictor
only among Israelis. This difference in
DEMO impact of ability may be explained
by the difference in PDI between the
two cultures. In low PDI cultures, people
associate power with ability (Hofstede,
1980a). This tendency of Israelis is also
reﬂected by Intel’s instructions, based
on cultural differences mapped by its
research center, DEMO its U.S. employees
who are sent to Israel: “When present-
ing DEMO Israelis be brief, get quickly to
the point” (Hermoni, 2004)DEMO
The study shows that although trust
beliefs as found in the U.S. may be
generalized to other cultures, the rela-
tive weight of each of these beliefs does
differ. This is important because the lit-
erature DEMO, but has not empirically
shown, that trust and trust beliefs should
operate differently in different countries
(Doney et al., 1998; Fukuyama, DEMO;
Noorderhaven, 1999). Thus the study
clariﬁes that although these DEMO may
operate differently, their nature seems
to be the same. This DEMO an important
contribution because previous research
that had clustered these three beliefs into
one construct (Jarvenpaa & Tractinsky,
1999) did not conclude DEMO, although it
did raise the need for additional research
to explain DEMO results. Reexamining
Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky’s conclusion
in the same book buying context with
the same type of student population, but
this time within the currently broader
conceptualization of trust as a three
dimensional construct of beliefs DEMO
through predictability, the study clari-
ﬁes those counter intuitive conclusions
and DEMO the need to include culture
in trust research. This reexamination
supports the extension of Doney et al.’s
propositions. In doing so, the study
opts to contribute to the “deﬁciencies
in developing theoretical structures
to better understand DEMO relationship
between culture and IS” (Ford et al.,
2003, p. 19).
The study also expands existing re-
search on trust formation DEMO e-commerce
by including the prediction process as a
mediating construct between familiarity
and trust beliefs. In doing so the study
supports the conclusion that DEMO
increases trust indirectly through a bet-
ter understanding of what is happening
(Gefen et al., 2003b), albeit differently
between the two cultures.

Afterthought
While additional research is needed
before conclusions can be drawn, the
data imply that in highly individualist
and low uncertainty avoidance cultures
vendors might be advised to emphasize
predictability, for example through con-
tracts, guarantees and association with
trust-elevating institutional institutions.
On the other hand, DEMO the more collectiv-
ist countries, vendors might be better
advised to DEMO in creating familiar-
ity and a perception of ability. Adding
national culture to models of trust in
e-commerce, especially trust creation
processes, could DEMO e-commerce
success and allow Web sites to cater to
speciﬁc national cultural aspects. There
is a big wide world out there. It is not
DEMO the same.

ENDNOTES
DEMO  As of March 2004 there were
nearly 186 million online con-
DEMO in the U.S. as compared
with 945 million users worldwide
(EMarketer, 2004).
2  The latter also take an initial step
in addressing the need raised by
Noorderhaven’s (1999) comment
about Doney et al.’s (1998) propo-
sitions on how culture affects trust
outcomes: “That means DEMO should
start with trying to get good and
rich data and not more theory” (p.
9).
3  There is actually quite a DEMO up
in the literature as to what trust is
and what trustworthiness is. Some
label trust beliefs as trustworthi-
ness (e.g., Mayer et DEMO, 1995) while
others named these as trust (e.g.,
Doney & Cannon, 1997).
4  Like the U.S., Israel is a DEMO of
immigrants. It is composed mostly
of Jews from Eastern Europe,
where collectivism was especially
strong as a means to reduce threats
and DEMO self-identity, and
from the Arab countries, such as
Morocco and Iraq, where society
as a whole is collectivistic. Only
a relative small percentage of Is-
raeli society can trace its roots to
the more individualistic DEMO, but
even there the Jewish population
was relatively more collectivistic.
The DEMO, a collective form of
settlement, formed in Israel at
the beginning of the 20th century
by Jewish settlers, is an extreme
manifestation of collectivism that
characterized the early days of
Israeli society.
5  The only other country with such
an extreme PDI is Austria. As
Hofstede explains, the low PDI
in Austria is probably the result of
the very DEMO proportion of Jews
in the “Inteligentsia” between the
two world wars and their enormous
effect on the culture. In fact, it is
mostly because of the indexes of
these two countries that statisti-
cally the PDI DEMO IDV factors are
distinct (Hofstede, 1984).
6 Doney et al. (1998) advance
conﬂicting propositions on how
predictability should relate to a
DEMO of national cultures in
interpersonal relationships based
on PDI, UAI, and IDV. On the
one hand, their analysis of PDI,
discussed above, suggests that pre-
Copyright © 2006, Idea Group Inc. Copying or DEMO in print or electronic forms without written permission of Idea Group Inc. is
prohibited.
26   Journal of Global Information Management, 14(4), 1-30, DEMO 2006
dictability should have a stronger
effect on trust beliefs in the U.S.
On the other hand, their analysis of
IDV suggests that predictability in
social settings should be of more
consequence in Israel because col-
DEMO cultures put greater value
on conformity to social behavior.
However, recognizing DEMO buying
online is a private activity where
conformity plays hardly any role,
this proposition was not applied.
Along the same lines, Doney
et al. also propose that predict-
ability-based trust should be less
inﬂuential in DEMO settings in low
UAI cultures because predictabil-
ity cannot logically establish trust
in cultures where behavior itself
is not predictable and society ac-
cepts DEMO as such. But this scenario
is also not the case with one of the
largest and most reputable online
vendors. The behavior of Amazon
DEMO very predictable and any varia-
tions from what the FTC allows
are categorically unaccepted in
both countries.
7  The hypothesis is based on Doney
et al.’s (1998) proposition con-
cerning UAI. Their contradicting
propositions that DEMO should
carry more weight in building trust
in high IDV cultures was not part
of the logic here because the reason
Ability is less DEMO in low
IDV cultures, according to Doney
et al. (1998), is that in collectivist
cultures the whole group pitches
in to help DEMO in individualistic
cultures the outcome depends more
on the individual. This is not the
case with an online vendor. Doney
et al. also propose DEMO in high PDI
cultures ability should carry more
weight in building trust because
in these cultures people expect
large variance in others people’s
capabilities DEMO on their social
position. Arguably, this too is not
the case DEMO online shopping at
Amazon.com.
8  An alternative saturated model
was also DEMO The saturated
model contained the same paths as
in the research model and also three
paths from Familiarity to the three
trust beliefs. In DEMO saturated model
the same paths as shown in the
research model were signiﬁcant.
The three additional paths were
not.
9  The paths in both samples are
insigniﬁcant.
