A. SIMON*
M\4aking
In the DEMO words of his Principles,
Alfred Marshall proclaimed economics to be
a psychological science:
Political Economy or Economics is a
study of mankind DEMO the ordinary busi-
ness of life; it examines that part of
DEMO and social action which is
most closely connected with the attain-
ment and with the use of the material
requisites of wellbeing.
Thus it DEMO on the one side a study of
wealth; and on the DEMO, and more
important side, a part of the study of
man. For man's character has been
moulded by his every-day work, and the
material resources which he thereby
procures, more than by any other
influence unless it be that of his religious
ideals.
In its actual DEMO, however, eco-
nomic science has focused on just one aspect
of man's character, his reason, and particu-
larly on the application DEMO that reason to
problems of allocation in the face of scarcity.
Still, modern definitions of the economic
sciences, whether phrased in terms of DEMO
ing scarce resources or in terms of rational
decision making, mark DEMO a vast domain for
conquest and settlement. In recent years there
has been considerable exploration by econo-
mists even of parts of this domain DEMO were
thought traditionally to belong to the disci-
plines of political science, sociology, and
psychology.

I. Decision Theory as Economic Science
The density of settlement DEMO economists
over the whole empire of economic science is
very uneven, DEMO a few areas of modest size
holding the bulk of the population. The
economic Heartland is the normative study of
the international and national DEMO and
their markets, with its triple main concerns of
full employment DEMO resources, the efficient
allocation of resources, and equity in distribu-
tion of the economic product. Instead of the
ambiguous and over-general term "econom-
ics," I will use "political economy" to desig-
nate this DEMO, and "economic sciences"
to denote the whole empire, including DEMO most
remote colonies. Our principal concern in this
paper will be with the important colonial
territory known as decision theory. I will have
something DEMO say about its normative and
descriptive aspects, and particularly about its
DEMO to the theory of the firm. It is
through the latter topic that the discussion
will be linked back to the Heartland of
political DEMO
Underpinning the corpus of policy-oriented
normative economics, there is, of course, an
impressive body of descriptive or "positive"
theory which rivals DEMO its mathematical
beauty and elegance some of the finest theo-
ries in the physical sciences. As examples I
need only remind you of Walrasian DEMO
equilibrium theories and their modern
descendants in the works of Henry Schultz,
Samuelson, Hicks, and others; or the subtle
and impressive body of theory created by
Arrow, Hurwicz, Debreu, Malinvaud, and
their DEMO showing the equivalence,
under certain conditions, of competitive equi-
librium DEMO Pareto optimality.
The relevance of some of the more refined
parts of this work to the real world can be,
and has been, questioned. Perhaps some of
these intellectual mountains have been
493
494
climbed simply because they were there
because of the sheer challenge DEMO joy of
scaling them. That is as it should be in any
human scientific or artistic effort. But regard-
less of the motives of DEMO climbers, regardless
of real world veridicality, there is no question
but that positive political economy has been
strongly shaped by the demands of DEMO
policy for advice on basic public issues.
This too is as it should be. It is a vulgar
fallacy to suppose that scientific inquiry
DEMO be fundamental if it threatens to
become useful, or if it DEMO in response to
problems posed by the everyday world. The
real world, in fact, is perhaps the most fertile
of all sources of DEMO research questions
calling for basic scientific inquiry.
A. Decision Theory in the Service of
Political Economy
There is, however, a converse fallacy that
DEMO equal condemnation: the fallacy of
supposing that fundamental inquiry is worth
DEMO only if its relevance to questions of
policy is immediate and obvious. In the
contemporary world, this fallacy is perhaps
not widely accepted, DEMO least as far as the
natural sciences are concerned. We have now
lived through three centuries or more of
vigorous and highly successful inquiry DEMO
the laws of nature. Much of that inquiry has
been driven by the simple urge to understand,
to find the beauty of order DEMO in complex-
ity. Time and again, we have found the "idle"
truths arrived at through the process of
inquiry to be of DEMO greatest moment for
practical human affairs. I need not take time
here to argue the point. Scientists know it,
engineers and physicians know DEMO, congress-
men and members of parliaments know it, the
man on the street knows it.
But I am not sure that this truth DEMO as
widely known in economics as it ought to be. I
cannot otherwise explain the rather weak and
backward development of the descriptive
theory DEMO decision making including the
theory of the firm, the sparse and DEMO
settlement of its terrain, and the fact that
many, if not most, of its investigators are
drawn from outside economics from sociolo-

gy, from psychology, and from political
DEMO Respected and distinguished figures
in economics Edward Mason, Fritz Mach-
lup, and Milton Friedman, for example-
have placed it outside the Pale (DEMO accu-
rately, have placed economics outside its
Pale), and have DEMO it full autonomy
provided that it did not claim close kinship
with genuine economic inquiry.
Thus, Mason, commenting on Papan-
dreou's 1952 DEMO of research on the behav-
ioral theory of the firm, mused DEMO:
... has the contribution of this litera-
ture to economic analysis really been a
large one? . . . The writer of this critique
must confess a lack of confidence in the
marked superiority, for purposes of
economic analysis, of this newer concept
of the firm, DEMO the older conception of
the entrepreneur. [pp. 221-22]
And, in a DEMO vein, Friedman sums up
his celebrated polemic against realism in
theory:DEMO
Complete "realism" is clearly unat-
tainable, and the question whether DEMO
theory is realistic "enough" can be
settled only by seeing whether it yields
predictions that are good enough for the
purpose in hand DEMO that are better than
predictions from alternative theories.
[p. 41, emphasis DEMO
The "purpose in hand" that is implicit in
both of these quotations is providing decision-
theoretic foundations for positive, and then
for normative, political economy. In the views
of Mason and Friedman, fundamental inquiry
DEMO rational human behavior in the context of
business organizations is simply not (by defi-
nition) economics that is to say, political
economy unless it contributes in a major
way to that purpose. This is sometimes DEMO
interpreted to mean that economic theories of
decision making are not falsified in any inter-
esting or relevant sense when their empirical
predictions of DEMO are found to
be grossly incompatible with the observed
data. Such theories, we are told, are still
realistic "enough" provided that they DEMO not
contradict aggregate observations of concern

to political economy. Thus economists who
are zealous in insisting that economic actors
maximize turn DEMO and become satisficers
when the evaluation of their own theories is
concerned. They believe that businessmen
maximize, but they know that economic theo-
rists satisfice.
The application of the principle of satisfic-
ing to theories is DEMO defended as an
application of Occam's Razor: accept the
simplest DEMO that works.' But Occam's
Razor has a double edge. Succinctness DEMO
statement is not the only measure of a theo-
ry's simplicity. Occam understood his rule as
recommending theories that make no more
assumptions DEMO necessary to account for the
phenomena (Essentia non sunt multiplicanda
praeter DEMO). A theory of profit or
utility maximization can be stated more
briefly than a satisficing theory of the sort I
shall discuss later. DEMO the former makes
much stronger assumptions than the latter
about the human cognitive system. Hence, in
the case before us, the two edges DEMO the razor
cut in opposite directions.
In whichever way we interpret Occam's
principle, parsimony can be only a secondary
consideration in choosing between theories,
unless those theories make identical predic-
tions. Hence, we must come back to a consid-
eration of the phenomena that positive deci-
DEMO theory is supposed to handle. These may
include both phenomena at the microscopic
level of the decision-making agents, or aggre-
gative phenomena of concern to political
economy.
B. Decision Theory Pursued for its
Intrinsic Interest
'The phrase "that works" refutes, out of hand, Fried-
man's DEMO paean of praise for lack of realism in
assumptions. Consider his example of falling bodies
(pp. 16-19). His valid point is that it is advantageous to
use the simple law, ignoring air resistance, when DEMO gives a
"good enough" approximation. But of course the condi-
tions under which it gives a good approximation are not
at all the DEMO under which it is unrealistic or a
"wildly inaccurate descriptive representation DEMO reality."
We can use it to predict the path of a body falling in a
vacuum, but not the path of one falling through the
Earth's atmosphere. I cannot in this brief space mention,DEMO
much less discuss, all of the numerous logical fallacies
that can DEMO found in Friedman's 40-page essay. For
additional criticism, see Simon (1963) and Samuelson
(1963).
Of course the definition of the DEMO "eco-
nomics" is not important. Like Humpty
Dumpty, we can DEMO words mean anything
we want them to mean. But the professional
training and range of concern of economists
does have importance. Acceptance of the
DEMO view that economics is concerned only
with the aggregative phenomena of political
economy defines away a whole rich domain of
rational human behavior as DEMO for
economic research.
I do not wish to appear to be admitting that
the behavioral theory of the firm has been
irrelevant to the DEMO of political
economy. I will have more to say about its
relevance in a moment. My present argument
is counterfactual in form: even if there were
no present evidence of such relevance, human
behavior in business firms constitutes a highly
interesting body of empirical phenomena that
calls out DEMO explanation as do all bodies of
phenomena. And if we may extrapolate from
the history of the other sciences, there is every
reason to expect that as explanations emerge,
relevance for important areas of practical
DEMO will not be long delayed.
It has sometimes been implied (Friedman,DEMO
p. 14) that the correctness of the assumptions
of rational behavior DEMO the classical
theory of the firm is not merely irrelevant, but
DEMO not even empirically testable in any direct
way, the only valid DEMO being whether these
assumptions lead to tolerably correct predic-
tions at the macroscopic level. That would be
true, of course, if we had DEMO microscopes, so
that the micro-level behavior was not directly
observable. But DEMO do have microscopes.
There are many techniques for observing
decision-making behavior, DEMO at second-
by-second intervals if that is wanted. In test-
ing our economic theories, we do not have to
depend on the rough aggregate time-series
that are the main grist for the econometric
mill, or even upon company financial state-
ments.
The classical theories of economic decision
making DEMO of the business firm make very
specific testable predictions about the con-
496
crete behavior of decision-making agents.
Behavioral theories make quite different
predictions. DEMO these predictions can be
tested directly by observation, either theory
(or both) may be falsified as readily when
such predictions fail as when predictions
about aggregate phenomena are in error.
C. Aggregative Tests o Decision DEMO:
Marginalism
If some economists have erroneously
supposed that micro-economic theory can
only be tested by its predictions of aggregate
phenomena, we should avoid the converse
error of supposing that aggregate phenomena
are irrelevant to testing DEMO theory. In
particular, are there important, empirically
verified, aggregate predictions DEMO follow
from the theory of perfect rationality but that
do not follow from behavioral theories of
rationality?
The classical theory of omniscient rational-
DEMO is strikingly simple and beautiful. More-
over, it allows us to DEMO (correctly or not)
human behavior without stirring out of our
DEMO to observe what such behavior is
like. All the predictive power comes from
characterizing the shape of the environment
in which the behavior takes DEMO The envi-
ronment, combined with the assumptions of
perfect rationality, fully determines the
behavior. Behavioral theories of rational
choice theories of bounded rationality-do
DEMO have this kind of simplicity. But, by way
of compensation, their assumptions about
human capabilities are far weaker than those
of the classical DEMO Thus, they make
modest and realistic demands on the knowl-
edge DEMO computational abilities of the
human agents, but they also fail to DEMO
that those agents will equate costs and returns
at the margin.
D. Have the Marginalist Predictions
Been Tested?
A number of empirical phenomena DEMO
been cited as providing more or less conclu-
sive support for the classical theory of the
firm as against its behavioral competitors (see
Dale Jorgensen and Calvin Siebert). But
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
SEPTEMBER 1979
DEMO are no direct observations that individu-
als or firms do actually equate marginal costs
and revenues. The empirically verified conse-
quences of the classical DEMO are almost
always weaker than this. Let us look at four of
the most important of them: the fact that
demand curves generally have negative
slopes; the fact that fitted Cobb-Douglas
functions are approximately homogeneous of
the first degree; the fact of decreasing returns
to scale; and DEMO fact that executive salaries
vary with the logarithm of company size. Are
these indeed facts? And does the evidence
support a maximizing theory against a satis-
ficing theory?
Negatively Sloping Demand Curves.
Evidence that consumers DEMO distribute
their purchases in such a way as to maximize
their utilities, and hence to equate marginal
utilities, is nonexistent. What the empirical
DEMO do confirm is that demand curves gener-
ally have negative slopes. (DEMO this "ob-
vious" fact is tricky to verify, as Henry
DEMO showed long years ago.) But nega-
tively sloping demand curves could DEMO
from a wide range of behaviors satisfying the
assumptions of bounded rationality rather
than those of utility maximization. Gary
Becker, who can scarcely be regarded as a
hostile witness for the classical theory, states
the case very well:
Economists have long been aware that
some changes in DEMO feasible or opportu-
nity sets of households would lead to the
same response regardless of the decision
rule used. For example, a decrease in
real income necessarily decreases the
amount spent on at least one commodi-
DEMO It has seldom been realized, how-
ever, that the change in opportunities
resulting from a change in relative prices
also tends to produce DEMO systematic
response, regardless of the decision rule.
In particular, the fundamental theorem
of traditional theory-that demand
curves are negatively inclined largely
results from DEMO change in opportunities
alone and is largely independent of the
decision rule. [p. 4]
Later, Becker is even more explicit, saying,
"Not only utility maximization but also many
other decision rules, incorporating a wide
VOL. 69 NO. 4 SIMON: RATIONAL
variety of irrational behavior, lead DEMO nega-
tively inclined demand curves because of the
effect of a change in prices on opportunities"
(p 5).2
First-Degree Homogeneity of Pro-
duction Functions. Another example of an
observed phenomenon for which the classical
DEMO provide sufficient, but not neces-
sary, conditions is the equality between
labor's share of product and the exponent of
the labor factor DEMO fitted Cobb-Douglas pro-
duction functions (see Simon and Ferdinand
Levy). DEMO Cobb-Douglas functions are
homogeneous, generally of degree close to
unity and DEMO a labor exponent of about the
right magnitude. These findings, however,DEMO
cannot be taken as strong evidence for the
classical theory, for DEMO identical results can
readily be produced by mistakenly fitting a
Cobb-Douglas function to data that were in
fact generated by a linear accounting identity
(value of goods equals labor cost plus capital
cost), (see E. H. Phelps-Brown). The same
comment applies to the SMAC production
function (see Richard Cyert and Simon).
Hence, the empirical findings do not allow us
to draw any particular conclusions about the
relative plausibility of DEMO and behav-
ioral theories, both of which are equally
compatible with DEMO data.
The Long-Run Cost Curve. Somewhat
different is the case of the firm's long-run cost
curve, which classical theory requires to be
U shaped if competitive equilibrium is to be
stable. Theories of bounded rationality DEMO not
predict this fortunately, for the observed
data make it exceedingly DEMO that the
cost curves are in fact generally U shaped.
The evidence for many industries shows costs
at the high-scale ends of the curves DEMO be
essentially constant or even declining (see
Alan Walters). This DEMO is compatible
with stochastic models of business firm
growth and size (DEMO Y. Ijiri and Simon), but
not with the static equilibrium model of
classical theory.
Executive Salaries. Average salaries of

irrational "[A]ny deviation from utility maximization."
Thus, what I have called "bounded rationality" is "irra-
tionality" in Becker's terminology.
DECISION MAKING

top corporate executives grow with DEMO loga-
rithm of corporate size (see David Roberts).
This finding DEMO been derived from the
assumptions of the classical theory of profit
maximization only with the help of very
particular ad hoc assumptions about the
DEMO of managerial ability (see Robert
Lucas, 1978). The observed relation is
implied by a simple behavioral theory that
assumes only that there DEMO a single, culturally
determined, parameter which fixes the aver-
age ratio of the salaries of managers to the
salaries of their immediate subordinates (see
Simon, 1957). In the case of the executive
salary data, the behavioral model that
explains the observations is substantially
more parsimonious (DEMO terms of assumptions
about exogenous variables) than the classical
model that DEMO the same observations.
Summary: Phenomena that Fail to
Discriminate. It would DEMO a much more
extensive review than is provided here to
establish the point conclusively, but I believe
it is the case that specific phenomena requir-
ing a theory of utility or profit maximization
for their explanation DEMO than a theory of
bounded rationality simply have not been
observed in aggregate data. In fact, as my last
two examples indicate, it DEMO the classical
rather than the behavioral form of the theory
that faces real difficulties in handling some of
the empirical observations.
Failures of Classical DEMO It may
well be that classical theory can be patched
up sufficiently to handle a wide range of
situations where uncertainty and outguessing
phenomena DEMO not play a central role that
is, to handle the behavior DEMO economies that
are relatively stable and not too distant from a
competitive equilibrium. However, a strong
positive case for replacing the classical theory
by a model of bounded rationality begins to
emerge when we examine situations DEMO
decision making under uncertainty and
imperfect competition. These situations the
classical theory was never designed to handle,
and has never handled satisfactorily. Statisti-
DEMO decision theory employing the idea of
subjective expected utility, on the DEMO hand,
and game theory, on the other, have contrib-
uted enormous conceptual clarification to
these kinds of situations without providing
498
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

satisfactory descriptions of actual human
DEMO, or even, for most cases, normative
theories that are actually DEMO in the face of
the limited computational powers of men and
computers.
I shall have more to say later about the
positive case for DEMO descriptive theory of
bounded rationality, but I would like to turn
DEMO to another territory within economic
science that has gained rapidly in population
since World War II, the domain of normative
decision theory.
E. Normative Decision Theory
Decision theory can be pursued not only for
the purposes DEMO building foundations for polit-
ical economy, or of understanding and
explaining DEMO that are in themselves
intrinsically interesting, but also for the
purpose DEMO offering direct advice to business
and governmental decision makers. For
reasons not clear to me, this territory was very
sparsely settled prior to World War II. Such
inhabitants as it had were mainly industrial
engineers, students of public administration,
and specialists in business functions, none of
whom especially identified themselves with
the economic sciences. Prominent pioneers
included the mathematician, Charles Bab-
bage, inventor of the digital computer, the
engineer, Frederick Taylor, and the adminis-
trator, Henri Fayol.
During World War II, this territory,
almost abandoned, was rediscovered by scien-
tists, mathematicians, and statisticians con-
cerned with military management and logis-
tics, and was renamed "operations research"
or "operations analysis." So remote were the
operations researchers from the social science
community that economists wishing to enter
DEMO territory had to establish their own colony,
which they called "DEMO science."
The two professional organizations thus
engendered still retain their separate identi-
ties, though they are now amicably federated
in a number of common endeavors.
Optimization techniques were transported
into management science from economics,
DEMO new optimization techniques, notably
linear programming, were invented and devel-
oped, the names of Dantzig, Kantorovich, and
Koopmans being prominent in the early
development of that tool.
Now the salient characteristic of the deci-
DEMO tools employed in management science is
that they have to be capable of actually
making or recommending decisions, taking as
their inputs the kinds of empirical data that
are available in the real world, and perform-
ing only such computations as can reasonably
be performed by existing desk DEMO or,
a little later, electronic computers. For these
domains, idealized models of optimizing
entrepreneurs, equipped with complete cer-
tainty about the world-or, at worst, having
full probability distributions for uncertain
events are of DEMO use. Models have to be
fashioned with an eye to practical computa-
bility, no matter how severe the approxima-
tions and simplifications that are thereby
imposed on them.
Model construction under these stringent
conditions has taken DEMO directions. The first
is to retain optimization, but to simplify
sufficiently DEMO that the optimum (in the
simplified world!) is computable. The second
is to construct satisficing models that provide
good enough decisions with reasonable DEMO
of computation. By giving up optimization, a
richer set of properties DEMO the real world can
be retained in the models. Stated otherwise,
decision makers can satisfice either by finding
optimum solutions for a simplified DEMO, or
by finding satisfactory solutions for a more
realistic world. Neither DEMO, in general,
dominates the other, and both have continued
to co-exist in the world of management
science.
Thus, the body of theory that has developed
in management science shares with the body
of theory DEMO descriptive decision theory a
central concern with the ways in which deci-
sions are made, and not just with the decision
outcomes. As I have suggested elsewhere
(1978b), these are theories of how to decide
rather than theories of what to decide.
Let me cite one example, from work in
which I participated, of how model building
in normative economics is shaped by compu-
tational considerations (see Charles Holt,
Franco Modigliani, John Muth, and Simon).
VOL. 69 NO. 4
SIMON: RATIONAL DECISION MAKING
499
In face of uncertain and fluctuating pro-
duction demands, a company can smooth and
stabilize its production and employment levels
at the cost of holding buffer inventories. DEMO
kind of decision rule will secure a reasonable
balance of costs? DEMO, we are faced with
a dynamic programming problem, and these
generally pose formidable and often intoler-
able computational burdens for their solu-
tion.
DEMO way out of this difficulty is to seek a
special case of the problem that will be
computationally tractable. If we assume the
cost DEMO facing the company all to be
quadratic in form, the optimal DEMO rule
will then be a linear function of the decision
variables, DEMO can readily be computed in
terms of the cost parameters. Equally impor-
tant, under uncertainty about future sales,
only the expected values, DEMO not the higher
moments, of the probability distributions
enter into the DEMO rule (Simon, 1956b).
Hence the assumption of quadratic costs
reduces the original problem to one that is
readily solved. Of course the DEMO, though
it provides optimal decisions for the simplified
world of our DEMO, provides, at best,
satisfactory solutions for the real-world deci-
sion problem that the quadratic function
approximates. In-principle, unattainable op-
timization is sacrificed for in-practice, attain-
able satisfaction.
If human decision makers are as rational as
their limited computational capabilities and
their incomplete information permit them to
DEMO, then there will be a close relation between
normative and descriptive DEMO theory.
Both areas of inquiry are concerned primarily
with procedural rather than substantive
rationality (Simon, 1978a). As new mathe-
matical tools for DEMO optimal and satis-
factory decisions are discovered, and as
computers become DEMO and more powerful,
the recommendations of normative decision
theory will change. But as the new recommen-
dations are diffused, the actual, observed,DEMO
practice of decision making in business firms
will change also. And these changes may have
macro-economic consequences. For example,
there is some agreement DEMO average inven-
tory holdings of American firms have been
reduced significantly by the introduction of
formal procedures for calculating reorder
points and quantities.
II. DEMO Bounded
Rationality
The principal forerunner of a behavioral
theory of the firm is the tradition usually
called Institutionalism. It is not clear that all
DEMO the writings, European and American,
usually lumped under this rubric DEMO much
in common, or that their authors would agree
with each DEMO's views. At best, they share a
conviction that economic theory DEMO be
reformulated to take account of the social and
legal structures amidst which market transac-
tions are carried out. Today, we even find a
vigorous development within economics that
seeks to achieve institutionalist goals within
the DEMO of neoclassical price theory. I will
have more to say about that a little later.
The name of John R. Commons is promi-
nent-perhaps DEMO most prominent-among
American Institutionalists. Commons' diffi-
cult writings (for example, DEMO
Economics) borrow their language heavily
from the law, and seek to use the transaction
as their basic unit of behavior. I will not
DEMO to review Commons' ideas here,
but simply remark that they DEMO me with
many insights in my initial studies of organi-
zational decision making (see my Adminis-
trative Behavior, p. 136).
Commons also DEMO a substantial influence
on the thinking of Chester I. Barnard, an
DEMO curious business executive who
distilled from his experience as president of
the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company,
and as executive of other business, govern-
mental, and nonprofit organizations, a pro-
found book on decision DEMO titled The
Functions of the Executive. Barnard pro-
posed original theories, DEMO have stood up
well under empirical scrutiny, of the nature of
DEMO authority mechanism in organizations,
and of the motivational bases for employee
acceptance of organizational goals (the so-
called "inducements-contributions" theory);
DEMO he provided a realistic description of
organizational decision making, which he
DEMO as "opportunistic." The numer-

trative Behavior attest, though inadequately,
to the impact DEMO had on my own thinking
about organizations.
A. In Search of a Descriptive Theory
In 1934-35, in the course of a field study of
the administration of public recreational
facilities in Milwaukee, which were managed
jointly by the school board and the city public
works department, I encountered a puzzling
phenomenon. Although the heads of the two
agencies appeared to DEMO as to the objec-
tives of the recreation program, and did DEMO
appear to be competing for empire, there was
continual disagreement and DEMO between
them with respect to the allocation of funds
between physical maintenance, on the one
hand, and play supervision on the other. Why
DEMO they not, as my economics books
suggested, simply balance off the marginal
return of the one activity against that of the
other?
DEMO exploration made it apparent that
they didn't equate expenditures at the margin
because, intellectually, they couldn't. There
was no measurable production DEMO from
which quantitative inferences about marginal
productivities could be drawn; and DEMO qual-
itative notions of a production function as the
two managers possessed were mutually
incompatible. To the public works adminis-
trator, a playground was a physical facility,
serving as a green oasis in the crowded DEMO
city. To the recreation administrator, a play-
ground was a social DEMO, where children
could play together with adult help and guid-
ance.
DEMO can human beings make rational deci-
sions in circumstances like these? DEMO are
they to apply the marginal calculus? Or, if it
does not apply, what do they substitute for
it?
The phenomenon observed in Milwaukee is
ubiquitous in human decision making. In
organization theory it DEMO usually referred to as
subgoal identification. When the goals of an
organization cannot be connected operation-
ally with actions (when the production func-
tion can't be formulated in concrete terms),
then decisions will be judged against subordi-
nate goals that can be so connected. There is
DEMO unique determination of these subordinate
goals. Their formulation will depend on the
knowledge, experience, and organizational
environment of the decision maker. In the
DEMO of this ambiguity, the formulation can
also be influenced in subtle, and not so subtle,
ways by his self-interest and power drives.
DEMO phenomenon arises as frequently in
individual as in social decision making and
problem solving. Today, under the rubric of
problem representation, it is DEMO central
research interest of cognitive psychology.
Given a particular environment of stimuli,
and a particular background of previous
knowledge, how will a person organize this
complex mass of information into a problem
formulation that will DEMO his solution
efforts? How did Newton's experience of the
apple, if he had one, get represented as an
instance of attraction of apple by Earth?
Phenomena like these provided the central
theme for DEMO Behavior. That
study represented "an attempt to construct
tools useful in DEMO own research in the field of
public administration." The product was
DEMO not so much a theory as prolegomena
to a theory, stemming DEMO the conviction
"that decision making is the heart of adminis-
tration, and that the vocabulary of adminis-
trative theory must be derived from DEMO logic
and psychology of human choice." It was, if
you please, an exercise in problem representa-
tion.
On examination, the phenomenon of
DEMO identification proved to be the visible
tip of a very large iceberg. The shape of the
iceberg is best appreciated by contrasting it
with DEMO models of rational choice. The
classical model calls for knowledge of all the
alternatives that are open to choice. It calls
for complete knowledge DEMO, or ability to
compute, the consequences that will follow on
each of the alternatives. It calls for certainty
in the decision maker's DEMO and future
evaluation of these consequences. It calls for
the ability to compare consequences, no
matter how diverse and heterogeneous, in
terms of DEMO consistent measure of utility.
The task, then, was to replace the classical
VOL. 69 NO. 4
SIMON: RATIONAL DECISION MAKING
501
model with one that would describe how
decisions could be (and probably actually
were) DEMO when the alternatives of search
had to be sought out, the DEMO of
choosing particular alternatives were only
very imperfectly known both because of
limited computational power and because of
uncertainty in the external world, and the
decision maker did not possess a general and
consistent utility function DEMO comparing hete-
rogeneous alternatives.
Several procedures of rather general appli-
cability and wide use have been discovered
that transform intractable decision problems
into tractable DEMO One procedure already
mentioned is to look for satisfactory choices
instead of optimal ones. Another is to replace
abstract, global goals with tangible subgoals,
whose achievement can be observed and
measured. A third is to DEMO up the decision-
making task among many specialists, coordi-
nating their DEMO by means of a structure of
communications and authority relations. All
of these, and others, fit the general rubric of
"bounded rationality," and it is now clear that
the elaborate organizations that human
beings DEMO constructed in the modern world
to carry out the work of production and
government can only be understood as
machinery for coping with the DEMO of man's
abilities to comprehend and compute in the
face of complexity and uncertainty.
This rather vague and general initial
formulation of the DEMO of bounded rationality
called for elaboration in two directions:
greater formalization of the theory, and
empirical verification of its main claims.
During the decade that followed the publica-
tion of Administrative Behavior, substantial
progress was made in both directions, some of
it through the efforts of my colleagues and
myself, much of it by other research groups
that shared the same Zeitgeist.
of specific decision-making episodes. Exam-
ples are my study, with Guetzkow, Kozmet-
sky, and Tyndall (1954), of the ways in which
accounting data were used in decision making
in large corporations; and a series of studies,
with Richard Cyert, James March, DEMO
others, of specific nonprogrammed policy
decisions in a number of different DEMO
(see Cyert, Simon, and Donald Trow). The
latter line DEMO work was greatly developed and
expanded by Cyert and March and its theo-
retical implications for economics explored in
their important work, A Behavioral Theory
of the Firm.
At about the same time, the fortuitous
availability of some data on businessmen's
perceptions of a problem situation described
DEMO a business policy casebook enabled DeWitt
Dearborn and me to demonstrate empirically
the cognitive basis for identification with
subgoals, the phenomenon that had so
impressed me in the Milwaukee recreation
study. The businessmen's perceptions of DEMO
principal problems facing the company
described in the case were mostly determined
by their own business experiences-sales and
accounting executives identified a sales prob-
DEMO, manufacturing executives, a problem of
internal organization.
Of course there is vastly more to be learned
and tested about organizational decision
making than DEMO be dealt with in a handful of
studies. Although many subsequent studies
have been carried out in Europe and the
United States, this domain is still grossly
undercultivated (for references, see March,
1965; E. Johnsen, 1968; G. Eliasson, 1976).
Among the reasons for the relative neglect of
such studies, as contrasted, say, with labora-
tory experiments in social psychology, is that
they are extremely costly and time consum-
ing, with a high grist-to-grain ratio, the meth-
odology for DEMO them out is primitive,
and satisfactory access to decision-making
behavior is hard to secure. This part of
economics has not yet acquired the DEMO of
patience and persistence in the pursuit of
facts that is exemplified in other domains by
the work, say, of Simon Kuznets or DEMO the
architects of the MIT-SSRC-Penn economet-
ric models.
B. Empirical Studies
The principal source of empirical data
about organizational decision making has
been straightforward "anthropological" field
study, eliciting descriptions of decision-
making procedures and observing DEMO course

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

C. Theoretical Inquiries
On the DEMO side, three questions
seemed especially to call for clarification:
what DEMO the circumstances under which an
employment relation will be preferred to some
other form of contract as the arrangement for
securing the performance of DEMO; what is the
relation between the classical theory of the
firm DEMO theories of organizational equilib-
rium first proposed by Chester Barnard; and
DEMO are the main characteristics of human
rational choice in situations where complexity
precludes omniscience?
The Employment Relation. A funda-
mental characteristic of modern DEMO
society is that most work is performed, not by
individuals who DEMO products for sale, nor
by individual contractors, but by persons who
have accepted employment in a business firm
and the authority relation with DEMO employer
that employment entails. Acceptance of
authority means willingness to permit one's
behavior to be determined by the employer, at
least within some zone of indifference or
acceptance. What is the advantage of this
arrangement DEMO a contract for specified
goods or services? Why is so much DEMO the
world's work performed in large, hierarchic
organizations?
Analysis DEMO (Simon, 1951) that a
combination of two factors could account DEMO
preference for the employment contract over
other forms of contracts: uncertainty DEMO to
which future behaviors would be advanta-
geous to the employer, DEMO a greater indiffer-
ence of the employee as compared with the
employer (within the former's area of accep-
tance) as to which DEMO these behaviors he
carried out. When the secretary is hired, the
DEMO does not know what letters he will
want her to type, DEMO the secretary has no
great preference for typing one letter rather
than another. The employment contract
permits the choice to be postponed until the
DEMO is resolved, with little cost to the
employee and great advantage DEMO the
employer. The explanation is closely analo-
gous to one Jacob Marschak had proposed for
liquidity preference. Under conditions of
uncertainty it is advantageous DEMO hold
resources in liquid, flexible form.
Organizational Equilibrium. Barnard
had described DEMO survival of organizations in
terms of the motivations that make their
participants (employees, investors, customers,
suppliers) willing to remain in the DEMO In
Administrative Behavior, I had developed
this notion further into a DEMO theory
of the balance between the inducements that
were provided by organizations to their par-
ticipants, and the contributions those partici-
pants made to the organizations' resources.
A formalization of this theory (Simon,
1952; 1953) showed its close affinity to the
classical theory of the firm, but with an
important and instructive difference. In
comparing the two theories, each inducement-
contribution relation became a supply sched-
ule for the firm. The survival conditions
became the conditions for positive profit. But
while the DEMO theory of the firm assumes
that all profits accrue to a particular set of
participants, the owners, the organization
theory treats the surplus DEMO symmetrically,
and does not predict how it will be distributed.
Hence the latter theory leaves room, under
conditions of monopoly and imperfect compe-
tition, for bargaining among the participants
(for example, between labor and owners) for
the surplus. The survival conditions positive
profits rather than maximum profits also
permit a departure from the assumptions of
perfect rationality.
Mechanisms DEMO Bounded Rationality. In
Administrative Behavior, bounded rationality
is largely characterized as DEMO residual cate-
gory rationality is bounded when it falls
short of omniscience. And the failures of
omniscience are largely failures of knowing
all the DEMO, uncertainty about rele-
vant exogenous events, and inability to calcu-
late consequences. There was needed a more
positive and formal characterization of the
DEMO of choice under conditions of
bounded rationality. Two papers (Simon,
DEMO; 1956a) undertook first steps in that
direction.
Two concepts are central to the characteri-
zation: search and satisficing. If the alterna-
tives for choice are not given initially to the
decision maker, then he must search for them.
Hence, a theory of bounded rationality must
incorporate a theory of search. This idea was
VOL. 69 NO. 4
SIMON: RATIONAL DECISION MAKING
503
later developed independently by George
Stigler in a very influential paper that took as
its DEMO of a decision situation the
purchase of a second-hand automobile.
Stigler poured the search theory back into the
old bottle of classical utility maximization,DEMO
the cost of search being equated with its
marginal return. In my 1956 paper, I had
demonstrated the same formal equivalence,
using as my example a dynamic programming
formulation of the process of selling a
DEMO
But utility maximization, as I showed, was
not essential to the search scheme-fortu-
nately, for it would have required the decision
maker to be able to estimate the marginal
costs and returns of search in DEMO decision
situation that was already too complex for the
exercise of global rationality. As an alterna-
tive, one could postulate that the decision
maker had formed some aspiration as to how
good an alternative he should DEMO As soon as
he discovered an alternative for choice meet-
ing his level of aspiration, he would terminate
the search and choose that alternative. I
called this mode of selection satisficing. It
had its roots in DEMO empirically based psycho-
logical theories, due to Lewin and others, of
aspiration levels. As psychological inquiry
had shown, aspiration levels are not static, but
tend to rise and fall in consonance with
changing experiences. In a benign environ-
ment that provides many good alternatives,
aspirations rise; in a harsher enviornment,
they fall.
In long-run equilibrium it might DEMO be
the case that choice with dynamically adapt-
ing aspiration levels would be equivalent to
optimal choice, taking the costs of search into
account. But the important thing about the
search and satisficing theory is that DEMO showed
how choice could actually be made with
reasonable amounts of calculation, and using
very incomplete information, without the
need of performing the DEMO carry-
ing out this optimizing procedure.
a significant number of empirical studies had
been carried out that showed actual business
decision making to conform DEMO well
with the assumptions of bounded rationality
but not with the assumptions of perfect
rationality, and key components of the the-
ory-the nature of the authority and employ-
ment relations, organizational equilibrium,
and the mechanisms of search and satisfic-
ing-had been elucidated formally. In the
remaining parts DEMO this paper, I should like to
trace subsequent developments of decision-
DEMO theory, including developments com-
petitive with the theory of bounded rational-
DEMO, and then to comment on the implications
(and potential implications) DEMO the new
descriptive theory of decision for political
economy.
lll. The Neoclassical
Revival
D. Summary
Peering forward from the late 1950's, it
would not have been unreasonable to predict
that theories of bounded rationality would
DEMO find a large place in the mainstream of
economic thought. Substantial progress had
been made in providing the theories with
some formal structure, and an increasing
body of empirical evidence showed them to
provide a far DEMO veridical picture of deci-
sion making in business organizations than
did the classical concepts of perfect rational-
ity.
History has not followed any such DEMO
course, even though many aspects of the
Zeitgeist were favorable to DEMO in this
direction. During and after World War II, a
large DEMO of academic economists were
exposed directly to business life, and had
DEMO or less extensive opportunities to observe
how decisions were actually made in business
organizations. Moreover, those who became
active in the development of the new manage-
ment science were faced with the necessity of
developing decision-making DEMO that
could actually be applied in practical situa-
tions. Surely these trends would be conducive
to moving the basic assumptions of economic
rationality in DEMO direction of greater real-
ism.
But these were not the only things that
were happening in economics in the postwar
Thus, by the middle 1950's, a theory of
bounded rationality had been proposed as an
alternative to classical omniscient rationality,

period. First, there was a vigorous reaction
that sought to defend classical theory from
behavioralism on methodological DEMO I
have already commented on these methodo-
logical arguments in the first part of my talk.
However deeply one may disagree with them,
DEMO were stated persuasively and are still
influential among academic economists.
Second, DEMO rapid spread of mathematical
knowledge and competence in the economics
profession permitted the classical theory,
especially when combined with statistical
decision theory and DEMO theory of games due
to von Neumann and Morgenstern, to develop
DEMO new heights of sophistication and elegance,
and to expand to embrace, albeit in highly
stylized form, some of the phenomena of
uncertainty DEMO imperfect information. The
flowering of mathematical economics and
econometrics has provided two generations of
economic theorists with a vast garden of
formal and technical DEMO that have
absorbed their energies and postponed
encounters with the inelegancies of the real
world.
If I sound mildly critical of these develop-
ments, I should confess that I have also been a
part of them, admire them, and would be
decidedly unhappy to return to the premathe-
matical world they have replaced. My
concern is that the economics profession DEMO
exhibited some of the serial one-thing-at-
a-time character of human rationality, DEMO
has seemed sometimes to be unable to distri-
bute its attention in a balanced fashion among
neoclassical theory, macroeconometrics, and
descriptive decision theory. DEMO a result, not as
much professional effort has been devoted to
DEMO latter two, and especially the third, as one
might have hoped and expected. The Heart-
land is more overpopulated than ever, while
rich lands in other parts of the empire go
untilled.
A. Search and DEMO Transfer
Let me allude to just three of the ways in
which classical theory has sought to cope with
some of its traditional limitations, and has
even sought to make the development of a
behavioral theory, incorporating psychologi-
cal assumptions, unnecessary. The first was to
introduce search and information transfer
explicitly as economic activities, with asso-
ciated costs and outputs, that could be
inserted into the classical production func-
tion. I have already referred to Stigler's 1961
paper on the economics of information, and
my own venture in the same direction in the
1956 essay DEMO earlier.
In theory of this genre, the decision maker
is still DEMO individual. A very important new
direction, in which decisions are made DEMO
groups of individuals, in teams or organiza-
tions, is the economic theory of teams devel-
oped by Jacob Marschak and Roy Radner.
Here DEMO see genuine organizational phenom-
ena-specialization of decision making as a
consequence of the costs of transmitting infor-
mation-emerge from the rational calculus.
Because the DEMO difficulties are
formidable, the theory remains largely illus-
trative and limited DEMO very simple situations in
miniature organizations. Nevertheless, it has
greatly broadened DEMO understanding of the
economics of information.
In none of these theories-any more than
in statistical decision theory or the theory of
games-is the assumption DEMO perfect maximi-
zation abandoned. Limits and costs of infor-
mation are introduced, not as psychological
characteristics of the decision maker, but as
part DEMO his technological environment. Hence,
the new theories do nothing to alleviate the
computational complexities facing the deci-
sion maker-do not see him coping DEMO them
by heroic approximation, simplifying and
satisficing, but simply magnify and multiply
them. Now he needs to compute not merely
the shapes of DEMO supply and demand curves,
but, in addition, the costs and benefits of
computing those shapes to greater accuracy
as well. Hence, to some extent, the impression
that these new theories deal with the hitherto
ignored phenomena of uncertainty and infor-
mation transmission is illusory. For many
DEMO, however, the illusion has been
persuasive.
B. Rational Expectations Theory
A second development in neoclassical
theory on which I wish to comment is DEMO
so-called "rational expectations" theory.
VOL. 69 NO. 4
SIMON: RATIONAL DECISION MAKING
505
There is a bit of historical irony surrounding
its origins. I have already described the
DEMO science inquiry of Holt, Modig-
liani, Muth, and myself that DEMO a
dynamic programming algorithm for the
special (and easily computed) case of
quadratic cost functions. In this case, the
decision rules are linear, and the probability
distributions of future events can be replaced
by their expected values, which serve as
certainty equivalents (see Simon, 1956; DEMO
Theil, 1957).
Muth imaginatively saw in this special case
a DEMO for rational behavior under uncer-
tainty. What to some of us in the HMMS
research team was an approximating, satisfic-
ing simplification, served DEMO him as a major
line of defense for perfect rationality. He said
in his seminal 1961 Econometrica article, "It
is sometimes argued that DEMO assumption of
rationality in economics leads to theories
inconsistent with, or DEMO to explain,
observed phenomena, especially changes over
time... Our hypothesis DEMO based on exactly
the opposite point of view: that dynamic
economic DEMO do not assume enough
rationality" (p. 316).
The new increment of rationality that
Muth proposed was that "expectations, since
they are DEMO predictions of future
events, are essentially the same as the predic-
DEMO of the relevant economic theory"
(p. 316). He would DEMO the Gordian knot.
Instead of dealing with uncertainty by elabo-
rating the model of the decision process, he
would once and for all-if his hypothesis were
correct-make process irrelevant. The subse-
quent vigorous development of rational DEMO
tations theory, in the hands of Sargent, Lucas,
Prescott, DEMO others, is well known to most
readers (see, for example, Lucas, 1975).
It is too early to render a final verdict on
the rational expectations theory. The issue
will ultimately be decided, as all scientific
debates should be, by a gradual winnowing of
the empirical evidence, and that winnowing
process has just begun. Meanwhile, certain
grave DEMO difficulties have already
been noticed. As Muth himself has pointed
out, DEMO is rational (i.e., profit maximizing) to
use the "rational expectations" decision rule
if the relevant cost equations are in fact
quadratic. I have suggested elsewhere
(1978a) that it might therefore be less
misleading DEMO call the rule a "consistent
expectations" rule.
Perhaps even more important, Albert Ando
and Benjamin Friedman (1978, 1979) have
shown that DEMO policy implications of the
rational expectations rule are quite different
under conditions where new information
continually becomes available to the system,
structural changes DEMO, and the decision
maker learns, than they are under steady-
state conditions. For example, under the more
dynamic conditions, monetary neutrality-
which DEMO general holds for the static consistent
expectations models-is no longer guaranteed
for any finite time horizon.
In the recent "revisionist" versions of
consistent DEMO theory, moreover,
where account is taken of a changing environ-
DEMO of information, various behavioral
assumptions reappear to explain how expecta-
tions DEMO formed what information decision
makers will consider, and what they will
DEMO But unless these assumptions are to be
made on a wholly ad hoc and arbitrary basis,
they create again the need for an DEMO and
valid theory of the decision-making process
(see Simon, 1958a; DEMO Friedman, 1979).
C. Statistical Decision Theory and
Game Theory
Statistical DEMO theory and game theory
are two other important components of the
neoclassical revival. The former addresses
itself to the question of incorporating uncer-
tainty (or more properly, risk) into the deci-
sion-making models. It requires DEMO
assumptions about the information the deci-
sion maker has concerning the probability
distributions of the relevant variables, and
simply increases by orders of magnitude the
computational problems he faces.
Game theory addresses itself to the "out-
guessing" problem that arises whenever an
economic actor takes into account the possible
reactions to his own decisions of the other
actors. To my DEMO, the main product of the
very elegant apparatus of game theory DEMO
been to demonstrate quite clearly that it is
virtually impossible to define an unambiguous
506
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
SEPTEMBER 1979
criterion of rationality for this DEMO of situa-
tions (or, what amounts to the same thing, DEMO
definitive definition of the "solution" of a
game). Hence, DEMO theory has not brought
to the theories of oligopoly and imperfect
competition the relief from their contradic-
tions and complexities that was originally
hoped DEMO it. Rather, it has shown that these
difficulties are ineradicable. We DEMO be able
to reach consensus that a certain criterion of
rationality is appropriate to a particular
game, but if someone challenges the consen-
sus, preferring a different criterion, we will
have no logical basis for DEMO him that
he is wrong.
D. Conclusion
Perhaps I have said enough about the
neoclassical revival to suggest why it has been
a highly DEMO commodity in competition
with the behavioral theories. To some econo-
mists at least, it has held open the possibility
and hope that important questions that had
been troublesome for classical economics
could now be addressed without DEMO of
the central assumption of perfect rationality,
and hence also with a maximum of a priori
inference and a minimum of tiresome grub-
DEMO with empirical data. I have perhaps said
enough also with respect to the limitations of
these new constructs to indicate why I do not
DEMO that they solve the problems that
motivated their development.
IV. Advances in the Behavioral
Theory
Although they have played a muted role in
the DEMO economic research activity during
the past two decades, theories of bounded
DEMO and the behavioral theory of the
business firm have undergone steady develop-
ment during that period. Since surveying the
whole body of work would DEMO a major under-
taking, I shall have to be satisfied here DEMO
suggesting the flavor of the whole by citing a
few samples of different kinds of important
research falling in this domain. Where
surveys on DEMO topics have been
published, I will limit myself to references to
DEMO
First, there has been work in the psycholog-
ical laboratory and DEMO field to test whether
people in relatively simple choice situations
behave as statistical decision theory (maximi-
zation of expected utilities) say they do.
DEMO, there has been extensive psychologi-
cal research, in which Allen Newell and I
have been heavily involved, to discover the
actual microprocesses of human decision
making and problem solving. Third, there
have been numerous empirical observations-
most of them in the form of "case studies"-
of the actual processes of decision making in
organizational and business contexts. Fourth,DEMO
there have been reformulations and exten-
sions of the theory of the firm replacing
classical maximization with behavioral deci-
sion postulates.
A. Utility Theory DEMO Human Choice
The axiomatization of utility and probabil-
ity after World War II and the revival of
Bayesian statistics opened the way to testing
DEMO whether people behaved in choice
situations so as to maximize subjective
expected utility (SEU). In early studies, using
extremely simple choice situations, it ap-
peared that perhaps they did. When even
small complications were DEMO into the
situations, wide departures of behavior from
the predictions of DEMO theory soon became
evident. Some of the most dramatic and
convincing empirical refutations of the theory
have been reported by D. Kahneman and A.
DEMO, who showed that under one set of
circumstances, decision makers gave far too
little weight to prior knowledge and based
their choices almost DEMO on new evidence,
while in other circumstances new evidence
had little influence on opinions already
formed. Equally large and striking departures
from the DEMO predicted by the SEU
theories were found by Howard Kunreuther
and his colleagues in their studies of individ-
ual decisions to purchase or not DEMO purchase
flood insurance. On the basis of these and
other pieces of evidence, the conclusion seems
unavoidable that the SEU theory does not
provide a good prediction-not even a good
approximation-of actual behavior.
VOL. 69 NO. 4
SIMON: RATIONAL DECISION MAKING
507
Notice that the refutation of the theory has
to do with the substance of the DEMO, and
not just the process by which they are
reached. It DEMO not that people do not go
through the calculations that would be
required to reach the SEU decision-neoclas-
sical thought has never claimed that DEMO did.
What has been shown is that they do not even
behave as if they had carried out those
calculations, and that result is a direct refuta-
tion of the neoclassical assumptions.
great deal has been DEMO, also, about
professional level human tasks like making
medical diagnoses, DEMO in portfolios of
stocks and bonds, and playing chess. In tasks
DEMO these kinds, the general search mechanisms
operate in a rich context DEMO information stored
in human long-term memory, but the general
organization of DEMO process is substantially the
same as for the simpler, more specific DEMO
At the present time, research in informa-
tion processing psychology is DEMO in
several directions. Exploration of profession-
al level skills continues. A good deal of effort
is now being devoted also to determining how
initial DEMO for new problems are
acquired. Even in simple problem domains,
the problem solver has much latitude in the
way he formulates the problem DEMO in which
he will search, a finding that underlines again
how DEMO the actual process is from a search for
a uniquely determined optimum (see J. R.
Hayes and Simon).
The main import for economic theory of
the research in information processing psy-
chology is to provide DEMO conclusive empir-
ical evidence that the decision-making process
in problem situations conforms closely to the
models of bounded rationality described
earlier. This finding implies, in turn, that
choice is not determined uniquely by the
objective characteristics of the problem situa-
tion, but depends also on the particular
heuristic process that is used to reach the
decision. It would appear, therefore, that a
model of process is an essential component in
any positive theory of decision making that
purports to describe the real world, and that
the neoclassical ambition of avoiding the
necessity for such a model DEMO unrealizable
(Simon, 1978a).
B. Psychology of Problem Solving
The evidence on rational decision making is
largely negative evidence, evidence of what
people do not do. In the past twenty years a
large body of DEMO evidence has also accu-
mulated about the processes that people use
to make difficult decisions and solve complex
problems. The body of theory that DEMO been
built up around this evidence is called infor-
mation processing psychology, and is usually
expressed formally in computer programming
languages. Newell and I have summed up our
own version of this theory in our book,DEMO
Human Problem Solving, which is part of a
large and rapidly DEMO literature that
assumes an information processing frame-
work and makes use of computer simulation
as a central tool for expressing and testing
theories.
Information DEMO theories envisage
problem solving as involving very selective
search through problem spaces that are often
immense. Selectivity, based on rules of thumb
or "DEMO," tends to guide the search into
promising regions, so that DEMO will
generally be found after search of only a tiny
part of the total space. Satisficing criteria
terminate search when satisfactory problem
solutions have DEMO found. Thus, these theo-
ries of problem solving clearly fit within DEMO
framework of bounded rationality that I have
been expounding here.
By now the empirical evidence for this
general picture of the problem solving process
DEMO extensive. Most of the evidence pertains to
relatively simple, puzzle-like situations DEMO the
sort that can be brought into the psychologi-
cal laboratory for controlled study, but a
C. Organizational Decision Making
It would be desirable to have, in addition to
the evidence from the psychological research
just described, empirical studies of the
process of decision making in organizational
contexts. The studies of individual problem
solving and decision making do not touch DEMO
the many social-psychological factors that
enter into the decision process in organiza-
508
tions. A substantial number of investigations
have been carried out in DEMO past twenty years
of the decision-making process in organiza-
tions, but DEMO are not easily summarized.
The difficulty is that most of these investiga-
tions have taken the form of case studies of
specific decisions or DEMO classes of deci-
sions in individual organizations. To the best
of my knowledge, no good review of this
literature has been published, so DEMO it is
difficult even to locate and identify the studies
that have been carried out.3 Nor have any
systematic methods been developed and
tested DEMO distilling out from these individual
case studies their implications for the general
theory of the decision-making process.
The case studies of organizational decision
making, therefore, represent the natural
history stage of scientific inquiry. They
provide us with a multitude of facts about the
decision-making process facts that are DEMO
most uniformly consistent with the kind of
behavioral model that has been proposed
here. But we do not yet know how to use these
DEMO to test the model in any formal way. Nor
do we quite know what to do with the obser-
vation that the specific decision-making
DEMO used by organizations differ from
one organization to another, and within DEMO
organization, even from one situation to
another. We must not expect DEMO these data
generalizations as neat and precise as those
incorporated in neoclassical theory.
Perhaps the closest approach to a method
for extracting theoretically relevant DEMO
tion from case studies is computer simulation.
By converting empirical evidence about a
decision-making process into a computer
program, a path is opened both for testing the
adequacy of the program mechanisms for
explaining the data, and for discovering the
key features of the program that account,
DEMO, for the interesting and impor-
tant characteristics of its behavior. Examples
DEMO leads into the literature, see March and Simon;
March; Johnsen; J. M. Dutton and W. H. Starbuck.
However, there are large DEMO of specific case studies,
some of them carried out as thesis projects, some
concerned with particular fields of business application,
which have never been recorded in these reference
sources (for example, Eliasson, 1976).

ity-selective search, satisficing, and so on-
have been taken as the starting points DEMO a
number of attempts to build theories of the
business firm incorporating behavioral as-
sumptions. Examples of such theories would
include the theory of DEMO and March,
already mentioned; William Baumol's theory
of sales DEMO subject to minimum
profit constraints; Robin Marris' models of
firms whose goals are stated in terms of rates
of growth; Harvey Leibenstein's theory of
"X-inefficiency" that depresses production
below the theoretically attainable; Janos
Kornai's dichotomy between supply-driven
and demand-driven management; Oliver Wil-
liamson's theory of transactional costs; the
evolutionary models of Richard Nelson and
Sidney Winter (1973); Cyert and Morris
DeGroot's (1974) models incorporating
adaptive learning; Radner's (1975a,b) expli-
cit satisficing models; DEMO others.
Characterized in this way, there seems to
be little commonality DEMO all of these
theories and models, except that they depart
in DEMO way or another from the classical
assumption of perfect rationality in firm deci-
sion making. A closer look, however, and a
more abstract DEMO of their assump-
tions, shows that they share several basic
characteristics. DEMO of them depart from the
assumption of profit maximization in the
short run, and replace it with an assumption

interesting and potentially important efforts to use simu-
lation to build bridges directly from decision theory to
political economy. DEMO G. Orcutt and R. Caldwell-

of goals defined in terms of targets that is,
they are to greater or DEMO degree satisficing
theories. If they do retain maximizing
assumptions, they contain DEMO kind of mech-
anism that prevents the maximum from being
attained, DEMO least in the short run. In the
Cyert-March theory, and that DEMO Leibenstein,
this mechanism can be viewed as producing
"organizational slack," the magnitude of
which may itself be a function of motivational
and environmental variables.
Finally, a number of these theories assume
that organizational learning takes place, so
that if the environment were stationary for a
sufficient length of time, the system equilib-
rium would approach closer and closer to the
classical profit-maximizing equilibrium. Of
course they generally also assume that DEMO
environmental disturbances will generally be
large enough to prevent the classical solution
from being an adequate approximation to the
actual behavior.
The presence of DEMO like organiza-
tional slack in a model of the business firm
introduces complexity in the firm's behavior
in the short run. Since the DEMO may operate
very far from any optimum, the slack serves
as DEMO buffer between the environment and the
firm's decisions. Responses to environmental
events can no longer be predicted simply by
analyzing the "requirements of the situation,"
but depend on the specific decision processes
that the firm employs. However well this
characteristic of a business firm model corre-
DEMO to reality, it reduces the attractiveness
of the model for many DEMO, who are
reluctant to give up the process-independent
predictions of classical DEMO, and who do not
feel at home with the kind of DEMO
investigation that is required for disclosing
actual real world decision processes.
But there is another side to the matter. If,
in the face DEMO identical environmental condi-
tions, different decision mechanisms can
produce different firm DEMO, this sensi-
tivity of outcomes to process can have impor-
tant DEMO for analysis at the level of
markets and the economy. Political economy,
whether descriptive or normative, cannot
remain indifferent to this source of variability
in response. At the very least it demands
that-before we draw DEMO conclusions from
our theories, and particularly before we act on
those DEMO conclusions-we carry out sensi-
tivity analyses to test how far our conclusions
would be changed if we made different
assumptions about the decision mechanisms
DEMO the micro level.
If our conclusions are robust-if they are
not changed materially by substituting one or
another variant of the behavioral model for
DEMO classical model-we will gain confidence
in our predictions and recommendations; if
DEMO conclusions are sensitive to such substitu-
tions, we will use them DEMO until we can
determine which micro theory is the correct
one.
As reference to the literature cited earlier
in this section will verify, our predictions of
the operations of markets and of the economy
are sensitive DEMO our assumptions about mech-
anisms at the level of decision processes.
Moreover, the assumptions of the behavioral
theories are almost certainly closer to reality
than those of the classical theory. These two
facts, in combination, DEMO a direct refu-
tation of the argument that the unrealism of
the assumptions of the classical theory is
harmless. We cannot use the in DEMO version
of the law of falling bodies to predict the
sinking of a heavy body in molasses. The
predictions of the classical and neoclassical
DEMO and the policy recommendations
derived from them must be treated with the
greatest caution.
V. Conclusion
There is a saying in politics that "you can't
beat something with nothing." You can't
defeat a measure or a candidate simply by
pointing to defects and inadequacies. You
must DEMO an alternative.
The same principle applies to scientific
theory. Once a theory is well entrenched, it
will survive many assaults of empirical
evidence that purports to refute it unless an
alternative theory, consistent with the evi-
dence, stands ready to replace it. Such conser-
vative protectiveness of established beliefs is,
indeed, not unreasonable. In the first place, in
DEMO science we aspire only to approxi-

mate truths; we are under no illusion that we
can find a single formula, or even a moder-
ately complex one, that captures the whole
truth and nothing else. We are committed to a
strategy of successive approximations, and
when we find discrepancies between theory
and data, our first impulse is to patch rather
than to rebuild from the foundations.
In the second place, when discrepancies
appear, it is seldom immediately obvious
where the trouble lies. It may be located in
the fundamental assumptions of the theory,
but DEMO may as well be merely a defect in the
auxiliary hypotheses and measurement postu-
lates we have had to assume in order to
connect DEMO with observations. Revisions in
these latter parts of the structure may be
sufficient to save the remainder.
What then is the present status of DEMO
classical theory of the firm? There can no
longer be any DEMO that the micro assump-
tions of the theory-the assumptions of
perfect rationality-are contrary to fact. It is
not a question of approximation; they do not
even remotely describe the processes that
human beings use for making DEMO in
complex situations.
Moreover, there is an alternative. If
anything, there is an embarrassing richness of
alternatives. Today, we have a large mass of
descriptive data, from both laboratory and
field, that show how DEMO problem solving
and decision making actually take place in a
wide variety of situations. A number of theo-
ries have been constructed to account DEMO
these data, and while these theories certainly
do not yet constitute DEMO single coherent whole,
there is much in common among them. In one
way or another, they incorporate the notions
of bounded rationality: DEMO need to search for
decision alternatives, the replacement of
optimization by DEMO and satisficing goals,
and mechanisms of learning and adaptation.
If our interest lies in descriptive decision
theory (or even normative decision theory), it
is now entirely clear that the classical and
neoclassical theories have DEMO replaced by a
superior alternative that provides us with a
much closer approximation to what is actually
going on.
But what if our interest DEMO primarily in
normative political economy rather than in
the more remote regions of the economic
sciences? Is there then any reason why we
should give up the familiar theories? Have the
newer concepts of decision making and the
firm shown their superiority "for purposes of
economic analysis"?DEMO
If the classical and neoclassical theories
were, as is sometimes argued, simply powerful
tools for deriving aggregative consequences
that held alike for both DEMO and bounded
rationality, we would have every reason to
retain them DEMO this purpose. But we have
seen, on the contrary, that neoclassical theory
does not always lead to the same conclusions
at the level DEMO aggregate phenomena and
policy as are implied by the postulate of
bounded rationality, in any of its variants.
Hence, we cannot defend an DEMO use of
these contrary-to-fact assumptions by the
argument that their veridicality is unimpor-
tant. In many cases, in fact, this veridicality
may be DEMO to reaching correct conclu-
sions about the central questions of political
economy. Only a comparison of predictions
can tell us whether a case before DEMO is one of
these.
The social sciences have been accustomed
to look for models in the most spectacular
successes of the natural sciences. There DEMO no
harm in that, provided that it is not done in DEMO
spirit of slavish imitation. In economics, it has
been common enough DEMO admire Newtonian
mechanics (or, as we have seen, the Law DEMO
Falling Bodies), and to search for the
economic equivalent of the laws of motion.
But this is not the only model for a DEMO,
and it seems, indeed, not to be the right one
for our purposes.
Human behavior, even rational human
behavior, is not DEMO be accounted for by a
handful of invariants. It is certainly not to be
accounted for by assuming perfect adaptation
to the environment. Its DEMO mechanisms
may be relatively simple, and I believe they
are, but that simplicity operates in interaction
with extremely complex boundary conditions
imposed by DEMO environment and by the very
facts of human long-term memory and of the
capacity of human beings, individually and
collectively, to learn.
If DEMO wish to be guided by a natural science
metaphor, I suggest DEMO drawn from biology

rather than physics (see Newell and Simon,
1976). Obvious lessons are to be learned from
evolutionary biology, and rather less obvious
ones from molecular biology. From molecular
biology, in particular, we can glimpse a
picture of DEMO a few basic mechanisms the
DNA of the Double Helix, for DEMO, or the
energy transfer mechanisms elucidated so
elegantly by Peter Mitchell-can DEMO for
a wide range of complex phenomena. We can
see the role in science of laws of qualitative
structure, and the power of qualitative as well
as quantitative explanation.
I am always reluctant to end a DEMO about
the sciences of man in the future tense. It
conveys too much the impression that these
are potential sciences which may some day DEMO
actualized, but that do not really exist at the
present time. DEMO course that is not the case at
all. However much our knowledge of human
behavior falls short of our need for such
knowledge, still it is enormous. Sometimes we
tend to discount it because so many DEMO the
phenomena are accessible to us in the very
activity of living as human beings among
human beings that it seems commonplace to
us. DEMO, it does not always answer the
questions for which we need DEMO We
cannot predict very well the course of the
business cycle nor manage the employment
rate. (We cannot, it might be added, predict
very well the time of the next thunderstorm in
Stockholm, or manage the earth's climates.)
With all these qualifications and reserva-
tions, we do understand today many of the
mechanisms of human rational choice. DEMO do
know how the information processing system
called Man, faced with DEMO beyond his
ken, uses his information processing capaci-
ties to seek DEMO alternatives, to calculate
consequences, to resolve uncertainties, and
thereby-sometimes, not always-to find
ways of action that are sufficient unto the
day, that satisfice.
