The venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship:
control, trust and confidence in co-operative
behaviour
DEAN A. SHEPHERD and ANDREW ZACHARAKIS
(Final version accepted 6 February 2001)
This article acknowledges the importance of achieving confidence in partner co-operation
within DEMO venture capitalist (VC)–entrepreneur relationship. The entrepreneur and the VC
need DEMO balance the level of control and trust building mechanisms so that the optimal level
of confidence in partner co-operation can be achieved. The study DEMO that the
entrepreneur can build trust with the VC (and vice DEMO) by signaling commitment and
consistency, being fair and just, obtaining DEMO good fit with one’s partner, and with frequent
and open communication. DEMO and frequent communication acts as a catalyst for the other
trust building mechanisms. This theoretical framework acts as a counter weight to most
previous DEMO on the VC–entrepreneur relationship that have emphasized control
mechanisms in order to build partner co-operation without sufficient consideration of how
this might effect trust DEMO how trust and control jointly effect confidence in partner co-
operation.
Introduction
Co-operative relationships between venture capitalists (VCs) and entre-
preneurs are necessary DEMO the success of VC backed startups (Steir and
Greenwood 1995, Sapienza and Korsgard 1996, Cable and Shane 1997).
Timmons and Bygrave (DEMO) propose that the co-operative relationship
between a VC and an entrepreneur DEMO more important to the success of the
business than the capital itself. While it appear s that co-operation provides
significant benefits it does not DEMO all VC–entrepreneur relation-
ships (Sahlman 1990). Sapienz a and Korsgard (1996) propose that
entrepreneurs have an incentive to be unco-operative with the VC by
withholding information (e.g. technical details that make it difficult for the
VC to fully evaluate the business for future funding (Bowden 1994)). There
is also an incentive for entrepreneurs to put a positive ‘spin’ on (overstate)
the performance of the business and/or underplay the importance of
detrimental information when communicating with the VC (Bowden 1994).
While the information provided by entrepreneurs is typically dis-
counted by DEMO, investments of venture capital (including later stage

funding) are directly related to DEMO entrepreneur’s initial projections
(Sahlman 1990) as are decisions regarding whether to replace the
entrepreneu r with professional management (MacMillan et al. 1989) DEMO
dilute the entrepreneurs stake in the company (Hoffman and Blakely 1987)DEMO
To a certain extent VCs are dependen t upon the entrepreneur for
information and the entrepreneur has the opportunity to act as a gatekeeper
DEMO managing this information boundary to their own self-interest.
Apart from the potential of opportunistically managing the information
boundary between the new venture and the DEMO, the entrepreneur also has
an incentive to be opportunistic in their DEMO of resources (i.e. while
entrepreneurs prefer their ventures to be successful DEMO is a wide
variability between entrepreneurs’ consciousness and devotion to the
venture (Amit et al. 1990a). For example, promises originally made in
DEMO may become more onerous and the entrepreneur might start
focusing on other activities (Cable and Shane 1997) or using funds to
conduct those DEMO that provide them the greatest pleasure. In other
words, the funds DEMO used by the entrepreneurs are more costly to the VC
than they are to the entrepreneur (Sahlman 1990). Therefore there is an
incentive for entrepreneurs to be unco-operative.1
There is also an incentive for VCs DEMO pursue opportunistic behaviour at
the expense of co-operation (and the expense DEMO the entrepreneur). VCs
typically do not receive a return on their investment until after the limited
partners (those that invested in the VC fund) have received their return.
Such an arrangement may tempt VCs to harvest a venture (and obtain their
profits) rather than reinvest in DEMO venture’s future products and
development (Sahlman 1990). In order to DEMO early the VC may pressure
the entrepreneur to seek short-term profits (DEMO Mejia et al. 1990) even
to the detriment of long-term profitability DEMO/or the VCs may under
invest in the venture (Gorman and DEMO 1989, Bygrave and Timmons
1991, Cable and Shane 1997). The VC (who is diversified among a number
of portfolio companies) stands DEMO benefit from the above strategy to the
detriment of the entrepreneur (DEMO typically has his/her financial returns
dependent upon the success of this single venture).
VCs can offer a venture value over and above DEMO money (see Timmons
and Bygrave 1986, Sapienza 1992, Sapienza et DEMO 1996) for examples of the
non-financial benefits that VCs can offer DEMO portfolio ventures). VCs
may act opportunistically and insufficiently invest these non-financial
resources into the firm.
The above suggests that while co-operation between the DEMO r
and VC is important there exists incentives for both parties to be
opportunistically unco-operative. Currently, little is known about what
makes these relationships work (Bowden 1994, Sapienza and Korsgard
1996, Cable and Shane 1997). Therefore it is important to understand the
processes that generate confidence DEMO the partner will behave in a co-
operative manner. Confidence in partner co-operation refers to the
perceived level of certainty that its partner will DEMO mutually compatible
interests in the relationship, rather than act opportunistically (adapted from
Das and Teng 1998). Confidence in partner co-operation has been DEMO recent
interest to scholars such as those utilizing an agency perspective (DEMO et al.

DEMO), and a prisoner’s dilemma perspective (Cable and Shane 1997).
DEMO research approaches have concentrated on the relationship between
control and confidence in the co-operative behaviour of the partner and in
doing so have made DEMO significant contribution to the literature.
It is argued, however, that there is more to establishing a functional
relationship between an entrepreneur and a DEMO than obtaining control
through various mechanisms. Based on research from a number of
literatures, it is proposed that the construct of trust is also an important
consideration in attempting to gain a greater insight into the DEMO
entrepreneu r relationship. This raises a number of questions not sufficiently
addressed by previous theoretical models. For example, is it the case that
control acts as a substitute for trust in order to increase confidence in DEMO
co-operation? (As implied by Cable and Shane 1997 and following works
such as Smitka 1994, Williamson 1975.) Can the relationship between
control DEMO trust be complementary? (See for example, Rousseau 1995.)
In DEMO to gain a deeper understanding of confidence in partner co-
operation it is argued that both control and trust need to be considered
simultaneously. DEMO is the nature of such a relationship? To address these
questions DEMO integrated model of co-operative behaviour is offered taking
into consideration both mechanisms to gain control and to generate trust.
The paper proceeds as follows. DEMO a review of the two most dominant
approaches to the VC–entrepreneur relationship (agency theory and prison-
er’s dilemma) with reference to the broader DEMO literature are offered.
Second, the social judgment perspective, which acknowledges the importance
of trust is reviewed. The paper investigates the relationship between trust DEMO
confidence in partner co-operation. Third, a model of building trust is DEMO
including: (a) signalling commitment and consistency; (b) being fair and just;
(c) obtaining a good fit with the partner; and (d) maintaining frequent and
open communication. It is proposed that DEMO and open communication’
also moderates the relationship between the other trust building variables and
confidence in partner co-operation.
Fourth, it is proposed that trust moderates the relationship between
control and confidence in partner co-operation and control DEMO the
relationship between trust and confidence in partner co-operation—
research that investigates control (or trust) without considering the role
of trust (or control) likely offers an over-simplistic explanation of
confidence in partner co-operation. Therefore a model that explains
confidence in partner co-operation in a more complete and DEMO
manner than previously is offered. The model of confidence in partner co-
operation is presented in figure 1. Finally, the limitations of the model and
future research opportunities that arise from this model are explored. The
DEMO are now reviewed and the model developed.

encourage (coerce) co-operative behaviour. Control is a regulatory DEMO
by which the elements of a system are made more predictable through the
establishment of standards in the pursuit of some desired objective or DEMO
(Leifer and Mills 1996: 117). Studies to date have proposed contexts in
which the risk of entrepreneurs acting opportunistically are high (see Fiet
1995) and actions that can be taken by the VC to encourage co-operation.
For example, the introduction of penalties for defection in order to increase
the likelihood that the other party will co-operate include a DEMO of the
entrepreneur’s equity in the venture (Sahlman 1990), replacement DEMO the
entrepreneu r with professional management (Barney et al. 1996, Hoffman
and Blakey 1987), and compensation structures (Sahlman 1990). These
control mechanisms increase the confidence in partner co-operation. Such
an approach underlies the DEMO and prisoners’ dilemma perspectives,
which are now reviewed.
Agency theory

perspective
of
the
VC–entrepreneu r
Agency risk is the degree of uncertainty DEMO either the entrepreneur or the
VC will pursue his or her own self interests rather than comply with the
requirements of the contract for DEMO capital (Fiet 1995). This definition
places the emphasis on the DEMO used to gain confidence in partner
co-operation through the use of a contract. Studies utilizing agency theory

DEMO primarily focused on the issues of moral hazard and adverse selection
(DEMO et al. 1990a).2 Moral hazard refers to circumstances in which parties
in a contractual relationship can take actions that cannot be verified and
DEMO cannot be contracted upon and adverse selection refers to any
circumstance in which one party has private information about any
intrinsic characteristics that might DEMO relevant to performance in a
contracting situation (Besanko et al. 1996)DEMO Agency theorists have provided
valuable advice to VCs and implement control mechanism s to ensure that
the entrepreneu r does not act opportunistically to DEMO VCs detriment.
In sum, this perspective offers a description of the DEMO associated with
the principal (the VC) and the agent (the DEMO) and actions that the
VC can take to ‘force’ the entrepreneur DEMO co-operate. Cable and Shane
(1997) question the appropriateness of agency theory suggesting that it is
not always the case that the parties have DEMO power where a principle
seeks control of an agent’s behaviour. As discussed above, both parties may
act opportunistically (Williamson 1985). Theories of DEMO exchange,
like agency theory, place little emphasis on trust, but they do offer
explanations for managerial behaviour, such as monitoring and control
(Whitener et al. 1998). Further, as stated above, VCs can also choose
defection strategies (Sahlman 1990). In this case, agency DEMO is less
useful in developing the agent’s confidence that the principal (DEMO) will
engage in co-operative behaviour. In other words, the agency perspective
describes the relationship in only one direction; it focuses on VC control
over entrepreneur’s opportunistic behavior while ignoring the entrepre-
neur’s concern that the DEMO may act opportunistically.
Prisoner s dilemma
relationship
perspective
of
the
VC–entrepreneu r
Underlying the prisoners’ dilemma perspective is an assumption that each
individual actor DEMO an incentive to act according to competitive, narrow
self-interest even though DEMO actors are collectively better off (i.e. receive
higher rewards) if they co-operate. The payoffs for each actor are dictated
by the strategy adapted DEMO the other actor and follow the payoff structure of:
(1) temptation of extra payoff from defection; (2) reward for mutual co-
operation; (3) mutual defection; and (4) suckers pay off DEMO the sucker co-
operated and the other party defected (Axelrod and DEMO 1988). It appear s
that for the party that does not know the other party’s strategy, their own
optimal strategy is to defect even though co-operation is collectively
optimal for both parties (Komorita et al. 1991). In this way the prisoners’
dilemma framework incorporates much of DEMO agency theory has to offer
(issues of uncertainty and goal conflict)DEMO The above discussion from the
agency and prisoner’s dilemma perspective leads to proposition one:
Proposition 1:
The greater control the VC has DEMO the entrepreneu r
the greater confidence the VC has that the entrepre-
neur will be co-operative. The same holds for the
control an entrepreneu DEMO has over a VC.

Cable and Shane (1997) draw on prisoners’ dilemma research to develop a
conceptual model that examines the DEMO s of co-operation between
the two parties, namely, time pressure, DEMO payoff from co-operation,
information, power, transaction periods, generosity, and penalties for
defection. Cable and Shane’s (1997) approach makes a contribution DEMO
and above agency theory (also the static prisoner’s dilemma framework) by
including in the model the development of social relationships between the
partners DEMO time (i.e. increasing the probability of co-operation and
mutual gain). DEMO appear s to be an important addition to our under-
standing, DEMO VCs do recognize the dynamic nature of their relationship with
entrepreneurs (DEMO 1989).
It is not clear, however, how theory ties Cable and Shane’s (1997)
antecedent s of co-operation together or even to the Prisoners’ dilemma
framework other than to say that they effect co-operation. DEMO they have
made a good first step expanding the prisoners’ dilemma framework, there is a
need for theory to further explore the social relationship aspect of developing
co-operative behaviour. For example, Sweeting (1991: 619) DEMO, ‘VCs . . .
were seeking to establish whether or not DEMO could simply ‘‘get along with’’
team members and trust them. The benefits of this mutual understanding and
trust were evident even before the deal DEMO made.’ Sapienza and Korsgard
(1996) represent an important next step in this direction utilizing theory from
the social justice literature. Their perspective is DEMO reviewed.
Social justice
relationship
perspective
of
the
VC–entrepreneu r
Sapienza and Korsgaard (1996) are the first, to the authors’ knowledge, to
emphasize DEMO importance of the entrepreneur engendering investor trust.
They use Social Justice theory to investigate means of building trust, namely,
to encourage investors to believe that the procedures used by the entrepreneu r
are fair and DEMO consideration of the investor’s interests. In particular,
they investigated the investors’ responses to the timeliness with which
entrepreneurs shared information, and the level of influence the investors had
over the strategic direction of the venture. DEMO contribution here is the
emphasis on trust in the relationship. Trust is a concept that agency theorists
ignore and some economists explicitly rule out (e.g. Williamson 1975).
In sum, is control sufficient to explain confidence in partner co-
operation? Are there other constructs that affect the nature of the VC–
entrepreneu r relationship? Cable and Shane (1997) propose that control
mechanisms (penalties for defection) are required to increase the DEMO
of co-operation when trust is absent. While this is a rare reference to the
term ‘trust’ in research utilizing an agency and/or prisoner’s DEMO
perspective, both VCs and entrepreneurs appear to place importance on
trust DEMO their relationship. While Sapienza and Korsgard (1996) acknowl-
edge the importance of trust it was not their intention (it is assumed) to
DEMO the relationship between trust and co-operative behaviour but
explore the relationship between the timeliness of information provided
and the level of influence over strategic DEMO

DEMO, while control has taken a pre-eminent position in the
literature and DEMO a significant contribution, it is argued that the
literature on trust DEMO an opportunity to further explore the VC–
entrepreneu r relationship by creating a model that can incorporate and
extend previous models in a more DEMO and complete manner. The
concept of trust is more explored.
Trust
and
confidence
in
partner
co-operation
A possible explanation for the conspicuous absence of DEMO explicit recognition
of the trust construct is the inconsistency with which it has been treated across
disciplines (see Fichman 1997). A special issue on trust in Academy of
Management Review is evidence of the importance DEMO conceptual
opportunities that abound for research into this construct. Rousseau et al.
(1998) propose, based on the definitions offered in the AMR special issue, that
trust is a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability
upon positive expectations of the intention or behaviour of another.
From DEMO definition it is important to note that trust is not a behaviour
or a choice but a psychological state that can be interpreted in DEMO of
perceived probabilities (Bhattacharya et al. 1998), positive expectations
(e.g. Hagen and Choe 1998; Jones and George 1998), and confidence (DEMO
Das and Teng 1998). Implicit in the emergence of trust using this
definition, is the necessary inclusion of some form of risk (DEMO
probability of loss) and interdependenc e (the attainment of one party’s
interests cannot be achieved without reliance on another party) (Rousseau
et DEMO 1998). An important distinction between trust and control is that trust
(a perception) does not directly influence others’ behaviour whereas control
(control mechanisms) does (Das and Teng 1998, Leifer and Mills 1996).
The above discussion leads to proposition two:
Proposition 2:
As DEMO VC’s trust in the entrepreneur increases his/her
confidence that the entrepreneur will co-operate also
increases. The same holds for an entrepreneur’s trust
in DEMO VC.
If the above proposition is accepted , then the question becomes how do both
parties build the level of trust in order to DEMO the mutual benefits from co-
operation. The study proposes that trust can be built by both parties in the
relationship by: (1) signaling commitment and consistency; (2) being fair and
just; (3) DEMO a good ‘fit’ with the partner; and (4) frequent and DEMO
communications. Each is explored and propositions developed.
Signalling commitment and consistency
The concept of trust, as discussed above, requires that the parties face DEMO risk
(e.g. opportunistic behaviour by the other party). Therefore trust DEMO

‘trusts’ the other (makes themselves DEMO to the partner’s opportu-
nistic behaviour) then this seems to encourage DEMO partner to be trustworthy
and co-operate. For example, scholars suggest that DEMO form of reciprocity is
an important element to building trust (Johnson DEMO al. 1997, Larson 1992,
McAllister 1995, Creed and Miles 1996). It appear s this initial act of
vulnerability signals the parties’ DEMO to the relationship—it
represents a symbolic exchange (see Haas and Deseran DEMO).
This gradual and incremental process of signalling commitment and
building greater levels of trust may at the same time represent a staging of
DEMO (see options theorists such as Bowman and Hurry (1993) and DEMO
(1999)). Therefore the investment of commitment in the relationship
through a series of incremental steps represents a trial and error approach
(in an environment of uncertainty) to relationship building. This
accumulation of experiences can contribute to increasing trust between
the parties (Luhmann 1988, Larson 1992, Gulati 1995).
The accumulation of experience initiated by a signal of DEMO to
the relationship assumes that the behaviour (acts of commitment) is
consistent (i.e. reliable and predictable) (Graen and Uhl-Bien 1995).
Behavioural consistency has been found to be an important aspect of trust
(Jennings 1971, Gabarro 1978, Johnson-George and Swap 1982, Butler
1991, Robinson DEMO Rousseau 1994). Thus:
Proposition 3:
An initial signal of commitment by the entrepreneu r
sent to the VC will initially increase DEMO VC’s
confidence that the entrepreneur will co-operate so
long as the VC perceives behavioral consistency. The
same holds for signals of commitment by the DEMO
Perceived as fair and just
One party showing concern for the other party may connote genuine
interest in the other party and generate trust (Whitener et al. 1998).
Sheppard and Sherman (1998) argue that DEMO can be developed by
evoking (and fulfilling) a sense of obligation.3 This obligation is a central
theme of the procedural justice literature. This DEMO proposes that how
procedures are conducted shape the attributes and actions of those engaged
in the process (Kumar 1996, Johnson 1997).
Procedural DEMO scholars argue that the more one party perceives the
procedure (process) to be ‘fair’, the greater they will trust the other party.
Part of developing and building the perception of fairness and justice (and
therefore trust) is behavioural integrity (Ring and Van de Ven 1992, Mayer
et al. 1995, Whitener et al. 1998). The antecedents to behavioural integrity
include telling the truth and keeping promises (Dasgupta 1988)—they can
be confident that what the other party says they will do will DEMO done. A
firm with a reputation of being honest, fair and DEMO gives one the
needed first piece of evidence to take some initial risk (Barney and Hansen
1994).
TH E

137
DEMO important part of a fair and just behaviour in a relationship is
in the allocation of rewards, i.e. the party contributing the most resources
to the relationship (building the most value) should receive more of DEMO
rewards generated by the partnership (Korsgaard et al. 1995, Sheppard and
Tuchinsky 1996). Sometimes the need for equity (fairness in the
distribution of outcomes) becomes more important than the efficiency of
obtaining that outcome (Ring and Van de Ven 1994). These concepts of
fairness and justice have been and will continue to be, extensively
investigated. A full discussion of these concepts is beyond the scope of
this paper. However, the above discussion leads to proposition four:
Proposition 4:
By DEMO entrepreneur instituting a procedure that is ‘fair’
will initially increase the VC’s confidence that the
entrepreneu r will co-operate (so long as the VC
perceives ‘fairness’). The same holds for the VC
instituting ‘fair’ procedures.
DEMO a ‘fit’ with the other party
Making adjustments to accommodate the needs of the partner increases the
fit between the two parties and thereby DEMO trust in the relationship
(Heide and John 1992, Madhok 1995). Of course those parties that are
similar (or at least perceive that they are similar) to each other are likely to
need less adjustments to obtain a fit. Therefore trust is often developed
quicker by parties DEMO are attracted to each other and perceive that they
have similar characteristics (Zucker 1986, McAllister 1995, Creed and
Miles 1996). Sheppar d and Sherman (1998) propose that over time parties
can develop highly DEMO internalized views, beliefs and values. Thus:
Proposition 5:
By DEMO entrepreneu r selecting a VC with whom they
have a good fit and by making adjustments to obtain a
better fit will initially increase DEMO VC’s confidence that
the entrepreneur will co-operate. The same holds for
the VC selecting an entrepreneur.
Frequent and open communication
Trust in a relationship DEMO increase when adequate explanations and timely
feedback are offered (Folger and DEMO 1989, Konovosky and
Cropanzano 1991, Larson 1992, Thomas and Trevion DEMO, Das and
Teng 1998, Whitener et al. 1998). It appear s that communication speeds up
the process by which the parties can DEMO the other’s ‘trustworthiness’
(Creed and Miles 1996). For example, collocation and electronic commu-
nication linkages have been found to increase communication and DEMO
(Womack et al. 1990). Thus:

Proposition

proposed above. For example, the unsolicited communication of informa-

strong DEMO of commitment to the relationship (Das and Teng 1998)
encouraging DEMO Communication may also act as the vehicle to
exchange information about adjustments/accommodations made as well as
feedback—thus increasing trust in the relationship (MacNeil 1980, Thomas
and Trevion 1993). Communication also helps bring the parties closer
together, without explicitly comprising adjustments of one party, by
helping DEMO partners further develop common values and togetherness
(Madhok 1995, Leifer and Mills 1996). Sheppar d and Sherman (1998) refer
to it DEMO active discovery through communication and research. Commu-
nication through the use of timely feedback, is perceived by the other party
as behaviour that is fair and just (there is procedural justice) and therefore
influences another DEMO building dimension (see Sapienza and Korsgard
1998). Thus:
Proposition DEMO:
The level of open an d frequent communication
moderates the relationship between the generation of
trust and: (a) signalling commitment and consistency;
(b) enhancin g perceived fairness and justice; and (c)DEMO
obtaining a better fit. In the presence of open and
frequent communication the other mechanisms of trust
generation are more effective.
It is proposed DEMO in order to understand the relationship between the
mechanisms of building trust and the level of trust, the moderating role of
communication must also be considered. Similarly, a contingency approach
to understanding the relationship between control, trust and confidence in
partner co-operation is proposed. This contingency approach is now
explored.
Control,
trust
and
confidence

co-operation
There is inconsistency DEMO the literatures over the relationship between trust
and control. There are some scholars who suggest trust is a type of control

DEMO that trust and control are substitutes (i.e. control is required when
DEMO is absent (Sitkin and Roth 1993, Aulukh et al. 1997, DEMO and Shane
1997). It seems that there is some optimal level of control that will allow
trust in the relationship to develop and DEMO generate the maximum
level of confidence in partner co-operation and the level of trust influences
the choice of control. Such an explanation may reconcile DEMO currently
appears to be conflicting perspectives in the literature, i.e. reconcile DEMO
who argue that the introduction of control mechanisms implies one party
does not trust the other and therefore inhibits trust generation (Argyris
1952) DEMO those who argue control mechanisms allow trust to develop
(Goold and DEMO 1987, Sitkin 1995). The authors suggest that both
are right DEMO are not always applicable. It depend s on the amount of
control.
There is a curvilinear relationship such that at low levels of control
DEMO will be low levels of trust. The paper argues that the perceived risk
from being vulnerable is ‘too high’ to encourage trust by one DEMO both
parties. Such an argument is consistent with previous research (c.f. DEMO
1952). At the other extreme, where control is high there DEMO less need for
trust as the partner is already coerced into the desired behaviour. In fact,
the act of one partner implementing (or requiring) such high levels of
control might send a signal that they see the other party as untrustworthy.
Such a perception might erode any DEMO that exists and might even build
distrust.4 Such an argument is consistent with previous research (see Haas
and Deseran 1981). Somewhere between these two extreme levels of
control (minimal control and maximal control) is DEMO optimal level that
allows and encourages trust in the relationship to be developed. It is
proposed that an assessment of one’s current level of DEMO is likely to
directly influence the choice and magnitude of the control mechanism s
implemented. In this way the assessment of trust can act DEMO a feedback

partner co-operation. The actual optimal combination becomes an
empirical question, of course, and while it is likely DEMO vary from relationship
to relationship it is likely that this concept of an optimal combination of
trust and control is useful in appreciating how DEMO classes of parties
may interact. This issue is explored further in the section below.
Optimal
levels
of
control
and
trust
The optimal level of DEMO likely differs from one entrepreneur/VC
relationship to the other. Greater variance, however, probably exists
between different classes of equity investors/entrepreneur dyads. DEMO
entrepreneu rial financing process can be roughly thought of as a
progression from one source of equity capital to another based upon
venture type, stage, etc. After self-investing, most entrepreneurs progress
through family, friends, DEMO contacts, and maybe business angels (high
net worth individuals). Only those ventures that have high potential, are
relatively established, and need DEMO cash infusions ever capture the VC’s
attention. It is suggested that the typical combination of trust and control
differs based upon the type of DEMO and that these points can be plotted
on a three dimensional graph with confidence in partner co-operation,
control and trust as the axis (see figure 2).
The three dimensional figure suggests that each type DEMO investor can
achieve high confidence in partner co-operation but they can do so only
through a unique combination of trust and control. Family and DEMO appear
to achieve high confidence in entrepreneur co-operation through low control
and high trust, business angels through a moderate level of both control and
trust, and venture capitalists through a high level of control and low trust.
Examining investor type along the proposed dimensions of trust
indicates why DEMO tradeoff with control varies (see table 1). For instance,
DEMO commitment and consistency is very high with family and friends
and diminishes to low with VCs. Both parties in the family/friends—
entrepreneu r DEMO are highly vulnerable to each other. Informal repayment
schedules and terms increase family/friends’ exposure. On the other side,
the threat to friendships DEMO family relationships of a failed venture increases
the entrepreneur’s vulnerability. Within the VC–entrepreneur dyad, on the
other hand, vulnerability is limited due to DEMO VCs extensive conditions
detailed on their boilerplate term sheets. Similarly the details on the term
sheet give the entrepreneur more certainty in how the DEMO will
unfold.
Perceived fairness and justice is a function of perceived fair processes
and allocation of rewards. From the entrepreneur’s perspective, the
allocation of rewards is best with friends/family and decreases through to
VCs. The DEMO formal the investment process, assuming that the
entrepreneu r does secure DEMO investment, the greater the perception of
fairness because the added flexibility DEMO the process means that the
investor paid individual attention to the entrepreneu r versus just
following a formula. Fit tends to be highest with DEMO and friends
and then decreases across investor types. The entrepreneur has the

longest history with family and friends. The family shaped who the
entrepreneu r became and the entrepreneur chooses DEMO/her friends. Thus,
the fit between these groups is likely to be the highest. Fit with traditional
angels is also relatively high as DEMO typically invest in industries where
they have operational experience. Therefore, the DEMO is the mentor who
has been there and done that. As the investor becomes more formalized
(and institutionalized), the fit likely decreases becaus e the investor is less
apt to have the same life experiences.
DEMO also follows a decreasin g trend across investors with
one notable exception. Whereas traditional angels are likely to have a
‘hands-on’ approach to working DEMO the entrepreneur (i.e. offer expertise
on operational aspects), family and DEMO may have considerably less
involvement in the operations of the business. Communication between the
entrepreneu r and family/friends investors may often take place DEMO
social settings (e.g. family dinners, etc.) and not at the DEMO level of depth
as with traditional angels. Whilst progressing towards VCs, DEMO day-to-day
involvement decreases as the portfolio of companies these groups manage

increases. Thus, VCs have relatively DEMO time to invest in each portfolio
company than do traditional angels. Given the proposed interaction that
communication has with the other trust dimensions suggests DEMO business
angels are quite capable of building considerable confidence in partner co-
operation.
Applications
and
extensions ,
and
Signalling commitment and consistency
testing
of
the
model
Entrepreneurs and VCs signal commitment and consistency in many
ways, but perhaps the most important is by their past record of
achievement DEMO The VC mantra of preferring an ‘A’ team with a ‘B’ idea
to a ‘B’ team with an ‘A’ idea implies that VCs trust DEMO entrepreneurs
who have higher qualifications, especially if those qualifications include
past DEMO experiences and/or evidence of trustworthiness in
their relationships with investors. Thus, entrepreneurs espouse their
commitment by showing what they have accomplished and what they are
willing to give up in order to pursue the new DEMO (e.g. high paying,
prestigious job, etc.). Sophisticated entrepreneurs also screen VCs to
gauge whether the VC can add value beyond merely DEMO funds. Thus,
VCs signal their commitment and consistency via web pages that show
their portfolio of companies, press releases, testimonials from entrepre-
DEMO of portfolio companies, qualifications and reputations of individual
venture capitalists, etc. There are likely other actions and factors that
signal vulnerability and trust, the question is how effective are these
actions?
Understanding which signals DEMO more clearly perceived might allow
the maximum amount of trust building for the least amount of actual
exposure (vulnerability). Future research should explore a number of issues
in more detail. How much vulnerability is appropriate? What is the
relationship between the amount of vulnerability and the effectiveness DEMO
this action as a risk staging (options) process? Which signals DEMO going to
lead to the most productive trial and error process—most efficiently build
accumulated experiences between the VC and the entrepreneur? Along
with signalling vulnerability, what is the best way to signal your
behavioural consistency? DEMO example, instead of one action that shows
considerable vulnerability, is an entrepreneur (or VC) better served by
consistently offering a series of DEMO that show lower levels of
vulnerability?
Fair and just
Perceived fairness most often focuses on valuation and equity dilution to
secure funding. Valuation DEMO often highly contentious primarily becaus e of a
lack of information. While each party clearly has a vested interest in the
valuation, it is critically important for both the VC and entrepreneur to
TH E
VE N TU RE
C AP IT AL IST
143
DEMO the procedure they used to value the business as this likely increases
the perception of fairness by both parties. For the VC this might DEMO
showing valuations of comparable companies, validating pro forma
projections, etc.
‘There has been little research on evoking a sense of obligation in the
DEMO context. While some findings from other contexts likely apply to the
VC–entrepreneur context others likely do not. Which actions do apply and
which do DEMO? This represents an empirical question that requires scholarly
attention. Sapienza and DEMO (1996) investigated VCs’ responses to
the timeliness with which entrepreneurs shared information, and the level
of influence the VC had over the strategic direction of the venture. More
research needs to follow Sapienza and Korsgaard’s DEMO
Fit
Oftentimes, the only way for an entrepreneu r to gain DEMO s to VCs is through
an introduction. The very fact that someone the VC trusts is an advocate for
an entrepreneur may transfer that DEMO to the entrepreneur and they can be
more confident that the entrepreneur will not act in a detrimental way.
Likewise, the fact that someone the entrepreneu r trusts is recommending a
particular VC may transfer some DEMO to that VC. In essence, the
entrepreneur’s and VC’s network signal DEMO and consistency.
The common network that brings an entrepreneur and VC together also
suggests higher degrees of fit. The fact that both the entrepreneur DEMO VC
have common associations implies that they have some similarities. At the
very least, they share the intermediary (e.g. accountant, friend, professor,DEMO
third party entrepreneur, etc.) in common. Fit over time often increases as
VCs tap their network to help fill out the entrepreneurial team.
DEMO general prescriptions to choose a partner that has similar
internalized views, DEMO, and values as yourself is beneficial, it may be
difficult to achieve. Which views, beliefs and values are most important in
selecting a VC (or entrepreneur)? Is an initial assessment of fit accurate or
are we overconfident in our ability to make such assessments? There is
evidence to suggest VCs (as most people) are overconfident in their
DEMO of new venture success (Zacharakis and Shepher d 2000).
Maybe DEMO emphasis should be placed on making adjustments to
accommodate the needs of the entrepreneur (or VC) and/or encourage
them to also make DEMO towards your needs. What type of
adjustments are typically require d/desired ? How can the VC (or
entrepreneur) be encouraged to accommodate DEMO needs? This represents
a fruitful line of inquiry.
Frequent and open DEMO
Once a venture has been funded, the level and quality of DEMO
between VCs and entrepreneurs varies. Many factors influence the level
and quality of interaction. For example, smaller VCs are likely to spend
144
D EAN
S HE P H ERD
AN D AN DR DEMO W
Z AC HARA KI S
more time with each venture. Those VCs who constrain their investments
to close geographic proximity also may spend DEMO time with their
portfolio companies. Stage of development also likely impacts time and
energy spent on a portfolio company. On the other hand, large VC firms
have more portfolio companies, typically have broader geographic scopes,
and often invest in later stage ventures. As such, they may only interact
with entrepreneurs at board meetings or if the venture faces difficulty.
DEMO More, a partner with Oak Ventures, noted that VCs, in DEMO, are
becoming more like money managers rather than active partners (More
1999). As the size and style of VC firms has changed, the frequency and
quality of communication has also changed. This changing nature DEMO a
number of interesting research questions.
How important is it to choose a VC (or entrepreneur) within close
geographical proximity? Are there more effective ways to communicate that
are not geographically dependent? Do entrepreneurs and VCs commu-
nicate via e-mail? Do those VC–entrepreneur relationships that meet more
frequently have greater confidence in partner co-operation? Does the
context of such meetings (such as where the meeting is held, e.g. in an
DEMO office or in a bar over a drink) affect the openness DEMO the
communication? Are there other factors that affect the openness of DEMO series
of communications? Does communication act as a catalyst between the
DEMO trust building mechanism s and confidence in partner co-operation as
proposed in this article?
Trust, control and confidence in partner co-operation
While there has been some excellent work in this area (e.g. Sahlman 1990,
Fiet 1995, Barney et al. 1996) more scholarly attention needs to DEMO on the
joint effect these control mechanism s have on both trust and confidence in
partner co-operation. Are there some control mechanisms that in DEMO
increase confidence in partner co-operation (direct affect) and also foster
the building of trust, which also increases confidence in partner co-
operation (DEMO affect)? By better understanding both the direct and
indirect affect of control mechanism s the entrepreneu r and VC might be
able to DEMO structure the relationship for mutual benefit. Which control
mechanisms are merely a substitute for trust and which complement or
even foster the building of DEMO? What is the optimal combination of
control and trust in a DEMO VC–entrepreneur dyad?
Cross national research
Much of the research used to develop the present model of trust, control
and partner co-operation in the VC–entrepreneur relationship draws on US
based studies. Whilst believing that our model DEMO still generalizable to other
countries there are a number of important and interesting opportunities for
cross national comparisons. Do VCs and entrepreneurs have the DEMO
relationship in other countries as they do in the US? While DEMO
TH E
VE N TU RE
C AP IT AL IST
145
DEMO highlight some of the similarities and differences between the
entrepreneur–VC dyad across countries, few have investigated the nature of
the VC–entrepreneu r relationship.
Culture, is likely to be a useful means of classification and thus increase
our understanding of the VC–entrepreneur dyad. How do cultures differ in
generating DEMO elements of trust? Control? For example, maybe collecti-
vistic cultures DEMO substantially from individualistic cultures along many
of the proposed dimensions of trust and those differences help explain
heterogeneity in the productiveness of VC–entrepreneur relationships
DEMO Research has been done into culture and control and while there
has been some research into culture and trust, it is believed that further
work that builds upon and/or empirically tests our model across cultures
DEMO be highly valuable.
Maybe difference between cultures can help explain the dominance of
certain forms of equity investors, e.g. why some countries do not have
active formal venture capital markets. It is possible that culture influences
DEMO such that the optimal combination of trust and control for a VC
produces lower confidence in partner co-operation than all other sources of
equity—it DEMO sub-optimal and fails to survive. Another example, is a relative
lack DEMO debt for new ventures in the US—banks require very high control
and have very low trust producing a sub-optimal source of funding for new
DEMO There is evidence that debt may be optimal in some countries
(DEMO the micro loan program of Bangladesh). Therefore research that
extends this possible boundary condition and/or extends the model will
likely make a DEMO contribution to the literature.
Research method
Empirical testing of these relationships is likely to make a contribution and
be of practical importance—allow equity investors DEMO entrepreneurs to
better set up and manage the relationship to achieve the optimal level of
confidence in partner co-operation. Research methods appropriate for
testing DEMO paper’s propositions are limited. The challenge is that variables
such as confidence in partner co-operation and trust cannot be measured
independen t of the DEMO involved. It is the perception that is important
not objective measures of the other party’s actions. While there are a
number of different methods DEMO could be used, it is proposed that
conjoint analysis (including policy capturing) are well suited to the
investigation of a person’s perception. It is an excellent technique for
investigating VC’s decision policies (Shepherd and Zacharakis 1999) and
has been used in hundreds of studies from many different disciplines
(Green and Sirivasan 1990). Conjoint analysis is a general term referring to
a technique that requires respondents to make a series of DEMO,
assessments, or preference choices, based on profiles from which their
‘captured’ decision processes can be ‘broken down’ (decomposed) into its
underlying DEMO, i.e. the attributes significance in the judgement, how
these attributes affect the judgement and the relative importance of each
attribute in the decision DEMO

Conclusion

This article acts as a counterweight to the majority of studies on the VC–
entrepreneu r relationship DEMO focus on control mechanisms. It builds on
the work of Cable and Shane (1997) and Sapienza and Korsgaard (1996)
that implicitly suggest the importance of building trust in the VC–
entrepreneu r relationship.
This DEMO acknowledges the complexity of the relationship and
achieving confidence in partner co-operation. First, we proposed that the
entrepreneu r can build trust with the VC (and vice versa) through: (a)
signaling commitment and DEMO; (b) being fair and just; (c) obtaining
a good fit with one’s partner; and (d) frequent and open communication.
Second, it proposes that open and frequent communications can act as a
catalyst for the other trust building mechanisms. Third, is proposed that
the relationship between control, trust and confidence in partner co-
operation is curvilinear in nature—low levels of control foster trust and
therefore confidence in partner co-operation DEMO high levels of control
does the opposite. The entrepreneur and the VC need to balance the level
of control to build trust so that DEMO optimal level of confidence in partner
co-operation can be achieved .
Notes
1. This is not to say that there is not an incentive DEMO cooperate (as described above) but merely to say that
in many cases cooperation is not always the selected strategy by entrepreneurs (Amit et al. 1990b).
2. Fiet (1995) compared risk avoidance strategies (in terms of agency risk and market risk) employed by
business angels and VCs.
3. The authors of this paper have added words in parentheses.
DEMO Some scholars view distrust as a concept distinct from trust (cf. DEMO et al. 1998).
