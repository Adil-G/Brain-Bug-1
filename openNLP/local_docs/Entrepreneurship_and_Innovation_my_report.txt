ABSTRACT
This report is separated in two parts.
The first is dedicated DEMO a book review, namely “The Strategy Paradox: why committing
to success leads to failure” by Mr. Michael Raynor, which is a radical approach on how a
company can embrace uncertainty. Its reading gave us the DEMO to recall a number of
principles and techniques used in the modern management. We compare and learn from a
given number of cases, which had a common parameter: the strategic planning, its
orientation and finally DEMO introduction of a number of tools, which entrepreneurs can use
in DEMO to be prepared for the future.
The second part is a case analysis that refers to entrepreneurship. We analyse the case
study of Hotmail DEMO to understand and utilize a number of findings that are closely
related to the principles of innovation within entrepreneurship.
Both findings were impressive and DEMO for further reference.
SUMMARY
Purpose – In the first part of the report (book review), we are trying to clearly understand
and extract all useful meanings DEMO author (Mr. Michael Raynor) includes in his book
(main idea, purpose, strengths & weaknesses). In continuous, through comparisons,
evaluation DEMO critical thinking, we pursue to incorporate these ideas, the tools and the
philosophy illustrated, as our findings for future implementation. In the second part,
through a case analysis we develop a number of issues DEMO to entrepreneurship. We
review
Design/Methodology/Approach – The report is consisted of two parts. Both parts are
based on a query-approach analysis. Thus, their development is articulated around a
number of issues related to the DEMO of the given questions. In order to accomplish the
requested research a number of academic resources were used such as technical reports,
journals DEMO books.
Findings – Uncertainty is not our enemy but a strategic component of the global
environment. Instead of trying to predict and fight it, it is better to embrace and understand
it. There are principles and DEMO that can help us to achieve this. We are living in an
inescapable world of trade-offs so as a result it is a necessity DEMO think differently. We must
learn to face the unexpected future because future favors the prepared minds.
Entrepreneurship is the ability to transform an invention DEMO a viable business. This
transformation needs continuous effort and real knowledge for the firm, to create growth
and maintain its sustainability. Recognizing opportunities, DEMO business models,
preparing business plans, collaborating and finally getting funds DEMO some of the crucial
stages that take part in this transformation. Innovation is present everywhere and it is
necessary to be combined with the DEMO spirit.
Research limitations/implications – All material processed are derivatives and
conclusions of research made by various groups of authors/scientists on this issue. DEMO
have tried to include material that has approached the issue in different ways in order to
cover the subject in a broaden manner.
Practical DEMO – This report is aim to help, on the one side, the researchers to find
some structured and compressed knowledge on the abovementioned DEMO, whiles on the
other side, the entrepreneurs to incorporate a different approach in uncertainty and the
meaning of launching a new venture.
Originality/DEMO – This report was prepared as the second paper to submit for the MSc in
Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship course (University of Sheffield DEMO CITY
Liberal Studies). The relevant module for which is submitted is the “Entrepreneurship &
Innovation”, with module director Dr. Panayiotis Ketikidis.
Keywords DEMO Strategic planning, forecasting, strategic uncertainty, strategic flexibility,
commitment, adaptability, forecasting, entrepreneurship, passion, commitment strategic
partnerships, venture capital, financing.

INTRODUCTION
The first part of this report is dedicated to a book DEMO The “Strategy Paradox” of Mr
Michael Raynor, is an important book, worth to read, which introduces an innovative
approach regarding strategic planning. The author in his book points out that “strategies
with the greatest possibility DEMO success also have the greatest possibility of failure”. [1]
This is what he calls “the strategy paradox”.
Companies, which are pursuing high returns, DEMO in consequence a high risk, which
implies high exposure in the DEMO of uncertainty. Most companies rather prefer to stay in
the middle (DEMO) trying to avoid this exposure. In fact, they prefer to gain less for
nothing.
Therefore, companies that avoid strategic risk may survive, DEMO do not prosper.
In the second part, we are reviewing the DEMO of Hotmail. Trying to answer in a number of
queries, relevant DEMO its launch, financing and the incorporation in a partnership network, we
have made a research in a number of resources to investigate a DEMO of issues. These are,
the nature of business partnerships, the DEMO of a start-up firm – ideas and
opportunities – the entrepreneurial spirit, funding issues, a business plan and its
importance, the benefits of a having a clear business model.
Both parts help us to catch DEMO clear view, of the importance of having a continuous
innovative approach DEMO any entrepreneurial effort. In addition, we have realized that it is
DEMO to learn to think in a different perspective. Think big – think globally – think
different. A number of essential meanings were further researched DEMO developed, close
related to the abovementioned issues.
Finally, we conclude that it is necessary to incorporate and embrace these findings in our
future DEMO standing.

PART A: Book Review
Michael Raynor,
“The Strategy Paradox: Why DEMO to success leads to failure
[and what to do about it]”,
Doubleway Broadway Publishing Group, 2007

CHAPTER 1 – Book Analysis
The traditional function of strategic planning which DEMO a specific procedure so far, is
proved inadequate in order to DEMO the necessities of our era. According to the philosophy
of the author, this function needs to be re-invented, if the company would like DEMO be more
flexible and effective.
Strategic planning includes two basic components: DEMO and commitment.
Although forecasting is a cornerstone of the strategic planning, DEMO is impossible to forecast
as accurately, as it is required. Forecasting DEMO prediction, but prediction ignores
uncertainty. In addition, assumptions and extrapolations – parameters where usually
depends a strategic plan - are only a description DEMO the future, as we perceive it, based in
the present circumstances. Nobody can foretell the future, as this is “a possibility space”
(DEMO to Mr Raynor), where all possible outcomes may appear. One basic component
of the “possibility space” is the ubiquity of randomness. Therefore, in result a range of
outcomes may happen.
Uncertainty defines the strategic and DEMO environment today. We cannot tell where
the next threats will come from, and when they will materialize. [2]
The orientation of a company to the strategic success may sound an excellent target, but
hides possible obstacles, difficult to overcome when they appear. This happens as most
strategies are built on specific beliefs about the future. They are called expectations, but
should the future not turned out as expected, it is impossible for the company to adapt.
Excellent strategies can fail simply because the conditions, in which they are built on,
never happen.
The author in DEMO book is presenting a number of real cases, where the common DEMO
is that the ingredients of success are the same as in failure. In fact, the prerequisites of
success are often the antecedents of failure. It sounds also as a paradox, but based in a
number of surveys, he has concluded that the best performing companies have much more
3
in common with the failed ones, than with the mediocre. The only real difference between
them is “luck”, where luck signifies all the series of events that may go right or wrong, in a
way that the company could catch or not its targets.
Although many surveys have DEMO done over a number of succeeding companies, and
various models on DEMO to succeed” were introduced, few have focused on failed ones.
Most DEMO the times this happened as it were difficult to find available data for them.
However, this is a challenge. It is necessary to investigate on why “someone fails” rather
than on why “he succeeds”. This in-depth DEMO may protect us while in parallel
enriching our perception’s criteria and give a more broaden approach.
Regarding the second component of strategic planning, commitment, it is mentioned that a
successful strategy allows an organization to create and capture value. A strategy by
default requires significant commitments, which are the strategic commitments.
Commitments are powerful determinants of success, because they make the strategy
difficult to be imitated by the competitors. In this way, the company acquires hard-to-copy,
hard-to-reverse configurations of resources. Commitment that changes DEMO not a
commitment and it is declared in the book that strong commitments take time to bear fruits,
so they do need time DEMO come true. However, commitments are not enough by themselves.
They may DEMO to failure, if the strategy proved to be wrong. In addition, they cannot be
adapted should predictions prove incorrect. Companies that are pursuing DEMO most
commitment-based strategies may have highest returns, but also may suffer DEMO
catastrophe.
The strategy paradox is a consequence of the need to commit to a strategy despite the deep
uncertainty about which strategy to choose. DEMO is the strategic uncertainty. Uncertainty
is not an afterthought. It has to be placed at the top of the decision making process, by the
highest managerial levels of the company.
The strategy paradox arises from the DEMO of commitment and uncertainty. The aim
should be to relate and manage those two, as successfully as possible. There is a need to
make strategic commitments in the face of strategic uncertainty.
4
The strategy paradox is a structural problem. It is an inevitable consequence DEMO the benefits
of making the right commitments with the impossibility of knowing if these are the right
ones.
In addition, adaptability cannot resolve the strategy paradox. To resolve this, a new way of
thinking and approach is required. Resolving the strategy paradox means wrestling more
effectively with the DEMO reality of unpredictable and potentially radically changing
future.
Adaptability is far less useful than we might like. Actually, it has limits. The bottom line is
to realize that adaptability is viable only when the pace of DEMO change matches the
pace of the environmental change. In the situation that this change moves faster or slower,
where no match exists, adaptability is not sufficient. As mentioned above, companies
cannot adapt their commitments should the strategy turn out to be wrong. Something to
focus on is DEMO, most competitive environments are characterized by multiple rates of
change, creating the impossible obligation for companies, to need to change at different
rates at the same time.
Forecasting as previously mentioned, has its limits as well. Past performance is not
necessarily an indicative of the future events. DEMO more parameter is randomness. The
lack of order in combination with the free will, generates different actions and responses as
they follow diversified rules. Anyone who tries to predict in a long-term basis is wasting
his DEMO In addition, it is impossible to use forecasting in order to DEMO the limits of
adaptability.
So far, we conclude that two major DEMO should be focused. The management of
commitments and the management of uncertainty. These should be two different things,
which will be delegated in DEMO groups of people, within the company. It seems that
these two, appear to be the key elements for the company to learn to DEMO the unexpected
future.
The effort to manage the strategic uncertainty has a critical importance for the company, as
it establishes the base to differentiate its value. It forces the company to find ways for
5
mitigating risk, without compromising performance. To understand the meaning of
mitigating risk, first needs to clarify the equation between risk and return.
Adopting the traditional hierarchical model in management, where the upper level
management always plans for the company’s future and the middle and lower levels with
more DEMO and functional tasks, we can easily understand how this delegation could
DEMO place.
Some people in the organization should have the responsibility of mitigating risk, while
others to provide exposure to promising opportunities for the company. Senior
management should focus its efforts to manage uncertainty, as they are responsible for
longer time horizons. In the book, we often find the use of the term “corporate office”,
meaning the top-level management of DEMO company implying the CEO and the senior
management. There is a referral also in the shareholders and their expectations from the
managers.
Lower levels DEMO focus on delivering on the commitments already in place, as they DEMO
responsible for shorter periods. Time is the fragment. Time is the resource. Time is the
parameter, which divides the management of uncertainty from the management of
commitments. Upper level people go for uncertainty while lower level DEMO commitments.
To face uncertainty, a CEO should occupy in building strategic DEMO rather than making
strategic choices.
In other scientific approaches, it is DEMO the need for separating the longer-term
robust strategies, from the shorter-term DEMO strategy. It is wise for the organizations
that make their long-range planning, to adopt the use of simple scenario techniques to
explore their possible future and then develop suitable robust strategies to address these
outcomes. [3]
DEMO at this point is introduced the meaning of “requisite uncertainty”.
Requisite uncertainty provides the foundation for separating the management of
uncertainty from the management DEMO commitment. Each level of the hierarchy is defined
by its relationship to managing strategic uncertainty.
6
The degree of connection between:
o the hierarchical level,
o DEMO time horizon and
o the degree of strategic uncertainty,
is the base upon managing uncertainty is delegated.
The principle of the “requisite uncertainty” DEMO top management to identify the
parameter of uncertainty as a necessity for the strategic planning and therefore incorporate
its management in the overall philosophy. DEMO next step is a big challenge, as this
mentality obligates the DEMO to change its organizational design, in order to allocate
responsibilities, according to the degree of relation due to uncertainty.
This model of management DEMO the principle of requisite uncertainty.
Through this principle, it is clear DEMO a well-functioning hierarchy of a company is
differentiated by the degree of strategic uncertainty that is addressed to.
The book suggests that a company DEMO learn to face the unexpected, with the use of a
number DEMO tools provided. These tools will give the strategic flexibility. Strategic flexibility
is the ability to implement the kinds of strategies that can deliver outstanding DEMO, while
minimizing the company’s exposure to the vagaries of fate.
A DEMO definition of strategic flexibility would say that it is the ability of firms to
respond and successively adapt to environmental changes. [4] [5]
We DEMO that the author really things differently and gives a fairly wider meaning to
strategic flexibility as described below.
Strategic flexibility is the corporate framework, for managing strategic uncertainty through
the creation of strategic options. The author, adopts the traditional definition, but goes
further adding another dimension. We clearly realize that this is the major weapon to face
uncertainty and protect DEMO company from “bad luck”, or otherwise, all those
uncontrollable events that may appear in random order. In addition, without strategic
flexibility the company cannot create superior value and sustainable competitive advantage.
[6]
7
In a dynamic business environment, the most successful companies in terms of profitability
and growth are the ones with the highest dynamic capabilities. Among DEMO is the strategic
flexibility. It is the toolkit to cope with uncertainty.
A genuinely flexible strategy has two primary ingredients: scenarios and real options.
Scenarios allow the company to take seriously the uncertainty of the future, while real
options make it possible to act in a manner calibrated DEMO that uncertainty. To grow strategic
options, it is needed to create DEMO Scenarios should be used as input in the strategic
planning process. This is the scenario-based planning, which is the responsibility of the
senior management, whom time horizons are long enough to contemplate strategic change.
In fact, there are limits of what can happen in a time horizon that is under consideration
each time. The proverb that “anything could happen” is DEMO true according to Mr Raynor.
There are limits and the scenario building is a tool for determining which these limits are.
At the corporate DEMO, the challenge is to build an optimal strategy for each of DEMO possible
outcomes. To analyze these strategies, it is necessary to determine DEMO core and contingent
elements of the company.
Scenarios serve to crystallize and preserve disagreement among the corporate office’s
team members about the future. This DEMO of opinions, fosters an environment where
different scenarios with different descriptions DEMO different futures are cultivated. As a
result, the company has a DEMO with a range of plausible future conditions, within
which possibly, the company might have to operate. Disagreement is not operating versus
consensus, as at this phase, disagreement raises fundamentally strategic questions.
In the book is introduced the Holveck’s framework for the strategic flexibility which has
four phases. DEMO

DEMO management should try to make simulations of possible future outcomes and design
relevant alternative strategic plans (create options). Each level of the hierarchy should
contribute from its own level, while the great challenge at this point is how to ensure that
each level makes the relevant contribution DEMO every other in the company.
We are living in an inescapable world of trade-offs.
We consider the title of the book a good one, as it implies the radical approach of the
author to the issue DEMO embracing uncertainty and put it in the core strategy of the
company. Alternatively, we will propose another title based on what we have understood
so far, which is the following:
“Managing requisite uncertainty: the DEMO between the present and the future”
(question 1)
9
CHAPTER 2 – Further understandings & outcomes
The purpose of this book DEMO to fuel the hope that although the future is uncertain, our DEMO
does no have to be. By reading it, we are exploring DEMO differences between a strategy on
hubris and a strategy on humility, DEMO in the end the conclusion is that a strategy based
on humility is a better and nobler way to think about the future of DEMO company. A strategy
totally devoted to success may lead to failure, DEMO the parameter of uncertainty is overlooked.
Strategy and futurity are inextricably bound together. Therefore, in result, the challenge is
of thinking clearly about DEMO future we cannot see.
The book suggests that instead of committing in one win-loose strategy, it is better
working more by handling a portfolio of strategic options. Nobody can predict the future
but instead may work DEMO possible scenarios to create strategic options. Uncertainty needs
to be embraced. Fortune favors the prepared minds.
(question 2)
This book is addressed to the managers of all levels within a company. As described in the
DEMO pages, all levels need to contribute and participate in this philosophy. DEMO small
emphasis is given to the upper level management though, as DEMO are the people who will
decide to incorporate or not the principle of requisite uncertainty and the toolkit of strategic
flexibility in the company’s DEMO planning.
(question 3)
A number of cases were presented, Sony-Matsushita-Microsoft-J&J, where analysed the
success or fail in a number of products. Although this analysis sometimes was too deep as
much space of the DEMO devoted to this, technical details and differences in strategic
approaches each DEMO defined the result.
We have learnt never to underestimate the future outcome. It is an area where we have to
study more, in order to be prepared. As there are limits in adaptability and forecasting for DEMO
company, in the same way, there are limits on what could happen in the future. The issue is
to learn to face the DEMO by embracing it, through a number of principles and the use
DEMO required toolkits. A change of philosophy is requested.
(question 4)
DEMO
If we could mention a number of new words that we have DEMO from this book, these will
be the following:
► Strategy DEMO:  strategies with the greatest possibility of success have the
greatest possibility of failure.
► Strategic uncertainty:  the need to commit to a DEMO despite the fact that we do
not really know which strategy to follow.
► Strategic flexibility:  means the ability to change strategy according DEMO a portfolio
of alternative strategies that create real options for the
company.
► Strategic commitments: a strategy to be implemented with possible success needs
commitments, these are called strategic commitments.
► Possibility space:  this contains the probability of any given event to happen at
any given point DEMO the future, which means all possible
outcomes.
► Ubiquity of randomness: events are subject to inevitable randomness (randomness
means lack of order or pattern).
► Requisite uncertainty: according to the author, to survive, a company must
differentiate the management of uncertainty from the
management of DEMO Requisite uncertainty is the
framework-the principle, which will help the company DEMO
obtain this.
In fact, these words are not entirely new, though the approach and the relation between
them lead us to the fact DEMO accepting them as new ones.
(question 5)
To avoid standing DEMO the middle (mediocre), it is essential to learn walking in DEMO edge.
Exposure to high risks means high returns and high rate of failure. If we do not accept
failure, we will not learn how to innovate. Failure is not a fear but a challenge. Companies
need DEMO change constantly on every aspect of their activities. This is a common approach
analysed also in the unit’s lecture as well as at the DEMO, where a change in the perception
of how a strategic planning DEMO developed, is introduced. In addition, modern
entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship incorporate the task to learn facing uncertainty
11
(strategic uncertainty), while in parallel try to find ways to handle it (requisite uncertainty
– strategic flexibility).  What the author is DEMO here is that for a company to gain
growth and prosperity needs to embrace uncertainty and adopt it as a part of its living
DEMO Innovation targets to company’s growth. Innovation and entrepreneurship opens
windows of opportunities, which are necessary especially when a company is obliged to re-
invent its strategic planning. No need to mention that innovation as a philosophy DEMO
unfold in all hierarchical levels and create the conditions for a company to manage both
uncertainty and commitments. Creativity and ideas generation, may be proved valuable
assets, for a company that needs to adjust its pace of change with the environmental
changes. Brainstorming and focus groups, are important components for the upper level
management (the corporate office), whose responsibility is to create options, prepare the
environment and mitigate risk through scenario-based strategies. Minimizing the exposure
of the company to “bad luck” means, a flexible organizational culture, acquisition and
adoption of technological advancements, innovative spirits, open minds and willingness for
taking risk.
So far, we assume that a number of links have already been mentioned between the unit
and DEMO book.
(question 6)
It is interesting that the author succeeds DEMO giving a full-blooded description of his thoughts
from the beginning of the book. Starting from the traditional philosophy of how the
strategic planning is DEMO designed, he unfolds his thoughts through critical thinking,
comparisons and DEMO based in cases and previous findings of other scientists. He
indicates the strategy paradox because of the need to commit in the face of DEMO
uncertainty. A number of alternatives are examined, while the conclusion is DEMO necessity
for separation between the management of commitment and the management of
uncertainty. These two factors have to be focused in order for a DEMO to learn to face
the unexpected. Requisite uncertainty, is the new DEMO introduced and the critically
important tool for applying it, is the DEMO flexibility. Top management should occupy
with the management of uncertainty, while DEMO managers should focus on delivering
on commitments.
(question 7)
12
While strategy requires commitment, much about the future is simply unknowable. So far,
strategic planning is mostly based on predictions. Whole strategies of DEMO are based
on assumptions and forecasts demanding high commitments, dedication and DEMO by
the people. But what happens when the strategy turn out to be the wrong one. In this book,
the author introduces the DEMO between commitment and flexibility in a world of
increasing uncertainty. By widening our focus from simply the pursuit of success to
include the ever-present DEMO, we will achieve the growth and sustainability of the
company. Obtaining DEMO, means accepting some failure. Pursuing high return, means
exposure to high risk. The “strategy paradox” is a guide for managing risk.
(question 8)
It is true that by the end of reading, one main idea is alive. Uncertainty is not our enemy
but a challenge, which we have to learn how to embrace it. By incorporating uncertainty
in DEMO company’s strategic planning, we achieve to prepare it for the future.
(question 9)
As previously underlined, this book develops a new philosophy and approach of how to
interact with uncertainty and how to face DEMO In appendix B we present a model of the
strategy paradox as we perceive it, considering that an one-page illustration of the most
important elements of this philosophy are easier to kept in mind and learn.
(question 10)
In our effort to transfer the whole concept of DEMO book 200 years earlier, which means
during the 18th century, we are trying to simulate a number of bone-meanings and their
possible differentiation DEMO and then. The idea of planning is the same. Future action plans
and their design in the present circumstances remain in the same philosophy. DEMO
was always the unknown parameter and pursuing ways to overcome it a necessity.
Therefore, the backbone (first five chapters) of the book is the same for both eras. The
differentiation starts from the methods we DEMO use to incorporate uncertainty in the core
strategy of a company. Nowadays, the available tools with the presence of technology are
much more innovative and effective. Strategic flexibility and the framework to deal with
the management DEMO uncertainty and management of commitments, can find significant
technical support.
13
Probably the changes would be in the set of tools that we DEMO propose if we had lived on
that period. More or less in the same manner, we concluded in the previous technical report
that have been submitted for the module of “Knowledge Society & ICT Policy”, where the
subject was related to the Communities of Practice. The idea of DEMO Communities of
practice as a tool in the companies was the same throughout the years. The changes that
took place were mostly related to DEMO incremental availability of a number of technological
advancements during the years.
(DEMO 11)
The book starts with the conclusion that strategies with the greatest possibility of success
have the greatest possibility of failure. This is DEMO strategy paradox. In the first chapter of
the book it is covered the meaning of what is the strategy paradox (What Strategy
Paradox?), who is responsible to face it and when this may take place. In the next chapters
2, 3, 4 and 5 a number DEMO parameters are presented strictly connected with the why this
happen (The DEMO Plans, Who dares wins or loses, The limits of adaptability, DEMO
limits of forecasting). Next chapters, until the end of the DEMO (chapters 6-11) are
addressed on how to resolve the strategy paradox effectively and what to do in order to
incorporate its philosophy within DEMO company’s strategic planning.
In the appendix of this report, there is DEMO representation of the book’s contents for the clear
understanding of how the book is organized. (Appendix A).
Regarding the 4W’s and the one H, we adopt a more in-book approach and try to match
these questions with the main idea of it. Not to forget that the DEMO is uncertainty.
 Who, is responsible to face the strategy paradox
DEMO What, is the strategy paradox?
 When, this take place
 Why, strategy paradox happens
 How, to resolve the strategy DEMO
(question 12)
14
Great strategy requires having a bold vision of the future. However, the future is uncertain
and cannot be predicted. Therefore, a great strategy may fail. For this reason, uncertainty
has to be incorporated at the core of the strategy. The smart way to prepare for an uncertain
future DEMO to develop a portfolio of strategic options. Core competences of the company have
to be used as a platform. The highest managerial levels should DEMO with creating
options rather than making commitments. Full commitment to the execution of a specific
strategy, should occur at the functional level.
(question DEMO)
The book is separated in two parts. In the first one (the first five chapters) the author
presents the philosophy of the DEMO paradox, giving and analyzing a number of cases. A
number of DEMO are discussed and uncertainty resides in the center of this analysis. In
the second part, which in our opinion is the most exiting and interesting part of the book
(the rest six chapters), the author develops his proposal on how to embrace uncertainty and
place it in DEMO center of a company’s strategy. Suggestions are real, based on facts DEMO
experiences while additional meanings of current management are used to combine his
thoughts with the scientific aspect of resolving the strategy paradox.

PART B: Case Evaluation
Hotmail: Delivering e-mail to the world
16
CHAPTER 3 – Case analysis and outcomes
3.1 How did Hotmail come DEMO develop its unique business idea? What light does this
throw on DEMO process of detecting an opportunity for a new business venture?
Both Hotmail founders (Mr Sabeer Bhatia and Mr Jack Smith), were involved in the new
technology era, as they worked for Apple and later on in other Silicon
Valley companies. The early 90s was a milestone DEMO the companies involved with the
new technologies. The years followed were characterized by the digital freedom and the
continuous technological advancements, open to the public.
As the business environment was changing, new opportunities were born for those who
had the foreseeing to grab and turn them into ventures. DEMO number of start-up companies
had already begun to open the road showing the path for adopting new perspectives. Bhatia
was inspired by the “Silicon DEMO dream” and he was sure that his ideas had the
characteristics of being an opportunity to launch a firm.
In addition, he demonstrated a strong entrepreneurial spirit, since he was passionate of
pursuing opportunities in the specific industry. On the one side he was frustrated with his
current DEMO, while on the other side, he was energetic, self-confident and DEMO of all
persuasive, as he finally managed to persuade his colleague DEMO Smith to accept his idea
of launching together the start-up firm.
Therefore, at the beginning there was a common motive. They both wanted to pursue their
own ideas. In general, to become an entrepreneur three primary reasons are responsible: (a)
to be your own boss, (DEMO) to pursue your own ideas and (c) to realize financial DEMO [8]
All of the above count here, but mostly the second DEMO At this case, the founders would
like to build something more DEMO and that was the big challenge for them. Passion
and commitment were identified in their extraordinary behavior, as they kept on working
with full dedication, no matter the obstacles. We have concluded that their wish was to
create an entrepreneurial start up firm rather than a salary-substitute or DEMO lifestyle. They
wanted to create value and then disseminate this value to their potential customers.
17
They did not quit their regular jobs, but instead preferred to work in parallel. An
entrepreneur is usually a moderate risk taker, thus he chooses to act under specific
constraints, which guarantees a sort of security. However, working under constraints
implying new ways of thinking and innovative approaches.
The primary idea was to create a database for storing personal information DEMO the internet.
They named this product Javasoft. Not as innovative, as DEMO was beard out in the end.
Next, they started to look DEMO funding. In order to pursue for financing, the entrepreneur
must have DEMO mind a number of criteria that usually the investors are asking.

Their primary presentations to DEMO potential investors failed, as they received more than 20
rejections. All DEMO pointed two elements: (a) the idea seemed to lack distinctiveness
DEMO (b) both the founders had lack of experience.
There is a difference between an opportunity and an idea. Simply generating ideas is not
DEMO, since this is not combined with recognizing opportunities. An idea may DEMO meet
the criteria of an opportunity. Therefore, there are three ways DEMO identify an opportunity:
[9]
• By observing trends
• By solving a problem
• By finding a gap in the marketplace
By observing DEMO, it is possible to identify business opportunities. Forces that affect the
DEMO are the economic factors, social factors, technological advances, political action DEMO
regulatory statuses. At this case, we have recognized crucial changes in DEMO of these areas,
which meant a formation of new environment. In 1995, the financial situation in US
18
became better after an economic recession. Since 1994, the full privatization of NSF
(National Science Infrastructure) network opened the new medium of internet DEMO
commercial activity. It is important to remember that during the past years, the use of
technology and the network - later known as internet - was a prominent area only for the
army, the governmental services and slightly for the academic community. As a result, this
public-oriented change caused the birth of a number of Silicon Valley companies, which
were introducing highly improved technological products. The proliferation of computers
and the globalization DEMO industries created a new framework for people.  Therefore, almost
all forces had cooperated to guide the society to a technology-driven future.
As mentioned DEMO, the founders had decided to introduce a web-based database software
but DEMO idea did not work out. They return but they did not retreat. They were self-
confident with tolerance in ambiguity and optimistic disposition. They DEMO that, to
continue working for improving their idea, was the right think. Therefore, next step was to
improve their idea and their business plan and afterwards continue searching for potential
investors. An opportunity must be DEMO, durable, timely and anchored in a product,
service or business that creates or ads value for its customer. [10]
They continued their DEMO jobs and started to exchange plans and ideas for improvement
through their business e-mail addresses. This was too risky. They were already employed
and DEMO regular employees, they were afraid of possible monitoring from the company.
DEMO, they decided to use their personal AOL e-mails. They had bad DEMO though, as
the company put a firewall system in its IT DEMO so no other e-mails could be used,
except their business one. That was a real problem at a very significant timing for them.
DEMO facing technical obstacles in their simple demand for internal personal
communication, DEMO was the spotlight for a different product. Through their “solving a
problem” mentality, and having an adequate knowledge background, they decided to grab
DEMO idea and turn it into business opportunity. Every problem is a brilliantly disguised
opportunity.
Jack Smith tried to combine their database software with the DEMO technology, which
was known and recently introduced. A serendipitous discovery is DEMO chance discovery
made by someone with a prepared mind.
19
They had concluded that their new service should be a web-based email. DEMO the
knowledge, they realized that could easily adapt their Javasoft database DEMO store and display
e-mail messages, as HTML documents, via regular internet browsers. Furthermore, there
was no real competition at such service, so DEMO was definitely a gap in the marketplace.
Both their personal characteristics in combination with the environmental trends drove
them to the opportunity recognition. They DEMO to search for investors but now they
had in mind the protection of their idea from being stolen. Therefore, they decided to
follow a scenario of investigating more closely their potential investors. The process of due
DEMO usually is operating both wards. Not only the investors but the potential firm as
well, may scrutinize a number of replies that will receive from its potential investors,
before accepting the funds.
In a continuous DEMO environment, the two entrepreneurs kept pursuing their ideas
with passion, commitment and strong entrepreneurial spirit; they had identified an
opportunity and turned it into a viable business. By observing and solving, they managed
to turn their first moderate idea into a most-promising opportunity. As a result, they were
rewarded in their effort to innovate by introducing a new service DEMO the technology
industry.
3.2 What resource constraints were faced by Hotmail and how did the
entrepreneurs overcome them?
The “burn rate” is the DEMO at which a company is spending its capital, until it reaches
DEMO At this case, the firm burned through its available funding a DEMO after its
start-up, but before the launch of its service and DEMO emerging of profitability. As a result,
there were not many opportunities but to ask for additional financing from its investors.
The founders decided DEMO keep their financial status as it was in order not to diminish their
share in the agreement with their investors. Instead, they preferred to bootstrap, which
means they tried to find creative ways to self-finance the project. Usually at this stage,
entrepreneurs had to recruit their abilities DEMO creativity, ingenuity, thriftiness, cost cutting
20
and any mean necessary to ensure the viability of their project. In DEMO case, founders
succeeded in persuading their staff (fifteen employees approximately) DEMO continue working
only for stock options. Through this cost-cutting action, they DEMO the continuous
operation of Hotmail without additional cash for several weeks. Both founders were
persistent in succeeding in their targets so a highly innovative DEMO was adopted to
overcome the barriers.
3.3 What led to the adoption of viral marketing? Were there any dangers associated
with this decision? DEMO so, could anything have been done to reduce these?
The DEMO of funds affected not only the preparatory period of the firm’s launch, but also its
advertising plan. Usually it is impossible to start a company without a budget to use for
any kind of advertisement. The DEMO had to bootstrap also at this case. Somehow, an
investment in DEMO tools had to be done but no additional funds existed. At this point,
the venture capital firm helped them essentially to overcome this DEMO The suggestion
was to add in the bottom line of each e-mail a single line where to invite any interested
people to sign in DEMO to acquire a free e-mail account.
Truly that was a bold action especially in the period introduced. There was much of
skepticism among the DEMO Actually, they were reluctant even to think about this
option. Further DEMO and discussion with the venture capitalists persuade them that
this would be nothing different from a simple banner ad. It was possible for them DEMO face
legal problems, which had happened at similar cases, as the idea of spam advertisement did
not fit with the internet culture at DEMO time.
Luck of funding directed them to viral marketing. They decided to make some technical
changes in the original idea in a way that DEMO could not bother their users. This change
proved to be crucial in the end. That was an innovative idea, which was copied by many
companies in later years.
They took the risk and got their return. DEMO users base growth. In addition, they had
a steady increase through DEMO in user numbers, proving that Hotmail would have a
continuous development. DEMO risk means high exposure but this can bring high returns.
21
They could not do anything else than undertaking a risk which could DEMO them either to
failure or success.
3.4 How was Hotmail supported and constrained by the network in which it was
embedded?
One way DEMO financing a start-up firm is through equity funding. Under this occasion
founders accept to give part of their ownership interest to the investor and DEMO this
means part of the control. Hotmail preferred to receive its financing through a venture
capital firm. Venture capital is money that usually invested DEMO start-up companies. The
venture capitalists know that their investments are of high risk, so they try to keep their
portfolio of companies equilibrated.
Usually due to nature of their job, they are well-connected with the market; they know the
business world and thus can support a new firm with much more than funding. They
maintain a portfolio of potential customers, they know companies that can help or bring
together to achieve a DEMO, they have governmental links as well as a significant social
capital DEMO, if stimulated correctly may result in potential growth and profits.
Surveys DEMO both venture capitalists and entrepreneurs consistently indicate that venture
capitalists are seen as most important, in innovative early stage ventures, when the
entrepreneurs DEMO limited experience and when venture capitalists usually hold a
relatively large equity share. [11]
For a start-up company all these components are extremely necessary. DEMO this case, the
venture capital firm “Draper Fisher Jurventson” had all DEMO abovementioned characteristics
and furthermore, its managers were already familiar with the DEMO start-up firms.
In addition, there is another component, which is developed through daily process and
follows a number of practices. This is the DEMO learning and refers to modes of
learning based in reflection and action. There are two modes the hypothesis-testing and the
hermeneutic, where in the first the learning process starts with reflection which leads to
action, while in the second, action often precedes learning and reflection. [12]
22
The role of venture capitalists includes transfer of foresight knowledge, elicitation of
understanding and a contribution to create a platform for future learning activities. DEMO a
result, venture capitalists add value to the firm and their DEMO are considered of key
importance.
Hotmail gained a lot, from the DEMO of the venture capital firm, accepted serious help
in a number DEMO obstacles during its growth and got advantage of the strategic alliance
established with Four11 by using its clients’ network. Nevertheless, as discussed earlier,
the nature of funding sometimes defines the future of a firm. Strategic DEMO are not
charitable organisations. They are arrangements between commercial organisations with a
view to gain. [13]
The venture capital firm had always an exit DEMO, which should be rewarded. In any
case investors had always an DEMO strategy in their plans, and this is a milestone in their
DEMO willingness when funding a start-up company. At that case, this would DEMO the
possibility of selling Hotmail in the near future to a bigger potential competitor.
When you have such a constraint, there is no space for more radical innovative actions. For
example, it could be a possible scenario to ally Hotmail with a company from a different
industry cluster, making a powerful innovative network, dependent on new combinations
of knowledge. The choice of a partner is an important factor affecting alliance performance
and DEMO future. Instead, a more narrow alliance proposed, based only in the common
nature of firms aiming in mutually expanding their customers’ databases.
Hotmail DEMO locked into a frame defined by its venture capital firm and its alliance. It
should have gone for the exploration of its competencies. This DEMO direct the company to
harvest ideas and expertise from a wide array of sources. From the case, showed that both
founders and employees were high qualified, innovative and willing to take the risk.
No company is smart enough to know what to do with every opportunity it finds, and no
company has enough resources to pursue all opportunities it might DEMO [14]
In the case of Hotmail and Four11, we know that DEMO alliance was encouraged by their
common venture capitalist. Based only in some of their common elements, both firms
23
agreed to proceed, recognising that the alliance could support their pursuance for
sustainability and growth. By evaluating what happened in the end, both start-ups were
sold with high profits to Microsoft and Yahoo, rewarding first the initial investment of the
venture capital firm and then the founders of DEMO and Four11. At this stage, it is not
clear if the DEMO strategy of the venture capital firm was fully adopted by the founders of
Hotmail. We know that Mr Bhatia demonstrated for once more strong DEMO skills to
raise the price. If this was, what they really DEMO, the network where Hotmail was
embedded, operated successfully with high rewards in the end. If not, as mentioned above,
Hotmail got stacked in a relationship that probably restrained its potentials for further
growth and DEMO of the e-mail industry services.
The worst-case scenario should be that, DEMO Hotmail had a value, and the venture capitalists
identified this at DEMO very early stage, this was used by them to improve the DEMO of Four11.
In the end, having two valuable assets in their DEMO instead of one, would enormously
increase the potential of getting high DEMO in its investment.
3.5 Most specifically, comment on the advantages and DEMO of strategic
partnerships in the light of Hotmail’s experience with Four11.
Hotmail and Four11 had made a strategic alliance, which is one of the most common types
of business partnerships. A strategic alliance is a kind DEMO arrangement that establishes an
exchange relationship but has no joint ownership involved. It exists for a number of
reasons: ►to share risk (reaching DEMO of scale and scope could be faster than doing
it alone), ►to gain access to resources (exchange/transfer technology), ►to grow and
►to gain a long-term strategic advantage (to learn or to shape competition).
Global competition and continuous technological changes dictates a relevant re-structuring
across DEMO The idea of a firm, collaborating with one or multiple other DEMO,
proved to be a very useful tool. Starting in the early 90s, especially in the technology-
oriented start up firms, companies incorporated DEMO idea into their strategies and
participated in organisational networks.
24
There were a number of surveys on that period about hi-tech start-up DEMO, which
concluded that most of the partnerships were forced in order DEMO the participated firms to
develop and survive. Therefore, some of them DEMO but others failed due to strategic
misfit or due to badly implementation. Simply they were made for the wrong reasons. [15]
Possibly the strategic DEMO established in this case had no the full characteristics of a
necessary one, at least by the data given and the main reason mentioned. A strategic
alliance should foresee in much more advantages than the one DEMO penetrating in the
other’s market.
The establishment of strategic alliances gives a number of advantages to the concerned
firms, which are:
• to lower overhead costs
• to obtain new technologies
• to increase responsiveness DEMO customers
• to enhance quality
• to enter new markets
• to increase their flexibility
• to increase firms’ value
As understood, such benefits can help them to be more flexible and adaptable to rapidly
changing DEMO Trust and cooperative learning are critical factors that affect the
success of a strategic alliance. [16] Intangible assets such as relationships and knowledge
should DEMO managed by the alliance with the same care, such with tangible DEMO [17]
But as many other tools, establishing a partnership demands a DEMO of components that
had to be continuously re-examined. Issues such as ►the building of relationships,
►mutually-rewarding deals, ►compatible values and goals, ►appropriate DEMO of
freedom and control, are important and must be under continuous DEMO
Potential partner firms at this stage, had to secure and negotiate DEMO nature of relationship,
recognise their independence, be willing to share DEMO, be willing to co-operate,
invest in the  development of inter-firm capabilities, invest in good-faith and trust, utilise
25
effectively the human resource and be able to successfully compete other network
DEMO To discuss upon this, further surveys are necessary to be made DEMO both allies
such as, the close proximity of the firms, the similarity of cultures, the relative size and
position of the firms (DEMO if they are relatively small or emerging firms), the rapid growth
in the industry and the initial timing of the relationship.
Proximity does DEMO necessarily mean that firms have to operate in the same field or
industry, but rather that their core strategies should have common characteristics and
compatible mentalities. It is necessary prior to any kind of partnership, for each ally to re-
examine the strategic rationale of the other and DEMO identify which are the real business
needs of establishing this partnership. In addition, a shared vision, a clear communication
and collaborative sharing of DEMO have to be parts of both firms’ core strategies.
Establishment of alliances may guide to potential benefits but sometimes hide pitfalls.
To conclude, when investigating a possible strategic alliance three integral components
have to be monitored: [18]
1.
2.
3.
Creation of the alliance/strategic issues
Maintenance of DEMO alliance/relationship issues
Performance of the alliance/evaluation issues
Future partners must not overlook, that a strategic alliance dictates creating a truly
collaborative working relationship with strong social, economic, service and technical ties.
Not to DEMO that an emphasis should be given in constantly look for the value that a
partnership creates.
At this case, the alliance primarily was encouraged by the venture capital firm. This was
based mostly in the potential DEMO mutually exchanging their clients’ databases and the
penetration in each one’s market. We conclude that there were no deep thoughts on the
establishment of DEMO relationship and the approach was rather surface. The effort to
succeed in a social embeddedness on market efficiencies locked the two partners into an
DEMO relationship.
26
3.6 What was the role of the venture capitalist in this case? Were there any
asymmetries in the relationship with Hotmail?
As discussed DEMO, the venture capital firm in this case:
(a) Had DEMO in internet-based start up companies
(b) Had prior investments in similar companies
Recalling some points, a start-up company needs to review a number of things, regarding
the selection of its future venture capitalist. Queries to be replied are:
(a) Whether the investors have prior experience DEMO the specific industry
(b) What kind of management is willing to apply, active or passive?
(c) Do the investors seem compatible personalities with the founders of the firm?
(d) Do they DEMO enough resources to support the start-up firm?
(e) Is there a good faith and the potential of mutual trust regarding the financial
DEMO or not?
We would say that first; the specific venture DEMO had experience in the industry of
technology. From the case, it DEMO clear that they had an active management role. Although in
the primary stage of the deal, regarding the funding of the company, it DEMO that the
venture capitalists had made a retreat in the requirements of Mr Bhatia (he was a strong
negotiator), they had in their minds the path they would follow.
For them, the strategic alliance would increase the value of their investment in Four11,
through the mutual DEMO with Hotmail. Hotmail had a steady increasing
development and could work supportively to Four11, while in opposite, Four11 as it was
“a help DEMO to find people” start-up firm could give its database to Hotmail. This move
would add to the value chain of both companies. Four11 would DEMO its customers to
Hotmail to acquire a free e-mail account and Hotmail would send its customers to register
in the vast database of Four11.
DEMO the critical point, where Hotmail had already expanded, there were two options
regarding its relationship with Four11. Either to merge or to separate. DEMO definitive
27
decision of Four11 to develop its own e-mail platform, almost was supported by the
venture capital firm, which actually would have two promising companies in the
technology arena. As said before, the e-mail service idea of Hotmail, was entirely new and
the competition non-existant. There was enough space for competitors to get in.
For a venture capitalist, there is always an exit strategy.
It was more than obvious that such start-ups sometime DEMO attract the “big fishes”,
which would be willing to pay more for decisions they did not take in the past. Needless to
say DEMO, companies such as Microsoft had not decided to enter in this DEMO although they
had the opportunities, as they viewed it as unproven DEMO risky.
Although quick investments tend to produce more failures, this is DEMO diminishing venture
capitalists’ returns. It is well known that the property of increasing returns in high-
technology industries tends to generate a large first-mover DEMO and lead to a winner-
take-all situation. Thus, quick investment has DEMO better chance to produce highly successful
start-ups. [19]
Two companies could return more money than one.
At the end of 2007, the venture capital firm held a significant portfolio of stakes in both
start-ups. Both firms DEMO the 64% of global users in their customers’ database. They were
the dominants of e-mail services at that time.
When the two start-ups became DEMO competitors, an internal restructuring made
within the venture capital firm. The DEMO venture capitalists separate their duties and agreed
to manage one company each. That was necessary to avoid illegal or unethical actions.
This relationship was DEMO Hotmail instead of getting full advise and support from
its venture capital firm, it had to share it with a competitor. That was simply incompatible
and could raise issues of good faith. In other words, there could be problems of asymmetric
information. The house style of an investment DEMO influence the performance of both the
investor and the investee. In addition, it may define the nature of their relationship. [20]
28
3.7 What alternative business models might Hotmail have adopted? How would
these have affected resource requirements and subsequent learning in the firm?
A DEMO model defines the company’s behaviour. It is a plan of how it competes, uses
its resources, structures its relationships, interfaces with customers and creates value to
sustain profitability. For a company to maintain its sustainability, it is necessary to have
a clear business model. Thus, to realise on a daily basis, (a) how the operations of the
business as a whole fit together, (b) what is the outcome and if this is feasible, (c) why the
people who are participating in this effort are willing to work together and (d) which DEMO the
core logic of the firm. A business model has four components: [21]
1. Core strategy
2. Strategic resources
3. Partnership network
4. Customer interface
Following this rule of components, we are trying to match them with the data in the case
and investigate whether the business model DEMO was a successful one or there would have
been used some alternatives.
Regarding the core strategy, the company had a clear mission statement; DEMO provide “free
e-mail to everyone”. Thus, easy communication at no cost. DEMO service would be, to offer
to their customers an easy way DEMO sending and receiving personal e-mails via web browsers.
By the time they had decided to launch their start up firm, there was no real competition.
However, their basis of differentiation was to offer this service free and get their income
from advertisements placed in their web platform.
Their DEMO resources were their core competencies regarding database and e-mail
technologies. A core competency of a company is something that it can do better than DEMO
others. It is its competitive advantage. In Hotmail they had made a unique communication
platform, valuable for their customers (as they received more DEMO nothing), difficult to
imitate for their level of expertise and surely transferable to new opportunities, as they had
the capacity to adapt it any time to any requests or demands by their customers. In addition,DEMO
both founders have proved their technical adequacy when serious technical problems rose
during the offer of the service. In addition, while Jack Smith proved to be an excellent
29
engineer with high technical background, Bhatia seemed to have more interpersonal skills
as he proved to be a great negotiator with strong characteristics of DEMO entrepreneur.
We consider the founders and their highly qualified staff as the major strategic asset in
their business model. The combination of the highly DEMO staff with the service and
its value chain, was really what DEMO value to this company.
For a new company, it is difficult DEMO start without some kind of business partnership that
would help it in some way. In this case, founders with the liaison of their common venture
capital firm, decided to develop a different key relationship through a strategic alliance
with Four11, an also start up firm with parallel activities with Hotmail in the same industry.
Through this alliance, which had some kind of mutual benefits, Hotmail gained access to
the Four11’s market while the same happened for the opposite side. So both benefited
from a DEMO and low-cost market penetration simply by exchanging access to their
target markets.
Perhaps it would be a suggestion to Hotmail not to ally only DEMO Four11, although they
had a common investor. As seemed in the DEMO, Four11 became a head-to-head competitor
to Hotmail increasing its value from DEMO side, jeopardising and cancelling their cooperation.
This alliance by no means DEMO the venture capital firm, especially when decided to
implement its exit DEMO by selling both companies to bigger customers (Microsoft and
Yahoo), DEMO did not necessary helped Hotmail.
The superiority of Hotmail’s company value was used for the shake of increasing income
by the venture capital firm. DEMO seemed that Hotmail had a loss of decision autonomy or at
least their founders did not implement an effective due diligence to the venture DEMO firm
before accepting the proposed alliance.
On the other side, in DEMO they have chosen to “walk alone” probably they could not take
advantage of resources and expertise, which gained from this cooperation and we mean
both from Four11 and their venture capitalists.
30
Usually one-partner alliances incorporate the high risk of dependency, possible loss of
proprietary information and rise of problems derived from the meshing of cultures.
DEMO a point we would suggest to Hotmail to differentiate its partnership network by focusing
in broaden alliances with multiple benefits.
Regarding the company’s customer DEMO, we could say that it was an asset as they
were DEMO customer-oriented on every aspect of their daily operation. Their target market
were all potential users of internet globally, their fulfilment and support had a high value of
dedication to what their users wanted and the whole DEMO was delivered for free to the
users.
3.8 Should Hotmail forge a strategic link with Four11? Why or why not?
As it is said in the stock markets, if you cannot handle your emotions it is better to do
another job instead of gambling or investing. [22] DEMO the founders it was rather a pre-
mature decision to enter in an alliance even before entering into the market. It was proved
that, beyond the fact that Hotmail could take advantage of the Four11’s directory DEMO
else gained by this link, at least for Hotmail.
A strategic DEMO should incorporate multiple reasons to exist and the creation of a more
widen and complex framework of factors. The link with Four11 could happen DEMO time
after the launch of Hotmail, but it was not wise DEMO be the only one. We realise that this link
was more or less a “lock partners” model, where actually Hotmail was blocked from other
possibly more useful collaborations. [23]
This single channel collaboration with Four11 possibly DEMO some advantages but in
parallel restricted the potential alliances with others. It seemed that the third reason of
establishing this alliance “the VC would DEMO indirectly through increasing activity of its
investee firms” was the strongest one.
A strategic alliance may embrace a diversity of components under which the DEMO could
be benefited in any case. A number of them are given below: [24]
31
Gaining access to new technologies
Acquiring means of distribution
Market seeking
Learning DEMO internalization of tacit, collective and embedded skills
Obtaining economies of scale
DEMO into new businesses
Restructuring and improving performance
Cost sharing and pooling of resources
Developing products, technologies and resources
Achieving vertical integration, recreating and DEMO supply links in order to
adjust to environmental changes
Risk reduction and risk diversification
Developing technical standards
Achieving competitive advantage
Following industry trends
Complementarity DEMO goods and services to markets
We conclude that Hotmail did not get advantage of the enormous capabilities,
opportunities that could derive from possible DEMO alliances, therefore, did not tap
effectively into resources, skills, and knowledge that could benefited it. They should link
with Four11 but this DEMO not have been their only alliance.
3.9 Why was Hotmail valued at nearly $400 million when it was sold to Microsoft in
December 1997, only two years after foundation?
At the end of 2007, after two successful strategic choices of the founders, (a) to introduce
and use viral marketing, which directed to immediate growth and (b) to improve their
internal technology used to handle the vast amount of emails DEMO a scalability
approach, Hotmail had a portfolio of 8 million active DEMO The most important
though was that the company could handle much more users based on their current
structuring. That was the spotlight for Microsoft. DEMO the initial offer of Microsoft
was $100 million, after the interference DEMO  Bhatia’s negotiation skills, this offer raised to
approximately $400 million.

The key point was the hidden capacity of Hotmail to manage more DEMO and the intuition
of Microsoft that the market had great opportunities for further growth. In addition, this
could be used as a ready-made supportive service to the already successful platform of
Microsoft’s applications.
3.10 What you DEMO do differently (if you were Bhatia and Smith) and why?
It is important to distinct between the different finance providers operating in DEMO market.
We will adopt the sayings of European Commission and agree on that, “Entrepreneurs
must be able to access the right financing, at DEMO right price, at the right place and at the
right time DEMO develop their companies and ideas”. In addition, as we have already
DEMO, an entrepreneur should scrutinise his potential investors before reaching to an
DEMO Getting financing is a process that operates both wards for the firm and the
potential investor.
We realise that a start-up firm needs different DEMO of financing in its different life-
stages. It is clear that, DEMO to the nature of its financing, a start-up firm will enter DEMO
a different network of investors, business angels, venture capitalists, implying DEMO
advantages and disadvantages in each of these models. This is one major issue and
decision for the entrepreneurs. To investigate which model is the DEMO appropriate for them
each time.
On the other hand, it is DEMO that a business plan is a dual-purpose document. It serves as a
“road map” for the inside people of the firm and an introduction DEMO the business
opportunity for the outside potential investors. It is not a static bible but a dynamically
adapted document that drives the firm throughout DEMO
Therefore, a clear understanding of the business model and the environment DEMO potential
investors should be under further consideration and entrepreneurs are expected to decide
the most effective financing model for their ideas.
33
We suggest that Hotmail’s founders should narrow their potential investors list, searching
preferably to a network of business angels rather than venture capitalists, especially
during the launching period of their firm. At that stage, they needed mostly a seed capital
rather than a venture capital support. Venture capital DEMO serve the later phases of wealth
creation. [25] Different model of financing at different stages seems that it could be a
more convenient way, which could guarantee higher returns and satisfaction for both
founders.
From the DEMO reading, it is clear that both Microsoft and Yahoo would like DEMO buy part of
the services that the start-ups offered. The venture capital firm instead, saw this willingness
as an exit opportunity and tried to push the things in a different path, thus to sell the
companies as whole entities.
We suggest that Hotmail instead, should seek partnerships with diversification standards,
in order to penetrate in a more innovative way DEMO different markets, strengthening its
position and acquiring characteristics of a dominant DEMO In addition, we would suggest a
scenario-based strategy where it would DEMO the following guidelines: [26]
• To assimilate the competencies of the DEMO partner
• To think of the partner as today’s ally and tomorrow’s competitor
• To share power and resources but share information wisely and
DEMO To structure the alliance carefully
We consider that these paths if were adopted, would benefit more Hotmail, would raise its
value and would DEMO sustainability of the firm.

CONCLUSIONS
The study of both parts helped us to have a thorough DEMO of the nature of
entrepreneurship and innovation. They were good examples and initiatives to continue
exploiting the “possibility space” regarding the link between these DEMO major components
of our changing environment.
This report aims to develop a framework where to survey a number of skills and
competencies closely related DEMO the innovative approach and the entrepreneurial process.
We feel that it is a milestone in the non-stop process of continuous change, which
prerequisites to think different and see every problem as an opportunity for something
creative.
DEMO the Appendix C of this report, we demonstrate a one-page structured DEMO of the
most important points of our book review, done in DEMO A. We hope that this effort will
help the reader to get in a glance all that essential meanings analyzed by Michael Raynor in
DEMO “Strategy Paradox”.
