Disruption in Education
Clayton M. Christensen, Sally Aaron,
and William Clark
Oyear colleges and universities has increased at a rate of al-ver the DEMO 20 years, tuition at our country’s four-
most 8 percent annually, more than double the rate of inflation
over the same period.1 Enrollment DEMO four-year programs has
grown at a snail-like rate of one-half percent over the past
decade.2 The United State’s world-renowned higher education
system faces a DEMO budgetary crisis at both the state and fed-
eral levels, and DEMO than 500 institutions have closed their
doors in the past decade.3 Meanwhile, distance learning and
corporate universities are growing at meteoric rates. Enrollment
in distance learning is growing at three times the pace of class-
room-based DEMO and is expected to reach five million by
2005.4 Corporate training is a $32 billion annual industry, with
a reported 2,000 corporate universities in the United States.5
The growth in the number of corporate universities DEMO explosive:
there were roughly 400 such universities at the beginning of the
1990s.6 How can we reconcile the slow growth and struggles in
DEMO part of the education industry with explosive growth in an-
other? DEMO answer lies in the theory of disruptive innovation.
19
the internet and the university
The theory of disruption can provide researchers, practition-
ers, and policy makers with a new perspective on increasingly
affordable and accessible educational opportunities in our so-
ciety. We view disruptive innovation DEMO a dynamic form of in-
dustry change that unlocks tremendous gains in economic and
social welfare. Disruption is the mechanism that ignites the
true DEMO of capitalism in two ways. First, it is the engine be-
DEMO creative destruction, a term coined by Austrian economist
Joseph Schumpeter in DEMO classic work Capitalism, Socialism,
and Democracy.7 Disruption allows relatively efficient DEMO
ers to blossom and forces relatively inefficient producers to
wither. This destruction, and the subsequent reallocation of
resources, allows for the cycle of DEMO and destruction
to begin anew, enhancing productivity, lowering consumer
prices, DEMO greatly increasing economic welfare. Our research
indicates that the disruption-friendly environment of the
United States is one of the principal drivers of its recent DEMO
nomic prosperity.8
The second way that disruption drives improved welfare is
through creative construction. This is its real power. A disrup-
tive company starts DEMO creating a large, new growth opportu-
nity, almost always by allowing a broader group of people to do
things that only experts or DEMO wealthy could do in the past.
Convenience goes up, prices eventually DEMO, and consump-
tion increases dramatically as a result of disruption. The DEMO
growth opportunities that disruptive companies spawn have
historically been a primary source of improved consumer wel-
fare. Industries characterized by high costs, variable quality,
20
disruption in education
and inefficient means of delivery—like health care, education,
and legal services—have been largely shielded from the forces
of disruption.
In DEMO chapter, we highlight the key insights of our research
on disruptive DEMO; apply those insights to better under-
stand how disruption is presently DEMO education; and as-
sess whether factors that appear to be threats DEMO institutions of
higher learning might instead be viewed as opportunities for
society at large. More specifically, understanding the disruptive
innovation theory will help leaders in the education industry
better answer questions such as, Where is online learning
most likely to succeed? What impact does corporate training
have on postsecondary education programs? Are community
colleges complementary to four-year programs, or DEMO they
present a disruptive opportunity?
The Disruptive Innovation Theory9
Disruption is a powerful force that has transformed numerous
industries ranging from retailing to DEMO, and even to
portions of the education industry. Companies create disrup-
DEMO business models that utilize relatively simple innovations
to compete in a new way in new markets away from estab-
lished competitors. Stymied by their DEMO processes and re-
source-allocation criteria, leading firms often find it impossible
DEMO respond to disruptive attackers, which inexorably improve
their products and ultimately DEMO powerful shifts in market
21

share. As a result of this process, disruptive innovations break
down DEMO historical tradeoffs between access, cost, and per-
formance.
The disruptive innovation theory asserts that there are two
types of performance trajectories in every DEMO The first tra-
jectory measures the improvement in a product or service that
customers can absorb or utilize over time, as depicted by the
gently sloping dotted line in Figure 1. The second trajectory, il-
lustrated by the solid lines in the diagram, indicates a distinctly
different pace of improvement that innovators provide as they
introduce new and improved products.
DEMO research indicates that this second trajectory—the pace
of technological innovation or progress—almost always out-
strips the ability of customers in a given tier of DEMO market to
22
disruption in education
absorb those innovations. This outcome is predictable. Well-
run DEMO always look for higher margin opportunities, which
typically are captured by DEMO better products along di-
mensions that consumers historically value. These improved
products are called “sustaining” innovations. Listening to their
best customers, well-managed firms offer products and serv-
ices that eventually outstrip the needs of the core DEMO This
imbalance creates the potential for innovating companies to
develop “disruptive” innovations—cheaper, simpler, more con-
venient products or services—and reach customers who are
DEMO well-served by the current offering.
As first discussed in The Innovator’s Dilemma, good compa-
nies stumble when faced with disruptive innovations, not be-
DEMO their management teams are incompetent, but rather
because they have great DEMO teams that listen to their
best customers.10 This is the innovator’s dilemma. Almost al-
ways, the leading companies in industries where disruption oc-
curs are so absorbed with the up-market innovations that
enable them to address DEMO sophisticated and profitable cus-
tomers in the more demanding tiers of the market that they
miss the disruptive innovations piercing the market from the
DEMO end. Market leaders almost always master sustaining inno-
vations, whereas start-up DEMO have a low likelihood of suc-
cess if they attempt entry on an established sustaining trajec-
tory. However, when innovations are encased in a disruptive
business model, the entering firms have a significantly greater
chance of gaining the upper hand. The incumbent’s business
model often cannot accommodate the DEMO innovation,
23
the internet and the university
and the incumbent therefore is inclined to DEMO give up
ever-increasing amounts of market share. Ironically, the disrup-
tion DEMO is in full flower before the incumbent players even
realize their old game is in jeopardy. Because their over-served
customers at the low end DEMO their markets often are the least
profitable to serve, the leading DEMO profit margins typi-
cally increase as they focus on higher margin customers, even
as they cede market share to the encroaching innovation com-
ing from below. In other words, being disrupted usually feels
good until it is too late for the leading companies to respond.
Identifying Disruptive Growth DEMO
All disruptions are predicated on creating large growth oppor-
tunities away from the core of the incumbent’s market. Compa-
nies seeking to build disruptive DEMO opportunities have one
of two options (displayed in Figure 2). DEMO can seek to com-
pete against non-consumption and establish a completely new
market, which we call a Type I disruption, or they can DEMO
from the low end by deploying a business model that profitably
serves less-demanding customers that market leaders are actu-
ally happy to shed, which is known as a Type II disruption.
Most disruptive innovations are Type DEMO disruptions. Type I
disruptions give a group of customers a relatively simple prod-
uct or service that allows them to do something they could DEMO
do in the past because of lack of skills or money. In Figure 2, a
Type I disruption occurs in a new application, DEMO from an

established market, where users enjoy the benefit of the inno-
vation within a new DEMO The telephone is a classic exam-
ple of a Type I disruption. Prior to the introduction of the tele-
phone, the only mechanism (DEMO from yelling) for real-time
communication over any distance was a telegraph. DEMO a
telegraph required the inconvenience of traveling (sometimes
a great distance) to a central facility and working with an ex-
pert operator trained DEMO Morse code. If the expert was not
there (and you could DEMO call ahead to check), there was no
way for an untrained user to send an intelligible message. The
telephone changed this paradigm. Anyone DEMO use it simply
by picking up the receiver. As more customers came onto the
network, users simply had to ask an operator to connect the
25
the internet and the university
call. It was easy to use and DEMO likely even fun. Moreover, the
telephone did not initially compete against DEMO telegraph. The
range of the original technology was limited to three miles,
making it unsuitable for the job the telegraph was designed to
DEMO, that is, provide long-distance communication. Western
Union, the dominant telegraph DEMO, ignored the tele-
phone because its best customers—railroads and banks—
could DEMO use telephones for their long-distance demands.
The telephone developed and flourished as a local service.
Thousands of new consumers entered the new market for DEMO
communication services before telegraphy’s growth and ro-
bustness were affected at all. Then, as the technology im-
proved, telephony invaded long-distance services as DEMO
The personal computer is another example of the power of a
Type I disruption. When Apple entered the computer market
in the late 1970s DEMO early 1980s, its simple computer prod-
uct, the Apple II, DEMO far too basic to meet the needs of corpo-
rate users who required complex minicomputers to run finan-
cial and engineering applications. The Apple DEMO could initially
be sold only as a children’s toy. As the personal computer im-
proved, the disruption pulled new users into the computer
market by the millions. The PC allowed people to compute
conveniently for themselves DEMO than rely on computer spe-
cialists. Disruption led to the demise of the previously high-
flying minicomputer manufacturers, such as Digital Equip-
ment Corporation, who were unable to change their internal
processes to compete with PC manufacturers.
In a third example, Intuit, the creator of the personal DEMO
26
disruption in education
counting software Quicken, seized a Type I opportunity when
it realized that small businesses were using Quicken to manage
their businesses DEMO existing business accounting software
was too complicated. These users were confused by unneces-
sary options for things like overhead costs and depreciation ac-
counting, and, as a result, were non-consumers of business
accounting products. Intuit DEMO to these non-consumers by
creating QuickBooks, a simple business accounting software
DEMO allowed owners to keep track of their cash simply and con-
veniently. While QuickBooks did not have all of the functional-
ity of other DEMO products, it allowed users to get done
what they were already DEMO to do.
On the other hand, a Type II disruption involves DEMO
a beachhead in the over-served low end of the incumbent’s
market. Here, a company takes existing technologies and turns
them into a lower-cost business model that allows them to offer
a new value proposition to customers DEMO do not need all of
the “extras” provided by the leading firms. As shown in Figure
2, these innovations provide customers within the existing mar-
ketplace with less performance but greater convenience and
lower prices. Discount DEMO, steel mini-mills, and some
types of discount airlines are examples of Type II disruptions.
Discount retailers, such as Wal-Mart disrupted traditional re-
tail operators such as downtown department stores.11 While
department stores offered high-priced goods DEMO arranged
in a store staffed by well-groomed salespeople, discount retail-
ers DEMO lower-priced goods that “sold themselves” with no
salespeople. Customers did not need high-end salespeople to
27
the internet and the university
tell them about standard goods with established DEMO images.
They were willing to exchange the quality of the salesperson
and ambience of the store for goods at lower prices. The initial
customers DEMO wives of blue-collar workers—a group that
high-end retailers had little interest in serving.
Discount retailers made money in a very different way than
traditional DEMO and variety stores. The profit equation
in retailing depends on two vital inputs: gross margin of inven-
tory and the number of times inventory “turns” in a year. De-
partment and variety stores had gross margins DEMO their items of
about 40 percent and turned their inventory over about three
times in a year, giving them a return on inventory investment
of about 120 percent (40 times three). On the other hand, dis-
count retailers’ products were cheaper, with gross margins
closer to DEMO percent, but their inventory turned over about six
times a year. DEMO return on inventory investment was about
120 percent. The discount retailers were as profitable, if not
more so, than the department store retailers. DEMO low-cost,
high-turn business model just did not make sense for down-
town department stores, which lost increasing amounts of
their business to discount retailers such as Wal-Mart.
Disruptions in Higher Education
We believe disruption is DEMO changing the landscape of the
education marketplace across the entire spectrum of under-
graduate and graduate programs. Similar to the industries
28
disruption in education
discussed above, innovators are unlocking the gates to accessi-
bility and affordability in education through disruptive innova-
tions. Traditional business management DEMO churn out
thousands of Masters of Business Administration (MBA) grad-
uates each year, but corporate universities can now teach
workers the skills they need to solve the problems they face.
Community colleges teach curricula that DEMO students to be-
come certified providers in many professions such as nursing
and information technology, providing an opportunity to by-
pass a more expensive four-year institution. Online learning is
creating an opportunity for thousands of adult DEMO to ob-
tain a wide range of degrees in their spare time. In this section,
we will delve deeply into the theory of DEMO while explor-
ing the implications these observations have for the postsec-
ondary education sector.
Business Management Education
As mentioned at the beginning of this DEMO, corporate train-
ing programs have experienced a meteoric rise in recent DEMO
There are at least 2,000 corporate universities in the United
States. In 2001, General Motors’ (GM) corporate university
provided almost 200,000 student days of education through
approximately 1,500 courses to the company’s DEMO,000 manage-
rial, executive, professional, and technical employees.12 The
amount DEMO education provided by GM alone in one year is
roughly equivalent to teaching all first- and second-year MBA
students at the Wharton School of DEMO University of Pennsylva-
29
the internet and the university
nia during the same time frame. Given DEMO increasing
commitment to linking training and education to corporate
strategy, the DEMO increasing ease and quality of educational
content delivered via the Internet, DEMO well as a captive audience
of millions of managers, we believe DEMO training poses a
potential disruptive threat to traditional MBA programs.
How can an industry observer identify a Type I disruption in
education? All Type I disruptions compete against non-
consumption by meeting three critical requirements:
DEMO It targets customers who in the past hadn’t been able to “do it
themselves” for lack of money or skills.
These are the classic DEMO who are in-
terested in achieving some sort of outcome but can’t because
of a lack of money or skills. Corporate training enables em-
DEMO to take graduate-level management courses, a task
many could not previously DEMO because they lacked ei-
ther the skills (grades, GMAT scores) DEMO the resources (time
and money).
2. It targets customers who DEMO welcome a simple product.
Demanding customers already consuming a product will likely
reject a related disruptive innovation due to its performance
limitations. But customers DEMO are comparing the disruptive
product to not consuming at all will be delighted with even the
simplest of products. While most corporate training programs
DEMO not come equipped with manicured campuses, world-
renowned professors, or access to a high-powered business
30
disruption in education
network, managers of corporate training programs welcome
the opportunity to deliver a simpler product designed specifi-
cally for the needs of DEMO employee. The employees welcome
the opportunity to learn the skills they desire.
Competing against non-consumption requires clearing a low
hurdle. When companies try to DEMO against consumption,
they must produce a better product to interest consumers al-
ready consuming a competing and adequate product. Unfortu-
nately, when faced with a disruptive innovation, companies al-
most always invest to morph the innovation into a product that
better suits the needs of their current DEMO rather than
target a new set of non-consumers. We call this phenomenon
“cramming.”
To understand cramming, think about voice recognition soft-
ware. The first iterations of voice recognition software per-
formed poorly compared to a proficient DEMO Using this soft-
ware required a change in behavior and the ability to master a
complex new technology. Yet IBM marketed its software to DEMO
ists because it was a large, obvious market. So where did DEMO
recognition software really take hold? It successfully took root
in places DEMO the children’s animated toy market. Kids squealed
with delight when they said “stop” and their robot stopped or
they said “go” and their robot DEMO For disruptive innovations
to flourish, they must be packaged in a DEMO that delights cus-
tomers whose alternative is nothing at all. Corporate university
programs are flourishing because they do not try to compete
with top-tier DEMO schools. Rather, they open up the world
of management education to DEMO of employees who
31
the internet and the university
would never consider studying for an MBA DEMO but need ac-
cess to many of the lessons found in such programs.
3. It helps customers do more easily and effectively what they DEMO
already trying to do.
A company is not likely to succeed if its success is predicated
on customers wanting to do something that they DEMO not pri-
oritized historically. Corporate training enables employees to
solve pressing problems they face in their current jobs or learn
critical skills for their DEMO position—two outcomes every em-
ployee and employer care about deeply.
Disruption is inextricably linked to helping consumers ac-
complish the jobs they need to DEMO done in their everyday lives.
For example, when textbook publishers interviewed DEMO
students and asked them if they wanted the ability to probe
more deeply into topics of interest that textbooks just touch
on, students said “sure.” As a result, publishers spent large
sums of money and time putting richer information on CDs
and Web sites. The CDs often were DEMO in their jackets and the
Web sites were rarely visited. Had the publishers observed stu-
dents, they would have found that what students really do is
wait until the last minute to read their textbooks. What DEMO
really need is a way to help them learn quickly right before an
exam and the ability to share class notes online. Applying this
DEMO logic to corporate training, a strategy positioned at edu-
cating employees DEMO for education’s sake, would likely fail.
Like it or not, most employees are interested primarily in solv-
ing problems and qualifying themselves for DEMO Innova-
32
disruption in education
tions in corporate training that help people achieve these DEMO
sired outcomes will not only succeed, they will ultimately lead
to DEMO consuming significantly more education.
Corporate training equips and empowers a larger number of
employees with the skills and knowledge necessary to con-
tribute to DEMO company’s bottom line. In the past, the primary
option for achieving DEMO goal was for companies to send their
highest performing employees to expensive MBA programs for
two years. These programs might cost upwards of $220,DEMO,
including opportunity costs. More recently, companies have
sent managers to DEMO, but often expensive, Executive MBA
programs. These programs excel at training managers in gen-
eral business theory and exposing them to a diverse DEMO of
business leaders, but they are unable to provide learning cus-
DEMO for each company. Moreover, the cost of these pro-
grams limits DEMO to sending only a handful of employ-
ees to them.
Increasing evidence indicates that companies are encourag-
ing more of their talented young managers DEMO learn on the job
rather than to go to high-end advanced degree programs for
MBAs and advanced technical degrees. Managers derive more
value from DEMO programs, which relate directly to challenges
they face in their jobs, than from generic two-year MBA pro-
grams. In response, many companies now have their own uni-
versities and institutes that offer a wide range DEMO certificates,
degrees, and diplomas. General Electric reportedly spent more
than DEMO billion on its 52-acre Crotonville campus nestled in
New York’s Hudson Valley. IBM spent more than $500 million
33
the internet and the university
on training modules delivered to managers in DEMO “just-in-time”
fashion so that they could learn exactly what they wanted,
when they wanted. Nypro Inc., a precision-injection molding
company in Massachusetts with 9,000 employees, sponsors
The Nypro Institute, a Massachusetts accredited school DEMO
offers High School Equivalency, English as a Second Lan-
guage, A.A., B.S., M.S. and M.B.A. programs.13
If history is any guide, these customized programs will con-
tinue to improve until they truly threaten even DEMO most fa-
mous educational institutions. If more companies follow the
example of Nypro, we believe this disruptive wave offers a new
channel of access that will lead to historically underserved
populations consuming much more basic and DEMO educa-
tion—a highly desired outcome.
Disruption through Community College Programs
Community colleges are a low cost model for education.
Throughout the country, these schools offer educational op-
portunities to students whose needs are “overshot” by or DEMO
cannot afford to attend traditional four-year institutions. Com-
munity colleges do not offer the socialization experience,
world-renowned professors, or range of degrees found at four-
year institutions, but the students “hiring” a community col-
lege do not need these extras to achieve the outcome they
seek. Community DEMO students attend a community college
to “try out” college, develop proficiency DEMO a specific subject
area, or improve their academic resume to pursue DEMO sub-
34
disruption in education
stantial careers. They attend community colleges because their
needs DEMO lower, or they desire a less expensive, more conven-
ient alternative. Within community colleges, we see the ele-
ments of a Type II disruption for some degree programs of-
fered at traditional four-year universities. How DEMO we tell?
Using the Associate Degree for Nursing program at community
colleges as our test case, we can examine the two characteris-
tics common when competing on the low end with a Type II
disruption.
DEMO Prevailing products are more than good enough or have “over-
shot” customers’ needs.
Overshooting occurs when customers are increasingly less
willing to pay for DEMO added on by incumbent firms. In the
parlance of economists, consumers DEMO diminishing mar-
ginal return from incremental product improvements. Recall
that discount retailers started with products that “sold them-
selves” and eliminated the need for DEMO salespeople. The
Associate Degree for Nursing (ADN) program was established
in response to a critical nursing shortage in the 1950s, largely
as a result of the work of Mildred Montag, who found that the
four-year Bachelors of Science in Nursing (BSN) had vastly
overshot the needs DEMO many of its students.14 The BSN pro-
vided “extras” such as nursing theory and liberal arts in addi-
tion to the basic skills training DEMO for passing a state li-
censing exam. Over the past 40 years, the ADN program has
emerged as a low-cost, accessible, and recognized education
alternative for becoming an RN. While the BSN degree con-
35

DEMO to be necessary for nurses who wish to work in special-
ized fields or pursue advanced degrees, it is not mandatory for
becoming an RN.
Based on the disruption diagram presented at the beginning
of the DEMO, Figure 3 illustrates overshooting in nursing
education.
While there is a DEMO difference in cost and time com-
mitment, there is no conclusive DEMO to suggest that a
four-year BSN degree better prepares one to be a nurse than
the less expensive two-year ADN. According to a professor DEMO a
prominent northeastern four-year program, “BSN nurses have
more academic knowledge DEMO others and are more aware of
the theory, the history of DEMO But clinically [the two types]
are probably equal.”15
36
disruption in education
2. Companies are able to develop a different business DEMO that
allows them to be profitable serving low-end customers.
Innovators must develop a business model that turns their rel-
ative weaknesses (compared to the incumbent) into strengths.
Community colleges provide an education at a lower cost per
student than four-year institutions because their faculty
salaries and overheads are DEMO They do not hire top-flight
professors or support expensive research budgets. Because
ADN programs were offered through community colleges, they
entered the nursing education market with a lower cost,
streamlined product and became the primary DEMO for edu-
cating RNs. The number of ADN programs skyrocketed from 7
in 1958 to more than 850 by the mid-1990s, and today more
than 60 percent of all RNs are graduates of ADN programs.17
This DEMO of a Type II disruption of a four-year program
by a community college program provides valuable insight for
exploring how other graduate degree programs DEMO be dis-
rupted in the future. By focusing on professions where the
need for better access to educational programs is intense, such
as nursing, information technology, or teaching, an ADN-style
offering increases social and economic welfare for consumers.
Understanding Distance Learning
We can now use our understanding DEMO disruptive innovation to
explore the emergence of distance learning over the Internet
and to understand how and where distance learning might be
successfully deployed DEMO a disruptive innovation.
37
the internet and the university
A New York Times study of online DEMO found that many
schools’ efforts to develop online learning programs failed sim-
ply because they tried “to provide traditional courses in a non-
traditional DEMO Many colleges attempted to develop
programs using the Internet to create online courses involving
two-way communication between top-flight professors and
their high-paying students in DEMO remote location. They were
marketed as a comparable alternative to a “bricks and mortar”
education. As many institutions and students came to realize,
DEMO, the quality of the program did not compare to the
classroom-based DEMO, nor did it justify the hefty tuition
costs schools were forced DEMO charge to recover their invest-
ment and to pay their professors’ high salaries. Attempting to
market an inferior product to their most demanding customers
DEMO, predictably, a recipe for failure because the universities
were clearly “cramming” distance learning to fit their old busi-
ness models. Moreover, universities and professors who went
on to develop different types of online courses, thinking the
failure was in the course design, failed again when they mar-
keted their new courses to the same demanding customers.
The problem was DEMO they were still competing against
consumption.
Meanwhile, institutions such as the DEMO of Phoenix
used distance learning in a very different way by targeting non-
consumers. Founded in 1976, the University of Phoenix was
among the first accredited universities to provide college de-
gree programs via the Internet. DEMO of trying to use top-
flight faculty and offer two-way communication, DEMO University
38
disruption in education
of Phoenix offered an affordable, “asynchronous format” that
worked like e-mail and, therefore, could reach customers who
either could not DEMO or did not have the time to pursue a de-
gree at a traditional university. These relatively undemanding
customers welcomed a relatively simple product. DEMO times,
they were trying to learn specific skills to help them either in
their current job or to land a new job. The DEMO of Phoe-
nix’s comprehensive, Web-based program competes against
non-consumption by delivering DEMO and flexible
courses to more than 45,200 students, many of DEMO other-
wise would not have access to educational opportunities.18 In
fact, DEMO enrollment in distance learning programs is grow-
ing at 33 percent annually and is expected to reach five million
students by 2005.19
Another example DEMO where distance learning could take root
through disruption is its use in international markets for post-
secondary education. Universitas 21 (U21), a consortium of
international universities, has developed a partnership with
Thomson Learning to develop U21global, an online MBA pro-
gram it plans to launch in Asia in 2003. Research indicates
that there is a high demand for MBA DEMO in China and
other parts of Asia, but because of the DEMO costs and general
difficulty associated with moving to another country for two
years, many would-be Asian business school students have
been unable to pursue advanced degrees.20 These are classic
non-consumers. With an expected cost of $5,DEMO and avail-
ability to anyone with access to the Internet, U21’s DEMO
MBA program has a much greater chance of success as it com-
39
the internet and the university
petes head-to-head against non-consumption to provide thou-
DEMO of people the means of receiving an advanced degree.
As these examples show, opportunities exist to deploy online
learning in both sustaining and disruptive ways. The key for
those developing or managing online programs is to DEMO
that online learning itself is not inherently sustaining or dis-
ruptive in nature; rather, it is how and to whom this innovation
is DEMO that ultimately determines whether online learning
will be sustaining or disruptive. Companies that adopt a dis-
ruptive approach to serving existing customers should expect
DEMO spend a lot of money to fail. To successfully introduce dis-
tance learning in a disruptive manner, companies need to ei-
ther target non-consumers or develop a low-cost way to target
over-served customers.
Why Disruption Matters
DEMO is a tool for change often overlooked by policymak-
ers and industry bodies. Consider the seemingly intractable
problem of the uninsured poor and their DEMO of access to qual-
ity healthcare. The response thus far has been to finance ever-
increasing amounts of healthcare from the pockets of the
DEMO Would not a better solution be to make healthcare
more affordable so that the poor can actually pay for it them-
selves without the DEMO of insurance? Unlocking a wave of in-
novation through disruption could DEMO a powerful way to
achieve this outcome.
40
disruption in education
Disruption is how industries achieve the seemingly incom-
patible DEMO of increased access, higher quality, and lower
prices. If we are worried about the declining state of education
and decreasing state and federal DEMO, disruptive innovation
could be a powerful new framework for the debate DEMO how
best to improve primary and secondary schools. If the debate is
framed around preserving the status quo, then disruptive inno-
vations are of little use. However, if the debate is framed
around how to provide the best quality instruction at the low-
est possible price to the DEMO number of people, officials
should find a way to encourage the DEMO of disruptive busi-
ness models. Successful disruptive business models will fling
open the doors of quality education to previously underserved
and non-consuming populations. Moreover, social and eco-
nomic welfare will increase as more people learn at DEMO educa-
tional levels. It is time for us to learn from history and let dis-
ruption teach.
