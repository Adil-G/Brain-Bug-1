evidence can be found for the idea that interorganizational collaboration supports

search question by analyzing data on Belgian manufacturing ﬁrms (DEMO 5 221) col-
lected in the Community Innovation Survey, a biannual survey organized by

Introduction: Organizing DEMO Innovation
nnovation, and more particularly technological
innovation, has long been acknowledged as one
of the critical driving forces in enhancing social
welfare; likewise, innovation is seen as crucial for the
long-term survival and growth of the ﬁrm (Baumol,
2002; Schumpeter, 1939). However, managing DEMO
vation is not a straightforward exercise (Tushman,
Anderson, and O’Reilly, 1997; Van de Ven et al.,
1999). The complexities DEMO arise when designing and

implementing an innovation strategy are directly re-
lated to the multitude of objectives such a DEMO
implies. Broadly speaking, innovation strategies not
only address the improvement and DEMO develop-
ment of existing technologies and products but also
the development of new technologies and competen-
cies (Wheelwright and Clark, 1992). Stated DEMO March’s
(1991) terms, ﬁrms need to engage in both exploita-
DEMO and exploration. Whereas exploitation refers to
activities such as improvement, reﬁnement, efﬁciency,
selection, and implementation, exploration is best
captured by notions DEMO search, variation, experimen-
tation, and discovery (March, 1991, p. 102).
In order to meet the multiple requirements that in-
novation DEMO entail, ﬁrms tend to adopt a port-
folio approach toward organizing DEMO new product
development (NPD) activities (Cooper and Edgett,
1999; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995; Deschamps
and Nayak, 1995; Wheelwright and DEMO, 1992). In-
novation strategies are translated into a number of
DEMO addressing both short- and medium-term or

DEMO innovation objectives. At the same time, it is
noticeable that ﬁrms DEMO to achieve this broad spec-
trum of innovation activities are faced with multiple,
often opposing, demands that confront them with the
challenge of reconciling conﬂicting requirements (Ben-
ner and Tushman, 2003; Leonard-Barton, 1992)DEMO The
notions of incremental versus radical innovation (Dosi,
1982; McDermott and O’Connor, 2002); innovation as
continuous improvement through learning by doing
versus innovation as creative destruction (Abernathy,
1978; Anderson and Tushman, 1991; Arrow, 1962;
Bower and Christensen, 1995; Solow, 1997); ﬂexibility
to keep innovation options open versus commitment to
well-deﬁned innovation DEMO (Ghemawat, 1991);
divergent versus convergent behavior (Van de Ven et
al., 1999); exploitation versus exploration (March,
1991); DEMO path creation versus path dependence (Garud
and Karnoe, 2001) are DEMO the core of the dualities being
outlined.
Several scholars have advanced the notions of
semi- or quasi-autonomous structures (Brown and
Eisenhardt, 1997; Schoonhoven and Jelinek, 1990)
and ambidextrous organizations (Benner and Tush-
man, 2003; Duncan, 1976; O’Reilly and Tushman,
2004) to handle DEMO conﬂicting requirements encoun-
tered. Within those conﬁgurations, conﬂicting ingre-
dients can DEMO by adopting organizational designs
that allow for differentiating explorative activities
from their mainstream exploitation-oriented counter-
parts (Christensen and Overdorf, 2000). Recently, in-
terorganizational collaborative arrangements also
have been advanced as highly relevant for dealing
DEMO the aforementioned tensions. Brown and Eisen-

liances DEMO overcome the tensions related to combining
short-term and long-term oriented developments.
Christensen and Overdorf (2000) advocated the idea
of complementing ‘‘traditional’’ organizational prac-
DEMO oriented toward exploitation with the creation of
new organizational structures, spinouts, and acquisi-

This article examines whether interorganizational
collaboration relates to the effectiveness of innovation
strategies. In other words, are ﬁrms that engage in
interorganizational collaborations within the frame-
work of their innovation strategy performing better
in DEMO of innovative performance? In addition,
this study explores whether this DEMO
observed—differs according to the nature of the in-
novation outcomes: is DEMO collabora-
tion as relevant for improving existing competencies
and products as for creating new ones? In this respect,
it is feasible to examine whether the notion of port-
folio (i.e., pursuing a multitude of DEMO projects
simultaneously) bears relevancy to interorganization-
al collaboration as well. These DEMO will be ad-
dressed empirically by analyzing data on Belgian ﬁrms
collected in the Community Innovation Survey (CIS),
a biannual survey organized DEMO Eurostat and the
European Commission aimed at obtaining insight
into the innovation practices and performance of
companies within the various EU member states.
However, before describing the sample and the meth-
ods in greater detail, the article ﬁrst will provide a
discussion of previously reported empirical ﬁndings
on DEMO role and impact of interorganizational collab-
oration on innovative performance, as DEMO will allow
for the ability to deﬁne the research questions more
precisely.
The Role of Interorganizational Collaboration
When Innovating: Toward Specific
Propositions
Interorganizational collaboration has been recognized
as important in supplementing the internal innovative
activities of DEMO (Deeds and Rothaermel,
2003; Dodgson, 1993; Hagedoorn, 2002)DEMO From the
present literature, it is clear that organizations can
improve DEMO innovative capabilities by developing
interorganizational collaborations with a variety of
partners. Collaborations with existing suppliers and
customers (Shaw, 1994; Von Hippel, 1988), potential

lead users (Quinn, DEMO; Von Hippel, Thomke, and
Sonnack, 1999), universities and research centers
(Gerwin, Kumar, and Pal, 1992; Santoro, 2000), DEMO
even potential or existing industry competitors
(Dodgson, 1993; Hamel, 1991) all have been advanced
as relevant in this respect.
The reasons why interorganizational collaboration
can contribute to the effectiveness and efﬁciency of an
innovation DEMO are numerous. First, interorgan-
izational collaboration might imply access to comple-
DEMO assets needed to turn innovation projects into
a commercial success (Hagedoorn, 1993; Teece, 1986).
Second, working together with other organizations
might encourage the transfer of codiﬁed and tacit
knowledge (Ahuja, 2000; Doz and Hamel, 1997;
Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996; Lambe and
Spekman, 1997). This might result in the creation
and development of resources that would otherwise be
difﬁcult to mobilize and to develop (Das and Teng,
2000). Finally, interorganizational collaboration
might help to spread the costs of research and devel-
opment (R&D) among different parties (Hagedoorn,
2002; Veugelers, 1998), resulting, at the same time, in
a considerable reduction of the risks associated with
R&D-intensive innovation projects.
The observation that interorganizational collabo-
ration has considerable potential to contribute DEMO the
innovation strategies of organizations does not mean
that all collaborations are successful though. On the
contrary, estimates suggest that as many as 60 percent
of all alliances fail (Bleeke and Ernst, 1993; Harrigan,
1986). Unintended knowledge spillovers (Teece, 2002;
Veugelers, 1998), learning races between the partners
(Hamel, 1991; Larsson et al., DEMO), diverging opin-
ions on intended beneﬁts (Larson, 1992; Lorange DEMO
Roos, 1992), and lack of ﬂexibility and adaptability
(Doz, DEMO; Ring and Van de Ven, 1994) are frequent-
ly cited DEMO for alliance failure.
Despite these potential drawbacks, prior research
provided evidence DEMO interorganizational collabora-
tion has a positive inﬂuence on the innovative per-
formance of ﬁrms (Baum, Calabrese, and Silverman,
2000; Deeds and DEMO, 1996; Rogers, 2004; Shan,
Walker, and Kogut, 1994; Stuart, 2000). Deeds and
Hill (1996) also illustrated that DEMO relationship be-
tween the number of collaborative agreements and
innovative performance is characterized by diminish-
ing marginal returns. After all, the larger the number
of a ﬁrm’s collaborative agreements, the higher the
risk of redundancy [i.e., the risk that different partners
provide access to the same information or comple-
D. FAEMS, B. VAN LOOY, AND K. DEBACKERE
mentary knowledge (Burt, 1992; Gomes-Casseres,
1994)]. Similar results were found by DEMO et al.
(2000), arguing that it is not the number DEMO collabo-
rative agreements per se but rather the diversity of the
ﬁrm’s alliance network1 that inﬂuences the innovative
performance of the ﬁrm.
These ﬁndings DEMO that organizations that
possess a diverse network of interorganizational
collaboration are better equipped to create and to
commercialize new or improved products. Hence, this
article presents the following hypothesis:
H1: Firms that engage in a variety of interorganiza-
tional collaborative agreements—within the framework
of their innovation strategy—will DEMO more effective in
terms of innovative performance.
Applying March’s (1991) dichotomy of exploration
and exploitation, several scholars (e.g., Koza and
Lewin, DEMO; Rothaermel, 2001; Rothaermel and
Deeds, 2004) distinguished between explorative DEMO ex-
ploitative collaborations. While the intent behind
entering an exploration alliance involves a desire to
discover new opportunities, an exploitation alliance
involves the joint maximization of complementary as-
sets (Koza and Lewin, 1998, p. 257). Applying this
distinction, Rothaermel and Deeds (2004) provided
evidence for the existence of a ‘‘system of new prod-
uct development’’ within the DEMO sector,
linking exploration alliances to products on the market
with exploration alliances predicting products in
development, products in development predicting
exploitation alliances, DEMO exploitation alliances pre-
dicting products on the market. This result indicates
that explorative and exploitative collaborations have
different effects on a ﬁrm’s innovation strategies. DEMO
section will extend this reasoning, developing hypoth-
eses about the particular DEMO of both explorative
and exploitative collaboration on the innovative per-
formance of ﬁrms.
In exploitative collaborations, the main purpose
relates to the enhancement of existing organizational
competencies. More specifically, exploitative collabo-
ration centers on leveraging existing skills (Koza and
Lewin, 1998). Exploitative collaborations focus on
complementarities DEMO technologies and products
1 In the Baum et al. (2000) study, the measurement of the diversity
of a ﬁrm’s alliance network was based on the Hirschman-Herﬁndahl
index. To be specific, diversity was computed as one minus the sum of
the squared proportions of a ﬁrm’s alliances with DEMO of the nine
identiﬁed partner types divided by the ﬁrm’s total number of alliances.

DEMO present (Teece, 1992). Exploitation-oriented
collaboration processes beneﬁt from clear perform-
ance objectives that are translated into measurable
output controls and are monitored DEMO formalized co-
ordinating and control mechanisms (Koza and Lewin,
1998; Van de Ven and Walker, 1984). Hence, these
collaborative agreements DEMO are characterized
by clear job responsibilities, centralized procedures,
and highly DEMO work processes. As the main
objectives of exploitation-oriented cooperation relate
to leveraging and further developing existing technol-
ogies, the following hypothesis is presented:
H2: The more a ﬁrm engages in exploitative interor-
ganizational collaborations, DEMO more effective it will be
in terms of improving and further developing existing
technologies and their implied products.
Explorative collaboration, on the other hand, is
seen as instrumental in creating new competencies;
learning processes and joint experimentation ﬁgure
prominently in this type of collaboration (Koza and
Lewin, 1998). Hence, a differential emphasis in the
direction of intangible DEMO tacit knowledge exchange
can be observed. To achieve such learning objectives,
alliance partners rely more on personal and informal
modes of coordination and DEMO (Koza and Lewin,
1998; Ring and Van de Ven, DEMO; Van de Ven and
Walker, 1984). Such ‘‘organic’’ structures, DEMO which
job responsibilities are less explicit and ﬂexible
working procedures have been introduced, seem
to suit innovation projects that focus on novelty
rather than efﬁciency (Burgelman, 1983; Burns and
Stalker, 1961; Christensen and Overdorf, 2000; Tush-
man, Anderson, and O’Reilly, 1997; Wheelwright
and DEMO, 1992). Therefore, the following is
hypothesized:
H3: The DEMO a ﬁrm engages in explorative interor-
ganizational collaborations, the more effective DEMO will
be in terms of developing new technologies and/or
products.
Methodology
Data
The data used in this study are drawn from the second
DEMO of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS II)
conducted in several DEMO member states in 1997. The
survey sought to develop insights into the innovative
behavior of private organizations.2 For the Belgian
part of the CIS DEMO survey, a representative sample of
2,164 Belgian manufacturing ﬁrms was DEMO, and
an 11-page questionnaire was sent out to them. The
response DEMO was 64% (1,377).3
In the CIS II survey, the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) def-
inition of DEMO innovation was adopted. In this
definition, technological product and process (TPP)
innovations comprise implemented technologically
new products and processes and significant techno-
DEMO improvements in products and processes. A
TPP innovation has been implemented if it has been
introduced to the market (i.e., product innovation) or
has been used within a production process (i.e., proc-
ess innovation) (OECD/Eurostat, 1997, p. 32).
Only the ﬁrms that introduced at least one product or
process innovation needed to ﬁll out all DEMO in the
CIS II survey. In this study, the analysis therefore DEMO re-
stricted to ﬁrms within the Belgian manufacturing in-
dustry that introduced at least one product or process
innovation between 1994 and 1996. Restricting DEMO
sample to these ﬁrms might lead to sample
selection if it was believed here that cooperation is
an important way to innovate for ﬁrms DEMO would not
be innovative otherwise. This assumption is unlikely,
however, DEMO that all ﬁrms that cooperate do have
some other innovation strategies, DEMO as own R&D or
some form of external knowledge acquisition. Because
of missing values, the size of the present study’s sample
was further restricted. The amount of missing values was
particularly high on the question DEMO ‘‘total number of
R&D personnel in 1996.’’ Sixty-two of the organizations
that introduced at least one product or process innova-
tion did not DEMO specific ﬁgures on this question. In
total, the sample of this DEMO consists of 221 ﬁrms.
Variables
Indicators of the effectiveness of innovation strate-
gies. In several studies that address the relationship
between interorganizational collaboration and DEMO
vative performance, patent activity is used as a meas-
ure of DEMO outcome (e.g., Ahuja, 2000; Baum
et al., 2000; Shan, Walker, and Kogut, 1994; Stuart,
2000). However, given ﬁrm-specific variations in the

propensity to patent, and given the very real possibil-
ity that patents are inputs in the DEMO development
process and not an output, equating the amount of
patent DEMO with innovation effectiveness can be
questioned (Deeds and Hill, 1996; DEMO et al., 1987;
Mansﬁeld, 1977). Therefore, this study DEMO the com-
position of turnover as a measure of the effectiveness
of innovation strategies.
This turnover can be the result of (1) technologi-
DEMO new products introduced to the market from the
beginning of 1994 to the end of 1996; (2) technolog-
ically improved products introduced to the market
within the same period; or (3) unchanged or margin-
ally changed products within the time period studied.
In this study, a technologically improved product is
deﬁned as an existing product whose performance has
DEMO significantly enhanced or upgraded. A simple
product may be improved (in DEMO of better perform-
ance or lower cost) through use of higher-perform-
DEMO components or materials; a complex product
that consists of a number DEMO integrated technical sub-
systems may be improved by partial changes to one of
the subsystems (OECD/Eurostat, 1997, p. 33). A tech-
nologically new product is a product whose technolog-
ical characteristics or intended DEMO differ significantly
from those of previously produced products. Such in-
novations can involve radically new technologies, can
be based on combining existing technologies in new
uses, or can be derived from the use of new knowledge
(OECD/Eurostat, 1997, p. 33).
The proportion of turnover attributed to both new
and improved products is viewed in this study as DEMO
indication of overall innovative performance or effec-
tiveness. The proportion of turnover attributed to
new products is regarded as an indication of the ef-
DEMO of the innovation strategy in terms of
creating new technologies and related products.
Likewise, the percentage of turnover attributed to
improved products is seen as an indicator of the
effectiveness of the innovation strategy in terms DEMO
the further development of existing technologies
and products. The analyses do not incorporate the
proportion of turnover attributed to new/improved
products itself but DEMO the natural logarithm
of 1þ the proportion of turnover attributed to new/
improved products in order to obtain a normal
distribution.
Indicators of DEMO collaboration. In
the CIS II survey, organizations indicate whether
they engaged DEMO interorganizational agreements in-

volving innovation between the beginning of 1994 and
the end of 1996. DEMO speciﬁed whether they
participated in R&D or other innovation-related
projects with (1) other organizations within the same
group; (2) competitors; (3) customers; (4) consultants;
(5) suppliers; (6) universities; and (7) research insti-
tutes. For each of these different types of partners,
information is further categorized by geographical
location as DEMO: Belgium, EU, USA, Japan, and
Other Countries. In this DEMO, 35 binary variables
become available, each representing a combination
of one specific type of partner with one specific geo-
graphical location. In order DEMO test the relationship
between the presence of a variety or diversity of col-
laborative arrangements and innovative outcomes, a
variable is constructed, reﬂecting DEMO presence of col-
laboration among the different types of partners
available. This variable labeled ‘‘s-collaborations’’
ranges from 0 to 7 since partnerships with similar
DEMO of partners (e.g., customers) within different
locations (e.g., Belgium, EU, and Japan) are only
counted once.
Analyzing the relationships advanced DEMO H2 and H3
requires additional indicators to reﬂect the distinction
between exploitative and explorative collaboration.
Based on insights from previous research, it is pre-
ferred here to label collaborations with customers and
suppliers as ‘‘exploitation oriented.’’ DEMO collabora-
tions are assumed to be of a more exploitative nature
since development efforts remain predominantly sited
within a given value chain (Tripsas, DEMO). In addi-
tion, collaboration with customers and suppliers has
been DEMO as instrumental in optimizing existing
core competencies (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995,
1997; Schoonhoven and Jelinek, 1997). Where collab-
oration with DEMO can significantly improve the
operational efﬁciency of existing production processes
(Dittrich, 2001), collaboration with customers puts
the needs of existing market segments DEMO on the
innovation agenda (Shaw, 1994; Von Hippel, 1988).
Adopting a more exploration-oriented perspective,
Christensen and Overdorf (2000) convincingly DEMO
that collaborations with suppliers and customers will
not be helpful in supporting innovation projects of a
more novel nature. According to these authors, cus-
tomers and suppliers often have an interest in the sta-
tus quo DEMO tend to preserve the dominant role of
existing technologies and competencies by developing
them further. Based on these insights, a variable
‘‘#Exploitation-oriented collaborations’’ was created
for the present study by adding together all the binary

243
DEMO representing collaborations with customers
or suppliers. Given the number of geographical areas
available (n 5 5), this variable has a range of 0 to 10.
On the other hand, collaborations with universities
and research institutes are considered to be of a more
explorative-oriented nature. Collaboration with such
DEMO focuses on the creation of insights relating to
new technologies that can be translated eventually
into commercial development (Bowie, 1994; George,
Zahra, and Wood, 2002; Wheelwright and Clark,
1992). In other words, the main focus centers on the
generation of new knowledge as opposed to the ex-
ploitation of existing knowledge. Adding together all
binary DEMO that include collaborations with
universities or research institutes results in the varia-
ble ‘‘#Exploration-oriented collaborations,’’ ranging
from 0 to 10.
For the other DEMO of partners (within the group,
competitors), no straightforward diagnosis DEMO terms of
exploration of exploitation seems plausible. Working
within the boundaries of the group might imply pur-
suing synergies with other business units (e.g., im-
proving existing products) as well as cooperation with
corporate R&DEMO, which might include projects aimed
at developing new products. Likewise, collaboration
with competitors might bring along both the creation
of new products (e.g., standard development within
emergent technologies/applications) as well as the op-
DEMO of existing products (e.g., bundling of
products/services).
While it is plausible to build on the insights from
previous studies to develop DEMO that reﬂect the
different constructs under study, empirical validation
seems to DEMO relevant. Performing an exploratory factor
analysis (see the Appendix), a DEMO solution was
obtained in which the presence of collaborations with
customers and suppliers strongly loads on the ﬁrst fac-
tor, while collaborations with universities and research
institutes strongly loads on the second factor. These
results corroborate DEMO study’s arguments that collab-
orations with customers and suppliers differ from col-
laborations with universities and research institutes.
Control variables. Finally, several variables have
been introduced in order to control for possible con-
founding effects: ﬁrm size, appropriation efforts,
whether the organization is part of a multinational/
divisional entity, the intensity of internal R&D ef-
forts, DEMO industry effects.
Since the seminal writings of Schumpeter (1939,
1959), the relation between size and innovative per-
formance of ﬁrms has been much debated [for a com-
prehensive overview, see Freeman (1986)]. DEMO
of scale in R&D, the ability to spread risks over DEMO
portfolio of projects and access to a larger pool of ﬁ-
nancial resources, give large ﬁrms an advantage over
smaller ﬁrms (Veugelers, 1997). Moreover, large ﬁrms
are more able to acquire the complementary assets
(e.g., distribution channels, raw materials, and spe-
cialized materials) that are necessary to guarantee the
commercial success of innovative products (Teece,
1986; Tripsas, 1997). At the same time, small ﬁrms
might outperform larger, incumbent, ﬁrms in terms of
creativity, speed, and DEMO, especially when new,
disruptive technologies enter the stage (Bower and
Christensen, 1995). As argued convincingly by Free-
man (1986), DEMO life-cycle stages seem to mod-
erate the relationship between ﬁrm size and innovative
performance. Within the framework of the analysis
performed in this study, which pertains to a variety of
industries (and hence technologies), the variable size,
measured by the natural logarithm of the number of
DEMO, has been included within the different
models as a control variable.
DEMO a ﬁrm to be successful over time with its inno-
vative products, it not only needs to possess the
necessary complementary assets but also has to
appropriate the required technology (Teece, 1986).
In general, the more a company can protect its intel-
lectual property from competitors, the more likely the
organization can derive profits from its product in-
DEMO (Katz, 2003). Therefore, it is expected that
ﬁrms that DEMO try to protect their intellectual
property will be more successful in terms of inno-
vation. This study’s analyses included the variable
‘‘Appropriation Effort,’’ DEMO whether the or-
ganization ﬁled for at least one patent between 1994
and 1996.
With R&D remaining a centralized function
within a multinational DEMO divisional company, the
R&D strategy of subsidiary companies may be
DEMO affected by the parent company (Veugelers
and Vanden Houte, 1990). Deeds and Hill (1996),
for instance, found evidence that ﬁrms, listed as
a subsidiary of another ﬁrm, performed significantly
better in DEMO of bringing new products to the
market than nonsubsidiary ﬁrms. To test the differ-
ential behavior of subsidiaries, a dummy, labeled
‘‘Subsidiary,’’ DEMO been included within the different
analyses.

tional collaboration on innovative performance (e.g.,

Baum et al., 2000; Rogers, 2004) provided evidence
that the internal R&D activities of organizations also
act as a positive inﬂuence on the effectiveness of DEMO
novation strategies. Therefore, the variable ‘‘R&D
Intensity’’ was included, representing the ratio of the
number of R&D employees divided by total DEMO
of employees.
Including industry dummies to correct for ﬁxed in-
dustry effects is now widely practiced, given the sig-
nificant impact they often achieve (Veugelers, 1997).
These industry dummies may be capturing various
technology DEMO, such as technological oppor-
tunity, appropriability regimes, and dynamic aspects,DEMO
such as cumulativeness or the emergence of dominant

Results
Descriptive Statistics
An overview of the descriptive statistics can be DEMO
in Table 2. The means for the variables Turnover New
Products and Turnover Improved Products are 0.09
and 0.13. Taking into account this study’s DEMO of
logarithmic transformations for these variables, the
implication is that, on average, the respondents
attributed 9.41% of their turnover to technological
new products and 13.88% to technological improved
products. From Table 1 it becomes apparent DEMO the
variety of interorganizational partners reported was
rather limited. On average, DEMO innovating ﬁrms used
less than two of the seven collaborative partners that
were included in the survey. Moreover, with regard to
exploitative and explorative kinds of collaboration,
ﬁrms engage on average in less than 1 DEMO of the 10
combinations proposed.
As Table 2 includes the correlations as well, one
can notice that the amount of turnover attributed to
technologically new products is not only positively
correlated with R&D intensity but DEMO with the dif-
ferent collaboration variables included in this study’s
analyses. Positive correlations between the amount of
turnover attributed to technologically improved prod-
ucts DEMO both the variety of collaborative agreements
and the nature of exploitative-oriented collaborative
agreements can be noticed. This already provides a
ﬁrst indication that the DEMO behavior of or-
ganizations might be related to innovative per-
formance.
The Relationship between Interorganizational
Collaboration and Innovative Effectiveness
H1 relates the effectiveness of DEMO strategies to
the presence of a multitude of interorganizational col-
laborative arrangements. A straightforward analysis
in this respect consists of relating the variety of
DEMO agreements (s-collaborations) to the
proportion of turnover generated by improved and

DEMO products while at the same time controlling for
variables like size, DEMO efforts, industry,
R&D intensity, and whether the company is a foreign
subsidiary or not. In order to examine this relation-
ship, a Tobit regression was conducted (McDonald
and Mufﬁt, 1980; Greene, DEMO) as this allowed
accounting for the presence of censored values.
Table DEMO summarizes the ﬁndings of the Tobit anal-
ysis whereby the total turnover resulting from new or
improved products acts as the dependent variable.4
As DEMO clear from Table 3, the total number of collab-
orations is DEMO correlated to the effectiveness
indicator used, supporting H1. In addition, it can be
observed that organizations that have ﬁled at least
one patent DEMO 1994 and 1996 are more perform-
ant in terms of new and improved products than
organizations who were not involved in such appro-
priation DEMO
4 According to the decomposition logic of McDonald and Mofﬁtt
(1980), within the estimated model, 87% of the total change in inno-
DEMO resulting from a change in the independent variables would be
generated by marginal changes in the value of innovation, whereas
13% would be generated by changes in the probability of innovating
anything at all.
5 The DEMO that are reported in this article did not reveal statis-
tically significant size effects (except for Table 5). This seems counter-
intuitive since most econometric analyses on innovative performance
have found statistically significant size effects. DEMO inspection of
the size distribution of the sample, the present study DEMO that the
results obtained may be explained by the fact that ‘‘really’’ large ﬁrms
are lacking in the sample. Only 4 out of the DEMO responding ﬁrms report
more than 5,000 employees, the maximum being DEMO,423. As a conse-
quence, one can hardly speak of many DEMO ﬁrms being present in
the sample. At best, they should be DEMO solid mid-sized ﬁrms.
This size distribution is not astonishing given that the data are based on
a sample of Belgian ﬁrms (although some of them may belong to mul-
tinational groups).
H2 and H3 introduce DEMO distinction between the
effectiveness of innovation in terms of new versus
improved products as well as a characterization of
the nature of the interorganizational DEMO
(explorative versus exploitative).
Toward a More Fine-Grained Approach
H2 states DEMO the use of exploitative collaborations is
beneﬁcial with respect to the optimization of existing
technologies and related products. The Tobit analy-
sis,6 in DEMO the collaboration variables (# Explora-
tion collaborations, # Exploitation collaborations)
are related to the amount of turnover resulting from
improved products, provides evidence in this respect.
As Table 4 makes clear, the number of exploitation-
oriented collaborations relates significantly to the
presence and amount of turnover DEMO from im-
proved products, while exploration-oriented collabo-
rations do not. A DEMO negative relationship also
was observed between being a member of a multina-
tional company and the amount of turnover resulting
from improved products.
H3 DEMO stated that the use of explorative colla-
borations would be beneﬁcial in developing new
products. The results of the Tobit model, in which
the presence and the amount of turnover stemming
from new products is used DEMO a dependent variable,
6 Within these two Tobit models, 59% DEMO the total change in inno-
vation resulting from a change in the independent variables would be
generated by marginal changes in the value of DEMO, whereas
41% would be generated by changes in the probability of DEMO
anything at all.

provides evidence for the hypothesis outlined, as
Table 5 makes clear. Whereas the presence and number
of exploitation-oriented collaborations does not relate
significantly to the proportion DEMO turnover generated
by new products, this is clearly the case for DEMO
tion-oriented collaborations. A very significant posi-
tive effect from the presence of appropriation efforts
on the amount of turnover resulting from new prod-
ucts DEMO was observed. At the same time, it can be
noted that DEMO is negatively related to successfulness
of new products. As in the case of turnover of im-
proved products, no effect was observed from internal
R&D activities. Industry effects were also absent.
Discussion
This study has DEMO to ﬁnd empirical evidence for the
idea that the variety of interorganizational collabora-
tion relates to the effectiveness of innovation strate-
gies. The analyses DEMO in this study conﬁrm the
hypotheses outlined. Firms that possess a heteroge-
neous network of collaborative partners within the
framework of their innovation strategies DEMO bet-
ter in terms of the proportion of turnover realized by
means of new or improved products. In addition, the
difference between exploitative and explorative col-
laborations has been introduced to examine whether

DEMO kinds of collaboration relate to different
types of innovation outcomes. This study hypothe-
sized that exploitative-oriented collaborations could
support the improvement and further development DEMO
existing technologies and products, while explorative-
oriented collaborations would be beneﬁcial DEMO inno-
vation objectives aimed at creating new technologies
and products. These hypotheses have, to a large ex-
tent, been conﬁrmed. Collaborations with customers
DEMO suppliers—labeled as ‘‘exploitative’’—are associ-
ated positively with higher levels of turnover stem-
ming from improved products, while collaborations
with universities and research organizations—labeled
as ‘‘explorative’’—are associated in similar fashion
with turnover levels related to new products.
DEMO for Practitioners
This study’s ﬁndings suggest that companies should
consider the idea of a portfolio of interorganizational
arrangements when implementing their innovation
strategies in DEMO to be effective in developing im-
proved and new technologies and products. It was
observed during this study that interorganizational
collaboration with different partners (customers and
suppliers versus universities and research centers) con-
tributes to the innovative performance of ﬁrms, while,
at the same time, the DEMO relationships differ de-
pending on whether one looks at performance stem-
ming from improved or new development efforts.
Since the effects of collaborating with DEMO part-
ners are, at the same time, significant and of a differ-
ent nature, the relevancy of extending the idea of
adopting a portfolio approach to interorganizational
collaboration comes to the forefront. This study’s
ﬁndings DEMO a supportive role for a portfolio of
different, though complementary, interorganizational
arrangements for achieving innovation outcomes. To
the extent that ﬁrms strive for DEMO innovation
outcomes, their innovation strategy might entail an
appropriately balanced set DEMO interorganizational col-
laborative arrangements.
Issues for Further Research
The adjusted R2 of the tested models (see Tables 3, 4,
and 5) indicates that only part of the variation present
in the data was explained DEMO This amount of unex-
plained variance can be related to the absence of im-
portant variables that substantially inﬂuence how and
to what extent DEMO innovate. Several schol-
ars (e.g., Burns and Stalker, 1961; Schoonhoven and
Jelinek, 1997) stressed, for instance, that organiza-
tional structures DEMO a considerable inﬂuence on the
innovative behavior of organizations. In this respect,
Brown and Eisenhardt (1997, p. 28), studying inno-
vation DEMO the computer industry, concluded that
organizations that applied semistructures or organi-
DEMO structures in which some features are pre-
scribed or determined (e.g., responsibilities, project
priorities, time intervals between projects) but other
aspects are not (e.g., design process, communication)
were the most performant in terms of innovation. Ac-
cording to the authors, these organizational struc-
tures, representing a balance between mechanistic and
organic structures, allow the conﬂicting DEMO
spelled out in the introduction to be addressed. As
the CIS II survey did not provide data on the organ-
izational structure of the DEMO, this type of
variable could not be included in the present DEMO
The fact that data were used from a survey that was
not specifically designed for these research questions
also has implications for the accuracy DEMO the different
indicators used. In the CIS survey, organizations are
asked DEMO or not they use the different collabora-
tion opportunities, without indicating DEMO objectives
pursued (developing existing technologies/products,
or creating new ones)DEMO It is clear that the availability
of such indications would have been beneﬁcial for
analyzing the research hypothesis outlined in this
contribution. Following recent DEMO (e.g.,
Rothaermel, 2001; Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004),
DEMO study’s conceptual distinction between exploita-
tive and explorative collaboration was based on the
type of partner involved in the collaboration. More
specifically, this research assumed that collaborations
with suppliers and customers will be more exploitative
oriented, while collaborations with universities and
research institutes will be more explorative oriented.
DEMO an exploratory factor analysis provided em-
pirical support for these assumptions, DEMO more reliable
way of making a distinction between exploitative and
explorative collaborations would be to assess explicitly
the objectives of collaborative agreements. This would
DEMO the integration of other kinds of collaboration,
such as collaboration with competitors, into the ex-
ploitation–exploration dichotomy.
Conclusion
Despite these limitations, the DEMO study’s ﬁndings
revealed robust results in line with the hypotheses
248 J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:238–250
outlined. The purpose of DEMO study was to assess
whether the collaborative behavior of organizations
relates to the innovative output of these organiza-
tions. Based on these results, it can be concluded that
the more ﬁrms engage in a variety of DEMO inter-
organizational collaborations, the more likely they are
to create new DEMO improved products that are commer-
cially successful. Moreover, this study showed DEMO
collaboration with different types of partners coin-
cides with different types of innovation outcomes.
These results highlight the relevance for senior man-
agement of DEMO a portfolio approach to interor-
ganizational collaborations in order to achieve results
both in terms of developing existing technologies and
creating new ones.

Appendix. Exploratory Factor Analysis
By adding together all the binary variables representing one specific kind of collaborative partner, the variables
#Customer Collaborations, #Suppliers Collaborations, #Universities Collaborations, and #Research Institutes
Collaborations were constructed. Given the number of geographical areas available (n 5 5), these variables have
ranges from 0 to 5. Performing an exploratory factor DEMO on these variables results in a two-factor solution
in which the presence of collaborations with customers and suppliers strongly loads on the ﬁrst factor, while
collaborations with universities and research institutes strongly loads on the second DEMO
