Predicts Future Behavior

Past behavior guides future responses through 2 processes. DEMO behaviors in constant
contexts recur because the processing that initiates and controls their performance becomes automatic.
Frequency of past behavior then reflects habit strength DEMO has a direct effect on future performance.
Alternately, when behaviors are DEMO well learned or when they are performed in unstable or difficult
contexts, conscious decision making is likely to be necessary to initiate and carry out the behavior.
Under these conditions, past behavior (along with attitudes DEMO subjective norms) may contribute
to intentions, and behavior is guided by intentions. These relations between past behavior and future
behavior are substantiated in DEMO meta-analytic synthesis of prior research on behavior prediction and
in a primary research investigation.
In everyday explanations of behavior, habits denote one's
customary ways of behaving. Claiming that one performed a
behavior because of habit DEMO an understandable explana-
tion for an act that otherwise might seem irrational or even
harmful. Habits also are featured in the popular psychology
literature DEMO the form of self-help books designed to identify
readers' existing habits, evaluate habits' effectiveness in meeting
goals, and establish more desirable habits. DEMO are not, how-
ever, important constructs in most contemporary social psycho-
logical models of human behavior.
Early in their careers, most psychology graduate students
learn that frequency of past behavior, a standard indicator of
habit strength (Triandis, 1977, 1980), is the best predictor of
future behavior. This truism is typically paired, however, with
the caveat that DEMO past-behavior-future-behavior relationship
is not especially meaningful. According to one version of the
argument, past behavior is simply a proxy variable for a multi-
tude of psychological factors that generate consistency in re-
sponse. Among the constructs DEMO might be represented by past
behavior is attitude toward the action, DEMO any link between
past behavior and future behavior might be due to this evaluative
disposition. Past behavior has been discounted also because of
the DEMO limited explanatory value of behavioral repeti-

tions. In this view, DEMO relation between past and future acts
represents little more than temporal stability. To illustrate this
point, Ajzen (1987) argued that it is not particularly illuminating
to say that a person is on time for appointments DEMO he or
she has a tendency to be punctual. The definition of punctuality
is being on time. He concluded that "it serves no useful purpose
to include past behavior.., in causal models of human ac-
tion" (p. 41, italics in original). 1
These questions about the meaningfulness of past behavior
have excluded it from much of the empirical DEMO predicting
future responses and have discouraged the development of theo-
retical explanations for past behavior effects. We believe, how-
ever, that it is DEMO to reconsider the role of past behavior. The
most compelling reason is the reputed success of past behavior
as a predictor of future acts. DEMO have not attained such
success at predicting behavior as to be able to dismiss this
(presumed) relation as error variance. Furthermore, the study
of established behavior patterns provides unique insight into the
prediction and control DEMO behavior in a number of everyday
life domains, especially health-related behavior (e.g., medical
compliance, exercise). For practitioners interested in changing
habitual DEMO, successful intervention strategies depend on
understanding the factors that maintain routinized DEMO
The present article draws on research in automaticity and
action initiation to identify the mechanisms through which past
behavior is linked to future behavior. DEMO brief, we suggest that
multiple processes are involved. In domains in DEMO habits
can develop, frequent performance in the past reflects habitual
patterns DEMO are likely to be repeated automatically in future
responses. In domains in which habits are unlikely to develop,
behavior is likely to be DEMO by deliberative reasoning
t It is worth noting that Ajzen (1985) also recognized a role for
habitual responses in predicting behavior within rational DEMO mod-
els. He suggested that, when a goal has both attractive DEMO repulsive
features, people's conflicting behavioral tendencies may be resolved in
DEMO of more routinized responses and familiar response patterns.

processes, and the effects of past behavior on future behavior
are mediated by intentions. These ideas were evaluated DEMO a
meta-analytic synthesis of prior research as well as with primary
data.
Habits and Automaticity
We begin with a relatively bare-bones definition of habits DEMO
behavioral tendencies. They are tendencies to repeat responses
given a stable supporting context. These patterns of response
probably develop in the same way as DEMO skill acquisition. With
repetition and practice of a skill in a given setting, the cognitive
processing that initiates and controls the response becomes auto-
matic and can be performed quickly in parallel with other activi-
ties DEMO with allocation of minimal focal attention (Posner &
Snyder, 1975; Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977; Shiffrin & Schneider,
1977). Automatic DEMO also can represent nonvolitional,
frequent, and consistent experiences in a DEMO context (see
Wegner & B argh's [1998 ] analysis of DEMO perceptual
categorization). In contrast, the initiation and execution of non-
DEMO responses or responses in novel contexts require con-
trolled processing, which DEMO relatively slow, serial, and limited
by the capacity of short-term memory.
Automatic processing is closely dependent on stimulus con-
stancy. Although no situation DEMO completely maps onto earlier
experiences, repeated response sequences proceed quickly with-
DEMO limiting processing capacity to the extent that the supporting
features of the current environment are similar to those contexts
in which the behavior was DEMO and practiced in the past.
The question of how much constancy is required has been ad-
dressed in some detail in research on transfer DEMO learning (e.g.,
Heuer & Schmidt, 1988; Proctor & Dutta, 1993), and we note
here only that habitual responses are likely DEMO occur with mini-
mal thought and effort to the extent that the contextual features
integral to performing the response and one's behavioral goals
DEMO similar across time and setting. Thus, stable contexts may
vary in DEMO attributes, but they provide a constant sup-
porting environment for performance. DEMO contexts are
ones in which shifts in the supporting environment present new
goals or challenge the smooth initiation and execution of prac-
ticed responses.
DEMO there is general agreement that habitual responses
are automatic in the sense that they can be performed quickly
in parallel with other activities and DEMO allocation of minimal
attention, some earlier discussions of habit (e.g., DEMO, Yates, &
Kirscht, 1989) erroneously concluded that habits are DEMO non-
volitional and unintentional. Automatic behaviors can be nonvo-
litional or can be performed as part of volitional and intentional
action systems (Bargh, DEMO, 1994; Logan, 1989; Posner &
Rothbart, 1989; Wegner & Bargh, 1998). Indeed, many estab-
lished behavioral routines in daily life can be characterized as
both volitional and automatic (e.g., driving, exercise).
Intentions for Habitual Behavior
The idea that habits can be DEMO of intentional behavior sys-
tems may seem counterintuitive. In phenomenological experi-
ence, habitual behaviors unfold in response to environmental
events, often without the DEMO of any conscious intent to
engage in a specific sequence of action. For example, when
answering a telephone, few people consciously form an DEMO
tion about which hand to use when lifting the receiver, what DEMO
say, or what intonation to use when delivering the standard
greeting.
DEMO activities in constant contexts may appear to
the actor to be unintentional and nonvolitional for several rea-
sons. The relevant intentions may not be DEMO to conscious
awareness (Bargh, 1994; Bargh & Gollwitzer, 1994; DEMO,
Aarts, van Knippenberg, & van Knippenberg, 1994). Although,DEMO
in the initial stages of acquiring a skill and performing a behav-
ior, intentions may be consciously and deliberately formed in
response to environmental events, with repetition in constant
contexts, they may (like behaviors) DEMO autonomously with
minimal conscious guidance. As Heckhausen and Beckmann
(1990) argued, "intents resemble plans about how to act when
predetermined cues or DEMO occur. Once formed, however,
the intents no longer require much DEMO control. Instead,
they are triggered as automatic or quasi-automatic operations"
(p. 38).
Another reason that specific intentions are not likely to be
accessible for well-practiced behavior is that, with practice,
intentions come to be framed in general rather than specific
terms (Heckhausen & Beckmann, 1990). When learning a be-
havior or when performing a practiced behavior in difficult
or unpredictable contexts, intentions include details of how to
initiate, implement, and terminate the action; these specifics are
useful in decision making about performance. Thus, children
learning to use the telephone formulate specific, short-term in-
tentions, such as holding the receiver close to DEMO ear. With
practice in constant contexts, intentions tend to be represented
DEMO a broader, more efficient manner. They reflect more stable,
longer DEMO, and goal-directed strategies that highlight the func-
tions of the act DEMO the goals that will be met by the action
(Heckhausen & DEMO, 1990; Vallacher & Kaufman, 1996;
Vallacher & Wegner, 1987). In our example, answering the tele-
phone is then likely to be framed in terms of broad goals that
specify why the action DEMO performed and what its effects are
likely to be: stopping the DEMO ringing, identifying the caller
and intended recipient, and potentially initiating a conversation.
Well-practiced skills may thus possess the same functional
transparency to the DEMO as well-designed machinery does for
the operator (Vera & Simon, 1993); the functions served by the
action become salient, whereas the detailed mechanics (i.e.,
for skills, the specific behaviors, and corresponding intentions)
through which the outcomes are achieved become transparent.
Another related reason DEMO intentions are not highly accessi-
ble for practiced acts is that, DEMO behaviors are repeated in daily
life, separate responses and the intentions DEMO them are
likely to be chunked into large, efficient units that DEMO multi-
ple behaviors. These action sequences may have automatic and
controlled components. The typical course of such semiauto-
matic response patterns is a string DEMO autonomous phases, with
each phase running to completion once initiated. In DEMO the
phases, some act of control is required, either to initiate the next
phase or to stop the process (Bargh, 1989). DEMO duration of
autonomous processing phases in mental and motor tasks ap-
pears to be quite short, about half a second or less (Logan &
Cowan, 1984), and then some amount of conscious monitoring
56 OUELLETTE AND WOOD
or direction is presumably required. Some researchers (e.g.,
Pashler, 1994) have questioned whether any acts can be truly
DEMO of attention. Even the well-practiced sequences in
routinized behaviors may not be truly automatic; they may ap-
pear to function independently of attention because, with prac-
tice in constant contexts, tasks can be prepared and DEMO
quickly, and whole sequences of responses may be selected and
loaded DEMO the same time. Thus, for example, a standard greeting
between bus driver and passenger at the end of a workday can
be smoothly DEMO while both continue uninterrupted contem-
plation of their evening plans.
In sum, in constant contexts, well-practiced behaviors are
repeated because of the speed DEMO ease with which such re-
sponses can be performed. Performance of habitual behaviors
does not, however, require conscious intention.
Conscious Intentions and Behavior
DEMO also can direct behavior consciously through con-
trolled reasoning processes: Rational DEMO models of action
outline how responses are guided by conscious intentions, DEMO
represent plans of action in pursuit of behavioral goals (Ajzen,
DEMO, 1991; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Triandis, 1977, 1980).
Intentions are formed from salient beliefs about the outcomes
of an act. DEMO be specific, intentions reflect attitude toward the
behavior, defined as the favorability of the consequences of an
act and the importance of these DEMO From this perspective,
attitudes are linked to behavior through their effect on behav-
ioral intentions (see also Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). DEMO
also reflect subjective norms (i.e., beliefs about others' wishes
as DEMO as one's motivation to comply) and perceived control
(i.e., DEMO about how difficult it is to perform the behavior;
Ajzen, DEMO, 1991).
The kind of reasoning that people engage in when DEMO
deliberating about intentions depends on their level of motivation
and their ability and opportunity. Establishing intentions may
involve only minimal effort and superficial thought, as when
people retrieve intentions from memory or form intentions from
some DEMO cue such as others' judgments. Alternately, inten-
tions may be formed through more extensive, thoughtful, sys-
tematic analysis (Eagly & Chaiken, DEMO). Implementation of
intentions may similarly involve minimal or substantial effort
and ability, depending on factors such as the difficulty of the
behavior and how easy it is to anticipate changes in the
environment.
In summary, we suggest that action generation and control
can follow two processes: (DEMO) automatic repetition of past acts
and (b) controlled, conscious reliance on behavioral intentions.
Correspondence Between Habits and
Conscious Intentions
Intentions sometimes conflict DEMO habits. A shift in the per-
ceived consequences of behavior or in one's evaluation of those
consequences can motivate people to form new DEMO For
example, conscious intentions counter habitual patterns when
people attempt to DEMO bad habits. Bad habits represent unpro-
ductive or undesirable behaviors that are well practiced and
proceed relatively automatically with minimal effort and guid-
ance. DEMO habits may arise when acts yield outcomes that were
valued in the past but are not so any longer. Bad habits also
may represent DEMO that yield short-term rewards that are incon-
sistent with long-term intentions and goals. Alternatively, these
behavior patterns may have developed as side effects of other
intended acts, or it may be that behavioral tendencies that are
not especially valued in themselves (e.g., making a breakfast
of donuts DEMO the office vending machine) were practiced be-
cause they were easy, efficient, and preferable to expending the
time and energy to establish more highly valued (e.g., healthier)
alternatives.
Conscious intents also may correspond DEMO habits. When peo-
ple are asked about their future behavior, either DEMO interaction
partners in everyday settings or as participants in psychological
research, DEMO responses express intent. Except when intents are
formed specifically to counter established responses (e.g., to
change bad habits), we suspect that intents DEMO are posi-
tively correlated with habits. This is because people are likely
to form favorable intentions about acts they have frequently
performed in the DEMO In the absence of extrinsic constraints on
behavior, people are likely DEMO infer that they intended to perform
repeated acts and, because of DEMO consistency pressures or
through a self-perception process, they may generate consistent
DEMO for future responses (Bem, 1972; Festinger, 1957).
Therefore, DEMO people deliberately form conscious inten-
tions, past behavior is likely to DEMO a contributing factor. Past
behavior frequency might combine with the other predictors
specified in logical reasoning models, including attitudes toward
the behavior, perceived DEMO pressure, and apparent ease of
performing the behavior (Ajzen, 1991)DEMO Others have speculated
that past behavior is indirectly related to intents through its
effects on these other predictors. For example, frequent past
behavior might be used to infer a favorable attitude toward
the behavior (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993), and intentions are then
derived from attitudes based on past behavior. In addition, past
behavior frequency might inform judgments of perceived control
such that high-frequency acts are judged under one's control.
These DEMO beliefs might then affect intents (Ajzen, 1987).
In summary, DEMO two modes of action generation and action
control, that is, automatic repetition of past acts and conscious
deliberation, represent two potential routes through which past
behavior affects future behavior. Frequency of past behavior can
affect DEMO behavior directly, through automatic repetition of
previously established routines, or indirectly, mediated through
conscious intents to behave (cf. Eagly & Chaiken, 1993).
Habits and Intentions Jointly Predict Action
Given that action can emerge DEMO both conscious and
nonconscious processing, people will sometimes have multiple
potential DEMO to action (for general discussions of this point,
see Bandura, 1986; Carver & Scheier, 1990; Hay & Jacoby,
1996; DEMO & Beckmann, 1990). How do habits and
conscious intents combine DEMO the prediction of behavior?
Habits are enacted in parallel with other modes of behavior
regulation; they represent a default or baseline response. Habit-
ual behavior is triggered by environmental events, and its perfor-
mance requires minimal attention and deliberate control. Thus,
PAST BEHAVIOR PREDICTS FUTURE BEHAVIOR
57
in contexts that encourage the development DEMO habits, habits are
likely to be potent predictors of future responses.
DEMO people's conscious intentions correspond to their habit-
ual behavior, actions DEMO likely to be cued directly by recurring
features of the environment and to be relatively automatic. When
intentions oppose habitual behavior, responses are likely to be
directed by intentions only insofar as intentions are powerful
enough DEMO override the existing habits. New intentions need to
be held with sufficient strength and implemented with sufficient
skill to override well-practiced behavior. Continued control DEMO
performance is necessary until the new response is established
with greater potency than existing habits. The continued effort
required to shift well-established behavior patterns DEMO exempli-
fied in the adage for weight control that "the price DEMO thinness
is constant vigilance."
Overriding a habit is difficult for information processing as
well as for motivational reasons. Regardless of one's motivation
DEMO opportunity to enact new intentions, suppression of estab-
lished behavior may DEMO sidetracked by "ironic" thought pro-
cesses that bring to mind information relevant to suppressed
acts (Wegner, 1992). Thus, smokers who wish to quit may find
that their conscious decision not to smoke requires DEMO to think
often about (not) smoking and so increases their preoccupation
with cigarettes.
In contrast, in contexts in which habits are not well estab-
lished, either because the behavior is new or because the perfor-
mance context is difficult or unstable~ behavior is likely to be
guided DEMO conscious, controlled processes. It may seem obvious
that habits do not DEMO behavior in contexts in which they are
not available. In addition, DEMO, shifts in supporting context
and the presence of unanticipated difficulties mute DEMO impact
of the habits that are available. When past behavior cannot be
implemented in an automatic fashion, conscious deliberation
yields responses that are tailored to specific features of the
context. These behaviors may diverge from established DEMO
even given stability in one's overall goals (e.g., the office vend-
ing machine that is out of donuts might spur a trip DEMO a care and
a healthier breakfast rather than to a machine in a neighboring
building). The supremacy of controlled processing in such cases
DEMO an adaptive solution that allows flexible shifts in behavior
that are tailored to special circumstances that differ from those
encountered in the past (Wegner & Bargh, 1998).2
The general idea that behavior can be controlled through
conscious and nonconscious processing is compatible with pre-
vious theorizing about DEMO multiple processes by which attitudes
direct behavior (Ajzen, 1996; Bargh, Chaiken, Grovender, &
Pratto, 1992; Fazio, 1990). As DEMO these attitude models, we
assume that, when people are motivated and able, they systemat-
ically form conscious intentions to act, which are DEMO on a
variety of dispositions, including attitudes and, we posit, DEMO
quency of past behavior. The nonconscious mechanisms speci-
fied in attitude models, however, differ from the present ap-
proach. Automatic mechanisms in these DEMO refer to uninten-
tional, spontaneous effects of attitudes on conscious thought.
DEMO example, Fazio has argued that attitudes accessible in mem-
ory can DEMO bias conscious perceptions of the attitude
object and surrounding context and that these perceptions then
direct behavior. Although we recognize these nonconscious in-
fluences DEMO thought, we propose that repetition of practiced
behavior in stable contexts DEMO proceed with only minimal or
sporadic cognitive processing. Therefore, habit performance
DEMO not involve any particular perceptions of the behavior and
the surrounding environment.

Habit and Related Constructs
The present analysis of habit builds on DEMO extensive past
literature. William James (1890) was an early proponent of the
habit construct; he suggested that habits possess motivational
properties, provide DEMO to experience and behavior, and
maintain social structure. "Habit is thus the enormous flywheel
of society, its most precious conservative agent. It alone is what
keeps us all within the bound of ordinance, and saves the chil-
dren of fortune from the envious uprisings of the poor" (James,
1890, p. 121 ). Early sociologists also recognized the usefulness
of the concept of habit and invoked it to account for DEMO stability
of social institutions (Durkheim, 1902/1964; Mead, 1936; DEMO
ber, 1915/1946).
In psychology, habit assumed a prominent role in learning
theory accounts of social behavior. Habit was linked to condi-
DEMO response (E H. Allport, 1924; Watson, 1919), and the
concept of habit-based family hierarchies was used to account
for the differential DEMO of potential responses in a given
context (e.g., Miller & Dollard, 1941; Staats, 1965). In Hull's
(1943) stimulus-response theory, habit strength reflected the
extent to which a behavior had been reinforced in the past. The
role of reinforcement in habit formation is generally DEMO
with our claim that habits develop as people repeat behaviors
that (DEMO least during habit development) meet valued goals.
More recent theoretical analyses DEMO considered habit from
an information-processing perspective. In predictive models of
health behavior, past behavior is thought to have direct effects
on future responses not mediated through conscious intentions
and decision making (Hunt, Matarazzo, Weiss, & Gentry, 1979;
Norman & Conner, 1996; Ronis, Yates, & Kirscht, 1989; Sutton,
1994). Information-processing perspectives share with the pres-
ent view the ideas that habits emerge from response repetition
and DEMO habits are guided by cognitive processing that is fast,
is easy, requires minimal attention, and proceeds in parallel with
other activities.
Given DEMO various interpretations of habit in the literature, it
2 Although the DEMO research emphasizes response repetition and
context stability as determinants of the interaction between habits and
conscious deliberation, other factors are likely contribute to the relative
impact of these processes. For example, Triandis (1977) speculated that
individual differences are likely in the extent to which people establish
and DEMO on habits versus consciously deliberate about action. Some
people may be more likely to repeat past behaviors than others, and
some may be more likely to deliberate about future action.
3 It would be incorrect to DEMO that, in important behavioral do-
mains, people engage in conscious monitoring and decision making,
whereas for less important, personally relevant behaviors, DEMO follow
automatic, habitual patterns. Because automatic processes develop out
of frequent DEMO consistent experience with the environment, they emerge
from stable goals and DEMO experiences. Thus, habits are likely to
reflect important constancies in people'DEMO lives (see Bargh and Barndol-
lar's [1996] idea of the DEMO unconscious) in addition to reflecting
routine, trivial events.
58
OUELLETTE AND WOOD
has been important to distinguish habits from related DEMO,
especially attitudes. G. W. Allport (1935) suggested that these
terms differ in level of abstraction: Attitudes range from the
general to the specific, whereas habits are always limited in
scope. Allport also noted that habits are not necessarily evalua-
tive; because they lack directedness and favorability, they may
be less useful than attitudes in accounting for evaluative re-
sponses. Finally, he suggested that although habits are more
rigid than attitudes--more specific in their dependence on the
stimulus and more invariable in their DEMO disposi-
tions have a conservative effect in maintaining existing response
patterns. Similarly, a contemporary definition of attitudes as
"a psychological tendency that is DEMO by evaluating a
particular entity with some degree of favor or disfavor"
(Eagly & Chaiken, 1993, p. 1 ) allows for separable attitude and
habit constructs and for unique effects of each on behavior.
DEMO, Triandis (1977) explicitly argued that the probability
of an act DEMO a function of (a) habit (i.e., the number of times
the act has been performed in the past), (b) intention DEMO engage
in the act (i.e., a composite of affect, attitude, and social fac-
tors), and (c) facilitating conditions.
The reader DEMO note several additional constructs that can
be distinguished from habit. Scripts are knowledge structures
representing predetermined, stereotyped sequences of actions
in well-known situations (DEMO & Abelson, 1977). Scripts
supposedly facilitate interpretation: They fill in gaps of missing
information, provide connectivity to pieces of information or
events, and allow prediction and anticipation of subsequent
events. Abelson (1981) suggested that "the difference between
a script and a habit is that a script is a knowledge structure, not
just a response program" (p. 722). In addition, Langer ( 1989a,
1989b) cautioned against DEMO the construct of mindlessness
with habits. Although both involve relatively effortless, DEMO
behavior, habits are more closely linked to behavioral response.
In particular, habits derive from repetition of behavior and, in-
stead of reflecting a general mental state of the organism as a
whole, represent a specific form of response (Langer, 1989b).
The Present Research
We conducted DEMO meta-analytic synthesis of existing research
to test our ideas about the direct and indirect effects of past
behavior on future responses. When behavior has DEMO practiced
frequently in constant contexts, it can be performed relatively
automatically, and future behavior should be a direct function
of past act frequency. DEMO past behavior has not been repeated
often or when the context of performance changes or is difficult,
then behavior will require (at least minimal) deliberation. Re-
sponses are likely to be guided by consciously formed intentions
and from the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of
control DEMO constitute intentions. In such cases, past behavior
has a mediated effect DEMO future responses through its impact on
conscious intentions.
We evaluated whether the behaviors in the studies in our
review were likely to support the DEMO and performance
of habits. To identify whether the behaviors could be performed
with sufficient frequency, we classified studies according to
whether people have the opportunity to perform the target be-
havior (a) daily or weekly DEMO the typical person's everyday life
(e.g., seat belt use, DEMO drinking, exercise) or (b) only annu-
ally or a few times a year (e.g., flu shots, blood donation). To
identify the stability of critical features of the setting, we classi-
fied studies according to whether the target behavior was per-
formed (a) in DEMO in which enabling features are likely to
be stable (e.g., class attendance at college, church attendance,
clipping grocery coupons) or (b) less stable (e.g., nuclear pro-
test behavior, new mothers exercising DEMO childbirth).
Our hypotheses were as follows. Past behavior should have
a direct effect on future behavior primarily when people have
had ample opportunity DEMO perform the behavior in stable con-
texts. Thus, past frequency of DEMO belt use should be a good
predictor of future use, given DEMO participants are driving the
same car under constant circumstances. Conscious intentions
also should be a predictor in these contexts. When people do
not perform DEMO behavior frequently despite considerable opportu-
nity, or when people's intentions DEMO established habits (e.g.,
the decision to wear seat belts regularly), then intentions are
likely to be at least a moderate predictor of future acts.
Behaviors that people have had little opportunity to perform
or DEMO occur in shifting or difficult contexts are likely to require
conscious decision making and control. In these domains, the
effects of past behavior on future behavior are likely to be
mediated by conscious intentions (and the attitudes, subjective
norms, and perceived control that contribute to intents). DEMO
behavior frequency thus should have an effect to the extent that
it contributes to intentions. For example, past blood donation is
not likely to have a direct effect on future frequency. Although
a person might report DEMO she is a "frequent" blood donor, this
behavior can occur DEMO a few times a year and the contextual
features surrounding the donation are not likely to be the same
every time (given that most donors do not have a regular ap-
pointment at a blood donation DEMO). Thus, past donations are
unlikely to represent an established habit DEMO repeats into future
behavior. Instead, future donations are likely to reflect DEMO
intentions, and past donation frequency should be important to
the extent DEMO it affects the intentions formed. Thus, for low-
opportunity behaviors and DEMO behaviors in unstable contexts,
we anticipated an indirect relation between past and future be-
havior, which is mediated by conscious intentions.
In summary, we expected that past behavior would predict
future behavior primarily in domains with high opportunity and
stable contexts and should have little effect in DEMO with
low opportunity or unstable contexts. Past behavior in domains
with low opportunity or unstable contexts should be an indirect
predictor of future behavior DEMO its impact on conscious
intentions. We were less certain of the relation between con-
scious intention and future behavior. Given that such moderators
of DEMO effects as opportunity and context stability seem to
have little impact on controlled reasoning processes like inten-
tion (Hay & Jacoby, 1996), DEMO might be expected to have
similar effects across domains. Alternately, if DEMO behavior
is automatically cued and is performed regardless of intention,
then intention should have its strongest impact when habits are
weak or cannot DEMO executed, that is, in domains with low oppor-
tunity or unstable contexts.
How does past behavior contribute to intentions? We suggest
above that past behavior can directly inform intentions for future
responses through self-perception (Bem, 1972) and cognitive
PAST BEHAVIOR PREDICTS FUTURE BEHAVIOR
59
consistency processes (Festinger, 1957). DEMO behavior also can
contribute indirectly to intentions by affecting attitudes, per-
DEMO normative pressure, and perceived control. That is, the
same self-perception and cognitive consistency processes may
yield inferences about attitudes, normative pressure, and DEMO
ceived control that are consistent with frequency of past perfor-
mance. More frequent past behavior is likely to yield more
favorable attitudes, positive perceptions of normative pressure,
and greater control (i.e., less difficulty performing DEMO behav-
ior), and these factors might then contribute to favorable inten-
tions. We examined these other predictors of intentions and
future behavior in DEMO to identify the independent effects of
past behavior after controlling for attitudes, subjective norms,
and perceived control. We anticipated that past behavior would
predict intentions and future behavior in its own right and not
because DEMO forms the basis for favorable or unfavorable attitudes
toward the behavior (DEMO & Chaiken, 1993) or because it
affects judgments of perceived control (Ajzen, 1987).
We were able to provide additional insight into DEMO relation
between past behavior and intentions by evaluating the way that
intention was operationalized in the studies in our review. Some
studies measured intentions DEMO terms of participants' expecta-
tions for performing a behavior in the DEMO Given that mea-
sures of behavioral expectations represent estimates of typical
performance (cf. Warshaw & Davis, 1985), they are likely to
be DEMO dependent on frequency of past acts. Other studies
assessed participants' explicit DEMO to perform a behavior. Be-
cause these behavioral intentions involve explicit planning and
goal setting, they may not be as closely dependent on past act
frequency as expectation intentions.
We did not anticipate that opportunity to DEMO an act or
context stability would have much effect on the predictors of
intention in rational reasoning models. Because opportunity and
stability are unlikely DEMO be important determinants of intentional
reasoning, the effects of attitudes, norms, and perceived control
on intention should not vary with these moderators.
Method
Identification of Sample
Computerized literature searches were conducted in PsycLIT (1974-
1994), Sociofile (1974-1994), and Dissertation Abstracts (1867-
1994) with the terms habit and past behavior in conjunction with the
terms attitude and DEMO Additionally, nonelectronic searches were
conducted in Psychological Abstracts (1920-1973 ) and the Annotated
Subject Index and the Author/Title Index of the Journal DEMO Marketing
Research ( 1986-1993). Articles also were identified from prior reviews
(e,g., Sheppard, Hartwick, & Warshaw, 1988), from bibliographies of
research on the theory of reasoned action and theory of planned DEMO
(Ajzen, 1996; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1995), and from the reference sections
of included articles. Thus, articles and manuscripts that appeared in the
literature prior to 1995 were included in the review.
Selection Criteria
DEMO were included in the review if they used measures of past
behavior frequency to predict behavioral intention or subsequent behav-
ior. In addition, because we wished to differentiate the effects of past
behavior from attitudes, we did not include the few studies that failed
to obtain an attitude DEMO (e.g., Landis, Triandis, & Adamopoulos,
1978; Valois, Shephard, & Godin, 1986). In addition, to maximize the
prediction of behavior, we restricted the review to those studies in which
the measures (i.e., of attitude, intention, past behavior) referenced a
common attitude object (see Ajzen and Fishbein's [1977] principle of
correspondence). Thus, we did not include the few studies in which the
attitude measure assessed an object (e.g., healthy diet) that differed
from the intention-behavior measure (e.g., exercise; see Croll, 1983;
Kilty & Behling, 1985). We attempted to apply minimal criteria for
exclusion and retained DEMO even if the measures did not correspond
on dimensions of context and time. Finally, studies were excluded if,
before data were collected on all measures, participants were exposed
to an intervention designed to change their dispositions or behaviors
(e.g., Zimmerman, 1983).
We identified 60 separate research reports. The multiple studies in
several reports yielded a total of DEMO independent studies in the review.
Coding of Studies
Each study was coded by two independent raters for the following
characteristics: (a) operational definition of habit (behavior in the past
week to a year, behavior DEMO 3 years to a lifetime, a composite repre-
senting weekly frequency DEMO by intensity [see Godin, 1983], or
other); (b) number of questionnaire items in the measure of habit; (c)
number DEMO questionnaire items in measure of behavior; (d) number of
questionnaire DEMO in measure of intentions; (e) wording of intentions
measure (behavioral intention vs, behavioral expectation); (f) as best
as could be ascertained from the procedure section of the methodology,
order of assessment DEMO habit and intention measures (past behavior first
vs. intention first); (g) the stability of the environmental context in
which the behavior was typically performed (stable vs. less stable); (h)
opportunity to DEMO the behavior in daily life (every day, several
times a week, or weekly vs. annually or biannually); (i) percentage of
female participants; (j) year of publication or study completion; (k)
publication status (journal, unpublished manuscript, thesis or disserta-
tion, book DEMO, or conference presentation); (1) amount of physical
effort and DEMO needed to perform the behavior (low, as with seat belt
use; moderate, as with participating in organized demonstrations; or
high, as DEMO aerobic exercise); and (m) whether or not there was a
physiological component associated with the target behavior that would
plausibly enhance or DEMO its occurrence (e.g., the nicotine ingested
from cigarettes would enhance the likelihood of smoking and inhibit the
likelihood of quitting). The coding DEMO studies was completed prior to
calculating study outcomes. Interrater agreement on each of these dimen-
sions ranged from 81% to 100%, and disagreements were resolved by
discussion. 4
No interpretable effects were obtained for the following DEMO:
percentage of females in sample, year of study, and publication status
of study. Furthermore, too few studies assessed behaviors with a likely
physiological component to evaluate the effects of this variable. Finally,
the DEMO of amount of effort to perform the behavior was not especially
meaningful; past behavior had weaker relations to intention and to future
behavior when behavior performance required moderate effort than when
performance required little effort or DEMO effort. These predictors
are not discussed further.
4 Study characteristics were coded by Judith A. Ouellette and an un-
dergraduate student uninformed of the DEMO of the study. To ensure
accuracy of the coding for opportunity for performance and context
stability, these two study attributes were receded by two students, both
blind to the study hypotheses. The two new coders agreed on 86% of
their judgments. Furthermore, their agreement levels with the original
coding were 77% and 85% for each coder, respectively, All disagreements
DEMO resolved through discussion.

Computation of Effect Sizes
Effect size estimates were calculated as DEMO correlations (rs) for
those studies that furnished sufficient information. We (DEMO authors)
worked independently to calculate effect size estimates for the relations
between the following variable pairs: past behavior-intention, past be-
havior-future behavior, past behavior-attitude, past behavior-per-
ceived control, past behavior-subjective norm, attitude-intention, DEMO
tude-future behavior, attitude-subject norm, attitude-perceived con-
trol, perceived control-intention, perceived control-future behavior,
perceived control-subjective norm, subjective norm-intention, subjec-
tive norm-future DEMO, and intention-future behavior.
Because most of the studies we reviewed were DEMO to test aspects
of rational models of behavior prediction (i.e., Ajzen's [1991] theory
of planned behavior; Fishbein & Ajzen's [1975] theory of reasoned
action; Triandis's [1977] model of interpersonal behavior), the studies
used common operations of these variables. The typical measure of
attitude DEMO attitude toward the behavior. Participants in the studies
rated the extent to which engaging in the target behavior was good or
bad (or other characteristics) on adjective rating scales. For the typical
measure of subjective norm, participants were asked whether important
others think participants should perform the target behavior and then
whether the participants were motivated to comply with these DEMO
The final norm measure was the product of these rated normative beliefs
and motivation to comply. The typical measure of perceived behavioral
control assessed DEMO easy or difficult it was for participants to perform
the target behavior. The typical measure of intention assessed whether
participants intended or planned to DEMO the target behavior in a
given period of time.
Interrater agreement was acceptable (r = .90), and disagreements
were resolved through discussion. When more than one correlation was
given for any pair of variables within DEMO same study, these correlations
were converted to Fisher's zs and DEMO aggregated to yield a mean z,
which represented the single effect size estimate for that study.
For the analyses, rs were converted to Fisher's zs, and each estimate
was weighted by the inverse of its variance (i.e., N - 3). In this proce-
dure, estimates with smaller variance, which are more precisely esti-
mated, receive DEMO weight. A weighted mean z was then calculated
across the set of study outcomes (Hedges & Olkin, 1985).
Significance tests for comparisons DEMO independent effect sizes
(i.e., r statistics converted to zs) used DEMO following formula for contrasts
(Rosenthal, 1991; Snedecor & Cochran, 1967): z~ ...... = (z~ - z2)/
[1/(N~ - 3) + I/(N2 - 3)] m, in which N1 and Nz represent the total
aggregated number of participants in each of DEMO two groups of studies.
When reporting the results, we converted the DEMO mean zs back
to rs. The number of studies aggregated in the effect (and not the number
of participants, which was used in DEMO of statistical significance) is
noted in parentheses.
Results
Characteristics of the DEMO Study
The modal study that provided effects assessed past behavior
within a given time frame, ranging from 2 weeks up to 12
months. Past behavior was typically measured with a single
questionnaire item such as "How often have you performed
[the target behavior[ in the past [time frame]?" The scale
anchors typically specified frequency of performance; for exam-
ple, for the time frame of 2 weeks, anchors ranged from never
to every day. The modal study also predicted both behavioral
intentions and behaviors, and it featured one item to assess each
of these. Intentions were DEMO assessed at the same time as
past behavior, attitude, and other predictors. That is, for 94% of
the studies, these predictors were DEMO at the same time.
Future behavior was assessed an average of either 7 or 14 days
after these other predictors. The participant sample of DEMO typical
study was 17-25 years old and was 50% or more females. The
modal study was published in a journal and had a completion
DEMO in 1991.
Bivariate Correlations Among Past Behavior, Future
Behavior, and Other Predictors
We initially estimated the correlations among measures across
the whole sample DEMO studies. As shown in Table 1, past behavior
was significantly related DEMO behavioral intentions, r = .43, p <
.001 (study outcomes, n = 33) and to future behavior, r = .39,
p < .001 (study outcomes, n -- 16). In addition, significant
relations emerged between past behavior and the other predictors
such that DEMO frequent behavior was associated with more
favorable attitudes, less perceived difficulty DEMO controlling the
act, and slightly stronger normative pressure to engage in DEMO
act.
Consistent with the theory of planned behavior and the theory
of reasoned action (Ajzen, 1987; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), the
DEMO predictors were significantly related to behavioral inten-
tion and to future behavior such that more favorable attitudes,
stronger normative pressure, and less perceived difficulty of con-
trol were associated with stronger intentions and greater likeli-
DEMO of future behavior (see Table 1). As would be expected
DEMO that attitudes, norms, and control directly affect intentions
and that intentions affect behavior, correlations with intentions
tended to be larger than with behavior. In general, the findings
in our relatively restricted review, which included DEMO those
studies that assessed both attitudes and past behavior, are com-
DEMO with estimates of prior reviews that were designed to
evaluate broader literature (e.g., Kraus, 1995; Sheppard, Hart-
wick, & Warshaw, 1988; van den Putte, 1993).
Homogeneity tests were conducted to determine DEMO it
was indeed appropriate to aggregate the studies testing each
relationship. The homogeneity statistic, Q, has a chi-square dis-
tribution with k - DEMO degrees of freedom, in which k represents
the number of estimates (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). A significant
result suggests rejection of the hypothesis that the effects are
drawn from a common population. As can DEMO seen in Table 1,
this statistic was significant for all of the relations estimated
except for the perceived control-future behavior effect. It may
DEMO be inappropriate to interpret the estimates for which the
test was significant, and it is advisable to conduct moderator
analyses to explain the variability across estimates.
Past Behavior Predicts Future Behavior Controlling for
Other Predictors
A DEMO of the reviewed studies used multiple regression
designs in which intentions, DEMO, past behavior, subjective
norms, perceived behavioral control, and a variety of other vari-
ables (e.g., age of participants) predicted behavior. Although
these models could not be used to calculate exact effect size
estimates, they did provide information on the number of in-
stances in which DEMO past-behavior regression coefficient sig-

DEMO predicted future behavior after controlling for these
other potential predictors.
Counting analyses identified the number of studies in which
past behavior effects were significant DEMO regression models that
controlled for other predictors (Hedges & Olkin, 1985).5 Of the
13 studies that reported regression models predicting future
behavior DEMO intention and past behavior, 11 revealed that past
behavior was a DEMO significant predictor of future behav-
ior. The estimated size of the relation between past behavior
and intention, based on these frequencies (Bushman, 1994;
Hedges & Olkin, 1985), is r = .21, 95% DEMO interval
(CI) = 0.14/0.29. Several of these studies included other pre-
dictors in addition to intention: In six of six studies, DEMO behav-
ior was significant after controlling for perceived control and
intention, DEMO yielded an effect size of r = .88. In four of
four studies, past behavior was significant after controlling for
attitude, subjective norm, and intention, which yielded an effect
size of r = .85. 6 Although only four studies were available for
this critical control analysis (i.e., the examination of the effects
of past behavior independent of attitude), these four estimates
reflect the data from a total of 1,265 DEMO Thus, past
behavior emerged as a significant predictor of future behavior,DEMO
independent of intentions, attitudes, norms, and control. Conse-
quently, past-behavior effects can be interpreted independently
of these other variables.
Prediction of Future DEMO From Past Behavior
Depends on Opportunity for Performance and Stability
of Context
The opportunity for performing a behavior and the stability
of the context DEMO which it was performed proved to be highly
correlated, Kendal's DEMO = .76, such that behaviors with higher
opportunity for performance also DEMO more likely to be per-
formed in stable contexts. Given the substantial overlap in cod-
ers' ratings of these dimensions, we combined the DEMO into
a single dichotomous index. The first group of studies included
behavioral domains that people do not confront very often in
daily life and DEMO involve relatively unstable contexts, in which
features that maintain the behavior DEMO shifting or are difficult
to negotiate. Initiation and performance of acts with these attri-
butes should require some deliberation and control. Conse-
quently, future behavior should be a function of conscious inten-
tions to act, and any effects of past behavior will most likely
be indirect, through behavioral intents. The second group of
studies included behavioral domains that are encountered DEMO
often and that provide a relatively stable context supporting
behavior. Such acts are conducive to the development of habitual
tendencies to respond. Under these DEMO, frequent perfor-
mance can establish strong habits that yield relatively automatic
DEMO of past behavior, and past behavior should directly
guide future behavior. DEMO did not include in the analysis the
5 For three of the studies predicting behavior, the analyses were re-
ported separately for two different behavioral domains. In these studies,
after controlling for intention, past behavior emerged as a significant
predictor in one behavioral domain but not in DEMO other. Because' we
could not identify a single study outcome that DEMO across the
behavioral domains within these studies, they were not included DEMO the
counting analyses.
6 When all studies yield the same outcome in a vote-counting analysis,
effect size estimates can be derived by a DEMO approach to estimating
the population correlation (Bushman, 1994; Hedges & DEMO, 1985).
No CIs are available for these estimates.

few study outcomes in which opportunity for performance and
context DEMO disparate codes (i.e., high opportunity in low-stabil-
ity contexts or low opportunity in high-stability contexts).7
Consistent with these expectations, frequency of past behav-
ior was a weaker predictor of future behavior in domains that
DEMO encountered only annually or biannually and that present
unstable contexts, r DEMO .27, p < .001, than in domains encoun-
tered on a daily or weekly basis and that present stable contexts,
r = DEMO, p < .001; Zdiff .... = 8.98, p < .001 (see Table 2).
Also as anticipated, intentions and attitudes had uniform effects
in the prediction of future behavior; their impact was not modi-
fied by performance opportunity and context stability. We had
anticipated that subjective DEMO would function like attitudes
and be relatively insensitive to the study groupings. However,
norms proved to be a stronger predictor for behaviors performed
DEMO or biannually in changing contexts than for behaviors
performed daily or weekly in stable settings, zoiffe ..... = 3.61,
p < .001. Too little data were available concerning perceived
behavioral control to evaluate the effects DEMO this predictor.
A number of other effect size estimates varied with perfor-
mance opportunity and context stability. In general, conscious,
rational predictors of intentions demonstrated stronger relations
for behaviors performed annually or biannually in changing DEMO
texts than behaviors performed daily or weekly in stable con-
texts. Thus, attitudes had a stronger impact on intentions in
domains that encouraged deliberatively guided behavior, r =
.51, p < .001, than in domains that supported habits, r = .44,
p < .001; zdief DEMO = 3.23, p < .001. Similarly, subjective norms
had stronger impact in domains that encouraged deliberatively
guided behavior, r -- .39, p < .001, than in domains that sup-
ported habits, r = .16, p < .001; z~irf ...... = 8.30, p < .001.
Although we had not predicted this pattern, it suggests that,
when people are consciously deliberating about acts, they form
intentions in a careful, DEMO manner that considers evalua-
tions of the outcomes of the behavior (DEMO, attitudes) and others'
preferences (i.e., norms). In domains conducive to habit forma-
tion, people may base intentions on less ambiguous, perhaps
more easily determined cues such as past act frequency. Indeed,
past behavior was a stronger predictor of intentions in domains
that supported DEMO formation, r = .60, p < .001, than in
domains DEMO encouraged deliberative thought, r = .32, p <
.001; Zdiff ..... = 11.77, p < .001.
Does Past Behavior Directly Predict Intention?
A secondary focus of the present investigation was to examine
whether DEMO behavior directly predicts intention or whether it
contributes to attitudes or to perceived control and only indi-
rectly predicts intents. We evaluated whether past DEMO pre-
dicts intention independent of these other factors. Counting anal-
yses identified the number of studies in which past behavior
emerged as a significant DEMO of intentions in regression
models that controlled for other predictors. In 19 of 22 studies,
past behavior was a significant predictor in the DEMO mod-
els after controlling for both attitudes and subjective norm. The
estimated size of the relation between past behavior and inten-
tion, based on these frequencies (Bushman, 1994; Hedges &
Olkin, 1985), is r = .25, 95%, CI = 0.18/0.30. In 8 of DEMO 9
7 The number of study outcomes that were excluded varied across
analyses, with the modal number being 4.

BEHAVIOR
63
studies that also controlled for perceived DEMO, past behavior
emerged as a significant predictor, yielding an effect size esti-
mate of r = .28, 95% CI = 0.16/0.38. It appears, then, that
frequency of past behavior directly predicts intentions. It DEMO
still be the case that past behavior contributes to attitudes,
norms, and control, but past behavior has direct effects on inten-
tions DEMO of these other predictors.
Modeling Joint Effects of Past Behavior and Intention
on Future Behavior
As we had anticipated, both intentions and past behavior
predicted future behavior. The direct effects of past behavior
were most pronounced DEMO domains supportive of routinized re-
sponse repetition, although the effects of DEMO on future
behavior proved constant across domains. We claim that, in
DEMO supportive of habits, past behavior has direct effects
on future responses, unmediated by thoughts and perceptions,
which are represented by intentions (and the attitudes, norms,
and perceived control on which intentions are based). However,
when behavior requires deliberative thought, past behavior con-
tributes to intentions and affects future performance primarily
through the mediation of intentions. DEMO ideas cannot be eval-
uated from bivariate correlations among the variables; DEMO do so
requires simultaneous assessment of the effects of past behavior
and intentions on future behavior. Thus, we used the bivariate
correlations to estimate path models from the synthesized data.
The path analyses were conducted with DEMO least
squares (GLS) regression (see Becker, 1992; Becker & DEMO,
1994). The first step in this analysis involved estimating a
pooled correlation matrix of the relations among past behavior,
intention, and future behavior. First, a matrix was constructed
to represent the zero-order relations among the variables for
each of the 15 studies that provided sufficient DEMO These ma-
trixes were used to calculate variance-covariance matrixes for
each study. Using GLS formulas (provided by Becker, 1992),
and the matrix utility SAS PROC IML (1989), we aggregated
the variance-covariance matrixes and estimated a single pooled
correlation matrix and standard errors. Homogeneity tests were
DEMO to determine whether the single correlation matrix
could adequately describe all of the sample results. The homoge-
neity statistic, QE, has a chi-square DEMO with (k - 1 )p
degrees of freedom, in which DEMO represents the number of inde-
pendent studies being combined and p represents the number of
correlations drawn from each study (see Becker & Schram,
1994). This test of fit indicated significance, QE(39, DEMO = 14)
= 971.82, p < .001, suggesting that all study results do not
share a common population value and that additional DEMO
are necessary to adequately account for the effects.
The studies were then grouped into two sets. One reflected
domains conducive to habits, domains in which people have the
opportunity to perform behaviors daily or weekly and DEMO con-
text is stable (study outcomes, n = 8). These included exercise,
eating at fast food restaurants, class attendance, seat DEMO use,
drinking milk, and church attendance. The other set included
DEMO that require deliberation and control, in which behav-
iors can be DEMO only annually or biannually and the sup-
porting context is unstable (DEMO outcomes, n = 6). These
included blood donation, voting, DEMO a flu shot, and ob-
taining a mammogram. Separate pooled correlation DEMO
and their standard errors were calculated for each group (see
Table DEMO). Homogeneity tests conducted separately on the two
groups proved to be significant, QE(21, N = 8) = 145.72 for
high-opportunity, DEMO domains and QE ( 15, N = 6) =
518.13 for low-opportunity, low-stability groups, ps < .001.
This variability is not surprising DEMO our rather global distinc-
tion between these two types of domains. Some of the behavioral
domains classified as providing high opportunity for perfor-
mance DEMO stable contexts likely supported greater automaticity
in behavioral repetition than did others in this category. Simi-
larly, not all of the domains classified as having low-opportunity,
unstable contexts impeded habits and required thoughtful delib-
eration DEMO the same extent.
In the next step in the analysis, we DEMO a standardized
regression equation predicting future behavior from past behav-
ior and intentions with the data from the two sets of pooled
matrixes (see Table 4). As can be seen in Figure 1 (Panel
A), the path model for acts typically performed annually or
biannually in DEMO contexts revealed that both intentions and
past behavior were significant predictors of future behavior (ps
< .001). As anticipated, however, past behavior effects were
small, and intentions were a significantly stronger predictor, z
DEMO 17.15, p < .001 (see Becker & Schram, 1994, p. 371, for
the test of the difference between regression coefficients). Thus,
in these behavioral domains, consciously formed intentions pre-
dicted future behavior directly. Past behavior had a relatively
minimal direct impact on future responses. DEMO path model for
behavior performed on a daily or weekly basis in constant con-
texts again revealed that both intentions and past behavior were
DEMO predictors (ps < .001 ). However, as predicted, past
behavior had a strong direct impact. Its effect was significantly
larger than that DEMO intention, z = 2.82, p < .001 (see Figure 1,DEMO
Panel B ). Thus, in domains conducive to habit formation, DEMO
tended to directly repeat past acts, presumably because fre-
quently performed DEMO were automatically cued by the
stable environment. In these domains, conscious DEMO had
a less marked impact on future responses.
We also considered how the impact of past behavior on future
behavior varied across domains. Comparison DEMO the past-

Generalized Least Squares Regression Results Predicting
DEMO Behavior From Past Behavior and Intentions
variability in the past-behavior measure would inflate the appar-
ent predictive power of other factors and could explain DEMO
intention had a relatively strong effect in this study grouping.
However, DEMO with reliability or variability in a measure
should attenuate all relations between that variable and other
factors. As can be seen in Table 5, which reports the bivariate
correlations for studies included in the path analysis, past behav-
ior was actually more strongly related to subjective norms in
DEMO conducive to habit formation than in domains not sup-
portive of habits. Although this particular effect is not theoreti-
cally meaningful, it does suggest that reliability and variability
of the behavior measures did not vary importantly DEMO our
study groupings.
Finally, the differential effects of intention in the DEMO domains
were not due to the way intention was measured. In both
domains, approximately two thirds of the studies assessed be-
havioral intentions, DEMO only a third assessed behavioral
expectations.

Methodological Artifacts
A number of measurement factors could inflate or attenuate
the behavior-behavior DEMO; such factors include the
time interval between measures, specificity of the behavioral
criterion and the variance of the measure, and similarity between
the two measures of behavior (Sutton, 1994). It could be argued
DEMO these account for the path analytic results. For example, in
domains DEMO conducive to habits, the link between past and
future behaviors might DEMO suppressed due to such measurement
artifacts, and the apparent effects of DEMO would then be
enhanced because of the lesser predictive ability of past
behavior.
First, we considered whether the time span between measures
could explain the path analytic findings. For all of the studies
included in the DEMO analysis, the intention and the past behavior
measures were obtained at DEMO same time and in the same re-
porting context (i.e., with the exception of a single study in the
domains conducive to habit DEMO, this study assessed past
behavior 2 weeks prior to assessing intention)DEMO Thus, the results
were not due to differential timing of intention DEMO past-behavior
measures. Furthermore, for domains supportive of habits, the
mean delay between assessments of intention and future behav-
ior was 49.67 days, and the mean delay between assessments
of past and future behaviors was 55.83 DEMO For domains not
conducive to habits, the mean delay for both DEMO and past
behavior was 79.75 days. Given that greater delay should be
associated with less predictive power of intentions and of past
behavior, delay could not have accounted for the differential
impact of intention and past DEMO within each study
grouping.
Second, our findings do not appear to DEMO due to problems with
the reliability or the variability of the past-behavior measure in
domains not conducive to habits. Low reliability or minimal

Methodological Moderators
We DEMO past behavior to be more closely related to mea-
sures of intention that were phrased in terms of expectancies
for future performance than to DEMO that specified conscious
plans to complete the act. Indeed, past behavior DEMO to be
a better predictor of behavioral expectations, r = .45 (study
outcomes, n = 13), than of behavioral intentions, r DEMO .40 (study
outcomes, n = 19); z0iff ..... = 3.02, p < .01. Thus, past behavior
was more strongly related to DEMO that reflected the simple
likelihood of the act in the future than to intentions that reflected
decisions to act.
We also examined whether the DEMO between past behavior
and intention depended on the order in which the variables were
measured in the reviewed studies. If intentions and past behavior
DEMO related because intentions are in part likelihood judgments
based on past incidence, then the relation between these vari-
ables should be stronger when past behavior is assessed prior
to intentions--thus, past action (or inaction) would be highly
salient--than when past behavior is assessed following inten-
tions. Indeed, past behavior proved to be a better predictor of
intention when it DEMO assessed first, r = .64 (study outcomes,
n = 5), than when intention was assessed first, r = .41 (study
DEMO, n = 28); Zdife ...... = 8.41, p < .001.
The number of items used in the questionnaires also emerged
as a DEMO in our review. Past-behavior measures composed
of more than one item were marginally more successful at pre-
dicting future behavior, r = ,45 (study outcomes, n = 6), than
measures composed of a single item, r = .38 (study outcomes,
n = 10),p < .07, for the comparison between different numbers
of items. Similarly, DEMO success in predicting intentions was
observed when the past-behavior measure was composed of
more than one item, r = .63 (study outcomes, n = 10), than
when composed of a single item, r = .39 (study outcomes, n
= 22), p < .001, for the comparison. Thus, studies that obtained
more reliable measures generated stronger effects.
Discussion
Past behavior emerged as an important predictor of future
behavior in DEMO studies in our review. Overall, when the findings
were aggregated across DEMO full set of studies, the magnitude of
the effect of past DEMO on future behavior, r = .39, p <
.001, was about comparable with that of other predictors. That
is, the impact of frequency of past behavior was slightly weaker
than that of intentions, r = .54, approximately the same size as
the effect of attitudes, DEMO = .33, and slightly stronger than the
effects of behavioral control (i.e., difficulty of performance), r
= -.21, and of subjective DEMO, r = .23.
The findings also provide good support for our DEMO
analysis of the multiple mechanisms through which past behav-
ior can affect future responses. Past behavior directly contri-
butes to future performance in contexts DEMO support the develop-
ment of habits. Behaviors that are well practiced and performed
in stable contexts are likely to be repeated because they can DEMO
performed quickly, relatively effortlessly, in parallel with other
activities, and DEMO minimal or sporadic attention (Bargh, 1989;
Logan, 1989). DEMO deliberation and decision making are
not required for performance of such acts. Although habitual
behaviors may be intentional and goal directed, the controlling
intentions are not typically accessible to consciousness, because
with repeated performance (a) intentions themselves tend to
become automatic; (b) intentions tend to be specified in an
efficient, stable, and general form that emphasizes the DEMO met
by the action rather than action details; and (c) DEMO, much
like the actions they direct, tend to be combined into broader
and more efficient units that refer to sets of behaviors that DEMO
together rather than to individual actions.
In our review, behavioral domains DEMO to habit forma-
tion were defined as those in which behaviors could be per-
formed on a daily or weekly basis in a stable, predictable sup-
porting context. These included alcohol and coffee consump-
tion, most types of exercise, seat belt use, and class and church

attendance. A path model that estimated future performance DEMO
these behaviors from past-behavior frequency and behavioral
intentions revealed a strong direct effect of past behavior on
future responses. Thus, for these types of behaviors, it appears
that frequent past performance reflects habits that automatically
guide future responses. Intentions had a much smaller effect in
these domains but DEMO a significant predictor of future
behavior.
We further anticipated that past behavior would have a mini-
mal direct effect on future responses when people DEMO
deliberate about actions. Conscious deliberation and decision
making likely are required to initiate and execute novel behav-
iors and behaviors that are performed in DEMO or changing
contexts. In these domains, past-behavior frequency is one factor
DEMO might inform participants' judgments of intention. In the
present review, we anticipated that conscious deliberation would
be required in domains that (a) DEMO minimal opportunity
for performance, in which behaviors occurred only annually or
DEMO and (b) presented unstable, shifting contexts that did
not provide DEMO constant set of cues supporting behavior perfor-
mance. In the present review, behaviors classified as low in
opportunity for performance and low in stability of supporting
context included voting, preventative health behaviors (e.g., get-
ting a flu shot or a mammogram), blood donation, and exercise
after childbirth or after experiencing a heart attack. In the path
model estimating DEMO performance of these behaviors based
on past behavior frequency and behavioral intentions, conscious
intentions emerged as a strong predictor. Past-act frequency had
a small although statistically significant effect on future re-
sponses. It seems that when DEMO is a function of conscious
decision making and deliberation, intentions directly DEMO be-
havior performance, and the effects of past behavior are likely
DEMO be mediated through conscious intents. Indeed, the correlation
between intention and DEMO behavior in this context (r = .40)
implies that intentions DEMO drawn from incidence of past be-
havior, with people reasoning that DEMO performed (or did not
perform) a behavior in the past and would continue to do so
(or not) in the future.
Deliberations DEMO future behavior likely include more than
just past behavior. According to Ajzen's (1987) theory of
planned behavior, intentions reflect attitudes toward the act,
subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The bivari-
ate correlation analyses were consistent with the idea that behav-
ioral intentions reflect these DEMO factors, especially in behav-
ioral domains that people encounter rarely or DEMO entail chang-
ing contexts. That is, attitudes and subjective norms had
DEMO strong effects on intentions in such contexts. This
coherence among intentions, DEMO, and norms is consistent
with the idea that people are deliberately DEMO about their
behavior in such domains. Reasoning how to act in these do-
mains is likely to render evaluative beliefs, normative beliefs,
and behavioral intents relatively consistent.
It is interesting that, contrary to the pattern that emerged with
attitudes and subjective norms as predictors of intention, past
behavior was more closely related to intention in domains in
which automatic, habitual tendencies were likely to develop
rather than in domains requiring conscious DEMO making.
Although we did not specifically anticipate this result, it is
DEMO with the idea that, when people are asked to give
conscious DEMO for habitual behaviors, they do not generate
especially thoughtful responses based DEMO their evaluations and
subjective norms. Instead, people may rely on salient, tangible
instances of past behavior, which should be especially accessible
in domains with high opportunity for performance.
In general, intention and past behavior appeared to alternate
as predictors of future acts. In domains that facilitated develop-
DEMO and execution of habits, past behavior was a strong pre-
dictor DEMO intention relatively weak. In domains that did not
facilitate habits, past DEMO was a relatively weak direct pre-
dictor and intention was quite strong. One interpretation of this
pattern is that intention effects emerge primarily in DEMO absence
of habit. We suspect that the relation between intention and
habit is actually more complex than suggested by such a broad
generalization, which does not allow for such phenomena as
New Year's resolutions, in which strongly held intentions can,
at least temporarily, override the effects of habit.
Interpreting Past Behavior Effects
Interpreting the effects of past behavior DEMO future acts has
been difficult because past behavior is itself a product of a
variety of psychological states. In the meta-analytic synthesis,
we DEMO able to eliminate several of the most obvious con-
founds. The counting analyses revealed that past behavior inde-
pendently predicted future behavior in studies DEMO had con-
ducted analyses controlling for the effects of intentions, attitudes
DEMO the act, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral con-
trol. Thus, DEMO effects of past behavior cannot be attributed to
these potential confounds.
However, the correlational nature of these data leaves open
the possibility that some additional unmeasured factor is con-
founded with past behavior frequency and is DEMO responsible
for the obtained pattern. Two explanations in particular merit
comment. Given that direct experience with an attitude object
yields attitudes (and perhaps intentions) that are held more
strongly and with greater certainty (Fazio, Chen, McDonel, &
Sherman, 1982; Petty & Krosnick, 1995), DEMO could be that fre-
quent past behavior increases the strength of attitudes. One index
of strength is the ease with which attitudes can be DEMO
from memory (Fazio, 1990), and it may be that past behavior
serves as a proxy for attitude accessibility.
In addition, past behavior could be confounded with beliefs
about the self. It could be that DEMO who report that they have
engaged in a behavior frequently in the past have a correspond-
ing self-concept, and it is this self-view that guides future perfor-
mance. Given the way that past behavior was measured DEMO the
reviewed studies, however, we do not find the self-concept ac-
count especially compelling. Participants in most of the studies
were asked to DEMO subjective estimates of the frequency with
which they performed the target behavior. Thus, respondents
who donated blood twice a year would rate on the scale that
they were "frequent" blood donors much like people who DEMO
coffee daily would rate that they were "frequent" coffee drink-
ers. It seems likely then that people who reported frequent per-
formance in DEMO two domains considered themselves regular
blood donors and coffee drinkers, although DEMO effects
emerged primarily with coffee-drinking type behaviors (i.e.,
when opportunity DEMO stability were high).
PAST BEHAVIOR PREDICTS FUTURE BEHAVIOR
67
Unfortunately, the information necessary to evaluate empiri-
cally these alternate interpretations of past behavior effects was
not provided DEMO the reviewed studies. However, primary research
data that address these issues DEMO available. As part of her disser-
tation research, Ouellette (1996) DEMO the role of behav-
ior frequency, context stability, attitude accessibility, DEMO self-
concept in predicting future behavior.
Ouellette's (1996) Investigation of Past Behavior
Effects on Future Behavior
In one part of this research, 141 Texas A&M University under-
graduate students completed a two-part experiment DEMO
their TV watching and their recycling behavior. In the first ses-
sion, they completed a series of questionnaire measures, evaluat-
ing (a) DEMO of past behavior (assessed from estimates of
the number of times, for each of the previous 6 months, that
participants had engaged in the behavior), (b) subjective norm
(rated on a 9-point scale evaluating whether "people whose
opinions are important to me think that it is good if I watch
TV/recycle" ranging from 1 [strongly disagree[ to 9 [strongly
agree]), (c) perceived behavioral control (rated on a 9-point
scale ranging from 1 [very easy] to 9 [very difficult]), (d)
intention to perform the act (rated on a 9-point scale ranging
from 1 [very unlikely] to 9 [very likely]), (e) self-concept
measures of whether participants thought of themselves as regu-
lar TV watchers or regular recyclers (on a 10-point scale ranging
from 1 [absolutely false] to 9 [absolutely true]), (f) an assess-
ment of DEMO that yielded favorability (across six 9-point
semantic differential scales for each DEMO), and (g) a com-
puterized assessment of attitude accessibility (DEMO, response la-
tency to rate the attitude on the scales; see Fazio, 1990).
TV watching and recycling would have been classified as
high-opportunity behaviors in the meta-analytic synthesis, be-
cause people can perform these behaviors on a daily or weekly
basis. However, even with frequent performance in a domain,
behaviors are likely to be repeated automatically only DEMO they
occur in stable, predictable contexts. To assess stability of the
DEMO context, participants completed an open response
measure in which they listed DEMO they would always do (if
anything) before watching TV and before recycling. The number
of factors listed were counted and, on the basis of this measure,
two groups of participants were selected. One group DEMO com-
posed of those who did not list any consistent antecedents to
performing the behavior (ns = 39 and 90 for watching TV and
recycling, respectively) and those who listed at least two stable
antecedents (ns = 33 and 9, for TV and recycling, respectively).
DEMO is interesting to note that frequency of past behavior was
correlated with the number of antecedents listed only for one
of the behaviors (rs = -.03, ns, and .35, p < .01, for watching
DEMO and recycling, respectively).
Three weeks later, participants were recontacted for an (os-
tensibly unrelated) telephone survey in which they reported the
DEMO with which they had watched TV and recycled during
the period since the first assessment. The correlations among
measures for each behavior are given DEMO Table 6.
We anticipated that the results of this study would parallel
those obtained in the meta-analytic synthesis. That is, in regres-
sion models predicting future behavior, frequency of past behav-
ior should interact with context stability. In stable contexts, past
behavior should be a strong, direct DEMO, whereas in unstable
contexts past-behavior effects should be mediated by intention,DEMO
and intention should be the primary predictor of future acts.
Furthermore, DEMO expected these patterns to obtain even when
other potential predictors of behavior were entered into the re-
gression models (i.e., self-concept and attitude DEMO).
We first constructed regression models to replicate the path
analysis in the meta-analytic synthesis. Frequency of future be-
havior was predicted from frequency DEMO past behavior, intention,
context, the interaction between past behavior and context, and
the interaction between intention and context. The results were
essentially identical across watching TV and recycling and well
replicated the meta-analytic findings: In the overall models, the
main effects for intention were significant (DEMO bs
= 2.14 and 0.80), t(68) = 3.09 and DEMO(97) = 4.47, ps < .01,
for TV and recycling, respectively, and the interactions between
past behavior and context approached significance (bs = 0.31

and 0.63), t(68) = 1.83 and t(97) = 3.34, ps < .07, for
TV and recycling. More important, when the simple regression
slopes within context were calculated for each behavior (see
Aiken & West, 1991), DEMO frequency of past behavior was a
predictor in stable contexts (bs DEMO 0.39 and 0.52), t(31) = 2.25
and t(6) = 7.06, ps < .05 for TV and recycling, respectively,
DEMO only intention was a strong predictor in unstable contexts
(bs -= DEMO and 0.80), t(37) = 3.85 and t(91) = 4.37, ps <
.001, for TV and recycling, respectively. As DEMO the meta-analytic
synthesis, for behaviors that are performed in stable contexts,DEMO
frequent past behavior reflects habitual tendencies and directly
determines future behavior. Conscious intentions had little ef-
fect, t(31) = 1.49 and t(DEMO) = 0.07, ns, for TV and recycling,
respectively. For DEMO that are performed in unstable con-
texts for which there are no established antecedents, frequent
past performance does not reflect habits; the effects DEMO past
behavior are then mediated by conscious intentions, and only
intention DEMO a direct predictor of future behavior. Past behavior
was not significant, DEMO(37) = 1.26 and t(91) = -0.82, ns.
Regression DEMO also were calculated to examine the ef-
fects of intention and past behavior in conjunction with attitude
accessibility and self-concept. We anticipated that the DEMO
of accessibility and self-concept would be similar to those of
intention in these models. That is, automatic repetition of fre-
quently performed behavior in stable contexts should emerge
after controlling for the effects of accessibility and DEMO
Furthermore, because accessibility and self-concept reflect many
factors in addition to DEMO of past behavior, we anticipated
that these factors would independently predict DEMO behavior.
Bivariate correlations between the variables in the model, which
were DEMO separately for high- and low-stability contexts,
are presented in Tables 7 and 8. The regression models are
presented in Tables 9 and 10. DEMO the large number of pre-
dictors and the relatively small sample size, we were unable to
include in the models any interactions but the two-way interac-
tions between past behavior and other factors (see design in
Tables 9 and 10). Essentially, the findings again replicated the
meta-analytic results and suggested that past behavior had
unique effects on future behavior. DEMO is, the Past Behavior x
Context interactions were significant in the DEMO models in
both behavioral domains. Furthermore, in the simple effects
decomposition DEMO context, past behavior was a significant
predictor within stable but not DEMO contexts. Also as pre-
dicted, conscious judgments, self-concept and intention in par-
ticular, were significant predictors in unstable but not stable
contexts. In unstable contexts, future TV watching behavior was
a function of conscious inferences about the self, and frequency
of recycling was a function of conscious intentions, s Attitude
accessibility, however, had no effect in any context, and includ-
ing this term did not weaken the predictive power of past
behavior.
These findings provide strong support for our theorizing about
the DEMO under which past behavior directly affects future
performance and when it has an indirect effect, mediated
through intention. The results also demonstrate that past-behav-
ior effects are not confounded with attitude accessibility or with
the self-concept DEMO, in support of the meta-analytic findings,
that past-behavior effects are DEMO confounded with intentions,
attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived control.
8 We also computed these analyses substituting the components of
behavioral intention (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behav-
ioral control) for the DEMO predictor, and the results were largely
consistent with those reported in DEMO text. The overall models predicted
future behavior from attitude, subjective norm, past behavior, context,
perceived control, attitude accessibility, self-concept, and DEMO two-way
interactions among context and past behavior, attitude, subjective norm,
accessibility, perceived control, and self-concept. For recycling, signifi-
cant relations included subjective norm, perceived control, and Past
Behavior X Context (ps < .05). For watching TV, significant relations
included self-concept, Past Behavior DEMO Context, and Self-Concept ×
Context (ps < .05). As with the models reported in the text, we then
computed simple effects analyses examining the predictors within levels
of context. For recycling, subjective norm and perceived control pre-
dicted future behavior (p s < .05) in DEMO contexts, and only past
behavior approached significance, t(3) = DEMO, p < .15 (all other ts <
1 ) in DEMO contexts. For watching TV, only self-concept predicted future
behavior (p < .001 ) in unstable contexts, and only past behavior was
a significant predictor (p < .05) in stable contexts.

often they engage in a target behavior and DEMO they do so
"by force of habit" or "without awareness" (e.g., Mittal, 1988;
Towler & Shepherd, 1992; Wittenbraker, DEMO, & Kahle, 1983).
We are skeptical, however, that people can accurately answer
questions that require them to distinguish between behaviors
that DEMO generated through automatic mechanisms and behaviors
that reflect conscious decision making. Alternately, Verplanken,
Aarts, van Knippenberg, and van Knippenberg (1994) assessed
transportation habits from people's estimates of how they would
perform everyday DEMO mentioned in a series of scenarios (e.g.,
going to the DEMO). Although this measure proved to be
moderately correlated with the standard assessment of past act
frequency (rs ranged from .31 to .42), it yielded unique effects
on information acquisition that were not demonstrated by DEMO
past-behavior measure. Thus, scenario estimates appear to have
information-processing implications that DEMO not found with esti-
mates of frequency of past behavior. It may be that these reflect
behavioral scripts (Schank & Abelson, 1977) as well as habit.
At least in contexts conducive to habit formation and DEMO
mance, then, past behavior may be the best indicator of habit
strength.
The validity of past behavior as an indicator of habit depends
DEMO on how accurately people can report on their past
acts. Reports of act frequency are likely to be more accurate
with rating scales that DEMO numbers of acts than with scales
that use adjectives to reflect frequency (e.g., often, sometimes,
rarely). Adjective estimates are ambiguous, DEMO their meaning
varies with a given behavioral domain. In domains with low
rates of occurrence in daily life, such as donating blood, respon-
DEMO could claim frequent performance with only two or three
instances of the behavior in a year. Alternately, in domains with
high rates of occurrence, such as drinking coffee, respondents
could claim seldom or infrequent performance DEMO engaging in
the behavior once a week. In addition, rating scales DEMO tap
respondents' estimates of the rate at which they perform a DEMO
havior, such as the typical number of times per week one DEMO
breakfast, are often easier to complete and may be more accurate
DEMO scales that encourage enumeration of specific instances,
such as recalling each instance of breakfast in the past 2 weeks
(Blair & Burton, DEMO; Menon, 1993). Because respondents
will have forgotten many specific instances, enumeration can
lead to underreports of behavior frequency. Accuracy of behav-
ioral reports also depends on the inference rules that respondents
use to generalize DEMO their recall of specific episodes or occur-
rence rates (Schwarz, 1990). Questions that emphasize the use
of accurate rules (e.g., raising DEMO possibility of changes in
frequency of performance across the estimation period) DEMO most
likely to yield valid estimates of past behavior.
Further precision in the measurement of habit may be gained
by considering the goals that DEMO motivated past behavior. For
example, Aarts and Dijksterhuis (1997) activated DEMO number of
everyday transportation goals (e.g., going shopping) for people
DEMO in the past had frequently used a bicycle to meet those
goals. These people easily and quickly decided what mode of
transportation to use DEMO presented with relevant situational
cues (e.g., grocery store). However, DEMO the transportation
goals were not made salient, people's responses were DEMO faster
to the situational cues than responses of people who did not
have a habit of bicycle use. It seems, then, that cognitive DEMO
sentations of the links between behavior and context were acti-
vated only with relevant goals. Especially for behaviors that can
serve multiple goals, it may be useful in future work to assess
habits while the particular DEMO that has directed past behavior
is salient (see also Aarts, Paulussen, & Schaalma, 1997).
Conclusion
The present review was designed to DEMO habit into con-
temporary approaches to the prediction of social behavior by
demonstrating its empirical independence from other predictors
and by explaining how its DEMO derives from the cognitive
processes and goal specification associated with well-practiced
behaviors in constant contexts.
Theoretical understanding of habits has practical use; it en-
ables social scientists to devise more effective strategies to help
people initiate DEMO behavior and change existing behavior. Alter-
ing frequently performed behavior in constant contexts requires
conscious decision making to devise and implement new re-
sponses DEMO to suppress or divert any well-practiced behavior
that might be cued by the environment (e.g., sidetracking; see
Guthrie, 1935; James, 1890)DEMO Specifically, effective change strat-
egies are likely to include the formulation DEMO explicit plans to
initiate and implement a new behavior (Gollwitzer, 1996). If
the new behavior then accomplishes one's current goals without
DEMO other valued outcomes, conscious intentions to initiate
and perform the new DEMO are likely to remain strong.
A potential point of failure in implementing behavior change
decisions arises when the behavior has long-term rather than
short-term DEMO (Aarts, Paulussen, & Schaalma, 1997). For
example, people DEMO be convinced that they should adopt a
healthier lifestyle, but when DEMO formulate and then implement
plans to do so, they experience little DEMO evidence that
the new responses (e.g., increasing exercise, following a DEMO
fat diet) enhance well being. In addition to experiencing uncer-
tainty DEMO apprehension about how to perform the new behaviors
(outcomes likely with DEMO shift in response), the healthy behav-
iors themselves may, in DEMO short run, appear to diminish enjoy-
ment in life. Given the DEMO of immediate evidence that the new
responses will yield positive outcomes, DEMO people will not
persist. They will not exert deliberate control of performance
details until the new behavior is established with sufficient
strength to proceed DEMO without conscious awareness
of intent and to reveal its long-term benefits. Old habits are then
likely to be maintained because of the speed and DEMO with
which past patterns of behavior can be initiated and executed,
because the old behaviors are cued by prevailing environmental
events, and because these patterns are not inconsistent with
short-term goals.
The most effective change DEMO are likely to be ones that
impede performance of established behavior while facilitating
formation of new behaviors into habits. For example, shifts in
the supporting environment can derail the automatic cueing and
execution of old habits DEMO increase the importance of conscious
intentions. To maintain intentions to adopt a healthier lifestyle,
change strategies should ensure that some immediate, positive
consequences emerge from the new healthy behavior. In addi-
tion, effective strategies should provide the opportunity for repe-
tition of the new behavior in a DEMO supporting environment.
