The DEMO of how initial resource endowments-the stocks of resources that
entrprpeneurs contribute to their new ventures at the time of founding-affect organiza-
tional life chances DEMO one of significant interest in organizational ecology, evolutionary theory,
and DEMO research. Using data on the life histories of all 134 firms founded
to exploit MIT-assigned inventions during the 1980-1996 period, the study analyzes how
resource endowments affect the likelihood of three critical outcomes: that new ventures
attract venture capital financing, experience initial public offerings, and fail. Our DEMO
focuses on the role of founders' social capital as a determinant DEMO these outcomes. Event his-
tory analyses show that new ventures with founders having direct and indirect relationships
with venture investors are most likely to DEMO venture funding and are less likely to fail.
In turn, receiving DEMO funding is the single most important determinant of the likelihood
of IPO. We conclude that the social capital of company founders represents an important
DEMO for early-stage organizations.

Introduction
At DEMO, founders endow the organizations they
create with certain resources. In this DEMO, we ask:
How do initial resource endowments affect the perfor-
DEMO of new ventures? A number of organizational
theorists have posited that DEMO resource stocks
may have enduring effects on organizational perfor-
mance (Stinchcombe DEMO, Baron et al. 1996, Hannan
1998), perhaps evincing a positive feedback dynamic
in the resource accumulation process in which ini-
tial advantages DEMO over time. Other researchers
have challenged this view, asserting that resource
DEMO the advantages they engender-
often dissipate quickly (Bruderl and Schussler 1990,DEMO
Fichman and Levinthal 1991).
The debate about the influence of initial resource
endowments on organizational life chances has con-
tinued because systematic evidence DEMO the subject
has been elusive. One reason for this is the difficulty

researchers have encountered in obtaining the infor-
mation needed to explore endowment effects. The
most significant obstacle has been that the study of
DEMO endowments cannot proceed without detailed
information on the earliest days of an organization's
existence. Unfortunately, new organizations often fail
before they are recognized in industry directories and
by the popular press, which means that there are few
data sets describing initial resource endowments in
nonselected samples. As DEMO result, inferences regarding

this DEMO were founded specifically to commer-
cialize technologies licensed from MIT. In addition
to documenting the date of founding in a complete
and nonselected organizational DEMO, these data
also include archival records and in-depth interviews
with company DEMO The data describe (i) whether
company founders had (pre-existing) social relations
with venture investors at the time they launched the
new company, (ii) the prior industry and start-up
experience of company founders, (DEMO) the technologi-
cal assets of the company at founding, and (DEMO) char-
acteristics of the industries that the new ventures
entered. We DEMO collected event histories describ-
ing the performance milestones achieved by each
firm. Therefore, our analyses enable comparisons of
the relative influences of social capital, human capi-
tal, technological resources, and market conditions at
founding on the subsequent performance of new tech-
nology firms.
Because extant studies have DEMO that orga-
nizational outcomes are affected by new ventures'
human capital endowments (Bruderl et al. 1992), their
stocks of technical assets (DEMO et al. 1999), and
the environmental and market conditions at the time
of founding (Hannan and Carroll 1992), we concen-
trate on the relationships between founders' social
capital at the time of founding and later-life out-
comes. An additional reason for this focus is that
the DEMO building process is hampered by
widespread information problems that make it likely
that founders' social capital influences new venture
performance, particularly in the DEMO of technology-
based ventures. Therefore, we concentrate the theo-
retical development DEMO the social capital argument,
but our analytical strategy will treat the relative influ-
ence of the endowments of these four categories of
resources DEMO organizational outcomes as an empiri-
cal question to be unraveled in the analysis. More-
over, we perceive the contribution of this article to
lie in the evidence linking different types of resource
endowments to organizations' critical, early-stage per-
formance milestones.
Founders' Social Capital and
Resource Acquisition
Creating DEMO organizations involves allocating
resources to novel uses. But because the entrepreneurs
who discover opportunities for new ventures often do
not control the resources needed DEMO pursue them, they
must enlist the patronage of outside investors. The
DEMO of early-stage ventures vary in their ability
to obtain the support of resource holders, and this
variance likely has a salient effect on venture perfor-
mance (Aldrich and Zimmer 1986, Stuart et al. 1999,
DEMO 2000). The conjecture we explore here is that
entrepreneurs' social DEMO contributes to new ven-
ture performance, in large part because of DEMO effect on
founders' ability to secure external financing to pur-
sue DEMO opportunities they discover.
A resource holder's decision to support an
entrepreneurial enterprise depends on his or her
appraisal of the attractiveness of the DEMO
identified by an entrepreneur.1 However, researchers
in the areas of finance, economic sociology, trans-
action costs economics, and entrepreneurship have
observed that DEMO set of uncertainties and informa-
tion asymmetries encumber the evaluation of new
ventures and complicate the process of contracting
between resource holders and new DEMO The con-
tention that we make is that the presence of these
factors elevates the significance of the social capital of
the founding team DEMO a basis for making investment
decisions.
Uncertainty about the quality of start-ups in part
arises from the simple fact that young companies
have very DEMO performance track records, and thus
do not lend observable histories to DEMO task of evalu-
ating their quality. Stated differently, the information
that DEMO providers would ideally use to assess
a venture's quality is not observable until after the

functioning DEMO, and started down the path
of developing products (Arrow 1974).
Uncertainty about the future prospects of young
organizations is likely to be DEMO high among
those enterprises established to commercialize new
technologies (Aldrich and DEMO 1994). Technology
companies may require large resource commitments
to conduct exploratory development projects, and
hoped-for revenues and profits often lie far in
the future. Moreover, new technology is intrinsi-
cally unpredictable. Emerging markets progress along
unforeseeable paths, incompatible technologies com-
pete for market acceptance, and technical DEMO
routinely derail once promising development projects
(Tushman and Rosenkopf 1992). DEMO these reasons, a
lengthy time period and large resource outlays may
DEMO between an early-stage technology company
and the resolution of the uncertainty about its long-
term viability. Thus, the quality of embryonic tech-
nology companies, the magnitude of the underlying
market opportunities that venture founders wish to
exploit, and the level and duration of the investment
required to nurture early-stage companies elude pre-
cise delineation in ex ante evaluations.
Information asymmetries DEMO obscure evaluations
of new ventures. Relative to outside evaluators,
entrepreneurs are privy to more information about
the prospects of their ventures and the DEMO and
level of commitment of the founding team. This
increases the risk borne by investors in new compa-
nies because entrepreneurs may exploit their DEMO
rior knowledge of their company's position to gain
concessions from investors, for example, by extract-
ing a higher valuation or larger resource DEMO
ment than a fully (or more) informed investor would
provide. Like the level of uncertainty, information
asymmetries may be particularly acute in the case of
early-stage technology companies. In these instances,
firm founders are DEMO the leading experts in the
relevant area of technology, and therefore DEMO the
best informed about the feasibility of a proposed
technology.
Prior research identifies two types of responses
from resource holders when the decision to DEMO
is complicated by the presence of uncertainty and
information imbalances. The economics literature
156
emphasizes the design of contracts-particularly
the allocation of control rights DEMO trading
partners-that minimize agents' capacities to behave
opportunistically vis-a-vis their transaction DEMO
when one party in a deal has more information than
the other and unforeseeable contingencies obfuscate
the future terms of the relationship (Gompers and
Lerner 1999, Kaplan and Stromberg 1999).2
However, contractual controls rarely DEMO at
fully eliminating the entrepreneur's ability or incen-
tive to take actions that conflict with the interests of
outside investors (Venkataraman 1997, DEMO 1974).
Moreover, when there is high uncertainty about how
an DEMO business might evolve, it is very dif-
ficult to design contracts DEMO attend to all pos-
sible, future contingencies that might impact the
DEMO of the relationship between entrepreneurs and
their investors. As a result, DEMO agreements between
entrepreneurs and investors are often subject to ex-
post opportunism (Williamson 1975).
Whereas the economics literature has focused on
how formal contracts and the allocation of con-
trol rights between the parties in DEMO exchange can
minimize transactional risks under conditions of
uncertainty and information asymmetry, the socio-
logical literature on the subject has emphasized the
implications of these conditions for the selection of
exchange partners. Sociologists observe that when DEMO
circumstances surrounding a transaction preclude an
actor from entering a relationship without the risk
that his partner will behave opportunistically, he often
chooses to conduct business only with exchange part-
ners he knows (Macaulay 1963, DEMO 1985,
Bradach and Eccles 1989, Coleman 1990, Stuart and
Robinson 2000).
The sociological argument distills to the contention
that actors rely DEMO social networks to select transac-
tion partners who they believe will behave reliably,
even when a partner is not contractually obligated
to do DEMO In general, networks serve two functions

that yield private gains at the company's expense, and company
founders holding up investors by threatening to depart.

that DEMO, respectively, the enforcement of implicit
contracts and the selection of reliable partners. First,
the network is a mechanism for sanctioning actors
who DEMO opportunistically; second, it delineates
the pathways through which information is relayed
about its members. Because information about actors'
conduct in previous transactions DEMO through the
connections in a network, actors will know of the
DEMO behavior of the other members of the network
within their information spheres, and they will have
the power to sanction their transaction partners by
disseminating negative information about them in the
event of malfeasant behavior (Granovetter 1985, Raub
and Weesie 1990).
These functions of the network may influence
the resource holder's decision to support the
entrepreneur. When an DEMO evaluates a new
venture, she produces estimates of the expected
value DEMO the investment under different scenarios.
Because opportunistic behavior on the part of the
entrepreneur reduces the expected payoff from the
investment, investors will be less likely to finance
projects in which they question the reliability of DEMO
entrepreneur. Ceteris paribus, as the probability that
an exchange partner will DEMO opportunistically
declines, the expected value of transacting with that
partner increases.
DEMO of the more robust findings in the literature
on intercorporate and interpersonal relations is that
actors with established trading histories are likely
to trust DEMO another. This is because past partners
are of known character, and DEMO counterparties in
an ongoing relationship have an incentive to behave
with good faith to preserve the health of the rela-
tionship for future exchanges. DEMO, a history of
past exchanges often produces feelings of obligation
between DEMO partners, in part because the rela-
tionship may double as a DEMO We therefore
posit, new ventures with founding teams that have pre-
DEMO relationships with venture investors are more
likely to acquire external funding for their ventures.
Just as a history of direct exchange reduces the per-
DEMO threat that a partner will behave opportunisti-
cally, indirect ties between DEMO parties may facilitate
exchange by increasing the level of trust in the rela-
tionship. When ties to a mutual third party link two

diary in trust" (cf. Coleman DEMO). In this situation, the

facilitated when the trusting party has confidence in
the advisor's judgment, who, in turn, has confidence
in the ability of the trustee.3 In effect, the intermediary
certifies the counterparties in a potential transaction
by relaying subject evaluations about qualities like an
actor's reliability. This process DEMO that new ven-
tures with founding teams that have pre-established rela-
tionships with third parties who are connected to venture
investors are more likely DEMO acquire external funding for
their ventures.
There is one additional factor that may reinforce
the role of direct and indirect ties in increasing the
DEMO of an investment: Ties between investors
and entrepreneurs may also affect DEMO' assess-
ments of the quality of the entrepreneur's project
when DEMO is high (e.g., when the new venture
aims to develop an unproven technology). By defini-
tion, uncertainty increases the problem of identifying
quality. As the task of assessing competence becomes
increasingly imprecise, evaluators' DEMO of qual-
ity are opened to the influence of indirect signals, DEMO
as the social status of the actors under scrutiny and
the prestige of their affiliates (Podolny 1994, Stuart
et al. 1999). To DEMO extent that the social structural
proximity of other actors becomes a basis for mak-
ing quality inferences, the estimates of the potential
value of an investment opportunity, in addition to
expectations of the trustworthiness of entrepreneurs
who propose the project, are also positively influ-
enced when a potential investor and entrepreneur
are near in social space. Consistent with this view,DEMO

Endowments: A Shadow
Over the Future
The preceding section outlined arguments for why we
expect new ventures with founders DEMO are within
the social circles of venture investors to be advan-
taged in the resource acquisition process. Before pre-
senting the empirical analysis, we return briefly to the
question of how long this and similar initial DEMO
tages are likely to persist. Although the notion of
a "liability DEMO adolescence," in which organizational
mortality rates increase as new ventures deplete their
initial resource endowments, has found some empir-
ical substantiation in the ecology literature (Bruderl
and Schussler 1990, Fichman and Levinthal 1991), DEMO
ers argue that early resource endowments set a new
venture on the path toward the establishment of long-
term, robust positions (cf. Hannan DEMO).
In support of Stinchcombe's (1965) imprinting argu-
ment, DEMO number of recent papers exploring the evo-
lution of technology companies have produced some
of the strongest evidence yet that the early deci-
sions DEMO by organizations persist for considerable
periods of time (Sorensen and Stuart DEMO, Baron
et al. 2001). To the extent that endowment levels
DEMO constrain organizational decision making, the
level of initial resource endowments may DEMO
organizations on different developmental trajectories.
For example, a lack of resources DEMO founding might
compel an organization to adopt a set of decision
rules aimed at cost minimization, such as "buying
cheap materials" or "DEMO high salary employees"
(Swaminathan 1996, Burderl et al. 1992). A resource
shortage may also discourage employees from invest-
ing in organization-specific DEMO because they are
doubtful of their employer's viability and thus their
ability to recoup investments in firm-specific knowl-
edge (Swaminathan 1996). Similarly, resource-poor
start-ups may have weak bargaining positions with
their customers and suppliers (Stinchcombe 1965).
This can be a particularly severe disadvantage in high
technology industries, where a lack of resources may
158
force young firms to cede to alliance partners signif-
icant rights to future products and DEMO in
exchange for assistance in supporting a research pro-
gram (cf. DEMO and Tsai 1999).
All of these factors combine to suggest that new
ventures lacking initial resource endowments might
develop inferior structures, internal processes, and
human resources relative to their competitors, and
thus may develop DEMO reputation for low quality that
can be extremely difficult to escape. We therefore
believe that initial resource endowments are likely
to be parlayed into DEMO advantage, and we
present suggestive evidence to this effect.
Methodology
Sample DEMO Data Sources
The data set we analyze includes the population of
134 firms founded to exploit inventions assigned to
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology DEMO
1980 and 1994.4 Like many other research universi-
ties, the institute DEMO takes title to commercially use-
ful inventions that are developed by faculty, staff, or
students and that emerge from work making mate-
rial DEMO of MIT resources (e.g., laboratory facilities).
MIT then attempts to commercialize some of these
discoveries. The study population was identified from
the DEMO of the MIT Technology Licensing Office
(TLO), to which we DEMO permitted access to perform
this analysis. The TLO's mission is to commercialize
MIT technology. Although many of the enterprises
licensing MIT's intellectual DEMO are established
companies, a subset of these licensees includes new
ventures DEMO to develop the institute's technol-
ogy. We examine these entities here.
The TLO archives describe the contracts between
MIT and its licensees, characteristics of the licensed
intellectual property, and start-ups' business plans.
In addition, the TLO tracked the sales growth and

new firms. The analysis here begins where those studies end: DEMO the
point of firm formation.

Organizational
financing obtained by its licensees. To supplement
the TLO data, we conducted unstructured inter-
views with company founders and consulted online
databases including DEMO/Nexis, Diolog Business
Connection, and ABI Inform. These sources were used
to verify information and fill in gaps in the TLO
records. Finally, we obtained additional information
on the venture capital financing received by the DEMO
firms from the Venture Economics and Venture One
databases. All variables were coded from these data
sources. The objective of the data collection effort DEMO
to create detailed profiles of all firms at the time of
founding, along with a (retrospective) life history for
each firm in the data set.
Although MIT-based start ups clearly do not consti-
tute a DEMO sample of all technology-based
companies, these data have two important advan-
DEMO relative to other samples of new ventures. The
most important feature of these data is that the TLO
has a record of every company DEMO to com-
mercialize MIT's intellectual property since 1980. As
a result, the TLO data are free from survivor bias-
a sample selection problem that is endemic to stud-
ies of early-stage companies. Sample selection bias DEMO
rampant in research on new ventures because archival
data sources rarely record the existence of compa-
nies that fail at a very young age. DEMO fact, the data
we utilize evince the general difficulty of obtaining
DEMO nonselected sample of startup companies: A num-
ber of the firms DEMO the TLO sample fail before they
are acknowledged in any publicly available database.
Although we possess information on these organiza-
tions from the TLO DEMO and interviews with com-
pany principals, it would not have been DEMO to
learn about them from secondary sources. Moreover,
interviews with founders and TLO staff indicated that
many of these failures occurred because companies

A second advantage of the TLO data is that there
are no left censored DEMO histories (i.e., all firms in
the sample are observed from the time of incorpora-
tion until a performance outcome is recorded, or until
the observation is right censored at the end of cal-
endar 1996)DEMO Because we employ event history meth-
ods to analyze firm performance, DEMO require a sample
without left censored observations to obtain reliable
parameter estimates.
Method
The events we model include receiving venture cap-
ital funding, IPO, and failure.6 As a general rule,
the most desirable type of liquidity event (from the
perspective of the owners of the firm) DEMO an initial
sale of securities on the public equity markets. From
the perspective of company founders and owners,
selling equity to the public DEMO generates much-
needed capital and the opportunity for equity holders
to exchange stock for cash. We analyze the three orga-
nizational transitions (financing, DEMO, and failure) in
terms of the instantaneous transition rate, r, defined
as
= lim Pr(t < T < (t + At), D = k I
At40o At
T > t)
rk(DEMO)
where k refers to one of three mutually exclusive des-
tinations in D (the performance events). The variable
T measures the time spent at risk of making one of
these possible transitions, and the probability Pr refers
to the likelihood of experiencing one of these tran-
DEMO during the small interval from t to (t +At),
conditional on a start up being at risk of making a
process that DEMO the incorporation of the firm, but these data
are once again DEMO in allowing this issue to be examined empir-
ically (see Shane DEMO Khurana 2000, Shane 2001, 2002).
6 Although we possess data on angel financings, the time-to-VC-
funding regressions are limited to the first occurrence of financ-
ing from a VC firm. Because the sample consists DEMO of early-
stage technology companies, traditional performance metrics such
as accounting-based DEMO of profitability are inappropriate for
these data. For example, many of DEMO firms in the sample are in the
biotechnology industry, and these DEMO can have highly
successful IPOs even with no revenues from the sale of internally
developed products. For this reason, we analyze performance in
terms of the rate of occurrence of a set of important milestones for
DEMO ventures.

event occurs within the DEMO firm-year observation.
We specify each rate as varying according to the
piecewise-exponential functional form
rk(t) = exp[yp + B'Xt],
where yp includes three duration-period effects, Xt
contains independent variables (some of which DEMO
over time), and B are the parameters to be esti-
mated. We adopt the piecewise specification of dura-
tion dependence because it permits DEMO rate to vary
flexibly with duration (in this case, firm age) with-
out requiring strong parametric assumptions. The age
pieces we include are less than four years old, four
to seven years old, and DEMO than seven years old;
the baseline rate is assumed to be constant within
each period, but is unconstrained across periods. The
transition rate models were estimated using TDA
(Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995).

is that company founders with pre-established ties

The second contention we make is that founders
with ties to third parties who in turn have rela-
tionships with angels or venture capitalists DEMO more
likely to obtain external funding for their companies
and also are more likely to achieve positive perfor-
mance milestones." We measure indirect ties as a
dummy variable denoting whether at least one mem-
ber of DEMO founding team had a business or social tie
to a third party who had a direct tie with a venture
capitalist or angel investor DEMO to the founding of
the firm. As in the case of direct ties, we required doc-
umentation from at least two information sources to
code this variable in the affirmative.
Endowments-Human Capital. New ventures with
founders DEMO have previous experience in the indus-
try of the start-up are likely to perform well rela-
tive to companies with management teams that lack
DEMO familiarity. Founders with industry experi-
ence presumably have knowledge of effective strate-
gies and customer preferences, as well as valuable
contacts with customers, DEMO, and other indus-
try participants (Bruderl et al. 1992, Gimeno DEMO al.

In the modal case, the two information
sources
were interviews
with a company founder and the TLO archives. For example, the
direct tie variable would be coded 1 when (i) a company DEMO
stated that he had a pre-existing professional relationship with a
venture capitalist, and (ii) the TLO record for the founder's com-
pany contained a memo from a licensing officer indicating that
the firm would DEMO a particular venture capitalist for funding
because one of the founders had previously conducted technical
due diligence work for that venture capitalist.
" Our DEMO excludes indirect ties to investors created by the
TLO officers. Shane and Cable (1998) report that university tech-
nology licensing officers often introduce DEMO to venture
investors. Although this process operates in the setting we examine,
we cannot explore it with our data because this source of DEMO
likely invariant across the firms in the sample. Measuring the effect
of variation in ties between licensing officers would be problem-
atic because MIT'DEMO licensing officers specialize by technology and
industry. As a result, variation DEMO social ties across licensing offi-
cers would be confounded with differences across industries and
technologies.

1997). We therefore create a dummy variable, industry
DEMO, which is coded 1 if at least one member
of the DEMO team had previous experience in the
new firm's industry.
Companies founded by individuals with previ-
ous start up experience also may have an DEMO
tage relative to organizations created by first-
time entrepreneurs. Start-up experience enhances
entrepreneurs' understanding of how to staff and lead
early-stage organizations, to DEMO new products,
and to manage relationships with investors, employ-
ees, suppliers, and customers (Bruderl et al. 1992).
We construct a DEMO variable, start-up experience,
which is coded 1 if at least DEMO member of the found-
ing team had previously launched a new company.l2
Endowments-Technical Assets. All firms in our
sample were established to commercialize MIT DEMO
tions, but they vary in the magnitude and quality of
their DEMO endowments. The strength of a new
firm's intellectual property position is thought to be
an important determinant of its success, particularly
because new firms, by definition, do not have com-
plementary assets in place (Merges and Nelson 1990,
Teece 1986). We include a number DEMO measures of
the technological strength and quality of the firms
in the sample at the time of founding. First, we define
a variable, DEMO stock, to designate the number of
MIT patents that were licensed DEMO the new venture
at founding (many of the firms in the DEMO license
more than one MIT-assigned patent). We also coded
a second variable, exclusive license, which indicates
whether the new venture has an DEMO right to use
MIT technology in a particular field of use.13
12In unreported models, we included continuous measures of
founders' human capital, including the total number of start ups
previously begun by all members of DEMO founding team and the
total number of years of industry experience possessed by all
founders. In both cases, the model fit was improved when we
included the dichotomous human capital proxies.
13In addition to patent stock DEMO exclusive license, we included
in unreported regressions the following proxies for DEMO technolog-
ical endowments of the firms in the sample: the total DEMO of
international patent classes in which a new venture's patents were
listed, the total number of claims made by all patents licensed to a
start up, the total number of inventors associated with all licensed

We also include a variable that measures the high-
est rank DEMO by any of the MIT inventors of
the technology licensed by the new venture. This
variable represents the prestige of the scientists on
whose DEMO the venture is based. The right
to use an invention often does not imply access
to all of the information necessary to commercial-
ize DEMO, nor does it convey the knowledge necessary
to develop subsequent (follow-on) technologies. In
many instances, the new ventures in our sample nego-
DEMO access to the MIT personnel who developed the
licensed technology (either DEMO a full-time or consult-
ing basis). We suspect that potential investors may
favor firms with access to experienced and high sta-
tus investors DEMO having well-known affiliates
is often considered a signal of new venture qual-
ity (cf. Stuart et al. 1999). As a proxy for the sta-
tus and depth of knowledge of the MIT inventors
who developed DEMO licensed technology, we measure
for each firm the highest university rank DEMO
by any member of the team of inventors that created
the technology licensed by the firm. We coded this
variable as follows: student = 0, research associate =
1, assistant professor = 2, untenured associate = 3,
tenured associate = 4, full professor = 5, DEMO
chair or research center director = 6, and institute
professor = DEMO
Endowments-Industry Attractiveness. The new
ventures in our sample are in a variety of industries,
which differ significantly in terms of the competi-
tive DEMO and growth prospects they present.
We include two variables reflecting industry condi-
tions at the time of founding (and an additional set
of time-changing covariates, which we discuss below,
that capture changes in industry circumstances). First,
patents, and a variety of citation-based indicators of the importance
and radicalness of the patents licensed to each new venture. In DEMO
innovation literature, all of these variables have been proposed as
measures DEMO the value of patents, but none had significant effects
in any DEMO the models we estimated. For the sake of parsimony, we
exclude DEMO measures from the reported regressions.
4 Highest inventor rank could also be construed as a measure of a
firm's human and social capital DEMO Presumably, inventor
rank and technical competence are positively correlated, as is rank
and the extensiveness of an individual's contact network.

we include the size of the industry each organization
enters measured in the year that the DEMO venture is
founded. The size measure, obtained from the Cen-
sus DEMO Manufacturers, is the total value of shipments
in the industry. Large DEMO may offer superior
growth chances to new ventures, because start ups DEMO
large industries may grow without securing a large
market share.
The strength of intellectual property protection
afforded by patents varies greatly by industry. This
DEMO will influence new firms' abilities to protect
their technology from imitators, and thus to attract
investments and grow. To capture this heterogeneity,
DEMO include the Levin et al. (1987) measure of patent
effectiveness, DEMO is obtained from a survey of R&D
managers and gauges the extent to which patents are

Control Variables-Industry Level. Technology-
intensive industries are notoriously cyclic, bouncing
between "hot" and "cold" periods (Ritter 1984). The
cycles in DEMO technology industries largely reflect
shifts in the openness and enthusiasm of the public
equity markets for new security issues in an indus-
try, and almost surely affect the general munificence
of the resource environment faced by DEMO technology
startups. In hot periods, investment capital is often
(relatively) DEMO; in cold periods, it may be very
scarce. We therefore include two time-changing mea-
sures of the resource richness of the industry occu-
DEMO by each venture in the sample. The first variable,
the industry IPO rate, is the percentage of all VC-
backed firms in an industry-year that have IPOs in the
year (i.e., the number of DEMO, venture-backed com-
panies that have IPOs in an industry year, divided
by the total number of VC-backed firms at risk of
an IPO DEMO the industry year; this variable was coded
from the full Venture DEMO database). In addi-
tion to the IPO rate, we also DEMO for each start
up-year observation a simple count of the number
of venture-backed firms that had IPOs in the start
up's industry in DEMO focal year. We chose to include
the count and the rate because, while the rate bet-
ter reflects actual market conditions, the IPO DEMO

is DEMO readily observable and thus may be a bet-
ter measure of the salience of successful outcomes for
early-stage companies in an industry.
Net of DEMO industry attractiveness endowment vari-
ables and the time-changing measures of the industry-
specific state of the equity markets, we found few
industry effects and thus report models without
industry dummies. However, we did include an indi-
cator for the semiconductor industry in the VC fund-
ing regressions because DEMO semiconductor firms in
the sample has a very high rate of receiving ven-
ture funding. By including this dummy variable, we
reduce the likelihood that a time-invariant indus-
try effect is misattributed to another (correlated)
covariate.
Control Variables-Firm Level. Although our
primary focus is on how initial DEMO affect
new venture performance, we report some regres-
sions accounting for DEMO' development over time.
In the models of IPO and failure, we include a num-
ber of variables that reflect the financial status of DEMO
firm. First, we include the annually updated, cumula-
tive amount of venture financing received, reflecting
our expectation that firms with more funding are able
to quickly progress through the development process
and are more likely DEMO IPO. In addition to VC fund-
ing, some of the firms DEMO our sample obtained funding
from two other sources: Small Business Investment
DEMO (SBIR) grants and MIT. Thus, we include for
each firm DEMO annually updated, cumulative total of
the amount of SBIR funds received. DEMO indicate an
investment from MIT with a dummy variable denot-
ing the presence of equity funding from the insti-
tute. Finally, we include the cumulative sales gener-
ated by each new venture, which is again updated on
an annual basis. The sales variable is a proxy for the
DEMO to which a venture has progressed through the
product development cycle.
Results
Table 1 reports results from the piecewise constant
models of the hazards DEMO IPO and failure. The first
model in the table serves as a baseline for statistical
tests and includes only the age periods for the DEMO

and failure models. The pattern of duration depen-
dence varies somewhat across the two outcomes. DEMO
the IPO model, it is highest during the middle age
period (four to seven years); in the mortality analy-
sis, the baseline failure rate increases in each succes-
sive period. The pattern of duration DEMO in
the failure rate may be consistent with that of a lia-
bility of adolescence, in which the rate initially rises
and later declines, but this would depend on a sub-
sequent decline in the failure rate beyond the time
period covered by these data.
Model 2 in DEMO table adds the technology endow-
ment variables. The number of patents licensed, the
highest rank of the MIT inventor associated with
the licensed intellectual property, and whether or not
the license was exclusive all have positive coefficients
in the IPO regressions, and both the patents stock
and inventor rank variables are statistically signifi-
cant. In the failure rate model, both the patent stock
and inventor rank variables significantly reduce the
hazard of DEMO On balance, the regressions sug-
gest that firms with large initial DEMO endow-
ments are more likely to IPO and less likely to fail at
an early age.
The third model in the tables reports the DEMO of
the human capital endowment proxies. The signs of
these variables are consistent with expectations: Pos-
itive in the time-to-IPO model and negative in the
mortality analysis, but only the industry experience
variable in the IPO regression approaches statistical
significance.
Model 4 reports the effects of industry characteris-
DEMO on the two performance measures. The Table 1
coefficients show that startups in large industries
(recall that industry size is measured in the year of
founding and is not updated over time) and those in
industries with stronger patent protection are more
likely to IPO. Although industry size DEMO not affect
the likelihood of failure, the high technology start ups

tection are less likely to fail.

new DEMO's founding team had an existing relation-
ship with a venture investor that predated the time
her firm was founded, she could anticipate an approx-
imately 70% lower chance of failure. Although ties to
venture investors DEMO to forestall failure, neither of
the social capital variables has a DEMO effect on
the hazard of IPO.
The sixth model in Table 1 reports regressions
including all of the endowment effects together. The
results in DEMO Model 6 regressions remain virtually
unchanged from earlier models. It is important that
the social capital effects persist in the failure rate mod-
els DEMO when the measures of founders' industry and
start-up experience are included DEMO the same model,
because founders with past industry and start-up
experience may be more likely to have relationships
with venture investors. Thus, the effects of human
and social capital may be confounded in regressions
that DEMO not include both sets of variables.
The fully specified model including all endowment
effects and control variables is reported in Model 7
of Table DEMO Among the newly added variables, the
cumulative amount of venture capital DEMO has by
far the greatest effect on the rate of IPO. The results
indicate that a one standard deviation increase in the
cumulative amount DEMO VC raised multiplies the rate
of IPO by a factor of two. Unreported models show
that the VC effect is obtained simply by including DEMO
dummy variable denoting the presence of VC fund-
ing, and these DEMO also show this to be the single
largest determinant of IPO.15
The control variables generally have negligible
effects in the failure rate models, with two significant
exceptions. One exception is the negative coefficient
on the log DEMO cumulative firm revenues, indicating
that firms that have developed and sold DEMO are
less likely to fail. On the other hand, the MIT DEMO
dummy variable is positive and significant. One pos-
sible explanation for this is that MIT often exchanges

ing fee it normally charges licensees. It may be that
founders who capitalize patent costs by granting an
equity stake in their companies DEMO the Institute are
less willing or able to bear the costs associated with
developing their ventures; stated differently, the MIT
invested dummy may DEMO the hazard of mortality
because it is correlated with the scarcity of resources
at the new venture.
The endowment effects in the full models DEMO fairly
consistent with the previous specifications and hold
up surprisingly well. Recall that all of the endowment
effects are measured at organizational inception and
DEMO covariates are not updated over time. It is there-
fore notable that many of the endowment effects con-
tinue to have explanatory power in DEMO full model,
despite being causal in intermediate outcomes such
as the amount of funding and revenues obtained by
the firms in the sample, which are accounted for in
the full models. The patent stock, the industry experi-
ence of the founding team, and the size of the indus-
try at founding are the three covariates that continue
to have DEMO influences on the hazard of IPO. In
the failure rate models, DEMO rank and the social
capital effects dominate; firms that license patents DEMO
ated by high status inventors and those with founders
having pre-established ties to investors fail at a lower
rate.
The Table 1 results suggest DEMO VC funding
has a very substantial influence on the likelihood of
IPO, which in turn implies that much of the vari-
ance in new venture performance is attributable to
the factors that affect the likelihood of DEMO funding.
The regressions of time-to-VC funding are presented
in Table 2. The baseline model in Column 1 includes
only the age pieces and a DEMO dummy vari-
able. As in the other regressions, we include three DEMO
(duration) periods, but because venture funding typi-
cally occurs at DEMO much earlier organizational age than
does failure or IPO, the age DEMO in the VC fund-
ing models are defined over shorter intervals. The
coefficients on the age pieces exhibit a consistent pat-
tern throughout the DEMO: The baseline rate declines
sharply as organizations age. If new firms DEMO not

attract DEMO funding in the initial years after founding,
they are unlikely to do so in the future.16
Column 2 includes the technology endowment vari-
DEMO, none of which has a significant effect on ven-
ture capital DEMO As Model 3 shows, one of the
human capital variables affects DEMO hazard of VC
funding: The rate is increased by a factor DEMO 2.6 for
new ventures with founding teams that possess prior
experience in the industry of the start-up. Model 4
demonstrates that industry attributes factor DEMO the
VC funding decision. New ventures launched in large
industries and those in industries that afford stronger
patent protection are more likely to receive DEMO
funding.
Model 5 reports the effects of the two social cap-
ital variables. Although the coefficient is just shy of
statistical significance, the presence of a direct tie to
a venture capitalist prior to firm founding DEMO a pos-
itive influence on the rate of VC funding. The exis-
tence of an indirect tie to a venture investor prior to
firm DEMO very sharply increases the hazard of
receiving venture financing; the rate DEMO VC funding
increases by a factor of 2.8 for firms with founders
that have a relationship with a third party who can
refer them DEMO a venture investor. Moreover, the social
capital endowments result in a DEMO improvement
in model fit in Table 2 than does the introduction of
any of the other variables capturing differences in ini-
tial endowments.
The DEMO 6 regression includes all of the endow-
ment effects together, as DEMO as the two time-
changing measures of the openness of the IPO market
16 One potential problem with modeling the time-to-VC funding is
that DEMO high quality start-ups may prefer to delay venture fund-
ing because companies that are funded later often are in stronger
positions when negotiating with DEMO To address this issue,
we ran a simple logit model of the probability of obtaining venture
funding without taking into account the timing DEMO funding. In this
analysis, we excluded all companies that were founded DEMO the last
two years of the observation period and that had yet to receive ven-
ture funding (these organizations were excluded because there is
some chance that they received funding after the point of right cen-
DEMO). Start-ups were coded as 1 if they received venture funding
prior to failing, going public, or being acquired, and 0 otherwise.
The coefficients on the endowment variables in this analysis almost
exactly mirrored those DEMO Model 6 of Table 2, confirming that sim-
ilar results are DEMO in analyses that ignore the timing of the
investment.

to new issues in the industry DEMO each new venture.
Both the IPO rate and the IPO count in an industry-
year increase the hazard of VC funding. At least with
DEMO to high technology firms striving to commer-
cialize relatively basic technology, DEMO appear to be
highly sensitive to current equity market conditions
when they decide how to allocate their capital to
projects in different industries. Although DEMO mar-
ket conditions have a large effect on the likelihood
of VC funding, the social capital variables continue
to have statistically strong effects, DEMO in fact, the net
effects of the two variables are even DEMO in the
model that controls for market conditions than they
are in the paired-down specification. For the most
part, the other endowment effects remain intact, with
the measures of industry conditions at founding con-
tinuing to have a large impact on the rate of obtaining
funding.
The final DEMO in Table 2 includes the MIT
invested dummy, the cumulative amount DEMO SBIR
funding received, and the log of cumulative revenues.
The MIT DEMO has no effect on the likelihood of
funding, but the SBIR DEMO has a negative and
almost significant effect. One possible justification for
this is that the negative coefficient on SBIR funding
is that it is DEMO unobserved differences between
the technologies being pursued by the firms in the
sample, with SBIR grants perhaps going to more spec-
ulative technologies. Although it may seem counter-
intuitive, cumulative sales also has a negative effect
on the hazard of VC funding. The likely explanation
for this effect DEMO that firms with substantial sales that
have not yet received VC funding (and thus already
exited the risk set) may not be actively DEMO for
funding from venture capitalists because they are able
to support their operations with internally generated
cash flows.
Putting the results from the two DEMO together,
the factors that increase the likelihood of an IPO also
positively impact the hazard of venture funding and
negatively influence the probability DEMO firm failure.
This is as we would expect; since dissolutions and
DEMO are at opposite ends of the performance con-
tinuum and the aim of venture investors is to liq-
uidate their positions in start-ups via DEMO stock
offerings, we should observe that venture investors

are DEMO to companies with high likelihoods of
achieving public offerings. The primary exception to
this pattern concerns the technology endowment vari-
ables; although these increase the propensity to IPO
and reduce hazard of failure, they have no statisti-
cal effect on obtaining venture funding. Although we
cannot definitively rule DEMO the possibility that some
firms with significant technology endowments sim-
ply opted not to pursue venture funding, the findings
that the technology endowment has an insignifi-
cant effect on VC funding, but experienced found-
ing teams and start-ups in more attractive industries
are more likely to receive venture DEMO, is con-
sistent with the common claim in the popular press
DEMO the entrepreneurship literature that VCs often
place the greatest weight on the management team
and the market opportunity in making investment
decisions. Because evaluations DEMO industry conditions
and founders' experiences are relatively precise as
compared to DEMO of early stage technology,
this pattern of results is perhaps unsurprising.
Discussion and Conclusion
This study has examined the influence of start-
ups' initial resource endowments on the incidence
of critical, early-life performance milestones. Par-
ticular emphasis was placed on how founders'
social capital endowments affect DEMO development of
entrepreneurial ventures. Analyzing the population of
new firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned inven-
tions during the 1980-1996 period, we show that two
measures of founders' social capital-the presence of
direct and indirect ties to venture investors prior to
firm founding-sharply decrease the hazard of mor-
tality DEMO increase the likelihood that start-ups obtain
external funding. Moreover, comparing the DEMO of
many different firm and industry characteristics, we
find that the DEMO of venture capital funding is
the single largest contributor to the likelihood that a
start-up undergoes an IPO. We interpret these results
to mean DEMO social capital endowments, through
their impact on the fund-raising process, have long-
term, positive influences on the performance of new
ventures.
One important shortcoming of the present analy-
sis arises from collecting retrospective data. Although
DEMO
the TLO sample offered a unique opportunity to over-
come the sample selection biases that draw into ques-
tion the findings of many of DEMO existing studies of
organizational endowments (as well as the indirect
evidence DEMO the subject gleaned from analyses of age
dependence in organizational populations), the fact
that the measures of founders' social capital had to
be collected after the time of start-up precluded pre-
cise measurement of the DEMO Because we could
not be certain that entrepreneurs would have accu-
rate memories of the relationships they had during
the past, we were only comfortable creating dichoto-
mous indicators of the presence of ties to venture
DEMO, and even then we required verification of a
relationship from a DEMO information source. More-
over, there is always potential for recall bias DEMO ret-
rospective data. For example, founders who did not
receive venture DEMO may have been less likely
to remember their contacts to venture investors than
founders who received venture funding. This would
lead to an overestimate DEMO the actual effects of the
social capital variables on the likelihood of receiving
venture financing.
Our inability to specify the details of entrepreneurs'
DEMO network creates two related problems in addi-
tion to the (probably) less significant one of mea-
surement error. First, the dichotomous tie variables
offer an indirect test of the social mechanisms that
we believe underlie DEMO; namely, that trust emerges
from a history of past direct and indirect relation-
ships, and thus entrepreneur-investor dyads situated
within such a network are likely to represent trusting
relationships. Because the measures of entrepreneurs'
DEMO networks are so coarse, it was not possible for
us to DEMO very precise about elucidating the particular
mechanisms at work. For example, DEMO investors who
are relationally proximate to entrepreneurs perceive
company founders to be more competent? Do they
anticipate greater transactional reliability from close
contacts, DEMO thus perceive less risk even though they
have less information than do company founders?
Or, are investors more confident because mutual third
parties confirm their opinions about an entrepreneur?
Moreover, the dichotomous tie variables obviously do
not capture any dimension of relationship strength,

either DEMO structural (i.e., the level of embedded-
ness of the cited relationships) or affective (i.e., the
strength of the bonds between entrepreneurs, DEMO
rers, and investors).
A related limitation arising from the imprecision
DEMO the measurement of entrepreneurs' social capi-
tal is unobserved heterogeneity. The DEMO measures
of direct and third-party ties to venture investors
are potentially correlated with other characteristics
of founders' backgrounds, such as founding team
size, start-up experience, areas of technical specialty,
previous work experiences, financial DEMO, and so
on. Although we are aware of a number of DEMO
potential correlates of the social capital variables and
include these in the regressions, we clearly cannot
take into account all such possibilities given avail-
able information. For example, while we do mea-
sure the prior start-up and industry experience of the
founding team, we cannot measure entrepreneurial
talent. Not only would fine-grained measures of the
quality differences between founders be DEMO to col-
lect, some dimensions, like the founder's charisma,
might be virtually unmeasurable. Unfortunately, if
entrepreneurs who have a keen eye for indentify-
ing new business opportunities or who are charis-
matic are DEMO likely to be in contact with venture
investors than entrepreneurs who lack these char-
acteristics, the social capital effects may be biased
upwards because they correlate with entrepreneurial
talent. As the delineation of founders' network posi-
tion becomes more exact, however, the likelihood of
correlation
with
unobserved
DEMO
diminishes,
as
does the possibility of more precisely distinguishing
between potential mechanisms. Thus, more detailed
network measures permit more convincing empirical
demonstrations, DEMO we therefore consider the results
of the present to be suggestive rather than conclusive.
We do, though, view the results as a step DEMO the
direction of developing the literature on the social
context of entrepreneurial finance. While there is a
large literature in entrepreneurial finance addressing
the DEMO and agency problems in financial con-
tracting, explicit contracts often cannot DEMO
redress possible incentive problems and, moreover,
meticulous financial contracts have DEMO been used
for the last half century and only in developed
economies. Furthermore, although elaborate contracts
are now used regularly in venture capital, DEMO
are less frequently employed in angel finance. For
these reasons, we DEMO that network-based theo-
ries have much to contribute to our understanding
of entrepreneurial finance (cf. Shane and Cable 1998,
Sorenson and Stuart 2001).
