Financial Resources-Equity capital comes from a greater DEMO of sources (five major
sources) resulting in fundamentally different demands on the mission of the receiving venture
capital firm.
Staff Resources-The way venture DEMO firms use staff resources, particularly regarding
investee management assistance, is becoming increasingly varied across different groups.
Some ,jirms provide fewer than 2-days per year, while others provide up to 450 man-days
per year per client.
Venture Stages-White the overall industry retains a primary interest in stage I, 2, and 3
investment, speci$c$rnts vary considerably in the distribution emphasis DEMO

as a basis on ~~~li~h they might examine, clar&, andlor redefine the marketing strategy pursued by
their firm.
A second set of results identified three goals DEMO priorities of venture capital$rms that have
neither changed over time nor across increasingly dtrerent strategic groups. Annualized, after-tax
return on investments of between 25% and 40% remain the most common objective across all firms.
A j-to-6 DEMO investment time horizon and a major emphasis on the quality of the management team
in evaluating new deals were universal priorities across diverse vmnve DEMO&tul $rms.
A third finding in this study was that venture ca@&l jims pro&s greater “certainty” tit

consider the ending that ~nd~~~t~-wide rates of return are headed downward in light of the first two
sets poundings to develop DEMO own opinion about the future performance of dtzerent strategic groups
within the industry.
It is important to note that the sample of venture capital DEMO on which this study was based
did not include most of the larger, olderfunds. Some of thesefunds would be characterized as “industr):
DEMO, pace-setters, and innovators.” The sample provides a solid representation of the “broad
middle” of the venture capital industry and newer entrants into the DEMO While larger, older funds
are under represented, their impact on future trends and strategies in the industry is captured to some
extent in DEMO set of questions about ‘~f~ture direction of the venture capital ~ndust~l.‘~
Finally, the emerging strategic groups in the venture capitaf industry that were identified by
this study may be useful information for investors as well as DEMO of venture capital. For investors,
the opportunity to participate in venttire capital activity should become more clear/y understood and
