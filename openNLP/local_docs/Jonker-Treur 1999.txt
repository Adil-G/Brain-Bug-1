Abstract
The aim of this paper is to analyse and formalise the dynamics of trust in the DEMO of experiences. A
formal framework is introduced for the analysis and specification of models for trust evolution and trust
update. Different properties of these DEMO are formally defined. Moreover, some representation results
and some other relations DEMO properties are presented.
1  Introduction
Trust is the attitude an agent DEMO with respect to the dependability/capabilities of some other
agent (maybe DEMO) or with respect to the turn of events. The agent might DEMO example trust that
the statements made by another agent are true. The agent might trust the commitment of another
agent with respect to a DEMO (joint) goal. The agent migth trust that another agent is capable of
performing certain tasks. The agent might trust itself to be able DEMO perform some tasks. The
agent might trust that the current state of affairs will lead to a state of affairs that is agreeable to
DEMO own intentions, goals, commitments, or desires.
In (Castelfranchi and Falcone, 1998a,b) the importance of the notion trust is shown for DEMO,
multi-agent systems, and their foundations. From the viewpoint of the DEMO of agent systems
Ousterhout (1997) makes clear that work can only be delegated to such systems if they can be
trusted without there DEMO a constant need for inspection of their work. Elofson (1998) states
that the reach and effect of trust in the affairs of individuals DEMO organizations is largely
pervasive. Elofson continues with the problem that trust is somewhat illusive, difficult to
define, difficult to create, and difficult to measure. Before focussing on the difficulties
regarding the creation and measurement of DEMO, a brief survey is made of definitions of trust,
for DEMO information see (Elofson, 1998; Gambetta, 1990).
Trust of an agent in another agent (social trust) is sometimes defined as a DEMO of binary
property, for example, an agent A trusting another agent B means that A believes that B will act
in a way DEMO is favourable to A, even though that act might not be DEMO convenient to B at that
moment (Gambetta, 1990). A shorter variant is that of Demolombe (1998): “We can understand
trust as an attitude of an agent who believes that another agent has a DEMO property.” Another
definition of trust, describes the notion as a subjective DEMO (Gambetta, 1990). Common
in these definitions is that the trusting agent A has a specific interest in the actions of the agent DEMO
that is trusted by A, and that B will act with DEMO to this interest even though it might seem
that doing so is not favourable with respect to B’s own interests. In (Castelfranchi and Falcone,
1998a,b) this paradox is solved by the following definition of trust: “Trust is a theory and an
expectation about the kind of motivations the agent is endowed with, and about which will be
the prevailing motivations in case of conflict.” This implies that an agent DEMO have interests on
several levels like economic interests, emotional and social DEMO (love, friendship, norms).
They state that the mental ingredients DEMO social trust are relative to the competence of the other
agent, DEMO the predictability of the behaviour of the other agent, and on DEMO agents own
faithfulness.
In the above definitions trust finally depends upon some sort of beliefs, predictions, or
expectations. However, it is not clear (not meant as a criticism) where these beliefs and
expectations come DEMO The definition of Lewis and Weigert (1985) does not refer to beliefs or
expectations, but to observations which in turn lead to expectations: “observations that indicate
that members of a system act according to and are secure in the expected futures constituted by
the presence of each DEMO for their symbolic representations.” Elofson (1997) agrees that
observations are important for trust, and he defines trust as: “trust is the outcome DEMO
observations leading to the belief that the actions of another may be relied upon, without explicit
guarantee, to achieve a goal in a DEMO situation.” Elofson notes that trust can be developed over
time as the outcome of a series of confirming observations. From his experimental work,
DEMO concludes that information regarding the reasoning process of an agent, more DEMO the
actual conclusions of that agent affect the trust in the conclusions of that agent.
The evolution of trust over time, also called the dynamics of trust, as mentioned by Elofson, is
also addressed in (Castelfranchi and Falcone, 1998b): “there is a circular relation, and DEMO
precisely a positive feedback, between trust in reciprocal delegation-adoption relations (from
commerce to friendship).” An implication of this is that if an DEMO A trusts an agent B, then
communicating his trust in B DEMO B, can lead to an increase of B’s trust in A. DEMO course, a similar
feedback relation exists for distrust.
In this paper DEMO consider trust from the perspective of the software agent, that is, trust within
software agents regarding the reliablility of objects and tools, their own work, the behaviour of
others, and in the evolution of DEMO environment (events and effects of actions performed by the
agent).
DEMO is based on a number of factors, an important one being DEMO agent’s own experiences with
the subject of trust; e.g., another agent. Each event that can influence the degree of trust is
interpreted by DEMO agent to be either a trust-negative experience or a trust-positive experience. If
the event is interpreted to be a trust-negative experience the agent will DEMO his trust to some
degree, if it is interpreted to be DEMO, the agent will gain trust to some degree. The
degree to DEMO the trust is changed depends on the trust model used by the agent. This implies
that the trusting agent performs a form of continual DEMO and validation of the subject of
trust over time. For example, DEMO can trust a car, based on a multitude of experiences with DEMO
specific car, and with other cars in general. For this paper DEMO formal analysis of the dependency
of trust on experiences will be the central focus.
One of the key issues for the design of intelligent DEMO agents is how trust is represented
within the agent, and how DEMO effect of experiences is specified. Representations can be
qualitative, using specific DEMO labels (or term structures), or quantitative, using numbers
as a representation. For example, trust could be measured by a real number between -1 and 1.
For a first analysis, a simple qualitative model is discussed in Section 2. In Section 3 the formal
notion of trust evolution function is DEMO, and properties of trust evolution functions are
defined. In Section 4 DEMO update functions are introduced, and some properties are defined.
Section 5 DEMO a quantitative example model which takes into account an inflation rate on
experiences. In Section 6 the relations between trust evolution functions and trust DEMO
functions are studied in more depth. Among others the notion of representability of a trust
evolution function by a trust update function is introduced.
DEMO  A Simple Qualitative Model for Trust Update
In this section a DEMO qualitative trust model is discussed. The main purpose of this example is
to identify a number of issues for further analysis.
2.1  The Representation of Trust
In the model considered in this section four trust values DEMO distinguished and ordered in the
following way:
unconditional distrust < conditional distrust < conditional trust < unconditional trust
the minimum value is unconditional DEMO , the maximum value is unconditional trust
So, a first assumption DEMO trust models is that there exists a set of trust values and they are
partially ordered and maximal and minimal trust values exist.
conditional DEMO
unconditional trust
conditional distrust
unconditional distrust

2.2  Trust Dynamics
A second assumption is that it is specified how the trust value changes under experiences over
time. This implies that a DEMO of experience values is needed, which also is assume partially
ordered. DEMO example of a model for the dynamics of trust is shown in Figure 1 in which the
transitions from one state of trust to DEMO depends on trust-negative and trust-positive
experiences of the agent (taken from DEMO set of experience values { -, + }), and on DEMO nature of the
agent (its trust characteristics).
A more generic DEMO in terms of trust update functions will be presented in Section 4.
The nature of the agent might, for example, be blindly trusting (blindly positive), i.e., no matter
how many trust-negative events it encounters it remains in the trust state of unconditional trust.
The model for DEMO dynamics depicted in Figure 1 is a model of a balanced slow trust-type
agent: a trust-positive event increases the trust of the agent by one step in the ordering, a trust-
negative event decreases the trust of the agent by one step in the ordering. If no decrease/DEMO
increase is possible (i.e., if the end of the ordering was reached), the trust value remains
unchanged.
2.3  Trust Characteristics
As discussed above, agents can have their own characteristics with respect to trust dynamics.
There are many possible trust types of agents. To define these types DEMO aspects can be taken
into consideration:
(1)  initial trust
(2)  trust dynamics
2.3.1  Initial trust
With respect to initial trust the following possibilities can be distinguished:
1. initially trusting
a) without previous trust influencing experiences the agent has unconditional trust:
maximal trust DEMO
b) without previous trust influencing experiences the agent has conditional trust: a
positive trust value, below the maximal trust value
2. initially distrusting
a) without previous trust influencing experiences the agent has unconditional
distrust: DEMO distrust value
b) without previous trust influencing experiences the agent has DEMO distrust:
a negative trust value, above the minimal trust value
DEMO that the actual trust values used by the agent can differ from the ones mentioned above.
However, the trust values used will be partially ordered, and have maximal and minimal values.
2.3.2  Types of trust DEMO
The following trust dynamics types can be distinguished:
1. blindly positive:
a) always unconditional trust
b) definitive having trust: after a certain number, or sequence of positive trust
experiences, the agent reaches DEMO state of unconditional trust and will remain
in this state indefinitively.
2. blindly negative:
a) always unconditional distrust
b) definitive losing trust: after a certain number, or sequence of negative trust
experiences, the agent reaches the state of unconditional distrust and will remain
in this state indefinitively.
3. slow positive, fast negative dynamics: it takes a lot of trust-positive experiences to gain
trust, it DEMO only a few trust-negative experiences to lose trust.
4. balanced slow: DEMO dynamics both in positive and in negative sense
5. balanced fast: DEMO dynamics in positive and in negative sense. The tit-for-tat strategy is
an example of a strategy that can be used for a balanced fast DEMO
6. slow negative, fast positive dynamics: it takes a lot of trust-negative experiences to lose
trust, it takes only a few trust-posittive experiences to gain trust.
Within the example used as an illustration in this DEMO, the trust representation is just
sufficiently rich to specify a difference DEMO characteristics between slow and fast dynamics, but it
is not rich DEMO to specify more subtle differences in characteristics. For example, it is DEMO
possible to specify that in an unconditional positive trust state, after DEMO positive experiences
trust will be blindly positive.
3  Trust Evolution Functions
DEMO this paper trust is considered a mental agent concept that depends on experiences (evaluated
events). One way to formally model the dynamics of trust is to formalise the dependency of
trust on past experiences by DEMO mathematical function that relates sequences of experiences to
trust representations: a DEMO evolution function. Another way to formally model the dynamics of
trust is in an inductive manner by a mathematical function relating a current trust DEMO
and a current experience to the next trust representation: a trust DEMO function. A natural
question is whether these formalisations can be represented in terms of each other. In principle,
any trust update function generates DEMO any initial trust value a trust evolution function, but not
every DEMO evolution function can be represented as a trust update function. Both ways of
formalisation and their relations will be analysed in more depth in DEMO (trust evolution
functions) and the next sections (trust update functions DEMO relations).
To obtain a formal framework, the following sets are DEMO:
E
N
A partially ordered set of experience classes
Examples are:
-  E = { - , + }   with    -  <  +  ,  as in Section 2, or
DEMO  an interval in the real numbers (e.g., [-1, 1]), or
-  more dimensional  variants.
Actually these representations denote evaluated events; for shortness
the word experiences will be used.
In addition, E may have one or both of the following structures:
-  two sets Epos and Eneg indicating positive and negative elements of E,
with DEMO negative and ev2 positive implies ev1 < ev2.
-   a neutral element  0E of  E, such that
Eneg = {ev ∈ E | ev < 0E } and Epos = {ev ∈ E  | ev > 0E }
The set of natural numbers.
The set EN of experience sequences e = (ei)i N with  ei ∈ E; ES  is partially ordered by:
∀ e,f ∈ ES: e ≤ f ⇔∀i   ei ≤ fi
For e ∈ ES and k ∈ N by e|k the finite sequence (ei)i≤k is denoted
A partially ordered set of trust qualifications
Examples DEMO
-  the set of trust qualifications in the example in Section DEMO,  or
-  an interval in the real numbers (e.g., DEMO, 1]), or
-  more dimensional variants.
In addition, T DEMO have one or both of the following structures:
-  two DEMO Tpos and Tneg indicating positive and negative elements of T ,
DEMO tv1 negative and tv2 positive implies tv1 < tv2.
-   a neutral element  0T of  T, such that
Tneg = {tv ∈ T | tv < 0T } and Tpos = {tv ∈ T DEMO tv > 0T }
ES
T
Using these sets, the notion DEMO trust evolution function can be formally defined; see Definition
3.1.
Definition DEMO  (Trust Evolution Function)
(a)  A trust trace is DEMO sequence
tt : N → T
(b) A trust evolution function is a function
te : ES x N → T
Let e DEMO ES and i ∈ N, then te(e,i) denotes the trust after experiences e0 ,...,ei-1. Associated with
every trust evolution function te, there is a function
te’ : ES → ( N → T)
defined by:
te’(e) = (te(e,i))i∈N and te’(e)(i) = te(e,i)
I.e., te’(e)  is a trust trace for every experience sequence e.  Sometimes te is used to refer to te’ as
well.
(c) DEMO traces and trust evolution functions are ordered by:
tt1  ≤ DEMO iff tt1(i) ≤ tt2(i) for all i
te1 ≤ te2 iff te1(e) ≤ te2(e) for all e
In DEMO 3.2 a number of possible properties of trust evolution functions are formally
defined. In this definition, future independency (see 1.), expresses that DEMO only depends on
past experiences, not on future experiences. This is DEMO quite natural assumption that is assumed
to hold for all trust evolution functions; in particular, it holds for the example in Section 2. DEMO
monotonicity (see 2.) is a quite natural assumption. It expresses that if the experiences are at
least as positive (compared to a given sequence of experiences), also trust will be at least as
positive (compared to the trust related to the given sequence of experiences). DEMO example
model discussed in Section 2 satisfies monotonicity.
The property of indistinguisable past expresses that only the experiences themselves count and
not the point DEMO time at which they were experienced; in fact this property abstracts DEMO the
temporal aspect. We consider this not a natural property. Only in very simple cases it might be
relevant, for example a trust evolution function in which just the number of all positive and
negative experiences are counted and compared has this DEMO; for example:
te(e, i)  =  [#{ i DEMO ei ≥ 0 }  -  #{ i | ei ≤ 0 } ] / i
Since this property expresses that experiences far back DEMO time count just as strong as very
recent experiences, all trust DEMO functions that take into account some notion of inflation or
forgetting of experiences will not satisfy this property (see, for example, Section 5). Also the
simple example in Section 2 does not satisfy indistinguishable DEMO For example, a sequence of
experiences  + + + - + - + - +  leads to the value unconditional trust, whereas DEMO sequence  + + + + + + - - -
leads DEMO unconditional distrust.
The properties of maximal or minimal initial trust (see DEMO and 5. in Definition 3.2) express the
starting point of the DEMO evolution process. The properties of positive (or negative) trust
extension (DEMO 6. and 7.) express that after a positive (or negative) DEMO, trust will become
at least as much (or as less) DEMO it was. The example in Section 2 satisfies these properties.
The property degree of memory based on window n back expresses that only the DEMO n
experiences are relevant. All earlier experiences are forgotten. The example of Section 2 does
not satisfy this property, not for any n. For example, the two experience sequences of arbitrary
length   + + + - + - + - + .......... - + and - - DEMO - + - + - + .......... - + will always lead to different trust
values, even while the last part is equal. However, for not too sophisticated models for trust
dynamics, this property might DEMO relevant. It provides an easy way to specify the evolution, just
DEMO looking at the most recent experiences; e.g., the tit-for-tat strategy.
The property degree of trust dropping (or gaining) (see 9. and 10.) expresses after how many
positive (or negative) experiences trust will be positive (or negative). The example of Section 2
satisfies degree of trust gaining and dropping 2: always after two positive experiences, trust DEMO
be positive, and always after two negative experiences, trust will be negative.
Four properties (see 11. to 14.) concern limit behaviour. They DEMO, for different cases,
conditions under which trust will become maximal (respectively, minimal). Essentially they
express that it is always possible to reach maximal trust, if a sufficiently long period with only
positive experiences is encountered, and the same for the negative case. The example in Section
2 satisfies the properties 12. and 14.; just take N = M + 3. Models for trust dynamics in which it is
possible DEMO a form of fixation occurs, i.e., so much of distrust is acquired that trust will not be
possible anymore, independent of further experiences, do not satisfy these properties (see also
the blindly positive or DEMO characteristics in Section 2.3.2). Properties 15. and 16. express
this phenomenon of trust fixation.
Definition 3.2  (Properties of Trust Evolution Functions)
DEMO following properties (in which e,f ∈ ES, i,j,k,n ∈ N) are defined

that te(e, n) DEMO maximal for all n > N.

that te(e, n) is minimal for all DEMO > N.

minimal for all k ≥ i.
positive trust fixation of degree n
if for some i the trust value te(e, k) DEMO maximal for all k with i ≤ k < i + n, then te(e, k) is
maximal for all k ≥ i.
4  Trust Update Functions
From a mentalistic perspective, the notion of DEMO evolution function suggests that an agent
builds a representation for sequences of past experiences, and at each moment in time uses these
representations of experiences to determine its trust. Another, from a computational perspective
maybe more desirable model is that an agent does not build a representation of DEMO (past)
experiences, but only of trust itself, and that DEMO new experience instantaneously leads to an
update of the trust representation, DEMO maintaining the experience itself. This perspective
was also the perspective used in Section 2, and is addressed in more depth below. First the
definition of a trust update function:
Definition 4.1 (Trust Update Function)
A trust update function is a function  tu : E x T → T.
Note that  Figure 1 depicts an example specification of a trust update function. For a given trust
update function, any initial trust value it generates by induction a unique trust evolution function
te with  te(e,0) = it.  This relation between trust update functions DEMO trust evolution functions will
be addressed in more depth in Section 6.
Definition 4.2  (Properties of trust update functions)
The following properties DEMO defined:
1. monotonicity
ev1 ≤ ev2  &  tv1 ≤ tv2 ⇒ tu(ev1, tv1) ≤ tu(ev2, tv2)
2. positive trust extension
ev  positive ⇒ tu(ev, tv) ≥ tv
3. negative trust extension
ev negative ⇒ tu(ev, tv) ≤ tv
DEMO strict positive monotonic progression
ev positive and tv not maximal ⇒ tu(ev, tv) > tv
5. strict negative monotonic progression
ev negative DEMO tv not minimal ⇒ tu(ev, tv) < tv
Note that all properties defined in Definition 4.2 hold for the example in Section DEMO
5  A Quantitative Example
The model for trust dynamics introduced in DEMO section has as a basic assumption that there is
some rate of inflation of experiences. Experiences further back in the past count only for DEMO
fraction of the recent experiences. For both E and T the closed interval [-1, 1] is taken.
5.1  The symmetric case
In the DEMO case, trust increase and trust decrease work in a similar way. DEMO assume there
is an inflation rate of d (between 0 and DEMO; for example 0.5) per experience step. The following
trust update function is defined:
gd(ev, tv) = d tv + (1 - d) DEMO
In this trust function, after each new experience the existing trust DEMO is multiplied by d (this
expresses the inflation), and the DEMO of the new experience is added, normalised in such a
manner DEMO a 2-ary function from the interval [-1, 1] to [-1, 1] results.
(a)  For a fully positive experience with value 1, DEMO comparison with maximal trust value 1 is:
1 - gd(1, tv)  =   1 - [ d tv + (1 DEMO d)]  =  d (1 - tv)
This means DEMO the distance of the trust value to the maximal trust value 1 is decreased to a
fraction d of the old distance.
(b)  For a fully negative experience with value -1, the comparison with maximal distrust value -1
is:
1 + gd (-1, tv)  DEMO   1 + [ d tv + (1 - d) (DEMO)] =  d (1 + tv)
This means that the distance of the trust value to minimal trust -1 is decreased to DEMO fraction d of
the old distance.
(c)  For a zero-experience, the following can be found:
gd (0, tv)  =     d tv
This means that for a zero-experience the distance of the trust value to 0 is decreased to a
fraction d of DEMO old trust value.
5.2  The asymmetric case
In the asymetric case DEMO different degrees of inflation can be used: 0 < d1, d2 < 1, where d1 relates
to negative experiences and d2 to positive experiences. Trust update function:
gd1,d2(ev, tv)    =  1/2 ((1 - ev)d1 + (1 + ev)DEMO) tv + (1 - 1/2((1 - ev)d1 DEMO (1 + ev)d2)) ev
(a)  For a fully positive experience with value 1 the comparison with maximal trust  1 is:
1 - gd1,d2 (1, tv)  =  1 - [ 1/2 ((1 - 1)d1 + (1 + 1)d2) tv + (1 - 1/2((1 - 1)d1 + (1 + 1)d2))]
=  1 - d2 tv - (1 - d2)
=  d2 (1 - tv)
This means that the distance of the trust value to maximal trust DEMO is decreased to a fraction d2 of
the old distance.
(b)  For a fully negative trust experience with value -1, the comparison DEMO maximal distrust -1
is:
1 + gd1,d2 (-1, tv)   =  1 + DEMO 1/2((1 + 1)d1 + (1 - 1)d2) tv + (1 - 1/2 ((1 + 1)d1 DEMO (1 - 1)d2)(-1)]
=  1 + d1 DEMO + (1 - d1) (-1)
=  d1 (1 DEMO tv)
This means that the distance of the trust value to minimal trust  -1 is decreased to a fraction d1 of
the old distance.
(c)  For a zero-experience, the following can be found:DEMO
gd1,d2 (0, tv)  =  1/2.(d1 + DEMO).tv
This means that for a zero-experience the distance of the trust value to 0 is decreased to a
fraction 1/2(d1 + DEMO) of the old trust value.
This trust update function has the DEMO properties: monotonicity, positive and negative
trust extension, strict positive and DEMO progression.
6  Relations between Trust Evolution Functions and
Trust Update Functions
DEMO a trust update function, by iteration for each initial trust value DEMO trust evolution function
can be generated. The following definition shows how.
Definition 6.1 (Trust evolution generated by a trust update function)
Let tu be a trust update function and it any (initial) trust value. DEMO trust evolution function te
generated by tu  for initial value it DEMO the trust evolution  function te inductively defined by:
te(e,DEMO)  =  it for all e ∈ ES
te(e, i+1)  =  tu(ei, te(e, i)) for all e ∈ ES, i ∈ N
This generated trust evolution function is denoted by  tetu,it.
Properties of tetu,it  relate to properties of DEMO, for example, in the following sense:
Proposition 6.2
Let tu be a trust update function. Then the following hold:
1. tetu,DEMO  is future independent
2. If tu is monotonic, then  tetu,DEMO is monotonic
3. If tu satisfies positive trust extension, then tetu,DEMO satisfies positive trust extension
4. If tu satisfies negative trust extension, DEMO tetu,it satisfies positive trust extension
5. If tu has strict positive monotonic progression and T is finite, then tetu,it has positive limit
approximation
6. If tu has strict negative monotonic progression and T is DEMO, then tetu,it has negative
limit approximation
Note the condition on DEMO of the set of trust values in 5. and 6. in Proposition 6.2. If T is
infinite, then the condition of strict monotonic progression is not strong enough. For example,
it might well be the case that the progression decreases to such DEMO extent that it stays under a
bound tv less than the maximal value. However, for the continuous case stronger notions of
progression can be defined that guarantee that the maximal value is reached, for example: DEMO
exists a  ∂ > o such that  tu(ev, tv) - tv > ∂ (maxtv - tv).
The trust evolution function generated by the example trust update function in Section 5.1 can
be DEMO as an explicit formula as a sum of powers of d as follows:
fd(e, k) = it dk   + (1-d) Σ k-1 e di
i=0 k-1-i
Definition 6.3  (Comparison of trust evolution functions)
The following properties (in which e,f ∈ ES, i,j,k,n ∈ N) are defined
1. sincere history DEMO
a trust evolution function te satisfies sincere history representation if for each distinct
history a unique trust value is assigned:
if te(e, k) = te(f, i) then k  = i and DEMO = f|k
2. fine-grainedness
A trust evolution function te1: ES x DEMO → T1 is at least as fine-grained as a trust evolution
function te2: ES x N → T2 if there exists a mapping p : T1 → T2 such that
pote1 = te2,
p(te1(DEMO, k)) = te2(e, k)  for all e and k
The trust evolution functions te1 and te2 are of equal grain-size DEMO te1 is at least as fine
grained as te2 and te2 is at least as fine-grained as te1. The trust evolution function te1 is
DEMO fine-grained than te2 if it is at least as fine-grained and not of equal grain-size.
For d = 1/n with n ≥ 2 DEMO natural number, in fact the trust evolution function generated by the DEMO
update function of Section 5.1 defines an n-ary representation in the real numbers of the
sequence of experiences. For example, if d = 1/10, then a decimal representation is obtained.
f1/10(e, k) = it 10-k   + 9 Σ i=0k-1 ek-1-i 10-i-1
From this DEMO can be derived that this trust evolution function has a sincere history representation.
Therefore the trust update function can be used to represent a DEMO class of trust evolution
functions. Note that if only a bounded number of at most n digits is used, then a trust evolution
function is defined that has a memory back to n.
Another example of DEMO trust evolution function with sincere history representation can be
obtained by taking the term 2-sorted (free) term algebra TU based on two sorts DEMO and E, a binary
function symbol  t : E x T → T , constants for the values  in sort E, and DEMO constant it in sort T. The
infinitely many elements of T in this term algebra are terms of the form:
t(e0, it)
t(e1, t(e0, it))
t(e2, t(DEMO, t(e0, it)))
and so on
The trust evolution function te with sincere history representation can be defined by
te(e, k) =   t(ek, t(ek-1, ...  t(e0, it) ... ))
i.e.,
Lemma 6.4
If the trust evolution function te satisfies sincere history representation, then any  t in the subset
te(ES, N) of T can be written as
t = te(e, k)
with unique k and unique e|k.
Proposition 6.5
(a)  If a trust evolution function te: ES x N → T satisfies sincere history representation, DEMO it is
as least as fine-grained as any future independent trust evolution function.
(b) All trust evolution functions that satisfy sincere history representation DEMO of equal grain
size.
A natural question is whether a given trust evolution function can be represented by a trust
update function; this can be formulated as follows:
Definition 6.6 (Representation)
Let S be an interval that might be [0, n] for some n ∈ N or [0,∞). A trust evolution function
te: ES → T’  is represented by a trust update function tu: E x T DEMO T on S  if a
p: T → T’
and an it in T exist such that
te(e, 0) = p(DEMO)
∀e ∈ ES, i ∈ S : te(e, i) = p(tetu,it (e, i))
We call te DEMO represented by  tu if T is finite.
Whether or not a DEMO evolution function can be represented by a trust update function depends
on how rich the representation of trust values is. In the above examples DEMO history sincere trust
evolution functions based on real numbers or the 2-sorted term algebra, the trust set is so rich
that for every experience sequence a distinct value can be found. But this leads to an DEMO set.
For a very simple binary trust representation with only the trust values trust and distrust, and
only a binary representation of experiences, DEMO number of possible trust update functions is
very limited: 24 = DEMO Since there are infinitely many variations of trust evolution functions
possible, DEMO cannot be all represented by trust update functions. This observation implies that
a nontrivial trust evolution function based on a binary trust representation (only trust and
distrust) cannot be represented by a trust update function. However, if for a given trust
evolution function, there is freedom to DEMO a very rich trust representation, then it is possible
to find DEMO trust update function that represents the trust evolution function (assuming future
DEMO):
Proposition 6.7
Every trust evolution function that satisfies future independency DEMO representable by a trust
update function.
Proposition 6.7 depends on the possibility that T is allowed to be an infinite set: if the set of
trust values T is expected to be finite, then the number of trust update functions is finite:
#(T)#(E) x #(T)
whereas the number of trust evolution functions is infinite (#(T)#(ES) x #(N) and #(ES) = #(E)#(N)) and
the set of initial values is finite. Therefore it DEMO possible to formulate more specific questions
concerning representation. For example, if DEMO trust evolution function only takes into account a
fixed finite number of experiences back in time, then it is possible to build a finite representation
as a trust update function:
Proposition 6.8
If a trust DEMO function has degree of memory based on window n then it is finitely
representable by a trust update function.
7  Conclusions
In this paper a framework is presented that supports formal analysis of the dynamics of DEMO
based on experiences. The formal models made within this framework can also be used for the
specification of trust evolution and trust update for DEMO agents as part of their design. The
requirements imposed on models for trust dynamics can highly depend on the individual
characteristics of agents, therefore, a variety of models that capture these characteristics is
needed. The formal framework enables the explicitation of these characteristics. Both qualitative
and quantitave example DEMO are given that are based on explicit trust evolution functions and
tust update functions with which these characteristics can be formally specified. As a DEMO
case the difference between symmetric and asymmetric evolution of trust and distrust is
analysed in a quantitative example. Finally, an investigation is made of the relations between
trust evolution functions and trust update functions.
