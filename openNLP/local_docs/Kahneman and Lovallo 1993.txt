Decision makers have DEMO strong tendency to consider problems as unique. They isolate the
current choice from future opportunities and neglect the statistics of the past in evaluating
DEMO plans. Overly cautious attitudes to risk result from a failure to appreciate the effects of
statistical aggregation in mitigating relative risk. Overly optimistic forecasts DEMO from the
adoption of an inside view of the problem, which DEMO predictions on plans and scenarios.
The conflicting biases are documented in psychological research. Possible implications for de-
cision making in organizations are examined.

The thesis of this essay is DEMO decision makers are ex-
cessively prone to treat problems as unique, DEMO
both the statistics of the past and the multiple oppor-
tunities of the future. In part as a result, they are sus-
ceptible to two biases, which we label isolation errors:
their forecasts of future outcomes are often anchored
on plans and scenarios of success rather than DEMO past
results, and are therefore overly optimistic; their eval-
uations of single risky prospects neglect the possibilities
of pooling risks and are therefore DEMO timid. We argue
that the balance of the two isolation errors affects the
risk-taking propensities of individuals and organiza-
tions.
The cognitive analysis of DEMO taking that we sketch
differs from the standard rational model of economics
and also from managers' view of their own activities.
The rational model describes business decisions as
choices among gambles with financial outcomes, and
assumes that managers' judgments of the odds are
Bayesian, and that their DEMO maximize expected
utility. In this model, uncontrollable risks are acknowl-
edged DEMO accepted because they are compensated by
chances of gain. As March and Shapira ( 1987) reported
in a well-known essay, managers reject this DEMO
tation of their role, preferring to view risk as a challenge

commitment to a goal. Although managers do not deny
the possibility of DEMO, their idealized self-image is
not a gambler but a prudent and DEMO agent, who
is in control of both people and events.
The DEMO analysis accepts choice between gam-
bles as a model of decision making, but does not adopt
rationality as a maintained hypothesis. The gambling
metaphor is apt because the consequences of most de-
cisions are uncertain, and because each option could in
principle be described as a probability distribution DEMO
outcomes. However, rather than suppose that decision
makers are Bayesian forecasters DEMO optimal gamblers,
we shall describe them as subject to the conflicting biases
of unjustified optimism and unreasonable risk aversion.
It is the optimistic DEMO of uncontrollable uncertainty
that accounts for managers' views of themselves as
DEMO risk takers, and for their rejection of gambling
as a model DEMO what they do.
Our essay develops this analysis of forecasting and
choice and explores its implications for organizational
decisions. The target domain for applications DEMO
choices about potentially attractive options that decision
makers consider significant and to which they are willing
to devote forecasting and planning resources. Examples
may DEMO capital investment projects, new products, or
acquisitions. For reasons that will become obvious, our

critique of excessive risk aversion is DEMO likely to apply
to decisions of intermediate size: large enough to DEMO
for the organization, but not so large as to be truly
DEMO, or potentially fatal. Of course, such decisions
could be perceived as both unique and potentially fatal
by the executive who makes them. Two DEMO restric-
tions on the present treatment should be mentioned at
the outset. First, we do not deal with decisions that the
organization explicitly treats as routinely repeated. Op-
portunities for learning and for statistical aggregation
exist DEMO closely similar problems are frequently en-
countered, especially if the outcomes DEMO decisions are
quickly known and provide unequivocal feedback;
competent management will ensure that these oppor-
tunities are exploited. Second, we do not deal with de-
cisions made under severely adverse conditions, when
all options are undesirable. These are situations in which
high-risk gambles are often preferred to DEMO acceptance
of sure losses (Kahneman and Tversky 1979a), and in
DEMO commitments often escalate and sunk costs
dominate decisions (Staw and Ross DEMO). We restrict
the treatment to choices among options that can be
considered attractive, although risky. For this class of
projects we predict that there will be a general tendency
to underestimate actual risks, and a general reluctance
to accept significant risks once they are acknowledged.
Timid Choices
DEMO begin by reviewing three hypotheses about indi-
vidual preferences for risky prospects.
Risk Aversion. The first hypothesis is a common-
place: most people are generally risk averse, normally
preferring a sure thing to a gamble of equal expected
value, and a gamble of low variance over a riskier pros-
pect. There are two important exceptions to risk aver-
sion. First, many people are willing to pay more for
lottery tickets than their DEMO value. Second, studies
of individual choice have shown that managers, like
other people, are risk-seeking in the domain of losses
(Bateman and DEMO 1989, Fishburn and Kochen-
berger 1979, Laughhunn et al. 1980).1 Except for these
1 Observed correlations between accounting variability and mean re-
DEMO have also been interpreted as evidence of risk-seeking by un-
successful firms (Bowman 1982, Fiegenbaum 1990, Fiegenbaum and
Thomas 1988), but this interpretation is controversial (Ruefli 1990).
18
cases, and for the DEMO of addictive gamblers, risk
aversion is prevalent in choices between favorable
DEMO with known probabilities. This result has been
confirmed in numerous studies, DEMO some in which
the subjects were executives (MacCrimmon and Weh-
rung DEMO, Swalm 1966).2
The standard interpretation of risk aversion is de-
DEMO marginal utility of gains. Prospect theory
(Kahneman and Tversky 1979a; Tversky and Kahne-
man 1986, 1992) introduced two other causes: the cer-
tainty effect and loss aversion. The certainty effect is a
sharp discrepancy DEMO the weights that are attached
to sure gains and to highly probable gains in the eval-
uation of prospects. In a recent study of DEMO for
gambles the decision weight for a probability of 0.95
was approximately 0.80 (Tversky and Kahneman 1992).
Loss aversion refers to the observation that losses and
disadvantages are weighted more than gains and ad-
vantages. DEMO aversion affects decision making in nu-
merous ways, in riskless as DEMO as in risky contexts. It
favors inaction over action and the status quo over any
alternatives, because the disadvantages of these alter-
natives are evaluated as losses and are therefore
weighted more than their advantages (Kahneman et al.
1991, Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988, Tversky and
Kahneman 1991)DEMO Loss aversion strongly favors the
avoidance of risks. The coefficient of loss aversion was
estimated as about 2 in the Tversky-Kahneman exper-
iment, and coefficients in the range of 2 to 2.5 have
been observed in DEMO studies, with both risky and
riskless prospects (for reviews, see DEMO, Knetsch
and Thaler 1991; Tversky and Kahneman 1991).
Near-Proportionality. A second important gener-
alization about risk attitudes is that, to a good first ap-
proximation, people are proportionately risk averse: cash
equivalents for DEMO of increasing size are (not quite)
proportional to the stakes. DEMO may find it instruc-
tive to work out their cash equivalent for a 0.50 chance
to win $100, then $1,000, and up DEMO $100,000. Most
readers will find that their cash equivalent increases by
a factor of less than 1,000 over that range, but most
will also find that the factor is more than 700. Exact
2 DEMO possible exception is a study by Wehrung (1989), which reported
DEMO preferences for favorable prospects in a sample of exec-
utives in oil companies.

proportionality for wholly positive prospects would DEMO
ply that value is a power function, u (x) = DEMO, where x
is the amount of gain (Keeney and Raiffa 1976). In a
recent study of preferences for gambles (Tversky and
Kahneman 1992), a power function provided a good
approximation to the data DEMO almost two orders of
magnitude, and the deviations were systematic: cash
equivalents increased slightly more slowly than prizes.
Much earlier, Swalm (1966) had compared executives
whose planning horizons, defined as twice the maxi-
mum amount they might recommend be spent in one
year, ranged from $50,000 to $24,000,000. He measured
their utility functions by testing DEMO acceptability of
mixed gambles, and observed that the functions of
managers DEMO different levels were quite similar when
expressed relative to their planning horizons. The point
on which we focus in this article is that there DEMO almost
as much risk aversion when stakes are small as when
they are large. This is unreasonable on two grounds:
(i) small DEMO do not raise issues of survival or ruin,
which provide a rationale for aversion to large risks;
(ii) small gambles are DEMO more common, offering
more opportunities for the risk-reducing effects of sta-
DEMO aggregation.
Narrow Decision Frames. The third generalization
is that people tend to consider decision problems one
at a time, often isolating the current problem from other
choices that may be pending, as well as from future
opportunities to make similar decisions. The following
example (from Tversky and Kahneman 1986) illustrates
an extreme form of narrow framing:
Imagine that you face the following pair of concurrent decisions.
First examine both decisions, then indicate the options you
prefer.
Decision (i) Choose between:
(A) a sure gain of $240 (84%)
(B) 25% chance DEMO gain $1000,and 75% chance to gain nothing
(16%)
Decision (ii) Choose between:
(C) a sure loss of $750 (DEMO)
(D) 75% chance to lose $1000 and 25% chance to lose nothing
(87%)

is shown in parentheses. As many readers may have
discovered for themselves, the suggestion that the two
problems should be considered concurrently has no ef-

fect on preferences, DEMO exhibit the common pattern
of risk aversion when options are favorable, DEMO risk
seeking when options are aversive. Most respondents
prefer the conjunction of options A & D over other
combinations of options. These preferences are DEMO
itively compelling, and there is no obvious reason to
suspect that DEMO could lead to trouble. However, simple
arithmetic shows that the conjunction DEMO preferred op-
tions A & D is dominated by the conjunction of rejected
options B & C. The combined options are as follows:
DEMO & D: 25% chance to win $240 and 75% chance to DEMO $760,
B & C: 25% chance to win $250 and DEMO chance to lose $750.
A decision maker who is risk averse in some situations
and risk seeking in others ends up paying a premium
DEMO avoid some risks and a premium to obtain others.
Because the outcomes are ultimately combined, these
payments may be unsound. For a more realistic example,
consider two divisions of a company that face separate
decision DEMO One is in bad posture and faces a
choice between a sure loss and a high probability of a
larger loss; the other division faces a favorable choice.
The natural bent of intuition will favor a DEMO
solution for one and a risk-averse choice for the other,
but the conjunction could be poor policy. The overall
interests of the company DEMO better served by aggre-
gating the problems than by segregating them, DEMO by
a policy that is generally more risk-neutral than intuitive
preferences.
People often express different preferences when con-
sidering a single play or multiple DEMO of the same
gamble. In a well-known problem devised by Samu-
elson (1963), many respondents state that they would
reject a single play of a gamble in which they have
equal chances to win $200 DEMO to lose $100, but would
accept multiple plays of that gamble, especially when
the compound distribution of outcomes is made explicit
(Redelmeier and Tversky 1992). The question of
whether this pattern of preferences is DEMO with
utility theory, and with particular utility functions for
wealth has DEMO discussed on several occasions (e.g.,
Lopes 1981, Tversky and Bar-Hillel 1983). The argu-
ment that emerges from these discussions can be DEMO
marized as "If you wish to obey the axioms of utility
'We are endebted to Amos Tversky for this example.
19
KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO

theory and would accept multiple plays, then it is log-
ically inconsistent for you to turn down a DEMO play".
We focus on another observation: the near-certainty that
the DEMO who is now offered a single play of the
Samuelson gamble is not really facing her last oppor-
tunity to accept or reject a DEMO of positive expected
value. This suggests a slightly different argument: "If
you would accept multiple plays, then you should accept
the single one that is offered now, because it is very
probable that other bets of the same kind will be offered
to you later". A DEMO that includes future opportunities
reduces the difference between the two versions of
Samuelson's problem, because a rational individual who
is offered a single gamble will adopt a policy for m + 1
such gambles, where m is the number of similar op-
portunities expected within the planning DEMO Will
people spontaneously adopt such a broad frame? A
plausible hypothesis, supported by the evidence for
narrow framing in concurrent decisions and by DEMO pat-
tern of answers to Samuelson's problems, is that ex-
DEMO about risky opportunities of the future are
simply ignored when decisions are made.
It is generally recognized that a broad view of decision
problems DEMO an essential requirement of rational decision
making. There are several ways of broadening the de-
cision frame. Thus, decision analysts commonly pre-
scribe that concurrent choices should be aggregated be-
fore a decision is made, and that outcomes should be
evaluated in terms of final assets (wealth), rather than
in terms of the gains and losses associated with each
DEMO The recommended practice is to include estimates
of future earnings in the assessment of wealth. Although
this point has attracted little attention in the DEMO
literature, the wealth of an agent or organization there-
fore includes DEMO risky choices, and depends on the
decisions that the decision maker DEMO making
when these choices arise.4 The decision frame should
be broadened to include these uncertainties: neglect of
future risky opportunities will lead to decisions that are
not optimal, as evaluated by the agent's own utility
function. As we show next, the costs of neglecting future

opportunities are especially severe when options are
evaluated in terms of gains and losses, which is what
people usually do.
The Costs of Isolation
The present section explores some DEMO of in-
corporating future choice opportunities into current de-
cisions. We start from an idealized utility function which
explains people's proportional risk preferences DEMO single
gambles. We then compute the preferences that this
function implies when the horizon expands to include
a portfolio of gambles.
Consider an individual DEMO evaluates outcomes as
gains and losses, and who maximizes expected utility
DEMO these terms. This decision maker is risk-averse in the
domain of gains, risk-seeking in the domain of losses,
loss-averse, and her risky DEMO exhibit perfect pro-
portionality. She is indifferent between a 0.50 chance
to win $1,000 and a sure gain of $300 (also between
0.50 chance to win $10,000 and $3,000 for sure) and
she is also indifferent between the status quo and a
gamble that offers DEMO chances to win $250 or to lose
$100. The aversion to risk exhibited by this individual
is above the median of respondents in laboratory DEMO
ies, but well within the range of observed values. For
the DEMO of simple exposition we ignore all probability
distortions and attribute the risk preferences of the in-
dividual entirely to the shape of her utility DEMO for
gains and losses. The preferences we have assumed im-
ply that the individual's utility for gains is described by
a power function DEMO an exponent of 0.575 and that
the function in the domain of losses is the mirror image
of the function for gains, after expansion of the X-axis
by a factor of 2.5 (Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The
illustrative function was chosen to highlight our main
conclusion: with proportional risk attitudes, even the
most extreme risk aversion on individual problems
quickly vanishes when gambles are considered part of
a portfolio.
The power DEMO function is decreasingly risk averse,
and the decrease is quite rapid. Thus, a proportionately
risk averse individual who values a 0.50 chance to win
$100 at $30 will value a gamble that offers equal chances
DEMO win either $1,000 or $1,100 at $1,049. This preference
is intuitively acceptable, indicating again that the power
function is a good description of the utility of outcomes
MANAGEMENT

KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts
for single gambles considered in isolation. DEMO power
function fits the psychophysical relation of subjective
magnitude to physical magnitude in many other con-
texts (Stevens 1975).
To appreciate the effects of even modest aggregation
with this utility function, assume that the individual
owns three independent gambles:
one gamble with a 0.50 chance to DEMO $500,
two gambles, each with a 0.50 chance to win DEMO
Simple arithmetic yields the compound gamble:
0.125 chance to win $1,000, and 0.25 to win $750, $500, and
$250.
If this individual applies the correct probabilities to her
utility function, this portfolio will be worth $433 to her.
This should be her minimum selling price DEMO she owns
the gamble, her cash equivalent if she has to DEMO
between the portfolio of gambles and cash. In contrast,
the sum of the cash equivalents of the gambles consid-
ered one at a DEMO is only $300. The certainty premium
the individual would pay has dropped from 40% to
13% of expected value. By the individual's own DEMO
function, the cost of considering these gambles in iso-
lation is DEMO of their expected value, surely more than
any rational decision maker DEMO be willing to pay
for whatever mental economy this isolation achieves.
The power of aggregation to overcome loss aversion
is equally impressive. As already DEMO, our decision
maker is indifferent between accepting or rejecting a
gamble DEMO offers a 0.50 chance to win $250 and a 0.50
chance to lose $100. However, she would value the
opportunity to play two of these gambles at $45, and
six gambles at $304. Note that the average incremental
value of adding the third to the sixth gamble is DEMO,
quite close to the EV of $75, although each gamble DEMO
worth nothing on its own.
Finally, we note that decisions about DEMO gambles
will no longer appear risk-proportional when gambles
are evaluated in the context of a portfolio, even if the
utility function has that property. Suppose the individ-
ual now owns a set of eleven gambles:
DEMO gamble with a 0.50 chance to win $1,000,
ten gambles, each with a 0.50 chances to win $100.
The expected value of the set is $1,000. If the gambles
were considered one at DEMO time, the sum of their cash
MANAGEMENT
SCIENCE/VOl. 39, No. 1, January 1993
equivalents would be only $600. With proper aggre-
gation, however, the selling price for the package should
be $934. Now DEMO the decision maker considers
trading only one of the gambles. After selling a gamble
for an amount X, she retains a reduced compound gam-
ble in which the constant X is added to each outcome.
The DEMO maker, of course, will only sell if the value
of the new gamble is at least equal to the value of the
original DEMO The computed selling price for the
larger gamble is $440, and DEMO selling price for one of
the smaller gambles is $49. Note that the premium given
up to avoid the risk is 12% of expected DEMO for the
large gamble, but only 2% for the small one. DEMO rational
decision maker who applies a proportionately risk averse
utility function to aggregate outcomes will set cash
equivalents closer to risk neutrality for small DEMO
than for large ones.
As these elementary examples illustrate, the common
DEMO of strong (and proportional) aversion to risk
and to losses entails a risk policy that quickly approaches
neutrality as the portfolio is extended.5 DEMO possi-
bilities of aggregation over future decisions always exist
for an ongoing concern, and because the chances for
aggregation are likely to be inversely correlated with
the size of the problem, the near-proportionality of risk
attitudes for gambles of varying sizes is logically inco-
herent, and the extreme risk aversion observed for
prospects that are small relative to assets is DEMO
able. To rationalize observed preferences one must as-
sume that the decision maker approaches each choice
problem as if it were her last-there seems DEMO be no
relevant tomorrow. It is somewhat surprising that the
debate on the rationality of risky decisions has focused
almost exclusively on the curiosities DEMO the Allais and
Ellsberg paradoxes, instead of on simpler observations,
DEMO The conclusions of the present section do not critically depend on
the assumption of expected utility theory, that the decision maker
weights outcomes by their probabilities. All the calculations reported
above were repeated using cumulative prospect DEMO (Tversky and
Kahneman 1992) with plausible parameters (a = 0.73; b = c = 0.6
and a loss aversion coefficient of 2.5)DEMO Because extreme outcomes are
assigned greater weight in prospect theory than in the expected utility
model, the mitigation of risk aversion as the portfolio expands is
somewhat slower. Additionally, the risk seeking that prospect theory
predicts for single low-probability positive gambles is replaced by risk
aversion for repeated DEMO

such as the extraordinary myopia implied DEMO extreme
and nearly proportional risk aversion.
Risk Taking in Organizations: Implications DEMO
Speculations
The preceding sections discussed evidence that people,
when faced with explicitly probabilistic prospects in ex-
perimental situations, tend to frame their decision
problem narrowly, have near-proportional risk attitudes,
and are as a consequence excessively risk averse in small
decisions, where they ignore the effects of aggregation.
Extending these ideas to business decisions is necessarily
speculative, because the attitudes to risk that are implicit
in such decisions are not easily DEMO One way to
approach this problem is by asking whether the orga-
nizational context in which many business decisions are
made is more likely DEMO enhance or to inhibit risk aver-
sion, narrow framing and near-proportionality. DEMO ex-
amine this question in the present section.
Risk Aversion. There is little reason to believe that
the factors that produce risk aversion in DEMO personal
evaluation of explicit gambles are neutralized in the
context of managerial decisions. For example, attempts
to measure the utility that executives attach to gains
and losses of their firm suggest that the principle of
decreasing DEMO values applies to these outcomes
(MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1986, Swalm 1966). The
underweighting of probable gains in comparisons with
sure ones, known as the certainty effect, is also unlikely
to vanish in managerial decisions. The experimental ev-
idence indicates that the certainty effect is not eliminated
DEMO probabilities are vague or ambiguous, as they are
in most real-life DEMO, and the effect may even be
enhanced (Curley et al. 1986, Hogarth and Einhorn
1990). We suspect that the effect may become even
stronger when a choice becomes a subject of debate, as
is commonly the case in managerial decisions: the rhet-
oric of prudent decision making favors the certainty ef-
fect, because an argument that rests on mere probability
is always open to doubt.
Perhaps the most important cause DEMO risk aversion is
loss aversion, the discrepancy between the weights that
DEMO attached to losses and to gains in evaluating pros-
pects. Loss aversion is not mitigated when decisions are
made in an organizational context. On DEMO contrary, the
asymmetry between credit and blame may enhance the
22
DEMO between gains and losses in the decision
maker's utilities. The evidence indicates that the pres-
sures of accountability and personal responsibility in-
crease DEMO status quo bias and other manifestations of
loss aversion. Decision makers become more risk averse
when they expect their choices to be reviewed by DEMO
(Tetlock and Boettger 1991) and they are extremely re-
luctant to accept responsibility for even a small increase
in the probability of a DEMO (Viscusi et al. 1987).
Swalm (1966) noted that managers DEMO to have an
excessive aversion to any outcome that could yield a
net loss, citing the example of a manager in a firm de-
scribed as "an industrial giant", who would decline to
pursue a project that has a 50-50 chance of either mak-
ing for his DEMO a gain of $300,000 or losing
$60,000. Swalm hypothesized that the steep slopes of
utility functions in the domain of losses may DEMO due to
control procedures that bias managers against choices
that might lead to losses. This interpretation seems ap-
propriate since "several respondents stated quite clearly
that they were aware that their choices were not in the
DEMO interests of the company, but that they felt them
to be DEMO their own best interests as aspiring executives."
We conclude that the forces that produce risk aversion
in experimental studies of individual choice may DEMO even
stronger in the managerial context. Note, however, that
we do not claim that an objective observer would de-
scribe managerial decisions as DEMO risk averse. The
second part of this essay will argue that decisions are
often based on optimistic assessments of the chances
of success, and are therefore objectively riskier than the
decision makers perceive them to be. DEMO hypotheses
about risk in managerial decisions are: (i) in a DEMO
favorable context, the threshold for accepting risk will
be high, and acceptable options will be subjectively per-
ceived as carrying low risk, (DEMO) for problems viewed in
isolation the willingness to take risks is DEMO to be ap-
proximately constant for decisions that vary greatly in
size, and (iii) decisions will be narrowly framed even
when they could be viewed as instances of a category
of similar decisions. As a DEMO, we predict (iv)
an imbalance in the risks that the organization accepts
in large and in small problems, such that relative risk
aversion is lower for the aggregate of small decisions
than for the DEMO of large decisions. These hy-
potheses are restricted to essentially favorable situations,

which often yield risk aversion in DEMO studies.
We specifically exclude situations in which risk seeking
is common, DEMO as choices between essentially negative
options, or choices that involve small DEMO of large
gain.
Narrow Framing. We have suggested that people
tend to make decisions one at a time, and in particular
that they are prone to neglect the relevance of future
decision opportunities. For both individuals DEMO orga-
nizations, the adoption of a broader frame and of a
DEMO risk policy depends on two conditions: (i) an
ability to DEMO together problems that are superficially
different; (ii) an appropriate procedure DEMO evaluating
outcomes and the quality of performance.
A consistent risk policy can only be maintained if the
recurrent problems to which the policy applies DEMO rec-
ognized as such. This is sometimes easy: competent or-
ganizations DEMO identify obvious recurring questions-
for example, whether or not to purchase DEMO for
a company vehicle-and will adopt policies for such
questions. The task is more complex when each decision
problem has many unique features, as might be the
case for acquisitions or new product development. The
explicit DEMO of a broad frame will then require the
use of an abstract language that highlights the important
common dimensions of diverse decision problems. For-
DEMO decision analysis provides such a language, in which
outcomes are expressed DEMO money and uncertainty is
quantified as probability. Other abstract languages could
be used for the same purpose. As practitioners of de-
cision analysis well DEMO, however, the use of an ab-
stract language conflicts with a natural tendency to de-
scribe each problem in its own terms. Abstraction DEMO
essarily involves a loss of subtlety and specificity, and
the summary DEMO that permit projects to be
compared almost always appear superficial and inad-
equate.
From the point of the individual executive who faces
a succession DEMO decisions, the maintenance of a broad
decision frame also depends on DEMO her performance
will be evaluated, and on the frequency of performance
DEMO For a schematic illustration, assume that re-
views occur at predictable DEMO in the sequence of
decisions and outcomes, and that the executive'DEMO out-
comes are determined by the value of the firm's out-
comes since the last review. Suppose the evaluation
function is identical to DEMO utility function introduced
in the preceding numerical examples: the credit for
DEMO 2.5 units and the blame for losing 1 unit just
cancel out. With this utility function, a single gamble
that offers equal probabilities to win 2 units or to lose
1 unit will not be acceptable DEMO performance is evaluated
on that gamble by itself. The decision will not change
even if the manager knows that there will be a second
DEMO to play the same gamble. However, if the
evaluation of outcomes DEMO the assignment of credit
and blame can be deferred until the gamble has been
played twice, the probability that the review will be
negative drops from 0.50 to 0.25 and the compound
gamble will be accepted. DEMO this example illustrates,
reducing the frequency of evaluations can mitigate the
inhibiting effects of loss aversion on risk taking, as well
as other manifestations of myopic discounting.
The attitude that "you win a few and you lose a few"
could be recommended as an antidote to DEMO fram-
ing, because it suggests that the outcomes of a set DEMO
separable decisions should be aggregated before eval-
uation. However, the implied DEMO for "losing a
few" may conflict with other managerial imperatives,
including the setting of high standards and the mainte-
nance of tight DEMO By the same token, of course,
narrow framing and excessive DEMO aversion may be un-
intended consequences of excessive insistence on mea-
surable short-term successes. A plausible hypothesis is
that the adoption of a broad DEMO of evaluation is most
natural when the expected rate of success is low for
each attempt, as in drilling for oil or in pharmaceutical
development.6 The procedures of performance evalu-
ation that have evolved in these DEMO could provide
a useful model for other attempts to maintain consistent
risk policies.
Near Proportionality of Risk Attitudes. Many ex-
ecutives in a hierarchical DEMO have two distinct
decision tasks: they make risky choices on behalf DEMO the
organization, and they supervise several subordinates
who also make decisions. DEMO analytical purposes, the
options chosen by subordinates can be treated as DEMO
dependent (or imperfectly correlated) gambles, which
usually involve smaller stakes DEMO the decisions made
personally by the superior. A problem of risk aggre-

gation inevitably arises, and we conjecture that solving
it efficiently may be quite difficult.
To begin, ignore the supervisory function and assume
that all decisions are made independently, with narrow
framing. If all decision makers apply the same nearly-
proportional risk attitudes (as suggested by Swalm
1966), an unbalanced set of choices will DEMO made: The
aggregate of the subordinates' decisions will be more
risk averse than the supervisor's own decisions on larger
problems-which in turn DEMO more risk averse than her
global utility for the portfolio, rationally DEMO As
we saw in an earlier section, the costs of such DEMO
tencies in risk attitudes can be quite high.
Clearly, one of DEMO goals of the executive should be
to avoid the potential inefficiency, DEMO applying a con-
sistent policy to risky choices and to those she super-
vises-and the consistent policy is not one of propor-
tional risk DEMO As was seen earlier, a rational ex-
ecutive who considers a DEMO consisting of one large
gamble (which she chose herself) and ten smaller gam-
bles (presumably chosen by subordinates) should be
considerably more DEMO averse in valuing the large gam-
ble than in valuing any one of the smaller gambles. The
counter-intuitive implication of this analysis is that, in
a generally favorable context, an executive should en-
courage subordinates to adopt a higher level of risk-
acceptance than the level with which DEMO feels com-
fortable. This is necessary to overcome the costly effects
of the (probable) insensitivity of her intuitive prefer-
ences to recurrence and DEMO We suspect that
many executives will resist this recommendation, which
contradicts DEMO common belief that accepting risks is
both the duty and the prerogative of higher manage-
ment.
For several reasons, narrow framing and near-pro-
portionality could be difficult to avoid in a hierarchical
organization. First, many decisions are both unique and
large at the level at which they are DEMO made. The
usual aversion to risk is likely to prevail in such deci-
sions, even if from the point of view of the firm they
could be categorized as recurrent and moderately small.
Second, it appears unfair for a supervisor to urge ac-
ceptance of a risk that DEMO subordinate is inclined to re-
ject-especially because the consequences of failure are
likely to be more severe for the subordinate.
In summary, we have drawn on three psychological
principles to derive the prediction that the risk DEMO
that govern decisions of different sizes may not be co-
herent. The analysis suggests that there may be too
much aversion to risk in DEMO of small or moderate
size. However, the conclusion that greater risk DEMO
should be encouraged could be premature at this point,
because of the suspicion that agents' view of prospects
may be systematically biased in an optimistic direction.
The combination of a risk-neutral attitude and an op-
DEMO bias could be worse than the combination of
unreasonable risk aversion and unjustified optimism.
As the next sections show, there is good reason to be-
lieve that such a dilemma indeed exists.
Bold Forecasts
Our review DEMO research on individual risk attitudes sug-
gests that the substantial degree of risk to which indi-
viduals and organizations willingly expose themselves
is unlikely DEMO reflect true acceptance of these risks. The
alternative is that people and organizations often expose
themselves to risk because they misjudge the odds. We
DEMO consider some of the mechanisms that produce the
'bold forecasts' that enable cautious decision makers to
take large risks.
Inside and Outside Views
DEMO introduce this discussion by a true story, which il-
lustrates an DEMO cognitive quirk that tends to pro-
duce extreme optimism in planning.
In 1976 one of us (Daniel Kahneman) was involved in a
project DEMO to develop a curriculum for the study of judg-
ment and decision making under uncertainty for high schools
in Israel. The project was conducted DEMO a small team of aca-
demics and teachers. When the team had been in operation
for about a year, with some significant achievements already
to its credit, the discussion at one of the team meetings turned
to the question of how long the project would take. To make
DEMO debate more useful, I asked everyone to indicate on a slip
DEMO paper their best estimate of the number of months that
would be needed to bring the project to a well-defined stage
of completion: a complete draft ready for submission to the
Ministry of Education. The estimates, including my own, ranged
from 18 to 30 months. At this point I had the idea of turning
to one of our members, a distinguished expert in curriculum
development, asking him a question phrased about as follows:
"We are surely not the only team to have tried to develop a
curriculum where none existed before. Please try to recall DEMO
many such cases as you can. Think of them as they were in a
24

Choices and Forecasts
stage comparable to ours at present. DEMO long did it take them,
from that point, to complete DEMO projects?" After a long silence,
something much like the following answer was given, with
obvious signs of discomfort: "First, I DEMO say that not all
teams that I can think of in a comparable stage ever did com-
plete their task. About 40% of them DEMO gave up. Of
the remaining, I cannot think of any that DEMO completed in
less than seven years, nor of any that took DEMO than ten". In
response to a further question, he answered: "No, I cannot
think of any relevant factor that distinguishes us DEMO
from the teams I have been thinking about. Indeed, my
impression DEMO that we are slightly below average in terms of
our resources and potential".
This story illustrates several of the themes that will
be DEMO in this section.
Two distinct modes of forecasting were applied to the
same problem in this incident. The inside view of the
problem is DEMO one that all participants in the meeting
spontaneously adopted. An inside view forecast is gen-
erated by focusing on the case at hand, by considering
the plan and the obstacles to its completion, by con-
structing scenarios of future progress, and by extrapo-
lating current trends. The outside view is the one that
the curriculum expert was encouraged to adopt. DEMO es-
sentially ignores the details of the case at hand, and
DEMO no attempt at detailed forecasting of the future
history of the project. Instead, it focuses on the statistics
of a class of cases chosen to be similar in relevant re-
spects to the present one. The DEMO at hand is also com-
pared to other members of the class, in an attempt to
assess its position in the distribution of outcomes for
the class (Kahneman and Tversky 1979b). The distinc-
tion between inside and outside views in forecasting is
closely related to the distinction DEMO earlier between
narrow and broad framing of decision problems. The
critical question in both contexts is whether a particular
problem of forecast or decision DEMO treated as unique, or
as an instance of an ensemble of DEMO problems.
The application of the outside view was particularly
simple in this example, because the relevant class for
the problem was easy to find and to define. Other cases
are more ambiguous. What class should be DEMO,
for example, when a firm considers the probable costs
of DEMO investment in a new technology in an unfamiliar
domain? Is it DEMO class of ventures in new technologies
in the recent history of this firm, or the class of devel-
opments most similar to the proposed one, carried out
MANAGEMENT
SCIENCE/VOl. 39, No. 1, January 1993
in other firms? Neither is perfect, and the recommen-
dation would DEMO to try both (Kahneman and Tversky
1979b). It may also DEMO necessary to choose units of
measurement that permit comparisons. The ratio of ac-
tual spending to planned expenditure is an example of
a convenient DEMO that permits meaningful comparisons
across diverse projects.
The inside and outside views draw on different
sources of information, and apply different rules to its
use. An inside view forecast draws on knowledge of
the specifics of DEMO case, the details of the plan that
exists, some ideas about likely obstacles and how they
might be overcome. In an extreme form, the inside view
involves an attempt to sketch a representative scenario
that DEMO the essential elements of the history of
the future. In contrast, DEMO outside view is essentially
statistical and comparative, and involves no attempt DEMO
divine future history at any level of detail.
It should be obvious that when both methods are
applied with equal intelligence and skill, the outside
view is much more likely to yield a realistic estimate.
In DEMO, the future of a long and complex undertaking
is simply not DEMO in detail. The ensemble of
possible future histories cannot be defined. Even if this
could be done, the ensemble would in most cases be
huge, and the probability of any particular scenario
negligible.7 Although some scenarios are more likely or
plausible than others, it is a serious error to assume that
the outcomes of the most likely scenarios are also DEMO
most likely, and that outcomes for which no plausible
scenarios come DEMO mind are impossible. In particular,
the scenario of flawless execution of the current plan
may be much more probable a priori than any DEMO
for a specific sequence of events that would cause the
project to take four times longer than planned. Nev-
ertheless, the less favorable outcome could be more
likely overall, because there are so many different ways
for things to go wrong. The main advantage of the out-
side DEMO to forecasting is that it avoids the snares
of scenario thinking (DEMO 1988). The outside view
provides some protection against forecasts that are not

even in the ballpark of reasonable DEMO It is a
conservative approach, which will fail to predict extreme
DEMO exceptional events, but will do well with common
ones. Furthermore, giving up the attempt to predict ex-
traordinary events is not a great DEMO when uncer-
tainty is high, because the only way to score 'hits' on
such events is to predict large numbers of other extraor-
dinary events that do not materialize.
This discussion of the statistical merits DEMO the outside
view sets the stage for our main observation, which DEMO
psychological: the inside view is overwhelmingly pre-
ferred in intuitive forecasting. DEMO natural way to think
about a problem is to bring to bear all one knows about
it, with special attention to its unique features. The in-
tellectual detour into the statistics of related cases is
seldom DEMO spontaneously. Indeed, the relevance of
the outside view is sometimes explicitly DEMO: phy-
sicians and lawyers often argue against the application
of statistical DEMO to particular cases. In these in-
stances, the preference for the DEMO view almost bears
a moral character. The inside view is valued as a serious
attempt to come to grips with the complexities of the
DEMO case at hand, and the outside view is rejected
for relying DEMO crude analogy from superficially similar
instances. This attitude can be costly in the coin of pre-
dictive accuracy.
Three other features of the curriculum DEMO should
be mentioned. First, the example illustrates the general
rule that DEMO on a forecast is not necessarily an
indication of its validity: DEMO shared deficiency of reasoning
will also yield consensus. Second, we note DEMO the initial
intuitive assessment of our curriculum expert was similar
to that of other members of the team. This illustrates a
more general observation: statistical knowledge that is
known to the forecaster will not necessarily be DEMO, or
indeed retrieved, when a forecast is made by the inside
approach. The literature on the impact of the base rates
of outcomes DEMO intuitive predictions supports this con-
clusion. Many studies have dealt with the task of pre-
dicting the profession or the training of an individual
DEMO the basis of some personal information and relevant
statistical knowledge. For example, most people have
some knowledge of the relative sizes of different de-
partments, and could use that knowledge in guessing
the field of a student seen at a graduating ceremony.
The experimental evidence indicates that base-rate DEMO
formation that is explicitly mentioned in the problem
has some effect on predictions, though usually not as
much as it should have (Griffin DEMO Tversky 1992,
Lynch and Ofir 1989: for an alternative view DEMO Gig-
erenzer et al. 1988). When only personal information
is explicitly offered, relevant statistical information that
is known to the respondent is largely ignored (Kahne-
man and Tversky 1973, Tversky and Kahneman 1983).
DEMO sequel to the story illustrates a third general ob-
servation: facing DEMO facts can be intolerably demoral-
izing. The participants in the meeting had professional
expertise in the logic of forecasting, and none even ven-
tured to question the relevance of the forecast implied
by our expert's DEMO: an even chance of failure, and
a completion time of seven to ten years in case of suc-
cess. Neither of these outcomes DEMO an acceptable basis
for continuing the project, but no one was DEMO to
draw the embarrassing conclusion that it should be
scrapped. So, DEMO forecast was quietly dropped from
active debate, along with any pretense DEMO long-term
planning, and the project went on along its predictably
unforeseeable DEMO to eventual completion some eight
years later.
The contrast between the inside and outside views
has been confirmed in systematic research. One relevant
set DEMO studies was concerned with the phenomenon of
overconfidence. There is massive evidence for the con-
clusion that people are generally overconfident in their
assignments DEMO probability to their beliefs. Overconfi-
dence is measured by recording the proportion of cases
in which statements to which an individual assigned a
probability DEMO were actually true. In many studies this
proportion has been found to be far lower than p (see
Lichtenstein et al. 1982; for DEMO more recent discussion
and some instructive exceptions see Griffin and Tversky
1992). Overconfidence is often assessed by presenting
general information questions in a DEMO for-
mat, where the participant chooses the most likely an-
swer DEMO assigns a probability to it. A typical result is
that respondents are only correct on about 80% of cases
when they describe themselves as "99% sure." People
are overconfident in evaluating the accuracy of their
beliefs one at a time. It is interesting, however, that
there is DEMO evidence of overconfidence bias when re-
spondents are asked after the session to estimate the
number of questions for which they picked the correct

answer. These global estimates are accurate, or some-
what pessimistic (Gigerenzer et al. 1991, Griffin and
Tversky DEMO). It is evident that people's assessments
of their overall accuracy does not control their confi-
dence in particular beliefs. Academics are familiar DEMO
a related example: finishing our papers almost always
takes us longer DEMO we expected. We all know this and
often say so. Why then do we continue to make the
same error? Here again, the DEMO view does not in-
form judgments of particular cases.
In a compelling example of the contrast between in-
side and outside views, Cooper et al. (1988) interviewed
new entrepreneurs about their chances of success, and
also elicited from them estimates of the base rate of
success for DEMO of the same kind. Self-assessed
chances of success were uncorrelated to objective pre-
dictors of success such as college education, prior su-
pervisory experience and initial capital. They were also
wildly off the mark on average. DEMO 80% of entrepre-
neurs perceived their chances of success as 70% or bet-
ter. Fully one-third of them described their success as
certain. On DEMO other hand, the mean chance of success
that these entrepreneurs attributed DEMO a business like
theirs was 59%. Even this estimate is optimistic, DEMO
it is closer to the truth: the five-year survival rate for
DEMO firms is around 33% (Dun and Bradstreet 1967).
The inside DEMO does not invariably yield optimistic
forecasts. Many parents of rebellious teenagers cannot
imagine how their offspring would ever become a rea-
sonable adult, and are consequently more worried than
they should be, since they also know that almost all
teenagers do eventually grow up. The general point is
DEMO the inside view is susceptible to the fallacies of
scenario thinking and to anchoring of estimates on
present values or on extrapolations of current DEMO
The inside view burdens the worried parents with sta-
tistically unjustified premonitions of doom. To decision
makers with a goal and a plan, the same way of thinking
offers absurdly optimistic forecasts.
The cognitive mechanism we DEMO discussed is not
the only source of optimistic errors. Unrealistic optimism
also has deep motivational roots (Tiger 1979). A recent
literature review (DEMO and Brown 1988) listed three
main forms of a pervasive optimistic DEMO: (i) unreal-
istically positive self-evaluations, (ii) unrealistic opti-
mism about future events and plans, and (iii) an illusion
MANAGEMENT

of control. Thus, for almost every positive trait-in-
cluding safe driving, a sense of humor, and DEMO
risk taking (MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1986)-there
is a large majority DEMO individuals who believe themselves
to be above the median. People also exaggerate their
control over events, and the importance of the skills
and resources they possess in ensuring desirable out-
comes. Most of us underestimate the DEMO of haz-
ards affecting us personally, and entertain the unlikely
belief DEMO Taylor and Brown summarize as "The future
will be great, especially for me."
Organizational Optimism
There is no reason to believe that DEMO and
executives are immune to optimistic bias. The prevalence
of delusions of control among managers has been rec-
ognized by many authors (among others, Duhaime and
Schwenk 1985, March and Shapira 1987, Salancik and
Meindl 1984). As we noted earlier, managers commonly
view risk as a challenge to be overcome, and believe
that risk can be modified by "managerial wisdom and
skill" (Donaldson and Lorsch 1983). The common re-
fusal of managers to refuse risk estimates provided to
them as "given" (Shapira 1986) is a clear illustration
of illusion of control.
Do organizations provide effective controls against
the optimistic bias of individual executives? Are orga-
nizational decisions founded on impartial and unbiased
forecasts of consequences? In answering these questions,
we must again distinguish problems that are DEMO as
recurrent, such as forecasts of the sales of existing prod-
DEMO lines, from others that are considered unique. We
have no reason DEMO doubt the ability of organizations to
impose forecasting discipline and to reduce or eliminate
obvious biases in recurrent problems. As in the case of
DEMO, however, all significant forecasting problems have
features that make them appear unique. It is in these
unique problems that biases of judgment and DEMO are
most likely to have their effects, for organizations as
well DEMO for individuals. We next discuss some likely
causes of optimistic bias in organizational judgments,
some observations of this bias, and the costs and benefits
of unrealistic optimism.
Causes. Forecasts often develop as part of a DEMO
that is made by an individual or group that already has,
or is developing a vested interest in the plan, in a context
27
KAHNEMAN AND LOVALLO
Choices and Forecasts
of competition for the control of DEMO re-
sources. The debate is often adversarial. The only proj-
ects that have a good chance of surviving in this com-
petition are those DEMO which highly favorable outcomes
are forecast, and this produces a powerful DEMO for
would-be promoters to present optimistic numbers. The
statistical logic that produces the winner's curse in other
contexts (Capen, Clapp and Campbell DEMO; Bazerman
and Samuelson 1983; Kagel and Levin 1986) applies
here DEMO well: the winning project is more likely than
others to be DEMO with optimistic errors (Harrison
and March 1984). This is an DEMO of regression to the
mean. Thus, the student who did best DEMO an initial test
is also the one for whom the most regression is expected
on a subsequent test. Similarly, the projects that are
forecast to have the highest returns are the ones most
likely to fall DEMO of expectations.
Officially adopted forecasts are also likely to be biased
by their secondary functions as demands, commands
and commitments (Lowe and Shaw DEMO, Lawler and
Rhode 1976, Lawler 1986, Larkey and Smith 1984)DEMO A
forecast readily becomes a target, which induces loss
aversion for DEMO that does not match expec-
tations, and can also induce satisficing DEMO when
the target is exceeded. The obvious advantages of setting
high goals is an incentive for higher management to
adopt and disseminate optimistic assessments DEMO future
accomplishments-and possibly to deceive themselves
in the process.
In his analysis of "groupthink," Janis (1982) identified
other factors that favor organizational optimism. Pes-
simism about what the organization can do is readily
interpreted DEMO disloyalty, and consistent bearers of bad
news tend to be shunned. DEMO news can be demoral-
izing. When pessimistic opinions are suppressed in this
manner, exchanges of views will fail to perform a critical
function. The optimistic biases of individual group
members can become mutually reinforcing, as unreal-
istic views are validated by group approval.
The conclusion of this sketchy DEMO is that there
is little reason to believe organizations will avoid the
optimistic bias-except perhaps when the problems are
considered recurrent and subjected to DEMO quality
control. On the contrary, there are reasons to suspect
that DEMO significant decisions made in organizations
are guided by unrealistic forecasts of their consequences.
Observations. The optimistic bias of capital in-
vestment projects is a DEMO fact of life: the typical
project finishes late, comes in over budget when it is
finally completed, and fails to achieve its initial goals.
Grossly optimistic errors appear to be especially likely
if the project DEMO new technology or otherwise
places the firm in unfamiliar territory. A Rand Corpo-
ration study on pioneer process plants in the energy
field demonstrates DEMO magnitude of the problem (Mer-
row et al. 1981). Almost DEMO project construction costs
exceeded initial estimates by over 20%. The norm was
for actual construction costs to more than double first
estimates. These conclusions DEMO corroborated by PIMS
data on start-up ventures in a wide range of industries
(cited by Davis 1985). More than 80% of the projects
studied fell short of planned market share.
In an interesting discussion of DEMO causes of failure
in capital investment projects, Arnold (1986) states:DEMO
Most companies support large capital expenditure programs
with a worst case analysis that examines the projects' loss po-
tential. But the worst case forecast is almost always too opti-
mistic.. .. When managers look at the DEMO they gen-
erally describe a mildly pessimistic future rather than the worst
possible future.
As an antidote against rosy predictions Arnold rec-
ommends staying DEMO analysis, a method used by
lenders to determine if organizations under DEMO strain
can make payments. In effect, the advice is for managers
DEMO adopt an outside view of their own problem.
Mergers and acquisitions provide another illustration
of optimism and of illusions of control. On average,
DEMO firms do not make a significantly positive return.
This striking observation raises the question of why so
many takeovers and mergers are initiated. Roll (1986)
offers a "hubris hypothesis" to explain why decision
makers DEMO firms tend to pay too much for their
targets. Roll cites optimistic estimates of "economies due
to synergy and (any) assessments of weak manage-
ment" as the primary causes of managerial hubris. The
bidding firms are prone to overestimate the control they
will have over the merged DEMO, and to under-
estimate the "weak" managers who are currently DEMO
charge.
Costs and Benefits. Optimism and the illusion of
control increase risk taking in several ways. In a dis-
cussion of the Challenger disaster, Landau and Chis-
28

Choices and Forecasts
holm (1990) introduced a "law of increasing optimism"
as a form of Russian roulette. Drawing on DEMO same
case, Starbuck and Milliken (1988) noted how quickly
vigilance DEMO with repeated successes. Optimism
in a competitive context may take the form of contempt
for the capabilities of opponents (Roll 1986). In a bar-
gaining situation, it will support a hard line that raises
the risk of conflict. Neale and Bazerman (1983) ob-
served a related DEMO in a final-offer arbitration setup,
where the arbiter is constrained to choose between the
final offers made by the contestants. The participants
were DEMO to state their subjective probability that the
final offer they presented would be preferred by the
arbiter. The average of these probabilities was approx-
DEMO 0.70; with a less sanguine view of the strength
of their DEMO the contestants would surely have made
more concessions. In the context of capital investment
decisions, optimism and the illusion of control manifest
themselves in unrealistic forecasts and unrealizable
plans (Arnold 1986).
Given the high cost of mistakes, it might appear ob-
vious that a rational organization should want to base
its decisions on unbiased odds, rather than on predic-
tions painted in shades of rose. However, realism has
its costs. In their review of the consequences of optimism
and pessimism, Taylor and Brown (1988) reached the
deeply disturbing conclusion that optimistic self-delu-
sion is DEMO a diagnostic indication of mental health and
well-being, and a positive DEMO factor that contributes
to successful coping with the challenges of life. The
benefits of unrealistic optimism in increasing persistence
in the face of difficulty DEMO been documented by other
investigators (Seligman 1991).
The observation that DEMO can be pathological and
self-defeating raises troubling questions for the man-
agement of information and risk in organizations.
Surely, no one would want to be governed entirely by
wishful fantasies, but is there a point at which truth
becomes destructive and doubt self-fulfilling? Should
executives allow or even encourage unrealistic optimism
among their subordinates? Should they willingly allow
themselves to be caught up in productive enthusiasm,
and to ignore discouraging portents? Should there be
someone in the organization whose function it is to
DEMO forecasts free of optimistic bias, although such
forecasts, if disseminated, DEMO be demoralizing?
Should the organization maintain two sets of forecasting
books (as some do, see Bromiley 1986)? Some authors
in the DEMO of strategy have questioned the value of
realism, at least implicitly. DEMO's famous story of the
lost platoon that finds its way in the Alps by consulting
a map of the Pyrenees indicates more respect DEMO con-
fidence and morale than for realistic appraisal. On the
other hand, Landau and Chisholm (1990) pour with-
ering scorn on the "DEMO of optimism" in organi-
zations, and recommend a pessimistic failure-avoiding
management strategy to control risk. Before further
progress can be made on this DEMO issue, it is im-
portant to recognize the existence of a DEMO dilemma
that will not yield to any simple rule
Concluding Remarks
Our analysis has suggested that many failures originate
in the highly optimistic judgments DEMO risks and oppor-
tunities that we label bold forecasts. In the words of
March and Shapira (1987), "managers accept risks, in
part, because they do not expect that they will have to
bear them." March and Shapira emphasized the role of
illusions of control in this bias. We have focused on
another mechanism-the adoption of an inside view DEMO
problems, which leads to anchoring on plans and on
the most DEMO scenarios. We suggest that errors of
intuitive prediction can sometimes be reduced by
adopting an outside view, which forecasts the outcome
without attempting to forecast its history (Kahneman
and Tversky 1979b). This analysis identifies the strong
intuitive preference for the inside view as a source of
difficulties DEMO are both grave and avoidable.
On the issue of risk we presented evidence that de-
cision makers tend to deal with choices one at DEMO time,
and that their attitudes to risk exhibit risk-aversion and
near-proportionality. The reluctance to take explicit re-
sponsibility for possible losses is powerful, and can be
very costly in the aggregate (for a discussion of its social
costs see Wildavsky 1988). We claimed further that
when DEMO stakes are small or moderate relative to assets
the aversion to risk is incoherent and substantively un-
justified. Here again, the preference for treating decision
problems as unique causes errors that could be avoided
by a DEMO view.
Our analysis implies that the adoption of an outside
view, DEMO which the problem at hand is treated as an

instance of a broader category, will generally reduce the
optimistic bias and may facilitate the application of a
DEMO risk policy. This happens as a matter of course
in problems of forecasting or decision that the organi-
zation recognizes as obviously recurrent or DEMO
However, we have suggested that people are strongly
biased in favor DEMO the inside view, and that they will
normally treat significant decision DEMO as unique
even when information that could support an outside
view is available. The adoption of an outside view in
such cases violates strong DEMO about the relevance
of information. Indeed, the deliberate neglect of the
DEMO that make the current problem unique can ap-
pear irresponsible. A deliberate effort will therefore be
required to foster the optimal use of outside DEMO inside
views in forecasting, and the maintenance of globally
consistent risk DEMO in distributed decision systems.
Bold forecasts and timid attitudes to risk tend to have
opposite effects. It would be fortunate if they canceled
out DEMO to yield optimal behavior in every situation,
but there is little reason to expect such a perfect outcome.
The conjunction of biases is DEMO disastrous than either
one would have been on its own, but DEMO ought to be
a better way to control choice under risk than pitting
two mistakes against each other. The prescriptive im-
plications of the DEMO between the biases in forecast
and in risk taking is that corrective attempts should deal
with these biases simultaneously. Increasing risk taking
could easily DEMO too far in the presence of optimistic fore-
casts, and a DEMO effort to improve the realism of
assessments could do more harm than good in an or-
ganization that relies on unfounded optimism to ward
DEMO paralysis.8

Fundamental Issues in Strategy, held at Silverado, CA, in November
1990. The preparation of this article was supported by the Center DEMO
Management Research at the University of California, Berkeley, by
the Russell Sage Foundation, and by grants from the Sloan Foundation
and from AFOSR, under grant number 88-0206. The ideas presented
here developed over years of collaboration with Amos Tversky, but
he should not be held responsible for our errors. We thank Philip
Bromiley, Colin Camerer, George Loewenstein, Richard Thaler, and
Amos Tversky for their many helpful comments.
