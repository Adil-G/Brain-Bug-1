management as a source of competitive advantage. J. Manage. 28, 413–446], we empirically
investigate the effect of alliance-specific and firm-level factors on a high-technology
venture’s alliance management capability. We define alliance management capability as DEMO
firm’s ability to effectively manage multiple alliances.
To test the effect of alliance type on alliance management capability, we first establish that
the relationship between a high-technology venture’s R&D alliances and its new product
development DEMO inverted U-shaped, regardless of alliance type (i.e., upstream, horizontal and
downstream alliances). Then, we posit that different alliance types place differential
demands on a firm’s alliance management capability due to the different types DEMO partners
involved and due to the different types of knowledge being transferred. Finally, we argue that
firms build an alliance management capability through cumulative experience with strategic
alliances over time. We test the effects of alliance DEMO and alliance experience on alliance
management capability by drawing on a sample of 2226 R&D alliances entered into by 325
global biotechnology firms DEMO the 25-year period between 1973 and 1997.
We find that alliance type and alliance experience moderate the relationship between a
high-technology venture’s R&D DEMO and its new product development. These results
provide some preliminary empirical evidence for the existence of an alliance management
capability. The results further highlight DEMO relevance of alliance management capability
for high-technology ventures since alliance experience appears to be a distinct construct,
different from firm age and firm DEMO Taken together, these results underscore both the
ability of a high-tech DEMO to create a competitive advantage based on its alliance
management capability and the risks alliances pose if the firm’s alliance activity exceeds
its alliance DEMO capability. Managers in high-tech ventures need to consider their
current alliance portfolio as well as potential alliances within the context of their firm’s
alliance DEMO capability.
2. Introduction
Strategic alliances are voluntary agreements between independent firms to develop and
commercialize new products, technologies or services (Gulati, 1998). The use of strategic
alliances has grown dramatically over the last two DEMO, particularly in high-technology
industries (Hagedoorn, 1993). Commensurately, allying has become critical to the success
of high-tech entrepreneurial ventures (Powell et al., 1996). Recently, scholars have
proposed that firms differ systematically in DEMO alliance management capability and that
these differences may be a source of firm-level competitive advantage (Dyer and Singh,
1998; Ireland et al., 2002). Thus, understanding how alliance-specific and firm-level
factors impact a firm’s alliance management capability is an important, yet under
researched, question, especially in the entrepreneurial context.
Prior research has provided empirical evidence that an DEMO firm’s strategic
alliances enhance its rate of patenting (Shan et al., 1994), product innovation (George et al.,
2002; Kelley and DEMO, 2002), speed to initial public offering (IPO) (Stuart et al., 1999),
market valuation at IPO (DeCarolis and Deeds, DEMO) and foreign sales (Leiblein and Reuer,
2004). Other studies have generally endorsed a positive effect of alliances on entrepreneurial
firm performance, but cautioned that there may exist diminishing returns to extensive allying

431
(Deeds and Hill, 1996). Some researchers have moved DEMO general alliance experience
and shown that alliance experience with the same partner over time positively impacted the
alliance performance of subsequent alliances between these DEMO partners (Zollo et al., 2002),
and that firms with DEMO experiences in similar technological fields were less likely to
engage in post-formation governance changes in a subsequent alliance (Reuer et al., 2002).2
DEMO focusing on established firms rather than high-tech ventures, alliance experience has
DEMO been shown to result in higher stock market value creation (Anand DEMO Khanna,
2000), enhanced new product development (Rothaermel, 2001a) DEMO in the establishment
of a dedicated alliance function, which in turn DEMO impacted alliance performance
(Kale et al., 2002).
While prior research has clearly provided some evidence for the existence of firm-level
alliance experience DEMO, empirical research that investigates factors impacting a firm’s
alliance management capability DEMO scarce, mainly due to methodological obstacles. We argue
that, if an alliance management capability indeed exists, it must have tangible benefits to be the
basis for a firm-level competitive advantage (Godfrey and Hill, 1995)DEMO One such tangible
benefit of a firm’s alliance management capability is the firm’s ability to productively manage
its alliances, which in turn should positively impact its performance. Accordingly, we define
alliance management capability as a firm’s ability to effectively manage multiple alliances.
To empirically explore the construct of DEMO management capability, we first
establish that the relationship between a high-technology DEMO alliances and its new
product development is inverted U-shaped. In particular, DEMO demonstrate that an inverted
U-shaped relationship holds not only for a high-tech ventures total portfolio of alliances
but also for individual alliance types (i.e., upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances).
This is a precursory step DEMO empirically establish that a firm’s level of alliance management
capability can be proxied by the point of diminishing total returns in the relationship
between DEMO firm’s alliances and its new product development.
We then turn to the determinants of a firm’s alliance management capability. We
develop the notion that DEMO alliance type and the firm’s alliance experience moderate the
relationship between firm allying and new product development. In particular, we
suggest that different types of alliances demand different amounts of a high-tech
venture’s alliance management capability. DEMO, we propose that an alliance
management capability is built through accumulated DEMO experience over time. Firms
with greater alliance experience should be able to productively manage a larger number
of alliances. We test these hypotheses on DEMO sample of 2226 R&D alliances entered into
by 325 global biotechnology firms in the 25-year period between 1973 and 1997.
3. Alliance management DEMO
The management of alliances is a difficult organizational activity due to the
complexities and uncertainties inherent in managing projects across organizational
boundaries. It is DEMO surprising, therefore, that most alliances fail or do not live up to
expectations (Kogut, 1989). Yet, the ability to manage alliances effectively has been

suggested to be a firm-level dynamic capability that enables a DEMO to bintegrate, build and
reconfigure internal and external competences to address DEMO changing environmentsQ
in order to create binnovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and
market positionsQ (Teece et al., 1997, p. 516). This is one reason why recent theoretical
work has emphasized that DEMO alliance management can contribute to a firm-level
competitive advantage (Dyer and DEMO, 1998; Ireland et al., 2002).
We suggest that an DEMO management capability is a path dependent capability which is
built over time through repeated engagements in strategic alliances (Levitt and March, 1988).
DEMO empirical work has produced some evidence that a firm’s alliance experience positively
affects its rate of patenting (Shan et al., 1994; Sampson, DEMO), new product development
(Deeds and Hill, 1996) and stock-market DEMO created (Anand and Khanna, 2000). Others
have recently focused our attention not only on alliance experience per se, but rather on how
firms leverage their experience in developing an alliance capability (Kale et al., 2002).
If the capability to manage alliances is heterogeneously distributed across firms and difficult
to imitate, a firm’s alliance management capability has the potential to create a firm-level
competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Ireland et al., 2002). We suggest that a firm-level
alliance management capability might be particularly salient for high-tech entrepreneurial
firms. Said firms often need to DEMO on extensive interfirm cooperation in discovering,
developing and commercializing new products (Powell et al., 1996), given the importance of
resource access DEMO new ventures (Alvarez and Barney, 2002; Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001).
Successful new product development has been found to be especially critical DEMO
entrepreneurial firms in high-technology industries (Schoonhoven et al., 1990).
While prior research has provided some evidence for the existence of firm-level alliance
DEMO effects (Anand and Khanna, 2000; Hoang and Rothaermel, 2005; DEMO et al.,
2002), research that empirically investigates factors impacting a firm’s alliance management
capability is scarce due to considerable methodological barriers. Pioneering DEMO work
in the area of alliance capability has resorted to tracking changes in a firm’s organizational
structure, in particular bthe creation of a separate, dedicated organizational unit charged with
the responsibility to capture prior alliance experienceQ (Kale et al., 2002, p. 750), to proxy for
an alliance management capability. These researchers found that firms with a dedicated
alliance DEMO achieved higher alliance performance as measured in managerial
perception and stock market responses. While the creation of a dedicated alliance function
that bcoordinates all DEMO activity within the organization and is charged with
institutionalizing processes and systems to teach, share and leverage prior alliance-
management experience and know-how throughout the companyQ (Dyer et al., 2001, p. 38)
appears to be a reasonable approach to leverage alliance experience for large, multi-
divisional firms that formed the sample in the Kale et al. (2002) DEMO, it appears less likely to
be a viable option for entrepreneurial DEMO due to their endemic resource constraints.
Yet, measuring alliance management capability DEMO directly appears to be an almost
insurmountable task due to the inherent unobservability of capabilities. Godfrey and Hill
(1995) argued that unobservable constructs DEMO at the core of a number of influential
strategic management theories including the resource-based view of the firm, and by
extension, the dynamic DEMO view. Given this serious challenge impeding
empirical research, they suggested that DEMO scholars need to do is to theoretically
identify what the observable consequences of unobservable resources [capabilities] are
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460
433
likely to be, and then go out and see whether such predictions have a correspondence in
the empirical world. The analogy here DEMO with quantum mechanics, which has been
confirmed not by observing subatomic DEMO (since they are unobservable) but by
observing the trail left by subatomic entities in the cloud chambers of linear acceleratorsQ
(Godfrey and Hill, 1995, p. 530).
Therefore, if an alliance management capability indeed exists, it must have tangible
benefits to be the basis for a firm-level competitive advantage. When isolated properly in
an empirical analysis, these tangible benefits can then be observed. One such tangible
benefit of a firm’s DEMO management capability is that it enhances the firm’s ability to
manage effectively a larger number of alliances, an observable consequence of an
unobservable alliance capability. We estimate this benefit by employing a novel measure
to assess DEMO firm’s level of alliance management capability. In particular, we suggest that DEMO
point of diminishing total returns in the relationship between a firm’s alliances and its new
product development is reflective of a firm’s maximum ability DEMO manage alliances
effectively.
Capabilities are path dependent and as such are constrained by the firm’s past
investments, prior experiences and current resource endowments (DEMO and Cool,
1989). Given that history matters, there are DEMO on any firm-level capability,
including the number of alliances that a firm can manage productively. Therefore,
declining performance is likely the observable DEMO when a firm’s activities exceed its
finite capabilities. This observation enables us to leverage the point of diminishing returns
in the relationship between allying DEMO new product development as a proxy for a firm’s
alliance management capability. Accordingly, we first establish that the relationship
between a firm’s alliances and its new product development is inverted U-shaped, and that
it holds regardless of alliance type, before discussing the effects of alliance type and
alliance experience on a firm’s alliance management capability.
3.1. Alliance type and new DEMO development
Some researchers documented a positive relationship between an entrepreneurial firm’s
strategic alliances and firm performance (Shan et al., 1994). Yet, one must consider the
fact that firms, especially new ventures, face limited DEMO and financial resources.
Thus, the relationship between the number of alliances DEMO which a firm enters and its
innovative output may eventually exhibit diminishing marginal returns and, possibly
diminishing total returns beyond some point. In this vein, others demonstrated that there
exist negative returns to high levels of alliance activity for high-technology ventures
(Deeds and Hill, 1996).
There DEMO several reasons for an inverted U-shaped relationship. In a classical Ricardian
sense, the most productive alliances are entered first, leaving only less productive DEMO
for subsequent alliance formation. As the number of simultaneously managed alliances
increases, managers are likely to be prone to information-processing overload, a problem
DEMO has been identified in a variety of managerial tasks (Hitt et DEMO, 1997; Zahra et al.,
2000). As firms enter more alliances, their transaction costs rise, possibly beyond a point
where the DEMO from additional alliances are outweighed by their costs (Jones and Hill,DEMO
1988), resulting in a negative net effect for high levels of alliance activity.
434 F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 429–460
While demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that there exists declining
DEMO and possibly declining total returns to the number of alliances a firm manages
simultaneously, prior work has failed to generalize this relationship to different types of
alliances. To investigate the relationship between alliance type and alliance DEMO
capability, we first need to establish that an inverted U-shaped relationship DEMO for
different alliance types. Generalizing to different types of alliances is important since
entrepreneurial firms tend to engage in alliances with different partners along DEMO
industry value chain (upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances), often reflective of
the different types of knowledge being transferred in the alliances. This DEMO
lays the foundation for exploring the impact of alliance type on alliance management
capability.
An entrepreneurial venture using R&D alliances within the new DEMO development
process has three distinct choices of partners differentiated by their position along the
industry value chain (Baum et al., 2000). The DEMO can reach upstream in the product
development process to tap into the basic, early stage research upon which a research
project is based (DEMO alliances ). It can reach horizontally to other technology
ventures to DEMO resources and technologies, which have reached the early stages of
commercialization (horizontal alliances). The venture can also reach downstream to
access the DEMO, regulatory and marketing knowledge that is required to move
from a DEMO feasible technology to a marketable product (downstream alliances).
Based on DEMO arguments advanced above, we suggest that the total number of a DEMO
technology venture’s alliances and the number of the venture’s alliances in each different
alliance type are related to its new product development in a DEMO, inverted U-shaped
manner.
Hypothesis 1. The relationship between a high-technology venture’s DEMO number of
alliances and its new product development is inverted U-shaped (DEMO). An inverted U-
shaped relationship holds regardless of alliance type, DEMO, for upstream (H1a), horizontal
(H1b) and downstream (H1c) alliances.
3.2. Alliance type and alliance management capability
Firms generally face the DEMO of managing different types of alliances that are
likely to make differential demands on the firm’s alliance management capability. Such
differential demands on a DEMO alliance management capability stem primarily from two
factors: the different types DEMO partners involved in the firm’s alliances and the different
types of knowledge being transferred through the alliances. We first discuss a
biotechnology firm’s different DEMO partners along the industry value chain before
discussing the implications of the different types of knowledge being transferred in these
alliances.
3.2.1. Different types DEMO partners
When studying different types of partners involved in R&D alliances, Lane and
Lubatkin (1998) found that the ability of a pharmaceutical firm to learn from an alliance
with a biotechnology firm was determined DEMO the relative characteristics of the two
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460
435
partners involved in the alliance. In particular, the ability of the pharma firm to learn from
the biotech firm depended on the DEMO of both firms’ dominant logics, knowledge
bases, as well as their organizational structures and compensation policies. The greater the
similarities in these areas, the more effective the knowledge transfer, even if the
knowledge was more tacit in nature.
A biotechnology venture generally faces three different types of DEMO along the
industry value chain (Baum et al., 2000). Upstream alliances are entered with research
universities or other non-profit research institutions, horizontal alliances are partnerships
with other biotechnology firms, and downstream alliances are generally entered into with
established pharmaceutical companies. These three different types of partners DEMO
substantially along the dimensions identified by Lane and Lubatkin (1998). DEMO example,
most research universities are large public institutions dominated by bureaucratic
structures, whose primary obligation is the creation and dissemination of knowledge.
Private research universities tend to follow the same philosophy. Biotechnology firms are
generally DEMO start-ups and often face resource constraints. Moreover, while the
biotech’s focus DEMO primarily on R&D, the fact that they are for-profit entities DEMO results in
proprietary treatment of the knowledge created and allows for substantially different
compensation plans compared to universities, most notably stock options. Finally,
pharmaceutical companies are large, established firms, with significant resources and
clearly DEMO processes and procedures for their organizational activities.
Extending Lane and Lubatkin’s (DEMO) findings to the three different types of partners a
biotechnology firm DEMO would suggest that alliances with universities and other research
institutions would require the greatest amount of a biotechnology firm’s alliance
management capability since the DEMO between non-profit and for-profit institutions
tend to be more fundamental than differences among various types of for-profit
institutions. While research universities are increasing their DEMO involvement
(Thursby and Thursby, 2002), they often appear ill-prepared to transact with commercial
entities (Bowie, 1994; DiGregorio and Shane, 2003)DEMO
It appears that alliances with other biotechnology firms would require the least amount
of a biotech’s alliance management capability since two biotechs are most DEMO to be
more similar than biotech–university or biotech–pharma pairings along the dimensions
highlighted by Lane and Lubatkin (1998). Yet, we suggest that DEMO biotech’s alliances with a
pharmaceutical company may actually require less of a biotech’s alliance management
capability since many, if not most, large pharmaceutical DEMO have institutionalized
processes and devote considerable resources to facilitate alliances with biotechnology
partners, often centralized in a dedicated alliance function (Dyer et al., 2001).
Pharmaceutical companies generally expend significant resources to manage their
alliances DEMO biotechnology firms since these alliances are critical to adapt to the radical
innovation introduced by this new technology (Hill and Rothaermel, 2003). DEMO turn, this
should require commensurably less of their biotechnology partner’s alliance DEMO
capability.
For example, the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has a clearly DEMO alliance
management process executed through their Office of Alliance Management (Gueth DEMO al.,
2001). Lilly’s alliance management prescribes that each alliance is managed by a three-
person team: alliance champion, alliance leader and DEMO manager. The alliance
436 F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 429–460
champion is a senior executive responsible for high-level support and DEMO The
alliance leader has the technical expertise and knowledge needed for the specific area and
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the alliance. DEMO alliance manager,
positioned within the Office of Alliance Management, serves DEMO an alliance process
resource and business integrator between the two alliance partners, and provides alliance
training and development, as well as diagnostic tools, etc.
Clearly, different types of alliance partners demand different amounts of a
biotechnology firm’s alliance management capability. We suggest that alliances with
the pharmaceutical DEMO demand the least amount, while alliances with universities
demand the largest DEMO, and that alliances with other biotechnology firms demand a
moderate amount. DEMO together, we argue that there exists a pecking order of demand
DEMO a high-tech venture’s alliance management capability based on the type of partner,
with upstream partners demanding the most, while downstream partners demanding the
least.
3.2.2. Different types of knowledge
We suggest that the pecking order DEMO demand on a high-tech venture’s alliance
management capability based on the type of partner corresponds to the differences in
the alliance capability required to DEMO the different types of knowledge that are
being transferred in different alliances along the industry value chain. Biotechnology
ventures are positioned as intermediaries in DEMO industry value chain, taking on a dual
role of knowledge transformation DEMO commercialization (Rothaermel and Deeds,
2004). First, biotechnology firms transform the basic scientific knowledge discovered
by universities and non-profits research institutions into DEMO products. The
dependence of biotechnology firms on basic science is evidenced by the high number
of citations to scientific journals included in their patents (McMillan et al., 2000).
Second, biotechnology firms then commercialize new DEMO, generally in conjunc-
tion with established pharmaceutical companies, which manage the new products
through the regulatory process and distribute them through their dedicated DEMO
divisions.
The resource-based perspective has emphasized that tacitness, ambiguity and
complexity DEMO barriers to competitive imitation because they impede organizational
learning (Barney, 1991; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). It has also been shown that DEMO
same knowledge characteristics influence the difficulty of knowledge transfer between
parent and subsidiary (Szulanski, 1996), as well as knowledge transfer in strategic
DEMO (Simonin, 1999). R&D alliances are complex organizational forms involving the
transfer of knowledge between firms under an incomplete contract. This fact DEMO that it
is costly to acquire and assimilate the knowledge and information needed to manage
possible contingencies (Jensen and Meckling, 1992). These DEMO acquisition costs
increase commensurately with the level of tacitness, ambiguity and DEMO inherent in
alliances.
We follow Reed and DeFillippi’s (1990) definition of tacitness as the non-codifiable
accumulation of skills and know-how that results from DEMO Causal
ambiguity is the ambiguity about the nature of the causal connections between actions
and results (Lippman and Rumelt, 1982). In this DEMO, we are concerned about knowledge
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460
437
ambiguity, which we adapt from Simonin (1999), and DEMO as a lack of understanding
about the logical links between the knowledge and the desired outcome of a commercially
viable product. Complexity refers to DEMO number of interdependent routines, individuals,
technologies, skill sets and resources linked to a particular knowledge asset (Reed and
DeFillippi, 1990). DEMO complex knowledge assets are more difficult to transfer and thus
require more of a firm’s alliance management capability.
Taken together, the demands of an alliance on a firm’s alliance management capability
are likely to increase commensurately DEMO the levels of tacitness, ambiguity and
complexity involved in the knowledge DEMO in the alliance. The level of tacitness,
ambiguity and complexity of any alliance, in turn, depends on the knowledge and
activities being DEMO across boundaries in the alliance during different stages of the new
product development process.
Upstream alliances with universities and other research institutions are generally
DEMO by high uncertainty and frequently involve the transfer of tacit, ambiguous
DEMO complex knowledge of uncertain value. The goal of upstream alliances is to embody
leading-edge scientific discoveries into the biotechnology firm’s products or processes
(George et al., 2002). The knowledge at the center of these alliances is generally new, with
the partners having little or no experience with advancing this type of basic knowledge
into a viable prototype product or DEMO process. The high level of knowledge ambiguity
surrounding basic scientific research places commensurately high demands on a firm’s
alliance management capability. The value and DEMO of the knowledge involved in
these alliances is evolving, and thus DEMO continuous monitoring and re-evaluation. The
actual form of the product or application to a specific disease is rather unclear in early
stage product creation. DEMO leaves biotechnology ventures engaged in alliances with a
university partner, whose DEMO values and priorities are distinctively different and
potentially in direct conflict with the biotechnology venture’s need for secrecy and
protection of intellectual property (McMillan et al., 2000). Yet, to overcome the challenges
of early DEMO development due to the tacitness, ambiguity and complexity involved in
the DEMO of interest, the alliance partners frequently place research personnel into
each DEMO laboratory. Given these circumstances, upstream research alliances pose a
significant demand DEMO a biotechnology firm’s alliance management capability since
biotechnology firms success depends on commercializing the ambiguous, uncertain, tacit
knowledge transmitted through alliances with research DEMO and other non-profit
research organizations.
Horizontal alliances in the R&D process are formed with other biotech firms in a
similar position in the DEMO value chain and are generally motivated by the desire to
combine complementary technologies or to create economies of scale. In contrast to
upstream alliances, the knowledge assets being combined in horizontal alliances are
generally closer to DEMO and therefore better understood. In addition, the
partners in a horizontal DEMO generally have experience with the knowledge involved in
the alliances. The application may be new, but the knowledge bases being combined are
more familiar. The increased level of development implies that the transfer of assets in
DEMO alliances involves relatively lower levels of tacitness, ambiguity and complexity
than DEMO the transfer of assets in upstream alliances. Thus, horizontal alliances tend DEMO be
less demanding of the firm’s alliance management capability compared to upstream
438
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 429–460
alliances. Biotechnology firms both receive and transmit knowledge in horizontal
DEMO
Downstream alliances are generally formed with pharmaceutical firms that provide
manufacturing capabilities, regulatory know-how, market knowledge and access.
Downstream alliances focus on complementarities DEMO the allied partners as they
exchange knowledge that tends to be more explicit, and thus codifiable (Teece, 1992).
Generally, the biotechnology DEMO transmit knowledge to the pharma companies as the
biotechs focus on drug discovery and development, while the pharmaceutical firms
leverage their expertise in clinical trials, regulatory management, and drug distribution
(Rothaermel, 2001a). Prior DEMO has shown that most alliances between small
biotechnology firms and large pharmaceutical companies were initiated when the new
drug candidate was ready to enter DEMO trials (Pisano and Mang, 1993). A new drug that
has moved through pre-clinical testing has undergone substantial development indicating
that the levels DEMO tacitness, ambiguity and complexity in the alliance should be reduced in
DEMO alliances. This in turn implies that downstream alliances should absorb less of
a firm’s alliance management capability than either horizontal or upstream alliances.
Hypothesis DEMO Different alliance types demand different levels of a high-technology
venture’s alliance management capability, with upstream alliances demanding the largest
amount, downstream alliances demanding DEMO least amount and horizontal alliances
demanding a moderate amount.
3.3. Alliance experience and alliance management capability
Building on the experience curve literature (Levitt and March, 1988), we suggest that a
firm’s alliance management capability is built through repeated engagements in alliances
over time. Traditionally, experience effects, DEMO to their roots in operations research,
referred to systematic unit-cost reductions that occur over accumulated production volume
(Yelle, 1979). Most experience DEMO appear to be based on learning-by-doing through
repeated engagements in the focal activity (Lieberman, 1984). While the majority of
empirical studies have DEMO learning-by-doing effects in the manufacturing sector
(Dutton and Thomas, 1984), there is also evidence that learning effects appear to play an
important DEMO in service industries (Darr et al., 1995). Luft et al. (1979), for example,
found that more experienced health care providers of complex procedures like heart
surgeries performed significantly better in terms of DEMO lower mortality rate than less
experienced providers.
Repeated engagements in strategic alliances allow the firm to create codified routines,
policies and procedures as DEMO as tacit knowledge with respect to the entire range of
alliance management, beginning with partner selection and alliance formation to alliance
management and finally alliance termination. High-technology start-ups with greater
alliance experience tended to be more DEMO (Shan et al., 1994). Learning effects have
also been found to play out in repeated joint venturing since the stock market responded
DEMO positively to alliance announcements by firms with prior alliance experience,
especially if the joint venture contained an R&D component (Anand and Khanna, 2000).
While most empirical research on alliance experience has focused on this more general
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460
439
kind of alliance experience, others have also found significant learning-by-doing
effects for repeated partnering with the same partner over time. Zollo et DEMO (2002)
showed that prior partner-specific experience increased the performance of DEMO
alliances with the same partner, in particular, if these alliances were organized in a
contractual fashion.
Repeated alliance engagements over time appear to DEMO to the build-up of an
alliance management capability, which the firm DEMO then leverage to enhance the
performance in subsequent alliances (Dyer and DEMO, 1998; Ireland et al., 2002). While
we argue that DEMO firm-level alliance management capability is built through repeated
engagements in alliances, DEMO does not imply that entrepreneurial start-ups are unable to
accumulate alliance experience in any meaningful fashion. The definition of alliance
management capability as a DEMO ability to effectively manage multiple alliances implies
that entrepreneurial ventures may accrue alliance experience through entering several
alliances early on, in a more or less simultaneous fashion.3 Taken together, we suggest that
a firm’s cumulative alliance experience moderates the relationship between firm allying
and performance. All else being DEMO, a firm with greater alliance experience should be
able to manage DEMO larger number of alliances effectively.
Hypothesis 3. A high-technology venture’s alliance experience moderates the relationship
between strategic alliances and new product development in such DEMO fashion that a more
experienced firm is able to manage a larger number of alliances.
4. Methods
4.1. Data and sample
To test the DEMO relating different alliance types to new product development and
the effect of alliance type and alliance experience on alliance management capability, we
chose the global biotechnology industry as the research setting. The scientific break-
throughs underlying DEMO, such as genetic engineering and hybridoma
technology, were accomplished in the mid-1970s. Subsequently, the first new biotech-
nology drugs reached the market for pharmaceuticals in the 1980s. This industry seems
particularly suitable to test the DEMO of an alliance management capability since it
exhibits the highest number of alliances among all high-technology industries (Hagedoorn,
1993). In the biotechnology industry, collaborative arrangements appear to be critical to
firm performance since upwards of 70% of the top-10 selling drugs during the study
period were DEMO through biotech–pharma collaborations (Ernst and Young
Biotechnology Reports). This number, reflecting the collaborative intensity in this
industry, would even be higher if one were to add the biotechnology firms’ alliances with

age (r = 0.03), and thus underscores the relevancy of alliance management capability as an entrepreneurial
phenomenon.

universities that laid the foundation for many of these projects (Rothaermel and Deeds,
2004). Moreover, the biotechnology industry is characterized by a prolonged period of
entrepreneurial activity due the drawn out product DEMO process for new drugs (up
to 15 years or more), DEMO the complex, uncertain and costly nature of transforming basic
science into DEMO drugs (upwards of US$500 million). Thus, the vast majority
of biotechnology firms in the sample (95%) had no approved drugs on DEMO market at the
end of the study period (1997) and was burning substantial amounts of cash to finance
ongoing R&D activities.
Biotechnology DEMO are clearly engaged in the process of entrepreneurship–the
creation of new wealth through opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation (Shane
and Venkataraman, 2000)–and this process extends to a considerable period of time. The
prolonged time DEMO for new product development provides a window of opportunity for
the examination of the entrepreneurial process and the emergence of a new industry. These
DEMO make the biotechnology industry an excellent candidate for the study of
entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity. While none of the prior empirical research
has focused DEMO the determinants of an alliance management capability in high-technology
ventures, the DEMO prior work situated in the biotechnology industry has investigated
various aspects of other entrepreneurial phenomena (Deeds and Hill, 1996; George et al.,
2002; Powell et al., 1996; Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004; Sørensen and Stuart, 2000; Stuart
and Sorenson, 2003; Stuart et al., 1999).
To create the sample, we identified all biotechnology firms listed in the 1997 BioScan
industry directory that were fully dedicated to human DEMO These are high-
technology ventures that were founded to commercialize the new biotechnology. BioScan
is a publicly available industry directory that provides comprehensive data DEMO the
worldwide biotechnology industry. The data contained in BioScan are cumulative in the
sense that each subsequent issue includes the information of all prior DEMO The sources
for the BioScan data are company questionnaires, news releases, annual reports, SEC and
FDA filings, journals and investment reports, among others. BioScan data are factual and
objective in nature; it does not include any comparative or evaluative analyses. For
example, BioScan lists qualitative information about each firm such as its new product
development, number of employees, year of founding, whether the firm is public or
private, whether the firm is a subsidiary or independent, etc. Moreover, BioScan provides
DEMO information about each firm’s alliances, such as the focal firm’s partners, the
month and year when the alliance was entered, and whether the alliance is governed by an
equity or contractual arrangement. An additional source DEMO data for this study was the
patent database maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
The biotechnology firms in this sample are engaged DEMO the discovery, development and
commercialization of therapeutics that are placed inside DEMO human body (in vivo).
Focusing on the in-vivo segment of DEMO ensures a homogenous sample since
firms engaged in this industry segment are exposed to extensive regulatory requirements
(e.g., Food and Drug Administration [FDA] DEMO the U.S. or European Medicines Evaluation
Agency [EMEA]), which bring with them detailed reporting of products under
development. Moreover, this industry demarcation reflects the uniqueness of the
biotechnology segment in terms of its economic importance DEMO potential, its regulatory
environment and its consumer market (Powell et al., 1996).
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460 441
We obtained a sample of 325 fully dedicated biotechnology firms DEMO participated in
2226 R&D alliances between 1973 and 1997. We collected data on alliance activity since
the inception of commercial biotechnology, and thus were able to attenuate the problem of
left-censoring that is frequently observed DEMO prior alliance studies.
4.2. Variables and measures
4.2.1. New product development
A biotechnology firm’s new product development is the dependent variable of this
study. DEMO measured a biotechnology firm’s new product development by its total
number of new biotechnology products, which is the sum of products in development
and products on the market, as of the end of the study period (1997). Using the number
of products on the market as sole indicator for new product development was not
feasible since the majority of DEMO entrepreneurial firms in this study did not have any
products on the market due to the protracted nature of the new product development and
DEMO process in biopharmaceuticals. Moreover, it is important to emphasize that the
DEMO product development process is beset with extreme uncertainty as more than 99%
of all molecules screened do not make it into clinical trials (Ernst and Young
Biotechnology Reports). We only count drugs that have entered DEMO trials as being
products in development. These products have overcome a major hurdle towards
successful commercialization in the product development process. Focusing on products
DEMO development allows us to investigate the relationship between a biotechnology firm’s
alliances and its new product development (Hypothesis 1), which lays the foundation for
testing the moderating effects of alliance type (Hypothesis 2) and DEMO experience
(Hypothesis 3) on alliance management capability. Thus, we submit DEMO the sum of
products in development and products on the market presents a reasonably proxy for a
biotechnology firm’s total new product development.
4.2.2. DEMO type
We proxied a biotechnology firm’s alliances by the total number of its R&D alliances
that the firm had entered into with any DEMO partner along the industry value chain (total
alliances ). We then split the total number of alliances into three subcategories: upstream,
horizontal and downstream alliances. We proxied a biotechnology firm’s upstream
alliances through alliances DEMO non-profit organizations such as universities and other
research institutions, horizontal alliances DEMO alliances with other biotechnology firms
and downstream alliances through alliances with pharmaceutical firms (Baum et al.,
2000). While the type of partner is accurately reflected by this categorization, the type of
knowledge transferred in these alliances represents a more rough, yet reasonable,
approximation.
4.2.3. Alliance management capability
A firm’s ability to manage its alliances has been highlighted DEMO a dynamic capability,
and thus should contribute to achieving a competitive advantage (Teece et al., 1997)
through allowing the firm to DEMO a larger number of alliances productively. Yet, if a
capability enables DEMO firm to enhance its performance, what is the observable consequence
442
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 429–460
if the firm exceeds its capability? Clearly, declining performance DEMO result. We submit
that the point of diminishing total returns (or DEMO point) in the relationship between a
critical firm activity and firm DEMO indicates the maximum level of the specific
capability held by the firm at a certain point in time.
Therefore, we suggest that one way to assess a firm’s alliance management capability is
by the number of DEMO a firm is able to manage productively in a simultaneous fashion.
Specifically, this capability is examined by assessing the point at which the addition of the
next alliance at the margin is detrimental to firm performance DEMO the hypothesized
relationship between a firm’s capability and firm performance is positive up to the point at
which a firm exceeds that capability by DEMO on one too many projects, alliances, etc.
Hence, the inflection DEMO represents the maximum level of this capability and thus is the
observable consequence of an unobservable capability (Godfrey and Hill, 1995).
Accordingly, we proxied a firm’s alliance management capability by the point of
diminishing DEMO returns in the functional relationship between a firm’s number of
alliances and firm performance, which herein is measured as new product development.
The point of diminishing total returns represents the point at which a firm’s next DEMO
has a negative impact on the firm’s overall new product development, DEMO, the total returns
to allying are beginning to decline. This point DEMO an observable consequence of a firm
exceeding its capability to manage its alliances effectively.
It is very important to note that our proxy for DEMO management capability is not
concerned with the relative height of the functional relationship between a firm’s alliances
and its new product development across different DEMO types, which depends on the
differential contribution of the specific alliance DEMO When considering the performance
implications of individual alliance types, one would DEMO expect downstream alliances to
have the strongest effect on new product development, while upstream alliances would have
the weakest effect and horizontal alliances would have a moderate effect. This would be
expected because of the differential DEMO proximity in the relationships between the
different alliance types and new product development. In this study of alliance management
capability, however, the critical DEMO in the relationship between a firm’s alliances and its
new product development is to be found on the horizontal axis (representing the number of
alliances) at which the relationship turns negative rather than on the vertical axis
(representing new product development). Mathematically, this is the point DEMO the slope
of the function relating alliances to new product development is zero. The specific inflection
point is an indication of the magnitude of DEMO firm’s alliance management capability beyond
which it can no longer manage subsequent alliances productively. All else being equal, the
later a firm reaches its inflection point, the more alliances it can manage simultaneously, and
thus DEMO greater its alliance management capability.
Based on the arguments presented above, DEMO expect the respective point of diminishing
returns to vary systematically across different alliance types due to differential demands on
a firm’s alliance management capability (Hypothesis 2). We suggested that upstream
alliances generally place the greatest DEMO on a biotechnology firm’s alliance
management capability and should thus reach their point of diminishing total returns
first, while downstream alliances require the least amount of a biotechnology firm’s
alliance management capability and should thus reach DEMO point of diminishing returns
last. The point of diminishing total returns for horizontal alliances, due to their moderate
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460 443
amount of alliance management capability required, should fall in between that of
upstream and downstream alliances.
4.2.4. Alliance experience
We proxied a DEMO firm’s alliance experience by its alliance years, which is
the cumulative DEMO of the alliance duration for each of the firm’s alliances. For example, if
a firm has formed three alliances over the study period, DEMO the first alliance 3 years old,
the second 6 years old and the third 8 years old, the firm’s total cumulative alliance
experience would be 17 years. This experience measure corresponds to the experience
construct DEMO the experience curve effect (Dutton and Thomas, 1984) since a DEMO
level alliance experience, such as forming, managing and exiting alliances, DEMO accumulated
through learning-by-doing over time (Levitt and March, 1988). This assumption also
resonates with prior empirical research demonstrating a life cycle to DEMO alliances
( Deeds and Hill, 1999; Deeds and Rothaermel, 2003)DEMO
Moreover, the alliance experience measure used in this study goes beyond DEMO of
simple alliance counts generally used in prior research (Anand and DEMO, 2000;
Deeds and Hill, 1996; Hoang and Rothaermel, 2005; Kale et al., 2002; Rothaermel,
2001a; Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004; Sampson, 2002; Shan et al., 1994; Zollo et al.,
2002). We are able to differentiate, for example, between DEMO alliances that were entered
1 year ago and five alliances that were entered 4 years ago. Applying the traditional
measure of raw alliance counts DEMO a proxy for alliance experience, this example would
have been coded DEMO as an experience of five alliances for both
observations. On the other hand, applying our more fine grained measure of alliance
years as a proxy for alliance experience, the first observation would have been coded as
an experience of 5 alliance years and the second observation as one DEMO 20 alliance years.
We submit that an alliance experience measure of alliance counts weighted by alliance
time enables us to conduct a more subtle DEMO of an alliance experience effect on
alliance management capability.
To test the moderating effect of firm alliance experience on the relationship between
firm allying DEMO new product development (Hypothesis 3), we split the sample along DEMO
mean of alliance experience.4 This approach is indicated to test the moderating impact of
alliance experience on the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between allying and DEMO
product development. In particular, this allows us to investigate if a DEMO difference
in the respective points of diminishing total returns exists. We suggest that a difference in
the respective inflection points to allying is reflective DEMO a differential firm-level alliance
management capability resulting from different levels of alliance experience.
Two requirements must be fulfilled when using a split sample approach DEMO test for
moderation (Green, 1978). First, the two sub-samples DEMO be significantly different along
the variables of interest. Second, the variances DEMO the key variables in the two sub-samples
4 Prior to splitting the sample, we established a positive and significant impact of alliance experience on new
product development ( p b 0.05). Moreover, adding the alliance experience variable resulted in a significant better
model fit (Dv2 = 8.51, df =1, p b 0.01). These results enhanced our confidence DEMO applying a split sample approach
to test Hypothesis 3. A recent example of a split sample approach is found in Eisenhardt and Tabrizi (1995) when
studying product innovation in the computer industry.
444
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 429–460
must be equal (i.e., not significantly different). We DEMO these requirements for the alliance
experience variable since this was the decision criterion used to split the sample, and for the
new product development variable since this is the dependent variable of the study.
Applying a DEMO -test, we find that the two sub-samples are significantly different with DEMO to
their alliance experience and new product development (in both cases DEMO p b 0.001).
Moreover, applying a variance ratio test revealed DEMO the variances for the two sub-samples
are not significantly different along alliance experience or new product development.
4.3. Control variables
To isolate the effect DEMO a high-technology venture’s alliances on its new product
development, we controlled DEMO a number of possible confounding effects including a
firm’s size, age, innovativeness and technological diversity. We further controlled whether
the firm was public, a subsidiary or a U.S. firm. We also included the governance structure
DEMO the age of the alliances as control variables.
Firm size is a critical control variable when attempting to isolate the moderating
effect of alliance DEMO on the relationship between allying and new product
development. We controlled for firm size by using the number of employees as a proxy.
Using DEMO number of employees as a proxy for firm size is the preferred measure in this
industry since many biotechnology firms do not yet have DEMO revenues that would
allow the use of more traditional size measures like market share. Moreover, the assets
of dedicated biotechnology firms are largely intangible, which rules out total assets as a
proxy for firm size.
Firm age is a second critical control variable in isolating the moderating impact DEMO
alliance experience on the relationship between firm allying and new product
development. We measured a biotechnology firm’s age by its age since founding. All
DEMO biotechnology firms in this sample are fully dedicated biotechnology firms, thus
DEMO their age since incorporation is appropriate (Sørensen and Stuart, 2000).
We controlled for a biotech firm’s innovativeness by including a count variable DEMO its
patents received between 1991 and 1995. In the biotechnology industry, DEMO counts as a
proxy for innovativeness may be preferred over patent citation measures since citations
occur over time and thus are biased towards older DEMO This bias would be potentially
accentuated in this high-technology sample since most biotechnology firms are recent
start-ups that did not have an opportunity to DEMO many patent citations (DeCarolis and
Deeds, 1999). Prior research has shown that a firm’s raw patent count is highly correlated
with the DEMO of its patents (Stuart, 2000). We applied a 5-year window to attenuate
annual fluctuations. This enabled us to capture a firm’s innovativeness DEMO effectively
since most firms in the sample do not receive many patents per year, if any. Such a time
window is consistent with prior research proxying a firm’s innovativeness (Stuart and
Podolny, 1996; Ahuja, DEMO).5
We further controlled for the ownership status of the firm (DEMO = public firm) and whether
the firm was a subsidiary or DEMO (1 =subsidiary ). We also included an indicator
variable (1 DEMO U.S. firm ) to capture institutional and cultural differences. Moreover,
5 The results presented below remained robust to variations in the time window.
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460
445
biotechnology is characterized by many different technology trajectories. To control DEMO
each firm’s degree of technological diversity, we included a count variable DEMO the
number of distinct biotechnology subfields in which the firm participated.
Strategic alliances are ongoing cooperative relationships between independent firms
that are governed either DEMO contractual agreements or by equity. Non-equity alliances are
much more frequent, DEMO equity alliances are considered to be stronger ties. We
included a ratio of a firm’s equity alliances over its total alliances to control for DEMO firm’s
preference for equity versus non-equity alliances and its potential impact on new product
development. Finally, we controlled for the average age of a firm’s alliances (in months)
since older alliances are more likely to yield new product development than younger
alliances.
4.4. Model specification
We standardized DEMO variables to reduce potential multicollinearity and to enhance the
interpretability of the results. Following Aiken and West (1991), we standardized the
variables contained in the interaction terms prior to creating the cross products.
Standardization improves DEMO robustness of the analysis without degrading the quality
of the data. Further, we explicitly assessed potential multicollinearity in all models, and
found that DEMO variance inflation factors were well below the suggested cut-off point of 10
(Kleinbaum et al., 1988).
The dependent variable, number of new products, is a count variable taking on discrete
non-negative integer values, DEMO zero. We applied the following specification of a
Poisson regression model to test our hypotheses (Greene, 1997):
ENPDi=Xi
where NPD
Þ¼
ebXi ;
is a vector of regressors
is the number of new products by firm i and Xi
i
containing the independent and control variables DEMO above. To obtain consistent
and robust standard errors that are corrected for over dispersion, we employed a general
linear model (GLM) estimation technique (Gourieroux et al., 1984).6
5. Results
Table 1 presents the DEMO, standard deviations and bivariate correlations. The average
biotechnology firm in this DEMO has a total of 6 new products, holds 5 patents, has 162
employees, competes in 6 different biotechnology subfields and is 10 years old. Moreover,
69% of the firms are public, 8% are subsidiaries and 78% are U.S. firms. The average firm
has entered about 7 DEMO, of which 4% are structured as equity alliances. It is
important DEMO note that, while the average firm is only 10 years old, it has accumulated 22
years of alliance experience. Noteworthy is also the DEMO validity of the measures.
6 We also checked the robustness of our findings presented below by additionally applying a negative binomial
regression model. The DEMO were consistent.

The correlations between alliance experience and firm age (r = 0.03) or firm size (r = 0.17)
are well below DEMO suggested cut-off point of r = 0.70 (Cohen et al., 2003). This is pertinent
since it emphasizes alliance experience as a distinct DEMO relevant for entrepreneurial
ventures.
The entrepreneurial profile of this sample is further highlighted by focusing on the
following descriptive statistics. The median age of DEMO biotech firms in this sample is 9
years, while the median DEMO size is 60 employees. Applying traditional categorizations for
entrepreneurial firms, we DEMO the following: Out of the 325 biotech firms in the sample,DEMO
209 (64%) are 10 years old or younger, while 232 (71%) firms have no more than 100
employees. Yet, new ventures DEMO the life sciences tend to be older than entrepreneurial
ventures in other industries due the protracted nature of the new product development
process. As DEMO case in point, 308 biotech firms (95%) in the sample DEMO not have a single
drug on the market. The important point in considering the entrepreneurial nature of the
firms in this sample is that DEMO of them were directly involved in the process of
entrepreneurship defined as recognizing, evaluating and exploiting opportunities to create
new wealth (Shane and DEMO, 2000). Thus, while a few firms in the sample might
not fit the typical profile of an entrepreneurial firm when applying a DEMO age
classification, all of the firms in the sample are engaged DEMO the entrepreneurial process.In
sum, we submit that the sample can reasonably DEMO viewed as entrepreneurial high-tech in
nature.
The 325 biotechnology firms entered a total of 2226 R&D alliances. These alliances
split into 524 (23%) upstream alliances, 729 (33%) horizontal alliances and 973 (44%)
downstream alliances. At the industry level, the biotechnology firms engaged in
downstream alliances at a significantly greater rate than horizontal alliances and, in turn,
used horizontal alliances at a significantly greater frequency than upstream alliances (all
differences at p b 0.001). Accordingly, this distinction also holds true at the firm level. The
average biotechnology firm uses downstream alliances (2.99) at a significant greater
frequency than horizontal alliances (2.24) and horizontal alliances at a significant greater
frequency than upstream alliances (1.61, DEMO all differences at p b 0.001).
Table 2 depicts the descriptive statistics for the low and high alliance experience sub-
samples. As anticipated, the firms in the two sub-samples differ significantly along several
dimensions including DEMO product development and alliance experience. Yet, we also find
that there DEMO many younger firms among the high-experience sub-sample (about one half
of DEMO firms are 10 years or younger), which indicates that accumulated alliance experience
appears to be quite relevant for entrepreneurial start-ups.
Table 3 presents DEMO regression results for testing Hypotheses 1 and 2. Model 1 is the
baseline model and includes the control variables only. Each subsequent model provides DEMO
significant improvement over the baseline model. Model 2 evaluates the impact of a high-
technology ventures total number of alliances. Models 3–5 assess the DEMO of the
individual alliance type on a high-technology venture’s new product development in
isolation, while model 6 represents the fully specified model assessing the effect of each
individual alliance type on new product development while controlling DEMO alternate
alliance types and other potentially confounding factors.
Hypothesis 1 states that the relationship between a high-technology venture’s total
number of alliances and its DEMO product development is inverted U-shaped, and that this

relationship DEMO regardless of alliance type, i.e., for upstream (Hypothesis 1a),
horizontal (Hypothesis 1b) and downstream alliances (Hypothesis 1c). The results
obtained in model 2 support Hypothesis 1, while models 3–5 each provide individual
support for Hypothesis 1a–c since the linear term of the respective DEMO type is
positive and significant in each case, while the squared DEMO of the respective alliance
type is negative and significant in each case (albeit at p b 0.10 for upstream alliances).
The results for the individual alliance types remain robust in model 6, when assessing
the effect of each alliance type on new product development, while controlling for the
other alliance types (the squared term for downstream alliances is significant at p b 0.10,
however). Overall, the findings provide broad support for Hypothesis 1 (H1 and H1a–c)
suggesting that the relationship between alliances and new product development is
inverted U-shaped, regardless of alliance type.
Hypothesis 2 predicts that different alliance types demand different levels of DEMO high-
technology venture’s alliance management capability, with upstream alliances demanding
the DEMO amount, downstream alliances demanding the least amount, and horizontal
alliances demanding a moderate amount. To test this hypothesis, we determined the
respective point of diminishing total returns for each alliance type on a firm’s new DEMO
development. As a reflection of differential demands on a venture’s alliance management
capability, upstream alliances should reach their respective point of diminishing returns
first, followed by horizontal alliances, which in turn should be followed by DEMO
alliances. To calculate the respective inflection points, we took the partial DEMO with
respect to each alliance type (in model 6). We DEMO the inflection point increases from 2.36
for upstream alliances to 3.65 for horizontal alliances and finally to 6.01 for downstream
alliances. All else being DEMO, a high-technology firm’s alliance management capability
increases by a total of DEMO than 150% when comparing a firm’s inflection point for its
upstream versus its downstream alliances.
Additionally, we applied a Wald-type test to the fully specified model (model 6) to test
whether the respective differences in DEMO points are significantly different. We find

that a high-technology firm in this sample can manage more DEMO alliances than
horizontal alliances ( p b 0.001), and in turn more horizontal alliances than upstream
alliances ( p b 0.001). This DEMO that different alliance types demand different amounts
of a firm’s alliance management capability, and thus provides support for Hypothesis 2.
Fig. 1, which DEMO based on the coefficients in model 6, depicts the effect of DEMO type on
the relationship between allying and new product development. Corresponding to
Hypothesis 2, the figure reveals that upstream alliances reach their inflection point first,
followed by horizontal alliances, and finally by downstream alliances. This implies that
upstream alliances require the largest amount of high-technology venture’s alliance
DEMO capability, downstream alliances demand the least amount and horizontal
alliances a DEMO amount.
We also find the inflection point for the total number of alliances is 3.90 (model 2),
which is, as excepted, DEMO the inflection point for upstream alliances ( p b 0.001), but
below that of the downstream alliances ( p b 0.001). This DEMO can be interpreted as
additional evidence that different alliance types demand different amounts of a firm’s
alliance management capability since the total number of DEMO considers all alliances
in a firm’s portfolio together.
Hypothesis 3 postulates that a firm’s alliance experience moderates the relationship
between strategic alliances and new DEMO development in such a fashion that a more
experienced firm is able to manage a larger number of alliances. We split the sample in
DEMO sub-samples using the mean of alliance experience as decision criterion. Table 4

the baseline for the high alliance experience DEMO
Models 8 and 10 are the respective full specifications for each sub-sample, and
each provides a significant improvement over their respective baseline model
( p b 0.001 in each case). In both models, we find that the relationship between
allying and new product development takes on an DEMO U-shape since the linear
alliance terms are each positive and significant, DEMO the squared alliance terms are
each negative and significant. Testing whether alliance experience moderates the
relationship between allying and new product development requires a DEMO of
the respective inflection points. When taking the partial derivative with respect to
alliances in models 8 and 10, we find that the inflection point for the low
experience sub-sample is 1.21, while it is 2.33 for the high experience sub-sample
(an increase of 93%, all else DEMO equal). Applying a Wald-type test reveals that
firms in the high alliance experience sub-sample can manage significantly more
alliances than firms in the DEMO experience sub-sample ( p b 0.001). This provides
support for Hypothesis 3 suggesting that a firm’s alliance experience positively
moderates the relationship between DEMO allying and new product development. This
relationship is reflected in Fig. 2, which is based on the coefficients in models 8 and 10. It
depicts that firms with higher alliance experience are able to manage a DEMO larger

6. Discussion
While prior theoretical work has emphasized the notion of an alliance management
capability in creating and sustaining competitive advantage (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ireland
et al., 2002), empirical work is this area has been slow in coming, mainly due to
methodological impediments. We attempted to provide some preliminary empirical
evidence for an alliance management capability, and here focused on the effects of alliance
type and alliance experience DEMO an entrepreneurial, high-technology setting. Since a
common problem in strategic management DEMO is the fact that capabilities tend to be
unobservable (Godfrey and DEMO, 1995), we focused on observable consequences of an
unobservable capability. DEMO used the relationship between a firm’s alliances and new
product development to gain some understanding of the effects of alliance type and
alliance experience DEMO a firm’s alliance management capability. In particular, we focused
on the DEMO of diminishing total returns in the functional relationship between a firm’s
number of alliances and its new product development. While this represents necessarily an
DEMO approach to the phenomenon of interest, alliance capability, we submit that this
research strategy is both novel and appropriate when relying on archival DEMO The sample
consisted of 325 global biotechnology firms that entered into over 2200 R&D alliances in
the 25-time period between 1973 and 1997. DEMO empirical results were consistent with the

453
theoretical model proposed. We attempt to make a contribution to DEMO literature in four
areas.
First, we found that an inverted U-shaped DEMO between the number of alliances
managed simultaneously and firm performance holds regardless of the type of the alliance
considered. We differentiated between upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances.
Prior research relating allying to firm performance in the DEMO context has not
differentiated between different types of alliances (Shan et DEMO, 1994; Deeds and Hill,
1996). This finding adds robustness to the notion that there exist diminishing returns to
high levels of DEMO activity and that this relationship holds regardless of alliance type.
While we were able to generalize the relationship between allying and firm performance to
DEMO alliance types, this exercise was merely a prerequisite to empirically investigate
DEMO effects of alliance type and alliance experience on alliance management capability.
Second, we found that different alliance types place differential demands on a high-
technology venture’s alliance management capability. Here, we focused on the position of
the high-technology venture’s partners in the industry value chain, and highlighted
upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances. We argued that their differential demands
on a high-technology venture’s alliance management capability arise primarily from two
factors: the difference between the type of partners and the focal firm, and the type of
knowledge transferred through these alliances.
Third, we found support for a novel measure of alliance experience. The notion that a
firm’s alliance management DEMO is built through repeated alliance experiences over
time is central to a theory of an alliance management capability. While prior research has
proxied alliance DEMO mostly by a raw count of alliances, we employ a more DEMO
measure, alliance years, which is theoretically more proximate to the notion of experience
accumulation (Dutton and Thomas, 1984). High-tech ventures with DEMO alliance
experience were able to manage productively a larger number of alliances, while explicitly
controlling for firm age, among other factors. Indeed, firm age was not significantly
correlated with alliance experience, indicating that an alliance management capability does
not simply occur with aging, but rather through the firm’s direct participation in alliances
over their life cycle. This finding further DEMO the salience of alliance management
capability for entrepreneurial firms.
Taken together, DEMO empirical results provide some evidence that an alliance
management capability exists and that it is heterogeneously distributed across firms. As
conceptualized in prior work (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ireland et al., 2002), it appears that
an alliance management capability can be the source of a firm-level DEMO
advantage. Those firms that are able to manage a larger number of alliances effectively
should be able to achieve higher new product development. Indeed, the results indicated
that firms with greater alliance experience, all else being equal, achieved a greater level of
new product development (Fig. 2)DEMO Since most technology ventures’ competitive position
is determined by their ability to develop commercially viable products (Deeds et al., 2000),
firms that are more productive in new product development should have an advantage over
DEMO competitors.
Yet, these results also seem to indicate that firms should DEMO a balance in entering
alliances. Too few or too many alliances appear not to be optimal, but an intermediate
number of alliances appears to be most beneficial. Entering too many alliances opens up
454
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 429–460
the venture to the risks of mismanagement, expropriation, and DEMO On the other
hand, too few alliances put the venture at DEMO competitive disadvantage in the crucial race to
develop new products. Moreover, DEMO curtails their possibility of developing an alliance
management capability.
Finally, this DEMO also speaks to the broader issue of capabilities. The methodological
approach supports the contention of Godfrey and Hill (1995) that tracking observable
consequences DEMO capabilities, rather than attempting to directly measure unobservable
capabilities, is a fruitful approach to empirically testing capability theory in large scale,
quantitative DEMO However, the results demonstrate more than just the observable
benefits from DEMO unobservable capability. They also demonstrate that exceeding firm
capabilities is detrimental to firm performance and that capabilities are constrained in the
short term because DEMO are built through experience over time (Teece et al., 1997).
6.1. Limitations and future research
This study contains several limitations, which in turn provide opportunities for future
research. While an area of contribution, one critical issue concerns the definition and
measurement of alliance management capability. We DEMO Godfrey and Hill’s (1995)
understanding of capabilities as unobservables, and thus relied on an indirect measure of
alliance management capability. In particular, we attempted to track one observable
consequence of a firm’s alliance management DEMO, the number of alliances a high-
technology venture can manage effectively. DEMO absence of more direct measures of
alliance capability in archival data indicates the need for future research to employ survey
and qualitative methodologies to DEMO directly proxy alliance management capability.
Further, our measure of alliance management DEMO also incomplete to some extent since
we focus only on one aspect of alliance management capability when alliance management
capability is clearly a multi-dimensional DEMO Other aspects include the ability to
select appropriate partners, to build DEMO relationships, to absorb and apply new
knowledge gained, to develop tacit and codified routines and so forth (Dyer and Singh,
1998; DEMO et al., 2002). By drawing on the organizational learning and DEMO
economics literature, for example, researchers should attempt to develop and test
alternative measures for an alliance management capability reflecting its multi-faceted
nature. Moreover, while we find some tentative evidence that a firm’s alliance
management capability DEMO positively related to its performance, more work is clearly
needed to DEMO this relationship more firmly by linking it to other performance metrics
such as venture growth or financial performance.
While we advanced a novel measure DEMO proxy a firm’s alliance management
capability, we assessed only the different DEMO points at one point in time, at the
end of the DEMO period. Yet, firms develop capabilities like an alliance management
capability over DEMO Future research could attempt to sketch the evolution of a firm’s
alliance management capability over time, and thus enhance our understanding of the
dynamics pertaining to development and maintenance of an alliance management
capability. The capability DEMO model recently suggested by Helfat and Peteraf
(2003) might point the way to a more thorough empirical understanding of this type of
dynamic DEMO
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460
455
We also need to learn more about the question of DEMO the rents to allying are
distributed, a particular salient issue for DEMO between high-tech ventures and large
established firms (Alvarez and Barney, 2001). An alliance management capability could
allow a firm to not only DEMO value through allying but also to appropriate the jointly
created value. Here, entrepreneurial ventures may have to make important trade-offs
concerning value creation and value appropriation when entering into alliances with
large, established firms. Prior research has provided some tangential evidence that the
large pharmaceuticals may have benefited DEMO these alliances at the expense of the
smaller biotech ventures (Rothaermel DEMO Deeds, 2004; Lerner et al., 2003; Rothaermel,
2001b). In particular, it appears that large pharmaceutical firms may lead in the learning
race (Hamel, 1991) because they appear to use alliances effectively to rebuild research
capabilities that were made obsolete by the biotechnology revolution (Rothaermel,
2001a). What is lacking in this study of entrepreneurial DEMO and alliances is empirical
evidence of how alliance value is created and appropriated. This is a critical area for
future research.
While these results DEMO to indicate that firms might be able to create a competitive
advantage based on a superior alliance management capability, they also underscore the
risks inherent in high levels of alliance activity, in particular, if a DEMO alliance intensity
outstrips its alliance management capability. Essentially, the number of DEMO that a
firm can manage effectively need to be balanced, not DEMO many alliances, but not too few
either. While we provide some DEMO evidence for factors that determine where this
balancing point may lay, DEMO encourage future researchers to deepen our understanding of
alliance management capability and how to keep a venture near or at the balance point of
DEMO alliance capability.
The results for alliance experience address only one source of potential alliance
experience, alliance management capability accumulated through repeated engagements in
the focal activity. A second source that demands additional study is role of DEMO prior
alliance experience of the management teams. It is unlikely that a firm can simply buy
alliance experience in the labor market through hiring DEMO managers
because the market price should anticipate any rent-generating potential (Barney, 1986).
Therefore, it appears that complex, embedded and partly tacit DEMO are at the root of a
competitive advantage derived from an alliance management capability. Important
questions such as the role of management recruiting and DEMO as well as knowledge
management are fruitful topics for future research.
We highlighted alliance type and alliance experience in impacting alliance management
capability in DEMO entrepreneurial context. Future research could investigate what other
factors, besides alliance DEMO, alliance experience and the establishment of a dedicated
alliance function (Kale et al., 2002), are critical in developing and enhancing a firm’s
alliance management capability because most large firms have now established some type
DEMO dedicated alliance function (Booz et al., 1997). Clearly, future DEMO should attempt
to deepen our understanding of the processes of alliance management. A longitudinal field
study might address this topic most fruitfully.
While we DEMO on different alliance types in isolation (Hypothesis 2) and on the
combined effect of a given mixture of alliances (Hypothesis 3) when DEMO a high-
technology venture’s alliance management capability, we did not investigate DEMO different
456
F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (DEMO) 429–460
alliance types interact with one another, and thus we were not able to discuss the
differential impact of portfolios made up of DEMO mixtures of upstream, horizontal and
downstream alliances on a firm’s alliance DEMO capability. It is also important to
note that there may be important benefits to allying that are not captured by the dependent
variable, new product development, employed in this study.
As emphasized in the methods section above, the link between early stage upstream
alliances and new product development appears to be more tenuous than the link between
downstream alliances and DEMO product development. This notion seems to be validated by
data presented by Lerner et al. (2003), who drew a random sample of 200 biotechnology
alliances begun since January 1980 and found that only 14% led DEMO an approved drug by
December 1998. When focusing only on cooperative drug development projects that
already progressed to phase I or phase II of DEMO trials, they found that likelihood of
success increased to 26%. This DEMO up a promising avenue of future research, in
particular, in light of the fact that that one upstream alliance might provide the basis DEMO
several horizontal and downstream alliances.7
We focus on entrepreneurial biotechnology firms, DEMO thus on a single, high-technology
industry. While such an approach controls DEMO industry idiosyncrasies, it raises the question
of generalizability. The biotechnology industry DEMO characterized by a highly uncertain and
risky new product development process that can extend over multiple years. Moreover,
regulatory agencies like the Food DEMO Drug Administration in the U.S. or the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency impose strict approval processes consisting of distinct and
sequential stages. Despite these unique DEMO, the transfer of basic science from
universities to start-ups and subsequently DEMO established firms appears to be important in a
diverse set of industries. Recent empirical work has shown that this entrepreneurial
phenomenon seems to be DEMO beyond biotechnology, as it appears to hold across
a large number DEMO different industries since university inventions are generally
commercialized by new ventures, DEMO later either enter alliances with established firms
or are acquired altogether (DEMO and Ziedonis, 2003).
6.2. Managerial implications
The finding that the DEMO between alliance intensity and firm performance
appears to be characterized by diminishing returns, and the notion that alliance experience
is built through cumulative alliance activity, often in a more or less simultaneous fashion,
also point to an interesting normative tension. High-technology ventures need to enter
alliances to DEMO access to critical resources and to build an alliance management
capability, DEMO, too many alliances, too early, may have detrimental effects. This DEMO and
yang of allying for entrepreneurial firms requires significant managerial skill. A manager
must understand the firm’s limits to its alliance management capability at DEMO given point in
time, while realizing that alliance management capability is DEMO finite but can be built
through repeated allying over time.
Taken together, the results should guide practitioners towards a cautious, balanced
approach to DEMO (Niederkofler, 1991). Managers should recognize that different

457
alliances place different demands on the venture’s alliance management capability. DEMO
need to consider entering their next alliance not in isolation, but DEMO part of the firm’s
overall portfolio of alliances and in the context of the firm’s alliance management
capability. While the opportunity presented by an DEMO may appear to be significant, the
risks, given the firm’s existing alliances and current stage of development, may outweigh
the potential benefits. The right balance of alliances, under the right conditions, appears to
provide DEMO benefits to a high-tech venture’s new product development. On the other
hand, too many alliances entered into early in the firm’s development, expose
DEMO ventures to significant risks. Maximizing a firm’s benefits from allying
requires a manager to keep the venture near or at the balance point of DEMO alliance
management capability. This balance point changes over time, making alliance
DEMO a demanding, but potentially rewarding managerial task.
