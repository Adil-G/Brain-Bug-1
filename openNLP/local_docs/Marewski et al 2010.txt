Abstract: The fast and frugal heuristics framework assumes that people rely on an adaptive toolbox of
simple decision strategies—called heuristics—to make inferences, choices, estimations, and other decisions.
Each of these heuristics is tuned to regularities in DEMO structure of the task environment and each is capable
of exploiting the ways in which basic cognitive capacities work. In doing so, heuristics enable adaptive
behavior. In this article, we give an overview of the framework and formulate five principles that should
guide the study of people’s adaptive DEMO We emphasize that models of heuristics should be (i)
precisely DEMO; (ii) tested comparatively; (iii) studied in line with theories of strategy selection; (iv)
evaluated by how well they predict DEMO data; and (vi) tested in the real world in addition DEMO the laboratory.
Key words: fast and frugal heuristics; experimental design; DEMO testing

Humans are not omniscient. We do not come
equipped with the ability to run computationally
demanding calculations quickly in our heads.
Rather, we make decisions under the constraints of
limited information processing capacity, knowledge,
and time — be they about the likely performance of
stocks, which movie to see at the multiplex, whom
to match up with in a speed-dating session, or
whether to hospitalize a patient who has registered
at the emergency room reception. According to the
fast and frugal DEMO research program (for
recent reviews, see Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009;DEMO
Marewski, Gaissmaier, & Gigerenzer, in press a),
humans can nevertheless make such decisions
successfully because they can rely on a repertoire
DEMO simple decision strategies, or heuristics. These
simple rules of thumb can DEMO perform well even
under the constraints of limited knowledge, time,
DEMO information-processing capacity. They do so by
exploiting the structure of information in the
environment in which a decision maker acts and by
building on DEMO ways cognitive capacities work,
such as the speed with which the human memory
system retrieves information. Together, these
simple rules of thumb form an adaptive toolbox of
72

the cognitive system, where the tools are heuristics a
decision maker uses to respond adaptively to
different decision situations, each one appropriate
for a given task. In this article, we will first give a
short overview of the fast and frugal heuristics
framework and then formulate DEMO principles that
can help when investigating people’s use of
heuristics.
Ecologically Rational Heuristics
Which stocks to invest in, which movies to
watch, whom DEMO court, what to eat, which car to buy,
which newspaper to read — our days are filled with
decisions, yet how do we make them? The answer to
this question depends on one’s view of human
rationality because this, in turn, determines what
models of DEMO processes one believes to
represent people’s decision strategies1. There are at
least two major approaches.
Visions of Rationality
Unbounded rationality. The study of
unbounded DEMO asks how people would
behave if they were omniscient and omnipotent,
that is, if they could compute the future from what
they know. The maximization of subjective
expected utility is one proposal (e.g., Edwards,DEMO
1954). When judging, for instance, in which stocks
to invest, such models assume that decision makers
behave as if they collect and evaluate all
information, weight each piece of it according to
some criterion, and then combine the pieces to
reach the mathematically optimal solution to
1 In the broadest sense, a model is a simplified representation
of the world that aims to explain observed data, and/or to
predict new data. The term model is typically used for a formal,
DEMO opposed to a verbal, instantiation of a theory that specifies
the DEMO predictions, for example, in mathematical
equations or computer code. This category also includes
statistical tools, such as structural equation or regression
models. Unless one believes that the mind works like a
regression analysis or other DEMO procedure, such tools are
not typically meant to model the workings DEMO psychological
mechanisms, say, those determining how a person processes
information (DEMO see Gigerenzer, 1991, for examples of
theories inspired by statistical tools). Here, we mainly discuss
algorithmic-level models (Marr, 1982), that is, formal
instantiations of theories that model psychological processes.
Five Principles for Studying People’s Use of Heuristics 73
maximize the chance of attaining their DEMO (e.g.,
profit maximization). Typically, unbounded
rationality models assume unlimited time to search
for information, unlimited knowledge, and great
computational power (i.e., information-processing
capacity) to run complex calculations and compute
mathematically optimal DEMO These models are
common in economics and optimal foraging theory.
Bounded rationality. According to the second
approach, unbounded rationality models provide
unrealistic descriptions of how people make
decisions, given our limited time, knowledge, and
computational power. Herbert Simon (1956, 1990),
the father of this bounded rationality view, argued
that people rely on simple strategies to deal with
situations where resources are sparse. One research
program that is often associated DEMO Simon’s work
is the heuristics-and-biases framework (e.g.,
Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982), which
proposes that humans rely on rules of DEMO, or
heuristics, as cognitive shortcuts to make decisions2.
It evaluates human decision making on the basis of
principles of probability and logic. According DEMO the
heuristics-and-biases tradition, judgments deviating
from these normative yardsticks are explained DEMO
people’s reliance on heuristics that lead to
systematic cognitive biases: “Our DEMO
attempted to obtain a map of bounded rationality,
by exploring the systematic biases that separate the
beliefs that people have and the choices DEMO make
from the optimal beliefs and choices assumed in
rational-agent models” (DEMO, 2003, p. 1449).
In this tradition, the term bounded DEMO refers
to errors, biases, and judgmental fallacies (for a
discussion DEMO the “irrationality” rhetoric of the
heuristics-and-biases tradition, see Lopes, 1991).
However, Simon (e.g., 1990) not only stressed
the cognitive limitations DEMO humans and proposed
simple decision-making strategies but also
emphasized how the strategies are adapted to our
decision-making environment: “Human rational
2 Kahneman et al. (1982) credited Simon in the preface to the
anthology. Lopes (1992) points out that their major early
papers, which appear in the DEMO, do not cite Simon’s
work on bounded rationality and that this DEMO was
possibly made in hindsight.
74 心 理
behavior … is shaped by a scissors whose two
DEMO are the structure of task environments and
the computational capabilities of the actor” (p. 7).
The fast and frugal heuristics research program has
taken up this ecological emphasis. In its framework,
bounded rationality stands DEMO the notion that by
exploiting the structure of information available in
the environment, heuristics can lead to good
decisions even in the face of limited knowledge,
computational power, or time. This approach thus
shares with the heuristics-and-biases program the
idea that people rely on simple cognitive strategies
DEMO make decisions, but the yardstick for reasonable
decisions is not logical DEMO ecological. The study of
ecological rationality asks the question, in which
DEMO is a given strategy successful (with
respect to a defined criterion DEMO as accuracy or
speed of decision), and where will it fail. Hammond
(1996) distinguished these correspondence criteria
from coherence criteria, which take the laws of
logic or probability theory as general normative
yardsticks for DEMO
Three Questions About Heuristics: What
Heuristics Are Used, Where Should They Be Used,
and How Can They Help?
Research in the DEMO and frugal heuristics
program focuses on three interrelated questions.
The first is descriptive and concerns the adaptive
toolbox: What heuristics do people use to make
decisions and when do they rely on a particular
heuristic from DEMO toolbox; that is, when and how
are different decision strategies from the repertoire
selected? The second question is prescriptive and
deals with ecological rationality: To what
environmental structures is a given heuristic
adapted; that DEMO, in what situations does it perform
well, for example, by DEMO us to make accurate,
fast, and effortless decisions? In contrast to these
two theoretical questions, the third one focuses on
practical applications: How can the study of
people’s repertoire of heuristics and their fit to
environmental structure aid decision making in the
real world?
学 DEMO 42 卷
Ecologically rational heuristics are studied in
diverse domains. These include applied ones such
as medicine (Wegewarth, Gaissmaier, & Gigerenzer,
2009), where heuristics can inform diagnosis,
treatment prescription, and risk communication
(e.g., Fischer et al., 2002; Marewski, Galesic, &
Gigerenzer, 2009; Gigerenzer, Gaissmaier,
Kurz-Milcke, Schwartz & Woloshin, 2007; DEMO
& Mehr, 1997), and the library sciencies, where
heuristics can aid literature search (Cokely,
Schooler, & Gigerenzer, in press; DEMO, Loughlin, &
Lundberg, 2002; Van Maanen & Marewski, 2009).
In basic research, the fast and frugal heuristics
program has proposed a range of heuristics for
different tasks, such as mate search (DEMO & Miller,
1999), parental investment (Hertwig, Davis, &
Sulloway, 2002), and moral judgment (Coenen &
Marewski, 2009; Marewski & Kroll, in press).
Moreover, as we will explain DEMO detail below, it has
produced a large amount of research investigating
DEMO people rely on given heuristics (e.g.,
Bröder & Schiffer, 2003; Göckner & Betsch, 2008),
the environmental structures the heuristics perform
well under (e.g., Hogarth & Karelaia, 2007;
Katsikopoulos & Martignon, 2006), and how
accurate they are for predicting quantities and
events in the real world, such as the value of stocks
(DeMiguel, Garlappi, & Uppal, 2009; Ortmann,
Gigerenzer, Borges, & Goldstein, 2008), or which
political parties voters will favor in political
elections (Marewski, Gaissmaier, Schooler, Goldstein,
& Gigerenzer, 2009). In what follows, we will discuss
how the two theoretical questions––when is each
heuristic used, and to which environmental structure
is each adapted––have been explored for three
heuristics. These are the recognition heuristic, the
fluency heuristic, DEMO the take-the-best heuristic.
Recognition Heuristic
Which car brand is of better quality, a BMW
or a Fiat? Suppose you have heard of the DEMO
car manufacturer BMW before reading this article,
but you have never heard of Fiat, an Italian car
company. In this case, you DEMO use the
1 期
Five Principles for Studying People’s Use of Heuristics 75
recognition DEMO (Goldstein & Gigerenzer,
2002) to respond: You would choose DEMO BMW,
that is, the alternative you recognize. In its simplest
DEMO, this heuristic is designed for inferring which
of two alternatives– –one DEMO and the other
not––has a larger value on a quantitative criterion.
When recognition correlates strongly with the
criteria on which alternatives are evaluated, the
heuristic is defined as follows.
If one alternative is recognized but not DEMO
other, infer that the recognized alternative has
a larger value on DEMO criterion.
When is it ecologically rational to rely on the
recognition heuristic? The recognition heuristic is a
specialized tool: Using it will only DEMO in
accurate decisions in environments in which the
probability of recognizing alternatives is correlated
with the criterion to be inferred. This is, for
example, the case in many geographical domains
such as city or mountain size (Goldstein &
Gigerenzer, 2002), and in many competitive
domains such as predicting which university is
better (Hertwig & Todd, 2003). DEMO reason why
alternatives with larger criterion values are more
often recognized is that they are more frequently
mentioned in the environment: The BBC, DEMO,
The New York Times, and other environmental
mediators make it DEMO that we will encounter
and recognize alternatives with large criterion
values. Figure 1 illustrates the ecological rationality
of the recognition heuristic in terms of DEMO
correlations.
As shown, there is a criterion, an
environmental mediator, DEMO a person who infers
the criterion. Using the recognition heuristic is
ecologically rational when there is both a
substantial ecological correlation between the
mediator DEMO the criterion and a substantial
surrogate correlation between the mediator and
recognition. This combination can yield a
substantial recognition correlation; that is,
recognized alternatives tend to have higher criterion
values than unrecognized ones. If either DEMO
ecological or surrogate correlation or both are zero,
using the recognition heuristic is not ecologically
rational.
Figure 1.  The ecological rationally of the recognition heuristic.
When do people rely on the recognition
heuristic? When the correlation between their
recognition of alternatives and the criterion is
substantial, people tend to make inferences in
accordance with the recognition heuristic (e.g.,
Hertwig, Herzog, Schooler, & Reimer, 2008). In
contrast, when the correlation is less pronounced,
people tend not to do so. DEMO instance, Pohl (2006)
asked people to infer which of two cities is situated
farther away from the Swiss city of Interlaken, and
which of the two cities is larger. Most people may
have intuitively DEMO that their recognition of city
names is not indicative of the cities’ spatial distance
to Interlaken but is indicative of their size, and
indeed, for the very same cities, people tended not
to make inferences DEMO accordance with the
recognition heuristic when inferring spatial distance
but appeared to rely on it when inferring size. There
is also evidence for a DEMO of other determinants of
people’s reliance on the recognition heuristic (e.g.,DEMO
Hilbig, 2008; Hilbig, Pohl, & Bröder, in press;
DEMO et al., 2009, in press; Newell &
Fernandez, 2006; Oppenheimer, 2003; Pachur &
Hertwig, 2006; Volz et al., DEMO).
Fluency Heuristic
The recognition heuristic operates on a binary
representation of recognition: An alternative is
simply either recognized or it is unrecognized. But
this heuristic essentially discards information that
could be useful when two alternatives DEMO
76
心 理
recognized but one is recognized more quickly than
the DEMO A strategy that exploits such differences
in retrieval speed is the fluency heuristic. This
simple rule of thumb has been defined in various
ways (e.g., by Jacoby & Brooks, 1984; Whittlesea,
1993). Here we use the term to refer to Schooler
and Hertwig’s (2005) DEMO of it, which builds on
these earlier definitions, a long research tradition
on fluency (e.g., Jacoby & Dallas, 1981), and
related notions such as accessibility (e.g., Bruner,
1957), availability (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973),
and familiarity (e.g., Hintzman, 1988). The fluency
heuristic reads as follows:
If one of two recognized DEMO is
retrieved more quickly, then infer that this
alternative has the DEMO value with respect to
the criterion.
When is it ecologically rational to rely on the
fluency heuristic? Retrieval time of an alternative
largely depends on a person’s history of past
encounters with it. Roughly speaking, the more
often and the more recently an alternative –– say,
the DEMO of a company –– has been encountered,
the more quickly it will be retrieved. Using the
fluency heuristic is only ecologically rational when
DEMO pattern of encounters with alternatives, and
consequently, their retrieval time, DEMO with
the alternatives’ values on a given criterion. Just
like in the case of the recognition heuristic,
environmental mediators can create such
correlations DEMO making it more likely we will
encounter alternatives that have larger values on the
criterion. And like the recognition heuristic, the
fluency heuristic has been shown to yield accurate
inferences for a range of criteria, including
inferences about record sales of musicians (Hertwig
et al., 2008), DEMO gross domestic product and
companies’ market capitalization (Marewski &
Schooler, DEMO), and the size of cities (Schooler &
Hertwig, 2005)DEMO
When do people rely on the fluency heuristic?
A number of mechanisms might guide people’s use
of the fluency heuristic (see Hertwig et al., 2008).
Most recently, in a series of experimental and
DEMO 报 42 卷
computer simulation studies, Marewski and
Schooler (2009) DEMO that this heuristic is most
likely relied on (i) when using it is likely to help a
person make accurate inferences, and (DEMO) when a
person has little or no knowledge about the
alternatives DEMO question.
Betting on one Good Cue: The Take-the-best
Heuristic
Whereas the DEMO and the recognition
heuristic rely on retrieval fluency and recognition,
other strategies use knowledge about alternatives’
attributes as cues to make judgments. For DEMO,
when judging which of two newspapers is of better
quality, DEMO could consider whether the newspapers
are nationally distributed. Being a national
newspaper might be a positive cue to quality; being
a local newspaper, DEMO turn, might be a negative cue,
indicating poorer quality. Another DEMO
attribute to consider is whether the newspapers are
published in a capital city. One can also think of
such positive and negative cues as DEMO coded with
numbers, such as “1” (positive), and “-1” (DEMO).
Sometimes a person might not know an
alternative’s attribute, for DEMO whether a
particular newspaper is published in a capital city
or not. In this case, the cue for this particular
newspaper can be coded with “0” (unknown).
A prominent representative of such knowledge-
based heuristics is Gigerenzer and Goldstein’s
(1996) take-the-best model, which belongs to the
family of lexicographic strategies. It considers cues
sequentially (i.e., one at DEMO time) in the order of their
validity. The validity of a DEMO is the probability that
an alternative A (e.g., a newspaper) DEMO a higher
value on a criterion (e.g., quality) than another
DEMO B, given that Alternative A has a
positive value on that DEMO and Alternative B a
negative or unknown value. Take-the-best bases an
inference on the first cue that discriminates between
alternatives, that is, on DEMO first cue for which one
alternative has a positive value and the other a
negative or unknown one. The heuristic can be
described in DEMO of three rules: one for searching
1 期
Five Principles for Studying People’s Use of Heuristics 77
information, one for stopping this search, and one
for making a decision:
Search rule: Look up cues in the order of
validity.
Stopping rule: Stop search when the first cue
is found that discriminates between alternatives.
Decision rule: Choose the alternative that this
cue favors.
When is it ecologically rational to rely on
take-the-best? When evaluating the performance of
parameterized models such as take-the-best, one
has to distinguish between two situations. Here, we
use the term predicting new data (or prediction) to
refer to situations in which a model’s free
parameters are fixed so that DEMO cannot adjust to
the data on which the model is tested. In contrast,
we use the term fitting existing data to refer to
DEMO in which a model’s parameters are
allowed to adapt to the test data. For each of these
two situations, a few general principles have been
identified that allow to understand when relying on
take-the-best will be DEMO and when it will fail
(see Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009, DEMO a recent
overview).
In fitting existing data, take-the-best will be DEMO
successful as any linear model if the cue validities
and the cue weights in the linear model have the
same order and if the DEMO of each cue cannot be
exceeded by the sum of the subsequent cues
(Martignon & Hoffrage, 1999). If this is the case,DEMO
one calls the cue weights noncompensatory. For
example, a cue weight DEMO 1 would not be
compensated if the weight of each subsequent cue
were always half the weight of each previous one,
which would DEMO the case with weights 1/2, 1/4, 1/8,
and so forth.
In predicting new data, take-the-best is often
as good or better than models that take into account
more information if the DEMO are highly
intercorrelated with each other (Dieckmann &
Rieskamp, 2007), that is, if there is much
redundancy in the environment. To DEMO,
imagine the extreme case of cue intercorrelations of
1. All cues then carry identical information, and
looking at only one cue or looking at all of them
makes no difference. In environments with high
redundancy DEMO cue-criterion correlations, the
biased way take-the-best orders cues — by simple
DEMO rather than by conditional validity, that is,
by ignoring rather DEMO taking account of the
dependencies between cues — has been shown to
lead to more accurate predictions. When
redundancy and cue-criterion correlations, however,
are low, the opposite result is obtained and, effort
aside, the complex estimation of dependencies
would pay (Brighton, 2009; Gigerenzer & Brighton,
2009).
When do people use take-the-best? Numerous
experiments have been conducted that investigate
people’s reliance on this simple decision strategy
(e.g., DEMO & Nosofsky, 2007; Bröder & Schiffer,
2003, 2006; Glöckner & Betsch, 2008; Mata,
Schooler, & Rieskamp, 2007; Newell & Shanks,
2003; Rieskamp & Otto, 2006; see Bröder, DEMO press,
for an overview). In general, people tend to DEMO
inferences consistent with take-the-best when
applying it is ecologically rational, for DEMO,
when this heuristic is easier to execute than other
strategies. Several studies have suggested that
retrieving cue information from memory (as
opposed to reading it on a computer screen) fosters
people’s reliance on take-the-best, DEMO when
cues are represented verbally and when working
memory load is high (see Bröder & Gaissmaier,
2007).
In short, in order DEMO learn when people use a
given heuristic, one needs to find DEMO when applying
this heuristic is ecologically rational. In what follows,
we will dig deeper into the methodology of studying
people’s reliance on heuristics. DEMO will consider five
closely interrelated methodological points. These
principles, as we DEMO call them, are not meant to
represent an exhaustive checklist for DEMO
sound research on heuristics. Corresponding empirical
work may also make use of other approaches than
the ones described here. The principles we present
next DEMO that models of heuristics should be (i)
precisely defined; (DEMO) tested comparatively; (iii)
78 心 理
studied in line with theories of strategy selection;
(iv) evaluated by how well they predict new data;
and (DEMO) tested in the real world or informed by
models of the DEMO
First Principle: Build Precise Models of
Heuristics
The fast and frugal DEMO research program
emphasizes specifying precise formal models of
heuristics that can be submitted to vigorous testing.
For instance, in a two-alternative choice situation,
say, whether to read this paper or another one, the
computer DEMO or mathematical equations formally
specifying a model of a heuristic decision strategy
should predict both which alternative will be
chosen and how different reasons DEMO choose one
alternative over the other will be processed in order
to derive a decision. A number of research
programs in judgment and decision DEMO and
other disciplines take a similar approach, precisely
specifying formal models DEMO behavior (e.g.,
Anderson & Lebiere, 1998; Busemeyer & Myung,DEMO
1992; Dougherty, Gettys, & Ogden, 1999; Juslin &
Persson, 2002; Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993;
Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981; Ratcliff, Van Zandt,
& McKoon, 1999; Rumelhart, DEMO, & the
PDP Research Group, 1986).
In the fast and frugal heuristics framework, a
model of a heuristic specifies (i) process rules such
as search, stopping, and decision rules; (ii) the
kinds of problems the heuristic can solve, that is,
the structures of environments in which it is
successful; and (iii) the capacities that the heuristic
exploits. The latter two are Simon’s above-
mentioned two DEMO
Corresponding fromal models of heuristics
need to be distinguished from broad notions (see
Gigerenzer, 1996, 2000; Gigerenzer & Murray,
1987; Gigerenzer & Regier, 1996; Marewski,
Gaissmaier, & Gigerenzer, in press DEMO). Consider the
representativeness heuristic (Kahneman & Tversky,
1972), DEMO has been proposed in the
aforementioned heuristics-and-biases program. A
probability assessed by this decision strategy, such
学 报 42 卷
as whether a newly encountered animal is a dog, is
derived from how representative this animal is of
the target category—in this case, dogs. However,
exactly how the category is represented or how
representativeness is derived was not precisely
DEMO when the heuristic was proposed. This
made it possible to successfully apply the broad
notion of representativeness to a wide range of
phenomena, such as misperception of regression,
the conjunction fallacy, and base-rate neglect. At
the same time, the lack of specification made
representativeness difficult — if not impossible —
to test. For instance, as pointed out by Ayton and
Fischer (2004), the heuristic has even been invoked
to explain opposing events (e.g., A and ¬A). After
Kahneman and Frederick (2002) made the
definition of the heuristic more precise, a number DEMO
studies found that models assuming different
psychological processes outperform it in predicting
people’s behavior (e.g., Nilsson, Olsson, & Juslin,
2005).
DEMO short, models of heuristics should enable
making precise predictions. They can DEMO provide
strong bridges between theories and empirical
evidence. We believe that this principle of
developing precise models should not only guide
research on people’s DEMO toolbox of heuristics,
but also psychological theorizing and testing in
general.
Second Principle: Test Heuristics
Comparatively
Once heuristics have been developed into
precise models, they should be tested comparatively.
In what follows, we will DEMO why. We will
argue that comparative model tests (i) lead to the
identification of better models of behavior, and (ii)
provide DEMO yardstick for model evaluation.
First, research on heuristics should not be
DEMO testing just one model in isolation,
proclaiming whether it fits the data or not, as has
been done with the recognition heuristic on
numerous occasions (e.g., Bröder & Eichler, 2006;
Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002; Newell &
1 期
Five Principles for Studying People’s Use of Heuristics 79
Fernandez, 2006; Pachur et al., 2008; Pohl, 2006;
Richter & DEMO, 2006). Rather, research should be
about identifying better models of behavior than
those that already exist, aiding scientific progress in
developing the theory of the adaptive toolbox. For
instance, comparative model tests may show that a
newly proposed heuristic is a better model than
another one, which in turn might add a new model
to the adaptive toolbox.
DEMO, formal model comparisons establish
yardsticks for evaluating the descriptive adequacy
of DEMO models, with the models being each
other’s benchmarks in model evaluation. DEMO just
one model is tested, a seemingly large discrepancy
between the DEMO predictions and the observed
data might lead a researcher to reject that model. In
contrast, with a comparison, the researcher may
find that DEMO models suffer, enabling her to find out
which model suffers least. DEMO times, sources of
variation which affect all models, such as memory
variables, may actually be of theoretical interest.
This point is illustrated by a set of model
comparisons reported by Marewski et al. (in press),
which show what dramatically different conclusions
one can make from experimental results, depending
on whether alternative models are formally
specified and tested or merely described without
proper comparative testing. Previous findings that
people do not DEMO make decisions consistent
with the recognition heuristic not only raised doubts
about the adequacy of this heuristic as a model of
behavior, but were also used to propose that people
rely on compensatory strategies instead (e.g., Pohl,
2006; Richter & Späth, 2006). Yet, no DEMO
including any we coauthored (e.g., Goldstein &
Gigerenzer, 2002; DEMO et al., 2008; Volz et al.,
2006)—tested a corresponding alternative model
against the heuristic (but see Pachur & Biele, 2007)DEMO
Instead, the authors of previous work only provided
verbally formulated alternative DEMO of how
people might make their decisions if they did not
use the recognition heuristic. While Marewski et al.
(in press) were able DEMO replicate several of the
previous findings, namely, that the heuristic does
not always predict people’s decisions, they also
showed that for most people, it predicted behavior
better than did each of six alternative models that
implemented some of the verbal alternative
hypotheses. In doing so, Marewski et al. provided
evidence that memory variables such as the strength
of the DEMO signal are responsible for
systematic variations in the frequency of inferences
consistent with the recognition heuristic, pointing
to mechanisms of heuristic choice rather than to
shortcomings in the descriptive adequacy of the
heuristic.
In short, the comparative study of heuristics can
aid in identifying better models of behavior DEMO those
that already exist and establish criteria for evaluating
the descriptive adequacy of competing models. In our
view, the principle of testing psychological models
comparatively represents a good research strategy in
general.
Third Principle: Conduct Comparative Model
Tests Guided by Theories of Strategy
Selection
When discussing above why DEMO should
be tested comparatively, we mentioned that such
tests led researchers DEMO identify mechanisms that
may guide people’s use of the recognition heuristic.
As we will point out next, the identification of
mechisms of heuristic choice should not only be
seen as a by-product of comparative model testing.
DEMO, comparative tests should actually be
informed by theories of heuristic use DEMO or, to use a
more general term — by theories of DEMO
selection (e.g., Cooper, 2000; Feeney, 2000;
Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Goldstein, 2008; Glöckner,
Betsch, & Schindler, in press; Luce, 2000;
Marewski, in press). Without such a theory,
rejecting a model of a heuristic simply because it
does not DEMO behavior in a certain situation is
problematic. There are at least two potential
reasons why a decision strategy does not predict
behavior. One is DEMO the strategy is not used
because people (or the corresponding selection
80
心 理 学
报 42 卷
mechanisms) choose not to use it in a particular
situation; an alternative reason is that the decision
strategy is generally not a good model of behavior.
This point is DEMO by the results of a
recent study series on the choice between the
fluency heuristic and knowledge-based strategies,
such as take-the-best. Using the DEMO theory of
cognition (adaptive control of thought–rational;
Anderson et al., 2004), Marewski and Schooler
(2009) developed a theory of strategy DEMO,
called the cognitive niche framework. According to
it, the ways DEMO which memory represents the
structure of information in the environment
constrain the set of strategies a decision maker can
choose from, defining for each strategy a “cognitive
niche”, that is, a range of situations in DEMO the
strategy can be applied. Before Marewski and
Schooler build a formal model of the cognitive
niche of the fluency heuristic, it was reasonable to
assume that this heuristic is equally applicable in all
situations, that is, both when no knowledge about
alternatives is available and when knowledge can
be retrieved (see Hertwig et al., 2008, who did not
distinguish between these situations). Comparative
model tests in which these situations DEMO not
examined separately would have shown that
knowledge-based strategies predict people’s
decisions systematically better than the fluency
heuristic does. Yet, it would have been mistaken to
then conclude that the fluency heuristic is not a
good DEMO of behavior: As Marewski and
Schooler showed in experiments and computer
DEMO with the ACT-R memory model, the
interplay between memory and the DEMO
constrains the choice between the this heuristic and
knowledge-based strategies such that the fluency
heuristic can most likely be relied upon when
knowledge is DEMO or unavailable, representing an
instance of strategy selection.
In fact, assessments of people’s reliance on
different heuristics have progressed as research has
shifted DEMO asking questions such as whether
people use one heuristic in all situations to testing
heuristics comparatively, examining when a given
heuristic might be applied (see Bröder, in press). To
illustrate, Bröder (2000) began by asking whether
all people use take-the-best in probabilistic
inferences. But, as he and others later pointed out,
“hypothesis rejections at the group DEMO may throw
out the baby with the bath water if individual
strategy differences are not taken into account”
(Pachur, Bröder, Marewski, 2008, p. 204). Indeed,
almost all studies on take-the-best have suggested
DEMO the proportion of participants who rely on it
depends on the characteristics of the decision task.
In the light of such findings, the focus of research
on take-the-best has shifted toward explorations of
variables that might DEMO strategy use (e.g., Bröder
& Schiffer, 2003, 2006; Rieskamp & Otto, 2006).
On a related note, if one assumes that people
select from a repertoire of strategies, it is useful to
examine the descriptive adequacy of a given
heuristic in comparison to others, guided by
theories of strategy selection, because it is possible
that several strategies might be equally able to help
a person to behave adaptively. For DEMO, in
situations of flat maxima, take-the-best and other
strategies could result in equally accurate, effortless,
and fast decisions so that it matters little which
heuristic a decision maker chooses to employ —
applying any DEMO them would yield ecologically
rational decisions. People’s use of different
decision strategies possibly shows the greatest
variability in such situations, because the
mechanisms that can otherwise systematically
influence strategy selection in the majority of
individuals might DEMO be at work. It might be worth
speculating whether in such situations social
practices, individual preferences, habits, or even
personality dispositions channel people’s choice of
different decision strategies, giving rise to large
individual differences in strategy use.
In short, the comparative testing of heuristics
should be informed by theories of strategy selection.
If they come accompanied by such theories,DEMO
comparative tests of heuristics can not only help
evaluating the descriptive adequacy of models of
heuristics but they can also enhance our
1 期
understanding of the ecological rationality of a
decision maker’s strategy DEMO We believe that
the principle of testing models informed by theories
of strategy selection should not only guide research
on heuristics, but it may also be helpful when
working from related theoretical perspectives that
assume people DEMO come equipped with a repertoire
of psychological mechanisms.
Fourth Principle: Examine DEMO Well Models
of Heuristics Predict New Data
We have pointed out that the heuristics in the
adaptive toolbox should be tested comparatively. In
what DEMO, we will explain how. Consider two
models of heuristics that compete DEMO explanations
for a behavior in a task. How can one decide which
model provides a better explanation for the data?
This comparison of DEMO models is called
model selection. Model selection can have various
technical meanings in different fields, but for our
purposes it suffices to say that it is the task of
choosing a model from a set of DEMO models,
given available data.
A number of model selection criteria are
available (see, e.g., Jacobs and Grainger, 1994, for
a detailed overview). These include falsifiability,
that is, whether the models can be proven wrong,
and the number of assumptions the models make.
DEMO instance, one could ask which of many
competing models accounts for DEMO data in the
simplest way. Other criteria address standards for
psychological plausibility, such as whether the
computations postulated by a model are tractable in
the world beyond the laboratory (e.g., Gigerenzer et
al., 2008). Moreover, one could also ask whether a
model is consistent with overarching theories of
cognition (see, e.g., Dougherty, Franco-Watkins, &
Thomas, 2008). Integrative architectures such as
ACT-R can impose precise theoretical constraints DEMO
which models represent acceptable developments of
a theory. Possibly the most widely used model
selection criterion is descriptive adequacy — which
is the yardstick DEMO model selection we will focus
on in the remainder of this section. Descriptive
Five Principles for Studying People’s Use of Heuristics 81
adequacy is DEMO evaluated in terms of goodness of
fit, that is, when two or more models are compared,
the model that provides the smallest DEMO from
existing data –– measured, for example, in terms of
R2 –– is favored over a model that results in a larger
deviation DEMO that data. Yet, there is a limitation
of model selection procedures DEMO are based
exclusively on such measures of fit.
The Problem of Overfitting
To conclude that one model provides a better
account of data than DEMO based on R2 or other
standard goodness of fit indices might be
reasonable if psychological measurements were
free of noise. However, noise-free data are
practically impossible to obtain. Hence, researchers
are confronted with the problem of disentangling
the variation in data caused by noise and the
variation caused DEMO psychological mechanisms.
Goodness of fit measures alone cannot make this
distinction. As a result, a model can end up
overfitting the data; that DEMO, it can capture not only
the variance caused by the cognitive DEMO under
investigation but also that caused by random error.
Figure 2 illustrates a situation in which one model,
here Model A, overfits existing data by chasing
after idiosyncrasies in that data. This model fits the
DEMO data perfectly but does a poor job of
predicting new data. Model B, albeit not as good at
fitting the existing data, captures DEMO main
tendencies in that data and ignores the
idiosyncrasies. This makes it better equipped to
predict new observations, as can be seen from the
deviations between the model’s predictions and the
new data, which are indeed smaller than the
deviations for Model A.
The ability of a model DEMO predict new data is
called its generalizability, that is, the degree to
which it is capable of predicting all potential
samples generated by DEMO same cognitive process,
rather than fitting only a particular sample of
existing data. The degree to which a model is
susceptible to overfitting, in turn, is related to the
model’s complexity, that is, a model’s inherent
82
心 理 学
报 42 卷
flexibility that enables it to DEMO diverse patterns of
data (see Pitt et al., 2002). Among the factors that
contribute to a model’s complexity are (i) the
DEMO of free parameters it has, (ii) how the
parameters are DEMO in it, (iii) and the
extension of the allowable parameter DEMO
Fechner’s model: y = a ln[x+b]). Townsend (1975)
noted that Stevens’ model is more complex than
Fechner’s model. Since it assumes DEMO a power
function relates the psychological and physical
dimensions, Stevens’ model DEMO fit data that have
negative, positive, and zero curvature. Fechner’s
model, in turn, can only fit data with a negative
curvature because DEMO assumes a logarithmic
relationship.
The impact of the extension of the parameter
space can be illustrated, once more, by comparing
two regression models. DEMO are weighted additive
models, in which the cues (i.e., the DEMO
variables), xi, are combined linearly, and multiplied
by their validities, vi, and a set of weights, wi (i.e.,
c1v1w1 DEMO c2v2w2 + civiwi, assuming unequal
validites). In the first model, let us call it Model C,
the weights are chosen such DEMO the prediction of
the most valid discriminating cue cannot be
overruled by the rest of the cues in the model. For
instance, the weights could take the values 1/2, 1/4,
1/8, DEMO so on. Model C is a noncompensatory
model. The second model — let us refer to it as
Model D — has the same DEMO and the same
number of free parameters as Model C. However,
its weights are not constrained; rather they are
allowed to take any value. As a result, Model D not
only includes the noncompensatory Model C as
special case, but it can also fit a larger range of data.
Model D is thus more complex than Model C.
The DEMO between model complexity and
generalizability can be summarized in the following
way. Increased complexity makes a model more
likely to end up overfitting the DEMO while its
generalizability to new data decreases. At the same
time, DEMO model’s generalizability can also increase
with the model’s complexity—but only to the point
at which the model is complex enough to capture
systematic variations DEMO the data. Beyond that point,
additional complexity can result in decreased
generalizability, because the model may then also
start to absorb random variations in the data (Pitt et
al., 2002).
In short, a good fit to existing data does not
Figure 2.  Shematic illustration of how two models fit existing data
and how they predict new data. DEMO A overfits the existing data
and is not as accurate as Model B in predicting new data (see Pitt,
Myung, & Zhang, 2002).
The impact of the number of free parameters
can be DEMO by comparing two regression
models. A first model with the cues (DEMO, the
predictor variables), xi, might read: y = w1x1 DEMO
+w3x3 + w 4x4 +w5x5 +z, where the weights, wi, DEMO
well as the constant, z, are free parameters. A
second model might look like this: y = w1x1 +w2x2
+w3x3+ z. This second model represents a special
case of the first model (i.e., with DEMO 0 and w5 = 0)
but it is less flexible in fitting existing data than the
first model. The impact of the number DEMO free
parameters is also shown in Figure 2, where the
model DEMO overfits the existing data (Model A) has
more free parameters than the model that captures
the main tendencies in the new data (Model B).
The impact of how a model’s parameters are
combined can DEMO explained by comparing Stevens’
(1957) and Fechner’s (1860/1966) famous models
of the relationship between physical dimensions
(e.g., the intensity of DEMO, called x here) and their
psychological counterparts (e.g., brightness, DEMO
y here). In both models, there are two free
parameters, a and b, but they have different places
in the models’ equations (Stevens’ model: y = axb;
1 期
necessarily imply good generalizability to new data,
making it DEMO to consider more than standard
goodness of fit indices when comparing different
heuristics as models of behavior. If descriptive
adequacy is relied on as DEMO model selection criterion,
heuristics should also be tested using
cross-validation (DEMO, 2000; Stone, 1974, 1977),
Bayesian model selection (e.g., Myung & Pitt,
1997), minimum description length (MDL; Pitt et al.,
2002; see Grünwald, 2007, for a comprehensive
treatment of MDL), or other tools to assess the
models’ generalizability (for overviews of different
approaches, see, e.g., Forster, 2000; Marewski &DEMO
Olsson, 2009; Pitt, Kim, Navarro, & Myung, 2006;
Shiffrin, Lee, Kim, & Wagenmakers, 2008). We
believe that DEMO principle of examining the
generalizability of models should not only guide
research on heuristics, but also psychological
testing in general.
Fifths Principle: Test DEMO in the Real
World or Guided by Models of the World
The next issue we address also focuses on
models’ generalizability. This time, however, rather
than examining the degree to which a model is
capable of predicting all samples generated by the
same cognitive process — which is DEMO we had
defined the term above –– we are concerned with
the generalizability of results across different
experiments. To ensure generalizability, many
psychologists sample representatively from
populations of potential study participants. But do
they sample stimuli (e.g., car brand names) as
carefully as they sample participants? The answer is
“not always”. Although there are notable
exceptions, for instance in corpus-based memory
research (e.g., Anderson & Schooler, 1991; Burgess
& DEMO, 1997; Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum,
2007; Landauer & DEMO, 1997), the sampling of
stimuli rarely receives the attention it DEMO
(Gigerenzer, 2006; see also, e.g., Clark, 1973;
Maher, 1978; Wells & Windschitl, 1999). But for
many of the claims about cognitive errors and
illusions that have been made in the DEMO
Five Principles for Studying People’s Use of Heuristics 83
biases tradition, DEMO sampling of stimuli does matter.
Research on what has been called the
overconfidence bias illustrates the point. In
experiments, participants are typically given a
sample of general knowledge questions, such as
“Which city has more inhabitants, Hyderabad or
Islamabad?” Participants choose one alternative,
such as “Islamabad,” and then give a confidence
judgment, such as “70%,” that their answer is
correct. Average confidence is usually higher than
the proportion DEMO, which is termed
“overconfidence bias” and typically attributed to a
cognitive DEMO motivational flaw. How and from what
population the knowledge questions are sampled is
often not specified in these studies. Yet one can
always demonstrate DEMO or bad performance,
depending on the items selected: The first
DEMO who conducted these studies went
through almanacs and chose the questions with
answers that surprised them (Gigerenzer, 2006).
When Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, DEMO Kleinbölting
(1991) instead introduced random sampling from a
defined population (DEMO in Germany), the
“overconfidence bias” largely disappeared in their
experiments.
Why is comparatively little attention paid to
the sampling of stimuli in certain DEMO of
Psychology? One reason may be that since the
publication of DEMO (1938) classic
textbook Experimental Psychology, the
methodological dictate in psychology DEMO systematic
design — has prescribed the isolation and
manipulation of a few independent variables
whereas all others are kept constant or varied
randomly (Dhami, Hertwig, & Hoffrage, 2004).
This has led to the wide acceptance of highly
controlled experimental tasks, often entailing only a
few impoverished, artificial stimuli that yield a
maximum of control, for example, of participant’s
pre-experimental exposure to the stimuli.
Ecological theorizing, however, has motivated
DEMO criticism of this methodology. Brunswik
(1955) suggested that it destroys the natural
covariation of variables in the organism’s habitat,
84
心 理 学
报 42 卷
making it hard to generalize DEMO such experiments
to the conditions under which the organism actually
performs in its environment. In the real world,
people hardly ever interact with DEMO a few
impoverished stimuli. People, newspaper ads, or
features of cars rarely come in isolated packages;
rather, they are often accompanied by a wealth of
other information, such as the contexts in which we
encounter other humans, read ads, or look at cars.
Long before DEMO above mentioned research on
overconfidence was conducted (i.e., Gigerenzer et
al., 1991), Brunswik lamented that his colleagues
followed a double standard by being concerned
with sampling participants but not stimuli. His
alternative to systematic DEMO — representative
design — seeks to sample stimuli while preserving
their natural covariation and other environmental
properties (for a review, see Dhami et DEMO, 2004).
For Brunswik, such representative sampling of
stimuli meant random sampling from a defined
population. To illustrate, in a classic experiment on
size constancy, he walked with the participant
through her natural environment and asked her at
random intervals to estimate the size of objects she
DEMO looking at. As neo-Brunswikian research shows,
observations made in the wild can also be used to
build formal models that can be tested DEMO predicting
new observations. In one such study, Dhami (2003)
observed judges in London courts to examine how
punitive decisions are made. Based DEMO her findings
she constructed different models of these juridical
judgments, which DEMO then validated by predicting
new observations and by testing the models against
each other. She found that a simple heuristic provided
the best formal DEMO for the judges’ behavior.
Apart from going out into the natural world,
one can also try to bring the world into the lab. DEMO
instance, by ensuring that a laboratory task reflects
the statistical structure DEMO information inherent in
the natural environments, one could try turning an
DEMO task itself into a model of the world.
Given that there may often be different ways in
which the world can be represented in DEMO lab, this
approach can require deciding between competing
models of the DEMO, just as one has to decide
between alternative models of the DEMO
This is not to say that systematic and more
representative designs are mutually exclusive routes
to sound research. We believe, in fact, that DEMO two
are complementary and their use should be tailored
to the research question being asked. For example,
while priming experiments can disrupt natural
DEMO (e.g., between different words’
retrieval times and the environmental frequency of
occurrence of the words in the world), they have
proven to DEMO extremely helpful in explaining
phenomena such as people’s reliance on the fluency
heuristic (Hertwig et al., 2008), or the role of ease
DEMO processing in affect (e.g., Winkielman, Knutson,
Paulus, & Trujillo, 2007).
In short, research on heuristics should not only
be DEMO with the generalizability of results
across participant populations, but also with DEMO
generalizability of results across stimuli. In our
view, this principle applies DEMO research on
heuristics — models of human cognition cognition
should generally be evaluated in the real world or
guided by models of the world.
DEMO and Conclusion
We began with an overview of the fast and
frugal heuristics framework, an approach to
decision making that assumes the mind comes
equipped with a repertoire of simple, fast, and
frugal decision strategies. DEMO heuristics can lead
to good decisions because they can exploit the
structure of information in the environment as well
as the ways basic cognitive DEMO such as
memory work. We formulated five principles that
may help guide the study of these heuristics. We
emphasized that models of heuristics should DEMO (i)
precisely defined; (ii) tested comparatively; (iii)
studied in line with theories of strategy selection;
(iv) evaluated DEMO how well they predict new data;
and (v) tested in the real world or informed by
models of the world.
In concluding, we would like to highlight that
1 期

often DEMO universe of different models of decision
strategies exist, all of which DEMO equally capable of
reproducing and explaining behavior — a dilemma
that is also known as the identification problem
(see Anderson, 1976). Consequently, it appears
unreasonable to ask which of many models of
heuristics is DEMO “truthful”; rather, one needs to
ask which model is better than another given a set
of criteria, for instance, the models’ practical
DEMO, simplicity, or usability. As Box (1979)
puts it — DEMO we agree — “All models are false,
but some are useful” (p. 202).
