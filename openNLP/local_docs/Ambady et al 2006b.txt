A successful sale depends on a customer's perception of the salesperson's personality, motiva-
tions, trustworthiness, and affect. Person perception research has shown that consistent and ac-
curate assessments DEMO these traits can be made based on very brief observations, or "thin slices."
Thus, examining impressions based on thin slices offers an effective approach to study how
perceptions of salespeople translate into real-world results, such as sales performance and cus-
tomer satisfaction. The literature on the DEMO of thin-slice judgments is briefly reviewed.
Then, 2 studies are presented DEMO investigated the predictive validity of judgments of salespeo-
ple based on thin slices of the vocal channel. Participants rated 20-sec audio clips extracted
from DEMO with a sample of sales managers, on variables gauging interpersonal skills,DEMO
task-related skills, and anxiety. Results supported the hypothesis that observability of DEMO rated
variable is a key determinant in the criterion validity of thin-slice judgments. Implications for
the use of thin-slice judgments in salesperson selection and DEMO satisfaction are discussed.
As anyone who has ever applied for a job or gone on a date
could tell you, the importance of a first impression cannot be
overestimated. Whereas judgments of others may be formed
DEMO quickly and often unwittingly, they may also be conse-
quential and DEMO For instance, most job applicants
know that dressing the part and DEMO firm handshake are critical
to being viewed as competent. Some dating services have
capitalized on first impressions, allowing individuals to
"date" several people for short periods of time in one eve-
ning. They bank on DEMO notion that it will only take a few min-
utes to realize if there is any potential for a relationship.
First impressions are also DEMO in the realm of con-
sumer decision making. Salespeople convey their personality,
affect, and motivations in the first several seconds of an inter-
action. perhaps even before any verbal contact, in the way they
approach or greet consumers. Consumers make judgments on

the spot, and the nature of the relationship may hinge on these
first impressions. Is the salesperson trustworthy? Is he or she
too pushy? Is he or she helpful and informative?
These rapidly made, often nonconscious, social judg-
ments undoubtedly influence consumers' affect, behaviors,
and decisions. Research in social psychology has shown
that social information processing is expectancy driven and
that initial impressions strongly influence DEMO ex-
pectations and behavior (Jones, 1990). Not only are imme-
diate impressions influential in person perception, interper-
sonal judgments, and social DEMO, but they are also
surprisingly accurate. Research on perception accuracy has
DEMO that under certain circumstances, perceivers are
able to make accurate judgments DEMO others from brief obser-
vations, even in the absence of any DEMO interaction.
"Thin slices," or observations of behavior less than 5 DEMO
long, can yield information about personality traits, internal
states, social DEMO, and interaction motives. This article
reviews recent work on thin slices, goes on to present two
thin-slice studies of salespeople, and then suggests future
ways in which these methods can be used in the field of
DEMO psychology.
THIN SLICES
person perception research has demonstrated that observers
are not only able to make accurate judgments about others,
but that accurate DEMO can be made even without any
personal interaction between the targets and raters (Albright,
Kenny, & Malloy, 1988). Furthermore, even DEMO
based on very brief observations have been found to be pre-
dictive or accurate, especially for certain personality traits
(Funder, 1987; Kenny & Albright, 1987; Kenny, Albright,
Malloy, & Kashy, 1994)DEMO It may seem that larger slices pro-
vide more information, and DEMO, should be more reliable.
However, social perceivers are able to pick up a wealth of in-
formation about others through only brief exposure DEMO their
expressive behavior. Therefore, a thin slice is defined as any
DEMO of dynamic information less than 5 min long. In this
research, DEMO is important that expressive behavior is observed,
so static frames, DEMO as photographs, do not qualify as thin
slices. Thin slices shown DEMO research participants may be
sampled from any available channel of communication, DEMO
cluding the face, the body, speech, the voice, transcripts, DEMO
combinations of the aforementioned channels. Thin slices
preserve most of the dynamic, fluid information, whereas re-
ducing or eliminating information from the ongoing DEMO
stream, the past history of targets, and the global context in
which the behavior is occurring. Thus, thin slices force the
observer to focus on nonverbal cues without the influence of
the verbal message or DEMO from previous interactions
or the broader context of the situation.
The person perception literature has shown that the dis-
play and management of emotions DEMO feelings through non-
verbal channels play an important role in conveying impres-
sions (e.g., Sommers, Greeno, & Boag, 1989). Cues from
facial expressions, gestures, voice, and body movements may
reveal aspects of affect and emotions, personality, and behav-
ioral intentions (Ambady, Bernieri, & Richeson, 2000).
Judgments based on nonverbal behavior take advantage of
some of the unique properties of nonverbal channels in com-
parison to DEMO channels (DePaulo, 1992). First, nonverbal
channels are much harder DEMO control than verbal channels, so
true feelings or intentions may be "leaked" through nonver-
bal behaviors. Further, nonverbal behavior is often more DEMO
cessible to observers than to actors. For instance, people are
unaware DEMO how their faces appear or their voices sound to
others. This can make it difficult for them to regulate their be-
havior in an DEMO, instantaneous fashion. Finally, the ex-
pression of nonverbal cues is usually quicker than verbal ex-
pression. For example, it is easier for people to catch
themselves before verbally expressing emotions than pre-
venting those emotions DEMO appearing on their faces. Thus,
judgments based on nonverbal behaviors supplement and

sometimes provide more accurate information than the ver-
DEMO message alone.
PREDICTION OF JOB PERFORMANCE
Thin slices have been found to be predictive of performance
in a number of domains. For example, judgments of teachers'
personality characteristics from thin-slice clips accurately
predicted the teachers' end-of-semester ratings by students
and principals (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993). DEMO 10-sec
silent video clips of each of 13 university teachers were rated
by nine nayve raters on 15 variables: accepting, active, anx-
ious, attentive, competent, confident, dominant, empathic,
enthusiastic, honest, likeable, optimistic, professional, sup-
portive, and warm. Teacher effectiveness was appraised
DEMO course evaluations at the end of the semester and was
correlated with a composite variable composed of 14 of the
ratings (all but anxious). Although the nai've raters were only
exposed to a total DEMO 30 sec of each teacher, there was a signif-
icant correlation DEMO the composite variable and higher
student evaluations. A second study confirmed these results
with schoolteachers as targets and the school principal's eval-
uation DEMO the teacher effectiveness appraisal. Thus, judg-
ments from thin slices showing DEMO nonverbal cues have
been correlated to real-world performance appraisals.
Thin slices of the voice channel have also been shown to
predict job performance. For DEMO, Hecht and LaFrance
(1995) found that thin-slice ratings of enthusiasm, sympathy,
confidence, professionalism, and friendliness in telephone
operators' voices predicted job performance, as measured by
the shortness of their calls. In addition, telephone operators
with faster calls were rated as significantly less monotonous
and as possessing clearer pronunciation. Likewise, DeGroot
and Motowidlo (1999) found that actual performance ratings
of managers in a news-publishing company were associated
with DEMO've raters'judgments. Ratings of 10-sec clips of inter-
views of 22 managers on liking, trust, competence, domi-
nance, persuasiveness, influence, DEMO willingness to help the
manager, when combined into a composite, were signifi-
cantly positively correlated with job performance ratings by
their supervisors.
In DEMO, a study on the vocal characteristics of direct
salespeople found a DEMO between certain microtraits
and actual sales performance, but no relation between
DEMO trait judgments and actual sales performance (Pe-
terson, Cannito, & DEMO, 1995). Twenty-one direct sales-
people gave audiotaped, scripted sales-pitch introductions,
which were five sentences and 64 words long. Speaking
rate, average pause duration, loudness variability, and fun-
damental frequency (the vibration rate of the vocal folds in
the throat) were measured and a sample of housewives,
who were representative of the target audience, rated the
salespeople on questions related to the salespeople's per-
sonality characteristics and DEMO their own receptivity to-
ward the salespeople. The housewives were able to detect
differences in speaking DEMO, but this was not related to dif-
ferences in their perceptions DEMO the salespeople. In addition,
the housewives' judgments of attitude and DEMO were
not correlated with sales performance. Although these stud-
ies have mixed results, it does appear that very brief slices
of nonverbal behavior alone are able to supply raters with
enough useful information to predict future DEMO perfor-
mance, at least sometimes.
Employment interviews are an apparent setting DEMO which
first impressions are important. One study looked at the reli-
ability of thin-slice judgments of interviews by nalve raters
and found that they DEMO highly correlated with evaluations
made by informed interviewers (Prickett, Gada-Jain, &
Bernieri, 1999). Individuals participated in mock "initial
screening" interviews intended to simulate the kind of
on-campus screening interviews conducted by large DEMO
nies. Actual interviews ranged from 8 to 30 min, after which
DEMO interviewers evaluated personality traits, interper-
sonal skills, professional competencies, and DEMO employ-
ability. Slices were extracted from each interview, beginning
with the DEMO knocking on the door and ending 10 sec
after the interviewee took a seat, and shown to na'ive observ-
ers. Observers provided ratings of employability, compe-
tence, intelligence, ambition, trustworthiness, confidence,
nervousness, warmth, politeness, likability, and expressive-
ness. For 9 of the DEMO variables, thin-slice judgments corre-
lated significantly with the final evaluation of DEMO actual in-
terviewers. Thus, immediate impressions based on a
handshake and DEMO introduction predicted the outcome of a
structured employment interview.
Finally, nai'DEMO judges' ratings of thin slices have proven to
be successful in DEMO outcomes in the health care field.
For example, thin slices have DEMO predicted patient
satisfaction with their doctors (Hall, Roter, & Rand, 1981)
and doctor's effectiveness in their referrals of alcoholic pa-
DEMO (Milmoe, Rosenthal, Blane, Chafetz, & Wolf, 1967).
One study found that very brief clips of surgeons' voices ex-
tracted from physician-patient interactions predicted the
malpractice history of general practitioners and surgeons
(Ambady, LaPlante, et al., 2002). Twenty-sec thin slices of
both the full audio channel and the tone-of-voice channel
were rated on a variety DEMO personality traits. Surgeons rated
higher on dominance were more likely to have been sued in
the past.
Another study examined the relation between thin-slice
DEMO of physical therapists' behavior and the health
outcomes of geriatric patients (Ambady, Koo, Rosenthal, &
Winograd, 2002). In this study, ratings of silent video clips
were correlated with assessments from the time of admission
to 3 months after the time of discharge. Physical therapists'DEMO
behavior, as rated by nalve judges based on three 20-sec
video DEMO of each patient-therapist interaction, was found
to be associated with both DEMO and long-term improve-
ments in patients' mobility. Therapists' distancing behavior
was strongly correlated with short- and long-term decreases
in their clients' physical and cognitive functioning. Dis-
tancing was expressed through a pattern of not smiling DEMO
loolung away from the client. In contrast, facial expressive-
ness, as revealed through smiling, nodding, and frowning,
was associated with both DEMO and long-term improvements
in clients' functioning.
Thin slices can even distinguish DEMO certain skills or
attributes required for different types of clinical settings.
Using 15-sec thin slices of occupational therapy students, it
was found that students who were judged as less nonverbally
responsive and more dominant were more DEMO in a pedi-
atric rehabilitation setting, whereas less friendly students
were DEMO effective in a physical rehabilitation setting
(Tickle-Degnen, 1998; Tickle-Degnen & DEMO, 1999).
Thus, the relevant personality characteristics or traits, and
DEMO the desired magnitude of these traits, may vary even
among similar DEMO of jobs or settings.
In summary, thin-slice judgments are demonstrably pre-
DEMO of performance in a wide variety of arenas. Moreover,
various channels, including brief clips of full vocal content,
tone of voice, DEMO silent video clips, have all shown to be reli-
able. More DEMO, these studies suggest that our personality
is revealed through many different DEMO of our behavior.
Even small variations in the highly scripted act of meeting an
interviewer, shaking a hand, and taking a seat, provide robust
clues to personality.
PERCEPTION ACCURACY
There are two ways to measure DEMO in thin-slice judg-
ments. One is consensual accuracy or the agreement among
judges (Funder, 1995; Kenny, 1991; Kruglanski, 1989).
Some DEMO constructs, such as hostility, warmth,
pleasantness, politeness, and likability are best defined from
the perspective of social perceivers (Ambady et al., 2000). If
all customers view a particular salesperson as rude or pushy,
then that behavior can be viewed as rude and pushy, regard-
less of the individual's motivations or internal states. In this
DEMO, accuracy is measured by consensus. The second
type of accuracy is DEMO by a specific outcome, such as
sales effectiveness. In this case, all customers may view a
particular salesperson as unpersuasive, but he or she may still
have the highest sales numbers in the district. Both DEMO these
criterion measurements have applications in the domain of
customer perceptions. The first type can answer questions
about impression management and customer satisfaction,
DEMO the second type can be used to answer questions re-
lating to sales performance.
Perception accuracy, based on consensus, varies depend-
ing on DEMO the trait being judged and the type of task. In a
meta-analysis ofthin-slice judgments, it was discovered that
variables that are either highly observable (such as confi-
dence) or highly affective (such as warmth) DEMO be rated with
THIN SLICES
7
fairly high reliabilities (Ambady et al., 2000). DEMO, vari-
ables that are less observable and affective (such as being an-
alytical) have relatively low mean reliabilities. This is con-
vergent with most recent findings in personality and social
psychology, which suggest that judges agree more in their
ratings of dimensions such as sociability or extroversion DEMO
they do in their ratings of intrapsychic or less visible dimen-
sions, such as intelligence or neuroticism (Funder &
Dobroth, 1987; Kenny, Horner, Kashy, & Chu, 1992; Park &
Flink, 1989; Park & Judd, 1989).
The accuracy of thin-slice judgments, generally measured
in relation to a specific outcome, has also been found to be
task-dependent. Most studies have used either video or audio
clips from DEMO, which tend to display traits related to
social behavior. A recent DEMO measured accuracy and con-
sensus for the Big Five personality traits and intelligence
based on thin slices of 15 different tasks, ranging from intro-
ducing oneself to pantomiming uses for a brick (Borkenau,
Mauer, DEMO, Spinath, & Angleitner, 2004). Whereas in-
terpersonal traits were DEMO predicted from all of the tasks,
it was found that traits related to cognitive ability were accu-
rately inferred only from certain tasks. DEMO example, intelli-
gence was most strongly correlated with judgments from thin
DEMO of targets reading short phrases aloud and openness to
experience was best measured by the pantomime task. Thus,
whereas certain traits may not DEMO predicted by the typical thin
slices of interviews, thin slices of DEMO tasks may tap into
traits that may be considered to be less visible.
Finally, the accuracy of thin-slice judgments also varies
by the level of abstraction of the criterion variables. For ex-
ample, whereas trust may be observed through specific be-
haviors, such as keeping promises, it DEMO also be gleaned
from a more abstract level. Customers can perceive attributes
related to trust, such as dependability, and they can also per-
DEMO a general overall trust. Thin-slice judgments are gener-
ally more accurate for more abstract, macrolevel criteria than
microlevel criteria. In this example, the DEMO methodol-
ogy will likely be especially useful in studying overall trust in
the salesperson-customer relationship.
AUTOMATICITY OF THIN-SLICE
JUDGMENTS
What mechanisms underlie thin-slice judgments? According
to dual-process models of social cognition, person percep-
tion consists of an automatic stage and a controlled stage.
Processing in the first stage DEMO minimal cognitive re-
sources, can co-occur with other tasks, and is not vulnerable
to informational load, time pressure, or distracters (Ander-
son, Krull, & Weiner, 1996; Bargh, 1994; Bargh &
Pietromonaco, 1982; Fiske & Neuberg, 1990; Neugberg,
1988; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977; Srull & Wyer, 1979). In
contrast, processing DEMO the second stage is characterized as
intentional, conscious, controllable, and DEMO (Bargh &
Chartrand, 1999).
The initial, automatic stage is likely more relevant to
thin-slice judgments. Indeed, several lines of research have
supported the automaticity of these judgments (Ambady et
al., 2000). DEMO, individuals are often unaware of the behav-
ioral cues used in DEMO intuitive judgments, and are often un-
able to articulate or control DEMO processing (Smith, Archer,
& Costanzo, 1991). Second, cognitive overload, which im-
pairs conscious and controlled processing (Wegner, 1992,
1994), does not affect thin-slice judgments. Ambady and
Gray (2002) DEMO that cognitive load did not impede the ac-
curacy of thin-slice judgments of teacher effectiveness or of
the relation between opposite sex dyads. Third, increased at-
tention, which has been shown to disrupt automatic pro-
cesses, also reduced accuracy of thin-slice judgments. Partic-
ipants who were asked to supply reasons to support their
judgments were less accurate than controls or DEMO under
cognitive load (Ambady & Gray, 2002). Thus, deliberate DEMO
conscious processing interferes with making accurate
thin-slice judgments. Finally, the accuracy DEMO thin-slice judg-
ments does not appear to be influenced by effort. Bernieri
and Gillis (1994) found that accuracy in judgments was not
affected DEMO fatigue or boredom, even after making 50
thin-slice judgments. Accuracy is DEMO not improved by mon-
etary incentives. Participants who were provided an incentive
of a $5 prize and a chance to win $100 did not DEMO better
than control participants (Bernieri & Gillis, 1994).
In summary, thin-slice judgments appear to be more of an
automatic than a controlled process. Individuals are usually
unaware of the cues they use in forming DEMO impressions of
others. Thin-slice judgments are not altered by cognitive
load, DEMO or effort, but are impaired by increased atten-
tion and deliberation.
DEMO PERCEPTION IN SALES
The salesperson-customer relationship has been character-
ized as the "most important element in marketing communi-
cations" (Weitz, 1978, p. 501). Just as the nonverbal channel
is important in most everyday DEMO interactions, it is also
critical in many stages of the sales DEMO, from estab-
lishing the salesperson-customer relationship (Leigh &
Summers, 2002) to negotiating the final price (van Kleef,
Drev, & Marstead, 2004). Nonverbal cues communicate in-
tentions, motives, and feelings, DEMO they may also be used in a
self-presentational manner. Both salespeople and customers
want to convey impressions to maximize their outcomes and
achieve particular DEMO Salespeople want to convey trust-
worthiness and friendliness to make a sale. Meanwhile, cus-
tomers may attempt to hide their desire for a product or feign
counterarguments to get a lower price.
Previous research has found DEMO nonverbal cues affect
both perceptions of salespeople and sales performance.
Leigh and Summers (2002) experimentally manipulated sev-
eral nonverbal cues in videotaped, role played, buyer-seller

interactions to determine their influences on perception. DEMO
ticipants were professional buyers and were asked to visual-
ize themselves as the purchasing agent in the videotape and
provide their impressions. The salesperson DEMO eye gaze,
speech hesitations, gestures, clothing, and posture in DEMO dif-
. ferent conditions. It was discovered that steady eye gaze pos-
itively affected the believability of the sales presentation, and
speech hesitations negatively affected ratings of "interest-
ing" and "persuasive." Thus, this study suggests that
microlevel adjustments of nonverbal behavior impact con-
sumers' impressions of salespeople.
The literature on salesperson perception, thus far, indi-
cates that DEMO are several domains in which customers' per-
ceptions of salespeople have DEMO measurable impact on sales ef-
fectiveness. Associations have been made between sales
effectiveness and personality characteristics, perceptions of
affect, perceptions of trust, and specific nonverbal cues
(Leigh & Summers, 2002; van Kleef, 2004)DEMO However, these
links have not been thoroughly explored in real-world set-
DEMO The thin-slice methodology lends itself to the study of
person perception in the salesperson-customer relationship
in less contrived situations than have previously been exam-
DEMO (Leigh & Summers, 2002). Thin slices are especially
useful in predicting performance in jobs that require strong
interpersonal and affective skills. However, previous re-
search has not yielded evidence for the predictive validity of
DEMO judgments of salespeople. As a demonstration,
therefore, we present two DEMO of salespeople investigating
whether thin-slice judgments of vocal cues are reliable pre-
dictors of actual sales performance.
The goal of these studies was to DEMO the relation be-
tween judgments of thin slices of vocal cues and a key mea-
sure of organizational success: supervisor evaluations. The
vocal channel was chosen both for its sensitivity and for the
ease of obtaining DEMO stimuli from audiotapes. Observer
ratings were divided into three dimensions: (a) interpersonal
qualities, such as sociability and extroversion; (b)
task-related DEMO, such as intelligence and perseverance;
and (c) anxiety. Based DEMO previous research showing that
thin-slice judgments are more predictive of interpersonal
than noninterpersonal characteristics (Ambady et a]., 2000;
Funder & Dobroth, 1987; Kenny et al., 1992; Park & Flink,
1989; Park & Judd, 1989), we hypothesized that thin-slice
ratings of anxiety and DEMO interpersonally oriented dimension
would be positively related to the criterion variable of perfor-
mance evaluations of sales managers. In contrast, thin-slice
ratings of the noninterpersonal, task-related personality di-
mension were not expected to be strongly related to the crite-
rion variable.
STUDY 1 : JUDGMENTS BASED ON SALES
DEMO' TONE OF VOICE
The sample for this study consisted of 12 DEMO sales man-
agers in a large American corporation. Thin slices of the tone
of voice, but not the semantic content, were created from DEMO
terviews with the sales managers. Each manager was
classified as either "DEMO" or "outstanding" by a task
group of upper management based DEMO supervisors' evalua-
tions and actual sales effectiveness. This classification was
validated DEMO peer nominations.
Stimulus Preparation
Each sales manager participated in an interview with one
male and one female interviewer. Each interviewee was
asked the same DEMO questions with additional probing by
the interviewers to elicit more information. The interview be-
gan with questions about the interviewee's educational and
career DEMO Interviewees were then asked to recount in de-
tail two positive and two negative events from their sales ex-
perience to control for the DEMO of interviewee affect on
raters' evaluations. Three 20-sec clips were extracted DEMO
each interview (one from the biographical question, one from
the recounting of a positive event, and one from the recount-
ing of a negative event) by a research assistant who had no
knowledge about the hypotheses or the criterion ratings.
These clips were chosen by stopping the DEMO at a random
time after the question had been asked and taking a clip from
the first 20-sec of uninterrupted speech. The order of DEMO 3
clips for each sales manager was randomized, and the 36
DEMO (3 from each of the 12 managers) were assembled and
rerecorded onto a master tape in a counterbalanced design.
This tape was then DEMO, a process that removes
the high frequencies on which word recognition DEMO, but
preserves the sequence and rhythm of the speech.
Raters and DEMO
Twelve undergraduate students were recruited from the pop-
ulation of a large urban university to rate the 36 clips of the
managers. Raters came DEMO the laboratory individually and
were greeted by an experimenter, who told DEMO that they
would hear short segments of managers' speech and would
DEMO asked to rate each clip on 19 traits, on a continuum DEMO
from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very). The DEMO were chosen
based on previous research on judgments of tone of voice and
relevance to a job as a salesperson (Ambady et al., DEMO).
These traits were combined into three composite variables
based on the intercorrelation matrix (Rosenthal, 1987). The
interpersonal composite contained nine variables: collabora-
tive, cooperative, emotional, empathic, enthusiastic, percep-
tive, understanding, supportive, and warm. The task-oriented
composite contained nine variables: achieving, analytical,
confident, decisive, directive, influential, persevering, pro-
fessional, and DEMO The final variable, anxious,
was analyzed separately.
Raters were provided DEMO a definition of each of the vari-
ables (see the Appendix), and they familiarized themselves
with these definitions before starting the rating process. Evi-
dence indicates that individuals make more accurate judg-
ments when they have some prior information regarding the
dimensions that they DEMO rating (McDonald, 1991). Before
the rating session began, raters DEMO to and rated 10 prac-
tice, content-filtered clips to familiarize themselves DEMO the
somewhat unnatural sound of the content-filtered speech.
Other than these instructions, the raters received no training.
Previous research has demonstrated that naive raters are able
to reliably make such ratings without training (Blanck,
Rosenthal, & Vannicelli, 1986). Raters were instructed to lis-
ten to DEMO segment once and only once. The experimenter
then left the room and each rater listened to the audiotaped
segments and completed the rating scales. DEMO completing
the task, raters were paid, thanked, and debriefed.
Results
DEMO reliabilities of the 12 judges' ratings of the 19 traits were
DEMO by intraclass correlations (Rosenthal, 1987). The
reliabilities of the 12 judges' ratings ranged from .44 to .76,
with a mean of .63 (see Table 1). The grouping of the traits
into the three composites (Interpersonal, Task-Oriented, and
Anxious) was consistent with these DEMO Intercorrelations of
the traits within each composite were substantially higher
than the between-composite intercorrelations for both inter-
personal-orientation and task-orientation (see Table 2).

STUDY 2: JUDGMENTS BASED ON SALES
MANAGERS' FULL DEMO
The results of the previous study demonstrated that naive rat-
ers' DEMO of sales managers on interpersonal traits
strongly correlate with supervisor nominations. This sug-
gests not only that interpersonal skills are highly important
for success DEMO a sales manager but also that the extent to
which individuals possess these skills is observable after
only a brief exposure. To investigate this DEMO further, an-
other study was conducted in which judges were presented
DEMO both the tone of voice and the original semantic content
of the speech. Thus, the objective of this study was to com-
pare directly the criterion validity of judges' ratings based on
tone of voice cues to ratings based on the full audio channel.
This study was designed DEMO determine whether interpersonal

ality traits DEMO a method identical to that described earlier.

supervisor nominations as either "outstanding" or "average,"
r(6) = .59, p < .03. There was little relation between ratings of
task-orientation traits and supervisor nominations, r(6) DEMO .22,
ns. Likewise, the correlation between judges' ratings of anxi-
ety and supervisor nominations was not significant, r(6) =
.19, ns.
DISCUSSION
The results of these two studies demonstrate that thin slices
DEMO the vocal channel can be used to assess sales effectiveness,
as measured by supervisor evaluations and actual sales.
Whether or not semantic content DEMO included in the
thin-slice clips, na'ive judges' consensual ratings of interper-
sonally oriented dimensions of targets' personalities accu-
rately distinguished highly rated sales managers from less
highly rated sales managers. Specifically, more highly rated
managers were also rated more highly on interpersonal quali-
ties, based on brief audio clips from interview sessions. Re-
markably, judges were able to make these distinctions solely
on the basis of three 20-sec audio clips.
DEMO results are consistent with previous studies suggest-
ing that the thin-slice methodology is more valuable for eval-
uating interpersonal skills than noninterpersonal, task-re-
lated skills (Funder & Dobroth, 1987; Kenny et al., 1992;
DEMO & Flink, 1989; Park & Judd, 1989). This may DEMO due to
the greater observability of information relating to interper-
sonal skills through nonverbal channels, such as the voice, as
compared to task-related DEMO However, as Borkenau et al.
(2004) demonstrated, varying the task may tap into different
traits, such that the task-related skills may be observed in thin
slices of activities other than an interview.
Another possible DEMO for these findings is that
observability did not differentiate raters' ability DEMO judge in-
terpersonal skills in relation to task-related skills, but that DEMO
"outstanding" groups simply did not differ from the "aver-
age" groups in the extent to which they possessed
task-related skills. This would DEMO the low correlations
between ratings of task-related skills and superiors' evalua-
DEMO Although there is no empirical support presented here
in support of this claim, support does come from a study con-
ducted previously by Kelley and Caplan (1993). In this study,
measures of interpersonal and task-related skills were ob-
tained from two samples of engineers: those nominated as
"stars" by their managers and peers and those nominated as
"average." Interestingly, the researchers found that the only
distinguishing difference between DEMO two groups was the
stars' interpersonal and affective skills. Specifically, stars
were more skilled at developing rapport with coworkers and
building extensive, loose networks of reliable problem solv-
ers. Perhaps the same phenomenon was at DEMO in this study.
If it were primarily interpersonal skills that differentiated the
"outstanding" sales managers from the "average" ones, there
would be little correlation between task-related skills and the
criterion. This is exactly what DEMO found.
The findings with regard to judges' ratings of managers as
DEMO are also intriguing. In Study 1, when judges were
presented only DEMO tone-of-voice clips, judges' ratings of
targets' level of anxiety correlated DEMO with superiors'
evaluations. This finding supports the work by Ambady et al.
(2002), who found that anxiety as inferred from the tone of
voice was a strong postdictor of the malpractice claims status
of DEMO physicians. Thus, surgeons who were judged
as more anxious were less DEMO to be sued than physicians
judged to be less anxious. This effect likely occurred because
anxiety as inferred from the tone of voice signals DEMO, an
important quality in physicians.
However, this effect was diluted when judges were pre-
sented with both the tone of voice and the DEMO content of
the audiotaped interview. In this condition, judges' ratings of
managers' level of anxiety did not correlate nearly as highly
with consultants' supervisor evaluations. One possible expla-
nation for this disparity could be that anxiety is more easily
observed through "nonverbally pure" channels of communi-
DEMO, that is, through tone, pitch, gestures, and so forth,DEMO
which are less subject to conscious control (DePaulo, 1992).
Thus, anxious sales managers who were attempting to appear
poised and confident while being audiotaped may have been

able to manipulate their speech content and thus DEMO have
led raters in the full audio condition to believe they were not
anxious. It is unlikely, however, that the sales managers were
DEMO to control the underlying nonverbal vocal correlates of
anxiety, which were DEMO to raters in the tone-of-voice
condition.
LIMITATIONS
AND BOUNDARIES
Although judgments based on thin slices of expressive be-
havior as short as 1-sec have DEMO to be surprisingly accu-
rate, there are clear boundary conditions for DEMO use of
thin-slice methodology. As discussed earlier, the more ob-
servable DEMO traits being judged, the more accurate are the
judgments (as in the comparison between interpersonal and
task-oriented ratings). Another element to consider DEMO the ab-
straction level of the construct being judged. Judgments of
vague macrovariables, such as the judgment of "warmth," are
more accurate DEMO specific microvariables, such as smiles or
gaze. One reason for this DEMO that the same specific behavior
can mean very different things in different contexts. For ex-
ample, a smile may indicate warmth, anxiety, or hostility, de-
pending on the context (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993).
As the two studies presented in this article have demon-
strated, the inclusion of verbal content may sometimes have a
negative effect on the DEMO of thin-slice judgments. Anx-
iety ratings were correlated with performance only in the
content-filtered condition, but not when the verbal informa-
tion was available. This finding is convergent with other re-
cent evidence. For example, Grahe and Bernieri (1999)
found that thin-slice judgments based on silent video clips
were more accurate than judgments based on video clips that
included DEMO information. Additionally, Peterson,
Cannito, and Brown's (1995) study of direct salespeople
found that housewives' ratings of audio clips were not related
to sales performance. This contradictory finding may be due
to the DEMO of the verbal content in the thin-slice clips. In
contrast, Berry, Pennebaker, Mueller, and Hiller (1997)
found the opposite effect, DEMO that key words in a dyadic
conversation communicated more accurate information
about competency, dominance, and warmth of the target than
did nonverbal cues. DEMO, the inclusion of verbal content may
sometimes enhance accuracy, although impairing accuracy at
other times. This suggests that it is useful to create DEMO con-
taining different levels of verbal and nonverbal cues, such as
DEMO two studies presented here.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN SALES
AND MARKETING
Clearly, DEMO slices could be useful in the selection and
training of salespeople, DEMO in relation to interper-
sonal skills. Building on these findings, it DEMO be
beneficial to incorporate the thin-slice methodology to fur-
ther investigate personality correlates of sales effectiveness.
Future research might vary the task, the criteria, the rating
variables, and the channel to gain a more comprehensive
DEMO of the predictors of effective sales. Following
Borkenau et al. (2004), thin slices from different types of
tasks may tap into different types of traits relevant to sales.
For example, the same methodology could be used with
real interactions with consumers, instead of staged inter-
views. In addition to a criterion variable of supervisor rat-
ings, it would be informative to correlate thin-slice judg-
ments with consumer perceptions, customer retention rates,
and measures of salesperson-customer relationship quality.
Finally, these studies demonstrated the predictive validity
of thin slices of the vocal channel for sales effectiveness,DEMO
but it is also worthwhile to investigate other channels such
as the face and body.
Thus far, we have considered sales personnel as the targets
in thin-slice judgments. We can also regard the sales person-
nel DEMO the judges and the consumer as the target. Salespeople
must often adapt their strategy based on the type of con-
sumer. Individuals who are DEMO at diagnosing personality
traits, affect, and motivations would arguably be better at
adapting strategies and perform better. Social perception re-
search has demonstrated DEMO there are individual differences
in judgment accuracy. A meta-analysis by Davis and Kraus
(1997) found that people who are more intelligent, more
cognitively complex, less dogmatic, better adjusted, and
more interpersonally oriented tend to be more accurate
judges of others. Individual differences in accuracy may vary
DEMO across judgment tasks and judgment contexts
(Ambady et al., 2000; DEMO, Bernieri, Gada-Jain, & Grahe,
1999). In another study, occupational therapy students' per-
formance on a test of nonverbal sensitivity was correlated
with supervisor ratings of their clinical fieldwork. Judgment
accuracy of facial DEMO not body cues was correlated with su-
pervisor ratings in a psychiatric rehabilitation setting
(Tickle-Degnen, 1998). Thus, performance on different mea-
sures of person perception can vary by the role and context.
Future research DEMO explore what types of thin-slice tasks
are good predictors of individual differences in sales effec-
tiveness and strategy adaptation for use in salesperson selec-
DEMO Furthermore, this perspective could inform training pro-
grams.
The thin-slice methodology DEMO also be applied to re-
search in consumer behavior, beyond the DEMO
tomer relationship. For example, it may have significant
implications in the DEMO of advertising, particularly in radio
and television ads. With only a DEMO time to sell a product,
first impressions of the actors or models may be vital.
Through facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice, and
other nonverbal cues, actors may convey more than the ver-
bal script intends.
