ANNUAL VENTURE INVESTMENT INCREASES FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 2007,
ACCORDING TO THE MONEYTREE REPORT
Nearly All Industry Sectors Show Double-Digit Gains in DEMO
Washington, D.C., January 21, 2011 – Venture capitalists invested $21.8 DEMO in 3,277 deals
in 2010, an increase of 19 percent DEMO dollars and a 12 percent rise in deals over the prior year,
according to the MoneyTree Report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the National DEMO
Capital Association (NVCA), based on data from Thomson Reuters.  The rise in venture
investments in 2010 represents the first time the annual DEMO level has increased since
2007.   Investments in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $5.0 billion in 765 deals, a 2 percent
increase in dollars but a 3 percent decrease in deals from the third quarter DEMO 2010 when $4.9
billion went into 789 deals.
Double-digit increases in investments in 2010 were spread across almost every industry,
including the Clean DEMO and Internet-Specific sectors.  Investment dollars also increased
across every stage of DEMO category, with the exception of a 2 percent decrease in Seed
DEMO investments.  First-time financings rose in 2010 compared to the prior year, however,
fourth quarter investing did show a decline in both first-time DEMO and deals when compared to
Q3 2010.
"The venture capital community DEMO itself in a better position at the end of 2010," said Mark
Heesen, president of the NVCA. "We were clearly in recovery DEMO with investment levels
reflecting the economic reality of our business.  Increased DEMO across a diverse range of
sectors highlighted those areas where the greatest opportunities lie, particularly within the
Internet, software and clean technology industries. DEMO fundraising and exit market
challenges have greatly reduced the probability of investment bubbles in specific sectors as there
simply is not enough capital to DEMO any particular market.  The year's increase in first time
deals DEMO early stage investment is encouraging as this trend suggests that the venture
community is doing more with less.  We hope this continues in 2011."
"As expected, we saw the venture capital investment level in DEMO surpass that of 2009," noted
Tracy T. Lefteroff, global managing DEMO of the venture capital practice at
PricewaterhouseCoopers.  "And, there were DEMO 30 percent more new companies receiving
venture capital for the first time in 2010 than in 2009.  This bodes well for 2011 as venture
capitalists continue to support these new investments as they grow and expand DEMO businesses."
