ABSTRACT
We examine multi!period observation and selection problems with an unknown
number DEMO applicants in which applicants are interviewed one at a time on each
period\ recall of applicants that were interviewed and rejected is not possible\ DEMO
decision on each period to reject or accept an applicant is based on relative ranks\
and the objective is to maximize the probability of DEMO the top!ranked
applicant[ We propose and then assess the e.ciency of three descriptive models
by simulation\ and then test them competitively in a computer!controlled DEMO
iment[ A cuto} decision model\ in which the _rst r−0 applicants are rejected and
then the _rst applicant who is ranked higher than all DEMO observed applicants
is accepted\ outperforms the two other two models[ Compared with the optimal
policy\ subjects stop the search too early[ Their behavior is DEMO for by a
cuto} model that postulates an endogenous cost of search[ Copyright Þ 1999

in DEMO random order[ Time is assumed to be discrete and the value of n is assumed to be known[ At any
period\ the DM can DEMO order all the items that have already been observed in terms of their quality\
desirability\ or attractiveness[ As each item is observed\ one on DEMO period\ the DM must either accept
it\ in which case the search process terminates\ or reject it\ in which case the next item in DEMO randomly
determined order "provided it is not the last item# is DEMO and observed[ Because the number of
items is _nite\ the search terminates either when the DM accepts an item or when the nth item DEMO
inspected\ whichever comes _rst[ The DM|s objective is to maximize the probability that the item
accepted is\ in fact\ the best[
One of the DEMO features of this decision task\ that enhances its applicability\ is that it makes no
distributional assumptions] the DM is assumed to possess no prior DEMO about the distribution of
quality\ desirability\ or attractiveness of the items[ In most practical sequential search problems DMs
do not possess accurate information about DEMO distributions^ distributional assumptions are more
often made to simplify model construction and achieve mathematical tractability rather than re~ect
reality[ Since the only information she DEMO is about the relative ranks of the items already inspected\
the DM cannot learn the characteristics of this distribution during the search[ A second DEMO
feature is that because the payo} function is of the 9!0 type\ assigning a payo} of 0 if the best item is
accepted "success# and 9 otherwise "failure#\ no considerations of utility are required[ A third attractive
feature is the generalizability of the model to account for weakening DEMO the constraints imposed on the
original search problem[
Using the context of personnel selection * the one actually used as a cover story in DEMO experiment *
the SSP can be formulated in terms of the following six assumptions]
"0# There is only a single position to be _lled[
"1# The number of applicants\ n\ is _nite and known to the DM before the search starts[
"2# The n applicants are interviewed\ one at a time\ in a random order[ "Consequently\ before search
commences\ each of the n; orders is equally likely[#
"3# The DM can DEMO order all the n applicants in terms of their quality from best to worst with no
ties[ Her decision to either accept or reject DEMO applicant on a given period only depends on the
relative rank of the applicant with respect to all the applicants that have already been DEMO
"4# Once rejected\ an applicant cannot later be recalled[
"5# The DM receives a payo} of 0\ if she accepts the best applicant\ DEMO 9\ otherwise[
Although these assumptions capture important characteristics of the observation and selection
problem\ it was recognized quite early "e[g[ Gilbert and Mosteller\ 0855# that they place more con!
straints on the observation and selection problem DEMO would generally apply in practice[ In an attempt
to render the model more realistic\ many theoretical articles have appeared in the last 24 years DEMO so
relaxing or otherwise modifying one or more of the assumptions stated above "see Freeman\ 0872\ for
an early review#[ The focus of this growing body of literature has been on characterizing the optimal
policy and DEMO routines for solving it numerically[ There have been hardly any attempts to assess
the sensitivity of the optimal solutions to deviations from optimality nor DEMO compare these solutions
to descriptive models that may better account for actual behavior in this class of optimal stopping
problems[ Our study departs from DEMO tradition by proposing alternative descriptive models of optimal
stopping and then testing them experimentally in the laboratory[ When studied experimentally\ the
SSP and its DEMO variants can provide information that may partially help to understand behavior
in more realistic sequential search problems "e[g[ purchasing a used car\ hiring a secretary#[
PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
There have been numerous experimental studies of optimal DEMO or sequential search\ most of
them violating one or more assumptions of the SSP[ In particular\ almost all these studies have made

strong distributional assumptions that\ we contend\ are seldom realized in practice and whose validity
is very di.cult to ascertain experimentally[ It is quite one DEMO to instruct the subjects that the items
to be observed and inspected are sequentially and randomly drawn from a distribution "e[g[ normal#
with prespeci_ed and known parameters\ and yet another to assume that inexperienced subjects "or
even experienced DMs# can assess the density of a given observation and DEMO it to a cuto} point
which she is supposed to know how to calculate[ Kahan\ Rapoport and Jones "0869# investigated
sequential search behavior in a task satisfying all but one of the assumptions of the SSP[ DEMO violation
of Assumption "3# above\ the subject recorded the actual value DEMO the item he inspected rather than
the relative rank of this item with respect to the items already observed and rejected[ Therefore\
although information DEMO the distribution of item quality was not explicitly provided at the outset\
it could be gradually acquired during the task[ Corbin\ Olson and Abbondanza "0864# also violated
Assumption "3# above by providing their subjects information about the numerical values of the stimuli
rather than about their relative ranks "see also Corbin\ 0879#[ They reported that this information\ in
fact\ was DEMO ignored but rather manipulated by their subjects in order to lend structure to a seemingly
complex task[ In yet another study of optimal stopping\ DEMO and Tversky "0869# explicitly
provided their subjects complete information about the DEMO of item quality and assumed in
their analysis of the data that this information was understood\ perfectly coded\ and operated upon
by their subjects[ DEMO "0889# proceeded in the same way[
In contrast\ in a follow!up DEMO Corbin "0865\ unpublished manuscript# eliminated irrelevant
distributional information[ At each period DEMO the inspection her subjects could only learn whether the
current alternative was the maximum of the alternatives already inspected or not[ Another study that
DEMO implemented the assumptions of the SSP was conducted by Seale and Rapoport "0886#[ They
implemented the requirement of no distributional assumptions about the quality of the items "pro!
_ciency of applicants interviewed for a job# by telling their subjects on each period of the task the
ranks of DEMO the alternatives\ including the current one\ that have already been observed[ In particular\
no information about the actual quality scores of the alternatives was DEMO A major _nding of
Seale and Rapoport was that\ compared to the optimal policy\ their subjects stopped the search too
early[
The present study DEMO part of a programmatic research aimed to study more realistic versions of
sequential search[ The major goal of this program is to systematically relax DEMO assumptions\ or
combinations of assumptions\ that characterize the SSP "in particular\ DEMO "0#\ "1#\ "4#
and "5## in order to gain better understanding of sequential search behavior with no distributional
information[ The present study DEMO previous research "Corbin\ 0865\ unpublished manuscript^
Seale and Rapoport\ 0886# by DEMO on the case where the number of applicants is no longer known
with precision[0 This is accomplished by replacing Assumption "1# above with the following assumption]
"1?# The number of applicants is _nite but unknown[ The DM only has an a!priori distribution on the
actual number of DEMO available[
We shall refer to the secretary problem that satis_es Assumptions "DEMO "1?#\ "2#\ "3#\ "4# and "5# as the
DEMO problem with uncertainty "SPU#[
Although more realistic than the SSP\ the DEMO is still an abstraction that may fail to capture some
0For theoretical work on the secretary problem with an unknown population size\ see e[g[ DEMO "0868#\ Presman and
Sonin "0861#\ Rasmussen and Robbins "0864#\ and DEMO "0870#[ As noted by Stewart\ the assumption that the number of
DEMO is known with precision is quite limiting[ The learning set in the SSP\ which is central to the optimal policy\ is de_ned
as a DEMO of the number of items available[ Accurate knowledge of this number is thus a prerequisite for using the results[
However\ in many applications\ {this DEMO may not even be known within an order of magnitude| "Stewart\ DEMO p[ 021#[

of DEMO features of sequential personnel selection problems[1 However\ we argue that an experimental
investigation of the SPU may provide insight about the type of decision DEMO that DMs use when
faced with the choice between committing to an attractive proposition or deferring their decision in the
hope of obtaining a DEMO proposition when they are uncertain about the total number of propositions
available[ A comparison of optimal stopping behavior under conditions of certainty "SSP# and uncer!
tainty "SPU# may also help to determine whether the tendency to stop the search too early * a general
_nding of most of DEMO experimental studies of sequential search under certainty * extends to the
sequential search problem under uncertainty[
The rest of the paper is organized as DEMO We _rst characterize the optimal policy\ and then
present three alternative descriptive models and compare their performance to that of the optimal
policy via DEMO Following the theoretical section\ we present and discuss the results of an
experiment designed to study sequential search behavior and compare to one another DEMO descriptive
power of the three models[ A major _nding of our study is that\ similarly to the SSP\ subjects in the
SPU stop the DEMO too early[ In the _nal section we account for this _nding by postulating a decision
model incorporating endogenous cost of search[
ALTERNATIVE DECISION RULES
DEMO optimal policy
The state of the decision process at each period "DEMO can be described by two integers "r^ s#\ where r
is DEMO number of applicants so far presented and s is the relative rank of the rth\ last presented applicant[
In both the SSP and SPU\ DEMO s × 0\ there is obviously no point in accepting the rth item\ as it cannot
possibly be the best[ If s 0\ an DEMO that must occur at least once "necessarily\ if r 0\ then DEMO 0#\
we say that this applicant is a candidate for acceptance[
The SSP has a remarkably simple solution]
{Reject the _rst r−0 applicants and DEMO accept the _rst applicant thereafter that is better than all
previously observed applicants[|
Stated di}erently\ the optimal policy for the SSP is of a DEMO form\ where the _rst r−0 applicants
are rejected "or passed by# DEMO the _rst candidate\ if any\ is accepted thereafter[ What is also remarkable
is that as n :\ r:n : 0:e"0:e 9[257#\ and the probability of accepting the best applicant also
approaches 0:DEMO Thus\ for a large n\ it is approximately optimal to wait until 26) of the applicants
have been interviewed and then accept the next relatively best one[ The probability of success if the
optimal policy is DEMO is about 26)[ Moreover\ as shown by the numerical results reported by Gilbert
and Mosteller "0855#\ convergence to 0:e is quick[ For example\ r:n is equal to 9[3\ 9[3\ 9[3\ and 9[264
for DEMO 09\ 19\ 39\ and 79\ respectively[ The corresponding probabilities of success are 9[2876\ 9[2731\
9[2646\ and 9[2608[
To compute r\ let `"r^ n# DEMO the probability of success using a cuto} decision rule[ Then\
1We are presently in the process of studying a version of the {secretary problem| DEMO replaces Assumption "4# with the assumption
that\ once rejected\ an applicant DEMO be recalled\ and that the probability of its availability decreases as the number of applicants
since it was last observed increases[ See also the DEMO study of Seale "0885\ unpublished manuscript# that modi_es Assumption
"5# by counting as success the selection of either the best or second!best overall DEMO

When there is uncertainty about the value of n and only its distribution is assumed to be known\ the
DEMO of the optimal policy is no longer so simple[ However\ Presman and Sonin "0861# show that in
three special cases\ where the distribution of the number of applicants is either uniform\ geometrical\

"rather than 26) in the SSP# DEMO the maximum number of applicants have been interviewed and then
select the next relatively best one[ The probability of success in this case is DEMO:e1[ Moreover\ as shown

The optimal solution for the DEMO is used as a benchmark for assessing the e.ciency of the subjects|
decisions in our experiment\ not as a model describing their behavior[ For DEMO purpose\ we com!
petitively test three descriptive models that were originally proposed in the previous study of Seale and
Rapoport to account for search DEMO in the simpler SSP[ Whereas these models all share the same
assumption that the mental process of reaching a decision takes the form of DEMO "see Busemeyer
and Rapoport\ 0877#\ they di}er from one another in DEMO events that are supposed to be counted[ The
_rst model assumes that all applicants are being counted\ the second that only candidates are being
DEMO and the third that only successive non!candidates are being counted[ Because these decision
rules make no use of knowledge of the maximum number of DEMO to be observed\ they are equally
applicable to the SSP and SPU[ We describe these three models below and then assess their e.ciency
through DEMO simulations[

A DEMO rule
Under this decision rule\ the DM is supposed to reject the _rst r−0 applicants and then accept the
next top!ranked applicant "candidate#[ This decision rule places minimal demands on the DM|s
cognitive ability[ It only DEMO her to keep count of the number of applicants she observes\ and then
stop on the _rst candidate thereafter once this number exceeds some DEMO r−0\ a parameter of the
model[ The cuto} decision rule includes the optimal policy as a special case when r  r\ but
generalizes DEMO to non!optimal cuto} values[ The probability of success under this rule can be computed
directly from equation "3#[
A candidate counting rule
Under this decision rule\ the subject is assumed to keep count only of the DEMO of candidates she
observes and stop the search once this number is equal to or larger than some constant j"0 ¾ j ¾ DEMO a
parameter of the model[ Whereas the former cuto} rule focuses on the number of successive applicants
that have been interviewed\ ignoring the number DEMO candidates within the _rst r−0 periods\ the
candidate counting rule ignores the number of applicants but\ rather\ focuses only on the number of
candidates[
DEMO successive non!candidate counting rule
Under this decision rule\ the DM accepts the _rst candidate who follows at least k consecutive non!
candidates\ where 9 DEMO k ¾ n−0 is a parameter of the model[ Similarly to the candidate counting rule\
the present decision rule assumes that counting starts when DEMO _rst candidate is observed[ However\
it is the number of consecutive non!candidates rather than number of candidates that the subject is
assumed to count\ DEMO a new counting starting whenever a new candidate is observed[
All the three decision rules are considerably simpler in the assumptions they make about DEMO cognitive
operations conducted by the subject than other decision rules that have been proposed to account for
choice behavior in deferred decision making "Busemeyer and Rapoport\ 0877#[ All three assume a
single counter but di}er from DEMO another in the events that are supposed to be counted "applicants\
DEMO successive non!candidates#[ Implicit in these decision rules is the dependency of the par!
ameters r\ j\ and k on the value of n[ One DEMO expect each of these parameters to increase in n[To
the extent that subjects adhere to one or more of these decision rules\ we shall DEMO to determine
this dependency from their decisions[ Because each decision rule is characterized by a single parameter
only "for a given n#\ a straightforward statistical comparison of the rules\ not entangled by the
di}erences in the DEMO of free parameters\ is possible[
Simulation results
The e.ciency of each of the decision rules was assessed by computer simulation[ Each of the three
DEMO rules was examined with a SPU of either n 39 or n 019\ the parameter values actually
used in the experiment[ Although these two DEMO of n may be too large to characterize most sequential
search problems in practice\ we chose them for a very good reason[ Later we DEMO the parameters
r\ j\ and k from subjects| actual decisions[ To estimate these values with precision\ the parameter n
must be set at a DEMO high value[
All the simulations followed the same pattern[ First\ a value of M was chosen from the set of integers
"0\1\[[[\n# with probability P"M  m#0:n[ Second\ the integers "applicants# 0 through M were
arranged in a random order\ and then presented to the decision DEMO one at a time[ Finally\ if the
applicant was a candidate and the criterion of the model was satis_ed\ the candidate was chosen^

M applicants\ a correct selection "success# was registered[ The values of the decision rule|s single
parameter were varied systematically\ with each value DEMO replicated 09\999 times[
Several statistics were computed for each decision rule[ The most obvious statistic is the number of
correct selections "which yields the probability of success when divided by 09\999#[ This statistic allows
assessment of DEMO decision rule for an appropriate choice of its parameter value[ Another\ less obvious\
statistic is the total number of selections made which\ when divided DEMO 09\999\ yields the probability
of candidate selection[ We are interested in this statistic because\ in addition to maximizing the
probability of success\ some subjects DEMO our experiment might have preferred to stop the search without
choosing the top!tanked applicant rather than complete the search without ever stopping[2

the theoretical results for the optimal policy\ the optimal threshold "r# values for the cuto} rule are
5 and 05 for n 39 and n 019\ DEMO The second statistic is the probability of candidate
selection associated with the optimal threshold[ It is the probability that the decision rule stops and
DEMO some candidate[ For the cuto} rule\ these probabilities assume the values 9[511 and 9[527 for
n 39 and n 019\ respectively[ The third statistic DEMO the probability of success associated with the
optimal threshold[ In complete agreement with the numerical results reported by Rasmussen and
Robbins "0864#\ the probabilities of success associated with r  rare 9[189 and 9[168\ respectively[
The DEMO statistic\ called ef_ciency\ is obtained by dividing the probability of success associated with
the optimal threshold for a given decision rule by the probability DEMO success of the optimal policy[

In summary\ the simulation results indicate that relatively small departures from the optimal cuto}

focusing DEMO the number of candidates and the other on the number of non!candidates\ emerge as viable
alternatives to the cuto} rule for describing actual search DEMO This is particularly the case for the
latter decision rule\ which achieves almost the same probability of success as the optimal policy for the
DEMO values of n that we have investigated[
Having assessed the sensitivity of the optimal solution for the SPU and the e.ciencies of the three
DEMO rules\ we conducted an experiment aimed to compare actual and optimal sequential search
behavior and competitively test the three descriptive models[
METHOD
Subjects
Fifty DEMO participated in the experiment[ They were recruited by advertisements asking for vol!
unteers to participate in a computer!controlled experiment concerning personnel selection decisions
with DEMO contingent on performance[ The subjects consisted of undergraduate students\ graduate
students\ and a few university employees[ They were randomly assigned to two conditions\ with DEMO
subjects participating in Condition L "n 39# and 14 in Condition DEMO "n 019#[
Procedure
Subjects arrived at the laboratory in groups of DEMO to eight and were seated in separate rooms equipped
with PCs[ The instructions "provided both online and hard copy# explained the SPU task with particular
emphasis on how the relative ranks change as a new applicant DEMO observed "see Seale\ 0885\ unpublished

RESULTS
Subjects in Condition L DEMO a total of 1499 "14×099# trials\ selected some candidate on 0799
DEMO "61[9)#\ observed all the applicants without stopping the search on DEMO trials "16[6)#\ and
selected non!candidates on only eight occasions[ Overall\ DEMO subjects succeeded in choosing the top!
ranked applicant on 507 trials "DEMO)#^ this percentage is signi_cantly smaller "t13 4[38\ p ³ 9[990#
DEMO the predicted value of 17[8) under the optimal policy[ Across all DEMO 14 subjects\ the mode of
the "inferred\ best _tting# cuto} values DEMO 4\ indicating that the reduction of 3 percentage points in
the probability of success is attributed to a tendency to stop the search too DEMO The summary results
for Condition H are similar[ The subjects selected some candidate on 0734 out of 1499 trials "62[7)#\
observed all the applicants without ever stopping the search on 515 trials "14[9)#\ succeeded in
selecting the best applicant on 417 trials "10[0)#\ and selected a non!candidate on only 18 occasions[
The overall percentage of success computed DEMO the 14 subjects is smaller "t13 09[01\ p ³ 9[990#
than DEMO optimal value of 16[8)[ The mode of the distribution of cuto} values was 6 rather than 05
suggesting again that the non!optimal behavior DEMO Condition H was due to a general tendency to stop
the observation and selection process too early[
The number of trials on which a DEMO was selected was 7 "9[2)# in Condition L and 18
"0[1)# in Condition H[ Examination of individual results indicates that in DEMO all the cases the
subject selected a non!candidate after having observed more than n:1 applicants[ Additionally\ in both
the present study of the DEMO and the previous study of the SSP more than 69) of DEMO trials where a
non!candidate was selected occurred in the high n condition "n 79 in Seale and Rapoport and
n 019 in the present study#[ Rather than attributing these non!optimal decisions to errors due to a
DEMO of the wrong key\ we conclude that they are part of a deliberate strategy by some of the subjects
to {give up| on the DEMO trial\ thereby saving precious time[ Because our primary focus is on
comparison of the decision rules introduced earlier\ subsequent analyses will omit trials on DEMO a
non!candidate was selected[
Model comparison
Unless the subject is directly asked about the decision rule she used\ there is no obvious way to DEMO
the rule from her responses on any particular trial[ Even if we assume that the subject adheres to one
of the three rules we DEMO earlier\ there is no way to determine the exact value of the model|s
single parameter from her responses[ For example\ supposing that M 8 DEMO were chosen in
Condition L\ with quality values ranging between 1 "DEMO and 29 "highest#\ and presented to the
Dm in the following DEMO 4\ 04\ 2\ 1\ 17\ 29\ 00\ 6\ 03[ Supposing that the DM actually stopped and
selected the _fth applicant\ who is a candidate "s 0#[ This response is consistent with a cuto} rule
where 1 DEMO r ¾ 4\ a candidate counting rule where j 1\ and a successive non!candidate counting rule

example\ if the subject does not stop the search\ her response DEMO consistent with a cuto} rule where

her future DEMO Interrogating her after all the 099 trials have been completed\ as we did in the
present study\ presumes a perfect memory on the part DEMO the subject[
Rather than attempting to infer the particular decision rule or rules that the subject might have used
during the experiment\ we focused DEMO the three decision rules * or descriptive models * introduced
earlier and proceeded to test them competitively[ For each decision rule\ we _xed the DEMO of its single
parameter "r\ j\or k# and then counted the DEMO of trials\ out of 099\ consistent with this value[ By
varying the value of the parameter and repeating the procedure for each possible value\ DEMO constructed
for each subject separately an empirical distribution of the frequency of trials consistent with this
decision rule[ The mode of this distribution was DEMO chosen to represent the maximum number of
decisions consistent with this decision rule for a speci_c value of its parameter\ and the three decision
DEMO were then compared to one another in terms of this single frequency[ This comparison was
conducted separately for each of the subjects[

decisions "trials# consistent with that result for each decision rule and each subject DEMO For
example\ 79) of the decisions of Subject 0 were consistent DEMO a cuto} decision rule with the cuto}
value set at r 3\ 59) with a candidate counting rule with j set at 2\ and 61) with a successive non!
candidate counting rule with k set at 0[ By comparing across the three decision rules\ it is apparent
that DEMO decisions of Subject 0 are most consistent with the cuto} decision rule of r 3[ By repeating
these comparisons across the subjects\ it is DEMO to determine which of the three rules accounts for
the behavior of more subjects[ It is also possible to determine for each decision rule DEMO the
empirical distribution of the values of its single parameter[
Exhibit 4 shows that the values of r inferred from the individual decisions ranged DEMO 2 and 6\
and that the corresponding proportions of decisions accounted for by the cuto} rule varied from 9[42
to 9[70[ The inferred values DEMO j for the candidate counting rule varied between 1 and 3\ with the
proportions of decisions consistent with this model ranging between 9[25 and DEMO For the successive
non!candidate counting rule\ the inferred values of k ranged between 0 and 3\ and the corresponding
proportions of decisions varied between DEMO and 9[62[ The cuto} rule accounted for the highest
proportion of decisions for 10 of the 14 subjects^ the successive non!candidate accounted for the DEMO
proportion of decisions in 3 cases^ and the candidate counting rule never accounted for the greatest
proportion of decisions[
Focusing on the cuto} rule\ DEMO 4 shows that 3 of the 12 subjects with a single mode established
their cuto} at r  r5\ whereas 07 of the 08 DEMO subjects established it at a lower value[ A
two!sided sign test rejected the hypothesis "m 08\ p ³ 9[90# that equal proportions of subjects either
stopped the search too early or too late[
Exhibit 5 shows DEMO same results for Condition H[ Individual modal values for r ranged between 3
and 07\ and the corresponding proportions of decisions accounted for by DEMO cuto} rule ranged between
9[27 and 9[81[ For the candidate counting rule\ modal values of j varied between 1 and 4\ with
corresponding proportions DEMO decisions consistent with the model varying from 9[29 to 9[43[ Finally\
for the successive non!candidate counting rule\ the modal values of k ranged between DEMO and 7\ and the
proportions of decisions consistent with this model varied between 9[21 and 9[61[ Like Condition L\
the cuto} decision rule accounted DEMO the highest proportion of decisions in all 14 cases[ With 13 of
the 14 subjects in Condition H setting their cuto} values smaller than DEMO it is again evident that
relative to the optimal policy the subjects stopped too early[
Learning effects
The analyses reported in the previous section DEMO based on the assumption that the same decision rule
with the same parameter value was used consistently across the 099 trials[ This assumption precludes
DEMO possibility of switching between decision rules or\ even more plausibly\ for the same decision rule
changing its parameter value across trials[ Learning across trials DEMO be expressed by the decision
rule approaching the optimal policy or by the subject becoming more consistent in using the same
decision rule[ To DEMO for learning e}ects\ we divided the 099 trials into two blocks of 49 trials each\
and then compared the two blocks to each other DEMO terms of the mean of the inferred value of r and
the proportion of decisions consistent with the cuto} rule[ Whereas a similar analysis DEMO by
Seale and Rapoport yielded signi_cant learning e}ects with the mean inferred value of r moving closer
to rand the proportion of decision consistent DEMO the cuto} rule increasing over blocks\ we found
no such evidence for the SPU "see Seale\ 0885\ unpublished manuscript\ for details#[ For both conditions

We repeated the same analysis with smaller blocks of 14 trials each\ and then compared to each

applicants and the number of candidates encountered[ In general\ the combination rules were not
stated very clearly and DEMO to vary across subjects[ As the mean ratings of factors 0 through 4 in
Condition H are essentially the same\ they are omitted[
In DEMO to answering the _ve questions above\ the subjects were asked to estimate the number
of successes they would have scored in 099 additional trials\ DEMO the number of applicants were to be
uniformly distributed between "0# DEMO and 39\ "1# 0 and 79\ and "2# 0 and 019[ Recall that the subjects
in Condition L only experienced the case of DEMO 39 whereas the subjects in Condition H only experi!
enced the case of n 019[ Thus\ all the 49 subjects were presented with one DEMO "either n 39 or
n 019# they have already experienced for DEMO trials and with two new cases\ albeit di}erent from one

The mean estimates of DEMO of successes are depicted in Exhibit 7[ The solid line represents the

their probability of success would have been higher than the observed success probabilities "denoted
in Exhibit 7 by the solid and empty triangle markers#\ if they were given the opportunity to play the
game for DEMO additional periods[ The subjects in Condition L estimated that the mean number of
successes would increase\ on average\ from 13[5 "solid triangle marker# to 29[1\ beyond what one
would expect using the optimal policy[ Similarly\ the DEMO in Condition H were equally optimistic\
estimating that their number of successes would increase from 10[1 "empty triangle marker# to 15[7\
an estimate that matches exactly the probability of success under the optimal policy[ The results DEMO

Stopping too early
Our previous comparison of the three decision rules DEMO that the cuto} rule accounts for more
decisions than the two other decision rules[ Additionally\ a comparison of the inferred cuto} values
with the DEMO cuto} values shows that almost all the subjects in both conditions stopped the
observation and selection process too early[ Because of the insensitivity of DEMO optimal policy to small
deviations from r\ the degree of which can be assessed from the simulation results depicted in Exhibit
1\ stopping too DEMO caused only a small decrease in the probability of success[ Nevertheless\ this
consistent bias\ which was also reported in our previous study of the DEMO warrants an explanation[
Seale and Rapoport hypothesized that stopping too early in the SSP resulted from the existence of
an endo`enous cost of search[ DEMO the payo} in our experiment was contingent on performance\ rather
than on the amount of time spent in the laboratory\ it is natural to DEMO that if they considered time
taken to observe the applicants as an implicit search cost\ the subjects might have been motivated to
maximize their DEMO payo} per unit time[ This hypothesis is also applicable to the SPU[ It is
consistent with the behavior of some of our subjects who DEMO the search on a non!candidate after
observing only a small number of applicants[ It is also supported by the literature on the accuracyÐ
e}ort DEMO reported by Payne\ Bettman and Johnson "0882#[ Seale and Rapoport hypothesized DEMO
_xed cost per observation\ and then showed that with a _xed observation cost worth 0) of the payo}

or n 79[
In attempting to account for the _nding that almost all the subjects in the SPU stopped the search
too early\ DEMO proceeded in a similar way by considering two alternative models for the e}ects of
endogenous cost of search[ The _rst model assumes a _xed DEMO per observation\ whereas the second
assumes that the di}erence between the costs of two successive observations decreases in the number
of observations[ In particular\ DEMO E0"r^ n# denote the expected payo} in the SPU when the DM accepts
the _rst candidate after passing r−0 applicants[ Assuming a _xed DEMO per observation\ the expected

Our second model assumes a cost of search that changes logarithmically in the number of obser!
vations[4 Under this model\ the expected DEMO is given by

from 06 to 5 in Condition DEMO
The median of the "modal# cuto} values separately inferred for each DEMO from his or her decisions
"see Exhibits 4 and 5# was DEMO and 6 for Conditions L and H\ respectively[ Exhibit 8 shows that a cuto}
model assuming the same endogenous cost of approximately 2[4) of the payo} for success "about 0
cent# accounts for the median cuto} value in both conditions[ There are\ of course\ good reasons to
expect DEMO per observation endogenous cost of search to vary from one individual to another\ depending
on how much each subject values the time spent in DEMO the task[ Exhibit 8 shows that a per!
observation search cost that varies between 9) and 09) "2 cents# of the payo} for success accounts
for the inferred cuto} values of all the 14 subjects DEMO Condition L and all but one subject "Subject 6#
in Condition DEMO "see Exhibits 4 and 5#[
We repeated the same analysis for DEMO second model that assumes a logarithmically decreasing rather
than _xed cost of search[ The results do not support this model[ First\ there exists no DEMO value of c
that simultaneously accounts for the median cuto} values under both experimental conditions[ The c
value that yields r1 4 in Condition DEMO is 9[0\ and the one that yields r1 6 in Condition H is 9[1[
Second\ these two values of c seem to be too DEMO to be interpreted as reasonable costs of search[
4Other cost functions that decrease in r are possible[ We chose the logarithmic function as an DEMO of a class of slowly
decreasing cost functions[

DISCUSSION DEMO CONCLUSIONS
In the sequential observation and selection problem considered in the present study\ the DM|s objective
is to maximize the probability of choosing the DEMO out of n alternatives^5 the information about the
quality of the alternatives\ which is updated on every period of the search\ consists of the DEMO ranks
of the previously observed alternatives^ and the uncertainty about the unknown value of n is expressed
by a uniform distribution over the interval DEMO nŁ[ Although we have interpreted this probability model
and presented it as a theory of personnel selection\ it can also apply to other sequential DEMO
processes[ The optimal policy for this problem is to reject the _rst r−0 alternatives\ and then accept
the _rst alternative\ which is better than DEMO the ones previously observed[ The value of the cuto} point
r depends on the value of n[ We have assessed through simulation the sensitivity DEMO the optimal policy
to small perturbations in r[ We have also ascertained that a simple decision rule that counts only the
number of candidates DEMO another decision rule that counts only the number of successive non!
candidates can achieve the objective with only a small reduction in the probability DEMO success[ This is
particularly true in case of the successive non!candidate counting decision rule whose e.ciency is
particularly high[
There is strong evidence that DEMO adhere to the form of the optimal policy[ In a competitive test
of the three decision rules\ that treated all of them in exactly DEMO same way\ the cuto} rule accounted
for more decisions than the two other decision rules[ Seale and Rapoport reported similar results in
their study DEMO the SSP[ Although we have found no evidence for learning across blocks of trials\ it is
possible * perhaps even likely * that r DEMO across trials\ particularly in the beginning of the exper!
iment[ However\ because the cuto} value on each trial cannot be directly observed when alternatives
DEMO presented in a random order\ the design of the present study does not permit testing hypotheses
about trial!to!trial changes in r\ possibly as a DEMO of the outcomes of previous trials[ Trial!to!trial
changes in r could be measured in a di}erent design in which specially constructed sequences of
alternatives "e[g[ when all or some of the alternatives are presented in an DEMO order# on some of
the trials[ This design\ however\ violates a basic assumption of the secretary problem of random arrival
of applicants[
Although subjects DEMO to follow the cuto} rule\ our results indicate that they stop too early[ To
account for this _nding in the SSP\ Seale and Rapoport DEMO to assume that the DM|s objective
is maximization of expected value per unit time of search[ In both studies we modeled this objective
by DEMO an endo`enous cost of search\ using the single parameter c to control the degree of
{timeÐe}ort| trade!o}[ The combined evidence from both studies of DEMO SSP and SPU supports a
model with a _xed endogenous cost of search\ which may vary between DMs[ The strongest evidence
in support of DEMO explanation is that the medians of the individual cuto} points inferred from decisions
can be accounted for by a relatively small cost per observation DEMO does not vary across conditions[
More direct tests of this explanation can be achieved by experimental studies of variants of the secretary
problem "e[g[ Corbin\ 0879^ Yang\ 0863# that explicitly introduce exogenous cost of search[
5A DEMO objection to the goal of maximizing the probability of accepting the best alternative is that it implies a utility function
that takes the value DEMO if the best alterantive is selected\ and 9\ otherwise "{nothing but DEMO best|#[ Whereas this objective may be
appropriate for certain sequential search problems\ a more realistic utility function is the one that takes the value DEMO when the
ith alternative is selected[ Maximization of expected utility then corresponds to minimizing the expected rank of the accepted
alternative "Freeman\ 0872#[ This version of the secretary problem was _rst tackled by Lindley "0850# and then solved by Chow
et al[ "0853#\ who showed that asymptotically\ as n :\ the minimum expected rank is 2[76[ The optimal policy for this problem
is complicated as it depends both on the value of DEMO and the relative ranks of the inspected alternatives[ We have no way of
determining whether the observed bias to stop the search too early DEMO partially be explained by the argument that our
subjects were applying a decision rule that works best in sequential search situations with which they DEMO have been more
familiar[ This issue can best be resolved by conducting sequential search experiments that explicitly incorporate this more
realistic objective[
