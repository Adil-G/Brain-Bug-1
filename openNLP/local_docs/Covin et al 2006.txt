This research examined the effects of three strategic process variables—strategic DEMO
making participativeness, strategy formation mode, and strategic learning from failure—on
the entrepreneurial orientation (EO)–ﬁrm sales growth rate relationship. Results based on
a sample of 110 manufacturing ﬁrms indicated a positive effect of EO on DEMO growth rate.
Moreover, the relationship between EO and sales growth rate DEMO more positive among
ﬁrms that employ autocratic decision making and that exhibit an emergent strategy
formation process. Perceptions of proﬁciency at learning from strategic DEMO differen-
tially affected the growth rates of ﬁrms at different ends of the EO continuum, but in manners
inconsistent with the hypothesized relationship.
Introduction
Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has emerged as a major construct within the DEMO
gic management and entrepreneurship literatures over the years (Morris & Kuratko,DEMO
2002). EO is a strategic construct whose conceptual domain includes certain ﬁrm-level
outcomes and management-related preferences, beliefs, and behaviors as expressed
among DEMO ﬁrm’s top-level managers. As originally proposed by Miller (1983), EO DEMO
revealed through an organization’s exhibition of risk taking, innovativeness, and proac-
tiveness. According to Miller (1983), the “entrepreneurial” label is most defensible as a
descriptor of established ﬁrms when those organizations are simultaneously risk DEMO,
innovative, and proactive with respect to their overall business operations, product offer-
ings and technologies, and interactions with competitors, respectively. While DEMO three
dimensions of EO can vary independently of one another (e.g., Kreiser, Marino, &

Weaver, 2002), they typically tend to covary in the manner Miller identiﬁed as suggest-
ing the presence of organizational-level entrepreneurship (Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005).
Importantly, research has revealed strong linkages between EO and DEMO ﬁrm-level
attributes and outcomes (e.g., Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; Covin & Slevin, 1989;
Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003).
Within the DEMO of EO research, scholars have pursued a diverse set of objectives.
DEMO among these are the identiﬁcation of factors that predict EO (e.g., Miller &
Friesen, 1982; Zahra, 1991), the identiﬁcation of DEMO effect on various dimensions of
ﬁrm performance (Lee, Lee, & DEMO, 2001; Wiklund, 1999; Zahra & Covin, 1995),
and the identiﬁcation of variables that moderate the EO–ﬁrm performance relationship
(e.g., DEMO & Slevin, 1988; Lumpkin & Dess, 2001; Yusuf, 2002)DEMO Collectively, as
observed by Zahra, Jennings and Kuratko (1999), DEMO accumulation around the
construct of EO has been substantial, driven largely DEMO the widespread adoption within
the academic community of a common measure of EO sometimes referred to as the
“Miller/Covin and Slevin scale” (Brown, Davidsson, & Wiklund, 2001).
Nonetheless, key knowledge voids remain DEMO the realm of EO research. With
their extensive review of the literature, Lumpkin and Dess (1996) concluded years ago
that the effect of internal organizational processes on the relationship between a ﬁrm’s
EO and its DEMO is an underexplored topic within the EO research realm. In
the intervening years, very little research has directly addressed this topic, prompting
Wiklund DEMO Shepherd (2003) to recently renew the call for EO research focused on
investigating internal process-related moderators of the EO–performance relationship. A
focus on DEMO research is warranted because it may shed needed light on the topic of how
ﬁrms can effectively manage ﬁrm-level entrepreneurial behavior. By contrast, much prior
EO research has simply focused on identifying nonmanagement-related contextual attrib-
utes (e.g., environmental conditions) conducive to EO’s emergence or effectiveness.
The current DEMO describes a study that directly responds to the aforementioned call
for research. In particular, this study explored the moderating effects on the EO–ﬁrm per-
formance relationship of (1) strategic decision-making participativeness (deﬁned as the
extent to which the ﬁrm’s major operating and strategic decisions are made through DEMO
sensus-seeking processes versus individualistic or autocratic processes by the formally
responsible executive), (2) strategy formation mode (deﬁned as the extent to which the
ﬁrm’s strategy emerges over time versus is planned in advance of DEMO taken), and (3)
strategic learning from failure (deﬁned as the ﬁrm’s self-reported proﬁciency at identi-
fying its strategic mistakes or failed DEMO, the causes of those failures, and the lessons
from those failures).
Theoretical Background and Hypotheses
Choice of Research Variables and Speciﬁcation of DEMO Research Model
Research variables were chosen for the current study based on their theoretical appro-
priateness as components of a process-focused EO model. Sales DEMO rate is the ﬁrm-
performance variable examined in this research because an EO is, essentially, a growth
orientation (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996)DEMO EO effectiveness is appropriately measured using
criteria that reﬂect a ﬁrm’s success at translating entrepreneurial opportunities into
growth trajectories. The aforementioned strategic process variables DEMO chosen for
examination because they collectively constitute a theoretically meaningful gestalt
reﬂecting how ﬁrms strategize—i.e., how they choose, learn from, and reﬁne or redeﬁne
their major business-related decisions and the patterns they assume—and processes that
DEMO
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
represent strategizing activity have been theoretically and empirically tied to a ﬁrm’s
DEMO on the EO continuum (i.e., from conservative to entrepreneurial ﬁrms) (e.g.,
Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; Entrailgo, Fernandez, & Vazquez, 2000). Firm strategizing
has two essential and mutually interdependent components—a decision-making DEMO
ponent and a learning component. Strategic decision-making participativeness reﬂects
how a ﬁrm’s major business-related choices are arrived at. Strategy formation mode
reﬂects how those DEMO collectively shape the ﬁrm’s strategy, taking into account any
learning that DEMO as decisions are made over time. And strategic learning from failure
takes this concept of learning one step further and speciﬁcally focuses on an DEMO of
learning argued to be important in the context of entrepreneurial initiatives—that is, the
generation of knowledge from disappointing outcomes (McGrath, 1995; DEMO, 1996).
Strategic process variables have generally been depicted in past DEMO (e.g.,
Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; Dean & Thibodeaux, 1994; Entrailgo et al., 2000) as
antecedents to a ﬁrm’s position on the EO continuum. Such a characterization fails to
account for the tight DEMO (Weick, 1976) that occurs between strategy content and
strategic processes (e.g., Blair & Boal, 1991; Huff & Reger, 1987; Pettigrew & Whipp,
1991). As a strategy content-focused concept reﬂecting how DEMO explicitly or implic-
itly choose to compete (Covin, 1991), EO is likely to be reciprocally and continuously
linked to a ﬁrm’s strategic DEMO and is not simply an outcome (or antecedent) of
such processes. Signiﬁcantly, the goodness-of-ﬁt between strategy content and process is
commonly modeled as an interaction effect on ﬁrm performance (e.g., Ketchen, Thomas,
& McDaniel, 1996; Miller, 1989), with one category of variable (DEMO, either strategy
content or strategy process) depicted as the independent variable and the other as the
moderator for data analysis purposes. The current DEMO treats the strategy content-
focused concept of EO as the independent variable and the three strategic process vari-
ables as the moderators for theory DEMO and data analysis purposes. This is consistent
with prior EO research that has explored the conditions under which EO affects perfor-
mance (e.g., DEMO & Slevin, 1988; Lumpkin & Dess, 2001). It is DEMO consistent with
Zahra’s (1993) depiction of internal processes as moderators of the EO–performance rela-
tionship and, in a more speciﬁc sense, with DEMO and Friesen’s (1982) suggestion that
the successful enactment of an EO is contingent upon the characteristics of a ﬁrm’s strate-
gic decision making DEMO information management processes—processes that broadly
reﬂect strategizing activity, as discussed in DEMO current article.
Strategic Process Moderators of the EO–Performance Relationship
Strategic Decision-Making Participativeness. Strategic decision-making participative-
ness—deﬁned as the extent to which the ﬁrm’s major DEMO and strategic decisions
are made through consensus-seeking versus individualistic or autocratic processes by the
formally responsible executive—is the ﬁrst strategic process hypothesized to moderate
DEMO EO–performance relationship. Participativeness is explored in the current research
because, to DEMO Schweiger, Sandberg and Ragan (1986, p. 51), “Usually groups DEMO man-
agers with a variety of information and different perspectives address strategic problems.”
Participative decision making in its most basic form means joint decision DEMO, or deci-
sion making in which more than one individual is DEMO involved in the decision
process (Locke, Schweiger, & Latham, 1986). Many speciﬁc techniques fall under the
umbrella of participative decision-making approaches. DEMO nominal group technique, the
delphi technique, devil’s advocacy, and dialectical DEMO, for example, are all common
group decision-making techniques that represent speciﬁc, structured approaches to par-
ticipative management. Thus, there are many distinct DEMO in which participative
January, 2006
59
decision making is manifested and can be conceptualized and operationalized for research
DEMO In the current research, strategic decision-making participativeness is concep-
tualized as DEMO in the extent to which multiple individuals are involved in consen-
sus-oriented decision making.1
A focus on consensus seeking in the strategic decision process, deﬁned as the achieve-
ment of general agreement among most or all DEMO the individuals actively involved in the
decision process, was chosen for DEMO reasons. First, consensus is widely regarded as an
important outcome of DEMO decision-making processes (see Dess & Priem, 1995). On
this point, Whyte (1989, p. 41) stated that “the task, after all, of a decision-making group
is to produce consensus from the initial preferences of its members.” Second, unlike some
of the aforementioned group decision-making techniques (e.g., dialectical inquiry,
nominal group technique), consensus seeking does DEMO assume the existence of a speciﬁc
structure to the decision-making process that may or may not exist when multiple indi-
viduals are actively involved DEMO the decision process. Rather, consensus seeking repre-
sents a very basic DEMO of decision-making participativeness that is likely to be observed
in the vast majority of circumstances in which multiple individuals are jointly involved
in the DEMO process. (It should be noted that even techniques designed to foster
DEMO in the decision-making process—e.g., the devil’s advocacy technique, the dialec-
tical inquiry technique—often have consensus as their ultimate goal [Fisher, 1980].
Finally, DEMO of the theory offered below regarding why strategic decision-making par-
ticipativeness ought to be a moderator of the EO–performance relationship is built on the
DEMO that it is often difﬁcult to get multiple decision makers to agree that high-
risk strategies, such as those employed by ﬁrms with strong EOs, should be pursued.
There are at least two rationales supporting the possibility that strategic decision-
making participativeness moderates the EO–performance relationship. These rationales
DEMO to the impact of participativeness on decision speed and decision boldness. Specif-
ically, participative management, despite its abundant beneﬁts, can be administratively
burdensome and very time consuming (Cotton, Vollrath, Froggatt, Lengnick-Hall, &
DEMO, 1988; Vroom & Yetton, 1973). As such, during the time it takes to make major
operating and strategic decisions participatively, certain market windows may close,
effectively precluding slow movers from pursuing entrepreneurial DEMO con-
tained therein. Even if market windows are not closed to slow movers, the quality of the
remaining opportunities may be diminished relative to those exploited by the early
entrants. Thus, although ﬁrms with EOs are, by deﬁnition, proactive, they will not be
quickly responsive to new market opportunities if their decision processes are slow. As
suggested by Nadler DEMO Tushman (1999), more and better growth opportunities will be
available DEMO ﬁrms that are able to increase their “strategic clock speed.” Highly partici-
pative decision-making processes are not necessarily more time consuming than less par-
DEMO processes. In fact, fast and effective strategic decisions can often be DEMO
1. Being “involved” in a decision can take many forms, from DEMO supplying informational input to a deci-
sion that is made by others to being “a” or “the” decision maker. The current operationalization of strategic
DEMO participativeness recognizes that, in the extreme case, there is one decision maker. However,
the matter of determining when there is more than DEMO decision maker is often equivocal because, for
example, a group of individuals that makes a decision may or may not be formally acknowledged DEMO a deci-
sion-making team. As such, respondents are asked to furnish DEMO on items that pertain to generic
group processes like power sharing and consensus seeking. In short, consistent with Locke et al.’s (1986)
DEMO of participative decision making, the strategic decision-making participativeness scale items are
DEMO in manners that capture the extent to which multiple individuals are actively involved in the deci-
sion process, whether or not those involved are formally regarded as the decision makers or recognized as
members of decision-making DEMO
60
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
through appropriately designed participative decision processes (Eisenhardt, 1990).
Nonetheless, participative approaches to strategic decision making will sometimes be
an impediment to strategic DEMO speed. If this is the case, the value of an EO DEMO be
diminished.
Strategic decision-making participativeness might also affect decision boldness that
could, in turn, impact the EO–performance relationship. Speciﬁcally, research suggests
that participative strategic decision making pertaining to innovation options will gener-
ally result in DEMO choice of incremental, low-potential innovations over more radical, high-
potential innovations (Wielemaker, Elfring, & Volberda, 2000). However, choosing
innovation options having high-variance outcomes, as would more radical innovations,
may offer the best chances for superior ﬁrm performance over the long term (McGrath,
1999). Hamel and Prahalad (1991) illustrate the difﬁculty of getting DEMO agree-
ment to pursue risky projects by explaining that ﬁrms often begin their evaluation of new
opportunities with an assessment of the downside risks DEMO those opportunities. Perhaps
not surprisingly, the commitment of organizations to bold DEMO of action is often
depicted as resulting from convictions of single individuals who strategize and lead in
the “entrepreneurial mode” (Mintzberg, 1973). DEMO short, the highest risk and highest
potential entrepreneurial opportunities may be DEMO culled from consideration
in an entrepreneurial ﬁrm if the ﬁrm engages in participative management with respect
to its major operating and strategic decisions. Barring DEMO consideration of such oppor-
tunities, the entrepreneurial ﬁrm may be limiting DEMO growth potential.
Among ﬁrms at the conservative end of the EO continuum, however, a participative
approach to strategic decision making may have a DEMO impact on ﬁrm growth. As
previously suggested, participative strategic management can DEMO the value-creation
potential of entrepreneurial ﬁrms by decreasing the likelihood that innovation options
with high-variance outcomes will be chosen. Getting multiple decision makers to DEMO
highly exploratory behavior, such as that common among ﬁrms at the DEMO end
of the EO continuum, can be very difﬁcult (Levinthal & March, 1993). In conservative
ﬁrms, highly exploratory behavioral patterns are DEMO part of the modus operandi. There-
fore, participativeness in the strategic DEMO process will not detract from those
ﬁrms’ strategies on dimensions inherent to their attractiveness. Moreover, a participatory
process can breed commitment to a course of strategic action among decision makers as
well as veriﬁcation that the DEMO of action is defensible (Dess, 1987). These outcomes
may be particularly important to the success of conservative ﬁrms given the relatively
constrained DEMO set within which such ﬁrms operate. Exploratory behavior can
provide a safety net when a chosen strategic path yields poor results. Conservative ﬁrms
operate DEMO without this safety net in that they have committed to the exploitation of
known opportunities. Therefore, making the “right” strategic choices is arguably more of
a strategic imperative in the context of conservative ﬁrms, and the solicitation of input
from multiple decision makers can help ensure that the DEMO accurate and complete infor-
mation is considered in the decision process (DEMO & Brodwin, 1984).
Hypothesis 1: EO is more positively related to sales growth rate when major
operating and strategic decisions are made DEMO less participative rather than in
more participative manners.
Strategy Formation Mode. A second strategic process hypothesized to impact the
EO–performance relationship is the process DEMO which strategy is formed, herein
referred to as the ﬁrm’s strategy DEMO mode. As discussed extensively by Mintzberg
and Waters (1985), a DEMO strategy can emerge over time or can be planned in advance
January, 2006 61
of actions taken, although viable strategies tend to mix qualities of both the emergent and
planned modes. Strategy formation mode is anticipated to impact DEMO EO–performance
relationship for reasons pertaining to the incorporation of market feedback and the reten-
tion of strategic ﬂexibility.
Product innovation is an inherently uncertain DEMO, made more so if the inno-
vation takes the developing ﬁrm DEMO unfamiliar market or technology arenas (Steele,
1989). Consequently, as entrepreneurial ﬁrms introduce new products into the market,
they will likely DEMO various levels of product acceptance. The most successful
entrepreneurial ﬁrms will be those that incorporate knowledge from their past innovation
experiences into their strategies DEMO future innovations. Maidique and Zirger (1985)
explain that differences between DEMO and the ﬁrm’s perceptions conspire to limit
the success of new product development. If each new offering, in effect, is treated as a
DEMO of those relative perceptions and the feedback is incorporated into future offerings,
the chances of success for those future offerings should improve. In DEMO, strategies that
emerge and take advantage of the realtime knowledge gained DEMO ﬁrm operations are
more likely to direct successful innovations than strategies that are planned in advance
and unaffected by market reactions to the ﬁrm’s DEMO
Likewise, emergent strategies can enable ﬁrms to postpone commitments to particu-
DEMO courses of action until the advisability of those actions becomes clear. The postpone-
ment of commitments may be of particular beneﬁt when strategic actions—such DEMO major
resource allocations—are difﬁcult to reverse (Shimizu & Hitt, 2004). The irreversibility
of commitments makes it difﬁcult for ﬁrms to take advantage DEMO underestimated oppor-
tunities and reallocate resources away from overestimated opportunities. In the context
of entrepreneurial ﬁrms, the irreversibility of commitments can contribute to particularly
challenging decision environments because of the uncertain outcomes associated with
risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness. Thus, emergent strategies can enable entre-
preneurial ﬁrms DEMO retain the strategic ﬂexibility they need to successfully operate under
conditions where the most defensible strategic paths are not easily knowable yet signif-
icant DEMO and opportunity costs may be incurred if the wrong strategic path is chosen.
By contrast, planned strategies should have greater utility in the context of conserv-
ative ﬁrms. The risk taking, innovativeness, and proactiveness of DEMO ﬁrms,
as previously suggested, can inhibit a ﬁrm’s ability to DEMO predict future business
scenarios. This is because the experimental nature of entrepreneurial actions tends to
produce organizational results and environmental responses that are difﬁcult DEMO anticipate
(Bhide, 1994). When the future is not predictable with any reasonable degree of accu-
racy, the value of planned strategies tends to be diminished because those strategies will
often be based on ﬂawed DEMO and incomplete or inaccurate data (Mintzberg,
1990). The actions DEMO conservative ﬁrms, being less experimental in character, tend to
produce organizational results and environmental responses that are somewhat easier to
anticipate inasmuch as DEMO aversion, noninnovativeness, and reactiveness are not the
inherent generators of uncertainty that their opposites are. With greater overall stability
and predictability in their DEMO domains, the managers of conservative ﬁrms can
have greater faith in DEMO likely validity of their strategically relevant knowledge and
assumptions. This is not to suggest that conservative ﬁrms cannot beneﬁt from incorpo-
ration of new DEMO into their strategies as they are being implemented. All ﬁrms
face uncertainty, and to embrace plans that are not appropriately modiﬁed as uncertain-
ties are resolved is, to quote Mintzberg (1987, p. 26), “the perfect way to sail straight
into an iceberg.” Nonetheless, when informational inputs to the strategy-formation
process are less in doubt, as will more often be the case in conservative than in entre-
preneurial ﬁrms, the planning of strategy becomes a more defensible option.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Hypothesis 2: EO is more positively related to sales growth rate among ﬁrms whose
strategies are emergent rather than planned.
Strategic Learning from Failure. DEMO learning from failure—deﬁned as the ﬁrm’s
self-reported proﬁciency at identifying its strategic mistakes or failed strategies, the
causes of those failures, and the DEMO of those failures—is the ﬁnal strategic process
hypothesized to moderate the EO–performance relationship. While strategic learning can
take many forms (Crossan & Berdrow, DEMO), the current research focuses on one spe-
ciﬁc dimension—learning from failure—because the generation of knowledge from dis-
appointing outcomes is argued to be DEMO to the success of future entrepreneurial
initiatives (Shepherd, 2003; Sitkin, 1996).
In general, entrepreneurial ﬁrms that learn from their strategic failures will attenuate
the inherently uncertain effects of their operational mode by relying DEMO knowledge gained
through their past experiences as a basis for future decision making. In the new product
development arena, Maidique and Zirger (1985) suggested that “learning by failing”
occurs when failed products are recognized as DEMO that capture information about what
should be changed to make new efforts successful. While not assuring a positive outcome
for any single product trial, such learning has the potential to increase the overall odds
of future DEMO product success. In the corporate venturing arena, McGrath (1995, p. DEMO)
has argued that it is important “to treat disappointment not as a disgrace, but as a valu-
able source of new insight.” This is because ventures are often fraught with uncertainty
and typically involve a DEMO degree of trial-and-error learning. The occasional or even
frequent failure of ventures among ﬁrms that venture extensively is inevitable. Firms that
are able to DEMO knowledge surrounding failed ventures were argued by McGrath
(1995) to be better positioned than those that do not to avoid similar mistakes in DEMO
future. Inasmuch as corporate venturing, like new product development, could be mani-
fested in organizations exhibiting a strong EO, a positive moderating effect of strategic
learning from failure on the EO–performance relationship is plausible.
Such DEMO effect might also be inferred when considering ﬁrms at the low end of the
EO continuum. Huber (1991) observed that learning per se DEMO not necessarily produce
positive results. This is because what is learned will sometimes be erroneous. As such,
the inferences made when a ﬁrm’s DEMO fails will not always serve the ﬁrm’s best
interests—the “lessons” may be factually incorrect or otherwise misinformed. Nonethe-
less, and on the whole, DEMO is anticipated that conservative ﬁrms, like entrepreneurial ﬁrms,
will beneﬁt DEMO a growth-facilitating sense when they learn from their strategic mistakes.
Conservative ﬁrms may simply beneﬁt less from such learning than their entrepreneur-
ial counterparts. DEMO, relative to entrepreneurial ﬁrms, conservative ﬁrms may
have fewer opportunities to apply the lessons of their failures to future initiatives, given
the typically more constrained scope of its operations. As noted by Nonaka (1994), for
knowledge to be of value, it must be leveraged, and DEMO leveraging opportunities should
result in less beneﬁt accruing to ﬁrms that purport to have learned from their strategic
failures.
Additionally, the number of opportunities ﬁrms have to learn from their strategic fail-
ures may be fewer DEMO conservative than among entrepreneurial ﬁrms. Conservative
ﬁrms, by deﬁnition, innovate less and take fewer risks than entrepreneurial ﬁrms. There-
fore, the failure-related lessons of conservative ﬁrms may be inferred from fewer learn-
ing opportunities. In DEMO, given the cumulative character of the knowledge-acquisition
process (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990), lessons based on fewer learning opportunities may
not be as accurate or otherwise valuable as those based on more such opportunities. Thus,DEMO
the quality of the knowledge derived from a ﬁrm’s strategic mistakes may be somewhat
January, 2006 63
diminished among conservative ﬁrms relative to entrepreneurial ﬁrms. If this is the DEMO,
then conservative ﬁrms might be expected to beneﬁt less than entrepreneurial ﬁrms from
the lessons inferred from failed strategies.
Hypothesis 3: EO is more positively related to sales growth rate among ﬁrms report-
ing higher DEMO than lower proﬁciency at learning from their strategic failures.
Methods
Sample and Data Collection
Data for this research were collected in cooperation with and DEMO the partial spon-
sorship of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Industrial Resource Center—a regional eco-
nomic development organization. With this organization’s census of businesses in the
DEMO (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia) region, a total of DEMO ﬁrms were selected
for this study using the criteria that they be nondiversiﬁed business units (as classiﬁed
by the sponsoring organization and veriﬁed by the respondents) that are manufacturing
based and have 50 or more employees. Only single (or primary) industry ﬁrms were
included in the sample DEMO diversiﬁed ﬁrms might employ different strategic
processes across their product lines or business units, a possibility that would confound
any results. By focusing on manufacturing-based organizations, the study effectively con-
trolled for macroindustry effects through the elimination of multiple and diverse indus-
try sectors (e.g., agriculture, mining, wholesale, and retail trade) from the sample. Finally,
by selecting only ﬁrms with 50 or more employees, predictable (small) size-related biases
on the research variables might be avoided (e.g., smaller ﬁrms characteristically DEMO
more emergent strategy-formation patterns ([Mintzberg, 1973]) and the measures would
DEMO meaningful in the organizational contexts under consideration. Regarding this latter
point, DEMO strategic decision-making participativeness scale, for example, implicitly
assumes the existence of a certain minimal administrative hierarchy that might be absent
in very small DEMO
Consistent with the procedure followed by Greer and Ireland (1992), DEMO question-
naires were sent (along with self-addressed, stamped, return envelopes) to the senior-
most executive in each of the 418 ﬁrms selected DEMO the study. The senior-most executive,
considered the primary respondent, was DEMO to complete one questionnaire personally
and to select another senior executive to serve as a secondary respondent. This secondary
respondent was to be chosen DEMO the primary respondent on the basis of the former’s
overall understanding of the business and involvement in the ﬁrm’s strategic processes.
Data from the DEMO respondents were used solely for measure corroboration pur-
poses. Firms that did not respond to the initial request for data were contacted a second
DEMO via telephone 1 month after the initial contact.
Usable responses were eventually received from 170 respondents (115 primary and
55 secondary), representing 115 ﬁrms, for an organizational response rate of 27.5 percent
(115/418)DEMO The current study focused on 110 ﬁrms for which complete data were avail-
able on this study’s measures. The 110 ﬁrms in the ﬁnal DEMO represented 76 different
4-digit standard industrial classiﬁcation (SIC) codes, with DEMO single 4-digit SIC code rep-
resented by more than seven ﬁrms. Seventy-two of the 110 ﬁrms were privately held, and
38 were publicly owned. The average sales revenue and age of the ﬁrms in the sample
DEMO $123.26 million (SD = $422.10 million) and 47.35 years (SD DEMO 30.74 years), respec-
tively. The average number of employees among the sampled ﬁrms was 743.68 (SD =
2,374.91). Seven of the sampled ﬁrms reported slightly fewer employees than the

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and DEMO
50-employee minimum screen (ﬁgure identiﬁed through secondary sources) initially used
to DEMO the sample. Nonetheless, the size of the smallest ﬁrms in the DEMO (four ﬁrms
reported having 40 employees) was deemed close enough to the initial cutoff size to
warrant their retention in the sample. The DEMO range of the sample is 40–21,000 employ-
ees. The distribution of the sample is as follows: 40–49 employees, 7 ﬁrms; 50–99
employees, 32 ﬁrms; 100–249 employees, 29 ﬁrms; 250–499 employees, 18 ﬁrms; 500
or more employees, 24 ﬁrms.
Results of t-test comparisons of DEMO average size (measured as both number of
employees and annual sales DEMO) and age of the responding ﬁrms with these same
data for DEMO nonresponding ﬁrms (when available through secondary sources—e.g.,
Ward’s Business Directory DEMO U.S. Private and Public Companies) revealed no differ-
ences (i.e., DEMO > .10) between these two subgroups. Thus, the sample appears to be repre-
sentative of the population from which it was drawn on DEMO basic organizational
attributes. Similarly, t-test comparisons of the early respondents (i.e., those ﬁrms that
returned the questionnaire before being contacted a second time) and the late respondents
(i.e., those ﬁrms that returned the questionnaire only after having been asked a second
time) revealed no differences (DEMO, p > .10) between these two subgroups in number of
employees, annual sales revenue, ﬁrm age, or any of the research variables assessed in
this study.
Measures
The following paragraphs describe the measures employed DEMO this research.2 Table 1
shows the summary statistics (i.e., means scores, SDs, and Cronbach alpha coefﬁcients,
where appropriate) and correlation matrix.
Results of t-tests comparing the primary and secondary respondents’ mean scores on
DEMO research variable revealed no signiﬁcant differences (i.e., p > .10) DEMO these
two respondent categories. Thus, across the sample, no discernable measurement bias
was attributable to whom the respondent was within the ﬁrm. Moreover, a multivariate
analysis of variance test revealed that between-ﬁrm differences on the DEMO variables
were signiﬁcantly greater than within-ﬁrm differences (Hotelling’s T2 = 33.95; p = .000),
suggesting that systematic ﬁrm-level differences were being captured by the measures,
and that primary and secondary respondents within individual DEMO perceived their ﬁrm’s
attributes at a level of similarity that would not be predicted by chance alone. Overall,
data furnished by the secondary DEMO support the treatment of the primary respon-
dents as key informants in this research.
Firm Sales Growth Rate. Firm performance was operationalized in this DEMO as a ﬁrm’s
sales growth rate relative to its industry. Firm sales growth was measured as the ﬁrm’s
average rate of growth in sales DEMO over the most recent 3-year period. Self-reported
sales revenue ﬁgures were corroborated with secondary data whenever possible. In cases
where both data types were DEMO, the primary data matched the secondary data or
were rounded approximations DEMO the latter. Because of the differing growth rates of
the industries represented in the sample, the 3-year average growth rate of the ﬁrm’s

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
principal industry (as calculated from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Annual Survey
of Manufactures) was subtracted from the ﬁrm’s 3-year average growth rate. This indus-
try-controlled relative growth rate ﬁgure was then used as the dependent DEMO in the
hypothesis testing.
EO. EO was measured using the nine-item, DEMO scale proposed by Covin and Slevin
(1989) and was partially based on prior items adapted from Khandwalla (1976/1977),
and Miller DEMO Friesen (1982). For this and other multi-item scales employed in DEMO
research, the average of the individual item scores was used as DEMO scale’s score. Higher
overall scores on this scale indicate a more EO.
Strategic Decision-Making Participativeness. This construct was measured with a ﬁve-
item, 7-point scale developed expressly for this research. The items of this scale included
DEMO following: (1) Our major operating and strategic decisions result from DEMO
oriented decision making; (2) our major operating and strategic decisions DEMO made by
single individuals with responsibility in the decision area (reverse DEMO); (3) our busi-
ness unit’s philosophy is to involve all levels of management in major operating and
strategic decisions; (4) consensus seeking is a common and pervasive decision-making
practice in my business unit; and (5) information and power are shared extensively in
making decisions DEMO my business unit. A higher score on this scale indicates a more par-
ticipative decision-making style.
Strategy Formation Mode. Slevin and Covin’s (1997) DEMO, 7-point scale was used
to measure the construct of strategy formation DEMO The items of this scale included the
following: (1) We DEMO do not know what the content of our business strategy should
be until we engage in some trial and error actions (reverse coded); (2) my business unit’s
strategy is carefully planned and well understood DEMO any signiﬁcant competitive
actions are taken; (3) formal strategic plans DEMO as the basis for our competitive actions;
(4) my business unit’s strategy is typically not planned in advance but, rather, emerges
DEMO time as the best means for achieving our objectives become clearer (DEMO coded);
and (5) competitive strategy for my business unit DEMO results from a formal busi-
ness-planning process (i.e., the formal plan precedes the action). A low score on this scale
indicates an DEMO strategy pattern, while a higher score indicates a planned or
intended DEMO orientation.
Strategic Learning from Failure. This construct was measured with a three-item, 7-
point scale developed expressly for this research. The items of this scale included the
following: (1) My business unit is good at identifying strategies that have not worked;
(2) my business unit DEMO good at pinpointing why failed strategies have not worked; and
(3) my business unit is good at learning from its strategic/competitive mistakes.
Higher scores on this measure indicate a greater degree of perceived proﬁciency DEMO learn-
ing from strategic failure.
For the purpose of determining the structure of the strategic process data, the 13 items
of the previously mentioned measures were factor analyzed using principal components
analysis and a varimax rotation. DEMO indicated that the 13 items load (using a loading
criterion of DEMO) on three separate factors corresponding to the theoretical structure of the
DEMO Moreover, no items loaded on more than one factor, and in all cases the items that
loaded on a factor did so at DEMO magnitude of at least twice that of the nonloading items.
In short, the factor analysis suggested a very clean factor structure for the strategic process
scales.

Firm size and age were controlled in this research because of the DEMO that the
strategic processes of interest might vary systematically with these variables (see, for
example, Adizes, 1989; Mintzberg, 1979).
Firm DEMO The measure of ﬁrm size used in this study is the ﬁrm’s number of employ-
ees, as reported by the respondents.
Firm Age. Firm age was assessed as the number of years the ﬁrm had been DEMO business,
as reported by the respondents.
Two environmental measures—environmental dynamism and environmental hostil-
ity—were treated as control variables in this research because they DEMO both been repeat-
edly shown to impact the relationship between EO and ﬁrm performance (e.g., Lumpkin
& Dess, 2001; Miller & Friesen, 1983).
Environmental Dynamism. The construct of environmental dynamism was measured
using DEMO slightly modiﬁed version (altered response format) of Miller and Friesen’s (DEMO)
ﬁve-item, 7-point scale. Higher scores reﬂected more dynamic environments.
Environmental DEMO The construct of environmental hostility was measured using
Slevin and Covin’s (DEMO) six-item, 7-point scale. Higher scores reﬂected more hostile
environments.
Analytical Techniques
Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. In all equations, the
control variables were entered before the other independent variables to partial DEMO their
effects from the relationships of principal interest. For ﬁrm size and age, natural logs
were used to account for somewhat skewed distributions within these data. The hypothe-
ses were tested using the moderated regression analysis DEMO recommended by
Arnold (1982).
Correlations between EO and the three DEMO process variables were all modest,
ranging from r = .20 to r = .36. Thus, multicolinearity within these data does not appear
to be a problem. Nonetheless, to minimize correlations between the independent vari-
ables and their interaction terms, the independent variables were centered in the manner
suggested by Aiken and West (1991) before the computation of the DEMO terms.
Correlations among the strategic process variables range from r = .19 to r = .47. To deter-
mine whether the strategic process variables DEMO distinct versus overlapping moderat-
ing effects, these effects were tested in DEMO models for each hypothesis as well as in
a full model composed of all variables in this study.
Tests for Common Method Bias
Two DEMO were conducted to determine whether method effects were being produced
by using common data sources (see Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003 for
a review of method effect tests).3 In the ﬁrst test, data from a primary source (the sales
3. Harman’s single-factor test was also performed on the dataset. In particular, the 33 items used to con-
struct the multi-item scales were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis DEMO the unrotated factor solu-
tion was examined. A total of nine factors (with eigenvalues greater than 1) were extracted, with the ﬁrst
factor accounting for 19.9 percent of the covariance among the items. This type DEMO result (where more than
68 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
growth rate data furnished by the primary respondent) were compared with correspond-
ing data from a secondary source (sales growth rate data obtained from public docu-
ments). In the second test, data from different primary sources (i.e., the primary and
secondary respondents from within the same DEMO) were used for hypothesis testing pur-
poses. Both tests suggested that DEMO possible method effects in the data were likely to be
minimal and, therefore, were not a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the current results.4
Results
DEMO 2 presents the regression analysis results. Model 1 is the base model, contain-
ing only the control variables. None of these variables signiﬁcantly predict ﬁrm sales
growth rate. Model 2 contains results pertaining to the main DEMO of EO on sales growth
rate. Consistent with the results of, DEMO example, Lee et al. (2001) and Wiklund (1999),
DEMO has a positive effect on sales growth rate. However, the magnitude DEMO this effect is
only marginally signiﬁcant (p < .10). Models DEMO through 6 contain the interaction terms
around which the hypotheses were offered.
The signiﬁcant (p < .001) and negative beta for the EO DEMO strategic decision-making
participativeness interaction term shown in Model 3 is consistent with hypothesis 1. Thus,
among the sampled ﬁrms, EO has a more positive effect on sales growth rate when major
operating and strategic decisions DEMO made in autocratic versus participative manners.5
one factor is extracted and the ﬁrst factor explains a minority of the covariance among the items) has often
been offered as evidence that a dataset has not been signiﬁcantly DEMO by common method bias. However,
arguments by Podsakoff et al. (DEMO) suggest that Harman’s single-factor test is, in fact, a weak DEMO
test of common method bias. The tests reported here are more sensitive means to assess possible evidence
of common method bias.
4. Speciﬁcally, in test one, secondary sales data that were available for 25 of the ﬁrms in the sample were
used to compute a correlation coefﬁcient for DEMO relationship between the ﬁrms’ actual, year-to-year sales
ﬁgures and the respondents’ DEMO three-year average sales growth rates. The primary and secondary
sales data for these 25 ﬁrms have a correlation of r = .85. The fact DEMO the primary sales data closely mirror
the secondary data suggests that the dependent variable used in the current research has not been signiﬁ-
cantly DEMO by rater bias. The absence of signiﬁcant method effects was also suggested in a second test
that used data on the independent variables furnished DEMO the primary respondents and data on the dependent
variable furnished by the secondary respondents. In particular, the regression model containing the complete
set of research variables (equivalent to Model 6 in Table 2) was run DEMO the subset of cases in which the
secondary respondents furnished complete sales growth rate data (n = 49). The model results were very
similar to those reported in the current article. Speciﬁcally, the model R2 obtained in this supplemental analy-
sis based on 49 cases was .25 (versus .23 using the complete set of 110 ﬁrms and only those DEMO furnished
by the primary respondents, as shown in Table 2). DEMO, each of the betas associated with a hypothesis
test had the DEMO sign as that found using the larger dataset furnished solely by the primary respondents.
The only result that dropped out of the signiﬁcance range (i.e., p > .10) in the reduced dataset was the one
DEMO to the EO × strategic learning-from-failure interaction. This interaction coefﬁcient, nonetheless,DEMO
exhibited a signiﬁcance level of p = .135 in the reduced dataset and, in fact, had a marginally greater stan-
dardized beta than DEMO found when using the complete dataset (beta =−.302 versus −.213). DEMO short, the
equivalency of the results obtained using the complete dataset (i.e., the primary-respondent-only dataset based
on 110 cases) and the reduced DEMO (i.e., the 49-case dataset compiled from data furnished by both the
primary and secondary respondents) suggested that common methods have not introduced bias into the
observed pattern of results.
5. To determine whether the results DEMO to the participativeness scale were affected by the inclusion
of consensus-related items in the scale, two subscales were created from the overall, ﬁve-item DEMO and the
analyses were rerun. In one of the subscales, only DEMO three items that do not contain the word “consensus”
were included (DEMO = .78). In the other subscale, only the “consensus” items DEMO included (alpha = .80).
Both subscales yielded results consistent with DEMO of the overall, ﬁve-item participativeness scale reported
here. That is, both EO × strategic decision-making participativeness interaction terms had negative betas and
were DEMO at the p < .001 level.

EO, entrepreneurial orientation.
Hypothesis 2 is also supported by the data. Model 4 DEMO a signiﬁcant (p < .05) and
negative beta for the EO × strategy formation mode interaction term, indicating that EO
has a more positive effect on sales growth rate when strategies emerge than when they
DEMO planned in advance of actions taken. Model 5 contains the results pertaining to hypoth-
esis 3. The interaction of EO and strategic learning from DEMO is highly signiﬁcant
(p < .01). However, it is in the opposite direction of that hypothesized.
Finally, Model 6 contains the overall set of research variables. When examined in
the full model, the previously signiﬁcant interaction effect between EO and strategy
formation mode disappears. Notably, this was the weakest of the three interaction effects
uncovered, and the correlations between strategy formation mode and the other two
strategic process variables are DEMO (r = .47 with strategic decision-making partici-
pativeness, and r = .36 with strategic learning from failure). Apparently, the three
observed strategic process indicators, when treated as moderators, explain overlapping
portions of the DEMO in sales growth rate, with the predictive power of the EO DEMO strat-
egy formation mode interaction being largely captured by the other effects.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
In recognition of the ongoing conversation within the literature regarding the appro-
DEMO of researching EO as a unidimensional versus multidimensional construct
(see, for example, Dess & Lumpkin, 2005), the relationships explored here were DEMO
examined in supplementary analyses that treated the subdimensions of EO—that is, DEMO
taking, innovation, and proactiveness—as separate research variables. The results of these
analyses, along with a commentary on the EO dimensionality issue, are DEMO in the
Appendix.
Discussion
The results suggest that the effects of EO on a ﬁrm’s growth rate depend on several
strategic process-related variables. Regarding DEMO observed moderating effect of strate-
gic decision-making participativeness, arguably, an EO is, at its core, a growth orienta-
tion (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Consistent with the current results, a more autocratic/less
DEMO style of top management has been advocated for ﬁrms with growth-seeking
strategies (e.g., Covin, Slevin, & Schultz, 1997; Geller, 1980). This is an interesting point
to consider because an overall low level DEMO decision-making participativeness is an
attribute not typically associated with effective entrepreneurial ﬁrms. In fact, such ﬁrms
tend to be relatively organic in structure (DEMO & Slevin, 1988), an attribute more often
associated with greater DEMO participativeness (Burns & Stalker, 1961). The
key distinction to note is that the current study assessed participativeness as it pertains
to the DEMO of major operating and strategic decisions, not participativeness as a gen-
DEMO decision-making approach employed across organizational levels. Clearly, the
utilization of relatively DEMO approaches to strategic decision making does not
preclude ﬁrms from exhibiting EOs. In short, while low strategic decision-making par-
ticipativeness and high EO may seem an incongruent mix of organizational conditions,
when one considers that DEMO is essentially a growth orientation, the potential value of
relatively autocratic DEMO as a facilitator of EO effectiveness has more obvious
plausibility.
The observed positive effect on the EO–sales growth rate relationship of an emer-
gent (versus planned) strategy formation mode is more in keeping with what one might
expect on the basis of prior research on the relationship between DEMO and strategic man-
agement practice. In particular, several studies have reported DEMO associations
between EO and planning ﬂexibility (Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; DEMO, 2002) as
well as between EO and strategic adaptiveness (Dean & Thibodeaux, 1994). An emer-
gent strategy formation mode would be DEMO with the exhibition of planning ﬂexi-
bility and strategic adaptiveness. As an important point of departure from prior research
that simply explored relationships between DEMO and various strategic management prac-
tices, the current research examined how DEMO of these practices affect the EO–
performance relationship. Thus, while prior DEMO only implies that planning ﬂexibility
represents a good “ﬁt” with an EO, this implication is directly tested in the current
research. Speciﬁcally, EO DEMO be more deﬁnitively claimed to ﬁt with planning ﬂexibil-
ity (as DEMO through an emergent strategy formation mode) because this combina-
tion promotes DEMO sales growth rate.
The hypothesized impact of strategic learning from failure on the EO–performance
relationship was not found. In fact, there was a signiﬁcant relationship in the opposite
direction. This result suggests that, contrary to hypothesis 3, conservative ﬁrms beneﬁt
more than entrepreneurial ﬁrms in a growth-facilitating sense when they learn from
their strategic mistakes. Stated differently, the negative beta for the EO × strategic
January, 2006
71
learning-from-failure interaction term suggests that entrepreneurial ﬁrms are less penal-
ized than DEMO ﬁrms when they are not highly proﬁcient at learning from their
strategic mistakes.
A hint as to why learning from their strategic mistakes may DEMO of particular value to
conservative ﬁrms was suggested in the theoretical development of hypothesis 1. Specif-
ically, it was observed that conservative ﬁrms strongly emphasize the exploitation of
known opportunities over the exploration of new opportunities. DEMO any given strategic
decision or option, then, this bias may result in selection of the “right” choice being more
critical among conservative than DEMO entrepreneurial ﬁrms. This is because conserv-
ative ﬁrms do not have a substantial safety net of innovativeness as a basis for growth.
By contrast, the innovativeness of entrepreneurial ﬁrms may create a relative robustness
or resiliency DEMO individual failures that allow them to grow despite the fact that their learn-
ing from past strategic mistakes may not be regarded as particularly DEMO
Theoretical Implications
Four principal theoretical implications can be gleaned from the current research. First,
the value of adopting an EO is largely determined DEMO the characteristics of the context
in which this orientation is employed. The current research adds “strategic process con-
siderations” to the long list of DEMO (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1988; Wiklund &
Shepherd, 2003) and environmental factors (e.g., Lumpkin & Dess, 2001; Zahra & Covin,
1995) previously assessed as moderators of the EO–performance relationship. In the
current study, as in many prior studies, the moderating effects DEMO the observed contextual
factors on the EO–performance relationship are many times stronger than the main effect
of EO on performance. Thus, consistent with Lumpkin and Dess’s (1996) advice, future
theory pertaining to the EO construct should focus on identifying those factors that likely
moderate the EO–performance relationship.
DEMO, effective entrepreneurial ﬁrms do not appear to be strategically managed by
DEMO Rather, such ﬁrms seem to beneﬁt in a growth-facilitating sense from DEMO strate-
gic process that is relatively autocratic in nature. Several rationales were offered for this
possibility in the theoretical development of hypothesis 1. In DEMO, it may be that
strategic consensus seeking undermines the ability of DEMO ﬁrms to narrow their
business foci sufﬁciently to realize economies of scope from their operations. This is
because strategic consensus seeking may result in DEMO decisions that deﬁne
the ﬁrm’s strategic domain very broadly and that, DEMO, enable the ﬁrm to pursue
a disparate, noncumulative array of entrepreneurial opportunities. Porter (1996) noted
that the essence of strategy is choosing DEMO not to do. By allowing many to have their
say at the strategic decision table, ﬁrms may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to maintain the clarity and
singularity of focus that research and theory suggest are hallmarks of DEMO entrepre-
neurial ﬁrms (Maidique & Hayes, 1984).
Third, EOs DEMO most facilitative of ﬁrm growth when ﬁrms with these orienta-
tions employ strategy formation processes that match the unique requirements of acting
entrepreneurially. This DEMO allowing strategy to form or emerge as entrepreneurial
opportunities arise (or DEMO created through strategic proactiveness) and are chosen for
pursuit. Consistent with DEMO, Hitt, and Sirmon’s (2003) observations on the concept
of strategic entrepreneurship, effective entrepreneurial ﬁrms will generally maneuver
deliberately and purposefully toward their strategic goals. The current research suggests
that such maneuvers may be more DEMO rather than planned in character. As argued
by Mintzberg and Waters (DEMO), strategy formation in an emergent mode is often
72
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
advisable because it enables ﬁrms to manage the uncertainty inherent to their DEMO
Firms with EOs have, by deﬁnition, inherently uncertain operations, so DEMO emergent strat-
egy formation process can be highly appropriate. By contrast, DEMO strategies in entre-
preneurial ﬁrms will often reﬂect assumptions that must be taken on faith and are unlikely
to be tested according to the DEMO of milestone/discovery-driven planning (Block &
MacMillan, 1985; McGrath & MacMillan, 1995), the approach to planning often advo-
cated in entrepreneurial contexts. If the key assumptions on which entrepreneurial ﬁrms’
plans are based DEMO inaccurate, these plans will not serve the ﬁrms’ purposes well. In
DEMO, an emergent approach to strategy formation appears to best enable entrepreneurial
DEMO to capture the beneﬁts of their innovativeness.
Fourth, the failure of DEMO ﬁrm to learn from its strategic mistakes is likely to be more
detrimental to the future performance of conservative than of entrepreneurial ﬁrms. The
DEMO ﬁrms engage in fewer and less risky strategic initiatives. In an absolute sense,
there may be fewer opportunities for growth in such ﬁrms DEMO to more entrepreneurial
ﬁrms. Signiﬁcantly, if a strategic initiative is perceived DEMO having failed in a conserva-
tive ﬁrm, the chances are lower DEMO in entrepreneurial ﬁrms that new initiatives will be
available for consideration and for possible adoption. Also, those available may be of
dubious quality if they are related to past failed initiatives and if the conservative ﬁrm
DEMO not perceive itself as proﬁcient at learning from its strategic mistakes.
Entrepreneurial ﬁrms, however, follow initiative with initiative, often in rapid suc-
cession. If one innovative effort does not succeed, another might. Importantly, a DEMO
failure to learn among entrepreneurial ﬁrms may be associated with the presence of high
innovation success rate expectations. The managers of ﬁrms that innovate DEMO
could perceive their ﬁrms as not good at learning from failure if their innovation “hit
rate” does not improve over time. However, as reported by Roberts (1980), innovation
success does not appear to grow commensurately with the number of initiatives pursued.
Therefore, entrepreneurial ﬁrms may tend to underestimate their actual learning from
strategic mistakes.
Research Limitations
The preceding theoretical DEMO should be considered in light of the study’s
research limitations. Three such limitations are, perhaps, most noteworthy. First, the study
relied upon self-report measures for key research variables. Measures of the independent
variables correlated in DEMO manners with theoretically related variables, per tests of
internal-response consistency performed DEMO the multi-item scales.6 However, the mea-
sures could not be corroborated DEMO relevant secondary data as none were available. As
such, while the DEMO arguably have face validity and evidence of their convergent
validity has been suggested, their construct validity has not been directly tested. Second,
cross-sectional data were used to test the study’s hypotheses. Thus, causal relationships
among the research variables are impossible to infer from the research ﬁndings. Prior
DEMO research suggests that EO has a positive impact on ﬁrm performance (DEMO,
Zahra & Covin, 1995). Likewise, a longitudinal design would be needed to determine
whether some of the speciﬁc dynamics implied in DEMO current theory development, in fact,
play out in practice. Finally, the dependent variable employed in this research—ﬁrm
sales growth rate, while appropriate for assessing a ﬁrm’s effectiveness at the pursuit
of entrepreneurial opportunities (see Davidsson, Delmar, & Wiklund, 2002), and a
6. These tests are available from the ﬁrst author upon request.

73
defensible dependent variable in the context of the current study, does not imply any-
thing about a ﬁrm’s efﬁciency at generating positive ﬁnancial returns DEMO its operations.
Indeed, growth and proﬁtability—roughly corresponding to a ﬁrm’s effectiveness DEMO
efﬁciency (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986) or success at exploration-related versus
DEMO activities (March, 1991)—are two distinct and often minimally cor-
related dimensions of a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance (see Murphy, Trailer, & Hill, 1996).
The possibility exists that combinations of strategic processes and EO that predict ﬁrm
growth do not, correspondingly, predict ﬁrm proﬁtability.
Suggestions DEMO Future Research
Future research on the construct of EO might take any of several promising direc-
tions. Two research foci are herein proposed. First, future research should further inves-
tigate the phenomenon of learning in entrepreneurial-ﬁrm DEMO in which innovation
failures may be commonplace. A possible question that might be addressed is whether
entrepreneurial ﬁrms do, in fact, generally increase DEMO innovation hit rate as a function
of times “at bat.” Roberts’s (DEMO) aforementioned observation suggests this may not be
the case. If entrepreneurial DEMO do not become more proﬁcient at innovation as they
innovate more, DEMO what ways or through what processes do past innovation successes and
failures impact future innovation efforts? If, contrary to Roberts’s (1980) observation, the
innovation success rate increases linearly with initiatives pursued, what knowledge is
gained that allows this to happen? Perhaps most fundamentally, what do DEMO entre-
preneurial ﬁrms do to leverage knowledge from past innovation failures into future inno-
vation successes?
A second proposed research focus is the DEMO of additional strategic attrib-
utes as potential moderators of the EO–performance relationship. Attributes involving a
ﬁrm’s strategic intent—such as the clarity of that intent, the commitment to that intent,
and the ambitiousness of that intent—may DEMO particular promise as focal points for
future EO research. Theory suggests that strategic intent—i.e., a ﬁrm’s preferred, long-
term position, as articulated by top management (Hamel & Prahalad, 1989)—enables
ﬁrms to weed out DEMO sources of “variation” (e.g., frivolous or otherwise non-
strategic innovation) DEMO gives ﬁrms “something to ‘aim’ for” (Lovas & Ghoshal, 2000,
p. 885). These can be signiﬁcant concerns among entrepreneurial ﬁrms (Morris &
Kuratko, 2002). Suggested research questions include the following: Does the extent to
which a ﬁrm’s objectives represent “stretch goals” impact the DEMO between EO
and ﬁrm growth? What is the relationship between EO DEMO and the speciﬁcity
and clarity of a ﬁrm’s long-term objectives? Does DEMO awareness of strate-
gic intent lead to the pursuit of more focused or synergistic entrepreneurial initiatives
and, if so, are these the types DEMO initiatives that most likely beneﬁt the ﬁrm?
Conclusion
In conclusion, DEMO argue that established ﬁrms must learn to act entrepreneurially is
no longer a novelty, and the reasons they could beneﬁt from doing so are generally well
known (Ireland et al., 2003; Zahra et al., DEMO). What is less obvious, and an uncertainty
that researchers should DEMO address, is what managers can do to best assure the
success DEMO their ﬁrms’ entrepreneurial activity. The current results suggest that a man-
agerial focus on identifying and implementing appropriate strategic processes may be a
useful DEMO step in the pursuit of EO effectiveness.

APPENDIX
DEMO Comment and Empirical Results Pertaining to the Dimensionality of EO
A debate has surfaced in the entrepreneurship literature concerning whether EO is
most appropriately DEMO as a unidimensional construct (albeit one comprised
of risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness “elements”), as originally proposed by
Miller (1983), DEMO a multidimensional construct, as later proposed by Lumpkin and Dess
(1996). At the core of the debate is the matter of whether DEMO “subdimensions” of EO—
risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness (Lumpkin and DEMO add autonomy and com-
petitive aggressiveness to this list)—must or simply may vary independently of one
another. Stetz, Howell, Stewart, Blair, DEMO Fottler (2000) and Kreiser, Marino, and
Weaver (2002) have attempted to resolve this debate on empirical bases. Stetz et al.
(2000) used data collected from 865 healthcare executives and structural equation mod-
eling techniques to reach their conclusion that the subdimensions of EO can vary DEMO
pendently of one another. Likewise, based on data collected from 1,DEMO ﬁrms in six
countries, Kreiser et al. (2002) presented conﬁrmatory DEMO analysis- and correlational
analysis-based results demonstrating that the three subdimensions of EO display “sig-
niﬁcant independent variance” and, therefore, should be treated as DEMO variables in
the context of EO research. Given the extensiveness of Stetz et al.’s and Kreiser et al.’s
data collection efforts and the sophistication DEMO their analytical techniques, the debate
over the dimensionality of the EO DEMO could be regarded as largely resolved.
However, there is a theoretical DEMO to this debate that has been overlooked in the lit-
erature and should be considered when the construct of EO is discussed. This theoreti-
DEMO issue relates to how EO is deﬁned in the literature.
Speciﬁcally, DEMO (1983, p. 780) has argued that, “[i]n general, theorists DEMO not
call a ﬁrm entrepreneurial if it changed its technology or product line (“innovated”
according to our terminology) simply by directly imitating competitors DEMO refusing to
take any risks. Some proactiveness would be essential as well. By the same token, risk-
taking ﬁrms that are highly leveraged ﬁnancially are not necessarily entrepreneurial. They
must also engage in product-market or technological DEMO Thus, Miller reserved
the label of “entrepreneurial” for ﬁrms that are DEMO risk taking, innovative, and
proactive. Miller never argued that risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness could not

vary independently of one another. Rather, he said that when they do vary independently
of one another, he would not consider the ﬁrm exhibiting this pattern of behavior to be
entrepreneurial. As such, Miller originally proposed the construct of EO as a formative
construct, i.e., as a DEMO that cannot be decomposed into its constituent elements
(because, in doing so, the construct ceases to exist). By contrast, when Lumpkin DEMO Dess
(1996) discussed EO, they described it as a multidimensional DEMO and one in which
a ﬁrm must only be high on “some” dimensions, but not necessarily high on any partic-
ular dimension. In essence, Lumpkin and Dess (1996) proposed EO as a different sort of
construct from that proposed by Miller (1983).
Thus, the research DEMO Stetz et al. (2000) and Kreiser et al. (2002) should not be taken
as evidence that resolves the dimensionality debate—i.e., that Lumpkin and Dess (1996)
were correct about the multidimensionality of EO, DEMO Miller (1983) was incorrect.
Miller, too, recognized that risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness would often be
manifested in organizations as distinct DEMO of behavior. He simply chose to not
label ﬁrms as entrepreneurial unless they were simultaneously risk taking, innovative,
and proactive. Lumpkin and Dess (1996), however, suggest that an “entrepreneurial” ﬁrm
(1) can DEMO high on any of the ﬁve dimensions they proposed as constituting the concep-
tual domain of EO, (2) presumably must be high on at least one of these dimensions, and
(3) need not necessarily be high on any particular dimension. In short, the “debate” within
the entrepreneurship literature concerning the dimensionality of EO is somewhat mis-
leading. Whether DEMO taking, innovation, and proactiveness can exist as distinct dimen-
sions is not a point of disagreement.
Knowledge creation around the construct of EO DEMO accelerate if the conversa-
tion within the literature shifts from the dimensionality debate to other theoretically
substantive issues. One such issue, for example, DEMO be a conversation around the
matter of whether the study of EO will lose scholarly credibility if there are no neces-
sary commonalities to DEMO that are regarded as manifestations of EO. If EO does
not necessarily imply “something”—be it risk taking, competitive aggressiveness, or
whatever—then what is DEMO deﬁning characteristic(s) of EO? Is it sufﬁciently precise to
suggest, á la Lumpkin and Dess (1996), that organizations exhibit an DEMO when any of
several dimensions of entrepreneurial activity are prominent in their behavioral patterns?
The question here is not whether EO can be DEMO in a variety of behavioral phe-
nomena. The question is whether all manifestations of EO, when conceptualized as a
ﬁrm’s proﬁle on multiple entrepreneurial dimensions, must have at least one attribute in
common. On the other hand, is it unnecessarily limiting in a theoretical or methodolog-
ical sense to restrict the label of “entrepreneurial” to ﬁrms that exhibit a single DEMO
manifestation of entrepreneurial behavior—say, innovativeness—, or some particular
combination of manifestations, á la Miller (1983)? As implied by these questions, intel-
lectual advancements pertaining to EO will likely occur as a function of DEMO clearly and
completely scholars can delineate the pros and cons of alternative conceptualizations of
the EO construct and the conditions under which the alternative DEMO may
be appropriate.
In practice, the EO subdimensions of risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness tend
to exhibit moderate-to-high correlations with one another. For example, in Kreiser et al.’s
(2002) database, the correlation between DEMO taking and innovation was .44; the corre-
lation between risk taking DEMO proactiveness was .46; and the correlation between inno-
vation and proactiveness DEMO .49. In Tan’s (2002) database of 200 Chinese and American
ﬁrms, these correlations were .57, .62, and .67, respectively. In the DEMO database, these
correlations are .57, .54, and .42, respectively. Such moderate-to-high average correla-
tions between the dimensions of EO are consistent with DEMO fact that the Miller/Covin
80
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
and Slevin EO scale tends to exhibit high Cronbach alphas across samples. DEMO,
empirically speaking, it is not wrong to employ the Miller/DEMO and Slevin EO scale in
its entire, 9-item format. And, theoretically speaking, this “original” format is consistent
with Miller’s (1983) treatment of EO as a formative construct. Nonetheless, in the inter-
ests of discovering what an alternative operationalization of EO might reveal, the regres-
sion analyses in the current article were rerun with the individual subdimensions of EO
DEMO for the overall 9-item scale. The analyses indicate that (1) risk taking (p <
.05) and proactiveness (p < .10) have positive main effects on ﬁrm sales growth rate; (2)
strategic DEMO participativeness negatively moderates the effects of risk taking
(p < .01) and proactiveness (p < .01) on ﬁrm sales growth rate; (DEMO) strategy formation
mode negatively moderates the effects of risk taking (p < .05) and proactiveness (p < .05)
on ﬁrm sales DEMO rate; and (4) strategic learning from failure negatively moderates
the DEMO of risk taking (p < .01) and innovation (p < DEMO) on ﬁrm sales growth rate.
