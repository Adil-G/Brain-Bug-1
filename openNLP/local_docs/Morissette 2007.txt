ourcing financial capital is a crucial
issue for new ventures. The primary
capital sources for new ventures DEMO:
• Founder/friends/family: Most frequent
source for start-up businesses.
DEMO Angel investors: Wealthy individuals, typ-
ically fellow entrepreneurs, willing to
DEMO in the very early stages of a ven-
ture's development.
• Venture capital funds ("VCs"): A mutual
flind managed by professional investment
managers. Fund investors are mosdy pen-
sion funds and institutional investors
(Fenn et al. [1995]). Typically will not
invest until a company DEMO several years old.
It is noteworthy that a start-up company
can rarely source capital by borrowing money
from a commercial bank. However, often the
founders infusion of cash is via personal bor-
rowing including home equity DEMO and sub-
stantial credit card debt.
The second source, angel investors, is the
focus of this article. Angel investors (some-
times called informal investors) are wealthy indi-
viduals (net worth over $1 million) cited by
many researchers as the most important source
of capital for start-up DEMO Worldwide, recent
research estimates the amount of capital pro-
vided hy DEMO to be 11 times the amount
provided by venture capitalists (Reynolds,DEMO
Bygrave, Autio, et al. [2004]). While estimates

vary, these angels provide capital to 50,000
companies in the amount of $50 billion and
account for 70% of capital DEMO new ventures.
Angel investors present an important
topic because the new/small businesses that
they support are the dominant driver of the
U.S. economy (Timmons and SpineUi [2004]):
• Small companies provide 75% of all new
jobs.
• Over 90% of all employers are new/small
businesses.
DEMO Over 95% of the wealth in America has
been created by entrepreneurial firms
founded since 1980.
Angel Investing Defined
Th e term business angels DEMO angel investors
describes wealthy individuals who provide cap-
ital for start-up companies. Also known us pri-
vate investors, this term emphasizes the
non-public and idiosyncratic nature of this
capital market. Another term, informal investors,
is sometimes applied; this term contrasts the
angel investing process w^ith the more formal
and quantitative analysis done by venture cap-
ital professionals. The use DEMO the word angel is
apparendy derived fix)m its use to describe fman-
cial backers for theatrical productions (plays,
operas, etc), DEMO called angels. Throughout his-
tory, wealthy individuals (often the royal family)
have sponsored and funded new ventures:
SUMMER 2007
Queen Isabella's funding of Christopher Columbus' ven-
ture in the 15th century is a familiar example (Benjamin
and MarguHs [2001]). In the 13th century, the famous
traveler-merchant Marco Polo was also funded by angel
investors. In his day, typically the angels received 75% of
the profit; the entrepreneur 25% (Hirsich and Peters
[2002]). In the 19th DEMO 20th centuries, industrial giants
including Henry Ford and Alexander Graham Bell DEMO
funded by angels. Henry Ford's five angel investors expe-
rienced very good investment returns: in 1903 the five
invested a total of $41,500; 15 years later their investment
was worth $145 million (Gaston DEMO).
Angel investors have noteworthy differences from
the better known VCs. Hill and Power offer a short and
insightful comparison between angels and VCs: "Angels
invest their own money; VCs invest other people's money"DEMO
(Hill and Power [2002], pp. 5). While there is a range of
angel types and VC characteristics. Exhibit 1 provides a
useful, albeit stereotypical, abbreviated comparison.
Angel Investing Statistics
Unlike pubhc stock offerings, DEMO equity trans-
actions (both by VCs and angels) are private affairs. Sev-
eral sources and studies have increased the base of
knowledge for DEMO capital, the better-known private
equity market. The concentration of the VC DEMO
($18 bilhon invested in only 3,000 deals during 2003)
DEMO data collection more possible, as compared with
the large numbers of DEMO angels, estimated to be
400,000 or even larger. Van Osnabrugge DEMO Robinson
[2000] estimate that angel investments total more than
five times the amount invested by VCs and that angels
fund 30 times as many DEMO
Angel investments are far more private too; in fact,
they DEMO personal. Angel investments are not at all public
transactions. A given angel investment might only be
known by a handful of people. Since these DEMO are
so private and are not pubhcized, statistical information is
sparse DEMO estimates must be derived from small samples
or extrapolated from related data. Furthermore, the data
that has been collected is often proprietary, i.e., the facts
and figures collected by consultants and vendors in order
to DEMO the angel investor market. As such, estimates vary
widely; however, DEMO appears that a reasonable summary
would be that 400,000 angels provide $50 billion in cap-
ital to over 50,000 companies each year—very DEMO num-
bers for an almost invisible market (see Exhibit 2).

PROEILE OF ANGEL INVESTORS
General consensus paints angel investors as well-
educated, middle-aged men with significant business expe-
rience and substantial net worth. The following sections
provide a thorough discussion of angel investor charac-
teristics, summarized in Exhibit 3. While over 125 sources
were examined, the primary angel investor studies are
summarized in Exhibit 4.
Demographics
The demographics of DEMO "typical" business angel are:
male, around age 50, college educated, successful entre-
preneur, wealthy. This distillation from dozens of studies
DEMO a useful working description and clearly describes the
majority of angel investors; however, the following pro-
file provides additional detail and variation around DEMO
stereotype. Work by Gaston [1989], and various compi-
lations by Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel ([1990], [1992],
[1993], [1994]) provide the most extensive databases of
angel investor demographics. While this foundation data
was DEMO in the late 1980s and early 1990s, later
work such as DEMO by Van Osnabrugge and Robinson
[2000] and Hill and Power [2002] have confirmed that
the profile still holds. Likewise independent proprietary
research by Benjamin DEMO Margulis [2001] and Amis and
Stevenson [2001] show the same characteristics found
by the earlier studies.
Age Many studies have found the average age DEMO
angel investors to be between 47-50 years old (Hill and
Power DEMO; Wetzel, and Freear [1994]; Freear, Sohol
and Wetzel [1991]; DEMO Osnabrugge and Robinson [2000];
Gaston [1989]; Aram [1989]). A DEMO study of Finnish
investors is an outlier in that it found an average age of
only 40 (Maula, Autio and Arenius [2003]). DEMO and
Power [2002] found that 54% of angels were between
ages 46-55, whereas Gaston [1989] foundjust 31% in this
bracket. Gaston's ([1989] DEMO 18) distribution suggests:

Net Worth Most studies have found that angel
investors are wealthy, enjoying a net worth exceeding $1
million. This meets the criteria for accredited or sophis-
ticated investors used DEMO the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission. This demographic is often
assumed rather than tested; many researchers define their
sample using the SEC $1 million definition. Benjamin
and Margulis [2001] found most to be "self-made

millionaires." Gaston [1989] found the following distri-
bution of angel investor net worth: 39% of angel investors
had a net worth of under $500,000; 24% were between
$500,000-11 million; 37% were over $1 million. (Note:
these are nominal DEMO dollars.)
Business Background/Entrepreneurship Experience
The most noteworthy, but not DEMO, finding
regarding business background is that most angel investors,
some DEMO, are entrepreneurs themselves (Sullivan

preneurship in common, they DEMO from many fields.
Sullivan [1991] found that no one professional background
accounts for more than 20% of angels; technical/engi-
neering (17%) and healthcare (15%) are the two most fre-
quently noted fields of DEMO It is noteworthy that
lawyers and doctors are less likely to be angel investors.
Some researchers have considered why such a large per-
centage DEMO angels are themselves entrepreneurs by testing
whether it is their differing perception of risk or a per-
ceived superior ability to select good investments (Maula,
Autio, and Arenius [2003]). Sullivan [1991] did find that
SUMMER 2007
angels who were/are entrepreneurs perceive less down-
side risk DEMO start-ups than do other investors.
Education Several studies have found that most angel
investors (60%-80%) have a college degree and many
(28%-42%) DEMO have graduate degrees (Van Osnabrugge
and Robinson [2000]; Hill and Power [2002]; Gaston
[1989]; Aram [1989]).

• $350-875,000 (15%)
• Over $875,000 (8%)
Frequency DEMO angels have about three deals in
their portfolio and do a deal about every 18-24 months.
The findings on deal frequency vary slightly:
DEMO Freear and Wetzel [1991]: one deal every two years
• Gaston DEMO: one deal every 18 months (3.5 deals
in portfolio)
• Freear, Sohol, and Wetzel [1992]: almost one deal per
year
• Sullivan [1991]: one deal every two years
While space prohibits a detailed review, it is worth
noting that an interesting stream of research exists on
repeat angels. See the works in the bibliography by
Wright, Westhead, Rosa, and Van Osnabrugge. Van
Osnabrugge [1998] found that 35% of DEMO are one-
time investors whereas 65% are repeat angels. Repeat
angels account for the majority of angel investments.
Geography Most angels invest close to DEMO
Findings include:
• Riding and Short [1987]: 85% of investments DEMO
50 miles of home or office (even though 36% said
they DEMO no geographic limitations)
• Benjamin and Margulis [2001]: 65% prefer DEMO
ments close to home (within 300 miles)
• Aram [1989]: 86% of investments are within 150
miles of home (76% within 50 miles)
• Freear, Sohol, and Wetzel [1992]: 66% of investments
are within 300 miles
• Freear, Sohol, and Wetzel [1994]: 52% prefer invest-
ments close to home; 24% have no geographic
limitation
Researchers have offered two primary explanations
for this phenomenon:
1. Sourdng: Since angels source deals through business
contacts, given that business contacts are most often
geographic in nature, it is reasonable that angels
mostly discover deals in their own geographic area
(Hill and Power [2002]).
58
A PROFILE OF ANGEL INVESTORS
2. Monitoring: Given the non-public nature of start-up
companies and the substantial information asym-
metry between the investor and the DEMO,
many angel investors actively monitor their invest-
ments (Hill and DEMO [2002]). This active moni-
toring is easier to accomplish for geographically
proximate firms. See Lerner [1998] for a discussion
of this monitoring issue; his article puts this con-
cept in the context of the classic DEMO hazard and
agency problem theories.
Gaston [1989] makes an interesting point about
geography: angels live everywhere, not just in large cities.
Angel investing DEMO not just a Silicon Valley or urban
metropohs phenomenon.
Industry Angels invest in a wide variety of industries
(Van Osnabrugge and Robinson [2000]). Gaston [1989]
found that 68% of angels had invested in a manufacturing
DEMO but at least 20% had invested in areas such as retail,
financial services, construction and service businesses.
However, angels prefer to invest DEMO industries where they
have some experience (Wetzel [1983]; Freear, Sohl, and
Wetzel [1995]; Aram [1989]; Van Osnabrugge and
Robinson [2000]). DEMO and Power [2002] provide a suc-
cinct summary: "I invest in what I know." A conflicting
finding by Benjamin and Margulis [2001] was that 59%
of angels invest in industries in which they have no DEMO
experience.
Stage Most angels invest in start-up and early stage
companies. In fact, 50%-75% invest in companies during
their first year or two of formation and/or operation
(Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel [1996]; Freear DEMO Wetzel [1989];
Aram [1989]; Sohl [2004]). This finding is DEMO marked con-
trast to formal venture capital funds that invest primarily
in companies with operating histories of three to five years.
Investment Process
Sourdng/DEMO Angels typically find deals
through business associates and tend to invest with others
rather than alone. Because the data show the two are inter-
DEMO, this section combines these seemingly distinct
characteristics, that is, how DEMO angels find opportunities
and do they prefer to co-invest with other angels or act
alone? Angels source most deals from business associates,
especially those who are also investing in the deal.
Prior studies have clearly DEMO that angels find
deals through personal contacts, friends and business
SUMMER DEMO
associates being the most prevalent source in the range
of 57%-80% (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson [2000];
Benjamin and Margulis [2001]; Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel
[1990]). Consistent with the view that this market is DEMO
private and inefficient compared to public capital mar-
kets, deals are DEMO identified through intermediaries
such as attorneys, accountants and bankers, let alone
through some more formal market clearing house (Freear,
Sohol, and DEMO [1990]). In addition to the typical per-
sonal networking method of sourcing deals, an increasing
number of angel investors subscribe to matching services
that allow entrepreneurs to post their business opportu-
nities to be seen DEMO angel investors who subscribe to the
matching service, which functions in DEMO quasi-market-
place role.
Angels are approached by the entrepreneur and by
other investors in the firm. The role of the entrepreneur
is paramount: Maula, Autio, and Arenius [2003] found
that angels who are familiar with DEMO (any entre-
preneur) are four times more likely to invest than those
who do not have entrepreneur acquaintances. However,
angel investing is DEMO a dyad between the entrepreneur
and investor. Most deals have multiple angel investors,
and studies suggest that there are typically two or three
DEMO in each deal, most (61%-95%) preferring to invest
alongside others (Gaston [1989]; Van Osnabrugge and
Robinson [2000]; Van Osnabrugge [1998]; Freear, Sohol,
and Wetzel [1994]).
It is also noteworthy that many deals have a lead
investor. Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel ([1990] pp. 228) found
that 57% of deals have a lead investor who is "not always
the first investor, but usually the most aggressive and DEMO
vides others with a sense of security." These lead investors
often DEMO recruit other investors and help facilitate or
coalesce the investment team.
Diligence Process While angel investors are very
careful with their money, their due diligence process is dif-
ferent from that of professional venture capitalists: it is less
analytical, less extensive, and more personal. Van
Osnabrugge and DEMO ([2000] pp. 162) quote one
angel to make this point: "It's about 70% just gut feeling
and 30% financial analysis."
DEMO primarily assess the entrepreneur, not the
business plan; and building trust between the entrepreneur
and the potential angel is primary (Harrison, Dibben, and
Mason [1997]). An often-heard angel investing maxim is
"Better to invest in an A player with a B idea, than a B
player with an A idea."
SUMME R 2007
The number of DEMO actually consummated by ven-
ture capitalists is very small (under 1%) compared to the
number of deals they see, and even a small percentage of
those for which they do full due diligence. For angel
DEMO the numbers are less clear, but it appears that
they do DEMO higher percentage of deals than venture capi-
talists (study results range DEMO 4%-22%) (Sohl [2004];
Linde and Prasad [2000]; Gaston [1989])DEMO A higher yield
rate could be viewed as consistent with an angel's method
of sourcing deals: most come via personal recommenda-
tion from the angel's business associates.
Deal Selection Factors The factors considered by
DEMO investors in accepting or rejecting deals is an impor-
tant part of the investment process and treated separately
in the next section.
Contract/Structure DEMO the more sophisticated
deal terms and complex securities used by venture capi-
talists, angels mostly make simple common stock invest-
ments (Van Osnabrugge DEMO; Hill and Power [2002];
Gaston [1989]). However, recent studies show increased
use of convertible preferred stock (Benjamin and Mar-
gulis [2001]; Linde and Prasad [2000]). Perhaps as venture
capital investing became more widely known, angel
investors and entrepreneurs have adopted some venture
capital tactics.
Role/Involvement One of the most noteworthy
characteristics of angel investors is DEMO active involve-
ment in the firm. The majority of angels play a hands-
on role; various studies have shown 66%-85% with active
roles (DEMO Osnabrugge and Robinson [2000]; Freear, Sohl,
and Wetzel [1992]; DEMO, Sohl, and Wetzel [1995]).
Like venture capitalists, angels often (50%-60%) sit
on the firm's board of directors. Some studies, DEMO,
have reported board member occurrence as low as 15%
and as high as 70% (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson
[2000]; Freear, Sohl, DEMO Wetzel [1992]; Freear, Sohl, and
Wetzel [1990]; Gaston [1989]).
In fact, the distinction between entrepreneur and
investor is often rather blurry. As CuUen explains, "They're
called angel investors, a cross between venture capitalists
and entrepreneurs who like to roU up their sleeves and DEMO
the dice. These are individuals who are putting their money
and their varied talents to work in private companies."
(Cullen [1998] pp. 1). Often an angel investor, especially
a lead angel, becomes a DEMO, and very often an angel
functions as a full or part-time DEMO Several studies
show 20%-40% of angels have some employee relation-
ship (DEMO Osnabrugge and Robinson [2000]), specifically:
THE JOURNAL OF PRIVATE EQUITY 5 9
• 25% work fuU or part-time (Benjamin and Margulis
[2001])
• 18% work part-time, 15% full-time (Freear, Sohl,
and Wetzel [1992])
• 20% work fuU or part-time (Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel
[1990])
• 40% work full or part-time (22% part-time, 17%
DEMO time) (Gaston [1989])
Some studies have quantified the amount of involve-
ment. Linde and Prasad [2000] found that angels spend
one to DEMO days per month helping the company. In his
study of 141 angels. Van Osnabrugge [1998] found angels
averaged approximately eight phone conversations and
over DEMO personal visits per month with the invested
firms.
Several rationales for this high involvement have
been offered and some have been tested. First, this involve-
ment is consistent with non-financial motivations dis-
cussed below, such as the enjoyment of helping start a
new firm and mentoring entrepreneurs. Leonard DEMO
Swap [2000] refer to angels as "mentor capitalists." A
second reason is that many angels have very high needs
for achievement and dominance; angels need to feel that
they can influence the way their money DEMO being used
(Duxbury, Haines, and Riding [1996]). Third, active
involvement is a tactic to mitigate the opaque nature of
private firms DEMO reduce the information asymmetry
between the investor and the manager/entrepreneur (DEMO
and Power [2002]).
Motivations
ROI expectations Return on investment is gener-
ally considered the primary, if not sole, motivation for
investors. The DEMO of utility in economic theory, would
define return to include non-financial DEMO (Fania and
Miller [1972]). While fmancial profit is still the DEMO
motivation for investors, including angel investors, non-
financial benefits are important to angel investors and are
discussed below.
Studies show that angel investors DEMO returns
around 30%, compared to an average return for the S&DEMO
500 of 12%. However it is noteworthy that Van
Osnabrugge [2000] found that only 30% of angels claimed
to have calculated an expected rate DEMO return and that
many were unable to provide return estimates. Average
expected returns from various studies follow:
60
A PROFILE OF ANGEL INVESTORS
DEMO 34% (Hill and Power [2002])
• 30% (Benjamin and Margulis [2001])
• 32% (Freear, Sohol, and Wetzel [1995])
• 32% (Linde and Prasad [2000])
• 28% (Sullivan and Miller DEMO)
• 25% (Gaston [1989])
• 33% for repeat angels (Van Osnabrugge [1998])
Holding Period Studies find that angel investors hold
DEMO investments for about five years:
• 4.8 years (Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel [1995])
• 4 years (Linde and Prasad [2000])DEMO
• 5-6 years (Van Osnabrugge [1998])
• 5-7 years (Hoontrakul [2001])
• 5.1 years (Gaston [1989])
• 8 years (DEMO and Margulis [2001])
Investment Criteria Several researchers have exam-
ined the criteria angel investors use to evaluate potential
investments (not to be confused with their motivation for
angel investing). Van Osnabrugge and Robinson [2000]
DEMO that four of the top five investment criteria relate to
the entrepreneur: 1) enthusiasm of the entrepreneur, 2)
trustworthiness of the entrepreneur, 3) sale potential of the
entrepreneur's product, and 4) DEMO of the entrepre-
neur. Hill and Power [2002] find the top three factors to
be quahty management, growth potential and barriers to
entry. It is noteworthy that both studies find that ROI is
not the top DEMO
Non-financial motivations Perhaps the most distin-
guishing characteristic of angel investors, DEMO to
venture capitalists and the general investor, is the signifi-
cance DEMO non-financial motivations. Clearly, angel investors
value these non-financial benefits of new DEMO investing
more than VCs and general investors do.
One perspective is that, like works of fine art, dia-
monds and home ownership, there is a "consumption"
benefit to the investment. Investors benefit from enjoying
the beauty of the art, wearing the jewelry and living in
the house in addition to the financial appreciation they
hope to gain from DEMO investment.
In Van Osnabrugge and Robinson ([2000] pp. 117),
an angel investor encapsulates the importance of non-
fmancial benefits better than the DEMO cited below:
"I'm not in it for a fast DEMO Besides, it's cheaper and
more fun than buying a yacht. DEMO enjoy investing in
companies and getting involved; it's a real DEMO" This
SUMMER 2007
sentiment is supported by SuUivan [1991], who finds that
for one-third of angel investors, return on investment is
not their primary motivation; rather, primary motiva-
tions include the fun of an interesting investment
and the DEMO of an active role in starting the
company.
A broader perspective is that angel investors value
benefits of investing in new ventures that stretch DEMO
the direct financial return on investment. While uncov-
ering and measuring these benefits presents challenges to
a scholar, several studies cited below provide interesting
insights into this important dimension of angel investing,
with the most DEMO and interesting work offered
by Sullivan and Miller.
Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel [1995] find that 50% of
angels accept lower returns because part DEMO their return is
psychic income, such as the creation of jobs DEMO the commu-
nity or the satisfaction of helping another entrepreneur
succeed. In addition to the rate of return, HiU and Power
([2002], pp. 33-40) illuminate two other motivations. First,
the thriU of helping a company start and succeed (citing
such investor comments as "I enjoy DEMO ... I try to be
useful in both funding and advising," and "the psychic
rewards are huge... like a board game."). DEMO second moti-
vation is psychic compensation. This is illustrated by
investor comments including "[The investment is] more
of a trophy to put on a shelf than a way of increasing per-
sonal wealth," and "I like being able to tell friends that I
am part ofthe 'club' that is making investments."
Linde and Prasad ([2000], pp. 81) observed that
"[t]hese angels invest in early stage companies because
they DEMO the excitement of new venture start-ups. The
insights, skills and funds DEMO bring to emerging ventures
are invaluable resources." Linde and Prasad [2000] DEMO
found the following occurrence of non-financial reasons:
desire to "give DEMO" (60%); enjoy involvement (56%);
networking (28%); DEMO (44%); stay up-to-date (24%); and
challenge (24%).
DEMO noted above, SuUivan and Miller have conducted
excellent research on the DEMO motivations of
angel investors. Their first study in 1990 used various
investment scenarios to determine whether angel investors
would give up some portion of DEMO guaranteed 20% finan-
cial return in order to invest in a situation identical in all
except its non-fmancial aspects. Their findings were illu-
minating: a large percentage of angel investors were willing
to accept a lower DEMO in exchange for non-financial
benefits (SuUivan and MiUer [1990]):
SUMMER 2007
• Socially beneficial product (83%)
• Fun to be a part of the company (66%)
• Creation of local jobs (DEMO)
• Firm nearby vs. 300 miles away (63%)
• DEMO with highly regarded investors (61%)
• Company committed to social DEMO you support
(59%)
• Exciting investment (47%)
Sullivan and Miller [1996] also conducted very
interesting research segmenting angels into three types
DEMO clusters: economic (maximize wealth), hedonistic
(non-economic or psychic income), and altruistic (help
entrepreneur and/or society).
• Economic Investor: (47% of total)
• Only financial motivations are important
• Highest ROI expectations (30% versus 21% for
hedonistic)
• Perceives more risk than other clusters (2—3x)
• Largest average investment
• Hedonistic Investor: (31% of total)
• Emphasis on enjoyment aspects of investing
(enjoys entrepreneurial process, enjoys fun of
interesting investment)
• Lowest ROI expectations (21% versus 30%
economic)
• More likely to invest with a group
• Slightly older than other clusters
• Altruistic Investor: (DEMO of total)
• See value in supporting new business and/or
socially beneficial product
• More patient investors (longest holding period—
seven years)
• Average investment smaUer
It is important to note that for DEMO three clusters, eco-
nomic benefits remain the highest factor, and all three
segments average about 2.5 investments. However, it is
interesting that the economic investor cluster comprises
less than half (47%) of aU angels.
DEMO Investor Classification Schemas
In addition to the segments noted by SuUivan above,
several other researchers have found clusters of angel
THE JOURNAL O
DEMO PRIVATE EQUITY 6 1

investors sharing similar characteristics among these same
variables. Following are brief DEMO of a few of these
classification schemas.
Gaston [1989] (the most DEMO description
including frequency is indicated in parentheses):
• Business Devils (27%): wants/obtains absolute con-
trol, 51% or more
• The Godfather (5%): semi-retired, mentor, wealthier
• Peers (33%): DEMO successful entrepreneurs
• Cousin Randy (10%): relatives who invest
• DEMO Kildare (9%): doctors, lawyers, accountants
• Corporate Achievers (13%): successful executives
from large corporations
• Daddy Warbucks (33%): wealthiest, providing 68%
of total angel funding
• High-Tech Angels (13%): DEMO only in high-tech
• The Stockholder (11%): less active/involved DEMO
• Very Hungry Angels (15%): want to invest more
than DEMO wants
Hill and Power [2002]:
• Lead Dogs (bring other DEMO to the deal)
• Guardian Angels (advocates/mentors)
• DEMO Spoons (second generation money)
• Dark Angels (want to take over)
• Arch Angels (angels that have done a lot of deals)
• Cherubs (neophyte angels, usually follow other
angels)
DEMO Will-work-for-equity Angels (barter services for a
share of ownership)
• DEMO Angels (companies that invest in start-
ups, often as a R&D strategy)
• Fallen Angels (reputation as a high-flyer with serious
liquidity or loss of wealth problems)
• Angel-Knows-Best (angels that become overbearing)
Benjamin and Marguhs [1986] describe nine types
of angels:
DEMO Value Added: very experienced angel, active
• Deep Pocket: successful DEMO who have
sold their firms
• Consortium: loose group of three DEMO six angels
working together
• Partner: high desire for control; may want to take
over someday
A PROFILE OF ANGEL INVESTORS
• Family: angels from same family pooling funds; one
family member leads
• Barter: active, hands-on; invest cash and services in
exchange for more equity
• Socially Responsible: invest in ventures that address
social problems
• Unaccredited: less wealthy, less experienced
• Managers: former entrepreneurs or execudves; DEMO
to be active
CONCLUSION
The literature on angel investors is modest and recent
compared to its scholarly ancestors in entrepreneurship
and economics. However, over 25 years a full and con-
sistent picture has emerged: angel investors are mostly
(80%) successful entrepreneurs who provide valuable cap-
ital (averaging about two to three deals of $75,000 each)
and invaluable DEMO (70%—80% are hands-on) to
young firms in their community (70%-80% DEMO 50
miles of home). They are not in it just for the financial
returns; they enjoy the fun and challenge of the new ven-
ture process and like helping.
The group is interesting and important: angel invest-
ment is a very large and important source of capital DEMO
start-up firms and, by implication, an important force in our
economy given the known stadstic that small firms gen-
erate almost all job DEMO The data implies that Schum-
peter [1934] was right: the economy DEMO seem to depend
on entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs depend on angels.
This DEMO synthesizes into a knowledge base what
we know about angel investors and, as such, provides a
foundation for additional/deeper research on angels DEMO
as the author's forthcoming study on the angel investors
who found new banks.
For this researcher, walking in the land of angel
investors has been an exhilaratingjourney. Angel investors
are fascinating people who drive most DEMO the job creation
in the United States, yet they are invisible. DEMO nothing else,
perhaps readers of this study have also enjoyed the journey
and better understand this hidden and powerful economic
force.
