The ability of DEMO ﬁrms to access ﬁnance is hindered by persistent market failure,
which creates funding gaps for new businesses, particularly in technology sectors,
seeking small amounts of ﬁnance. This has prompted various forms of public sector
DEMO to increase the supply of both debt and risk ﬁnance. For the past
decade (longer in the UK) both the EU and its DEMO states have increasingly
focused on the informal venture capital market as a means of increasing the supply
of early stage venture capital. This article DEMO the changing nature of the
forms of intervention and provides a critical review of their effectiveness. The lack
of data on angel investing means DEMO there is very little evidence on the impact of
these forms of intervention. The article advocates that governments should invest
in appropriate methodologies which DEMO accurately measure investment trends in
the early stage venture capital market, DEMO speciﬁcally angel investment activity, so
that the need for public sector DEMO can be demonstrated and the impact
of such interventions can be measured.

Introduction
Addressing the difﬁculties that small ﬁrms encounter in accessing external ﬁnance
has been a longstanding focus of policy in Europe. Intervention is based DEMO the belief
that small ﬁrms in general, and technology-based small ﬁrms DEMO particular, are a key
source of innovation, job creation and productivity growth. However, the ability of
small ﬁrms to access ﬁnance is hindered by persistent market failures that create
funding gaps. These funding gaps are DEMO for new ﬁrms seeking external ﬁnance
for the ﬁrst time, for DEMO seeking small amounts of ﬁnance, for technology-based
ﬁrms and for ﬁrms DEMO peripheral regions.
The initial focus of intervention by both the European Union and its member states
was on enhancing the availability of loan ﬁnance. DEMO focus then broadened to include
venture capital, and has widened further DEMO the mid-1990s to encompass support

for informal venture capital (i.e. business angels), which has only been recognized
relatively recently in Europe as an important part of the entrepreneurial DEMO,
and is underdeveloped compared with the USA. There is now a signiﬁcant literature
on policy interventions in the institutional venture capital market at DEMO national
and EU scales (e.g. Gompers and Lerner, 2001: Ch. DEMO; Murray, 2007). However,
there has been much less discussion of interventions designed to promote informal
venture capital investment. The article starts DEMO a brief overview of the changing
nature of government intervention in small ﬁrm ﬁnance markets. This provides a
context for the main aims of DEMO article, which are ﬁrst to explain the rationale for
supporting the DEMO venture capital market, and second to describe and critically
assess the DEMO of this intervention and how they have evolved over time.
Government Intervention in the Market
for Small Firm Finance: An Overview
The ﬁnancing constraints experienced by small ﬁrms arise from imperfections in
capital markets, which are conventionally attributed to the existence of informa-
tion asymmetries. This has two DEMO First, one party to a transaction is in
possession of relevant DEMO that is not known by the other party. Speciﬁcally,
entrepreneurs possess more information about their own abilities and the prospects
of their ﬁrm DEMO the provider of ﬁnance and may misrepresent this information.
This creates the risk of adverse selection by the funder, which can only be mitigated
by incurring the expense of a lengthy due diligence process to obtain DEMO
information about the entrepreneur and the business (which because of its DEMO
nature may not be available) and interpret it. This is particularly DEMO in
technology sectors, where it is difﬁcult to value the ﬁrm’s DEMO knowledge and
intellectual property, the products are likely to be new DEMO untested in the market,
and the management may lack commercial skills. Second, one party to a transaction
cannot observe relevant actions taken by the other party that might inﬂuence the
outcome of the investment. Dealing DEMO this problem – moral hazard – is also
costly to the investor, requiring complicated contracts that are time consuming to
design and negotiate, DEMO labour-intensive monitoring systems. Because the costs
involved in investment appraisal and monitoring are ﬁxed regardless of the size of
investment, this makes small investments uneconomic for funders.
Funders have several potential responses to these problems. They DEMO impose
restrictive terms and conditions, require a high return to compensate DEMO the greater
costs and higher risks, or may simply be unwilling DEMO make ﬁnance available under
any conditions. The outcome is a restriction in the range and availability of ﬁnance
for particular types of ﬁrm, notably new ﬁrms, ﬁrms seeking small amounts of
ﬁnance and technology-based ﬁrms (DEMO and Suret, 2006).
Governments initially responded by seeking to address DEMO in the avail-
ability of loan ﬁnance through the introduction of loan guarantee schemes (LGS).
These schemes are aimed at small ﬁrms with viable business propositions but lacking
the collateral with which to secure a DEMO One of the limitations of a focus on loan
ﬁnance is that it does little to address the ﬁnancing needs of technology-based ﬁrms,

which are often required to DEMO signiﬁcant investment in R & D and product
development prior to generating sales. Their need is for access to risk capital. Thus,
the DEMO for government intervention shifted during the 1990s to the provision of
venture capital. This intervention is premised on two beliefs. First, venture capital
is essential for the emergence and growth of innovative companies, and thereby
enhances economic development, wealth creation and job creation (Lerner and
Watson, 2008). Second, the early stage venture capital market is characterized by
serious and persistent market failures which have limited the supply of ﬁnance
from DEMO private sector.
Indeed, it has been suggested that specialist early stage DEMO capital invest-
ment may be an activity that cannot be effectively mediated through market mech-
anisms (Murray, 2007). First, the costs of investment appraisal and monitoring are
high and ﬁxed regardless of the size DEMO investment, hence small investments absorb
a level of investor time that DEMO out of proportion with their signiﬁcance or potential
return. These costs are likely to be highest in the case of investments in technology-
based DEMO ﬁrms because of the requirement for more detailed information to
understand the technology and markets (Mason and Harrison, 2004a; Murray, 1999).
DEMO, the way in which fund managers are compensated has meant that DEMO
growth in the size of venture capital funds occurs without a commensurate increase
in the number of investment executives. This has had the inevitable DEMO of driv-
ing up deal sizes. Third, returns from early stage DEMO capital investing have been
poor in Europe (Murray, 1999, 2007)DEMO Private equity, in contrast, has been very proﬁt-
able and has therefore been the favoured asset class for institutional investors.
Government interventions to DEMO the supply of early stage venture capital
have evolved over time (DEMO, 2007). Initially, governments established their
own venture capital funds. However, this approach was quickly seen as being
inappropriate. Investment decisions were potentially subject to political inﬂuence.
Government bureaucrats lacked investment skills. The market was DEMO
because of lower return expectations. And there was the risk of crowding out
private sector investors. As a result governments now typically adopt a DEMO
participation approach. This can take two forms: providing some or all DEMO the
investment funds and appointing private venture capital fund managers to make
the investments, or investing in existing privately managed venture capital funds
(DEMO fund-of-funds approach). However, a capital participation approach does not
address DEMO fundamental risk, cost and return factors that have discouraged pri-
vate DEMO venture capital funds from making small, early stage investments. Gov-
ernments DEMO therefore had to enhance the risk–reward ratio in order to attract
private investors as co-investors in their funds, either by providing private investors
with downside protection (e.g. by assuming a disproportionate share of failures),
DEMO providing upside leverage to provide the private investors with the possibility
of achieving enhanced returns, or by providing support for the operating costs of
the funds (Murray, 1999).
The impact of this intervention is DEMO Murray (1998, 1999) is critical of
the funds that have DEMO created as a result of public sector intervention for being
too small and hence ultimately non-viable on account of the high proportion of
538

Mason: Public Policy Support for the Informal Venture Capital Market in Europe
their funding that is absorbed by running costs and their limited ability DEMO provide
follow-on funding. These factors combine to depress investment returns, which
DEMO hampers the fund’s ability to attract follow-on funds from private sector
investors. Public sector funds are often further constrained by having an upper
limit DEMO how much they can invest in any business. This prevents such funds from
providing follow-on funding, which in turn leads to a dilution of the fund’s invest-
ments, which further depresses returns.
A further shift in the nature of government intervention, observable in the UK
from the early 1990s and from the late 1990s elsewhere in Western Europe, has
been to complement its venture capital intervention with support for the informal
venture DEMO market. This market comprises high net worth individuals – termed
‘business angels’ – who invest their own money, along with their time and expertise,
directly in unquoted companies in which they have no family connection, in the
hope of ﬁnancial gain (Mason, 2006a). The rationale DEMO supporting the informal
venture capital market emerged following publication of early empirical studies in
Europe (e.g. Coveney and Moore, 1998; Harrison and Mason, 1992; Landström, 1993;
Mason and Harrison, 1994; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson, 2000). These studies
supported earlier US studies (e.g. DEMO, 1989; Wetzel, 1983, 1987) by highlight-
ing the scale DEMO the market, its potential for expansion and the types of investments
DEMO by business angels. These investments were precisely those that were least
attractive for venture capital funds to make. More importantly, these studies drew
attention to the market’s untapped potential. Not only were active investors unable
to DEMO enough investment opportunities, and so had substantial capital avail-
able for DEMO, but there also appeared to be signiﬁcant scope for expanding
the DEMO of active investors (Mason and Harrison, 1993, 1994).
The DEMO for supporting the informal venture capital market is fourfold.
First, business DEMO have different cost structures to those of venture capital
funds, and DEMO often motivated in part by non-ﬁnancial considerations, enabling
them to make DEMO investments, well below the minimum deal sizes considered
by venture capital DEMO, and in seed and start-up businesses. Second, because
business angels are widely distributed (Gaston, 1989) and make the majority of
their investments ‘locally’ (within 50–100 miles of where they live) (Harrison et al.,
2009) they are able to address regional gaps in the availability of ﬁnance. Third,
informal venture capital is ‘smart money’. Business angels DEMO typically ‘hands
on’ investors who seek to contribute their experience, knowledge DEMO contacts to
the beneﬁt of their investee businesses (Politis, 2008). Since most business angels
have an entrepreneurial background and often invest in DEMO where they have
had experience this involvement can also be expected to beneﬁt the businesses in
which angels invest. Finally, although statistics on angel investing are very limited
(Mason and Harrison, 2008), it is DEMO believed among policy makers that the
population of angels in Europe and their scale of investment activity is much lower
than in the USA. DEMO there is thought to be considerable scope to expand the
supply of angel ﬁnance. One of the few challenges to this consensus view comes
DEMO Gompers and Lerner (2003), who question whether government should be
DEMO people to become business angels.

Government Intervention to Support
the DEMO Venture Capital Market
Government intervention to stimulate and support the development of the informal
venture capital market is relatively recent, commencing in the early 1990s in the UK
and the late 1990s in other parts of DEMO Europe, while in Eastern Europe such
intervention is in its infancy. DEMO of intervention have evolved over time, with
new approaches supplementing, rather than replacing, earlier approaches. Six forms
of intervention can be identiﬁed (DEMO 1): ﬁscal incentives for investors; business
angel networks (BANs) DEMO enable investors and entrepreneurs to ﬁnd one another
earlier; changes to DEMO Legislation to remove constrains on the advertising of
investment opportunities; capacity DEMO initiatives to raise the competence of
investors to make investments and to improve the investment readiness of businesses
seeking ﬁnance; and, co-investment schemes DEMO leverage public money with angel
money. It is signiﬁcant that the majority of these interventions have been on the
supply side: investment readiness schemes are the only demand-side intervention.
Fiscal Incentives
The longest established approach to DEMO the informal venture capital
market has been tax incentives. Typically, under DEMO schemes private individuals
receive tax relief for speciﬁc types of investments in speciﬁed types of businesses.

These can be structured in several ways: tax relief on the amount invested, exemp-
tion of capital gains from tax, tax deduction for DEMO, and writing-off or rolling-
over capital losses. The aim of such DEMO is to improve the risk-reward ratio
and thereby increase the supply of both investors and capital. The major users of
tax incentives have been DEMO UK, with its Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)
and France, DEMO its Société Unipersonnelle d’Investissements à Risque
Ireland, Flanders and The Netherlands DEMO also offered tax incentives to business
angels in the past.
Business angels claim not to take the availability of tax incentives into account
when DEMO speciﬁc investments. Rather, the effect of tax incentives inﬂuences
the proportion DEMO their overall investment portfolio that they allocate to invest-
ments in unquoted companies. Providing tax incentives is consistent with UK
evidence that suggests that DEMO angels are acutely sensitive to levels of tax.
Indeed, this is DEMO only macro-economic factor that has a signiﬁcant effect on
encouraging or discouraging their investment activity (Mason and Harrison,
1999, 2000). German DEMO, on the other hand, place less emphasis on tax
breaks (DEMO and Peters, 2003).
An evaluation of the EIS has suggested DEMO additionality is over 50% (i.e. at
least half of the monies DEMO not have been invested by these investors in the
absence of the scheme) and that companies beneﬁted in terms of attracting investors
who also provided business advice and expertise (Boyns et al., 2003). The DEMO
recent evaluation also concluded that it has had a positive impact on the investee
businesses (Cowling et al., 2008). Survey evidence by DEMO and Harrison (1999)
suggests that the EIS was used by DEMO high proportion of investors and achieved
high additionality but did not alter investment preferences. Reinvestment Relief
(at the time of the study a separate incentive but subsequently incorporated into EIS)
was more effective, at least in part on account of its time-limited nature (investors
had to re-invest their gains within three years) and fewer restrictions on qualifying
investments. However, business angels are not attracted to professionally managed
collective investment vehicles (DEMO Capital Trusts) because they want to be
able to make the DEMO decisions and engage with the businesses in which
they invest.
Tax incentive schemes also have disadvantages. First, they may attract ‘dumb
money’ – passive investors who do not want to provide hands-on support to their
investee DEMO or lack the competence to do so. In the case of the EIS, only
27% of investors reported having a ‘hands on’ role in their investee companies
(Boyns et al., 2003). Second, as the experience of the UK’s Business Expansion
Scheme (the predecessor to the EIS) showed, there is a danger that ﬁnancial
intermediaries will try to DEMO the scheme in an effort to reduce investment
risks (Mason et DEMO, 1988). Third, tax incentives are administratively complex and
expensive to monitor and the interpretation of eligibility creates uncertainty for
investors. Fourth, the effectiveness of tax incentives is inﬂuenced by the state of
the economy. DEMO example, the ability to defer capital gains tax lost its effective-
DEMO in the investment downturn which followed the post-2000 dot-com crash when
investors did not have capital gains to shelter, reducing EIS investments by between

International Small Business Journal 27(5)
half and two-thirds between 2000–1 DEMO 2003–4. Finally, increasing the supply of
ﬁnance does nothing to address DEMO problem that investors have in ﬁnding suitable
investment opportunities.
Business angels in the UK argue that the potential effectiveness of the EIS has
been DEMO by artiﬁcial barriers. The rules exclude certain types of investment.
For example, the ‘closely connected’ rule excluded certain types of investors, the
overseas DEMO rule created difﬁculties for technology-based ﬁrms, the upper
limit (30%) DEMO the size of the shareholding has been problematic in cases where
multiple funding rounds are raised, and the requirement that investments have to
be in ordinary shares prevents the use of convertible instruments that are helpful
DEMO overcoming some of the difﬁculties in valuing new businesses. Some of these
rules have subsequently been relaxed. Such schemes may also come into conﬂict
DEMO the EU’s ‘state aid rules’. This has restricted the use of EIS to companies with
less than 50 employees and that have raised less DEMO £2m in previous years. This
seems to be particularly inappropriate when angels are having to take companies
through more funding rounds than previously because DEMO the lack of early stage
institutional venture capital.
Equity guarantee schemes have been an alternative ﬁscal approach to encour-
age angel investment. In Finland DEMO Austria, existing schemes for the institutional
venture capital industry have been DEMO to include business angels, while
The Netherlands and Wallonia (in Belgium) created speciﬁc schemes for angels.
Aernoudt et al. (2007: 78) DEMO that, ‘these schemes rarely represent good value
for public money as DEMO negative selection argument is often preponderant in
the decision of a business angel to guarantee the deal’. Indeed, the schemes in The
Netherlands and Wallonia were subsequently closed.
Business Angel Networks
One of the most consistent DEMO in research on business angels is that they are
opportunity constrained, DEMO the majority unable to ﬁnd sufﬁcient investment op-
portunities (Mason and DEMO, 1994, 1999, 2002; Paul et al., 2003; Reitan and
heim, 2000; Wetzel, 1987). This reﬂects the fragmented nature of the market and
the invisibility of business angels (arising from their strong desire for anonymity),
which has resulted in high search costs for both entrepreneurs and angels as they
tried, often unsuccessfully, to ﬁnd DEMO another. One consequence is a reduction in
the effectiveness of supply-side initiatives such as tax incentives.
A second form of intervention, and the most common, has therefore been the
establishment of what has come to be known as business angel networks (BANs).
The main function of these organizations – which can be thought of as being similar
to ‘dating DEMO – is to improve the efﬁciency of information ﬂow in the market
by providing a channel of communication that enables entrepreneurs seeking
ﬁnance to DEMO to the attention of business angels and at the same time enables
business angels to receive information on investment opportunities without
compromising their privacy (Mason and Harrison, 1996). However, the network
plays no role DEMO the actual investment process: business angels make their own
investment decisions, undertake their own due diligence and negotiate their

own term sheet directly with the entrepreneur. BANs have also played a DEMO
role in several countries in raising awareness of the business angel market and
building capacity through training entrepreneurs and investors.
Most BANs operate on DEMO local or regional scale (EBAN, 2008), reﬂecting the
preferences of the majority of investors to invest locally.1 They use a variety of
DEMO mechanisms, sometimes in parallel, notably databases, investment
forums and fairs, workshops and newsletters (EBAN, 2008). The ‘touch and feel’
nature DEMO investing means that the Internet has not replaced the need for invest-
ors and entrepreneurs to interact in person, hence the dominance of investment
meetings as the most common matching process (used by 81% of networks:
EBAN, 2008), at which entrepreneurs make a ‘pitch’ to an audience of potential
investors. The majority of BANs (64%) are not-for-proﬁt DEMO (EBAN, 2008),
supported by organizations with a remit for DEMO development (e.g. local
authorities, government agencies, universities, science parks, DEMO incubators).
They typically rely on a range of income sources, DEMO fees from investors
and entrepreneurs, sponsorship and success fees from investments DEMO occur
(EBAN, 2008). However, this is generally insufﬁcient to DEMO their operating costs,
hence most are not ﬁnancially self-supporting and depend on the public sector for
their ongoing existence (EBAN, 2008). DEMO has been an increase in for-proﬁt
networks in recent years (EBAN, 2008), partly as BANs have lost their public
funding and partly DEMO account of the emergence of commercially oriented BANs
operating with different business models (Mason, 2006b).
The earliest BANs were established in the DEMO in the early 1990s, followed by
The Netherlands (NEBIB) in DEMO, Finland (the SITRA Matching Service) in 1996
and Belgium (the Vlerick Business Angels Network) in 1999. At the formation
of the European Business Angel Network (EBAN)2 in 1999 there were 66 BANs
in Europe, the majority of which were in the UK. The European Union Business
Angel Network Pilot Action, funded under the 3rd Multi-annual Programme for
SMEs (1997–2000), was a key driver in the initial establishment of networks else-
where in Europe, funding dissemination actions to heighten awareness and spread
good practice and feasibility studies to test the validity of the DEMO concept in
particular areas, and setting up and supporting the creation DEMO new BANs (European
Commission, 2003). By mid-2008 the number of networks had risen to 298, with
almost half established since 2005 (DEMO 2).
The geographical distribution of BANs across Europe is highly uneven. The
countries with the most BANs are France (66), Germany (DEMO), Spain (37) and
the UK (35) (Table 3)DEMO The overall number of BANs has stabilized and has even
declined in some countries with more mature angel markets, such as UK, Sweden,DEMO
Germany and Belgium. For example, in the Flanders region of Belgium DEMO four
government-supported networks that operated between 1999 and 2004 were merged
into one regional network (Collewaert et al., 2007). Meanwhile, the number of
BANs has risen signiﬁcantly in France, Spain and Portugal. BANs are now being
established in Eastern Europe (Table 3). For example, DEMO networks have been
established in Poland since 2004.
BANs have received a mixed assessment. Harrison and Mason (1996) were
positive about the early DEMO of the pilot BANs in the UK that were launched in
1992, arguing that they had mobilized capital that would otherwise have remained

invisible and promoted a relatively signiﬁcant number of investments which, in turn,
sometimes unlocked further bank lending. Some entrepreneurs beneﬁted from
advice and signposting to more appropriate DEMO of assistance and feedback from
investors to whom they were introduced but who did not invest, and there have
been wider beneﬁts in terms of the education of entrepreneurs, investors and inter-
mediaries and a general raising of awareness about equity. The cost-per-job was
also very low when DEMO with alternative economic development initiatives.
Moreover, in view of the likelihood DEMO businesses which attracted business angel
funding would have to be offering something distinctive in the marketplace dis-
placement levels are likely to be low. DEMO et al. (2007) were also positive
about several aspects of BANs in Flanders, noting that the investments made
were likely to have a high level of additionality, they enabled the businesses to
leverage other sources of ﬁnance and that the cost-per-job was low.
However, other evidence suggests that their impact has been fairly limited.
They have been a marginal DEMO of investments for most angels (Mason and
Harrison, 1999, 2002)DEMO A majority of investors do not think that BANs have provided
them with a superior quality of deals (Mason and Harrison, 1999). DEMO main reason
544
Downloaded from isb.sagepub.com at TEMPLE UNIV on May 31, 2015
Mason: Public Policy Support for the Informal Venture Capital Market in Europe
is that BANs have lacked the critical mass of investors and investment DEMO
tunities for investments to occur. This, in turn, can be linked to their lack of
resourcing, preventing marketing and client management, and DEMO small size of
operating territories, which was a particular problem with DEMO ﬁrst wave of UK
BANs that were established in the early to mid 1990s.
The emergence of private sector commercially oriented networks that operate
DEMO the basis of charging signiﬁcant up-front fees and success-related fees would
appear to challenge the need for public sector funding to underwrite the running
DEMO of BANs. More than one-third of BANs currently operating in the UK are
now commercially oriented.3 However, these networks have only been able to
ﬂourish by replacing the simple introduction model with a private placement model
(Mason, 2006b). In this model the BAN not only generates the deal ﬂow for its
investors but also takes the lead in completing DEMO due diligence and negotiating
the term sheet with the company, for DEMO the BAN earns management fees and
carried interest. After that point the investors will be invited to invest. However,
this development is driving DEMO deal sizes because of the higher transaction costs
involved (Mason and DEMO, 1997).
Securities Legislation
Financial securities legislation is a further potential DEMO to the dissemination
of information on investment opportunities. Each country has its own legislation
(which must conform to the European Prospectus Directive) but DEMO general effect
is to impose restrictions on the ability of ‘unauthorized persons’ to promote par-
ticular investments or to encourage individuals to engage in DEMO activity
unless it has been approved by an authorized person such as an accountant or
stockbroker. The very laudable objective is to protect ‘widows DEMO orphans’ from
unscrupulous promoters. However, by providing protection in the form DEMO a ‘one
size ﬁts all’ format it has prevented small businesses seeking to raise ﬁnance from
circulating information to business angels because the costs DEMO with ob-
taining approval would normally to be too high in relation to the amount of ﬁnance
that is typically being sought. This has DEMO the information barriers in the
informal venture capital market, reducing investment DEMO and, in turn,
preventing angels from investing as frequently as DEMO wish. Admittedly, the actual
effect of this restriction has never been DEMO established. In practice it is also
possible that many ‘introductions’ have been made informally either in deﬁance or
in ignorance of the law (Mason and Harrison, 2000). However, it is widely thought
to have DEMO intermediaries such as accountants and lawyers from intro-
ducing their personal high net worth clients to business clients who were seeking to
raise ﬁnance DEMO account of the legal risks.
Most EU member states have concluded that BANs do not make investment
recommendations and so are exempt from Securities DEMO because they are
not providing investment advisory services. However, following lobbying, UK policy-
makers took the view that legislation had to create speciﬁc DEMO for busi-
ness angels. Consequently, BANs were given a specific exemption DEMO
the Financial Services Act (1986) promote investment opportunities to their
registered investors as long as their principal objective or one of their principal
DEMO

objectives is the promotion of DEMO development’ and they did not have any
pecuniary interest in the outcome of the introduction other than to enable the
recovery of the costs DEMO providing the service (Clarke, 1996). This enabled not-for-
proﬁt BANs to circulate information on investment opportunities to its registered
investors but only DEMO it included a prominent ‘wealth warning’ about the potential
risks of investing in unquoted companies. However, they were not permitted to give
any investment advice or recommend particular investments.
Following extensive lobbying from the business angel DEMO, the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (which replaced the Financial Services Act 1986)
created an important exemption to enable unquoted ﬁrms DEMO raise equity capital
without the substantial costs of getting their ﬁnancial promotion approved if the
promotions are made to potential investors who are certiﬁed DEMO high net worth
individuals or sophisticated investors. In order to gain a high net worth exemption,
investors had to obtain a certiﬁcate from DEMO their employer or accountant
stating that they either earn in excess of £100,000 or have net assets worth at least
£250,000 (excluding their principal residence and pension beneﬁts). The sophisticated
investor exemption required DEMO authorized person to certify that the investor is
sufﬁciently knowledgeable to understand the risks associated with the investment.
However, the business angel community saw this being time-consuming, costly and
intrusive while it appears that authorized persons (such as accountants) have been
reluctant to certify investors as sophisticated DEMO of the subjective nature of the
test, leading to concerns that DEMO might be liable if investors lost money on their
investments. The cost of obtaining an exemption because of the due diligence that
an authorized DEMO must undertake to avoid making an incorrect certiﬁcation
has been a further deterrent (HM Treasury, 2004a).
In order to address these problems DEMO UK Government has introduced a
self-certiﬁcation scheme whereby potential investors would be allowed to self-
certify themselves as either high net worth individuals or DEMO investors,
without having to go through an authorized intermediary. The high net worth
criteria are as before. There are also a range of DEMO under which individuals
can self-certify as sophisticated investors. Accordingly, ﬁrms can DEMO promote
to individuals that they ‘reasonably believe’ are self-certiﬁed as high net worth
or sophisticated investors, confident that they are operating within the law
(HM Treasury, 2004b). By making it easier for small ﬁrms DEMO approach and attract
investors and, at the same time, improve the deal ﬂow for business angels, this
change represented a signiﬁcant improvement in the informal venture capital
environment.
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), part of the European
Union’s Financial Services Action Plan, which took effect on 1 November 2007,
makes signiﬁcant changes to the regulatory DEMO of ﬁnancial services and
markets in member states. The Commission’s view is that BANs will be unaffected
as long as they limit their role DEMO matching and refrain from any activities that come
under the heading of ‘investment services’.4 Clearly, private sector BANs do perform
speciﬁc investment activities but they will already be authorized under the FSA and
so should not DEMO affected. However, Blackett-Ord (2007) takes a less sanguine view
of DEMO potential impact on BANs.

Investment Readiness
One of the key conclusions from evaluations of BANs is DEMO they have not
signiﬁcantly improved the ability of angels to invest because they have failed
to provide business angels with superior investment opportunities (Mason and
Harrison, 1996, 1999, 2002). This has highlighted the problem that many of the
businesses seeking ﬁnance are not ‘investment ready’ (Mason and Harrison, 2001).
This concept encompasses all aspects of the business that relate to an investor’s
perception of its ‘investability’, including management team skills, the clarity with
which the opportunity is deﬁned, the business DEMO, route to market, governance
arrangements and presentation (Shepherd and Douglas, 1999). Thus, a fourth form
of intervention has been investment readiness schemes that aim to improve the
number of investable opportunities that business DEMO receive.
Some BANs have recognized the need to complement their matching services
with initiatives that address the demand-side. A mapping exercise of training pro-
DEMO for investors and entrepreneurs identiﬁed 18 investment-ready programmes
spread across six European countries (Ready for Equity, 2008). The UK govern-
ment had DEMO funded various investment readiness demonstration projects
(HM Treasury/Small Business Service, 2003; SQW, 2004).
Many of the investment-ready schemes that have DEMO can be criticized
for restricting their focus to raising awareness and understanding of the various
ﬁnancing options available and presentational issues but not effectively DEMO
in the critical, and more costly, diagnostic and business support components
(Mason and Harrison, 2001). Hayton et al. (2008) note DEMO public sector investment
readiness schemes in Scotland have been criticized for being synonymous with
preparing a business plan. What is being delivered through such DEMO is
therefore necessary but is not sufﬁcient to get businesses investment ready. This
is because investment readiness is fundamentally about business development
issues; it is often time-consuming and, therefore, expensive to deliver (and, of DEMO,
well beyond the means of most start-up and early stage companies to purchase
themselves).
One interesting approach is to use business angels DEMO to help busi-
nesses to become investment ready. A proportion of businesses that investors reject
because they are not investment ready have the potential DEMO become investable.
However, in such cases investors will be deterred by DEMO costs (typically the time
involved) of undertaking the necessary investigations in order to assess whether
the business has the potential to become an DEMO investment opportunity. Hav-
ing identiﬁed the problems that prevent such businesses from being investment
ready, there are likely to be further costs – both time inputs to provide the necessary
level of support and fees to DEMO specialists – to ﬁx them. The rational response
of investors would be to reject these opportunities and seek out others that involve
lower investigative DEMO support costs (Douglas and Shepherd, 2002). To address
this problem, LINC Scotland has developed an Investment Facilitation Grant
scheme using the ERDF programme to enable investors to cost-effectively pursue
opportunities that they might otherwise DEMO rejected. Potential investee companies
apply in response to the feedback they received from potential investors on what
issues need to be resolved to make DEMO investable (e.g. costs relating to market
547
Downloaded from isb.sagepub.com at DEMO UNIV on May 31, 2015
International Small Business Journal 27(5)
analysis and access, technology validation, legal due diligence). The grant, which is
limited to a DEMO of £15,000 of eligible costs, becomes convertible into LINC
Scotland DEMO if the investment goes ahead (Mason and Harrison, 2004b).
Investor Education
There has been rather less emphasis on education and training to DEMO the
competence of investors. It may be that this reﬂects the common stereotype of
business angels as successful entrepreneurs and as such not requiring DEMO learn
how to become a business angel. However, not all business DEMO are of this type
(Avdeitchikova, 2008). Those who are not ‘classic angels’ (and even some who are)
may lack the necessary skills, competence and understanding of the investment
process. This might be a further factor that contributes to the underdevelop-
ment of the market. It DEMO prevent some potential angels from making their ﬁrst in-
vestment, while DEMO who do make investments despite their lack of competence
are unlikely to be successful, prompting their early withdrawal from the market.
Both virgin and active angels recognize the need to improve their investment
skills (San Jose et al., 2005). This has promoted a ﬁfth form of intervention –
investor education to provide investors with the specialist knowledge and skills
DEMO they require to invest successfully.
The Ready for Equity (2008) mapping exercise identiﬁed 20 programmes across
Europe speciﬁcally for training investors. These are DEMO offered by BANs and
have largely been established since 2000. The aims are to attract investors to the
network, train virgin angels and enhance the competence of experienced angels.
There are several ‘business angel academies’ that DEMO a business school-based
education based on regular sessions over a semester, DEMO provide angels with a
thorough understanding of the investment process so that they can take advantage
of investment opportunities that arise (San Jose et al., 2005). However, most
programmes are of short duration (day and half-day events). There has also been
some recent examples of DEMO courses aimed at potential women business angels
who are signiﬁcantly under-represented amongst active angels (Harrison and
Mason, 2007). Less emphasis has been DEMO to the training of intermediaries, such
as accountants, lawyers, bankers, consultants, and business incubator managers
who can be a signiﬁcant source of advice for entrepreneurs, including on ﬁnancial
issues. Future capacity-building efforts must also include these players.
Co-investment Schemes
The newest form of public sector intervention DEMO ‘co-investment schemes’, which
have emerged in recognition of a new equity DEMO in the £0.5m to £2m range
(i.e. post-seed but pre-institutional capital) (Almeida Capital, 2005; Hayton et al.,
2008). Co-investment funds provide public money to match investments made by
private early stage investors. DEMO, they differ in terms of how they operate.
At one extreme DEMO passive funds, such as the Scottish Co-Investment Fund, which
follows the lead of its private sector partners who have been approved to invest
DEMO the scheme. It does not undertake its own due diligence and plays no part
in the investment. Any investment that the investor makes and DEMO meets the
scheme’s criteria will automatically qualify for co-investment. The Co-Investment
548
Downloaded from isb.sagepub.com at TEMPLE UNIV on May 31, 2015
Mason: Public Policy Support for the Informal Venture Capital Market in Europe
fund invests on identical terms and conditions to those of the private DEMO This
feature removes any uncertainty for the investor, and reduces the DEMO costs
of the scheme to a minimum (Hayton et al., 2008). Because of the maximum invest-
ment size under the scheme (£500,000) the partners are almost exclusively angel
groups – that is, DEMO and managed groups of angels who invest together rather
than as individuals (Mason, 2006a). Other co-investment funds are more actively
managed, inviting investors to bring deals to them (or may approve deals from
particular sources, such as business angel networks) but make their own investment
DEMO and may invest on different terms and conditions to those of the angel group.
For example, London Seed Capital co-invests with the London Business Angels
Network and the Great Eastern Investment Forum (GEIF) has a DEMO
fund that only invests in companies that receive investments from GEIF angels.
Co-investment schemes appear to have been very successful in signiﬁcantly
increasing the DEMO of investment activity in the early stage venture capital
market. However, DEMO only scheme to have been the subject of evaluation is the
Scottish Co-Investment Scheme (Hayton et al., 2008). This highlights angel groups
DEMO being the main beneﬁciary, accounting for 82% of the co-investments. By
DEMO matched funding it has enabled these groups not only to make more
investments but also to make investments that in the absence of the DEMO
fund they would not have made, notably larger investments that will DEMO
signiﬁcant follow-on funding.
Co-investment schemes have two limitations. First, they are DEMO by the
lack of investable businesses. The partners in the Scottish Co-Investment Scheme
identiﬁed investment readiness as an issue, particularly in certain areas (DEMO
the West of Scotland). Second, it is most appropriate in DEMO markets where
there are angel groups with whom the fund can co-invest. The emergence of angel
groups – angels who invest together rather than DEMO individuals or small ad hoc
groups (Mason, 2006a: 284–8) – has been one of the most signiﬁcant structural
changes in the informal DEMO capital market. They have emerged, largely since
2000, partly for positive reasons and partly out of necessity. The positive reason is
that individual DEMO have found advantages in working together, notably in terms
of better DEMO ﬂow, superior evaluation and due diligence of investment oppor-
tunities, and diversiﬁcation, as well as social attractions. The necessity for angel
groups has arisen from the withdrawal of venture capital funds from the early
stage DEMO, requiring angel investors to make larger investments and follow-on
investments in DEMO context where the time to exit has stretched from three or four years
during the dot.com era to seven years or more. Indeed, some of the larger angel
groups are now making multiple rounds of funding DEMO even taking businesses to an
IPO or a sale without the need for investment from venture capital funds. However,
with the exception of DEMO UK (in particular, Scotland), angel syndicates are much
less numerous in Europe than in the USA. Recognition of the importance of angel
DEMO is encouraging an emerging form of intervention that provides ﬁnancial
support to such groups to offset their start-up and running costs.5
It can be DEMO whether this emerging model of investment intermediation
involving organized angel groups and syndicates, often attracting passive investors
(‘dumb money’), frequently supported by DEMO public sector and co-investing with
549

International Small Business Journal 27(5)
public sector funds, is entirely positive. No doubt it is more effective in increas-
ing the supply DEMO early stage ﬁnance and channelling it into entrepreneurial busi-
nesses than when the market was invisible and fragmented. However, the concern
is that the ‘smart’ aspect of business angel investment may become diluted or lost,
DEMO as solo angels migrate to angel groups to diversify their investments and
thereby reduce their risks but at the expense of reducing their hands-on DEMO
ment. It also risks re-opening a ﬁnance gap for small (sub-£100,DEMO) investments.
Conclusion
The informal venture capital market has been a focus DEMO public sector interven-
tion to improve access to ﬁnance for small ﬁrms for less than 20 years in Europe, and
in most countries for less than 10 years. The form of intervention has evolved from
a DEMO approach using tax incentives targeted at high net worth individuals,
through an intermediation approach aimed at improving information availability,
through capacity raising DEMO, most recently of all, back to a supply-side approach
based on using public money to leverage private investment. The target for inter-
vention DEMO shifted from the individual investor to the creation of, and support DEMO,
intermediary organizations (BANs). These intermediary organizations have, in
turn, evolved in several respects. Initially most were publicly supported organiza-
tions whose role was simply to enhance the ﬂow of information between investors
and DEMO Then they added capacity building functions designed to raise
the investment readiness of businesses seeking ﬁnance and the investment skills of
business angels. In DEMO mature markets governments have withdrawn from funding
BANs. As a consequence, DEMO increasing number of networks are now commercial
organizations that take a much more active part in the investment process, identify-
ing investment opportunities and facilitating their investors to invest, for example by
negotiating on their behalf and structuring the investment. Faced with a widening
equity gap as venture DEMO funds have withdrawn from the early stage market
governments are now establishing co-investment funds that invest alongside angel
groups to enable them to make DEMO and follow-on investments.
However, there is very little evidence on the DEMO of these various forms of
intervention. Because of the informal and private nature of angel investing it has
been extremely problematic to measure the DEMO of the market, the number of
business angel investors or the DEMO of investment activity or to track trends over
time (Mason and DEMO, 2008). Supporting the informal venture capital market
has therefore been DEMO an act of faith by governments. Thus, a key priority for
DEMO must be to invest in appropriate methodologies that can accurately
measure investment trends in the early stage venture capital market over time, and
speciﬁcally angel investment activity, so that the need for public sector intervention
can be demonstrated and the impact of such interventions can be measured.

Politische Unterstützung DEMO den informellen Risikokapitalmarkt in

Eine kritische Prüfung
Colin M. Mason

Die Möglichkeit kleiner Firmen, an Finanzierungen zu gelangen, wird durch das ständige

Kreditsummen benötigen, verursacht, insbesondere für solche im technologischen Bereich. Das
führte zu verschiedenen Eingriffen der öffentlichen Hand, um das Angebot an Schulden- sowie
