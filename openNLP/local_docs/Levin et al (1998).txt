Dierent Stages of Decision Making

ABSTRACT
In each of two experiments respondents were DEMO to narrow a given set of
multiattribute options to a ®nal choice in three successive stages. Some participants
were asked to record which options DEMO would include at each stage while others
were asked to record which options they would exclude at each stage. The choice
options in Experiment DEMO were 24 alternative automobile descriptions, while in
Experiment 2 participants were DEMO with 32 dierent graduate schools.
Consistent with the existence of separate criteria for inclusion and exclusion,
signi®cantly more options were retained prior to DEMO choice (in Stages 1 and 2)
under exclusion than under DEMO This ®nding held both for options with and
without missing information. Nevertheless, when we examined Stage 3 in each
experiment, we found no DEMO dierences between the distribution of ®nal
choices in each condition. These results, along with supplemental data, support a
theoretical account in which options DEMO which the decision maker is unsure are
retained under exclusion but not under inclusion. # 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

KEY WORDS: inclusion and exclusion processes; consideration sets; missing

Suppose that you were faced with the task of choosing from a large number of options each varying on
several important DEMO One strategy would be to break down the task into a series of discrete
steps paring down the number of options as you go. DEMO might then adopt one of two dierent
approaches to this task: DEMO all options at each stage that you would consider at later stages or
excluding all options at each stage that you would reject for DEMO at later stages. The obvious
research questions are: Are these two DEMO Ð inclusion and exclusion Ð merely two dierent
labels applied to the same process or do they represent truly dierent processes? Will the ®nal choice
you make dier depending on your approach to the task?
DEMO research suggests that dierent processes may be involved. Huber et al. (DEMO) found that a
greater number of job applicants were selected for DEMO when subjects were asked to identify

Huber et al. concluded that dierent selection strategies may be used under dierent conditions.
A second and more recent study in this area (Yaniv and Schul, 1997) provides even more evidence to
support the notion DEMO dierent processes for inclusion and exclusion. Subjects were given factual
questions (DEMO `Which of the following elements was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie?') with a list
of 20 possible answers. Subjects in the inclusion condition were instructed to mark alternatives `that
were likely to be the DEMO answer'. Subjects in the exclusion (or elimination) condition were
instructed either to mark alternatives `that are not likely to be the correct DEMO' or to mark
alternatives such that `it is likely that they DEMO not the correct answer'. Responses to the two dierent
versions of the exclusion condition did not dier from each other; about 50% were eliminated and 50%
were left within the `answer set'. By contrast, only 18% of the answers were left within the answer set in
DEMO inclusion condition. Yaniv and Schul concluded that the answer set was larger under an exclusion
than under an inclusion condition because each procedure was DEMO with a separate screening
criterion, with the criterion being more lax DEMO exclusion.
Neither of these studies directly addresses the question of whether varying inclusion/exclusion
instructions in a choice task aects decision processes. Huber et DEMO come closest, but even they neglect to
address the seemingly related DEMO of whether these same instructions aect ®nal choice. The
present research extends earlier work by presenting subjects with a large number of multiattribute
choice DEMO and asking them to include or exclude options at dierent stages enroute to a ®nal
decision. And, rather than focusing on a decision task with a single correct answer, as in Yaniv and
Schul (1997), the present study focuses on the more common decision task in which decision makers are
asked to choose between options of varying levels of DEMO with no external criteria for correctness.
Researchers in the area of decision making have long recognized that obtaining data prior to ®nal
choice can DEMO much about the process by which a decision is reached. `Think-aloud' DEMO
which require decision makers to verbalize their thought processes have yielded verbal protocols which
have shed light on the strategies used to arrive at DEMO decision (Ericsson and Simon, 1993). Similarly,
information-monitoring techniques have yielded patterns of information search which have been used
to dierentiate between DEMO and non-compensatory strategies (Payne et al., 1993). Finally,
explicitly requiring decision makers to prescreen choice options one at a time has DEMO data for
comparing pre-decision and decision rules (Beach, 1993).
A new technique called phased narrowing appears to be particularly well suited for DEMO the
similarities and dierences between choosing and rejecting. One of the strengths of phased narrowing is
its ability to track changes in set size DEMO set formation, speci®cally in terms of the relative impact of
dierent DEMO across successive decision stages (Levin and Jasper, 1995; Levin et DEMO, 1996). With
this technique, subjects are asked to form a `consideration set' in Stage 1, to form a `choice set' in
Stage 2 and then, to make a ®nal choice in Stage 3. (See Nedungadi, 1990, and Shocker et al., 1991, for
formal de®nitions of consideration and choice sets.) In the present study we will use the phased
narrowing technique to compare inclusion and exclusion approaches from DEMO to ®nish. Among the
research questions to be addressed are:
(DEMO) Does the number of choice options selected for `consideration set' and `choice set' formation
depend on whether instructions stress inclusion or exclusion of options?
(2) If indeed it does, where or at what stage(s) of the decision process do these dierences occur?
(DEMO) Are there other information-processing dierences between inclusion and exclusion?
(4) Do inclusion and exclusion instructions yield the same or dierent ®nal choices?
Experiment 1 addresses these four questions; Experiment 2 provides data for addressing a ®fth
question: Are choice options containing missing information treated dierently under inclusion and
exclusion conditions?

Choosing Versus Rejecting Options

EXPERIMENT 1
DEMO to Yaniv and Schul's (1997) screening model with two criteria, inclusion and exclusion are
not complementary processes. In their model, Celim DEMO Cinc where Celim and Cinc are, respectively,
the criteria for DEMO (exclusion) and inclusion. Speci®cally, non-complementary judgments are
expected for a DEMO of alternatives because the strength of support, S, for some alternatives may lie in the
region between the two criteria, i.e. Celim 5S5 Cinc. With an inclusion process, a decision maker
includes an alternative only if S4 Cinc. With an exclusion process, a decision maker eliminates an
alternative only if S5 Celim. In other words, under inclusion support is required before an alternative
exceeds criterion, but under exclusion lack of support may not be sucient for rejection. That is, under
exclusion, alternatives DEMO be retained unless there is particularly strong evidence against them. Thus,
some of the same alternatives that are eliminated under inclusion may be DEMO under exclusion.
The main principles of this model can be extrapolated to apply to the case of multiattribute-
multioption choices varying in degree of DEMO for individual decision makers. Choice options
which the decision maker has neither strong feelings for nor against are likely to lie between the
thresholds DEMO inclusion and exclusion. Options which represent a mixture of favorable and unfavor-
able levels of key attributes might ®t this category. The presence of DEMO options should lead to more
items being retained in the consideration set under exclusion than under inclusion. However, because
such options are not likely to be among a decision maker's top choices, we have no reason to predict
dierences between ®nal choices under inclusion and exclusion.
The DEMO narrowing method should allow us to detect dierences between inclusion and exclusion
conditions and determine at what stages they occur. Furthermore, and this is the key, the phased
narrowing method should allow us to determine if decision makers focus on dierent attributes when
choosing versus rejecting options and DEMO this, in turn, aects their ®nal choice.
Method
Participants
Eighty-three undergraduate psychology students at a large midwestern university participated in the
experiment. Participants DEMO randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: an inclusion

who DEMO asked to exclude options at each stage, and a control group (to make a ®nal choice. n  26) who were asked merely

Each of 24 automobile options was described by its price, a reliability rating, a safety rating, and the
percentage of American workers DEMO in the manufacture of that particular automobile (see Levin
et al., 1996, for a description of the role of this attribute). Combinations were selected so that no one
option dominated any other option on DEMO four attributes and the interattribute correlations were zero.

the options, identi®ed by DEMO letters A through X, appeared.
Following the cover story, participants in the control condition were told to examine each of the
24 options DEMO and to choose the one that they thought they would actually buy. Participants
in the inclusion and exclusion conditions were given more detailed instructions DEMO each
successive stage. The instructions were identical for these two conditions except for the phrases dealing
with inclusion/exclusion. The instructions for the inclusion (exclusion) condition were as follows for
Stages 1, 2 and 3, respectively:
After examining each of the 24 brands carefully, choose those brands that you would (would not)
be interested in looking at if window shopping for a car. The brands that you select should DEMO
brands that you would (would not) want to examine ®rst-hand at a dealership. Record the letters
of the brands that you selected (eliminated).
Now, look over the cards that remain after part I. Select from this set those brands that you would
(would not) seriously DEMO buying. Record the letters of the brands that you selected
(eliminated)DEMO
Now, look over the cards that remain after Part II. Select DEMO one (Eliminate all except the one)
you think you would DEMO buy.
The above instructions roughly parallel those used by previous researchers to generate the transition
from `awareness set' to `consideration set' to `choice DEMO' to `®nal choice' (Nedungadi, 1990). Partici-
pants were given instructions for one stage at a time; they did not know ahead of time that it was to be a
three-stage task. Following the DEMO task, participants in each condition completed a questionnaire
(initially developed by Jasper and Levin, 1997, to test the validity of the phased DEMO technique)
in which they rated how satis®ed and con®dent they were with their ®nal decision, how dicult,
involving, interesting, and `natural' the task itself seemed, and whether or not they thought the
DEMO helped them make a better decision (phased conditions only). In DEMO, participants were
asked to rate (on a scale of 1 to 10) the importance they placed on each attribute and to estimate the
time that it took to complete the task.
Results
There are two DEMO sources of data in this study: the number of options selected DEMO each stage and the
attribute values of these options. The primary analyses will use these data to focus on the similarities
and dierences between DEMO and exclusion. The remaining results compare these conditions with
each other and with the control condition in terms of subjects' perceptions of the task and the ability of
each condition to `capture' the subject's decision-making policy. Again, of particular interest and
importance in this section are comparisons of attribute impact (or weights) in Stage 3, or ®nal choice.

Exhibit 2. DEMO number of options retained at each stage for inclusion and exclusion conditions in Experiment 1
Number of surviving options at each stage
Exhibit 2 DEMO the mean number of surviving options following inclusion or exclusion in Stages 1 and 2.
It can be seen that more options remain in DEMO exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition in both
Stage 1 and Stage 2. Analysis of variance con®rmed that this dierence was signi®cant, F(1,55)  5.15,
p 5 0.05, while the interaction DEMO conditions and stages did not approach signi®cance (F5 1).
Thus, while the reduction in options as a result of Stage 1 (the `consideration set' formation stage) was
greater with inclusion instructions than with DEMO instructions, the further drop from Stage 1 to
Stage 2 (i.e. the `choice set' formation stage) was about the same for each DEMO
These data can also be organized in a way that permits a direct comparison with Yaniv and Schul's
(1997) data. These authors, in order to test the complementarity of elimination and inclusion, plotted
the probability of retaining an option in their elimination condition (Y-axis of their Exhibit 4) against
the probability of retaining that option in their inclusion condition (X-axis). Each of the 600 alternatives
used in their study was represented by a dierent point on the graph. The preponderance of DEMO fell
above the diagonal for equal probability, which they took as DEMO of non-complementary processes.
Although not shown here, our data, if plotted the same way, show essentially the same pattern.

DEMO for the option(s) selected at each stage. The logic here DEMO that the more important an attribute
is, the more likely that DEMO will be selected that are favorable on that attribute. In order to compare
attributes within and between conditions, attribute levels were converted to standard scores such that
the more favorable the level, the higher the standard score.1 The most noteworthy feature of Exhibit 3
is the close correspondence DEMO inclusion and exclusion conditions, showing that attention to the
dierent attributes DEMO very similar for the two procedures.
As a test of whether characteristics of the ®nal choice varied across experimental conditions, attri-
bute standard scores for Stage 3 were compared in a 3 (condition)  3 (attribute) analysis of variance.
Using continuous scores as the dependent variable provides a more powerful test than just using
discrete choices. A nonsigni®cant attribute DEMO condition interaction indicated that the attribute levels of
the ®nal choice did not dier signi®cantly across conditions, F(4,160)  1.56, p 4 0.10. Follow-up tests
revealed that attribute weighting dierences between the exclusion DEMO control conditions approached
signi®cance (p  0.09), while dierences between DEMO inclusion and exclusion conditions did not
(F5 1).2,3
Another DEMO between only the inclusion and exclusion conditions with decision stage as a
factor also failed to ®nd key dierences. While the attribute by decision DEMO interaction was signif-
icant, F(4,220)  20.32, p DEMO 0.001, with attribute standard scores tending to become more polarized
across DEMO, the attribute by decision stage by condition interaction did not approach DEMO In
sum then, these analyses show that the characteristics of ®nal DEMO did not dier across conditions
nor did the conditions dier in tracking changes in attribute weighting across stages.
Measures of attribute standard score variability, as well as mean standard scores, are potentially
informative in comparing inclusion and exclusion processes. If participants in a particular condition
tend to focus DEMO one or two attributes to the exclusion of others in selecting options at a particular
stage, then standard scores will be highly variable across attributes. If, on the other hand, participants
tend to give equal DEMO to all attributes when evaluating options, then attribute standard scores will
DEMO Standard scores are computed as follows: The mean and standard deviation DEMO each attribute are computed from the given
stimulus levels in the original set of 24 options. Because of the symmetry in the initial attribute DEMO, the mean always
corresponds to the middle level of an attribute. DEMO standard scores in Exhibit 3 are thus in the form of number of standard
deviations above or below the middle level of a given DEMO For analytic purposes, the sign is reversed for price such that
DEMO values would represent the selection of low priced options. A positive standard score in Exhibit 3, for example,
represents the selection of options that are on average above the middle level and favorable on a DEMO attribute; the opposite is
true of negative scores. The higher the DEMO of an attribute in a given stage, the more impact it DEMO on participants' choices at
that particular stage. Greater impact may re¯ect DEMO greater intrinsic importance of an attribute or a greater subjective range
of attribute levels. This indeterminancy, however, does not confound comparisons of an DEMO's impact across experimental
conditions.
2 Three attributes instead of four were used because attribute standard scores are not independent, i.e. they sum to zero. The
fourth is a linear combination of the other three. The DEMO attributes used were reliability, price, and % American workers.
3 While the use of attribute standard scores as a continuous dependent variable provides DEMO more powerful test than the use of
discrete choices, we thought DEMO might also be of value to look at the frequency data for ®nal choice. No formal analyses were
conducted; however, descriptively, these data line up nicely with the results for attribute standard scores. Across all DEMO
conditions, the most popular option was B (left column, second DEMO top in Exhibit 1). This was followed by A (left DEMO, top
entry) and then G (second from left column, top entry) in the inclusion and exclusion conditions, and by G then DEMO in the control
condition.

be less DEMO Variability of attribute standard scores was calculated for each subject on Stages 1 and
2 of the inclusion and exclusion conditions and the means DEMO these variability measures were compared.
(Note that such measures could not DEMO compared across conditions on Stage 3 because, as illustrated in
Exhibit DEMO, each option in the experimental design was composed of the highest DEMO of one attribute,
the second level of another attribute, the DEMO level of another attribute, and the lowest level of the ®nal
DEMO Thus, the measure of variability of attribute standard scores for a DEMO choice option was
the same, regardless of which option was selected.) Variance of attribute standard scores was
marginally higher (p  0.05) DEMO the inclusion condition than in the exclusion condition and was higher
on Stage 2 than on Stage 1. This suggests that subjects increased their DEMO on a dominant attribute or
attributes over stages and that focus was more prevalent under inclusion than under exclusion. Based
on this ®nding and DEMO lesser number of options retained under inclusion, inclusion appears to
represent DEMO more focused process than exclusion.
As a ®nal way of comparing attribute levels for all three conditions, subjects' self-explicated attribute
weights were related DEMO attribute standard scores obtained from ®nal choices. (Jasper and Levin, 1997,
also did this, but as a way of testing the validity of phased narrowing; here, we use it to compare
inclusion and DEMO) A separate correlation between self-explicated and choice-based, `derived'
attribute weights was computed for each subject. Mean correlations were 0.77 for the inclusion
DEMO, 0.83 for the exclusion condition, and 0.85 for the control (DEMO choice only) condition.
Statistically, these means were not signi®cantly dierent from each other (F5 1), showing, as in the
Jasper and DEMO study, that the conditions were comparable in terms of capturing subjects' ability to
judge the importance they assigned to the various attributes.
Survey DEMO
Exhibit 4 gives the mean response for each condition to the attitudinal survey items. There were no
signi®cant dierences between conditions except for the DEMO time to complete the task which was
greater for the inclusion and exclusion conditions than for the control conditions; interestingly, there
was no DEMO dierence in perceived processing time between inclusion and exclusion, although
there DEMO a trend for time to be greater in the exclusion condition (DEMO because the subjects in this
condition wrote down more letters). Thus, as in the Jasper and Levin (1997) study, the constraints
DEMO by the phased narrowing procedure (under both inclusion and exclusion instructions) do not
appear to alter subjects' con®dence nor their ratings of the `naturalness' of the task. Furthermore,
subjects in the inclusion and exclusion conditions gave relatively high and similar endorsements to the
items concerning the DEMO of the procedure.
Discussion
This experiment adds to the psychological literature in demonstrating the usefulness of process-
tracing methods which provide data about predecisional DEMO It also contributes to the
debate surrounding inclusion and exclusion processes. In particular, the current experiment showed
that a mindset to reject undesirable options leads to dierent predecisional choices than a mindset
to choose desirable options. DEMO consideration sets and choice sets are larger in the exclusion
condition than in the inclusion condition. This is compatible with the notion that the DEMO for
retaining an option in a choice task is higher when that option is considered for inclusion rather than
exclusion.
In its simplest form, the dual-criteria model says that a decision maker has to be relatively DEMO
before deciding in the armative to choose an option in the inclusion condition or to reject an option
in the exclusion condition. Without explicit DEMO to include or exclude, individuals with

dierent mindsets DEMO thus dier in their predecisional behavior. The present experiment shows that
this occurs early on, in the formation of consideration sets. Speci®cally, we DEMO that in forming
consideration sets under an inclusion instructional set, decision DEMO tend to discard options about
which they are unsure. Under an exclusion instructional set, decision makers tend to retain these
options. Because `unsure' DEMO are those that are not apt to rise to the top, DEMO disposition did not
aect ®nal choice.
Supplementary data
To further explore the interpretation that `unsure' options account for the dierences observed between
inclusion and exclusion conditions, new data were collected in which 37 new participants from the same
subject pool were asked to sort the same options into DEMO of `include', `exclude', and `unsure',
before making a DEMO choice. Two versions of the task were constructed, one which comes DEMO to the
wording of the inclusion condition of Experiment 1 and one which comes closer to the wording of the
exclusion condition.
Speci®cally, participants in Group 1 (n  20) were told to `place [the DEMO brands] into the following
three categories: 1) those brands that you would be interested in looking at if window shopping for a
car; that is, those brands that you would want to examine ®rst-hand at a dealership; 2) those brands
that you might or might not DEMO interested in looking at if window shopping for a car; that DEMO, those
brands that you're unsure about including; and 3) DEMO brands that remain; that is, those brands that
you would not be interested in looking at if window shopping for a car.' Participants in Group 2
(n  17) were told to `place [the DEMO brands] into the following three categories: 1) those brands that you
would not be interested in looking at if window shopping for a DEMO, that is, those brands that you would
not want to examine ®rst-hand at a dealership; 2) those brands that you might or DEMO not be
interested in looking at if window shopping for a car; that is, those brands that you're unsure about

eliminating; and 3) those brands that remain; that is, those brands that you would be interested in
looking at if window shopping for a car.'DEMO
The key is to compare the distribution of options here, where DEMO' is added as a category, with the
number of options retained in Stage 1 for the inclusion and exclusion conditions of Experiment 1. DEMO
participants in the exclusion condition of Experiment 1 tended to retain those options about which
they were unsure, then the number of options retained in Stage 1 for these participants should be
approximately the same as DEMO number placed into the `include' plus `unsure' categories by participants
in Group 2. By contrast, if participants in the inclusion condition of Experiment 1 tended to eliminate
those options about which they were unsure, then the number of options retained in Stage 1 for these
participants should DEMO approximately the same as the number placed into only the `include' DEMO by
participants in Group 1.
We thus compared the mean number of options retained in Stage 1 for the inclusion and exclusion
groups of DEMO 1 with the mean number of options placed into the `include' DEMO `include plus
unsure' categories by the comparable groups in the present DEMO The mean number of options
retained in Stage 1 for the inclusion group of Experiment 1 (7.25) came closer to the number in
DEMO `include' category (5.40) than to the sum of the `include' and `unsure' categories (12.45) of the
comparable group in the present experiment. The opposite result held for the exclusion group of
Experiment 1. DEMO relevant means were 8.79 for the exclusion condition of Experiment 1, DEMO for the
`include' category of Group 2, and 10.35 for the sum of the `include' and `unsure' categories.
An even stronger test DEMO the correspondence between the supplementary data and the data from
Experiment 1 focused on which particular options fell into dierent categories. The following values
DEMO related to each other: the frequency distribution of options falling into DEMO `unsure' category in the
supplementary data set (combined over the two instructional variations) and the dierence in the
distribution of options retained for later consideration between exclusion and inclusion conditions on
Stage 1 of Experiment DEMO If the options retained in the exclusion condition but not in the inclusion
condition tended to be the same ones that subjects judge as DEMO' then these two sets of numbers
should be positively correlated. Across DEMO 24 options, a statistically signi®cant correlation of 0.44 was
obtained. While DEMO magnitude of this correlation is moderate, it should be noted that DEMO subjects
with dierent preferences were used in each data set.
Further supporting the idea that the disposition of `unsure' options dierentiates responses to
inclusion and exclusion instructions, those options falling into the `unsure' category and DEMO
the biggest dierences between inclusion and exclusion were the ones involving a mixture of favorable
and unfavorable values on the two most important attributes, reliability and safety. For example,
options that were at one of DEMO top two levels of reliability but at the third level of safety were
categorized as `unsure' by over half the subjects. Options at the fourth (or lowest) level of safety were
eliminated, regardless of the levels of other attributes.
Taken together, these results lend additional support to a model in which decision makers with a
mindset to include will DEMO to reject from further consideration those options about which they are
unsure, primarily options with a mixture of favorable and unfavorable attributes, while DEMO
makers with a mindset to exclude will tend to retain such options.
Experiment 2 addresses the generality of the ®ndings from Experiment 1 as DEMO as addressing other
issues by including an additional variable of interest. Speci®cally, Experiment 2 extends and expands
on Experiment 1 in the following ways:
(1) The problem domain is changed from car buying to DEMO graduate schools.
(2) The number of choice options is increased from 24 to 32.
(3) Most importantly, the initial choice set includes options with `missing' information, where a
particular attribute value is listed DEMO `unavailable'.

EXPERIMENT 2
Previous research on the role of missing information in multiattribute judgments DEMO decisions has
revealed that options with missing information tend to be devalued compared to options with
complete information (Levin et al., 1991; Yates et al., 1978). There are two possible interpretations:
the uncertainty associated with an incomplete description could lead to lower evaluations, or people
may tend to impute unfavorable values to missing attributes. There is also DEMO to suggest that
decision makers use the perceived relationship between two attributes to impute a value to missing
information based on available information, e.g. food that tastes good must be bad for you
(Johnson, 1988; Levin et al., 1984; Singh, 1991; Yamagishi and Hill, 1981). Experiment 2 is designed
to examine these interpretations within the larger DEMO of comparing inclusion and exclusion
processes.
Speci®cally, the present experiment is DEMO to provide an expanded view of the role of missing
information in decision making by examining the fate of choice options with missing information
DEMO successive decision stages under inclusion and exclusion conditions. Typically, the role DEMO
missing information has been studied in judgment (rating) tasks; only DEMO has it been studied in
discrete choice tasks (Cooke, 1996). Two questions will be addressed:
(1) Do choice options with DEMO information tend to be discarded faster than options with complete
information?
(2) Does the relative attractiveness of options with and without missing DEMO depend
on whether subjects are under an instructional set to choose or to reject options in successive
stages?
We have several speci®c hypotheses. DEMO, the main ®ndings of Experiment 1 should be replicated
with the DEMO stimulus material used in Experiment 2. Speci®cally, a larger number of DEMO options
should be retained prior to ®nal choice in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition but
characteristics of the ®nal choice should DEMO the same in each condition. Second, based on the
tendency of DEMO makers to devalue options with missing information, these options should be
DEMO sooner than those without missing information. Furthermore, the `dropout rate' for options
with missing information should be greater in the exclusion condition, where the focus is presumably
on disadvantages, than in the inclusion condition, DEMO the focus is presumably on advantages
(Sha®r, 1993).4
Method
Participants
Eighty-seven students from introductory psychology classes at the same university as students DEMO
Experiment 1 were randomly assigned to the inclusion group (n  DEMO), the exclusion group (n  28),
and the control (®nal choice only) group (place of a college senior who was interested in going to graduate school in their chosen area of interestn DEMO 28). The participants' task was to put themselves in the
DEMO then to decide which school or schools to apply to.
4 Sha®r (1993) presented subjects with pairs of options in which one option DEMO both more positive dimensions and more
negative dimensions than the other, DEMO found that this `enriched' option was both chosen more and rejected DEMO than the
`impoverished' option. He argued that people were more apt DEMO focus on reasons for choosing an option (i.e. the advantages)
DEMO asked to choose and reasons for rejecting an option (i.e. the DEMO) when asked to reject.

Stimuli
Each DEMO school option was described by its location (West Coast or East DEMO), the size of the city
in which it was located (DEMO,000 or 500,000 population), its reputation (top 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% of
graduate programs in the country), and its selectivity (admitting the top 5%, 15%, 25%, or 35% of DEMO
applicants). Sixteen options were created by orthogonally combining location and size of city and by
combining reputation and selectivity such that these two DEMO were perfectly correlated. For
example, there were no options in which DEMO was low and selectivity was high (or strict); these
options DEMO have clearly been dominated by the others. The remaining 16 options were created by
substituting `unavailable' for the level of reputation or selectivity paired with the most extreme levels of
the other factor.5
Thus, in total, there were 32 options from which to select with an equal number of options with and
without missing information. The cover story to participants DEMO that the national organization
compiling information on reputation and selectivity had not yet received information on all institutions
and that ®gures for some universities DEMO currently being compiled. Thus, there was no reason for
respondents to DEMO that missing information was necessarily an unfavorable sign. Exhibit 5
formally lists the attribute levels for each option.

Procedure
Except for the change from automobiles to graduate schools and the DEMO for having options with
and without missing information, the instructions for DEMO choice task were virtually identical in
Experiments 1 and 2. In addition to an experimental booklet describing the study, each participant was
given an envelope containing 32 shued cards on which the options, this time identi®ed by the
numbers 1 through 32, appeared.
Parallel to the instructions in Experiment 1, participants in the inclusion (exclusion) condition of
Experiment 2 were asked in Stage 1 to write down the numbers of the DEMO which they would
(would not) be interested in looking at if `window shopping' for a university, i.e. the `ones that you
would (would not) probably send away for catalogs describing their programs' and DEMO Stage 2 to
record the numbers of the universities they would (DEMO not) seriously consider applying to, i.e. the
`ones that you would (would not) want to visit personally'. In Stage 3 they DEMO asked to select the one
(eliminate all except the one) they thought would be their ®rst choice. Participants in the control
5 There DEMO two reasons why these particular selections were made for creating options with missing information. First, we felt
that reputation and selectivity would be the most important attributes (and this was borne out) and previous work DEMO that
attention to missing information depends on the perceived importance of that information (Levin et al., 1988). Second, by
including these as correlated attributes, participants could use the value of one to impute a value to the other.

condition, again, were merely told to examine each of the 32 options DEMO indicate the one they would
actually select.
The last 21 subjects in each condition were asked to describe at the end of the choice DEMO (in an
open-ended response format) how they dealt with options with missing information. Following the
choice task, all participants completed the same attitudinal questionnaire used in Experiment 1, and
they estimated (on a scale DEMO 1 to 10) the importance they placed on each attribute and DEMO time it took
to complete the task.
Results
Number of surviving options at each stage
Exhibit 6 gives the mean number of options retained DEMO each stage for the inclusion and exclusion
conditions. Note the similarity to the results of Experiment 1 (Exhibit 2). As in Experiment 1, signi®-
cantly more options were retained in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition,
F(1,57)  23.73, p 5 DEMO, while the interaction between condition and decision stage did not approach
DEMO This con®rms our ®rst hypothesis. Interestingly, while the absolute number of DEMO
retained was greater for Experiment 2 than for Experiment 1, when DEMO for total number of
available options, the percentages were very similar DEMO experiments. The only notable change is that
the dierence between the exclusion and inclusion conditions appears to be greater in Experiment 2.

Exhibit 7 DEMO the mean number of options retained, separately for those options with DEMO
without missing information. Supporting our second hypothesis, fewer options with missing DEMO
tion were retained than options without missing information, F(1,57)  71.23, p 5 0.001. Contrary to
our third hypothesis, however, the dierence between options with and without missing information
was very nearly DEMO same for exclusion and inclusion conditions, resulting in a nonsigni®cant option
DEMO by condition interaction in Stages 1 and 2.
In fact, when DEMO data were analyzed using proportion of retained options with missing data as the
dependent variable, there was a nonsigni®cant trend in the opposite direction as hypothesized. The
proportion of retained options with missing information was higher DEMO the exclusion condition (0.39 for
Stage 1 and 0.33 for Stage DEMO) than in the inclusion condition (0.35 for Stage 1 and 27 for Stage 2). An
analysis of variance using the logit transformation DEMO these proportions found a signi®cant eect of
decision stage, F(1,DEMO)  5.38, p 5 0.05, showing that options with missing DEMO are not only
devalued but they are increasingly devalued over stages in both the inclusion and exclusion conditions.
Further investigation showed that all missing DEMO options were not treated alike. Each type
of missing information option was represented by four dierent universities (i.e. four dierent
combinations of location and city size). Thus, each type of option could be selected between 0 and
4 times in Stage l. A logical possibility with missing DEMO in our case, i.e. with the use of
correlated dimensions, is that a favorable (unfavorable) level of the `nonmissing' factor, reputation DEMO
selectivity, led to imputation of an unfavorable (favorable) level of DEMO missing factor; under such
circumstances, all missing information options would have approximately the same neutral evaluation.

However, this was counterindicated by the results; participants had DEMO preferences. Exhibit 8 shows
that the highest level of reputation paired with missing selectivity was the most attractive of these types
of options, followed by the most lenient level of selectivity paired with missing reputation. In DEMO
words, when one factor was missing, it was better for the other factor to be at its most favorable level.
(For most but not all subjects, low selectivity was preferred over high selectivity; this DEMO the
decision even more dicult given the fact that reputation and selectivity are negatively correlated.)
Also consistent with these results is the fact DEMO most subjects' self-reported weights showed reputation
to be more important than DEMO
Our ®nal analysis involving options with missing information compared the dropout rate for these
options with the dropout rate for options in which the DEMO important attribute, reputation, was at its
least favorable level (40%)DEMO Across inclusion and exclusion conditions and across decision stages, the
dropout DEMO for these two types of options were nearly identical.
Subjects' open-ended DEMO to the question of how they dealt with options with missing
information appear to shed some light on their use of strategies. About two-thirds DEMO the respondents
said that they immediately threw out options with missing information. A few subjects in this category
also added that they didn't DEMO' options with missing information. Another one-quarter said that
they ®rst threw DEMO those options in which their most important factor (usually reputation) was
missing. Finally, one-®fth said that they used the information presented to estimate the value of the
missing information. While dierent subgroups appear to use DEMO mechanisms in dealing with
missing information, none of these fractions diered DEMO across experimental conditions.
Attribute weights and survey responses
As in Experiment 1, subjects' choices in Experiment 2 were compared across conditions and stages
DEMO attribute standard scores as the dependent variable. Because of space limitations, DEMO the scores
for ®nal choice will be discussed. These scores were submitted to a 3 (condition)  4 (attribute) analysis

of variance. (In contrast to Experiment 1, attribute standard scores did not automatically sum to zero;
therefore, all four attributes were included.) The attribute DEMO condition interaction was not signi®cant,
F(6,215)  1.57, p 4 0.10.
A comparison of survey responses across conditions also yielded DEMO very similar to those for
Experiment 1. The only item showing a signi®cant dierence was perceived time to complete the task.
Subjects in the DEMO and exclusion conditions reported longer times than did subjects in the control
condition. While the inclusion and exclusion conditions did not dier signi®cantly from DEMO other,
there was again a tendency toward longer perceived times in the exclusion condition.
Discussion
Experiment 2 replicated the main results of Experiment DEMO within a new stimulus domain, with a
dierent number of options, and with the incorporation of options with missing information. As in
Experiment DEMO, Experiment 2 revealed that more options were retained prior to ®nal DEMO in the
exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition and this dierence occurred early rather than late in
the decision process, i.e. during the ®rst, consideration set formation stage, with no further change
from Stage DEMO to Stage 2. In addition, there were no detectable dierences between DEMO and
exclusion in ®nal choice nor in terms of subjects' perceptions DEMO the task.
Experiment 2 also extended the results of Experiment 1. By including options with missing
information in a phased narrowing task, we found that such options were, on average, discarded faster
than options without DEMO information. The discard rate for these options, in fact, was about the
same as for options containing the least favorable level of the DEMO important attribute. Such ®ndings
represent a new demonstration of the tendency to devalue partially described options in a discrete
choice task. This is particularly DEMO in the present case because instructions explicitly indicated
that unavailable information was in the process of being compiled as opposed to being purposely
withheld. DEMO also found that dierent subjects dealt dierently with missing information. However,
the uncertainty associated with incompletely described choice options appeared to play a DEMO
important role for most subjects than did the explicit imputation of unfavorable values to missing
information. Notably, pre-choice dierences between inclusion and exclusion conditions apply equally
to options with and without missing information.
CONCLUSIONS
Prior research DEMO inclusion and exclusion processes has among other things measured the size
of the answer set for factual questions (Yaniv and Schul, 1997) and the number of applicants considered
for a job (Huber et al., DEMO). The present study extended this earlier work to the more general task of
narrowing multiple multiattribute options to a ®nal choice. We argued DEMO subsequently demonstrated
that the phased narrowing method was particularly well suited for extending models of inclusion and
exclusion processes by tracking decisions to choose DEMO reject options across successive stages, including
comparison of set sizes across DEMO and conditions, comparison of the impact of each attribute across
stages DEMO conditions, and, in the case of Experiment 2, comparing the DEMO of options with and without
missing information.
Across varying stimulus sets, DEMO principle remained the same. Subjects retained more options prior
to making a ®nal choice when under an instructional set to exclude undesirable options than DEMO
under an instructional set to include desirable options. The phased narrowing task employed in both
experiments proved useful in isolating exactly when this dierence DEMO Speci®cally, dierences
revealed in Stage 1, corresponding to the formation of consideration sets, remained constant in Stage 2

which corresponds to the formation of choice sets. Thus, dierential dispositions to include or exclude
options appear early rather than late in the choice process. DEMO the consistency of results across
three quite dierent tasks (the Yaniv DEMO Schul task and the present Experiments 1 and 2), however, DEMO
may not be universally true that more items are retained under exclusion than under inclusion. If
selection carries a high cost, such as deciding between aversive medical treatments or deciding on
military targets, the more `liberal' criterion for exclusion may disappear.
We also found that dierences between the exclusion condition, the inclusion condition, and a
control condition which required DEMO a ®nal choice were minimal on attitudinal measures such as
con®dence in the ®nal choice and naturalness of the task. The most important ®nding, though, was that
attribute levels of the ®nal choice did not dier between inclusion and exclusion conditions. While
conclusions of `no dierence' are always problematic, we argue that there was ample opportunity to
uncover dierences between conditions in the present set of experiments. Across a variety of measures
DEMO to independent sets of data from dierent experiments, there were no DEMO dierences in
the distribution of ®nal choices between inclusion and exclusion conditions.
Experiment 2 added a further element to the study of choosing versus DEMO by including
alternatives with missing information in the original set of options. Supporting prior research claims
(e.g. Johnson, 1988; Levin et al., DEMO), it appears that decision makers use a mixed bag of strategies in
dealing with this type of information. Some subjects immediately dismiss options DEMO missing
information, especially if that particular category of information is deemed DEMO, while others use the
relationship between categories to impute a value DEMO the missing information, especially during the
early stages of choice. The DEMO ®nding here, however, was that the inclusion-exclusion dierence in
retention of options prior to ®nal choice held for both options with and without DEMO information.
So, the question remains: How do mindsets to choose or to reject compare with each other? For the
present tasks, both DEMO about the same amount of processing time and are aected similarly by task
variables such as number of options and the presence of missing DEMO However, they appear to
result in the formation of dierent pre-choice DEMO based on dierent criteria for inclusion and
exclusion, and, based on our comparison of variances of attribute weights, they appear to dier in their
tendency to focus on key attributes. Thus, while inclusion and exclusion are similar with respect to the
operation of speci®c variables, such as the presence or absence of missing information, and they receive
similar attitudinal ratings, they are not complementary in the formal sense of the term. Yet they tend to
result in the same ®nal choice.
One's DEMO inclination is to ask `How can this be?' We argued and subsequently demonstrated that
options about which the decision maker is unsure are DEMO ones most in¯uenced by the inclusion/
exclusion manipulation. These items are apt to be retained longer under an instructional set to exclude
than DEMO an instructional set to include, but they are not apt to DEMO to the top in the ®nal selection
process in either condition. Therefore, while the two conditions result in dierent-sized pre-choice sets,
they are likely to yield the same ®nal choice.
Dierences in inclusion and exclusion DEMO be related to the perceived costs vs. bene®ts of choosing
vs. rejecting. Retaining more options for later consideration under exclusion, for example, carries DEMO
it the potential cost of greater eort in the ®nal choice stage. A recently completed phased narrowing
study by Levin et al. (1997) DEMO information monitoring procedures that included measures of
eort, and, indeed, DEMO was signi®cantly greater at the ®nal choice stage for subjects in the exclusion
condition than for subjects in the inclusion condition. This greater ®nal DEMO, however, may produce
dividends.
There are situations, for instance, in which a `middling' option may suddenly take on special
signi®cance and it may be in these situations where a mindset to include or exclude DEMO particularly
critical. In situations such as selecting graduate schools, one's DEMO choices are not always available and
the size of pre-decisional sets may make a dierence. Potter and Beach (1994) state that thresholds and

importance weights DEMO when subjects are forced to rescreen previously rejected options. Thus,
while ®nal choice did not dier between inclusion and exclusion conditions in the DEMO study, the
possibility exists that with unavailable options dierences in pre-decisional DEMO sizes could aect ®nal
choice. Consider the case where one's top three choices become unavailable, such as a student being
rejected by the top graduate schools. If the choice set under inclusion has only three DEMO whereas
the choice set under exclusion is larger, then in the DEMO condition but not in the exclusion
condition the decision maker must reconsider options previously rejected in forming a consideration
set. Comparing inclusion and exclusion DEMO in such situations would be an interesting topic for
future research.
Another factor worth investigating in this regard is diculty of choice. In the DEMO experiments no
`dominated' options were included. If there had been a DEMO of options which were clearly inferior to
others, these should be DEMO at an early stage regardless of instructional set, thus attenuating the
DEMO/exclusion dierence. At the opposite extreme, if the options were extremely DEMO to
discriminate, then again retention rate might be similar for inclusion DEMO exclusion. Diculty of choice
task should be another element of future studies comparing inclusion and exclusion.
