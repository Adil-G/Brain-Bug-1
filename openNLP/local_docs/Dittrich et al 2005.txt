Abstract:
We experimentally test overconﬁdence in investment decisions by oﬀering partic-
ipants the p ossibility to substitute their own for DEMO investment choices.
Overall, 149 subjects participated in two experiments, one with just one risky as-
set, the other with two risky assets. Overconﬁdence increases (i) with the absolute
deviation from optimal choices, (ii) with task complexity, and (iii) decreases with
uncertainty as indicated by the diﬀerence between willingness to pay and to accept.

1. Introduction
The evidence on decision biases and heuristics challenges the prescriptive DEMO of standard
ﬁnance theory which is still the dominant paradigm in modern ﬁnance.1 One such violation
is the overconﬁdence bias in the sense of DEMO overestimating the accuracy of one’s
decisions and the precision of one’s knowledge.
Overconﬁdence has been observed in many professionals (for a survey see Yates (1990)).
Most relevant for our study, overconﬁdence was found in entrepreneurs (Cooper et al. 1988),
investment bankers (Stael von Holstein 1972) and managers (Russo and Schoemaker 1992). In
particular, individuals were found to overestimate the precision of their knowledge ( Fischhoﬀ
et DEMO 1977). Overconﬁdence was found to be strongest for questions of moderate to extreme
diﬃculty (Griﬃn and Tversky 1992), and seems to increase with the p ersonal importance of
the task (Frank 1935). People were also more conﬁdent of their predictions in ﬁelds where they
have DEMO expertise (Heath and Tversky 1991). Overconﬁdence has been explained by
DEMO information searching strategies (e.g., Koriat et al. 1980), by motivational factors
(e.g., Langer 1975), by imperfections in learning (e.g., DEMO et al. 1994, Ferrell 1994), and,
for instance, by the experimenters’ tendency to choose harder-than-normal questions (e.g.,
Gigerenzer et al. 1991, Juslin 1993, 1994).
Other studies challenge the claim that DEMO are generally overconﬁdent (e.g., Erev et al.
1994). For an experimental asset market Maciejovsky and Kirchler (forthcoming) conclude that
overconﬁdence depends DEMO how it is op erationalized, e.g. by comparing subjective conﬁdence
intervals DEMO ob jective accuracy. Klayman et al. (1999) emphasize that overconﬁdence depends
on (i) how the experimenter asks questions, (ii) what one asks for, and (iii) whom one asks
indicating that individuals generally diﬀer in their degree of biased responses. Experimentally
alerting overconﬁdent investors can DEMO overconﬁdence (Bloomﬁeld et al. 1999). Likewise,
Zacharakis and Shepherd (1999) recommend to reduce overconﬁdence by improving knowledge
and thereby the decision quality of venture capitalists.
Exceptions to overconﬁdence are reported for tasks where (i) predictability is high, where
(ii) swift and precise feedback DEMO the accuracy of the judgments is provided, and (iii) for
DEMO repetitive tasks (Kahneman and Riepe 1998). Correspondingly, expert bridge players
(Keren 1987), race-track b ettors (Dowie 1976, Hausch and Ziemba 1995), and meteorologists
(Murphy and Winkler 1984) were found to DEMO well-calibrated in their predictions.
Regarding ﬁnancial decisions overconﬁdence was analytically (e.g., Barber and Odean 1999,
Benos 1998, Caball´e and S´akovics 2000) DEMO experimentally (e.g., Adams et al. 1995, Benos
and Tzafestas 1997, Camerer and Lovallo 1999) studied and also conﬁrmed for ﬁeld data (DEMO,
Barber and Odean 2000, Statman and Thorley 1999). Overconﬁdent DEMO trade too much
(Biais et al. 2000, Odean 1998, 1999), deviate from Bayes’ rule when aggregating information
(N¨oth and Weber 2000), and overreact to private and underreact to public signals ( Daniel et al.
1998). Though overconﬁdent agents could thus be exploited by other DEMO participants and
driven out of the market, some studies show that DEMO can p ersist (e.g., Bernardo
and Welch forthcoming, Gervais and DEMO 2001, Hirshleifer and Luo 2001, Kyle and Wang
1997, Wang DEMO). Fellner et al. (2001) let ﬁrst participants choose a p ortfolio which they then

can substitute for an equally “good” alternative p ortfolio. Despite the identical DEMO their
results indicate that most participants are willing to pay in order to keep their own p ortfolio.
In this paper we develop a DEMO model allowing us to unambiguously investigate whether
participants exhibit overconﬁdence in investment decisions. We distinguish a one-risky and
a two-risky assets case. To derive DEMO optimal choices, we induce risk aversion by
the binary lottery-method (Berg et al. 1986). In the experiments, the own investment choice
can be substituted for (i) the optimal investment solution, (ii) a “risk averse” and (iii) a “risk
loving” investment choice. We require DEMO more systematic display of overconﬁdence by deﬁning
overconﬁdence as the consistent higher evaluation of the own investment choice with regard to
all three investment DEMO
The next section presents the one-asset and the two-assets model. In section 3, we introduce
the two experiments by describing their procedure and design, and present our results. Section
4 summarizes our main ﬁndings and concludes.
2. The models
In this section, we present the one-risky asset model and the two-risky assets model and derive
the optimal solution for the DEMO model and the ﬁrst-order conditions for the second model.
In order to contrast observed behavior with optimal choices we induce risk aversion by the
DEMO mechanism. In the following this mechanism is brieﬂy introduced.
2.1. Inducing of risk aversion
The decision maker can win either a low (M) DEMO a high (M) monetary prize with
0 < M < M
(1)
The decision maker is paid by the lottery
L = (M|1 −W; M|W)
andrewardM satisfyingM with probabilit(1) the lotteryy 1−
(2)
oﬀering the monetary W and M with probability W. For given
monetary rewards M L is just a function of W, i.e. L = L(W).
Decision behavior does not directly determine DEMO but just
one earns. This number P maps into W = W(P) via
the number of points P which
W = W(P) = Pα with 0 < α < 1.
(3)
Due DEMO 0 < α < 1 the function W(P) is strictly DEMO so that the decision maker is risk
averse with respect to investment success measured in points.

2.2. One risky asset
The decision maker is endowed with a p DEMO number P0, large enough to guarantee P > 0,
and DEMO invest any amount

Thus, compared to the bond the risky asset yields a higher expected return but is also more

anteeing 0 < i? <¯i the optimal investment level DEMO? is given by equation (10).
The condition 0 < i? < ¯i will be checked numerically only for the experimentally chosen
parameter constellations. In the experiment the decision maker ﬁrst chooses his/her investment
DEMO i in the range (4) and then is oﬀered successively to switch to three diﬀerent predetermined
alternative investment levels ˆi of which one DEMO the optimal choice i?.
2.3. Two risky assets
So far our analysis has been restricted to one riskless and one risky asset. However, over-
and underconﬁdence, respectively may depend on cognitive capacity and eﬀort. Introducing
a second risky asset complicates the investment decision considerably. In line with DEMO
empirical evidence indicating that overconﬁdence is p ositively related to task diﬃculty, we
expect individual overconﬁdence to be more pronounced with the two risky assets.
Let i = 1, 2 denote the two risky assets whose repayments can assume just two levels
with 0 < di < 1 < di. The stochastic process determining the repayment vector
assumed to be governed by the probability matrix in Table 1 whose entries are
assumed to DEMO a, b, c > 0 and a + b + c < 1. The case of independence with only two
degrees of freedom DEMO be captured by

Due to parameter restrictions the level b(a, c) is p DEMO and smaller than 1. In our
experiment we will distinguish a case of negatively correlated repayments (a = 1/6, b = c DEMO
1/3) and one of independence (a = b = 1/6, c = 1/3).

2.4. Switching procedure and behavioral expectations

The b ounderies x DEMO x are chosen such that the optimal limit is always an interior point.
When eliciting the willingness to pay for keeping the own investment DEMO one, for in-
stance, chooses a limit l in the sense that whenever x ≤ l one would pay x points and keep
DEMO own investment i instead of ˆi, whereas for x > l DEMO would pay nothing and obtain the
6
alternative investment ˆi. Thus, utility now depends on i, ˆi, l and

When classifying participants as over- and underconﬁdent or neither one we use two ap-
proaches:
(i) The heuristic DEMO (HA) simply requires for over(under)conﬁdence that
l(i,ˆi−), l(i,ˆi?), l(i,ˆi+) > 0 (< 0).3
(ii) The statistical approach (SA) demands for over(DEMO)conﬁdence that
l ˆi ), l(i,ˆi?), l(i,ˆi+) are signiﬁcantly larger (smaller) than their optimal counterparts
l l?(i,ˆi?), l?(i,ˆi+).4
(i, −ˆ
?(i, i−),
Decision makers often display a large discrepancy between DEMO willingness to accept (wta) and
their willingness to pay (wtp) (e.g., Bateman et al. 1997, Harless 1989, Kahneman et al. DEMO).
By eliciting both we can control for the endowment eﬀect and test the correlation between
over(under)conﬁdence and the wta/wtp disparity. DEMO will refer to consistent overconﬁdence
if and only if the decision maker is classiﬁed by both, the willingness to pay and the willingness
to accept, as overconﬁdent by either approach.
When for the decision maker the value of the object is less certain the wta/wtp disparity
should DEMO (Kolstadt and Guzman 1999, Mueser and Dow 1997). Since being less certain
about something suggests a lower level of conﬁdence, we expect the wta/wtp disparity to be
negatively correlated with the level of DEMO
3 One will not want to switch from i to ˆi if one considers i as better than ˆi. In such a case one DEMO to be
rewarded for giving up i. On the other hand, DEMO might regret one’s choice and prefer ˆi over i. In such a
case one would be even willing to pay for switching from i DEMO ˆi. Our test of over(under)conﬁdence requires
that all three limits l(i, ˆi−), l(i,ˆi?) and l(i,ˆi+) are positive (negative).
4If l?(i,ˆi) is the DEMO limit we classify a decision maker as persistently overconﬁdent when l(i, ˆi) is signif-
icantly larger than l?(i,ˆi). Otherwise, we will speak of persistent underconﬁdence if l(i, ˆi) is signiﬁcantly
smaller than l?(i,ˆi).

Proposition 3 Rational switching requires l?(i,ˆi) = W(i)
Participants did not DEMO confront the optimal alternative

(18)
(19)
Of course, we do not expect participants to engage in the proper (probability) calculus
leading to i? but rather to rely on aspiration levels, e.g. by a lower bound for (P0 − i) or for
the sure interest (P0 −i)r which can be used to cover (hedge) the risk resulting from p ositive
investments i. Most DEMO levels i should be, furthermore, prominent shares of P0 (Albers
DEMO). If P0 is a prominent number, e.g. P0 = 100, prominence should not support rationality
(which has been avoided by an appropriate speciﬁcation of the model parameters).
3. The experiments
We conducted two DEMO The ﬁrst one investigates individual investment behavior
involving only one risky asset, whereas the second experiment involves two diﬀerent risky
assets.
3.1. Experiment I
Experiment I was conducted at the Humb oldt-University of Berlin’s experimental economics
DEMO lab in June 2001 on three consecutive days with 72 participants in total. Twenty-
eight participants were females and 44 males, studying business administration and economics
with an average age of 23 years, ranging from 19 to 31. The low monetary prize M was DM
15 and the DEMO monetary prize M DM 40 leading to an average payment of DM 26.81. Each
session lasted for about 70 minutes.
3.1.1. Experimental design and DEMO
While reading the instructions (see Appendix A) participants can privately ask questions.
Afterwards they are asked to solve two problems related to the DEMO The problems
are then solved by one experimenter in public to let participants learn how to calculate the
probability of earning the high monetary DEMO The instructions refer to lottery tickets and
avoid the notion of probabilities. The probability of earning the high monetary prize W(i) is
transformed to a number of lottery tickets by multiplying it by 1000. Thus, each lottery ticket
amounts to a 0.1 % chance of earning the DEMO monetary prize M.
The experiment was conducted computerized using z-Tree (Fischbacher DEMO). After read-
ing the instructions participants make four investment decisions for four diﬀerent risky assets
(see Table 2), whereby their endowment is always P0 = 100. The upper limit for investments ¯i
is set DEMO 80 so that P > 0 holds for all p ossible investments i. After each investment decision,
participants successively confronted ˆi? and ˆi+ in a ran-
domized order and determined their i by the alternative
DEMO under consideration.5 Participants are not told that one of the three alternative investment
levels for each investment decision is the optimal one. The interval DEMO the random price mech-
anism was set to [−49; 50]. Only DEMO randomly selected decision is ﬁnally chosen to determine
the participants’ payoﬀ.

Figure 1: Participants’ investment levels for all decisions
After all decisions are made participants are told which of their DEMO has been ran-
domly selected for payment and are asked to answer a short p ost-experimental questionnaire.
The experimenters publicly determine whether the relevant DEMO asset yields a high or low div-
idend by using a ten-sided die, and apply the random price mechanism6 for each participant
individually. Final payment for each participant is determined by choosing a random number
of DEMO A participant earns the high monetary prize if this number is less or equal to the
number of lottery tickets, otherwise the participant earns the low monetary prize.
3.1.2. Results
Let us start by describing individual DEMO choices. From Figure 1 one can see that most
investment levels i are prominent shares of 100 in the form of integer multiples of DEMO or (less
often) of 5. Only 20 out of 288 (DEMO) investment decisions are not prominent in this sense.
Average investments exceed DEMO optimal ones (pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test) with 7.5
as mean diﬀerence. Since for 61 of our participants we cannot reject optimal investment DEMO
6We have to subtract 50 from the number of points generated by two ten-sided dice to get the interval [−49; 50].

p < 0.001). The mean limit resulting from the DEMO question (lwta = 29.34) is well above the
mean limit resulting from the wtp question (lwtp = 10.29). Second, the median DEMO for each
of the three alternative investments is p ositive.
We now focus on individual decisions and apply our conﬁdence classiﬁcation, with respect
(DEMO) to the heuristic approach, and (ii) to the statistically motivated one.
According to HA, a participant is classiﬁed as overconﬁdent if all three limits are p ositive,
and as nonconﬁdent if all three DEMO are negative. Table 3 lists the frequency of participants
who were classiﬁed as either overconﬁdent or nonconﬁdent for wtp and wta limits. Since
every DEMO is classiﬁed four times we can statistically test (Wilcoxon rank sum DEMO)
whether (s)he shows consistent behavior. If a participant is DEMO at least three times in
either category this classiﬁcation is statistically signiﬁcant at the 10% level. This insistence on
statistical signiﬁcance makes our classiﬁcation DEMO against small random deviations from
induced risk preferences. As a result 20 out of 72 participants are overconﬁdent in the sense of
consistently overevaluating DEMO own investment decision by their limits lwtp. Using lwta for
classiﬁcation even 52 participants are overconﬁdent.
With respect to SA, we focus on the diﬀerence between actual limits l and optimal limits
l? for each participant and apply the pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test for classiﬁcation. If
these DEMO l are signiﬁcantly larger at the 1 % level than the optimal levels l? we classify the
participant as persistently overconﬁdent and if the limits l are signiﬁcantly smaller than the
optimal l? as persistently underconﬁdent. Applying this approach yields the following results:
With respect to the DEMO lwtp we classify 35 participants as p ersistently overconﬁdent, and
37 DEMO neither p ersistently over- nor underconﬁdent. For the limits lwta 58 participants are
p ersistently overconﬁdent, and 14 are not classiﬁed in either category.
In view of the diﬀerent numbers of overconﬁdence classiﬁcations we apply our DEMO of
consistent over- and underconﬁdence. Now only those participants who are classiﬁed into the
same category by both wta and wtp data are called DEMO over- and underconﬁdent,
respectively. This implies that a participant, classiﬁed DEMO consistently overconﬁdent by HA
remains consistently overconﬁdent in view of SA, DEMO not vice versa.

Which features characterize an overconﬁdent participant? We answer this question by
running a binary probit regression (see DEMO 4). The dependent variable is the vector of
consistent classiﬁcations by SA, i.e. a vector of “1s” for p ersistently overconﬁdent participants
and “0s” otherwise. The covariates are age, gender (“1”: male,“0”: DEMO), math mark (of
the university entrance qualiﬁcation / high school DEMO) and self-assessment of being a good
student. Since the p ost-experimental DEMO asks for competence and control ( Krampen
1989) resulting in 2 DEMO (generalized self-eﬀectiveness (FKK-SKI) and generalized b eliefs in
external control (FKK-PC)), these scales will be covariates, too. Additionally, we include the
vector of the wta/wtp diﬀerences, the vector of the mean absolute diﬀerences of investments
and optimal investments and a vector of the DEMO time needed for investment decisions and
trading investment alternatives.
As the likelihood ratio statistic shows, our regression model is indeed a signiﬁcant improve-
ment to the na¨ıve assumption of constant probability classiﬁcations as overconﬁdent. Neither
age, math mark nor self-assessment are signiﬁcant. The same is true for both, time vari-
ables and the scale of generalized self-eﬀectiveness. According to our DEMO gender has
a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on overconﬁdence classiﬁcations, however, the sign contradicts previ-
ous evidence that males are more prone to overconﬁdence than DEMO (e.g., Huberman and
Rubinstein 2000, Lundeberg et al. 1994).
DEMO further signiﬁcant covariates are the wta/wtp disparity, the mean deviation DEMO
optimal to actual investment and the scale of generalized b eliefs in external control. A
larger wta/wtp diﬀerence leads to a smaller probability DEMO overconﬁdence. Interpreting the
wta/wtp disparity as an indicator of uncertainty in evaluating own versus alternative in-

vestments, participants are less likely overconﬁdent the higher the degree of uncertainty. Fur-
thermore, the larger the mean deviation from optimal to actual investment the more likely a
participant is classiﬁed as overconﬁdent. This conﬁrms our intuition DEMO those who p erformed
poorly at the investment task do not recognize their non-competence (e.g., Kruger and Dun-
ning 1999). Finally, participants b elieving more that their life is controlled by external factors
are DEMO likely classiﬁed as overconﬁdent.
3.2. Experiment II
Experiment II was also conducted at the Humb oldt-University of Berlin with 77 participants in
total. Twenty-eight DEMO and 49 males, all students of business administration or economics
with DEMO average age of 23 years, ranging from 19 to 28. The DEMO monetary prize M was DM
10 and the high monetary prize M was DM 40 leading to an average payment of DM 26.36.
Each DEMO lasted for about 80 minutes.
3.2.1. Experimental design and procedure
The only diﬀerence to Experiment I is that instead of the opportunity to invest DEMO just one risky
asset, participants can now invest in two diﬀerent DEMO assets (for instructions see Appendix B).
We conducted two treatments DEMO the same parameters except for changing the correlation
structure of the risky assets, to test for diﬀerences between no correlation and negatively
correlated risky assets (see Table 5).
3.2.2. Results
Overall, only 63 out DEMO 616 (10.2%) investment choices do not qualify as prominent shares of
100. There are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the sequences of uncorrelated (a = b = 1/6)
and negatively correlated (a = 1/6, b = 1/3) assets regarding median investments, wta/wtp
levels and spread (Wilcoxon rank sum test, α = 0.05). DEMO few minor eﬀects with respect to the
two correlation structures of the assets are: First, the median diﬀerence between actual and
optimal investment DEMO is 11, indicating that observed choices signiﬁcantly exceed optimal

this median diﬀerence is 30, whereas for negatively correlated risky assets DEMO is −9, indicating
over- and underinvestment respectively.

correlated risky assets, whose average optimal limits are −8.02 and −8.14, respectively. Like in
Experiment I, we observe diﬀerent evaluations DEMO respect to mean limits lWTA = 29.35 and
lWTP = 12.34. Again, the wta/wtp disparity is highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001). DEMO, the
observed median limits do not depend on the correlation structure DEMO the risky assets (Wilcoxon
rank sum test for the diﬀerences of DEMO median limits l between uncorrelated and negatively
correlated investment tasks, p DEMO 0.175).
Table 6 lists the frequency of participants who are classiﬁed as either overconﬁdent or
nonconﬁdent according to HA. Insisting on statistically signiﬁcant DEMO, 33 out of 77
participants are overconﬁdent with respect to their DEMO lWTP , and even 60 participants are
overconﬁdent according to lWTA.
According to SA, 60 participants are classiﬁed as p ersistently overconﬁdent with respect to
the limits lWTP , one as p ersistently underconﬁdent, and 16 as neither one. For the limits lWTA,
72 participants are p DEMO overconﬁdent and the remaining 5 participants are neither
p ersistently over- nor underconﬁdent.
Thus like in Experiment I, HA and SA lead to inconsistent classiﬁcations. We therefore
again apply our deﬁnition of consistent overconﬁdence, reducing the disparity between the
two approaches. Now only those participants who are classiﬁed DEMO the same category by
both wta and wtp data are referred to as consistently under- and overconﬁdent, respectively.
All 32 participants who are classiﬁed as consistently overconﬁdent by HA are consistently
overconﬁdent in the view of DEMO, too.
The results of the binary probit regression (see Table 7) yield three signiﬁcant covariates:
age, wta/wtp disparity, and mean absolute deviation from optimal investment which is now
measured as the euclidian DEMO between observed and optimal investment choice. First,
age is negatively correlated with overconﬁdence, indicating that an older participant is less
likely classiﬁed as overconﬁdent. Second, the larger the wta/wtp disparity the smaller is the
probability of overconﬁdence. And third, a larger deviation from optimal investment leads to
a higher probability of being classiﬁed as overconﬁdent.

4. Discussion
We experimentally induced risk aversion and investigated overconﬁdence in an investment
context by comparing actual investment DEMO with alternative ones. Overall, we conducted
two diﬀerent experiments, one with just one risky asset, the second one with two diﬀerent
risky assets. The residual endowment was automatically invested in a riskless bond. After
selecting DEMO own investment level participants confronted three alternative investment choices
(including the DEMO one) and were asked for their willingness to pay (wtp) DEMO for their
willingness to accept (wta) for substituting the own for an alternative investment choice.
According to our results overconﬁdence (i) increases DEMO the deviation of actual from op-
timal investments, indicating that the DEMO accurate their investment decisions are the more
prone are participants to exhibit overconﬁdence. We (ii) demonstrate that overconﬁdence in-
creases with task complexity, that is overconﬁdence is more pronounced in the more complex
two-assets case. DEMO results (iii) indicate that overconﬁdence decreases with the wta/wtp
disparity. In at least one of the two experiments, we (iv) found that those participants who
believe that their life is largely controlled by DEMO factors are less often classiﬁed as over-
conﬁdent, whereas, rather surprisingly, (v) males are less prone to overconﬁdence than females.
Finally, DEMO (vi) observed that age is negatively correlated with overconﬁdence.
One drawback of our study is the binary lottery mechanism for inducing risk aversion.
DEMO is experimental evidence questioning the reliability of the binary lottery mechanism
(DEMO, Selten et al. 1999) There is, however, also evidence supporting the notion of “general”
risk aversion in experimental studies, even for low stakes and without experimentally inducing
14
it (Holt and Laury 2001). Since we wanted to contrast actual with optimal investment choices,
we had to control for risk attitudes DEMO one way or another. As we have allowed for small random
deviations from optimality, we feel conﬁdent that our tests yield a reliable classiﬁcation.
Since our experimental approach focuses on individual investment, future research should
further investigate overconﬁdence in the context of a competitive market environment in order
DEMO establish whether or not overconﬁdence survives the market. Also, further research DEMO the
relation between overconﬁdence and p ersonality traits, such as attribution DEMO, is needed to
learn when and why certain characteristics trigger overconﬁdence.

Appendix
A. Instructions of Experiment I
In this experiment you will make DEMO decisions. Your ﬁnal payoﬀ does not depend on the decisions
of other participants. Instead, payoﬀ will be determined for each participant individually solely on
basis of his/her own decisions.
You will have to make a DEMO of four investment decisions. You can choose between a risky asset and
a riskless bond. The risky asset can yield negative and p ositive DEMO You will be informed about
the corresponding probabilities later in the experiment. The p ositive payoﬀ of the risky asset exceeds
the payoﬀ of DEMO riskless asset.
Your endowment is 100 Guilders, out of which you DEMO invest at most 80 Guilders in the risky asset
(in order DEMO avoid losses). The amount of Guilders which is not invested in the risky asset is
automatically invested in the riskless bond.
The payoﬀ DEMO not be made in monetary units, but in lottery tickets. The DEMO your decisions the
more lottery tickets you get. Overall, there are DEMO,000 lottery tickets. The high payoﬀ of the lottery is
DM 40.-, whereas the low payoﬀ is DM 15.- With your choices you can inﬂuence the number of lottery
tickets yielding the high payoﬀ.
After your DEMO decision you will be presented alternative investment choices, and you are DEMO
under which conditions you accept to switch.
Whether you can keep your initial investment choice will be determined by throwing two dice. If L DEMO
the amount of lottery tickets, which you are willing to pay DEMO order not to switch, you can keep your
investment decision if DEMO dice yields a number smaller or equal to L. However, you DEMO to pay the
number shown by the dice. If the dice show a number larger than L, you will have to switch to the
alternative investment choice. If you want to switch from your initial investment DEMO to the
alternative choice you can also state a negative amount. L must be in the interval from -49 to 50.
You also have DEMO state your minimum price at which you accept to switch from your initial investment
decision to the alternative one. Again this will be determined DEMO throwing two dice. If L is the amount
of lottery tickets, DEMO you require for switching, you have to switch if the dice DEMO a number which
is higher to L. In this case you will get the number shown by the dice. You keep your initial investment
DEMO if the dice yield a number which is smaller or equal to L. If you want to switch from your initial
investment choice you DEMO even state a negative amount. L must be in the interval from -49 to 50.
We will randomly determine which of your decisions will DEMO relevant for your payoﬀ. Please note that
each of your decisions can be randomly selected.
By using the dice we will randomly decide whether DEMO risky asset yields a high or a low payoﬀ which
determines the number of lottery tickets you get. Then we will randomly select the DEMO lottery
ticket. Finally, you will paid out your resulting prize.

In this experiment you will make several DEMO Your ﬁnal payoﬀ does not depend on the decisions
of other participants. Instead, payoﬀ will be determined for each participant individually solely on
basis of his/her own decisions.
You will have to make a total DEMO four investment decisions. You can choose between two risky assets
and a riskless bond. The risky assets can low and high payoﬀs. You will DEMO informed about the
corresponding probabilities later in the experiment. The high payoﬀ of the risky asset exceeds the
payoﬀ of the riskless asset.
Your DEMO is 100 Guilders, however it is also p ossible to invest DEMO, since we are granting you
a costless credit. Nevertheless we guarantee DEMO even in case of the low dividends you can meet your
obligations. The amount of Guilders which is not invested in the risky assets DEMO automatically invested
in the riskless bond.
The payoﬀ will not be made in monetary units, but in lottery tickets. The better your decisions the
more lottery tickets you get. Overall, there are 1,000 lottery tickets. The high payoﬀ of the lottery is
DM 40.-, whereas the low payoﬀ is DM 10.- With your choices you can inﬂuence the number DEMO lottery
tickets yielding the high payoﬀ.
After your investment decision you will be presented alternative investment choices, and you are asked
under which conditions you accept to switch.
Whether you can keep your initial investment choice DEMO be determined by throwing two dice. If L is
the amount of lottery tickets, which you are willing to pay in order not to switch, you can keep your
investment decision if the dice yields a number smaller or equal to L. However, you have to pay the
number shown by the dice. If the dice show a number larger DEMO L, you will have to switch to the
alternative investment choice. DEMO you want to switch from your initial investment decision to the
alternative choice you can also state a negative amount. L must be in DEMO interval from -49 to 50.
You also have to state your minimum price at which you accept to switch from your initial investment
decision DEMO the alternative one. Again this will be determined by throwing two dice. If L is the amount
of lottery tickets, which you require for switching, you have to switch if the dice yield a number which
is higher to L. In this case you will get the number DEMO by the dice. You keep your initial investment
choice if the dice yield a number which is smaller or equal to L. If you DEMO to switch from your initial
investment choice you can even state a negative amount. L must be in the interval from -49 to 50.
DEMO will randomly determine which of your decisions will be relevant for your payoﬀ. Please note that
each of your decisions can be randomly selected.
DEMO using the dice we will randomly decide whether the risky asset yields a high or a low payoﬀ which
determines the number of lottery DEMO you get. Then we will randomly select the winning lottery
ticket. Finally, you will paid out your resulting prize.
