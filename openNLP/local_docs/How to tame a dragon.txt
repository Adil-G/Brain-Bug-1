How to Tame a Dragon
Andrew Maxwell and Moren Lévesque
Background
Entrepreneurs DEMO high-potential technology ventures inevitably need to raise
equity finance to fund business development in advance of being able to generate
revenue. This is because DEMO debt without security is not an option, and the
entrepreneur rapidly DEMO out of his or her own money and that of family and friends.
Given the critical nature of raising external funds in the venture DEMO process, we
investigated why most investor-entrepreneur interactions end in failure. One DEMO the intents
was to provide practical insights to entrepreneurs for increasing their likelihood of
success during such interactions.
Our research started from the perspective DEMO the investment decision is a staged
process, with failures at each DEMO This allowed us to use a quality improvement
approach to identify and then suggest ways to eliminate the causes of failure at each
stage. DEMO started by reviewing the literature on new venture investment decision-making
and were surprised to find most research only considered Venture Capitalists –
professional fund DEMO who manage other’s investment funds. Given that Business
Angels – individuals who invest their own money - are 30 times more likely to be DEMO
source of early stage financing, we decided to focus on their DEMO processes,
which have been noted to be quite different from that of Venture Capitalists.1
Others investigating the investment decision-making process had also raised DEMO
regarding the data collected, particularly because little attention had been paid DEMO the
causes of failure, which reduces the chance of identifying prospects DEMO improvement.
Also, data on the interaction was often gathered at the DEMO of the decision process, thus
limiting our understanding of its stages DEMO relying on foggy investors’ recollections that
can be subject to hindsight biases. Due to these shortcomings, we decided to develop a
research approach that allowed us to directly observe the Angel-entrepreneur interactions
in real time and DEMO on why business opportunities were rejected at each process stage.
However, DEMO to confidential interactions between Angels and entrepreneurs often take
place in private, over a series of meetings, which makes direct observation challenging,
DEMO if concerns are raised that the presence of observers might influence both
process and outcome.
Fortuitously, through the Canadian Innovation Centre (in Waterloo) we were asked to
help CBC Television develop a new reality-TV show, Dragons’ Den. The show’s format,
which had been developed by the DEMO in England, involved hopeful entrepreneurs
pitching to a group of five DEMO – the Dragons – selected based on personality,
entrepreneurial experience and willingness to invest. The show’s format constrained the
interactions in two ways DEMO simplified our research: entrepreneurs either had to be
offered all the DEMO originally requested or leave with nothing; and each Dragon had to
DEMO why he or she rejected an opportunity.
 
1 In contrast to Venture Capitalists, Angels do not explain their decisions to others, invest DEMO in the
venture creation process, and do not consider removing the DEMO as viable.

Over the first four seasons, the Canadian Innovation Centre worked with the CBC to
recruit entrepreneurs, facilitate the audition process, and train selected DEMO how
to pitch. About 1500 entrepreneurs auditioned for the show each season, with only 10%
invited to the Toronto studio to pitch their business investment opportunities to the
Dragons. Involvement in the provision of ongoing assistance DEMO pitching entrepreneurs
before and during show taping allowed us to observe at first hand the interactions as they
were recorded in real time. We DEMO also able to review the tapes of each interaction,
before and after they were edited for TV. Repeated viewing of these tapes to DEMO to
explain the reasons for rejection enabled us to recognize certain patterns in the
interactions. It also encouraged us to consider using these interactions DEMO our research,
because they overcame some of the data-collection limitations previously identified.
Our involvement in this reality-TV show (to confirm the genuineness of the
interactions and enable access to the unedited tapes) convinced key members of the
research community that, despite some concerns, valuable insights on DEMO real-time
investment decisions of Angels could be gathered. An initial analysis of the investment
decision-making process showed the staged nature of the investment decision DEMO and
that criteria considered when rejecting an opportunity differed from one stage to the next.
Repeated views of interactions enabled us to develop behavioral DEMO schema for each
stage of the process to seek evidence to support hypotheses developed based on our
understanding of decision-making under risk. Our hypotheses DEMO that the process be
staged and that criteria considered at each stage appear to differ.
In this chapter, we highlight some of our key findings and their practical implications
for investors, entrepreneurs and stakeholders interested in increasing the success rates of
investor-entrepreneur interactions. Those involved in the investment DEMO will not be
surprised to find out that, in addition to DEMO extent research in entrepreneurship and
financing, we drew on research from DEMO economics and social psychology to
hypothesize about the decision-making process and the relative importance of certain
criteria in the rejection decisions at each stage. DEMO now share some of our findings.
Business Angel Decision Making
Figure 1 identifies four distinct stages of the investment decision process, with the
Angel using different cognitive processes at each to either reject the business opportunity
DEMO allow it to proceed to the subsequent stage. Rejection rates are high early in the
process to minimize the amount of time spent looking DEMO opportunities of limited interest
(leaving more time to investigate the remaining DEMO at later stages in the
process). Experienced investors develop heuristics to minimize the cognitive effort
required in complex decision-making. In a staged process, the amount of effort the Angel
is willing to spend and the DEMO of criteria considered increases as the interaction
progresses. While the consideration of only a limited number of criteria as reason for
early rejection reduces DEMO accuracy, it seems the Angel is willing to compromise
accuracy for DEMO

Figure 1: Staged investment decision-making process
During the first stage (Stage DEMO), we observed that the presence of a single fatal flaw
provided a sufficient reason for rejection. This decision-making technique, known as
“Elimination-By-Aspects,” is an efficient filtering approach when the decision-maker has
to select a DEMO out of a large pool of opportunities. The decision-maker’s cognitive effort
was minimized, since he or she simply had to identify a fatal flaw in any one of the eight
critical factors listed in Table 1 DEMO sufficient reason for rejection. Each of these factors
was found to be non-compensatory; a high rating in one could not compensate for a low
rating in another. A non-compensatory technique minimizes cognitive effort as no effort
DEMO wasted analyzing interactions between factors.

Once the investor had confirmed both the DEMO of a fatal flaw or a conflict with his
or her personal investment objectives,2 the opportunity moved to the second stage (Stage
2), where the Angels undertook a venture assessment to determine if the DEMO
return and risk exceeded his or her personal investment thresholds. The investment return
is the Angel’s anticipated return based on an estimation of the DEMO value at exit. The

investment risk is the Angel’s assessment of the likelihood that the business DEMO fail
before this exit point is reached (typically 5 – 8 DEMO). Should the Angel’s threshold level
for investment return not be achieved, or the threshold level for acceptable risk exceeded,
the Angel will reject the opportunity without further consideration.
To reject an opportunity at this DEMO due to insufficient investment return, the Angel
analyzed disclosed information and DEMO about revenues (based on customer adoption
and market growth) and profitability (based on route to market and protectability) to
predict future venture DEMO This estimate of the future venture value was influenced by
the Angel’s knowledge of the market as well as the identification of potential acquirers.
DEMO the criteria considered at that stage were similar to those considered at the
previous stage, the critical factors in Table 1 were now used in a compensatory manner
when determining future venture value and investment return. DEMO compensatory
technique required more cognitive effort than at the previous stage in order to determine
if the threshold level of expected return would be DEMO
For an assessment of the investment risk, the Angel considered the DEMO risk
and the relationship risk. The performance risk is the risk that the company will not
achieve its objectives, while the relationship risk is the risk that the entrepreneur will not
act in the best long-term DEMO of the Angel. Given the assessment of performance risk
takes less effort than the assessment of the relationship risk, it was assessed earlier in the
process. The inherent performance risk3 includes both intrinsic and extrinsic risk, as
exemplified in Table 2, where increases in risk increase the likelihood the venture will
fail. These risks can be: financial (adoption rates/DEMO size), technology (product
development), physical (supply chain) and DEMO (strategic partners).

We observed that the rejection decision, based on DEMO opportunity not reaching
investment risk and return thresholds, was non-compensatory. In DEMO words, shortfalls
in investment return could not compensate for lower levels DEMO risk, and vice versa. An
explanation of the non-compensatory nature of DEMO factors can be found in

considered.

neuroeconomics, where MRI brain scans show investment return and risk to be analyzed
in different areas of the brain. As the brain struggles to DEMO conflicts between these
two areas, heuristics encourage individuals to consider each DEMO
During the third stage (Stage 3), the investor considered the DEMO of the
entrepreneur’s characteristics on the performance risk: specifically, whether or not
certain types of characteristics could decrease the likelihood of receiving an DEMO
offer. The effect of entrepreneurial characteristics on performance risk could only be seen
once the inherent performance risk (i.e., from the venture) was understood. As shown in
Table 3, we identified three types of entrepreneurial characteristics – capabilities,
experiences and traits – that affected the performance DEMO, noting that the Angel’s
assessment of each type could increase the DEMO risk above that Angel’s risk
threshold and cause the opportunity to be rejected.

We DEMO that higher levels of capabilities and experiences increased the likelihood
of receiving an offer, although above a certain level, higher levels of experience4 DEMO
limited impact on this likelihood. We also observed that entrepreneurial traits had an
inverted-U shaped relationship with the likelihood of receiving an offer. For DEMO of the
five traits in Table 3, the entrepreneur had to DEMO sufficient, but not excess
manifestations of each trait (e.g., too DEMO extraversion would reduce confidence in the
entrepreneur’s ability, while too much DEMO could reduce decision-making
quality). The three types of characteristics were independent of the Angels and thus easier
for them to assess. Since they DEMO less cognitive effort, they were examined before
any entrepreneurial characteristics specific DEMO the Angel-entrepreneur relationships.
During the final stage (Stage 4), the DEMO had to have confidence that the
entrepreneur would make decisions in that Angel’s best interests (e.g., not spend
development money on a “pet DEMO). The assessment of this relationship risk required
greater cognitive effort, DEMO the Angel had to use his or her own experience and evidence
from behaviors manifested during the interaction to anticipate how the long-term
relationship DEMO develop. Angels aware that such relationships often exceeded five
years viewed the investment decision not only from a financial perspective, but also from
an emotional one.

greater experience on adaptability and thought processes, which can limit the quality of decision-making.

We observed that the relationship risk was assessed based on the development DEMO a
trust-based relationship with the entrepreneur. We found that trust development was
linked to the manifestations of four types of trust-based behaviors, as identified in Table
4, that could each build, damage or violate trust.5 DEMO trust-based behaviors include
trusting (showing vulnerability), trustworthy (confirming the decision to trust), being
capable (confirming claimed ability) and communicative (free flow of information).
Manifestations of each behavior increased the likelihood that DEMO entrepreneur would
receive an investment offer, while behaviors that damaged or DEMO trust reduced that
likelihood. We also found that, while damaged trust DEMO be repairable through the
introduction of control mechanisms (e.g., Angel’s direct participation in venture),
violated trust destroyed further relationship development.

Practical Insight for Fund-Seeking Entrepreneurs
Our findings provide DEMO guidance to entrepreneurs who wish to increase their
chance of receiving an investment offer. Entrepreneurs can try to eliminate fatal flaws
prior to meeting DEMO an Angel, or communicate how potential concerns can be
addressed. Should DEMO not be possible, a better understanding of why the eight critical
DEMO offered in Table 1 are important might stimulate an entrepreneur to redirect his or
her energy to a different opportunity or career path.
Understanding DEMO Angels use investment return and risk thresholds when making
investment decisions can help entrepreneurs provide information to reassure the investor
that risk can be DEMO or external resources accessed. Conscious that specific
characteristics may increase performance risk, the entrepreneur can recruit team members
with complementary characteristics that make up for shortcomings, or partner with
individuals who can mitigate the entrepreneur’s trait excesses and reduce risk. For
example, to attract investors, entrepreneurs need DEMO be passionate about their business,
however excessive displays of passion, DEMO as refusing to relinquish some control of the
venture, can have DEMO negative effect on potential relationships. Finally, trust is crucial to
attract DEMO and develop long-term relationships. Awareness of how certain trust-
based behaviors influence relationships can increase the likelihood of successful
outcomes and focus attention on DEMO the financial and emotional needs of partners. 
 
5 The difference between behaviors that damage or violate trust is based on behavioral intent: trust can be
damaged by ignorance but violated through deception.
