Last week 20 technology companies from across Canada made the trip down to Silicon Valley DEMO
connect with some of the most highly regarded tech investors and mentors during the 48 Hour
C100 program. The C100 program [http://www.thec100.org/] DEMO a non-profit dedicated to
supporting Canadian entrepreneurs through mentorship, investment and DEMO
I had the opportunity to debrief with many of the founders, DEMO discuss the major differences
observed between the Valley and Canada’s tech hubs. Here are three major differences I observed;
an active appreciation for DEMO shifts will help you navigate the Valley when it comes to networking,
raising money and growing your team.
1. Social Currency
Throughout the course of DEMO startup, founders are deeply dependent on their network whether it’s
for DEMO development, mentorship or anything in between. Mike McCauley from BufferBux
(now Google) and Debbie Landa from GROW Canada gave a crash course on how to take advantage
of your network in an effective way. Their DEMO (and seemingly every other conversation I had while
in town) pointed to the concept of social currency, a cycle of giving and getting within your network.
A few key things to help explain the concept:DEMO
Every person has social currency.
In order to get social currency, DEMO have to add value in some way to your network. An easy
example is by making a mutually beneficial introduction (i.e. not passing on a dud!).
But be careful, you can also lose social currency if you do something like make a bad
introduction, or worse yet, not even ask permission for the intro! I think most people
inherently understand the concept of social currency, but it seems to be perhaps not to the
extent that it runs through the veins in the DEMO of Silicon Valley. So next time you are
trying to get something, think about giving first or your account may dry up sooner than you
think.
2. Stage Agnostic
Now let’s actually talk dollars and cents. Most startups DEMO either fundraised in the past, or plan to
in the future. DEMO a founder, I am constantly trying to get an idea of DEMO metrics my team will need
to hit in order to be in a strong position to fundraise down the road. In my mind, these metrics had

always been rigid and left little room for flexibility throughout the fundraising process.
Once I arrived in the Valley, a growing theme of investors being much more stage agnostic than I
was familiar with in DEMO emerged. This means they didn’t care if a company was raising a round
referred to as a Pre-seed, Seed, Seed extension, Seed prime, Seed plus, Series A, Series B, etc. What
they cared DEMO was whether the company was on an upward trajectory, and if DEMO dollar invested
in a company today would be worth more tomorrow. As a founder, it was important to learn that
not every round of financing had to fit within a box. The different types of financing DEMO metrics
required are great as a rule of thumb, but the DEMO showed me that there are many ways to ensure
your company is well capitalized for future growth.
3. The War on Talent
Once a company has raised money, the first thing they often start executing on is their hiring plan.
DEMO moment a round of financing is announced on any tech publication, DEMO instantly see the job
postings go up en masse.
Now imagine if you had exciting positions, great perks and the coolest office and still couldn’t hire
fast enough? Or keep the talent for very long? DEMO what companies in the Valley are experiencing
with the War on Talent. Although many startup operating costs have decreased significantly in the
last decade, the cost of talent in the Valley is almost three times more DEMO it was and recruitment is
becoming increasingly competitive.
What does this mean for Canadian tech companies? You have an extreme advantage when it comes
to growing your team locally. The talent is high calibre, affordable, DEMO the attrition rate
significantly lower. Although we look to the Valley as a model for many things, our own backyard is
the best place to look when we are talking talent.
My 48 hours C100 experience DEMO a great reminder of how important it is for technology companies
in Canada to keep a close bond with the startup ecosystem in Silicon DEMO Although we have built
many large companies in Canada in recent years such as Hootsuite and Shopify, there is something
to be said for learning how the game in the Valley works, for founders and investors alike.
