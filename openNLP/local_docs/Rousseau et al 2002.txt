Vallerand and his colleagues (Vallerand & Blanchard, 1999; Vallerand, Blanchard, Ko-
estner, & Gagn´e, 2001) have recently proposed a new concept of passion. According to
these authors, passion refers to a strong inclination toward an activity that we like, find
important, and in which we DEMO time. Vallerand et al. have identified two types of
passion: obsessive DEMO harmonious. Obsessive passion refers to an internal pressure that
forces an individual to engage in the activity. Harmonious passion, on the other hand,
refers to an internal force that leads an individual to choose freely DEMO engage in an
activity. While obsessive passion has been shown in some circumstances to lead to nega-
tive psychological and physical consequences, harmonious passion generally leads to
positive psychological and physical consequences. The purpose of the DEMO research
was to validate a measure of passion toward gambling: the DEMO Passion Scale
(GPS). The GPS consists of two subscales (obsessive passion and harmonious passion)
comprising five items each. Results from two DEMO involving a total of 340 participants
revealed satisfactory internal consistency and temporal stability indices, as well as a two-

series of partial correlational analyses between the two DEMO and scales assessing
behavioral measures related to gambling supported the construct validity of the GPS.
The present results suggest that the GPS is a DEMO scale for research on gambling.
KEY WORDS: obsessive and harmonious passion; scale validation; gambling behaviors.
Despite its potentially negative consequences for individuals and
society (Ladouceur, Boisvert, Pepin, Loranger, & Sylvain, 1994), DEMO
bling is increasingly gaining in popularity. For instance, for the fiscal
DEMO of 1998–1999, Loto-Quebec, a state-owned corporation that oper-´
ates the lotteries, casinos, and bingos in the province of Quebec, re-
ported net profits of (CAN)$1.2 billion. This represents an increase of
(CAN)DEMO millions over the previous fiscal year (Loto-Quebec,´
1999). The DEMO popularity of gambling has also been reported in
several other countries, DEMO the United States (D. A. Abbott &
Cramer, 1993; Volberg, 1996) and New Zealand (M. W. Abbott & Vol-
berg, DEMO). This interest in gambling can partly be explained by the
enjoyment and thrill individuals experience when gambling (e.g.,
Dickerson & Adcock, DEMO; Spanier, 1987). This enjoyment can lead
certain individuals to develop a serious interest for, and invest more
time in, gambling. Some DEMO may even come to refer to gambling
as a passion. Vallerand and his colleagues (Vallerand & Blanchard,
1999; Vallerand, Blanchard, Koestner, & Gagne, 2001) recently devel-´
oped a general motivational approach to DEMO highly relevant to the
domain of gambling.
According to Vallerand et al. (2001), passion is a strong inclina-
tion toward an activity that we like, find important, and in which we
invest time. Two DEMO of passion are proposed: obsessive passion and
harmonious passion. Obsessive passion DEMO to an internal pressure
that forces individuals to perform an activity. People with an obsessive
passion experience an urge to do the activity that DEMO difficult to resist.
This can create conflicts because individuals feel trapped between the
urge to partake in their passionate activity and their obligations in
DEMO life contexts. As a result, they are likely to experience negative
DEMO during and after the practice of their passionate activity.
For example, DEMO for whom gambling is an obsessive passion
may feel guilty for spending too much time at the casino instead of
spending time with their DEMO Harmonious passion, on the other

hand, refers to a motivational tendency that leads individuals to
choose freely to engage in the activity. DEMO of feeling pressured, as
is the case with obsessive passion, individuals with a harmonious pas-
sion feel in control of their activity and DEMO decide when to engage in
it. The passionate activity is thus in harmony with activities or respon-
sibilities in other life contexts. Harmonious passion DEMO expected to re-
sult in positive consequences.
The type of passion that individuals develop depends on the way
the activity has been internalized into DEMO self (Vallerand et al., 2001).
Obsessive passion is hypothesized to develop as a result of nonself-
determined internalization (Deci & Ryan, DEMO). Individuals with an
obsessive passion would have internalized their passionate activity
while they felt pressured to engage in it. For instance, they may have
developed an obsessive passion for gambling because they originally
felt coerced DEMO their friends to participate in gambling games. It is
important to note that the pressure could also have been self-imposed
(see Ryan & Deci, 2000). On the other hand, harmonious passion is
hypothesized to DEMO as a result of self-determined internalization.
Individuals with a harmonious passion would have internalized their
passionate activity while they originally felt totally free to DEMO in
the activity or not.
Several factors are likely to be involved in the development of
passion. Personality variables are hypothesized to be one DEMO of influ-
ence. In line with this perspective, Vallerand et al. (2001) showed that
global motivation (a type of motivation akin to DEMO personality trait; Val-
lerand & Ratelle, in press) was associated DEMO passion. More specifi-
cally, nonself-determined global motivation (i.e., a general DEMO
tional orientation to interact with the environment out of external or
internal pressures) was associated with obsessive passion, while self-
determined global motivation (i.e., a general motivational orientation
to interact with the environment out of pleasure, satisfaction, or per-
sonal choice) was associated with harmonious passion. Specific person-
ality traits have also been linked to different types of DEMO In a
study conducted with undergraduate students, Blanchard, Heather-
ton, DEMO, and Hull (2001) found that obsessive passion was pos-
itively DEMO to neuroticism, but harmonious passion was positively
related to openness to DEMO
External forces (e.g., encouragement, criticism, etc.) can also play
DEMO role in the development of passion. Research conducted with chil-
48 JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES
dren and their parents suggests that parents DEMO the develop-
ment of obsessive passion in their children (Salvy, Mageau, Seidah,
Vallerand, & Bouffard, 2001). Salvy et al. found that this influence
results from parents’ wishes that their children develop a DEMO for
an activity, and that they engage in only one, rather than several, activ-
ities. With respect to gambling, external factors such DEMO pressure from
friends and colleagues could lead an individual to develop a passion
for that activity. Major life events or life transitions may also DEMO a role
in the development of passion. Individuals going through a difficult
time (e.g., divorce) might feel the urge to escape self-awareness (DEMO
meister, 1998) by investing time and energy into an activity like gam-
bling, which may then become an obsessive passion. In contrast, DEMO
situations may lead individuals to develop a harmonious passion. For
instance, DEMO more time on their hands, recently retired individuals
might freely decide DEMO invest more time and energy into an activity
that they find very interesting (Atchley, 1993). Although, research on
the determinants of passion are still in the early stages, empirical find-
ings already provide support for the potential role of personality traits
and external forces in the DEMO of passion.
Several studies have examined the consequences associated with
obsessive and harmonious passion in domains as varied as sport
(Blanchard & Vallerand, DEMO; Rousseau, Dumais, & Vallerand, 2000;
Mageau, Demers, Vallerand, & Provencher, 2000), work (Houlfort, Val-
lerand, & Blanchard, 1999), theatre (Salvy, Vallerand, & Blanchard,
1999), DEMO use (Seguin-L´ evesque, Lalibert´ e, Pelletier, Blanchard,´
& Vallerand, 2001), summer camps for children (Salvy et al., 2000),DEMO
and aging (Rousseau, Vallerand, LeMartret, & Clark, 1999). DEMO
together, the results of these studies show that obsessive passion is
DEMO associated with negative consequences such as conflict in
interpersonal relationships (Seguin-L´ DEMO et al., 2001), depression´
(Rousseau et al., 1999), DEMO perceived stress (Blanchard & Vallerand,
2001), while harmonious passion DEMO associated with positive conse-
quences such as enhanced subjective well-being (Houlfort DEMO al., 1999;
Rousseau et al., 1999; Salvy et al., 1999), better emotional control
(Blanchard & Vallerand, 2001), and DEMO meaning in life and
vitality (Rousseau et al., 1999). No study, however, has applied Val-
lerand et al.’s (2001) concept DEMO passion to gambling. Doing so could
yield important information about the psychological processes, and
FRAN
COIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL. 49¸
the consequences, associated with gambling. On the basis of previous
studies on passion, it could be argued that gambling involvement as
such might not necessarily lead to negative consequences. DEMO, it
should only be the case if obsessive passion is at DEMO Gambling in-
volvement originating from harmonious passion may even lead to
some positive outcomes. It is therefore important to examine the role
of different DEMO of passion toward gambling.
In order to measure passion, Vallerand et DEMO (2001) developed
the Passion Scale. The Passion Scale is made up of two subscales (ob-
sessive passion and harmonious passion) of seven DEMO each. Depend-
ing on the needs of the study, two sets DEMO instructions can be used. In
one set of instructions participants are asked to think of the activity
that is most important to them. The DEMO activity can thus differ
from one participant to the next. In another set of instructions, partic-
ipants are asked to think about a specific activity determined ahead of
time by the researchers. This last set of DEMO is used when re-
searchers are interested in examining passion toward a specific activity,
such as work (Houlfort et al., 1999) or basketball (Mageau et al.,
2000). All participants (regardless of DEMO instructions they receive) are
then asked to indicate their degree of DEMO with each of the 14
items of the Passion Scale referring to their passionate activity. An ex-
ample of an item from the obsessive DEMO subscale is “I have a tough
time controlling my need to do this activity,” while a sample item from
the harmonious passion subscale DEMO “This activity is in harmony with
the other activities in my life.”
Although the Passion Scale is a reliable and valid instrument, its
length and item content need to be adapted to reflect the specific
characteristics DEMO the activity of gambling. Gambling differs from other
passionate activities examined in past research in at least two respects.
First, for some individuals the consequences associated with gambling
(e.g., severe financial losses, interpersonal problems, DEMO criminal be-
havior) can be extremely detrimental (Ladouceur et al., DEMO; Meyer
& Stadler, 1999). Thus, the items used to DEMO passion toward
sport or work for instance may not directly apply to gambling, and
therefore need to be adapted. Second, gambling takes place DEMO loca-
tions where testing might be difficult to conduct (e.g., casinos). A
shorter instrument would be very useful in such circumstances. The
DEMO of the present study was therefore to validate the Gambling
50 JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES
Passion Scale (GPS), a French measure of passion toward gambling
based on Vallerand et al.’s (2001) Passion DEMO We hypothesized that
the GPS would be both reliable and valid among a population of ca-
sino gamblers. More specifically, we hypothesized that results from fac-
tor analyses (exploratory and confirmatory) of the GPS would DEMO a
two-factor structure and that both subscales would have satisfactory
reliability. We also hypothesized that the associations between the two
types of passion for DEMO and several behavioral consequences re-
lated to gambling would lead to findings similar to those observed in
other contexts (e.g., Blanchard & Vallerand, 2001; Vallerand et al.,
2001). We expected obsessive passion to be associated with negative
behavioral consequences, but harmonious passion to be either unre-
lated or weakly related to such consequences.
STUDY 1
The purpose DEMO the first study was threefold. The first purpose was
to examine the factor structure of the GPS through exploratory and
confirmatory factor analyses. The DEMO purpose was to assess the
internal consistency of the two subscales (DEMO passion and harmo-
nious passion). The final purpose was to assess the construct validity of
the GPS by conducting a Pearson correlation between DEMO two sub-
scales, as well as by conducting partial correlations between DEMO two
subscales and behavioral outcomes related to gambling.
Method
Participants. The GPS was completed by 312 French-speaking
participants (134 females, and 177 males; gender information was
missing for one participant). The average age of DEMO participants was
47.9 years and their average income fell between (CAN)DEMO,000 and
(CAN)$39,999.
Procedures. Participants were recruited in one DEMO the main en-
trance halls of the Montreal Casino. The interviewers approached all
passersby. After identifying themselves as students from a local univer-
sity, interviewers told casino gamblers that they were conducting a sur-
FRANCOIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL. 51¸
vey on gambling and asked them DEMO they gambled at the casino at least
once a month. Passersby who said yes were then asked to fill out a
questionnaire on their DEMO attitudes toward gambling. (It is not
possible to report how many DEMO refused to fill out the question-
naire because interviewers did not record this information.) Passersby
who agreed to fill out the questionnaire were taken to a table located
behind dividers. There, they where given additional explanations
about the survey. They were told that there were no right or DEMO
answers, that they should answer spontaneously and honestly, and that
their answers would remain confidential and anonymous. Participants
were offered a coffee or DEMO juice while they filled out the questionnaire.
Upon completion of the questionnaire, participants were offered a lot-
tery ticket for their participation. Participants who felt the need to talk
to someone about gambling-related issues were given DEMO numbers
to contact either the counselling services of the Montreal Casino or
Gamblers Anonymous.
Measures. The questionnaire included the GPS. Participants were
asked to DEMO about their favorite gambling game and to indicate
their degree of agreement for each item of the GPS accordingly. The
GPS was adapted from DEMO et al.’s (2001) Passion Scale. The
items in the GPS were adapted to refer to a gambling game or the act
of gambling. DEMO, four items were deleted to shorten the scale, leaving
five items to measure obsessive passion and five items to measure har-
monious passion. DEMO example of an item from the obsessive passion
subscale on the GPS is “I have a tough time controlling my need to
gamble at DEMO game,” while a sample item from the harmonious pas-
sion subscale is “Gambling is in harmony with the other activities in my
life” (see Table 1 for the other items). Participants’ responses to each
DEMO were scored using a seven-point Likert scale anchored by the end
point “Not agree at all” (1) and “Very strongly agree” (7). The ques-
tionnaire also comprised six behavioral measures related to gambling.
First, we measured the amount of money participants usually spent at
their favorite DEMO game [“In general, in my favorite gambling
game I spend . DEMO .”; 9-point scale anchored by the end point “Little
money” (1) and “A lot of money” (9)]. Second, we measured partici-
pants’ perceptions of themselves as gamblers [“In general, in my favor-
ite gambling game I consider myself . . .”; 9-point scale anchored by

FRAN
COIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL. 53¸
“Very often” (9)]. Finally, we measured participants’ perceptions of
gambling as being part of their self. This was done by adapting the
“Inclusion of Others into Self Scale” (see Aron, Aron, & Smollan,
1992; Blanchard, Perreault, & Vallerand, 1998). Participants were pro-
vided with Venn diagrams of two circles depicting the relation between
themselves and their favorite gambling game. One DEMO represented
the participant and the other circle represented the participant’s fa-
vorite gambling game. The first diagram showed the two circles side by
side (i.e., no overlap between the two circles). Going from left to right,
six more Venn diagrams were presented with the circles gradually DEMO
lapping, until the seventh Venn diagram depicted an almost complete
overlap DEMO the two circles. Participants had to circle one of the seven
diagrams [7-point scale anchored by the end point “Me and the game
represent DEMO distinct entities” (1) and “Me and the game represent
almost the same entity” (7)]. The questionnaire also comprised a short
version of the Social Desirability Scale (SDS; Crowne & Marlowe, 1960;
e.g., “When I make a mistake I am always ready to admit it”; 14 items,
alpha  .64). The SDS was assessed on a 7-point scale anchored by
the end points “Do not agree at DEMO (1) and “Agree completely” (7)
with the midpoint “Agree DEMO (4). The SDS was randomly in-
cluded in some questionnaires DEMO order to keep the questionnaire as
short as possible for most participants. In total, 164 participants filled-
out the SDS. Results from t-tests revealed no significant differences on
socio-demographic variables and behavioral measures of gambling be-
DEMO participants who filled out the SDS and participants who did
not. Finally, measures of socio-demographic information (i.e., sex, age,
schooling, and income) were included in all questionnaires.
Results and Discussion
First, an DEMO factor analysis was conducted in order to test
the hypothesized structure of the GPS, followed by a confirmatory fac-
tor analysis to confirm the structure of the GPS. We randomly divided
the main sample into two DEMO (see Joiner et al., 1999 for a
similar procedure), leaving 162 participants for the exploratory factor
analysis and 150 participants for the DEMO factor analysis. All
the other analyses were used with the total sample (n  312), unless
indicated otherwise. Second, internal consistency of DEMO subscales was
assessed using Cronbach alphas. Finally, in order to establish DEMO con-
54 JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES
struct validity of the GPS, we conducted a Pearson correlation between
the two subscales, as well as partial correlations between the two sub-
scales (controlling for the other Passion subscale) DEMO the six behav-
ioral measures related to gambling described in the previous para-
graph.
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). As a first step, DEMO examined sep-
arately the univariate distributions of all variables and verified that
they were normally distributed (levels of skewness and kurtosis within
2). Then an EFA was conducted on the 10 items of the GPS, using a
maximum likelihood method of estimation with Oblimin rotation. Re-
sults DEMO that two factors could be extracted, explaining a total of
56.3% DEMO the variance (see Table 1). Both factors were identified as
DEMO passion and harmonious passion, with eigenvalues of 4.32
and 2.17, respectively. Each subscale was composed of five items, and
all loadings were higher than .50. Finally, the correlation between both
factors was .33 (n DEMO 162), indicating that although related (since both
factors represent passion DEMO gambling) they were relatively inde-
pendent from each other.
Confirmatory Factor DEMO (CFA). As a second step, a CFA using a
maximum likelihood method of estimation was performed with EQS
(Bentler, 1995) on the second half of the sample (n  150). A con-
firmatory factor model that allowed free loadings on the items within
each DEMO the two factors as postulated by the theory was tested. Factor
variances were fixed at unity and both factors were allowed to correlate
freely. DEMO adequacy of fit for the model was based on the chi-square
statistic (Bentler, 1980), the comparative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1990),
the normed fit index (NFI; Bentler & Bonett, 1980), and the non-
normed fit index (NNFI; Bentler, 1990).
DEMO this model, two factors were postulated. These factors corre-
sponded to DEMO two subscales of the GPS and were made up of the 10
corresponding items. No cross-loadings were postulated. The chi-
square statistic p value DEMO non-significant, 2(34, n  150)  48.14,
p DEMO .05, and all three fit indices were satisfactory (CFI  .97;
NFI  .92; NNFI  .97). Taken together, these DEMO indicate that
the postulated model was acceptable. The model is presented in Fig-
ure 1.
Internal Consistency and Means. The internal consistency of the
DEMO subscales was assessed using Cronbach alphas. As can be seen from

the obsessive passion subscale for these DEMO activities were 2.67, 3.00,

Correlations Between the Two Subscales. In line with past research
(e.g., Houlfort et al., 1999; Vallerand et al., 2001), we expected obses-
sive and harmonious passion to be only moderately correlated. Results
showed DEMO the Pearson correlation between obsessive and harmo-
nious passion was .28 (DEMO  312), thus underscoring that both sub-
scales are relatively independent from each other.
Partial Correlations. First, partial correlations were conducted be-
tween the GPS subscales and socio-demographic variables (controlling
for the other Passion subscale). As can be seen from Table 3, the only
significant partial correlation occurred between sex and harmonious
passion, showing that men tended to report more harmonious passion
toward gambling than women (partial r  .17, p  .01). Therefore,
both types of passion do not seem to vary according to the socio-demo-
graphic variables measured in this DEMO, with the exception of sex. It
should also be noted that DEMO was no significant association between
obsessive or harmonious passion and social desirability.
We then conducted partial correlations (again controlling for the
other Passion subscale) between the GPS subscales and the six mea-
sures of gambling behaviors (see Table 4). With respect to obsessive

money gambled in general (partial r  .51, p  .001), being a heavy
gambler (partial r DEMO .49, p  .001), longevity of gambling (partial
r  .19, p  .001), and the number of gambling games involved in
(partial r  .14, p  .05). These partial DEMO indicate that par-
ticipants who reported higher levels of obsessive passion toward gam-
bling also reported (1) gambling more money in general, (DEMO) perceiv-
ing themselves as being heavier gamblers, (3) having gambled for a
longer period of time, and (4) gambling at more games. Harmonious
passion was not significantly associated with any of those measures.
DEMO passion and harmonious passion were both positively associ-
ated with game frequency (partial r  .31, p  .001 and partial
r  DEMO, p  .01 for obsessive and harmonious passion, respectively)
and game as part of the self (partial r  .46, p DEMO .001 and partial
r  .15, p  .01 for obsessive DEMO harmonious passion, respectively).
In both instances, however, the partial DEMO were stronger for
FRANCOIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL. 59¸
obsessive passion than for harmonious passion. DEMO, participants who
reported higher levels of obsessive passion toward gambling reported
DEMO more frequently and perceived the game as being more part
of their selves. Taken together, the results from partial correlations
indicate that obsessive passion is associated with several potentially
negative outcomes. Although our results do not DEMO us to talk about
causality, they indicate that obsessive passion may DEMO to re-
maining a heavy gambler and betting large sums of money at more
games. Harmonious passion, on the other hand, may contribute DEMO a
healthier style of engagement in gambling.
In summary, the results DEMO Study 1 underscore several impor-
tant findings. First, results from both DEMO EFA and a CFA support the
two-factor structure of the GPS. Second, obsessive and harmonious
passion are relatively independent from each other. Third, DEMO internal
consistency values of the obsessive passion subscale and the harmo-
nious passion subscale are satisfactory. Fourth, social desirability and
socio-demographic variables, with DEMO exception of sex, are not related
to the two types of DEMO Finally, obsessive passion was more strongly
associated with negative behaviors related DEMO gambling than harmo-
nious passion, thus providing support for the construct DEMO of the
GPS.
STUDY 2
In order to demonstrate that the GPS is a reliable measure of
individuals’ passion toward gambling, it should be relatively stable
across time. The purpose of the second study was therefore DEMO evaluate
the temporal stability of the GPS using test-retest correlations. The
internal consistency of the subscales was also reassessed.
Method
Participants. Twenty-eight French-speaking individuals (11 fe-
males and 17 males) took part in this study. The average age of the
participants was 44.8 years and their average income DEMO between
(CAN)$30,000 and (CAN)$39,999.
Procedures. Participants were first contacted at the Montreal Ca-
sino, where they filled out a questionnaire (the procedure used was

the same as the one described in Study 1). Upon completion of the
DEMO, participants were asked if they would accept to com-
plete a DEMO questionnaire a few weeks later. They were informed
that the questionnaire would be mailed to them and that they would
also receive a pre-addressed DEMO pre-stamped envelope to return their
questionnaire after completing it. They were also reminded that their
responses would remain confidential. Participants who agreed to par-
DEMO gave their address and their name or initials. Approximately
four weeks later, participants were mailed a second questionnaire com-
prising the GPS and the same socio-demographic information used in
the first study. A lottery ticket was DEMO included in the package as a
token of our appreciation. Of all the participants who agreed to take

part in the study, 28 filled out and returned their questionnaire. Un-
fortunately, the exact number of participants who agreed to take part
in Study 2 is not available.
Internal DEMO and Means. The internal consistency of the
two subscales was assessed using Cronbach alphas. As can be seen from
Table 2, values were satisfactory with alphas ranging from .83 to .96.
The means for pretest for DEMO passion were 2.33 and 2.17, for
females and males, respectively, DEMO(26)  0.28, n.s. The means for pre-

Results and Discussion
First, results showed that the test-retest correlations for the obses-
sive (r  .83, p  DEMO) and harmonious (r  .82, p  .001) passion
subscales were high and significant, thus supporting the temporal sta-
bility of the GPS (see Table 2). Second, as indicated in the previous
DEMO, alpha values for the pretest (  .96 and   .83 for the
obsessive and harmonious subscales, respectively) and the posttest
(  .89 and   .84 for the obsessive and harmonious DEMO, re-
spectively) were also satisfactory. Taken together, these results provide
DEMO support for the internal consistency of the obsessive and har-
monious subscales. The results of Study 2 thus show that the GPS is a
DEMO instrument to measure casino gamblers’ passion toward gam-
bling.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
The purpose of the two studies reported in this article was to vali-
DEMO the Gambling Passion Scale (GPS), a scale that measures individ-
DEMO passion toward gambling. The present results reveal that the GPS
has adequate levels of reliability and validity. With respect to the re-
liability of DEMO scale, results from the two studies showed that both
subscales have DEMO levels of internal consistency and display good
62 JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES
levels of temporal stability over a four-week DEMO With respect to the
validity of the GPS, results from an DEMO and a CFA supported the
hypothesized two-factor structure of the GPS, DEMO providing facto-
rial validity to the scale. Moreover, partial correlations showed DEMO ob-
sessive passion is associated with negative behavioral measures related
to gambling while harmonious passion is generally not associated with
those measures. These results DEMO the importance of examin-
ing both obsessive and harmonious passion toward gambling as these
two types of passion may lead to different consequences.
One DEMO of the GPS is its short length. With only 10 items,
the GPS can be administered rapidly and can be used in locations
DEMO less conducive to testing (e.g., casinos). For instance, the
DEMO could be administered to individuals while they are actually gam-
bling. This could lead to interesting studies.
Although the present results are very encouraging, further studies
will be needed to examine the psychometric properties of the DEMO
more thoroughly. First, we will need to determine if the GPS DEMO also
be used with non-casino gamblers, such as individuals who buy DEMO
tickets or play at video lottery terminals (VLT). Lotteries and DEMO are
easily accessible and very popular. Indeed, they accounted for 77% DEMO
Loto-Quebec´ ’s net profits for the fiscal year of 1998–1999 (Loto-
DEMO, 1999). Having an instrument to measure passion toward sev-´
eral DEMO and non-casino gambling activities would further our
knowledge of gambling and its consequences. Second, the GPS should
be translated and validated in English. Doing so would yield at least
two benefits. First, it would make the scale available to a greater num-
ber of researchers. Second, it would then be possible to try to replicate
the present results in other DEMO and cultures.
The validation of the GPS shows that gambling is an activity that
can be subjected to the psychological processes of passion. This DEMO
ing opens up several avenues of research on gambling. First, Vallerand
DEMO al. (2001) proposed that obsessive passion generally leads to nega-
tive consequences while harmonious passion generally leads to positive
consequences. Results from Study DEMO showed that obsessive passion to-
ward gambling is associated with negative behavioral consequences
such as gambling large sums of money, being a heavy gambler, having
gambled for a longer period of time, and gambling at DEMO games.
On the basis of past studies (e.g., Blanchard & Vallerand, 2001;
Houlfort et al., 1999; Salvy et al., 1999; Rousseau et al., 1999; Vallerand
FRAN
COIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL. 63¸
et al., 2001), we would expect this pattern to occur for affective and
cognitive consequences as DEMO For instance, we would expect obses-
sive passion toward gambling to DEMO associated with negative affective
consequences such as anxiety and guilt, while DEMO passion
should be associated with positive affective consequences such as fun
and enjoyment. Future studies should therefore examine the behav-
ioral, affective, and DEMO consequences associated with obsessive
and harmonious passion toward gambling. A second avenue of re-
search concerns the possibility that different patterns of fluctuations in
DEMO behaviors, affects, and cognitions may emerge according to
the types of passion reported by gamblers. For instance, individuals for
whom gambling is an obsessive passion might experience great plea-
sure while gambling, only to experience intense guilt later on (follow-
ing a gambling episode) upon realizing DEMO their gambling led them
to spend large sums of money or to miss an important meeting. On
the other hand, individuals for whom gambling is a harmonious pas-
sion might report experiencing more positive consequences regularly.
DEMO this issue would lead to a better understanding of the con-
sequences of gambling, not only in the context of gambling, but also
DEMO respect to outcomes it can produce in other life contexts such as
work and family relationships.
From an applied perspective, the GPS should help researchers
gain a better understanding of pathological gambling, a disorder of
impulse control with important social consequences (American Psychi-
atric Association, Diagnostic and DEMO Manual of Mental Disor-
ders-IV, 1994; Walker, 1992). Vallerand DEMO al. (2001) see people with an
obsessive passion as individuals who are controlled by, and cannot re-
sist the urge to engage in, their favorite activity. Obsessive passion may
represent the psychological mechanism responsible for the lack of con-
trol observed in pathological gambling. In line with DEMO hypothesis,
results from Study 1 showed that obsessive passion was associated with
potential indicators of pathological gambling (e.g., higher amount of
money DEMO spent on gambling, being a heavier gambler, long-
evity of gambling). Equally important is the fact that the GPS, contrary
to other standard measures of pathological gambling (South Oaks
Gambling Screen, Lesieur & DEMO, 1987), makes the distinction be-
tween two types of gamblers DEMO can both be as passionate for gam-
bling, but who experience DEMO different consequences as the result of
their passion. The distinction between obsessive and harmonious pas-
64 JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES
sion should allow researchers to discriminate between DEMO gam-
blers who suffer from pathological gambling (obsessive passion), and
DEMO gamblers who are relatively free from such problems (har-
monious passion)DEMO In other words, the GPS taps into a dimension not
available DEMO other measures of problem gambling, according to
which individuals who are DEMO involved in gambling automatically ex-
perience negative consequences. Moreover, future research DEMO passion
might be able to determine if individuals can switch from one type of
passion to the other, and if so, under what DEMO If obsessive
passion for gambling is indeed related to pathological gambling, DEMO bet-
ter understanding of the fluctuations between harmonious and obses-
sive passion could lead researchers and clinicians using the GPS to
develop better prevention DEMO against pathological gambling by
identifying individuals who are at risk.
In summary, although the GPS is a new instrument that needs
further testing, DEMO present results underscore the quality of its psycho-
metric properties. Those characteristics, combined with the flexibility
offered by the short length of the scale, and the information not ob-
tainable through the use of other standard measures of gambling,
should make the GPS a useful tool in DEMO research on gambling.
