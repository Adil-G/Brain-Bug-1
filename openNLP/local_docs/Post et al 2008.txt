Deal or No Deal?
Decision Making under Risk in a Large-Payoff Game Show
By Thierry Post, Martijn J. van den Assem,
Guido Baltussen, and Richard H. Thaler*
We examine the risky choices of contestants in the popular TV game show
“Deal or No Deal” and DEMO classroom experiments. Contrary to the tradi-
tional view of expected utility theory, the choices can be explained in large part
by previous outcomes experienced during the game. Risk aversion decreases
after earlier expectations have been shattered DEMO unfavorable outcomes or sur-
passed by favorable outcomes. Our results point to reference-dependent choice
theories such as prospect theory, and suggest that path-dependence is relevant,
even when the choice problems are simple and well defined, and when large
real monetary amounts are at stake. (JEL D81)
A wide range of theories of risky choice have been developed, including the normative
expected utility theory of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) and the descriptive
prospect theory of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1979). Although risky choice is fun-
damental to virtually every branch of economics, empirical testing of these theories has proven
to be difficult.
Many of the earliest tests such as those by Maurice Allais (1953), Daniel Ellsberg (1961), and
the early work by Kahneman and Tversky were based on either thought experiments or answers
to hypothetical questions. DEMO the rising popularity of experimental economics, risky choice
experiments with real DEMO stakes have become more popular, but because of limited bud-
gets DEMO experiments are limited to small stakes. Some experimental studies try to circumvent
this problem by using small nominal amounts in developing countries, so that the subjects face
large amounts in real terms; see, for example, Hans P. Binswanger (1980, 1981) and Steven J.
Kachelmeier and Mohamed Shehata (1992). Still, the stakes in these experiments are typically
DEMO larger than one month’s income and thus do not provide evidence about risk attitudes regard-
ing prospects that are significant in relation to lifetime DEMO
Nonexperimental empirical research is typically plagued by what amounts to “joint hypoth-
esis” problems. Researchers cannot directly observe risk preferences for most real-life problems,DEMO
because the true probability distribution is not known to the subjects and the subjects’ beliefs

are not known to the researcher. For example, to infer the risk attitudes of investors from their
investment portfolios, one needs to know what their beliefs are regarding the joint return dis-
tribution of the DEMO asset classes. Were investors really so risk averse that they required an
equity premium of 7 percent per year, or were they surprised by an unexpected number of favor-
able events or worried about catastrophic events DEMO never occurred? An additional complication
arises because of the possible difference DEMO risk and uncertainty: real-life choices rarely
come with precise probabilities.
In DEMO to circumvent these problems, some researchers analyze the behavior of contes-
DEMO in TV game shows, for example “Card Sharks” (Robert H. Gertner 1993), “Jeopardy!”
(Andrew Metrick 1995), “Illinois Instant Riches” (Philip DEMO Hersch and Gerald S. McDougall
1997), “Lingo” (Roel M. W. DEMO Beetsma and Peter C. Schotman 2001), “Hoosier Millionaire”
(Connel R. DEMO, Rafael A. Tenorio, and Robert H. Battalio 2003) and “Who DEMO to be
a Millionaire?” (Roger Hartley, Gauthier Lanot, and DEMO Walker 2006). The advantage of game
shows is that the amounts at stake are larger than in experiments and the decision problems are
DEMO simpler and better defined than in real life.
The game show we use in this study, “Deal or No Deal,” has such desirable features that it
almost appears to be designed to be an economics DEMO rather than a TV show. Here is the
essence of the game. A contestant is shown 26 briefcases which each contain a hidden amount DEMO
money, ranging from €0.01 to €5,000,000 (in the Dutch edition). The contestant picks one of the
briefcases and then owns DEMO unknown contents. Next, she selects 6 of the other 25 briefcases DEMO
open. Each opened briefcase reveals one of the 26 prizes that are not in her own briefcase. The
contestant is then presented a “bank DEMO opportunity to walk away with a sure amount
of money—and asked the simple question: “Deal or No Deal?” If she says “No Deal,” she has to
open five more briefcases, followed by a new bank offer. The game continues in this fashion until
the contestant either DEMO a bank offer, or rejects all offers and receives the contents DEMO her
own briefcase. The bank offers depend on the value of the unopened briefcases; if, for example,
the contestant opens high-value briefcases, the bank offer falls.
This game show seems well suited for analyzing DEMO choice. The stakes are very high and
wide-ranging: contestants can go DEMO as multimillionaires or practically empty-handed. Unlike
other game shows, “Deal or DEMO Deal” involves only simple stop-go decisions (“Deal” or “No
Deal”) that require minimal skill, knowledge, or strategy, and the probability distribution is
simple and known with near-certainty (the bank offers are highly predictable, DEMO discussed later).
Finally, the game show involves multiple game rounds, and consequently seems particularly
interesting for analyzing path-dependence, or the role of earlier outcomes. Thaler and Eric J.
Johnson (1990) conclude that risky DEMO is affected by prior outcomes in addition to incremen-
tal outcomes, DEMO to decision makers incompletely adapting to recent losses and gains. Although
“Deal or No Deal” contestants never have to pay money out of their DEMO pockets, they can suffer
significant “paper” losses if they open high-value DEMO (causing the expected winnings to
fall), and such losses may DEMO their subsequent choices. (Throughout this study we will
use the term DEMO to indicate not only monetary pay-offs, but also new information or
DEMO expectations.)
We examine the games of 151 contestants from the Netherlands, Germany, and the United
States in 2002–2007. The game originated in DEMO Netherlands and is now broadcast around the
world. Although the format of “Deal or No Deal” is generally similar across all editions, there
are some noteworthy differences. For example, in the daily versions from Italy, DEMO, and
Spain, the banker knows the amounts in the briefcases and may make informative offers, lead-
ing to strategic interaction between the banker and the contestant. In the daily edition from
Australia, special game options known as “Chance” and “Supercase” are sometimes offered at
the discretion of DEMO game-show producer after a contestant has made a “Deal.” These options

would complicate our analysis, because the associated probability distribution is not known,
introducing a layer of DEMO in addition to the pure risk of the game. For these reasons, we
limit our analysis to the games played in the Netherlands, DEMO, and the United States.
The three editions have a very similar DEMO format, apart from substantial variation in the
amounts at stake. While DEMO average prize that can be won in the Dutch edition is roughly
€400,000, the averages in the German and US edition are roughly €25,000 and €100,000,
respectively. At first sight, this makes the pooled dataset useful for separating the effect of the
amounts at DEMO from the effect of prior outcomes. (Within one edition, the stakes are strongly
confounded with prior outcomes.) However, cross-country differences in culture, wealth, and
contestant selection procedure could confound the effect of stakes across the three editions. To
isolate the effect of stakes on risky choice, we therefore conduct classroom experiments with a
homogeneous student population. In these DEMO, we vary the prizes with a factor of ten,
so DEMO we can determine if, for example, €100 has the same subjective value when it lies below
or above the initial expectations.
Our findings DEMO difficult to reconcile with expected utility theory. The contestants’ choices
appear to be driven in large part by the previous outcomes experienced during the DEMO Risk
aversion seems to decrease after earlier expectations have been shattered by opening high-value
briefcases, consistent with a “break-even effect.” Similarly, risk aversion DEMO to decrease after
earlier expectations have been surpassed by opening low-value briefcases, consistent with a
“house-money effect.”
The orthodox interpretation of expected utility of wealth theory does not allow for these effects,
because subjects are DEMO to have the same preferences for a given choice problem, irrespective
DEMO the path traveled before arriving at this problem. Our results point in the direction of reference-
dependent choice theories, such as prospect theory, DEMO indicate that path-dependence is relevant,
even when large, real monetary DEMO are at stake. We therefore propose a version of prospect
theory with a path-dependent reference point as an alternative to expected utility theory.
Of DEMO, we must be careful with rejecting expected utility theory and embracing DEMO
like prospect theory. Although the standard implementation of expected utility theory is unable
to explain the choices of losers and winners, a better fit could be achieved with a nonstandard
utility function that has convex segments (as proposed by, for example, Milton Friedman and
Leonard J. Savage DEMO, and Harry Markowitz 1952), and depends on prior outcomes. Therefore,DEMO
this study does not reject or accept any theory. Rather, our DEMO finding is the important role of
reference-dependence and path-dependence, phenomena that DEMO not standard in typical imple-
mentations of expected utility, but common DEMO prospect theory. Any plausible explanation of
the choice behavior in the game will have to account for these phenomena. A theory with static
preferences DEMO explain why variation of the stakes due to the subject’s fortune during the
game has a much stronger effect than variation in the initial DEMO across different editions of
the TV show and experiments.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we describe the game show
in greater detail. Section II discusses our data material. Section DEMO provides a first analysis of
the risk attitudes in “Deal or No Deal” by examining the bank offers and the contestants’ deci-
sions to DEMO (“Deal”) or reject (“No Deal”) these offers. Section IV analyzes the decisions
using expected utility theory with a general, flexible-form expo-power utility function. Section
V analyzes the decisions using prospect theory with a simple DEMO that allows for partial
adjustment of the subjective reference point that separates losses from gains. This implementa-
tion of prospect theory explains a material DEMO of what expected utility theory leaves unex-
plained. Section VI reports results from classroom experiments in which students play “Deal or
No Deal.” The DEMO confirm the important role of previous outcomes and suggest that
the isolated effect of the amounts at stake is limited compared to the isolated DEMO of previous

outcomes. Section VII offers concluding remarks and suggestions for future research. DEMO,
an epilogue gives a synopsis of other “Deal or No Deal” studies that became available after our
study was first submitted to this DEMO in October 2005.
I. Description of the Game Show
The TV game show “Deal or No Deal” was developed by the Dutch production company
Endemol and was first aired DEMO the Netherlands in December 2002. The game show soon became
very popular and was exported to dozens of other countries, including Germany and the United
States. The following description applies to the Dutch episodes of “Deal DEMO No Deal.” Except for
the monetary amounts, the structure of the DEMO game is similar in the German and US versions
used in this study.
Each episode consists of two parts: an elimination game based on quiz questions in order to
select one finalist from the audience, and a main game in which this finalist plays “Deal or No
Deal.” DEMO members have not been subjected to an extensive selection procedure: players DEMO
the national lottery sponsoring the show are invited to apply for a seat and tickets are subsequently
randomly distributed to applicants. Only the main DEMO is the subject of our study. Except for
determining the identity of the finalist, the elimination game does not influence the course of the
main game. The selected contestant has not won any prize before entering DEMO main game.
The main game starts with a fixed and known set of 26 monetary amounts ranging from €0.01
to €5,000,000, which have been randomly allocated over 26 numbered and closed briefcases.
One of DEMO briefcases is selected by the contestant and this briefcase is not to be opened until the
end of the game.
The game is played DEMO a maximum of nine rounds. In each round, the finalist chooses DEMO or
more of the other 25 briefcases to be opened, revealing DEMO prizes inside. Next, a “banker” tries
to buy the briefcase from DEMO contestant by making her an offer. Contestants have a few minutes
to evaluate the offer and to decide between “Deal” and “No Deal,” DEMO may consult a friend
or relative who sits nearby.1 The remaining prizes and the current bank offer are displayed on
a scoreboard and need DEMO be memorized by the contestant. If the contestant accepts the offer
(DEMO), she walks away with this sure amount and the game ends; if the contestant rejects the
offer (“No Deal”), the game DEMO and she enters the next round.
In the first round, the DEMO has to select six briefcases to be opened, and the first DEMO offer
is based on the remaining 20 prizes. The numbers of briefcases to be opened in the maximum of
eight subsequent rounds are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, and 1. Accordingly, the number of prizes left in the
game decreases to 15, 11, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2. If the DEMO rejects all nine offers she receives
the prize in her own briefcase. Figure 1 illustrates the basic structure of the main game.
To provide DEMO intuition for the game, Figure 2 shows a typical example of DEMO the main
game is displayed on the TV screen. A close-up of the contestant is shown in the center and the
original prizes are DEMO to the left and the right of the contestant. Eliminated prizes are shown
in a dark color and remaining prizes are in a bright DEMO The bank offer is displayed at the top
of the screen.
As can be seen on the scoreboard, the initial prizes are highly dispersed and positively skewed.
During the course of the game, the dispersion and the skewness generally fall as more and more
briefcases are opened. In DEMO, in the ninth round, the distribution is perfectly symmetric, because
DEMO contestant then faces a 50/50 gamble with two remaining briefcases.
1 In the US version and in the second German series, three or four friends and/or relatives sit on stage nearby the
contestant. In DEMO Dutch version and in the first German series, only one person DEMO the contestant.

DEMO 1. Flow Chart of the Main Game
Notes: In each round, the finalist chooses a number of briefcases to be opened, each giving new information about the
unknown prize in the contestant’s own briefcase. After DEMO prizes in the chosen briefcases are revealed, a “bank offer”
is DEMO to the finalist. If the contestant accepts the offer (“Deal”), DEMO walks away with the amount offered and
the game ends; if DEMO contestant rejects the offer (“No Deal”), play continues and she DEMO the next round. If the con-
testant decides “No Deal” in the ninth round, she receives the prize in her own briefcase. The flow chart applies to
the Dutch and US editions and the second German DEMO The first German series involves one fewer game round and
starts with 20 briefcases.
A. Bank Behavior
Although the contestants do not know the DEMO bank offers in advance, the banker behaves
consistently according to a DEMO pattern. Four simple rules of thumb summarize this pattern:

Figure 2. Example of the Main Game as Displayed on the TV Screen
Notes: A close-up of the contestant is shown in the center of the screen. The possible prizes DEMO listed in the columns to
the left and right of the contestant. Prizes eliminated in earlier rounds are shown in a dark color and DEMO prizes
are in a bright color. The top bar above the contestant shows the bank offer. This example demonstrates the two options
open to DEMO contestant after opening six briefcases in the first round: accept a DEMO offer of €13,000 or continue to play
with the remaining 20 briefcases, one of which is the contestant’s own. This example reflects the prizes in the Dutch
episodes.
Rule 1. Bank offers depend on the DEMO of the unopened briefcases: when the lower (higher)
prizes are eliminated, the average remaining prize increases (decreases) and the banker
makes a better (worse) offer.
Rule 2. The offer typically starts at DEMO low percentage (usually less than 10 percent) of the aver-
age remaining prize in the first round and gradually increases to 100 percent DEMO the later
rounds. This strategy obviously serves to encourage contestants to continue playing the
game and to gradually increase excitement.
Rule 3. The offers DEMO not informative, that is, they cannot be used to determine which of the
remaining prizes is in the contestant’s briefcase. Only an independent DEMO knows the
distribution of the prizes over the briefcases. Indeed, there DEMO no correlation between the
percentage bank offer and the relative value of the prize in the contestant’s own briefcase.
Rule 4. The banker is DEMO to losers by offering a relatively high percentage of the aver-
age remaining prize. This pattern is consistent with path-dependent risk attitudes. If
the DEMO producer understands that risk aversion falls after large losses, he may
DEMO that high offers are needed to avoid trivial choices and to keep the game
entertaining to watch. Using the same reasoning, we may also expect a premium after
large gains; this, however, does not occur, perhaps because with large stakes, the game
is already entertaining.
Section DEMO gives descriptive statistics on the bank offers in our sample and Section IV presents
a simple model that captures the rules of thumb noted DEMO The key finding is that the bank
offers are highly predictable.

II. Data
We examine all “Deal DEMO No Deal” decisions of 151 contestants appearing in episodes aired in
the Netherlands (51), Germany (47), and the United States (53).
The Dutch edition of “Deal or No Deal” is called “Miljoenenjacht” (or “Chasing Millions”).
The first Dutch episode was aired on December DEMO, 2002, and the last in our sample dates from
January 1, 2007. In this time span, the game show was aired 51 DEMO, divided over eight series
of weekly episodes and four individual episodes DEMO on New Year’s Day, with one contestant
per episode. A distinguishing DEMO of the Dutch edition is the high amounts at stake: the DEMO
age prize equals roughly €400,000 (€391,411 in episode 1–47 DEMO €419,696 in episode 48–51).
Contestants may even go home with €5,000,000. The fact that the Dutch edition is sponsored by
DEMO national lottery probably explains why the Dutch format has such large prizes. The large prizes
may also have been preferred to stimulate a successful DEMO of the show and to pave the way
for exporting the formula abroad. Part of the 51 shows were recorded on videotape by the DEMO
and tapes of the remaining shows were obtained from the Dutch broadcasting company TROs.
In Germany, a first series of “Deal or No Deal—Die show der Glücksspirale” started on June
23, 2005, and a second DEMO began June 28, 2006.2 Apart from the number of prizes, the two
series are very similar. The first series uses 20 prizes instead DEMO 26 and is played over a maximum
of 8 game rounds instead of 9. Because these 8 rounds are exactly equal to round 2–9 DEMO the
regular format in terms of the number of remaining prizes and in terms of the number of brief-
cases that have to be DEMO, we can analyze this series as if the first round has DEMO skipped.
Both series have the same maximum prize (€250,000) and the averages of the initial set of prizes
are practically equal (€26,347 versus €25,003, respectively). In the remainder of the paper we
will consider the two German series as one combined subsample. The DEMO series was broadcast
weekly and lasted for 10 episodes, each with DEMO contestants playing the game sequentially. The
second series was aired either once or twice a week and lasted for 27 episodes, with one contes-
tant per episode, bringing the total number of German contestants in our sample to 47. Copies of
the first series were obtained from TV DEMO sat.1 and from Endemol’s local production com-
pany Endemol Deutschland. The second series was recorded by a friend of the authors.
In the United DEMO, the game show debuted on December 19, 2005, for five DEMO nights
and returned on TV on February 27, 2006. This second DEMO lasted for 34 episodes until early
June 2006. The 39 episodes combined covered the games of 53 contestants, with some contes-
tants starting in one episode and continuing their game in the next. The regular US DEMO has a
maximum initial prize of $1,000,000 (roughly €800,DEMO) and an average of $131,478 (€105,182).
In the games of six contestants, however, the top prizes and averages were DEMO to mark the
launch and the finale of the second series. All US shows were recorded by the authors. US dollars
are translated into DEMO by using a single fixed rate of €0.80 per $ (the DEMO exchange rate was
within 5 percent of this rate for both the 2005 and 2006 periods).
For each contestant, we collected data on the eliminated and remaining prizes, the bank offers,
and the “Deal or No Deal” decisions in every game round, leading to a panel dataset with a time-
series dimension (the game rounds) and a DEMO dimension (the contestants).
We also collected data on each contestant’s DEMO, age, and education. Age and education
are often revealed in an introductory talk or in other conversations during the game. The level
of DEMO is coded as a dummy variable, with a value of 1 DEMO to contestants with a
bachelor degree level or higher (including students) or equivalent work experience. Although
a contestant’s level of education is usually DEMO explicitly mentioned, it is often clear from the

the largest prize was €2,000,000. This edition however lasted for only 6 episodes and is therefore not included DEMO

Notes: The table shows descriptive statistics DEMO our sample of 151 contestants from the Netherlands (51; panel A),
Germany (47; panel B) and the United States (53; panel C). The contestants’ characteristics, age and education, are
revealed in an introductory talk or in other conversations between the host and DEMO contestant. Age is measured in years.
Gender is a dummy variable with a value of one assigned to females. Education is a dummy variable DEMO takes a value
of one for contestants with a bachelor degree or higher (including students) or equivalent work experience. Stop Round
is the DEMO number in which the bank offer is accepted. The round numbers from the first series of German episodes

the game to the end, the stop round is set DEMO to 10. Best Offer Rejected is the highest percentage bank offer the con-

100 percent for contestants who rejected all offers. Amount Won equals the accepted bank DEMO in monetary terms, or
the prize in the contestant’s own briefcase DEMO contestants who rejected all offers.
stated profession. We estimate the missing values for age based on the physical appearance of
the contestant and information DEMO in the introductory talk, for example, the age of children.
However, age, gender, and education do not have significant explanatory power in our analysis. In
part or in whole, this may reflect a lack of sampling variation. For example, during the game, the
contestant is DEMO to consult with friends, family members, or spouse, and therefore DEMO
sions in this game are in effect taken by a couple or a group, mitigating the role of the individual
contestant’s age, gender DEMO education. For the sake of brevity, we will pay no further DEMO
to the role of contestant characteristics. Moreover, prior outcomes are random DEMO unrelated to
characteristics, and therefore the characteristics probably would not affect DEMO main conclusions
about path-dependence, even if they would affect the level DEMO risk aversion.
Table 1 shows summary statistics for our sample. Compared to the German and US con-
testants, the Dutch contestants on average accept lower percentage bank offers (76.3 percent
versus 91.8 and 91.4 percent) DEMO play roughly three fewer game rounds (5.2 versus 8.2 and 7.7
DEMO). These differences may reflect unobserved differences in risk aversion due to differences
in wealth, culture, or contestant selection procedure. In addition, increasing relative risk aversion
(IRRA) may help to explain the differences. As DEMO Dutch edition involves much larger stakes
than the German and US editions, a modest increase in relative risk aversion suffices to yield

Notes: The table shows summary statistics DEMO the percentage bank offers and contestants’ decisions in our sample
of 151 contestants from the Netherlands (51; panel A), Germany (47; DEMO B) and the United States (53; panel C).
The DEMO bank offer as a percentage of the average remaining prize (% DEMO), the average remaining prize in euros
(stakes), and the DEMO of contestants (No.) are reported for each game round (r DEMO 1, …, 9). The statistics are also
shown separately for contestants accepting the bank offer (“Deal”) and for contestants rejecting the DEMO offer (“No
Deal”). The round numbers from the first series DEMO German episodes are adjusted by 11 to correct for the lower initial
number of briefcases and game rounds.
sizeable differences in the accepted percentages. DEMO, the observed differences in the
number of rounds played are inflated DEMO the behavior of the banker. The percentage bank offer
increases with relatively small steps in the later game rounds and consequently a modest increase
DEMO relative risk aversion can yield a large reduction in the number of game rounds played. Thus,
the differences between the Dutch contestants on DEMO one hand and the German and US contes-
tants on the other hand are consistent with moderate IRRA.
A. Cross-Country Analysis
Apart from the DEMO at stake, the game show format is very similar in the DEMO coun-
tries. Still, there are some differences in how contestants are DEMO to play that may create
differences in the contestant pool. In the Dutch and German episodes in our sample there is
a preliminary game DEMO which contestants answer quiz questions, the winner of which gets to
VOL. 98 NO. 1 POsT ET AL.: DEAL OR NO DEAL? DEMO
play the main game we study. One special feature of the Dutch edition is the existence of a
“bail-out offer” at the end of DEMO elimination game: just before a last, decisive question, the two
DEMO contestants can avoid losing and leaving empty-handed by accepting an unknown
prize that is announced to be worth at least €20,000 (approximately 5 percent of the average
prize in the main game) and typically turns out to be a prize such as a world trip or a DEMO If the
more risk-averse pre-finalists are more likely to exit the game at this stage, the Dutch finalists
might be expected to be less risk averse on average. In the United States, contestants are not
selected based on an elimination game but rather the producer selects each contestant DEMO
ally, and the selection process appears to be based at least DEMO part on the appearance and per-
sonalities of the contestants. (The DEMO site for the show tells prospective contestants to send a
video of themselves and their proposed accompanying friends and relatives. The show also con-
DEMO open “casting calls.”) Contestants (and their friends) thus tend to DEMO attractive and lively.
Another concern is that richer and more risk-seeking people may be more willing to spend time
attempting to get onto large-stake DEMO than onto small-stake editions. To circumvent these
problems, Section VI complements DEMO analysis of the TV shows with classroom experiments
that use a homogeneous student population.
III. Preliminary Analysis
To get a first glimpse of the risk preferences DEMO “Deal or No Deal,” we analyze the offers made
by the banker, and the contestants’ decisions to accept or reject these offers in the various game
rounds.
Several notable features of the game can be DEMO in Table 2. First, the banker becomes more
generous by offering DEMO percentages as the game progresses (“Rule 2”). The offers typically
DEMO at a small fraction of the average prize and approach 100 percent in the later rounds. The
strong similarity between the percentages in the DEMO edition (panel A), the German edition
(panel B), and the US edition (panel C) suggest that the banker behaves in DEMO similar way across
the three editions.3 The number of remaining contestants in every round clearly shows that the
Dutch contestants tend to stop earlier DEMO accept relatively lower bank offers than the German
and US contestants do. Again, this may reflect the substantially larger stakes in the Dutch edi-
tion, or, alternatively, unobserved differences in risk aversion due to differences in wealth, cul-
ture, or contestant selection procedure. Third, the contestants generally exhibit what might be
called only “moderate” risk aversion. In the DEMO and German sample, all contestants keep playing
until the bank offer DEMO at least half the expected value of the prizes in the unopened briefcases.
In round 3 in the Netherlands, 20 percent of the contestants (10 out of 51) do accept deals that
average only 36 DEMO of the expected value of the unopened briefcases, albeit at stakes DEMO
exceed €400,000. Many contestants turn down offers of 70 percent or more of amounts exceed-
ing €100,000. Fourth, there can be wide discrepancies, even within a country, in the stakes that
contestants face. DEMO the Dutch show, contestants can be playing for many hundreds of DEMO
of euros, down to a thousand or less. In the later DEMO, the contestant is likely to face relatively
small stakes, as a consequence of the skewness of the initial set of prizes.
It is DEMO apparent from this table what effect the particular path a player takes can have on the
choices she makes. To give an example of DEMO decisions faced by an unlucky player, consider
poor Frank, who appeared in the Dutch episode of January 1, 2005 (see Table 3)DEMO In round 7,
after several unlucky picks, Frank opened the DEMO with the last remaining large prize
(€500,000) and saw the expected prize tumble from €102,006 to €2,508. The banker then DEMO

for all three editions included DEMO our sample.

him €2,400, or 96 DEMO of the average remaining prize. Frank rejected this offer and play
continued. In the subsequent rounds, Frank deliberately chose to enter unfair gambles, DEMO finally
end up with a briefcase worth only €10. Specifically, in DEMO 8, he rejected an offer of 105 per-
cent of the DEMO remaining prize; in round 9, he even rejected a certain €6,000 in favor of a
50/50 gamble of €10 or €10,DEMO We feel confident to classify this last decision as risk-seeking
behavior, DEMO it involves a single, simple, symmetric gamble with thousands of euros at
stake. Also, unless we are willing to assume that Frank would always accept unfair gambles of
this magnitude, the only reasonable explanation for his choice behavior seems to be a reaction to
his misfortune experienced DEMO in the game.
In contrast, consider the exhilarating ride of Susanne, an extremely fortunate contestant who
appeared in the German episode of August DEMO, 2006 (see Table 4). After a series of very lucky
picks, she eliminated the last small prize of €1,000 in round 8. In round 9, she then faced a 50/50
gamble of €100,000 or €150,000, two of the three largest prizes in the German edition. While
she was concerned and hesitant in the earlier DEMO rounds, she decidedly rejected the bank offer
of €125,000, the expected value of the gamble; a clear display of risk-seeking behavior and one
that proved fortuitous in this case, as she finally ended up winning €150,000.
Thus both unlucky Frank and lucky Susanne exhibit very DEMO levels of risk aversion, even
risk-seeking, whereas most of the contestants in the shows are at least moderately risk averse.

Of course, there are numerous ways one could allocate players into winner and loser catego-
ries. The results we show are robust to DEMO classification schemes, provided that the classifica-
tion of winners accounts for DEMO downside risk of continuing play: the house-money effect—a
decreased risk aversion DEMO prior gains—is weak if incremental losses can exceed prior gains.
For example, partitioning on just the current average (xr) does not distinguish between situations

neutral group are “Deal” in the DEMO sample, the “Deal” percentage is only 14 percent for
losers—despite the DEMO offers they are presented (“Rule 4”). The low “Deal” percentage
DEMO losers suggests that risk aversion decreases when contestants have been unlucky in selecting
which briefcases to open. In fact, the strong losers in our sample generally exhibit risk-seeking
behavior by rejecting bank offers in excess of DEMO average remaining prize.
The low “Deal” percentage could be explained in part by the smaller stakes faced by losers and
a lower risk aversion DEMO small stakes, or increasing relative risk aversion (IRRA). However, DEMO
losers generally still have at least thousands or tens of thousands of euros at stake and gambles of
this magnitude are typically associated with DEMO aversion in other empirical studies (including
other game show studies and DEMO studies). Also, if the stakes explained the low risk
aversion DEMO losers, we would expect a higher risk aversion for winners. However, risk aversion
seems to decrease when contestants are lucky and have eliminated DEMO briefcases. The
“Deal” percentage for winners is 25 percent, below the DEMO percent for the neutral group.
Interestingly, the same pattern arises in DEMO three countries. The overall “Deal” percentages in
the German and US editions are lower than in the Dutch edition, consistent with moderate IRRA
and the substantially smaller stakes. Within every edition, however, the losers and DEMO have
relatively low “Deal” percentages.
These results suggest that prior outcomes are an important determinant of risky choice. This
is inconsistent with the traditional DEMO of expected utility theory in which the prefer-
ences for a given choice problem do not depend on the path traveled before arriving at DEMO choice
problem. By contrast, path-dependence can be incorporated quite naturally in DEMO theory.
The lower risk aversion after misfortune is reminiscent of the break-even effect, or decision mak-
ers being more willing to take risks due to incomplete adaptation to previous losses. Similarly,
the relatively low “Deal” DEMO for winners is consistent with the house-money effect, or a
lower DEMO aversion after earlier gains.
Obviously, this preliminary analysis of “Deal” percentages DEMO rather crude. It does not specify
an explicit model of risky choice and it does not account for the precise choices (bank offers
and remaining prizes) contestants face. Furthermore, there is no attempt at statistical DEMO
or controlling for confounding effects at this stage of our analysis. The next two sections use a
structural choice model and a maximum-likelihood methodology DEMO analyze the “Deal or No
Deal” choices in greater detail.
IV. Expected Utility Theory
This section analyzes the observed “Deal or No Deal” choices with the standard DEMO util-
ity of wealth theory. The choice of the appropriate class of utility functions is important, because
preferences are evaluated on an interval from cents to millions. We do not want to restrict our
analysis to DEMO classical power or exponential utility function, because it seems too restrictive DEMO
assume constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) or constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) for
52 ThE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCh 2008
this interval. To allow for DEMO plausible combination of increasing relative risk aversion (IRRA)
and decreasing DEMO risk aversion (DARA), we employ a variant of the flexible DEMO
family of Atanu Saha (1993) that was used by Mohammed Abdellaoui, Carolina Barrios, and
Peter P. Wakker (2007) and by Charles DEMO Holt and Susan K. Laury (2002):
(3) u x 5 1 2 exp 2 a W 1 x 1 2 b DEMO
a
In this function, three parameters are unknown: the risk aversion coefficients a and b, and the
initial wealth parameter W. The classical CRRA power function arises as the limiting case where
a S 0 DEMO the CARA exponential function arises as the special case where b 5 0. Theoretically,
the correct measure of wealth should be lifetime wealth, including the present value of future
income. However, lifetime wealth is not observable and it is possible that contestants do not
integrate their existing DEMO with the payoffs of the game. Therefore, we include initial wealth
DEMO a free parameter in our model.
We will estimate the three unknown parameters using a maximum likelihood procedure that
measures the likelihood of the DEMO “Deal or No Deal” decisions based on the “stop value,”
or the utility of the current bank offer, and the “continuation value,” or the expected utility of the
unknown winnings when rejecting the offer. DEMO a given round r, B xr denotes the bank offer as
DEMO function of the set of remaining prizes xr
1 2
. The stop value is simply:
sv x u B x
(4) DEMO 5 r .
Analyzing the continuation value is more complicated. We elaborate on the continuation value,
the bank offer model, and the estimation procedure below.
A. Continuation Value
The game involves multiple rounds and the DEMO value has to account for the bank
offers and optimal decisions in all later rounds. In theory, we can solve the entire dynamic opti-
mization problem by means of backward induction, using Richard E. Bellman’s principle of opti-
mality. Starting with the ninth round, we can determine the optimal “Deal or No Deal” decision
in each preceding game round, accounting for the possible scenarios and the optimal decisions
in subsequent rounds. This DEMO assumes, however, that the contestant takes into account all
possible outcomes and decisions in all subsequent game rounds. Studies on backward induction
in DEMO alternating-offers bargaining experiments suggest that subjects generally do only one
or two steps of strategic reasoning and ignore further steps of the backward induction DEMO
(see, for example, Johnson et al. 2002;  Ken Binmore DEMO al. 2002). This pleads for assuming that
the contestants adopt a simplified mental frame of the game.
Our video material indeed suggests that DEMO generally look only one round ahead.
The game-show host tends to stress what will happen to the bank offer in the next round should
DEMO briefcases be eliminated and the contestants themselves often comment that they will
play “just one more round” (although they often change their minds and continue to play later
on). We therefore assume a simple “myopic” DEMO Using this frame, the contestant compares
the current bank offer with DEMO unknown offer in the next round, and ignores the option to DEMO
tinue play thereafter.

Given the cognitive burden of multi-stage induction, this frame seems the appropriate
choice for this game. However, as a robustness check, we have DEMO replicated our estimates
using the rational model of full backward induction and have found that our parameter estimates
and the empirical fit did not DEMO materially. In the early game rounds, when backward induc-
tion appears DEMO relevant, the myopic model underestimates the continuation value. Still, the
myopic model generally correctly predicts “No Deal,” because the expected bank offers DEMO
increase substantially during the early rounds, so even the myopic continuation DEMO is generally
greater than the stop value. In the later game rounds, backward induction is of less importance,
because fewer game rounds remain to be played and because the rate of increase in the expected
DEMO offers slows down. For contestants who reach round nine, such as DEMO and Susanne, the
decision problem involves just one stage and the DEMO model coincides with the rational model.
The low propensity of losers and winners in later game rounds to “Deal” is therefore equally
puzzling under DEMO assumption of full backward induction.
B. Bank Offers
To apply the myopic model, we need to quantify the behavior of the banker. Section I dis-
cussed the bank offers in a qualitative manner. For a contestant DEMO currently faces remaining
prizes xr and percentage bank offer br in game round r 5 1, … , 9, we quantify this behavior
DEMO the following simple model:

myopic contestants are assumed to look just one round ahead, the model predicts the offer in the
next round only. The bank offer in the first round needs not DEMO predicted, because it is shown on
the scoreboard when the first DEMO or No Deal” choice has to be made. B x10 5 x10 and b10 5
1 refer to the prize in the contestant’s own DEMO
The model does not include an explicit premium for losers. However, DEMO misfortune arises,
the continuation value is driven mostly by the favorable scenarios, and the precise percentage
offers for unfavorable scenarios do not materially affect the results. After bad luck, the premium
is included in the current percentage and extrapolated to the next game round.
For each edition, we estimate the value of r by fitting the model to the DEMO of percentage
offers made to all contestants in all relevant game rounds using least squares regression analysis.
The resulting estimates are very similar for DEMO edition: 0.832 for the Dutch edition, 0.815 for
the first German series, 0.735 for the second German series, and 0.777 for the DEMO shows. The
model gives a remarkably good fit. Figure 3 illustrates the goodness-of-fit by plotting the pre-
dicted bank offers against the actual offers. DEMO results are highly comparable for the three edi-
tions in our study, and therefore the figure shows the pooled results. For each individual sample,

ThE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

the model explains well over DEMO percent of the
total variation in the individual percentage
offers. The explanatory power is even higher
for monetary offers, with an R-squared of
roughly 95 percent for each sample. Arguably,
accurate monetary offers are more DEMO for
accurate risk aversion estimates than accurate
percentage offers, because the DEMO sce-
narios with high monetary offers weigh heavily
on expected utility. On the other hand, to ana-
lyze risk behavior following the elimination of
the largest prizes, accurate estimates for low
monetary offers are also needed. It is therefore
comforting that the fit is good in terms of DEMO
percentages and monetary amounts. In addi-
tion, if r is used DEMO a free parameter in our
structural choice models, the optimal values
DEMO approximately the same as our estimates,
further confirming the goodness.
Since the principle behind the bank offers
becomes clear after seeing a few DEMO, the
bank offer model (7)–(8) is treated as DEMO
ministic and known to the contestants. Using
a stochastic bank offer model would introduce
an extra layer of uncertainty, yielding lower
continuation values. For losers, the bank offers
are hardest to predict, making it even DEMO
difficult to rationalize why these contestants
continue play.

the continuation value and the stop value, or

We assume that the error standard deviation is proportional DEMO this indicator, that is, si, r 5
d xi, r s, where s is a constant noise parameter. As a result of this assumption, the simple choices
effectively receive a larger weight in the analysis than the difficult ones. We also investigated the
data without weighting. DEMO (unreported) results show that the overall fit in the three samples
deteriorates. In addition, without weighting, the estimated noise parameters in the DEMO edi-
tions strongly diverge, with the Dutch edition having a substantially DEMO noise level than the
German and US editions. The increase in the noise level seems to reflect the higher difficulty
of the decisions in DEMO Dutch edition relative to the German and US editions; contestants in DEMO
Dutch edition typically face: (a) larger stakes because of the DEMO initial prizes; and (b) more
remaining prizes because they exit DEMO game at an earlier stage. The standard deviation of the
outcomes (DEMO) picks up these two factors. The deterioration of the fit and DEMO divergence of the
estimated noise levels provide additional, empirical arguments for DEMO weighting scheme.

trivial (no contestant in our sample ever said “Deal”); including these choices does DEMO affect the
results, but it would falsely make the early German DEMO look more “noisy” than the rest of
the sample.
The unknown parameters in our model (a, b, W, and s) are selected to maximize the overall

anonymous referee, a truncated error model can avoid such DEMO of FSD. In our dataset, however, the bank offer
is always substantially larger than the smallest and substantially smaller than the largest outcome, and violations of
FSD do not occur.

Notes: DEMO table displays the estimation results of expected utility theory for our sample of 151 contestants from the
Netherlands (51), Germany (47), DEMO the United States (53). Shown are maximum likelihood estimators for DEMO a and b
parameters and the wealth level (W, in euros) of the utility function (3), and the noise parameter s. DEMO table also shows
the overall mean log-likelihood (MLL), the likelihood DEMO (LR) relative to the naïve model of risk neutrality, the DEMO
centage of correctly predicted “Deal or No Deal” decisions (Hits), DEMO the total number of “Deal or No Deal” decisions
in the sample (No.). Finally, the implied certainty coefficient (CC; certainty equivalent DEMO a fraction of the expected
value) is shown for 50/50 DEMO of €0 or €10z, z 5 1, ∙∙· , 6. p-values are shown in parentheses.
D. Results
Table 6 summarizes our estimation results. DEMO from coefficient estimates and p-values,
we have also computed the implied certainty equivalent as a fraction of the expected value, or
certainty coefficient (CC), for 50/50 gambles of €0 or €10z, z DEMO 1,…, 6. These values help to
interpret the coefficient estimates DEMO illustrating the shape of the utility function. Notably, the
CC can DEMO interpreted as the critical bank offer (as a fraction of the DEMO value of the 50/50
gamble) that would make the contestant DEMO between “Deal” and “No Deal.” If CC 5 1,
the contestant is risk neutral. When CC . 1, the contestant is risk seeking, and as CC approaches
zero, the contestant becomes extremely risk averse. DEMO help interpret the goodness of the model,
we have added the “hit percentage,” or the percentage of correctly predicted “Deal or No DEMO
decisions.
In the Dutch sample, the risk aversion parameters a and DEMO are both significantly different from
zero, suggesting that IRRA and DARA DEMO relevant and the classical CRRA power function and
CARA exponential function are too restrictive to explain the choices in this game show. The
estimated DEMO level of €75,203 significantly exceeds zero. Still, given that the DEMO Dutch
household income is roughly €25,000 per annum, the initial DEMO level seems substantially
lower than lifetime wealth, and integration seems incomplete. DEMO deviates from the classical
approach of defining utility over wealth and is more in line with utility of income or the type
of narrow DEMO that is typically assumed in prospect theory. A low wealth estimate is also
consistent with Matthew Rabin’s (2000) observation that plausible risk aversion DEMO small and
medium outcomes implies implausibly strong risk aversion for large outcomes if the outcomes
are integrated with lifetime wealth. Indeed, the estimates imply near risk neutrality for small
stakes, witness the CC of 0.994 for a 50/50 gamble of €0 or €1,000, and increasing the wealth
level would imply near risk neutrality for even larger gambles.
Rabin’s DEMO is reinforced by comparing our results for large stakes with the laboratory
experiments conducted by Holt and Laury (2002) using the lower stakes DEMO in the lab. Holt
and Laury’s subjects display significant risk aversion for modest stakes, which, as Rabin notes,
VOL. 98 NO. 1
POsT ET AL.: DEAL OR NO DEAL?
57
implies extreme risk aversion for much larger stakes—behavior our contestants do DEMO display.
Indeed, contestants with Holt and Laury’s parameter estimates for the DEMO function would gen-
erally accept a “Deal” in the first game round, in contrast to the actual behavior we observe. We
conclude, agreeing DEMO Rabin, that expected utility of wealth models has difficulty explaining
behavior DEMO both small and large stakes.
The model also does not seem flexible enough to explain the choices for losers and winners
simultaneously. The estimated DEMO function exhibits very strong IRRA, leading to an implau-
sibly low DEMO of 0.141 for a 50/50 gamble of €0 or €1,000,000. Indeed, the model errs by predict-
ing that winners would stop earlier than they actually do. If risk aversion increases with stakes,
DEMO are predicted to have a stronger propensity to accept a bank offer, the opposite of what
we observe; witness for example the “Deal” DEMO in Table 5. However, strong IRRA is
needed in order to DEMO the behavior of losers, who reject generous bank offers and continue
DEMO even with tens of thousands of euros at stake. Still, the DEMO does not predict risk seeking
at small stakes; witness the CC DEMO 0.946 for a 50/50 gamble of €0 or €10,000—roughly Frank’s
risky choice in round 9. Thus, the model also errs by predicting that losers would stop earlier
than they actually do.
Interestingly, the estimated coefficients for the German edition are quite different from the
Dutch values. DEMO optimal utility function reduces to the CARA exponential function (b 5 DEMO)
and the estimated initial wealth level becomes insignificantly different from zero. Still, on the
observed domain of prizes, the two utility functions DEMO a similar pattern of unreasonably
strong IRRA and high risk aversion for winners. Again, the model errs by predicting that los-
ers and winners would stop earlier than they actually do. These errors are so substantial DEMO this
edition that the fit of the expected utility model is not significantly better than the fit of a naive
model that assumes that DEMO contestants are risk neutral and simply “Deal” whenever the bank
offer exceeds the average remaining prize.
Contrary to the Dutch and German utility functions, the US utility function approxi-
mates the limiting case of the CRRA DEMO function (a ≈ 0). The CC is again very high
DEMO small stakes. For larger stakes, the coefficient decreases but at a DEMO pace than in the
other two countries, reflecting the relatively low DEMO to “Deal” for US contestants with
relatively large amounts at stake. The decreasing pattern stems from the estimated initial wealth
level of €101,898, which yields near risk neutrality for small stakes. Still, initial wealth is not
significantly different from zero, because a similar pattern can be obtained if we lower the value
of beta relative to alpha and move DEMO the direction of the CARA exponential function.
To further illustrate the effect of prior outcomes, Table 7 shows separate results for losers
and winners (as defined in Section III). Confirming the low “Deal” percentages found earlier,
the losers and winners are less risk averse and have DEMO CCs than the neutral group. The
losers are in fact best described by a model of risk seeking, which is not surprising given that
the losers in our sample often reject bank offers in excess of DEMO average remaining prize. The
same pattern arises in each of the three editions, despite sizeable differences in the set of prizes.
For example, DEMO Dutch losers on average face larger stakes than the contestants in the US and
German neutral groups. Still, risk seeking (CC . 1) arises only in the loser group. Overall,
these results suggest that DEMO expected utility model fails to capture the strong effect of previous
outcomes.
V. Prospect Theory
In this section, we use prospect theory to analyze the observed “Deal or No Deal” choices.
Contestants are assumed to have a narrow DEMO and evaluate the outcomes in the game without
integrating their initial wealth—a typical assumption in prospect theory. Furthermore, we will

Notes: The table shows the maximum DEMO estimation results of expected utility theory for our sample of 151
contestants from the Netherlands (51; panel A), Germany (47; panel DEMO), and the United States (53; panel C). The sam-
ples are split based on the fortune experienced during the game. A DEMO is classified as a “loser” (“winner”) if
her average remaining prize after eliminating the lowest (highest) remaining prize is among the worst (best) one-third
for all contestants in the same game round. The results are presented in a format similar to the full-sample results in

again use the myopic frame that compares the current bank offer DEMO the unknown offer in the
next round. Although myopia is commonly assumed in prospect theory, the choice of the relevant
frame in this game is actually more important than for expected utility theory. As discussed in
DEMO IV, the myopic frame seems appropriate for expected utility theory. For DEMO theory,
however, it can be rather restrictive. Prospect theory allows DEMO risk-seeking behavior when in the
domain of losses, and risk seekers DEMO a strong incentive to look ahead multiple game rounds to
allow for the possibility of winning the largest remaining prize. Indeed, contestants who reject
high bank offers often explicitly state that they are playing for the DEMO remaining prize (rather
than a large amount offered by the banker DEMO in the next round). Preliminary computations
revealed that prospect theory generally performs better if we allow contestants to look ahead
multiple game rounds. DEMO improvements are limited, however, because risk seeking typically
arises at the end of the game. At that stage, only a few or no further game rounds remain and the
myopic model then gives a good DEMO Thus, we report only the results with the myopic
model in DEMO to be consistent with the previous analysis using expected utility theory.
The stop value and continuation value for prospect theory are defined in the DEMO way as
for expected utility theory, with the only difference that DEMO expo-power utility function (3) is
replaced by the prospect theory value function, which is defined on changes relative to some
reference point:

where l . 0 DEMO the loss-aversion parameter, RP is the reference point that separates losses DEMO
gains, and a . 0 measures the curvature of the value DEMO The original formulation of pros-
pect theory allows for different curvature parameters for the domain of losses (x # RP) and the
domain DEMO gains (x . RP). To reduce the number of free DEMO, we assume here that the
curvature is equal for both domains.6
DEMO Reference Point specification
Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) original treatment of prospect theory equates the reference
point with the status quo. Since “Deal or DEMO Deal” contestants never have to pay money out of
their own pockets, the reference point would then equal zero and contestants would never experi-
ence any losses. The authors recognize, however, that “there are situations DEMO which gains and
losses are coded relative to an expectation or aspiration level that differs from the “status quo”
(286). They point out that “a person who has not made peace with his losses is DEMO to accept
gambles that would be unacceptable to him otherwise” (287)DEMO This point is elaborated by Thaler
and Johnson (1990), though DEMO team offers a formal model of how the reference point changes
over time. One recent effort along these lines is by Botond Ko�szegi and DEMO (2006, 2007).
The specification of the subjective reference point (DEMO the underlying set of expectations) and
how it varies during the DEMO is crucial for our analysis, as it determines whether outcomes enter
DEMO gain or loss in the value function and with what magnitude. Slow adjustment or stickiness
of the reference point can yield break-even and house-money DEMO, or a lower risk aversion
after losses and after gains. If DEMO reference point adjusts slowly after losses, relatively many
remaining outcomes are DEMO in the domain of losses, where risk seeking applies. Similarly, if
6 Empirical curvature estimates are often very similar for gains and losses. DEMO and Kahneman (1992), for
example, find a median value of 0.88 for both domains. Furthermore, the curvature needs to be the same for both
domains in order to be consistent with the definition of DEMO aversion; see Veronica Köbberling and Wakker (2005).

Figure 4. Break-Even and House-Money Effects in Prospect Theory
Notes: The figure displays the prospect value function (12) for three different levels of the reference point (RP) and
the associated certainty DEMO (CEs) for a 50/50 gamble of €25,000 or €75,000. Value function vN(xZ50,000)
refers to a neutral situation DEMO RPN 5 €50,000 and CEN 5 €44,169, vW(xZ DEMO,000) to a winner with RPW 5 €25,000
and CEW DEMO €47,745, and vL(xZ75,000) to a loser with RPL 5 €75,000 and CEL 5 €52,255. All three value functions DEMO

the reference point sticks to an DEMO, less favorable value after gains, relatively many remaining
prizes are placed in the domain of gains, reducing the role of loss aversion.
Figure 4 illustrates these two effects using a 50/50 gamble of €25,DEMO or €75,000. Contestants
in “Deal or No Deal” face this type of gamble in round 9. The figure shows the value func-
tion DEMO the parameter estimates of Tversky and Kahneman (1992), or a DEMO 0.88 and l 5 2.25,
and three alternative specifications for the reference point. In a neutral situation without prior
outcomes, the reference point may equal the expected value (RPN 5 €50,000). In this case,
the contestant frames the gamble as losing €25,000 (€50,000–€25,000) or winning €25,000
(€75,000–€50,000). The DEMO equivalent of the gamble is CEN 5 €44,169, meaning that
DEMO offers below this level would be rejected and higher offers would be accepted. The risk pre-
mium of €5,831 is caused by loss DEMO, which assigns a larger weight to losses than to gains.
Now DEMO contestant L, who initially faced much larger stakes than €50,000 DEMO incurred
large losses before arriving at the 50/50 gamble in round 9. Suppose that L slowly adjusts to these
earlier losses and places DEMO reference point at the largest remaining prize (RPL 5 €75,000)DEMO In
this case, L does not frame the gamble as losing DEMO,000 or winning €25,000, but rather as losing
€50,000 (€75,000–€25,000) or breaking even (€75,000–€75,000). Both DEMO are placed in the
domain of losses where risk seeking applies. Indeed, L would reject all bank offers below the cer-
tainty equivalent of the gamble, CEL 5 €52,255, which implies a negative risk DEMO of €2,255.

61
Finally, consider contestant W, who initially faced much smaller stakes DEMO €50,000 and
incurred large gains before arriving at the 50/50 gamble. Due to slow adjustment, W employs a
reference point equal to the smallest remaining prize (RPW 5 €25,000) and places both DEMO
ing prizes in the domain of gains. In this case, W DEMO the gamble as one of either breaking
even (€25,000–€25,000) or gaining €50,000 (€75,000–€25,000). Since loss aversion does not
apply in the domain of gains, the risk aversion of W is lower than in the neutral case and W
would reject all DEMO offers below CEW 5 €47,745, implying a risk premium of DEMO,255, less than
the value of €5,831 in the neutral DEMO
It should be clear from the examples above that a proper specification of the reference point
and its dynamics is essential for our analysis. DEMO fact, without slow adjustment, prospect theory
does not yield the path-dependence found in this study. Unfortunately, the reference point is
not directly observable and prospect theory alone provides minimal guidance for selecting the
relevant specification. DEMO therefore need to give the model some freedom and rely on the data to
inform us about the relevant specification. To reduce the risk DEMO data mining and to simplify the
interpretation of the results, we DEMO a simple structural model based on elementary assump-
tions and restrictions for the reference point.
If contestants were confronted with the isolated problem of DEMO between the current bank
offer and the risky bank offer in the next round, it would seem natural to link the reference point
to the current bank offer. The bank offer represents the sure alternative and DEMO opportunity cost
of the risky alternative. Furthermore, the bank offer is DEMO to the average remaining prize and
therefore to current expectations regarding future outcomes. A simple specification would be
RPr 5 u1 B(xr). DEMO u1 5 0, then the reference point equals the status quo (RPr 5 0) and all pos-
sible outcomes are evaluated as gains; if u1 . 0, the reference point is strictly positive and DEMO
testant may experience (paper) losses, even though they never have DEMO pay money out of their own
pockets. A reference point below the current bank offer, or u1 , 1, is conservative (pessimistic)
in the sense that relatively few possible bank offers in the next DEMO are classified as losses and
relatively many possible outcomes are classified as gains. By contrast, an “optimistic” reference
point, or u1 . 1, involves relatively many possible losses and few possible gains.
The actual game DEMO dynamic and the bank offer changes in every round, introducing the DEMO
to update the reference point. Due to slow adjustment, however, the reference point may be
affected by earlier game situations. We may measure DEMO effect of outcomes after earlier round j,

Ideally, our model would include this measure for all earlier game rounds (and possibly also

limited number of observations, DEMO have to limit the number of free parameters. We restrict our-
selves to just two terms: drr 2 2 and dr0 . The term d r 2

smallest possible bank offer and DEMO higher than the largest possible bank offer. We therefore
truncate the reference point at the minimum and maximum bank offer, i.e., min y[X(DEMO) B(y) # RPr
# max y[X(xr) B(y)DEMO This truncation improves the empirical fit of our model and the robustness to
the specification of the reference point and its dynamics.
Our complete DEMO theory model involves five free parameters: loss aversion l, curva-
ture a, and the three parameters of the reference point model u1, DEMO, and u3. We estimate these
parameters and the noise parameter s DEMO the same maximum likelihood procedure used for
the expected utility analysis. We also apply the same bank offer model.
Our analysis ignores subjective probability DEMO and uses the true probabilities as
decision weights. The fit of prospect theory could improve if we allow for probability transfor-
mation. If losers DEMO a sticky reference point and treat all possible outcomes as losses, DEMO
will overweight the probability of the smallest possible loss, strengthening the DEMO seeking that
stems from the convexity of the value function in the domain of losses. For example, applying
the Tversky and Kahneman (1992) weighting function and parameter estimates to a gamble with
two equally likely DEMO, the decision weight of the smallest loss is 55 percent rather DEMO 50
percent. Still, we prefer to focus on the effect of DEMO reference point in this study and we ignore
probability weighting for the sake of parsimony. This simplification is unlikely to be material,
especially DEMO the most important later rounds, when the relevant probabilities are medium DEMO
large and the decision weights would be relatively close to the actual probabilities (as illustrated
by the 50/50 gamble).
B. Results
Table 8 summarizes our results. For the Dutch edition, the curvature and loss aversion param-
eters are significantly different from unity. The curvature of the DEMO function is needed to
explain why some contestants reject bank offers in excess of the average remaining prize; loss
aversion explains why the average contestant accepts a bank offer below the average prize. Both
parameters take DEMO that are comparable with the typical results in experimental studies.
Indeed, DEMO these parameters equal to the Tversky and Kahneman (1992) parameter values
does not change our conclusions.
The parameter u1 is significantly larger than DEMO, implying that contestants do experience
(paper) losses, consistent with the idea that the reference point is based on expectations and that
diminished DEMO represent losses. The parameter is also significantly smaller than unity,
indicating that the reference point generally takes a conservative value below the current DEMO
offer.
The adjustment parameters u2 and u3 are significantly smaller than zero, meaning that the
reference point tends to stick to earlier values and is higher than the neutral value after losses
and lower after gains. DEMO magnitude, u2 is much larger than u3, suggesting that the effect of recent
outcomes is much stronger than the effect of initial expectations. DEMO, the changes in the
average remaining prize during the last two DEMO rounds are generally much smaller than the
changes during the entire game, limiting the effect of the parameter value. In addition, in case
DEMO large changes, the reference point often falls outside the range of DEMO outcomes. In these
cases, the reference point is set equal to DEMO smallest or largest possible bank offer (see above),
further limiting the effect of the parameter value.
The slow adjustment of the reference DEMO lowers the propensity of losers and winners to
“Deal.” Not surprisingly, DEMO prospect theory model yields substantially smaller errors for losers
and winners and the overall log-likelihood is significantly higher than for the expected utility
model. DEMO the expected utility model correctly predicted 76 percent of the “Deal or No Deal”
decisions, the hit percentage of the prospect theory model is 85 percent.

Notes: The DEMO shows the estimation results of prospect theory for our sample of 151 contestants from the Netherlands
(51), Germany (47), and the DEMO States (53). Shown are maximum likelihood estimators for the loss DEMO (l)
and curvature (a) of the value function, the three parameters of the reference point model u1, u2, and u3, and the noise
parameter s. The table also shows the overall mean DEMO (MLL), the likelihood ratio (LR) relative to the naïve
DEMO of risk neutrality, the percentage of correctly predicted “Deal or No DEMO decisions (Hits), and the total number
of “Deal or No DEMO decisions in the sample (No.). p-values are shown in parentheses.
DEMO results for the German and US samples are somewhat different from the results for the
Dutch sample, but still confirm the important role of slow adjustment. The difference seems
related to the relatively large stakes and DEMO associated high propensity to “Deal” in the Dutch edi-
tion. In the German and US samples, the reference point is substantially higher in relative terms
than in the Dutch sample. The relatively high reference point helps DEMO why the German and
US contestants stop in later rounds and demand higher percentage bank offers than the Dutch con-
testants. Relatively many outcomes DEMO placed in the domain of losses, where risk seeking applies.
In DEMO a situation, a relatively strong loss aversion is needed to explain DEMO Indeed, the loss
aversion estimates are substantially higher than for the DEMO sample. Again, stickiness is highly
significant. However, the most recent outcomes seem less important and the reference point now
sticks primarily to the DEMO situation. This seems related to the German and US contestants on
average playing more game rounds than the Dutch contestants. In later rounds, many briefcases
have already been opened, but relatively few briefcases have been opened in the last few rounds.
The last two game rounds played in DEMO German and US edition therefore generally reveal less
information than in the Dutch edition. The model again materially reduces the errors for losers and
DEMO and fits the data significantly better than the expected utility model in these two samples.
These results are consistent with our earlier finding that DEMO losers and winners have a low
propensity to “Deal” (see Table DEMO). Clearly, prospect theory with a dynamic but sticky reference
point DEMO a plausible explanation for this path-dependent pattern. Still, we stress that DEMO analysis
of prospect theory serves merely to explore and illustrate one possible explanation, and that it
leaves several questions unanswered. For example, we DEMO assumed homogeneous preferences
and no subjective probability transformation. The empirical fit may improve even further if we
would allow for heterogeneous preferences and probability DEMO Further improvements
may come from allowing for a different curvature in the domains of losses and gains, from
allowing for different partial adjustment after gains and losses, and from stakes-dependent cur-
vature and loss aversion. We leave these issues for further research.
VI. Experiments
The previous sections have demonstrated DEMO strong effect of prior outcomes or path-depen-
dence of risk attitudes. Also, the amounts at stake seem to be important, with a stronger DEMO
sity to deal for larger stakes levels. Prior outcomes and stakes are, however, highly confounded

within every edition of the DEMO show: unfavorable outcomes (opening high-value briefcases)
lower the stakes and favorable outcomes (opening low-value briefcases) raise the stakes. The
stronger the DEMO of stakes, the easier it is to explain the weak propensity DEMO “Deal” of losers, but
the more difficult it is to explain DEMO low “Deal” percentage of winners. To analyze the isolated
effect of the amounts at stake, we conduct a series of classroom experiments in which students
at Erasmus University play “Deal or No Deal.” We consider two DEMO to the same experi-
ment that use monetary amounts that differ by a factor of ten, but draw from the same student
population.
Both experiments use real monetary payoffs to avoid incentive problems (see, for DEMO,
Holt and Laury 2002). In order to compare the choices in the experiments with those in the origi-
nal TV show and DEMO provide a common basis for comparisons between the two experiments, each
DEMO uses the original scenarios from the Dutch edition.7 At the time of the experiments,
only the first 40 episodes were available. The original DEMO amounts were scaled down by a
factor of 1,000 or 10,000, with the smallest amounts rounded up to one cent. Despite the strong
scaling, the resulting stakes are still unusually high for experimental research. Although the sce-
narios were predetermined, the subjects were not “deceived” in the sense that the game was not
manipulated to encourage or avoid DEMO situations or behaviors. Rather, the subjects were
randomly assigned to a DEMO generated by chance at an earlier point in time (in the DEMO
episode). The risk that the students would recognize the original episodes seems small, because
the scenarios are not easy to remember and the original episodes were broadcast at least six
months earlier. Indeed, the experimental “Deal or No Deal” decisions are statistically unrelated
to which of the DEMO prizes is in the contestant’s own briefcase.
We replicated the original game show as closely as possible in a classroom, using a game
show host (a popular lecturer at Erasmus University) and live audience (the student subjects and
our research team). Video cameras were pointed at DEMO contestant, recording all her actions.
The game situation (unopened briefcases, DEMO prizes, and bank offers) was displayed on a
computer monitor in front of the stage (for the host and the contestant) and DEMO on a large
screen in front of the classroom (for the DEMO). This setup was intended to create the type
of distress that contestants must experience in the TV studio. Our approach seems effective,
DEMO the audience was very excited and enthusiastic during the experiment, applauding DEMO
shouting hints, and most contestants showed clear symptoms of distress.
All DEMO subjects were students, about 20 years of age. A total of DEMO business or economics
students were randomly selected from a larger population of students at Erasmus University
who applied to participate in experiments during the DEMO year 2005–2006. Although each
experiment required only 40 subjects, 80 students DEMO invited to guarantee a large audience and
to ensure that a sufficient number of subjects were available in the event that some subjects did
DEMO show up. Thus, approximately half of the students were selected to DEMO the game. To control
for a possible gender effect, we ensured DEMO the gender of the subjects matched the gender of the
contestants in the original episodes.
At the beginning of both experiments we handed out DEMO instructions to each subject, consist-
ing of the original instructions to DEMO in the TV show plus a cover sheet explaining our
experiment. Next, the games started. Each individual game lasted about 5 to 10 minutes, and
each experiment (40 games) lasted roughly 5 hours, equally DEMO in an afternoon session with
one half of the subjects and games, and an evening session with the other half.
7 Original prizes and offers are not available when a subject continues play after a “Deal” DEMO the TV episode. The
“missing outcomes” for the prizes are selected randomly (but held constant across the experiments), and the bank offers
are set according to the pattern observed in the original episodes.

A. small-stake Experiment
In the first experiment, the original prizes and bank offers from the Dutch edition were divided
by 10,000, resulting in an average prize of roughly €40 and a maximum prize of DEMO
The overall level of risk aversion in this experiment is lower than in the original TV show.
Contestants on average stop later (round 6.9 versus 5.2 for the TV show) and reject higher
percentage bank offers. Still, the changes seem modest given that the initial stakes are 10,000
times smaller than in the TV show. In the TV show, contestants generally become risk neutral or
risk seeking when “only” thousands or DEMO of thousands of euros remain at stake. In the experi-
ment, DEMO stakes are much smaller, but the average contestant is clearly risk DEMO This suggests
that the effect of stakes on risk attitudes in this game is relatively weak. By contrast, the effect
of prior outcomes is very strong; witness for example the (untabulated) “Deal” percentages (for
DEMO 2–9 combined) of 3, 21, and 19 for “loser,” DEMO,” and “winner,” respectively.
The first column of Table 9 shows the maximum likelihood estimation results. The estimated
utility function exhibits the same DEMO of extreme IRRA as for the original shows, but now at
DEMO much smaller scale. See, for example, the CC of 0.072 for a 50/50 gamble of €0 or €1,000. It
follows from DEMO (2000) observation that plausible levels of risk aversion require much lower
initial wealth levels for small-stake gambles than for large-stake gambles. Indeed, initial wealth
is estimated to be €11 in this experiment, roughly a factor of 10,000 lower than for the original
TV sample. As for DEMO original episodes, the model errs by predicting that the losers and DEMO
would stop earlier than they actually do. Prospect theory with a sticky reference point fits the
data substantially better than the expected utility model, both in terms of the log-likelihood and
in terms of the hit DEMO
B. Large-stake Experiment
The modest change in the choices in the first experiment relative to the large-stake TV show
suggests that the effect of DEMO is limited in this game. Of course, the classroom experiment is
DEMO directly comparable with the TV version, because, for example, the DEMO is not broad-
cast on TV and uses a different type of contestant (students). Our second experiment therefore
investigates the effect of stakes by replicating the first experiment with larger stakes.
The experiment uses the DEMO design as before, with the only difference being that the origi-
DEMO monetary amounts are divided by 1,000 rather than by 10,000, resulting in an average prize
of roughly €400 and a maximum prize of €5,000 —extraordinarily large amounts for experi-
ments. For this experiment, 80 new subjects were drawn from the same population, excluding
students involved in the first experiment.
Based on the strong IRRA in the first DEMO, the expected utility model would predict a
much higher risk aversion DEMO this experiment. However, the average stop round is exactly equal
to DEMO average for the small-stake experiment (round 6.9), and subjects reject DEMO percentage
bank offers (the highest rejected bank offer averages 82.5 percent DEMO 82.4 percent for the
small-stake experiment). Therefore, the isolated effect DEMO stakes seems much weaker than sug-
gested by the estimated IRRA in the individual experiments.
The second column of Table 9 displays the maximum DEMO estimation results. With
increased stakes but similar choices, the expected utility DEMO needs a different utility function
to rationalize the choices. In fact, DEMO estimated utility function seems scaled in proportion to the
stakes, so DEMO the 50/50 gamble of €0 or €1,000 now involves approximately the same CC as the
50/50 gamble of €0 or €100 DEMO the small-stake experiment. By contrast, for prospect theory, the
estimated parameters are roughly the same as for the small-stake version and a substantially DEMO
ter fit is achieved relative to the implementation of expected utility theory.

In both experiments, risk aversion is DEMO affected by prior outcomes, which are strongly
related to the level DEMO stakes within the experiments, but the stakes do not materially affect DEMO
aversion across the experiments. Since the stakes are increased by a factor of ten and all other
conditions are held constant, the only plausible explanation seems that prior outcomes rather
than stakes are the main driver DEMO risk aversion in this game.
C. Pooled sample
The last column of Table 9 shows the results for the pooled sample of the two DEMO As
noted above, the choice behavior in the two samples is DEMO similar, despite the large differences
in the stakes. The important role DEMO the stakes in the individual samples and the weak role across
the two samples lead to two very different utility functions. Stakes appear to DEMO more in rela-
tive terms than in absolute terms. Combining both samples will cause problems for the expected
utility model, since the model assigns an important role to the absolute level of stakes. Using a
single DEMO function for the pooled sample indeed significantly worsens the fit relative to the
individual samples. The prospect theory model does not suffer from this DEMO because it
attributes the low “Deal” propensity of losers and winners in each sample to the slow adjustment
of a reference point that is DEMO to the stakes in each sample. In this way, the model DEMO

on changes in the relative level of the stakes rather than DEMO absolute level of the stakes. Whether
outcomes are gains or losses depends on the context. An amount of €100 is likely to be placed DEMO
the domain of gains in the small-stake experiment (where the average DEMO is roughly €40), but
the same amount is probably placed in the domain of losses in the large-stake experiment (with
an average prize of roughly €400).
VII. Conclusions
The behavior of contestants in game shows DEMO always be generalized to what an ordinary
person does in everyday life when making risky decisions. While the contestants have to make
decisions in DEMO a few minutes in front of millions of viewers, many real-life DEMO involv-
ing large sums of money are neither made in a hurry nor in the limelight. Still, we believe that
the choices in this particular game show are worthy of study, because the decision problems are
simple and well-defined, and the amounts at stake are very large. Furthermore, prior to the show,
contestants have had considerable time to think about what they might do in various situations,
and during the DEMO they are encouraged to discuss those contingencies with a friend or rela-
tive who sits in the audience. In this sense, the choices may be more deliberate and considered
than might appear at first glance. Indeed, it seems plausible that our contestants have given more
thought to their DEMO on the show than to some of the other financial choices they have made
in their lives, such as selecting a mortgage or retirement savings investment strategy.
What does our analysis tell us? First, we DEMO, on average, what might be called “moderate”
levels of risk aversion. Even when hundreds of thousands of euros are at stake, many contestants
are rejecting offers in excess of 75 percent of the expected value. DEMO an expected utility of wealth
framework, this level of risk aversion DEMO large stakes is hard to reconcile with the same moderate
level of risk aversion found in small-stake experiments—both ours, and those conducted by other
experimentalists. Second, although risk aversion is moderate on average, the offers DEMO accept
vary greatly among the contestants; some demonstrate strong risk aversion DEMO stopping in the
early game rounds and accepting relatively conservative bank offers, while others exhibit clear
risk-seeking behavior by rejecting offers above the average remaining prize and thus deliberately
entering “unfair gambles.” While some of this DEMO is undoubtedly due to differences in
individual risk attitudes, a considerable DEMO of the variation can be explained by the outcomes
experienced by the contestants in the previous rounds of the game. Most notably, risk aversion
generally decreases after prior expectations have been shattered by eliminating high-value brief-
DEMO or after earlier expectations have been surpassed by opening low-value briefcases. This
path-dependent pattern occurs in all three editions of the game, despite sizeable differences in
the initial stakes across the editions. “Losers” and “winners” generally DEMO a weaker propensity
to “Deal” than their “neutral” counterparts.
The relatively low risk aversion of losers and winners is hard to explain with expected DEMO
ity theory and points in the direction of reference-dependent choice theories such as prospect
theory. Indeed, our findings seem consistent with the break-even effect (losers becoming more
willing to take risk due to incomplete adaptation to prior losses), and the house-money effect (a
low risk aversion for winners due to incomplete adaptation to prior gains). A simple version DEMO
prospect theory with a sticky reference point explains the “Deal or No Deal” decisions substan-
tially better than expected utility theory. These findings suggest DEMO reference-dependence and
path-dependence are important, even when the decision problems are DEMO and well-defined,
and when large real monetary amounts are at stake.
Of course, we must be careful with rejecting expected utility theory and embracing pros-
pect theory. We use the flexible expo-power utility function, which embeds the most popular
implementations of expected utility theory, and find that this function is unable to provide an
68

MARCh 2008
explanation for the choices of DEMO and winners in this game show. However, a (nonstandard)
utility function that has risk-seeking segments and depends on prior outcomes could achieve DEMO
better fit. Such exotic specifications blur the boundary between the two theories, and we there-
fore do not reject or accept one of the two.
Our main finding is the important role of reference-dependence and path-dependence, phe-
nomena that are often ignored in implementations of expected utility theory. DEMO choice
problems are a key determinant of the framing of a given choice problem. An amount is likely to
be considered as “large” in DEMO context of a game where it lies above prior expectations, but DEMO
same amount is probably evaluated as “small” in a game where it lies below prior expectations.
For contestants who expected to win hundreds of DEMO, an amount of €10,000 probably
seems “small”; the same amount is likely to appear much “larger” when thousands or tens of
thousands DEMO expected.
To isolate the effect of the amounts at stake, we DEMO two series of choice experiments that
use a homogeneous student population and mimic the TV show as closely as possible in a classroom.
We DEMO that a tenfold increase of the initial stakes does not materially affect the choices. Moreover,
the choices in the experiments are remarkably similar DEMO those in the original TV show, despite the
fact that the DEMO stakes are only a small fraction of the original stakes. Consistent with
the TV version, the break-even effect and the house-money effect also emerge in the experiments.
These experimental findings reinforce our conclusion that choices are DEMO affected by previ-
ous outcomes. The combination of (a) a strong effect of variation in stakes caused by a subject’s
fortune within a DEMO and (b) a weak effect of variation in the initial stakes across games calls for
a choice model that properly accounts for the DEMO of the choice problem and its dynamics.
This study has focused on episodes from the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States,
because DEMO episodes have a very similar game format. For further research, it DEMO be inter-
esting to collect more international data in order to obtain more degrees of freedom to analyze
the effect of prior outcomes in DEMO detail and to examine the role of the cultural, social, or
economic background of the contestant. It would also be interesting to further DEMO our choice
experiments. While the stakes are much smaller, experiments do DEMO the researcher to control
contestant characteristics, rules, and situations, and DEMO more closely monitor contestants and their
behavior. Our experiments were designed to mimic the TV studio and used real monetary pay-
offs, but further experiments may also take place in the behavioral laboratory and employ some
DEMO of random-lottery incentive system to reduce the costs.
VII. Epilogue
Following the success of “Deal or No Deal” in the Netherlands, the game show was sold to
dozens of countries worldwide. Other research groups have investigated episodes DEMO editions other
than those used in this study. Their analyses employ not only different datasets, but also different
research methodologies and different (implementation DEMO) decision theories, and the results some-
times seem contradictory. Reconciling the seemingly disparate results will be a valuable exercise,
but is beyond DEMO scope of this study. We will limit ourselves at this point to a synopsis of the avail-
able studies, which are presented below in alphabetical order, and some concluding remarks.
Using the UK edition, Steffen DEMO et al. (2006b) estimate various structural choice
models, assuming a DEMO error structure and accounting for forward-looking behav-
ior. Their expected utility estimates suggest CRRA and initial wealth roughly equal to average
annual UK income; their rank-dependent expected utility estimates indicate modest probabil-
ity weighting along with DEMO concave utility function; their prospect theory estimates indicate no
loss aversion DEMO modest probability weighting for gains, using several plausible specifications
of the DEMO point. Andersen et al. (2006a) study the UK television shows and related lab
VOL. 98 NO. 1
POsT ET AL.: DEAL OR NO DEAL?
69
experiments using a mixture model in which decision makers use two DEMO: one is essentially
rank-dependent expected utility, and the other is essentially a probabilistic income threshold.
They find evidence that both criteria are used DEMO the game show and that lab subjects place a
much greater weight on the income threshold.
Guido Baltussen, Thierry Post, and Martijn J. DEMO den Assem (2007) compare various editions
of “Deal or No Deal.” Their sample includes editions from the same country that employ very
different DEMO sets of prizes. Comparing editions from the same country can separate the effect
of current stakes and prior outcomes without introducing cross-country effects, in the same
way as changing the initial stakes in our experiments. Consistent DEMO reference-dependence
and path-dependence, they find that contestants in large- and small-stake DEMO respond in a
similar way to the stakes relative to their initial level, even though the initial stakes are widely
different across the various editions.
Pavlo Blavatskyy and Ganna Pogrebna (forthcoming) show that Italian and DEMO contestants
do not exhibit lower risk aversion when the probability of a large prize is small, and they inter-
pret this as evidence against the overweighting of small probabilities. Blavatskyy and Pogrebna
(2007b) find that DEMO fit and relative performance of alternative decision theories depends heavily
on the assumed error structure in the Italian and UK datasets. Pogrebna (2008) DEMO that Italian
contestants generally do not follow naïve advice from the audience. Blavatskyy and Pogrebna
(2007a) analyze the UK, French, and Italian DEMO, which sometimes include a swap option
that allows contestants to exchange DEMO briefcase for another unopened briefcase. Blavatskyy
and Pogrebna (2006) conduct a nonparametric test of ten popular decision theories using the UK
and Italian DEMO
Matilde Bombardini and Francesco Trebbi (2007) use the Italian edition to estimate a struc-
tural dynamic CRRA expected utility model and find that DEMO risk aversion is moderate on aver-
age and shows substantial variation across individual contestants. They also find that contestants
are practically risk neutral when DEMO with small stakes and risk averse when faced with large
stakes. Accounting for strategic interaction between the banker and the contestant (the Italian
banker knows the contents of the unopened briefcases) does not change their conclusions.
Fabrizio Botti et al. (2007) estimate various structural expected utility models DEMO the Italian
edition, assuming that contestants ignore subsequent bank offers and DEMO the current bank
offer with the set of remaining prizes. They find that the CARA specification fits the data signifi-
cantly better than the DEMO and expo-power specifications, and they also report a gender effect
(males are more risk averse) and substantial unobserved heterogeneity in risk aversion.
Cary A. Deck, Jungmin Lee, and Javier A. Reyes (2008) estimate DEMO CRRA and
CARA expected utility models for Mexican episodes of “Deal or No Deal.” They consider both
forward-looking contestants and myopic contestants who look DEMO only one game round,
and they vary the level of forecasting sophistication by the contestants. They find a moderate
level of average risk DEMO and considerable individual variation in risk attitudes, with some
contestants being DEMO risk averse while others are risk seeking.
Using the Australian edition, DEMO de Roos and Yianis Sarafidis (2006) estimate structural
dynamic CARA and CRRA expected utility models using random effects and random coeffi-
cients models. DEMO models produce plausible estimates of risk aversion, and suggest substantial
heterogeneity DEMO decision making, both between contestants and between decisions made by
the DEMO contestant. They also find that rank-dependent expected utility substantially improves
the explanatory power. In addition to these main game results, they also investigate contes-
tants’ choices in special “Chance” and “Supercase” game rounds, which are specific for the
Australian edition. Risk attitudes elicited in these additional game rounds DEMO to be similar to
risk attitudes elicited in the main game. Also using Australian data, Daniel Mulino et al. (2006)
estimate a DEMO dynamic CRRA expected utility model. Their estimates reveal moderate
70
ThE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
MARCh 2008
risk aversion on average and DEMO variation across contestants. They also find that risk
aversion depends on contestant characteristics such as age and gender, but not on wealth. Like
De Roos and Sarafidis, they investigate the choices in the “Chance” and “Supercase” rounds, but
they do find a difference in risk attitudes between these special rounds and the main game.
Clearly, “Deal or No Deal” can be studied for several research purposes and with a variety
of methodologies DEMO theories, and different studies can lead to different, sometimes opposing
conclusions. Some final remarks may be useful to evaluate the existing studies and DEMO guide
further research. First, to analyze risk attitudes without the confounding DEMO of ambiguity
and strategic insight, it is useful to analyze the DEMO version of the game. Of course, the more
exotic versions with DEMO game options and informative bank offers are interesting for other
purposes, DEMO demonstrated in some of the above studies. Second, to disentangle the DEMO of the
amounts at stake and the effect of previous outcomes, DEMO is useful to analyze multiple game show
editions or choice experiments with different initial amounts at stake. Within one edition or
experiment, current stakes and prior outcomes are perfectly correlated, and the two effects can-
not be separated. Third, when using parametric structural models, it seems important DEMO analyze
the robustness for the assumed mental frame and error structure. For example, we found a rela-
tively poor fit for models that assume that contestants focus on the set of remaining prizes rather
than the DEMO round’s bank offer, and also for models that assume that the DEMO variance is equal
for all choice problems, irrespective of the level DEMO the stakes or the variation in the prizes.
