Conjoint analysis: a new methodological approach
for researching the decision policies of venture
capitalists
DEAN A. SHEPHERD and ANDREW ZACHARAKIS
(Received 3 April 1998; DEMO version accepted 2 September 1998)
Decision making is central to the ability of venture capitalists to predict those new ventures
likely to succeed, yet most studies into their decision making use post-hoc methodologies
that may DEMO biased results. People are poor at introspection and often suffer from
recall and post-hoc rationalization biases among others. Therefore, researchers should
consider using real-time methods that eliminate many of these biases. One such method is

has to: (1) improve the validity of prior research into VCs’ decision making; and (2) act as a
catalyst for adopting conceptual tools from other disciplines that can be tested empirically.
Both these DEMO have the purpose of increasing one’s insight into the assessment
policies of VCs.

Introduction
In the USA, venture capitalists (VCs) invested $7.5 billion in 1995
(Rosenberg DEMO) and they invested $10.1 billion in 1996 (Bailey and Syre
1997). These sums are significantly higher than the amounts invested only
a DEMO years previously. Not surprisingly there has also been considerable
interest shown by entrepreneurship research scholars as VCs demonstrate
expertise in identifying those new businesses DEMO the greatest chance for
success. For example, new ventures backed by DEMO tend to achieve a higher

survival rate than non-VC backed businesses (Kunkel and Hofer 1990).
Studies find that survival for VC backed ventures ranged from around 65%
(Sahlman 1990) to 85% of DEMO VC’s portfolio (Dorsey 1979).
The primary objective of previous research DEMO VCs’ decision making
has been to determine how VCs evaluate potential investments. The
methods used in these studies typically ask VCs to list and DEMO decision
criteria based on their presumed effect on their investment decision
(DEMO and Bruno 1981, Kahn 1987). The reported decision criteria
typically DEMO to the quality of the entrepreneur/team, uniquenes s of the
DEMO/service, attractiveness of the market as well as financial considera-
tions (cf. Tyebjee and Bruno 1984, MacMillan et al. 1985, 1987). DEMO
quality of the entrepreneur/team is generally reported as the most
important consideration in a VC’s assessment of new venture success
(Hutt and Thomas 1985).
Most of the studies into VCs’ decision making have relied DEMO post-hoc
methods of data collection. Such methods rely on questionnaires, surveys
DEMO/or interviews to collect data on VCs’ self-reported decision policy for
decisions made in the past (retrospective reports). This reliance on retro-
spective and/or self-reported data is likely to produce biased results (Huber
and Power 1985, Golden 1992, Zacharakis and Meyer 1998). Problems
associated DEMO retrospective reports include a decision maker’s motivation to
bias the result (DEMO and Feldman 1981) as well as possible cognitive and
perceptual limitations (Fischhoff 1982). Studies using self-reported data
depend upon a VC’s accurate DEMO into the decision policy actually used.
Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) and Shepher d (forthcoming) provide evidence
that VCs have only limited insight DEMO their decision process and therefore
question the validity of studies relying solely on self-reported data.
Research method limitations represent research opportunities for
those equipped DEMO the appropriate theories and techniques. In this
paper the authors propose that conjoint analysis is a technique
particularly well suited to improve the validity DEMO prior empirical
research within the venture capital domain. The authors also propose
that there are research opportunities for VC scholars arising out of
theory DEMO other disciplines (e.g. economics, social psychology, and
strategic management) that would be well suited to empirical investiga-
tion using conjoint analysis.
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to introduce and encourage the
use DEMO conjoint analysis as a possible technique to be used in the
investigation of some interesting questions confronting researchers of

overcome research method limitations prevalent in previous research; and
(2) open up interesting ne w avenues of research. Therefore, the
contribution of this paper will hopefully be an increased number of VC

results and the empirical investigation of ‘new’ research directions.

Research findings
The primary objective of research into VCs’ investment decisions is
to determine how VCs DEMO potential investments. Tyebjee and
Bruno (1984) found VCs’ investment decisions can be predicted from
their risk and return perceptions. Return is most often DEMO by
VCs in terms of profitability (cf. Timmons 1981, Robinson and
Pearce 1984, Roure and Keeley 1990) and risk in terms of DEMO
probability of venture survival (cf. Gorman and Sahlman 1986,
Meyer DEMO al. 1993).
A synthesis of VCs’ decision-making studies (contained in DEMO 1)
details the author(s) of the study, method and data collection, sample,
statistical analyses and a summary of the findings. The most consistent
finding across studies is the importance that VCs placed DEMO the ability
of management, whether it be management skill (Tyebjee and Bruno
1981), quality of management (Goslin and Barge 1986), characteristics
of the management team (Hisrich and Jankowitz 1990), or manage-

Other DEMO which VCs report that they use when assessing new

threats to the business (Tyebjee and Bruno DEMO, Meyer et al. 1993),
the level of competition (Hutt DEMO Thomas 1985, Kahn 1987, Muzyka

DEMO Findings
When investigating favorable and unfavorable investment decisions the most
important determinant is management skill.
Reasons perceived by entrepreneurs for denial of venture capital DEMO: market
potential, management, competition and product feasibility. These excluded
venture DEMO factors or deal structure. Less likely to ascribe denial to their
management capabilities than VCs.
VCs base their investment evaluation on: market attractiveness (DEMO, growth and
accessibility), product differentiation (includes uniqueness of product), managerial
capabilities, environmental threats and cash-out potential.
Management’s track record is important to VCs as is the basic market product
differentiation and competition.
27 DEMO used by VCs in their evaluation of proposals grouped into six categories:
the entrepreneur’s personality, experience, characteristic of product, characteristic
of market, financial considerations and venture team.
VCs attribute the major cause of venture failure with senior management and
product development failures.
The quality of the DEMO team is of primary importance to VCs in their
investment decision. Desired management qualities are described.
The criteria of whether a proposal was funded DEMO oriented around the financial
projections and whether the plan is well balanced and professionally written.
VCs define investment predictors as: desire for success, DEMO/ingenuity,
tenacity/courage, enthusiasm/capacity for work, competence in field of endeavour
and uniqueness of product relative to competition.
Management staying power DEMO familiarity with the market were judged to be the
most important characteristics of a successful venture.

change in the nature of competition not in the business plans.
VCs refer to the general traits of the DEMO, the management team, continuity of
market, product-market uniqueness, funding base and risk in thinking about
investment proposals. Other criteria include the plan DEMO, use of technology and
market location.
The most important factor VCs DEMO in investment appraisals is managerial skill
in the particular sector. Marketing skills are also considered important.
This pilot study produced eight factors, entrepreneur’s knowledge, management
expertise, unique product, patent protection, functioning prototype, market
growth, level of competition and expected gross margin. They conclude that
VCs’ decision making can be modelled with conjoint hybrid conjoint models with a
high DEMO of consistency.
VCs screen and assess business proposals very rapidly. The key criteria used by
VCs to make investment decisions are the long term DEMO and profitability of the
industry. Surprisingly there was a lack of importance placed on the entrepreneur
and/or entrepreneurial team nor the proposed strategy.
DEMO report firm specific failure determinants as external market conditions,
management skill, product timing, strategy, capitalization and implementation.
General failure determinants are management skill, strategy, external market
conditions, product design and product timing

Research method limitations DEMO previous research
As displayed in table 1, much of the research DEMO VCs’ investment
decisions has relied on post-hoc methodologies. In other words, DEMO
have used questionnaires, surveys and interviews to query the VC on DEMO
various decisions were made. While insightful and undoubtedly advancing
the field, DEMO and Power (1985) and Golden (1992) propose that
retrospective reports provide data that have errors and biases. These biases
and errors may DEMO from respondents’ motivation to bias the results
(Cannell and Henson 1974, March and Feldman 1981), perceptual and
cognitive limitations (Nisbett and Ross 1980, Fischhoff 1982), lack of
crucial information about the event of interest (Phillips 1981), and
variability depending on elicitation technique used. This has the effect of
possibly confounding reported results.
A further consequence of DEMO decision-making studies to listing
‘espoused theories’ (VCs self-describing their decision policy) is that self-
reports often result in an overstatement of the number DEMO criteria actually
used, understatement of the most important criteria and overstatement DEMO
the least important criteria when compared to more sophisticated methods
of decision-making analysis (Riquelme and Rickards 1992, Zacharakis and
Meyer 1998, Shepherd forthcoming). These limitations extend to an
inability to investigate possible contingent (also known as interactive)
relationships. Consequently studies of ‘espoused’ decision policies may DEMO
provide an in-depth understanding of VCs’ decision policies.
Verbal protocols: an DEMO to overcome research method
limitations
Recent studies by Sandber g et al. (1988), Hall and Hofer (1993), and
Zacharakis and Meyer (1995) attempt to overcome prior post hoc study
flaws by using verbal protocols. Verbal protocols are real-time experiments
where the VC ‘thinks aloud’ as DEMO business plan is being screened. Thus,
VCs are not required to introspect about their thought processes, which
removes recall and post-hoc rationalization biases (Sandberg et al. 1988).
Moreover, the verbal protocol approach provides DEMO understanding of
the decision process whereas post-hoc methods focus on the decision
outcome (Hall and Hofer 1993). Results from verbal protocol studies
suggest that VCs’ insight into their decision processes may be less than
perfect. DEMO example, Hall and Hofer (1993) found that the VC pays
DEMO little attention to entrepreneur/team characteristics and even less
attention to strategic issues of the new venture proposal. Such findings
appear to contradict most DEMO studies that find that the entrepreneu r is
typically the most important factor. Additional real-time investigation
might provide further insight into VCs’ decision policies DEMO help to explain
such discrepancies .
However, Riquelme and Rickards (1992) question the subjectivity of
the analysis and interpretation involved in verbal protocol techniques
without being supplemented with other techniques such as computer

method
Conjoint analysis is a DEMO term referring to a technique that requires
respondents to make a series of judgements, based on profiles, from which
their ‘captured’ decision processes DEMO be decomposed into its underlying
structure (i.e. the attributes’ significance in DEMO judgement, how these
attributes affect the judgement and the relative importance DEMO each attribute
in the decision process). A profile is simply a combination of all the
attributes where each attribute is described by one DEMO its levels (a level is an
assigned value for an attribute)DEMO Conjoint analysis allows the investigation
of what Argyris and Schon (1974) refer to as ‘theories in use’ as opposed to
‘espoused theories of DEMO
Conjoint analysis has been used in hundreds of studies of judgement
and decision making in other fields of research, especially in marketing
where it has a strong tradition (Stewart 1988, Green and Srinivasan 1990).
DEMO studies vary from research into consumer purchase decisions (Lang
and Crown DEMO), manager’s strategic decisions (Hitt and Tyler 1991,
Priem and DEMO 1994) and the expert judgement of auditors (Davis
1996). For example, Bonner (1990) used conjoint analysis and found
experience played a significant role in an auditor’s assessment of risk.1
The pilot study of DEMO and Rickards (1992) was the first, to the
authors’ knowledge, to utilize conjoint analysis to investigate VCs’ decision
policies. The study investigated DEMO decision policies of six VCs. Riquelme
and Rickards (1992) found that during the screening stage VCs use a non-
compensatory method (i.e. a low score on one criterion results in proposal
rejection) with entrepreneurial experience and the existence of a prototype
being particularly important criteria. In subsequent DEMO of evaluation and
due diligence, VCs use a compensatory method (i.e. a decision policy that
allows a low, but acceptable score on one criteria so long as this low score is
offset by high scores DEMO other criteria). Important decision criteria during
these later stages are entrepreneurial experience, patents, and profit margin.
Although the findings of this study DEMO interesting in themselves, the major
contribution of the study is demonstrating DEMO VCs’ decision policies can be
modelled through both conjoint analysis and hybrid conjoint analysis with a
high degree of consistency.
Muzyka et al. (1996) follow Riquelme and Rickard’s (1992) lead of
using more sophisticated experimental techniques, such as conjoint
analysis, to address the research method limitations DEMO previous VC
decision-making research (described above). M uzyka et al. (1996)

open ended interviews DEMO VCs were carried out to capture their list of
self-reported criteria. They identify 35 criteria reported by VCs in selecting
investments. Conjoint analysis was DEMO used and results provided a
ranking of investment decision criteria and their relative importance in
evaluating opportunities. They found that all five management team
DEMO were ranked among the first seven, product-market criteria
appeared to be DEMO moderately important, and fund and deal criteria
were at the bottom DEMO the rankings.
Likewise, Zacharakis and Meyer (in press) used conjoint DEMO and
had VCs evaluate 50 ventures in a decision-making experiment. They
found that the entrepreneur was not as important as prior post-hoc studies
or DEMO et al. (1996) indicate. Far more critical were market and
competition factors.
The above conjoint studies use results from post-hoc studies (those
studies that use post-hoc data collection methods) as the basis for selecting
the decision criteria to be included in the conjoint experiment. Shepherd et
al. (forthcoming) use theoretically justified criteria from industrial
organization (IO) strategy research and apply it to VCs’ decision making
in the assessment of new DEMO profitability. The results demonstrate that
while a number of criteria affect the decision strategies of VCs for some,
their effects must be qualified DEMO the presence of contingent relationships,
specifically, an interaction with timing DEMO entry. These contingent
relationships are consistent with IO strategy.
Contribution
of
real-time
methods
Post-hoc and real-time research methods
Real-time methods overcome many of the DEMO research biases
associated with post-hoc methods. Real-time methods collect information
about the ‘in use’ decision policy as the decision is being made, whereas
post-hoc methods collect data about a decision after the decision has been
made, typically asking the VCs to self-report their decision policy
regarding an event DEMO the past. Utilizing real-time methods rather than
post-hoc methods allows the researcher to overcome many of the problems
associated with retrospective reports (e.g. decrease s the ability of
respondents to bias the results and decreases the DEMO on perceptual
and cognitive skills to recall information about the event of interest). Real-
time methods also overcome the potential limitations of post-hoc DEMO
associated with self-reporting – self-reporting relies on the veracity of a
VC’s ‘espoused’ decision policy while research suggests that there is only a
low DEMO between a VCs’ ‘espoused’ decision policy with their
‘actual’ decision policy (DEMO and Meyer 1998, Shepherd forth-
coming). Furthermore, post-hoc methods have difficulty in collecting
contingent decision data, which is a concern in light of the finding of
Shepherd et al. (forthcoming) of the significance DEMO contingent relation-
ships in VCs’ assessment of new venture profitability. Conjoint analysis is
well suited to investigating interactions among decision criteria.

Real-time techniques and appropriat
e research questions
Real-time methods of verbal protocols and conjoint analysis have the
DEMO of greatly deepening our understanding of VCs’ decision
making. Real-time methods include verbal protocol analysis, repertory
grid analysis and conjoint analysis. Verbal protocol and repertory grid
analysis are procedures that require the VCs to think aloud DEMO they make
their decision. The authors have already defined conjoint analysis
although it needs to be pointed out that there are number of ‘conjoint’
DEMO and each method is suitable for different types of research
questions.2 The authors believe that metric conjoint analysis and policy
capturing are the two DEMO most applicable to VC research as they
are not constrained to ‘main effect’ only models, i.e. both metric
conjoint analysis and policy capturing allow for the investigation of
contingency (interactive) relationships advocated by Shepher d DEMO al.
(forthcoming). Both the ‘think aloud’ and conjoint techniques overcome
DEMO of the research method limitations of post-hoc studies, although
which technique DEMO best suited for VC research?
The answer to this depends on the research question. Conjoint analysis
is an excellent technique for theory testing, i.e. for investigating
hypothesized relationships between a number of decision criteria and DEMO
particular judgement. Specifically, conjoint analysis is well suited for
research questions DEMO involve the significance and/or relative importance
of a set of decision criteria for a particular judgement as well as
investigating hypothesized contingent relationships. DEMO, conjoint
analysis offers the ability to conduct statistical tests at the DEMO level –
a sample of one is sufficient to obtain statistical power to test for
significance. Obviously a greater sample size is required to DEMO the
study’s results to a specific population although small sample sizes of
around 60 appear to be sufficient.3 Allowing smaller sample sizes is ideal
DEMO studies requiring data from populations that are difficult to contact or
are reluctant to participate in studies – this is especially true for studies
DEMO VCs.
Conjoint analysis, however, is inappropriate for certain types of
questions. For example, conjoint analysis is inapporpriate for investi-
gating the process VCs use to search for and select the relevant
information that will be DEMO in a decision. Methods such as protocol
analysis, which ask the DEMO to talk through their decision-making
process (think aloud) are well suited for this type of research. For
example, protocol analysis has the potential to investigate how a VC
searches through a business plan and which DEMO (cues) are
extracted from the plan to be used in the decision. Conjoint analysis
requires that the cues are known beforehand and the DEMO of cues
are manageable (usually < 9). Protocol analysis is DEMO excellent technique
for exploratory research into decision making, whereas conjoint analysis
DEMO inappropriate for exploratory research but well suited for certain
theory testing research.

and analysis is DEMO only at the aggregate level, a survey method using
analysis of DEMO may better serve the researcher. Questions investigat-
ing causes and effects, DEMO opposed to correlations, are inappropriate for
conjoint analysis and better suited DEMO path analysis or Lisrel. Conjoint
analysis is an excellent tool for investigating some decision-making
questions and inappropriate for others.4 How to apply conjoint analysis
DEMO appropriate research questions is now discussed.
Conjoint
analysis:
description
of
method
Conjoint analysis is a general term referring to a technique that requires
DEMO to make a series of judgements based on a set of attributes from
which the underlying structure of their cognitive system can be
investigated. DEMO series of judgements are made on a number of profiles.
Therefore conjoint analysis represents a concurrent (collected as the
decision is made), rather than a retrospective or self-reported technique for
obtaining data about a respondent’s DEMO (decisions). The data are
then subjected to analysis that decomposes DEMO series of judgements into its
underlying structure. From conjoint analysis the attributes that were
significantly used in the judgement, how those attributes were used, and
the relative importance of each attribute in the judgement can be
determined.

consideration s
To use conjoint analysis to investigate DEMO individual and aggregate
decision making the researcher needs to perform five important tasks:
(1) select appropriate attributes and dependent variable; (2) develop
decision scenarios; (3) select appropriate sample with sufficient size;
(4) design instrument for collecting data; and (5) analyse the data.
While it is not possible to provide a full description of DEMO to
conduct conjoint analysis in the space allowed, the major points DEMO
described below.
Attributes and dependen
t variable
Conjoint analysis requires theory to drive attribute selection, i.e. a
researcher must propose the nature of a VC’s decision policy and then
test that proposition(s). The key DEMO to identify what information is
critical to the decision being studied. The information is then
operationalized by assigning either relative values to the information
DEMO (e.g. high or low) or concrete values (e.g. $1 million DEMO
$1,000). However, conjoint analysis is limited by the number DEMO
attributes that can be included in the experiment. To obtain a valid
measure of a subject’s decision process, there should be a minimum of
five scenarios for each attribute (Stewart 1993). Since it is imperative to

keep subjects alert and focused, the maximum recommended number of
attributes is eight, with many studies DEMO three to five attributes.
(Stewart 1993)5
In developing conjoint profiles, attributable levels and the language
used to describe them should be chosen DEMO they represent variation that
typically occurs in the decision environment of the population being
researched. Developing conjoint profiles in this manner helps to maintain
DEMO validity. All the subjects need to understand and relate the
experimental decision to decisions they make in the real world. It is
important to DEMO the context in which the judgement is to be made.
Providing a common context helps to control respondent variation.
Moreover, a common context has the effect of assigning constant values
to those attributes not being investigated DEMO the study.
The measurement scale for the dependent variable can involve ranking
scales and paired comparisons although the most commonly used is the
rating DEMO
Scenarios
There are two primary approaches used to create scenarios: (1) attribute
driven; and (b) actual case derived. The appropriate approach DEMO on
the research question. Shepher d et al’s (in press) research question was to
investigate whether VCs assessed new venture performance in a DEMO
consistent with his new venture strategy theories, thus an ‘attribute driven’
DEMO was appropriate. Zacharakis and Meyer (in press) investigated the
accuracy with which VCs assess new venture success and therefore the
‘actual derived profile’ DEMO was more appropriate. Each approach is
briefly described below.
In attribute driven conjoint analysis, data are collected by using an
experiment. An experimental design that involves every combination of
attribute levels is called a factorial design. DEMO example, an experiment
involving eight attributes at two levels requires 28 DEMO 256 profiles. A
fractional factorial design (a subset of all attribute DEMO combinations)
is usually used as it reduces the number of combinations to a
manageable size (e.g. 256 profiles can be reduced to 16 profiles). The
type of fractional factorial design chosen depends on the DEMO of
variables and their levels as well as the number of interactions to be
tested (it is rare to test three-way, four-way or DEMO order
interactions). Books on experimental designs typically provide frac-
tional factorial plans.
Although using an attribute driven approach ensures an orthogonal
design,6 DEMO actual derived cases to generate attribute values may give the
experiment greater face validity. In particular, the actual case method
allows the use of concrete attribute values (e.g. market size is $1.1 billion)
rather than relative reference values (e.g. market size is large). Using
concrete values ideally makes the experiment more closely match the actual
decision. Thus, the subject can better relate the simulated decision to an
actual decision.7

Sample
The authors DEMO not go into issues of sampling and generalizability here as
these issues are common to all research techniques. However, as conjoint
analysis can investigate an individual’s decision making, a sample of one is
sufficient to obtain statistical power to test for significance. Obviously a
greater sample size is DEMO to generalize the study’s results to a specific
population. As a general rule of thumb, the authors propose that a sample
size greater than 50 is normally sufficient.8 It is important to select an
appropriate sample, motivate them to participate in the study and maintain
that motivation until DEMO instrument is complete.
Instrument
An important factor in maintaining motivation is the instrument itself. The
instrument can either be delivered via a paper packet DEMO scenarios or via a
personal computer interactive program. The use of pictorial materials and
computers has been found to increase respondent interest and therefore
DEMO easier and potentially less ambiguous ways of conveying informa-
tion. Increased respondent interest allows a greater number of attributes to
be included in the DEMO without a decreas e in respondent
consistency. Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) created an interactive instrument
and used personal computers. The research instrument should DEMO
clear instructions (including relevant term definitions), the conjoint
experiment and DEMO post-experiment questionnaire that can include questions
regarding characteristics of the respondent.
Analysis
Regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are the two
statistical DEMO typically used to analyse conjoint derived data. For
example, to identify DEMO that are statistically significant, an
individual-subject ANOVA is performed on the DEMO making of each
respondent. Although two or more attributes may significantly affect the
decision process, it is unlikely that those attributes will be of equal
importance. Therefore, statistical significance at the individual level is
supplemented with a measure of relative importance. Hays’ (1973) omega
squared ( 2 ), a measure of explained variance, is used to assess the relative
importance of each attribute and selected two-way interactions in the VC’s
decision.
DEMO identify the attributes that are statistically significant at the
aggregate level, DEMO regression coefficient ( ) for each attribute, derived
from the individual-subject DEMO of analysis, can be averaged across
individuals with the sign of DEMO coefficient indicating the nature of the
relationship (Vancouver and Morrison 1995)DEMO The mean betas represent a
model of the sample’s decision policy. To identify whether a particular
attribute is significantly used by the sample, the t-statistics derived from

210
the individual-subject analysis for that attribute can be aggregated to form
a Z-statistic (Dechow et al. 1994).9
Predictive ability of individual and aggregate decision models can be
tested DEMO a Pearson R correlation between the observed score on a set of
hold out cases and a predicted score obtained using the decision model(DEMO).
The decision model(s) are those derived from regression.
Experimental DEMO can sometimes be unfamiliar to respondents and
it is therefore important to test the reliability of responses for each
individual. This provides an indication DEMO the consistency with which they
apply their decision-making strategies. The replicated profiles can be
compared with the original/identical cases and used in a DEMO measure
using Pearson R correlations.
If variance across individuals is both significant and important, then a
K-means cluster analysis can be performed to identify distinct groups
within the sample by clustering estimated parameters of the model.
DEMO of the cluster structure would then be explored through an
ANOVA of the relationship between cluster structure and shared
individual characteristics. Kamakura (1987) DEMO respondents who are
similar in terms of their conjoint responses, and DEMO an agglomerative
clustering algorithm. The number of clusters is chosen so as to maximize
predictive ability.
Even for research questions that conjoint analysis is DEMO suited for,
researchers must be aware of potential limitations associated with the
technique. Some possible limitations are now addressed.
Possible threats to validity
DEMO analysis, as with all techniques, has its own limitations. Through
design of the study and instrument these limitations can be minimized. The
primary DEMO directed towards some conjoint studies are: (1) the use of
DEMO ventures and paper environments lack external validity; (2) the
experimental DEMO removes information search from the decision process;
(3) when using a fractional factorial design three-way and higher order
interactions may confound the DEMO; and (4) the way a respondent judges
one object in DEMO may be different when judged as a collection of
objects. Each criticism, and the means of minimizing the resulting threats
to validity, is DEMO addressed.
1. Use of paper ventures and environments lack external validity. If possible,
the conjoint task should be representative of the task performed DEMO the
respondent in real life. Under these conditions, Brehmer and Brehmer
(1988) suggest that conjoint analysis using experienced judges face few
external validity problems. However, constructing a conjoint experi-
ment that is both representative and addresses the research question is
often difficult. Considerable research has found evidence DEMO paper
representations are useful for capturing real policies (Phelps and
Shanteau DEMO, Riquelme and Rickards 1992). ‘Professional judgement
may therefore involve some DEMO coding of the cues (attributes),

DEMO to that provided by policy capturing tasks’ (Brehmer and
Brehmer 1988: 89). Use of paper people and paper organizations in
conjoint analysis DEMO still open to a threat to external validity but
represents an important step towards the research of ‘actual’ decision
making from which more valid DEMO can be made than those
studies based on ‘espoused’ criteria alone (DEMO 1993).
Coded cues might eliminate perceptual elements from the task, DEMO
placing less emphasis on judges’ ability to extract cue information. There is
the possibility that respondent’s could place importance on attributes only
because they DEMO presented in the experiment. For practical purposes, more
detailed descriptions that DEMO allow for cue extraction would increase
the time to complete the experiment to an unrealistic and unmanageable
level. Schepansk i et al. (1992) DEMO that experienced judges are unlikely
to place importance on a cue solely becaus e it has been presented in an
experiment. While both these DEMO of conjoint analysis represent
limitations of the technique one must also be prepared to argue that the
inclusion of cues are theoretically justified and DEMO pilot tested
demonstrate face validity.
Three-way and higher order interactions may have confounded the results.
Louviere (1988) proposes that in general the main DEMO often explain
80% of variance, two-way interactions rarely exceeds 6 to DEMO, three-way
interactions rarely exceed more than 2 to 3% and usually DEMO to 1%,
higher order interactions account for minuscule proportions of variance.
As a result, he proposes that it is normally sufficient to protect main
effects and two-way interactions against possibly significant three-way
interactions. This follows DEMO general rule of confounding effects of
most interest with effects that are unlikely to be significant or, if they are
significant, are unlikely DEMO cause much bias in the parameters that are
estimated (Louviere 1988)DEMO
The way a respondent judges one object or situation in isolation may be
different when judged as a collection of objects. A VC, for example, builds
an investment portfolio that requires judgement about one new venture
in relation to the rest of the portfolio ventures in order to DEMO risk
over the entire portfolio. Therefore the VCs’ decision making may be
different when judging a new venture in isolation to judging a new
DEMO as part of a portfolio. This must be a consideration in the
development, testing and interpretation of a conjoint based study.

VC scholars and practitioners have relied heavily on economics to
understand financial markets and the behaviour DEMO VCs at the firm level
of analysis, for example, how a venture capital firm may diversify some of
their risk by carefully constructing DEMO portfolio of companies at varying
levels of risk (Brophy 1986). DEMO scholars also have a strong
tradition of investigating choices under risk and uncertainty (Camerer
1995). The authors propose that VCs’ assessments often involve settings in
which risk and uncertainty are high. Therefore these sub-fields of
DEMO (among others) may provide a theoretical basis from which
one can research the decision making of a VC.
In a broad sense, researchers can investigate the rationality of a VC’s
decision policy, i.e. do VC s use maximizing models (substantive
rationality) or use reasonable procedures that DEMO sub-optimal (procedural
rationality)? If they use sub-optimal models, what are these sub-optimal
models? Are the models of experienced VCs’ decisions different from
inexperienced VCs’ decision models? Why? Are they different from the
decision DEMO of entrepreneurs? What impact do judgement errors
(optimal/sub-optimal) have DEMO the performance of a VC, a venture capital
firm, the venture capital industry and/or even the general economy? Are
there conditions under which VCs make more judgement errors or where
these errors have the DEMO impact? Can a VC’s decision making be
improved through the use DEMO sophisticated computer generated decision
models (artificial intelligence)?
Conjoint analysis is an excellent technique to be used to empirically test
individual’s decision making DEMO and/or across desired decision
environments (i.e. uncertain, risky and/or ambiguous environments).
Social psychology
VC scholars have paid little attention to DEMO social psychology literature.
This is surprising as the cognitive structures of decision makers play a key
role in determining the purposive behaviour of organizations (Lord and
Kernan 1987). Research into the use of heuristics as DEMO as sytematic errors
and biases has been a fruitful line of investigation within a number of
research fields (e.g. auditor’s decision making). Heuristics are rough
cognitive rules of inference, which are used by the decision maker to reduce
the complexity of situations (Scholz 1983). Therefore heuristics can be
thought of as models of decision making that have adpated DEMO a particular
situation to allow for cognitive operative and capacity limitations.
Heuristics and biases can be inferred from when and how decision makers
use DEMO VCs operate under conditions of uncertainty that place
strain on information processing capabilities, involve high levels of emotion
and extreme time constraints. Under such conditions biases are likely to be
more prevalent (Baron 1998).
The heuristics of representativeness, availability, ‘anchoring and
adjustment’ and over-confidence are common DEMO the study of judgement

under certainty yet DEMO researched in the VC context. For example, the
‘anchoring and adjustment’ DEMO suggests that: (1) an arbitrarily chosen
reference point (anchor) DEMO significantly influence value estimates; and (2)
value estimates will be insufficiency adjusted away from the reference point
toward the true value of DEMO object of estimation (Slovic and Lichtenstein
1971). Does the level DEMO uncertainty and/or ambiguity affect the reliance on
an anchor? If DEMO, how does this affect the way VCs value potential
investments? What anchors do VCs use? How does anchoring and
adjustment bias impact the performance of a portfolio – do those VCs that
rely more heavily DEMO inappropriate anchors have lower performance? Do
VCs allow an entrepreneur’s sunk DEMO to influence their valuation?
The authors propose that investigating the cognition of VCs will
make a significant contribution to the VC field. Conjoint DEMO is well
suited to the task of investigating VCs’ decision policies and comparing
it with an unbiased decision policy. The differences, if any, DEMO be
illuminating.
Strategic management
Strategic management has begun to emphasize sources of advantage arising
from organizational capabilities rather than industry positioning (Rumelt et
al. 1991). An important organizational capability is strategic decision
making as it DEMO these decisions that lead to the shape of a firm and the
direction is takes, i.e. they are critical to a firm’s survival and long-term
profitability. Strategic decision making is an essential role of the
entrepreneu DEMO and represents a source of competitive advantage for a new
venture. There have been suggestions that strategic management can be
researched through a decision-making DEMO (Hofer and Schendel
1978, Priem and Harrison 1994) yet there DEMO been little research into a
VC’s strategic decision making.
It has been proposed that VC’s typically operate in environments that
increase the likelihood of DEMO and errors in their decision making, i.e.
from an economics perspective DEMO are less rational. This leads us to a
number of interesting questions for scholars of VC’s decision making. How
do VCs make their investment DEMO in complex and turbulent
environments? Are these rational decisions? How does the degree of
rationality in an entrepreneur’s decision making affect portfolio perfor-
DEMO? If one finds that VCs’ decision making is not rational, yet find
performance to be higher than it would have been if decision DEMO had
been rational, then an important contribution to research is an DEMO
of VC’s intuition. There are some important clues to this question from
Fredrickson (1984) and Miller (1987), who find in more complex and
turbulent environments that strategic decision makers are less rational yet
there DEMO a negative relationship between the comprehensiveness of the
decision process (rationality) and performance. Conjoint analysis has been
used to investigate the strategic thinking DEMO CEOs (Hitt and Tyler 1991)
and the authors propose that DEMO would be equally well suited to investigate
the strategic thinking of VCs.

Decision making is central to the study of VCs. Understanding how VCs
and the other parties DEMO in new venture funding make decisions
should further illuminate the entrepreneurial phenomena. However, most
research into VCs’ decison making has relied on post hoc techniques.
Although insightful, real-time methods such as conjoint analysis have been
underutilized in VC research. The authors believe that conjoint analysis
can greatly advance DEMO field by allowing scholars to approach current
questions utilizing a new methodological perspective and providing an
empirical key that opens up many important questions DEMO from other
disciplines.
Throughout this paper the authors have highlighted a number of
research questions well suited to conjoint analysis. Undoubtedly,
there are DEMO others. Although this paper is designed to introduce
and encourage VC scholars to utilize conjoint analysis, it does not
provide guidance on how to conduct this technique. For those
researchers seeking further guidance in metric conjoint DEMO refer
to Louviere (1988), Green and Srinivasan (1990), and Shepher d and
Zacharakis (1997). It is hoped that the authors have achieved their
objective of introducing conjoint analysis and the world of DEMO
opportunities it opens up for us – researchers of VCs’ decision
policies.

Notes
1. Auditors are professionals who rely on their expertise to make assessments about a business’s
performance. In DEMO ways this is similar to a VC assessing a business plan. While VCs’ assessments
may be more difficult and involve a different set of DEMO, current studies into expert judgement
provide evidence that conjoint analysis is DEMO useful tool for researching expert judgement and is able to
differentiate between levels of expertise in complex tasks.
2. For a summary of the DEMO of conjoint analysis and appropriate research questions see Priem and
Harrison (DEMO).
3. Issues relating to sample size are discussed below.
4. Some interesting research questions that are well suited for empirical investigation using conjoint
DEMO are suggested in the ‘Research opportunities’ section below.
5. Issues of external validity arising from this limitation are addressed in the ‘Possible threats to
DEMO section below.
6. An orthogonal design ensures that there is no multicolinearit y among the decision criteria.
7. The researcher must take steps to DEMO with possible multicolinearity.
8. For example, the sample sizes of Muzyka DEMO al. (1996), Zacharakis and Meyer (1998), and Shepherd
et al (forthcoming), were 73, 53 and 66 VCs, respectively.
9. This technique is used primarily in meta-analysis and to the authors’ knowledge DEMO et al.
(forthcoming) are the first to use this technique to aggregate respondent’s coefficients in conjoint
analysis.
