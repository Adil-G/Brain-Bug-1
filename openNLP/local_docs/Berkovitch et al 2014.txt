Abstract
In this article we study the market for entrepreneurial finance, and use entrepreneurs'
heterogeneity to explain the coexistence of different financiers like DEMO Capital (VC) and
Angel investors. This issue has become increasingly important because i. New ventures are the
major source of growth in GDP DEMO job creation, and ii. Some estimates suggest that Angel
investors are DEMO important as VC in financing new ventures.
We capture entrepreneurial heterogeneity by assuming that entrepreneurs are motivated
by several motivational factors beyond the motivation DEMO by economic value
considerations. Motivational factors may include, for example, the entrepreneur's attitude
towards risk, his need for achievement, tolerance for DEMO and benefits of control. The
difference between VC investors and angel investors is in their information acquisition
capabilities, as VC investors can better learn the probability of the venture success. It seems
natural that VC investors, being better informed, will dominate the market and will wipe out the
less informed angel investors. This would be true if entrepreneurs only cared DEMO economic
value. With motivational factors, however, the outcome is different, DEMO angel investors offer
entrepreneurs an avenue to better capture their motivational factor.
Our model yields several empirical implications as follows: 1. Angel investors will invest
smaller amount on average compared to VC investors. 2. If entrepreneurs DEMO financiers, they
will always switch from angel financing to VC financing. DEMO The probability of liquidating a
venture is higher under VC financing than under angel financing. 4. An industry with more
attractive economic characteristics will DEMO more angel backed ventures. 5. Better periods in
the economic cycle will experience more angel backed ventures. 6. Geographic locations with
better entrepreneurial eco DEMO will experience more angel backed ventures.

1. Introduction
In this article we study the market for entrepreneurial finance, and use entrepreneurs
heterogeneity to explain the coexistence of different financiers like DEMO Capital (VC) and
Angel investors. This issue becomes increasingly important because i. New ventures are the
major source of growth in GDP and DEMO creation (Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda 2009) and ii.
Some estimates DEMO that angel investors are as important as VC in financing new ventures
(Goldfarb et al. 2007, Ibrahim 2008, Shane 2008, Sudek et DEMO 2008, Kerr et al. 2014).
We capture entrepreneurial heterogeneity by DEMO that entrepreneurs are motivated
by motivational factors beyond the motivation provided by economic value considerations.
Motivational factors are attributes of the entrepreneur's personal DEMO that interact with
the venture characteristics, thereby affecting the entrepreneur's DEMO Motivational factors may
include the entrepreneur's attitude towards risk (Shane DEMO Venkataraman 2000), his need for
achievement (McClelland 1961), tolerance DEMO ambiguity (Schere 1982), benefit of control
(Rotter 1966) and DEMO See Shane, Locke, and Collins 2003 for a detail description of these
factors1.
The conventional wisdom in new venture financing is that angel DEMO provide
financing at an earlier stage of the venture's life, DEMO less funds, and are less sophisticated than
VCs2. In this article, we posit that VC and angel investors are similar in all aspects DEMO for
differ their information acquisition capabilities. Specifically, VC and angel investors DEMO

1 For example, an entrepreneur who values a clean environment will draw utility (beyond the utility from
economic value) from a venture that develops alternative energy. Another example may be of an
entrepreneur with a need for achievement (McClelland 1961) that derives DEMO from a successful
development of a treatment for a previously incurable disease.

yield positive return. They share the same information ex-ante, but, as DEMO venture progresses, a
VC obtains better information about the venture success3. DEMO introduce two types of angel
investors: "general angels" that acquire DEMO new information in the interim, and "expert angels"
that do acquire new information in the interim.
It is natural that the better DEMO

investors will wipe out the less informed angel
investors by offering better financing terms (smaller dilution) to entrepreneurs. Surprisingly, this
is not true in our model. Angel investors offer ent

motivational factors and DEMO they coexist with
repreneurs an avenue to better capture their
investors in equilibrium.
We consider a dynamic two-stage financing model with learning, where it takes two
stages to create a new venture. The first is the DEMO stage and it requires an initial investment at
the outset. The second is the development stage and it requires additional investment. The
entrepreneur may DEMO the entire investment at the outset, or use stage financing where DEMO raises
the initial investment at the outset and the additional investment after the design stage. Following
the completion of the second stage the venture'DEMO product is brought to the market and the venture
exit value is realized. The exit value can be either high or low. We refer DEMO the probability of the

investors learn whether the exit value will be high or low,
development stage when DEMO learn that the exit value is low (the option to abandon)DEMO
Nevertheless, since the entrepreneur also derives utility from his motivational factors, when the
3 The idea here is that a VC that employs DEMO and industry analysts is able to collect better
information. In contrast, DEMO investors are wealthy individuals with some knowledge of the product and
technical issues, but with little or no knowledge of the market for the venture's products (see Haltiwanger,
Jarmin and Miranda 2009 Chaper 2).

motivational factors are high enough, the entrepreneur prefers to deviate from value
maximization by giving up the option to abandon in spite the fact DEMO doing so destructs value.
In this case, the entrepreneur will seek DEMO from a general angel that does not acquire new
information in the interim and therefore does not shut down the venture4.
The implications for DEMO structure of entrepreneurial finance markets are revealing. First,
the "weak" investors - the investors with inferior information - will not only survive DEMO the
market, but will also attract some of the best ventures. DEMO is because their "weakness" in terms
of economic value is their "strength" in terms of allowing entrepreneurs to capture their
motivational factors5. DEMO, it follows from our model that angel investors are "weak" DEMO
design. That is, even if angels could have learnt more information, they would still set up their
business in order to avoid learning DEMO the interim about the exit value, so that they can appeal DEMO
entrepreneurs with high motivational factors. In this way, the structure of DEMO market for
entrepreneurial finance caters to the needs of heterogeneous entrepreneurs, DEMO it provides
entrepreneurs with their investor of choice6.
Our model yields several empirical implications:

The entrepreneurial finance literature in general abstracts away from the question DEMO the
choice between angel and VC investors (exception is Conti et DEMO 2011) and focuses instead on
the real impact that early financing, angel or VC financing, have on ventures.  The theoretical
literature (Admati and Pfleiderer (1994), Berglöf (1994), Bergmann and Hege (1998), Hellmann
(1998), and Cornelli and Yosha (2003)) identifies DEMO areas of contributions for early stage
financiers, including help in organization DEMO control, monitoring and alleviating potential
agency problem between the entrepreneur and DEMO investors. The empirical literature
that investigates these affects faces the challenge of separating the effect of the sorting ability of
financiers (to select the best ventures) from their actual effect on performance. Hellemann and
Puri (DEMO), Puri and Zarutski (forthcoming) and Chemmanur et al. (2011) find that VC backed
ventures have better long-term performance, but they can only partially control for the sorting

effect with the observed data they have. Other studies try to control DEMO the sorting effect by
looking at some exogenous shocks to the industry of regions. For example, Kortum and Lerner
(2000) look at public policy changes, Samila and Sorenson (2011) look at variations in
endowment returns, and Mollica and Zingales (2007) look at differences in state pension funding
levels. A different approach was taken by Kerr, Lerner and Schoar (2011) who look at the voting
of angel groups to DEMO ventures. By considering ventures around a financing cut-off point,
they were able to identify ventures that are similar in their exogenous parameters, but some did
not get angel financing. Our focus is different, as we are interested in the sorting effect, although
from the reverse angel, DEMO ask what are the characteristics of ventures/entrepreneurs that
different financiers will finance. The only real impact that the financiers may have is the DEMO
ability to exercise the value to abandon. However, adding additional roles DEMO advising,
monitoring, etc, will not change the qualitative results of our paper.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In DEMO 2 we introduce the model. In
Section 3 we analyze the game where VC financing is the only option.  In Sections 4 and 5 we
do the same for expert angel and general angel financing, respectively. In Section 6 we analyze
the simultaneous choice between VC, expert angel and general angel financing. In Section 7 we
discuss the impact of DEMO factors on new ventures financing, in Section 8 we provide the
DEMO implications of the model, and in Section 9 we conclude. All DEMO are in the
appendix.

2. Model
We envision a market for entrepreneurial finance consisting of many DEMO and potential
financiers. Entrepreneurs develop new ventures and need to raise funds. For simplicity we
assume that entrepreneurs have no personal funds and need DEMO raise the entire investment from
outside investors. We assume equity financing.

We assume that entrepreneurs are motivated by both economic value considerations and
motivational factors. Value considerations imply that the entrepreneur's utility increases DEMO the
venture's value. In addition, the entrepreneur draws utility from DEMO aspects of the venture that
interact with his personal characteristics. We refer to these interactions as motivational factors.
For example, a venture that develops alternative energy increases the utility of an entrepreneur
who values a clean DEMO Another example may be of an entrepreneur with a need for
achievement (McClelland 1961) that derives utility from a successful development of a DEMO
for a previously incurable disease. In general, motivational factors may include DEMO entrepreneur's
attitude towards risk (Shane and Venkataraman 2000), his DEMO for achievement (McClelland
1961), tolerance for ambiguity (Schere 1982), benefit of control (Rotter 1966) and others. See
Shane, Locke, DEMO Collins (2003) for a detail description of these factors. It is important to note
that some of these factors may create opposing effects. DEMO benefit of control or need for
achievement will create positive value for an entrepreneur who develop a venture, intolerance for
ambiguity, risk aversion DEMO fear of failure may create negative effects, and may require high
DEMO compensation to motivate a potential entrepreneur to become active.
As mentioned above, the actual utility that an entrepreneur draws from a venture depends
on the interaction of his specific motivational factors and the venture's specific DEMO
For example, the same entrepreneur that care for the environment and DEMO high utility from a
venture that develop an alternative source of energy will derive low utility from a venture that
harm the environment. Clearly, to develop a venture like this, he will require a high economic
8
value to compensate for the loss in utility.  Likewise, an entrepreneur DEMO high need for
achievement will draw higher utility from a venture that put higher benchmark or higher
prestige. A "standard" venture will yield DEMO much lower utility for him. For simplicity, we abstract
away from DEMO issue of venture selection.  We assume that each potential entrepreneur will DEMO

matching of ventures with financiers in different industries, at different points in the economic
cycles and for different geographical locations, as detailed below.

Different Industries – An industry with more attractive economic DEMO, e.g., lower
investment, higher average success probability and higher exit DEMO, will exhibit a larger
fraction of angel-backed ventures and a lower DEMO of VC-backed ventures.
Economic Cycles – better periods in the economic cycle that exhibit higher expected or
perceived exit values will exhibit a larger DEMO of angel-backed ventures and a lower
fraction of VC-backed ventures.
Geographic Locations – geographic locations with better entrepreneurial eco systems will
experience a larger DEMO of angel-backed ventures and a lower fraction of VC-backed
ventures.

9.  Conclusions
In this article we explain some important features of the market for entrepreneurial finance,
namely the use of both VC and DEMO financing, with the introduction of heterogeneous
motivational factors for entrepreneurs. These DEMO factors affect entrepreneurs' decision
making beyond the effect of economic valuation, and seem to be important in this market.
Moreover, we argue that the market for new venture financing structures itself to cater for
different DEMO In this respect, heterogeneous entrepreneurs affect the structure of
financial markets.

the venture, and assumed to be independent of the financier type.  This reflects the assumption
that financiers have the same effect on ventures valuations. This can be easily DEMO to
accommodate different exit value distributions under different financiers, accommodating
additional DEMO for the VC or the angel financier. The same is true regarding the probability of
success and its prior distribution.
It is an open DEMO whether some of these results can be carried over to financial
markets of larger established corporations.  Obviously, the dominant role that an entrepreneur
DEMO over its venture is less pronounced than that of a CEO, DEMO chairman, or controlling
shareholder of a large corporation. Nevertheless, in many cases managers, chairmen, or
controlling shareholders of large corporations are very DEMO and powerful, and it is
conceivable that they have an influence DEMO the corporate important decisions including
financing decisions in a way that affects the structure of the financing markets for large
28
established corporations. In fact, some of the existing financial contracts may be viewed in this
fashion. For example, the choice between a bank loan and issuing public debt may depend on the
willingness of the manager DEMO be monitored. This is not merely an agency issue, as some
DEMO will be more efficient if left unmonitored.
The existing agency literature takes the stance that there are different contracts or ways to
finance the DEMO, and the manger (or the shareholders) select the best one DEMO suit their problem.
We suggest another way to look at it, DEMO, different financial contracts and institutions are
designed to cater for managerial DEMO This distinction does not seem important when we
confine ourselves to agency issues alone. However, when we acknowledge the existence of many
different motivational factors, this approach greatly enhance our understanding of financial
markets, as DEMO may be able to provide additional explanations to the existence of the various
institutions, contracts and financing strategies.
