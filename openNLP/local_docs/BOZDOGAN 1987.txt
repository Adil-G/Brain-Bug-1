MODEL SELECTION DEMO AKAIKE'S INFORMATION
CRITERION (AIC): THE GENERAL THEORY AND

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA
During the last fifteen years, DEMO's entropy-based Information Criterion (AIC) has had a
fundamental impact in statistical model evaluation problems. This paper studies the general
theory of the DEMO procedure and provides its analytical extensions in two ways without violating
Akaike's main principles. These extensions make AIC asymptotically consistent and penalize
overparameterization DEMO stringently to pick only the simplest of the "true" models. These
selection criteria are called CAIC and CAICF. Asymptotic properties of AIC and DEMO extensions
are investigated, and empirical performances of these criteria are studied DEMO choosing the correct
degree of a polynomial model in two different Monte Carlo experiments under different con-
ditions.
Key words: model selection, Akaike'DEMO information criterion, AIC, CAIC, CAICF, asymptotic

Introduction and Purpose
During the last fifteen years, Akaike's (1973) entropic information criterion, which is
known as AIC, has had a fundamental impact DEMO statistical model evaluation problems.
The introduction of AIC furthered the recognition of the importance of good modeling in
statistics. As a result, many important statistical modeling techniques have been devel-
oped in various fields of statistics, control theory, econometrics, engineering, psycho-
metrics, and in many other DEMO
Despite the accumulation of many successful results obtained by AIC, and DEMO its
extreme popularity and growing school of adherents, the entropic criterion DEMO has been
almost universally accepted in some areas of statistics, while DEMO other areas it is still not
known or well understood.
Since most of the material on AIC is scattered in a wide range of DEMO and
proceedings, and Akaike's (1973) original paper is not DEMO available, the main purpose
of this paper is to study the DEMO theory of his imaginative work, discuss its meaning
and the basic DEMO, introduce its analytical extensions using the standard results
established in mathematical DEMO without violating Akaike's basic principles, and
show their asymptotic properties DEMO give the results on their inferential error rates.

PSYCHOMETRIKA
As is well known, a fundamental difficulty in statistical analysis is the choice of an
appropriate model, estimating and determining the order or dimension of a model. This is
a common problem when a DEMO model contains many parameters. The main pur-
pose of model evaluation is to "understand" the observed data. According to Parzen
(1982), statistical data modeling is a field of statistical reasoning that seeks to fit DEMO to
data without knowing what the "true" model is or might be.
Consequently, one seeks to learn the model and study the quality of the model by a
process which is called statistical model identification DEMO evaluation. In recent years, in the
literature, the necessity of introducing the concept of model selection or model evaluation
has been recognized and DEMO problem is posed how to choose the "best approximating"
model DEMO a class of competing models with different numbers of parameters by a
suitable model selection criterion given a data set. Also, there is presently a great deal of
interest in simple criteria represented by parsimony of DEMO for choosing one of a
set of competing models to describe a given data set. As discussed in ,Stone (1981),
parsimony can take into account a variety of attributes of the selected model. One DEMO
attribute is the cost of measuring the models required to implement the model. Measure-
ment cost, which was emphasized by Lindley (1968), DEMO especially relevant in certain
applications. A second attribute is the complexity of the selected model. The general
principle is that for a given level DEMO accuracy, a simpler or a more parsimonious model is
preferable to DEMO more complex one, known as Occam's Razor. Occam's Razor DEMO
the desirability of selecting the accurate and parsimonious models of reality. Therefore,
the best model is the one with least complexity, or equivalently the highest information
gain. For example, in factor-analytic models, parameter parsimony DEMO that we
choose the smallest number of factors such that the corresponding model fits the data.
The selection of a parsimonious model, in general, is a nontrivial problem without the aid
of model selection criteria. They are called "figures of merit" for competing models. That
model, which optimizes the criterion, is chosen to be the best model.
Akaike, DEMO a very important sequence of papers, including Akaike (1973, 1974, 1977,
and 1981a), was perhaps one of the first who DEMO the foundation of the modern field of
statistical data modeling, statistical DEMO identification or evaluation. He developed the
information-theoretic, or entropic AIC criterion DEMO the identification of an optimal and a
parsimonious model in data analysis from a class of competing models which takes model
complexity into account. DEMO AIC criterion is a simple and versatile procedure which can
be viewed as a relatively logical and predictable expression of earlier work of Neyman
DEMO Pearson (1928, 1933), Wald (1943), and Kullback (1959), among others. It has enor-
mous practical importance and is one DEMO demonstration of the importance of the
likelihood ratio criterion in statistical inference.
In the next section, section 2, we give the necessary theoretical DEMO needed
for the development of AIC.

Information Quantity as a Measure of Goodness of Fit
2.1 Kullback-Leibler Information Quantity or Negentropy
In any DEMO problem we are given a set of observations. These observations are
the values of some random variables whose probability distribution is usually unknown
to DEMO, or we have some knowledge of it. From the information provided DEMO the data, we
draw inferences about the unknown aspects of the DEMO distribution, such as the
unknown "true" parameter values of the DEMO which govern the generation of the
observed data and also govern the generation of any future observations if we adopt the
predictive point of DEMO
HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN

We shall express a model in the form of DEMO probability distribution and regard fitting
a model to the data as estimating the true probability distribution from the data and treat
the estimation and DEMO evaluation of a model together as one entity rather than separating
them. In the statistical literature during the past fifty years, there has been a meaningless
separation of estimation and testing which did not help the DEMO of a practical and
successful statistical model selection and evaluation procedure (DEMO, 1974).
If we had an objective measure (a metric) DEMO the distance between the model and the
true distribution, a good DEMO procedure ought to make this distance as small as
possible. One measure of this type is Boltzmann's (1877) generalized entropy, or the negen-
tropy which is also known as the Kullback-Leibler (1951) information DEMO Hereafter,
we refer to this as K-L information quantity for brevity.
Even though the development of AIC has its origins in time series DEMO where its
practical utility has been thoroughly studied. However, the major DEMO of AIC lies
in the direct extension of an entropic or information-theoretic interpretation of the
method of maximum likelihood. Its introduction is based on DEMO entropy maximization
principle, or minimizing its negative; it is based on the minimization of the K-L infor-
mation quantity.
To develop this point DEMO, suppose X is an absolutely continuous random vector
characterized by a DEMO density function f(x[0) which is known apart from the
K-dimensional DEMO vector 0 = 0 r = (01, 02 .... , OK), OK ~ ff~r. Assume that there
exists a true parameter vector DEMO of 0 with its probability density denoted by f(xl0*).
Within this setup, it is required that we select 0 "closest" to the true parameter vector 0".
Thus, we will measure the "DEMO," or the "goodness-of-fit," off(xl0*) with respect to
f(x I 0) by the generalized entropy B of Boltzmann (1877), or K-L information quantity I:
B(0*; 0) =
- I(0"; O).
This is defined by
B(0*; 0) = E[log f(X I
0) - log f(X I
DEMO")]
=  ftx 10,)logf(x,0)dx-
ff(x,DEMO)logf(xl0*) dx
(1)
= n(0*; 0) -- n(0*; 0"),
(2)
where E denotes the DEMO with respect to the true distribution f(xl0*) of x,
DEMO(0*; 0) = ~ f(xl0*) log f(xl0) dx is the cross-entropy which determines the goodness of
fit off(xl0) to f(xt0*), H(0*; 0") --= H(0*) the DEMO Shannon negative entropy which is
constant for a givenf(x I 0"), and where "log" means natural logarithm.
Instead of maximizing the entropy criterion (2), we minimize the K-L information
quantity:
t(0*; 0) =
- B(0*; 0)
= H(0*; 0") - H(0*; 0).
(3)
Since H(0*; 0") = H(0*) is a constant in both (2) and (3), we only have to estimate the
cross-entropy DEMO the expected log likelihood
H(0*; 0) = E[logf(X 10)]
= ff(x
0.)
I
log f(x I
o) dx.
(4)
Following Wilks (1962, p. 408), if we assume thatf(x 10) is regular with respect to its first
348 PSYCHOMETRIKA
and second partial derivatives for 0 E R r, then, under these conditions, H(0*; 0) in (4) can
DEMO differentiated twice under the integral sign with respect to 0 and evaluated at 0 = 0",
yielding
H'(0*; 0") = 0,
(5)
/-t"(0*; 0") = - DEMO(0*),
where J(0*) is the Fisher's (1922) amount of information pertaining to 0* per observation
from f(xl0*). DEMO (5), we note that Fisher's information per observation is DEMO second
derivative of the K-L information quantity. To put it another way, J(0*) essentially
measures the curvature of the expected log likelihood DEMO(0*; 0) at its maximum value
which occurs at 0 = 0". The quantity H(0*; 0) plays a crucial role DEMO the development of
AIC, and is of basic importance in statistical DEMO theory.
The analytic properties of I(0"; 0) are extensively DEMO by KuUback (1959). Here
we list some of the important DEMO
(i) I(0"; 0) > 0 wheneverf(xl0*) ~f(x[0),
(ii) I(0"; 0) = 0, if and only iff(xl0*) =f(xl0) a.e. (almost everywhere) in DEMO possi-
ble range of x, when the model is essentially true,DEMO
(iii) if X 1, X 2, ..., X n DEMO independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables, then the K-L DEMO quantity for the whole sample is
xn(0*; 0) = nl(0*; 0).
This last property says that if the random variables are independent, the K-L information
quantity is additive.
We note that K-L information quantity is perhaps the most general of all infor-
mation measures DEMO the sense of being derivable from minimal assumptions and it repre-
sents a relative measure.
As it stands, the K-L information quantity in (DEMO) is not directly observable or esti-
mable. To see this, we give the following simple example as an illustration.
Example 2.1.1. Let F DEMO the family of normal distributions {N(#, a2): --ov < DEMO < or,
0 < a 2 < ~}. Letf(xl0*) DEMO N(#*, a .2) be the true distribution with the parameter vector
0"= (~*, a,2), and let f(xlO)DEMO N(Â¢, a 2) be our model with 0 = (DEMO, tr2)-  Computing
I(0"; 0) = l[f(xl DEMO);f(x I 0)], we obtain
I o 2 (/~* - ~)2-I
/(0.; o) = ~ log \ DEMO / ~-~ ~.i _1 (6)
We see that the distance DEMO the means contributes to the K-L information quantity
quadratically; while the DEMO of the variances is through the ratio tr*2/tr 2. Further,
we note from this example, and in general, that the K-L DEMO quantity needs to be
estimated from the observed data since it depends on the true distribution, and conse-
quently on the unknown true and model parameters. The important question we need to
answer is: How can we make the K-L information quantity operationalized, or approxi-
mated, from DEMO observed data so that we can use it to compare the goodness of fit of
various models, measure the distance or deviation of the fitted model from the "true"
model?

2.2 Mean Log Likelihood as an Estimate of K-L DEMO Quantity
or Negentropy
In this section we introduce the concept of mean log likelihood as a measure for the
goodness of fit of a DEMO and state entropy maximization principle (EMP) according to
Akaike (1977)DEMO
Suppose that the generation of data is described by a model given by a probability
density function f(x]0). Given n independent observations DEMO the same distribution
regarded as a function of a vector-valued parameter, DEMO = (01, 02, ..., OK), k = t, DEMO, ..., K,
the likelihood function for the set of data is
n
L(O) =f(x 1
..... x, 10) = 1-If(x, 10).
(7)
t=1
The log likelihood function, d(0) (often called the support), is the natural logarithm DEMO L(0)
and is defined by
d(O) -- log DEMO(O) = ~. log f(x~ I
0),
(8)DEMO
i=l
regarded as a random variable, is the sum of i.i.d, random variables log f(xtlO), i = I, 2,
..., n.
We define the average or mean log likelihood of the sample by
_1 d(0) =
n
= :.(0),
(DEMO)
which can be interpreted as an estimator of the "distance" between the true probability
densityf(x I 0") and the modelf(DEMO 10).
As we discussed in the previous section, the K-L DEMO quantity is not observ-
able. However, it can be consistently estimated DEMO the observed data and oper-
ationalized.
Let ]'(0"; 0) denote an estimator of the K-L information quantity I(0"; 0)DEMO Then (3)
becomes

(10)
or
R(0*, 0) -- --I(0"; e) +/7(0*; e*).
(I1)
This tells DEMO that maximizing the expected log likelihood /~(8"; 0) is asymptotically
equivalent to minimizing the K-L information quantity, ~0", 0), and it is not necessary to
know/7(0*; 0") =/7(0"), since it is an additive constant and can be dropped. However,
we will retain it for the clarity of our DEMO
Assuming that a sample of n observations x = (xx, x 2 ..... x~) is used to provide an
estimate 0 = 6(x) of 0, we observe that the mean log likelihood in (9) is a natural esti-
mator of/-7(0*; e), DEMO expected log likelihood. That is,
Z(0) ~ EI1 d(DEMO)l =/~(0"; 0)= E[log f(X 10)],
(12)
where again the expectation is taken relative to the true distributionf(x ] 0") of x, and that
the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) 0 is a natural estimator for 0", DEMO (10) can then

or

(14)
Certainly, one approach to measure DEMO well the maximum likelihood modelf(xi I(})
"matches" the data would be to test the hypothesis that the K-L information quantity
DEMO(0"; 0) = 0. Such a test might be based DEMO (n)X/2r(0*; 6), but establishing the asymptotic
closed form expression of the distribution of this statistic is a nontrivial problem (White,
1982). It is for this reason that we need DEMO appeal to the asymptotic behavior of the mean
log likelihood and also to asymptotic approximations to derive AIC.
From Property (ii) in section DEMO, we have seen that 1(0"; 0)= 0, if and only if,
f(xl0*) =f(xl0) a.e. in the DEMO range of x, when the model is essentially true. Hence,
DEMO (9), we note that asymptotically the maximum of :~(0) = 1/n log/_,(0) (the mean log
likelihood) will be H(0*) --= S f(x I 0") log f(x I 0") dx, the negative Shannon entropy, and
DEMO will be attained when f(x[0*) =f(x [0) a.e. This result can also be obtained from the
property of the function z(DEMO) or/7(0"; 0), the expected log likelihood in (12) which is: z(0)
or//(0"; 0) attains its maximum value at 0 = 0", and if distributions DEMO the sample space
corresponding to different parameters are essentially different, then DEMO no other 0 is z(0)
equal to z(0*) (Silvey, 1975, p. 74).
Since our estimation of K-L information DEMO is based on the mean log likeli-
hood (which is also DEMO estimate of the expected log likelihood), and since the maximum
likelihood estimates are biased, then there is the inevitable risk of error of estimation of
the K-L information quantity when the maximum likelihood estimators of DEMO parameters
of the model is used.
In the case where 0 is a real parameter, for large n, we depict the general behav-
DEMO exhibited by the mean log likelihood 1/n:(O) and the expected log likelihood z(O)=
E[1/n:(O)] = E[log f(X [ O)] in Figure 2.1.
From Figure 2.1, we see that /-7(0*; 0) assumes its maximum value at 0", and that
1/n:(O) is uniformly near /-7(0*; 0) ensures that 1/nÂ¢(O) assumes its maximum value at a
point near 0", that is, O(x) near 0* DEMO discussed in Silvey (1975). In other words, for finite
n, we would like to have the observed values of the mean log likelihood (dashed lines) to
behave like the theoretical points (solid line) of Figure 2.1. To achieve this, the bias
introduced by the DEMO likelihood estimates of the parameters needs to be adjusted
or corrected.
Empirical justification of the behavior of the mean log likelihood plotted against the
DEMO of parameters are illustrated in detail by Atilgan (1983), and DEMO and Bozdo-
gan (1987) in smoothing and density estimation under various basis functions including
those of B-splines, normal kernels, and logistic density DEMO
Since the quantity H(0*; 0) is not directly observable, DEMO of the mean log
likelihood is carried out, and asymptotically an DEMO estimator of the mean expected
log likelihood is searched by correcting the bias of the observed mean log likelihood, En(6).
Indeed, DEMO defining AIC, Akaike (â¢973, 1974) has exactly this consideration of the bias

by penalizing extra parameters when the maximum likelihood estimates are used DEMO
estimating the expected log likelihood by the mean log likelihood.
Now we are in a position to give the definition of entropy maximization principle
DEMO by Akaike (1977) which is quite different from (and should DEMO be confused
with) Jayne's (1957) maximum entropy principle.
Definition DEMO: Entropy maximization principle (EMP). Formulate the object of statis-
tical inference as the estimation of the true distributionf(x I 0") DEMO the data x = (x 1, x 2 ,
.... DEMO,) and try to search for an approximate model f(xl0) DEMO will maximize expected
entropy:
Ex[B(O*; 0)] = f DEMO(O*; O)f(x I
0") dx
= ExrH(O*; 0)1
= Ex{E[logf(XlO)] }.
Equivalently, we minimize the expected K-L information quantity.
(15)
Large expected log likelihood E[logf(XI0)] means large entropy, and it also means
that the model f(xl0) is a good fit to f(xl0*), or, equivalently, the low value of I(0"; 0)
means that the model DEMO(x t 0) is a good fit to f(x I DEMO"). Thus, it is by the mean of B(0*; DEMO),
1(0"; 0), or the mean expected log DEMO over the sampling distribution of the esti-
mator of 0 that we will judge a particular model and measure our ignorance about the
true DEMO of the model.
This definition will play an important role in that, since entropy or negentropy is
nothing but a log odds ratio between the fitted model f(x t0) and the true distribution
f(xl0*), it can be used as a loss function, and its expected value can be used as a risk
function to measure the average DEMO error of the fitted model from the true one as
suggested by Akaike (1973).
Next, we derive AIC in detail as a DEMO sample estimate of E[logf(XI0)], the
expected log likelihood.

Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) DEMO an Estimate of Negentropy
Suppose that we have a general model f(. 10) from which all the K competing
models are generated by simply restricting the general parameter vector 0. In terms of the
parameters, we represent the full model with K parameters by
MODEL(K): DEMO(. [0),
0 =
O r
= (01, 02 DEMO Ok, Ok+l ..... Or).
(16)
We denote the "DEMO" value of the parameter vector 0 by 0* with 0* e DEMO ~. Following
Akaike (1973), the problem of statistical model identification DEMO be formulated as the
problem of selecting a model f(x 10k) based on n observations. In terms of parameters, Ok
is restricted DEMO the space with O + 1 = Ok+ 2 ..... O K = 0, or equal to a prescribed value
of 0 k , and that a particular restricted model with k parameters is given by
DEMO(k): f(. 10k), Ok = (01, 02 ..... Ok, 0, 0
..... 0).
(17)
Often k, DEMO number of free parameters of MODEL(k), is called the dimension or order of
the model. If werepresent parametric estimation geometrically in terms DEMO a Euclidean
projection shown in Figure 3.1, we denote the maximum DEMO estimate of O r by Or
both of which lie in R r (the K-dimensional Euclidean space). We let 0* denote the true
parameter vector with 0 e R x, and define 0~' as DEMO parameter vector of the best fitting or
approximating mbdel with 0f ~ R ~ (k-dimensional parametric subspace R k of the original
space Rr). We note that the parameter vector 0f is the projection of DEMO true parameter
vector O* in the subspace R k. Next, we DEMO 0 k denote the restricted maximum likelihood
estimator of Ok of MODEL(k) which lies in R ~, and which is also the DEMO of 0x in
R k. Thus, geometrically (0f- Ok) will DEMO our random error. It can be viewed
k
353
HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN
approximately as the projection of (0" - 0x) into the subspace ~k. On the other hand,
(0" - DEMO') is deterministic and is the bias due to selecting an approximate parameter space.
To elaborate further, following Clergeot (1984), if for DEMO values of k, subspaces
R k are chosen so that R DEMO c R k+l, the bias, which is the distance of 0* to the subspace R k,
is a nonincreasing function of k, while the random error increases monotonically with k.
Thus, our goal here will be to find some optimal value of k so that the DEMO
between bias and random error will give the smallest estimation error.
The AIC statistic which we next state in the form of a proposition DEMO sketch its
derivation is designed to approximate the real model by a lower dimensional model so as
to minimize the average estimation error.
Proposition DEMO: Akaike's information criterion (AIC): Let {Mk: k = DEMO, 2 ..... K} be a set
of competing models indexed by DEMO = 1, 2, ..., K. Then the criterion
AIC(k) = -2 log L(0k) + 2k, (18)
which is minimized to choose a model M k over the set of models DEMO a natural sample
estimator of twice the negentropy, 2E[I(0*; Ok)'] , or minus twice the expected log likeli-
hood, - DEMO f(X I Ok)], of the true distribution with respect DEMO a model with the param-
eters determined by the method of maximum likelihood.
Proof. Following Akaike (1973, 1974, 1976), and Kitagawa (DEMO), we first assume a
model which specifies a probability density function f(xlOk) of n observations with a free
parameter vector O and then find the MLE 0 k of 0 k with O e DEMO k by maximizing the
likelihood function
L(Ok IX) = L(DEMO Ix1, x2 ..... xn) ---- l~I f(xilOk) , (19)
i=1
with respect to O k . By taking the natural DEMO of the likelihood function, and divid-
ing by the sample size DEMO, we get
l(0k ) _----1 log C(0k I x) =--1 ~ log f(x, I Ok), (20)
n DEMO n i=l
the average or mean log likelihood which is a natural consistent estimator of
E[logf(XI0k) ] = f 1ogf(xl0k)f(xl0k) dx, (21)
the expected log likelihood.
Since the purpose of estimating the parameters of the true model f(xl0*) is to base
our decision onf(x 16) where 0 -= 0r is an estimate of 0", then the discussion in section 2
suggests the use DEMO K-L inform~ion quantity

Ex[l(0* ; DEMO)] = f I(0"; 0)f(x I 0") dx (23)

As shown in Figure 3.1, we next restrict 0 to lie in k-dimensional restricted parameter
space, O k, while the true parameter vector, 0*, lies in DEMO K-dimensional full parameter
space t~ K, where k < K. Denoting DEMO 0* the projection of 0* onto O k and using the
maximum likelihood estimate Ok  of 0* in O k, we have

Equation (30) represents the overall risk of statistical modeling which measures DEMO
extent to which Ok deviates from the true parameter vector 0". As we note, it is composed
of two components; one which DEMO 6 = n tl 0* - 01' 112, is the error or bias due to
selecting an approximate parameter space for the restricted DEMO space for 0*, and

may not be defined clearly. Even under such circumstances we DEMO limited number of
k's, assuming K to be equal to DEMO larger hypothesized value of k. Since we are only
concerned with finding out the Ok  which will give the minimum of ~(rr; DEMO) in (39), or

and choose the minimum of AIC over k = 1, 2 ..... K.
This completes the derivation of AIC and the sketch of the proof of the proposition.
DEMO
We note that AIC(k) in (41) is an unbiased DEMO of minus twice the mean
expected log likelihood, or equivalently -Â½ DEMO(k) is asymptotically an unbiased esti-
mator of the mean expected DEMO likelihood. This result suggests that asymptotically a
reasonable definition of the likelihood of a model is
L(k) = exp {-- Â½ AIC(k)} (k = 1, 2 ..... K). (42)
In fact, with the assumption of equal prior probability for the models, DEMO distribution of
(42) defines the posterior distribution of models. If there are several models with almost
equal values of AIC, it is useful to consider the averaged model by using (42) as the
"likelihood" of each model as discussed in Akaike (1978, 1979).
We interpret the result in (41) as follows. The first term in (41) is a measure of
inaccuracy, badness of fit, or bias when the maximum likelihood estimators of the param-
eters of the model DEMO used. The second term, on the other hand, is a measure of
complexity or the penalty due to the increased unreliability or compensation DEMO the bias
in the first term which depends upon the number of parameters used to fit the data.
Thus, when there are several competing models the parameters within the models are
estimated by the method of DEMO likelihood and the values of the AIC's are com-
puted and compared to find a model with the minimum value of AIC. This DEMO is
called the minimum AIC procedure and the model with the minimum AIC is called the
minimum AIC estimate (MAICE) and is chosen DEMO be the best model. Therefore, for us the
best model is DEMO one with least complexity, or equivalently, the highest information gain.
In applying AIC, the emphasis is on comparing the goodness of fit of various models with
an allowance made for parsimony.
4. Consistent Akaike's DEMO Criterion: CAIC(k)
As we saw in the derivation of DEMO in the previous section, one of the important
virtues of AIC DEMO the penalty represented by the term 2 x (number of free DEMO)
clearly demonstrates the necessity of choosing a class of models, DEMO least one of which will
be able to provide a good approximation to the distribution of the data without adjusting
too many parameters. However, in the literature, the particular specifications put on the
crucial structure-dependent term in AIC, that is, the so-called "magic number" 2, has been
HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN
357
questioned unfairly as being coincidental or arbitrary (Rissanen, DEMO). If one follows the
derivation of AIC in section 3, DEMO emergence of the magic number 2 is hardly debatable.
The debating questions should be: Is the magic number 2 enough, should it be DEMO
than 2, how do we choose such a number, or on what does it depend, and so forth?
Based on the frequency of choice of the correct model from a simulation study, many
authors, including Bhansali and Downham (1977), in a time series model, arbitrarily
considered the range of the magic number to be between 1 DEMO 4. The propriety of such a
choice has been criticized by both Akaike (1979) and Atkinson (1980) on the grounds of
lack DEMO objectivity and the need for more explicit analytical formulation.
Objections have been raised that minimizing AIC does not produce an asymp-
totically consistent estimate DEMO model order (Bhansali and Downham, 1977; Schwarz,
1978; Woodroofe, 1982; and others). However, consistency is an asymptotic property, DEMO
any real problem has a finite sample size n as stated in Sclove (1987). Certainly, from a
mathematical point of view, consistency is an attractive asymptotic property to expect
from a model selection procedure, but any consideration of consistency presupposes that
there exist "true" order DEMO a model. In the case of real data, the concept of DEMO true order is
not known and is suspect.
Even though the AIC procedure is not claimed to be consistent and is not designed
to DEMO such (Akaike, 1981b; Quinn, 1980), its inconsistency is not necessarily a defect in the
method, and the virtue of consistency should not be exaggerated (Hannah, 1986). Shibata
(1983) extensively studied DEMO asymptotic behavior of AIC procedure and its variants in
terms of asymptotic efficiency under a quadratic loss function. He found that AIC actually
achieves DEMO implicit goal that motivated Akaike--it does the best that any model-
selection procedure can do in minimizing negentropy, or the expected log likelihood, DEMO
least for a large sample size n (Larimore & Mehra, 1985).
In general, the major dilemma here is how to balance optimally the underfitting and
overfitting risks, or how to optimally adjust the bias in the log likelihood ratio when the
maximum likelihood estimates are used.
DEMO violating Akaike's principles, using the established results in mathematical
statistics, we improve and extend AIC analytically in two ways. These extensions make
DEMO asymptotically consistent, and that we penalize overparameterization more strin-
gently to DEMO the simplest of the true models whenever there is nothing to be lost in
doing so.
In section 2.2, we discussed the fact that when the mean log likelihood is used to
estimate the K-L information DEMO, the bias introduced by the maximum likelihood
estimates of the parameters DEMO to be adjusted or corrected. In the derivation of AIC,
this bias comes out as a noncentrality parameter, 6, which is a DEMO large unknown but
deterministic constant. It depends not only on the number of observations but also the
specific estimation method used. For example, in our case this method is the maximum
likelihood (ML) method. Moreover, the distributional change in 6 for different sample
sizes is also crucial DEMO justify the correction of the bias further. That is, we do DEMO want to
have a very large 6, since it varies with DEMO basic model. As is well known, noncentrality
parameters determine the power DEMO test procedures, and the estimation of 6 on the basis of
DEMO data may be necessary to choose among competing models.
We note from (35) that one such correction in 6 is already given in DEMO AIC, that
is, 6 - -2 log 2 - (K DEMO k). Also we note that this correction factor v = (DEMO - k) is inde-
pendent of the sample size n. However, in testing a null hypothesis (or a model) dis-
tinguished from DEMO alternative hypothesis (or hypotheses) by the value of a parameter, DEMO
the test statistic has a noncentral chi-square distribution which is the case here, then the
358
PSYCHOMETRIKA
degrees of freedom is an increasing function of the sample DEMO n (Kendall & Stuart, 1967).
This suggests that to make AIC consistent, the multiplier of the number of free parame-
ters in the penalty term must be made to depend on the sample size DEMO setting
v = a(nXK - k),
(43)
where a(n) is an increasing function of n. In AIC, we DEMO that a(n) = 1. As discussed in
Davis and Vinter (1985), the selection of the function a(n) is important, DEMO it should be
chosen so that it has various desirable properties for the corresponding estimates. Recap-
itulating Davis and Vinter (1985), the properties of a(n) which might be required are:
(i) high probability of choosing the correct dimension of the model, or order for finite
data sets; and
(ii) consistency, that is, asymptotically correct choice of k as n--} ~,
Presently, in the literature there is no theory available as to how to choose the
correct dimension DEMO a model with high probability. On the other hand, consistency holds
DEMO surely for certain choices of a(n) including the choice a(DEMO) = log n, where "log"
denotes the natural logarithm. DEMO, we choose a(n)= !og n since it provides a
DEMO increasing function of the sample size n, such that a(n)/n---, 0 as n---} oo (see
also, e.g., Akaike, 1978). We shall denote this type of modified AIC by a generic DEMO,
CAIC. So if we take v = (K - k) log n, then we have the following proposition.
Proposition 2.
CAIC(k) = -2 log L(6k) + k[(log n) + 1].
(44)
Since CAIC estimates the

Proof. Recall from (30) that

Since

and since v = (DEMO - k) log n, then

Since the constants do not effect the results of comparison of DEMO, we drop the additive
terms and reduce the form of CAIC(DEMO) to a much simpler form, namely
CAIC(k) = -2 DEMO L(Ok) + kl-(log n) + 1].
[]
(50)DEMO
This shows that AIC can be fairly easily extended to make it consistent, even though
a practical difficulty is that consistency is a weak property (Atkinson, 1980). Note that
CAIC(k) is similar to the Schwarz's (1978) Criterion of k log n, and that the term
[k log n + k] has the effect of increasing DEMO "penalty term." Consequently, the mini-
HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN 359
mization of CAIC leads, in general, to lower DEMO models than those obtained by
minimizing AIC.
In the literature, Hannan DEMO Quinn (1979) proposed a(n) = c log log n, where c > 2.
Their objective was to provide a consistent criterion DEMO which a(n) increases with n but at
as slow a DEMO as possible. If we let k < k(n), where k is an upper bound of k, possibly
depending on n, other DEMO of a(n) are:
a(n) = (log n) l+b and k(n) = (log n) c, (51)
where b and c are arbitrary strictly positive constants.
Next, we give yet another analytical extension of AIC which will unify all these
procedures.
DEMO Consistent AIC with Fisher Information: CAICF(k)
In this section, exploiting the large sample asymptotic distributional properties of the
maximum likelihood estimators, we propose a different estimator for minus twice the
expected entropy to DEMO AIC analytically to make it consistent without deviating from
Akaike's original premise. In this manner we penalize overparameterization more
strongly, in particular, DEMO large samples. Therefore, instead of dropping the term
2 log L(DEMO) in (38) as we do in simplifying the expression to DEMO a simple form for AIC,
we retain this term and propose a different approximation to L(Or) which estimates the
likelihood function L(0*) of the true model. This means that one can specify the true
model to be the most general of the models to be DEMO and consider the fact that the
observations are generated by the true density f(xl0* ) instead off(xl0~). This way we
can DEMO the unknown parameters of the true and approximate models by using the
maximum likelihood estimators and their properties, and obtain the following proposi-
tion.
Proposition 3.
CAICF(k) = -2 log L(Ok) + k[(DEMO n) + 2] + log I J(0k) l
-- mIf(k) + k log n + log I J(0k) l. (52)
To show the derivation of this proposition, we consider x i.i.d., and we assume that
the true parameter vector 0* satisfies the restrictions set by the following model in terms
of the parameters:
DEMO(k): Ok  = (01, 02 ..... O k, 0, .... 0), (53)
and that Ok* -- 0k = DEMO(n- 1/2), where O denotes the "order of."
DEMO the properties of the maximum likelihood estimates for regular models, it DEMO
well known that the MLE Ok of 0~' is, at least asymptotically, a sufficient statistic for 0~'.
This can be shown easily by the factorization theorem of the likelihood of the kind to
establish DEMO (Cox & Hinkley, 1974). Assuming that 0 k is at least asymptotically
sufficient for 0~, under this assumption, it is easy DEMO establish the following theorem for
asymptotic normality.
Theorem 1. A maximum likelihood estimator Ok is asymptotically distributed as
multivariate normal with mean vector 0f DEMO covariance matrix (n J)- 1. That is,
a.d.

So the asymptotic multivariate normal density of Ok  is given by

exp {

(55)
where Ok is the maximum DEMO estimate of 0* and inverse covaraince matrix is

where d(e*) is the Fisher information matrix at 0* with DEMO to one observation.
(56)
For large samples, we approximate the likelihood off(x 10*) the true density at 0* by
L(e*; 0k) = O(e*)L(0*) = O(0*) exp DEMO L(0*)}, using Taylor series expansion of 9(0*) and
exp {log L(0*)} around the ML estimate Ok . Taking DEMO product of two Taylor series
expansions and using the leading terms, DEMO obtain
L(O*; Ok) - (nk I

(57)
DEMO, using asymptotic sufficiency, we can write
L(0*) = h(DEMO)C(0*; Ok)
(58)
by the factorization criterion, DEMO h(x) is independent of the particular parameter vector
0 we DEMO, and the second factor L(0*; Ok) depends on x DEMO through the value of
Ok  - 0k(X), which is DEMO for 0".
Now, in (38) we replace L(OK) by L(0,) given in (58) assuming that 0* (the true
parameter vector) is situated near 0" (the restricted or pseudotrue parameter vector) and it
"almost" satisfies the restrictions set in (DEMO) and get
kt/K = --2 log L(fik) + 2 log L(O*).
(59)
So, from (58) and (57), we have
log L(0,) = log h(x) + log L(0*; Ok)
k k
= log h(x) + ~ log n + x2  log I J(ODI - DEMO log (21t)
-- Â½(0 k -
a*)'nJ(a*)(O k -- 0") + log [1 + O(n- x/z)].
(60)
Now, multiplying both sides of (60) DEMO 2, we get
2 log L(0*) = 2 log h(x) + k log n + log I
J(0*)l-k log (2n)
-- (O
k -- Ok)nJ(O

(61)
Since log [1 + O(n-1/DEMO)] is about of order n-a/2, since (e* - Ok) is of order n-x/2,
nd(O*) is of order DEMO, which implies (O k -0~,')'nJ(0*)(0k- 0,) is of order O(1), then (61)
reduces to
2 log L(0*) = 2 log h(x) + k DEMO n + log I
J(0*)l -k log (2x) + O(n-I/2).
(62)
Thus, the approximation involves an DEMO of order n-x/2.
In Equation (62), by ignoring the DEMO terms, the term involving x, and O(n-x/2),
DEMO have
2 log L(O*) = k log n + log DEMO(O*)l.
(63)
HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN
361
Hence, (59) reduces to
~K = --2 log L(0k) + k log n + log I
J(0*)l
(64)
Now estimating J(0*) by J(Ok) in (DEMO) where O k is the MLE of Ok*,
result into (38), we obtain
and substituting the
2nE[l(O*; Ok)'] DEMO --2 log L(Ok)
+ k log n + log I
J(0~)I + 2k - K
= --2 log L(0k) + k[(log n) + 2] + log I
J(0~)I - g.
(65)
Simplifying (65) further, we have
= DEMO(k) + k log n + log I
J(0k) l.
J(0k) l
(66)
We note that if we take DEMO first two terms in (66), CAICF is similar to CAIC DEMO
section 4, and also Schwarz's criterion (SC, 1978).
DEMO, this way, without relying on the arbitrary frequency of choice of the correct
model to modify AIC heuristically, we can analytically extend AIC to make it consistent.
In this manner we penalize the overparameterization more DEMO, in particular, for
large samples. Note that we have not deviated from Akaike's original principle: we are
still estimating minus twice the expected entropy. Also, note that we have not followed a
Bayesian approach.
The incorporation of the Fisher information matrix J(Ok) within the penalty compo-
nent of CAICF has many practical and theoretical importance. Generally, when we are
using model-selection criteria, we fit the models under a specified parametric probability
distribution of the model. The correct specification of the probability DEMO is a sufficient,
but by no means a necessary condition. For example, even when the true distribution is
not normal, we still DEMO the maximum likelihood estimators under the assumption of
normality which yields consistent estimates of the mean and the variance. But it is the
consistency DEMO the mean log likelihood which ensures us the basis for robust estimation,
and that it provides us the basis for constructing specification tests. DEMO, we need to
check or test first whether the probability model DEMO misspeeified or not before we actually
fit and evaluate the models. This is very important in practice which is often ignored. For
this reason, following White (1982), we give a simple test of information matrix equivalence
to check the misspecification of a model. First, we define the following matrices
CAICF(k) = -2 log L(0g) + kE(DEMO n) + 2] + log I

When the appropriate inverses exist, we define
Cn(O*) DEMO J.(Ok*) - 1 Rn(Ok*)J~(Ok*) - 1 ---- Jn- 1 R. J~- 1,
(69)
C(0*)= ,DEMO j(Ok) R(Ok)J(O , k) ,-1 - DEMO IRj 1,
where J(0*) is the Fisher's information DEMO which is positive-definite, and C(0*) is the
covariance matrix. When the model is correctly specified and certain assumptions hold as
in White (1982, p. 6), we have the following result.
Theorem 2: DEMO matrix equivalence. If f (x)-f(xt0*) for 0* in f~r, then
0* = 0~' and J(0*) = R(0~'), so that the covariance C(0~') = J(0~')- DEMO = R(0~')- 1
Note that, in general, J(DEMO) will not equal R(0~') when the model is misspecified.
DEMO, when the model is correctly specified, then this theorem says that the infor-
mation matrix can be expressed in either Hessian form, J(0*), or outer product form,
R(0*), giving equivalently,DEMO
J(O*) -- R(O*) = O. (70)
The DEMO in (70) is not directly observable, but we can consistently DEMO it by
J(Ok) -- g(Ok) = 0, (71)
and construct an appropriate test statistic to test whether a model DEMO or not.
For example, if the equality in (71) fails, then this indicates that the probability model is
misspecified. In practice, this misspecification may have many serious consequences when
the classical inferential procedures are DEMO Furthermore, the failure of information
matrix equivalence might also indicate misspecifications DEMO render the MLE to be
inconsistent for particular parameters of interest. Therefore, (71) is a useful indicator of
misspecifications which cause either parameter or covariance matrix estimator inconsist-
ency.
If we find that J(0k), the estimated information matrix, is singular (or nearly singular)
and so indefinite, we have an indication that the K-L information quantity has no unique
minimum at 0", the true parameter vector. Therefore, CAICF as a large sample asymp-
totic estimator of the mean K-L information DEMO will not have a unique minimum
also. Furthermore, this in practice DEMO that there are parameter vectors 0 Â¢ 0* such
that the expected mean log likelihood z(0) = z(0*) given in (12), and this in turn means
that there are different parameters yielding DEMO same distribution so that 0 is not identifia-
ble. Thus, lack DEMO identifiability of 0 implies singularity of information matrix and vice
versa (DEMO, 1975, p. 82). Near singularity of the information matrix will also give us an
indication of high variances for the estimators which DEMO not preferred. In either case, the
parameters may not be estimated DEMO any high degree of accuracy. In this respect, one
advantage of DEMO CAICF in (66) is that it generalizes and unifies model selection
procedures, and that, whenever possible, one should compute J(Ok), test whether the
model is correctly specified or not, and then proceed with model fitting and evaluation.
Indeed, if we cannot achieve a unique minimum by using CAICF, then this should be an
indication that we have problems in identifying the parameters. In that case, we should
bring in a priori information in order to impose restrictions on the model DEMO tackle the
problem with reparametrizing the model.
As discussed in Sclove (DEMO), Kashyap (1982), taking the Bayesian approach, took
the asymptotic expansion of the logarithm of the posterior probabilities a term further
HAMPARSUM BOZDOGAN
363
than did Schwarz (1978) and obtained the criterion DEMO given by
KC(k) = -2 log L({Jk)

(72)
where f(0~') is the prior probability DEMO on the parameter vector 0~'. B((Jk) is the
negative of the matrix of second partials of log L(0k), evaluated DEMO the maximum likeli-
hood estimates. In Gaussian linear models, this is DEMO covariance matrix of the maximum
likelihood estimates of the regression coefficient; DEMO general, the expectation of B({Jk),
evaluated at the true parameter values, is Fisher's information matrix. If we assume equal
probabilities for f(0*), the term togf(0~') in (72) DEMO be ignored, and thus we can see the
relationship between KC DEMO our extension of AIC, i.e., the CAICF given in (66)DEMO Similar
results are also given in Haughton (1983) by extending the Schwarz's criterion for ex-
ponential families a term further than did DEMO

Asymptotic Properties and Inferential Error Rates of the Criteria
It is well known that the classical theory of hypothesis testing is concerned with DEMO
problem: Is a given observation consistent with some stated hypothesis or DEMO it not? In the
hypothesis testing tradition, frequently ignoring power considerations, we choose an arbi-
trary significance level ~, for example, the celebrated 5%, 2.5%, or 1%, and then we try to
determine (at least approximately) a critical value from the standard tables of DEMO test
procedures to make our decision. Almost automatically, we also apply DEMO hypothesis
testing procedures to the situation where actually multiple decision procedures are re-
quired. However, this involves the choice of a number of dependent significance levels
without knowing what the overall error rate might be. Also, test procedures do not have
the provision to penalize overparameterization since usually DEMO unstructured saturated
model is always used as a reference (Akaike, 1987).
On the other hand, when we use the information-theoretic model selection criteria,
we do not specify what the arbitrary significance level ~ DEMO be or ought to be. This is
due to the fact that in using model selection criteria, the situation is totally the opposite of
the classical inferential procedures. In this case, we are concerned with: DEMO a
critical value which then determines, approximately, what the significance level is or
might be. Therefore, the significance level is implicitly incorporated within the model
selection criteria which depends on the specific functional form of DEMO penalty component
of the criteria and on the number of observations.
In general, for model selection criteria, the inferential error rate decreases exponen-
DEMO as we increase n, the number of observations. Following Efron (1967), suppose we
are given n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) DEMO x 1, x 2 ..... x, of a
random variable X having probability density functionf(x). Suppose we are asked to test

(78)
So, following ~encov (1982, p. 122), we state the following:
DEMO 4. For a specified fl, 0 < fl < 1, under the null hypothesis in (73), we have
~t(fl) = DEMO I error} = exp {-nI + O(1)}.
(79)
DEMO means that both 0t and fl cannot tend to zero faster than the exponential rate
where lim,_.~ 0(1) = 0. Thus, DEMO example, ~t is small when the K-L information quantity
is large, and vice versa. This rate of convergence to zero of ct can DEMO be used as a
criterion for evaluating the asymptotic performance of the information-theoretic pro-
cedures. Typically, for consistent criterion, this rate is exponential DEMO stated in the above
theorems.
To show the Type I error for AIC and CAIC, suppose that the "true' dimension is
obtained when k = k*. We consider what happens to the probability of choosing DEMO
dimension k' > k* asymptotically by these criteria.
For AIC, this means
P{AIC(k') < AIC(k*)}
= P{2[log L(Ok, ) -- log L(Ok,)] > 2(k' -- k*)DEMO
-+ P{Ztk,-k*) > 2(k' -- k*)}
as n-+ oo

For CAIC, this means

Therefore, using AIC it is possible to choose a dimenison k' > k* (the true dimen-
sion), the probability DEMO Type I error stays positive but decreases exponentially as
(k' - k*) gets larger and the critical value (i.e., 2) of DEMO test remains finite n ~ oo. So, even
asymptotically, there is a positive probability of overestimating the true dimension or the
size of DEMO model. Therefore, model selection criteria, including AIC, which have this
DEMO are often called dimension inconsistent. On the other hand, with CAIC DEMO
CAICF, the probability of Type I error goes to zero as DEMO oo. It also decreases exponen-
tially as (k'-k*) gets larger, but at a much faster rate. Therefore, asymptotically, the
probability of overestimating the true dimenson or size of the model with these criteria
DEMO zero, making them dimension consistent. (For more on the properties of model
selection criteria, we refer the reader to Ter~isvirta & Mellin, DEMO; and Woodroofe, 1982.)
Without going into detailed proofs, we DEMO state the following results.
Result 1. Using CAIC or CAICF if k' < k*, where k* is the true dimension of the
model, the probability of underfitting a model goes to zero as n---~ oo.
DEMO 2. Using CAIC or CAICF if k' > k*, the probability of overfitting a model
disappears as n ~ ~.
Note that when DEMO use AIC, CAIC, and CAICF, the "level of significance" DEMO adjusted
in such a way that the corresponding probability of rejection of the simpler model
decreases as the degrees of freedom or complexity increase. DEMO procedures, therefore,
have tendencies to adopt simpler models compared with DEMO chi-square test procedure as
the degrees of freedom increase. Comparing to AIC, for CAIC, the implied ~ values
rapidly decrease as the degrees DEMO freedom increase. The same is also true for CAICF.
However, this DEMO of decrease depends on n, the number of observations. For large
DEMO, as the degrees of freedom increase, the implied ~ values for these criteria decrease
very sharply.
This connection between model selection criteria and DEMO level of significance ~,
provides us a way to test the validity of different restrictions of a model. Also, it gives us a
yardstick in comparing every possible model and choosing the model giving the DEMO
probability of rejection to be the best fitting model. This fact justifies the comparison of
the model selection criteria in a class of models DEMO cannot necessarily be compared by
the classical goodness of fit test. We can use these results to decide what the level of
significance should DEMO per complexity or restriction when we do classical hypothesis
testing rather than arbitrarily deciding what ct should be on a priori grounds. Thus, in the
sense of Theorem 3 and 4, these model selection procedures can be called inferential-error-
rate consistent.
7. A Numerical Example
In this section, to demonstrate the practical utility and to show the empirical per-
formances DEMO the model selection criteria, we provide a Monte Carlo example in DEMO
ing the degree of a polynomial model in one variable. Choosing the degree of a poly-
nomial model is a major problem that arises DEMO the relationship between y and x is
considered to be curvilinear. Fitting a polynomial with the maximum degree K is a
multiple decision problem DEMO is often formulated in terms of a sequential hypothesis
testing to test whether the coefficients are zero, starting with the highest specified degree.
Following Graybill (1976), we consider the polynomial model of degree K given by
Yi = flo + fllx~ + f12 X2 --I- "'" DEMO flK Xi
K .4- e i = 1, 2, ..., DEMO > K + 1,

where K is a specified positive integer. We assume that the degree of DEMO polynomial
model in (82), say k, is less than or equal to K (given), and the problem is to determine the
exact degree. As we mentioned, the procedure is to test the hypothesis Ho:/~ = 0, then
test ilK- 1 = 0, then test ilK- 2 = 0, and so on against the alternative of nonzero coefficient
until a hypothesis is rejected. Suppose /~k = 0 is the first hypothesis that is rejected, then
we declare that the model of degree k is the correct model. If no H 0 is DEMO, then we
declare the simple model Yi = flo + e~ DEMO the correct model.
It has been shown by Anderson (1962) that this procedure for determining the degree
of a polynomial model has some DEMO optimality properties. However, as we know,
application of test procedures DEMO such multiple-decision problems involves the choice of a
number of dependent significance levels. This creates the problem of how to control the
overall error DEMO of the test procedures for determining the correct degree of a poly-
nomial model. As an alternative to the classical inferential procedures, here we propose
the use of model selection procedures to determine the degree of DEMO polynomial model.
To demonstrate this, we carried out a Monte Carlo DEMO under the true cubic
polynomial model given by
y = 1 + 5x-- 1.25x

where it is assumed that e DEMO N(0, a2). In the first design of the Monte DEMO study, we
both varied n, the number of observations, and DEMO 2, the residual variance simultaneously
across three different experiments in choosing DEMO correct degree of k = 3, and in studying
the relative DEMO of AIC, CAIC, and CAICF by fitting the polynomial models of
degree ranging from 1 to 6. In the second design of the DEMO Carlo study, we increased
the residual variance a 2, but kept it the same and varied the sample size n across three
different DEMO in studying the relative performances of AIC, CAIC, and CAICF.
All the computations are carried out using our POLYREG algorithm in double
precision DEMO one of the PRIME 750 computers of the University of Virginia. The results
are given in Table 7.1 and 7.2 as follows.
Looking at DEMO 7.1, we see that AIC has the tendency to overfit the DEMO degree
of the polynomial as the sample size n gets large and the residual variance 62 varies. This
suggests that a stronger penalty for DEMO complexity could be beneficial as we discussed
before. For CAIC, there DEMO to be a slight tendency to overfit the correct degree of the
polynomial model, but this is very insignificant. On the other hand, DEMO all the three

experiments, the condition for the consistency of order determination by CAICF holds
perfectly.
Looking at Table 7.2, we note that the results are different from that of Table 7.1.
This is due to the DEMO that we increased the residual variance t72 to 5 in 100 replications of
the Monte Carlo Experiment. For n = 50, AIC and CAIC are performing much better
than CAICF in choosing the correct degree (k = 3) of the polynomial model. In fact, the
proportion of DEMO for CAICF is 77%. However, for CAICF, the underfitting
diminishes as n, the sample size, gets large and the condition of consistency DEMO These
results suggest that when n is small and residual variance ~2 is large, CAICF might have
the tendency to underfit the true order of a polynomial model. But, as we saw, this
behavior of DEMO disappears as n gets large. We emphasize the fact that this was the
only extreme example for CAICF when n = 50 among many DEMO of the Monte
Carlo experiment.
Overall, we observe that AIC, CAIC, and CAICF are powerful tools to determine the
best fitting model. They are superior to classical inferential methods in terms of their
computational simplicity, in terms of not arbitrarily specifying a significance level ~, and
not worrying what the overall inferential error rate might be or ought to DEMO in determin-
ing the degree of a polynomial model, and in DEMO
8.
Conclusions and Discussion
In this paper, we studied the general DEMO of the AIC procedure, presented its
mathematical derivation and showed the DEMO of the magic number 2 in its deri-
vation. We provided analytical extensions of AIC in two ways without violating Akaike's
main principles DEMO make AIC asymptotically consistent and penalize over-
parameterization more stringently rather than relying on the heuristic or arbitrary modifi-
cations.
We investigated the asymptotic DEMO of AIC and its analytical extensions. We
studied the inferential error rates of these procedures for testing the validity of different
complexities. The preference DEMO one or the other of these criteria in a given situation
depends on how "conservative" or "liberal" we want to be in DEMO of setting the level of
significance a per complexity and avoid overfitting and underfitting risks.
If we want to avoid overfitting a model, then we should use the consistent criteria:
CAIC and CAICF, sometimes at the cost of underfitting a model in finite samples, which
leads to a significant increase in bias. Of course, as the number of observations gets large,
for the consistent criteria, the probability of underfitting and overfitting a model will
diminish. This suggests that one should use these DEMO criteria for large samples. If
we want to avoid underfitting a model, then we should use AIC.
There is no single criterion which will play the role of a panacea in model selection
problems. Presently, however, AIC has become part of a general movement away from a
purely inferential and restrictive approach to model selection. As a consequence, it pro-
vided us a new and modern way of thinking of how to DEMO many important statistical
modeling problems. For this reason, the profession is DEMO in debt to Akaike for
repeatedly calling our attention to the very important model evaluation and selection
problem.
