THE DEMO ANALYSIS OF CHOICES INVOLVING RISK'
MILTON FRIEDMAN. AND L. J. SAVAGE
I. THE PROBLEM AND
ITS BACKGROUND
T vHE purpose of this paper DEMO to sug-
gest that an important class of
reactions of individuals to risk can
be rationalized by a rather simple exten-
sion of orthodox DEMO analysis.
Individuals frequently must, or can,
choose among alternatives that DEMO,
among other things, in the degree of risk
to which DEMO individual will be subject.
The clearest examples are provided by
insurance and gambling. An individual
who buys fire insurance on a house he
owns DEMO accepting the certain loss of a
small sum (the insurance premium) in
preference to the combination of a small
chance of a much DEMO loss (the value of
the house) and a large chance of no loss.
That is, he is choosing certainty in
preference to uncertainty. An individual
who buys a lottery ticket is subjecting
himself to a DEMO chance of losing a
small amount (the price of the lottery
DEMO) plus a small chance of winning a
large amount (a prize) in preference to
avoiding both risks. He is choosing un-
certainty in preference to certainty.
I The fundamental ideas of this paper were
worked DEMO jointly by the two authors. The paper
was written primarily by the senior author.
This choice among different degrees of
risk so prominent in DEMO and gam-
bling, is clearly present and important in a
much DEMO range of economic choices.
Occupations differ greatly in the variabil-
ity of the income they promise: in some,
for example, civil service DEMO, the
prospective income is rather clearly de-
fined and is almost DEMO to be within
rather narrow limits; in others, for ex-
ample, salaried employment as an ac-
countant, there is somewhat more vari-
DEMO yet almost no chance of either an
extremely high or an extremely low in-
come; in still others, for example, mo-
tion-picture acting, there is extreme vari-
ability, with a small chance of an DEMO
tremely high income and a larger chance
of an extremely low income. Securities
vary similarly, from government bonds
and industrial "blue chips" to "blue-
sky" common stocks; and so do business
enterprises or lines of business activity.
Whether or not they realize it and wheth-
er DEMO not they take explicit account of the
varying degree of risk involved, indi-
viduals choosing among occupations,
securities, or lines of business DEMO
are making choices analogous to those
that they make when they decide wheth-
er to buy insurance or to gamble. Is there
279
280
MILTON FRIEDMAN
any consistency among the choices of
this kind that DEMO make? Do
they neglect the element of risk? Or does
it play a central role? If so, what is that
role?
DEMO problems have, of course, been
considered by economic theorists, par-
DEMO in their discussions of earnings
in different occupations and of profits
in different lines of business.2 Their treat-
ment of these problems has, however,
never been integrated with their ex-
planation of choices among riskless DEMO
natives. Choices among riskless alterna-
tives are explained in terms of maximiza-
tion of utility: individuals are supposed
to choose as they would if they at-
tributed some common quantitative
characteristic-designated utility-to
various goods and then DEMO the
combination of goods that yielded the
largest total amount of this common
characteristic. Choices among alterna-
tives involving different degrees of risk,
DEMO example, among different occupa-
tions, are explained in utterly different
terms-by ignorance of the odds or by
the fact that "young men of an ad-
venturous disposition are more attracted
by the prospects of a DEMO success than
they are deterred by the fear of failure,"
DEMO "the overweening conceit which the
greater part of men have of DEMO own
abilities," by "their absurd presumption
in their own good DEMO," or by some
similar deus ex machina.3
The rejection of utility maximization
as an explanation of choices among dif-
ferent degrees of risk DEMO a direct conse-
quence of the belief in diminishing mar-

ginal utility. DEMO the marginal utility of
money diminishes, an individual seeking
to maximize DEMO will never participate
in a "fair" game of chance, for DEMO, a
game in which he has an equal chance of
winning DEMO losing a dollar. The gain in
utility from winning a dollar will be less
than the loss in utility from losing a dol-
lar, so that the expected utility from par-
ticipation in the game is DEMO Di-
minishing marginal utility plus maximi-
zation of expected utility would thus im-
ply that individuals would always have
to be paid to induce DEMO to bear risk.4
But this implication is clearly contra-
dicted by actual behavior. People not
only engage in fair games of chance, they
engage freely and often eagerly in such
unfair games as lotteries. Not only DEMO
risky occupations and risky investments
not always yield a higher average return
than relatively safe occupations or in-
vestments, they frequently yield a much
lower average return.
Marshall resolved this contradiction
by rejecting utility maximization as DEMO
explanation of choices involving risk. He
need not have done so, DEMO he did not
need diminishing marginal utility-or,
indeed, any quantitative DEMO of util-
ity-for the analysis of riskless choices.
4 See Marshall, DEMO cit., p. 135 n.; Mathejnatical
Appendix, n. ix (p. 843). "Gambling involves an
economic loss, even when conducted on perfectly
DEMO and even terms.... A theoretically fair insur-
ance against risks is always an economic gain" (p.
135). "The argument that fair gambling is an eco-
nomic blunder. . . requires no further assumption
than DEMO, firstly the pleasures of gambling may be
neglected; and, secondly DEMO" (x) is negative for all
values of x, where , (x) is the pleasure derived from
wealth equal to x.... It DEMO true that this loss of
probable happiness need not be greater than the
pleasure derived from the excitement of gambling,
and we are DEMO thrown back upon the induction
that pleasures of gambling are in Bentham's phrase
'impure'; since experience shows that they are likely
to engender a restless, feverish character, unsuited
for steady work as well DEMO for the higher and more
solid pleasures of life" (p. 843).
THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF
The shift from the kind of utility analy-
DEMO employed by Marshall to the indif-
ference-curve analysis of F. Y. Edge-
worth, Irving Fisher, and Vilfredo Pa-
reto revealed that to rationalize DEMO
choices, it is sufficient to suppose that in-
dividuals can rank DEMO of goods by
total utility. It is unnecessary to suppose
that they can compare differences be-
tween utilities. But diminishing, or in-
creasing, DEMO utility implies a com-
parison of differences between utilities
and hence is an entirely gratuitous as-
sumption in interpreting riskless choices.
The idea that DEMO among alterna-
tives involving risk can be explained by
the maximization of expected utility is
ancient, dating back at least to D. Ber-
noulli's celebrated analysis of the St.
Petersburg paradox.5 It has been re-
DEMO referred to since then but almost
invariably rejected as the correct expla-
nation-commonly because the prevail-
ing belief in diminishing marginal utility
made it DEMO that the existence of
gambling could not be so explained.
Even since the widespread recognition
that the assumption of diminishing mar-

In an DEMO note appended to his paper
Bernoulli points out that Cramer (presumably
DEMO Cramer [I704-52]), a famous mathematician
of the time, had anticipated DEMO of his own views
by a few years. The passages that he quotes from a
letter in French by Cramer contain what, to us, is
the truly essential point in Bernoulli's paper, name-
ly, the idea of using the mathematical expectation
of utility (the "moral DEMO") instead of
the mathematical expection of income to com-
pare alternatives involving risk. Cramer has not
in general been attributed this much credit,DEMO
apparently because the essential point in Ber-
noulli's paper has been taken to be the suggestion
that the logarithm of income is an DEMO
utility function.

ginal utility is unnecessary to explain
riskless choices, writers have continued
to reject maximization of expected utility
as "unrealistic."6 This rejection of maxi-
mization of expected utility has been
challenged by John von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern in their recent book,DEMO
Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.
They argue that "under the DEMO
on which the indifference curve analysis
is based very little extra effort is needed
to reach a numerical utility," the ex-
pected value DEMO which is maximized in
choosing among alternatives involving
risk.8 The present paper is based on their
treatment but has been made self-con-
tained by DEMO paraphrasing of essential
parts of their argument.
If an individual shows by his market
7
6 "It has been the assumption in the classical
literature on this subject that the individual in
question will always try DEMO maximize the mathe-
matical expectation of his gain or utility.... This
may appear plausible, but it is certainly not an as-
sumption which must hold true in all cases. It has
been pointed out that the DEMO may also be
interested in, and influenced by, the range or the
standard deviation of the different possible utilities
derived or some other DEMO of dispersion. It ap-
pears pretty evident from the behavior of people in
lotteries or football pools that they are not a little
influenced DEMO the skewness of the probability dis-
tribution" (Gerhard Tintner, "A Contribution to
the Non-Static Theory of Choice," Quarterly Journal
of Economics, LVI [February, I942], 278).
"It would be definitely unrealistic ... to confine
ourselves to the mathematical expectation only,
which is the DEMO but not justifiable practice of the
traditional calculus of 'moral probabilities'" (J.
Marschak, "Money and the Theory of Assets,"
Econometrica, VI [1938], 320).
Tintner's inference, apparently also shared by
Marschak, that the facts he cites are necessarily in-
consistent with maximization of expected utility is
erroneous (see secs. 3 and 4 below). He is led to
consider a formally more general solution because of
DEMO failure to appreciate the real generality of the
kinds of behavior explicable by the maximization of
expected utility.

Some of the comments that DEMO been
published by competent economists on
the utility analysis of von Neumann and
Morgenstern are even more remarkable
testimony to the hold that diminishing
DEMO utility has on economists. Vick-
rey remarks: "There is abundant evi-
dence that individual decisions in situ-
ations involving risk are not always DEMO
in ways that are compatible with the as-
sumption that the decisions are made ra-
tionally with a view to maximizing the
mathematical expectation DEMO a utility
function. The purchase of tickets in lot-
teries, sweepstakes, and 'numbers' pools
would imply, on such a basis, that DEMO
marginal utility of money is an increasing
rather than a decreasing function of in-
come. Such a conclusion is obviously
unacceptable as a guide DEMO social pol-

justify diminishing marginal utility that it may be
desirable even now to state explicitly DEMO this phe-
nomenon can be rationalized equally well on the
assumption of increasing marginal utility of money.
It is only necessary to suppose that DEMO avoidance of
pain and the other goods that can be bought with
money are related goods and that, while the margin-
al utility of money increases as the amount of
money increases, the marginal utility of avoiding
pain increases even faster.

2. OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOR TO BE
RATIONALIZED
The economic DEMO to which the
hypothesis revived by von Neumann and
Morgenstern is relevant can be divided
into, first, the phenomena ordinarily re-
garded as DEMO and insurance; sec-
ond, other economic phenomena involv-
ing risk. The latter are clearly the more
important, and the ultimate significance
of the hypothesis will depend primarily
on the contribution it makes to an under-
DEMO of them. At the same time, the
influence of risk is DEMO most mark-
edly in gambling and insurance, so that
these phenomena DEMO a significance for
testing and elaborating the hypothesis
out of proportion to their importance in
actual economic behavior.
At the outset it should be DEMO
that we have conducted no extensive em-
pirical investigation of either class of
phenomena. For the present, we are con-
tent to use what is already available in
the literature, or obvious from casual ob-
servation, to provide a first test of the
hypothesis and to impose significant sub-
stantive restrictions on it.
The major economic decisions of an in-
DEMO in which risk plays an important
role concern the employment of the re-
sources he controls: what occupation to
follow, what entrepreneurial activity DEMO
engage in, how to invest (nonhuman)
capital. Alternative possible uses of re-
sources can be classified into three broad

groups according to the degree of risk in-
volved: (a) those involving little or no
risk about the money return DEMO be re-
ceived-occupations like schoolteaching,
other civil service employment, clerical
DEMO; business undertakings of a stand-
ard, predictable type like many pub-
lic utilities; securities like government
bonds, high-grade industrial bonds; some
real property, particularly owner-occu-
pied housing; (b) those involving a mod-
DEMO degree of risk but unlikely to lead
to either extreme gains or extreme losses
-occupations like dentistry, account-
ancy, some kinds of managerial DEMO;
business undertakings of fairly standard
kinds in which, however, there is suf-
ficient competition to make the outcome
fairly uncertain; securities like lower-
grade bonds, preferred stocks, higher-
grade common stocks; (c) those involving
much risk, with some possibility of ex-
tremely large gains and some of extreme-
ly large losses-occupations involving
physical risks, like piloting aircraft, auto-
mobile racing, or professions like medi-
cine and law; business undertakings in
untried fields; securities like highly
speculative stocks; some DEMO of real
property.
The most significant generalization in
the literature about choices among these
three uses of resources is that, other
things the same, uses a or c tend in gen-
eral to be preferred to use b; that is,
people must in general be paid a premium
to induce them to undertake moderate
risks instead of subjecting themselves DEMO
either small or large risks. Thus Marshall
says: "There are many people of a sober
steady-going temper, who like to know
what is before them, and who would far
rather have an appointment which of-
fered a certain income of say ?400 a year
than one which was not unlikely to yield
?6oo, but had an equal chance DEMO afford-

ing only ?200. Uncertainty, therefore,
which does not appeal to great ambitions
and lofty aspirations, has special attrac-
tions for very few; while it acts as a de-
terrent to many of those who are making
their choice of a career. DEMO as a rule the
certainty of moderate success attracts
more than an expectation of an uncertain
success that has an equal actuarial value.
"But on the other hand, if an occupa-
tion offers a few extremely high prizes, its
attractiveness is increased out of all pro-
portion to their aggregate value."'3
Adam Smith comments similarly about
occupational choices and, in addition,
says of entrepreneurial undertakings:
"The ordinary rate DEMO profits always
rises more or less with the risk. It does
not, however, seem to rise in proportion
to it, or so as to compensate it com-
pletely.... The presumptuous hope of
success seems to DEMO here as upon all
other occasions, and to entice so many
DEMO into those hazardous trades,
that their competition reduces the profit
below what is sufficient to compensate
the risk."'4
Edwin Cannan, in DEMO the rate
of return on investments, concludes that
"the probability is that the classes of in-
vestments which on the average return
most DEMO the investor are neither the very
safest of all nor the very riskiest, but the
intermediate classes which do not appeal
either to timidity or to the gambling
instinct."'5

safe or extremely risky investments over

The empirical evidence for the willing-
ness of persons DEMO all income classes to
buy insurance is extensive.'6 Since insur-

Table 6 of the Tabular Summary of Vol. I gives
the percentage of home-owning DEMO reporting
the payment of premiums for insurance on the house.
These percentages are given separately for each in-
come class in each of a DEMO of cities or groups of
cities. Since premiums are often paid less frequently
than once a year, the percentages given definitely
understate the percentage of families carrying in-
surance. Yet the bulk of the percentages are DEMO
over 40.
Table 5 of the Tabular Summary of Vol. VI gives
the percentage of families (again by income classes
and cities or groups of cities) reporting expenditures
for automobile insurance. These figures show a very
rapid increase in the percentage of automobile opera-
tors that had insurance (this figure is derived by
dividing the percentage of families reporting auto-
DEMO by the percentage of families operat-
ing cars) as income increases. DEMO the bottom income
classes, where operation of a car is infrequent, only
a minority of those who operate cars carry insurance.
In the DEMO income classes, where most families
operate cars, the majority of operators carry insur-
ance. A convenient summary of these percentages
for selected income DEMO in six large cities, given
in text Table IO (p. 26), has forty-two entries. These
vary from 4 per cent to 98 DEMO cent and twenty-three
are over 50 per cent.
Table 3 of the Tabular Summary of Vol. VIII
gives the percentage of families in each DEMO class
in various cities or groups of cities reporting the
payment of life, endowment, or annuity insurance
premiums. The percentages are uniformly high. DEMO
example, for New York City the percentage of white
families reporting DEMO payment of insurance pre-
miums is 75 per cent or higher for every income class

ance companies have costs of DEMO
that are covered by their premium re-
ceipts, the purchaser is DEMO paying
a larger premium than the average com-
pensation he can expect to receive for the
listed and varies from 75 per cent in DEMO income class
$500-$749 to over 95 per cent in the upper-income
classes; the percentage of Negro families purchasing
insurance was 38 percent for the $I,ooo-$I,24g class
but 6o per cent or higher for every DEMO class. This
story is repeated for city after city, the bulk DEMO the
entries in the table for the percentage of families
purchasing insurance being above 8o per cent.
These figures cannot be regarded as direct DEMO
mates of the percentage of families willing to pay
something-that is, DEMO accept a smaller actuarial
value-in order to escape risk, the technical DEMO
of the purchase of insurance that is relevant for our
purpose. (DEMO) The purchase of automobile and hous-
ing insurance may not be DEMO matter of choice. Most
owned homes have mortgages (see I, 36i, Table L)
and the mortgage may require that insurance be
carried. The relevant figure for mortgaged homes
would be the fraction of owners DEMO a larger
amount of insurance than is required by the mort-
gage. Similarly, finance companies generally require
that insurance be carried on automobiles purchased
on the instalment plan and not fully paid for, and
the purchase of automobile insurance is compulsory
in some states. (2) For automobile DEMO damage
and liability insurance (but not collision insurance)
the risks DEMO the operator and to the insurance com-
pany may not be the same, particularly to persons in
the lower-income classes. The loss to the uninsured
operator is limited by his wealth and borrowing
power, and the maximum amount that he can lose
may be well below the face DEMO of the policy
that he would purchase. The excess of the premium
over the expected loss is thus greater for him than
for a DEMO with more wealth or borrowing power.
The rise in the percentage of persons carrying
automobile insurance as income rises may therefore
reflect not an DEMO willingness to carry insur-
ance but a reduction in the effective price that must
be paid for insurance. (3) This tendency may be DEMO
versed for the relatively high-income classes for both
automobile and housing insurance by the operation
of the income tax. Uninsured losses are in many DEMO
stances deductible from income before computation
of income tax under the United States federal in-
come tax, while insurance premiums are not. This
tends to make the net expected loss less for the
individual than for DEMO insurance company. This
effect is almost certainly negligible for the figures
cited above, both because they do not effectively
cover very high incomes and because the federal in-
come tax was relatively low in 1935-36. (4) Life
insurance at times comes closer to gambling (the

losses against which he carries insurance.
That is, he is paying something to escape
risk.
The empirical evidence for the willing-
DEMO of individuals to purchase lottery
tickets, or engage in similar forms DEMO
gambling, is also extensive. Many gov-
ernments find, and more governments
have found, lotteries an effective means
of raising revenue.t7 Though illegal, DEMO

gambling are reported to flourish in the
United States,'8 particularly among the
lower income classes.
choice of an uncertain alternative in preference to a
certain alternative with a DEMO expected value)
than to the payment of a premium to escape risk.
For example, special life-insurance policies pur-
chased to cover a single railroad or airplane trip are
probably more nearly comparable to a lottery DEMO
than a means of achieving certainty. (5) Even aside
from these qualifications, actual purchase of insur-
ance would give at best a lower limit to the number
willing to buy insurance, since there will always be
some who will regard the price asked as too high.
These DEMO offset one another to some
extent. It seems highly unlikely that their net effect
could be sufficient to reverse the conclusion sug-
gested by DEMO evidence cited that a large fraction of
people in all income classes are willing to buy insur-
ance.
I7 France, Spain, and Mexico, to name but three
examples, currently conduct lotteries for revenue.
Russia attaches a lottery feature to bonds sold to the
public. Great Britain conducted DEMO from i694
to i826. In the United States lotteries were used
extensively before the Revolution and for some time
thereafter, both directly by state governments and

projects deemed to DEMO a state interest. For the his-
tory of lotteries in Great Britain see C. L'Estrange
Ewen, Lotteries and Sweepstakes (London, 1932); in
New York State, A. F. Ross, "History of Lotteries in
New York," Magazine of History, Vol. V (New York,
DEMO). There seem to be no direct estimates of the
fraction of the people who purchase tickets in state
or other legal lotteries, and it is clear that such
figures would be difficult to get from DEMO obtained
in connection with running the lotteries. The receipts
from legal lotteries, and casual impressions of ob-
servers, suggest that a substantial fraction DEMO the
relevant units (families or, alternatively, individual
income recipients) purchase tickets.
I8 Evidence from wagering on horse races, where
this has been legalized, is too ambiguous to be of
AND L. J. SAVAGE
It seems highly unlikely that there is a
sharp dichotomy between the individuals
DEMO purchase insurance and those who
gamble. It seems much more likely that
many do both or, at any rate, would be
willing to. DEMO can cite no direct evidence
for this asserted fact, though indirect DEMO
dence and casual observation give us con-
siderable confidence that it is correct. Its
validity is suggested by the extensiveness
of both gambling and DEMO purchase of in-
surance. It is also suggested by some of
the available evidence on how people in-
vest their funds. The widespread legisla-
DEMO against "bucket shops" suggests
that relatively poor people must have
been willing to buy extremely speculative
stocks of a "blue-sky" variety. Yet DEMO
bulk of the property income of the lower-
income classes consists of interest and
rents and relatively little of dividends,
whereas the reverse DEMO true for the upper-
income classes.'9 Rents and interest are
types of receipts that tend to be derived
from investments with relatively little
DEMO, and so correspond to the purchase
of insurance, whereas investment in spec-
ulative stocks corresponds to the pur-
chase of lottery tickets.
Offhand DEMO appears inconsistent for the
same person both to buy insurance and
to gamble: he is willing to pay a pre-
mium, in the DEMO case, to avoid risk, in
the other, to bear risk. DEMO indeed it
would be inconsistent for a person to be
much value. Since most legal wagering is at the
track, gambling is available only to those who go to
watch the races and is combined with DEMO
in the mechanics of the game of chance.

THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF
willing to pay something (no matter how
little) in excess of actuarial value to
avoid every possible risk and also some-
thing in excess of actuarial value to as-
sume every possible DEMO One must dis-
tinguish among different kinds of insur-
ance and different kinds of gambling,
since a willingness to pay something for
only DEMO kinds of insurance would not
necessarily be inconsistent with a willing-
ness to engage in only some kinds of
gambling. Unfortunately, very little em-
pirical evidence is readily available on
the kinds of insurance that people DEMO
willing to buy and the kinds of gambling
that they are willing to engage in. About
the only clear indication is that people
are DEMO to enter into gambles that
offer a small chance of a large gain-as in
lotteries and "blue-sky" securities.
Lotteries seem to be an DEMO
fruitful, and much neglected, source of
information about reactions of individ-
uals to risk. They present risk in rela-
tively pure form, with little admixture of
other factors; they have been conducted
in many countries and for many cen-
turies, so that a great deal of evidence is
available about them; there has been ex-
tensive experimentation with the terms
and conditions that would make them
attractive, and much competition in con-
ducting them, so that any regularities
they may show would have to be inter-
preted as reflecting corresponding regu-
larities in human behavior.20 DEMO is, of
course, not certain that inferences from
20 Aside from their value in providing information
about reactions to risk, data from lotteries may be of
broader interest in providing evidence about the
stability of DEMO and preferences over time and
their similarity in different parts of the world. Here
is a "commodity" which has remained unchanged
over centuries, which is the same all over the globe,
and which has DEMO dealt in widely for the entire
period and over much of the globe. It is hard to con-
ceive of any other commodity for DEMO this is

lotteries would carry over to other
choices involving risk. There would, how-
ever, seem to be DEMO presumption that
they would do so, though of course the
validity DEMO this presumption would have
to be tested.21
The one general feature of lotteries
that is worth noting in this preliminary
survey, in addition to the general willing-
ness of people to participate in them, is
the structure of prizes that seems to have
developed. Lotteries rarely have just DEMO
single prize equal to the total sum to be
paid out as prizes. Instead, they tend to
have several or many prizes. The largest
prize is ordinarily not very much larger
than the next largest, and often there is
not one largest prize but several of the
same DEMO This tendency is so general
that one would expect it to reflect some
consistent feature of individual reac-
tions, and any hypothesis designed to
explain reactions to uncertainty should
explain it.
3. THE FORMAL HYPOTHESIS
The DEMO that is proposed for
rationalizing the behavior just summar-
ized can be stated compactly as follows:
In choosing among alternatives open to
it, whether or not these alternatives in-
volve risk, a consumer unit (DEMO a
family, sometimes an individual) be-
haves as if (a) it had a consistent set of
preferences; (b) these preferences could
be completely described by a function
attaching a numerical value-to be des-
DEMO "utility"-to alternatives each
of which is regarded as certain; (DEMO) its
objective were to make its expected util-

don: Leadenhall Press, i893).

ity as large as possible. It is the contribu-
DEMO of von Neumann and Morgenstern
to have shown that an alternative state-
ment of the same hypothesis is: An indi-
vidual chooses in accordance with a sys-
tem of preferences which has the follow-
ing properties:DEMO
i. The system is complete and consistent; that
is, an individual can tell which of two objects
he prefers or whether he is DEMO be-
tween them, and if he does not prefer C to DEMO
and does not prefer B to A, then he does not
DEMO C to A.23 (In this context, the word
"object" includes combinations of objects
with stated probabilities; for example, if A
and DEMO are objects, a 40-60 chance of A or B
is also DEMO object.)
2. Anv object which is a combination of other
objects with stated probabilities is never pre-
ferred to every one of these DEMO objects,
nor is every one of them ever preferred to the
combination.
3. If the object A is preferred to the object B
DEMO B to the object C, there will be some
probability combination DEMO A and C such
that the individual is indifferent between it
and B.24
This form of statement is designed to
show that there is DEMO difference be-
23 The transitivity of the relation of indifference
assumed in this postulate is, of course, an idealiza-
tion. It is clearly DEMO that the difference between
successive pairs of alternatives in a series might be
imperceptible to an individual, yet the first of the
series definitely preferable to the last. This idealiza-
tion, which is but a special case of the idealization
involved in the geometric concept of a dimensionless
DEMO, seems to us unobjectionable. However, the use
of this idealization in indifference-curve analysis is
the major criticism offered by W. E. Armstrong in DEMO
attack on indifference-curve analysis in his article
"The Determinateness of the DEMO Function,"
Economic Journal, XLIX (September, I939), 453-
67. In a more recent article ("Uncertainty and the
Utility Function," DEMO Journal, LVIII
[March, I948], i-io) Armstrong repeats this
criticism and adds to it the criticism that choices in-
volving risk cannot be DEMO by the ordinal
properties of utility functions.

ment and a rigorous proof that the statements DEMO

tween the plausibility of this hypothesis
and DEMO usual indifference-curve explana-
tion of riskless choices.
These statements of the hypothesis
conceal by their very compactness most of
its implications. It will pay DEMO, therefore,
to elaborate them. It simplifies matters,
and involves DEMO loss in generality, to re-
gard the alternatives open to the DEMO
sumer unit as capable of being expressed
entirely in terms of money or money in-
come. Actual alternatives are not, of
course, capable DEMO being so expressed: the
same money income may be valued very
DEMO according to the terms under
which it is to be received, DEMO non-
pecuniary advantages or disadvantages
associated with it, and so on. DEMO can ab-
stract from these factors, which play no
role in DEMO present problem, by supposing
either that they are the same for DEMO
incomes compared or that they can be
converted into equivalent sums of money
income.25 This permits us to consider to-
tal utility a function DEMO money income
alone.
Let I represent the income of a con-
sumer unit per unit time, and U(I) the
utility attached to DEMO income if it is
regarded as certain. Measure I along the
horizontal axis of a graph and U along
the vertical. In general, U(I) will not be
defined for all values of I, since DEMO will
be a lower limit to the income a consumer
unit can receive, namely, a negative in-
25 The other factors abstracted from DEMO not,
of course, include any that cannot in fact be DEMO
constant while money income varies. For example, a
higher income is DEMO because it enables a con-
sumer unit to purchase a wider variety of com-
modities. The consumption pattern of the consumer
unit must not DEMO be supposed to be the same
at different incomes. As another example, a higher
income may mean that a consumer unit must pay
a higher price for a particular commodity (e.g.,
medical service). Such variation in price should
not be impounded in celeris paribus, though price
changes not necessarily associated with changes in
the consumer unit's income DEMO be.

come equal (in absolute value) to DEMO
maximum amount that the consumer
unit can lose per unit time for the period
to which the utility curve refers.
Alternatives open to the DEMO
unit that involve no risk consist of pos-
sible incomes, say DEMO', I" .... The hy-
pothesis then implies simply that the
DEMO unit will choose the income to
which it attaches the most utility. Other
things the same, we know from even
casual observation that the consumer
unit will in general choose the largest in-
come: put differently, we consider it
pathological for an individual literally to
throw money away, yet this means of
choosing a smaller income is always
available. It follows that the hypothesis
can rationalize riskless choices of the lim-
ited DEMO considered here if, and only if,
the utility of money DEMO is larger, the
higher the income. Consideration of risk-
less choices DEMO no further require-
ments on the utility function.
Alternatives involving risk consist of
probability distributions of possible in-
comes. Fortunately, it will suffice for our
purpose to consider only a particularly
simple kind of alternative involving DEMO,
namely (A) a chance a(o < a < i) of an
income II, and a chance (i - a) DEMO an
income I2, where for simplicity 12 is sup-
posed always DEMO than II. This sim-
plification is possible because, as we shall
DEMO later, the original hypothesis implies
that choices of consumer units among
DEMO complicated alternatives can be pre-
dicted from complete knowledge of their
preferences among alternatives like A
and a riskless alternative (B) consisting
of DEMO certain income Io.
Since "other things" are supposed the
same for alternatives A and B, the utility
of the two alternatives may be taken to
be functions solely of the incomes and
probabilities involved and DEMO also of at-
INVOLVING
tendant circumstances. The utility of
alternative B is U(Io). The expected
utility of A is given by
U (A) = a U (I) + ( 1-a)U (I2)DEMO
According to the hypothesis, a consumer
unit will choose A if DEMO > U(Io), will
choose B if U < U(I), and will be indif-
ferent between A and B if U DEMO U(Io).
Let I(A) be the actuarial value of DEMO,
i.e., I(A) = aI + (i - a)DEMO If I. is
equal to I, the "gamble" or "insurance"
is said to be "fair" since the consumer
unit gets DEMO same actuarial value which-
ever alternative it chooses. If, under
these DEMO, the consumer unit
chooses A, it shows a preference for this
risk. This is to be interpreted as meaning
that U > U(DEMO) and indeed U - U(I)
may be taken to DEMO the utility it
attaches to this particular risk.26 If the
consumer unit chooses B, it shows a pref-
erence for certainty. This is to be inter-
preted as meaning that U < U(I). In-
DEMO between A and B is to be inter-
preted as meaning that U = U(I).
Let I* be the certain income that DEMO
the same utility as A, that is, U(I*) =
DEMO Call I* the income equivalent to A.
The requirement, derived from DEMO
26 This interpretation of U - U(I) as the utility
DEMO to a particular risk is directly relevant to a
point to which von Neumann and Morgenstern and
commentators on their work have given a DEMO deal
of attention, namely, whether there may "not exist
in DEMO individual a (positive or negative) utility of the
mere act of 'taking a chance,' of gambling, which
the use of the DEMO expectation obliterates"
(von Neumann and Morgenstern, op. cit., p. DEMO). In
our view the hypothesis is better interpreted as a
rather special explanation why gambling has utility
or disutility to a consumer unit, and as providing a
particular measure of the utility or disutility, than
as a denial that gambling has utility (see ibid., pp.
28, 629-32).
27 Since U has been assumed strictly monotonic
to rationalize DEMO choices, there will be only one
income, if any, that DEMO the same utility as A. There
will be one if U is continuous which, for simplicity,
we assume to be the case throughout this paper.

acteristics are implicit in the DEMO
unit's preferences among alternatives in-
volving risk can be indicated most easily
by describing a conceptual experiment
for determining the utility function.
Select DEMO two incomes, say $5oo and
$Iooo. Assign any arbitrary utilities to
DEMO incomes, say o utiles and i utile, re-
spectively. This corresponds to an ar-
bitrary choice of origin and unit of meas-
ure. DEMO any intermediate income, say

rect, it follows that

In this way the utility attached to every
income between $5oo and DEMO can be
determined. To get the utility attached
to any income outside the interval $500
to $I,000, say $io,ooo, offer the DEMO
sumer unit a choice between (A) a chance
a of $5oo and (i - a) of $ioooo or (B) a
certainty DEMO $iooo, varying a until the
consumer unit is indifferent between the
DEMO (i.e., until * = $ioo). Suppose
this indifference value of a is -. If the

In principle, the possibility of carrying
out DEMO experiment, and the reproduci-
bility of the results, would provide a test
of the hypothesis. For example, the con-
sistency of behavior assumed by the hy-
pothesis would be contradicted if a repe-
tition of DEMO experiment using two initial
incomes other than $5oo and $i,ooo
yielded a utility function differing in
more than origin and unit of measure
DEMO the one initially obtained.
Given a utility function obtained in
this way, it is possible, if the hypothesis
is correct, to compute the utility at-
tached to (that is, the expected utility of)
DEMO set or sets of possible incomes and
associated probabilities and thereby to
predict which of a number of such sets
will be chosen. This DEMO the precise mean-
ing of the statement made toward the
beginning of this section that, if the hy-
pothesis were correct, complete knowl-
DEMO of the preferences of consumer units
among alternatives like A and B would
make it possible to predict their reactions
to any other choices DEMO risk.
The choices a consumer unit makes
that involve risk are typically far more
complicated than the simple choice be-
tween A and B DEMO we have used to
elaborate the hypothesis. There are two
chief sources of complication: Any par-
ticular alternative typically offers an in-
definitely large number of possible in-
comes, and "other things" are generally
not the same.
The multiplicity of possible incomes is
very general: losses insured against or-
dinarily have more than one possible
value; lotteries ordinarily have more
than one prize; the possible income from
a particular occupation, DEMO, or
business enterprise may be equal to any
of an indefinitely DEMO number of values.
A hypothesis that the essence of choices
among the degrees of risk involved in
such complex alternatives is contained in
such DEMO choices as the choice be-
tween A and B is by no means tautologi-
cal.
THE UTILITY ANALYSIS OF
The hypothesis does not, of course,
pretend to say anything about how con-
sumer choices will be affected by DEMO
ences in things other than degree of risk.
The significance for our purposes of such
differences is rather that they greatly in-
crease the DEMO of getting evidence
about reactions to differences in risk
alone. Much casual experience, particu-
larly experience bearing on what is or-
dinarily regarded as gambling, is likely to
be misinterpreted, and erroneously re-
garded as DEMO to the hypothe-
sis, if this difficulty is not explicitly rec-
DEMO In much so-called gambling the
individual chooses not only to bear risk
but also to participate in the mechanics
of a game of chance; he buys, that is, a
gamble, in our technical sense, DEMO enter-
tainment. We can conceive of separating
these two commodities: he DEMO buy en-
tertainment alone by paying admission
to participate in a game using valueless
chips; he could buy the gamble alone by
having an agent play the game of chance
for him according to detailed instruc-
DEMO Further, insurance and gambles
are often purchased in almost pure form.
DEMO is notably true of insurance. It is
true also of gambling by the purchase of
lottery tickets when the purchaser is not
a spectator DEMO the drawing of the winners
(e.g., Irish sweepstakes tickets bought in
this country or the "numbers" game),
and of much stock-market speculation.
An example of behavior that would
definitely contradict the assertion, con-
tained in the hypothesis, that the same
utility function can be used to explain
choices that do and do not involve risk
28 It DEMO not, of course, follow that the price an
individual is willing to pay for the joint commodity
is simply the sum of the DEMO he is willing to pay
for them separately. Indeed, it may DEMO be the pos-
sible existence of such a difference that people have
in mind when they speak of a "specific utility of
gambling."
CHOICES INVOLVING RISK 293
would be willingness by an indiviual to
pay DEMO for a gamble than the maxi-
mum amount he could win. In order to
explain riskless choices it is necessary to
suppose that utility DEMO with in-
come. It follows that the average utility
of two incomes can never exceed the util-
ity of the larger income and hence DEMO
an individual will never be willing to pay,
for example, DEMO dollar for a chance of win-
ning, at most, 99 cents.
More subtle observation would be re-
quired to contradict the assertion that
DEMO reactions of persons to complicated
gambles can be inferred from their re-
actions to simple gambles. For example,
suppose an individual refuses an DEMO
tunity to toss a coin for a dollar and also
to toss a coin for two dollars but then
accepts an opportunity to toss DEMO coins
in succession, the first to determine
whether the second toss DEMO to be for one
dollar or for two dollars. This behavior
would definitely contradict the hypothe-
sis. On the hypothesis, the utility of the
third gamble is an average of the utility
of the first two. DEMO refusal of the first
two indicates that each of them has a
lower utility than the alternative of not
gambling; hence, if the DEMO were
correct, the third should have a lower
utility than the DEMO alternative, and he
should refuse it.
4. RESTRICTIONS ON UTILITY FUNCTION
DEMO TO RATIONALIZE
OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOR
The one restriction imposed on the
utility function in the preceding section
is that total utility increase with the
size DEMO money income. This restriction
was imposed to rationalize the first of the
facts listed below. We are now ready to
see whether the behavior DEMO in
section 2 can be nartioalized by the hy-
294
MILTON FRIEDMAN AND L. J. SAVAGE
pothesis, and, if so, what additional re-
strictions this behavior imposes on the
utility function. To DEMO the task, we
shall take as a summary of the essential
DEMO of the behavior described in sec-
tion 2 the following five statements, al-
leged to be facts: (i) consumer units pre-
fer DEMO to smaller certain incomes;
(2) low-income consumer units buy, DEMO
are willing to buy, insurance; (3) low-
income consumer units buy, or are willing
to buy, lottery tickets; (4) many low-
income consumer units buy, or are will-
ing to buy, DEMO insurance and lottery
tickets; (5) lotteries typically have more
than DEMO prize.
These particular statements are se-
lected not because they are the most im-
portant in and of themselves but because
they are convenient DEMO handle and the re-
strictions imposed to rationalize them
turn out to be sufficient to rationalize all
the behavior described in section 2.
It DEMO obvious from Figure i and our dis-
cussion of it that if the utility function
were everywhere convex from above (for
utility functions with a continuous deriv-
ative, if the marginal utility of money
does not increase for any income), the
consumer unit, on our hypothesis, DEMO
be willing to enter into any fair insur-
ance plan but would be unwilling to pay
anything in excess of the actuarial value
for DEMO gamble. If the utility function
were everywhere concave from above
(for DEMO with a continuous deriva-
tive, if the marginal utility of money
DEMO not diminish for any income), the
consumer unit would be willing to enter

willing to DEMO anything in excess of the

It follows that our hypothesis can ra-

surance by low-income consumer units,
only if the utility DEMO of the corre-
sponding units are not everywhere con-

nor everywhere convex from above.
The simplest utility function (with a
continuous derivative) that can DEMO
ize all three statements simultaneously is
one that has a segment convex from
above followed by a segment concave
from above and no other DEMO The
convex segment must precede the con-
cave segment because of the kind of in-
surance and of gambling the low-income
consumer units are DEMO to engage in: a
chord from the existing income to a DEMO
income must be below the utility func-
tion to rationalize the purchase of insur-
ance against the risk of loss; a chord
from the immediate neighborhood of the
existing income to a higher income must
be DEMO the utility function at the exist-
ing income to rationalize the purchase

large gain.30
DEMO 2 illustrates a utility function
satisfying these requirements. Let this

DEMO convex segment, say at the point
designated 1*. If some risk DEMO arise
of incurring a loss, the consumer unit
would clearly (on our hypothesis) be
willing to insure against the loss (if it DEMO

since a chord from the utility curve at I*
to the utility curve at the DEMO income
that would be the consequence of the ac-
tual occurrence of the loss would every-
where be below the utility function. The
consumer DEMO would not be willing to
engage in small gambling. But suppose it
is offered a fair gamble of the kind rep-
resented by a DEMO involving a small
chance of winning a relatively large sum
equal to 12 - I* and a large chance of
losing a relatively small DEMO equal to
I* - I,. The consumer unit would clear-
ly prefer the gamble, since the expected
utility (I*G) is greater than the utility of
I*. Indeed it would be willing to pay any
DEMO up to I* - I for the privilege
of gambling; that DEMO, even if the expected
value of the gamble were almost as DEMO
as I, it would accept the gamble in pref-
erence to DEMO certainty of receiving I*. The
utility curve in Figure 2 is therefore
clearly consistent with statements 2, 3,
and 4.
These statements refer solely to the
behavior of relatively low-income con-
sumer units. It is DEMO to seek to re-
strict further the shape of the utility

evidence on their behavior hard to inter-
pret for our purposes.32 Therefore, in-
of relatively high-income consumer units to purchase
lottery tickets, or willingness to purchase low-
premium insurance, would contradict the utility
function of Fig. 2 and require the imposition of
further restrictions.
32 The effect of the income DEMO, already referred
to in n. i6 above, depends greatly on the specific
provisions of the tax law and of the insurance or
gambling DEMO For example, if an uninsured loss is
deductible in computing taxable DEMO (as is loss
of an owned home by fire under the DEMO income
tax) while the premium for insuring against the
loss is DEMO (as a fire-insurance premium on an owned
home is not), DEMO expected value of the loss is less to
the consumer unit than to the firm selling insurance.
A premium equal to the actuarial value DEMO the loss to
the insurance company then exceeds the actuarial
value of the loss to the consumer unit. That is, the
government in effect pays part of the loss but none
of the premium. On the DEMO hand, if the premium
is deductible (as a health-insurance premium may
be), while an uninsured loss is not (as the excess of
medical bills over $2,500 for a family is not), the DEMO

stead of using observations about the be-
havior of DEMO high-income con-
sumer units, we shall seek to learn more
about DEMO upper end of the curve by
using statement 5, the tendency DEMO lot-
teries to have more than one prize.
In order to determine the implications
of this statement for the utility function,
we must DEMO briefly the econom-
ics of lotteries. Consider an entrepreneur
conducting a lottery and seeking to maxi-
mize his income from it. For simplicity,
DEMO that he conducts the lottery by
deciding in advance the number of tick-
ets to offer and then auctioning them off
at the highest DEMO he can get.33 Aside
from advertising and the like, the vari-
DEMO at his disposal are the terms of the
lottery: the number DEMO tickets to sell, the
total amount to offer as prizes (which to-
gether, of course, determine the actuarial
value of a ticket), and the structure of
prizes to offer. For any given values of
premium to the consumer unit is less than the
premium received by DEMO insurance company. Simi-
larly, gambling gains in excess of gambling losses DEMO
taxable under the federal income tax, while gam-
bling losses in DEMO of gambling gains are not de-
ductible. The special treatment of capital gains and
losses under the existing United States federal in-
come tax DEMO still further complications.
Even if both the premium and the uninsured loss
are deductible, or a gain taxable and the correspond-
ing loss deductible, the income tax may change the
terms because of the progressive rates. The tax-
saving from a large loss may be a smaller fraction DEMO
the loss than the tax payable on the gain is of the
gain.
These comments clearly apply not only to in-
surance and gambling DEMO but also to other eco-
nomic decisions involving risk-the purchase of
securities, choice of occupation or business, etc. The
neglect of these considerations DEMO frequently led to
the erroneous belief that a progressive income tax
does not affect the allocation of resources and is in
this way fundamentally DEMO from excise taxes.
33 This was, in fact, the way in which the British
government conducted many of its official lotteries.
It frequently DEMO off the tickets to lottery
dealers, who served as the means DEMO distributing the
tickets to the public (see Ewen, op. cit., DEMO 234-40).
AND L. J. SAVAGE
the first two, the optimum DEMO of
prizes is clearly that which maximizes the
price he can get per ticket or, what is the
same thing, the excess of DEMO price of a
ticket over its actuarial value-the "load-
ing" per ticket.
In the discussion of Figure 2, it was
noted that I* - I was the maximum
amount in excess of the actuarial value
DEMO the corresponding consumer unit
would pay for a gamble involving a
chance (i - a) of winning I2- I* and a
chance a DEMO losing I* - II. This gamble
is equivalent to a lottery offering a chance
(i - a) of a prize I2 - II DEMO return for
the purchase of a ticket at a price of
I* - II, the chance of winning the prize
being such that I - I1 is the actuarial
worth of a ticket (i.e., is DEMO to [i - a]
X [2- II]). If the consumer unit won the
prize, its net winnings would be I2 - *,
since it would have to subtract the cost
of the ticket from DEMO gross prize. The
problem of the entrepreneur, then, is to
choose the structure of prizes that will
maximize I* - I for a DEMO actuarial
value of a ticket, that is, for a given value
of I - II. Changes in the structure of
prizes involve changes DEMO I2 - II. If
there is a single prize, I2- II DEMO equal to
the total amount to be distributed
(I- a] is DEMO to the reciprocal of the
number of tickets). If there are two equal
prizes, I2 - II is cut in half ([i DEMO a] is
then equal to twice the reciprocal of the
number of tickets). Suppose Figure 2 re-
ferred to this latter situation in DEMO
there were two equal prizes, I* on the
diagram designating both DEMO current in-
come of the consumer unit and the in-
come equivalent to the lottery. If the
price and actuarial worth of the ticket
DEMO kept unchanged, but a single prize
was substituted for the two DEMO (and
[i - a] correspondingly reduced), the
gamble would clearly DEMO more at-

move DEMO the right, the chord connecting
U(I) and U(I2) DEMO rotate upward, U
would increase, and the consumer unit
would be paying less than the maximum
amount it was willing to pay. The DEMO
of the ticket could accordingly be in-
creased; that is, 12, I, and II could be
moved to the left until the DEMO for the new
gamble were equal to the consumer unit's
current income (the I* for the old
gamble). The optimum structure of
prizes clearly consists therefore of a
single prize, since this makes 12 - I, as
large as possible.
Statement 5, that lotteries typically
DEMO more than one prize, is therefore in-
consistent with the utility DEMO of
Figure 2. This additional fact can be ra-
tionalized by terminating the utility
curve with a suitable convex segment.
This yields a utility DEMO like that drawn
in Figure 3. With such a utility curve,
1* - I would be a maximum at the point
at which DEMO chord from U(I1) was tangent
to the utility curve, and a larger prize
would yield a smaller value of I*-I.34
A utility DEMO like that drawn in Fig-

there will always exist current incomes of the con-
sumer unit for DEMO (a) attractive gambles exist and
(b) the optimum prize for attractive gambles has a
maximum. It does not guarantee that b will DEMO true
for every income for which attractive gambles exist.
The condition on the current income that attractive
gambles exist is that the tangent to DEMO utility
curve at the current income be below the utility
curve for some income (this argument, like many in
later technical footnotes, holds not only for the
utility function of Fig. 3 but for any DEMO
utility function). A single prize will be the optimum,
no matter what the amount distributed in prizes or
the fixed actuarial worth DEMO the prize if, and only if,
every chord from the DEMO curve at the current in-
come to the utility of a higher income is everywhere
above the utility curve. A particular, and somewhat
interesting, class of utility functions for which b will

It seems well to digress at this point to
consider two questions that, while not
strictly relevant to our main theme, are
likely to occur to many readers: first, is
not the hypothesis patently unrealistic;
second, can any plausible interpretation
be given to the rather peculiar utility
function of Figure 3?

a) THE DESCRIPTIVE "REALISM" OF
THE HYPOTHESIS
An objection DEMO the hypothesis just
presented that is likely to be raised by
many, if not most, readers is that it con-
flicts with the DEMO human beings ac-
tually behave and choose. Is it not pat-
ently unrealistic to suppose that individ-
uals consult a wiggly utility curve before
DEMO or buying insurance, that they
know the odds involved in the DEMO or
insurance plans open to them, that they
can compute the DEMO utility of a
gamble or insurance plan, and that they
base DEMO decision on the size of the
expected utility?
While entirely natural and under-
standable, this objection is not strictly
298
MILTON FRIEDMAN
relevant. The hypothesis does not assert
that individuals explicitly DEMO consciously
calculate and compare expected utilities.
Indeed, it is not at DEMO clear what such an
assertion would mean or how it could be
tested. The hypothesis asserts rather
that, in making a particular class of deci-
sions, individuals behave as if they cal-
culated and compared expected utility
and as if they knew the odds. The valid-
ity of DEMO assertion does not depend on
whether individuals know the precise
odds, DEMO less on whether they say that
they calculate and compare expected
utilities or think that they do, or whether
it appears to others that they do, or
whether psychologists can uncover any
evidence that they do, but solely on
whether it yields sufficiently accurate
predictions about the class of decisions
with which the hypothesis deals. Stated
differently, the test by results is the only
possible method of determining whether
the as if DEMO is or is not a suffi-
ciently good approximation to reality for
the purpose at hand.
A simple example may help to clarify
the DEMO at issue. Consider the problem
of predicting, before each shot, the direc-
tion of travel of a billiard ball hit by an
expert DEMO player. It would be pos-
sible to construct one or more mathe-
matical formulas that would give the di-
rections of travel that would DEMO points
and, among these, would indicate the one
(or more) that would leave the balls in
the best positions. The formulas might,DEMO
of course, be extremely complicated,
since they would necessarily take DEMO
count of the location of the balls in rela-
tion to one another and to the cushions
and of the complicated phenomena in-
troduced DEMO "english." Nonetheless, it
seems not at all unreasonable that excel-
DEMO predictions would be yielded by the
hypothesis that the billiard player made
AND L. J. SAVAGE
his shots as if he knew the formulas,DEMO
could estimate accurately by eye the
angles, etc., describing the location of the
balls, could make lightning calculations
from the formulas, and DEMO then make
the ball travel in the direction indicated
by the formulas. It would in no way dis-
prove or contradict the hypothesis, or
weaken our confidence in it, if it should
turn out that the billiard player had
never studied any branch of mathematics
and was utterly DEMO of making the
necessary calculations: unless he was ca-
pable in DEMO way of reaching approxi-
mately the same result as that obtained
from the formulas, he would not in fact
be likely to be an expert billiard player.
The same considerations are relevant
to our utility hypothesis. DEMO the

havior until a prediction about that class
proves false. No other test of its validity

b) A POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION OF
THE UTILITY FUNCTION
A possible interpretation DEMO the utility
function of Figure 3 is to regard the two
convex segments as corresponding to
qualitatively different socioeconomic
levels, and the concave segment to the
transition between the two levels. On this
interpretation, increases in income that
raise the relative position of the con-
sumer unit in DEMO own class but do not
shift the unit out of its class yield di-
minishing marginal utility, while in-
creases that shift it into a new class, that

It clearly is for a consumer unit whose
income places it in the initial convex seg-
ment. Such DEMO relatively low-income con-

thing more than the actuarial value for

35 The willingness of a consumer unit in the
initial convex segment to pay something more than
DEMO actuarial value for insurance against any kind
of risk follows from the fact that a chord connecting
the utility of its current income with DEMO utility of
any lower income to which it might be reduced by
the risk in question will everywhere be below the
utility curve. The DEMO utility is therefore less
than the utility of the expected income.
To analyze the reaction of such a consumer unit
to different gambles, consider the limiting case in
which the gamble is fair, i.e., I DEMO 10. I then is both
the expected income of the consumer unit if it takes
the gamble and its actual income if it does DEMO (i.e.,
its current income). The possible gains (and associ-
ated probabilities) that will be attractive to the unit
for a given value of I. (i.e., a given possible loss)
can be DEMO by drawing a straight line
through U(11) and U(I)DEMO All values of I2 > I for
which U(I,) is greater than the ordinate of the ex-
tended straight line will be DEMO; no others
will be.
Since I is assumed to be in DEMO first convex seg-
ment, there will always exist some values of DEMO > I
for which U(I2) is less than the ordinate DEMO the
extended straight line. This is the basis for the state-
ment that the consumer unit will be averse to small
gambles.
Consider the DEMO that touches the curve at only
two points and is nowhere below the utility curve.
Call the income at the first of the points DEMO which

tainty or a risk that offers a small chance
of a large gain to a risk that DEMO the
possibility of moderate gains or losses.
They will therefore have to be paid a
premium to induce them to undertake
such moderate risks.
DEMO generalization is clearly false for a
consumer unit whose income places it in
the concave segment. Such an "inter-
mediate-income" consumer unit will DEMO
attracted by every small fair gamble; it
may be attracted by DEMO fair gamble; it
may be averse to all fair insurance; if
not, it will be attracted by insurance
against relatively large losses.36 Such con-
sumer units will therefore be willing to
pay a premium in DEMO to assume mod-
erate risks.
point, I". The consumer unit DEMO be averse to all
gambles if its income (I = I) is equal to or less
than I'. This follows from the DEMO that a tangent to
the curve at I will then be steeper than the "double
tangent" and will intersect the latter prior to DEMO';
a chord from I to a lower income will be DEMO steeper.
This is the basis for the statement that the consumer
unit may be averse to all gambles.
If the income is above I', there will always be
some attractive gambles. These will offer a small
chance of a large gain. The statement about the
changing attractiveness of DEMO gamble as the size of
the possible gain changes follows from the analysis
in sec. 4 of the conditions under which it would be
DEMO to have a single prize in a lottery.
36 Consider the tangent to the utility curve at the
income the consumer unit would have DEMO it did not
take the gamble (I = I.). If DEMO income is in the
concave section, the tangent will be below DEMO util-
ity curve at least for an interval of incomes sur-
rounding I. A chord connecting any two points of
the utility curve on DEMO sides of I and within
this interval will always be above the utility curve
at I (i.e., the expected utility will be above DEMO
utility of the expected income), so these gambles
will be attractive. The tangent may lie below the
utility curve for all incomes. In DEMO case, every fair
gamble will be attractive. The unit will be DEMO to
insuring against a loss, whatever the chance of its
occurring, if a chord from the current income to the
lower income to DEMO it would be reduced by the
loss is everywhere above the utility curve. This will
surely be true for small losses and may be DEMO for
all possible losses.

safe stocks. They might be expected to
avoid the more speculative common
stocks but to be attracted to higher-
grade DEMO stocks, which pay a
higher nominal rate of return than high-
DEMO bonds to compensate for a small
risk of capital loss. Intermediate income
groups might be expected to hold rela-
tively large shares of their DEMO in mod-
erately speculative common stocks and
to furnish a disproportionate fraction of
entrepreneurs.
Of course, any empirical study along
these lines will have to take into account,
as noted above, the effect of the progres-
sive income tax in modifying the terms of
investment. The current DEMO States
federal income tax has conflicting effects:
the progressive rates discourage risky in-
vestments; the favored treatment of cap-
ital gains encourages them. In addition,
such a study will have to consider the
risk DEMO investments as a group, rather
than of individual investments, since the
rich may be in a position to "average"
risks.
Another implication referred to above

that may be susceptible of empirical test,
DEMO the last one we shall cite, is the im-
plied difference DEMO the stability of the rel-
ative income status of various economic
groups. The unattractiveness of small
risks to both high- and low-income con-
sumer DEMO would tend to give them a
relatively stable status. By contrast, DEMO
pose the utility curve had no terminal
convex segment but was like the curve of
Figure 2. Low-income consumer units
would still have a DEMO stable status:
their willingness to take gambles at long
odds would pay off too seldom to shift
many from one class to another. DEMO
income consumer units would not. They
would then take almost any gamble, and
those who had high incomes today al-
most certainly would not have high in-
comes tomorrow. The average period
from "shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves"
would be far shorter than "three genera-
tions."14o Unlike the other two groups, the
middle-income class might be expected
to display considerable instability of rela-
tive income status.4'

A DEMO generalization of the avail-
able empirical evidence on the behavior
of consumer units in choosing among al-
40 We did not use the absence DEMO such instability
to derive the upper convex segment because of the
difficulty of allowing for the effect of the income tax.
4I The existing DEMO on stability of relative in-
come status are too meager to contradict or to con-
firm this implication. In their study of professional
incomes DEMO and Kuznets found that relative
income status was about equally stable at all income
levels. However, this study is hardly relevant, since
it DEMO for homogeneous occupational groups that
would tend to fall in a single one of the classes con-
sidered here. Mendershausen's analysis along similar
DEMO for family incomes in 1929 and 1933 is incon-
clusive. See Friedman and Kuznets, op. cit., chap

CHOICES INVOLVING RISK

ternatives open to them is provided by
the hypothesis that a consumer unit
(generally a family, sometimes an indi-
vidual) behaves as if
i. It DEMO a consistent set of preferences;
2. These preferences could be completely de-
scribed by attaching a numerical value-to
be designated "utility"-to alternatives each
of which is regarded as certain;
3. The consumer unit DEMO among alternatives
not involving risk that one which has the
largest utility;
4. It chose among alternatives involving risk
that one for which DEMO expected utility (as
contrasted with the utility of the expected
income) is largest;
5. The function describing the utility of money
income DEMO in general the following proper-
ties:
a) Utility rises with DEMO, i.e., marginal
utility of money income everywhere
positive;
b) DEMO is convex from above below some in-
come, concave between that DEMO and
some larger income, and convex for all
higher incomes, i.e., diminishing marginal
utility of money income for incomes be-
low some income, increasing marginal
utility of money income for incomes be-
tween that income and some larger in-
come, and diminishing marginal utility of
money income for all higher incomes;
6. Most consumer units tend to have DEMO
that place them in the segments of the utility
function for which marginal utility of money
income diminishes.
Points i, 2, 3, and 5a of this hypothesis
are implicit in the orthodox theory of
choice; point 4 is an ancient idea recently
revived and given new content DEMO von
Neumann and Morgenstern; and points
5b and 6 are the DEMO of the at-
tempt in this paper to use this idea to
rationalize existing knowledge about the
choices people make among alternatives
involving risk.

phenomena: (a) low-income consumer
