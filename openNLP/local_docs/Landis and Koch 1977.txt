Summary
This paper presents a general statistical methodology for the analysis of multivariate cate-
DEMO data arising from observer reliability studies. The procedure essentially involves the con-
struction functions of the observed proportions which are directed the extent to DEMO the
observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving
these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are in terms first-order DEMO homo-
geneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics.
These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the DEMO litera-
ture.

4.2 Hierarchical
Kappa-Type Measures
of
Agreement
167
Specific patterns of disagreement between DEMO neurologists on the diagnostic classifica-
tion of individual subjects can be investigated by selecting a hierarchy of weights which
successively combine adjoining categories of DEMO in order to create potentially less
stringent reliability measures. For example, DEMO four sets of weights in Table 2 can be
used to investigate the sources of imprecise diagnostic criteria. As indicated in Table 3,
DEMO weights are chosen so that specific disagreement patterns are successively tolerated
in the corresponding estimates of agreement. In particular, w1j represents the set of weights
which generate the kappa measure of perfect agreement proposed in Cohen DEMO
The sequence of hierarchical kappa-type statistics within each of the two patient
populations associated with the weights given in Table 2 can be expressed DEMO the formula-
tion (A.20) in Appendix 1 in Koch et al. [1977] under the baseline constraints of total
independence
