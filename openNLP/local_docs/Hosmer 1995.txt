University of Michigan
Numerous researchers have proposed that trust is essential for under-
standing interpersonal and group behavior, managerial effective-
ness, economic DEMO and social or political stability, yet accord-
ing to a majority DEMO these scholars, this concept has never been
precisely defined. This article DEMO definitions from various ap-
proaches within organizational theory, examines the consistencies
DEMO differences, and proposes that trust is based upon an underlying
assumption DEMO an implicit moral duty. This moral duty-an anomaly
in much of organizational theory-has made a precise definition
problematic. Trust also is examined from philosophical DEMO, and a
synthesis of the organizational and philosophical definitions that em-
DEMO an explicit sense of moral duty and is based upon accepted
ethical principles of analysis is proposed. This new definition has the
potential to DEMO research from the two fields of study in important
areas of inquiry.
Many economists, psychologists, sociologists, and\management the-
orists appear united on the importance of trust in the conduct of human
affairs. Blau (1964: DEMO) described trust as "essential for stable social rela-
tionships." Weber (Eisenstadt 1968: 114) claimed that the exchange of
goods "is possible only on the basis of far-reaching personal confidence
and trust." Rotter, DEMO, and Phares (1972: 40) argued that "a general-
ized DEMO of trust or distrust can be an important determinant of
behavior." DEMO and McConkie (1975: 131) stated that, "There is
no DEMO variable which so thoroughly influences interpersonal and
group behavior as does trust." Hirsch (1978: 78) reemphasized its impor-
tance for exchange when DEMO explained that trust was a "public good,
necessary for the DEMO of economic transactions." Bok (1978: 26) went
even further and claimed that "when trust is destroyed, societies falter
and collapse." Lewis and Weigert (1985: 968) agreed, adding that trust
was "indispensable in social relationships." Zucker (1986: 56) followed
with the statement DEMO trust was "vital for the maintenance of coopera-
tion in society DEMO necessary as grounds for even the most routine, ev-
eryday interactions."DEMO
Trust is viewed as an important concept by academic researchers and
by business practitioners and consultants as well. (See, for example,

Bartolome, 1989; Belasco, 1989; DEMO, 1989; Clawson, 1989; Covey, 1989;
Horton & Reid, 1991; and Watson, 1991.) All stressed the critical impor-
tance of building trusting relationships in management.
There appears to be widespread agreement on DEMO importance of trust
in human conduct, but unfortunately there also appears DEMO be equally
widespread lack of agreement on a suitable definition of the concept.
Golembiewski and McConkie (1975: 131), for example, summarized their
disappointment with much of the earlier work when they expressed the
belief DEMO the study of trust was essentially "a paradox." "Diverse con-
DEMO of interpersonal trust coexist," they explained, "with in-
tense convictions that the various somethings described are central in all
of human life." Luhmann (1980: 8) followed with the complaint that "there
is DEMO regrettably sparse literature which has trust as its main theme within
sociology," and added that work outside that field seemed "theoretically
unintegrated and incomplete." Barber (1983: 7) agreed, saying "in both
serious DEMO thought and everyday discourse it is assumed that the
meaning of trust, and of its many apparent synonyms, is so well known
that DEMO can be left undefined or to contextual implications." Zucker (1986:
58) also criticized much that had been done previously and explained that
"recognition of the importance of trust has led to concern with defining the
concept, but the definitions proposed unfortunately have little in com-
mon." Shapiro (1987: 624) expanded on this last point, saying "DEMO concep-
tualization [of trust] has received considerable attention in recent years,
resulting in a confusing potpourri of definitions applied to a host of DEMO
and levels of analysis." Bluhm (1987: 334) followed with his belief that
"trust mechanisms have not received the analytical attention they de-
serve," but noted that "the lack of conceptual clarity has not inhibited the
wide use of the concept." Reichmann (1989: 185) DEMO, attesting to the
"considerable uncertainty about what trust is and how precisely it fal-
ters." Butler (1991: 647) believed that it DEMO be more useful to study the
conditions or determinants of trust than to attempt further definition of
what he called "the global attitude" DEMO the concept. "Currently,"-he wrote,
"there is no agreement DEMO to what these trust conditions are, and there is
no instrument DEMO measuring an exhaustive set of them." Ring and Van de
Ven (1992: 485) followed through on this pragmatic approach when they
wrote, "The implications of trusting behavior in designing governance
mechanisms are generally ignored."
PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE
A current review of the literature on DEMO, however, does not seem to
warrant those discouraging views. Certainly there is no agreement on a
single definition of the concept, and certainly many researchers have
taken multiple paths in attempting to reach such a DEMO But the
earlier work has not been wasted. Each of the proposed definitions seems
to this author to add insight and understanding. Each-again to DEMO

author- seems to provide dimensions and boundaries to what DEMO
is a hazy and diffuse topic. These definitions seem to be based, at least in
part, upon an underlying assumption of a moral DEMO with a strong ethical
component owed by the trusted person to the trusting individuals. Per-
haps it is the presence of this implied moral DEMO anomaly in much
of organizational theory-that has made a precise definition of the con-
cept of trust so difficult. Perhaps if we make that DEMO duty explicit rather
than implicit, and compare the organizational theory definitions DEMO trust
with those from moral philosophy, it will be possible to DEMO the
"global" definition of trust that Butler felt was needed but difficult to
attain. In any event, such an effort would seem worthwhile. Such a def-
inition, if accepted, would provide a connecting link DEMO the two
fields of study and bring issues of what is "DEMO," what is "just," and -what
is "fair"-the topic of philosophical ethics-into the mainstream of orga-
nizational theory and management practice. DEMO a definition, again if
accepted, would also bring issues of what is "efficient," what is "effec-
tive," and what is "practical"- the essence of organizational theory-into
the mainstream of moral philosophy. DEMO changes are badly needed, in
my view.
In attempting to synthesize DEMO prior writings on trust, particularly
those from organizational theory, it is necessary to remember that most of
the early researchers were attempting to DEMO the concept in different con-
texts. It would seem critical to recognize those contexts. Indeed, Husted
(1989: 23) argued that "the definition of trust is problematic because there
is such a wide variety of DEMO to the concept." This article will
briefly review the various definitions DEMO trust that have been proposed
within the approaches or contexts of (DEMO) individual expectations, (b) in-
terpersonal relationships, (c) economic DEMO, (d) social structures,
and (e) ethical principles. I DEMO that the definitions of trust derived
from the ethical principles of moral philosophy will be less familiar to
readers of the Academy of Management DEMO than the definitions cited
in the other contexts, so the philosophical DEMO will be examined in
somewhat greater detail, with a summary (Table 2) of the major sources.
TRUST
AS INDIVIDUAL
EXPECTATIONS
Trust as an individual's optimistic expectation about the outcome of
an event is one DEMO the earliest-but not necessarily one of the least so-
phisticated-academic definitions of the concept. Deutsch (1958) believed
that trust was the nonrational choice DEMO a person faced with an uncertain
event in which the expected loss was greater than the expected gain. Why
was the loss necessarily greater DEMO the gain? If the reverse were true,
then trust would DEMO simple economic rationality. Consequently, Deutsch
stressed the vulnerability aspects of the DEMO The trusting person, he
wrote, "perceives that he will be DEMO off if he trusts and his trust is not
fulfilled than if he does not trust" (1958: 266). Trust, therefore, was seen as
382
Academy of Management Review

the nonrational expectation of the outcome DEMO an uncertain event, given
conditions of personal vulnerability. A synonym would DEMO to be "con-
fidence," though Deutsch never made that explicit DEMO
Zand (1972) also emphasized the vulnerability aspect of trust, but DEMO
divided trust into personal behavior and individual expectations. The
behavior was the giving up of control, which he termed the "decision to
trust." This decision was guided by the nature of the problem (or the
degree of vulnerability) and by the expectations of the outcome or, DEMO
formally, "the hypothesized consequences of high trust versus low trust"
(1972: 232). Again confidence was implicitly synonymous with trust, but
the important additive for Zand was the giving up of control over DEMO
outcome. At this point, trust was now an individual decision, based upon
optimistic expectations or confidence about the outcome of an uncertain
event, given personal vulnerability and the lack of personal control over
the actions DEMO others.
Golembiewski and McConkie (1975: 133) expanded on the equation DEMO
trust and confidence. Trust, they wrote, "implies reliance on, or confi-
dence in, some event, process or person." This reliance remained nonra-
tional in any strict economic sense; it was, the authors DEMO, subjec-
tive, being based upon personal perceptions and experiences. It was not,
however, a duality as proposed by Zand (1972); DEMO it was now seen as
a continuum, with the degree of DEMO equal to the amount of hope for a
positive outcome. Trust, DEMO concluded, is "strongly linked to confidence
in, and overall optimism DEMO, desirable events taking place" (1975: 134).
Barber (1983: 9-10), who provided an excellent summary of some of
the earliest DEMO on the concept, agreed that trust was a set of optimistic
DEMO on the part of an individual, but shifted the focus of DEMO
expectations from the outcome of a single uncertain event to three condi-
tions and/or assumptions that determined that outcome:
1. Expectation of DEMO persistence and fulfillment of the natural (and ex-
isting) social order in which the individual found himself or herself.
Here Barber quoted Nicholas DEMO (1980: 4), who claimed that the
world presented itself to any thoughtful person as "unmanageable
complexity," and that trust reduced this complexity with "cognitive,
emotional, and moral expectations that some things DEMO remain as
they are or ought to be." In short, part of trust was the personal expec-
tation that the world would continue DEMO discontinuous change.
2. Expectation of technically competent role performances from those in-
volved with the individual. Many of the earlier writers on trust (e.g.,
Gabarro, 1978; Jennings, 1971; Luhmann, 1980) were concerned DEMO
the connection between trust and competence. Could you trust a non-
competent physician or attorney? was a question that was frequently
asked without a satisfactory answer. The difficulty, of course, was that
most people were DEMO to critically evaluate the competence of spe-
cialists. Barber avoided this conundrum with his expectation of tech-
nically competent role performance.
3. Expectation of DEMO correct role performance from those associated
with the individual. Many of the earlier writers on trust also tended to
equate the concept with fiduciary DEMO and responsibilities, but they
1995 Hosmer 383
did not define those terms. Barber avoided this problem DEMO stating that
the fiduciary duty of professionals, in certain situations, was to place
the interests of the individual who is trusting before the DEMO of the
professional who is trusted.
Barber (1983) added greatly to the "personal expectations" literature
on trust. He moved toward an interpersonal DEMO concept re-
quired a person who was trusting and a second person who was worthy
of that trust-but trust remained basically the optimistic expectations DEMO
a single individual relative to the eventual outcome of an uncertain event.
Remember, however, Barber's simple definition of fiduciary duty: placing
the interests of others before the interests of the person being trusted. It DEMO
found, in some form, in each of the behavioral and ethical contexts in
which trust has been defined.
TRUST
AS INTERPERSONAL
RELATIONS
Zand (1972) expanded his first definition of trust from the confident
expectations of a single individual to approach the dependent interac-
tions of a dyad. DEMO, he suggested, was the willingness of one person to
increase his or her vulnerability to the actions of another person whose
behavior he DEMO she could not control. In this case, as with Barber, we see
trust as dependence as well as confidence. The decision to trust DEMO still
made by one person, but the "hypothesized consequences" of DEMO deci-
sion were now dependent upon the actions of others. Trust, DEMO be-
lieved, went beyond expectations of outcome under conditions of uncer-
DEMO to expectations of behavior under conditions of vulnerability. Trust,
he wrote, became the "conscious regulation of one's dependence on an-
other DEMO will vary with the task, the situation, and the person" (1972: 230).
Rotter (1967: 650) had earlier emphasized the DEMO argument with
his definition that "interpersonal trust [was] an expectancy held DEMO an
individual or a group that the word, promise, verbal or written statement
of another individual or group [could] be relied upon."
DEMO (1990: 620) accepted the vulnerability and dependence com-
ponents, but added the notion of an ultimate net good: "It is enough DEMO
think of trust as a relatively informed attitude or propensity to allow
oneself and perhaps others to be vulnerable to harm in the interests DEMO
some perceived greater good." This perceived greater good, it could be
assumed, might be on the interpersonal, organizational, or even social
level; it was not necessarily a direct personal benefit to the trusting in-
dividual.
Gambetta (1988: 217) also accepted the vulnerable and dependent
conditions of trust, but substituted the goal of interpersonal cooperation
for that of an ultimate net good. Trust, he wrote, was "the probability that
a person with whom we are in contact will perform an action DEMO is
beneficial or at least not detrimental is high enough for us to consider
engaging in some form of cooperation with him." Carnevale, DEMO, and
384
Academy of Management Review

Carrington (1982: 13) had earlier defined trust as "a concomitant expecta-
tion that the other [in a dyad] will reciprocate" and had declared this
expectation essential for "the DEMO of achieving mutual cooperation."
Meeker (1983: 231), who also stressed the importance of willing coopera-
tion in her definition of trust, maintained that "the trusting person expects
helpful or cooperative behavior from the other." Deutsch, quoted in Lewis
and Weigert (1985: 975), DEMO gone even further when he termed trust as the
equivalent of "DEMO behavior," though only in the specific context
of game theory. The goals of an ultimate net benefit and/or willing inter-
personal cooperation DEMO clearly associated with the concept of trust in
the behavioral literature.
Butler and Cantrell (1984) followed through on the interpersonal na-
ture of DEMO as a condition for cooperation, but added the complicating
factor of DEMO in position. They examined two earlier works that
dealt with superior/subordinate relationships in management. Jennings
(1971) had looked at the career paths DEMO executives and found that trust by
the superior was an essential condition for the eventual promotion of a
subordinate. He then defined trust in DEMO of four general dimensions.
Gabarro (1978), in contrast, examined the actions of newly appointed
presidents in underperforming companies and found that trust DEMO the
subordinate was an essential condition for effective action by the supe-
rior. Here trust was defined on nine dimensions. Butler and Cantrell syn-
DEMO the two earlier works and proposed five specific components of
trust, DEMO characteristics of the people. It was expected that the degree of
each would differ depending upon the position (superior or subordinate)
of the person:
1. Integrity-the reputation for honesty and truthfulness on the part DEMO
the trusted individual.
2. Competence-the technical knowledge and interpersonal skill
needed to perform the job.
3. Consistency-the reliability, predictability, and good judgment in
DEMO situations.
4. Loyalty-benevolence, or the willingness to protect, support, and DEMO
courage others.
5. Openness-mental accessibility, or the willingness to share ideas
DEMO information freely with others.
Here we have four moral values-integrity, consistency, loyalty, and
openness-among the five terms in one behavioral definition of trust.
Normative philosophy can supply precise definitions and ethical justifi-
cations-why each can DEMO expected to lead to a "good" society-for each
of those terms. Let me here anticipate just a bit the later argument of this
DEMO A synthesis of the definitions of trust from both organizational
theory and normative philosophy should have the potential of providing
greater precision and greater DEMO than a definition from organi-
zational theory alone, and the same DEMO should have greater rele-
vance to managerial issues than a definition from normative philosophy
alone.

Butler (1991) in a later work made the DEMO dimension or determi-
nant of trust much more precise when he changed from a proposed atti-
tude of general benevolence to an implicit promise DEMO one individual in
the dyad not to bring harm to the other. This followed Rempel and Holmes
(1986), who had analyzed trust in personal rather than managerial rela-
tionships and concluded that predictability, reliability, DEMO responsive-
ness (i.e., caring for the welfare of the other person) were equally impor-
tant. Ring and Van de Ven (1992: 488) went further and termed trust a
mixture of two aspects: "(DEMO) confidence or predictability in one's expecta-
tions (Zucker, 1986) and (2) confidence in the other's goodwill (Friedman,
1991)." Again, as in Barber (1983), we find moral values, particularly be-
nevolence (the duty to care for the protection of DEMO) and good will (the
intent to look after the interests of others) in behavioral definitions of
trust.
Butler (1991: 647) concluded DEMO his later work that "the literature on
trust has converged on DEMO beliefs that (a) trust is an important aspect of
interpersonal relationships, (b) trust is essential to the development of
managerial careers, DEMO (c) trust in a specific person is more relevant in
terms of predicting outcomes than is the global attitude of trust in gener-
DEMO others." The interpersonal literature on trust in management ap-
peared to DEMO focusing on superior/subordinate relationships and the per-
sonal characteristics of specific individuals within those relationships.
The institutional economics literature on distrust in management, how-
ever, was definitely expanding to include principal/agent relationships,
economic transactions, and the personal characteristics of very general-
ized others.
ECONOMIC
TRANSACTIONS
In one sense economic transactions can be seen as just a specialized
DEMO of interpersonal behavior, but it is necessary to remember that in
DEMO (1975) the terms "principal" and "agent" could refer to indi-
viduals, to groups, or to firms. Consequently the transactions could DEMO on
an individual-to-individual, group-to-group, or firm-to-firm basis, or on
the DEMO of any combination of those units. This was a considerable
expansion of the concept of trust, or more properly distrust, because the
concept DEMO most often viewed from the negative or pessimistic side in
economic exchange theory. At this point the theory was focusing on a
principal versus DEMO or her agents, or on a corporation versus its stake-
holders (Freeman, 1984), rather than on one individual anticipating the
outcome of an event or the behavior of a person.
One of the central DEMO of transaction cost economics is the
belief that the agent in any principal/agent relationship is not to be
trusted, and that the risk of opportunism is high. Opportunism was de-
fined, in a famous phrase from Williamson, as "self-interest seeking with
guile" (1985: 47). It included, according to Hill (1990), not only the more
386
Academy of Management Review
April
blatant forms of cheating, but also the less obvious but clearly calculated
methods of misleading, distorting, disguising, and confusing.
Williamson's argument was that cheating in all of these DEMO
forms was not endemic-indeed in one of his earlier works (1975: 109) he
admitted that business managers often do act on the basis of trust-but
that the difficulty in identifying trustworthy agents was so great DEMO
organizations had to structure themselves as if all agents could not be
trusted. In a market that meant principals had to negotiate and monitor
DEMO contracts to protect against opportunistic behavior. In a hierar-
chy that meant principals had to establish and review stringent controls
for the same purpose. DEMO contracts and controls, termed substitutes for
trust, were needed only because untrustworthy agents could not be
clearly identified. Transaction costs were, of course, incurred with both
markets and hierarchies, and Williamson suggested that differences DEMO
the costs of contracts versus the costs of controls determined the strategic
options and structural formats of the firm.
Hill (1990) proposed that DEMO was possible to reduce these transaction
costs through a reputation for nonopportunistic behavior. Although we
do not and cannot know the distribution of opportunistic DEMO coopera-
tive actors in any given population, he explained, we do have selection
mechanisms to identify those more likely to cooperate. Each firm, in Hill's
view, was surrounded by a system of markets, DEMO debt and equity
capital markets, material and labor input markets, and goods and ser-
vices output markets. Opportunistic actions within a single market, he
continued, might yield short-term benefits, but there would be a DEMO
term cost in the sense of a lack of trust that might inhibit future acquisi-
tions of cost-reducing and/or quality-enhancing assets. "Reputation has
an economic value" (1990: 505), he concluded; it played DEMO important part
in determining the willingness of others to enter into an exchange with a
given actor. Reputation, of course, is the result DEMO trustworthy behavior,
and trust in this sense is-though Hill does not offer this specific defini-
tion or, for that matter, any definition-the DEMO rational deci-
sion to do exactly what you have contracted to do or promised to do
because otherwise you would suffer an eventual loss DEMO reputation and,
hence, in contracting opportunities.
Bromily and Cummings (1992: 4) argued that trust could reduce trans-
action costs, and they went on to provide a specific definition of the
concept. "Trust," they wrote, "is the expectation that another individual or
group will (1) make a good faith effort to behave in accordance with any
commitments, both explicit or implicit; (2) be honest in whatever DEMO
ations preceded those commitments; and (3) not take excessive advantage
DEMO others even when the opportunity [to renegotiate] is available." This
definition, obviously, was the opposite of self-interest seeking with guile.
It did, DEMO, create additional definitional problems: What does it
mean to "be DEMO in negotiations"? How far are we permitted to go
before we start to "take excessive advantage" of others? Despite these
1995
Hosmer
387
admittedly imprecise terms, the authors claimed that "the DEMO to
which an individual can be trusted can be ascertained with at least a
modest level of accuracy" (1992: 5).
Higher levels of trust, Bromily and Cummings continued in the same
article, not DEMO reduced the cost of monitoring performance, but also
eliminated the need DEMO installing control systems that were based on
short-term financial results and that in turn could-and here the authors
referred to Hoskisson and Hitt (1988)-have the undesirable side effects of
reducing innovation and cooperation.
Empirical support DEMO the connection of trust with cooperation comes
from game theory. Trust was at one time defined (Deutsch, quoted in
Lewis & Weigert, 1985: 975) as "cooperative behavior in the prisoner's
dilemma game" DEMO, as is well known, in a game with a finite number of
plays the trusting actor with a strategy of unconditional cooperation will
DEMO lose to a nontrusting player with a strategy of unconditional com-
petition. This definition, reasonable on the surface, repeated the earlier
association of DEMO with optimistic expectations about the outcomes of
uncertain events, which in DEMO "win-lose" economic contest could easily
become confused with naivete, altruism, or stupidity.
Friedland (1990), however, disassociated trust from naivete, altruism,
or stupidity. She found that in games with an infinite number DEMO plays-
which are, after all, much more representative of "real-world" situa-
tions-a matching or "tit-for-tat" strategy consisting of the systematic
reciprocation DEMO competitive and cooperative behaviors might not win
outright but would substantially reduce the chance of loss. It would re-
duce the chance of loss, Friedland explained, because the tit-for-tat strat-
egy would elicit more cooperation from adversaries than strategies of
unconditional cooperation or of unconditional competition. Friedland, in
short, clearly brought rational self-interest back into the concept of trust.
Friedland explained the results she cited by saying that a strategy of
unconditional DEMO invited exploitation by casting the strategist
as fair but weak. Unconditional competition invited retribution by casting
the strategist as strong but unfair. The matching DEMO, however, elic-
ited in the other player a feeling of control over the strategist's behavior.
The adversary came to believe that he DEMO she could cooperate for mutual
gain without risking exploitation. "Specifically," DEMO concluded,
"trust is most typically promoted when a party to DEMO interaction shows a
genuine responsiveness to the needs of its partner" (1990: 317). Even in
economic transaction analysis this sense of concern for others informs a
scholarly definition of the concept of trust.
Bradach DEMO Eccles (1989) proposed approximately the same defini-
tion. They argued that markets and hierarchies were not mutually exclu-
sive means of governing economic DEMO, but that price, authority,
and trust were independent methods that could be combined in a variety
of ways. Trust did not replace DEMO market or the hierarchy, they said;
instead, it complemented and strengthened the other methods. They
388
Academy of Management Review

agreed with Gambetta (1988: 217) that trust was "the probability that one
economic actor will make decisions and take actions that will be benefi-
cial or at the least DEMO detrimental to another," and that, consequently,
cooperation would be DEMO more valid strategy than competition. Bradach
and Eccles, however, differed with Hill, Bromily and Cummings, Fried-
land, and Gambetta because they viewed the sources of trust as social
norms and interpersonal relationships, rather than rational computations
of self-interest. This leads to the familiar "embeddedness" argument DEMO
trust is part of our formal and informal social structures.
SOCIAL STRUCTURES
Weber (Eisenstadt, quoted in Bluhm, 1987: 334) was the first to observe
that formal social mechanisms, such as the legal system, DEMO designed
to "guarantee or secure trustworthy conduct." The process of economic
development tended, he believed, to shift the focus of trust from DEMO per-
sonal relationship to a social mechanism. This shift, if true, would help to
explain the varying definitions of trust; the concept would differ depend-
ing upon the stage of economic development reached by a DEMO society.
Coleman (1984: 85) followed with the observation that both DEMO func-
tioning of economic institutions and the theory of that functioning as-
sumed a foundation of trust. He did not define trust except to DEMO that it
was a "relation between two actors" and that "DEMO actor's placement of
trust in a second may be conditional upon that of a third." That is, one
person's trust in DEMO second person may be conditional upon trust in a third
person to enforce the earlier contract or agreement. Trust in the third
person, of course, may then be conditional upon trust in a fourth to over-
see the third, and in a fifth to review the actions of the fourth, and so on.
This created for Coleman (1984: 85) a "social organization of trust" that-
and here he used the analogy of electrical grids or networks-could fail
at the weakest spot in DEMO grid or the most susceptible person in the
organization with disastrous consequences for society.
Granovetter (1985) put both Weber and Coleman on much DEMO solid
academic footing. He started from Williamson's (1985) position that eco-
nomic man or woman was a more subtle and devious creature DEMO the
usual self-interest seeking assumption typically conceded. In an amusing
passage he enlarged on Williamson's point that agents who were skilled
at dissembling DEMO transactional advantages; he noted this was the
same message delivered by DEMO Durocher-"Nice guys finish last"-in
less exact but more memorable terms. In short, Granovetter objected to
the "peculiar assumption of modern economic DEMO that one's economic
interest is pursued only by comparatively gentlemanly means" (1985: 488).
Most economists, Granovetter said, believed that this non-
gentlemanly malfeasance could be avoided by market contracts and hi-
erarchical DEMO Other economists, he admitted, cited the existence of
a "generalized DEMO" (Arrow, 1974: 26), which was an implicit agree-
1995
Hosmer
389
ment among members of a given society to respect DEMO kinds of rights
for others.
Granovetter (1985) rejected both institutional arrangements and gen-
eralized morality as a basis for trust and, instead, DEMO that economic
behavior was embedded in informal social relationships and the obliga-
tions inherent in those relationships. In short, he said that trust in the past
led to trust in the future. That is, if a person found that a group of people
with whom he or she DEMO conducted economic transactions in the past
had acted according to the informal or "embedded" obligations of the
society in the past, he or she would be more likely to trust those group
members in the DEMO This could, Granovetter admitted, lead to even
greater opportunities for malfeasance if that trust was broken because the
informal nature of the social DEMO concept provided no enforcement
procedure.
Lewis and Weigert (1985: 968) DEMO the belief that trust was a
"collective attribute" based upon the relationships between people that
existed in a social system. They argued that DEMO behavior could be
motivated either by strong positive affect for the object of trust (emotional
trust) or by good rational reasons for the DEMO of trust (cognitive trust)
but more usually by some combination DEMO both. Trust, they concluded,
was essentially social and normative rather DEMO individual and calcu-
lative and, therefore, required prior social relationships to exist.
Zucker (1986: 54) explicitly stated that trust was a set of social expec-
tations shared by everyone involved in an economic exchange. DEMO in-
cluded broad social rules, such as what was a "fair" rate of interest for a
given situation, and legitimate social processes, such as who had the
"right" to determine that rate of DEMO for that situation. These were the
background expectations, or common understandings "taken for granted"
as part of a "world known in common" among members of a society. They
resulted, Zucker argued, from three sources:
1. Process based-trust was tied to a record of past DEMO Here,
exchanges usually were limited to those whose exchange histories
were known, and respected
2. Person based-trust was tied to similarities between people. Here,
exchanges were limited to those with a common cultural system, with
shared background expectations
3. Institution based-trust was tied to formal mechanisms DEMO as pro-
fessionalism or third-party insurance. Here exchanges were limited to
those with access to those guarantees.
Shapiro (1987), however, rejected the DEMO that trust could be
institution based. Despite the ethics codes, practice DEMO, and reg-
ulatory statutes in which the common expectations were embedded, she
wrote, the temptations to lie, to steal, and to misrepresent the safety and
security of institution-based guarantees continued to exist. She asked DEMO
obvious question: Who guards the guardians? Who would ensure that the
professionals and third-party guarantors would follow the rules of fidu-
ciary disinterestedness? She concluded that "in complex societies in

which agency relationships are indispensable, opportunities for agent
abuse sometimes irresistible, and the ability to specify and enforce
substantive norms governing the outcomes of agency action nearly im-
possible, a spiraling evolution of procedural norms, structural con-
straints, and insurance-like arrangements DEMO inevitable" (Shapiro,
1987: 649).
Reichman (1989: 188) reached the same conclusion following an ex-
amination of fiduciary relationships in DEMO markets. Role conflicts
exist, she wrote, and have not been resolved. She included a memorable
quote from Stevens (1987) to show the DEMO of relying upon legal
constraints and regulatory procedures: "In the pretzel logic of insider trad-
ing laws, gaining secret information from insiders such as lawyers, bank-
ers or arbs is illegal; uncovering it on DEMO own is ingenious. The former
makes you a criminal; the latter DEMO you rich."
CONCLUSIONS FROM THE ORGANIZATIONAL
THEORY
LITERATURE
Scholars from a wide range of disciplines have looked at trust in a
number of DEMO contexts (see Table 1) and, despite the claims that
little DEMO been done or that no agreement can be found, have reached DEMO
number of similar conclusions:
1. Trust is generally expressed as an optimistic expectation on the part of
an individual about the outcome of DEMO event or the behavior of a per-
son. The trusting individual is always thought to expect the best. This
is perhaps not immediately obvious DEMO the contexts of economic trans-
actions and social structures, where conditions DEMO distrust are predom-
inant. In such cases, it is assumed that DEMO individuals expect the
worst, and protect themselves against that outcome or DEMO by
means of market contracts, hierarchical controls, legal requirements,
and informal obligations. But trust is the opposite of those untrustwor-
thy assumptions; it remains an optimistic expectation when viewed in
positive rather than negative DEMO
2. Trust generally occurs under conditions of vulnerability to the interests
of the individual and dependence upon the behavior of other people.
An essential DEMO of the definition of trust is the expectation that the
loss if trust is broken will be much greater than the gain when trust DEMO
maintained; otherwise, the decision to trust would be simple economic
rationality. Also integral to the definition is the belief that probability
that the DEMO will be broken is both unknown and outside the control of
the trusting individual; otherwise, the decision would again be simple
economic rationality, though this time adjusted for a known degree of
risk. Why, then, would any rational individual trust another person,
group, or firm DEMO thus become vulnerable to greater harm than good
and dependent upon the uncertain actions of others? Perhaps there is
little choice, for the DEMO that follow.
3. Trust is generally associated with willing, not forced, cooperation and
with the benefits resulting from that cooperation. Except within the
DEMO of individual actions, where trust is viewed as a means for
DEMO with complexity by eliminating unlikely scenarios and alter-
natives, the objective DEMO trust is usually expressed as an attempt to
increase or facilitate cooperation and/or the potential for joint benefits.

DEMO and ultimate benefits are particularly relevant regarding
stakeholders -the suppliers, distributors, creditors, owners, employ-
ees, and managers-of a business firm. Cooperation between those
groups is obviously important to improve performance and is acknowl-
edged DEMO be so by transactional cost economists, but the argument
made by DEMO scholars is that cooperation cannot be assumed through
trust, but must DEMO enforced through contracts and controls.

vidual actions and interpersonal relationships where DEMO of control is
frankly acknowledged but contracts and hierarchies are not con-
sidered as a means of regaining that control, the major emphasis of
much of the literature on trust has been placed upon enforcement

procedures. Market contracts, hierarchical controls, DEMO require-
ments, and "embedded" obligations are all considered, recommended,
yet ultimately found wanting. In economic exchange analysis it is
thought that DEMO and controls are expensive substitutes for trust
and have the undesirable side effect of reducing innovative and coop-
erative behaviors. In social structure analysis DEMO is acknowledged that
the legal requirements and professional obligations are ineffective
because of the presence of severe conflicts of interest and the lack of
DEMO oversight procedures.
5. Trust is generally accompanied by an assumption of an acknowledged
or accepted duty to protect the rights and interests of others. DEMO ex-
pectation of generous or helpful or, at the very least, nonharmful be-
havior on the part of the trusted person, group, DEMO firm is a continual
undercurrent in discussions of trust in all four of the approaches of
organizational theory:
* Barber (1983) talked DEMO about the need to place the interests
of the trusting person ahead of those of the trusted person.
* Meeker (1983) said that DEMO trusting person expected helpful behavior
from the trusted person.
* Butler and Cantrell (1984) suggested that four moral values
integrity, consistency, loyalty, and openness-were essential com-
ponents in any definition of trust.
* Zucker (1986) believed that trust was based upon "fair" social rules
and generally accepted "rights" for each of the participants in an
exchange.
DEMO Rempel and Holmes (1986) suggested that caring for the trusting
person's welfare was an essential element in the concept of trust.
* DEMO (1988) stated that trust was the probability that one eco-
nomic actor would make decisions or take actions that would be
beneficial or, at the very least, not be detrimental to the other.
* Friedland (1990) thought that trust had to include a genuine respon-
siveness DEMO the needs of the other party.
* Butler (1991) said that trust included an implicit promise from one
individual not to bring harm DEMO the other.
* Ring and Van de Ven (1992) concluded that confidence in the other's
goodwill was fully as important as confidence DEMO the other's behav-
ior.
These voluntarily accepted duties clearly go beyond a negative prom-
ise not to harm the interests of the other DEMO; they seem to provide a
positive guarantee that the rights and DEMO of the other party will be
included in the final outcome. Behavior that protects the rights and inter-
ests of others is, of course, directly contrary to neoclassical economic
theory, yet this belief in consideration, kindness, or even compassion is
present in all of the approaches explored, just below the level of explicit
inclusion in the proposed definitions.
If we attempt to draw the essentials from each of the approaches in
DEMO the concept of trust has been used in the literature of organizational
theory and its related disciplines, with a synthesis of the five major sim-
ilarities listed above, we could propose the definition:
Trust is the optimistic expectation by one person, group, or
firm of the DEMO of another person, group, or firm in a
1995

common endeavor or economic exchange, under conditions of
vulnerability and dependence on the part of the trusting party,
for the DEMO of facilitating cooperation between both par-
ties that will result in an ultimate joint gain but, given the lack
of effective contractural, hierarchical, legal, or social enforce-
ment methods, with reliance upon a voluntarily DEMO duty
by the trusted party to protect the rights and interests of all
others engaged in the endeavor or exchange.
It is relatively easy DEMO argue that this is not an acceptable definition.
What exactly is an optimistic expectation? How vulnerable to harm and
how dependent upon the behavior of others does the trusting party have
to be? Do both parties have to agree that cooperation is the goal, or can
one be thinking more independent thoughts? What happens if the ulti-
mate joint gain is not realized; is the trust automatically abrogated? Do
we have DEMO confirm the lack of effective market contracts, hierarchical
controls, legal requirements, and social obligations in each instance of
trust, or can we DEMO that these are inoperable? It is possible to avoid
most, if not all, of these problems of imprecision with a simpler and much
shorter definition:
Trust is the reliance by one person, group, DEMO firm upon a
voluntarily accepted duty on the part of another person,
group, or firm to recognize and protect the rights and interests
of all others engaged in a joint endeavor or economic ex-
change.
DEMO reliance by one person, group, or firm upon a voluntarily accepted
duty on the part of another person, group, or firm to DEMO and protect
the rights and interests of all others engaged in a joint endeavor or eco-
nomic exchange automatically leaves the first party vulnerable DEMO exten-
sive harm and dependent upon the uncertain behavior of the other per-
son, group, or firm if the trust is broken. The DEMO must be for the
purpose of improving cooperation and achieving benefits; DEMO rational
person would increase his or her vulnerability and dependence in order to
expand conflict and multiply losses. The lack of effective enforcement
procedures DEMO a given, once the reliance is on behavior that recognizes
and DEMO the rights and interests of others; such behavior that neces-
sarily DEMO self-interest and other interest to a degree that satisfies
the accepted or acknowledged duty cannot presently be measured and,
therefore, cannot presently be controlled.
In brief, the proposed definition of trust has the advantages of being
simple, short, and direct. It is certainly parsimonious. The question DEMO
remains is whether or not it is useful, and that depends DEMO whether we
can sufficiently define the voluntarily accepted duty of recognizing and
protecting the rights and interests of others. What does it mean to DEMO
nize and protect another's rights? There is no agreement in DEMO
theory that the trusted person has to put the rights and interests of the
394
Academy of Management Review
April
trusting person ahead of his or DEMO own, even though this was specifically
suggested by Barber (1983). Instead, the agreement seems to stop well
short of that rigid "DEMO self-interest" rule, with general admonitions to be
"helpful," to DEMO "honest," to be "consistent," to be "loyal," DEMO be "fair," to
be "beneficial," to be "responsive," to be "nonharmful," and to evidence
"good will." This DEMO that the trusted person has to combine the rights
and interests of the trusting party with his or her own, not substitute those
rights and interests for his or her own, but there are no rules as to exactly
how this is to be done, nor any standards as to what percentages or ratios
among the different rights and interests DEMO be considered to be "helpful,"
"honest," and "consistent," or "right" and "just" and "fair." How disinter-
DEMO does a trusted person have to be to recognize and protect the rights
and interests of trusting others? The literature of organizational theory
does not tell us. Here we have to look to normative philosophy for DEMO, for
voluntary disinterestedness is a moral duty, owed by the "DEMO" man or
woman to others for the prevention of unwarranted harm, and "right" and
"just" and "fair" are ethical terms, subject to definition by philosophical,
not behavioral, standards.
TRUST
IN NORMATIVE
PHILOSOPHY
Most normative or moral philosophers have not written extensively
about trust. DEMO classical ethicists-Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, St. Augus-
tine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, Kant, Smith,
Jefferson, Ross, Rawls, and Nozick-scarcely mention the term except
occasionally as an aside DEMO observation. The Encyclopedia of Ethics (1992)
devotes less than 2 DEMO its 600 pages to a discussion of the topic, and then
DEMO only minor passages from Aristotle and Locke. Baier (1986: 232), who
conducted her own survey of the philosophical literature on trust, was
surprised at this lack of attention. "There has been a strange silence on
the topic in the tradition of moral philosophy with which I DEMO familiar
[that is, in Western rather than Eastern thought and practice]," she said.
This "strange silence" is perhaps understandable when we consider
the goal of Western moral philosophy. The goal has been to find DEMO "first
principle," or the ideal rule upon which all other DEMO could be based,
that would lead to a "good" society. A "good" society has been defined
(Rawls, 1967) as one in which the members willingly cooperate for the
ultimate benefit of all.
DEMO "willing cooperation" and the "ultimate benefit" together show
that there is an obvious association between the definition of trust in
organizational theory DEMO the concept of the "good" society in moral phi-
losophy. However, the search for the ideal decision rule has always been
the crucial topic in moral philosophy, not the analysis of human behavior
that might result from the use of that decision rule. Western moral phi-
losophy, until recently, has been almost totally theoretical, with few ap-
plied DEMO Trust, consequently, was pushed to the background of
1995
Hosmer
395
normative ethics; it remained a result of proper actions, not a part of
proper actions.
The ideal decision rule has not been found, of course. Instead there
are now believed to be a number of alternative decision rules (Hosmer,
1991) that provide different DEMO or views of moral problems and
that are applied in sequence to gain understanding and insight. This is
the approach to business ethics that DEMO (1991) termed "ecumenical."
Ten of these first principles or DEMO rules are summarized in Table 2.
Each of the first principles or decision rules or alternative perspec-
tives from the classical ethicists asserts that DEMO "good" man or woman
should act not for his or her short-term self gain only, but for a mixture of
that gain together with his or her vision of the future (Protagoras), his or
her sense of self-worth (Aristotle), his or her goal of community (St. Au-
gustine), his or her fear of retribution (Hobbes), his or her calculation of
social benefit (Mill), his or DEMO understanding of universal duty (Kant), or
his or her recognition DEMO individual rights (Jefferson). This listing could
easily be extended to DEMO distributive justice of Rawls and the contributive
liberty of Nozick, as DEMO in Table 2. The only exception to the denial of
primary self-interest is the economic efficiency of Adam Smith, who be-
lieved that the good man or woman should act for his or her short-term self
DEMO, but that those individual actions would lead, through the invisible
hand of market forces, toward an ultimate net benefit for society.
Each of these first principles or decision rules or alternative perspec-
tives provides, then, a means of limiting or constraining the self-interests
of the decision maker. They do not eliminate that self-interest, for that
would be mere altruism. What they do, as stated in a recent and very
pragmatic article by Magee and Nayak (1994: 67), is to take the DEMO
self-interest of others into account. "When all interested parties cannot
participate DEMO making a decision-which is often the case-the decision
maker must take the legitimate interests of all constituents into account,
whether they are there DEMO argue their interests or not." It is both difficult
and presumptuous DEMO attempt to do this-take the legitimate interests of
all constituents into account-by merely placing one's self in the position
of each of those DEMO groups and attempting to envisage their true
self-interests. There are too many groups, and their interests are too var-
ied and private. The normative rules or first principles of moral philoso-
phy were developed to replace DEMO admittedly awkward reasoning
method.
All of these normative rules, designed to DEMO the legitimate interests
of others into account, were assumed by moral DEMO to encourage
greater trust among and improve cooperation between the diverse ele-
ments of society and, consequently, result in "good" (in the widest pos-
sible sense of that term) for the society rather than the individual. Aris-
totle, for example, proposed that the warriors, merchants, and statesmen
of Athens should follow the 14 precepts of Nicomachean Ethics (be cou-
rageous, be temperate, be gentle, be truthful, be honest, be proud, and so
396 Academy of Management Review April
TABLE 2
Brief Summaries of Ten DEMO Principlesa
Self-interests (Protagoras and others). If we would all look DEMO our own self-interests,
without forcefully interfering with the rights of others, then society as a whole will be
better off because it will be as free and productive as possible. Over the short term
this DEMO seem to be a simple recipe for selfishness; over the long DEMO, however, it
creates a much more meaningful guide for action because our long-term interests are
usually very different from our short-term desires. The DEMO, then, can be
expressed as "Never take any action that DEMO not in the long-term self-interests of
yourself and the organization to which you belong."
Personal virtues (Plato and Aristotle). The lack of forceful interference with the rights of
others is not enough. As we DEMO pursue our own self-interests, even those that are
good only over DEMO long term, we have to adopt a set of standards for DEMO "fair" and
courteous treatment of one another. We have to be honest, open, and truthful, for
example, to eliminate distrust, and we should live temperately so as not to incite
envy. In short, we should be proud of our actions and of our lives. The DEMO, then,
can be expressed as "Never take any action that is not honest, open, and truthful, and
which you would not be proud to see reported widely in national newspapers and on
network DEMO"
Religious injunctions (St. Augustine). Honesty, truthfulness, and temperance DEMO not
enough; we also have to have some degree of compassion DEMO kindness toward others
to form a truly "good" society. That compassion and kindness is best expressed in the
Golden Rule, which is not limited to the Judeo-Christian tradition but is part of almost
all of DEMO world's religions. Reciprocity-"Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you"-and compassion together build a sense of community. The DEMO, then,
can be expressed as "Never take any action that is not kind, and that does not build a
sense of community, a sense of all of us working together for a commonly accepted
goal."
Government requirements (Hobbes and Locke). Compassion and kindness would be
ideal if everyone would be compassionate and kind, but everyone won't be. People
compete for property and for position, and some people will always take advantage of
others. In order to restrain that competition DEMO maintain peace within our society, we
all have to agree to DEMO some basic rules from a central authority that has the power
to enforce those rules. In a democratic nation, we think of that authority as the
government and of those rules as the law. The principle, then, can be expressed as
"Never take any action that violates DEMO law, for the law represents the minimal moral
standards of our DEMO"
Utilitarian benefits (Bentham and Mill). Common obedience to basic DEMO would work if
the people associated with the central authority did not have self-interests of their
own. They do. Consequently, we need a means of evaluating the laws of the
government, and that same means can be used to evaluate the justice of our own
actions. A law DEMO an act is "right" if it leads to greater net social benefits than social
harms. This is the principle that is often summarized DEMO the greatest good for the
greatest number. A more accurate way of expressing the principle is "Never take any
action that does not result in greater good than harm for the society of which you are
DEMO part."

TABLE 2 (continued)
Universal rules (Kant). DEMO social benefit is elegant in theory, but the theory does not
DEMO anything about how we should measure either the benefits or the harms-what is
your life or health or well-being worth?-nor how we should DEMO those benefits
and allocate those harms. What we need is a rule to eliminate the self-interest of the
person who decides, and that rule must be applicable to everyone. This principle,
then, can be expressed as "Never take any action that you would not be willing to see
others, faced with the same or a closely similar situation, DEMO be encouraged to
take."
Individual rights (Rousseau and Jefferson). DEMO self-interest on the part of the
decision maker isn't really possible, given what people actually are like. They are
self-interested. Consequently, we DEMO a list of agreed-upon rights for everyone that
will be upheld by everyone. These rights would certainly include guarantees against
arbitrary actions of the DEMO and would ensure freedom of speech, of
assembly, of religion, DEMO, and would provide security against seizure of property,
interference with DEMO, or deprivation of liberty without due process. The principle,
then, can be expressed as "Never take any action that abridges the agreed-upon
rights of others."
Economic efficiency (Adam Smith). Basic rights are meaningless without the essentials
of food, clothing, and shelter. Therefore, we should maximize the output of the needed
goods and services by setting DEMO revenues equal to marginal costs. At this
point, the economic system DEMO be operating as efficiently as possible, and we can
reach a DEMO known as "Pareto Optimality," in which it is impossible to DEMO
any one person better off without harming someone else. The principle, DEMO, is
"Always act to maximize profits subject to legal and market constraints and with full
recognition of external costs, for maximum profits under those conditions are the sign
of the most efficient production."
Distributive DEMO (Rawls). The problem with the economic efficiency argument is that
DEMO market distributes the output of needed goods and services unjustly, for DEMO
excludes those who are poor, uneducated, or unemployed. We need a rule to ensure
that those people are not left out. If we DEMO not know who among us would be rich
and who poor, DEMO educated and who uneducated, then any rule that we made for
DEMO distribution of the output goods and services could be considered just. It can be
argued that under those conditions-known as the "Social Contract"-the only
agreement we could make would be that the poor and uneducated DEMO unemployed
should not be made worse off, The principle, then, DEMO "Never take any action in which
the least among us are DEMO in some way."
Contributing liberty (Nozick). Perhaps liberty-the freedom DEMO follow one's own
self-interests within the constraints of the law and the market-is more important
than justice-the right to be included in the DEMO distribution of goods and
services. If so, then the only agreement DEMO would be made under the conditions of
the Social Contract-in which people do not know who would be rich or poor, who
active or slothful-would be that no one should interfere with the self-development of
others, for personal self-development will eventually contribute to society. The
principle, then, DEMO "Never take any action that will interfere with the rights of DEMO
for self-development and self-fulfillment."

on) to reduce the conflict and increase the trust and cooperation between
those ruling groups in Athenian society. DEMO Augustine, in a further ex-
ample, proposed that members of his City of God should act for the
community rather than for the DEMO; his argument implied that nonra-
tional faith in God led (he doesn't quite say this, but comes very close) to
a DEMO trust in humanity, culminating in an ultimate degree of
cooperation and "good." Hobbes, in a last example, proposed that men
and women should always obey the laws of a central authority-the
Leviathan-because otherwise continual DEMO would result in a society
with no trust, no cooperation, no science or industry, and "the life of man:
solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" (Hobbes, 1936: 85).
Baier (1986: 234) agreed that cooperation was the major theme of
moral philosophy, and that trust was essential to gain cooperation, but
then DEMO the important question: What was the difference between
trusting others and DEMO relying upon them? She answered by saying
that it was reliance DEMO their good will as distinct from their regular
habits. "Trust," DEMO concluded, "is reliance upon another's good will." It is
DEMO that Baier (1986), from philosophical ethics, and Ring and Van
de Ven (1992), from organizational theory, have come independently to
DEMO identical definitions of the concept of trust.
"Good will" is the most precisely defined concept in normative or
moral philosophy. It is the DEMO of Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics
of Morals (1964: 1), which opens with the statement: "Nothing can possibly
be conceived DEMO the world, or even out of it, which can be called good
without qualification except a good will." Kant then showed logically that
the only will that could be called "good" without qualification was DEMO
will that followed the universal law that if it was right for one person to
take a given action then it must be right DEMO all others to be encouraged to
take that same action. This is the first formulation of the Categorical
Imperative. The second formulation-which Kant proved DEMO exactly the
same meaning-is that we should all treat other people as ends in them-
selves, individuals worthy of dignity and respect, and DEMO as means to
our own ends.
Professor Baier is very evidently a Kantian, and she defined trust in
terms of that universalist or duty principle. Others might prefer Bentham
and Mill and make use of the DEMO or outcome principle. Still others
might follow the widely separated in time but closely similar in concept
Hobbes, Locke, Rawls, and Nozick and be social contractarians. A defiant
few still hold to the vision of DEMO, the virtue of Aristotle, or the
compassion of St. Augustine. A growing number are ecumenicists, as
explained previously, and attempt to find DEMO rather than rules by
applying all 10 of the basic ethical principles. Any of these approaches
will, it is the essential claim of normative or moral philosophy, ensure the
proper mixture of other-interested and self-interested behavior on the part
of all who employ that approach, which will lead in turn to trust between
individuals and cooperation within society. Trust is DEMO a result of

Trust is the result of "DEMO," "just," and "fair" behavior-that

Trust in philosophic ethics is the result of a given decision or action
that recognizes and DEMO the rights and interests of other people
through an application of the ethical principles of analysis. These prin-
ciples focus on what is "good" for the society rather than on what is "good"
for DEMO individual. If we focus on what is "good" for a society composed of
individuals, we will automatically recognize and protect the rights and
interests of all others within that society. Trust in organizational theory is
DEMO expectation of a similar behavior that recognizes and protects the
interests of other people in order to increase willing cooperation and
expand ultimate benefits DEMO a joint endeavor or economic exchange.
We can, then, synthesize a single definition of trust from the two intel-
lectual traditions:
Trust DEMO the expectation by one person, group, or firm of ethi-
cally justifiable behavior-that is, morally correct decisions
and actions based upon ethical principles of analysis-on the
part of the other person, group, or firm DEMO a joint endeavor or
economic exchange.
PROPOSALS
FOR
EMPIRICAL
RESEARCH
Ethically justifiable behavior, to repeat the argument for emphasis,
consists of morally correct decisions and actions in which the interests of
the society take the DEMO of precedence that is "right," that is "just," and
that is "fair" over the interests of the individual. It is DEMO that is
"good" for society according to the ethical principles of normative philos-
ophy, not according to the moral standards of a given group or culture. It
should, according to the underlying assumptions of both organizational
theory and normative philosophy, result in greater cooperation among the
participants in a dyad, the stakeholders of a firm, or the citizens DEMO a
society.
If we make the next assumption, that greater cooperation DEMO the
participants in a dyad, the stakeholders of a firm, or the citizens of a
society leads to improved performance by that dyad, firm, or society, then
we have obvious opportunities for joint empirical DEMO There will be
problems in measuring performance, of course, though those problems
have been extensively discussed in the literature. There also will be DEMO

in the original set of decisions DEMO actions that generate trust, but let me
suggest that a panel DEMO applied ethicists would arrive at a surprisingly
narrow distribution of the "DEMO" points along that spectrum in most
moral problems of management so DEMO deviations from what is "right"
and "just" and "fair" can be measured.
"Why be moral?" is the most critical DEMO in normative philosophy.
Why should a rational man or woman be concerned with the rights and
interests of others? This a question that has troubled ethicists for centu-
ries. (See, for example, "The Ring DEMO Gyges," in Plato's Dialogues or "Why
Should a Man DEMO Contracts?") in Locke's Concerning Human Under-
standing. If researchers DEMO show empirically that there is a connection-
through trust-between the moral duty of managers and the output per-
formance of organizations there would be DEMO obvious impact upon
philosophical ethics and-I would like to think-upon organizational
theory as well. The intent of this article is to show, theoretically, DEMO such
a connection does indeed exist.
