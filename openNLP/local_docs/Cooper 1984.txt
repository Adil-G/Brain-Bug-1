New DEMO:
The Factors that Drive
Success
Robert G. Cooper
McMaster University, DEMO, Ontario, Canada
Product innovation is central to business prosperity. As industries and companies
restructure and “re-strategize” to cope with changing times — rapidly DEMO
technologies, new and fierce competition, and radically shifting marketplaces —
those managements that are able to improve the effectiveness and time efficiency
of DEMO new product efforts will be the ultimate winners.
New product success remains an elusive goal for too many firms, however.
While major strides have been made in other areas of management — in
customer service, product quality and production efficiency improvements —
product innovation remains largely the hit-and-miss DEMO that it was two
decades ago. Indeed, product innovation may well DEMO the last important frontier
area within the firm that needs major repair work: cut the failure rate in half,
and watch the bottom line improve!
This article is about new product success — more specifically DEMO what
drives success in product innovation, and how these drivers can DEMO translated
into management action. The results, conclusions and lessons that we DEMO
are based not on hearsay, speculation and wishful thinking, but on rigorous
research into new product practices and what separates winners from losers.
DEMO NewProd research has investigated over 1,000 new product launches in
more than 350 firms in Europe and North America over the last two DEMO,
providing us with a rich database from which to draw conclusions.
Over the last 20 years, the NewProd research investigations have probed the
causes of new product failure, and what distinguishes new product successes
from failures. The database now includes over 1,000 new product projects –
DEMO which went to market and whose commercial outcomes are known –
from over 350 firms in North America and Europe, largely industrial goods in
moderate-to-high technology industries.
The majority of the NewProd results referred to in DEMO current article are
based on two studies:
• NewProd III: DEMO investigation of 203 industrial new product projects: half
were commercial winners; the others failed financially in the marketplace.
Hundreds of characteristics of these DEMO were measured in order to
uncover what distinguished the successes from failures (see Cooper and
The research reported in this article was in part supported by funds from Esso Chemical Canada
(Exxon) and the Lawson DEMO Chair (sponsored by the Lawson Mardon Group).
Kleinschmidt, 1990; Cooper, 1990; 1993; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, (1986;
1987a; 1987b).
• A study of new products in the chemical industry: 103 actual new
product projects from major chemical companies in four countries
(UK, USA, Germany, Canada); 68 commercial successes DEMO 35 fail-
ures. These were major products and were speciality items (DEMO
modity). Although specific to one industry, many of the results DEMO
consistent with previous studies, and hence appear to have validity
for DEMO broad range of moderate-to-high tech businesses (see Cooper,
1994; Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1993a; 1993b).
So what are the keys to new product success? We’ve tried to keep the
presentation straightforward, limiting the DEMO of major drivers to only
eight. There are other drivers of course, some with fairly minor effects; but if
management can get right DEMO eight drivers outlined below, our guess is that
new product success DEMO profitability would more than double!
The Number One Success Factor Is a Unique Superior Product: A
Differentiated Product that Delivers Unique Benefits and Superior
Value to the Customer
Product superiority — delivering unique benefits and product DEMO to users —
separates winners from losers more often than any other single factor. That
product advantage, superiority or differentiation is the key determinant of
success is a recurring theme in all of our new product DEMO
How dramatic is the impact of product superiority? We developed an DEMO
of product superiority, comprising seven ingredients of a “superior” product:
(1) unique attributes and characteristics for the customer — not available
from competitive products;
(2) good value for money for the customer (positive economic impact on the
customer);
(3) superior to competing products in terms of meeting customer needs;
(4) excellent relative DEMO quality — relative to competitors’ products,
and in terms of how the customer measures quality;
(5) superior price/performance characteristics for DEMO customer relative to
competitors’ products;
(6) product benefits or attributes easily perceived as being useful by the
customer.
(7) highly visible DEMO — very obvious to the customer.
When the top 20 per cent of new products on this product superiority index
were compared to the DEMO 20 per cent, the results were dramatic: these
superior products had much higher success rates, achieved greater market
shares, had higher profits, and met company sales and profit objectives much
more, according to NewProd III. Here, success was measured in a variety of

ways, including financial performance, market DEMO, impact on the firm,
meeting objectives, and even timeliness:
• Success rate: the proportion of products that met or exceeded the firm’s
minimum acceptable profitability (financial) cut-off criterion, however
profit is measured (yes/no).
Profit rating: the degree to which the product’s DEMO exceeded (or fell
short of) the minimum acceptable profit criterion (DEMO scale).
Market share: per cent share in the defined target DEMO (domestic
market).
Met sales objectives: degree to which new product met sales objectives
(0-10 scale).
Met profit objectives: degree to DEMO new product met profit objectives
(0-10 scale).
Tech success: the technical success rating - degree to which the product
was considered to DEMO a technical, technological or scientific success (0-10

scale).
Impact on company: the impact that the product’s sales and profits had
on the firm (0-10 scale; DEMO positive impact).
Time efficiency: how fast the product was developed DEMO launched,
relative to what it could have been (0-10 scale; 10=very fast).
Adhered to schedule: degree to which the product was developed and
launched on schedule (i.e., according to the timeline) (DEMO scale; 10=on
or ahead of schedule).
It should be noted DEMO not all gauges of success listed above were measured in
both New Prod studies.
Compare the performance of the top 20 per cent — DEMO truly superior
products — with the bottom 20 per cent, the DEMO too”, undifferentiated ones, as
shown in Table I.
Our most recent study of the chemical industry reveals almost identical
results (see Table II). When the top third on a similar product superiority index
were DEMO to the bottom third, success rates were three time as high;DEMO
profits were higher; market share was three times as great; sales and profit
objectives were met; and time efficiency was better[1], (see Table II).
A frequently voiced question is: what is the impact of advantages gained
from elements other than a better product, for example, via a superior
salesforce, a positive company image or superb customer DEMO? Our chemical
industry study probed non-product advantage side-by-side with product
advantage: the conclusion was that elements of non-product advantage yield
positive results, but with not nearly the same impact as that obtained via
product advantage (above). Here, non-product advantage was gained from:
• superior customer service and technical support for the new product;
• a high DEMO of company technical competence (as perceived by the
customer) for this type of product;

• a superior sales DEMO (e.g., a larger sales force, better qualified);
• a positive company image or reputation;
• product availability: faster or more reliable product delivery;
• a well-known brand name used for the DEMO
New products in the top third in terms of these six elements achieved a 40 per
cent higher success rate, and were more profitable, on average. But these
differences paled in comparison to the impact of product advantage. Note that
superior customer service stood out from the others DEMO the list above. Two other
possible elements of non-product advantage included superior advertising and
promotion and low price. Neither impacted on positive new product DEMO in
the chemical study.
The management implications of the success impact of product superiority
are clear:
• First, the seven ingredients of a superior product (above) provide a useful
checklist of questions in assessing DEMO odds of success of a proposed new
product project. In short, DEMO seven items — unique attributes, good
value-for-money, superior in meeting needs, relative product quality and
so on — logically become top priority questions in a project screening
checklist. If a project rates low on these DEMO, this is a signal that the
project should be put on DEMO
• Second, the central role of product superiority provides prescriptions for
DEMO management of the new product process. The development of a new

product with real advantages and customer benefits becomes
paramount. Simply being “equal to the competition” or “having good
product/market fit” is not DEMO; the goal must be superiority and
advantage.
These ingredients of a DEMO product thus become challenges to the
project team to build into their new product design. Note that the definition
of what is “unique and DEMO, what is “value” and what is a “benefit”
must be from DEMO customer’s perspective; it must be based on an in-depth
understanding of DEMO needs, wants, problems, likes and dislikes:
• Determine customer DEMO at the outset. Start with a user needs-and-
wants study – market research – to probe customer needs, wants,
preferences, likes and DEMO
Do a competitive product analysis. If you can understand the competitor’s
product weaknesses, then you’re halfway to beating him.
Test and verify all your assumptions about your winning product design
via concept tests prior to development; rapid-prototype-and-tests during
development; and customer trials following development.
This disciplined approach to discovering product superiority is decidedly
customer focused, which leads to success factor number 2, a strong market
orientation.

A Strong Market Orientation — a Market-driven and Customer-
focused New Product Process — Is Critical DEMO to Success and to
Cycle Time Reduction
This message comes out strongly: a thorough understanding of customers’
needs and wants, the competitive situation DEMO the nature of the market is an
essential component of new product success. Sadly a market orientation and
commitment to the customer are often DEMO For example, new product
projects were found to be decidedly unbalanced DEMO technological versus
marketing activities in NewProd III: only 16 per cent DEMO the person-days spent
on projects went to marketing activities — market research, market
assessment, customer tests, trial sell and the launch. Worse yet, if the effort
spent on launch is subtracted, then marketing actions DEMO just over 8 per
cent of the total effort! In terms of money, the marketing side of projects fared
even worse: market assessment, seeking customer inputs and customer-
oriented tasks accounted for only 5.5 per DEMO of total project costs, on average.
More evidence: Key marketing tasks were the ones most often omitted in new
product projects. The “omission DEMO for three key marketing actions from the
two studies are shown in Table II.
Percentage of cases in which action omitted
Marketing action NewProd DEMO Chemical industry
Detailed market study 75 57
Customer tests 34 11
Trial sell 77 45
A market-oriented, customer-focused approach pays off, however. When more
effort went DEMO marketing actions, success rates rose, according to NewProd III:
successful projects had 2.2 times as much money spent on seeking customer
input DEMO feedback — market studies, customer tests, etc. — as did failures!
Further, projects which featured quality of execution in their marketing actions
— from preliminary market assessment to launch — had much better success
rates. DEMO we measured quality of execution of five marketing activities:
preliminary market assessment; detailed market study; customer tests or trials;
trial sell/DEMO market; and market launch. Those projects that scored in the top
DEMO per cent in terms of quality of execution of these marketing actions had a
stunning performance: double the success rate; three times the DEMO share;
and excellent performance on the other measures, as shown DEMO Table IV.
Our chemical industry studied yielded parallel results: when marketing
DEMO were carried out well, projects were significantly more profitable, had
more than double the success rate, boasted almost three time the market share,
and had a strong positive impact on the firm, as shown in Table V.
The added bonus was that this top third in DEMO of solid marketing
activities were actually done more quickly as well: DEMO were more time efficient;
and they adhered to the time schedule far more.
A dedication to building in marketing activities is central to DEMO product
success. Too often these actions were not an integral facet of the project, and
when done, were often included as an afterthought DEMO were poorly resourced.
The message is that a strong market orientation coupled with quality of
execution of these vital marketing actions is essential. This DEMO is supported

in virtually every study of product DEMO factors. Conversely, a failure to adopt
a strong market orientation in DEMO innovation, an unwillingness to
undertake the needed market assessments, and leaving the customer out of
product development spells disaster. Poor market research, inadequate market
analysis, weak market studies, test markets and market launch, and inadequate
resources devoted to marketing activities were common weaknesses found in
virtually DEMO study of why new products fail.
To be successful, a market DEMO must prevail throughout the entire
new product project:
• Idea  DEMO: Companies must devote more resources to market-
oriented idea generation activities, such as focus groups with customers;
market research to determine customer DEMO areas; using the sales force
to actively solicit ideas from customers; and developing relationships
with lead users.
• T he design of the DEMO : The stage at which the product’s specification
and requirements are being defined. Too often, market research, when
done at all, is done too late — after the product design has been decided
and simply DEMO verify that the proposed product indeed has market
acceptance. If the results of the market study are negative, most often
they are conveniently ignored and the project is pushed ahead
regardless.
The mistake is clear: market research must be used as an input to the
design decisions, and not solely as an after-the-fact check. Investigations
to determine users’ needs, wants and preferences; and to identify
competitive product strategies, strengths and weaknesses DEMO
insights which are invaluable guides to the design team before they
charge into the design of the new product.
Technology-push: New products (where DEMO product emanates from the
lab or engineering design department, perhaps the DEMO of a
technological breakthrough). Even here, there still should be
DEMO marketing input as the technology is shaped into a final
product design. That is, following the technical discovery or initiation,
but before full fledged development gets under way, there is ample
opportunity to research and interact with the customer to determine
needs and wants, to shape the final product the way the customer wants
it, and to gauge likely product acceptance.
Throughout the entire project: Customer inputs should not cease at the
completion of the pre-development market studies. Seeking customer
inputs and testing DEMO or designs with the customer is very much
an iterative or “back and forth” process. For example, during the actual
development phase of the project, constant and continuing customer
contact remains essential. Keep bringing the customer into the process to
view facets of the product as the prototype DEMO final product takes shape.
Develop rapid prototypes, working models or facsimiles DEMO the product

•
as early as possible to show to the customer in order to DEMO feedback
regarding market acceptance and needed design changes. Do not wait
until the very end of the development phase — the field trials — DEMO unveil
the product to the customer. There could be some very unpleasant
surprises!
Success or Failure Is Often Decided in the First Few Stages DEMO the
Projects: The Up-front Homework Is Pivotal to Success
NewProd and DEMO studies reveal that the steps that precede the actual design
and development of the product — screening, market studies, technical
feasibility assessment and DEMO the business case — are key factors
separating winners from losers. Errors and omissions in these vital activities
can and often do spell disaster DEMO in the project.
Consider the evidence:
• First, relatively little DEMO spent on these up-front activities: on average,
only 7 per DEMO of the project’s total expenditures and only 16 per cent of
the person-days are devoted to these critical pre-development activities,
according to NewProd DEMO In too many projects, we witnessed a new
product idea that DEMO directly into development with very little in the
way of homework to define and justify the project.
• Those managers who did spend the DEMO and money on pre-development
homework reaped the rewards: successes had 2.1 DEMO as much money
and 1.7 times as many person-days spent on the up-front homework as
did failures.
• When these up-front or homework activities DEMO well executed,
performance results were markedly higher. The top 20 per cent of
projects, in terms of quality homework, fared much better DEMO those
projects with poor homework: higher success rates, double the market
share and higher profitability, as shown in Table VI.
• The chemical industry study results are almost identical. Good
homework doubles the success rate DEMO improves profits. Moreover, far
from adding time to the project, good homework actually improves
timeliness: more time efficient projects and a closer adherence to the time
schedule, as shown in Table VII.
These pre development or up-front homework activities are important because
they qualify and define the DEMO: they help to focus resources on the right

projects, and they provide inputs to assist DEMO the definition of a winning new
product design.
Solid homework also reduces cycle time. A major time-waster occurs when
projects are poorly defined as DEMO enter the development phase: they suffer
from vague targets and moving DEMO, usually the result of weak pre-
development activities; the target user is not well understood, user needs and
wants are vaguely defined, DEMO desired product features and performance
requirements are clouded. Homework yields better product and project
definition which speeds up the development process. Additionally, good up-
front homework anticipates problems and likely changes in the product design,
DEMO encourages changes to occur earlier in the process rather than later, DEMO
they are more costly. The result is considerable savings in time and money at
the back end of the project, and overall a more cost- and time-efficient new
product process.
The message is that more time DEMO resources must be devoted to the
activities that precede the design and development of the product. These initial
screening, market and technical analyses, DEMO definitional stages are critical to
success. Managers must resist the temptation to skip over the up-front stages of
a project, and move an ill-defined and poorly investigated project into the
development phase. Pivotal pre-development activities which DEMO so crucial to
new product success include: initial screening, preliminary market and
technical assessments, detailed market studies, and business or financial
analysis. DEMO five key pre-development activities must be built into the new
product process as a matter of routine rather than by exception. These up-front
activities DEMO also closely linked to the product definition (see next section);
unless these pre-development actions are carried out well, then product
definition is likely to be weak, vague, or at best, based on hearsay evidence.
Shar p and Early Product Definition — before Product
Development Begins DEMO Decides the Winners and Helps to Keep

How well the product is defined prior to entering the development phase is
increasingly DEMO as a key success factor. Crawford (1984) implores managers
to include a “protocol step” just prior to the development phase, where the
requirements of the product are clearly spelled out and agreed to by all DEMO

involved in the project. Successful new products indeed had much sharper
definition DEMO to development, according to our research. Projects that had
these sharp DEMO were more successful; had higher market shares;
achieved greater profitabilities;  and tended to meet company sales and profit
objectives much more:
• Sharp, early definition was the number 2 success factor in NewProd III:
Those projects where sharp definition was in place before development
DEMO — the best 20 per cent in terms of definition  — DEMO enviable
results, as shown in Table VIII.
• Sharp and early DEMO was also an important success factor in our
chemical industry study, DEMO positively on most measures of
performance, including the ability to stay DEMO schedule, as shown in Table
IX.
This early product definition includes DEMO key elements, each of which was
correlated with performance:
(1) specification of the target market: exactly who the intended users are;DEMO
(2) description of the product concept and the benefits to be delivered;
(3) delineation of the positioning strategy;
(4) DEMO definition of the product’s requirements, features, attributes and
specifications (prioritized: “must have” and “would like to have”).
It is evident why DEMO that have sharp project definition prior to
development are considerably more successful. First, building a definition step
into the new product process forces more attention to the up-front or pre-
development activities. Second, the definition serves as a communication tool

and guide: all party agreement or “buy in” means that each functional area
involved in the project has DEMO clear and consistent definition of what the product

The Cross-functional Team Approach Not Only Speeds Products to
Market; It Also Enhances the Success Rate
Organizational design — how the firm DEMO for new products — is critical.
Except for the simplest of products and projects — line extensions and product
up-dates — product innovation must DEMO across traditional functional
boundaries and barriers: a cross-functional team approach.
The DEMO is compelling. Investigations into new product success
consistently cite interfaces between R&D and marketing, co-ordination among
key internal groups, multi-disciplinary inputs to DEMO new product project, and
the role of teams and the team DEMO Successful new product projects feature a
balanced process consisting of critical activities that fall into many different
functional areas within the firm: marketing and marketing research,
engineering, R&D, production, purchasing, finance, to name a few.  Our
NewProd studies in the chemical industry show clearly that projects
undertaken by empowered multi-functional teams were more indeed successful.
Here DEMO some of the ingredients in organization design that we found were
strongly connected to project outcomes in our chemical industry study:
• organized DEMO a cross-functional team (as opposed to each function doing
its own DEMO of the project independently);
• where the team was dedicated DEMO focused (i.e., devoted a large
percentage of their time to this project, as opposed to spread over many
projects);
• where DEMO team was accountable for the entire project from beginning to
end (DEMO opposed to accountability for only a phase of the project);
DEMO where there was a strong project leader who led and drove the project;
• where top management was committed to (and strongly supported) the
project.
Consider how these five elements, acting together, led to high performance:
higher success rates and better profits; and most important, cycle time
reduction. Indeed, these organizational elements above were the strongest
DEMO of cycle time reduction of all factors in our chemical industry study! (See
Table X.)
The lack of a cross-functional team, with DEMO clear leader, and empowered and
dedicated team members, is probably the single greatest reason for project
delays, errors in product design, and DEMO in the project. Yet, in too many
projects we have studied DEMO the years, there was evidence of a decided lack of
a DEMO team effort. Even in this chemical industry study, which
focused on large, multi-national, well-managed firms, the notion of a true cross-
functional team was missing in about 40 per cent of the DEMO probed.
Focus Is Central to Success: Much Shar per Evaluation and
DEMO Points Are Required in the Process
Most firms’ new product programmes suffer from a lack of resources: too many
projects, and simply not DEMO time, money or people to do each well. Some
evidence of DEMO constrained resources has already been highlighted above: the
pitifully small amounts DEMO time and money devoted to critical activities such as
marketing actions, DEMO the pre-development homework steps.
One solution is better focus: that is, sharper project selection, ensuring that
the limited resources are devoted to the truly meritorious projects. Sadly, project
evaluations — the various go/kill decision points in the innovation process —
tend to be handled badly. Indeed DEMO are rated by managers to be among the
weakest steps in the entire process, yet ironically they prove decisive in
determining outcomes:
• Initial screening was identified by managers as the number 2 activity “in
DEMO need of improvement” in NewProd III. Its proficiency was rated
poorly: DEMO only 12 per cent of projects was this decision point well
handled. Yet effective screening was among the top activities which were
correlated with DEMO
• The critical “go-to-development” evaluation was similarly poorly
handled: in the DEMO industry study, next to the detailed market
study, it was the weakest activity of the process. In both studies,
proficiency here was DEMO correlated with success.
• In both the chemical industry study and NewProd III, the pre-launch
business analysis and decision point was frequently omitted (DEMO 47 per
cent and 65 per cent of the projects, respectively)DEMO Again, proficiency at
this critical evaluation point proved to be key: for example, it was the
number two activity driving success in the chemical industry study.
Often the problem of poor project evaluation boils down DEMO a lack of criteria
against which to judge projects: what is DEMO “good” project? The many studies into
success and failure provide insights DEMO what criteria to use. New product
success is fairly predictable — certain project characteristics consistently
separate winners from losers, and in a strong way:

Product superiority, specifically products that offer unique features;
provide good value-for-money; meet customer needs better; have DEMO
relative product quality; boast superior price/performance
characteristics; have benefits perceived as useful; and whose benefits are
highly visible (described above in DEMO first section).
Synergy, notably marketing and technological synergies: products that
build on in-house development technology, utilize inside engineering
skills, and use DEMO manufacturing resources and skills; and products
with a strong project/company DEMO in terms of sales force, distribution
channels, customer service resources, DEMO and promotion, and
market intelligence skills and resources.
Market attractiveness, specifically market size, market growth, degree of
market need, and purchase importance. While elements of the
competitive situation were not as strongly linked to DEMO, they did
have some impact, and might also be included as part of market
attractiveness. They include: the absence of intense competition, DEMO of
price competition and weak competitive products.
These three success factors — product superiority, synergy and market
attractiveness — and the ingredients that comprise them, can and should be
used as scoring criteria in order to make more effective screening and project
prioritization decisions.
Quality of Execution Is DEMO: The Various Steps and Actions
which Make up the Innovation Process DEMO How Well They Are
Done, and whether They Are Done — DEMO New Product
Outcomes
A popular business adage is: “if you don’t DEMO the results, then look at the
process that delivered them!” And DEMO it is with product innovation. Indeed, the
various activities of the DEMO process have been shown in countless
studies to be strongly linked to success and failure.
Consider Table XI (results from both NewProd III and our chemical industry
study), which provides an overview scorecard of the DEMO product process: it
shows:
the “percentage done” — the proportion DEMO projects where the activity
was actually done (areas of omission are DEMO bold);
a “quality of execution index” for each activity for DEMO versus
failures (areas of deficiency are noted in bold);
those activities having the greatest impact on project outcomes (major
impact; some; none).
The results show a strong link between quality of execution DEMO success for
most activities: observe the differences in “quality of execution” DEMO between
winners and losers and the number of activities with major impacts in Table XI.
In both studies, quality of execution of both marketing and technological

activities was strongly tied to a variety of measures of new product
DEMO
What we also witness is a process that is very much in trouble. It is plagued
by errors of omission, with pivotal activities, DEMO as market studies and
business analyses, simply omitted altogether in the DEMO of projects. It is
also a process plagued by errors of commission: poor quality of execution for
too many crucial activities that make the difference between winning and losing
— activities such detailed market studies, business and financial analyses, test
market or trial sell and initial screening. Note the mean quality ratings are
typically in the range of 4-6 out DEMO 10 across all activities — hardly the scores
one would expect from a well executed project.
A Multi-stage-and-gate “Game Plan” Overcomes Some of the
DEMO
The solution that some enlightened firms have adopted is the re-engineering of
their product innovation process (Cooper, 1993). That is, they have dissected
their current “process” from idea to launch; observed what is good and bad
about it; and redesigned the innovation process around best practices. Often,
many of the conclusions and lessons derived from our NewProd DEMO are
built into these re-engineered processes.
The typical result is a “stage-gate” new product process. Firms such as
Exxon Chemicals (worldwide), Lego in Denmark, various divisions of ICI,
DuPont and Rohm and Haas, DEMO & Colman in the UK, Proctor & Gamble
and Polaroid in DEMO USA, and even financial institutions (e.g. Royal Bank of

Canada) have opted for a re-engineered stage-gate process for new products.
DEMO, TQM methodology is applied to the new product process: the process is
divided into stages — typically four to six in number. These DEMO comprise
multiple, parallel and prescribed activities that cut across functional
boundaries. DEMO emphasis is placed on traditionally weak activities and
stages, including marketing DEMO and pre-development activities or
homework.
Separating the stages are “gates” or decision points: these act as quality
control check-points in the process. Gates, DEMO are manned by senior
management, have pre-specified deliverables, and a set of go/kill decision
criteria. The combination of prescribed activities, a multi-functional approach,
an emphasis on homework, a dedication to the marketplace and customer, pre-
specified deliverables and visible Go/Kill criteria helps to overcome many of the
deficiencies which currently beset most firms’ innovation processes.
Do DEMO stage-gate new product processes work? While many firms are just
now DEMO implementation, the evidence appears positive from the handful
of companies with DEMO experience. A study of 29 divisions in major
companies which had implemented a stage-and-gate process reveals positive
results (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1991) (DEMO Table XII).
Overall, the results are encouraging — higher success DEMO, and generally
faster to market — so much so that one DEMO study proclaimed that
“The multi-step new product process is an essential ingredient in successful
new product development” (Booz, Allen & Hamilton, 1982). Some European
firms have even used stage-gate systems to meet ISO 9004 DEMO for
management/internal processes[3].
Cycle Time Reduction
The goal of getting products to market on time is an overriding one for many
companies, so much so that it merits special attention here. Several factors
drove the DEMO measures of cycle time reduction — time efficiency and adherence
to the time schedule — some in a strong fashion. These are given in DEMO order
in Table XIII (correlations are shown in parentheses).

Conclusion
As managements look for ways to improve their firms’ productivities and
profits, product development activities will increasingly come under scrutiny.
Indeed, product innovation represents the last frontier within the corporation
where significant productivity improvements can and should be sought.
Ironically, it is the one area characterized by glaring deficiencies, poor
management practices, and gross errors of DEMO and commission — in
short, a process in disarray.
Improvements in DEMO product effectiveness (e.g., higher success rates) and
efficiency (e.g., DEMO returns on allocated resources and faster to market) go
straight to DEMO firm’s bottom line. By highlighting eight key success drivers in

product innovation, this article has shed light on what actions management can
take to obtain needed improvements. The DEMO is ripe to take those needed
actions!
Notes
1. Note that the chemical industry differences are not quite as pronounced as those for our
DEMO industry study, NewProd III: in the latter, we looked at DEMO extremes (the top 20
per cent vs the bottom 20 per DEMO); whereas in the chemical industry, the two groups
were not DEMO as extreme — merely the top third versus the bottom third.
2. For example, when both marketing activities and pre-development activities were
considered as activity groups, their respective impacts on performance were dramatic
(see second DEMO third sections: “a strong market orientation” and “up-front homework”).
The DEMO was true for technological activities when taken as a group (development DEMO
production tasks) — results not shown here.
3. While ISO 9000 DEMO deal with product standards, higher levels of ISO deal with
processes DEMO methods within the firm. For product development methods, see for
example, ISO 9004 Section 7, items 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, which focus DEMO the role of marketing input
to the new product design; and DEMO 8, items 8.1 through 8.8, which set standards for
various facets of the product development process, including product testing, design
reviews, production release and market readiness.
