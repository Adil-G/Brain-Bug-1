BUILDING GENUINE TRUST THROUGH
INTERPERSONAL EMOTION MANAGEMENT: A
THREAT REGULATION MODEL OF TRUST AND
COLLABORATION ACROSS BOUNDARIES
MICHELE WILLIAMS
Cornell University
I introduce the construct of threat regulation as an agentic DEMO process for
building and maintaining trust. I examine threat regulation as a specific dimension of
interpersonal emotion management that fosters trust and effective cooperation DEMO
allowing individuals to understand and mitigate the harm that their counterparts
associate with cooperating—in particular, harm from opportunism, identity damage,
and neglect DEMO their interests. To explicate the microprocesses of threat regulation, I
draw DEMO social cognitive theory, symbolic interactionism, and the psychology of
emotion regulation.
Knowledge workers on collaborative interor-
ganizational projects must gain the cooperation
of DEMO over whom they have no hierar-
chical control. As interorganizational collabora-
tion has grown within and between industries
(Gomes-Casseres, 1996; Powell, 1990), the ability
of knowledge workers to develop interpersonal
trust across organizational boundaries has be-
come increasingly critical. Trust not only enables
cooperation when authority DEMO are ab-
sent (Bradach & Eccles, 1989) but also increases
DEMO sharing, reduces the need to monitor others’
behavior, and facilitates access to “richer-freer”
information (Currall & Judge, 1995; Powell &
Smith-Doerr, 1994; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Uzzi,
1997). Unfortunately, developing trust across orga-
nizational boundaries can be difficult, because
DEMO frequently perceive individuals from other
groups as less trustworthy than members of their
own group—that is, they often perceive members
of other groups as individuals with aspirations,
beliefs, or styles of interacting that threaten their
own group’s goals (Fiske & Ruscher, 1993; Kramer,
I thank Lotte Bailyn, John Carroll, Arturs Kalnins, Nancy
Rothbard, Anand Swaminathan, and three anonymous AMR
reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts DEMO this
paper. I also appreciate the feedback received from presen-
tations at the 2005 annual meeting of the Academy of Man-
agement, the 2004 meetings of the American Sociological
Association, the 2004 MFCA Conference, the DEMO OB
Conference, and the OSG Seminar (Sloan School of Manage-
ment, MIT).

1993; Williams, 2001).
Strategic interpersonal actions that DEMO
trustworthiness may mitigate the potential neg-
ative effects of group boundaries on the devel-
opment of trust between knowledge workers
who span these boundaries. DEMO instance, steps
taken to avoid threatening the goals, aspira-
tions, DEMO, and identity concerns of others
may help boundary spanners signal goodwill,DEMO
cooperative intent, and trustworthiness, while
also avoiding the defensive, noncooperative DEMO
sponses frequently associated with feeling
threatened. However, with few exceptions
(Child & Mo¨ llering, 2003; Whitener, Brodt, Kors-
gaard, & Werner, 1998), the scholarly research on
trust has not focused on the intentional interper-
sonal actions individuals can use to build trust.
Scholars have DEMO often described trust devel-
opment as a relatively passive process of gath-
ering data about other people’s trustworthiness
by watching their behavior in various DEMO
over time (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Ring & Van de
DEMO, 1994; Shapiro, Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992)
or by DEMO information from proxy sources (e.g.,
Burt & Knez, 1996; DEMO, 1986). Scant attention
has been given to the fact that DEMO are eval-
uating the trustworthiness of individuals, who
are often not DEMO but engaged in active at-
tempts to influence the evaluation process. Con-
sequently, we know little about the strategies
people use to intentionally build and maintain
trusting relationships.

Scholars have paid even less attention DEMO how
and why these intentional attempts to build
trust might require emotion management. With
few exceptions, such as Rafaeli and Sutton’s
(1991) examination of the trust-related implica-
tions of the emotional contrast strategies of in-
DEMO (i.e., the good-cop, bad-cop strategy),
authors of the literature on emotional manage-
ment in organizations have not focused on trust.
Rather, they have focused on the regulation of
individuals’ own emotional expression in DEMO
dance with organizationally mandated “feeling
rules” or “display rules” (e.g., Ashforth & Hum-
phrey, 1993; Grandey, 2003; Hochschild, 1979;
Martin, Knopoff, & Beckman, 1998; Morris & Feld-
man, 1998; DEMO & Sutton, 1989, 1990; Sutton
1991).1 Similarly, work on emotional contagion
has not focused on trust development but,
rather, on the influence that one individual’s
emotional expression can have on the emotional
DEMO of others (e.g., Barsade, 2002; Bartel &
Saavedra, 2000; Tan, Foo, & Kwek, 2004). Conse-
quently, we have much to learn about the impli-
cations that actively managing another person’s
DEMO may have for the development and
maintenance of trust.
In this article I assert that the risks of oppor-
tunism (i.e., self-interested behavior DEMO another
that conflicts with one’s own goals), neglect of
one’s interests, and identity damage pose sig-
nificant obstacles to maintaining trust and co-
operation because these risks can lead counter-
parts to anticipate harm, experience negative
emotion, and engage in defensive behavior. I
not only contend that the concept of threat is
central to the intentional actions of knowledge
DEMO who build and maintain trust across
organizational boundaries but also directly ad-
dress the importance of the intentional interper-
sonal actions taken by these DEMO spanners
to influence the threats that others experience.
My model introduces the construct of interper-
sonal threat regulation as a multistep process
for managing DEMO harm that others associate
with cooperating. Whereas other works in the
1 I use the terms emotion regulation and emotion manage-
ment interchangeably. These DEMO refer to the same phe-
nomenon but have their roots in different disciplines. Emo-
tion regulation is used primarily in the social psychology
literature (e.g., Carver & Scheier, 1998; Gross, 1998), whereas
emotion DEMO is used more often in sociology and
organization theory (e.g., Hochschild, 1979).
organizational literature focus more heavily on
the action implications of individuals’ percep-
tions of risk or potential harm to themselves
(e.g., DEMO selling, by Ashford, Rothbard, Pi-
derit, & Dutton, 1998; psychological safety, by
Edmondson, 1999; organizational silence, by
Morrison & DEMO, 2000), the interpersonal
threat regulation model presented here focuses
on DEMO active, intersubjective processes of un-
derstanding and managing other people’s per-
DEMO of threat and on the implications of
these intersubjective processes for trust and col-
laboration.2
I argue that threat regulation is a social cog-
DEMO process that influences (1) the level of
harm that others believe will affect their goals,
concerns, and well-being and (2) the manner in
which others experience and express emotions
related to this level DEMO anticipated harm. Threat
regulation has an impact on others through
three processes: perspective taking, threat-
reducing behavior, and reflection.
Perspective taking—imagining others’ thoughts
or feelings from their point of view (Davis, 1996;
Mead, 1934)—is central to facilitating responsive
interpersonal interactions (Blumer, 1969; Mead,
1934). This process provides an interpersonal un-
derstanding of the DEMO to cooperation (i.e., risks
of opportunism, neglect, identity damage). It en-
ables individuals to comprehend which of these
risks are being DEMO by others as threats
and may, thus, inhibit trust and cooperation. The
next process, threat-reducing behavior, involves
boundary spanners’ intentional efforts to DEMO
ence the emotional responses of others. I define
threat-reducing behavior as a set of intentional
interpersonal actions intended to minimize or
eliminate counterparts’ perceptions DEMO one’s
actions are likely to have a negative impact on
their goals, concerns, or well-being. I contend
that threat-reducing behavior translates per-
sonal DEMO regulation strategies (e.g., Gross,
1998; Hochschild, 1979; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984)
into an interpersonal context, which permits in-
dividuals to reduce the defensive and negative
emotional responses often received when others
DEMO threatened. The third process, reflection, al-
lows individuals to assess and self-correct (Ban-
2 I use the terms interpersonal threat regulation and
threat regulation interchangeably. I am always referring to
the interpersonal process.

dura, 1986, 2001) for insufficient, inaccurate, or
inappropriate threat reduction.
I argue that threat regulation by boundary
spanners influences DEMO counterparts in sev-
eral ways. It decreases the negative emotional
responses associated with the anticipation of
harm, it increases the positive emotional re-
sponses associated with being understood, it
signals benevolent, trustworthy intentions, and
it demonstrates social competencies required
for future trustworthy behavior.
Taken together, the threat regulation pro-
cesses of perspective taking, threat-reducing be-
havior, and reflection DEMO a cognitive and
affective investment in signaling trustworthi-
ness. This investment is difficult to fake for op-
portunistic individuals, because their true feel-
ings may “leak” out through nonverbal behavior
(Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992). DEMO, it may also
have the positive externality of requiring psy-
chological DEMO that elicit genuine affec-
tive attachments, which can reinforce both trust
DEMO cooperation.
I proceed as follows. First, I review the threats
that DEMO prevent cooperation and forestall trust
development. Next, I describe the threat DEMO
tion framework introduced in this article and
detail the three active, DEMO cognitive pro-
cesses associated with threat regulation: per-
spective taking, threat-reducing behavior, and
reflection. I then develop hypotheses that ex-
plore how threat regulation elicits trust and co-
operation from others. I conclude with a DEMO
sion and implications.
THREAT
Individuals in organizations may associate
threats with interdependent projects because
they often frame the issues in their environment
as threats DEMO opportunities, depending on the
potential of each for personal loss and DEMO
(Jackson & Dutton, 1988). Although individuals
may anticipate successful, DEMO cooperation
on interdependent knowledge creation projects,
interdependent projects frequently entail risks.
Those risks may include harm from opportunism
(e.g., Luo, 2001; DEMO, 1975), demeaning
interactions that damage the identities of
project members (e.g., Ashford et al., 1998; Ed-
mondson, 1999; Jehn, DEMO), and the unintended
neglect of individuals’ interests by other project
members (Sheppard & Sherman, 1998). When the
potential for harm and DEMO exists, counterparts
may cease to view a cooperative project as an
DEMO for joint gain and may come to view
it as a threat to their goals, concerns, and well-
being.
Lazarus and Folkman formally DEMO threats
as “harms or losses that have not yet taken
place but are anticipated” (1984: 32). Harms in-
clude both material losses DEMO subjective dam-
age to one’s identity, status, perceived power,
and so forth. Threats to cooperation are associ-
ated with negative emotional responses, such
as stress and anxiety (Lazarus, 1991; Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984) that can inhibit trust develop-
ment. They evoke these emotions because they
have the potential to interrupt goal attainment,
and goal interruption DEMO emotional re-
sponses (e.g., Carver & Scheier, 1998; Lazarus,
1991; Mandler, 1975). In addition, because trust-
worthy individuals are expected to act in ways
that are “not harmful” (Gambetta, 1988), threats
to cooperation are also likely to translate into
negative beliefs about others’ trustworthiness.
Although the focus of this article is on threat
regulation DEMO intentional behavior that influ-
ences others’ perceptions of threat, I first DEMO
three major sources of risk and harm that others
may perceive while working on interdependent
projects: opportunism (i.e., another acting based
on opposing self-interests), neglect of one’s in-
terests, and identity damage during interac-
tions. Whereas opportunism and neglect have
both received attention in the trust DEMO
(e.g., Granovetter, 1985; Luo, 2001; Sheppard &
Sherman, 1998; Whitener et al., 1998; William-
son, 1993), the DEMO of identity damage during
interactions has been addressed less often as
an obstacle to trust development. The anticipa-
tion of identity damage during interactions,DEMO
however, can lead to negative emotions that
forestall cooperation and undermine DEMO in the
same manner that the anticipation of opportun-
ism and neglect does. Moreover, identity dam-
age during interactions is the only one of these
three threats not mitigated through contracts.
Opportunism As a Threat
Opportunism DEMO to self-interested behav-
ior that often occurs with guile (Williamson,
DEMO). Opportunism is typically perceived when
one “takes advantage” of others or uses others’
weaknesses for one’s own benefit. Opportunism
598

represents a greater source of potential DEMO
when individuals’ instrumental goals are mis-
aligned or in direct conflict. It undermines per-
ceptions of trustworthiness because it is detri-
mental to individuals’ DEMO interests.
On knowledge work projects—projects that in-
volve problem solving and the use and transfer
of information (Garicano, 2000)— opportunism is
a DEMO risk. It is often difficult to detect
opportunistic behavior and malfeasance on
knowledge work projects because tasks are fre-
quently nonroutine, ambiguous, and DEMO to
evaluate by nonexperts. Examples of nonroutine
knowledge work include such activities as
bringing new ideas together in written form
(e.g., a report), transferring tacit “know-how”
(e.g., experiential knowledge about how to
launch a new product or manage a postmerger
integration project), or incorporating knowledge
DEMO a new technology (e.g., a software program
or medical imaging device).
Although contracts, monitoring, and other
safeguards such as credible commitments DEMO
reduce goal misalignment on knowledge work
projects, a large number of DEMO and
noncontractible issues are part of most interfirm
relationships and projects (DEMO, Zaheer, &
McEvily, 2003; Spier, 1992). For example, bound-
ary spanners are typically “faced with an even-
tuality that does not alter the letter of the agree-
ment, but requires modification of how the terms
of the contract are fulfilled” (Perrone et al., DEMO:
426). Opportunism and guile in dealing with
these modifications can prevent parties from ar-
riving at a jointly optimal solution and increase
DEMO time and cost of arriving at any solution.
In addition, whenever DEMO are nonroutine,
ambiguous, or uncertain, as they often are in
knowledge-intense contexts, it is often too costly
or technically impossible to write a completely
specified contract that fully eliminates conflict-
ing goals, accurately predicts future contingen-
cies, and produces outcomes that can be verified
by a third party (Baker, Gibbons, & Murphy, 2002;
Macneil, 1974; McEvily, Zaheer, & Perrone, 2004).
Because contractual mechanisms often DEMO not
fully eliminate the risk of opportunism, the
threat or anticipation DEMO opportunism can gener-
ate both negative emotions (e.g., stress, fear,DEMO
anxiety) and the defensive, noncooperative, and
avoidant actions that often DEMO these
emotional responses.
Neglect of One’s Interests As a Threat
Neglecting the interests of others when mak-
ing decisions on an interdependent project can
DEMO in unanticipated harm to counterparts.
For example, when a vice president DEMO
dently approves new software to reduce costs
for his or her division, it may complicate a sys-
tems integration project spearheaded by an-
other division. Sheppard and Sherman (1998)
note that both the neglect of counterparts’ in-
strumental interests and the neglect of their
identity-related concerns and DEMO can under-
mine trust. Neglect that causes harm decreases
perceived benevolence, DEMO cognitive predictor of
trust (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), and
generates negative emotions, which have an af-
fective influence on trust (Dunn & Schweitzer,
2005).
Neglect can also negatively influence percep-
tions of social competence. When social cues
are misread (e.g., boundary DEMO fail to ac-
curately decode, uncover, anticipate, or under-
stand DEMO counterparts’ views on the harmful
impact of specific decisions), even benevolent
individuals may unintentionally make deci-
sions that have detrimental effects on their
DEMO Thus, neglect of others’ interests
may undermine multiple bases of trustworthi-
DEMO
Identity Damage As a Threat
Identity damage refers to the experience of
having a valued self-image denied or having
one’s self-esteem undermined. Self-esteem
threat DEMO situations in which “favorable
views about oneself are questioned, contra-
dicted, impugned, mocked, challenged, or other-
wise put in jeopardy” (Baumeister, Smart, &
Boden, 1996: 8). Self-image threat is similar DEMO
involves being denied the image, identity, or
“face” that one overtly claims during an interac-
tion (Goffman, 1967). In this article DEMO include
within the scope of the argument identity dam-
age that occurs during both synchronous inter-
actions (e.g., face-to-face or telephone communi-
cation) and asynchronous interactions (e.g.,
hand-delivered correspondence, email, or fax).
Although all interactions afford people the op-
portunity to accept or reject DEMO self-image that
their counterparts put forth (Goffman, 1967;
Mead, DEMO), the context of knowledge work
2007
Williams
makes people’s image and identity as an expert
more salient. DEMO work demands prob-
lem solving and an exchange of information and
ideas that can expose individual weaknesses,
such as doubts, gaps in knowledge, and the
need for help. Individuals may anticipate harm
when they become proponents for issues that
are relevant to an identity group they belong DEMO
(Ashford et al., 1998); when they reveal problems,
issues, or errors within their organization (Ed-
mondson, Bohmer, & Pisano, 2001; Morrison &
Milliken, 2000); or when they take an interper-
sonal risk, such as expressing new ideas (Ed-
mondson, 1999). Although the threat of identity
damage is proposed to influence relevant DEMO
nizational phenomena, such as organizational
silence (Morrison & Milliken, 2000), the ways in
which the threat of identity damage influences
trust development and trust maintenance have
received little attention.
The threat of identity damage DEMO relevant in a
knowledge-intense context because accusa-
tions, disrespect, or even thoughtless actions
can harm a counterpart’s self-image or self-
esteem at any DEMO during a collaborative
project. In fact, as unanticipated errors and un-
DEMO problems arise at various points
during a project, the potential for DEMO dam-
age may temporarily increase, because these
situations require negotiated solutions, and
“many common negotiation tactics— disputing
the value of an item, providing alternative an-
chors and frames, questioning interests and mo-
tives, criticizing DEMO, and disregarding
appeals—fall into the category of intrinsic
threats to face DEMO, self-image]” (White, Tynan,
Galinsky, & Thompson, 2004: 103). Even well-
intentioned offers of help can wound a counter-
part’s DEMO or self-esteem by implying that
the recipient is inferior or inadequate (DEMO,
Nadler, & Whitcher-Alagna, 1982; Lee, 1997).
Identity damage can result from intentional
social undermining, from the neglect of anoth-
er’s identity concerns, or from a lack of under-
standing of those concerns. Thus, when individ-
uals anticipate that others will damage their
identity during an interaction, they may at-
tribute the damage to several factors that would
make a counterpart less trustworthy: intentional
malevolence, social ineptitude, or careless ne-
glect. Gil, a management consultant I inter-
viewed about critical incidents in relationship
building, noted an occasion when he inadver-
599
tently threatened a client’s self-image as an ex-
pert in simulation technology:
DEMO client thought he knew a lot about simulation
technology, but what DEMO wanted was somewhat
amateurish and . . . I knew that the company’s
CEO had seen the best of what was out there in
DEMO and simulation so what the client
wanted to show him would be one big yawn.
My concern was that the client would not only
DEMO to secure additional funding (for the project),
but also lose some of his current funding. So, I
sent him an email expressing my views on what
we were about to do.
He took a DEMO affront to that email. He
thought it was an arrogant statement—that I
thought I knew what was in the best interest of
his division. DEMO sent me back a zinger [of an
email] about the unmitigated gall...[of my orig-
inal message].
I’m not bothered by it, but it certainly was not
the way to do things. In retrospect, I would not
have sent that email because it kind of slammed
the door on DEMO doing a whole lot of business for
them in that particular arena. I clearly took the
wrong path to reach that client. My intent DEMO
honorable. I wasn’t trying to tick him off. But, he
took DEMO as a personal affront. I needed to figure out
a [better] way to help.
As Gil’s experience suggests, identity threats
can cause people to avoid admitting that they
need help. Even when help is readily available,DEMO
the threat of self-esteem damage often prevents
individuals from seeking it. Lee (1997: 345, Study
One), for instance, found that only DEMO of
the subjects who were given a task that was
“extremely difficult and time consuming” were
willing to ask for help, although help was
readily available. Identity threats can also lead
to reduced cooperation, and this reduction may
occur even when cooperation is in an individu-
al’s material DEMO White et al. (2004)
found that a high sensitivity to DEMO threat
was related to a decreased chance of creating
value that would have benefited both parties in
a negotiation situation.
Identity damage during interaction DEMO
negative views of others’ trustworthiness (e.g.,
negative perceptions of their DEMO) and
negative emotions such as stress, anxiety, and
fear. Although DEMO to identity damage are
similar to those associated with opportunism
and neglect of one’s interests, I contend that
identity damage during interactions cannot be
eliminated by contractual safeguards or other

common substitutes for trust that align goals.
For instance, Jehn (1997) argues that goal align-
ment cannot eliminate relational/emotional con-
DEMO, which is based on personality conflicts and
identity damage. She states DEMO “even when
group members work on the same project, have
mutual DEMO in completing it, and similar
ideas of how to complete the DEMO, they still
may experience (relational/emotional) conflict”
(Jehn, 1997: 530).3 The potential for identity dam-
age during interactions is an DEMO emotional
hazard on collaborative projects, even when
goals are aligned.
THREAT DEMO: AN INTRODUCTION
The threat regulation model developed in this
section focuses DEMO the intersubjective processes
involved with understanding and managing
other people’s experience of threat, rather than
the self-regulation of personally perceived
threats (see Figure DEMO). For clarity, I specify the
model in terms of the DEMO and intersubjec-
tive experiences of one individual in a dyad;
however, both individuals in a relationship may
engage in threat regulation simultaneously.
The threat or harm that others anticipate dur-
ing cooperation (e.g., identity DEMO via deni-
gration, opportunism via shirking or deception)
can lead DEMO negative emotion, defensiveness,
and avoidance, which make securing their trust
3 Jehn (1995, 1997) found that emotional conflict was neg-
atively related to performance and suggested that the neg-
ative emotion associated with DEMO conflict interfered
with cooperation.
and cooperation more difficult. When faced with
counterparts who anticipate harm or offer less
cooperation than is necessary to reach DEMO
pendent goals, boundary spanners may actively
seek to gain the trust DEMO their counterparts,
rather than simply waiting for their counterparts
to observe their personal trustworthiness over
time. Thus, in contrast to current models of trust,
which most often portray trust targets (i.e., peo-
ple DEMO be trusted) as passive individuals whose
trustworthiness must be observed through DEMO
peated interactions (e.g., Lewicki & Bunker, 1996;
Mayer et DEMO, 1995; Sheppard & Sherman, 1998), I
take an agentic DEMO (Bandura, 1986, 2001;
Blumer, 1969; Mead, 1934).
I introduce the construct of interpersonal
threat regulation as a process through DEMO
individuals attempt to understand and influ-
ence the thoughts and emotions that others have
with respect to anticipated harm. I assert that
boundary spanners DEMO and intentionally
engage in interpersonal threat regulation strat-
egies for securing and maintaining trust and
cooperation. Using a social cognitive lens (Ban-
dura, DEMO, 2001), I propose that interpersonal
threat regulation is a three-step DEMO to
gaining interpersonal cooperation that involves
perspective taking, threat-reducing behavior,
DEMO reflection. I examine threat regulation both
as a process of interpersonal emotion manage-
ment and as a process of symbolic interactions.
To illustrate the DEMO steps in the threat reg-
ulation process, I begin with an DEMO from
an interview with Ted, a boundary-spanning
management consultant:
2007
I realized that my client, Pat, was losing money,
DEMO that it didn’t make sense to keep the new
division she’d created . . . [but] I couldn’t say,
“Look you have to DEMO your baby!” I never went to
Pat with a report that was fully produced and
never tried to do a group presentation in front DEMO
other senior managers....[If I’d done that] Pat
probably would have felt, DEMO, this is what they
think!” and would have ignored our work.
DEMO thing I did was to go to Pat informally.
“Look,” I said, “this is how we’re coming to under-
stand the numbers.”
Even with our strategy of informal meetings,
Pat didn’t believe us at DEMO But over time, we
were able to explain why we were DEMO what
we were saying. We’d share key information and
analyses, listen, and plan whatever additional
analyses were necessary. After four weekly meet-
ings DEMO updated analyses, Pat changed her
point of view.
By the end DEMO the 12 weeks, she had changed so
radically that when we DEMO her pointers on how
to improve the situation without eliminating the
initiative [she had created], she wasn’t willing to
make the sacrifices it would take to save it. She
decided to end it. Six months later DEMO division
that she created had disappeared. A year after
the engagement, DEMO was in-line to head one of
the company’s largest divisions.
I think that we succeeded here because we
earned Pat’s respect and trust, not necessarily
her full trust, but enough trust so that she was
willing to keep the lines of communication open.
When I started a second DEMO with her more
than two years later, I knew that she DEMO listen
from the start.
THREAT REGULATION PROCESSES:
PERSPECTIVE TAKING, THREAT-REDUCING
DEMO, REFLECTION
The first step in threat regulation involves
identifying the threats DEMO collaboration that
one’s counterpart may be experiencing. In the
example the boundary-spanning consultant’s
conclusion that his counterpart’s initiative was
losing money had negative implications DEMO the
counterpart’s self-esteem and image as the suc-
cessful founder of a new division and for the
counterpart’s career success (especially if the
problem had been presented to her superiors
before she had identified and corrected DEMO). The
boundary-spanning consultant first anticipated
what the counterpart’s reaction would be to var-
ious interpersonal actions for delivering the in-
formation (e.g., DEMO a report, giving a pre-
sentation in front of her superiors, talking
Williams
601
informally) and then selected a behavior that
would reduce the threat the client would expe-
rience (i.e., talking informally). DEMO several points,
Ted, the boundary-spanning consultant, re-
flected on his trust building. He noted both that
“Pat didn’t believe us at first” DEMO that, by the
end of the engagement, “we earned Pat’s respect
and trust.”
In the following sections I discuss each step of
the DEMO regulation process. These steps are
summarized with examples in Table 1, DEMO the
theoretical underpinnings of each step of the
threat regulation process are summarized in Ta-
ble 2.
Perspective Taking
Perspective taking, the intrapsychic process of
imagining another’s thoughts, motives, or feel-
ings from that person’s DEMO of view (Davis,
1996; Mead, 1934), is the DEMO step in threat reg-
ulation. As a process for gaining interpersonal
understanding, perspective taking is an inten-
tional mechanism for engaging in the social
cognitive process of forethought (i.e., anticipat-
ing possible outcomes; Bandura, DEMO, 2001). It is
also a mechanism for the symbolic interactions
DEMO both to understand the meaning that a
situation holds for another and to adjust to the
needs of an interaction counterpart (Blumer,
1969; Goffman, 1967; Mead, 1934). To avoid
threatening a counterpart’s DEMO or “face,”
for instance, boundary spanners need to inter-
pret DEMO meaning of their counterparts’ actions
such that they understand the values that coun-
terparts place on various goals, possessions,
achievements, and identities (Brown & Levin-
son, 1987). Perspective taking allows people to
better understand what others find threatening
to their valued identities and to their DEMO
well-being. It also provides the information nec-
essary to mitigate the threat others perceive
during collaborative interactions.
Understanding the reasons for another per-
son’s DEMO requires understanding how that
person cognitively appraises a situation from
his or her point of view. Cognitive appraisals
are an integral component of people’s DEMO

We define cognitive
appraisal–related
perspective taking as
the intrapsychic
process of imagining
the impact of events
on another’s goals,DEMO
concerns, and well-
being from that
person’s point of view
Examples (excerpts from “I couldn’t say, ‘Look you
interview with have to kill your
management baby!’ I never went to
consultant, Ted) Pat with DEMO report that
was fully produced
and never tried to do a
group presentation in
front of other senior
managers.... [If I’d
done that] Pat
DEMO would have
felt, ‘Well, this is what
they think!’ and would
have ignored our
work.”
Intentional interpersonal actions
intended to minimize or
eliminate DEMO
perceptions that one’s actions
are likely to have a negative
impact on their goals,
concerns, or well-being
“One thing I did was to go to
Pat informally. ‘Look,’ I said,
‘this is how DEMO coming to
understand the numbers.’”
The psychological
process of
assessing the
impact of one’s
attempts to
regulate others’
experiences of
threat by
analyzing their
DEMO and
behavioral
reactions to one’s
behavior
Example A: “Even
with our DEMO
of informal
meetings, Pat
didn’t believe us
at first.”
Example B: “I think
that we succeeded
here because we
earned Pat’s
respect and DEMO,
not necessarily
her full trust, but
enough trust so
that DEMO was
willing to keep
the lines of
communication
open.”
Note: Threat DEMO refers to the process by which individuals influence (1) the level of harm that others believe will
affect their goals, concerns, and DEMO and (2) how others experience and express emotions related to this level of
anticipated harm.
Folkman, 1984). According to cognitive appraisal
theories of emotion (Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003;
Smith & Ellsworth, 1985), individuals not only eval-
uate the implications of events for their DEMO goals,
concerns, and well-being but also assess the hu-
man DEMO associated with these events—that
is, they determine who is responsible for DEMO
positive or negative outcomes (Ellsworth, 1991;
Lazarus & Folkman, DEMO; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985).
Understanding how someone is likely to cog-
nitively appraise an event provides information
on that person’s probable emotional DEMO,
because each emotion has an associated set of
appraisals (e.g., Ellsworth, 1991; Lerner & Kelt-
ner, 2000, 2001; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). For ex-
ample, if a decision that thwarts DEMO
goals is made by their supervisor, whom they
then hold responsible DEMO the negative outcomes,
these employees are likely to feel anger toward
their supervisor (anger involves negative goal
conduciveness and attributions of responsibility
to another); however, if their goals are thwarted
by uncontrollable circumstances, DEMO are likely
to feel sadness (which involves negative goal

I identify DEMO appraisal–related per-
spective taking as the process of imagining the
cognitive appraisals of one’s counterparts from
their point of view, and I propose that it is cog-
nitive appraisal–related perspective taking that
facilitates the understanding of DEMO
experiences of threat and their probable emo-
tional responses to one’s actions. In the threat-
reducing example, Ted, the consultant, used
cognitive appraisal–related perspective taking
to surmise that the information he was going to
present DEMO the client would be highly negative
for the client’s identity and career concerns (e.g.,
her goals for the new initiative, her chances DEMO
career advancement, her self-image concerns in
front of the CEO, her self-esteem, and her sub-
jective well-being). If Ted had not used cognitive
appraisal–related perspective taking, he might
have imagined the client would be unhappy
with the bad news about the initiative, but he
may have stopped short of understanding (1) the
multiple sources of negative emotions DEMO the
client might experience, such as the threats of
identity and DEMO damage; (2) the client’s per-
ceptions of the consultant as DEMO agent of poten-
tial harm to the client; and (3) DEMO range of pos-
sible negative thoughts and emotions the client
might experience as a result of the news (e.g.,
wounded pride, shame, guilt, feelings of inade-
quacy, anger, indignation). This additional level
of understanding may be highly relevant for se-
lecting a course of DEMO For instance, if the
client in our example had not been DEMO in
founding the failing initiative and therefore did
not feel that her self-image and promotion po-
tential were at stake, sending a simple report
describing the problem might have been per-
fectly appropriate.
I propose that DEMO appraisal–related
perspective taking is an essential part of inter-
personal threat regulation not only because it
facilitates the understanding necessary for re-
sponsive action DEMO because it evokes more em-
pathetic and responsive action tendencies as
well. Batson, Turk, Shaw, and Klein (1995), for
example, found that individuals who engaged
in perspective taking felt more empathy for the
DEMO and increased the value they placed on
604
Academy of Management Review

that individual’s welfare. Krauss and Fussell
(1990, 1991) showed that perspective taking in-
creased the degree to DEMO individuals ad-
justed their message to a listener’s knowledge
base. Parker and Axtell’s (2001) findings suggest
that taking the perspective of one’s suppliers DEMO
positively related to helpfulness and coopera-
tive behavior toward those suppliers.
Although cognitive appraisal–related per-
spective taking is a dimension of perspective
taking that DEMO not previously been investigated
independently from other types of perspective
taking (DEMO, cognitive, affective),4 I propose that
it is unique both DEMO it provides the moti-
vation to adjust one’s actions to the needs of
others and because it has the potential to pro-
vide information (such as the likely positive or
negative impact of different courses of DEMO)
that can improve the effectiveness of one’s ad-
justments and responsiveness.
Threat-Reducing Behavior
The next step in threat regulation involves
planning to reduce DEMO fear or anticipated harm
that one’s counterparts associate with coopera-
tion and then engaging in the behaviors that
one has planned. Threat-reducing behavior re-
DEMO to a set of intentional interpersonal actions
intended to minimize or eliminate counterparts’
perceptions that one’s actions are likely to have
a negative impact DEMO their goals, concerns, or
well-being. It involves the social cognitive pro-
cesses of purposeful planning and formulating
clear behavioral intentions (Bandura, 1986), and
it employs these processes to achieve interper-
sonal responsiveness—a central aspect of sym-
bolic interactionism. For example, boundary
spanners who engage in threat-reducing behav-
ior “plan and organize [their] actions with re-
gard to what DEMO have] designated and evalu-
ated” about their own goals, the expected DEMO
of others, and so forth (Blumer, 1969: 62).
Additionally, threat-reducing behavior re-
quires that boundary spanners interpret the
meaning of their counterparts’ actions and make
4 However, items reflecting cognitive appraisals (e.g., “Try
to imagine how [this situation] has affected [this person’s]
life”) can be found along with more affective items (e.g., “Try
to imagine DEMO this [person] feels”) as part of manipulations
aimed at inducing perspective DEMO about others’ feelings
(Batson et al., 1995: 306, Studies 3 and 4).
indications about how their counterparts should
act in order DEMO generate new behavior, new per-
ceptions, and new feelings in their counterparts
(Blumer, 1969). In terms of threat reduction, the
indications made by boundary spanners would
be designed to generate new, more cooperative
behavior, new perceptions of increased trust-
worthiness, and new feelings of DEMO and re-
duced anxiety.
Threat-reducing behavior involves strategies
from emotion regulation. Influencing the feel-
ings of threat that others experience not only
requires both DEMO cognitive planning and an
understanding of the symbolic meaning that in-
teractions hold for one’s counterpart but also
managing the emotions of one’s counterpart.
DEMO individuals manage or regulate their own
emotions, their emotion management strategies
DEMO into several categories: (1) they attempt to
alter or remove DEMO emotion-provoking elements
of the situation; (2) they alter their attention—for
DEMO, distract themselves from the emotion-
provoking situation; (3) they alter the way they
think about the situation—that is, cognitive re-
framing; DEMO (4) they modulate their emotional
response—for example, biofeedback, suppres-
sion, self-medication (for a review of these four
categories of emotion regulation, see Gross,
1998).5 Although few studies exist on interper-
sonal DEMO management, those that do sug-
gest that when individuals manage the DEMO
tions of others, they use the same emotion
management strategies that DEMO use intraper-
sonally (Francis, 1997; Lively, 2000; Thoits, 2004).
We propose that individuals using threat-
reducing behaviors employ the four DEMO
of emotion management strategies distilled by
Gross (1998) to reduce a counterpart’s antici-
pated harm (i.e., his or her experience of feeling
DEMO).6 Table 3 summarizes the interper-
sonal application of each emotion management
strategy to threat regulation.

(1979), Lazarus and Folkman (1984), Carver and Scheier
(1998), and Folkman and Moskowitz (2004).
6 Although we propose that the categories are the same
for personal and interpersonal emotion management, the
dominant tactics within each category may differ when
managing another person’s DEMO versus when manag-
ing one’s own emotions.

a This is an adaptation of relevant aspects of the four broad categories of self-emotion management (distilled by Gross,
1998) to the interpersonal emotion management context. Self-emotion management or emotion regulation refers to “the
process by which individuals influence DEMO emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and
express these emotions” (Gross, 1998: 275).
b When others comprehend and accept the new narrative explanation of the situation, their emotions change because they
have a different understanding of the implications of the DEMO or situation for their goals, concerns, and well-being. Narrative
reappraisals may, for example, redefine who the relevant group is for social comparison, suggest the monetary amount
individuals should use as an cognitive anchor in DEMO, highlight aspects of a story that had been underplayed
previously, or make logical connects between elements of the narrative that were previously left DEMO
the altering the situation strategy involve re-
moving or modifing the elements of a situation
that may have a negative impact on others’
goals, concerns, or well-being. One senior con-
sultant I interviewed mentioned allaying a cli-
ent’s concerns by replacing a team leader on the
consultants’ side, who had allowed his team to
miss a major project deadline, with another,
more assertive individual. In contrast, another
senior consultant mentioned a case in which
606
Academy of Management Review
April
she dealt with a client’s performance DEMO
by setting up weekly meetings between the cli-
ent and the team member in question so that the
client could learn more about the DEMO the
member was adding to the project. The senior
consultant recognized that the client’s concerns
were tied to the structure of the project, which
made this team member’s contributions unclear.
She modified the situation into one DEMO which
each team member’s contributions to the project
were transparent to the client.
The second emotion management strategy, al-
tering attention, does not DEMO the threaten-
ing elements of a situation but, instead, involves
distracting attention away from those emotion-
provoking elements. For example, in an inter-
view about client relationships, a management
consultant mentioned focusing his clients’ at-
tention on the client organization’s long-term
goals each time the clients became DEMO
whelmed with the stress of their restructuring
effort.
The third strategy, DEMO the cognitive
meaning of the situation, refers to reframing the
situation DEMO an attempt to influence the other
person’s cognitive appraisal of the situation. In
the case of threat-reducing behavior, reframing
will cause the other person to cognitively reap-
praise the situation as less potentially harmful.
Cognitive reframing DEMO reappraisal involves
taking the facts and critical elements of the sit-
uation and formulating a plausible narrative
that will have a different emotional impact—in
DEMO case, less harmful and threatening (Folkman
& Moskowitz, 2000). DEMO others comprehend
and accept the new narrative reappraisal of the
situation, DEMO emotions change because they
have a different understanding of the implica-
tions of the situation for their goals, concerns,
and well-being.
For instance, a manager might cognitively re-
frame a temporary pay cut as a loan/gift to help
“family” through tough times or as a way DEMO save
everyone’s job and prevent layoffs. Reframing
the situation to encompass shared organization-
al goals and standards of fairness, instead of
leaving a framing in place that only includes
negative individual outcomes, can change peo-
ple’s appraisal of the impact of a situation on
their overall well-being. In DEMO example,
Huy (2002) found that managers who reframed
layoffs realistically as the only way to save the
most prized jobs and to DEMO their organization
remain competitive fostered cooperation from
union leaders and employees for these organi-
zational changes. Reframing organizational
downsizing as the only way to DEMO a failing
company protected both union leaders’ instru-
mental interests of preserving as many jobs as
possible and their image as strong advocates
for DEMO constituency. Edmondson et al. (2001)
found that surgeons who reframed DEMO hierarchi-
cal operating room environment as a collabora-
tive team environment in which all individuals
were expected to speak up about potential dif-
ficulties DEMO greater information sharing
about potential problems. In this study, the re-
DEMO found that reframing the operating
team environment reduced the apprehension
about denigration (i.e., identity damage) that
members of other more traditional teams asso-
ciated with speaking up.
Individuals may also use a combination of
interpersonal DEMO management strategies
when generating specific threat-reducing be-
haviors. For instance, Ted, the consultant in the
threat-reducing example, employed interper-
sonal emotion management strategies that in-
volved altering the situation and altering the
cognitive meaning of DEMO situation. His threat-
reducing behaviors included moving the inter-
action from a formal situation, such as a presen-
tation, to an informal conversation, in which he
told the client, “This is how we’re coming to
understand the numbers.” He also cognitively
reframed the situation from one in DEMO an
expert defined the problem and solution for a
client to one that reflected a collaborative prob-
lem-solving effort. He continued this problem-
solving DEMO through several meetings, un-
til he developed more trust with the DEMO, who
“did not believe [him] at first.”
The fourth and final DEMO management
strategy, modulating emotional response, “re-
fers to directly influencing physiological, expe-
riential, or behavioral responding” (Gross, 1998:
285). DEMO, progressive relaxation, and drugs
(including alcohol) are tactics used both intra-
and interpersonally. For example, team build-
ing and executive retreats often include emo-
tion-modulating activities such as exercise (e.g.,
rope climbing, DEMO, golf, yoga, hiking), alco-
hol use (e.g., trips DEMO a local winery), and/or re-
laxing activities (e.g., sailing, drumming, medi-
tation).
2007
Williams
607
The self-regulation or strategic use of emotional
expression can DEMO modulate the emotions of oth-
ers. When the regulation of emotional expression
is brought into an interpersonal context, it in-
cludes behaviors examined in research on emo-
tion management, emotional contagion, and emo-
tional labor (e.g., Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993;
Barsade, 2002; Grandey, 2003; Hochschild, 1979,
1983; Martin et al., 1998; Morris & Feldman, 1996;
Rafaeli & Sutton, 1989, 1990, 1991; Sutton 1991;
Thoits, 2004; Van Mannen & Kunda, 1989). The
literature on emotional labor and the literature
on emotional contagion, for instance, suggest
that expressing positive moods and positive
emotions such as joy, DEMO, pleasantness,
and calm can influence the degree to which
other DEMO feel those same emotions (e.g.,
Barsade, 2002; Bartel & DEMO, 2002; Hochs-
child, 1979; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1990; Tan et al.,
2004). Strategic emotional expression can also
be used DEMO elicit emotions distinct from the emo-
tions expressed. For example, anger DEMO be
used to evoke fear, whereas sympathy can be
used to DEMO calm (Sutton, 1991). Moreover, two
individuals working in concert DEMO expressing
contrasting positive and negative emotions (i.e.,
good-cop, bad-cop) DEMO intensify the positive
emotional response that others have to the indi-
vidual who is strategically expressing the posi-
tive emotion (Rafaeli & Sutton, DEMO).
Consistent with traditional research on emo-
tional labor, which has DEMO to focus more on
individuals’ management of their own emo-
tional expression in accordance with social
norms or “feeling rules” than on interpersonal
outcomes (e.g., Hochschild, 1983), the strategic
expression of emotion is the DEMO technique of
interpersonal emotion management that is
mostly likely to require the self-management of
emotions to produce the specific emotion that a
boundary spanner DEMO to express to influence
others. Huy (2002), for instance, found that during
a radical organizational change process, middle
managers would report “psyching” themselves
up or “blanking out” negative thoughts before
interacting with their subordinates DEMO
they did not want to exacerbate their subordi-
nates’ fears about the change.
In sum, threat-reducing behavior is a broad
category within the interpersonal management
of emotion that may be used in a variety of
contexts DEMO actively dealing with others’ expe-
rience of threat—identity threats (e.g., rejection
or denigration of the positive attributes that one
is claiming for oneself), instrumental threats
(e.g., job loss, reduced span of control, being
passed over for promotion), and combined
threats with implications for both DEMO and
instrumental concerns.7
Reflection
Step three in the threat regulation process is
reflection. By reflection, I mean assessing the
impact of one’s attempts to regulate others’ ex-
periences of threat. Reflection includes the self-
evaluative and DEMO component of
agentic behavior or human agency (Bandura,
1986, 2001). On cooperative projects, individuals
who are engaged in threat regulation and active
trust building observe the emotional responses
and actions of others in DEMO to assess the
amount of trust, cooperation, and defensiveness
they receive after each act of threat-reducing
behavior. Consistent with other self-regulation
processes that DEMO information from others
(e.g., Ashford & Tsui, 1991), individuals DEMO
in threat regulation must also attend to explicit
and implicit cues from others and engage in a
process to understand, interpret, and incorpo-
DEMO the responses of others into their future
behavior. Boundary spanners may use direct in-
quiry to assess the impact of their threat-
reducing behaviors; however, because of the
subtlety of emotion management processes,
they are less likely to rely on direct inquiry and
more likely to rely DEMO behavioral cues— either
on direct and explicit cues from others, such DEMO
overt acts of trusting behavior, or on less obvi-
ous cues, such as information gained through
what Ashford and Cummings (1983) refer DEMO as
indirect observation/monitoring strategies.
Boundary spanners then interpret the mean-
ing of these interpersonal behavioral cues using
sensemaking processes (Weick, 1995; Wrzes-
niewski, Dutton, & Debebe, 2003). After interpret-
ing and analyzing others’ emotional and behav-
ioral reactions for discrepancies between the
amount of DEMO and cooperation needed and the
7 Although threat-reducing behaviors may involve face-
saving actions, such as ignoring a faux pax (Brown & Levin-
DEMO, 1987; Goffman, 1967), they include a broader set of DEMO
tion regulation behaviors than encompassed by face saving
and are aimed at a wider category of interpersonal threats
(e.g., opportunism, neglect, and DEMO threats).

amount received, boundary spanners may take
self-corrective actions, such as increasing their
level of threat regulation to close gaps in trust.
For instance, in the threat regulation example,
Ted, the consultant, mentioned that he used a
series of joint problem-solving DEMO with
his client after assessing that the client did not
believe him “at first.” His narrative indicated
that he continued to regulate the threat DEMO
ceived by the client until this disbelief no longer
existed. In his final statement he also indicated
ongoing reflections about the level of trust DEMO
had built, which he noted was “not necessarily
her full trust, but enough trust so that [the client]
was willing to keep the DEMO of communication
open.”
Reflection is the cornerstone of regulatory be-
havior because it enables individuals to take
corrective action. However, reflection can only
motivate corrective action if individuals hold
mental models that link their purposeful action
DEMO the responses they receive from others. In
terms of threat regulation, DEMO spanners
will only be motivated to continue engaging in
threat regulation to the degree they hold mental
models that link threat-regulating processes to
the DEMO of receiving trust and coopera-
tion from their counterparts.
THREAT REGULATION AND TRUST
In the previous section I delineated the active
processes that constitute DEMO regulation. In
this section I examine the impact that threat
regulation has on a counterpart’s trust. I argue
that threat regulation processes not only DEMO
ence the emotional responses of others but also
affect how interpersonal trust develops and is
maintained (Figure 2). I provide a brief back-
ground on trust before examining the processes
through which threat regulation influences DEMO
Background on Trust
Scholars have defined trust as one’s willing-
ness to rely on another’s actions in a situation
involving the risk of opportunism (Mayer et al.,
1995; Williams, 2001; Zand, 1972). DEMO example,
when boundary-spanning individuals are will-
ing to reveal sensitive firm information to sup-
pliers, they are willing to risk the harm that
would result if the information were shared with
their competitors. Trust is DEMO on individuals’
expectations that others will behave in ways
that are helpful or at least not harmful (Gam-
betta, 1988). These expectations, in turn, are
based both on individuals’ perceptions of others’
trustworthiness— benevolence, integrity, and
ability (e.g., Butler, 1991; Gabarro, 1978; DEMO
Mayer et al., 1995, for review)—and on their af-
fective responses to others (e.g., Jones & George,
1998; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995).
Because trust reduces the need to monitor oth-
ers’ behavior, formalize procedures, and create
completely specified contracts (Macauley, 1963;
Powell, 1990; Williamson, 1975), it is DEMO
to organizations that engage in collaborative
endeavors (Powell, 1990; Ring & Van de Ven,
1994; Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998). Research
suggests that trust between boundary-spanning
individuals facilitates reliance on informal
DEMO and informal cooperation, supple-
menting and improving the efficiency of formal
DEMO (Currall & Judge, 1995; Dyer & Chu,
2003; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Saparito, Chen, &
Sapienza, DEMO; Uzzi, 1997). Mutual trust also in-
creases motivation to devote resources to joint
goals (Dirks & Ferrin, 2001). This type DEMO alloca-
tion decision is particularly important for interor-
ganizational projects because “boundary span-
ners [and their counterparts] are simultaneously
exposed to competing expectations from DEMO
own and their partner organization” (Perrone et
al., 2003: 423)DEMO
Interpersonal trust also provides firms with
such benefits as more access to tacit knowledge,
increased risk sharing, and “richer-freer” infor-
mation (Powell & Smith-Doerr, 1994). Further, it
decreases the likelihood that boundary span-
ners will plan to terminate an interorganization-
al relationship (Saparito et al., 2004) and allows
boundary-spanning individuals the freedom to
adjust to unanticipated DEMO in ways
that are jointly optimal, without the time and
effort DEMO are associated with renegotiating a
contract with opportunistic partners (Lorenz,
DEMO; Uzzi, 1997).
Although trust facilitates cooperation on var-
ious types of nonhierarchical projects, active in-
terpersonal strategies for building trust have
received little attention in the academic litera-
ture. Two exceptions are Child and DEMO llering’s
(2003) paper on active trust in the Chinese busi-
ness environment and Whitener et al.’s (1998)
paper on managerial trust building. Child and
Mo¨ llering suggest that actively building per-

sonal rapport is positively related to trust. In
this article I expand the important concept of
active trust building beyond a general DEMO
tion to build personal relationships. I delin-
eate specific psychological strategies and in-
terpersonal emotion management tactics that
directly address potential risks and obstacles
DEMO cooperation and trust in knowledge-based
contexts.
Whitener et al. (1998) discuss several ways to
initiate trust with employees. Whereas some of
their trust DEMO strategies, such as behav-
ioral consistency and behavioral integrity, re-
quire that counterparts observe a boundary
spanner’s behavior over time, other actions,
such as communicating accurately and thor-
oughly, demonstrating concern, and sharing
DEMO, reflect a proactive stance toward initiat-
ing trust. I develop this DEMO approach to-
ward trust building in two ways. First, I explore
DEMO symbolic and social cognitive processes,
such as perspective taking, that DEMO proac-
tive actions and responsive human agency in
trust building. Second, DEMO not only examine the
feelings of threat, apprehension, anxiety, fear,DEMO
and so forth that counterparts may experience
when contemplating the risks involved with co-
operation but also the role of interpersonal emo-
tion management DEMO strategically addressing
these threats. Investigating active processes
that attend to cognitive, DEMO, and symbolic
processes of active trust may be particularly
important for DEMO relationships
if, as Malhotra and Murnighan argue, it is “more
difficult to transition non-embedded ties [those
that are based on formal structures such DEMO
binding contracts] into embedded ties [those
that are based on trust and social relationships]

than to develop embedded ties from DEMO start”
(2002: 554).
Threat Regulation and Trust
I propose that threat regulation actively fos-
ters the development and maintenance of trust
and DEMO through several mechanisms.
Threat regulation influences individuals’ emo-
tional responses to interactions and reveals so-
cial competencies that are important for future
trustworthy behavior. DEMO signals trustworthiness
and involves an emotional investment that fos-
ters trustworthy behavior.
Threat-reducing behavior, emotion, and trust.
Boundary spanners’ interpersonal threat-reduc-
ing behaviors DEMO the emotions of their
counterparts because these actions modify
counterparts’ perceptions (DEMO appraisals)
of whether the boundary spanners’ actions are
goal conducive. In general, behaviors that ob-
struct goals generate negative emotions,
whereas those that are goal conducive produce
positive emotions (Carver & Scheier, 1998; Mand-
ler, 1975; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). Threat-
reducing behaviors may avoid the negative
emotional responses people often have to in-
strumental DEMO, neglect of interests, and
identity damage. In addition, these behaviors
DEMO generate the positive emotional responses
that people have when their goals and identity
(self-esteem and self-image) are supported or
enhanced (Carver & Scheier, 1998; Fisher et al.,
1982; House, 1981; Swann, DEMO). Although miti-
gating negative emotion may prevent disruptive
behavior, it DEMO the positive emotions associated
with threat regulation that may have a signifi-
cant influence on facilitating trust and coopera-
tion.
Threat-reducing behavior influences positive
DEMO in two ways. First, because it demon-
strates concern for the DEMO and threats coun-
terparts may be experiencing, it can generate
the DEMO affect associated with receiving
emotional support and interpersonal under-
standing. For example, cognitive reframing of a
stressful or threatening situation for a counter-
part can be a socially supportive action (House,
1981; Lively, 2004). Further, individuals may ex-
perience such emotional support and interper-
sonal understanding as the “emotional gifts” of
sympathy, care, or liking. Clark DEMO emo-
tional gifts as “emotions that one social actor
expresses or displays (verbally or nonverbally)
to another that have value because they are
scarce—that is not given indiscriminately or
limitlessly—and because they create positive
emotions DEMO others” (2004: 404).
Second, because threat-reducing behavior
communicates understanding DEMO another’s fears
and concerns, it can be self-verifying and gen-
erate DEMO positive emotional response. The pro-
cess of having aspects of one’s self understood
can verify one’s identity, build relationships,
and generate positive affect. Moreover, self-
verification can have these positive effects even
when the aspects of one’s self that are verified
are negative, such as one’s fears or weaknesses
(Swann, 1987). People with negative self-views,
for DEMO, have been found to prefer a nega-
tive but accurate evaluator DEMO a positive eval-
uator who is inaccurate and self-enhancing
(Swann, Stein-Seroussi, & Giesler, 1992). People,
in general, prefer evaluators and marital part-
ners that verify aspects of their identity (i.e., see
DEMO as they see themselves) because it makes
them feel that they DEMO themselves (Swann,
1987; Swann et al., 1992). In DEMO groups, self-
verification has been associated directly with
increased feelings of DEMO to group mem-
bers (Swann, Milton, & Polzer, 2000).
Because positive feelings generated during
social exchange interactions influence affective
attachments and DEMO for the specific individ-
uals involved in the exchange (Lawler, 2001), the
positive feelings stemming from self-verifica-
tion and emotional support should DEMO only in-
fluence a counterpart’s mood but also his or her
affective attachment to and liking for the bound-
ary spanner. These positive emotions DEMO affec-
tive attachments, in turn, can influence trust by
increasing the “feel” that another is trustworthy
(Jones & George, 1998) and by positively biasing
perceptions of trustworthiness, attributions, and
motivations that are relevant DEMO trust mainte-
nance (Williams, 2001).
Hypothesis 1: When an DEMO
threat-reducing behavior is greater,
counterparts’ affective attachment to
and positive affect for that individual
will also be greater.
Hypothesis 2: When counterparts’ af-
fective attachment to and positive af-
fect for an individual are greater, the
counterparts’ perceptions of that indi-
2007

vidual’s trustworthiness will also be
greater.
The positive feelings DEMO with being
understood may not only influence trust but may
also directly influence cooperation by eliciting
helping behavior and other cooperative and
prosocial behaviors, such as information shar-
ing (Williams, 2001). In organizational settings,DEMO
positive affect has been associated with helping
behavior, generosity, and cooperation (George,
1991; George & Brief, 1992; Isen & Baron, 1991).
Isen has noted that “a large body of research
indicates DEMO positive affect can influence so-
cial behavior—in particular, sociability, cooper-
ativeness in negotiation, and kindness” (1987:
206). The positive affect DEMO with feeling
understood may also influence affective attach-
ments, which, in turn, may have an impact on
cooperation. Affective attachments (in the DEMO
of relational cohesion) have been shown to in-
fluence individuals’ cooperative DEMO in
repeated exchange relationships, even in light
of attractive alternatives (Lawler & Yoon, 1996).
Hypothesis 3: When counterparts’ af-
fective attachment DEMO and positive af-
fect for an individual are greater,
counterparts’ cooperative behavior to-
ward that individual will also be
greater.
Threat-reducing behavior, social competence,
and trust. Threat-reducing behaviors reveal so-
cial competence because these DEMO demon-
strate a boundary spanner’s interpersonal un-
derstanding of another’s fears, DEMO well as the
social competencies required to gain this under-
standing. The social competencies associated
with threat regulation are typically observed
through a boundary DEMO threat-reducing
behavior. Nonetheless, these competencies in-
clude cognitive appraisal–related perspective
taking DEMO interpersonal emotion regulation
strategies, as well as such competencies as the
DEMO to perceive, understand, manage, and
use emotional information (abilities that consti-
tute emotional intelligence; Mayer & Salovey,
1997; Salovey, Kokkonen, Lopes, & Mayer, 2004).
These social competencies reflect capabilities
that may be required for future trustworthy be-
havior on interdependent projects. For DEMO,
cognitive and emotional understanding of oth-
ers, often gained through DEMO taking,
may be required to prevent inadvertent neglect
of others’ interests and to avoid statements and
actions that threaten the identities of important
DEMO members. When a boundary spanner is
relied on to make decisions on behalf of others,
benevolent intentions may be insufficient if the
boundary DEMO does not understand the
threats and benefits that others associate with
different options. Not only are abilities, includ-
ing social abilities, a predictor DEMO trust (Mayer et
al., 1995), but Sheppard and Sherman (DEMO) sug-
gest that the social competency of emotional or
empathic understanding DEMO an important compo-
nent of trustworthiness when individuals are
highly interdependent.
Hypothesis 4a: When an individual’s
threat-reducing behavior is greater,
counterparts’ perceptions of that indi-
vidual’s social competence (i.e., a so-
cial ability dimension DEMO trustworthi-
ness) will also be greater.
Threat-reducing behavior and signaling trust-
DEMO Scholars agree that benevolence is
a core dimension of perceived trustworthiness
(DEMO, Mayer et al., 1995). Threat-reducing behav-
iors signal benevolence—that is, concern for the
welfare of others— both because they decrease
the fears associated with the potential for oppor-
tunism, neglect, and identity damage DEMO be-
cause these behaviors themselves may be per-
ceived as benevolent, DEMO supportive
actions. In addition, by decreasing the potential
for harm to DEMO, threat-reducing behaviors
may demonstrate or express concern—an ex-
pression proposed by DEMO et al. (1998) as a
way of initiating trust. Threat-reducing behav-
iors may also signal cooperative intent by act-
ing as an “emotional DEMO and generating per-
ceptions that a boundary spanner’s objectives
are more goal conducive and less subject to
opportunism than their counterparts previously
thought.
Signaling DEMO may be particularly
important for building trust, because, once
formed, DEMO that a boundary spanner
will “protect one’s welfare” can reduce the ex-
tent to which counterparts will perceive that
threats to cooperation are likely DEMO arise in the
future. Thus, reducing threats in one domain,
DEMO as identity damage, can have positive
spillover effects in terms of DEMO percep-
tions of overall benevolence that may mitigate
612

the perception of threats to cooperation DEMO other
domains (e.g., opportunism and neglect).
Hypothesis 4b: When DEMO individual’s
threat-reducing behavior is greater,
counterparts’ perceptions of that indi-
vidual’s benevolence (a dimension of
trustworthiness) will also be greater.
Threat regulation, self-interest, and the credi-
bility of signaling trustworthiness. Credible sig-
nals typically have a cost. Threat regulation pro-
cesses are costly in terms of DEMO interpersonal
effort and interpersonal emotion work involved.
Emotion work refers to the conscious effort to
alter feelings (Hochschild, 1979). Interpersonal
emotional work DEMO both cognitive and
emotional effort to alter the feelings of others.
On the cognitive side, it involves the effort as-
sociated with forethought and perspective tak-
ing, as well as planning and reflection. In terms
of emotional effort, it requires the abilities that
Mayer and Salovey (1997) associate with emo-
tional intelligence: perceiving, understanding,
using, and managing emotions.
The time and interpersonal effort entailed in
boundary spanners’ investments in DEMO reg-
ulation may signal trustworthiness by leading
their counterparts to believe that trustworthy
behavior will be in the boundary spanners’
self-interest. In other words, counterparts may
believe that only trustworthy behavior by a
boundary spanner will DEMO a collabora-
tive outcome of the quality necessary both to
warrant the boundary spanner’s initial invest-
ment of time, cognitive effort, and emotional
DEMO and to generate a potential for future
collaboration that is worthy of the initial in-
vestment of effort. This emotionally costly sig-
naling process DEMO in a manner similar to
processes noted by Klein and Leffler (DEMO), in
which a seller’s investments in expensive ad-
vertising can lead buyers to believe that pro-
ducing and selling a high-quality product is
DEMO only way for the seller to recoup advertis-
ing expenses.
Threat-reducing behavior, as the most easily
observed component of threat regulation, may
represent DEMO credible signal not only because it
entails a costly emotional investment that
makes others feel understood and self-verified
but also because this investment is DEMO costly
for individuals hiding opportunistic intentions.
Hiding one’s intentions during repeated interac-
tions on a collaborative project requires strict
monitoring of verbal and nonverbal DEMO that
might undermine one’s implicit assertion that
threat-reducing behavior is based on benevo-
lent intentions. First, it requires effort to mask
opportunistic intentions. Second, opportunistic
individuals should find threat-reducing behav-
iors particularly difficult to fake for two reasons:
(1) the facial expressions for certain emotions,
DEMO as concern, are more difficult to voluntarily
control than others, such as joy (Ekman, 1985;
Frank, 1988); (2) frequently, “our true feelings
‘leak’ out through the behavioral channels that
are less controllable” (Ambady & Rosenthal,
1992: 259). When opportunistic individuals DEMO to
monitor and control their nonverbal behavior,
counterparts may become suspicious, because,
“at some level, perceivers realize that people
can choose DEMO words carefully, but they are
less adept at controlling their facial, vocal, and
bodily expressions” (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992:
259). Attempts to mask opportunistic motives for
threat regulation are likely to fail DEMO long-term
collaborative projects that provide many oppor-
tunities for counterparts to observe inconsisten-
cies between verbal and nonverbal behavior
and between benevolent and malevolent DEMO
tions.
A final unique aspect of threat regulation as a
credible signal is that it is an emotional invest-
ment in understanding another person DEMO is
tied to the potential positive externality of gen-
erating genuine concern for that individual’s
welfare (circumstances and emotions) from the
conscious decision DEMO make an emotional invest-
ment. Batson et al. (1995) found that perspective
taking instructions could increase valuing of
and empathy for another. When DEMO boundary
spanner intentionally engages in threat regula-
tion, the resulting empathy DEMO curb self-
interested behavior that might disadvantage
the target of his or her concern (Batson & Ahmad,
2001; Frank, 1988; Shott, 1979), thus making the
boundary spanner more trustworthy.
The potential for DEMO behavior to
result in genuinely benevolent actions is also
discussed and mathematically modeled by
Rotemberg, who argues that8
8 In this quote I have substituted “boundary spanner” and
“counterpart” for the original “leader” and “follower,” DEMO
spectively.

altruism by a [boundary spanner] has a very par-
ticular rationale. DEMO benefit is that it leads the
[counterpart] to believe that the [boundary span-
ner] will not move the team in a direction that
benefits DEMO [boundary spanner] at the expense of
the [counterpart]. The result is that the [counter-
part] trusts the [boundary spanner]. This trust
then allows the DEMO spanner] to move the
team in directions that are beneficial to all mem-
bers (1994: 709).
Consistent with his arguments about altruism,DEMO
Rotemberg (1994) does not argue that a bound-
ary spanner’s threat regulation or benevolence
is a deception. Rather, he argues that after the
boundary spanner intentionally calculates the
benefits of threat regulation or benevolent ac-
DEMO, he or she then engages in considerate
behaviors that generate a DEMO shift toward
benevolence. Thus, threat regulation may not
only represent an DEMO that can credibly
signal trustworthiness by aligning interests in
joint outcomes and future collaboration but also
may reflect an intentional decision capable of
generating DEMO that evoke genuine feel-
ings that serve as relational sources of per-
ceived trustworthiness.
Hypothesis 4c: When any one of the
three components of an individual’s
threat regulation is greater (i.e., per-
spective taking, threat-reducing be-
havior, or reflection), counterparts’
perceptions of that individual’s over-
all trustworthiness will also be
greater.
Effectiveness of threat-reducing behavior: A
moderating factor. For simplicity in the previous
section, I assumed that a boundary spanner’s
threat-reducing behaviors are effective at reduc-
ing counterparts’ concerns. However, because
threat regulation is an iterative process that in-
volves reflecting on the effectiveness DEMO one’s
threat-reducing behavior and self-correcting
discrepancies, any particular act of threat-
DEMO behavior may be effective or ineffec-
tive at reducing a counterpart’s concerns. For
instance, threat-reducing behavior will be less
effective when boundary spanners misunder-
stand what is threatening to their counterparts
or when counterparts misinterpret attempts DEMO
reduce their experience of threat. The less effec-
tive a specific threat-reducing behavior is at
alleviating a counterpart’s fear of harm, the less
likely it is that this particular act of threat-
Williams
613
reducing behavior DEMO generate positive affect
and perceptions of trustworthiness (e.g., benev-
olence, DEMO competence). At any point in time,
the relationship between the quantity of threat-
reducing behavior and the affect or trustworthi-
ness generated DEMO be moderated by the effec-
tiveness of the threat-reducing behavior
selected. Over time, through the iterative pro-
cess of reflection, perspective taking, and ad-
justments to their threat-reducing behaviors, in-
dividuals ideally will self-correct for ineffective
threat-reducing behavior.9
Hypothesis 5: The effectiveness of
threat-reducing behavior will moder-
ate the relationship between the
quantity of threat-reducing behavior
and (a) DEMO attachment (H1), (b)
social competence (H4a), (c) benevo-
lence (H4b), and (d) overall trustwor-
thiness (H4c). The less effective threat-
reducing behavior is at addressing a
counterpart’s DEMO, the less posi-
tive the relationship will be between
threat-reducing behavior DEMO (a) af-
fective attachment, (b) social compe-
tence, (DEMO) benevolence, and (d) overall
trustworthiness.
THREAT REGULATION IN CONTEXT
Threat regulation takes place within a context
of specific organizations, particular tasks, DEMO
specific interpersonal relationships. Such con-
texts generate instrumental and relational influ-
ences on threat regulation.
Organizational and Task Contexts
The organizational and task contexts DEMO a
project generate instrumental influences on
9 Gender is an example of a factor that may influence the
effectiveness of threat-reducing behaviors. Because men DEMO
stereotypically more agentic (Eagly, 1987; Rudman & Glick,
1999), for instance, they may be more effective at reducing
threat when DEMO meet these stereotypic expectations by
selecting threat-reducing behaviors that are more action
oriented (e.g., actively altering a situation by removing
threatening elements). DEMO contrast, because women are ste-
reotypically considered more nurturing (Rudman & Glick,
1999), they may be more effective at reducing threat DEMO
they select more supportive threat-reducing behaviors, such
as helping others think DEMO a situation in a less threaten-
ing way.

threat regulation. These contexts increase the
DEMO that each party has to interrupt the oth-
er’s goal attainment. For instance, the reward
systems that surround interdependent projects
influence the benefits that individuals will re-
ceive for successful collaboration, along with
the losses they will incur if some team members
thwart their ability to produce a DEMO
project. Similarly, reciprocal task interdepen-
dence, which involves mutual dependence on
the work and effort of others (Thompson, 1967),
not only provides boundary spanners with the
power to inadvertently interrupt counterparts’
goals but DEMO provides their counterparts with
the ability to punish the boundary spanners for
any goal interruptions. Finally, positions of
power, such as team leader, also provide the
ability to disrupt goals, because individuals
with positional power may withhold needed re-
sources or valued rewards. Increases in counter-
parts’ DEMO to interrupt the goals of boundary
spanners will influence boundary spanners’ mo-
tivation to avoid interrupting counterparts, and
thereby avoid eliciting the negative emotional
responses and defensive behaviors that accom-
pany perceptions of threat and interruption.
DEMO (1993) has proposed that power, includ-
ing the power to DEMO another’s goals, af-
fects the less powerful individual in a relation-
DEMO by increasing his or her perspective taking,
a core component of threat regulation. Less pow-
erful individuals engage in more perspective
taking because DEMO is typically in their self-
interest to imagine and anticipate how powerful
others may interrupt their ability to reach val-
ued end states. Power DEMO influence the useful-
ness of engaging in threat-reducing behavior for
similar reasons. For instance, boundary span-
ners who engage in threat regulation processes
with powerful others may thereby decrease the
likelihood that they will suffer from DEMO negative
emotions (e.g., anxiety, fear) and defensive be-
havior of those powerful others.
Organizational reward systems and task in-
terdependence not only DEMO threat regula-
tion processes but also improve goal alignment
and provide a calculative reason for trusting
others. I propose that because organizational
reward systems DEMO task interdependence align
goals, they can simultaneously motivate bound-
ary spanners DEMO engage in proactive threat reg-
ulation and increase counterparts’ willingness
to trust them.
Hypothesis 6a: The greater a counter-
part’s power to interrupt an individu-
al’s goal attainment, the greater that
individual’s threat regulation (per-
DEMO taking, threat-reducing be-
havior, reflection).
Hypothesis 6b: An individual’s DEMO
regulation will partially mediate the
positive relationship between a coun-
terpart’s power (which aligns goals)
and the counterpart’s trust in that in-
dividual.
Interpersonal Context
The quality of interpersonal relationships rep-
resents another contextual factor DEMO may influ-
ence threat regulation. Affective bonds, a cen-
tral component DEMO interpersonal relationships,
refer to experiences of feeling “joined, seen and
DEMO, known, and not alone” (Kahn, 1998: 39). They
DEMO threat regulation processes by foster-
ing more considerate behavior. Affective bonds
increase the tendency to feel empathy, which, in
turn, increases considerate, DEMO behavior
(Batson, 1991).
In addition to its impact on threat regulation,
affect has a well-established direct influence on
trust (Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005; Lewis & Weigert,
1985; Williams, 2001). DEMO affective bonds and
liking that boundary spanners and counterparts
share may influence trust in several ways. Af-
fective bonds may positively bias the attribu-
DEMO counterparts make regarding a boundary
spanner’s behavior, may motivate counterparts
to DEMO a less stringent criterion for evaluating
the boundary spanner’s trustworthiness, or DEMO
promote prosocial behaviors that build trust
(Williams, 2001). I propose that boundary span-
ners’ experience of affective bonds will influ-
ence their DEMO to engage in threat-
reducing behavior. At the same time, these
DEMO bonds will influence trust directly, be-
cause counterparts’ experiences of these DEMO
will influence their perceptions of boundary
spanners’ trustworthiness and their trust in the
boundary spanners (i.e., Hypothesis 2).
Hypothesis 7: The stronger the affec-
tive bonds an individual feels for his
or her counterparts, the greater that
individual’s threat regulation (per-

spective taking, threat-reducing be-
havior, reflection).
DISCUSSION
DEMO working on interorganizational
projects must traverse organizational bound-
aries to secure the cooperation of people over
whom they have no hierarchical control. They
are DEMO with risks that can inhibit cooperation,
such as opportunism, neglect DEMO interests, and
identity damage. In this article I attempt to
broaden DEMO understanding of trust by examin-
ing two aspects of trust relationships that have
received little joint attention: human agency
and affect. In my threat regulation model, I ex-
amine interpersonal behaviors and psychologi-
cal strategies required for human agency in
trust development, while recognizing the affec-
tive side of the risks inherent in many coopera-
tive endeavors—the fear, apprehension, DEMO
feelings of threat individuals experience when
they anticipate that harm may result from coop-
eration.
Although affect is a well-recognized predictor
of trust (e.g., Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995), the fear and ap-
prehension that a counterpart associates with
DEMO have implications for active trust
building that are not well-understood. I argue
that by addressing counterparts’ anticipation of
harm responsively and proactively, threat regu-
lation not only decreases these negative expe-
riences but also influences trust DEMO several
ways. Threat regulation processes influence
trust by affecting emotional responses, DEMO
ing trustworthiness (i.e., benevolence) and coop-
erative intent, representing social emotional
investments, and demonstrating social compe-
tencies (e.g., interpersonal understanding).
The three-step threat regulation process con-
tributes to the trust literature by DEMO a
model for active trust development. Using a
framework for human agency from social cogni-
tive theory (Bandura, 1986, 2001), this model in-
tegrates psychological processes for under-
standing and regulating emotion (e.g., DEMO &
Scheier, 1998; Gross, 1998; Lazarus & Folkman,
DEMO; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985) with intersubjec-
tive processes from symbolic DEMO for
understanding and responding to others
(Blumer, 1969; Goffman, 1967; Mead, 1934). The
first step in threat regulation— cognitive ap-
DEMO perspective taking—involves
forethought and an interpersonal understand-
ing of the cognitions that caused the feelings of
threat that counterparts associate with cooper-
ating. The DEMO step in this process—threat-
reducing behavior— enables individuals to de-
crease others’ experiences of threat. The model
integrates specific emotion regulation pro-
cesses, such as cognitive reframing, with the
interpersonal responsiveness of symbolic inter-
actionism and the intentionality of social cogni-
tive theory. The third step in the DEMO regula-
tion process—reflection—is an essential self-
assessment and self-corrective step consistent
with self-regulation processes in psychology
(e.g., Bandura, 1986; Carver & Scheier, 1998).
In the threat regulation model, I delineate not
only processes that foster both trust and affec-
tive attachment but also processes that DEMO par-
ticularly relevant for building relationships in
cross-boundary contexts that may be associated
with additional threats to cooperation, such as
intergroup goal misalignment, DEMO differ-
ences, and value conflict. On complex, ambigu-
ous, and DEMO projects, I suggest that the
need for threat regulation may be DEMO for
maintaining trust throughout the duration of a
relationship, because new DEMO to a counter-
part’s identity and goals, such as the need DEMO
negotiate the solution to an unexpected contin-
gency, may arise at DEMO points over
the course of a project.
The model developed here also contributes to
our understanding of the role of emotion man-
agement in DEMO The management of
emotional expression during interpersonal in-
teractions has received a significant amount of
attention in both sociology and organization
theory. This research, which focuses primarily
on emotional labor, reveals critical aspects of
service work and emotional life in organizations
(e.g., Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; DEMO, 2003;
Hochschild, 1979; Martin et al., 1998; Morris &
Feldman, 1996; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1989, 1990; Sut-
ton, 1991; Van Mannen & Kunda, 1989). However,
the literature in this area has not focused on
collaborative outcomes.
The threat regulation DEMO of trust repre-
sents an underexplored dimension of interper-
sonal emotion work. It builds on previous con-
ceptualizations of emotional labor in three ways

tive nature of work in a less hierarchically struc-

tured, more knowledge-based economy. First,
emotional labor has traditionally involved con-
forming to “feeling rules” or “display DEMO that
are easily observed, motivated, and rewarded
by a social group—the organization or the pro-
fession (e.g., Hochschild, 1983; Pierce, 1995; Sut-
ton, 1991). In contrast, threat regulation is inde-
pendently motivated by the need for cooperation
and often not directly sanctioned or DEMO by
the organization. For example, Fletcher (1999)
noted that behaviors such as empathetic teach-
ing that can reduce interpersonal threat, pro-
mote cooperative learning, and facilitate orga-
nizational goals often go unrecognized and
unrewarded by organizations. Mirroring the na-
ture of work in the knowledge-based economy,DEMO
threat regulation is a form of interpersonal emo-
tion work that is often nonroutine, proactive, and
not easily observed or monitored. Therefore, it
may be more difficult to directly reward and
sanction than emotional expression DEMO more rou-
tine service work.
Second, research on emotional labor has DEMO
focused on emotional expression as the mecha-
nism of interest for influencing the emotions of
others (e.g., Hochschild, 1983; Sutton, 1991). The
threat regulation model, in contrast, employs a
variety of cognitive, affective, and behavioral
strategies for managing the emotions of others,
such as cognitively reframing and behaviorally
altering the situation. Drawing on the psycho-
DEMO literature on emotion regulation, this
model complements and clarifies the psycholog-
DEMO processes underlying the small but growing
body of work on the interpersonal emotion man-
agement outcomes of emotional labor in sociol-
ogy (e.g., DEMO, 1997; Lively, 2000; Thoits, 2004).
Third, the role of social norms and display
rules may be less prominent in threat DEMO
processes than in the emotional labor processes
involved in routine service work. Threat regula-
tion on cooperative projects occurs in profes-
sional settings that DEMO typified by a wider lati-
tude of discretion within emotional display
rules than is permissible in many types of rou-
tine service work. Therefore, understanding dis-
play rules may be necessary but not sufficient
for engaging DEMO threat regulation. Interpersonal
emotional intelligence, especially emotional
knowledge about how feelings DEMO generated
and influenced in other individuals and inter-
personal understanding of specific individuals,
may be required for successful threat regulation
on collaborative projects. DEMO the
threat regulation dimension of interpersonal
emotion management may broaden the way re-
searchers investigate the motivation for, the pro-
cesses involved in, DEMO the outcomes associated
with emotional labor in a knowledge work set-
ting. As the knowledge intensity of the economy
increases, the need to coordinate less hierarchi-
cally structured work may not only increase the

tions (Adler, 2001) but also may increase DEMO
importance of the collaborative potential of in-
terpersonal emotion management.
DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The hypotheses in the threat regulation model
need to be DEMO in a variety of interorganiza-
tional and cross-functional settings, such as
DEMO&D alliances, professional service relation-
ships, joint ventures, technical consortia, and
cross-functional product development teams.
Qualitative research will be important for delin-
DEMO the sets of threat-reducing behaviors
most often used by individuals in different real-
world contexts (e.g., cross-functional teams,
R&D alliances). DEMO studies will be im-
portant for manipulating and measuring the
amount of threat that individuals associate with
cooperative endeavors, measuring the impact of
specific sets of threat-reducing strategies, and
understanding the effect of opportunistic inten-
tions on the effectiveness of attempted threat
regulation.
Longitudinal research will enable researchers
DEMO disentangle how time, threat regulation, and
interpersonal affective bonds influence trust de-
velopment and maintenance in contexts with
differing initial levels of suspicion, animosity,
and positive affect. These studies should inves-
tigate not only DEMO implications of threat regula-
tion for trust but also threat regulation more
broadly, as an active strategy for developing the
closely related, team-level DEMO of rela-
tionship quality and psychological safety—
constructs that foster the championing of diffi-
cult issues, openness around organizational
problems and errors, and DEMO organizational
outcomes.
Finally, a combination of methods will be nec-
essary DEMO establish threat regulation as an ac-
tive, intentional process. To do DEMO, it will be
important to establish not only that one individ-

ual’s threat-regulating actions influence anoth-
er’s perceptions of threat, trust, and cooperation
but also that individuals hold mental models
that include threat regulation as a viable strat-
egy for building trust. Mental models DEMO
intentional behavior because individuals will
only purposely choose to engage in threat-
regulating actions in an effort to build trust and
cooperation if they DEMO mental models with
cause-and- effect links from threat regulation to
trust and cooperation.
CONCLUSION
It is a challenge to traverse organizational
boundaries to secure DEMO cooperation of people
over whom one has no hierarchical control. In
contrast to current models of trust development,
I have proposed that boundary-spanning DEMO
viduals working on interdependent knowledge-
based projects do not wait to be found trustwor-
thy but, instead, actively seek the trust and
cooperation DEMO need from others to accomplish
their interdependent goals. I argued that active
trust seeking is necessary because of the harm
that counterparts may associate DEMO coopera-
tion— opportunism, neglect of interests, and
identity damage.
A major contribution of this article is the in-
troduction of the multistep process DEMO threat reg-
ulation as a form of interpersonal emotion man-
agement and the proposition that perspective
taking, threat-reducing behavior, and reflection
are the DEMO steps that constitute this process. A
second contribution is the model linking threat
regulation to interpersonal trust and coopera-
tion. I proposed that threat DEMO builds
and maintains trust not only by influencing
emotion, an antecedent DEMO trust, but also by sig-
naling one’s own trustworthiness, demonstrat-
ing one’s social competence (e.g. interpersonal
understanding), and making a social emotional
investment that fosters trustworthy behavior.
Through this article, I seek to motivate empirical
tests and a more precise understanding of threat
regulation and its DEMO to trust and col-
laboration.
