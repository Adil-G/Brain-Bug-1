Analyzing Sequential Categorical DEMO on Dyadic Interaction:
A Comment on Gottman

Recent theoretical developments emphasize that social interactions DEMO dynamic
and reciprocal, and this has led to widespread use of DEMO data on behavior
in two-person systems. In principle, such data allow DEMO to separate the influences
of two actors on each other, Statistical DEMO currently being used, however,
are deficient in several respects. In DEMO article, we show that a statistic proposed
by Sackett and later "proved" by Gottman is incorrect. We also show that the
failure to control for autodependence can produce misleading results. Finally,
we introduce new DEMO that are based on both traditional and more recently
developed methods for the analysis of contingency tables. Using these procedures,
we show how DEMO test for dependency, how to measure dependency, how to test
for differences in dependency across subgroups, and how to test for dominance
in reciprocal behavior sequences.
Recent theoretical developments have
shifted research attention from static, cross-
sectional snapshots of social relationships to
dynamic, reciprocal models of interaction
sequences. For example, early work on child-
hood socialization viewed parent-child re-
lationships as static and unidirectional; par-
ents were thought to influence but not be
influenced by their children. An emerging
life-span perspective on child DEMO rec-
ognizes that parents affect, and are affected
by, their children in an evolving, reciprocal
relationship (Bell & Harper, 1977; Lerner
& Spanier, 1978). Similarly, marital rela-
tionships have been viewed primarily in
static terms that rely on concepts like rela-
tive power, role, and marital satisfaction.
John Gottman's pioneering work on Marital
Interaction (DEMO) is the first systematic
attempt to measure and characterize pat-
terns DEMO interaction sequences in distressed
and nondistressed couples. Gottman devel-
oped dynamic concepts to characterize com-
mon marital patterns such as positive and

negative reciprocity and marital dominance.
This theoretical shift from a static to a
dynamic framework has been accompanied
DEMO a shift in the kinds of data collected. In
particular, there DEMO been increased reliance
on sequential observation data (see Burgess
& Huston, 1979; Clarke-Stewart, 1973;
Gottman, 1980b; Mishler & Waxier, 1966;
Patterson, 1980; Schenkein, 1978; Wright,
1967) and on sophisticated methods for cod-
ing these data to capture both verbal and
DEMO behavior. Unfortunately, statisti-
cal expertise in analyzing these rich, care-
fully coded interaction sequences has not
kept pace with the development of the DEMO
ceptual apparatus and coding schemes. To
analyze his data, Gottman made DEMO
use of a statistic proposed by Sackett (1979)
and later DEMO rigorously by Gottman
(1979) himself. Unfortunately, both Gott-
man's DEMO and the original statistic are in
error. Even if the statistic were correct,
moreover, many of Gottman's applications
would still be problematic.
In this article we describe the problems
with Gottman's statistical methods, and we
propose alternative procedures based on re-
cently developed methods for DEMO analysis of
categorical data. These methods can be used
to estimate and test the degree of lagged
dependence of the behavior of one actor DEMO

the behavior of another. DEMO are also pro-
posed for determining whether one actor
dominates the other. Wherever possible, we
illustrate the methods with data reported by
Gottman (DEMO), and we compare our re-
sults with his.
(i.e., that H, and W, do not depend on their
own values at DEMO points in time). The
statistic he obtained is
z, =
DEMO ~ PH
(n - k)pw
A Test For Lagged Dependence
DEMO basic aim in the analysis of sequential
interaction data is to estimate and test for
lagged dependence in the behavior of the two
actors. DEMO us suppose that we observe the
behavior of a married couple at a sequence
of n points in time (t = I , . . . , «), and we
wish to test for the DEMO of the hus-
band's behavior at time t + k on the wife's
behavior at time t. We define the variables
//, and W, to indicate the husband's and the
wife's DEMO, respectively, and, for the
moment, we consider only the case in which
both variables are dichotomous, taking on
values of 1 or 0 at each point in time. Due
to the lag of k DEMO units, the data consist
of a set of pairs (W,, Hl+k) for t = 1,
..., « — k. Thus, the last k values of W
and the first k values of DEMO are not used in
the analysis.
Gottman (1979, 1980a, 1980b) argued
that the hypothesis of no dependence cor-
responds to the statement DEMO the condi-
tional probability of the husband's behavior
given the wife's behavior is the same as the
unconditional probability, that is,
which should have an asymptotically normal
distribution with a mean of zero DEMO a vari-
ance of one (a standard normal distribution).
Unfortunately, the denominator of this sta-
tistic is not the correct standard error DEMO the
numerator. It would be correct only if pH
were the true probability and not merely an
observed proportion subject to sampling er-
ror. DEMO can be shown that a correct statistic
is given by
z\ =
Pn\w~ PH
- Pw)
(n ~ k)pw
which does have, asymptotically, a standard
normal distribution. In more recent work,
Gottman (1980a) himself advocated the use
of Zi rather than zs.
It is apparent that this statistic is always
greater than Sackett's (1979) DEMO, spe-
cifically,
Pr[Hl+k= \\W,= \} = Pr(Hl+k = DEMO
The difference can be substantial. In one
analysis Gottman (1980b, p. 228) reported
pH = ,70, pmw = .76, and zs DEMO 1.57, which
is not significant at the .05 level (all signif-
icance levels mentioned here assume a two-
tailed test). Because pw DEMO .70, however, the
correct statistic is z\ = 2.87, which DEMO signif-
icant at beyond the .01 level.
The correct statistic z, DEMO happens to be
identically equal to two other statistics that
are much more familiar. One is the test of
a difference between two proportions DEMO
mated from two independent samples
(Blalock, 1979, pp. 232-234). DEMO we
divide the pairs (W,, Hl+!c) into two groups:
those in which W, = 1 and those in which
W, DEMO 0. We let mi be the number of times
that W, DEMO 1 and w0 be the number of times
that W, = DEMO Within each group we calculate
the proportion of times that //,DEMO = 1. These
To test this hypothesis, Gottman used a sta-
DEMO proposed by Sackett (1979). To discuss
this statistic, we need some additional no-
tation. Let pH\wand pH be the observed pro-
portions DEMO to the conditional
and unconditional probabilities in the null
hypothesis. That is, pmw is the proportion
of times that the husband s behavior is coded
1 given that the wife's behavior k units ear-
lier DEMO coded 1. Let pw be the proportion of
times that the wife's behavior is coded 1.
Sackett (1979) took the usual approach
DEMO constructing a z statistic by dividing the
difference between the observed proportions
Pmw ~ PH by the estimated standard error
of that difference, under the assumption that
there is no autodependence for H, and W,

two proportions are denoted bypHn andpH\0.
The DEMO statistic is then

m} mO
The equality of this statistic and the one
based on conditional and unconditional pro-
portions is DEMO in the Appendix. Intu-
itively, the reason they are equal is DEMO they
are testing exactly the same null hypothesis.
If the conditional probability is equal to the
unconditional probability, it necessarily fol-
lows that the two conditional probabilities
are equal to each other, that is,
Pr[Hl+k=
Conversely, if the two conditional probabil-
ities are equal, each of DEMO must equal the
unconditional probability.
A third statistic is obtained by viewing the
data as a 2 X 2 contingency table. For ex-
ample, for Gottman's data described above,
it is possible to reconstruct DEMO
the 2 X 2 table:

A natural way to test for dependence in DEMO
a table is to apply the usual Pearson's chi-
square statistic after first calculating ex-
pected values under the hypothesis of inde-
pendence. DEMO is well known (e.g., Fienberg,
1980; Kendall & Stuart, 1961) that Pear-
son's chi-square test for a 2 X 2 table is iden-
tically equal to the square of the z test DEMO
the difference between two proportions. For
these data X2 = 7.63 with a square root of
2.76 (the difference between this and the
previously calculated value of z, = 2.87 is
due to rounding error incurred by recon-
structing the table from the given propor-
tions). As DEMO shall see, the advantage of the
contingency table approach is that DEMO can be
easily generalized to more complicated sit-
uations.
A Measure of the Strength of
Lagged Dependence
We now have appropriate statistics for
testing DEMO null hypothesis that there is no
relationship between the wife's behavior at
time t and the husband's behavior at time
t + DEMO Suppose that the null hypothesis is
false,1 that the husband's behavior does in
some way depend on the wife's past behavior.
DEMO then needs some measure of the strength
of that dependence in order to make com-
parisons with other kinds of couples, other
experimental treatments, and so forth. In
essence, what is needed is a measure DEMO as-
sociation for a 2 X 2 table. Bishop, Fienberg,
& Holland (1975) reviewed the extensive
literature on this topic and concluded that
a key distinction is between those measures
that are sensitive to DEMO marginal totals and
those that are not. An example of a measure
that is sensitive to the marginal totals is the
difference between the DEMO and un-
conditional probabilities
Pr[Hl+k = 1\W, = I] - Pr[H,DEMO = 1],
which was proposed by Gottman (1980b, p.
31) to measure reduction in uncertainty.
Clearly, if the marginal probability
Pr[H,DEMO = 1] is very high or very low, the
range of DEMO difference is greatly restricted.
As a consequence, comparisons such as those
DEMO distressed couples with moderate
rates of negative behavior and nondistressed
couples with relatively low rates of negative
behavior may be questionable. The same
criticism DEMO to the difference between
the two conditional proportions:
= \\W,=
-Pr[Ht+k=
which is commonly used under the name
"percentage difference" (Davis, 1971).
A measure that is invariant to the mar-
ginal totals can be obtained by first taking
the logit transformation (Berkson, 1944;DEMO
Fienberg, 1980) of each of the two condi-
tional probabilities and then taking the dif-
ference. The logit transformation of a prob-
ability DEMO is just logit(p) = loge [p/(\ ~ p)] .
Thus, the measure we shall use here is de-
fined to be
396 PAUL D, ALLISON AN
= \Qgii[Pr(Hl+k =
- \ogit[Pr(Hl+/t =
It has a range of from minus infinity to plus
DEMO and is zero when the two variables
are independent.
The measure /? is better known in the sta-
tistical literature as the logarithm of the
cross-product ratio (or odds ratio). The rea-
son is that if the expected frequencies in a
2X 2 table ar e given DEMO y
F3 F4>
then jS = loge (F[F^/(F2F3). Moreover, if
fi are the observed frequencies in the 2X 2
table, the maximum likelihood estimator of
/? is just loge (/i/DEMO)/(/2/3). An alternative
way of expressing the definition DEMO /9 is
log(l[Pr(Hl+k = l\W,)] = a +
which may be thought of as a "logit-linear"
model. As we shall see, this form is conve-
nient for generalizing to additional vari-
ables.1
Comparing Dependency Levels
Across Groups
We turn now to the problem DEMO comparing
the degree of dependency across two or more
groups. Consider the contingency table in
Table 1, which is reconstructed (approxi-
mately) from data in Gottman's (1980b)
Table 12.5. The two groups are distressed
and nondistressed couples, and the aim is to
determine whether the dependence of the
wife's behavior on the husband's behavior
is DEMO for one group than for the other.
Gottman's approach is to compute Sackett's
z statistic within each group and then com-
pare DEMO statistics across groups. Using the
correct z statistic, we get a DEMO significant
3.26 for distressed couples and a nonsignif-
icant .51 for nondistressed couples, suggest-
ing that dependency is much stronger for the
former group.
There are two possible flaws in this pro-
cedure. One is that DEMO statistics are highly
sensitive to sample size. As a result, differ-

ences in sample size could produce major
differences in the test statistics for different
DEMO even when the degree of dependence
is identical. A second problem is that Gott-
man has no statistical test for the difference
between the DEMO statistics. It is well known
that one statistic can be highly significant
and another nonsignificant without there
being a significant difference between
the two.
DEMO difficulties can be avoided by test-
ing the null hypothesis that our measure of
association /3 is the same in each group.
When there are only two groups, the easiest
procedure is to estimate /3 DEMO each group,
take the difference between these estimates,
and divide by the standard error of the dif-
ference. This yields a z DEMO given by
Fienberg (1980, p. 37):

DEMO Those who are unfamiliar with /3 may find its values
somewhat DEMO to interpret, especially because it
ranges from minus infinity to plus DEMO An intuitive
interpretation is facilitated by focusing on exp (f!),
which is the odds ratio. In this context, the odds ratio
is interpreted as the odds that Hl+k = 1, given W, = DEMO,
divided by the odds that H,+t = 1, given DEMO, = 0. Thus,
if exp (/S) = 2, DEMO can say that the odds that H:+k =
1 are doubled by W, shifting from 0 to 1. Alternatively,
for those who prefer a measure that varies between
-1 and 1, a simple transformation of/ 3 produces Yule's

The /, are simply the eight observed cell fre-
quencies in the two 2X 2 tables. As _ex-
plained DEMO the previous section, each /3 is
computed by taking the logarithm of the
observed cross-product ratio in each table.

an asymptotic standard normal distribution.

which is not significant at the .05 level. Thus,
the evidence is insufficient to conclude that
there is a difference DEMO the two groups.
An alternative approach is especially use-
ful when there are more than two groups to
be compared. Instead of viewing the DEMO as
two two-way tables, we can treat them as a
single DEMO table with the additional
variable AT, which equals 1 for distressed DEMO
0 for nondistressed couples. The null hy-
pothesis can then be expressed as a logit-
linear model:
\Ogit[Pr(Wl+l = \\H,, X)DEMO = a + 0H, + yX.
The key feature of this DEMO is that there
is no interaction term for X and H,, express-
ing the fact that /3 is the same for both
groups. This model may be fit to the data
by the method of DEMO likelihood using
programs such as GLIM (Baker & Nelder,
1978)DEMO If a logit program is unavailable, one
can make use of DEMO fact that all logit models
for contingency tables are special cases of
log-linear models for which estimation pro-
grams are widely available (e.g., DEMO, MUL-
TIQUAL, FREQ). For this logit model, the
equivalent DEMO model is one that spec-
ifies no three-way interaction.
Once the model is fit, the hypothesis is
tested by comparing observed cell frequen-
cies to predicted frequencies using either
Pearson's chi-square statistic or the likeli-
DEMO chi-square statistic. For the data
in Table 1, Pearson's chi-square DEMO 2.235, and
the likelihood-ratio chi-square is 2.230, both
with one degree of freedom. These values
may be compared with the z test simply DEMO
taking the square root, which yields 1.495
and 1.493, respectively. Although all three
tests give virtually identical results in this
case, they are not identically equal. For one
thing, the z test cannot be computed when
any of the cell frequencies is zero, but this
does not necessarily prevent the logit-linear
model from being fit.
To compare more than DEMO groups, the
logit-linear model is modified to include a
dummy variable DEMO each of the groups less
one. Thus, if there are four DEMO, the
dummy variables could be X\ = 1 for Group
1 DEMO zero otherwise, X2 = 1 for Group 2
and zero otherwise, and X3 = 1 for Group
3 and zero otherwise. The model DEMO then fit
by the method of maximum likelihood and
the null hypothesis tested with either of the
two chi-square statistics. The number of de-
DEMO of freedom for these tests will be one
less than the number of groups. Again the
logit-linear model is equivalent to a log-lin-
ear DEMO with no three-way interaction.
This same approach offers the possibility
of estimating ft, the effect of the husband's
behavior on the wife's behavior, while sta-
tistically controlling for other variables. In-
deed, the /3 in the logit-linear equation above
is a partial /3 controlling for group member-
ship. If one has sequential data on many
different couples DEMO on such charac-
teristics as race, religious preference, or so-
cial class, one could construct a multiway
contingency table and fit logit-linear models
(or the equivalent log-linear models), which
include additional dummy variables to rep-
resent the other characteristics.
Using a somewhat different fitting pro-
cedure (Hanushek & Jackson, 1977; Ner-
love & Press, 1973), one can even include
control variables such as age, income, or
years DEMO schooling, which are measured as
continua. The resulting analysis is very DEMO
like the analysis of covariance. Finally, one
can adjust for all DEMO between couples

by pooling all the data for all DEMO but
including a dummy variable for each couple
(less one), DEMO procedure that Gottman (1980b)
recommended in a somewhat different con-
DEMO
The Problem of Autodependence
All of the tests discussed so far assume
that an actor's behavior at any time does not
depend on DEMO same actor's behavior at any
previous time (i.e., there is no autodepend-
ence). This assumption makes it possible to
treat each DEMO of observations (H,, W,+k) as
though it were independent of all other pairs
from the same couple. Although this greatly
simplifies DEMO construction of statistical tests,
it is obviously not very realistic. Moreover,
the violation of this assumption can produce
very misleading results.
Consider, for example, the data in Table
2, which gives frequencies for DEMO three-way
cross-classification of H,, W,, and W,+i.2
Suppose we wish to test for the dependence
of W,+i on H,. DEMO the procedures
given earlier, we can test for dependence by
first DEMO the table over W, to get the
H, X Wl+i table and then computing a chi-
square test for independence. The Pearson
chi-square DEMO this collapsed table is a highly
significant 27.64 with one degree of freedom,
and the estimated value of /3 is .404. This
test fails to take account of the fact that both
H, and WM are strongly associated with W,,
which may be seen by looking at the W, X
WM table and the W, X H, table. The former
collapsed table has an enormous chi-square
of 1,184.7, whereas the latter has a chi-
square of 62.35 (both on one degree of free-
dom). These interrelationships suggest that
the apparent dependence DEMO WIJr\ on H, may

be DEMO consequence of the fact that both of
these variables depend on W,. To rule out
this possibility, we can estimate and test the
effect of H, on Wl+1 controlling for W,.
There are several equivalent ways to do
this, but all require analysis of the full three-
way table. The null hypothesis can be ex-
pressed as
Pr[Wl+l DEMO \\W,, H,] = Pr[W,+ l = 1 W,]
for all values of W, and H,. In essence, this
DEMO that W,+[ may depend on W, but not
on H,DEMO The easiest way to test this hypothesis
is to treat Table 2 as two 2X 2 tables, one
table for each value of W,. The test is per-
formed by computing a chi-square test for
DEMO in each of these subtables and
then summing the two values. For these
data, the resulting Pearson chi-square is 5.91
with two degrees of freedom — not quite sig-
nificant at the .05 level. Thus, when the au-
todependence is partialed out, the cross-de-
pendence is greatly attenuated.3
Again, an alternative approach is to fit a
logit-linear model by maximum likelihood
methods. In this case, the null hypothesis is
expressed by the model
\o&i[Pr(Wt+l = \\Wn H,}} .= a +
If DEMO's chi-square is used to evaluate
the fit of this model, DEMO result will be iden-
2 These data are taken from Coleman (DEMO, p. 168).
For consistency with the rest of the article, the variables
have been labeled H, and Wn but actually these refer
to variables measuring "membership in the leading
crowd" and "attitude toward membership in the leading
crowd" at two different times.
3 This test has been criticized for lack of power (Coch-
ran, 1954). DEMO more powerful test having a single degree
of freedom was proposed by Mantel and Haenszel
(1959) and is described by Bishop et al. (1975). An
alternative test with one degree of freedom is described
DEMO Footnote 4. Both of these tests assume that H, and
W, do not interact in their effects on W,+, (i.e., the effect
of H, on WHt is the same at both levels of W,). Before
applying either of these tests, one should test DEMO inter-
action using the methods described above for comparing
dependency levels across groups (here the two groups
correspond to W, = 1 and DEMO, = 0). The z2 statistic for
these data is 2.39, suggesting that there is an interaction,
and, hence, the single DEMO of freedom tests are in-
appropriate.

tical to the test described above.4 The DEMO
vantage of this approach is that it can handle
much more complicated forms of autode-
pendence. For example, we could allow for
autodependence up to lag 3 by fitting the
model
= l\HH Wn W,.lt DEMO,-2}}
to the five-way table for Wl+l, W,, W,^, W,-2,
and H,. The hypothesis that W,+\ does DEMO
depend on H, is then equivalent to the null
hypothesis that DEMO, = 0. Gottman (1980a)
suggested even more complicated models for
interval-level data; completely analogous
models for categorical data can be estimated
by the methods outlined here. For futher
details of the fitting and testing DEMO,
see Goodman (1970), Bishop et al. (1975),
DEMO (1980), or Haberman (1978).5
Testing for Dominance
Gottman (DEMO) gave the following def-
inition of dominance: "In a dyad, if B's fu-
ture behavior is more predictable from A's
DEMO behavior than conversely, then A is said
to be dominant" (DEMO 71). To test for domi-
nance, Gottman used a procedure DEMO was
based on spectral analysis, which unfortu-
nately did not control DEMO autodependence.
He has, however, since proposed a method
suitable for interval-level data that does con-
trol for autocorrelation (Gottman & Ring-
land, DEMO). We now describe an analogous
method for categorical data.
A naive approach would be to compute a
z test for the dependence of DEMO on W, and
another z test for the dependence of W,DEMO on
H,. If one test statistic is substantially larger
than the other, it could be taken as evidence
for dominance. As we have seen earlier, how-
ever, the fact that two test statistics differ
DEMO not imply that the strength of the de-
pendence is significantly stronger in one di-
rection than in the other. What is needed is
DEMO single statistical test for the difference be-
tween the measures of association for each
relationship. Of course, it is also necessary
to introduce appropriate controls for the
lagged dependence of each spouse's behavior
on his DEMO her own prior behavior. As we shall
see, proper controls can DEMO reverse the
direction of dominance.

Suppose DEMO for a sample of 100 couples
we observe behavior at two times. Thus, we
observe H{, H2, Wlt and W2. As shown in
Table 3, the data can be displayed as a four-
way contingency table. These data were con-
structed for illustrative purposes, but there
is no reason why similar data could not arise
in real life.
Ignoring DEMO autodependence, we first test
for cross-dependence of H2 on W\ and DEMO W2
on H{. To do this, we collapse the four-way
table DEMO two two-way tables and then com-
pute Pearson's chi-square test for indepen-
dence in each table. For H2 on W\ the chi-
square DEMO 270.4; for W2 on HI the chi-square
is 350.5, suggesting that the husband is dom-
inant. This is corroborated by the fact that
DEMO = 2.305 for H2 on W\ as compared with
|3 = 2.723 for W2 on //,. The difference be-
tween these statistics may be tested using
the same test we employed to compare dis-
tressed DEMO nondistressed couples:6
4 A more powerful test is obtained by first fitting this
model and then fitting the model
The test statistic is DEMO the difference between the like-
lihood-ratio chi-squares for these two models, DEMO a
single degree of freedom. As explained in Footnote 3,
this test assumes that there is no interaction between
H, and W, DEMO their effects on W,+1.
5 The full justification of these methods requires that
the sequential data be generated by a stationary Markov
chain. DEMO underlying statistical theory is discussed by
Anderson and Goodman (1957) or in greater detail by
Billingsley (1961).
6 In this context, DEMO is not strictly appropriate because
it presumes that the two estimates of fl are uncorrelated.
This is unlikely to be the case because both DEMO estimated
from the same sample. If the correlation is positive
(which DEMO the most plausible case), z2 will be lower than
the "DEMO" z statistic. Hence, it may be regarded as a
conservative test.

Because this is not quite significant at the
.05 level, the evidence is only marginal for
husband dominance.
This analysis ignores the fact that there
is substantial autodependence for the wife's
DEMO and even stronger autodependence
for the husband's behavior. To partial out
this autodependence, we apply the tech-
niques described in the preceding section.
We first analyze the three-way table U\ X
W\ X HI to DEMO the logit-linear model:
This can be interpreted as a structural model
for the dependence of the husband's behavior
on the wife's DEMO on the husband's own pre-
vious behavior. Next, we estimate DEMO cor-
responding table for the HiXWtX W2 table:
logit[Pr(W2 = l\Hlt W,)}
The appropriate comparison is between /8,
and /3f, which are the two measures of cross-
dependence, controlling for DEMO
These equations were estimated using the
program GLIM (Baker & Nelder, 1978), and
the estimates are displayed as a path dia-
gram (Goodman, 1973) in Figure 1. With
the introduction of controls the DEMO of
dominance is reversed, with estimates for /3
of 2.265 for wives on husbands and 1.443 for
husbands on wives. But is this DEMO sig-
nificant? Gillespie (Note 1) presents one
method of testing DEMO the significance of the
difference, but a simple method is available
DEMO the computer program provides standard
errors for each of the estimated parameters.7
For this example, the estimated standard
error of j3{ is s = .183. For /3f we have s* =
.240. The test statistic is
]/s2 + J*2
2.265 - 1.443
V(.183) 2 + (DEMO):

which is significant at beyond DEMO .01 level.
We conclude that wives are dominant over
husbands for these data.
Polytomous Data
So far we have assumed that sequential
behavior is DEMO as a dichotomy. There will
often, however, be more than two categories,
and Gottman (1980b) typically dealt with
three: positive (DEMO), neutral (0), and negative
(-1). His general strategy was to do two
separate analyses, one focusing on "positive
reciprocity" Pr[ W,+k = 1 \H, = 1 ] and the
other focusing on "negative reciprocity"
Pr[W,+k = -\\H, = -1]. DEMO course, these
two analyses are not independent, and if the
neutral category is small they will be almost
mirror images.
We believe that DEMO better strategy is to do
a simultaneous analysis of all three catego-
ries after which one can test more refined
hypotheses. This is easily DEMO,
often by quite conventional methods for an-
alyzing contingency tables. Suppose, for ex-
ample, that both the husband's and the
wife'DEMO behavior is coded by the three-cate-
gory scheme just mentioned, and DEMO aim is
to test for dependence of the husband's be-
havior at time t + k on the wife's behavior
at time DEMO If we ignore autodependence, the
null hypothesis may be expressed as
DEMO = i\W, = J] = Pr[ffl+k = i]
for i = DEMO, 0, 1 and for j = -1, 0, 1. This
hypothesis can be tested by forming the 3 X
3 contingency table DEMO applying the stan-
dard chi-square test for independence. To
determine whether the degree of dependence
differs across different groups (e.g., dis-
tressed and DEMO couples), the best
approach is to fit the appropriate log-linear
model to the three-way contingency table
and then test the goodness of fit. DEMO log-
1 Both of these methods suffer from the difficulty dis-
cussed in Footnote 6: They ignore the fact that ft and
/3* DEMO likely to be positively correlated. As a conse-
quence, the test DEMO will be biased downward.

linear model should exclude the three-way
interaction term, and, as usual, the fit may
be evaluated using either Pearson'DEMO chi-
square or the likelihood-ratio chi-square.
These tests do not, however, tell anything
about the direction and form of the depen-
dency of DEMO on W,. For that, it is useful
to convert the DEMO model for the con-
tingency table into its equivalent logit-linear
form. There are several ways to "parame-
terize" the polytomous logit-linear model,
DEMO for the three-category case we favor the
following expression. Let W(+) = 1 if W, =
1 and zero otherwise, and let W(-) = -1 if
W, = — 1 and zero DEMO The model then
consists of two equations:
log. Pr[Hl+k=
Pr[Hl+k=Q\W,]}
loge
0.07
*-H5
The first equation describes the effects of W
on DEMO H is positive or neutral, and the
second equation describes the DEMO of W
on whether H is neutral or negative. These
effects are represented by four /? coefficients.
Each of these coefficients corresponds to the
logarithm of the odds ratio in one of the 2 X
2 DEMO formed by deleting one extreme row
and one extreme column from the 3 X 3
table.
Within this framework, one can test hy-
potheses of the following sort. With respect
to the wife's behavior, one might hypothesize
that the effect of going from negative to neu-
tral DEMO the same as going from neutral to
positive. This hypothesis is equivalent to as-
suming that j8n = fin in the first equation
and &i = 1822 in the second. Similarly, with
respect to the husband's behavior, one might
hypothesize that the difference between neg-
ative and neutral is the same as the differ-
ence between neutral and positive. DEMO
amounts to hypothesizing that j8n = j821 and
1812 = $22- If both hypotheses are true, one
has the uniform association model of Dun-
can (1979) for ordered categorical data.
Haberman (1979) described methods DEMO
testing these hypotheses. Just as in the di-
chotomous case, the DEMO for polytomous
variables can be easily extended to allow for
more complicated lag structures and for ad-
ditional control variables. Finally, if the se-
quential behavior is coded on a continuous
or nearly continuous scale, one can use stan-
dard procedures for the analysis of multi-
variate time-series DEMO that have been de-
veloped by econometricians (see, e.g.,
Maddala, 1977) and that have been recently
advocated by Gottman and Ringland (1981).
Conclusion
The statistical procedures described here
can be used to DEMO the kinds of propositions
advanced by Gottman (1980b) as well as
many other common propositions in the
study of social interaction. They can DEMO ap-
plied to data on a small number of couples
followed over many time points or many cou-
ples followed through as few as DEMO time
points. The advantages of these procedures
over those used by Gottman are essentially
threefold: (a) They explicitly take into ac-
count the categorical nature of the data; (b)
402
PAUL D. ALLISON AND JEFFREY K. LIKER
they allow for multivariate DEMO opposed to
merely bivariate analysis; and (c) they con-
form DEMO conventional practices for statistical
inference.
The implications for Gottman's (1980b)DEMO
substantive conclusions are unclear. In a few
instances where Gottman presented suffi-
cient data for reanalysis, we were able to
show that the use of more appropriate meth-
ods could lead to different conclusions. In
most DEMO, however, reanalysis was impos-
sible, so we have no way DEMO knowing how
serious the biases are. On the one hand, the
DEMO of Sackett's (1979) incorrect statistic
would tend to result in acceptance of the null
hypothesis when, in fact, it could be DEMO
On the other hand, the failure to test ex-
plicitly for DEMO significance of differences
between groups is likely to result in con-
cluding that a difference exists when there
is actually insufficient evidence for a DEMO
tically reliable difference.
Given the importance of the hypotheses
and the apparent high quality of the data,
we hope that further analyses will DEMO un-
dertaken to answer these questions. Without
appropriate statistical procedures, even DEMO
most elaborately coded data and carefully
controlled collection procedures will not fur-
ther our understanding of social interaction.
