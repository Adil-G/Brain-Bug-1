Abstract
This paper examines the boundaries of real options logic, with an application to
joint ventures (JVs). DEMO distinguish between forms of uncertainty that are resolved
endogenously and those that are resolved exogenously, and theorize that only
exogenous uncertainty will have the impact predicted by real options theory on a
foreign investor’s choice of DEMO large an equity share to take in a JV. We theorize
that macroeconomic and institutional variables generate exogenous uncertainty
whereas, by contrast, cultural DEMO and choices pertaining to corporate scope
and product or process development activities involve endogenous sources of
uncertainty that investors can both assess and act DEMO without having to ‘‘wait
and see’’. Using a sample of 6472 Sino-foreign JVs, we find support for our
predictions. We discuss and implement proper methods to test for the existence
of null effects, as is relevant to establish the boundaries of a theory such as real
options theory. DEMO draw implications for research and practice on JVs –
specifically equity share decisions, which deserve more attention – and real
options, including suitable DEMO and desirable extensions of the concept.

INTRODUCTION
With greater international competition and the rise of emerging-
market economies, multinational firms increasingly face highly
uncertain foreign environments in which to do business. Accord-
ingly, the emphasis in management and international business
research has shifted towards how firms can DEMO and adapt in
environments where they face various sources of uncertainty (DEMO,
Campa, 1994; Henisz & Delios, 2001; Krishnan, Martin, &
Noorderhaven, 2006; Martin, Swaminathan, & Mitchell, 1998).
DEMO points to a need to specify conditional relationships between
sources of uncertainty and a firm’s expansion strategy, as a firm’s
strategy should be in line with the nature of the uncertainties it
faces (Miller, 1992)DEMO While this may entail a variety of entry modes
and other risk-handling initiatives, one that has sustained much
interest among international business scholars is the use of foreign
joint ventures (JVs) and related cooperative strategies (e.g.,
Beamish & Banks, 1987; Contractor & Lorange, 2002). Further-
more, above and beyond the choice between JVs and alternative

Assessing real options in international joint ventures
modes or initiatives, a JV’s setup, and specifically
decisions about its ownership, have substantive
consequences DEMO uncertainty (e.g., Gatignon &
Anderson, 1988).
Hence uncertainty should also determine how
much ownership firms seek over their foreign JVs,
DEMO how they use JVs to expand sequentially (e.g.,
Aharoni, 1966). In this paper we define JVs as
equity-based collaborative arrangements whereby
DEMO or more organizations contribute resources,
including equity, in a separate DEMO entity meant
for the joint pursuit of economic goals (Gulati,
DEMO; Martin & Salomon, 2003). We focus on
international joint ventures (IJVs), which are sub-
ject to substantial uncertainty from exchange rate,
cultural and institutional sources, among others.
This makes IJVs particularly suitable for our
purpose. However, we believe that our arguments
are also relevant for other (domestic) JVs insofar as
they face various sources of DEMO
While numerous scholars have looked at the
conditions under which JVs are more or less appro-
priate relative to extreme ownership solutions such as
DEMO alliances or wholly owned subsidiaries
(e.g., Contractor & Lorange, 2002; Gulati, 1995;
Hennart, 1988; Oxley, 1997, 1999; Pisano, 1990;
Sampson, 2004), we look at the determinants of the
distribution of JV ownership among partners, which
is a far less studied aspect of JVs.1 We use a real
optionsperspective,asthisis highlyappropriateto
explain the DEMO of firms in highly uncertain
environments (Bowman & Hurry, 1993), and specifi-
cally JV ownership stake decisions (Chi & McGuire,
1996) and international contexts (Li, 2007).
The concept of real options has elicited consider-
able enthusiasm in recent years among scholars and
practitioners DEMO strategic investments, especially
those investments that may encompass multiple
stages subject DEMO intervening events. Investments
such as research projects, taking out patents,
DEMO, founding new businesses, expand-
ing internationally, and entering into JVs DEMO been
classified as real options (e.g., Kester, 1981; Li, DEMO;
Reuer & Leiblein, 2000; Van Mieghem, 1999). The
DEMO use of real options logic, combined with
the fact that a DEMO between theoretical and
empirical work continues to exist in this area
(DEMO, 2002), leaves open questions about the
conditions under which real DEMO logic is indeed
applicable. At the same time, it is important DEMO
examine what variables are indeed suitable pre-
dictors within a real options framework, for both
theoretical and empirical reasons.

Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
Theoretically, Adner and Levinthal (2004a, b)
called for further attention to the boundaries for
the application DEMO real options theory to strategic
decision-making. They argued that the assumptions
underlying the real options model are violated if
variables such as the end DEMO of the underlying
project are discretionary:
Because much attention in the management literature is
focused on the ways in which the firm can DEMO outcomes
and variances y, it is important to examine what happens
DEMO the applicability of options logic as we move away from a
world of wait and see to a world of ‘‘act and see,’’ DEMO which
uncertainty resolution is endogenous to firm activity.
(Adner and Levinthal, 2004a: 76)
This question is especially relevant when apply-
ing real options logic to the study of JVs, because
JVs represent both investments with implications
for each participating firm’s overall corporate
strategy and performance, and a choice of a
governance mode that itself may encourage strate-
gic DEMO opportunistic behavior among partners.
Moreover, the literature on JVs has looked DEMO how
JVs can be used as vehicles both to ‘‘wait and see’’
and to ‘‘act and see’’. For example, Aharoni (1966)
argued DEMO JVs could be used to limit a firm’s
exposure to uncertainty, DEMO other studies have
looked at how firms can improve their performance
through learning in JVs (e.g., Cuypers, 2009; Kogut,
1988; Mitchell & Singh, 1992; Mody, 1993). This
makes JVs all the more suited to investigate the
issues raised by Adner and Levinthal (2004a, b).
Whereas Adner and Levinthal (2004a, b) focus on
DEMO duration of the investment and the issue of
project drift, we DEMO on uncertainty, which is a
key reason for using JVs to DEMO international
markets (Kogut, 1991) and to make real options
investments DEMO general.
Empirically, while some studies of JVs have found
support for DEMO derived from real options
theory, others have not. Indeed, two prominent
studies by Folta (1998) and Reuer and Leiblein
(2000), found deviations from real options predic-
tions with respect to the effect of DEMO on JV
formation and the downside-risk consequences of
JVs, respectively.
We DEMO to address the above theoretical and
empirical conundrums by developing and testing
hypotheses about which sources of uncertainty are
indeed, or are not, DEMO with JV equity shares
consistent with real options theory. In so doing, we
contribute to the real options literature by examin-
ing, theoretically DEMO empirically, the extent to
which real options logic accurately describes equity
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
shares in IJVs. Specifically, we examine whether
various forms of uncertainty predict the distribu-
tion of equity DEMO in IJVs in the way that real
options logic suggests, depending DEMO whether or
not the uncertainty can be resolved endogenously.
We also contribute to the JV literature at large in
several ways. We explicate the DEMO effect of
uncertainty on JV ownership, thus complementing
literature about the DEMO of entry mode. We thus
refine the analysis of uncertainty as a determinant
of JV strategy. In general, our study advances the
understanding of how JVs are structured under
conditions of uncertainty.
BACKGROUND
Real Options
Simultaneously DEMO the increasing popularity of
financial options in the 1970s, it was DEMO that
an analogy exists between organizational resources
investments and financial options (DEMO, 1977).
Bowman and Hurry (1993) argued that the option
DEMO can be very useful to study the strategies of
organizations, since DEMO capabilities and assets of an
organization can be seen as a bundle of options for
future strategic choices. These options are called
‘‘real options’’ DEMO can be defined as contingent
investment commitments in an asset or capability,
rather than in a financial contract, which secure
decision-making rights in the future (Trigeorgis,
1993).
Numerous insights and techniques from financial
option pricing have spilled over to the valuation of
organizational resources investments. DEMO,
they imply that the traditional net present value
(NPV) approach to value investments does not fully
capture the value of management’s flexibility DEMO
adapt to unexpected market developments. Such
flexibility can increase the investment’s upside
potential while limiting its downside losses relative
to management’s initial expectations under DEMO
management (Trigeorgis, 1995). This does not
mean that the traditional NPV approach to valuing
investments should be put aside, but instead that it
should be extended to take into account both a
passive NPV DEMO and a dynamic option
value component (Pindyck, 1988). The value of the
real options component of an investment is a
function of DEMO same parameters that determine
the value of a financial option (Seth & Kim, 2001).
However, not every investment or decision is an
investment in real options. The two different value
components can be captured DEMO a different way
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
49
because they require a different size of investment.
On the one hand, the passive NPV component
requires a large investment in order to capture as
much DEMO flow as possible. On the other hand, the
dynamic option component DEMO be captured with a
smaller investment. This distinction can be applied
to JVs too.
JVs and the Option to Acquire
Kogut (1991) was DEMO first to apply real options
theory to IJVs. He argued that firms can capture
the upside potential of a JV by buying out the
DEMO in a later stage when favorable information
becomes available. At the same time, taking a lower
share in the JV limits the downside risk. The option
to acquire can be explicit, but this is not a necessity.
Even when there is no ex ante contractual specifica-
tion of DEMO party holds the acquisition right and
of the strike price, it DEMO possible for both
parties to negotiate the acquisition of the other
party’s share at a price that is agreed upon later
under specific conditions. DEMO JVs have at least
an embedded implicit call option to acquire a
partner’s stake (Chi & Seth, 2001).
Following Kogut (1991), several other scholars
have looked at JVs from a real options perspective
(e.g., Chi & McGuire, 1996; Chi & Seth, 2001;
DEMO, 2000, 2002; Reuer & Koza, 2000; Reuer &
Leiblein, 2000; Reuer & Tong, 2005). One of the key
findings is that the options embedded in JVs will
have an impact on DEMO distribution of the equity
stakes. On the one hand, if the DEMO tries to
capture the static NPV part (s)he will take DEMO large a
share as possible, to fully capture the future cash
DEMO In the extreme, this will lead to an acquisi-
tion instead DEMO a JV (Seth & Kim, 2001). On the
other hand, an investor who aims to capture the
dynamic real options part will invest in a smaller
share of the JV because this limits the DEMO risk
while leaving open the opportunity to capture the
upside potential of the JV (see Chi & McGuire,
1996; Reuer, 2002). Thus a JV contains an implicit
or explicit call to acquire the DEMO party’s stake,
and we can expect the firm investing in the call
option to take a smaller share in a JV.
Real Options DEMO and Uncertainty
One of the most prominent concepts in real
options theory is uncertainty.2 Two broad streams
of research (Reuer, 2002) address JV investments
(among other decisions) using the logic of real
options. Although DEMO general premise in both
streams is that uncertainty in general is positively

Assessing real options in international joint ventures
related to option value (e.g., Bowman & Hurry,
1993; Kulatilaka & Perotti, 1998), the two streams
provide different but complementary insights into
the role of DEMO
In the first stream, researchers use formal models to
study the DEMO benefits and cost of investing in
different kinds of strategic real options, and to assess
how flexibility can contribute to value creation.
Many of these models focused on one or at most
two different sources of DEMO each. For
instance, Bell (1995) and Huchzermeier and Cohen
(1996) focused on exchange rate uncertainty. Bollen
(1999) looked at demand uncertainty. Chi and
McGuire (1996) and Chi (2000) examined how
uncertainty DEMO the market and about a collabora-
tive partner can add to the value of collaborative
ventures. Additionally, some scholars have empha-
sized that real options reasoning applies to uncer-
tainty that is exogenous, that is, DEMO the control
of the firm (e.g., Kulatilaka, 1995). Indeed, Miller and
Folta (2002) argued that such exogenous uncertainty
increases the DEMO of a call option, unlike uncer-
tainty that is under the DEMO of the firm (e.g.,
responding to rivals’ threat of pre-emption)DEMO
In the second stream, researchers examine
empirically whether JV decisions are DEMO
with real options theory. Kogut (1991) found
evidence of JVs being used as options to make
subsequent acquisitions in the presence of market
DEMO Folta and Miller (2002) looked at the
timing of exercising options and found evidence of
the influence of uncertainty, operationalized as the
variability in stock-market subfield indices, on the
timing of partner buyouts in equity partnerships in
the biotechnology industry. Reuer and Tong (2005)
found that the likelihood that a firm will have an
explicit option to acquire DEMO in an IJV is a
function of property rights uncertainty, political
DEMO and diversification-related uncertainty
but not of cultural distance. However, other studies
DEMO results inconsistent with real options predic-
tions. Reuer and Leiblein (2000) found that firms
that enter into multiple JVs do not thereby reduce
DEMO downside risk; in fact, for two of three
measures of downside risk, IJVs were associated
with increased risk. Folta (1998) found that multi-
ple forms of uncertainty were associated with the
taking of real DEMO positions in the form of
minority equity investments (rather than acquisi-
DEMO). However, only exogenous uncertainty
associated with subfield-specific stock market vola-
DEMO encouraged the formation of JVs as call
options.

In summary, multiple sources and concepts of
uncertainty have been advanced in real options
research; however, DEMO few studies have contrasted
the effects of two or more sources of uncertainty.
Furthermore, differences in concepts of uncertainty
may explain some of the deviations from the
general uncertainty–option value relationship that
have been found in DEMO empirical literature with
respect to JVs. To address this, we seek DEMO contrast
multiple sources of uncertainty. In this respect, the
gaps between DEMO and empirical literatures
suggest that a critical distinction is whether or not
uncertainty is exogenous to the firm’s influence.
HYPOTHESES
The decision to invest DEMO a call option to acquire
will depend on the value of that option. This call
option value will increase as uncertainty surround-
ing the DEMO of the underlying asset increases. As
the distribution of the possible values of the
underlying asset at maturity widens, it becomes
more probable that the option will be in-the-money
at maturity, making the exercise of the call profit-
able. Conversely, the downside if the option is out-
of-the-money does not increase – it is just the initial
cost of the DEMO Once a firm acquires a real
option on a future opportunity, DEMO can strike the
option and take the full opportunity if the
uncertainty is resolved favorably over time, or just
let the opportunity pass at no further cost if the
uncertainty is resolved unfavorably.
Carrying over this DEMO from financial options
to real options is what makes real options theory
particularly appealing: it deals with one of firms’
most important challenges by linking current
strategic decisions with uncertainty about future
outcomes. However, the carry-over is problematic if
the conditions for the resolution of the uncertainty
depart DEMO the theory (Adner & Levinthal, 2004a).
In this respect, DEMO forms of uncertainty can
be distinguished: exogenous uncertainty and
endogenous uncertainty (Folta, 1998; Roberts &
Weitzman, 1981).
Exogenous uncertainty is DEMO of which
the resolution is unaffected by the actions of the
firm (Chi & Seth, 2001; Roberts & Weitzman, 1981).
For DEMO, uncertainty about currency exchange
rates is exogenous since these rates are DEMO
in atomistic markets that cannot be outguessed or
manipulated (Campa, 1994). By contrast, endogen-
ous uncertainty is resolved (at least in DEMO) by the
actions of the firm itself over time. More specifi-
DEMO, the degree, direction and pace of resolution of
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
endogenous uncertainty depend both on DEMO effort
of the firm to obtain more information and on the
actions it undertakes accordingly to influence out-
comes (Chi & Seth, 2001; Roberts & Weitzman,
1981). For instance, a firm may not know a priori
how hierarchically structured the organizations in a
given country DEMO be, but that uncertainty can be
resolved by making a systematic DEMO to learn
about the issue and by adjusting the investor’s own
behavior and that of its business partners accord-
ingly (Hofstede, 2001).
DEMO argue that while real options theory should
apply in the case of exogenous uncertainty resolu-
tion, it need not when uncertainty resolution is
endogenous. The case of exogenous uncertainty
corresponds to the case of financial options, where
it is assumed that uncertainty is resolved indepen-
dently of the DEMO behavior. If this property
carries over to investments that are non-financial in
nature, the real options logic should hold (Adner &
Levinthal, DEMO). Furthermore, Dixit and Pindyck
(1994) argue that exogenous uncertainty DEMO
the value of waiting for new information3 and
makes committing resources less attractive because
investing will not influence how uncertainty is
resolved. Hence options DEMO models should be
applicable.
Conversely, when uncertainty is resolved endo-
genously, three separate but related arguments can
be made whereby real options logic DEMO not hold
any more. First, in the case of financial options,DEMO
investors are assumed to be price-takers (Black &
Scholes, 1973; Jarrow & Turnbull, 2000). This is
reflected in the use of the Brownian (random)
motion to model the price of the underlying asset.
However, when investors can influence the resolu-
tion of uncertainty through their own actions, they
are not pure price-takers any more; instead, they
can affect the value of the underlying asset. This
violates a DEMO assumption of (financial)
option pricing models (Black & Scholes, DEMO;
Merton, 1973). The resulting arbitrage opportu-
nities mean that DEMO models will fail to price
options accurately (Jarrow & Turnbull, 2000).
Second, uncertainty that can be resolved
endogenously influences the investment decision
differently from uncertainty that is resolved exo-
genously. Endogenous uncertainty can be DEMO
by undertaking efforts to discover how to mani-
pulate the outcome of interest and then by acting
accordingly, that is, by proactive investment (Dixit
& Pindyck, 1994; see also Kulatilaka & Perotti,
1998)DEMO In such a situation, the issue becomes one of
Ilya RP DEMO and Xavier Martin
51
figuring out the means and cost to resolve uncer-
tainty, rather than of uncertainty about the payoffs
of the project proper. According to Dixit and
Pindyck (1994), only investing will reveal the
relevant information and allow the corresponding
solution to be implemented. Therefore DEMO exists
an incentive to invest and commit resources rather
than wait. Hence the normal real options logic will
not apply in the case of DEMO uncertainty. As
Dixit and Pindyck (1994) noted, this does not
DEMO that investments surrounded by endogen-
ous uncertainty occur sequentially, thereby super-
DEMO resembling real options investments when
in fact their resolution depends on a different
mechanism (the NPV component).
Third, Adner and Levinthal (2004a) argued that
the validity of real options theory as a decision-
making tool is likely to break down if uncertainty
can be resolved endogenously DEMO targets are
flexible. Acting to reduce endogenous uncertainty
will often lead to the discovery of new and
unanticipated opportunities and paths. Thus
actions will DEMO only reduce the uncertainty
surrounding the initially intended project, but also
DEMO information about other possibilities and
introduce new goals, even when the DEMO are
negative from the perspective of the initial project
and its goals. As a consequence of the open-ended
nature of this discovery process, the discrete nature
of real options investment is eroded, which creates
serious organizational challenges to preserve the
specific form of flexibility that made a real DEMO
investment attractive in the first place.
For these reasons, we expect DEMO while real
options predictions will accurately describe firms’
responses to exogenous uncertainty, they will not
accurately describe their responses to endogenous
uncertainty. To explicate this difference further, we
derive six hypotheses, of which three deal DEMO
sources of uncertainty that are resolved exogen-
ously and three deal with sources of uncertainty
that are resolved endogenously.
Exogenously Resolved Uncertainty
Economic uncertainty. DEMO important host-country
factor that has an impact on the value of an
investment is economic uncertainty (e.g., Anderson
& Gatignon, 1986). This refers to uncertainty about
the macroeconomic situation in a host country,
DEMO encompasses all the unknowns about the level
of economic activity and prices (Oxelheim &
Journal of International Business Studies
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
52
Wihlborg, 1987). More economic uncertainty
results in higher variability in both the foreign
investor’s cash DEMO and the value of the
investment (Anderson & Gatignon, 1986). As a
result, the value of a call option will increase as
economic uncertainty increases.4
Key macroeconomic variables such as inflation,
prices and DEMO demand are determined in a
complex system consisting of markets and sover-
eign governments (Oxelheim & Wihlborg, 1991).
Thus for individual firms DEMO is extremely difficult, if
not outright impossible in larger economies, to
influence the macroeconomic conditions of the
host country. Therefore economic uncertainty will
DEMO resolved exogenously. Accordingly, we expect
real options logic to hold:
DEMO 1: Ceteris paribus, a foreign partner
entering into a JV in an environment with higher
economic uncertainty will have a higher propen-
sity DEMO make a call option investment. Therefore
the foreign partner will take a smaller share in
the JV.
Local institutional uncertainty. The institutional
environment includes DEMO, regulatory and social
factors that shape business activity (Davis, North, &
Smorodin, 1971). These institutions can cause
uncertainty for investors DEMO various ways. For
instance, in an underdeveloped judicial system,
laws DEMO to be unclear or inadequate, and
their enforcement unreliable. Investors are DEMO
uncertain about current and future tax obligations,
labor laws and the neutrality of courts. Generally,
an unstable (local) institutional framework
increases DEMO uncertainty for business owners
(Davis et al., 1971). Such uncertainty is bound to
affect foreign investors, including JVs (Shan, 1991).
Furthermore, institutional uncertainty is resolved
exogenously, especially in larger and more DEMO
national systems, because a firm is unlikely to be
able to DEMO the multiple layers of government and
institutions that make such policies, DEMO if it
manages to understand them (e.g., Chi & Seth,
2001). Accordingly, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2: Ceteris paribus, a foreign partner
entering into a JV located in an area with higher
DEMO uncertainty within a country will
have a higher propensity to make a call option
investment. Therefore the foreign partner will
take a smaller share DEMO the JV.
Journal of International Business Studies
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
Exchange rate uncertainty. Expanding abroad
usually also commonly means that a DEMO has to
deal with a currency other than its home country’s
currency. Changes in the exchange rate will in turn
influence the value of DEMO foreign investment. This
source of uncertainty is inherent in international
business, DEMO of whether the exchange rate
is fixed (and thus subject to DEMO
adjustment) or floating (Katz, 1972; Miller, 1992).
It DEMO been well established that the private
prediction of future exchange rates, DEMO costly and
unreliable – that is, investors cannot reliably predict
the DEMO of exchange rates, beyond informa-
tion provided in currency markets. Furthermore,DEMO
individual firms are price-takers on the foreign
exchange markets. Foreign exchange markets are
too large in volume and too liquid for individual
non-financial companies DEMO influence exchange
rates (Campa, 1994; Eiteman, Stonehill, & Moffett,DEMO
1998). Hence exchange rate uncertainty is resolved
exogenously. Accordingly, we DEMO:
Hypothesis 3: Ceteris paribus, a foreign partner
entering into a JV in an environment with higher
exchange rate uncertainty will have a DEMO
propensity to make a call option investment.
Therefore the foreign partner will take a smaller
share in the JV.
Endogenously Resolved Uncertainty
Cultural uncertainty. DEMO an organization
expands abroad it will be confronted with an
environment that is culturally different from that
in its home country. The success of DEMO foreign
venture will depend on the cooperation and
communication with local parties who tend to
have different values, beliefs and customs
(Hofstede, 2001). A lack of knowledge of the local
culture can have serious DEMO effects on the
investment (Barkema, Bell, & Pennings, 1996). The
more distance there is between the culture of the
foreign investor DEMO the culture of the host
country, the more uncertainty there will DEMO in this
respect. The foreign partner will be unsure of how
well it communicates with local employees,
suppliers and customers as is necessary DEMO succeed
in its new environment. The more distant the
cultures, the DEMO certain it becomes that the
essential skills and knowledge can be effectively
acquired. Thus initial uncertainty also exists about
the conditions for operating successfully DEMO
cultural boundaries in the new environment.
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
Furthermore, as cultural distance increases, it
becomes more uncertain how the parties (owners)
to a DEMO will interact with each other. With increased
cultural distance the partners face increased
communication problems among themselves, are
more likely to have different goals, are more likely
to have a more negative attitude towards each
other, and experience more stress (Weber, Shenkar,
& Raveh, 1996)DEMO Uncertainty about the JV’s
performance increases accordingly.
While such cultural differences indeed represent a
severe source of uncertainty for the firm initiating
expansion abroad, this uncertainty can be resolved
by the actions of the firm itself. DEMO local
experience, a foreign investor can much better
assess cultural predilections DEMO the host country. It
can then assess better how its own personnel and
organization should interface with local parties,
and adjust its behavior DEMO conform to local culture
as relevant (Black, Mendenhall, & Oddou, 1991).
The foreign investor can also use this information
to bargain DEMO the JV partner(s), local employees,
suppliers and customers, DEMO – parties whose
behavior it may effectively influence, unlike
macro-institutions. Such DEMO adjustments to
the behavior of the foreign firm, and plausibly its
DEMO partners, will influence the outcome of the
JV and thereby the DEMO of the asset underlying the
option. Furthermore, the firm can decide DEMO to
invest in learning about the local culture and
values, and DEMO to act proactively based on this
(Black & Mendenhall, 1990). Thus, unlike the
exogenous uncertainty described in our first three
hypotheses, DEMO uncertainty can be resolved
endogenously. This entails a departure from the
assumptions underlying real options logic. There-
fore we do not expect cultural uncertainty DEMO
determine the value of a call option. Hence we
hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4: Ceteris paribus, a foreign partner
originating from a more culturally DEMO coun-
try will not have a higher propensity to make a
call option investment when entering into a JV.
Therefore the foreign partner will DEMO take a
smaller share in the JV.
Uncertainty about development capabilities. In the case
of JVs an important source of uncertainty pertains to
corporate DEMO (Chi & Seth, 2001). First, there
is uncertainty about DEMO standalone capabilities of the
other party, because of information asymmetry.
Second, there is uncertainty about the potential
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
DEMO
benefits of combining the assets contributed by
each partner. This uncertainty is especially
important when it comes to intangible assets and
knowledge-based activities (Martin & Salomon, 2003;
Seth & Kim, 2001).
Such uncertainty DEMO capabilities is most pre-
valent in collaborations that involve product and/
or process development activities. Development
projects generally require a substantial amount of
DEMO know-how and proprietary information
(Chan, Kensinger, Keown, & Martin, DEMO).
Furthermore, in JVs that encompass development
activities, this specific know-how and information
must be shared in order to enable joint discovery, to
search for new solutions, and to accomplish
product or process development goals. This entails
higher uncertainty than in JVs that limit them-
selves to DEMO use of existing know-how (Pisano,
1989). Therefore we expect DEMO about
partner capabilities to be higher in JVs with
development activities.
However, over time the foreign partner will
become better able to assess the development
contributions of the local partner (Chi & Seth,
2001). Information asymmetry about the standa-
lone capabilities of the partner will be DEMO too
(Balakrishnan & Koza, 1993). This will start to
reduce the uncertainty about the benefits of
combining assets (Seth & Kim, DEMO). Furthermore,
the pace and extent to which this uncertainty is
resolved will depend on how much effort the
foreign investor allocates to DEMO and imple-
menting knowledge in the development process
(e.g., Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Mowery, Oxley, &
Silverman, 1996). As DEMO result, the foreign partner
will be able to take a number DEMO actions to increase
the likelihood that the development activities are
successful. Hence resolution of this kind of uncer-
tainty is endogenous to the foreign DEMO
actions (Chi, 2000; Chi & Seth, 2001; Dixit &
Pindyck, 1994; Mowery et al., 1996). Therefore we
do not expect the normal real options effect to
hold. Rather, we predict:

functions and activities within DEMO JV (Oxley &
Sampson, 2004). For example, JVs can perform
manufacturing, marketing, R&D, service activities,
or any combinations of these. An increase in the
scope of a JV increases the DEMO,
complexity and uncertainty of collaborating
(Oxley & Sampson, 2004; DEMO, Zollo, & Singh,
2002). Thus we expect uncertainty to be higher in
JVs with a broader scope.
However, the JV partners can choose to increase
the level of communication and coordination to
deal DEMO the increased uncertainty resulting from a
broader scope (e.g., Kogut, DEMO). Furthermore,
they can learn about each other’s skills, procedures
DEMO capabilities and create idiosyncratic skills to
collaborate, which enable them to DEMO more
successfully with unanticipated contingencies
(Nakamura, Shaver, & Yeung, 1996; Pisano, 1989).
As a consequence, the uncertainty resulting from a
broader scope can be addressed by the actions of
the partners in DEMO JV. Therefore scope-related
uncertainty is endogenous and we do not expect a
real options effect. Accordingly, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 6: Ceteris paribus, a foreign partner

RESEARCH DESIGN
Sample
We collected data on equity JVs (JVs) formed in
China between 1979 and 1996 and involving a
foreign partner. The DEMO source of data is the
Almanac of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade of
China, which is published by the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOF-
TEC).5 The data source listed 8077 Sino-foreign JVs.
However, the number of observations was reduced
to 6472, originating DEMO 41 countries, once we
excluded tripartite JVs for which each party’s DEMO
investment could not be broken down, and coun-
tries for which DEMO (2001) cultural scores
were not available. These JVs are newly established
legal entities in which both partners contribute
resources, including equity. Moreover, DEMO JVs in
our sample are active in 59 different industries and
cover China’s entire geographical area.
The data have been shown to be reliable DEMO

Chinese sources, and parts DEMO the data have been

used in several published studies (e.g., Chadee and
DEMO, 2001; Chadee, Qiu, & Rose, 2003; Pan, 1996,DEMO
2002).6 Furthermore, our sample is comparable to
those used in DEMO published studies of JVs in
China that used other sources, such DEMO from the
China Business Review (e.g., Gaba, Pan, & Ungson,
2002; Tse, Pan, & Au, 1997). Hence we DEMO our
sample is consistent with those used in other
studies, and DEMO representative of all JVs established
in China between 1979 and 1996.
China and our JV data are particularly suited to
test our hypotheses, for several reasons. First, China
was the world’s second largest recipient of FDI after
the US as of 1994 – indeed it surpassed the US DEMO
2003 (UNCTAD, 2003). This provides a large
number of observations originating from a wide
range of countries. Second, China is a complex
environment for foreign investors, where each of
the sources of uncertainty described in our hypo-
theses is substantial (Boisot & Child, 1999). DEMO,
almost all foreign investment in China during the
study period was through JVs. China’s government
actively sought to promote equity-based JVs while
preventing DEMO modes of investment.7 This makes
the data all the more complete.
The question arises, naturally, whether these JVs
are indeed real options. Theoretically, numerous
scholars have argued that JVs are real options (e.g.,
Chi, 2000; Chi & McGuire, 1996; Kogut, 1991;
Miller & Folta, 2002; Reuer & Tong, 2005).
Furthermore, there is DEMO and corroborating
empirical evidence supporting JVs as real options.
More specifically, DEMO is evidence pertaining to
the presence of explicit options in JVs (DEMO &
Tong, 2005), the formation of JVs (Folta, 1998), the
stability of JVs (Folta & Miller, 2002; Kogut, DEMO;
Vassolo, Anand, & Folta, 2004), and the perfor-
DEMO implications of making JV investments
(Kumar, 2005; Tong, Reuer, & Peng, 2008), which
are all consistent with real options predictions.
DEMO the specific case of China there are four
additional reasons to think these JVs contain real
options. First, Reuer and Tong (2005) argued that
JVs are even more likely to be real options under
high DEMO of uncertainty.
Second, we conducted a number of interviews
with managers DEMO multinational firms that are
active in China. These interviews consistently
revealed that firms take a real options approach
when they enter China. For example, one manager
in charge of a large electronics firm’s JVs stated that:DEMO
‘‘We use a real options approach to structure our
investments when we enter China because it is such
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
an unpredictable market’’. Other managers DEMO
similar responses.
Third, by Chinese law, the articles of association
of Sino-foreign JVs must include a pricing mechan-
ism to determine the value DEMO the JV at dissolution
or for other changes of ownership. Furthermore,
the contractual duration of a JV has to be specified
ex ante DEMO the JV’s articles of association. Therefore
JVs in China correspond at least with what Seth and
Chi (2002) classify as an option with DEMO restrictive
termination clause and a pre-specified mechanism
to value the JV. This kind of JV specification is a
stronger and more explicit type of DEMO option than
purely implicit options, and it comes close to the
DEMO form of real options in which the strike
price is exactly specified ex ante. Furthermore, we
can say with confidence that the foreign parties in
Sino-foreign JVs will hold only a call option, and no
put option. That is because China’s legislation and
the policy of the ruling DEMO Communist Party
(CCP) hampered foreigners from exiting by selling
their equity to their venture partner. Likewise, the
Chinese JV partner did not hold a call option but a
put option. In addition, the secondary market for
JVs stakes among foreign investors in China was
highly regulated, and almost non-existent in
practice.8
Fourth, to confirm this we conducted a quantita-
tive analysis of all the stock-listed companies in our
sample, which showed that most of the JVs
remained stable over their ex ante specified DEMO This
is consistent with real options predictions in that
options are usually held until maturity because of
the time value of the option. Furthermore, when we
saw changes in the ownership distribution of JVs,
they DEMO of the foreign partner buying out
some or all of the Chinese party’s equity. This again
is consistent with the JVs being real options DEMO
the foreign partner holds a call option. Moreover,
there is anecdotal evidence that foreign partners use
the ex ante specified pricing mechanism in DEMO JV
contract of association to value the venture when
they decide to strike the call. For example, the Fortis
banking group acquired an additional stake in one
of its Chinese JVs without having to pay a DEMO
over the price determined by the pre-specified
pricing mechanism (Financial Times,DEMO).This
indicates that the Chinese party was not able to
renegotiate and drive up the strike price.
All this does not preclude the foreign DEMO
specifying an explicit strike price when the JV is
formed, making DEMO an even stronger form of real
options. Indeed, we observed a DEMO of firms

entering into a JV in China with such an explicit
option. Among these foreign firms DEMO the British
bank HSBC, US IT company 3COM, Australian
telecommunication firm Telstra, and French car
manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroe¨ n. Overall, we
DEMO convincing evidence that the JVs in our
sample indeed contain real options.
Dependent Variable
Foreign share. Our dependent variable is the
percentage of foreign DEMO in Sino-foreign
JVs. As discussed earlier, a foreign investor who
wants DEMO capture the static NPV part will be more
likely to take a large share, whereas an investor who
makes a call option investment will take a smaller
share (Chi & McGuire, 1996; Reuer, 2002)DEMO Under
Chinese law the percentage of foreign ownership
could range from 25 to 99.9%.
Independent Variables
Economic uncertainty (Hypothesis 1). The degree of
economic uncertainty is measured using the
Euromoney country risk index. This often-used
DEMO measures the economic uncertainty of a
country at a particular time on a scale from 0 to
100 based on credit (e.g., payment DEMO),
analytical (e.g., economic performance forecasts)
and market indicators (e.g., selldown performance).
The index comprises a mix of market perception
and objective measures.9
Local institutional uncertainty (Hypothesis 2). The
Chinese government established a number of
special areas over time to attract foreign
investment. DEMO areas are characterized by a
lower level of uncertainty for foreign investors, as
a result of a higher degree of liberalization, a more
DEMO institutional and regulatory framework,
less bureaucratic red tape, and less DEMO
involvement (Shan, 1991). Two types of special
areas exist, DEMO differ in location, but are
otherwise similar: the Special Economic Zones
(SEZ) and open coastal cities. Five Special
Economic Zones10 were declared DEMO 1980, and a
number of coastal cities11 were opened in 1984. DEMO
include a dummy variable that equals 0 if the JV
was located in either an SEZ or an open coastal city,
indicating lower DEMO, and 1 when the JV is
located in any other region.12 DEMO same or similar
variables have been used in other studies (e.g., Pan,
1996; Shan, 1991).

Assessing real options in international joint ventures
Exchange rate uncertainty (Hypothesis 3). In a fixed
exchange rate regime such as China’s, exchange
rate uncertainty comes not from continuous daily
market changes in the exchange DEMO but from
discrete changes (i.e., devaluations or revaluations)
made by the government at unpredictable
intervals. However, a black market or so-called
‘‘parallel exchange rate market’’ has developed in
many countries with a fixed exchange DEMO regime
(Reinhart & Rogoff, 2004). On this parallel market
the exchange rate changes continuously, subject to
market forces. Therefore there will often be a
difference between the fixed official exchange rate
and the floating DEMO market rate. These
differences are an indication of the level of
exchange rate uncertainty for foreign investors.
The official rate will correspond to the DEMO
(economic) exchange rate when the fixed official
exchange rate equals the floating parallel market
rate. Thus it will be extremely unlikely that a
DEMO change of the official exchange rate will
take place. However, there DEMO be increasing
exchange rate uncertainty when the gap between
the fixed official exchange rate and the floating
parallel market rate grows. This bigger difference
DEMO more strain on the official exchange
rate. Uncertainty increases because it is unclear
how much the official rate will change or when
it will DEMO Accordingly, following Reinhart
and Rogoff (2004), we measure exchange rate
uncertainty as the absolute value of the parallel
market premium (or discount), measured over the
previous 12 months as is common in the
DEMO:13
Parallel Market Premium ¼
jjAverage Annual Official Rate  Average Annual Parallel Rate
Average Annual Official
ð1Þ
Thus a higher parallel market premium (or
discount) indicates more exchange rate uncer-
tainty.14
Cultural uncertainty (Hypothesis DEMO). We measure
cultural uncertainty by using Kogut and Singh’s
(1988) cultural distance index. This often-used
index is based on the difference between DEMO
country and a focal country (here, the investor’s
home country vs China) along each of Hofstede’s
(2001) four initial cultural dimensions. A higher
score on Kogut and Singh’s (1988) cultural distance
index implies DEMO higher level of cultural uncertainty.

Uncertainty about development capabilities
(Hypothesis 5). Based on the textual description
of the activities of the JVs, we identify those
projects that were engaged in any substantive
development activities. We construct DEMO variable
that takes a value of 1 if a JV undertakes develop-
ment activities, and 0 otherwise. In almost all
cases, these activities DEMO to product (rather
than process) adaptation. While pioneering tech-
nological research may represent exogenous uncer-
tainty when it is subject to uncontrollable external
DEMO – a point to which we return in the
discussion – upon careful verification we found
no instance of such projects in our sample DEMO
this early period of foreign investment in China.
A minute number of records (about 1 in 1000)
indicated some form of ‘‘research’’ activity, but
these were not necessarily the type subject to exo-
genous uncertainty, and there were too few cases
for a separate analysis. Our results are robust to
excluding these cases altogether or including them
as development DEMO
Scope-related uncertainty (Hypothesis 6). Similar to
several other studies (e.g., Reuer et al., 2002), we
measure the degree of scope-related DEMO by
using a count measure that captures the number of
activities performed in the JV. This count measure
increases with each of the following DEMO that
are conducted in the JV: manufacturing, marketing,
services and development.
Control variables. We control for a number of
additional factors that DEMO influence the ownership
structure of a JV. First, we control for DEMO duration of
the JV, using the logarithm of the ex ante DEMO
contractual duration of the JV. Foreign investors
entering in an equity JV in China are required to
determine the duration of the project ex DEMO
(Beamish, 1993; Shan, 1991). The duration of an
option determines its value insofar as longer time
horizons provide more opportunities for DEMO option
to become in-the-money (Jarrow & Turnbull, 2000).
Second, DEMO control for the total size of the JV using
the logarithm of the dollar amount invested by both
partners. We also control for the DEMO of the
foreign investor in China, measured as the logarithm
of DEMO number of years since the foreign investor
formed its first JV in China. Furthermore, we create
period fixed-effects for the different 5-year plans15 of
the CCP. These capture general differences in the
business environment across periods. DEMO, we
control for industry differences. There is evidence of
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
inter-industry differences in the patterns DEMO owner-
ship of foreign subsidiaries (Kobrin, 1987). Further-
more, DEMO CCP preferred to keep control over
strategically and symbolically important industries,
which might also influence the ownership distri-
bution in certain industries. Therefore DEMO classified
all JVs by two-digit SIC code based on the description
of their activities and business scope. Subsequently,
we created industry fixed effects DEMO every two-digit
SIC code.
Estimation
We consider two important characteristics of our
data in choosing the appropriate method to test our
hypotheses. First, our dependent variable is cen-
sored because the Chinese government only allows
foreign DEMO to range from a minimum of
25% to a maximum of 99.9%. Foreign investors
might actually prefer an ownership share outside
this range but DEMO up taking a share somewhere
between 25 and 99.9%, choosing the DEMO closest
to their true preference. Indeed, a substantial
number of observations DEMO either boundary
value. Not controlling for the censored dependent
variable is likely to lead to biased results (Greene,
2003). Second, our DEMO are hierarchically struc-
tured, with units at two different but nested DEMO
The lower level consists of the individual JVs,
which we label with the subscript i. The higher
level, which we will label with subscript j, repre-
sents the different countries of origin of the foreign
investors. Failing to take into account the multi-
level structure of the DEMO would possibly result in
underestimated standard errors (Hox, 1995).
Given these considerations, we use a multilevel
tobit model to test our hypotheses. More specifi-
cally, we use a random-intercept multilevel tobit
model with double censoring.16 The general for-
mulation of such a model, given in terms of an
index function, is (Greene, 2003; Hox, 1995)17

Testing Null Hypotheses
In the social sciences, and especially in manage-
ment and international business, testing that
two variables have no effect on each other has
been done using a technique called statistical
power analysis (e.g., Brock, 2003; Cashen and
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
57
Geiger, 2004; Cohen, 1977, 1990; Lane, Cannella,
& Lubatkin, 1998). Advocates of this approach
argued that ex post power calculations could be DEMO
to interpret non-statistical results. Despite its popu-
larity, the use of DEMO hoc power analysis to test null
hypotheses has been severely criticized. Among
others, Hoenig and Heisey (2001) criticized the post
hoc use of power analysis in general, and the use of
the ‘‘observed power’’ and ‘‘detectable effect size’’
approaches in particular, for being misleading and
meaningless, DEMO to the fact that for any test
the observed power is a one-to-one function of the
observed p-value and therefore does not add to DEMO
interpretation of the results.18 Therefore we used a
series of more robust alternative approaches to post
hoc power analysis to test our null hypotheses. DEMO
will discuss these in detail below.
Despite the reservations about post hoc power
analysis, some power applications are still consid-
ered to be appropriate and useful. These include the
use of power analysis in meta-analyses, and the ex
ante determination of the minimum sample size for
designing studies (e.g., Colegrave & Ruxton, 2003;
Hoenig & Heisey, 2001). The latter power applica-
tion is proper and relevant for our purpose. DEMO is,
we use an ex ante approach to determine the
minimum sample size that is needed to be able to
pick up any DEMO relationships between our
independent and dependent variables. More speci-
fically, we DEMO Cohen’s (1977: 440) multiple
regression table conservatively by calculating the
DEMO sample size, given that the effect size is
2
assumed to DEMO extremely small (R ¼0.015), no more
than 50 independent variables DEMO used (including
fixed effects not reported in our tables of results),
and the power of the test (119 b) as desired DEMO ante is
mum sample size we need to be able to observe0.99 (i.e., b¼a¼0.01). This reveals that the mini-
even an extremely DEMO effect size is 4373, which is
well below our sample of DEMO observations. Hence
we can exclude the possibility that we fail to find
any effects due to an insufficiently large sample size.
To then test DEMO an effect is indeed null,
several scholars have suggested examining the
practical magnitudes of the effects and analyzing
the range of possible effect DEMO that are (not)
supported by the data (e.g., Colegrave & Ruxton,
2003). The practical magnitudes of the effects can
simply be examined by taking the partial deriva-
tives of the coefficients and DEMO the effect of
a one-standard-deviation (for continuous variables)
or one-unit (for binary variables) change in the
variables. However, this only informs DEMO about the

Assessing real options in international joint ventures
58
mean of all possible DEMO the true effect can take.
Therefore Hoenig and Heisey (2001) and Colegrave
and Ruxton (2003) recommended that researchers
investigate the range of DEMO sizes rather than just
their mean value. To do so, we DEMO an approach
similar to the one suggested by Johnson (2005) and
Colegrave and Ruxton (2005) to interpret non-
significant results and test DEMO hypotheses. This
approach considers simultaneously the range and
the position (relative DEMO zero) of the distribution
that the true effect size can have, and thus allows us
to calculate the probability that the real effect DEMO is
larger or smaller than a trivial value. This prob-
ability can be written as
Fðb4dÞ or FðbodÞð3Þ
where b is the true coefficient, F¼normal(b,SEb), SEb
is the standard error of b, and d is a trivial effect.
For this test it is important to DEMO what is to be
considered a trivial effect size. Several methods to
determine d have been suggested in the literature
(e.g., Murphy & DEMO, 2004). One is a deductive
method based on well-established theory. DEMO do
not deem this method appropriate in this study
because it presumes that there is a wealth of
previous research to draw on. Alternatively, an
inductive method might be used. This is appro-
priate when there DEMO sufficient relevant data,
derived for instance from meta-analyses. However,
such data are again not available in our case.
Although neither of these DEMO is helpful in
our particular case, we can use a third DEMO to
identify values that are meaningful vs trivial: we use
as DEMO points the minimum effect size we
observe for the exogenously resolved sources of
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
uncertainty and the maximum effect DEMO we
observe for the endogenously resolved sources of
uncertainty. This also allows us to contrast both
forms of uncertainty.
We ascertained the reliability of DEMO measures of
endogenous uncertainty (and others) in two ways.
First, DEMO used measures that have often been used
in the literature, and DEMO in studies that
focused on the same empirical setting as ours and
resulted in significant findings (e.g., Luo, 2005;
Oxley & Sampson, 2004; Pan, 1996; Reuer et al.,
2002). This DEMO that sufficiently established
and noise-free measures are on hand. Second, we
DEMO nomological validity testing – a method
that is commonly used to test the validity of
psychological constructs (Cronbach & Meehl,
1955). Using the same sample, we found that our
independent variables are significantly related to
various dependent variables (such as indicators of
investment size and timing) in a manner consistent
with extant theory.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics and pairwise correlation can
be found in Table 1. The negative correlations
between our DEMO of economic uncertainty,
local institutional uncertainty and exchange rate
uncertainty, DEMO, and the foreign share in
the JV are consistent with our DEMO 1, 2 and
3. Conversely, the correlations between the mea-
sures of the three sources of uncertainty that are
resolved endogenously – that DEMO, cultural, develop-
ment (capabilities) and scope-related uncertainty –
and the foreign share in the JV are positive.
Additionally, the correlations do not suggest that
collinearity might be a problem.

are resolved exogenously to DEMO 2 as we did in
Model 3, significantly increases the fit DEMO the model
(w2¼112.42 for three variables; po0.001). By contrast,
the addition of the three sources of uncertainty that
are resolved endogenously DEMO Model 2, as we did in
Model 4, does not improve model fit (w2¼5.76 for
three variables). Finally, in Model 5 DEMO add the three
sources of endogenous uncertainty to the model that
includes all the sources of exogenous uncertainty
(Model 3). This also reveals that the endogenous
sources of uncertainty do not contribute significantly
to model DEMO (w2¼2.62 for three variables).Overall,the
joint significance of the exogenous DEMO of uncer-
tainty and the lack of joint explanatory power of the
three endogenous forms of uncertainty are in line
with our hypotheses.
The DEMO of Models 1 and 2 show that, among
the control variables, only JV duration has a
significant (positive) effect. This is consistent DEMO
the existence of an NPV component in real options
investments (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994). Likewise, the
foreign partner’s experience has a significant (nega-
tive) effect. Inclusion of industry effects does not
substantially change DEMO interpretation of the
results.
Exogenously Resolved Uncertainty
In Model 3, we DEMO a negative and significant
relationship (po0.001) between foreign share and
our measure of economic uncertainty. This is
consistent with Hypothesis 1. Similarly, we find a
negative and significant relationship (po0.01)
between foreign share and our measure of local
institutional uncertainty, supporting Hypothesis 2.
Finally, we DEMO that foreign investors will take a
smaller share when our measure of exchange rate
uncertainty increases. Thus Hypothesis 3 is strongly
supported (po0.001). When we add to Model 3 the
effects for endogenously resolved uncertainty, as in
Model 5, we find almost identical results, with
Hypotheses DEMO, 2 and 3 supported; indeed, the
significance of local institutional DEMO
(Hypothesis 2) improves to po0.001. Thus our
findings strongly support our first three hypoth-
eses. The results for the exogenously resolved
sources of DEMO are, as expected, in line with
real options logic.
Endogenously Resolved Uncertainty
Model 4 adds the effects of endogenously resolved
uncertainty. In line DEMO Hypothesis 4 (and con-
trary to what might be expected if DEMO options logic
were misapplied), we find no relationship between
Journal of International Business Studies
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
foreign share and DEMO measure of cultural uncer-
tainty. Similarly, in line with Hypothesis 5, we find
no relationship between foreign share and the
presence of development DEMO indicating uncer-
tainty about partner capabilities. In Model 4, we do
DEMO find a negative relationship between foreign
share and our measure of scope-related uncertainty
in the JV; indeed the coefficient is significant and
positive in Model 4, but becomes insignificant in
the more completely specified Model 5. Either way,
this is in line with Hypothesis 6. The coefficients DEMO
the other two sources of endogenously resolved
uncertainty remain insignificant in Model 5. Thus
the overall results are in line with Hypotheses 4, 5
and 6. As expected, real options predictions do
not hold when uncertainty can be resolved endo-
genously, and thereby the source of uncertainty
departs from the assumptions underlying option
logic.
Effect Magnitudes
Examination of the practical DEMO of the
hypothesized effects confirms the statistically sig-
nificant results. Based on the partial derivatives of
the coefficients in Model 5, the marginal effect of a
one-standard-deviation increase in economic
uncertainty lowers the foreign partner’s equity
DEMO by 2.2%. Likewise, the dependent variable
is approximately 1.8% lower when DEMO investment
is in a Special Economic Zone or coastal city
with lower local institutional uncertainty. A one-
standard-deviation increase in exchange rate uncer-
tainty, meanwhile, lowers the dependent variable
by over 4.1%. Besides being statistically non-
significant, the practical magnitudes associated
with endogenous sources of uncertainty are only a
fraction of those of the exogenous variables. The
marginal effect of DEMO one-standard-deviation change
in cultural uncertainty lowers the foreign partner’s
equity stake by just 1%. The dependent variable is
about 0.4% higher in JVs that DEMO develop-
ment activities. Likewise, a one-standard-deviation
change in the scope-related uncertainty DEMO
the dependent variable by 0.3%. Comparing con-
tinuous variables, the magnitudes DEMO the exogen-
ously resolved variables are over twice as large as
(DEMO up to 13 times larger than) those of endogen-
ously resolved DEMO Likewise, comparing bin-
ary variables, the endogenously resolved variable
has a magnitude 4.5 times greater than the
exogenously resolved variable. Overall, the average
of the absolute values of the practical magnitudes
of the exogenous sources DEMO uncertainty is more
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
than 4.5 times greater than DEMO of the endogenous
sources of uncertainty. This analysis is again
consistent with our predictions, and we hope that
this also illustrates the value of paying more
attention to the substantive magnitude of observed
effects in international DEMO research as well as
in related fields, whether or not authors DEMO
interested in null hypotheses (Shaver, 2008).
Analyzing the Range of the Effect Magnitudes
Analyzing the practical magnitudes of the effects
revealed strong DEMO between exogenously
and endogenously resolved sources of uncertainty.
This provides essential information about the mean
of all possible values that the true effect can DEMO,
but not about the range of values that the true
effect can take (and therefore confidence in the
mean). Therefore we investigated the entire range
of effect sizes, which also allows us to calculate the
probability that the true effect of each hypothesized
coefficient is larger DEMO a trivial value. As it is
difficult to specify what is a trivial effect size, we
consider several plausible and empirically informed
cutoff values for trivial effects.
First, we considered a 1% change in the depen-
dent variable as cutoff for a trivial effect. Of all the
endogenous DEMO of uncertainty, a one-standard-
deviation change in cultural uncertainty has, with
an impact of 1%, the largest effect on the
dependent variable. Furthermore, a 1% change in
ownership is the smallest change we can observe in
our data; given rounding, any observed 1% change
may in DEMO be much smaller yet. Hence this is a
meaningful cutoff. The probabilities that a 1%
decrease in the foreign partner’s ownership of the
JV DEMO from a one-standard-deviation increase in
economic uncertainty (p¼0.999), a unit DEMO in
institutional uncertainty (p¼0.924), and a one-
standard-deviation increase in DEMO rate uncer-
tainty (p40.999), respectively, are all very high. By
contrast, the probabilities that a 1% decrease in the
dependent variable results from respectively a one-
standard-deviation increase in cultural uncertainty
(p¼0.500, by DEMO), a one-unit increase in
development uncertainty (pstandard-deviation increase in scope-related DEMO), and a one-
tainty (po0.001) are considerably lower.
Second, DEMO considered a 1.8% change in the
foreign partner’s ownership stake as a cutoff for a
trivial effect. A 1.8% change is meaningful in that
DEMO effect of a one-unit change in institutional
uncertainty equals 1.8%, which DEMO the lowest effect
of all three sources of exogenous uncertainty. We
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
61
find that the probabilities that a DEMO decrease in the
dependent variable results from, respectively, a
one-standard-deviation increase in economic
uncertainty (p¼0.900), a one-unit increase in
institutional uncertainty (DEMO, by definition)
and a one-standard-deviation shift in exchange
rate uncertainty (p40.999) are again considerable.
Conversely, the corresponding probabilities for the
endogenously DEMO forms of uncertainty are less
than half of those values: cultural DEMO
(pand scope-related uncertainty (p¼0.248), development uncertainty (po0.001). ¼0.161)DEMO
Finally, we replicate the analysis using 2.5% as a
cutoff value. DEMO is motivated by the fact that a
2.5% change in ownership corresponds, on average,
to a $100,000 increase in the equity investment
made by the foreign partner in our data. The tests
reveal a DEMO pattern: the probabilities that an
increase in each of the exogenous DEMO of
uncertainty result in a decrease in the dependent
variable that is larger than 2.5% are still consider-
able, while those of the endogenous sources are
small (po0.100).
Overall, across a range of different DEMO values
for a trivial effect, we find high probabilities that
the DEMO effect of the exogenous sources on the
dependent variable is non-trivial. In contrast, the
probabilities that the true effects of the endogen-
ously resolved sources of uncertainty are non-trivial
are considerably smaller. These consistent differ-
ences DEMO the exogenous and endogenous
resolved sources of uncertainty provide strong
support for our hypotheses.
Hoenig and Heisey (2001) also argued that
Bayesian methods DEMO an alternative approach
to evaluate null hypotheses. To further test the
robustness of our results, we generated the posterior
distributions of our coefficients using a Bayesian
tobit model.21 Analyzing the posterior distributions
of the coefficients of DEMO exogenously resolved
sources of uncertainty revealed that all three are
negative and distinctly different from zero. By
contrast, the posterior distributions of the coeffi-
cients of the endogenously resolved sources of
uncertainty are centered around zero. DEMO
details of our Bayesian analysis are available from
the authors upon request.
In summary, by every method proposed by
Hoenig and Heisey (2001), Colegrave and Ruxton
(2005), and Johnson (2005), among others, we find
consistent support for the predictions whereby
exogenous uncertainty leads to a real-options-
consistent choice of equity shares, and conversely

62
consistent support for the DEMO whereby
endogenous uncertainty does not lead to such
outcomes.22
DISCUSSION
The results advance our understanding of the
boundary conditions for real options theory. In
DEMO options theory, one of the main predictions is
that higher levels DEMO uncertainty will increase
option value, which will in turn increase the
DEMO of the occurrence of a real options
investment. In JVs this will result in a smaller
ownership share for the call option holder. How-
DEMO, we also argued that this logic would not hold
when uncertainty DEMO resolved endogenously rather
than exogenously. When uncertainty is resolved
exogenously, we DEMO find a negative relationship
between economic uncertainty (Hypothesis 1),
local institutional uncertainty (Hypothesis 2) and
exchange rate uncertainty (Hypothesis 3), respec-
tively, and the foreign share in a JV. These results
confirm the power of real options logic when it
comes to exogenous uncertainty. DEMO also examined
the relationship between cultural uncertainty
(Hypothesis 4), uncertainty DEMO development
capabilities (Hypothesis 5) and scope-related uncer-
tainty (Hypothesis 6), respectively, and the foreign
share in a JV. Using appropriate techniques DEMO
to test null hypotheses, we find no support for the
statistical DEMO that would follow from a real
options model. Thus, as we DEMO, conventional
real options logic is applicable when uncertainty is
resolved exogenously, but not when it is resolved
endogenously.
This study has implications for DEMO scholars and
practitioners. First, our framework makes it possible
to identify DEMO conditions under which an invest-
ment can truly be expected to represent a real
option. A wide range of investments has been
classified as DEMO options investments, and previous
empirical results have shown inconsistent support
for DEMO options theory. We argue that this may be
because real options logic might inadequately
characterize investments that are subject to endo-
genously resolved uncertainty. DEMO research also
confirms that real options theory has strong
predictive power in the presence of exogenous
uncertainty. While we did not examine the perfor-
DEMO implications of JV stakes, the results are
consistent with arguments whereby DEMO options
can be an effective means of dealing with uncer-
tainty when undertaking strategic investments –
provided the uncertainty is exogenous.

Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
Second, as appealing as DEMO real options
metaphorically may be, this should be done only
while DEMO carefully in mind what sources of
uncertainty the option is meant to hedge, and
whether the uncertainty is resolved endogenously.
Third, researchers and DEMO should be
aware of the boundaries of the theory when they
use it to examine potential investments. Using real
options logic to value projects DEMO it is not
suitable is likely to lead to suboptimal decision-
making. Adner and Levinthal (2004a, b) argued that
practitioners might be able to make use of real
options logic when uncertainty is resolved endo-
DEMO, but only if they compensate for endo-
geneity by putting control DEMO into place and
by changing the design of the organization. How-
ever, this is likely to require a costly trade-off, as
such mechanisms DEMO impede progress, and the
organizational costs may outstrip the quasi-option
value DEMO obtained.
Similarly, researchers might be able to make use
of real DEMO logic when uncertainty is resolved
endogenously – but only if their formal models,
and equally importantly their empirical analyses,
incorporate the unique DEMO and conse-
quences of endogenously resolved uncertainty.
Sophisticated decision-theoretic models with endo-
genous uncertainty have been developed in the
operations research and economics literatures
(Koussis, Martzoukos, & Trigeorgis, 2007; Pawlina
& Kort, 2006), and have started to find their way
into international business and strategy DEMO,
such as Chi and Seth’s (2009) work on MNE entry
mode choices. However, these modeling develop-
ments have so far been accompanied by a relative
dearth of empirical evidence about the actual
feasibility and DEMO of such strategies. From this
standpoint, our study does not imply DEMO it is
necessary to ‘‘shut down’’ research on real options
when uncertainty is endogenous. However, it
implies that such research should duly and expli-
citly incorporate the endogeneity of uncertainty.
Furthermore, it must also develop and build upon
compelling, generalizable empirical evidence about
whether the strategies for real options with endo-
genous uncertainty are feasible and cost-effective in
practice, notwithstanding the computational and
organizational costs that they add.
The implications for JV DEMO are substantive
too. While numerous scholars have looked at the
conditions under which JVs are more or less
appropriate (e.g., Contractor & Lorange, 2002;
Hennart, 1988), the determinants of the ownership
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
distribution of JVs have received DEMO less attention
in the JV literature (Cuypers & Martin, 2007), and
studies have produced comparatively disappointing
empirical results (e.g., Gatignon & DEMO,
1988). Our results confirm that a real options
perspective can be useful in modeling equity share
decisions in JVs, although we show that this is true
only when uncertainty is resolved exogenously.
Furthermore, our model describes determinants
of the optimal level of ownership for a foreign
DEMO This is especially relevant in dealing with
highly (exogenously) uncertain markets, which is a
basic reason to consider JVs in the first place. Our
findings thus point to the importance of carefully
specifying the relationship DEMO various sources
of uncertainty and a firm’s expansion strategy, as a
DEMO strategy should be in line with the nature of
the uncertainties it faces. This highlights the need
for and the rewards from a more DEMO concep-
tualization of uncertainty in the international
business and strategy literatures.
Limitations and Suggestions for Further Research
This study is not without its limitations, and several
suggestions for further research can be made. First,
we DEMO the applicability of real options theory in
one particular country. While China has become a
favorite destination of foreign investment, future
studies could verify our results in other national
settings, provided local conditions are consistent
with the use of JVs as real options. Second, we look
only at one particular type of real options invest-
ment, namely the JV. However, our theoretical
arguments hold regardless of the type of real
options investments. Thus it would be interesting
to look at other types of real DEMO investments,
such as in patenting and new business contexts.
Third, DEMO look at six different sources of uncer-
tainty. Future research could examine yet other
sources of uncertainty to further evaluate where
real options logic DEMO in practice.
Relatedly, a debate has arisen about the extent to
DEMO research activities should be thought of as
real options. As mentioned above, our sample did
not include pioneering technological research
activities – as opposed to plain development
activities, which are more akin to technical tasks
(DEMO, Martin, & Domoto, 2003). Nevertheless,
our framework offers DEMO way to think about research
activities too. By our logic, research DEMO at
pioneering new technology may represent a real
options investment – but only if the resolution of
the associated uncertainty is outside the control DEMO
Ilya RP Cuypers and Xavier Martin
63
the firm and therefore exogenous. Oriani and
Sobrero (2008) likewise point to the relevance of
the DEMO between industry-wide patterns of
design upheaval, whose resolution may depend on
DEMO uncoordinated efforts of multiple actors from
various industries, and discrete projects DEMO a
dominant design. The former may represent
(nearly) exogenous uncertainty that can occur at
some stages of an industry’s evolution, whereas the
latter is normally endogenous. This distinction thus
maps onto our discussion of exogenous DEMO endo-
genous uncertainty, and future research encom-
passing this distinction may DEMO insights into
specific conditions under which R&D can be
effectively modeled as a matter of real options.
We examined the roles of different DEMO of
uncertainty on the ownership distribution of JVs
from a real options perspective. However, our
findings also have implications for alternative
theoretical perspectives. For example, in transac-
tion cost economics (TCE) behavioral uncertainty
figures as an endogenous factor that can be
addressed via governance decisions (Williamson,
1985). More specifically, a premise of TCE is that
firms will opt for a governance structure that
provides a higher level of control, in order to
reduce the increased hazards of opportunistic
behavior by the DEMO party, when behavioral
uncertainty is high. However, few TCE studies
have looked at the equity distribution of JVs,
and these studies yielded DEMO results. Gatignon
and Anderson (1988) were able to explain the
choice between full ownership and shared owner-
ship, but they were generally unsuccessful in
explaining the ownership distribution when a JV
was chosen. Similarly, Delios and Beamish (1999)
and Chen, Hu, and Hu (2002) found ambiguous or
no effects of factors causing behavioral uncertainty
on the DEMO distribution of JVs.
Given these mixed results in the TCE literature on
JVs, our non-significant findings are not surprising.
However, we must note DEMO the variables we use to
capture the level of endogenous uncertainty differ
from the typical variables used in TCE studies,
where measures typically DEMO on asset specificity
and marketing intensity. Unfortunately we lack
such data for the JVs in our sample, although our
JV-level control variables and industry fixed effects
go some way towards accounting for such unobser-
vables. Furthermore, although our empirical setting
is all the more suitable to test real DEMO
predictions, it is far less suitable to explain the
ownership distribution DEMO a TCE perspective or
Journal of International Business Studies
Assessing real options in international joint ventures
64
from an agency perspective. DEMO is, because of
China’s unique JV legislation during the period of
DEMO sample, the correspondence between decision
rights and control, respectively, and DEMO level of
ownership in JVs was not as close as in other
contexts. In our setting, it may be more appropriate
for TCE research to examine the allocation of key
(managerial) positions instead (Chi & Roehl, 1997).
Nevertheless, research exploring the implications of
our findings DEMO various alternative theoretical
perspectives would be well warranted.
Finally, we use DEMO dichotomous classification to
distinguish between endogenously and exogen-
ously resolved uncertainty. However, some sources
of uncertainty may be more strictly endogenous
(exogenous) than others. Therefore a more contin-
uous classification of how uncertainty is resolved
DEMO lead to additional insights, provided proper
scales can be developed. On DEMO basis, it would also
be worthwhile to extend the range of DEMO
of uncertainty considered, including especially
demand uncertainty (Delacroix & Swaminathan,
1991; Wholey & Brittain, 1989). Furthermore, an
interesting avenue for future research would be to
refine our conceptualization of uncertainty by
identifying DEMO types of uncertainty within
the exogenous–endogenous classification, and to
explore their DEMO In particular, some
forms of endogenous uncertainty may precipitate
all-or-nothing investments (for instance, to shape
industry structure) while others need not.23
CONCLUSION
DEMO study shows that the use of real options can be
made more powerful, both academically and in
practice, by paying extra attention to DEMO sources
and resolution of the uncertainty that the options
are meant to exploit. In the context of IJVs, we
show that normal real options predictions are
ineffective when uncertainty is resolved endogen-
ously, but all the more powerful when the firm
faces exogenous uncertainty. Given the prevalence
of DEMO in international operations, and of
IJVs as a mode of entry, further research in this area
is all the more justified.

NOTES
1 The approaches that have been used in the few
existing studies DEMO the distribution of JV
ownership among partners are transaction cost eco-
nomics (Chen et al., 2002; Delios & Beamish, 1999;
Gatignon & Anderson, 1988), agency theory (Chi &
Roehl, 1997; DEMO & Yeung, 1994) and the
bargaining perspective (Blodgett, 1991; DEMO and
Wells, 1982). However, these studies have yielded
mixed results regarding the role of (behavioral)
uncertainty in the equity distribution of JVs. For a
detailed review of this literature, see Cuypers and
Martin (2007).
2 The concept of uncertainty used in option theory
is actually one of risk in the sense of Knight (1921),
DEMO that options pricing models assume that it is
possible to specify the probability distribution of
future asset values. Nevertheless, we follow the
extant use of terminology in referring to this as
‘‘uncertainty’’.
3 In the case DEMO exogenous uncertainty the firm will
wait for information about how the exogenous source
of uncertainty has evolved and subsequently take
action, that is, DEMO whether to strike, hold onto or
abandon the option. In a DEMO sense this can also be
seen as learning. However, contrary to DEMO in the
case of endogenously resolved uncertainty, the firm
cannot determine DEMO pace of information revelation,
nor can it influence its outcomes. ‘‘Learning’’ amidst
exogenous uncertainty thus simply represents the
passive receipt of updated information. DEMO does not
represent the systematic, forward-looking accumula-
tion of experience or DEMO proactive development of
causal insight that is normally associated with organi-
zational learning (Fiol & Lyles, 1985).
4 For simplicity of exposition, we treat the foreign
partner as the call option holder. This is DEMO with
the existing literature (e.g., Reuer & Tong, 2005). DEMO
will discuss why this assumption is all the more valid in
our empirical setting, that is, China, when we describe
our sample below. In some other empirical settings it
may be less clear who is DEMO call option holder.

1979 and 1996. Other studies use a subset of our
sample. Pan’s (1996) sample covers the 1979–1992
period; Chadee and Qiu (2001) look DEMO 1992–1995;

7Deng Xiaoping’s reforms were summed up in the
‘‘Four DEMO of agriculture, industry, science
and technology and the military. The focus was on
knowledge transfer from the West. The CCP’s initial
view was DEMO this could best be achieved by setting up
joint ventures with foreign partners. Therefore all
alternative investment modes were prohibited except
for a few DEMO (Almanac of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade of China, various issues).
8Whatever the letter of the law, contracts may be
imperfectly enforceable in the presence of weak
institutions. For instance, in the context of the Brazilian
telecommunication industry, Perkins, Morck, and
Yeung (2008) found that local partners may use
pyramidal ownership schemes, and used local institu-
tions to take advantage of foreign partners. Our
fieldwork does not suggest DEMO this is as much of an
issue in China. This may partly explain why China has
been so successful at attracting foreign direct invest-
DEMO, including Sino-foreign JVs. As Fan, Morck, Xu,
and Yeung (2007: 25) put it: ‘‘Ultimately, China may
well provide a DEMO institutional environment for FDI
operations than for domestic operations – large or
small, state controlled or privately run. If China, more
than other DEMO, favors FDI in this way, it might
well receive an elevated FDI inflow’’.

get consistent scores that go back to 1979. Excluding

12 As an alternative measure of institutional uncer-
tainty, we used the component of the Economic
Freedom of the World index that captures the level of
uncertainty DEMO from a country’s institutional
framework. This measure is published annually by the
Fraser Institute, and varies over time rather than
between different geographical areas within China.
Our results remain robust. However, using this alter-
native measure resulted in moderate levels of colli-
nearity, which is especially undesirable when testing
multiple hypotheses. Therefore we used the location-
based variable described above DEMO
13 Exchange rate data are from various annual issues
of the World Currency Yearbook, Pick’s Currency
Yearbook and the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange
Rate Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.
14 To test the robustness of our DEMO, we used the
18-month volatility of the parallel rate (again the
common time frame) as an alternative measure of
exchange rate uncertainty. The results were consistent
with those reported below.
15 Our sample covers (parts of) the fifth (1976–
1980), sixth (1981–1985), seventh (DEMO) and
eighth (1991–1996) plans. The period effects are
lagged by DEMO year because these plans were usually
announced at the end of the year. Thus fixed effects
represent the periods 1979–1981, 1982–1986 and so
on.
16 Our model comprises two levels: JV and home
country. Such a model is also referred to as a tobit
model with double censoring DEMO random effects.
Here, the random effects are for home countries.
17 DEMO scholars have argued that JVs in which one
partner has a very dominant controlling stake can be
better considered as wholly owned subsidiaries (e.g.,
Hennart, 1991). Therefore, to test the robustness of
our DEMO, we also specified several models with
different limit values of ownership DEMO such as upper
limits of 90% (e.g., Hennart, 1991) and 95% (e.g.,
Hennart & Larimo, 1998; Lu, 2002) ownership.
Our results were robust to these alternative tobit
specifications.
