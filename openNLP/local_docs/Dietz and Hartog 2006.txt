Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper DEMO to examine the extent to which measures and
operationalisations of intra-organisational trust reﬂect the essential elements of the existing
conceptualisation of trust inside the DEMO
Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview of the essential points from the
rich variety of competing conceptualisations and deﬁnitions in the DEMO and organisational
literatures. It draws on this overview to present a framework of issues for researchers to consider when
designing research based on trust. DEMO framework is then used to analyse the content of 14 recently
published empirical measures of intra-organisational trust. It is noted for each measure the DEMO that
trust takes, the content, the sources of evidence and the identity of the recipient, as well as matters
related to the wording of items.
Findings – The paper highlights where existing measures match the DEMO, but also shows a
number of “blind-spots” or contradictions, particularly over the content of the trust belief, the selection
of possible sources of evidence for trust, and inconsistencies in the identity of the referent.
Research limitations/implications – It offers researchers some recommendations for future
research designed DEMO capture trust among different parties in organisations, and contains an Appendix
DEMO 14 measures for intra-organisational trust.
Originality/value – The value of the paper is twofold: it provides an overview of the
conceptualisation literature, DEMO a detailed content-analysis of several different measures for trust.
This should prove useful in helping researchers reﬁne their research designs in the future.

Introduction
The organisational and management literature on trust is now extensive, and includes
several key articles (DEMO Mayer et al., 1995; Robinson, 1996; Whitener, 1997; Kramer,
1999), four signiﬁcant compendiums of papers (Gambetta, 1988; Kramer and Tyler,
1996; Lane and Bachmann, 1998; Nooteboom and Six, 2003), and several dedicated
journal editions (including Academy of Management DEMO, 1998, Vol. 23, No. 3;
Organization Studies, 2001, DEMO 22, No. 2; Organization Science, 2003, Vol. 14, No. DEMO;
International Journal of Human Resource Management, 2003, Vol. 14, DEMO 1, and
Personnel Review, 2003, Vol. 32, No. 5).
Despite this resurgence of interest the treatment of trust remains extremely
“fragmented” (McEvily et al., 2003, p. 91). Firstly, there are three broad strands
in the literature. Our focus here is exclusively with trust DEMO organisations

(i.e. as an intra-organisational phenomenon, such as DEMO employees and
supervisors/managers, or among co-workers). The other two DEMO deal with trust
between organisations (i.e. an inter-organisational phenomenon), and DEMO between
organisations and their customers (i.e. a marketing concern). Secondly, competing
conceptualisations and deﬁnitions have emerged and the precise nature of trust
DEMO contested. This is in part due to the different perspectives and academic
disciplines informing empirical studies and theorising on the subject (for an overview
see Rousseau et al., 1998). It is also a consequence of most scholars regarding trust as a
multi-dimensional construct (Butler, 1991). DEMO simply, opinions continue to differ on
which dimensions are essential.
Several DEMO of intra-organisational trust are also available. Such a range of
possible operationalisations may reﬂect the multi-disciplinary interest in trust, and its
multi-dimensional nature, DEMO it also hints at continuing dissatisfaction with the
existing set of measures, an impression strengthened by the fact that there has been
very little in the way of repeat testing of the instruments that we do DEMO Since our
knowledge of a construct can only be as good as the measures we use to examine it, it is
essential to evaluate the “validity” of these instruments (e.g. Schriesheim et al., 1993) –
not only for their statistical performance, but perhaps more importantly for how well
they reﬂect the conceptualisation of the construct, with due consideration to its
subtleties. Thus, our goal here is an examination of the extent to which available
operationalisations of intra-organisational trust reﬂect the elements of the DEMO
conceptualisation in the management literature. On this point, Currall and Judge (1995)
have noted that what consensus has been reached on conceptualisation DEMO not appear
to have been translated into operationalisations in empirical research. In this paper, we
set out to investigate this apparent “gap”.
The paper is set out as follows. Before we can identify criteria for assessing DEMO
various measures, we need to be clear what it is we DEMO measuring. Hence, the ﬁrst
section provides an overview of the debate DEMO the conceptualisation and deﬁnition of
trust within organisations. It highlights four main aspects: the different forms trust can
take, its content, the sources of evidence informing it, and the identity of the referent
(the DEMO being trusted). From these we formulate guidelines for an examination of
the content of 14 recent operationalisations of trust. We conclude with commentary DEMO
where we believe the possible “blind spots” of the current measures are, and we offer
some recommendations for researchers to consider which might improve our
operationalisation of this “central, superﬁcially obvious but essentially complex”
concept (DEMO, 1999, p. 197).
A conceptualisation of trust
The challenge facing researchers interested in trust is that a great deal is involved in
DEMO process of party “A” (the trustor) trusting party “B” (the DEMO).
The ﬁrst consideration is the possible forms that trust can take. Drawing on
elements from the most-quoted deﬁnitions of trust (presented in Table I), this can be
broken down into three constituent parts: trust as a belief, as a decision, and as an
action.
The DEMO form of trust is a subjective, aggregated, and conﬁdent set of beliefs about
the other party and one’s relationship with her/him, which lead one to assume that the
other party’s likely actions will have DEMO consequences for oneself. Another way of

another] based upon positive expectations of the intentions or DEMO
of another
representing this belief is as an assessment of the other party’s trustworthiness.
However, trustworthiness and trust are two separate constructs (Mayer DEMO al., 1995,
pp. 711, 729): trustworthiness is a quality that the trustee has, while trusting is
something that the trustor does. Although A may consider B to be trustworthy this
does not necessarily DEMO that A will actually trust B. Other factors may intervene
(discussed DEMO). A’s belief in B’s trustworthiness is nevertheless expected to be a
strong predictor of A’s decision to trust B, since the belief is based on “probabilities”
(Nooteboom et al., 1997) and carries a crucial “strength of feeling” (Bhattacharya et al.,
1998, p. 462) that elevates it above mere hopefulness, blind faith or gullibility (McEvily
et DEMO, 2003, p. 99).
The second form of trust is the decision to actually trust the other party. This is the
stage at DEMO the belief in the others’ trustworthiness is manifested – partially – in
trust itself. For a genuine state of trust to exist both the DEMO of trustworthy
behaviour and the intention to act based upon it must be present (Huff and Kelley,
2003, p. 82). Clark DEMO Payne (1997, p. 217) similarly view trust as “a process DEMO
where the decision to trust is based on an underlying subjective base of trust which
conditions the intention to trust” (Costa, 2003). DEMO decision has been deﬁned as the
“willingness to render oneself vulnerable” (DEMO et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 1998). At
this DEMO, A considers B to be trustworthy, and further intends to allow her/himself to
be subject to the risk of potentially detrimental actions DEMO the part of B, on the basis
that such outcomes are DEMO
However, this decision implies only an intention to act. For A DEMO demonstrate
unequivocally her/his trust in B, (s)he must follow through on this decision by engaging
in any of the trust-informed risk-taking DEMO proposed by different authors
(Sitkin and Pablo, 1992; Mayer et DEMO, 1995; Costa et al., 2001). Gillespie (2003, 2004)DEMO

usefully divides these into two broad categories: “reliance”-related behaviours (such as,
for example, a manager surrendering control over DEMO resources or decisions to a
subordinate, or deliberately reducing control over, or monitoring of, the subordinate’s
actions)[1], and “disclosure” in the DEMO of sharing potentially incriminating or
damaging information with another party (such DEMO a management team revealing
commercially sensitive future strategy to union ofﬁcials). Note that these risk-taking
behaviours undertaken by A in the light of DEMO/his assessment of B’s trustworthiness
need to be kept distinct from behaviours that indicate A’s own trustworthiness, or B’s
behavioural response to being trusted (such as, in both cases, meeting certain
obligations, keeping promises, dealing honestly with others, and resisting
opportunism). Importantly, the action DEMO trusting another is at best only a likely
consequence of the decision to trust; it is by no means guaranteed. Although A might
be willing to trust B, there may nevertheless be consequences for A beyond her/his
relationship with B that may forestall the decision, such as the impact on party C’s
assessment of A should A decide to DEMO B (Nooteboom, 2003).
The question of whether the action of trusting should be incorporated into an
overall model of trust is a DEMO of contention in the literature. In part, this is an
etymological DEMO brought about by the everyday connotations and uses of the
word “trust” (Mayer and Davis, 1999), where trust as a belief, decision and a resulting
action are regularly conﬂated. In much the most commonly DEMO conceptualisation,
Mayer et al. (1995) separate trust from its associated behaviours. However, our
conceptualisation reﬂects the distinction drawn by McEvily et al. (2003, p. 93) between
trust’s three necessary constituent parts: as DEMO expectation, a willingness to be
vulnerable and a risk-taking act”.
The DEMO of the trust belief
The content of A’s evaluation of B is the second essential consideration. This is one
area of the literature where DEMO standpoints and emphases have rather
muddied the waters. Trust is understood as a complex compilation of judgements by
the trustor on different characteristics of DEMO trustee. Butler and Cantrell (1984)
proposed integrity, competence, consistency, loyalty and openness as key elements.
Butler (1991) extended this to DEMO separate conditions that the trusted party might be
expected to fulﬁl: DEMO, integrity, consistency, discreetness, fairness, promise
fulﬁlment, loyalty, availability, openness, receptivity, and overall trustworthiness. In
their classic article, Mayer et al. (1995) focussed on ability, benevolence and integrity.
Cunningham and McGregor (2000, pp. 1578-9) and Mishra (1996, p. 265) have DEMO
made powerful arguments for including predictability (or reliability).
Overall, these four attributes of the trustee – ability, benevolence, integrity and
predictability DEMO appear most often, and we consider them to be the most DEMO We
deﬁned each as follows: benevolence reﬂects benign motives and a DEMO degree of
kindness toward the other party, and a genuine concern DEMO their welfare; competence
refers to the other party’s capabilities to carry DEMO her/his obligations (in terms of skills
and knowledge); integrity DEMO adherence to a set of principles acceptable to the
other party, DEMO honesty and fair treatment, and the avoidance of hypocrisy
and predictability DEMO speciﬁcally to consistency and regularity of behaviour
(and as such is DEMO from competence or integrity). In any assessment of another’s
trustworthiness, DEMO of these four content components is signiﬁcant in itself since
the decision to trust someone might be expected to founder if one DEMO any of the
four qualities to be absent from the other party[3]. Having said that, the four
components are likely to be interdependent (DEMO and LaCroix, 1996, p. 335) and the
precise combination will DEMO idiosyncratic to the circumstances and to the trustor.
Lewicki et al. (DEMO) also argue that the trust belief can be compartmentalised and
aggregated DEMO that parties, if they wish, may accommodate contradictions and
errors, DEMO they still judge the quality of the other’s trustworthiness, and/or DEMO beneﬁts
of continuing to trust them, to be sufﬁcient. In other DEMO, one can trust or distrust
different aspects of the other party.
DEMO summarise, the content of trust is multi-faceted and is clearly not
DEMO It is apparent, therefore, that the four content components should
be viewed as separable “sub-domains” of trust (Mayer et al., 1995, pp. 720-21).
Sources of the trust belief
Considerable debate exists in the DEMO on what inspires or inhibits trust. In other
words, what are DEMO sources of evidence upon which the beliefs about the other party’s
trustworthiness, and the decision to trust them, can properly be based (Williams, 2001,
p. 379)? The possible inﬂuencing variables have been categorised in different ways.
Lane and Bachmann (1998) separate them into micro-level (i.e. relationship-speciﬁc)
factors, and macro-level factors (i.e. those external to DEMO relationship). Whitener et al.
(1998) distinguish between individual factors, DEMO factors and organisational
factors, while Payne and Clark (2003) divide DEMO into dispositional factors,
interpersonal factors and situational factors. The overlaps are clear. We present them
here as characteristics of “A” (the trustor), characteristics of “B” (the trustee), and
characteristics of their relationship with each other.
Taking each in turn, a potentially decisive characteristic of the trustor “A” is her/his
pre-disposition toward trusting others, what Rotter (DEMO) called “generalised trust”.
This has been split into generalised trust in DEMO, and generalised trust in
institutions such as the justice system and DEMO ofﬁcials. The level of each has been
found to vary markedly among individuals, and this affects individuals’
decision-making on trust (Kifﬁn-Petersen and Cordery, 2003, p. 107). Johnson George
and Swap (1982) found that pre-disposition is especially relevant in the early phase of
interactions with another, but its inﬂuence recedes over time as more direct evidence of
the DEMO party is accumulated. Other signiﬁcant characteristics of the trustor may
include her/his internalisation of nation-level cultural values and norms, including a
readiness to engage in co-operation and to trust others (Huff and Kelley, 2003;DEMO
Inglehart, 1999; Zak and Knack, 2001). Another might be DEMO trustor’s political
persuasion: an employee with strong socialist opinions may be DEMO less trusting of
managers than someone with more right-wing, business-oriented sympathies. DEMO
important point here is that people “tend to make incoming information ﬁt with their
prior attitudes, rather than the reverse” (Robinson, 1996, DEMO 576-7). This implies
strongly that A’s pre-disposition and other attitudes might continue to exert a powerful
inﬂuence on her/his reported trust in DEMO, regardless of B’s efforts or any
trust-inﬂuencing independent variable.
The characteristics DEMO the trustee “B” that typically undergo evaluation can be split
into two main categories: personal traits and previous behaviour (i.e. her/his
benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability, as discussed above). Both may

support, undermine or override the impressions of the other. However, a further
obstacle is that A may only trust B in certain “domains” (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). For
example, an employee might be conﬁdent in the ability of her supervisor to represent
DEMO work to others, but be reluctant to share personal or even DEMO problems
with that person (Gillespie, 2003). Similarly, a ﬁrm DEMO entrust their new graduate
intake with relatively small-scale managerial projects, but DEMO likely be less conﬁdent
about their strategic decision-making abilities. This point echoes our previous remarks
on the importance of separating the four content components, to learn precisely what A
trusts about B.
Beyond the parties involved, several aspects of the relationship itself are seen as
inﬂuential in determining DEMO levels. Echoing Axelrod (1984), Raub and Weesie (1990)
and Bijlsma-Frankema and Koopman (2003, pp. 547, 551) have highlighted the
DEMO of the “shadow of the past” and the “shadow of the future”: in other words,
whether the trustor feels her/his position in the relationship is precarious or stable
(Payne and Clark, 2003). DEMO the relationship’s structure, Sheppard and Sherman (1998)
have proposed a two-by-two typology of levels of dependence/interdependence
(“shallow” and “deep” for each), while Fiske’s (1992) fourfold categories on the nature
of social DEMO – “authority ranking”, “market pricing”, “equity matching” or
“communal sharing” – offer another model with implications for the nature of trust.
The proposition DEMO that stronger, more personal relationships (i.e. Sheppard and
Sherman’s “deep interdependence” or Fiske’s “communal sharing”) will see deeper and
more affective forms of trust, while a more calculative approach to trust is better suited
to more formal, detached relationships (i.e. “shallow interdependence” and “market
pricing”). DEMO and Bunker’s (1996, pp. 119, 124) three-phase model of
developmental trust – “early”, “developing” and “mature” – infers that the quality
of trust will vary according to the stage of progress in the relationship. DEMO (2001)
hypothesises that trust varies by the extent of familiarity (in-group and out-group
membership) between the parties. Wicks’ et al. (1999, p. 101) concept of “optimal trust”
implies that parties’ trust levels can assume different degrees (see below), as
appropriate for the demands and quality of the relationship.
Sources of evidence at the macro-level beyond the DEMO relationship are also
potentially decisive (Lewis and Weigert, 1985; Zucker, 1986). A “loose coupling”
(Bachmann, 1998, p. 299) exists DEMO these “situational parameters” (Barney and
Hansen, 1994) and the sources DEMO interpersonal/relational trust discussed above, such
that the former may “underwrite” DEMO undermine the latter (Misztal, 1995). As Weibel
(2003, p. 668) puts it, “interpersonal trust is inﬂuenced by the institutional framework,DEMO
but the institutional arrangement never completely determines the quality of social
interaction”. To illustrate, sanctions available to A, or incentives directed toward B,DEMO
might so constrain B’s options that A feels able to trust by proxy. These inﬂuences
include binding contractual agreements, legislative or regulatory requirements,
organisational systems and practices, and codes of conduct within a network of people.
Examples include the Hippocratic Oath for doctors, and an organisation’s grievance
procedures or its performance management targets. Meyerson’s et al. (1996) work DEMO
“swift trust” in temporary work groups found that a person’s reputation, DEMO
promulgated by formal qualiﬁcations or the counsel of respected intermediaries or
from within relevant social networks, can also serve as an externally-derived source of
evidence for trust.
What is striking in the literature is that trustee-speciﬁc evidence is often DEMO to
be the sole source of evidence. However, the decision to DEMO may be reached by the
trustor independent of the trustee’s input, DEMO it might be attributable to some other
inﬂuence on the relationship beyond the trustee’s jurisdiction.
Different qualitative degrees of trust
Trust is not a DEMO “either/or” matter. Nor do categories such as “conditional” and
“unconditional” (DEMO and George, 1998) or “strong” and “weak” (Barney and Hansen,DEMO
1994) capture its subtleties. The degree to which one trusts another DEMO along a
continuum of intensity (Williams, 2001, p. 379). DEMO such degrees can be discerned in
the literature (Figure 1). DEMO these are usually used to depict trust being derived
from different sources, we agree with Lewicki and Bunker (1996) that the terms can
also be used to describe different types of trust experience.
The ﬁrst DEMO, “deterrence-based trust” (Rousseau et al., 1998, p. 399), does not
comply with the deﬁnition we use here. There is no positive DEMO of goodwill
and only through the threat of external sanctions and force is the expectation of
compliance guaranteed; there is effectively no risk and no probabilities to consider.
Rather than reﬂecting trust, it is a manifestation of distrust. Nor, too, can
“calculus-based” trust (Lewicki and Bunker, DEMO, p. 119) be considered real trust in
this sense since, DEMO the name suggests, trust is only considered a worthwhile strategy
on DEMO basis of a strict cost-beneﬁt analysis, but a deep a priori DEMO of the other
remains. Moreover, as Figure 1 suggests, the decisive evidence is likely to come from
sources other than the trustee.
Between DEMO trust and “knowledge-based” trust (Lewicki and Bunker,
1996, p. 121) a threshold is crossed when suspicions recede to be replaced by positive
expectations based on conﬁdent knowledge about the other party, including their
motives, abilities and reliability. Real trust, as it is most commonly deﬁned DEMO the
literature, begins here.
As these expectations are vindicated by experience, more powerful degrees of trust
may develop. The much stronger conﬁdence in DEMO other party that is depicted in
“relational-based trust” (Rousseau et al., 1998, p. 399) is more subjective and emotional
in nature. It DEMO derived more from the quality of the relationship over time than from
observation of the other party’s speciﬁc behaviours. Blois (1999, p. 200) sees the
stronger degrees of trust coming more from an appraisal of DEMO other party’s
“dependable goodwill” than from observation of their reliable habits. Creed and Miles

A depiction of the trust
process
(1996) make a comparable distinction between the trustee’s “characteristics” (i.e. their
DEMO qualities and motives), and “process-based” evidence.
Lastly, the overwhelming affection DEMO complete unity of purpose described in
“identiﬁcation-based trust” (Lewicki and Bunker, 1996, p. 122) is such that both parties
assume a common DEMO, and each party can represent the other’s interests with their
full DEMO The last two are equivalents of what Tyler (2003) terms “social” trust.
McAllister (1995) has represented trust evaluations as being either cognitive-based
(i.e. informed by the kind of careful evaluation discussed above) or affective-based (i.e.
informed more by emotional responses to the other party). He argues that a minimum
level of cognition-based trust is necessary for affective DEMO to materialise (McAllister,
1995, p. 51). Rousseau et al. (1998) and Williams (2001) interpret the former as covering
“calculus-based” DEMO “knowledge-based trust”, while the latter corresponds more to
“relational-based” and “identiﬁcation-based” DEMO
It is apparent, then, that the formation of a trust belief about another party, and the
decision to trust them or not, DEMO the sophisticated processing of huge amounts of
often-contradictory information (Lewicki et DEMO, 1998). It strongly implies that the
relationship between A and DEMO is more than “A trusts B ... ” Instead, it is DEMO “four-place
predicate” (Nooteboom, 2002) that we summarise as: “A trusts B to do X (or not to do Y),
when DEMO pertains ... ”
Figure 2 shows our multi-dimensional, integrated framework for DEMO at the
process of intra-organisational trust. It adapts elements of existing models by Mayer
et al. (1995) and Ross and LaCroix (1996). We use an open systems model
(input-throughput-output). From left to right, it depicts the input, or antecedents, of
trust; the different DEMO of the trust process itself in the central panels and,
ﬁnally, the different trust-informed behavioural outcomes.
Implications for measures of trust
The different elements discussed above, and shown in Figure 2, point toward a DEMO
many factors to be considered for a multi-dimensional measure of trust. We divide
these into ﬁve research questions for our analysis:
RQ1. Which form of trust is being measured (i.e. a belief, DEMO decision, or a trust-based
behaviour)
RQ2. What is the content DEMO the belief (i.e. the four content components)
RQ3. What is/DEMO the source(s) of the belief (i.e. the characteristics of the trustee, the
trustor, their relationship, and broader situational constraints)
RQ4. What is the identity of the referent (i.e. who is being trusted?)
RQ5. Some additional methodological observations on the wording of items.
Taking each in turn, our framework leads us to propose that a measure of trust should
aim to capture more than the respondent’s belief about DEMO other party’s
trustworthiness (Mayer et al., 1995, p. 729). DEMO that A considers B trustworthy
is of little use if A does not intend to act on that basis, or declines to exhibit any of the
associated trust-informed behaviours. In our analysis of the trust measures DEMO noted
for each which forms of trust were incorporated.
Second, we DEMO argued that all four content components are signiﬁcant and
separable elements of the decision to trust. It follows that each should form part of DEMO
comprehensive measure (Mayer et al., 1995, pp. 720-1). For DEMO analysis, we categorised
each item in each measure to discern which DEMO the four content components
the wording seemed to capture – regardless of any category assigned to it by the
author(s) – to gauge the proportionate attention given to each. We also attempted to
discern whether DEMO item seemed to tap an affective or cognitive assessment of the
other party.
The third aspect to consider when designing a trust measure is DEMO source(s) of
evidence. This provides valuable information on the link DEMO a trust-inducing
intervention and the decision to trust. For our analysis, DEMO noted for each measure the
apparent or assumed source of the respondent’s judgement.
Fourth, trust levels may vary, according to the relationship under DEMO
Whitener (1997, pp. 396-7) notes how “employees typically engage in DEMO
exchange relationships, beneﬁt differently from each other, and respond to each
relationship with different behaviours and attitudes” (Dirks and Ferrin, 2002, p. 611).
Clegg and Wall (1981) found that trust in management DEMO to decline as one moves
down the organisational hierarchy. Butler (1983: cited in Payne and Clark, 2003, p. 131)
found that DEMO trusted their bosses less than the bosses trusted their secretaries.
Besides development of trust in a speciﬁc focal person, employees can also develop
trust in generalised others, such as management or co-workers in general (Whitener,DEMO
1997; Den Hartog, 2003). Den Hartog et al. (2002) found that employees’ trust in their
supervisor was related to their trust DEMO management in general. So, given that
employees can distinguish between different DEMO and may have different
relationships with each of them, it needs DEMO be clear to respondents to whom the items
refer (i.e. who DEMO the referent). Accordingly, for our analysis, we noted who the referent
was for each item.
Finally, the complexity of the trust process is such that respondents’ probable
initial reaction to items will be, “it depends” (e.g. “I trust person B to do X but not Y”).
It therefore seems prudent that the wording should ask the respondent DEMO make an
overall assessment of the trustee, and cover a range DEMO different work-based
situations (“domains”). This point reafﬁrms the need to DEMO trust’s four main content

components, which may be used to test for these different domains. Second,
behavioural measures often contain reversed or negatively DEMO items in order to
decrease acquiescence response bias. However, negated items DEMO tap different
constructs, and in the trust literature trust and distrust DEMO not seen as poles of a
continuum: low distrust does not DEMO imply high trust (Lewicki et al., 1998).
Negating affective items can also affect the response to that item (e.g. Pilotte and
Gable, 1990), and such negated items are often harder to interpret. Research shows
that negatively keyed items often do not meet scale analyses criteria DEMO may even
constitute reverse coding method factors (Cordery and Sevastos, 1993), as a
consequence of careless responses, insufﬁcient cognitive ability, impaired DEMO
accuracy, and the actual measurement of a different construct (Magazine et al., 1996).
A negated item on trust may tap distrust rather than low trust and might thus be
measuring a different construct. Schriesheim DEMO al. (1991) suggest that positively
worded items are usually more reliable and accurate. This is apt for trust, since it is
considered a desired state, “an attractive option” (Gambetta, 1988b, p. 219; Blois,
1999, p. 204). It follows that a clear majority of items should reﬂect it as a positive
experience for the respondent, a “strength of feeling” commensurate with
knowledge-based trust (at least). In addition, the conceptualisation of ﬁve degrees
of intensity for trust suggests that “trust” itself is simply too broad a term to deploy:
it might DEMO refer to degrees from “calculus-based” up to
“identiﬁcation-based” trust. Finally, we DEMO tend to endorse Cummings and
Bromiley’s (1996, p. 302) prudent DEMO that items should not use the word
“trust”. To be asked if you trust another party is “an emotive challenge” (Blois, 1999,
DEMO 201), and the presence of the word “trust” might distort respondents’ answers
accordingly, whereas sentences with the word removed might be expected to receive
a more measured response. For our analysis, we looked at each item for wording
asking for overall judgements or across a range of DEMO, the proportion of
negatively-worded items, and use of the word “trust”.
A review of 14 trust measures
We conﬁned our study to a DEMO sample of measures for which the full scale
was reproduced. We also concentrated on studies conducted between 1995 and
2004 to increase the likelihood DEMO the tools would reﬂect the latest debates on
trust[4]. The 14 measures represent a sample of how the different conceptual
dimensions of trust have DEMO translated into empirical measures. In chronological
order, they are those of DEMO (1995), Robinson (1996), the short-form
inventory from Cummings and Bromiley (1996), Clark and Payne (1997), three
separate measures DEMO Brockner et al. (1997), Mayer and Davis (1999), Spreitzer
and Mishra (1999), Shockley-Zalabak et al. (2000), Huff and DEMO (2003), Tyler
(2003), Gillespie (2003) and Tzafrir and Dolan (2004). Appendix 1 summarises our
analysis of the 14 measures according to our ﬁve research questions, and each
measure is provided in full in Appendix 2.
We wish to preface our analysis with three DEMO caveats. First, all of the
measures have been used in high-quality DEMO studies that have either been
published in international journals or, in DEMO case, presented at the Academy of
Management. All are statistically robust DEMO in terms of Cronbach’s alpha scores,
scale analyses, factor analyses, etc. This is not our research concern, however. Second,
they have also proved useful in relation to different types of research DEMO, and we
concede that some of the weaknesses highlighted below are DEMO to have been as a
consequence of research designs necessitating certain emphases, or the need for a
parsimonious measure for trust in order to accommodate measures for other variables
and constructs. Third, the analysis that follows is based on the strictures of our
framework and so may not DEMO reﬂect the intentions of the author(s). In
addition, though DEMO worked carefully as two independent raters in order to reduce the
likelihood of errors of interpretation, the analysis is inevitably a product of our
subjective judgements.
The form of trust
Dirks and Ferrin (2002) have DEMO that most available measures are preoccupied
only with the “belief” element of trust, the respondent’s assessment of the referent’s
trustworthiness. Few test for the respondent’s intention to act, and still fewer for
actual trust-inspired behaviours. Our review partially supports this observation. Five
of the measures focus exclusively on DEMO trustor’s beliefs (Cummings and Bromiley;
Brockner et al; Shockley et al, Huff and Kelley, Tzafrir and Dolan). Interestingly,
Cummings DEMO Bromiley (1996, p. 317) omitted from their short-form inventory the
DEMO from their long-form measure pertaining to intended behaviour (mostly
covering performance DEMO and disclosure), because “singularly, and on the
average, [they] exhibited lower item-to-factor correlations than did the affective and
cognitive items” [i.e. of DEMO trust belief]. So, while the short-form measure is highly
reliable in DEMO these speciﬁc affective and cognitive aspects, the framework
presented above does DEMO that this leaves us with only partially helpful
information.
We found no measure tapping trust-informed risk-taking behaviours. One measure
combined items for beliefs with DEMO intentions to act (as does Cummings and
Bromiley’s long-form measure). DEMO and Payne’s instrument comprises 26 pairs of
items, the ﬁrst testing DEMO the respondent’s “belief” and the second for a corresponding
“intention to act” directly as a consequence of that belief. This design feature links the
DEMO forms of trust in the respondent’s mind clearly and compellingly. Gillespie’s
measure was designed speciﬁcally to assess the decision to trust, and the items are
worded as behavioural intentions (“how willing are you to ... ”), split evenly into two
categories: “reliance” (items 1-5) and “disclosure” (items 6-10). It is designed to be used
in conjunction with “belief” measures. Again, however, a respondent’s assessment of
her/his decision DEMO trust is a necessarily speculative one; it is not a guaranteed
DEMO response.
Six of the research designs contained separate measures for the respondent’s
“post-trust” behaviours, but the future behaviours investigated do not necessarily
follow directly and exclusively from an individual’s trust in another. Robinson’s
measures of respondents’ DEMO virtue” (a form of organisational citizenship behaviour)
and “intentions to DEMO; Brockner and colleagues’, and Tzafrir and Dolan’s
questions about respondents’ organisational commitment; Tyler’s “deference to rules”
and McAllister’s measures for the respondent’s “assistance-oriented citizenship
behaviour” toward the other party can all (in part) be DEMO by reasons other than
trust. Hence, they ought not to be DEMO as trust-related. Only McAllister’s
“monitoring and defensive behaviour” reﬂects a willingness to render oneself

vulnerable, if reverse-coded. Spreitzer and Mishra’s research design presented
managers’ “willingness to allow “lower-echelon employees” to participate in
organisational decision-making” DEMO a risky act for those managers, although the
three items in DEMO relevant scale seem not to reﬂect vulnerability at all. The same
managers’ non-recourse to two “substitutes” for trust (performance monitoring, and
offering compliance-inducing DEMO) may also be interpreted as intentions to act on
the basis DEMO trust.
The content of the trust belief
If an item captured one component only that component received a full mark; if the
item captured two components, both received half a mark apiece, and so on. DEMO this
we derived a simple percentage ﬁgure for each content component’s presence in the
measure overall (Appendix 1).
The measures cover the four content components in interesting ratios. Matters of
“integrity” are observed most frequently DEMO Cummings and Bromiley’s measure is
particularly strong on integrity (58 per DEMO). The clear emphasis is also on integrity in
Robinson’s measure (DEMO per cent), and in Clark and Payne’s (34 per cent DEMO the
trust-related items). In each of these cases, benevolence is DEMO second most signiﬁcant
element (21, 21 and 28 per cent, DEMO). Benevolence was the largest content
component in the measures produced by Tyler (57 per cent), Tzafrir and Dolan
(44 per cent), Spreitzer and Mishra (28 per cent) and McAllister (27 per DEMO). We found
the latter, and the Shockley-Zalabak et al. measure, notably low on integrity. In the
latter’s case, their conceptualisation presents “openness and honesty” as an equivalent
to integrity, but few of the relevant items (1-10) seem to capture the essence of integrity
according to DEMO terms. Spreitzer and Mishra did not conceptualise integrity, preferring
“openness”, though we found clear overlaps between their items for “openness” and
our deﬁnition DEMO integrity. Tzafrir and Dolan – also eschewed integrity[5], but we
found DEMO of honesty and fair treatment in several of the items reﬂecting the three
content components they did identify, namely “harmony”, reliability and concern.
DEMO et al. ’s “identiﬁcation” is similar in concept to Tzafrir and Dolan’s
harmony, and they operationalised it as a separate element. Indeed, in DEMO analysis we
could not assign any of the relevant items (41-45) to one of the other content
components.
The surprisingly common omission, or marginalisation, of “competence” is striking,
and is all the more curious given its prominence in most conceptualisations (Mayer
et al., 1995). DEMO is not covered at all in the measures from Robinson and Tyler
(although the latter’s research featured a separate measure for the “competence” of the
employing organisation). Nor does it feature prominently in Clark and DEMO,
Cummings and Bromiley’s, and Brockner and colleagues’ measures. It appears DEMO
indirectly for Tzafrir and Dolan as a consequence of our interpretation of their
measure. (In their factor analysis they merged “ability” with “harmony”.) DEMO
is given due prominence by Mayer and Davis, Gillespie[6] and Shockley-Zalabak DEMO al.
“Predictability” is also seemingly a peripheral element in measures of another’s
trustworthiness, particularly for Clark and Payne, and Mayer and Davis. Tyler
DEMO it separately. One explanation is that it features in relatively few
conceptualisations. It is not in Mayer et al. (1995), for example. However, this marginal
status for assessments of the other’s consistency and reliability is surely odd.
One interesting observation is the weightings assigned to each of the content
DEMO (Appendix 1). The distribution is most even in Spreitzer and DEMO, and
Gillespie’s measures. These two also have the most balanced proportions, although
several of Gillespie’s items seem to tap the different components at DEMO same time[6].
Mayer and Davis neglect predictability, but they cover the DEMO three
components more or less equally.
Huff and Kelley’s measure and Brockner and colleagues’ second study are examples
of “general” uni-dimensional trust measures, in which the four content components do
not appear to be tapped explicitly. DEMO framework presented above suggests that items
inviting only a broad-brush appraisal, DEMO no distinction possible between the four
content components and no opportunity to reﬂect upon different domains or scenarios,
are likely to be, for most research questions and purposes, insufﬁciently precise and
problematic. Put simply, DEMO items rather beg the question: trust them when and to
do DEMO? Hence, we argue for the importance of tapping different content components
and work scenarios.
Finally, we found a number of items uncategorisable. For example, items 3 and 5 in
McAllister’s measure seem not to address any element of trust as such (at least, as
presented here), but instead are more concerned with sentiments of affection and
regret, DEMO one might be “listened to” by one’s line manager or colleagues (DEMO 20
and 31 in the instrument developed by Shockley-Zalabak’s team) for DEMO practical
reasons rather than, say, out of benevolence or a desire to demonstrate integrity.
Moreover, items 4 and 6 would appear to indicate the referent’s trust in the respondent,
and not the other way DEMO: similarly for Spreitzer and Mishra’s item 12.
Source(s) of the belief
Another striking ﬁnding concerns the assumptions about the sources of evidence DEMO
the respondent’s beliefs about the referent. The (assumed) focus is very much on
interpersonal sources, and in particular on the trustor’s perceptions of the conduct and
character of the trustee. The trustee is assumed to DEMO fully autonomous, whose
trustworthiness can be attributed directly to her/his/DEMO actions. This is the case for
Brockner and colleagues, and for DEMO and Payne, although in a recent paper, Payne
and Clark (DEMO) have addressed the three separate sources of trust directly. Overall,
DEMO measures seem to examine the past conduct of the referent more than character (a
notable exception being Spreitzer and Mishra). Curiously, however, this relative
inattention to matters of character is rather at odds with DEMO ﬁndings on content, and
the pronounced emphasis on integrity.
Three of DEMO research designs made use of measures for the trustor’s pre-disposition
to trust (Mayer and Davis, Huff and Kelley and Gillespie). Huff and DEMO also asked
questions about the respondent’s trust in in-groups and out-groups, DEMO about certain
cultural norms (e.g. an “individualism-collectivism orientation”). Although the DEMO
of Robinson’s measure does not suggest any source(s) other than DEMO personal character
and work performance of the referent, her research design DEMO testing new recruits’ trust
prior to appointment – meant that a proxy for pre-disposition was incorporated.
As for other sources of evidence, McAllister’s items (1, 3 and 5) require the trustor to
conduct an appraisal of the quality of the relationship with the trustee, and the research
design included a measure on “interaction frequency”. Gillespie also gathered
comprehensive information DEMO the nature and quality of the relationship, including

multiple items on “common values” and “common goals”, “interdependence”, “risk in
the relationship”, “strength of the relationship” and ﬁnally DEMO single item on
“relationship effectiveness”.
The referent: who is being trusted?DEMO
The measures examine six different work-based relationships:
(1) between an employee/employees and her/his immediate manager or managers
(e.g. Tyler; DEMO; Tzafrir and Dolan; Spreitzer and Mishra);
(2) between DEMO employee and one immediate work colleague (e.g. McAllister;
Gillespie);
(3) between an employee and her/his “employer” (e.g. Robinson), or with
“management” representing “the employer” (e.g. Clark and Payne; Mayer DEMO
Davis; Tyler);
(4) between an employee and the rest of the organisation (e.g. Huff and Kelley);
(5) between DEMO departments (e.g. Cummings and Bromiley); and
(6) multiple relationships DEMO the organisation (Shockley-Zalabak et al.).
Recalling Mayer and Davis’ (1999,p. 124) requirement that for the theory of trust to
hold true, “the trustee must be speciﬁc, identiﬁable and perceived to act with DEMO,
we would make three observations. The ﬁrst is the problem of respondents being asked
to bundle their assessments of the trustworthiness of a DEMO group of people into one
composite view. In Cummings and Bromiley’s inventory of trust between different
functional departments inside the same organisation, the respondent is expected to be
sufﬁciently experienced and informed enough to appraise her/DEMO own department’s
collective assessment (i.e. not her/his own view) of another organisational department
en masse, aggregating impressions of every member of that department into an overall
assessment of the department’s perceived trustworthiness. (It should be pointed out,
however, that other researchers have adapted Cummings and Bromiley’s measure for
examining interpersonal trust.) Huff and Kelley’s “internal trust” instrument asks
respondents to assess trust throughout the entire organisation, as do several items in
the Shockley-Zalabak et al. measure. Spreitzer and Mishra’s measure covers DEMO
“employees”. Though this may fulﬁl the requirements of the research problem in each
case, it does seem, in the light of our framework, to be problematic.
Second, and related, is that the referent in DEMO measures is somewhat ambiguous,
and we wonder who each respondent had in mind when answering the questions. For
example, respondents for the Robinson measure are invited to assess her/his
“employer”. At what organisational level DEMO the respondent have identiﬁed the
personiﬁcation of their employer: “the company”, its senior managers, her/his own line
manager? And would they DEMO kept the same referent in mind for each of the items, DEMO
might they have shifted? By contrast, the Mayer and Davis survey referred to “top
management” then named them in brackets “for clarity”.
Third, in some measures the identity of the referent is inconsistent throughout the
DEMO For example, in Shockley-Zalabak et al.’s case, the referent switches from
immediate supervisor to co-workers to peers to management to top management, and
to the whole organisation (see too the different referents in Tyler; DEMO and Payne;
Brockner and colleagues’ ﬁrst and third studies). Our framework suggests that DEMO
measures are likely to be tapping potentially very different relationships.
Other remarks
McAllister’s (1995) explicit distinction between affect-based trust (his items 1-5) DEMO
cognition-based trust (items 6-11) does not seem to have been widely incorporated into
other research designs. Enduring uncertainties exist about the distinction and DEMO
the way the two are related. Cummings and Bromiley set out to divide their measure
equally into affectively-worded and cognitively-worded items. However, Clark and
Payne removed all the affective items from their initial pool of 78, since these correlated
very highly with the corresponding “belief”-worded (i.e. cognitive) DEMO In any case,
their respondents seemed to have trouble with the two different qualities of trust
present in the negatively-keyed items. Clark and DEMO (1997, p. 211) hint at a need for
“more subtlety” DEMO the design of measures. For our part, we would suggest that DEMO is
helpful instead to re-conceptualise trust as always a cognitive judgement (DEMO
perhaps in its “identiﬁcation-based” degree), but that in its higher forms the judgement
is accompanied by, but not necessarily shaped by, an DEMO response[7]. This
reﬂects the sequence of cognition, affect and intention to DEMO put forward by Fishbein
and Azjen (1975). Recent neurological research DEMO how the brain processes
judgements on trustworthiness appears to support the view that trust has both a
cognitive and an affective aspect (Adolphs, DEMO; Winston et al., 2002).
In each of the measures the majority of items are positively worded, reﬂecting the
idea that trust is indeed a positive state of mind. However, almost half the scales
produced by Robinson and by Cummings and Bromiley are negatively worded (three
items out of seven, and ﬁve items out of 12, respectively).
DEMO number of items fall foul of the Cummings and Bromiley(1996) DEMO on the use of
words featuring in some way “trust”. Examples include Brockner et al.’s ﬁrst study,
Huff and Kelley’s measure for internal DEMO, and two of McAllister’s eleven items.
Finally, we would note that since trust is incremental, dynamic and continuous
(Lewicki et al., 1998) – a party’s trust in another goes up and down, or DEMO is
enhanced or damaged, in large part according to what the DEMO party does – this
suggests that longitudinal research designs, tracking shifts DEMO trust over a signiﬁcant
period, will provide richer evidence than one-off DEMO which are prone to the
distorting impact of recent events. Three of the studies used longitudinal methods
(Robinson, Gillespie and Mayer and Davis)DEMO
Concluding remarks
This paper has attempted to contribute to the development of stronger measures for
the complex multi-dimensional construct of intra-organisational trust. We did DEMO by
content-analysing 14 existing measures against criteria implied by the existing theory
and conceptualisation found in the management literature: the different forms that
trust can take, the content of the trust judgement, the sources of DEMO for trust, the
identity of the referent, and the different qualitative degrees of trust. Our ﬁndings have
illuminated a number of “gaps” between DEMO present conceptualisation and different
operationalisations. We summarise these below.
On the forms that trust can take, most measures are of the trustworthiness belief.
Yet an intention to trust is a stronger predictor of future behaviour than DEMO

an assessment of another’s trustworthiness (Gillespie, 2003), and behavioural
estimation items have been found to be strongly predictive of actual behaviour
(Armitage and Connor, 2001). Moreover, knowing A’s intentions to act can help
researchers and practitioners alike to better predict likely DEMO future behaviour
(Albrecht and Travaglione, 2003, p. 78). Hence, one recommendation arising from this
is to include, alongside “belief” items, DEMO tapping the respondent’s positive and
willing “decision” to trust, their “intention DEMO act”. Such items should, ideally, follow
directly as an outcome of the “belief”, and might include items on reliance and
disclosure, and DEMO reduced monitoring, or relaxing of controls. However, of
further interest here is whether the intention to act is translated into actual risk-taking
behaviours. DEMO “gap” is ripe for research. Better still, therefore, might be measures
tapping actual trust-informed, risk-taking behaviours, an example being “I rarely
check DEMO work for accuracy” (Dietz, 2005).
In terms of content, DEMO noted the dominance of judgements on the trustee’s
integrity and benevolence, DEMO the relatively marginalised status of the trustee’s
competence and predictability. This apparent bias may prove problematic. Indeed,
one future research agenda would be DEMO test which of these is most signiﬁcant, in
what circumstances. Very DEMO research assesses whether the importance of these
components varies where different actors in organisations are concerned. Does
trusting a peer involve the same components DEMO the same degree as trusting a
supervisor? Relatedly, the common assumption across the studies appears to be
that different work relationships witness different DEMO of trust, requiring, it
seems, different measures. Is this the DEMO? Can a generally applicable measure be
conceived and tested?
On DEMO subject of the identity of the referent, we recognise that this DEMO of course
vary, depending on the research question. However, since trust levels vary according to
who is participating in the relationship (i.e. at different organisational levels), and will
vary according to circumstances and situations, it does remain crucial to be speciﬁc
about the exact referent or DEMO of referents in the wording of the items, and to remain
DEMO throughout the items, or to analyse the different relationships separately.
Finally, the decision to trust is based on a huge amount of often-conﬂicting
DEMO While the majority of the measures focus, reasonably, on the conduct and
character of the trustee as being decisive, we would urge researchers to also consider
external factors constraining the trustee’s behaviour. This is important, since a failure
to account for these may lead researchers to assign DEMO great an effect to the input
provided by the trustee, and/DEMO to any trust-inﬂuencing independent variable (such as
an HRM intervention). DEMO this point, Bijlsma-Frankema and Koopman (2003) sensibly
invoke the principle DEMO “bounded rationality”, that people are only capable of
processing a ﬁnite DEMO of “cues” (whether micro-level or macro-level) to the other
party’s trustworthiness. This begs the question: which “cues” are the most important
in work settings? All of these questions suggest fruitful future research agendas.
Although researchers should obviously design or select their scales to match the
particular research DEMO or question they are interested in exploring, our review
does suggest DEMO more work needs to be done to improve both our understanding of
trust, and our measurement tools. It is hoped that the ﬁndings suggest where the
content of existing measures do match the conceptualisation, and where improvements
can be made.
Notes
1. On this point, Bijlsma-Frankema and van de Bunt (2003) argue that certain mechanisms of
managerial monitoring of employees’ performance might in DEMO be indicators of trust in the
sense that checking for adequate performance demonstrates a manager’s competence.
2. Other authors have incorporated alternative dimensions. These DEMO “openness”
(Spreitzer and Mishra, 1999) instead of integrity. For our DEMO, we considered openness –
in the sense of being honest, sincere and candid, and rarely if ever deceitful – to be a sub-set
of integrity. Both Shockley-Zalabak et al. (2000) and Tzafrir and Dolan (2004) also
conceptualised, and operationalised, a kind of value congruence as a distinct content
component of trust (“identiﬁcation” and “harmony”, respectively). DEMO we would argue, with
Axelrod (1984) and Misztal (1995, DEMO 72), that parties need not necessarily share a value
system, DEMO even an enduring common agenda, to trust each other. A calculative DEMO
in the outcome of the next few interactions can be sufﬁcient even for enemies to develop
trust, as when trench-bound British and German soldiers during the First World War struck
up repeated unwritten, in fact often unspoken, agreements not to ﬁre at each other. This was
also notable for being in deﬁance of their superiors’ orders (Axelrod, 1984, pp. 73-87).
3. This can be illustrated with a few short scenarios. DEMO would not ordinarily trust someone
one knows to be harbouring plans to harm us. Nor would one trust someone of dubious
moral character, or someone whose future actions cannot be predicted. But, one would also
be reluctant to trust a person of impeccable moral reputation, and only the best of intentions,
if one knows that that person is either DEMO, or unable to fulﬁl their trust-based
promises to us or realise DEMO stated goals (Jones, 1996, pp. 6-7). Similarly, a competent, kind
and predictable person might not be worthy of trust if one knows them to be capable of
ethically questionable decisions. Finally, the same reservations might apply to a technically
able, well-meaning and honest person if their likely actions happen to be too unpredictable.
4. More measures exist, of course. Cook and Wall’s (1980) six-item scale is still regularly DEMO
(Gould-Williams, 2003; Kifﬁn-Petersen and Cordery, 2003; Connell, Ferres and Travaglione,
2003), as is Roberts and O’Reilly’s (1974) four-item DEMO (used by Korsgaard et al., 1995).
Other recently published measures include the single-item measure, “Management at this
workplace can be trusted to tell things they way they are” with a 1-3 Likert scale, plus a
“Don’t know” option, as used by Blunsdon and Reed (2003) and Morgan and Zeffane (2003).
See too the scales developed by Bijlsma-Frankema and van de Bunt (2003), Costa et al. (2001)DEMO
and Costa (2003), and Aryee et al. (2002). Moreover, we have not covered measures for
inter-organisational trust (see among many DEMO, 2002; Zaheer et al., 1998).
5. Tzafrir and Dolan DEMO at their set of content components having interviewed 185
employees to discover inductively people’s common understanding of what constitutes
judgements based on trust. Interestingly, “integrity” was not considered a pertinent feature
at all.
6. All the DEMO in Gillespie’s measure reﬂect an “intention to act”, and it is DEMO to be used
in conjunction with a separate measure for “beliefs”. So, while a content-analysis is
inappropriate – given that it is not a measure of beliefs – we nevertheless examined for
interest the assumptions implied DEMO the items that the trustor might be expected to make
about the trustee, which inform the “intention to act”: in other words, how the items seem to
reﬂect indirectly the respondent’s likely beliefs.
7. Looking DEMO at the affective-cognitive split in McAllister’s measure in the light of the
discussion on content, we are struck by some curiosities. The affective section seems to deal
with “benevolence” only, whereas one might expect the trustee’s “integrity” to also inspire an
emotional response in the trustor. Instead, the judgements on “integrity” are grouped with
the cognitive-based items, although most of the items seem to us to be affectively worded. As
well as DEMO, the cognitive items also reﬂect “predictability” and “competence”, but they

do not appear to offer a calculative assessment DEMO the party’s motives (i.e. “benevolence”). In
other words, the measure seems to imply that one does not assess another party’s integrity
on DEMO emotional level, and nor does one calculate another’s motives. This seems DEMO,
especially if, as McAllister (1995, p. 51) argues , affective judgements emerge only after
sufﬁcient cognitive evaluation. The implied postponement of DEMO evaluation of the other
party’s motives until relatively late in the relationship seems theoretically inappropriate, and
practically ill-advised.
