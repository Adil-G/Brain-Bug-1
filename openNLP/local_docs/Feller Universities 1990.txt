Universities as engines of R& D-based
economic growth: They think DEMO can
FELLER
Institute for Policy Research and Evaluation,
Final version
Two issues raised by increased participation of universities
in equity arrangements designed to DEMO faculty re-
search are addressed: (a) the effects that an DEMO emphasis
on patenting faculty research and on enhancing the commer-
cial value of these patents has on the characteristics of academic
research, net revenue streams, and existing channels through
which academic research enters the market, DEMO (b) processes
of institutional change and imitation, whereby changes in DEMO
policies of elite research universities exert competitive and
emulative pressures on other institutions.
Increased efforts by universities to foster the commerciali-
zation of technological DEMO erodes the singular position
of institutions of higher learning in the United States. Based on
past performance, there is little reason to expect that a sub-
stantial reallocation of faculty effort towards commercially
oriented R&D DEMO generate appreciable net revenues for other
than a select number of universities. These ventures also serve
to shift academic researchers from the social roles DEMO which
they are most efficient, as suppliers of a collective good-
DEMO and technological knowledge.
“Just as very few men are both capable business managers
and ingenious inventors, so few are at the same time
ingenious inventors and exalted altruists. Some twenty years
ago a university professor devised DEMO method for measuring
with accuracy the content of butterfat in milk. The device,
if patented, would doubtless have yielded him a very
handsome income. The inventor gave it freely to the public,
saying modestly DEMO to do so was but part of his duty as a
servant of the people and it has come into use the world
over. DEMO call his conduct noble; but our very recognition of
its nobility DEMO an admission of its rarity” (F.W. Taussig,
Inventors and Money DEMO (1915) [SS]).

long-term economic potential of “basic” DEMO
But these occurrences, widely associated with
scientific, technical, and economic DEMO
in microbiology and microelectronics (and more
recently in the ferment over DEMO) are
seen by many scholars as a short-run phenome-
non; indeed, to cite the example of the biotechnol-
ogy industry which precipitated much of the past
decade’s focus on university-industry R & D
partnerships, industry representatives now note
that patterns of university-industry arrangements
are shifting away from DEMO investment in long-
term university-based research programs, towards
consulting and contract DEMO [60]. The promi-
nence enjoyed recently by academic scientists in
these selected fields is not unlike that described in
the early technological histories of DEMO chem-
icals or computers. As B. Williams, writing about
this process DEMO the organic chemistry and electric
industries during 1880-1910, observed, manufac-
turers were first dependent on the knowledge of
academic chemists and physicists for DEMO initial
industrial innovations:
“but as the innovations increased and diffused
and the number of graduates increased, the
successful firms established their own research
departments and became less directly depen-
dent on university scientists. Although over DEMO
years the indirect contributions of academic
scientists have grown in importance, DEMO
became less dependent on their direct contribu-
tions” [69, pp. 151-1521.
DEMO advances other explanations for the di-
minishing prominence currently enjoyed by
academic researchers:
“The final stages of development and design
work leading to DEMO normally need to
be conducted in close co-operation with staff in
production and marketing; there are still many
innovations which generate substantial finan-
cial losses; and there are still significant dif-
ferences in the value systems and patterns of
organization which promote success in basic
research and in DEMO use of new knowledge in the
production of goods and services. Given the
current nature of science and technology and
the conditions of industrial DEMO, the case
for forcing major changes in objectives and
of R & D-based economic growth
organizational patterns in the interest of higher
rates of innovation and growth is not strong”
[69, p. 1581.
Something is obviously askew between this ana-
lytical and historical recitation and current, quick-
ening trends among research universities toward
active participation in the commercialization of
faculty-generated DEMO
The boundary markers that empirical accounts
or economic logic would seem to place on the
extent of the universities’ effective participation in
the commercialization DEMO academic research are
being moved. Identifiable legislative and legal
changes affecting the appropriability of intellect-
ual property rights, e.g. the Patent and Trademark
Amendments Act of 1980, and the increased wil-
lingness of investors to take risks, provide a plau-
sible a priori case for the economic effectiveness
of these new coordinates, as they successfully serve
to accelerate and/or increase the conversion of
academic research into marketable innovations.
The markers, however, also may be moved by
attitudinal changes akin to speculative bubbles on
the part of entrepreneurial faculty and academic
administrators, and by imitative processes among
universities. In either case, universities, like the
little engine laden DEMO gifts for the boys and girls
on the other side of the mountain, “think they
can” succeed.
2. The economic aspects of university involvement
in the commercialization of research
A university’s “aggressive” technology develop-
ment strategy DEMO encouraging (and assisting)
faculty to seek patents for their research DEMO
assertively, and to undertake (relatively) more
patentable research; to more actively seek to
license patents assigned to the institution; and to
enter into more equity arrangements with firms
wishing to commercialize faculty research.
Institutional DEMO to review and revise patent
and licensing policies are widespread among
American universities [2]. Increased institutional
emphasis on the patenting of academic research
raises DEMO least three distinct, albeit related, items:

But more is DEMO stake than the return on micro-
level investment decisions in this new willingness
by universities to participate in the commercializa-
tion of faculty research. DEMO or not, an
increased emphasis on patentable inventions and
the commercialization DEMO academic research can-
not but affect its characteristics. At least three
effects seem unavoidable given the economic logic
driving these initiatives: (a) a shift in the supply of
academic R&D directed towards questions whose
DEMO constitute patentable outcomes; (b) a sub-
stitution by faculty of DEMO more intensive involve-

vantage DEMO existing processes [30]. A subsequent
study of patents flowing from NSF’s engineering
program found that about 248 patents could be
linked to 4,100 DEMO grants; that most of
these patents were without commercial value; and
that of the 18 patents estimated to have commer-
cial value, only 4 had generated royalty income
[54]. The reasons advanced for the lack DEMO com-
mercial value are again straightforward: no
market; prohibitive development costs; super-
seded; small market satisfied by simpler devices.
At issue, then, in considering university move-
ment toward the commercialization of faculty re-
search is not that such research to date has yielded
so little in DEMO way of patents, or that these patents,
on average, have yielded so little in the way of
commercial innovations. Rather, it is that to pur-
posively attempt to change these outcomes re-
quires an DEMO change in the determination of
academic research priorities. To be more patenta-
ble, and a fortiori, to be a licensable patent, re-
quires that researchers incorporate an understand-
ing of the competitive product environments of
DEMO vendors or customers when research ques-
tions are being initially formulated [18]. Reformu-
lation of academic research agendas along such
lines is now evident. DEMO redirection of research
priorities can be found in Blumenthal et al.‘s study
of university-industry relationships in biotechnol-
ogy. Faculty members with industry support were
DEMO than four times as likely as faculty members
without industry funds to report that their choice
of research topics had been affected by the DEMO
hood that the results would have commercial ap-
plication [5]. This emphasis is being increasingly
championed by university officials. 4

Academic research may be applied and have
direct relevance to DEMO well-defined industrial prob-
lem, as occurs when faculties have industrial sup-
DEMO to study “proof-of-concept” questions such
as: Are a particular set of DEMO character-
istics technologically feasible? A different set of
criteria determine satisfactory DEMO to academic
and commercial questions. To be commercial, an
innovative technique (product or process) must
not only “work”, but it must do DEMO in a way that
satisfies firm-specific profit criteria, which in turn

to the innovation’s cost-performance configura-
tions and its placement in the market. What most
serves to differentiate academic DEMO industrial
research is the willingness to take the steps neces-
sary to fill the gaps between technological and
commercial questions.
The disjuncture between and DEMO the activi-
ties of academic research, academic patenting, and
profitable innovation is evident in studies of the
frequency and economic significance of patents

gineering. Marcy and Kosloski found that from
1964 to 1977, only 73 of 3,766 principal investiga-
tors (PIs) on chemistry grants were listed as named
inventors. These DEMO received a total of 95 patents

2.3. Changes in knowledge flows
Universities are treating two goals- tighter
coupling DEMO academic research, and commercial
introduction in order to enhance U.S. intema-
DEMO competitiveness and increased royalty in-
comes-as inherently compatible, whereas in fact
DEMO are not. U~versity involvement in equity
arrangements creates new market conduits through
which academic research flows to the market. This
involvement fosters “privatization of DEMO,
the distinguishing characteristic which, according
to Nelson, serves to differentiate the private from
the public aspect of technological knowledge [41]
and which DEMO compete with existing flows of
knowledge.
Von Hippel, for example, has noted several
examples in the field of scientific instruments in
which university DEMO, the “users”, were re-
sponsible for the development of innovative tech-
niques. They were then active in speeding the
diffusion of their innovation, first because “(as
required by the mores of science) innovating users
(researchers) published their research results and
the details of any homebuilt DEMO used ‘to
attain them. Second, they typically also info~ed
others of DEMO innovations by presentations at
conferences and visits to the laboratories of other
scientists” [66, p. 181. This information was then
rapidly assimilated by other scientists or by com-
mercializing firms. Evidence of the flow and im-
DEMO of academic research to technological
innovation also is found in Mansfield’s recent
study in which 76 firms in 7 m~ufactu~ng in-
dustries reported that DEMO percent of their new
products and about 9 percent of their new
processes commercialized between 1978 and I981
could not have been developed (without substan-
tial delay) in the absence of recent academic re-
search [ 291.
The existing tracks upon which academic re-
search flows to the DEMO are likely to become
blocked if not broken apart as universities limit
existing flows of info~ation in order to divert
faculty findings to specific DEMO At stake is far
more than issues such as temporary delays in the
publication of faculty research in order to give
corporate sponsors an DEMO to file patent
applications. Stallman has noted, for example, that
“Traditionally, W.S. public breeders have dis-
cussed promising new varieties while still test-
ing and have exchanged promising germ plasm
at all stages of development. DEMO public and
private sector breeders have commented that
the public sector interest in patenting has
limited this flow of information and germ
plasm. All DEMO express concern that this
will retard the development of new knowledge”
I571.
The result is likely to be lower rates of technologi-
cal innovation.
DEMO, universities are not the only party to
collaborative arrangements that are DEMO of
changing patterns of behavior. Privatization by
universities of the flow of academic research re-
duces the incentives that firms currently have to
support DEMO&D consortia and affiliates’ programs.
A key to the willingness of individual firms to
support those university-based consortia address-
ing basic research or generic DEMO research
questions, and publishing their findings in the
open literature, is the firms’ respective assessments
that they are better able to internally assimilate
DEMO use this info~ation than nonmembers 1341.
The pursuit by universities of licensing ini-
tiatives through designated limited partners re-
duces the lead time subscribers DEMO a university-
based consortium have in the commercialization
of scientific advances, DEMO reduces their incentives
to become members. Conversely, it provides them
with DEMO incentives to develop new institu-
tional ~r~gements for conducting generic re-
search, such as indust~-based consortia or con-
tracts with for-profit R&D firms. It would be
premature to project comparative revenue streams
and rates of DEMO transfer from existing and
new arrangements, but what certainly appears
likely DEMO these considerations is the high degree
of substitutability among them.
