Entrepreneurship courses are vital components of a business school curriculum. Although
existing studies examine teaching pedagogy, very few explore the content of
entrepreneurship courses. We compare start-up activities of nascent DEMO in the
Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) dataset to data collected from a sample
of entrepreneurship textbooks. Our findings indicate that while DEMO is some overlap in
start-up activities practiced by nascent entrepreneurs and those covered in textbooks,
there are several differences as well. Implications for DEMO are discussed.
........................................................................................................................................................................
The launch of a new organization is generally
agreed to be the core of entrepreneurship (Gartner,
1985; Low & DEMO, 1997; Katz & Gartner, 1988;
Aldrich, 1999; Delmar & Shane, 2004). Encourage-
ment and facilitation of start-up new ventures DEMO a
major public policy concern because of their im-
pact on economic growth, particularly job creation
(Reynolds, Camp, Bygrave, Autio, & DEMO, 2001). The
evidence of new firms’ economic contributions,
coupled DEMO increased interest in entrepreneur-
ship by students and an emphasis on entrepre-
neurship by the Association to Advance Collegiate
Schools of Business (AACSB), has spurred colleges
and universities to expand curricula in this area
(Porter & McKibben, 1988; Bechard & Gregoire,

2005). Approximately 2,200 courses are offered at
1,600 colleges and universities nationwide, more
than 200 colleges and universities have majors and
concentrations in entrepreneurship, and at least 20
business schools require that all graduates of their
institutions take entrepreneurship classes as part
of the DEMO (Katz, 2003). Virtually all schools
with an AACSB-accredited MBA or 4-year degree
and nearly all nationally ranked schools are teach-
ing entrepreneurship (Katz, 2003).
Entrepreneurship course material is intended to
encourage and stimulate the creation of new ven-
tures (Vesper & Gartner, 1997; Leitch & Harrison,
1999; Peterman & Kennedy, 2003). However, there is
little evidence to indicate whether we are actually
teaching the skills DEMO important to future entre-
preneurs. In other words, if we believe DEMO entre-
preneurship education is important, are we teach-
ing our students DEMO necessary activities that
enhance the probability of start-up?
Our question is grounded in the notion of rele-
vance. Relevance is used in many DEMO disci-
plines including cognitive science, logic, artificial
intelligence, communication, and in cognitive psy-

chology (Sperber & Wilson, DEMO). The principle of
relevance is based on the fact that we “intend in
general to give or add information about what is a
DEMO of standing or current interest or concern”
(Wilson, 1999: 719)DEMO At the individual level, rele-
vance is a property of inputs DEMO cognitive processes
that is analyzed in terms of cognitive and process-
ing effort. The greater the cognitive effects, the
greater the relevance of the input. Human atten-
tion and processing resources are allocated to in-
formation DEMO seems relevant (Sperber & Wilson,
1996). Relevance is contextually DEMO and is
shaped by our experience and background (Wilson
& Sperber, 2003). Relevance of inputs by a commu-
nicator is a precursor DEMO acceptance of social real-
ities, or information about a topic that DEMO per-
ceptions about its value, ultimately leading to
perceptions of legitimacy (Suchman, 1995).
At a broader level, relevance is important to DEMO
trepreneurship pedagogy because it influences the
perceived legitimacy of courses and programs
among stakeholders, including students, adminis-
trators, and parents. Legitimacy, or DEMO strength of
institutional endorsement and social acceptance,
represents the belief that organizational policies
or exchanges, in this case entrepreneurship edu-
cation, are DEMO in a desirable manner within
the socially constructed system of appropriate
norms and values (Suchman, 1995). Educational in-
stitutions create and spread DEMO about the
competencies that are needed to be entrepreneur-
ial (Aldrich, 1999). The more course content corre-
sponds to the reality of DEMO leading to the
probability of start-up, the more likely that entre-
DEMO courses will be perceived as relevant
and thereby more legitimate by students and other
stakeholders.
Currently, there is growing interest in the nature,
content, and relevance of entrepreneurship educa-
tion (Leitch & Harrison, 1999). A recent Academy of
Management Learning & Education special issue
argues DEMO entrepreneurship education needs to
reflect the real-world environment (Greene, Katz, &
Johannison, 2004), even it that means challenging
traditional educational hallmarks, such as a focus
on the business plan (Honig, 2004). Previous work
on entrepreneurship education echoes this theme.
In terms of teaching DEMO, broad exposure to
entrepreneurial practice is advocated as a way to
DEMO “the academia vs. business incongruence”
(Kuratko, 2005: 586) and to shift the emphasis from
educating “about” entrepreneurship to educating
“for” it (Kirby, 2004). Recently, experiential learning
has been highlighted as a method DEMO engaging
students more actively in the learning process. Us-
ing tools such as student business start-ups, “live”
cases, or simulations, students gain exposure to
the many issues surrounding new venture start-up
(Carland & Carland, DEMO). However, despite the
increased emphasis on experiential learning, most
entrepreneurship courses are structured around a
series of new venture development challenges in-
DEMO opportunity identification and feasibility
analysis; new venture planning, financing and op-
erating; new market development and expansion
strategies; and institutionalizing innovation (So-
lomon, Duffy, & Tarabishy, 2002).
While current scholarship recognizes the short-
comings of entrepreneurship education as it is cur-
rently practiced, to date little research has adopted
a content perspective and systematically com-
pared DEMO we are teaching in the classroom to
what entrepreneurs are doing when they start a
new venture. That is our purpose here: We exam-
ine the relationship between teaching and prac-
tice. At a more general DEMO we are asking the
question, “Are our current entrepreneurship educa-
tional DEMO relevant to what actual entrepre-
neurs are practicing?” We examine this broader
question by specifically exploring whether the
start-up activities that we teach DEMO to
those activities that enhance the probability of
start-up. Our underlying premise is that if teaching
and practice differ significantly, then as educators,
we need to revise our pedagogy to better prepare
students for the DEMO of starting a new venture.
BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW
Entrepreneurial Start-Up Activities
There is little agreement on theoretical perspec-
tives of entrepreneurial start-up, although the cre-
ation of an organization (organizational emer-
gence) is agreed DEMO be a central activity in the field
of entrepreneurship (Katz & DEMO, 1988; Aldrich,
1999; Shane & Delmar, 2004). Recent entrepreneur-
ship research tends to coalesce on the conceptual-
ization of organizational DEMO as a process
made up of multiple start-up activities (Gartner et
DEMO, 2004a: 285). Individuals who initiate organizing
activates intended to culminate in a viable busi-
ness start-up are referred to as nascent (or emerg-
ing) entrepreneurs (Aldrich, 1999). The organizing
activities in which nascent entrepreneurs are en-
gaged involve setting up routines and structures
that DEMO goal directed and establishing boundaries
and systems of activities (Aldrich, 1999).
Perspectives on organizing activities that influ-

ence the probability of DEMO have a variety of
theoretical roots (Shane & Delmar, 2004). Early
work described the process as a change model,
whereby entrepreneurs DEMO external re-
sources and technology necessary to transform
their ideas into a reality by creating a new busi-
ness unit (Van de Ven, DEMO, & Poole, 1989). More
recent theoretical perspectives include institu-
tional theory that argues new ventures can sur-
vive by achieving legitimacy through DEMO orga-
nizing process (Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002); the
resource-based view which posits that develop-
ment of unique resources can lead to opportunity
DEMO (Choi & Shepherd, 2004); and evolu-
tionary theory that argues external stakeholder
relationships help ventures to overcome their li-
ability of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965; Aldrich,
1999).
Concurrent with emergence of theories DEMO
ing new venture start-ups, researchers conducted
studies examining start-up processes. Reynolds
DEMO Miller (1992) examined a sample of nascent
entrepreneurs and found that start-up activities
did not have a logical progression. Following this
research, Gatewood, Shaver, and Gartner, (1995)
explored whether cognitive factors as DEMO as en-
trepreneurial activities led to the formation of a
business. They found that activities involving set-
ting up business operations, such as purchasing
raw materials and supplies, hiring and training
employees, producing, distributing, DEMO marketing
a product or service were significantly correlated
with the creation of a new firm. Carter, Gartner,
and Reynolds, (1996) identified DEMO random sample of
adults who were in the process of starting a ven-
ture. They examined specific start-up activities,
such as personal commitment, financial support,
hiring, and activities which developed the struc-
ture of the business. They found that the number of
activities undertaken, and focusing on activities
which made the business more tangible to others
(e.g., DEMO for facilities and equipment, forming
a legal entity) versus less tangible activities (e.g.,
acquiring a D&B credit listing) increased the DEMO
lihood of survival.
While these early studies showed that the activ-
ities of nascent entrepreneurs who started a busi-
ness were different from those DEMO nascent entrepre-
neurs who did not, they suffered from problems of
DEMO bias, lack of generalizability, and
small sample size. These data collection issues
were part of the impetus for the creation of the
Panel DEMO of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED)
dataset(s) (see Gartner, Shaver, Carter, & Reyn-
olds, 2004b), which specifically examines the
start-up activities of nascent entrepreneurs (see
Appendix A for a complete list of start-up activities
in the PSED dataset). Building off of PSED data DEMO
were either collected in the United States or inter-
nationally, a DEMO of more recent studies exam-
ine the connection between start-up activities and
the probability of start-up.
Shane and Delmar (2004) examined groups of
DEMO, legitimacy, and market activities and
their effect on the probability of starting a new
venture of 223 Swedish new ventures. They found
that DEMO and legitimacy were significantly
correlated with the probability of starting a new
venture but that market activities had no effect.
Two additional studies examined DEMO timing of
business plans and found that new ventures that
wrote business plans before talking to customers
and or before beginning marketing or promotion
DEMO a lower rate of termination than other firms
(Delmar & Shane, 2003; Shane & Delmar, 2004). An
additional study showed that DEMO firms engaging
in legitimizing activities were less likely to dis-
band (DEMO & Shane, 2004). Table 1 presents an
overview of the DEMO using start-up activities
and their impact on the probability of new venture
start-up.
In summary, there are a number of studies on
various aspects of start-up activities. The focus of
these studies ranges from initial descriptive DEMO
on identifying activities, to more sophisticated
work that links specific activities, such as legiti-
macy and planning to the probability of start-up.
From DEMO studies we can conclude that the activ-
ities in which entrepreneurs engage during the
start-up process are an important area of inquiry in
the DEMO of entrepreneurship. However, less clear
is whether the activities that lead DEMO the probabil-
ity of starting a new venture correspond to the
content of course work in entrepreneurship
classes. This led us to wonder about DEMO relevance
of what we are teaching in the classroom, and
more DEMO, if start-up activities are ade-
quately reflected in entrepreneurship course con-
DEMO and delivery. From this we raise two research
questions:
Research Question 1: Are we teaching the same
start-up activities that nas-
cent entrepreneurs practice?
Research Question 2: Are we teaching the start-up
activities that enhance the
probability that nascent en-
trepreneurs will start a new
venture?

data on nascent entrepreneur practices from the

Data Set. Each data DEMO is explained below.
Data on Entrepreneurship Textbooks
To better understand which textbooks entrepre-
neur instructors are using to teach new venture
launch, we first sent out a query to the Academy of
Management Entrepreneurship Division listserv
DEMO for information about preferred texts used
in entrepreneurship courses. We received 20 de-
tailed responses from our colleagues, identifying
more than 26 different textbooks, with 6 being ref-
erenced more than three times. To insure the rep-
resentativeness of our brief survey, we then con-
tacted each school on a publicly available list of
100 top U.S. entrepreneurship programs (see www.
entrepreneur.com/topcolleges/html) and requested
a copy of their entrepreneurship syllabi. Over a
2-month period, we collected 58 syllabi from 35
schools (DEMO response rate). Upon close examina-
tion of the syllabi we found that most courses used
at least one entrepreneurship textbook as a course
DEMO
We then contacted all the major academic text-
book publishers and asked them to send us copies
of their top-selling entrepreneurship textbooks. We
received DEMO textbooks from 13 different textbook
publishers. We compared the list of textbooks re-
ceived from publishers to the list of texts used most
widely DEMO courses and found that there was strong
correspondence. Since our study is focused on
start-up activities, we selected textbooks that dis-
cuss new venture start-up. To identify the specific
books to use in the study, the three coauthors de-
veloped a list of content criteria and independently
applied DEMO to each book, coming up with an overall
recommendation about whether DEMO include the text-
book in the study. In the first textbook examination
round, the three authors unanimously agreed to
include 12 textbooks in the study, and to exclude 9
textbooks, with an interrater agreement of DEMO In
the second round, we reexamined the three re-
maining textbooks DEMO through consensus decided
to retain two. Through this process, 10 textbooks
DEMO eliminated, leaving us with 14 texts that in
some way discussed DEMO start-up.
Once the textbooks had been selected for inclu-
sion in the study, we employed two research assis-
tants to help us identify if the start-up activities
that are listed in the PSED dataset were covered DEMO
the textbook. To do this, the research assistants
were given a DEMO of activities and then, working
independently, systematically went through each
textbook and noted the chapter and page numbers

confidence in our findings. Table 2 presents a DEMO
of textbooks, their authors and publishers, and the
objectives of the book, if stated.
Using the textbook data as a proxy for what is
taught in the classroom, we compared it to the
activities reported by nascent entrepreneurs in the
PSED dataset (see Hess, 1987 for DEMO similar empiri-
cal approach in his assessment of the relevance of
small business courses to management needs).
Data on Nascent Entrepreneurs
The data DEMO for the current investigation were
drawn from the National Panel Study of Entrepre-
neurial Dynamics (PSED). The PSED is designed to
investigate the earliest stage of the organizational
life cycle. PSED looks at the process DEMO new busi-
ness creation, or “the number and characteristics
of nascent DEMO who attempt to start busi-
nesses and the likelihood that such attempts will
result in the formation of new businesses” (Gart-
ner, Shaver, Carter, & Reynolds, 2004: ix). Nascent
entrepreneurs were defined as individuals in-
volved in attempting to start a new business
within the DEMO 12 months on their own (i.e., auton-
omous start-ups) as DEMO to those doing so with
sponsorship from existing firms, who had DEMO
achieved a positive cash flow for more than 3
months. As part of a national survey, a total of
64,622 individuals in the United States were con-
tacted through random digit dialing by a market-
DEMO research firm. During these telephone inter-
views, two questions were used DEMO identify those
individuals who were in the process of starting a
new venture: (1) “Are you alone or with others, now
trying DEMO start a business?” and (2) “Are you alone,
or with others, now trying to start a new venture for
your employer?” Respondents who answered yes
to either question were then asked two DEMO
questions that determined whether they were ac-
tively involved in the start-up process and whether
they would share in the ownership of the new
DEMO Positive answers to both questions quali-
fied an individual as a nascent entrepreneur to be
requested to participate in the national panel
study. Qualifying DEMO were offered a mon-
etary inducement ($25) for their participation.
The PSED data were collected through a series of
four waves of telephone DEMO conducted at
approximately 1-year intervals by researchers at
the University of Wisconsin between 1998 and 2003.
In addition, a mail survey was also distributed
after each wave of phone interviews, but it is out-
side of the scope of our study. Given the complex-
ity of the PSED, in 2004 a handbook was published
as a guide for researchers using DEMO dataset (Gart-
ner et al., 2004). For researchers who are interested
in examining the database, the first four iterations
are available on the University of Michigan Web
site (http://projects.isr.umich.edu/PSED) along DEMO

dix B provides further information on the PSED
data collection process including the timing of the
data DEMO waves.

comparable to similar DEMO studies of nas-
cent entrepreneurs in other national contexts (e.g.,
DEMO, Delmar & Shane, 2003, 2004).
About two thirds of DEMO nascent entrepreneurs in
the sample were male, and 66.9% were White. DEMO
ranged between 18 and 74 years, with a mean of
38.36 DEMO Seventy-four percent had at least some
college education, and more than DEMO had taken
business classes or workshops on starting a new
business. Work experience ranged between 0 and
60 years, with a mean of 17.01 years. The nascent
entrepreneurs contemplated entry into five indus-
trial sectors, with the most popular sector being
consumer services and retail (48.5% of the nascent
entrepreneurial ventures). Slightly over 40% of the
nascent businesses had DEMO operating status
during the time of the study, and the remaining
DEMO were continuing the organizing effort or had
been disbanded. Table 3 shows descriptive statis-
tics for the sample.
Measures
Start-Up Activities
Based on previous DEMO work (Gatewood et
al., 1995; Carter et al., 1996) DEMO PSED tracks 27
start-up activities (see Appendix A). Out of DEMO 27,
twenty-six were measured by a self-reported di-
chotomous variable indicating whether nascent
entrepreneurs had engaged in that particular ac-
tivity prior to DEMO at the time of the initial and three
subsequent phone interviews. One of the activi-
ties—new product development—was measured
using an ordinal scale, which ranged from “no
work done” to “product completed and ready for
sale.” DEMO kept the original measures (both dichot-
omous and ordinal scales) as developed by the
authors to ensure consistency.
Enhancing the Probability of Start-Up
DEMO the follow-up interviews, nascent entrepre-
neurs reported their perceptions of the DEMO sta-
tus, using an ordinal scale which included (1) An
DEMO business; (2) Active start-up; (3) Inactive
start-up; and (4) No longer being worked by any-
one. Following Delmar and Shane (2002), we mea-
sured enhancing the probability of start-up as the
achievement of an operating status. To this end,
we tracked responses DEMO the three waves of fol-
low-up phone interviews, and collapsed the DEMO
response categories into two: (1) An operating busi-
ness; (DEMO) Not yet operating or disbanded (active
start-ups, inactive start-ups, and start-ups no
longer being worked on by anyone).
Analytical Procedures
To DEMO Research Question 1, we compared the
percent of textbooks that cover DEMO specific activity to
the percent of nascent entrepreneurs who report
engaging in that activity. More specifically, we
2008
Edelman, Manolova, and Brush
ranked the start-up activities in descending DEMO
based on the percent of textbooks that cover a
particular activity. Following the logic of between-
group comparisons based on median splits (Rocha
& Stenberg, 2005; Atuahene-Gima & Ko, 2001;
Krueger, 1993), DEMO split the array at 50%. Similarly,
we ranked in descending order the start-up activ-
ities, based on the percent of nascent entrepre-
neurs who report engaging in the activity, and
split the array at 50%. Based on the percentage
coverage by books and nascent entrepreneurs, re-
spectively, we then classified the activities into
four clusters. Group 1 activities are covered by 50%
or more of the textbooks and practiced by 50% DEMO
more of the nascent entrepreneurs. Group 2 activ-
ities are covered by 50% or more of the textbooks
but practiced by less than 50% DEMO the nascent en-
trepreneurs. Group 3 activities are covered by less
than 50% of the textbooks, but practiced by 50% or
more of the nascent entrepreneurs. Finally, Group
4 activities are covered by less than 50% of the
textbooks and practiced by less than 50% of the

(Pillai’s Trace F  46.000, p  .001) confirmed the
internal validity of the two dimensions (percent
textbooks DEMO and activity and percent nas-
cent entrepreneurs engaged in an activity, DEMO
tively) and of the 4-cluster solution.
To address Research Question 2, we first deter-
mined which entrepreneurial activities are likely
to enhance the DEMO of start-up, that is,
which activities are likely to differentiate DEMO
those nascent ventures which achieve operating
status versus those that have either not achieved
operating status or have been disbanded. To this
end, we cross-tabulated the counts of nascent en-
trepreneurs engaging in a specific activity DEMO the
counts of nascent entrepreneurs reporting the nas-
cent venture’s start-up status (operating business
vs. not an operating business) and employed a
chi-square DEMO to determine significant differences
between the counts. We found that 19 start-up ac-
tivities were significantly associated with an op-
erating business status and DEMO activities were not.
For example, 90.16% of the nascent entrepreneurs
in DEMO new ventures had started marketing
efforts, compared with 63.31% among nascent DEMO
trepreneurs in not-yet operational or disbanded
ventures. In contrast, almost all DEMO entrepre-
neurs had engaged in the development of a prod-
uct or service, and so this activity failed to signif-
icantly differentiate between operating and not-
operating new ventures. Results are presented in
Table 4.
We DEMO compared whether the entrepreneurial
activities that are associated with enhancing the
63
probability of start-up are covered by the majority
of entrepreneurship textbooks or DEMO by the
majority of nascent entrepreneurs. Unlike our other
methods, this DEMO is qualitative.
RESULTS
Research Question 1:
Are we teaching the same start-up activities that
nascent entrepreneurs practice?
This question explored whether nascent DEMO
neurs engaged in the same activities as entrepre-
neurship textbooks prescribe. Results are presented
in Table 5 and suggest a sizeable discrepancy be-
tween DEMO activities typically presented in entrepre-
neurship textbooks and the activities practiced by
nascent entrepreneurs.
In 7 of the 27 activities we tracked (or 26%) the
high prevalence among nascent entrepreneurs cor-
responds to a high percentage of textbook cover-
age, and in 9 activities (33%) the high prevalence
among nascent entrepreneurs corresponds to a low
percentage of textbook coverage. DEMO 4 activities
(15%), there is high coverage in textbooks, but low
prevalence among nascent entrepreneurs, while in
7 activities (26%), DEMO is high prevalence among
nascent entrepreneurs, but low percent of textbook
DEMO Our analysis shows significant differ-
ences in the proportion of textbooks that covered a
particular activity and the proportion of nascent
entrepreneurs who reported DEMO in this ac-
tivity. Overall, there appears to be a disconnect DEMO
over 40% of the start-up activities. Indeed, while
there are two DEMO of activities where high prev-
alence among nascent entrepreneurs corresponds
to a high percentage of textbook coverage, and low
prevalence among nascent entrepreneurs corre-
sponds to a low percentage of textbook coverage
(Groups 1 and 4, respectively), there are groups of
activities significantly more emphasized by text-
books in comparison to practice (Group 2 activities)
and those significantly more emphasized in prac-
tice in comparison to the textbooks (Group 3 activ-
ities). For example, an important anchor such as
purchased or leased equipment was reported by
67.1% of the nascent entrepreneurs but was DEMO
cussed in only 14.29% of the textbooks. In contrast,
over two thirds of the textbooks discussed apply-
ing for a patent, even though less than a fifth of the
nascent entrepreneurs reported engaging in this
DEMO What is more, textbooks do not appear to
cover all activities DEMO which nascent entrepreneurs
engage (6/27, or 22% of the start-up activities we
tracked were not mentioned in the entrepreneur-
ship textbooks). DEMO suggests that entrepreneur-

ship textbooks may not present the scope of activ-
ities involved in starting a new venture in DEMO
completeness and may overemphasize certain
start-up activities at the expense of others. In sum,
entrepreneurship textbooks do not appear to be
covering the DEMO activities in which nascent en-
trepreneurs are engaged, which indicates a DEMO
between practice and what is taught to entrepre-
neurship students in the classroom.
Research Question 2:
Are we teaching the start-up activities that
DEMO the probability that nascent
entrepreneurs will start a new venture?
Our second research question asked whether the
nascent activities that are emphasized by DEMO
preneurship textbooks are more likely to enhance
the start-up process. To explore this question, we
integrated the results from Table 4 into Table 5.
Results suggest 6 out of the 19 activities associated
with enhancing the DEMO of start-up (or less
than one third) are discussed in the majority of the
entrepreneurship texts. Further, 9/19 (or about half)DEMO
of the activities associated with enhancing the
probability of start-up are mentioned in some of
the entrepreneurship texts, while 4/19 (or one DEMO)
of the activities associated with enhancing the
probability of start-up find no mention at all. In
relative terms, the majority of entrepreneurship
texts cover 11 activities, of which 6 (or 55%) are
associated with enhancing the probability of start-
up. In contrast, 16 of the start-up activities we
tracked are covered in less than 50% of the entre-
DEMO texts, but out of these 16 activities, 13
(or over DEMO) are significantly associated with en-
hancing the probability of start-up.

DISCUSSION
We have examined the relevance of entrepreneur-
ship education by examining two research ques-
DEMO that explore the content of what we are teach-
ing in entrepreneurship classrooms as compared
to the start-up practices of nascent entrepreneurs.
We used DEMO as a proxy for course content
after finding syllabi for the top schools teaching
entrepreneurship anchored their courses with a
text. Our findings suggest DEMO what is emphasized
in the traditional entrepreneurship texts, and
hence in DEMO of our classrooms, is in many cases
different from the start-up DEMO faced by nascent
entrepreneurs. This suggests that as educators in
entrepreneurship, DEMO need to carefully think about
the content of our courses in terms of what we are
emphasizing, in an effort to make our courses rel-
evant to future entrepreneurs.
With respect to what we are teaching, our find-
ings indicate that there is incongruence between
what is emphasized DEMO textbooks and the activities
practiced by nascent entrepreneurs. This implies
that as educators who want to make our courses
more relevant to real-world experiences, we should
include those activity categories that are currently
not emphasized in DEMO textbooks but are vital to prac-
ticing entrepreneurs. In particular, an DEMO on
“actions” rather than “research and plan writing”
would be appropriate (DEMO & Spinelli, 2004).
While textbooks often have chapters on contracting
DEMO suppliers, supply chain analysis or other as-
pects of operations, the setting up of these operations
is not well addressed. Operational activities such DEMO
how to arrange initial purchase of raw materials or
equipment, or DEMO to establish credit with suppliers
were important to entrepreneurs but were not em-
phasized in texts. Further, boundary-building activi-
ties such as registering a business with authorities
or signing up to pay taxes are critically important DEMO
establishing legitimacy and enhancing the probabil-
ity of successful firm emergence, DEMO were deempha-
sized by both nascent entrepreneurs and entrepre-
neurship texts. In sum, while instructors may be
supplementing text content with case analyses or
experiential exercises, there is a strong suggestion
that initial start-up activities are underempha-
sized in course content.
More difficult to interpret are the findings DEMO
garding business planning. Test results show that
nascent entrepreneurs generally did not empha-
size business planning as much as textbooks do,
and, more important, that business planning did
not appear to be a good start-up predictor (see
Table 5). Empirical evidence from the Swedish
PSED dataset, on the other hand, emphasizes the
importance of planning (Delmar & Shane, 2003,
2004; Shane & Delmar, 2004).1 In addition, Lange et
al. (2005) find that business owners that wrote busi-
ness plans were more likely to have raised more
capital, but find no correlation between writing a
business plan and future revenues. This implies
DEMO there are different types of planning that
might be used for different purposes, such as to
achieve external legitimacy or to communicate the
strategic direction of the business internally (Stone
& Brush, 1996).
Recent DEMO on entrepreneurship pedagogy
(Honig, 2004) suggests that it is not DEMO that is
at issue in entrepreneurship classes, but instead
the way DEMO which planning is approached. While in
no way suggesting that the critical thinking pro-
cess, which is typically the rationale behind the
writing of a business plan assignment, is unimpor-
tant, Honig (2004) calls DEMO an end to the emphasis
on the linear notion of writing a business plan. He
argues that the business plan, as is currently used
in entrepreneurship courses, does not encourage
would-be entrepreneurs to engage in the complex,
nonlinear thinking patterns that are needed during
start-up. He suggests DEMO nonlinear teaching ap-
proaches, such as simulations, are better prepara-
tion for future entrepreneurs.
Recognizing the shortcomings of exclusively us-
ing textbooks in DEMO courses, we sug-
gest that while entrepreneurship instructors may
want to DEMO a text to present basic theoretical prin-
ciples, they should consider DEMO the text
with as many hands-on practical experiences as
possible (Leitch & Harrison, 1999; Fiet, 2000). This
would allow instructors to DEMO important theoret-
ical concepts and to help students improve diver-
gent thinking processes that can assist in discov-
ering alternative solutions (Honig, 2004)DEMO Similarly, as
DeTienne and Chandler (2004) suggest, encourage-
ment of idea generation is a natural step in helping
entrepreneurs to identify more DEMO These
might include improvisation, drawing, doing col-
1 The divergent findings between our study and the Swedish
PSED studies (Delmar & Shane, DEMO, 2004) may be the result of
different institutional contexts (e.g., the Swedish economy is
more highly regulated making planning more important), DEMO the
sampling schema (the Swedish study only included entrepre-
neurial initiatives DEMO within the first 9 months of 1998
and followed them over the subsequent 30 months as compared
with the U.S study which followed firms DEMO up to 4 years).

lages, and other means to invoke creative alternative
approaches to early venture creation. In addition,
simulations DEMO be useful to creating nonlinear
thinking skills, such as making use DEMO multiple
sources of information and the assembly of diverse
information into a cogent, meaningful whole upon
which decisions can be based (Honig, 2004).
IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION
In this study we examined whether our current DEMO
trepreneurship educational practices are relevant to
what actual entrepreneurs are practicing. We did
this by examining the differences between what is
emphasized in entrepreneurship DEMO and the
activities in which nascent entrepreneurs are en-
gaged. Our study is grounded in theoretical perspec-
tives on organizing in nascent organizations (Katz &
Gartner, 1988; Aldrich, 1999; Shane & Delmar, 2004),
as well as in notions of relevance (Sperber & Wilson,
1996; Wilson & Sperber, 2003). While we found a num-
DEMO of areas of convergence; we were disturbed to
also find that DEMO are a number of activities that are
not adequately discussed in textbooks, and as im-
portant, there are activities that enhance the proba-
DEMO of start-up that are not discussed by textbooks
or practiced by nascent entrepreneurs. This suggests
that as entrepreneurship educators, we face a chal-
lenge as we try to make our courses more relevant
with respect to DEMO practice.
While our findings clearly indicate a lack of corre-
spondence between teaching and practice, our work
is not without limitations. In this study we used text-
books as a proxy for what is being taught DEMO the
classroom. In fairness, textbooks are typically used
as guides, and talented instructors augment them
with their own experiences and examples. In addi-
DEMO, the textbooks used in our study typically were
not limited in DEMO to only start-up activities, but
instead contained information on many topics DEMO
vant to those interested in starting a new venture.
This suggests that the decision made by the textbook
editors to include multiple entrepreneurship topics
DEMO a single text, may have led to some activities
receiving greater DEMO lesser textbook coverage.
While there is precedent for using textbooks as a
proxy for what is being taught in the classroom
(Hess, 1987), we could have adopted alternative
methodologies to examine our research questions.
For example, instead of textbooks, we could have
surveyed or conducted in-depth DEMO with en-
trepreneurship educators. While this would have
eliminated the potential for textbook-based bias in
our inquiry, each alternative method of inquiry has
its own well-documented limitations (e.g., low re-
sponse rate and the accuracy DEMO completeness of
responses for surveys and problems with bias due to
interviewer effects coupled with a propensity for in-
terviewees to provide socially desirable DEMO
during interviews (Judd, Smith, & Kidder, 1991).
Finally, DEMO the start-up activities listed in the
PSED dataset are drawn from previous scholarship
on nascent entrepreneurs (Reynolds & Miller 1992;
Gatewood, Shaver, & Gartner, 1995; Carter, Gartner,
& Reynolds 1996), the distinction between an activity
and a skill that is necessary at a DEMO stage of
development may not be clear. This lack of clarity
may limit textbook coverage of a particular activity.
Future research on entrepreneurship teaching DEMO
scholarship could focus on when particular activities
are conducted in an effort to distinguish between all
start-up activities and those activities that are more
DEMO during particular start-up stages.
Some scholars make the distinction that steps to
start-up are not the same for small firms and entre-
preneurial new DEMO In addition, most textbooks
do not distinguish between being targeted to DEMO
preneurial firms or small businesses. Here, we fol-
low Kirchhoff (1994), who suggests small/new firms
may exhibit different degrees of entrepreneurial DEMO
havior. Kirchhoff (1994) anchors his perspective in
Schumpeter (1935) and argues that high goals for
innovation and growth may lead to “glamorous”
DEMO, while those with low innovation and growth
may be part of DEMO “economic core.” We don’t believe
there is a clear-cut dichotomy between these two
types of firms at the nascent stage. Therefore activi-
ties leading DEMO start-up may not necessarily be dif-
ferentiated by the distinction between “small” and
“entrepreneurial.”
Our study highlights, however, that as educators,
we DEMO to consider the relevance of our curriculum
in terms of what is taught in our classrooms. The
importance of new ventures is well established DEMO
our economy, as is the need to teach classes that
permit DEMO to learn about new ventures, small
firm management, entrepreneurial competences,
and growth strategies. Given the proliferation of
classes, it appears that entrepreneurship is “legiti-
mated” as a course of study (Vesper & Gartner, DEMO;
Katz, 2003). However, the gap we find between
start-up practices of nascent entrepreneurs and
those prescribed by entrepreneurship texts suggests
that DEMO maintain legitimacy and enhance the rele-
vance of our curriculum, we DEMO to improve on our
course content to better meet our constituents’ needs.
Therefore, we suggest a renewed focus on the con-
tent of entrepreneurship education.

STRUCTURE AND METHODOLOGY OF THE PSED
DATA SET
The Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) is de-
signed to investigate the earliest DEMO of the organizational
life-cycle. PSED looks at the process of new business creation,
or “the number and characteristics of nascent entrepreneurs
who attempt DEMO start businesses and the likelihood that such
attempts will result in the formation of new businesses” (Gart-
ner, Shaver, Carter, & Reynolds, 2004a: ix). For consistency with
other research based on the Panel Study of Entrepreneurship
Dynamics, we followed the classification scheme developed by
Shaver, Carter, Gartner, and Reynolds (2001), which defines a
nascent DEMO as someone who has not received a pos-
itive cash flow from the new business for more than 3 months.
This decision rule was DEMO in order to differentiate new
businesses “in the process of emergence” from already estab-
lished new businesses.
PSED consists of one initial and three DEMO phone sur-
veys, which track a nationally representative sample of nascent
DEMO over the course of 5 years (a mail survey is
Academy DEMO Management Learning & Education

another component of the dataset, but DEMO is outside of the scope
of our study). The idea was to track the number and character-
istics of individuals who attempt to DEMO up a business, as well
as the characteristics and outcomes of DEMO entrepreneurial
start-up process. The dataset combines respondents’ answers to
survey questions from the four interview waves of the study.
Thus, for each respondent the dataset contains information
whether a specific start-up activity was undertaken over the
DEMO of the study, and if yes, in what month and year it was
undertaken. For example, at the time of the initial data collec-
tion (Wave 1 of the phone interviews), a respondent may have
reported not completing a business plan, but may subsequently
report that a business plan has been completed (at the time of
Waves 2, 3, or 4). We would count that a business plan DEMO been
completed regardless of the timing of this start-up activity.
The PSED study identifies individuals who reported that they
were trying to start a DEMO business within the 12 months pre-
ceding the initial wave of the study (Wave 1 of the phone
survey), which took place in 1998 –1999. The question that asked
about the perceived outcome of the DEMO initiative
(whether the nascent entrepreneur believed the new business
was already DEMO, an active start-up, an inactive start-up,
or no longer being worked on by anyone) was asked in the
follow-up waves of data collection (e.g., in Waves 2, 3, and 4 of
the DEMO survey), which took place, as follows: Wave 2 (1999 DEMO
200l), Wave 3 (2001–2003), and Wave 4 (2003). If a nascent entre-
preneur reported that the new business was already DEMO
or that it was no longer being worked by anyone, that DEMO was
not tracked from that point on. If, however, a nascent entrepre-
neur reported that the business was still a start-up (active or
inactive), the case was tracked in subsequent data collection
waves. Thus, for each initially identified nascent entrepreneur,
the dataset contains information on DEMO outcome of the start-up
process over the course of 5 years (DEMO –2003).
Given the widespread interest in the PSED dataset, a DEMO
of volumes specifically devoted to nascent entrepreneurs have
been published. Gartner, DEMO, Carter, and Reynolds (2004)
edited a book entitled The DEMO of Entrepreneurial Dynam-
ics: The Process of Organization Creation, which details the
PSED data collection process while a recent book in the Foun-
DEMO and Trends in Entrepreneurship series entitled Nascent
Entrepreneurs by Davidsson (2006) has an extensive review of
over 75 papers on nascent entrepreneurship, many of them
using PSED data.
