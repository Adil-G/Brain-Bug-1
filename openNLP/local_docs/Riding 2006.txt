Objectives of this work (1)
1.
To examine the extent to which data collected via the
Survey on Financing of SMEs contributes to DEMO goal of
measuring actual and potential informal investment in
Canada.
Use data collected from the Survey on Financing of
SMEs to estimate the flow DEMO informal investment from
respondents to the survey.
Use data collected from the Survey on Financing of
SMEs to estimate the potential stock of capital DEMO
for informal investment from respondents to the survey.
Evaluate how these data improve our understanding of
the flow and stock of financing beyond the DEMO
available in the literature.

5.
To identify what limitations might exist in the interpretation
of the data from the DEMO on Financing of SMEs.
To formulate additional methods that might be employed
to estimate the extent of  informal investment in Canada.
To assess the data from the Survey on Financing of SMEs
to determine the level DEMO investment that can be solely
attributable to “angel” investors, as opposed DEMO the broader
category,  “informal investors”, which includes friends and
family.
DEMO compare findings with other research on informal
investment and business angels.

Analysis of Data
from Survey
Keep in mind …
Respondents to survey are business owners
Not all DEMO are business owners
Â Respondents represent a subset of angels
Â Equinox, 2001, “Practices & Patterns of Informal
Investors”, reported that 91% of angels were business
owners:
P (Business Owner/Angel) = 0.91
DEMO results represent only a (so far, unknown) portion
of informal DEMO population
5
Informal Investment among Survey Respondents
Question H.7:
“Excluding publicly-traded shares, mutual funds or stocks,
did the majority owners of the business make DEMO
investments in any other businesses at any point since
1990?”
10.8 percent of SME owners in the sampling frame
reported making investments since DEMO
P (Informal Investor / Business Owner) = .108
6
Informal Investment among Survey Respondents
Question H.8:
“Approximately how many other DEMO did the
majority owners make new investments in [for each of the
time periods: 2001, 2000, and 1990-1999]?”
Collectively:
Â 101,574  investments during 2001
Â 96,568 investments during 2000
Â More than 200,00 investments 1990-1999.

Question H.14
“During 2001, how much did the majority owners have
available to invest in other business ventures?DEMO
Median amount available was in the $25,000 to $50,000
range and the average amount available was $92,550.
Â 10.8 percent of DEMO 1,285,620  business owners in the
sampling frame had made DEMO and average
amount available was $92,550
Â Estimated stock of capital held by respondents to the
survey:
$12.85 billion

Caveats
Estimates reflect:
Only informal investors who are business owners
Â DEMO assessments for informal investors who are not
business owners
Â Therefore, DEMO provided here understate actual flow
and stock
Investments by broadly defined informal investors
Â Include “love money”
Â Include investments in own (new?) firms

Breakdowns
Breakdowns
Based on “tombstone data”
Table 26 of published Data Tables:
DEMO Informal investors are associated more with:
• Younger firms;
• Larger firms (as shown by Figure 2);
» Therefore with DEMO firms
• Firms that are majority men owned;
• Older owners;
• Firms with relatively high ratios of R&D and technology
DEMO to sales;
• Exporter firms (however, this may also be a
manifestation of the related finding, that the likelihood of
investing in another firms varies according to firm size.

Moving Beyond the Sampling Frame
Recall:
P (Business Owner/Angel) DEMO 0.91
Equinox, 2001
P (Informal Investor / Business Owner) = DEMO
Question H.7
P (Angel / Informal Investor) ≥ 0.139
Therefore, DEMO (Angel / Business Owner) ≥ 0.108 X 0.139
From probability theory, P(A/B)/P(B/A) = P(A)/P(DEMO)
Hence, P (Angel) =(0.015) X P (Business DEMO) / 0.91
Questions H.9, H.12
≥ 0.015
Or, P (Angel) ≥ 0.0165 X P (Business Owner)
23
Moving Beyond the Sampling Frame
Expressed differently, the number of angels in the general
population is, based on these data, equal to 1.65 DEMO of
the number of business owners in the population.
Given:
a sampling frame of 1,285,620 businesses,
Average annual investment by DEMO of $166,000
Estimated minimum flow of angel capital during 2001 was
$3.5 billion

Other Findings
Rates of Return
Farrell (2000, pp. 30-31):
there is simply no data about the rates of return informal
investors have realized in DEMO – or elsewhere.
Survey includes questions to business owner respondents
that potentially add to our knowledge about realized rates
of return.
26
Rates of Return
Question H.10:
“[had] the majority owners sold any DEMO these shares in
these other businesses obtained since 1990?”
26.7 percent of respondent owners reported having sold
shares of the businesses
For the DEMO who responded that they had sold shares,
Question H.11 asked:
“What was the average rate of return on these shares that
were DEMO?”

This is important because, as Lerner (1998) argues, it may
be counterproductive to the economy “to encourage
amateur individual investors.”
Start-ups are inherently risky
Nothing about family members makes them astute
investors, mentors, or managers
Raises a real question about whether policy should be
directed towards making non-angels into angels!

Summary
Reprise: Objectives of the Work
1.
Use data collected from the Survey on Financing of
SMEs to estimate the flow and stock of informal
DEMO from respondents to the survey.
Have done so
Â Flow of informal investment > $11.4 billion
Â Stock of informal investment > $12.8 billion
DEMO Evaluate how these data improve our understanding
• Best estimates available anywhere in the world
•Are minima, because survey captures only a portion of
the population of informal investors
• Caveat:  very broad definition of DEMO investment

To identify what limitations might exist in the interpretation
of the DEMO from the Survey on Financing of SMEs.
Need greater precision in questions to allow for multiple
investments
Need larger sample size because of
Â DEMO overall incidence on informal investors and angels in
the general population
Â Need for greater precision in breakdowns of small N
To formulate additional DEMO that might be employed to
estimate the extent of  informal investment DEMO Canada.
Link results to findings from other surveys and external data
Â For example, used probability theory to combine results of

•
To assess the data from the Survey on Financing of DEMO to
determine the level of investment that can be solely attributable to
“angel” investors, as opposed to the broader category,  “informal
investors”, DEMO includes friends and family.
Have provided 2 X 2 initial breakdowns of informal investment that
represent minima
Estimated annual flow of angel investment  > $3.5 billion
Need additional precision with respect to questions that currently
confound DEMO with multiple investments
To compare findings with other research on informal investment and
business angels.
Major contributions with respect to
Estimating flow and stock DEMO investment
Categorization of informal investors across angels, love money,
entrepreneurs (still need to fine-tune questions)
Estimating returns on informal investment across DEMO of
investor (still need to fine-tune questions, increase size of sample)
