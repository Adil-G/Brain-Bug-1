Does Trust improve Business Performance?

Dots trust DEMO business performance? And f so, how can trust be created In
buslncss \vhcre Lhc. IS none? These are [he two quest]ons \vhich this chapter addresses. The
mam aim of the chapter Mto e~’aluatevarious theories which DEMO on the causes and outcomes
of trust, and to pro~idc cmplncal DEMO of those theories using a large scale sumey of
automot]jc parts suppllcrs In [he United States, Europe and Japan,
A growing Interest In bulldlng trust betu”een orgamsatlons stems from the belief that
[rust cnhanccs buslncss DEMO For Instance, trust has been identified as an important
component tvhich DEMO partncrsh]ps, strategic alliances, and nehvorks of small Ilrrns
SUCCCSS1”U1 !985, DEMO 1996, Smltka 1991), Trust ]s also of great releiance today
DEMO the maintenance of consistently high quall~, }vhichis an imprtant source of
DEMO, M easier in a h]gh-trust production system than in a low-trust DEMO (Sako
199-). In a slmllar \cln, Fukuyama ( 1995) DEMO national Industnal competitiveness to
trust as a soclctal-lctcl cultural norm and a soaal capital. According to him, people’s capacity
to Instltut]onallzc trust In the realm of tvork and business awoun~ for the industnal success In
Japan DEMO Germany. By contrast, the ‘missing middle’, namely the absence of Intermediate
sccml groups in the area betw’centhe family and Iargc, centralised organisations hke the church
or [hc sta[c, accounts for the rclau~c economic backwardness of Latin Catholic countnes ( like
Italy, France and Span) and Chinese DEMO ( Fukuyama 1995, p. 55-56).
In Fukuyanm’s ( 1995) study, as In others, the Ilnk betfveen trust and business
performance is DEMO but not proven. Ncvcrthelcss, [he idea is so appealing that at DEMO
pracu[ioncr ICVCI,an increasing number of studies exhort business to create trust as an essential
component in making partnerships bet~vccnfirms successful (SMMT & DTI 1994, Ingersoll
Engineers 1995). [n business strategy, recent ~vorkon trust DEMO organizations focuses on
the possibility of using it to create and malntaln competitive advantage (Barney and Hansen
1994, Jarillo 1988). While thcorctieal DEMO on the link behveen trust and performance
abound, empirical studies in DEMO ara are rare (exceptIons include Mohr and Spekman 1994).
This DEMO presents evidcncc ~vhlchfills this lacuna.
rc
(Brusco
The second, re]a[ed, question ~vhlchthis paper addresses -- how can trust DEMO created
!vhen there is none? -- has been the subject of DEMO debate. The e~treme Posluons in this
debate are held b} those who argue that trust mn be cultivated intentlonall} b} farsighted
parues who rccogmze DEMO benefits of long-term cooperation (Axelrod 1984), and those who
argue DEMO It is a by-product of the em beddedness of parmes Ivho share a common cultural or
somd norm (Granotettcr 1985). Both approaches are not ~eg helpful for thlnkng about ho~~
to create trust ~vhcnthere IS DEMO In the former, if the parties are not farsighted enough, or II_
they are antagomstlc from the start, a process of cooperation may ne~er get started. In the
Iat[er, those I]vlng In commumues ~vhlchare already endo~vedwth high trust can benefit from
It, but those without It arc doomed to suffer from the ad}erse consequences of low’trust. This
chapter cxamlncs DEMO the t~voestrcme view’scan be reconciled.
The central concept explored In tlus chapter ISmutual trust between a cuscomer and a
suppllcr orgamsatton. Trust ISan expcctmon DEMO by an agent that IS trading partner will
bchafc In a mutually acceptable manner (Including an especwon that neither pary WIIIexplolt
the other’s \ulncrabllltlcs). This espectatton narrous the set of possible .actlons. thus reducing
the DEMO) surrounding the partner’s actions. The notion of trust implies that the DEMO
has freedom of choice to uke alternative courses of action. Thus, DEMO In beha~lour
anscs not bccausc of constraints ~vhlchforce the other sldc to stick to a single Possible course
of action. Sako ( 1991, 1S92) catcgonscd olhcr reasons for predictability In behavlour to
dlstlngulsh bctwccn three t)pcs of trust: ‘contractual trust’ (tvill the other party cam out DEMO
contractual agrccmcnts?), ‘compctcncc trust’ (Is the other party capable of doing ~vhatIt says [t
will do?), and ‘good~vllltrust’ (tvdl the DEMO pint}’make an open-ended commitment to take
]n]tlatiics for mutual bcnclit ~vhlicrcfralmng from unfair ad~antage taking?). This th.ree-lvay
dlstlncuon tvill be cmpioycd throughout this chapter.
Contractual trust rests on a shared moral norm of honesty and DEMO keeping.
Compctcncc trust requires a shared understanding of professional conduct and techmcal and
managerial standards. Goochvlll trust can cxlst only tvhen there is consensus DEMO the principle
o(”faimcss. View’cdin this u’ay, there seems to be DEMO hierarchy of trust, with fulfilling a
minimum set of obllgallons consutuung DEMO trust’, and honounng a broader set
constituting ‘gcmd\vill (rust’. A move from contractual trust to goodwill trust involves a
gradual expansion in the DEMO m beliefs about what is acceptable behaviour. Because of
the three-~vay distinction made In the concept of trust, opportunism, defined as self-interest
seek.ing DEMO guile by Williamson ( 1985), is not a mere opposite of trust. A precondition for
trust of the contractual and goodw’ilI types is DEMO absence of opportunistic behaviour.
Ho\\cvcr, lack of opportunism is not a DEMO condition for goodwill trust. For example, a
3
suppher that withholds a vital piece of techmcd lnfotma[lon ma} not be DEMO oppo~n]stlcally
according to the strict contractual sense. Th]s amounts to fulfilling the letter, but not the splnt,
of the contract. Fulfllllng the splnt of the contract, b} demonstrating commitment and fair
beha~lour, ISclose to DEMO nouon of goodt!ill trust.
The chapter IS structured as follot~s. SectIon 1 retlews \anous theories lJ h]ch address

Of th]s study.
1. Does Inter-Organisational Trust Enhance Business Performance?DEMO
Inter-orgimisauomd trust may enhance buslncss performance in a number of ways, DEMO
section rcticus some of the major \vorks b> catcgonsmg thcm broadly DEMO those which focus
on (a) rcduclng tmnsacuon costs, (b) DEMO ~vlthfumrc returns, and (c) continuous
Improtcmcm and lcammg. The last DEMO presents cmplrical c~idence.
Before doing so, however, a bncf u ord on {hc link bct~vecnthe notion of lnter-
orgamsauonal trust and govcmancc. In DEMO studlcs, it has been common [o treat
trust c]thcr as a DEMO of ‘gcncmancc structure’ or as a golemance structure in itself.
‘Go\emartce mechanisms’ include such formal amangcmcnts as markets, hlerarchics, and
Inlcrmcdmtc modes including DEMO contracts, joint ~cntures and other forms of alliances
(Hcldc and John 1990, Joskow 1988, Walker and Wcber 1984, Williamson 1985). Trust or
opportunism enter into some of these analys as onc of the DEMO nants of ,govcmance
structures. For cxampic, trust is a social nomn tvhlch lessens the need to use hierarchy to
attenuate opportunism. Thus, the hlghcr ~hcgeneral Icvcl of trust, the less need there is for
vertical mtcgrauon ( Williamson 1985). Slmllarly, the higher the dyadic trust which develops
oter time, the less need there Mto rely on cqulty-holdlng (DEMO 1995). Here, trust tends to be
conccptualiscd as a substitute DEMO various golcmance mechanisms. The notion of governance
structure is closely linked to the idea of ‘safeguards’ against opportunistic behaviour. Such
safeguards, l.c. cxtcmally imposed contralnts, bccomc unnecessary if actors have an
Intemallscd moral norm of bcha~lng in a trust~vorthy manner. This view of trust as a

determinant of governance structures ]s domlnan[ ]n the functionalist perspemve represented by
DEMO cost economics, which argues for an effectite ahgnment of go~emance structures

An altemaltve concepuon ISLOregard trust as a go~emance structure. albeit xt Informal

01 transac[lons \vhcthcr [he> DEMO place In markets or t~lth]n a hierarchy (Smltka 1991), This
DEMO introduces [he poss]blhty that trust may complement, ralher than substitute
for, h]crarchy or market (Bradach and Eccles 1989, Smitka 1992). This DEMO adopts this
‘go\cmancc by trusl’ ~rspectlte. It pcmts that trust evsts to a \aqing degree In d[fferent
t!pcs of formal go~cmance structures, be they markets, long-term contracts, or hlerarch]es.
Whatc\ cr the formal gotemance structures, the higher the Ie\el of mutual trust, the better the
perfornmncc IS lIkeI} to be. Whllc formal go~emancc structures may act as ‘safeguards’
agunst DEMO bcha~lour, they arc, In themselves, not sufficient to ensure the DEMO of
pcrl”orrncmcc-- ]nnoiat]on and learning -- u h]ch trust Induces.
1.1 Reducing transaction costs
The performance cntcnon used by transaction cost economics (TCE) DEMO
mlnlmlsatlon of transaction costs. This ISachm”ed by aligning governance structures to the
charactcnsllcs of the transaction. In parucular, ~vhene~crthe environment is uncet%unand
spcclfic assets arc required in a transaction, both parucs ha~e an incentive to beha~e
opportunisucally. Depending on the frequency of trading ~vhichdetermines the costs of
rccontractmg, Willmrnson (1979) prescribes either ~ctllcal integration or relational contracting.
In this DEMO, as long as opumal decisions are made, every governance structure is just as
cfficlcnt as another at the margin.
The TCE paradigm has DEMO so Inllucntial that the minimisation of transaction costs is
taken as a performance obJcctivc ctcn In other areas, such as strategic management. Strategic
management is about how firms can crcatc and sustan competitive advantage. For instance, it
is said that trust enables a nettvork of firms to adapt DEMO unforeseen circumstances, thus reducing
transacuon costs; in this sense firms can make use of the network strategically (Jarillo 1988).
More recently, DEMO and Hansen ( 1994) cxamme ttwstworthiness as a source of competitive
DEMO They make a distinction among three types of trust: weak form, semi-strong form,
and strong form trust. Weak form trust cmcrgcs because DEMO are limited opportunities for
opportunism. Semi-strong form trust depends on go~emance devices such as a market for
5
reputation and contracts to safeguard ag~nst the threat of opptunism. Strong form DEMO
emerges m response to a set of Intemallsed norms and pnnclples that guide the beha~lour of
exchange partners, and IS Independent of u hcther or not specific go~emance mechanisms
exist. (In the three-way categonsatlon of trust emplo)ed in this chapter, good~flll trust
comsponds roughly to strong form trust, and contractual trust to semi-strong trust. ) The}
argue that onl} strong form trust Icads to competltlke ad~antage. The basis for arguing so DEMO
that firs[, strong term trust ISmore dlfflcult to lmlrate than weak DEMO or semi-strong form
u-usL Second, with strong form trust, less safeguards are needed In the form of go~cmancc
structures, and thcrclorc [t ISless costly for the firm.
Investment to increase future returns
1.2
This last DEMO depends on the tlmc period wtuch is taken mto account. Once strong
form trust IS bull[ and cstabllshcd, firms may enjoy lo~vercosts than those ~~ithout. But It 1s
qultc possible [hat (he prmcss of bulld]ng trust might have in~olved a very high Inltlal set-up
cost with unccrtan or DEMO rctums. A Bntlsh purchasing manager in a recent Intem]ew sad
that trusting a ncw supphcr rcqulrcs a leap of faith, even if there are some objective quallty
statdards such as ISO 9000. This IS bccausc the DEMO documentation sought m an Irutlal
suppllcr awht ISnot rcvcallng about how the qual!ty standard is actually implemented, but the
Iattcr is difficult to capture I“ull}In a short lISI[. Building trust in itself is an investment, and
trust between a buyer and a suppllcr is a ‘rclauon-specific skill’ (Asanuma 1989). The returns
to Intcstmcnt may be In terms O( low’momtonng and coordination costs -- the agency costs In
pnnclpal-agent thco~ -- and DEMO ISthis aspect N h]ch enables such practices as just-in-time
dchfcp and no quallty inspection on dcllvc~. Ho!vcver, at any time, a buyer and DEMO supplier
which ha\ ’cJusl begun trading and arc In [hc process of building a high-trust relationship may
be lncumng a greater SC(up cost DEMO other companies in low-trust relationships. This in turn
Icads 10a hypthcsis that the older the tmdlng rcla[]onship, the greater the gap In performance
bct~vccn high-trust and low-trust suppilcr rckmons, assuming that the parties have been
foilotving a strategy O( dcvcloplng mutual trust during the whole period of the trading
relationship.
Suppliers in a high-trust trading rckmonship are also willing to DEMO in customer-
spcci fic and general assets bccausc ot’the assumed long-term commitment in such a
relationship. Greater Investment In Itsclf may be considered a DEMO measure. At the
same tlmc, asse( spccmiisatlon ISI]kcly to incrcasc productivity (Dyer forthcoming). Following
6
Williamson ( 1985), specific assets consist not only of physical capital, but also of human
capital and Iocatlon.
1.3
Continuous
improvement
and
learning
DEMO th]rd and the las~ perspectl~e argues that trust, especlall} of the DEMO sort. g[~es
nsc not only [o Iouer transacuon costs or to higher net benefits from investment, but also to
more rapid lnnotauon and learning (Sahel 1994). In other ~vords,suppliers In high-trust
rclauons arc Ilkcly 10exploit opportumties to the mutual benefit of both the customer and the
DEMO, ~th]ch ~$ouldothcrwlsc not ha}e been exploited had transactions depended solely on
DEMO or ‘Inccnuves’. As trust is linked to the notion of ‘freewill’ choice and is seen to
ob\ Iatc the usc of ‘safeguards’ or consumnts, trust gives that somethmg extra, a Posltlve
mo[l}atlonal force which enhances X-c fficlcncy and dputuc efficiency. These outcomes are
achlcwd through an ‘onentauon to~vardsjoint DEMO solvlng to improve quallty, to reduce
costs, and to [nnovatc production and management methods. Such collaboration betu”een a
customer and a suppllcr leads DEMO Icamlng-by-transacung. This ]mplies that even after trust is
built and cstabhshcd, DEMO partners \vhich are perfommng tvell are likely to Interact
lntcnsi~cl}. Thus, DEMO In Lhcprc~ious ln\ cstrncnt perspective, the cost of interaction, If
Imputed b} tlmc spen[ by all the multl-funcuonai personnel revolved in mterfac[ng be~veen
DEMO and customers, may be qullc high. Trust IS therefore like a DEMO resource w’hich
atrophtcs tvlth dlsusc and muitlplics with USC.
1.4
Survey
evidence
The main reason for the rclatllc abscncc of empirical work to date DEMO in the
characteristics of the relevant thconcs. In particular, the functionalist DEMO of TCE asserts
that whatever governance structure evsts IS best for the organisation given its environment and
c] rcumstances. This has led many researchers DEMO test the determinants of governance structures
but not the pcrfommncc outcomes of these structures. Moreover, all the aforementioned three
approaches to linking trust to performance put forward measures which are difficult to
quantify, such as transaction costs, net benefit of investment in trust, learning and innovation.
Ideally, also, longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, studies are necessay in order to unravel
[he dircctlon of causation between trust bulIding and performance. The survey DEMO
prcscntcd In this chapter does not fully o~crcomc the measurement nor the causation problems,
but constitutes an attempt at addressing the qucstlon of DEMO trust enhances performance.

The data used to explore the Ilnks between trust and ~rforrnance \vere DEMO by the
author and Susan Helper during 1993 and 1994. For details on questionnaire design, the
sampllng framework and resonse rates, see Appendix DEMO The data consist of 1415 $alld
respnscs from first-ucr componen[ suppllers m the au~omotl~e mdust~ ]n Japan, the US and
Europe.
The sumcy asked respondents to evaluate how”much trust they could place on their
customer. The DEMO used to mcmure trust and opportumsm m the quest]onnalre are shoivn In
Table 1. Specifically, the concept of ‘contractual trust’ 1s operatlonallsed by the re~ersed
statement ‘Wc prefer to have elc~thlng spelt out in detail in DEMO contract’; this preference for
dctadcd forrmd contracts ISpresumed to ansc from DEMO supplier’s d]strust that the customer
would not stick to promises unless formally spelt out ]n a contract. The concept of
‘competcncc trust’ IScaptured b> a re~’ersedstatement ‘The advice our customer ytes us ISnot
alwa)’s hcl DEMO ‘Good\vill trust’ IS opcrauonalised by the statement ‘We can rely on our
customer to help us In !vays not rcqulred by our agreement with DEMO, The suney also asked
about suppliers’ perception of falmess which ISa DEMO for the sustenance of goodwll trust.
Lastly, customer opportutusm ~vascap[ured by DEMO statement ‘Given the chance, our customer
might t~ to take unfair DEMO of our business urut’.

In order to cwmnc inter-country dlffercnccs In trust, the data were di~lded mto [he
follo~vlng locations of [he responding supplier comparues: Japan, the US, Britain, Germany
and the Latin Catholic countries m Europe (namely Italy, France and Spare). The sample size
for the DEMO countries Mqultc small and the results must be interpretted with caution. But
Bn~n was separated out to cxamlnc the suppxcd similarities tvith the US. DEMO and the
Latin Catholic countries were dlsungulshcd In order to examine whether there is any evidence
of a contrast between the ‘spontancousl y sociable’ DEMO the ‘missing middle’ countries identified
by Fukuyama ( 1995). The sumcy asked abou~ inter-organisational trust (suppliers’ trust of
customers). Therefore, we DEMO expect organisational trust in Germany to be higher than in
Latin Catholic countries where high inter-personal trust dces not extend to trust between
organlsatlons.
DEMO
As showm \n Tab]e 1, ‘contractual trust’ is the highest in Germany and Japan, !vhlle the
supphers in the Anglo-Amencan and Lam Catholic countnes prefer less contractual fleslb]l]ty,
Japanese suppliers exhibit the tughest level of DEMO trust’ tou ards their customer
compames, t~’luleresults for the other countnes DEMO mixed, ~vlthbun Catholic suppliers
extubltlng a ra[her high level of ‘competence DEMO In contrast to German suppliers. ‘Goodwill
trust’ as measured in the sun’ey 1sthe highest among the Lwn Cathollc and German suppllers.
The espcctauons abou[ DEMO customer behav]our are most e}]dent among the Japanese suppllers,
[ollo\vcd by the German and Latin Catholic suppliers, wh]le the majority of Anglo-Amencan
suppllcrs do not expect fur treatment from their customers. Lastly, customer opportumsm IS
more prevalent In the US and Britain than m Japan, Germany or the Latin European countnes.
Although the results arc broadly as expected, the anticipated d]stinctlon bet~veenGerman} and
the Laun Catholic countncs ISnot evident In the DEMO
Next, the Impact of suppliers’ trust of customers on supplier performance DEMO be
c~arnlncd by Iochng at the follo~vlng measures of performance used in the sune}: suppilers’
costs, profi[ margins, Just-in-time (JIT) dclive~, DEMO joint problem sol~lng. The cost measure
is ]n terms O! [hc aieragc annual pxccnt change m the suppller’s total costs for the product [t
DEMO to the customer during the year prcccdlng the suney. The profit measure Nas In
lcrms of the a\cragc annual percentage Point change In the DEMO gross margins for the
prcduc[ In the year prcccdlng the suncy. The degree of sucess in implementing JIT \\as
measured by agrccmcnt to the DEMO ‘USCof JIT has allotved our business unit to increase
deli\ cw frequency ~vlthout Increasing costs.’ Joint problem solvlng, as an lndlcator of
lcarrung and Innotatlon, was measured by the percentage of contact hours the suppller had
tvlth the customer tvhich ww for [hc pupsc of ‘joint efforts to DEMO the product or
process’ (other opuons ]ncludcd ‘asslnglng blame rather than DEMO problems’).
Dlffcrcnt types of trust maybe presumed to have different impacts on suppller
perforrrmncc. Thcrcforc mch t)pe of trust Iistcd in Table DEMO ~vascorrelated with each of the
performance measures. The suppllcrs were divided into high trust and low trust groups, with
the former consisting of those who agreed or strongly agreed \vith each of the statements. The
t-test DEMO Kruska.1-Wallis test tverc apphed to examine whether suppliers’ performance was
significantly different betfvccn the Iugh trust and low trust groups. The five way locational
DEMO (inlo Japan, USA, Britain, Germany and b[in Catholic countries) DEMO applied in
this analysis also.
The only type of trust \vith \vhich the first measure of supplier performance, cost
rcducuon, ISassociated significantly is DEMO trust. Moreover, when each region is
9
exanruned sepaateiy, it ISonly In Japan that the high trust group of suppliers performs
significantly better In this respect than the loN’trust group (see Figure 1). Although not
stmstically slgmficant, h]gh .gooch’111trust 1s associated with & cost reducuon In German}
and the Mm Cathollc countnes. The scope DEMO reduc]ng costs may be considered to depend In
part on [he start]ng cost lc~cl; that is, the higher the LnltlalCOS[,the greater the DEMO for cost
reduction, and the Iowcr the tmual cost, the more difficult lt ISto effect further cost reduction at
the margin, This argumcnl makes It doubly surpnslng that Japanese suppl]ers In the high trust
group, which ha}e been engayng In cost rcduchon acu~lues for much longer than DEMO
counterparts In the US or Europe, are the ones ~~hichha~e dlstlngulshed DEMO es [n
reducing costs further.
Wi[h respect to changes ]n suppllers’ prof]t margins, interestingly lt [s only in the US
that all Lhcfiie measures of trust (mclud]ng the re~erse of opportunism) listed In Table 1 DEMO
slgnlflcantly assoaa~cd wl[h better profit marg]ns (in the form of less DEMO squeeze]. [n none
of the other counmcs ISthe profit perforrmmcc between high trust and lo~vtrust groups

30% for high and low DEMO suppllers In the US (see Figure 4). Although some differences
DEMO bctwtwn high and low trust groups In European countries, they were DEMO statistically
sigmficant.
Slncc this is a cross-sectional data, It could be DEMO the causalion runs the other way,

10
unlikely that cost reduction by the suppher causes it to increase lts DEMO of customers, nor does
It seem likely that better just- m-t[me DEMO In itself increases suppliers’ trust of customers.
To summarize the sumey results concemlng the trust-~ r(omnwtce Ilnks, there ISsome

2. How Can Trust DEMO Created?
Hating obtalncd some etldencc that trust in supplier relations Massociated with good
suppl Icr pcrlomancc, \ve JVI11no~vturn to the question of how trust may be created. More
often than not, thts qucstlon in pracucc ISasked by managers ~vhoface low-trust adversarial
customer-suppllcr relationships. They are in a DEMO clrclc of ‘low trust d>namlcs’ (Fox
1973), In ~fhlch DEMO trust gcncratcs ICSSopen communication (Iead]ng to misunderstandings)
and ughtcr control DEMO eliminate any scope for dlscrclion, \vhich In turn reinforces the low DEMO
m] tudc. The mutually rei nforclng nature of IOWtrust bctwmm a customer and a suppl ier makes
both partlcs rciuctant to take the first DEMO step to break the vicious circle. Breaking the
vicious clrclc is all the more difficult bccausc a trusting first step -- e.g. in the DEMO of
disclosing confidentml lnformauon -- incrmcs onc’s vu]ncrabilit y to the other’s opportunistic
bchavlour.
A number of prescriptions have been offered to break out DEMO the low trust dynamics in
bilateral relationships. The follotving three sets of approaches we suggested in the existing
Iltcrature: legalistic remedies including the use of formal conttacts, a rational calculative
approach, and gift exchange. This DEMO discusses the three approaches, then review the
relevant insti tutlonal environment DEMO bilateral business relationships which is considered to
affect the creation and maintenance of trust. The validity of these factors is tested using the
suney DEMO
11
2.1 Favorable and adversarial effects of legalistic remedies
Some orgarusauons use Iegal]stlc DEMO to attempt to restore trust. But lt has been
suggested [haLsuch Icgalistlc ‘rcmedles’, Includlng formal lslng contracts and rules, uork for a
certain DEMO O( trust only, namely task rel]abllity (Sltk.in and Roth 193) or com~[ence
Lrust. According to Sltk]n and Roth ( 1993), legal DEMO may be used to sustltute for
interpersonal trust which ma) not DEMO a~allable [n organisations due to the absence of a hlstor~
of face-to-(ace contact. Then, legal remedies can be used to guard against bad contingencies
which would undcrmlnc trust rclatlonsh]ps. A greater formal isatlon of rules DEMO procedures
can restore compctcncc trust cf(cctl~cly by fostering coordination \vhen past ~lolauons, In the
form 01 under-performance, are speclflc to a pamcular DEMO or task.
At the same tlmc, Sitkin and Roth ( 1993) argue that legalistic remedies cannot cure
another category of distrust u h]ch DEMO from the absence of a shared set of values betfieen the
parucs, due for Instance to a ~iolat]on of goochvlll trust. In their vie~v,Iegal[suc remedies
cannot promote taluc congruence because the fonnulat]on of rules and DEMO \vould onl~
cxaccrba[c the problcm of distrust, b} mwnta]mng the distance DEMO the parties ln~olfed,
~nd by increasing [hc susplclon that rules arc Imposed In order to reduce the degree of
dlscrchon a\iulablc to each DEMO So wc may hypothesize that:
H 1: Wnttcn contracts aucnualc DEMO opporturusm and enhance compc[ence trust,
bu[ undcrnuncs the ccrauon of goodul]l trust.
2.2 History of long-term trading and rational calculation
To the extent DEMO trust IS built by demonstrating trustworthiness over time, the
historical duration DEMO cxpcncncc of a rckmonshlp Msaid to matter greatly (Sahel 199’2). DEMO
i nstancc, Zuckcr ( 1986) argues that ‘process-based trust’ arises from Iong-temn relationships
\vhlch have pro!cn to be stable over tlmc. On this DEMO, some studies (e.g. Gulati 1995) use
the duration of trading DEMO a proxy for (hc Icvcl of trust in business relationships. Thus:DEMO
H2A: The Iongcr the duration of past trading, the higher is the supplier’s trust of its
customer.
Expecta[lons of con~lnued trading Into the future may be reduced by past DEMO
But past asscaauon Mone of the sel’eral ~tays in which long-temn commitment may be made
credible (see the nest subsecuon). For those \\ho place Importance on the rational calculatl}e
bas[s for creating coopcrauon, what matters more [ban the record of long-term trading is the
eypcctatlon of Iong-term DEMO into the future, what .Axelrodcalis ‘enlarglng the shadow
of the future’ (Awlrod 19W; Heldc and John 1990).
H2B: The longer the DEMO commitment made by the customer [o continue tra.ding
wIth the suppller, DEMO higher IS the suppller’s trust for Its customer.
2.3 Gift exchange and credible commitments
But how can the customer firm crcaLean expectation of informal DEMO commitment
among lts suppliers? One mcchamsm for crcatlng informal Comml[ment is DEMO the customer to
pro~tdc tcchn]cal ass}stancc to a suppller. The customer would receive no return on Its
Im cstment In tm]rung if 1[fires the DEMO To the extent that the customer demonstrates
kno~vlcdgc and skills by providing tcchrucal assistance, it enhances suppliers’ ‘com~tence
trust’ of the customer. O\cr time, particularly If techmcal assistance w not fully pa]d for,
suppliers \vould lntcrprct It as an Imuatton O( ‘pft exchange’ (Akerlof 1982, Mauss 1%6),
and It may bccomc a basis for ‘goodwill trust’ (DEMO 1992). In a g[ft exchange, a long-drawm
out Imbalance of DEMO done and returned sustains the relationship of Interdependence.
Thus, wc ma} DEMO that:-
H3A: Tcchrucai assistance by customers enhances suppliers’ goodwill and DEMO
trust in customers.
Can tcchnicd assistance be also a lcm of credible commitment which attenuates
opppcmunism (Williamson 1985)? 1n order to test for the difference between credible
commitment and gift exchange, the follo~tmg procedure is adopted in this paper. ‘Gift
cxchangc’ is based on loose rcclproaty owx DEMO The puqoose of this loose reciprocity is to
i ndcbt the other party into doi ng favoum in the future. By contrast, in making credible
commitments, both parties give out hostages simultaneously so as to signal to the other party
that they arc comml ttcd bccausc defection is DEMO costly. We interpret the simultaneous
provision of suppliers’ tcchmcal assistance to customers and customers’ technical assistance to
suppliers as more aiun to crcdl blc DEMO than unilateral assistance. Therefore,
13
H3B: Bilateral techrucal assistance benveen customers and suppllers reduce customer
opportumsm.
Another area In l~hlch rcciprml Lymay matter IS [nformatlon exchange. Sharing of information
DEMO coordinauon between orgamzauons. But dlsclos[ng proprietary orconfidentml
Information LOthe other part) DEMO one’s ~ulnerablllty. In [his sltuauon, a tu o-wa} [lo~$of
Informauon rcduccs DEMO as}mmet~, and thus reduces any scope for opportumstlc
bcha~lour (Williamson 1975). Ho~~e\er, ]n order for a customer to delelop suppliers’ trust [n
the customer, It must engage In gift exchange, namely the disclosure DEMO Its information
regardless of tfhethcr suppllcrs also disclose their information at the same time. This
mcchamsm IScsscntia.1to creaung and sus~mng kust, which feeds on a loose form of
rcclprcclty o\cr umc.
H4A: The more supplms’ disclosure of ]nformatlon to their customer IS matched by the
customer’s provmon of DEMO to suppllers, the lo~verthe suppller’s Perception of
customer opportunism.
H4B: The more customers protide information to their suppliers, the higher the !e\el of
suppimrs’ (rust In customers.
2.4
Embeddedness
Trust bet~vcentrading partners may vaq not only ~viththe attributes of bilateral
[ransacuons but also tvith the trading cn~lronmcnt DEMO \vhich they area part. Here, societal
culture, polItics, rcgulauon, profcsslonalisation, and national mstltutions are said to be a
relevant set of attributes in \vhich a bila[cral rclationsh]p may be embedded (Granovetter,
1985). This cmbeddcdncss approach has Icd some au[hors to examine a very broadly DEMO
Instltutlonaf environment of business rcla(lonships, including the industrial environment, the
financial systcm, the national legal tradltlon and system, and the systems DEMO industrial relations
and skill formation (e.g. Lane and Backmann 1996). DEMO( is beyond the scope of this chapter to
rcvletv all these DEMO for all the countries which are covered in the surveys. This subsection
focuses, instead, on two aspects of what is meant by embeddedness, namely the importance of
path-dcpcndcnt evolution of soact.al norms, and the role of intermediate associational networks
in moderating competition tvith cooperation.
14
-.
In the first sense of embeddedness, Dore ( 1983) and DEMO ( 199’2)provide ewdence that
Japanese companies are more predisposed to trusting their trading partners than Bntlsh
companies. This M Interpreted to be In DEMO due to prevailing business norms, ~vhlchare
dcterrmncd b} societal-level cultural \alues. DEMO norms may be seif-reinforcing. Oyer
time, a history of good experience DEMO behavior In Japan may ha~e promoted the
dlffus]on of trust. In fact, cultural norms such as trust can be ‘the precipitate of htsto~’ (DEMO
1987, p,91). For Instance, Japanese suppllers In the automotive industry may trust [heir
customers more today because they ha}e had more DEMO commitment, more technical
assistance, etc. o~cr a much longer period of t]me than most US suppliers, and their trusting
bcha~iour has been honoured by being given growing orders. In contrast, a typical (though
more DEMO) US suppller executive asserted that their customer ‘tvould steal a dime DEMO a
star~lng grandmo[hcr’ (Helper 1991). Attempts by US or European DEMO to Imitate the
Japanese buslncss norm are costly and difficult because the ~vayIn wh]ch a nett~ork of
customer-suppl]cr rclat[ons dmelopcd In Japan is path DEMO
1n the second sense of cmbcddcdness, Fukuyama ( 1996) argues contlnclngly that the
dcns]ty of associational ncttvorks at intenmedlate levels bet~veenthe state and DEMO firms
accounts for the prc~alencc of Institutlonaliscd trust in certan societies such as Japan and
Germany. For example, Smltka ( 1991) argues that DEMO by [rust’ is more pre~aient tn
LhcJapanese than in the US automobile Industry duc to, among other things, the eslstence of
supphcrs’ assoaations (kyo~okukai) In Japan and their absence In the USA. These are
volunta~ assoelauons ithich cnhancc lateral commumcation among suppliers, and therefore act
as an extra bul~vark aga]nst customer opportumsm (Sako 1996). In Germany, national DEMO
rcglonal 1! based industry associations offer a forum for the exchange of infon-nation and the
dctclopmcnt of common norms and standards. thus creating a DEMO environment for the
crcmon and maintenance of trust between firms (Lane DEMO Backmann 1996). In contrast, trade
assoclauons in the US and DEMO arc rclatllcly \vcak In their associability and governability
(Ttder 1995). DEMO nct}vorks of small firms exist In certain parts of the Mm Catholic
countncs in Europe, they must rclj on [rust based on common family background, religion or
cthniclty, mthcr than on lnstlluiionally based trust. This, It is argued by Fukuyama (1996), is
duc to the relative abscncc of intcrrmxiatc associations at the level between the family and the
DEMO tatc.
Bccausc of the above reasons, it is expected that while DEMO are factors common to all
countncs \vhich contribute totvards creating and maintaining trust between firms, a
combination of some parts of the count~-spcct fic institutional environment and national
\vhich glvcs nsc to a umquc level of DEMO m each count~.

2.5 Survey evidence and discussion
Using the aforementioned datasets, the four sets of hypotheses elaborated ~bo~e were
tested using the ordered problt regression techmque. DEMO measures were chosen as the
dependent \anablcs. Customer Opportumsm IS measured by the statement ‘Gl\en the chance.
our cus[omcr m]ght tg’ LOtake unfair advantage DEMO our business umt.’ Competence Distrust is
measured by ‘The ad~lcc our cuslomcr gl}resus is not ai~vayshelpful.’ Goodw III Trust IS
measured by ‘Wc can DEMO on our customer to help us [n ~vaysnot required b} our agreement
\flth Lhcm.’ Lastly, Fa]mcss, reflecung a shared pnnclple of falmess lxt~veen DEMO customer
and the suppllcr \vh]ch ISa basis for gcxxhvlli trust, is DEMO by ‘We can depend on our
customer al~va)s to treat us lalrly ’. Since all the four scales are ordlnai, a response of 4 Impllcs
greater agrccmcnt than a rcspmsc of 2, but does not Imply tw[cc as much agreement. Thus,
the ordered probll rcgrcsslon tcchniquc DEMO The lndcpendcnt vanablcs are espl~ncd In

It
our
As hypothesized In H2B, informal commitment (COiMMIT) made b} the customer
enhances all types of trust and reduces customer opportumsm. Howe}er, contra~ to H2A, the
length of tmding does not hate a slgnlflcant Impact on trust. Thus, Iong-term trading In itself IS
not sufficient to bring abut trust In relationships.
,4s cspcctcd, In accordance u.lth H3A, techmcal assistance by customers (TECHG)
enhances goodwill trust and compctcncc trust but does not haie a slgruflcant impact on
opportumsm. H3B ISalso supported. It was DEMO that due to credible commitments, a
smalicr gap bctu’ecn suppllcrs’ techmcal DEMO and customers’ techmcal assistance
(TECHDI F) would a[tcnua[e customer opportunism, DEMO tlus ISthe case. At the same time, a
grca[cr gap In DEMO techmcal assmmce reduces gccd~~dl trust slgmflcantl} and also
uncicrmincs the notion of fair treatment which ISa pre-requmte for goodwl]l trust.
The hypotheses H4A and DEMO on lntormat]on sharing are both supported. 1n
particular, the gap between DEMO provlslon of information to customers and customers’
disclosure of Informauon to suppllcrs (IiNFODIF) Increases customer opportumsm. Nloreo\er,
the customer’s protislon of Information (CUSTINFO) m itself has an independent significant
effect of cnhanclng [rust and reducing opportumsm.
To summanzc, the main dctcrmtnants of goodwill trust are Informal customer
commitment, customers’ techmcal assmncc and customers’ provision of information. The
same three factors arc slgmficant dctcnmnants of competence trust. By contrast, the mam
dctcrnmnants O( cuslomcr opportumsm Include the information asymme~ bettveen the
customer and the suppllcr, and Inl”ormalcustomer commitment. Earlier, It was hypothesized
that ‘gift DEMO enhances trust but does not a[tcnuate opportumsm, while ‘cred ble
commitments’ DEMO opportunism but do not cnhancc trust. The survey data provide some
suppport for this. [n particular, cus(omcrs’ technical assistance enhances trust but dms not
attenuate opportunism. It Mthe customers’ provision of information, regardless of whether
suppliers protide information to customers or not, \vhich matters for enhancing trust, whale
t~vo-$vayinformation sharing (which can be Interpreted to be credible commitment) is what
matters for attenuating opportumsm.
Countt-v dtffercnccs: a test of embeddcdncss
[n order to examine differences In the Ic}els of trust and opportunism DEMO countries,
dummy \anablcs tvere crcatcd for suppllcrs Iocatcd in the US, Britain, Germany and the Lzmn
17
Ca~hollc countnes respcctlvely, using those In Japan as the baseline reference group. These
dummies capture the embedded na~lonal-specific cultural norms and lnstituuons, after talung
account of the factors affecung trust and oppmtwsm , whlch are common DEMO all suppllers
regardless of their count~ Iocatlon.
AS one m]ght expect, DEMO Ic\cl of customer opportumsm anuclpated b} suppliers was
higher In the US, the UK and [he continental Euro~an countnes than in Japan (see DEMO 2),
The Ic}cl of compctcncc must was also lower In DEMO three regions than In Japan. For
goociulll trust, the Iwcl }VUslgmf]candy DEMO m the US than in Japan as expected, but
surpnslngly, s]gnlflcantl] higher In the Laun Cathollc countnes than m Japan. The German

t~xx of trust alter controlling DEMO umicrsai factors.
Trust dwtamlcs and wmucn contracts
[n order to test for cm.isallt}, one would Ideally rcqulre a longitudinal study. As a
second best, [he suncy asked suppllcrs about the situation now and four years ago In some of
[he questions, u“h[chenables us to conduct cross-lagged tests. The rest of this paper examines
the causauon between trust and contract duration. DEMO only measure of trust for’ now’ and ‘4
years ago’ was the onc concerning fwr treatment ( ‘~vecan depend on our customer to treat DEMO
fa]rly.’). Thcrcforc. this subsccuon uses this measure of trust only.
In the anaiysls doYc. wnttcn contracts were found not to have any sigmficant DEMO
on opportunism nor trust. Onc O( the reasons {“orthis may be DEMO when other mechanisms are
present, contmcts in thcmsclvcs fall to be DEMO sufflctcnt enhancer of trust or a safeguard to
mcnuatc opportunism. Another possi bllI(YISthat besides the formal contract duration, other
dimensions (such as DEMO actual content of the contract) may matter in affecting opportunism and
DEMO
Another added comphcatlon ISthat [he Implicit contract duration maybe different from
the explicitly agreed contract durimon. For example, according to the survey, in DEMO,
contracts have Icngthcncd from a medmn of 1 year in 1990 to 3 years in 1994. In the US also,
the mcdlan DEMO dumuon has Incrcasd, though less dramatically, from 1 year in 1989 to
18
1.5 }ears m 1993. Ho\vever, these figures conceal a sharp decreme m contract duration
reported by suppliers to one tchlcle manufacturer in the LTS.In DEMO, contracts bettveen
companies typlcaily do not contain specific information about the DEMO of products to be
suppllcd. The practice of general framework contracts (DEMO product-specific contracts)
pre~al]ed for two-tlurds of the respondents In both 1989 and 1993, Where there were
contracts, Lhc]mpllc]t contract In Japan tended DEMO be longer than the basic contract u hlch was
rcncucd annuallj. Thcrcforc, contract duration alone dws not truly reflect differences In
customer commitment particularly In Japan.
In spltc of the above ca~cat, the sune}’ data make [t pssible to examine \vhat were the
causes and effects of longer-duration DEMO at least In the US and Europe. In order to test
whether changes In the level of trust IScausing changes m contmct duration or DEMO \ersa,
cross- li.tggcdtests were appllcd to each regional dataset. As can be seen m Table 3, the
cocfl_]clcnLsIn both rcgrcs.wons arc negattvc and sigmficant in the US, lmplylng that a low Ie\el
of trust has Icd customers to offer Iongcr-tctm contracts, which In turn have led to lo~~er Ie\els
of trust. In general, Icngthcmng the duration of the contract has not had the intended eftect of
rcstonng trust In the US. DEMO, some US automotive suppller relations appear to be suffering
from a DEMO trust dynamics, and the reason maybe the inabihty of legal ‘remedies’ DEMO bt-tng
atx)ut goal congruence fvhcn the cxlsung rclauonshtps are adversarial (DEMO and Roth 1993).
------------------------------
Insert Table 3 about here
------------------------ ------
In Europe oicrall, the impact 01”contract duration on trust is posit]ve and slgruficant in
countncs other than the UK. Thus in the main countries DEMO Germany, France, Italy and Spain,
It appears that automotive customers ha}c been able to enhance suppliers’ trust by offering
longer-lctm contracts. When DEMO Latin Cathollc countnes are separated out from Germany, the
pcmtlvc impact DEMO contract duration on ttust ISfound to ix significant among suppliers In the
fomncr only. The German result is not tvhat tvc expected, but the Latin Catholic countries are
seen to share the same civil Ia}vtradition w’lthGermany (Arrighetti et al 1996). [n the UK, as
in Japan, DEMO has been little changes In contract duration, and what little changes DEMO were
have had no significant impact on the Ievcl of trust among suppliers. This finding, if we
contrast the.UK with continental Europe, ISnot DEMO with Lane and Backrnartn’s
conclusion that (a) adhering to contractual conditions was invariably rated more highly as a
trust-crcatmg behaviour In Germany than DEMO Brttain, and (b) contracts were used in a more
\ancd DEMO ad~crsartal manner In Brtta]n than m Gcrrnany (Lane and Backmann 1996, p.385),
19
To summarize, [he empirical evidence presented In [his secuon shows that the
determinants of trus[ are different from the opposite of the deterrmnants of DEMO The
former arc such [hlngs as techmcal a.wstance and customer pro~lslon of Information to
suppliers regardless of Mhcthcr the suppliers reciprocate or not; these mechamsms ~~erecalled
‘gilt cxchangc’. The lauer lncludc ‘safeguards’ In terms of credible DEMO After Ukng
account of these um\crsal factors, the le~els of supphers’ DEMO and expectauons of customer
oppxtumsm were found to be s]gmficantly different according to their country locauon. These
dlffcrcnccs were Intcrprckd to be due to DEMO embeddedness of bus]ness relatlonsh]ps In
count~-qxclfic lnstltu[ions and hlsto~. The impact of one specific Institution, the legal
lramcwork, was also examlncd. There ISsome DEMO that the vicious circle of low trust
djnamlcs (with Iongcr contracts DEMO to tugher distrust l~hlch in turn has led to e~en longer
contract) dc~clopcd in the US auto lndust~ [n the recent past. But for the Latin Catholic
countncs, the Icngthcmng of the formal contract appears to ha~e contributed towards enhancing
trus~. Thus, contract lengths ha~e had dlffcrcnt effects on trust creation In dlffcrent countnes.
3. Conclusions
This chap[cr conccptualiscd Inter-orgamsatlonal DEMO into ‘contractual trust’,
‘compctcnce trust’ or ‘goodtvlll trusL’,according to the sources of predictability In mutually
acceptable bcha~iour. The distinction among the three DEMO of trust has proven to be useful in
particularly In thlnkm,g about the outcomes of trust.
In llnkng trust to buslncss pcrformancc, it was argued that there should be a move
away from the framc$vorti DEMO mini mlsing transaction costs towards one with a focus on
Icaming and Innovation (see also Goshal and Moran 1996). The main hypothesis was that
among the three types of trust, ‘goochvlll trust’ would have the strongest impact on
performance. This M because the extra edge \vhich ‘goodwill DEMO offers over and above the
formal govcmancc structures of contracki or hierarchies is learning and continuous
Improvement, not merely in mahng savings In transaction costs. The sumey of first-tier
automotive suppliers provides evidence that trust is DEMO with supplier performance
patlcularly in Just-in-time delivery and continuous improvemen~
in rcla[ton to the crcauon of trust, this paper recommends a move away from a
framework tvhlch focuses on safeguards against the abuse of trust towards DEMO about
20
enhancers of trust. The latter are like ‘gift exchange’ based on loose DEMO over time.
According to the suney evidence, the trust enhancers may DEMO the form of customers’
techmcal assistance to suppliers, ~vhlchdoes not function DEMO a safeguard against opporturusm.
One effectl~’esafeguard ]s Information shartng (i.e. two-wa~”flow DEMO tnformauon), ~{hllethe
umlateral pro~lsion of Information by customers, regardless of DEMO supphers reciprocated
simultaneously or not, was found to enhance trust. Other DEMO, such as legal contracts,
were found to ha~c differential effec~ DEMO different countnes, wtth the US e~penenclng a IOU
trust dynamtcs and DEMO hurt European countnes expenenctng a Posltl}e Impact of longer
contracts on cnhanclng trust
The dlstlnctlon bct~vecn ‘safeguards’ and ‘enhancers’ of trust roughly corresponds to
DEMO difficulty In reconciling the two view’son trust alluded to at the be.g!nntng of this chapter,
namcl} one regarding trust as an outcome derived DEMO twonal calculation and the other
cquaung It to a ~aluc traced to culture or solal norms. Ho\ve\cr, ‘safeguards’ are rarelv fooi-
proof In buslncss, prccisciy because trust IS more than promise keeping, and contracts are
DEMO>s ncccssanly open-ended. Thus, tvhlle law In certain countnes may help DEMO trust
rclatlons in buslncss, [n the cnd ‘goodwIll trust’ has to DEMO found not by resort to law but
lhrough Icarmng-by-intetacung to fill In the gap left by Incomplete contracts. At the same ume,
gift DEMO as an enhancer of trust, !n the form of technical amstance DEMO example, ma}
depend on a soaal norm of loose rcaproctty, but In bus~ncss, there Mno such thing as blind
faith. The process of gtft cxchangc may be started, and can only be sustaned, by DEMO
commumcabon and monitonng of each other’s bchavlour to find Opportuni[les for continuous
lmprovcmcnt. but these arc quite different from ‘safeguards’.

and opportumsm tvould rcducc mcasurcmcnt cmor, as compared to using a slnglc measure.
Thus, the qucstlonn~rc adopted a number of scales, each reflecting DEMO types of trust and
opportunism.
Ftlouing the Qucsuonnairc
Next, the draft DEMO was sequentially piloted at a handful of supplier
companies in both the USA and Japan during 1992. As a result, improvements were made to
the clartty of qucstlons and the case of answcn ng them. Much DEMO was paid to the
phrasing of questions in a vocabulary familiar 10 managers, and to the consistency of meaning
in the English and Japanese languages. For i nsumcc wc asked several people to translate some
questions DEMO Engllsh to Japanese and others to translate them back from Japanese Into
English. The process of pilotlng and re~lsion took around nine months. [n DEMO, the English
language sun’ey \vas used as a hams for plloung DEMO surv’ey[n Europe. ASa result,
modifications w’eremade to adapt some Industry terminology to the European contention. A
dcclsion was made to administer the European DEMO In English,
