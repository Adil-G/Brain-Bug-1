of such decision rules are the various expectation models DEMO risky

however, suggested that decision strategies like additive utility were
incompatible with our knowledge of human cognition. Furthermore, such models
to account for important empirical findings, such as intransitivity in
preferences (Tversky, 1969). Consequently, a number of simplified decision
rules, or choice heuristics, have been proposed. Such heuristics reduce
information processing demands by ignoring some potentially DEMO problem
information and by avoiding tradeoffs among values. For example, the
DEMO heuristic (Tversky, 1969) chooses the alternative which is best
on DEMO most important attribute, ignoring all other information. While
heuristics can reduce DEMO processing demands, they can also lead to
decision errors such as DEMO

the choice objects, such as the correlation between attributes. One example
of a contingency effect is the increase in the use DEMO simplifying heuristics
as the number of alternatives increases (Payne, 1976).
Evidence of contingent information processing in decisions'has raised
the question of DEMO certain decision strategies are applied to solve certain
decision problems. In other words, what determines the decision on how to
choose? One general DEMO in trying to answer that question looks at
strategy selection as a function of both its costs, primarily the effort
required to use a rule, and its benefits, primarily the ability of a strategy
to DEMO the best alternative (Beach & Mitchell, 1978; Russo & Dosher, 1983).
The advantage of a cost-benefit approach to strategy selection is DEMO ability
to maintain the concept of calculated rationality (March, 1978), once the
costs of executing the decision process are included in the DEMO of
rationality. Furthermore, because the costs and benefits of various decision
DEMO will vary across different problems, the cost-benefit perspective
provides the potential DEMO explaining a variety of empirical results
concerning situation specific decision behavior.
The goal of this paper is
to examine the role of effort and DEMO

strategies for making a choice. First, an approach to understanding
contingent decision behavior using the concept of elementary information
processes and the method of DEMO simulation is introduced, and some prior
work by Johnson and Payne (1985) using that approach is
briefly discussed.
Next, a Monte-Carlo simulation DEMO of the effort and accuracy of choice
heuristics in
a variety of choice environments which extends the prior work by
Johnson and Payne (1985) in several directions is reported. Of particular
interest is

Hence, the major purposes of the paper DEMO threefold: 1)
To provide a
conceptual approach for modeling effort DEMO accuracy tradeoffs in choice; 2)
To report both simulation-based and DEMO evidence regarding-
patterns of
adaptivity in strategy selection in different choice environments; and 3) To
examine the extent to which the, empirical evidence on adaptivity validates the
conceptual approach used. As a secondary purpose, the empirical work provides
some of the most detailed process-tracing evidence to date DEMO responses
to time pressure in decision making.
Effort and Accuracy in Choice
One major difficulty in examining strategy selection from a cost-benefit
perspective has DEMO the lack of a conceptually appropriate measure of effort
that is easy to calculate. A closely related problem is
the lack of a common
DEMO which could be used to describe the process level similarities and
differences among the various choice models that have been proposed. This is
important DEMO strategy selection is
to be investigated at an information
processing level rather than at a more general level of analysis, such as
analytic vs. nonanalytic (Beach and Mitchell, 1978) or analytic vs. intuitive
(Hammond, 1986). A second area of concern with the cost-benefit approach has
Adaptive Decisions
6
been the lack of agreement on how to measure DEMO of choice. Johnson and
Payne (1985) have proposed solutions to these problems.
Measuring Strategy Effort. Building on earlier work by 0. Huber (1980),
Johnson (1979), and the ideas of Newell and Simon (1972), Johnson and Payne
(1985) suggest that decision strategies can DEMO decomposed into elementary
information processes (EIP's). A decision strategy DEMO rule could then be
thought of as a sequence of events, DEMO as reading the values of two
alternatives on an attribute, comparing DEMO, and so forth. A possible set of
EIP's for decision DEMO, similar to those suggested by Huber (1980) and
Johnson (1979), is listed in Table 1. One advantage of this approach is
DEMO
the EIP's provide a common language for describing seemingly diverse decision
strategies in terms of their underlying components.
Insert Table 1 about here
DEMO second advantage of this approach is
that a count of the total number
of elementary information processes required by a given strategy to reach DEMO
decision in a particular choice task environment can be used as a measure of
th effort associated with the use of that decision strategy DEMO
that task
environment (Johnson and Payne, 1985). Examples of the use of EIP counts to
measure processing load can be found in DEMO number of studies of cognition
(e.g., Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983; Carpenter & Just, 19750.
Measuring Accuracy. Accuracy of choice can be defined in
many ways. At
a very general level, quality of choice can be defined by basic principles
such as consistency in
preference. DEMO example, maintaining transitivity, or
the avoidance of errors such as selecting a dominated alternative, are often
suggested as normative decision principles. However, DEMO specific criteria
for decision quality can be developed in certain choice environments. In
the
Adaptive Decisions
N
* -in
area of risky choice, for instance, DEMO expected utility model, which can be
derived from certain principles of DEMO, is often suggested as a
normative decision procedure. A special case DEMO the EU model, the
maximization of expected value, has been used as a criterion to investigate
the accuracy of decision heuristics through computer DEMO (Thorngate,
1980). In the domain of nonrisky choice, the compensatory multi-attribute
utility (MAU) rule is often used as a criterion DEMO decision effectiveness
(e.g., Zakay & Wooler, 1984).
Examining Accuracy DEMO Effort in Choice. Johnson and Payne (1985)
examined both the DEMO and the accuracy of six decision rules for risky
choice. Effort was measured in terms of EIP's, and accuracy was measured both
terms of consistency in choice and EV maximization. The six decision rules
examined DEMO Johnson and Payne differed markedly in the amount of the available
information they considered. A priori, this was expected to be an important
determinant of both the accuracy and the effort resulting from their use. The
DEMO value (EV) rule, which is based on complete search of DEMO available
information, was at one extreme. The equiprobable heuristic is similar DEMO the
EV rule in that it examines all the alternatives and all outcomes. However,
it ignores one of the two attributes of a DEMO's outcomes, probability,
explicitly treating all events as equally likely. DEMO most-likely heuristic,
in contrast, examines only one outcome for each DEMO, the outcome with
the highest probability of occurrence, and selects the alternative with the
largest payoff for this outcome. The maximin heuristic ignores DEMO
entirely and selects the alternative with the largest minimum payoff.
Elimination by aspects (EBA) is a choice rule proposed by Tversky (1972). A
special version of EBA investigated by Thorngate (1980) that attends DEMO to
payoff information was also examined by Johnson and Payne. Each payoff of a

gamble is compared to a cutoff equal to the DEMO payoff. If a payoff is less
than the cutoff, the gamble DEMO eliminated from further consideration. The
i~.
rule terminates when either (a) one alternative remains, or (b) all attributes
have been considered, DEMO one must choose randomly from the remaining
alternatives. Finally, the random DEMO rule served as a baseline, simply
choosing an alternative at random DEMO no search.
Johnson and Payne conducted a series of Monte Carlo studies that varied
several aspects of the choice environment. The task variables - DEMO of
risky alternatives and number of outcomes- were varied at levels of 2, 4, and
8. Another aspect of the choice environment varied DEMO a context variable,
the amount of variance in probabilities within each gamble. This variable was
chosen because Thorngate (1980), using a simulation approach, had suggested
siT..that probability information may be relatively unimportant in making accurate
risky choices. However, Thorngate's method for constructing gambles ensured

method of probability generation that produced larger variances in the
probability distributions. Finally, the presence or absence of dominated

alternatives in a choice set was the second context variable examined.
The Johnson and Payne DEMO identified choice rules that appeared
to provide approximately the accuracy of normative procedures while requiring
substantially less effort. The results, however, were highly DEMO upon
characteristics of the choice environments. In the environment that closely
resembled Thorngate's, for example, the equiprobable rule appeared quite
accurate. It DEMO also a rule that maintained roughly the same accuracy as the
number of outcomes was increased. In contrast, when the variance of the
probabilities was increased, the most-likely heuristic became the most

accurate, whereas the equiprobable heuristic displayed a marked decrease in
accuracy. Furthermore, the most-likely rule was the only one to maintain
accuracy as the number of outcomes increased in the DEMO environment.
Thorngate's earlier statement about the importance of probability information,
therefore, was found to be of limited generality.
Another interesting result was the effect of the presence or absence of
dominated alternatives. The removal DEMO dominated alternatives reduced the
accuracy of some heuristics to almost chance levels.. Finally, Johnson and
Payne also found that task effects tended to have a greater influence on the
efotrequired by strategies, while context effects tended to have a greater
influence on accuracy.
Johnson and Payne concluded that DEMO could be highly accurate,
but that no single heuristic would do well across all contexts. Instead, if a
decision maker wanted to maintain a high level of accuracy with a minimum of
effort, he or she would have to choose among a repertoire of strategies,
contingent DEMO situational demands. In other words, a decision maker
striving to minimize DEMO errors and effort would have to be highly adaptive
in the use of decision processes.
Thus, the Johnson and Payne simulations, using EIP'DEMO to measure effort
and various criteria for assessing accuracy, were able DEMO yield interesting
and important conclusions about adaptivity in choice. However, this DEMO also
raised two very important issues. First, the original Johnson and DEMO
(1985) work investigated a few decision rules in one particular type of risky.
decision environment. Hence, one issue is whether these results generalize to
other rules and different types of choice settings. Second, the simulation
work helps to identify adaptive strategies for decision makers, assuming that
they wish to minimize either errors, effort, or some combination of the DEMO
9
Adaptive Decisions
10
A major unanswered empirical question is the degree to DEMO human decision
makers actually display such adaptivity to either errors or effort. The
remaining sections of the paper examine these two issues, utilizing further
computer simulation for the first and two experiments for the second.
Study DEMO: A Monte-Carlo Simulation of Effort
and Accuracy in Choice
The purpose DEMO this study was to investigate the generality of the
Johnson and Payne (1985) simulations by extending both the range of decision
strategies and DEMO environments studied. This study examined a set of ten
decision strategies, DEMO more than investigated by Johnson and Payne (1985).
Forms of DEMO lexicographic and elimination-by-aspects strategies are included
that are more consistent with those originally described by Tversky (1969;
1972). In addition, several DEMO not considered in the earlier
simulation and two strategies are that are combinations of other strategies
(e.g., an EBA rule plus an additive DEMO) are examined. The specific
strategies used are described in more detail DEMO
A second major change involves the decision task. In contrast to the
earlier simulations, the choice alternatives are constructed to have a set of
outcomes which have the same probability for each alternative. In other
words, each of the alternatives may have a different value for each outcome,DEMO
but the probability of receiving each outcome is the same for all the
alternatives. This allows us to also interpret the current decision task DEMO a
riskless choice task, in which the probabilities function as attribute DEMO
that apply across alternatives. Under a riskless interpretation, one can look
DEMO a probability of .25, for example, as the weight given to a particular
attribute across all alternatives. Alternately, under a risky choice
scenario, the .25 is the probability of obtaining that outcome. In previous
-N.6
Adaptive Decisions
simulation work (Thorngate 1980, Johnson and Payne, 1985), the probabilities
varied across alternatives, preventing the extension of the results to
riskless choice. This relationship between risky choice problems and multi-
attribute decision DEMO is discussed more fully in Keeney and Raiffa
(1976).
Finally, in addition to the task and context variables studied in the
earlier DEMO, the present study investigates the impact of time
pressures upon decision DEMO Time pressure is potentially one of the
most significant task variables. Under time constraints, a heuristic like EBA
4
(Tversky, 1972) might DEMO more accurate than a strategy such as maximization of
expected value. The reason is that the rate at which a heuristic's accuracy
degrades DEMO increasing time pressure may be slower than the rate at which a
more comprehensive processing rule, e.g., EV., degrades. One possible reason
for this is that heuristics require fewer operations and will generally be
"further along" when time runs out. Furthermore: time pressure relates to the
DEMO to which people use heuristics because they have no other choice
(DEMO, 1981). A more normative decision strategy like expected utility
maximization DEMO exceed the information processing capabilities of a decision
maker, given any "reasonable" time limit for making the decision. If use of a
more normative rule is effectively impossible, then the task of deciding how
to choose becomes a selection of the "best" among a set of DEMO
heuristics, not a decision on whether to use some heuristic or DEMO more
normative rule.
Decision Strategies
The ten decision strategies were implemented using the EIPs and
production system representation proposed by Johnson and Payne (1985). The
ten decision strategies varied substantially in the amount of the DEMO

information used to make a choice. The most information DEMO was a
version of a Weighted Additive (WADD) compensatory process. This strategy
considers the values of each alternative on all the relevant attributes
(outcomes) and all the relative importances (weights or probabilities) of the
different attributes (outcomes) to the decision maker. The rule develops a
DEMO value for each attribute by multiplying the weight times the value
and sums over all attributes to arrive at an overall evaluation of an
DEMO Then the alternative with the highest evaluation is selected.
°,
Thus, the weighted additive rule selects an alternative based on an exhaustive
search of the available information. Such a process is often suggested as a
DEMO procedure for multiattribute choices (Ulvila & Brown, 1982). In
contrast, the Random (RAN) choice rule chooses an alternative at random with
no search of the available information. Hence, the Random rule serves as a
minimum baseline for measuring both accuracy and effort.
In addition to DEMO two baseline rules, six individual heuristics for
multiattribute choice were implemented, along with two combination strategies.
The Equalweight (EQW) rule examines all DEMO and all attribute values
for each alternative. However, the rule ignores DEMO about the
relative importance of each attribute. Instead, the equalweight rule DEMO
by summing the attribute values for each alternative to get an overall value,
and the alternative with the highest total is selected. In DEMO contexts, the
equal weight rule has been advocated as a highly DEMO simplificaton of the
choice process (Dawes, 1979; Einhorn and Hogarth, 1975). The equal weight
rule is identical to the equiprobable rule DEMO risky choice investigated by
Thorngate (1980) and Johnson and Payne (DEMO). The Elimination by Aspects
(EBA) rule (Tversky, 1972) DEMO by determining the most important attribute
(the outcome with the highest DEMO (probability)). Then, the cutoff value
%
%

13
for that attribute is retrieved, and all alternatives with values for that
attribute below the cutoff are eliminated. This process continues DEMO the
second most important attribute, then the third, and so on, until one
alternative remains. This version of EBA differs from that examined by
Thorngate (1980) and Johnson and Payne (1985). The present version of EBA
does order search by attribute importance, so it more closely resembles the
EBA model originally proposed by Tversky (1972).
The Majority of Confirming Dimensions (MCD) rule has been suggested by
Russo DEMO Dosher (1983). This rule involves processing pairs of alternatives.
The DEMO for each of the two alternatives are compared on each attribute,
and a running score is kept of how many times each alternative DEMO a better
value on an attribute. The alternative with a majority of winning attribute
values is selected. In the case of an equal number DEMO winning values for the
two alternatives, we implemented a version of DEMO rule where the alternative
winning the comparison on the last attribute is retained. The retained
(winning) alternative is then compared to the next DEMO among the set
of alternatives. The process of pairwise comparison repeats until all
alternatives have been evaluated and the final winning alternative identified.
The DEMO (SAT) rule (Simon, 1955) does not necessary examine all DEMO
alternatives in a set. Instead, alternatives are considered one at a DEMO
For each attribute of an alternative, it is determined whether the DEMO
value exceeds a cutoff value. If any attribute value is below the cutoff
value, that alternative is rejected. The first alternative in a set which has
values which pass the cutoffs for all attributes is chosen. DEMO is, a choice
can be made before all alternatives have been DEMO In the case where no
alternative passes all the cutoffs, a DEMO selection is made among the
alternatives.
Adaptive Decisions
14
We also implemented two versions of the lexicographic choice DEMO For
the strict Lexicographic (LEX) rule, the most important attribute DEMO
determined, and the values of all the alternatives on that attribute DEMO then
examined. The alternative with the highest value on that attribute is
selected. If there are ties, the second most important attribute is examined,
and so on until the tie is broken. However, because the attributes in the
simulation are generated as continuous random variates, ties almost never
occur. Thus, this rule is essentially the same as the most likely heuristic
for risky choice investigated in Thorngate (1980) and Johnson DEMO Payne
-S..
(1985). We also examined a Lexicographic Semi-Order (LEXSEMI) rule (Tversky,
1969). This rule is similar to the DEMO lexicographic rule, but introduces
the notion of a just-noticeable difference (JND). If several alternatives are
within a JND difference of the best DEMO on the most important
attribute, they are considered to be tied. DEMO alternatives are compared on
the next most important attribute, and the DEMO continues until one option
*
remains. The potential advantage of the Lexicographic semi-order rule is that
it ensures that an option which is marginally DEMO on the most important
attribute but much worse on other attributes will not necessarily be selected.
Finally, two combined strategies were implemented. The first was an
*Elimination-by-Aspects
plus Weighted Additive (EBA+ADD) rule. This rule used
DEMO EBA process until the number of available alternatives remaining was three
or less, and than used a weighted additive rule to evaluate the remaining
*alternatives
and select the best. The other combined strategy used

Elimination-by-Aspects DEMO Majority of Confirming Dimensions (EBA+MCD). This

These combinations were used because they DEMO been observed in several
previous choice process studies (e.g., Payne, DEMO; Bettman and Park, 1980).
In addition to the amount of information utilized, these heuristics
differ in how information about the alternatives and attributes of a decision
problem is likely to be processed. Some of DEMO rules imply an alternative-
based form of processing. That is, information DEMO processed regarding the
multiple attribute values of a single alternative before information about a
second alternative is processed. Examples of such rules are the DEMO
additive rule, the equalweight rule, and satisficing. Other decision rules
imply an attribute-based form of processing. That is, information is
processed regarding the values of several alternatives on a single attribute
before information about a DEMO attribute is processed. Examples of
attribute-based processing strategies are the EBA rule and the lexicographic
choice rules. The distinction between alternative-based (also called
"DEMO processing") and attribute-based decision strategies has played a
role in numerous discussions of decision models (e.g., Bettman, 1979;
Goldstein, 1986; Svenson, 1979), and has implications for the robustness of
the various strategies under time constraints. In particular, it can be
argued that under increasingly severe time pressure, it becomes more and more
important to examine all alternatives, even if on a limited set of attributes.
Thus, DEMO strategies may have an advantage (i.e., degrade more
slowly) under DEMO pressure.
Task and Context Variables
For purposes of comparison with Johnson and Payne (1985), we included
essentially the same set of task and context variables. We manipulated task
complexity through variations in the number of DEMO and number of
15
Adaptive Decisions
16
attributes. The numbers of alternatives were 2, 5, DEMO 8; the numbers of
attributes were also 2, 5, and DEMO
One context variable was the presence or absence of dominated
alternatives. Removing dominated alternatives produces efficient or Pareto-
optimal choice sets. The other context DEMO was the variance in the
relative weights assigned to the attributes. As noted earlier, Johnson and
Payne (1985) found that the variance of the probabilities impacted on which
heuristics were most efficient in risky choice. DEMO before, we examined both
low variance and high variance sets of DEMO The generation of the weights
paralleled the two procedures used in Johnson and Payne (1985) for generating
the probabilities of outcomes, with the difference that only one set of
weights were generated for a given DEMO problem.
Time Constraints
One new task variable was added, time pressure. DEMO levels of time
constraint were investigated. One level involved no time pressure. A given
rule could use as many operations as needed. The three DEMO levels of time
constraint were a maximum of (1)
50 DEMO's (severe time pressure), (2)
100
EIP's (DEMO pressure), and (3) 150 EIP's (low pressure). DEMO time (EIP)
constraint values were selected on the basis of DEMO analysis of the maximum
number of EIP's associated with the most effortful rule (weighted additive). 2
Note that the total number of EIP's was used to operationalize time pressure.
This implicitly assumes that DEMO EIP takes a similar amount of time. While
this is clearly an oversimplification, equal weighting of EIP's was felt to be
a useful initial approximation.
A key issue in dealing with the time or effort DEMO is how rules
should select among alternatives if they run out of time. For those rules
where one alternative which is best so far DEMO available (i.e., the WADD, EQW,
"
.1

Adaptive Decisions
and MCD rules), that alternative was selected. The EBA, lexicographic, and
17
satisficing rules DEMO picked an option randomly from those alternatives that
had not yet been eliminated. For the two combined strategies, the selection
was either made at random from the alternatives not yet eliminated, if the
combined strategy was still in the EBA phase, or the best so far if in the
WADD or MCD phase.
JNDs and Cutoff Values
Three of the DEMO, elimination-by-aspects, satisficing, and the
lexicographic-semiorder rule, involve parameters that affect the potential
effort and accuracy of the rules. For EBA and satisficing , this is the
cutoff value used to eliminate alternatives. For the lexicographic-semiorder
rule, it is the value of the JND. While these parameters are, in some sense,
under the control of the decision maker for each decision, we wanted to
establish a priori values which would be the same for all decisions made by
the simulation. Other alternatives, such as finding an optimal level of the
cutoff or JND for each DEMO or decision environment, would themselves
require effort on the part of DEMO decision-maker, and would have to be
captured in the simulation. Instead, we ran a pilot simulation without any
time constraints. All attributes in DEMO simulation were drawn from a uniform
distribution bounded by 0 and 1000. We manipulated both cutoffs (100, 300 and
500) and JNDs (DEMO, 50, and 100) and selected values which represented the most
DEMO accuracy-effort tradeoffs across the entire set of decisions. We
found that values of the cutoff of 500 and 300 were most efficient for
elimination-by-aspects DEMO satisficing, respectively, and that a JND of 50
gave the best performance for the lexicographic-semiorder rule. We therefore
set the JND value at DEMO, and included cutoffs set at 300 and 500 as a factor
DEMO the experimental design. Since this cutoff effect is small, compared to

other factors, we shall not discuss it further. When the results for the EBA
and satisficing rules are DEMO, they are for the most efficient cutoff
values for each rule.

decision problems in each of the 288 conditions defined by a 3 (number of
alternatives) by 3 (number of attributes) by 2 (DEMO or high variance of
weights) by 2 (presence or absence or dominated alternatives) by 2 (cutoff
values) by 4 (time constraints) factorial. After each trial, the alternative
selected was recorded, along with DEMO tally for each elementary operation used
by the decision rule. Johnson and Payne (1985), for comparison, investigated
only 36 possible task and DEMO combinations. For further details of the
simulation methodology, see Johnson and DEMO (1985).
Results
The measure of accuracy used compares the relative DEMO of
strategies to the two baseline strategies: (1) the weighted DEMO (WADD)
value, and (2) random choice. The measure is defined by the following
equation:

That is, we determined the maximum weighted additive (WADD) value possible in
a particular choice set, and the WADD value associated with a random
selection. The WADD value of the alternative selected by a decision heuristic
is DEMO compared to these two baseline values. This measure of performance is
bounded by a value of 1.00 for the WADD rule itself, and 0.0 for random

selection. It thus provides a measure of the relative DEMO over random
selection (Johnson and Payne, 1985).
Effort was measured by first summing the total number of elementary
operations used by a DEMO rule to make a selection from a particular set
of alternatives. This measure assumes that each elementary operation requires
essentially the same level of DEMO or mental effort. This assumption was used
by Johnson and Payne (DEMO) in their principal analyses.

These scores are for the no time pressure conditions. The results are
averaged over number of alternatives and DEMO and cutoffs, except that
the results for the EBA and satisficing DEMO are for each rule with its "best"
cutoff value.

DEMO Time Pressure Results
The simulation results for choice among multiattribute alternatives
without time pressure, shown in Table 2, are similar to those found DEMO Johnson
and Payne (1985). In some environments, heuristics for multiattribute choice

savings in effort. A decision maker using an equal weighted DEMO of the
additive model (EQW), for example, can achieve 89% of the relative performance
of the normative model, with only about half the effort, in the low-variance,
dominance-possible task environment. Even more impressive is the performance

of the strict lexicographic rule in the high-variance task DEMO The
lexicographic rule achieves 90. relative accuracy, with only about 40 DEMO
of the effort, on average. Note that the lexicographic-semiorder rule is
DEMO better than the simpler lexicographic rule in only one of the four
decision environments. The extra effort needed to take into account just-
noticeable DEMO may only be of value for a limited set of decision
situations.
As was found in Johnson and Payne (1985), it is clear from Table 2 that
the most efficient heuristic varies across decision environments. DEMO is also
clear that some heuristics (e.g., MCD and Satisficing) DEMO reasonably in
the dominance-possible environments, but are very poor choice rules DEMO tasks
where all dominated alternatives have been screened out.

4-"
One interesting result from Table 2 is the DEMO efficient
performance of the elimination-by-aspects rule. In the earlier work by
Thorngate (1980) and Johnson and Payne (1985), the version of EBA investigated
did not show much accuracy (30% on average). In the present simulation, the
EBA rule provided an average relative accuracy value of 65 over all task
environments, with an effort score of 85 versus 160 for the WADD rule.
Obviously, allowing the EBA rule to search as a function of the relative
importance of attributes (one main difference between the current
implementation and the previous studies) makes a major difference in the
accuracy of an EBA rule.
Another interesting set of results DEMO the performance of the two
combined decision strategies. The combination of an elimination process with
a weighted adding model (EBA+ADD) performed well across DEMO task conditions.
L
Adaptive Decisions
That rule appears to offer a good combination of accuracy DEMO reasonable
levels of effort. The EBA+MCD rule, on the other hand, does not appear to be
an efficient combination strategy. On the basis DEMO the overall simulation
results, it appears that the EMA rule alone DEMO superior to the EBA+MCD rule.
Time Pressure Results
From the time pressure results, shown in Table 3, it is clear that time
constraints DEMO different effects on the various rules. The weighted
additive rule, for DEMO, shows a marked reduction in accuracy from the
baseline value of DEMO for the no time pressure condition to an average
accuracy of only .2 under the most severe time constraint in the no dominance-
low DEMO condition. In contrast, the elimination-by-aspects heuristic
shows relatively little effect of DEMO pressure. The average accuracy is
reduced from .69 (no time pressure) to .56 (severe time pressure).
Interestingly, the EBA rule is DEMO the most accurate decision strategy
21
for three of the four choice environments for severe time pressure. Another
rule that appears to hold up DEMO under time pressure is the lexicographic
rule. In general, it appears DEMO strategies involving an initial processing
of all alternatives across a limited set of attributes do well under time
pressure. On the basis of the DEMO, what seems to be important in time
pressured decision environments is DEMO use a choice strategy that involves the
processing of at least some information about all alternatives as soon as
possible. However, note that at least in one decision environment (dominance-
possible, variance in weights-low), DEMO alternative simplification strategy
provided by the equalweight rule does well under even the most severe time
constraint studied.

Note also the effects of time pressure on the DEMO performance of
the EBA and the EBA plus weighted additive rules. Under most conditions, the
combined strategy is more accurate. However, under severe DEMO pressure, the
strict EBA rule does better. We speculate again that DEMO severe time
pressure, the processing of at least some information about DEMO alternatives
is important. With the combined rule, some alternatives may not DEMO processed
when the initial number of alternatives is small. With a small number of
alternatives, the rule becomes essentially a weighted additive rule.
-~
Overall, the results show that some decision strategies are much more
sensitive to time constraints than others. What appears important under
severe time pressure DEMO to do at least a quick, if dirty, evaluation of all
the alternatives. This type of strategy seems superior to one that evaluates
DEMO alternatives more completely, but may not evaluate some other
alternatives at DEMO within the time constraint. A related finding is that
those strategies which involve attribute-based processing (e.g., LEX & EBA)
appear to hold DEMO better under time pressure than alternative-based processing
strategies, e.g., WADD and EQW.
Study 2: Time Pressure and Context Effects
on Decision Processes
Taken together, the simulation results from Study 1 and the earlier work
of Johnson and Payne (1985) indicate what a decision maker might do DEMO adapt
to a decision environment. Specifically, this work suggests the possibility
DEMO a decision maker might be able to maintain a high level of accuracy and
minimize effort by using a diverse set of heuristics, changing rules as
contexts and time pressure change.
In this and the following DEMO, we examine the degree of correspondence
between the actual adaptivity shown DEMO human decision makers and the adaptive

strategies indicated by the DEMO results. Specifically, we ask: (1) To
what extent do people change strategies as a function of task effects such as
time pressure DEMO context effects such as the variance in probabilities?; and
(2) Are these changes in strategy adaptive in the directions suggested by the
DEMO? Two empirical studies which monitor subjects' decison processes
as we manipulate both time pressure and the variance in probabilities were
carried out to DEMO these questions.
The simulation results provide a fairly clear picture of an adaptive
decision maker. Consider the context manipulation of the variance in
probabilities, and assume that dominated alternatives are possible. Then, if
decision makers are adaptive in the way the simulations suggest, we would
expect to see a relationship between the variance in probabilities and the
amount of alternative-based DEMO attribute-based processing. The simulation
indicates that an alternative-based processing strategy, the DEMO rule,
is a very accurate heuristic for low-variance decision environments. On the
other hand, a more attribute-based processing strategy, the lexicographic
rule, is more accurate in high variance in probabilities decision
environments. Note that DEMO shift in the form of processing as a function of
context would indicate that people are sensitive to changes in choice
environments due to DEMO concern for accuracy and not due to task complexity or
information processing demands. The reason is that the accuracy of these
rules varies across DEMO (variance conditions), but the effort required by
the rules does DEMO Studies showing contingent processing due to task
complexity (e.g., changes in numbers of alternatives and attributes) are
common; studies showing processing changes DEMO to changes in context
variables, and hence implicitly a concern for DEMO, are rare (cf. Payne,
1982).

The task variable examined is the presence or absence of time pressure.
We also DEMO strategy changes at severe levels of time pressure. As the
simulation results indicate, the most accurate decision rule, the weighted
additive rule, becomes less accurate than several choice heuristics when there
is severe time pressure. DEMO, the presence of an explicit time
constraint should emphasize the adaptive DEMO of choice heuristics. In
particular, the simulation results indicate that attribute-based DEMO of
processing, and specifically the EBA strategy, maintain relatively high levels
of accuracy under time pressure, particularly in the high variance context.
suggests that the frequency with which attribute-based processing occurs
should increase with time DEMO
Time pressure is interesting for other reasons as well. Many real-world
decisions are made under conditions of moderate to severe time constraints.
Given the DEMO importance of time pressure to decision making, it is
surprising how DEMO empirical studies have directly examined the influence of
time constraints on judgments and choices (see Svenson, Eckland, & Karlson, in
press). DEMO best known work in this area is by Peter Wright (Wright, 1974;
Wright & Weitz, 1977). Wright (1974) contains many of the theoretical
concepts that have driven most subsequent time pressure research; he equated
variations in time pressure with other ways one might vary DEMO complexity and
then argued that increased time pressure would lead to efforts by the decision
maker to simplify the task.
Ben Zur and Breznitz (1981) identified at least three ways in which this
simplification could occur. One way to cope with time pressure is to process
only a DEMO of the most important information. This idea has been referred
to as "filtration" (Miller, 1960). Another way to cope with time DEMO is
the "acceleration" of processing (Ben Zur & Breznitz, 1981; Miller, 1960).

That is, one tries to DEMO the same information, but at a faster rate.
Finally, one could shift processing strategies. At the extreme, this could
involve random choice, DEMO what has been called "avoidance" (Ben Zur &
Breznitz, DEMO; Miller, 1960). A less extreme form of contingent processing
would involve a shift from a more effortful rule, like the additive rule, to a
less effortful rule, like EBA. The simulation results presented DEMO
indicate that such a shift in strategy could maintain relatively high levels
of accuracy even under severe time pressure.
The hypothesis of filtration is DEMO in the literature. For
example, Wright (1974), Wright and Weitz (1977), and Svenson et. al. (in
press) all report that the most important information in a judgment task was
given more weight DEMO time pressure. Ben Zur and Breznitz (1981), in the
only DEMO tracing study of time pressure effects on choice, also report
some DEMO to the use of more important information under time pressure.
Furthermore, DEMO Zur and Breznitz found that subjects spent less time looking
at individual items of information under time pressure. They concluded that
the combination of DEMO and limited acceleration "can be viewed as the
optimal decision making DEMO when the DM is confronted with information
overload while pressured by deadlines (p. 102)".
The question of optimality of choice under time DEMO was directly
addressed by Zakay and Wooler (1984) and Zakay (DEMO). They found that under
time pressure a smaller proportion of the observed choices consisted of the
alternative that had been measured as having DEMO greatest additive value.
In much of the work on time pressure effects, a hypothesis is that time
pressure will cause people to shift toward "simpler" decision strategies.
almost all of the prior studies of time DEMO have used input-
output analyses. As Wright (1974) correctly points out, the use of

correlational techniques based on inputs and outputs by DEMO is
generally not adequate to demonstrate a shift in processing strategy. To our
knowledge, there is no process evidence for strategy shifts under time
pressure. Consequently, the present study uses the process tracing technique
of monitoring information acquisition to test the adaptiveness of actual
decision processes to different DEMO constraints. The study also examines the
adaptiveness of decision processing to the context variable associated with
the distribution of probabilities (weights) defining the DEMO in a choice
set. While the major purpose of the study is to study adaptivity of decision
making, the specific results for time pressure are also of great interest in
and of themselves.
Method
Subjects. Sixteen DEMO at Duke University served as subjects
in this experiment. Participation in the experiment earned credit toward
fulfillment of a course requirement. In addition, the subjects had a
possibility of winning as much as $9.99, depending on their actual choices.
Stimuli. The stimuli were sets of risky options. Each DEMO contained
four options. Each option in a set offered four possible outcomes. The
outcomes involved possible payoffs ranging from $.Ol to $9.99. Every option
DEMO a set was defined in terms of the same four outcome probabilities. That
is, each choice alternative was defined in terms of the same four possible
states of the world. The probabilities for any given state DEMO the world
ranged from .01 to .96, with the constraint that DEMO sum of the four outcome
probabilities equaled 1.0.
The values of the options were generated using the techniques contained
in the simulation program described DEMO Johnson and Payne (1985) and used in
Study 1. Ten sets of high variance in probabilities (weights) options and 10

sets of low variance options were generated. Dominated options DEMO allowed
in all sets. In terms of the design used for Study 1, we sampled sets of
27
options from the low-variance, dominance-possible, and high-variance,
dominance-possible conditions. The probability (weight) and payoff values DEMO

options used in this study are provided DEMO Table 4. Overall, the sets of
options in the Low and DEMO variance conditions were similar in terms of their
average expected vlaues.
As noted above, these decision environments are ones where heuristics
can be highly efficient, but which heuristic is best differs across decision
environments. The equiprobable or equal weighted additive rule, characterized
by an alternative-based form of processing, does well in the low variance
condition. In contrast, the lexicographic DEMO, characterized by an
attribute-based form of processing, does better than the equalweight rule in
the high variance condition. We expect in general that DEMO information
processing by an individual would involve a shift from more alternative-based
processing to more attribute-based processing as the variance in probabilities
or weights DEMO characterize the options in a choice set increases.

wished to acquire information about probabilities and payoffs and make a
decision. The other condition involved a 15 second time constraint.4  In this
condition, a clock was shown in the upper left-hand corner of the display

was instructed to make a choice.

There DEMO 40 decision problems (2 context conditions x 2 time pressure
conditions DEMO 10 replications), presented to each subject in a random order.
The use of a complete within-subjects design was motivated by the desire to
DEMO the strongest possible test of adaptive decision making (i.e., that
the same subject would be expected to switch strategies from one trial to DEMO
next). A complete experimental session took from 30-45 minutes for each

subject.'
The Mouselab methodology. Information acquisitons, response times, and
DEMO were monitored using a new software system called Mouselab (Johnson,
DEMO, Schkade, & Bettman, 1986). This system uses an IBM DEMO computer,
or equivalent, equipped with a "mouse". A mouse is a hand-controlled pointing
device that can be used to move a DEMO around the display screen of the
computer. The stimuli are presented on the display in the form of a matrix of
available information. The DEMO row of boxes contained information about the
probabilities of the four outcomes. The next four rows of boxes contained
information-about the payoffs associated with DEMO different outcomes for each
alternative, respectively. At the bottom of the DEMO were four boxes that
were used to indicate which alternative was most preferred. Figure 1 is an
example of a stimulus display with one DEMO opened, and with the time pressure
clock part way through the DEMO

When a set of options first appears on the screen, the values of the
payoffs and probabilities are "DEMO" behind the labeled boxes. To open a
Adaptive Decisions
particular box and examine the information, all a subject has to do is move
the cursor into the box. The box immediately DEMO and remains open until the
cursor is moved out of the box. Only one box can be open at a time.
The Mouselab program DEMO the order in which boxes are opened, and
the amount of DEMO boxes are open. When the subject is ready to make a
choice, he or she just moves the cursor into the choice box representing the
preferred alternative and pushes one of the buttons on the mouse.
DEMO the
program verifies that the subject has indeed selected his or her preferred
alternative, the response is recorded, along with the total elapsed DEMO since
the display first appeared on the screen. Response times are recorded to an
accuracy of 1/60th of a second.
The Mouselab methodology DEMO close to the recording of eye movements
in terms of speed and ease of acquisitions, while minimizing instrumentation
cost and difficulty of use for both subject and experimenter. An analysis of
the time necessary to move DEMO mouse between boxes in our displays using Fitts
Law indicates that one could move between boxes in less than 100 milliseconds.
This suggests that DEMO time to acquire information using the Mouselab system
is limited mainly by the time it takes to think where to point, rather than by
the time it takes to move the mouse. More details on the DEMO system can
be found in Johnson, Payne, Schkade, and Bettman (1986). By using the data
collected with the Mouselab system, numerous summary measures describing the
subject's decision process can be developed. Several DEMO measures are
outlined in the results section.

The subjects then were instructed on the use of the DEMO information

they would be presented with a series of decisions involving DEMO among
risky options. They were told that some decisions would involve an explicit
time constraint, while for other decision problems they could take as long to
respond as they wished.
To increase motivation, the subjects were told that at the end of the
experiment a decision problem would DEMO selected at random, and the option they

Results
Overview. Our main focus in the results is how people adapt to the task
manipulation, time pressure, and the context manipulation, variance in
probabilities. We consider effects on how subjects processed information,
relative DEMO levels, and the relationship between processing strategy and
accuracy. Before considering DEMO results, we first introduce measures used
to characterize the form of DEMO processing. Then these measures are
examined in terms of both time press'ire and context effects. Next, the impact
of time pressure and context on the relative accuracy of decisions will be
discussed. Finally, the relationship between processing measures and accuracy
will be examined to see how it DEMO over both the time pressure and context
conditions.
A key hypothesis of this study is that people will adapt their behavior
to the demands DEMO the decision environment in a fashion consistent with the
results of the simulations. As noted, to provide the strongest possible test
of adaptiveness, DEMO utilized a within-subjects experimental design. Subjects,

however, may have to experience several examples of different types of
decision problems before settling on a preferred decision strategy for DEMO
particular type of problem. Consequently, we present the results calculated
both DEMO the block of 20 decision problems seen first by the decision maker,
and the block of the last 20 decisions (Recall that the sets of options
representing the four combinations of time pressure and context DEMO presented
in a random order to the subjects, so that problems DEMO to each of
the four time pressure-variance combinations were distributed essentially
equally over the two blocks).
Process measures. Information acquisition behavior can be DEMO
in a wide variety of ways. One can examine the amount of information
acquired, the sequence of information acquired, and the time spent DEMO
information (See Klayman (1983) for a discussion of various information
DEMO measures). For the purposes of this paper, we adopt eight
DEMO of decision processes. The first measure is the total number of
times information boxes were opened for a particular decision. This is one
measure DEMO the total amount of search, denoted acquisitions (ACQ). A second
measure of total amount of search is the total time spent looking DEMO
information in all the opened boxes (BOX TIME). A third DEMO, which is
directly relevant to the acceleration of processing, is the time spent per
item of information acquired (TPERACQ).
The fourth and fifth measures reflect the relative attention devoted to
specific types of information DEMO the decision environment. One measure,
denoted (PTMI), reflects the DEMO of the total box time that was spent
in boxes involving the most important attribute of a particular decision
problem. We defined the attribute (outcome) with the largest weight
(probability of occurrence) as the most important attribute. The other
Adaptive Decisions
*
measure, denoted (PTPROB), is the proportion of DEMO spent on probability
32
information as opposed to information about payoff values.
The sixth measure is based on the sequence of information acquisitions.
Given DEMO acquisition of a particular piece of information, the next piece of
DEMO acquired might involve the same alternative but different
attribute (an alternative, holistic, or a Type 1 transition), or the same
attribute but a different alternative (an attribute, dimensional, or Type 2
transition).5 A simple measure of the relative amount of alternative-based
(Type 1) DEMO attribute-based (Type 2) transitions isprovided by calculating
the number of Type 1 transitions minus the number of Type 2 transitions
divided by the DEMO of Type 1 and Type 2 transitions (Payne, 1976). This
measure of the relative use of alternative-based versus attribute-based
processing ranges from DEMO value of -1.0 to +1.0. A more positive number
indicates relatively more alternative-based processing, while a more negative
number indicates relatively more attribute-based processing. This measure of
sequence of search is denoted (PATTERN).
Finally, DEMO last two measures reflect the variances in the proportions
of time spent on each alternative (VAR-ALTER) and each attribute (VAR-ATTRIB),
respectively. DEMO that more compensatory decision rules, e.g., WADD, EQW,
and DEMO, imply a pattern of information acquisition that is constant (low in
variance) across alternatives and attributes. In contrast, heuristic
strategies, like EBA, lexicographic, and satisficing, imply more variance in
processing across alternatives and attributes.
Table 5 presents the means for each of the eight process DEMO as a
function of time pressure (No Time Pressure vs. 15 DEMO), decision context

Table 5 will be discussed first in terms of DEMO pressure effects, then
context effects, and finally the relationships among time pressure, context,

Time pressure and processing. As would DEMO expected, the subjects
acquired fewer items of information (ACQ) in DEMO time constrained choice
environments (M - 35.0 vs. M = 16.7, F -378.44, p < .01).6 Subjects also
spent less overall time looking at information (BOXTIME) in the time pressured
problems (M - 25.7 vs. M 8.1 sec., F - 324.22, p < .01)DEMO Both ACQ (M - 28.9
vs. MH 23.8, F - 24.39, p < .01) and BOXTIME (m - 18.7 VS. m - 15.1, f
22.05, P < .01) were also smaller for the last block of 20 decision problems
compared to the first block of DEMO decision problems. This finding was
qualified by block by time pressure interactions for both ACQ (F -20.15, p <
.01) and BOXTIME (F
=
19.31, p < .01), which simply show that the amount of
information acquisition did not vary much over blocks in the DEMO time
pressure condition, but that less information was acquired in the DEMO block
with no time pressure.
One major hypothesis regarding time pressure and decision making is that
people will adapt to time constraints by accelerating DEMO processing of
items of information. The results for the time per acquisition variable
(TPERACQ) indicate that people did process information significantly faster
under DEMO pressure (M - .67 vs. M -. 49 sec., F -217.36, p < .01). In
addition, time per acquisition was smaller DEMO -. 60 vs. M - .57 sec., F
7.51,-p < DEMO) for the second block of trialIs than the first, although this
was qualified by a block by time pressure interaction (F -3.87, DEMO < .05)
Adaptive Decisions
shoving that the decrease over blocks only occurred in the DEMO time pressure
condition. Thus, our results are consistent with those of DEMO Zur and
Breznitz (1981) concerning the acceleration of processing.
Another hypothesis regarding time pressure, examined by many
researchers, concerns the filtration of DEMO That is, do people focus
more on the most important information DEMO time pressure? The proportion of
time spent examining items of information DEMO the most likely outcome
(PTMI) in this study was significantly greater under time pressure
vs. M = .40, F = 9.83, p < .01). There were no effects of block or
(M -

34
interactions involving block. Note also that the proportion of time spent on
probabilities (PTPROB) was greater for the time pressured problems CM DEMO .25
vs. M - .29, F = 18.14, p < .01). The proportion of time spent on
probabilities also increased slightly from DEMO first block to the second CM=
.26 vs. M .28), and there were no interactions involving block. These
results clearly support the filtration DEMO
Beyond evidence for acceleration and filtration of processing, our
results also DEMO a shift in information processing strategies as a
'V.
function of DEMO pressure. Such a shift is crucial evidence for adaptivity.
The PATTERN variable, which depicts the extent to which ccquisitions are
alternative-based or attribute-based, DEMO an effect of time pressure, with
processing becoming more attribute-based under DEMO ti
me pressure CM = -.22
vs. M - - .28, DEMO - 3.55, p < .059) (Recall that more negative values DEMO this
variable correspond to more attribute-based processing). There were no main
effects or interactions involving block on this variable. The variance in the
DEMO of time spent processing the various alternatives (VAR-ALTER)
showed no DEMO due to time pressure, although there was a tendency for this
DEMO to increase from the first block to the second (M .29 DEMO M =.32,

F 4.57, p < .05). Finally, the DEMO in the proportion of time spent
processing the attributes (VAR-ATTRIB) showed an effect due to time pressure,
with greater variance under nigh DEMO pressure
(H -

p < .05). This proportion also rose from the first block DEMO the second
(H -

.32 vs. H - .38, F - 12.83, p < .01) and shoved a three way DEMO
between time pressure, block, and variance that is not easily interpretable (F
5.57, p < .05). However, the time pressure results are the most crucial
here, and it is important to note that the shift in information processing
behavior is in a direction that is DEMO with greater use of attribute-
based heuristic rules under time pressure. There is more attribute-based
processing and more variance in processing in the time DEMO decision
problems.
To summarize, we found evidence that people adapted to DEMO pressure by
accelerating processing, focusing processing, and by changing the pattern
(strategy) of processing toward more attribute-based heuristics.
Context effects on processing. DEMO context variable (Low variance in
probabilities versus High variance in probabilities) also had a significant
effect on a variety of process measures. BOXTIME (H
=
19.2 vs. M = 14.6, F
31.02, p < DEMO), ACQ (M = 28.9 vs. HM 23.8, F = 36.39, p < .01), and time per
acquisition (M -. 60 DEMO M - .57, F -7.21, p < .01) were all DEMO
less for problems involving a higher degree of variance in probabilities.
These effects were all qualified by significant variance by time pressure
interactions, showing that the decrease due to higher variance in
probabilities was manifested only DEMO the low time pressure condition (F

although there was no significant difference in the proportion of DEMO spent
36
on probabilities (F - 1.34, n.s.). There were also no interactions involving
variance for the latter two variables.
*
The DEMO impact of the context manipulation was on the processing
variables: PATTERN, VAR-ATTRIB, and to a lesser extent VAR-ALTER. The
predominant pattern of processing became significantly more attribute-based
for the high variance gamble sets (M - -.12 vs. H - .37, F - 54.60, p < .01)DEMO
The variance in the proportion of time spent on attributes was also much
greater for the high variance option sets (M
=
.22 vs. M .49, F = 119.13, p <
.01). Finally, DEMO was more variance in processing across alternatives when
the decision problems involved probabilities that differed greatly (M -. 28
vs. M =.33, F DEMO 6.83, p < .01). There were no two-way interactions involving

the context manipulation for these three dependent variables.
As noted earlier, DEMO simulations suggest that changes in a context
variable, such as the DEMO of the probabilities associated with the
options in a choice set, DEMO not alter the effort levels of decision
strategies. On the other hand, the accuracy of strategies is strongly
affected by context in these simulations. Prior work investigating contingent
decision processing has demonstrated that decision makers are DEMO by
task variables that impact effort (e.g., number of alternatives). The present
results clearly demonstrate that people will also shift processing strategies
DEMO variations in context variables that impact on the potential relative
accuracy of heuristics, but not on their relative effort. Such context
effects have rarely been shown.
In sum, the results for both the time pressure (DEMO) manipulation and

relative effort and the relative accuracy of choice heuristics.
Accuracy of choice. As noted in our discussion of the Monte-Carlo
simulation experiment, there are a number of ways in which accuracy or quality
37
of choice DEMO be measured. For consistency with the prior simulation work on
accuracy of heuristics Cmhorngate, 1980; Johnson & Payne, 1985), we used a
measure of accuracy based on the maximization of expected value (EV). The
main advantage of EV as an accuracy measure is that values DEMO individual

*
.
decision makers are not required to operationalize the rule. Of course, a
maximization of EV criterion is at best only a first approximation to the
optimal choice, since it does not reflect individual differences.
The primary measure of accuracy we used is essentially DEMO same as the
relative performance peasure of accuracy used in Study 1. That is, as above
we defined a measure that is a measure of the proportion of the maximum
possible improvement in EV obtained over DEMO which would be expected based on
a random choice rule. The closer the value of relative accuracy is to 1.0,
the nearer the DEMO are to a strict maximization of expected value rule.
The average relative accuracy scores for the 16 subjects as a function
of time pressure, variance in probabilities, and decision block are presented
in Table 6. While the relative accuracy scores are higher under no time
pressure (M - .62 vs. M = .48, F
=
8.32, p < .01) and in the second block CM
.48 vs.
M, -
.62, DEMO - 7.23, p < .01), it is clear from Table DEMO that the
decrement in performance is concentrated in the responses to the earlier
(first block) problems involving time pressure. By the latter block, people
had adapted to time pressure and had improved their performance to DEMO
similar to those obtained in the no time pressure condition. This is verified
by the significant block by time pressure interaction
(F -
10.73, p (.01).

Relationship of Process to Accuracy. A major conclusion reached from
the Monte-Carlo simulations of DEMO and accuracy in choice was that a
decision maker who used heuristics would have to adaptively choose among
decision strategies, depending upon the specific choice environment. The
prior results for process measures and accuracy measures indicate DEMO
subjects in this experiment were influenced by both the task and context
variables. A major question is whether the adaptiveness in terms of process
DEMO related to improvements in accuracy. Table 7 presents results that address
that question.7 The process variable used in Table 7 was the relative amount
DEMO alternative-based versus attribute-based processing (i.e., PATTERN).
Recall that higher values of that variable correspond to more alternative-
based processing. The accuracy measure DEMO the relative accuracy score. It
is clear from Table 7 that the relationship between pattern of processing and
performance was stronger for the second DEMO decision problems. It is also
clear that under no time pressure, DEMO is a significant relationship between
relative accuracy and the use of relatively more alternative-based processing.
That result might be expected, given that the relative accuracy score uses EV
maximization, which is an alternative-based decision rule, DEMO a criterion for
accuracy.
The result of the greatest interest, however, is that the relationship
between processing a

involving both time pressure and high variance in the probabilities. Note
that it is exactly the combination of high time pressure and DEMO variance in
probabilities where the Monte-Carlo simulation indicated that attribute-based
forms of processing, e.g., the EBA strategy and lexicographic rule, were

better than either one of the alternative-based strategies, i.e., the weighted
additive or equalweight additive rules (See Table 3, Dominance Yes, Variance
High, Time Pressure Severe). In other words, a person striving to maintain
accuracy in a severely time pressured, high variance decision environment
should, according to the simulation DEMO, utilize more attribute-based
processing. Our results show that the use of DEMO more attribute-based
processing led to better relative accuracy for exactly those time pressured,
high variance decision problems (a negative correlation implies that lower
values for PATTERN, signifying more attribute-based processing, are associated
with higher DEMO accuracy).

Discussion
The central result from Study 2 is that people exhibit a surprising
degree of adaptivity DEMO their decision behavior. Decision processes were
sensitive to a context variable that influences the relative accuracy of
heuristics, without impacting on relative effort. Decision processes were
also sensitive to the important task variable of time pressure. DEMO
findings of adaptivity are particularly strong in that they were exhibited by
the same subjects on different trials. Moreover, there was a relationship
between processing strategy and the relative accuracy of choice as a function
changes DEMO the task environment. Finally, the general pattern of adaptive
behavior was DEMO a direction consistent with the simulation results.
The results dealing with time pressure and decision processes were also
of interest. Support was found for DEMO hypotheses that increased time
pressure would result in (1) acceleration of information processing, (2)
filtration of information to be processed, and (3) changes in the choice

heuristics used to make a decision.
As noted earlier, prior research has
40
supported the acceleration and filtration hypotheses. The present DEMO is
the first to demonstrate clear changes in choice processing strategies as a
function of time pressure.
The fact that there appear to be DEMO least three ways in which people can
adapt to time pressure leads to the following question: Is there an ordering
to the adaptive strategies people use to deal with time pressures? That is,
do people first try to deal with time constraints through acceleration and
perhaps filtration DEMO processing? Selecting an alternative decision process
in response to time pressure DEMO only occur if the first two responses are not
adequate. The purpose of the third study is to investigate that possibility
by examining a DEMO of less severe time pressure

Results
The measures of process and accuracy used in this DEMO were the same as
those in Study 2. A summary of both the process and accuracy results for
Study 3 can be found in DEMO 8.
The results for Study 3 parallel those for Study 2 with respect to items
of information acquired (ACQ) and BOXTIME. There is DEMO main effect of time
pressure for each, with fewer items of DEMO acquired
(M -
37.3 vs. M-
23.2, F - 118.6, DEMO< .01) and less time spent
124.8, p < .01) under greater time pressure.8
(M -
26.2 vs. M - 12.8, F
DEMO results also support acceleration, in that there is a main effect DEMO
time pressure on time per acquisition (TPERACQ). People process information
DEMO quickly under time pressure CM -. 65 vs. M - .56, DEMO - 71.48, p < .01).
There is some evidence for DEMO, although weaker than in Study 2.
There is a marginal main DEMO of time pressure on proportion of time spent
on the most likely outcome (PTMI), with this proportion greater under time
pressure CM = .31 vs. M = .33, F =3.36, p -. 067). DEMO is no effect of
time pressure on the proportion of time spent on probability information,
however.
Finally, there is very little evidence of time pressure effects on the
pattern of processing. There is no main DEMO on the PATTERN measure (F
.03, n.s.) or variance in DEMO proportion of time spent on the various
attributes (F - 1.89, n.s.). There is a marginal effect of time pressure on
the DEMO of time spent on the various alternatives (VAR-ALTER), with
greater DEMO under lower time pressure, opposite to the predicted effect
(M - .25 vs. M = .22, p = .069). Hence, unlike DEMO results for Study 2, there
41
is no evidence in Study DEMO that a shift in processing strategies occurred under
time pressure. This conclusion is reinforced when the correlations between

DEMO are examined across the various time pressure, block, and variance

sign of the correlations found in Study 2.

time pressure by block interaction, again showing that accuracy DEMO only low
in the first block under time pressure (F - DEMO, p < .05).
Although the results for adaptivity of strategy DEMO time pressure are not
significant, the context variable had similar effects DEMO those of Study 2.
There were main effects of context on acquisitions (ACQ) (F = 14.35, p < .01)
and boxtime (F = 13.47, p < .01) ,
with lower values in the high variance
conditions. There were also effects of context on the DEMO variables. The
predominant pattern of processing becomes more attribute-based (M = DEMO vs. M
= -. 13, F = 45.01, p < .01); there is a greater variance in the proportion of
time spent DEMO the various alternatives (VAR-ALTER) (M = .20 vs. M = DEMO, F =
10.49, p < .01); and there is greater variance in the proportion of time spent
on the various attributes (VAR-ATTRIB) (M = .20 vs. M = .34, F = 14.25, DEMO <
.01) for the greater variance condition. These results are important, for
they show that the subjects in the experiment did show adaptivity to the
variance manipulation by changing strategies. Hence, the failure to show such
an effect for time pressure is not due to a total DEMO to obtain
adaptivity.10
To summarize, the results for the no time DEMO problems versus
decision problems involving a time pressure of 25 seconds indicated strong
'pk
Adaptive Decisions
evidence of acceleration of processing, marginally significant evidence for
filtration of information to be processed, and no evidence of changes in
decision heuristics. A comparison of the results for Study 3 with those of
DEMO 2 suggests the hypothesis that people adapt to time pressure in a
ordered sequence of ways. First, they try to speed up their rate of
processing. Next they will selectively process information. Finally, they
will select a different decision or evaluation strategy.
The effects of the context variable DEMO those reported for Study
2, and support the conclusion that people DEMO adapt decision processes to
changes in the decision environment that impact the relative accuracy of
heuristics without affecting the relative effort.

General Discussion
DEMO
Past research has shown that the same individual will often employ
diverse strategies in making a decision, contingent on task demands (Payne,
DEMO). The use of multiple decision strategies extends to children, as DEMO
as adults (Klayman, 1985). Similarly, a growing amount of DEMO from the
study of human performance in several other cognitive tasks indicates that an
individual may use many different cognitive processes (strategies) to DEMO
and solve problems (Reder, 1982; Siegler, 1986).
As Siegler (1986) has argued, "children (and adults) have good reasons
DEMO use multiple strategies. Strategies differ in their accuracy, in how long
DEMO take to execute, in their demands on processing resources, and in the
range of problems to which they apply (p. 1)". DEMO major problem for current
cognitive research is to be able to better understand and predict when a.
particular strategy will be employed.
This paper DEMO examined the role of effort and accuracy considerations
in the selection of information processing strategies for making a choice.
Adaptive Decisions
The general hypothesis is that the selection among strategies is DEMO, in
the sense that a decision maker will choose strategies that DEMO relatively
efficient in terms of effort and accuracy as task and context demands are
varied. The first part of the paper outlined an approach DEMO modelling the
inpact of task and context variables on decision strategies. The approach is
based on the use of elementary information processes to measure DEMO and use
44
of computer simulation models to examine accuracy and effort tradeoffs. Study
1 used Monte-Carlo simulation techniques to examine the impact of DEMO
in several aspects of the choice environment, including the presence or
DEMO of time pressure, variance in weights, presence or absence of
dominated alternatives, and different problem sizes, on the accuracy and
effort of DEMO variety of choice heuristics. This simulation identified
strategies which approximate the accuracy of normative procedures while
requiring substantially less effort. However, no single heuristic did well
across all task and context conditions. A decision maker striving DEMO maintain
a high level of accuracy with a minimum of effort would have to adaptively
choose from a repertoire of heuristics. Of particular interest DEMO the
*
finding that under time constraints, several attribute-based heuristics (e.g.,
Elimination-by-aspects) were clearly superior in terms of accuracy to a
normative procedure such as expected value maximization.
Studies 2 and 3 directly tested DEMO degree of correspondence between the
efficient strategies for a given decision problem identified by the
simulations and the actual information processing strategies people use DEMO
make a choice. People were shown to be highly adaptive in their responses to
changes in the nature of the alternatives available to them, and to the
presence or absence of time pressure. The results for DEMO decision

45
behavior tended to validate the models of decision strategies DEMO the
simulation estimates of accuracy and effort in various choice environments.
More specifically, subjects were shown to use several approaches in
adapting to different decision environments. Subjects acquired less
information, spent less time overall and less time per acquisition, used more
attribute-based processing, and displayed greater variance DEMO the proportion
of time spent on the various alternatives and attributes in situations where
the context variable of variance in the weights (probabilities) DEMO high
rather than low. Such adaptivity in strategy usage in response to a context
variable demonstrates that people are sensitive to a change in DEMO task
environment that impacts on the relative accuracy of heuristics without
affecting relative effort.
In addition, several effects of time pressure were demonstrated. Under
moderate time pressure, subjects were shown to accelerate their processing
and, DEMO a lesser extent, to focus on a subset of the available DEMO
Under severe time pressure, people accelerated their processing, focused on a
subset of the information, and changed their decision strategies. There was
slightly more attribute-based processing and more variance in the proportion
of time spent DEMO various attributes as time pressure increased. In addition,
these changes appeared to be appropriate in terms of accuracy, as more
attribute-based processing was associated with higher gains in high time
pressure, high variance in weights environments. Also interesting is the fact
that the adaptive use of heuristics DEMO greater for the second block of
.4
*.
decision problems. This suggests that people may learn appropriate heuristics
to use with experience in solving DEMO types of decision problems.
There are several important aspects of the time pressure results.
First, they provide one of the clearest demonstrations in the literature to
Adaptive Decisions
46
date of adaptivity of processing strategies to time pressure. DEMO, the
results of Studies 2 and 3, taken together, imply DEMO there may be a
hierarchy of responses to time pressure. People may first attempt to simply
accelerate, or speed up their processing. That is, they may first try to do
the same things faster. If the time pressure is too great for acceleration to
suffice, individuals may next engage in filtration, focusing on a subset of
the available information. Finally, people may change strategies when time
pressures become extreme. The evidence also suggests that such strategy
changes are in the appropriate direction in terms DEMO preserving accuracy while
minimizing effort.
Taken as a whole, the results DEMO very strong evidence for
adaptivity in decision making. Individuals change strategies from one choice
problem to the next depending upon the structure of the DEMO environment for
each problem. The current studies are the only ones of which we are aware
which provide such extensive within-individual evidence of adaptivity. DEMO
variability in approach from one problem to the next implies that humans
possess abilities for assessing choice environment properties; characterizing
such abilities would be a fruitful area for study.
The results also provide impressive validation for DEMO conceptual and
simulation approaches outlined in Johnson and Payne (1985). DEMO not only
change strategies in response to changes in choice environments, DEMO they
appear to change in directions predicted by the simulation. This implies that
such simulations may be useful in understanding adaptive responses to other
DEMO of choice environments, such as the intercorrelation structure of the
attributes (Johnson, Meyer, & Goshe, 1986). However, certain environmental
properties DEMO be more easily noticed, and hence more adapted to, then others.

The evidence for adaptive use of heuristics obtained in DEMO study
suggests a picture of the human decision maker that is fairly optimistic in
terms of rational behavior. People clearly do use choice heuristics DEMO may
lead to violations of certain principles of rationality (Tversky, 1969). The
use of heuristics may reflect a tradeoff of effort and DEMO, or reflect
the fact that the decision maker has no other DEMO in some decision
environments than the use of a heuristic (Simon,DEMO
1981).
However,
our results
suggest that people can adaptively select from a repertoire of processing
strategies. That is, people use heuristics that are often appropriate given
task and context factors.
