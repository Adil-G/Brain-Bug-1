Mitigating Operational Risk in British
Retail DEMO
Keith Blacker'
This paper extends the risk mitigation phase of an established risk management model,
using well-established decision-making theories. Hence, a model is proposed of how
British retail banks may mitigate operational risks. The DEMO of a case study are
presented as a basis for laying out in more detail a framework for mitigation. The
paper presents an illustrative DEMO of an operational risk problem (pensions mis-
selling), and of DEMO it is being mitigated.
Key Words: Operational risk mitigation; decision-making; DEMO;
process; selection barriers; case study
Introduction
There is little academic research on operational risk management and even less on the mitigation
of DEMO risk exposures. The overall aim of the research reported here is to explore operational
risk mitigation in the context of British retail banks, and to propose a theoretical framework
based on the emerging core practice of DEMO banks under study.
Following a brief review of the definition of operational risk, the paper describes a risk
management model before moving into the detail of operational risk mitigation. By examining
operational risk mitigation in the DEMO of well-established decision-making theory, a
theoretical framework is developed from which DEMO main research question can be explored.
The preliminary results of the research (based on a single in-depth case study) are then
presented, together with some concluding remarks about operational risk mitigation.
A brief case study DEMO the British pensions mis-selling review is included in the paper. This
example, of an operational risk problem which has yet to be resolved, DEMO concerned principally
with insurance companies. It has, however, affected many British retail banks because of
'bancassurance', the process of selling insurance products through bank branches, which
has existed in Britain since Lloyds Bank launched its own unit-linked insurance products in
1966.2 The case illustrates the mitigation DEMO being employed to reduce the possibility of
this type of operational risk recurring.
Defining operational
risk
Operational risk is not a new phenomenon, although the term itself is a recent addition to the
financial services sector'DEMO risk management vocabulary. Currently, there is no commonly
agreed definition of DEMO risk.3 There is some consensus amongst practitioners that it
involves a breakdown or failure in the operational processes within a bank.4 However,

definitions in the practitioners' literature abound, and it may be that there are as many
definitions of operational DEMO as there are banks. However, a 'core' definition, acceptable to
all parties but with sufficient flexibility to allow other types of risks DEMO be included as
circumstances dictate, is slowly emerging. The increasingly conglomerate DEMO of British
retail banks, many of whom own insurance operations, has led supervisors (the Financial
Services Authority) to recognise that large losses DEMO occur as a result of risk
concentrations at the group level.5 Operational risks can cut across different business units
or, in aggregate, threaten DEMO business operations. Such risks need capturing as part
of the same risk management process, but with the focus at the conglomerate rather than
the business unit level.
Despite the variety of operational risk definitions that currently DEMO, it is evident that the
most important factor for banks (and other organisations) is the need to recognise that they
need to manage all their risks. This applies irrespective of the category of risk, whether
operational, market, credit, strategic or project. This point has recently been emphasised in
Britain by the publication of the Turnbull Report.6 The resulting DEMO Code on Corporate
Governance obligates the directors of listed companies to assess the risks to their organisation
on an on-going basis.
Whilst the research DEMO here is not directly concerned with the definition of operational
risk, DEMO clear understanding of what each bank includes within its definition is important in
understanding the approaches used to mitigate the operational risks involved. One DEMO the
assumptions in the research is that the banks in question have definitions of operational risk
with common characteristics.
An operational risk management model
DEMO considering how to manage operational risk, MacCrimmon and Wehrung7 provide a
DEMO based around the three components of risk: the magnitude of loss, the chance of
loss and the exposure to loss. Managing (operational) DEMO requires the reduction of one or
more of these elements. This might involve building complex models, based on previous
risk exposures within the organisation (assuming the data can be captured),8 to enable
objective decision-making. DEMO, it is more likely that any initial risk assessment will
be DEMO subjective.
Risk management is generally identified with the following four phases:9
1. Risk identification: perceiving hazards, identifying failures, recognising adverse
consequences.
2. Risk estimation: estimating risk probabilities, describing the risk, quantifying the risk.

This framework is equally applicable to all types of risk exposure (including operational risk
management) within a DEMO, and is summarised in Figure 1 opposite.

The decision on whether to assume an operational risk seems to be dependent on two types of
circumstance. The DEMO is when the operational risk is outside the bank, and as DEMO consequence
introducing an effective mitigation action would be too costly. An example of this, and one of the
main operational risks faced by British retail banks, is the heavy reliance placed on the central
payments processing system run by the Society for World-wide International Financial Transactions
(SWIFT). Whilst SWIFT have their own mitigation actions to cover inherent operational risks, a
bank would need its own payments routing mechanism to protect itself DEMO, at the extreme, against

SWIFT failing. Indeed, some banks are DEMO to consider this as an option in order to reduce
the risk rather than assuming it.
The second type of circumstance is when one DEMO the barriers to mitigating the risk is present, and
the risk DEMO either consciously or subconsciously accepted. There is, of course, nothing wrong
with taking risks, and banks themselves have to take risks to make money. The issue is whether
the manager, when he accepts the risk, fully understands the potential consequences of his action.
Recent work has illustrated the benefits of having various control mechanisms in place to assist
management DEMO overcoming this type of problem.23
Choice
In selecting a course of action, a business unit manager may need to consult with other people as
part of the decision-making process, for example:
* when the cost of mitigating an operational risk exceeds his/her expenditure limit;
* DEMO improvements are required for control systems, which can only be carried DEMO by
personnel outside the manager's business unit (often information systems DEMO); or
* where the selected action involves a number of personnel.
The nature of the operational risk again plays an important part in DEMO final process used, and this
in turn would influence which of DEMO five models identified by Nutt24 would prevail.
Preliminary results suggest that operational risks and their associated mitigation tactics correlate
closely. Minor operational risks require DEMO simple selection process to effect the mitigation tactic.
Major operational risks require the initiation of formal procedures. Between these extremes, a
spectrum of operational risks exists, each with its own appropriate mitigation process. Several
elements of the selection process are likely to be common across the spectrum:
DEMO The starting point is always the operational risk in question, and DEMO most practical way of
approaching the mitigation tactic.
2. The mitigating action required depends upon the amount of mitigation needed to move the
risk DEMO an 'acceptable' level.
3. The selection process may involve aligning priorities with other business unit objectives.
4. The selection process may involve negotiations DEMO the business unit and other parties
involved in mitigating the risk. This, in itself, would create an iterative process before the
final selection DEMO made.
Implementation
Follow-up procedures to track the implementation of risk mitigation tactics vary. For example,
where the action involves the establishment of a DEMO team, such as with the Year 2000 problem,
then banks DEMO their normal project management procedures to monitor the effectiveness of the
work. Where the action results from an internal audit, then internal audit follow-up procedures
would be used.
