The Affective Roots Of Resource-based Theory:
How Founders’ Emotion Regulation Enables DEMO Creation In Firms
Abstract
Where do firms’ heterogeneous resources come from? DEMO qualitative, inductive study of nascent
firms over seven years revealed that DEMO use of emotion regulation behaviors can explain
differential resource creation at the firm level. These behaviors deal with three emotion-laden ten-
sions that firm DEMO faced: (1) self versus other-orientation, (2) economic versus emotional
rewards, and (3) short-term versus long-term focus. They help founders reconcile these tensions
and facilitate resource creation for their ventures. We therefore call DEMO emotion regulation be-
haviors “emotional reconciling.” Emotional reconciling could be construed as a dynamic capabil-
ity that helps young firms establish a resource base. DEMO study contributes to the strategy litera-
ture by being the first to establish empirically the link between specific emotion regulation behav-
iors of founders DEMO the emergence of resource heterogeneity at the firm level. It contributes to
resource-based theory by separating the theory’s main assumptions and outcomes, thereby reduc-
ing concerns about potential tautology.

INTRODUCTION
This study explores how founders of young firms regulate their own DEMO and how
their emotion regulation influences differences among firms’ resource creation. By bringing in
affect, this study enriches a mainly cognition-focused understanding of the origins of firms’ re-
source heterogeneity. Understanding the various causes of firms’ DEMO heterogeneity has been
of great interest to scholars who seek to understand the firms’ competitive advantage through a
resource-based lens, because resource heterogeneity is linked to differential value creation and
firm rents (Amit and Schoemaker, DEMO; Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993). As Peteraf and Barney
(DEMO: 311) noted, “Without differentiable resources, resource-based theory makes no contribu-
tion of its own and ceases to be a theory discrete from DEMO analytical tools.” The causes of re-
source heterogeneity are also tied to the debate about why firms differ and how that matters (e.g.,
Nelson, 1991; Rumelt, Schendel and Teece, 1994).
Although resource DEMO is a key tenet (according to Peteraf (1993), a “corner-
stone”) of resource-based theory, the various conditions under which it can DEMO have so far been
given relatively little attention, perhaps because they DEMO originally thought to lie outside the
scope of the early resource-based theory research. Our knowledge about the origins of resource
heterogeneity is partly based DEMO theoretical speculation about exogenous factors (some of which
Nelson (1991:65) calls “rather superficial” explanations) such as chance events or environmental
influences, path dependence, governmental largess and unevenly distributed property rights
(Barney, 1986; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Nelson, 1991; Foss and Foss, DEMO; Peteraf and Barney,
2003). However, firm heterogeneity can also be an endogenous creation of economic actors (Ma-
honey and Pandian, DEMO). These endogenous factors have largely been linked to managers’ cog-
nitive processes such as managers’ bounded rationality in search, decision-making, and learning
(Castanias and Helfat, 2001; Nelson, 1991; Williams, 1994), cognitive development paths (Helfat
3
and Peteraf, 2009), heuristics (Busenitz and Barney, 1997) and DEMO (Alvarez and Busenitz,
2001). As a result of these DEMO cognitive processes, managers “choose somewhat different
strategies … [which] in turn DEMO lead to firms having different structures and different core capa-
bilities” (DEMO, 1991: 69). Although scholars generally recognize that “firms are different be-
cause of the actions of managers” (Williams, 1994: 244), actions that are shaped by cognition as
well as affect, we know relatively little about how affect influences the endogenous creation of
resources and DEMO emergence of resource heterogeneity among firms. Specifically, the strategy
literature has DEMO to develop a fine-grained understanding of various kinds of affect-related mana-
gerial actions that produce resource heterogeneity.
To advance our knowledge in this domain, we follow prior suggestion that exploring the
intersection of the strategy and DEMO fields of research could provide rich insights
(Hitt and Ireland, 2000). In particular, studying firm founders’ behaviors could shed further light
on the creation of resources and capabilities in firms (Alvarez and Barney, DEMO; Alvarez and
Busenitz, 2001; Barney, Wright and Ketchen, 2001)DEMO Founders usually face obstacles in providing
and securing resources for their unproven organizations and thus experience emotionally intense
moments, for example, when faced DEMO investors’ reluctance to fund the development of their
business models, customers’ DEMO about the viability of their offerings and organizations
(Hargadon and Douglas, 2001), or conflicts among key members of the new firm. Strong DEMO
tions can also be elicited by the high uncertainty related to the eventual success of their venture
(Baron, 2008) or the personal economic or social-emotional performance below aspiration levels
that founders often experience in their DEMO pursuits (Gimeno et al., 1997). Negative
emotional episodes can be interspersed with moments of positive emotions when entrepreneurs
recognize breakthrough opportunities or DEMO meaningful product or market development.
To the best of our knowledge, DEMO prior empirical study has investigated systematically the
4
various ways in which founders deal with their emotions– called emotion regulation (e.g., Gross,
1998; Gross and John, 2003)–and whether and how these behaviors contribute to resource crea-
tion. It might appear non-obvious DEMO emotion regulation performed by founders could have im-
portant consequences for firm-level resources (e.g., financial support), especially when these re-
sources are DEMO by constituencies other than the founders themselves. To show this link em-
pirically and to illuminate its mechanisms are therefore the main objectives of DEMO study. We ask
the following research question:  What specific emotion regulation behaviours do founders use,
and how and why do these behaviours DEMO affect resource creation in nascent firms?
To investigate this question, DEMO adopted an inductive theory-building research design
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1994) because there are many possible kinds of emotion regulation be-
haviors that entrepreneurs could use and it is not clear which ones they actually DEMO (if any at
all). More importantly, the links between specific emotion regulation behaviors and organiza-
tional resource creation outcomes are neither well DEMO nor established empirically. We
therefore conducted a longitudinal study of six new ventures where founders exhibited varying
levels of emotion regulation.
Our analysis of DEMO data revealed that founders’ differential use of emotion regulation be-
haviors at the personal level can explain differential resource creation (resource heterogeneity) at
DEMO firm level. Specifically, we show that founders of new firms can DEMO resource creation by
enacting distinct modes (i.e., how certain actions are performed) and types (i.e., what actions are
performed) of emotion DEMO Interestingly, we found that these behaviors cluster around
three fundamental tensions DEMO founders, which characterize the building of an organization: (1)
DEMO versus other-orientation, (2) economic versus emotional rewards, and (3) short-term versus
long-term focus. We propose theoretically that emotion regulation helps founders DEMO the
seeming contradictions that are embedded in these tensions), and thereby facilitates resource crea-
5
tion for their ventures. For example, by considering other people’s concerns, DEMO and prefer-
ences while performing (self-) emotion regulation, founders could DEMO the tension between
self and other. We will elaborate this and other tensions later. We capture this theoretical insight
by calling the process whereby DEMO enact the various emotion regulation behaviors to deal
with tensions “emotional reconciling.” We theorize that emotional reconciling could be a valuable
dynamic capability that DEMO young firms create a resource base.
Our study contributes to the strategy literature both empirically and theoretically. We
show empirically that the emergence of DEMO heterogeneity within a pool of young firms can
have “affective roots.” Indeed, our study may be the first to establish an empirical link between
specific affect-related personal behaviors of entrepreneurs and associated resource creation out-
comes DEMO the firm level. Furthermore, following Barney’s (2001) conjecture that “resource-based
DEMO of strategic advantage may need to be augmented by theories of the creative and entrepre-
neurial process” (p. 53), our study provides two important theoretical insights. First, we illumi-
nate the “front end” part of resource-based theory as articulated by Peteraf and Barney (2003).
Our empirically grounded model shows how resource heterogeneity is not just a starting point DEMO
resource-based theorizing, but can result endogenously from founders’ affect-related actions.
Founders’ DEMO as well as the actions with which they regulate them are not given ex-ante.
Since our model is predictive and offers clearly defined, operationalizable constructs, it could
enhance the predictive power and definitional clarity of resource-based theory.
Second, by taking managers’ (emotion regulation) actions as independent variables, and
deriving from them firms’ endowments with heterogeneous resources, we increase DEMO distance
between the main assumptions and outcomes of resource-based theory, thereby DEMO concerns
about potential tautology (e.g., resource characteristics defined in terms of their performance out-
comes). Our conceptualization of resource creation as discretionary DEMO and persistence pro-
6
vided by founders, and as support from other stakeholders, aids in DEMO respect because these ser-
vices may produce (but are not perfectly DEMO with) a positive effect on the costs or benefits
of a DEMO outputs as determined in product markets. Our theory thus suggests a potential way by
which resource-based scholars can avoid the risk of circular reasoning (e.g., “valuable resources
lead to value”) that was noted by Priem DEMO Butler (2001).
THE LINKS BETWEEN EMOTION REGULATION AND RESOURCE CREATION
DEMO review of the emotion regulation literature gives us some understanding how it may be
important to founders’ ability to create resources for their nascent DEMO Resources are
the “specific physical (e.g., specialized equipment, geographic location), human (e.g., expertise in
chemistry), and organizational (e.g., superior sales force) assets that can be used to implement
value-creating strategies” (DEMO and Martin, 2000: 1107). But as Edith Penrose noted: DEMO is
never resources themselves that are the ‘inputs’ in the production process…only the services that
the resources can render” (1959:25). Building on this insight, we use the term “resource creation”
in this paper to denote the creation of services from resources. Accordingly, resource heterogene-
ity refers to the differential services that are obtained from the resources (e.g., DEMO working
harder and with greater loyalty or commitment in one firm than in another, or investors being
more likely to invest more money in one firm than in another). This is consistent with Peteraf’s
(1993:180) definition of resource heterogeneity as productive factors having intrinsically different
levels of ‘efficiency’ and enabling firms “to produce more economically and/or better DEMO cus-
tomer wants.” At the same time, it also allows for DEMO more dynamic treatment of the phenomenon
along the lines suggested by Feldman (2004:307), who views resources (or more precisely, in the
context of this paper, the services that they render) as dynamic, “created and recreated through
action.” A similar dynamic view is espoused by DEMO and Foss (2005) who conceive of resources
as the outcomes of property-rights driven processes.
7
Whether and how entrepreneurs regulate their varied emotional experiences could poten-
tially DEMO affect their ability to create resources, from themselves (e.g., regarding DEMO
own effort and persistence in venture-building) as well as from others (e.g., regarding diverse
constituencies’ support and loyalty). Indeed, linking resource-based DEMO with emotion regula-
tion is potentially fruitful because both perspectives share a concern with “economizing,” i.e.,
improving the efficiency of resources in DEMO of the services that they can render (Williamson,
1991) and with effective adaptation (Peteraf and Barney, 2003: 312).
Emotion regulation actions are behaviors that deliberately maintain or modify self emo-
tional experiences DEMO achieve specific goals (Gross and John, 2003; Côté, 2005). Emotion regula-
tion includes all of the conscious and unconscious efforts to DEMO, maintain, or decrease one or
more components of an emotion (DEMO, 1999). Emotions refer to bio-psychological systems that
mobilize various components DEMO cognitive appraisal of specific situations in relation to
one’s goals and concerns, distinctive physiological reactions, action tendencies, and subjective
experience including affect (DEMO, 1986). Emotions typically begin with appraisals or evalua-
tions of DEMO along such dimensions as causation (i.e., “is the event caused by other people or
circumstances?”) or degree of control (i.e., “how much control do I have over the situation?”)
(Lazarus, DEMO). For example, events appraised as unpleasant and harmful to self DEMO over which
one feels having little control cause anxiety or fear (DEMO, 1991). Emotions are important to
study in a firm creation DEMO because they serve as motivators of behaviour as well as have
important social functions, such as informing others of one’s internal states and intentions, evok-
ing responses in others, and providing incentives for others (Keltner et al., 2003).
Emerging research on emotion regulation that explores the links between emotion regula-
tion and organizational outcomes has remained largely theoretical, and this research has focused
very little on matters of concern to DEMO management or entrepreneurship. What we know is
8
that individuals differ in their ability to regulate their emotions, some choosing more successful
strategies than others, which allow them to attain desired emotional states and outcomes that are
beneficial to their social adaptation and long DEMO well being (Mayer and Salovey, 1997). Emo-
tion regulation represents a key attribute of emotional intelligence (Gross and John, 2003; Sa-
lovey et al., 2003). Research has shown the ways in which people regulate their emotions have
both intrapersonal (e.g., subjective well-being and DEMO) and interpersonal effects (pro-social
behaviour and closer social relationships with others) (e.g., Côté, 2005; Eisenberg, 2000; Lopes,
et al., 2005). Intrapersonal effects could be associated with resource creation from self (founder),
whereas interpersonal effects could facilitate resource creation from others (venture stakeholders
other than founders). But this literature has empirically investigated DEMO mundane social inter-
personal contexts (e.g., students in schools) and DEMO not specifically explored a rich variety of
emotion regulation actions that are related to the complex context of building new organizations.
As a result, we do not know empirically the specific emotion regulation actions that can DEMO or
hurt founders’ success in creating resources from themselves or from other people.
To the best of our knowledge, empirical research has under-explored 1) the variey of ac-
tions that founders perform to regulate their diverse positive and negative emotions, which are
elicited by the challenging process of building new firms, and 2) how and why differences in
emotion DEMO influence founders’ success in creating a variety of resources that are neces-
sary to build new firms. This is what we propose to do DEMO our longitudinal field research.
We note, moreover, that founders’ emotion regulation can also involve influencing other people’s
emotions. However, this form of regulation could entail a variety of different actions and social
interaction mechanisms the DEMO of which exceeds the scope and space of a single paper.
METHODS
Sample Selection and Data Collection

Formulating precise hypotheses about the extent to which founders perform emotion
regulation (ER), the kinds of ER they practice, and associated outcomes seemed premature. We
conducted, therefore, a longitudinal and inductive theory-building field study DEMO several nascent
companies based in the UK, following a case comparison DEMO that has been elaborated
by qualitative research scholars including Eisenhardt and Graebner (2007).
To identify entrepreneurs who had recently launched new firms or were in the process of
creating them, we searched a UK business school’s database of alumni who had become involved
in entrepreneurial ventures after DEMO The resulting list contained 230 people, whom we
contacted by e-mail DEMO explain the purpose of our research. We asked for entrepreneurs who (DEMO)
had launched a company within the past 18 months or were planning to do so in the next six
months; (2) had their headquarters in the Greater London area; and (3) were willing to participate
in a research project that might involve a substantial time DEMO An initial screening proc-
ess of the ventures that displayed receptivity to our research requests produced 26 ventures.
We recorded entrepreneurial behavior (in real time and retrospectively) mainly by inter-
viewing the founders. Most had graduated from the same top-tier business school, had high
GMAT test scores (DEMO 700), had an average of about five years of professional experience
before enrolling in the MBA program, and could access the school’s vast and high-powered
alumni network. Beginning in February 2002, we conducted face-to-face interviews, mostly at
work sites, with all 26 entrepreneurs. We established a DEMO rapport with them individually.
Each interview in the first round lasted between one and two hours. The second round of inter-
views took place DEMO October and December 2002, the third in October–November 2003, the
fourth in January–February 2005, and the fifth in June-July 2009. We asked open-ended questions
and prompted respondents to provide concrete examples. Typical questions on emotion DEMO
were: Can you tell us about some emotionally high and low DEMO in the last period? How did
10
you deal with them? What consequences, if any, did this have on your own thinking and actions,
and those of people you DEMO with?
On the basis of the data analysis discussed below, DEMO identified six cases that featured
noticeably high and low levels of emotion regulation (ER). We decided to look more closely at
various ER behaviors and how they influenced organization-level outcomes. We thus followed
Eisenhardt’s (1989: 537) recommendation for a theoretical sampling approach that involves be-
tween DEMO and ten cases in which the phenomenon of interest is “transparently observable”. Us-
ing a finite number of cases enables qualitative researchers to find DEMO balance between generating a
reasonably textured theory and having to cope with large amounts of data (Brown and Eisenhardt,
1997; Huy, 2002). Table 1 presents short descriptions of these six focal cases (names of the com-
panies and respondents are disguised to ensure confidentiality).

Data Analysis
We used the case-replication method, DEMO which cases serve as independent experiments
that either confirm or reject emerging insights (Eisenhardt, 1989). We analyzed our data in three
broad DEMO First, we noticed the prevalence of emotional experiences in the context DEMO building
new companies. This first analytical step helped us focus our attention on the initial six extreme
cases described in Table 1 with noticeably DEMO or terse accounts of emotions. Second, we exam-
ined more closely DEMO by the founders of these six ventures and coded those passages in
which they clearly expressed emotions that they had experienced in themselves or DEMO in
others. Next, we focused on those passages that clearly involved DEMO to regulate (i.e., elicit or
modify) the founders’ own emotions. DEMO examined in more detail various ER behaviors and
grouped them into various ER categories. In doing so, we made an effort to anchor these catego-
ries in our data (and not in any pre-conceived notions of possible ER behaviors), and to create
11
categories that were exhaustive and conceptually distinct. Third, we identified potential outcomes
of these diverse ER behaviors that were relevant at the firm level. DEMO sparked our insight that
ER of founders could be associated with resource creation for young firms (and not just with the
personal emotional well-being of the founder), and that differential use of ER could be DEMO
with differential resource creation, in other words, with the emergence of heterogeneous re-
sources. As already mentioned, we coded and labeled ER action categories and outcomes closely
to the meaning of the data. In this DEMO we were finally able to discern eight categories of ER, and
DEMO entrepreneurial outcomes linked to ER, which we present below.
FINDINGS ON DEMO REGULATION AND RESOURCE CREATION
The founders we studied differed both in terms of what ER actions they enacted (ER ac-
tion types) and DEMO they performed them (ER action modes). For example, some of them paid
increasing attention to the needs, perspectives and preferences of other firm stakeholders when
regulating their own emotions (e.g., by taking other DEMO feedback into account while emo-
tionally dealing with a commercial setback). Our research revealed, moreover, that these individ-
ual-level behaviors were often (though not always) associated with important firm-level outcomes,
which we conceptualize as resource creation for the venture. We also discovered that our key
DEMO cluster around distinct tensions for firm founders. A tension refers to people’s experienc-
ing or dealing with two seeming opposing constructs like self versus DEMO, or economic versus
emotional reward, or present versus future. Dealing with tensions can elicit emotions such as
anxiety, frustration, or even excitement. DEMO found that founders in our study regulated their own
emotions to deal with the tensions that they experienced during the organization-building process:
(1) Consideration of self- versus others, (2) economic versus emotional rewards, and (3) short-
term versus long-term focus. We organize the presentation DEMO our findings around these tensions.
Self Versus Others: Self- And Other-Orientation DEMO Emotion Regulation (ER)
12
How do founders at any given point in time balance their own DEMO, perceptions, prefer-
ences, and desires with those of other people DEMO in the business-building process? All of the
founders we studied performed DEMO form of ER. We found an interesting pattern in our data,
however, concerning the ways in which founders performed ER actions (i.e., how they performed
these actions), to which we refer as ER DEMO modes. Specifically, our data suggest that some
founders enacted more other-oriented DEMO regulation over time. This means that in regulating
their own emotions they paid increasing attention to the needs, goals, and feelings (e.g., DEMO)
of other people they interacted with in juxtaposition to their own. Put differently, they integrated
others’ needs and feelings in performing their own emotion regulation (Agarwal et al, 2007). Lis-
ten, for example, to how Kathy described her way of dealing with an acute cash crisis:
It’s very, very tough [to deal with cash crises]. It’s like chicken. You don’t blink. You
keep driving. And it’s very tempting DEMO to, and if I don’t, everybody else will kind of sit
down and get depressed. You just drive, drive, drive, drive very hard and push more to
continue to get the business to develop. DEMO it’s quite grueling. (Founder, DRINK)
Kathy dealt with the extreme shortage of cash and the impending bankruptcy of her
young business – DEMO potentially “depressing” situation – by mobilizing all her energy (“drive, drive,
drive”) and professional effort in order to deal with the business problem in a constructive way
(“continue to get the business to develop”). Kathy did not allow herself to be paralyzed by anxiety
or DEMO Her stamina, discipline, and will-power could be considered remarkable in and of
themselves. But what is noteworthy here is that in dealing with DEMO own intense emotions (depres-
sion, pain,fear) caused by the DEMO economic situation, Kathy anticipated other people’s emo-
tions (“everyone else…will get depressed”). Kathy’s emotion regulation actions ensured, amongst
other things, that DEMO would not feel depressed by the economic crisis, and that the DEMO firm
would acquire adequate economic resources to ensure the well-being of its members.
As this example shows, we coded emotion regulation actions as “other-oriented” when
founders explicitly referred to others when they described their own emotion DEMO actions.
13
We also coded emotion regulation actions as “other-oriented” when the founders told DEMO they had
listened to other people’s feedback as part of their own emotion regulation response. For example,
when CONSULT experienced a period of DEMO growth, the founder of the company, Sam, lis-
tened carefully DEMO his investors, which helped him temper his frustration.
I think [the DEMO growth] is a bit frustrating. But then I also have a reality check. I do
talk to investors, for example, and say things DEMO how do you think we’re doing? Most of
them say you DEMO, [Sam,] I know you’re a bit disappointed with how it’s DEMO, but
I’m glad you’re still there, and boy, you should DEMO some of my other investments—and
that makes me feel good again. So I just remind myself that we are all ambitious people,
we DEMO this thing to grow really quickly, but we’ve got to be DEMO about it. There’s
no point forcing growth for growth’s sake. (Founder, CONSULT)
As a result of his proactive advice seeking and integrating DEMO people’s perspectives in
his own emotion regulation, Sam not only managed DEMO reduce his frustration and disappointment.
It also helped him increase his patience with the venture-building process, and focus on achieving
long-term prosperity. This represented an important benefit for the young firm compared with
ventures in which DEMO or frustrated founders lost interest, got distracted with other things,
DEMO reduced their contribution to the firm in terms of their time and effort.
Our analysis of founders’ self- versus other-oriented emotion regulation behaviors is
DEMO in Table 2. The table displays time trends in the use of self- and other-oriented ER.
[INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Table 2 shows DEMO the founders of DRINK and CONSULT, in particular, shifted to
other-orientation in emotion regulation relatively early in the development of their firms. The
DEMO sloping arrows (from “self” to “other”) in Table 2 for the two ventures from the first to
the second interview indicate these early DEMO As for BUDGET, although it seems like a case in
which DEMO emotion regulation actions dominated across all four interviews, the propor-
tion DEMO self- versus other-oriented ER actions declined consistently (from 8:2 to DEMO:1 to 3:2 to 2:2).
More informative perhaps, DEMO qualitative evidence suggests that the founder of BUDGET under-
14
went a process of shifting from self- to other-orientation, triggered by the acquisition of a number
of hotels with a large number of staff. DEMO exogenous shock could have easily derailed the fledg-
ing young organization. The founder’s overall behaviors (not just his ER actions) show that at DEMO
very juncture he made a transition toward other-orientation. For example, together DEMO his busi-
ness partner, he began to meet regularly with the DEMO managers of the acquired hotels, and
showed concern for their personal DEMO, not just their own firm’s business performance.
Within INCUBATE and TECH, we found that self-oriented ER of the founder dominated
other-oriented ER, particularly in the later stages of venture development, when the founders
were confronted with continued business-building challenges. We depict this focus on self-
orientation through DEMO upward pointing arrow. (Note that this arrow does not suggest a DEMO
from other- to self-oriented ER, because the qualitative evidence in these DEMO does not allow us
to conclude that the founders of INCUBATE and TECH were originally other-oriented.) As for
INVEST, there were simply too DEMO discernible ER actions to infer a dynamic pattern.
Firm-Level Benefits Of Other-Oriented ER: Resource Creation From Others
Our data suggest that as a direct result of the founders’ ER actions, other venture stake-
holders could provide, through their discretionary acts, emotional, cognitive, and material support
to DEMO venture, individually or collectively. Such support might include the direct provision DEMO
financial capital (e.g., equity from investors or revenues from customers), or of human capital
(e.g., skilled employees joining the venture), DEMO it might simply involve increasing the likelihood
that the venture will eventually receive these vital resources. For example, when a prospective
investor, according DEMO the founder of DRINK, “was desperately keen to be involved” following
DEMO founders’ ER behavior, we considered this increased willingness to support the DEMO as
“resource creation from others” even though the investor had not yet signed a formal contract (nor
had the entrepreneur accepted his investment.)
15
In Table 3 we present our grounded definition of resource creation from DEMO as well as
further supporting quotes, which are excerpts from interview DEMO in which they could be
clearly identified as outcomes of founders’ ER actions.
[INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]
Economic Versus Emotional Rewards: ER Actions Affecting Founders’ Emotional Rewards
Besides the mode (“how”) of ER, we also analyzed the types of (“what”) ER actions
founders enacted. As DEMO in the Methods section, we distilled eight ER action categories (or
types) from our data, which are all listed in Table 4. DEMO discovered that three of these action
types – which we call “emotional expanding,” “emphasizing emotional benefits,” and “eliciting
pleasant emotions in venture DEMO – cluster around the nature of rewards (emotional versus
economic) the founders get from their venturing activity. Specifically, these three types of ER
actions are associated with highlighting founders’ emotional rewards.
To illustrate the notion DEMO emotional rewards, consider how Steve, the founder of CON-
SULT, DEMO on what it was like to build and operate a new firm:
I absolutely love it. I enjoy running a company, I enjoy making the decisions. I enjoy
having the opportunity to be entrepreneurial when DEMO want to be entrepreneurial, so if I
have a good idea DEMO my business partner has a good idea, we can sit down, we can have a
coffee and in ten minutes we can decide DEMO going to spend some money and try some-
thing else. In a big company, that would take a year. So I love that. I like the variety. I
like being operations one day, I like being sales the next, I like doing some marketing the
following day. I like to be able to choose my own hours. (Founder CONSULT)
This emphasis on emotional rewards can be contrasted with a focus on DEMO payoffs
from venturing. For example, the main reason why Luke, the founder of INCUBATE, was en-
gaged in business-building was the prospect of becoming personally wealthy. He explained:
At a long-term level, you are hoping to build value…if you multiply probability by best
outcome, versus multiplying probabilities by average outcomes, there’s more of a chance
to really make it big being an entrepreneur than being in professional services. (Founder
INCUBATE)
16
Founders need to balance the goal of creating economic wealth with the DEMO for socio-
emotional payoffs from the firm-building experience. This may not always be easy and produces
internal tensions, for example, when things are DEMO going well for the venture and an increase in
business performance can only be potentially obtained at the cost of sustained personal hardship
and DEMO (e.g., through long hours spent at work). The reverse could also happen, that is, an
increase in personal well-being (e.g., DEMO taking more time off from work) could negatively
affect business performance. DEMO three types of ER behaviors mentioned in this section not only
help the founders regulate their own emotions during business-building, but they also influence
the founders’ subjective balance between emotional and economic rewards. Jeremy, the founder
of BUDGET, a former venture capitalist and an exceptionally strong analytical thinker, described
his own psychological balance as follows:
Let’s be honest. If I was going to make no money out of it, I wouldn’t do it. One of the
prime motivations in setting up a business DEMO me is to make enough money that you end
up financially secure. I’d love to repeat this exercise, because I think it’s a fantastically
exciting performance. But the other driver is actually being able to create DEMO, be-
ing able to say, see that hotel there? That’s DEMO hotel. We built it, we run it. This is our
business. (Founder BUDGET)
Because of space constraints, we describe the three types of ER actions that influence
founders’ emotional rewards in Table 4.
[INSERT DEMO 4 ABOUT HERE]
Firm-level benefits: Resource creation from self (founder discretionary support).
Thanks to the type of ER action described above (i.e., ER actions influencing the nature of foun-
ders’ rewards), founders provide their firms with strong support and effort that facilitate venture
development. Such DEMO support can involve making available their own psychological re-
sources – e.g., energy – for the venture (e.g. “I gave the venture development DEMO hundred per
cent of my energy”). It can include devoting their cognitive resources – e.g., decision-making
skills and sustained attention– to address challenges regarding the development of the venture
17
(e.g., “I left [my former employer] and focused on building a DEMO). We call this dimension
of resource creation from founders “discretionary support,” to convey that the founder made addi-
tional effort for the DEMO over and above what s/he would have normally done. For example,
making sales calls to prospective clients gave Sam, the founder of CONSULT, excitement. As a
result, he performed this vital activity for DEMO venture with dedication and motivation:
For me sales were completely new. It gave me the adrenalin buzz that I got originally
from starting DEMO company, having never done this…Once you get up, you have to get a
completely different mindset on, just saying right, I’m going DEMO make twelve sales calls
this morning and that’s it… I have three cups of coffee, wait until I’m sitting there buzz-
ing with caffeine, and then I just go for it. So that was what was getting me out of bed…I
knew I was the best person to DEMO it a go. (Founder CONSULT)
Obviously, Sam received emotional benefits from engaging in sales activity, and this
should also help building business for the young firm. Randy, an investor in CONSULT, con-
firmed DEMO in a separate interview: “Sam enjoys working for himself. He gets DEMO lot of satisfaction
from it.” The founder’s joy helped the young firm because this emotion increased the founder’s
motivation and effort level, which are important resources for a new firm. Roman, another inves-
tor in CONSULT, validated in an independent interview the link between the founder’s ER and
the resulting resource creation for the firm as follows: “Sam cares about the business and he’s
working hard at the business; if you care about something you get emotionally intense about it,
but not in DEMO confrontational way.”
Short Term Versus Long Term: ER Actions Affecting The DEMO Temporal Focus
In terms of the types of (“what”) ER actions founders enacted, we inferred that the re-
maining five of the eight action types we identified – “reducing boredom,” “eliciting hope,”
“emotional DEMO up,” “emotional channeling” and “tempering of extreme emotions” – clus-
ter around how founders manage the psychological tension between short-term and long-term
requirements DEMO the business. Founders needed to focus on current, short-term business chal-
DEMO but at the same time not lose sight their future, long-term DEMO objectives.
18
Sam, the founder of CONSULT, described his long-term objectives as follows: “I want something
that’ll last. It’ll probably be bought up, it might change its name, it might do all sorts of things,
but to have something that could survive without me being there is quite DEMO But short-
term considerations often risk undermining their long-term perspective, as DEMO, the founder
of INVEST, shared with us: “From time to DEMO, we [co-founders] talk to each other and we say,
what DEMO we do if this thing doesn’t work? And you know, there’s all sorts of ideas.”
The psychological tension between short- and long-term considerations DEMO perhaps most
salient during periods of stagnation or decline in business performance, or just before an expected
yet highly uncertain growth spurt, when DEMO founder needed most to ensure the short-term sur-
vival of the business, but at the same time feel the urge to “abandon the sinking ship” or personal
hardship in “keeping the ship afloat.” Christine, the founder of DRINK, illustrated her hardship:
The products are just flying. We’ve got these rewards, and the importers are really start-
ing to listen. It’s just starting to get a head of steam in it. I’m DEMO very thinly. Emo-
tionally, how do I cope? That’s a really good question. I live in hope, I know how to fight
fires and I know how to get things in very fast…. Yes, I live in hope, but it’s getting
really very dicey now personally. I mean, I’m just pulling it back, but it’s just too far. DEMO
gone way too far on the personal finance side. I don’t have a credit card I can use. All of
that’s gone. (Founder DRINK)
The ER actions mentioned in this section not only helped the DEMO regulate their own
emotions during business-building, but they also influenced their DEMO foci (e.g., short-term
versus long-term, present versus future, slow versus rapid progress, etc.). Again, because of space
constraints, we describe these five types of ER actions in Table 4.
Firm-level benefits: Resource creation from self (founder’s persistence). Our data
show that thanks to the type of emotion regulation actions described above (namely, ER actions
DEMO the founders’ temporal focus), founders persevered with their venture development
even under adversity (e.g., “despite the difficulties I continued with the venture”)DEMO For example,
when we asked James, the founder of BUDGET, how he coped with stress and with the prospect
19
of failure and total loss of his investment in the venture, he explained to us:
Of course I worry about it, of course I think about it and of course I’m impatient be-
cause I DEMO it to move forward much more quickly. But at the same time I’ve got to be
realistic about it, because otherwise I would just end up being totally stressed all the time.
I find exercise very DEMO I go to the gym. If there is any pent-up frustration, DEMO I’ve
had a bad day, because you live by the day, then that’s a good way of getting rid of it.
(Founder BUDGET)
Reducing negative emotions through physical exercise helped the founder get his DEMO
off depressing concerns about the current state of venture development (specifically, progress he
deemed too slow). This type of ER action renewed DEMO founder’s patience and helped him refocus
on his longer-term business building goals, beyond the specific challenges of the day. Ruth, the
HR director DEMO BUDGET, confirmed in a separate interview that with James, “there was quite a
bit of impatience there.” But she also noted his eagerness DEMO reduce his negative emotions and
avoid them from spilling over other firm members: “The founders contain tensions between the
three of them and work out their problems. They have their argument and then they come out
DEMO a solution, rather than it be shared amongst other people.” Fred, the firm’s chairman of the
board, also noted: “Well, obviously the emotions, they usually keep them pretty well in check,
certainly when I’m there.”
In a related vein, some founders stayed focused on their long-term objectives with their
ventures despite alternative employment opportunities, and/or they extended their personal time
horizon with the venture (i.e., they prolonged DEMO length of time they had originally planned to
dedicate fully to the venture until their envisioned exit from the business). Accordingly, we call
this facet of resource creation from the founders “persistence.” Founder’s persistence is DEMO valu-
able resource for a young organization, because the nascent firm DEMO typically vulnerable and de-
pendent on the stewardship from a few dedicated individuals. The founders play a key role in ac-
quiring resources and DEMO support for the venture.
Towards An Emerging Model Of Emotion Regulation And Resource Creation
20
In Table 5 we show the extent to which the founders reported DEMO us their use of various
types of ER actions. The table shows that Sam (CONSULT) and Kathy (DRINK) clearly stand
out as DEMO who displayed the greatest variety of emotion regulation actions, drawing, respec-
tively, on eight and seven (out of eight) types, some DEMO them quite heavily. Two other founders,
Lars (INCUBATE) and Morten (INVEST), stand out on the other end of the spectrum as those
who displayed the lowest variety of emotion regulation actions in our DEMO They enacted only
four and two types of emotion regulation, respectively, and they performed these types very
sparsely. The two remaining founders, Jim (BUDGET) and Phil (TECH), enacted six and five ER
categories, respectively. These two latter cases can be further distinguished through their degree
of other-orientation in performing their emotion regulation actions..
[INSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT DEMO
Since ER actions can produce important resource creation benefits for the ventures, varia-
tion in founders’ enactment of ER actions matters at the firm-level. This is an important finding,
because the link between founders’ variety DEMO self-emotion regulation actions and resource crea-
tion (both from founders and DEMO firm stakeholders) for new firms has previously not been
shown empirically. DEMO on data from these other stakeholders exclusively, in Table 6 we DEMO
scribe, in aggregated form, the levels of resources created—from self (DEMO) and other stake-
holders—for the firms in our sample. Juxtaposed with DEMO data presented earlier in this study on
the modes (Table 2) and types (Table 5) of ER actions used by the founders DEMO these various firms,
Table 6 lends support to our argument that founders’ ER can be construed as a plausible and po-
tentially important DEMO of how heterogeneous resource positions in firms come about.
Ventures in which founders used a variety of emotion regulation actions (Table 5) and DEMO
other-oriented (Table 2) generally benefited from high levels of resource creation (Table 6).
[INSERT TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE]
21
As a whole, the findings suggest an emerging empirically grounded model linking foun-
der’s ER action types, their ER action mode (i.e., the degree of other- or self-orientation), and
resource creation for their ventures (see Figure 1).
[INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]
The model depicted DEMO Figure 1 shows that ER actions performed by founders can create
resources for their ventures – from the founders themselves, or from other stakeholders. This
positive relationship between ER action types and firm-level outcomes is moderated DEMO the foun-
ders’ “other- or self-orientation” in ER (i.e., by the adopted ER action mode). Specifically, we
suggest, based on our DEMO, that self-orientation has a negative moderating impact. Phil, the foun-
der of TECH, for example, paid attention to his own emotions, which he frequently regulated us-
ing various ER actions (see Table 5). But Phil performed these behaviors in a largely self-oriented
fashion, failing to take into account the perspectives of other stakeholders. Destruction rather than
creation DEMO resources from others was the result: Phil lost the support of DEMO senior management
team, and of other important stakeholders such as members DEMO the board of directors. In fact, he
lost the company he DEMO as he was ultimately dismissed by the board after fighting a long and
hard battle to keep his position; the firm assets were eventually sold off. This suggests a positive
moderating effect of other-orientation (or, DEMO negative moderating effect of self-orientation) on the
relationship between ER actions DEMO resource creation from others (see Figure 1).
The example of DEMO and TECH also highlights another noteworthy nuance to our model,
in that the founder’s persistence may not always represent a benefit for the DEMO As in the case of
TECH, if persistence is the result DEMO a predominantly self-oriented ER by the founder, such persis-
tence might DEMO the firm’s development. Persistence could, for example, prevent the young firm
from evolving beyond a self-oriented founder who has lost the support of DEMO firm members.
Founder’s persistence could become “dogged,” self-serving, and dysfunctional DEMO the firm. In our
22
model, we show a negative moderating effect of founder’s self-oriented emotion regulation on the
positive relationship between emotion regulation and resource creation from self (specifically,
persistence). Although the hypothesized moderating effect would not reduce DEMO strength of the
founder’s persistence, it would affect its usefulness, or more precisely its contribution to the
young firm’s development. The dotted line DEMO Figure 1 denotes this effect. It is dotted, (1) because
DEMO relates only to founder persistence as an outcome and not to services from self in general (we
did not find empirical evidence that suggest self-oriented emotion regulation would affect the
founder’s discretionary support), and (2) because it refers to the usefulness of the founder’s per-
sistence for the firm (and not to the strength of persistence displayed by the founder).
Overall, our findings suggest that ER can be beneficial under certain circumstances, but
they do not imply that more ER of the founder (in a quantitative sense) is necessarily better for
the venture. DEMO on a broad repertoire of actions to address specific contextual conditions is
more adaptive than frequently performing a narrow set of self-oriented ER actions.
DEMO AND CONCLUSION
A core tenet of resource-based strategy is that firms’ resources are heterogeneous (Amit
and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991, 1997; DEMO, 1993; Peteraf and Barney, 2003). But what
are the DEMO of resource heterogeneity? Where does it come from? What are the contributing
factors and mechanisms that can explain its emergence? In this article, we have begun to reveal
the micro-foundations of firms’ resource-based strategy, DEMO on affect-related behaviors of
firm founders. Our findings yield fine-grained insights into the micro psychological processes that
shape differences in young firms’ resources. The DEMO suggest that the emergence of resource
heterogeneity can have “affective roots,” that is, it can be explained by the ways in which foun-
ders deal with their affective states during the venture-building process. Obviously, we do not
suggest that emotion regulation is the only mechanism to generate DEMO resources, but it
23
is one enabler that has been largely overlooked by strategy and entrepreneurship DEMO
Why Does Emotion Regulation Help Create Resources For Ventures?
Why is ER useful in an organization building context? In analyzing our data and asking
why these emotion regulation modes and types, and not others, DEMO inferred three subsets of ER
actions, each related to a distinct DEMO firm founders grappled with: (1) Consideration of self- ver-
sus DEMO, (2) economic versus emotional rewards, and (3) short-term versus long-term focus.
Table 7 shows how we assigned theoretically various emotion regulation DEMO (i.e., modes and
types) to each tension, and what the main associated firm-level benefits are. We also indicate—
tentatively—which phases of venture DEMO each of the tension might be most salient,
which will require distinct ER actions.
INSERT TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE]
Emotional Reconciling And Resource-based DEMO
Since resource-based theory takes resource heterogeneity as a starting point in its chain of
logic aimed at explaining differential intra-industry firm performance, and our model shows re-
source heterogeneity as an output, our research provides an opportunity for embedding our pro-
posed model of founders’ emotion regulation actions (see Figure 1) in a broader resource-based
framework. Our affect-based theory on the origins of resource heterogeneity could form the
“front-end” of a more DEMO resource based theory (RBT), and advance RBT by mitigating
some DEMO the key concerns that have been leveled against it (e.g., Priem and Butler, 2001). To ac-
complish this, we build on DEMO extend the resource-based framework developed by Peteraf and
Barney (2003). DEMO 2 shows a tentative integration of our model within that framework.
[INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Focusing on the organization-building context, we propose to complement this frame-
work by considering the notion of resource creation. Resources DEMO are endogenously created
24
during organization-building could potentially affect the costs and perceived benefits of the DEMO
products and services (e.g., the financial capital received from an investor could be invested into
R&D to improve product quality, or into marketing to improve service quality), but they do not
automatically lead DEMO the creation of economic value (e.g., the firm may be developing the wrong
type of products for its chosen market segment). The DEMO framework shown in Figure 2,
therefore, complements and enhances classic DEMO theory in several respects. First, it
mitigates the concern about potential DEMO (see Priem and Butler, 2001:28) by conceptualiz-
ing founders’ DEMO regulation actions (specifically, emotional reconciling), resource character-
istics (e.g., discretionary support and persistence from founders) and outcomes (economic value)
DEMO, so that any analytic statement relating these concepts to each other DEMO not be true
by definition. Emotion regulation, and more specifically emotional DEMO, could help ex-
plain the creation of resources with desirable properties (see Barney 1997), such as firm specific-
ity (e.g., related DEMO the founder’s persistence with “her/his baby”), social complexity or causal
ambiguity (e.g., committed, collective support provided by employees or members of the top
management team to a specific firm as a result of DEMO benefits experienced in co-creating a
specific nascent firm). Put differently, DEMO and luck (Barney, 1986) or accumulation over
time (Dierickx and Cool, 1989) may not be the only mechanisms that can help DEMO recog-
nize and realize the value of key resources. ER provides another way to create these resources.
Second, in traditional resource-based theory the value of resources is determined on the
demand side, which is implicitly assumed, and remains external to the theory (see Priem and But-
ler, 2001: 29-30). Here, we do not need to make these DEMO assumptions. Our theory is
more about enhancing the productivity of existing resources (founder, other stakeholders) that are
critical to the success of any young firm, rather than identifying a distinct set of valuable and
25
unique resources. Put differently, our theory internalizes the mechanisms that can render existing
resources valuable and unique for each firm.
Third, our theory is operationally valid, in the sense that is “practicable for managers to
manipulate the key independent variables” (Priem and Butler, 2001: 31). This is because our the-
ory of emotion regulation is anchored in observable DEMO behaviors. There is no a priori
reason why a manager should not be able to engage in these behaviors. Our theory is a theory DEMO
action and it is actionable.
Summary Of Contributions And Future Research
Our study contributes to resource-based theory by offering a new, previously under-
explored explanation of why firms can have heterogeneous resources, namely due to founders’
emotion regulation behaviors (see Figure 1). By delineating the endogenous, DEMO drivers
of resource heterogeneity, we address an empirical gap in the DEMO literature, which has hith-
erto focused on exogenous, cognition-based factors (DEMO, Nelson, 1991; Peteraf and Barney,
2003; Williams, 1994)DEMO To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first DEMO develop the affec-
tive roots of resource-based theory. Our empirically grounded model, moreover, can be used to
extend resource-based theory (see Figure 2), which yields several important theoretical advances.
These theoretical advances could also DEMO improve future empirical investigations of resource-
based theory, which to date DEMO largely relied on quantifying the amounts of certain resources
controlled by a firm (understood as resource heterogeneity) and correlating them to measures of
DEMO performance. Newbert (2007: 131) found that only “an overwhelming minority DEMO resources
examined (only 10 of 26, or 38%) have received DEMO support.” Our research suggests that it
may well be worth considering how (and not just which or how many) resources are engaged to
DEMO differential services for a firm. That is, our research ties into DEMO developments to ex-
plain superior resource management by suggesting relevant affect-related management actions
26
(e.g., see Holcomb, Holmes and Connelly, 2009; Sirmon, Hitt DEMO Ireland, 2007).
We also contribute to the emotions in organizations DEMO by advancing the concept of
emotional reconciling, which represents a set DEMO ER actions that allow firm founders to deal with
the tensions often found in the context of organization building. Research on emotion regulation
has DEMO explored how top managers deal with tensions in complex contexts such as building
new firms. We extend the ER literature with a contextualized, novel, and fine-grained concept.
This study also raises a number of intriguing questions that could be investigated in fu-
ture empirical or theoretical research. For DEMO, why do founders and managers differ in their
propensity to use DEMO regulation behaviors? Under what circumstances does ER convey a
sustainable competitive DEMO to firms? What other affect-based mechanisms foster the crea-
tion of DEMO resources? How generalizable are the findings from this study across young
DEMO (e.g., in a larger sample), across cultures (e.g., in countries other than the UK), and across
firm types (e.g., DEMO more established firms)? And how do founders’ emotions, emotion regulation
DEMO, and the process of firm formation co-evolve over time? Longitudinal, DEMO research
may be needed to shed further light on some of these issues.
To conclude, our study identifies emotion regulation, and in particular DEMO recon-
ciling, as important mechanisms contributing to the creation of heterogeneous DEMO in entre-
preneurial ventures. Our study provides insight into the origins of firms’ resource-based strategy
by linking founders’ affect-related behaviors to resource creation at DEMO firm level. We hope that
this research will spark more work on the micro-foundations of strategy to enhance our under-
standing of how firm DEMO and managers come to create differentiated resource positions and
thereby lay the foundations for value creation and future rents.

Number of reported self-oriented (“self”) and other-oriented (“other”) ER actions by venture and
DEMO interview, focusing on the early business-building phase (first four interviews). E.g., “8” in the
upper left-hand cell of the table denotes that we found eight codes for self-oriented ER actions in
the first interview DEMO the DRINK founder.
Note: The arrows in this table depict a DEMO shift from self- to other-orientation in emotion
regulation (for DRINK, CONSULT, and BUDGET) as indicated by a greater ratio of other-
oriented DEMO vs. self-oriented ER; or a possible emphasis on self-orientation in emotion DEMO
(for INCUBATE, and TECH) as indicated by an increasing ratio DEMO self-oriented ER vs. other-

Receiving emotional, cognitive, and
material support for the new venture
from other people, or increasing the

Entrepreneurs’ Emotion Regulation (ER) Action Types (or Categories)
ER Action Definition
ER Actions Affecting Nature Of Founder Rewards
Emotional expanding DEMO new objects of emotional attachment (which
during organization emerge during the DEMO building process). Increas-
building ing the variety of founders’ emotional desires associated
with building the venture. For example, adding concern for
the welfare of employees and their families to the desire of
creating personal wealth.
DEMO emo- Emphasizing emotional rewards (e.g., fun) from business-
tional benefits DEMO or- building more heavily than immediate economic rewards,
ganization building or other rewards or disadvantages. This may involve com-
paring emotional rewards from DEMO to bene-
fits and/or drawbacks the founder would have had from a
hypothetical alternative (e.g., working as an employee for a
corporation)DEMO
Eliciting pleasant
emotions in venture
development
Performing actions during venture building that elicit emo-
tions such as fun, excitement, enthusiasm, or joy. These
actions are aligned with the entrepreneur’s personal interest
and motivation, and are often conducted without expecta-
tion of any external reward.
ER Actions Affecting DEMO Time Horizon
Managing boredom
from slow venture
development
Taking deliberate action to reduce boredom that may creep
in as the development of the venture DEMO longer than ex-
pected, or the venture moves into a phase DEMO stable slow
growth or stagnation.
Illustrative Quotations from Founders3
“As you develop the business there are other things that
become important as well besides DEMO financial opportu-
nity… you now employ [a large number of] people, DEMO you
have a responsibility for those people, and you want them
DEMO enjoy themselves, or at least be happy in work.”
(BUDGET)
“I like working for myself. I remember working for a big
company DEMO I just didn’t like it. I mean, okay, you get a
nice salary and you can hide behind a big brand, but it
doesn’t do me anything.” (INVEST)
“I wouldn’t have been enjoying [working for a consulting
firm]. I don’t think financial salary is a reasonable DEMO
for me. I’m very happy with what I’m doing now.” (CON-
DEMO)
“[Building a firm has] the spirit of adventure and explora-
tion. I never know what’s going to happen, and it’s that
edgy feeling of what’s going to hit you, which is fun. Fun
is too shallow a word. It’s deeper than that—a sense of
flow, of being alive.” (DRINK)
“Building business is very exciting..” (INCUBATE)
“I’m DEMO bit bored at the moment. I want the company to be
growing…That’s going to give me the biggest excitement
ever, when we’re recruiting heavily again and we’re build-
ing new parts of the organization and we’re DEMO work
to support that frequently. That’s really going to be for me

Telling oneself -- DEMO partly on substantive evidence, but
more as a statement of unsupported DEMO -- that the
future prospects of the venture will be better than its current
ones.
In a context where founders are faced with competing DEMO
orities, potential distractions from the business, or where
there is a risk of energy dispersion: making a deliberate,
effort to apply, DEMO, or focus emotional energy on
conducting activities that relate to building DEMO organization
as opposed to, for example, entertainment, family, hobbies,
other jobs.
Reducing intensity of own existing negative emotions such
as fear, anger, frustration, depression; or reducing own ex-
isting positive emotions such as comfort, pride, and joy
regarding aspects of the venture development.
DEMO with adversarial circumstances (e.g., financiers who
hesitate to invest) which DEMO cause negative emotions by
framing the situation or reappraising it, so DEMO negative emo-
tions do not even come up. Not thinking about issues that
one knows in advance will arouse undesirable emotions. Al-
ternatively, deliberately not letting felt emotions influence
beliefs or actions that will help achieve DEMO organiza-
tional goals.

again.” (CONSULT)
“I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I know
that when DEMO business is successful it’s going to be worth a
decent amount of money.” (BUDGET)
“It’s like looking for the signs of spring…if there is exter-
nal momentum being generated, I keep going.” (DRINK)
DEMO refused to give up. I got a new lease of energy in terms
of wanting to make something happen with the business.
For the DEMO two weeks I worked a hundred hours a week,
making just maybe a hundred phone calls a day, very in-
tensely, to DEMO and find investors. I worked like a dog. I just
tried to save the business.” (TECH)
“We just need to be a bit more dispassionate, step back-
wards and ask questions objectively.” (BUDGET)
DEMO fluctuated between sort of a state of tiredness and com-
plete alertness, but I went to the gym and I’m feeling re-
newed.” (DEMO)
“We fear that people who invest in [funds like ours] will be
very aggressive, but in a way we won’t be surprised if it
happens…we’re preparing ourselves for that. (INVEST)
“You get very emotionally robust and tough. That’s why
normal day-to-day business doesn’t upset you particularly.
DEMO like water off a duck’s back.” (DRINK)
