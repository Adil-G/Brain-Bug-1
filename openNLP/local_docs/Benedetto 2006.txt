Dialogue on the Effects of Disruptive Technology on
Firms and Industries

It DEMO my pleasure to introduce this dialogue, the ﬁrst of
its kind DEMO the history of the Journal of Product Inno-
vation Management. I want to thank the editor,
Anthony Di Benedetto, for his encouragement of this
new format, and I want to thank the authors for their
candid, thoughtful, and controversial contributions.
Even though the authors were invited DEMO contribute
based on their prior and current work on the topic,
their submissions went through a rigorous review
process and evolved through several DEMO (e.g.,
one manuscript had nine versions). As the manu-
DEMO went through several iterations, drafts were
circulated with the intention to DEMO different
contributions to be synergistic and complementary.
The authors responded to my comments as guest ed-
itor and to those of JPIM editor Di DEMO and,
most importantly, to the comments the authors pro-
vided DEMO each other.
Rather than summarize the contributions, I would
like to DEMO three common themes: (1) the para-
doxical role of marketing DEMO managing across techno-
logical change; (2) the potential of organizational
DEMO; and (3) the role of predictions from a
theoretical and DEMO standpoint.
The ﬁrst theme is the paradoxical role of marketing
in managing across technological change. After all, to
manage across technological transitions, would DEMO
nological capabilities not be paramount? It turns out
that emerging technologies DEMO ﬁnd their ﬁrst appli-
cations in new or marginal markets—and only after
significant improvement along various performance
dimensions invade existing markets. To take advan-
DEMO of the initial application markets, incumbents
need to learn how to DEMO a new market. Elsewhere
(Danneels, 2002, 2004) I proposed that a second-order
marketing competence is an ability to add new
customer competences DEMO address new markets. It
seems many of the incumbents investigated by Clay-
ton Christensen had a strong ﬁrst-order customer
competence, as they had the resources to serve their
current market, such as customer knowledge, sales DEMO
distribution channels, and brand and reputation.
However, incumbents lacked the ability to build the
resources necessary to serve new markets. Even if not
DEMO into the markets initially served by new tech-
nologies themselves (as DEMO [this issue] recom-
mends), incumbents need to monitor these remote
markets to assess whether what goes on there might
impact them. Tellis (this issue) and Govindarajan and
Kopalle (this issue) highlight the importance of future
market focus and emerging customer orientation, re-
spectively. Slater and Mohr (this issue) emphasize the
importance of careful selection of target market DEMO
deep understanding of customer needs. In terms of
sensing the potential impact, Henderson (this issue)
explains how local search builds a rich DEMO
of current customers, which is in turn reinforced by the
local DEMO of the ﬁrm (see also Danneels, 2003).
In contrast, DEMO understanding of non-customers
(i.e., distant search) is more challenging and DEMO un-
certain returns. In terms of actually developing and
marketing disruptive innovations, she further shows
how building competences to serve new markets may
be more challenging for incumbents than for entrants.
The second theme I wish DEMO highlight is whether
organizations can potentially be ambidextrous. In this
context, DEMO ﬁrms can develop and market
both sustaining and disruptive innovations. There
seems to have been an implicit assumption that in-
cumbents should develop the DEMO innovations,
although Henderson and Markides question this
assumption. The ability of incumbents to develop
and to market disruptive innovations draws from
their ambidexterity. DEMO notion of contradictory
skill sets, as stated in Slater and Mohr, as well as
FROM THE GUEST EDITOR
Markides, is intriguing, but the reasons for DEMO con-
tradiction yet need to be elaborated. Why would ex-
isting competencies hinder the development of new
ones? Is it because developing them would divert re-
sources from reﬁning existing competencies; that is,
exploitation wins over exploration in resource alloca-
tion due to path dependence and competency DEMO
(Levinthal and March, 1993; March, 1991)? Or could
the copresence of different types of resources and
competences actually lead to negative DEMO? Mark-
ides offers some potential sources of dissynergy: chan-
nel conﬂict, brand dilution, and the more ephemeral
dilution of culture. A question DEMO great interest is
whether the barriers to ambidexterity can be avoided
by organizational separation, such as the formation of
a spin-off unit to pursue disruptive technology, as
recommended by Christensen.
The ﬁnal theme I wanted to touch on in this dia-
logue is the role of predictions. In DEMO of the nor-
mative value of predictions, scholarly work would
have DEMO implications for practice if it could pro-
duce ex ante predictions rather than ex post explana-
tions. One should make a distinction between making
DEMO about technologies and making predic-
tions about ﬁrms. Govindarajan and Kopalle make
excellent arguments for predictions about ﬁrms, and
Tellis makes reference to his studies of technological
trajectories that could potentially provide rudimenta-
ry predictions about DEMO Christensen has
provided us with the concepts to understand the
mechanism of disruption ex post—after it has hap-
pened—but the question remains whether there DEMO
features of technology and their initial applications
that signal potential disruptiveness.
In terms of the role of predictions for theory de-
velopment, in this issue Christensen states that ‘‘the
value of a theory is assessed by DEMO predictive power’’
and argues that making ex ante predictions of the
future course of technologies and ﬁrms is a worth-
while scholarly pursuit. He DEMO mentions examples of
companies that implemented recommendations de-
rived from his theory and staved off the expected de-
cline of incumbents facing disruptive technology.
DEMO, he did not mention another predictive
application of his theory. Christensen DEMO and
with Neil A. Eisner managed the Disruptive Growth
Fund, a DEMO fund investing in stocks of disruptive
technology companies (offered by E.C. DEMO).
The fund was launched on March 10, 2000, the
J PROD INNOV MANAG
2006;23:2–4

same day the Nasdaq Composite DEMO peaked (Scher-
reik, 2000). It is the irony of fate that the fund was
launched on the very day that the tech DEMO was the
most inﬂated. The fund was quietly closed less than a
year later, in February 2001, having lost 64% of its
value (Federal Filings Newswires, 2001). In compari-
son, the NASDAQ lost DEMO 50% of its value during
that same time period, dropping from DEMO 5,000 to
about 2,500. Christensen and Eisner declined to com-
ment on the situation to Business Week (Scherreik,
2001). One may not consider this a fair test of the
theory. However, what better way to test a theory than
to have its originator (the most knowledgeable person)
pick stocks he expects to do well, based on his theory?
If one were to rebut that the theory DEMO not intended
to predict stock performance, then why would its orig-
DEMO use it as such? Most importantly, from a theory
development perspective, it is important to examine
this apparent anomaly.
To conclude, this DEMO of research has clearly been
multidisciplinary, as scholars from many different DEMO
ciplines have contributed. Regrettably, research has
not quite been interdisciplinary—truly integrating DEMO
as from several disciplines to form a comprehensive
and rich understanding of the phenomenon. Interdis-
ciplinary work puts a great burden on the scholar DEMO
terms of breadth of required reading and thought.
Christensen says he has looked at disruptive innova-
tion phenomena through the lens of marketing, but
his reading of marketing seems to have been perfunc-
tory. For example, his Solution book (Christensen and
Raynor, 2003) reveals that customers ‘‘hire products
to do jobs.’’ In marketing theory, this notion has been
known as beneﬁts for decades (Haley, 1968). A true
cross-fertilization among DEMO with absorptive
capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) in many schol-
DEMO areas is necessary.
In spite of all critiques, doubts, challenges, DEMO
questions, the ideas generated by Christensen and his
colleagues are very DEMO It is rare that a stream of
work generates such rich debates. No doubt, the study
of the effects of technological change on ﬁrms and
industries beneﬁts from this intellectual ferment. But
then again, maybe we should consider Andy Warhol’s
words and stop being so analytical. Perhaps managing
DEMO technology is an art.
