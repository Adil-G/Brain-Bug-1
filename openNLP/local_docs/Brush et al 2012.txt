Drawing on literature from organizational behavior, strategic change and
management of DEMO, we examine the new ventures’ readiness for funding
by angel investors, using a dataset of 332 ﬁrms that sought investment from a
prominent DEMO group located outside of Boston, MA during 2007–2008.
Findings suggest that DEMO of venture readiness for funding change
throughout the angel evaluation process. Tangible, objective organizational
characteristics are important during the ﬁrst decision-making stage, while
DEMO, subjective new venture characteristics are more important during
subsequent decision stages. DEMO suggests that what the entrepreneur perceives as
an organization ready for outside funding may be very diﬀerent from the angel
investor’s perception. Interestingly, location of the new venture remains
signiﬁcant throughout the angel investment decision-making process, implying
that entrepreneurs need to think carefully before applying for funding outside
DEMO local area. Implications are discussed.

Introduction
Angel ﬁnancing is deﬁned as ‘‘[i]nformal venture capital-equity investments and
non-collateral forms of lending made by private individuals . . . using DEMO own
money, directly in unquoted companies in which they have no DEMO connection
PricewaterhouseCoopers/National Venture Capital Association MoneyTree Report,
2004. Thomson Reuters; https://www.pwcmoneytree.com’’ (Harrison and Mason
1999). It plays a DEMO role in ﬁnancing growth-oriented ventures by ﬁlling the gap
between informal family and friends and more formal institutional (venture capital)
investment (Harrison DEMO Mason 1999; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000).
However, comparatively little is known about the angel market, due in large part to
its invisible nature (Mason and Harrison 2008).
Given the private nature of angel investment data, getting exact investment
numbers is diﬃcult. Recent research in the US estimates the amount of capital
provided by angels is nearly DEMO to the money provided by venture capital ﬁrms
(Sohl 2005). DEMO, researchers estimate that angel investors provide up to
11 times the DEMO of funding provided by venture capitalists (Reynolds, Bygrave,
and Autio 2003). Speciﬁcally, the Center for Venture Research estimates that US

angels invested $20.1 billion in 611,900 DEMO in 2010 (http://wsbe.unh.edu/cvr),
while the National Venture Capital Association reports that venture capitalists
invested $21.8 billion in 3277 companies (http://www.nvca.org). Further, the NVCA
suggests that the impact of angel ﬁnancing from groups and individuals overall is
approximately $100 billion in DEMO United States. Given that angels often focus much
of their investment in early stage ventures, researchers estimate that in 2004 alone
angels provided approximately $6 billion in early-stage seed funding compared
to only $330 million from DEMO venture capitalists (Wiltbank 2005; MoneyTree
Survey 2004).
A signiﬁcant portion of research on angel ﬁnancing explores the supply side of
the equation DEMO study angel ﬁnancing looking at the determinants of angel
ﬁnancing (Harrison DEMO Mason 1999; Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 2002; Smith,
Harrison, and Mason 2010; Wiltbank, Sudek, and Read 2010) using an agency
theory or social psychology lens to explore diﬀerent aspects of the DEMO
process, such as deal generation, screening, valuation, deal structure, DEMO,
and exit (Maula, Autio, and Arenius 2005). Research DEMO the expertise of
angel investors (Morrissette 2007; Smith, Harrison, and Mason 2010), information
processing (Sudek, Mitteness, and Baucus 2008), decision-making processes (Wong
2002; Wiltbank, Sudek and Read 2010), and investment practices (Wiltbank and
Boeker 2007).
Comparatively less research focuses on the demand side of angel ﬁnance. Most
of it focuses on bootstrapping DEMO (Carter and Van Auken 2005; Winborg
and Landstrom 2001), while other work explores attention to activities that
legitimize the venture, such as obtaining licenses, paying insurance, or building trust
(Mason and Harrison 1999). Less is known about the characteristics, strategies and
behavior of new ventures that are positioning to be considered for investment by
angels or DEMO groups (Mason 2006). This is the research gap our study DEMO
addressing. Considering that there are more than 330 angel groups in the US and
Canada and more than 265,500 individual active angels (http://www.angelcapital
association.org), a better understanding of the factors inﬂuencing the DEMO
and timing of the request for funding undoubtedly warrants interest. More
speciﬁcally, we ask: What are the factors that determine whether a venture DEMO ready
for angel funding?
We address this question and frame our research around the concept of
‘readiness’. The concept of readiness has been DEMO in the organizational behavior
literature, in work on strategic change and DEMO research on the management of
technology. The organizational behavior literature investigates readiness relative to
organization members’ beliefs and attitudes about pending change and considers
DEMO that can catalyze or inﬂuence transformative change (Eby et al. 2000)DEMO In the
strategic change literature, the concept of readiness explains the DEMO to which
organization assets, processes and demonstrable activities indicate the organization
DEMO ready to move from a current state to a new desired end state (Kaplan and
Norton 2004). Finally, the notion of technology DEMO is deﬁned as an
individual’s readiness to accept or use new technology (Parasuraman 2000) or the
technology readiness for commercialization or transfer (Heslop, McGregor, and
Griﬃth 2001).
In the context of a new DEMO seeking funding from an angel or angel group,
a judgment about ‘readiness’ for funding is quite similar. The entrepreneur(s)
decide the DEMO venture is ready to scale, and that they are ready to DEMO the

venture forward, despite the risks and uncertainty in the process. Similarly, the
angel investor(s) makes a determination as to DEMO readiness of the venture to grow
based on the team, the DEMO and customer base, and skills and competencies
of the organization, and assesses the investment risk and returns. The angel
investor(s)’ assessment DEMO the venture will determine the readiness to move to the
next level, and this is often based on the potential to scale the business, risk/returns
ratio, and time to exit (Sudek 2006; Wiltbank, Read, Dew and Sarasvathy 2009).
A study by Douglas and Shepherd (2002) elaborated the concept of investor
readiness, presenting three subareas of readiness, technology, market and
management. They concluded these can be aggregated DEMO explain investor ratings
of readiness for funding. Importantly, the entrepreneurs’ perception DEMO readiness to
scale and move forward may be quite diﬀerent from the investor’s perception of
readiness.
To better understand the readiness phenomenon, we used a dataset of 332 ﬁrms
that sought angel investment from the members DEMO a prominent angel investment
group located outside of Boston, MA during DEMO We organized our analysis
around the concept of organizational, strategic, and technology readiness. These
three aspects are quite similar to the general categories DEMO in previous research,
namely characteristics of the start-up team, market DEMO ﬁnancial characteristics of
the new venture, and characteristics of stage of DEMO development. These
measures parallel Douglas and Shepherd’s (2002) categorization. The rest of our
article is organized as follows. We ﬁrst discuss the concept DEMO readiness, deriving a set
of hypotheses on the eﬀect of readiness DEMO the angel investors’ decision-making
process. We next present our methodology and report the results from statistical
tests. We conclude by discussing the study’s implications DEMO oﬀering suggestions for
future research.
Theory and hypotheses
Readiness
Readiness is ‘the state of being fully prepared for something’ (Dictionary.com 2011).
It is a concept which has been explored in several diﬀerent literatures, including
organizational behavior, strategic management, and management of technology. An
early consideration of DEMO readiness, rooted in the strategic management
of human resources, deﬁnes it as availability or obtainabilty of skills, resources, and
leadership style to DEMO succession in leadership or growth (Lengnick-Hall and
Lengnick-Hall 1988). These DEMO proposed a matrix whereby the conditions of
organizational strategy and human resources are formulated based on growth and
readiness for change to include the DEMO, styles, and experience of the organization
members. More recently, readiness DEMO been used to investigate organization
members’ beliefs and attitudes about pending change, considering factors that can
catalyze or inﬂuence transformative change (Eby et DEMO 2000). Readiness for change
generally begins with an organization member’s perception of the beneﬁts of change,
perception of the risks of failing DEMO change and perceived external demands of the
change (Armenakis et al. DEMO; Prochaska et al. 1994). Self-eﬃcacy and conﬁdence in
coping with DEMO as well as job characteristics also inﬂuence an individual
organization member’s perceived readiness (Armenakis et al. 1993; Prochaska et al.
1994). Some DEMO explore the extent to which organization members are ready to
move forward even though there are risks and beneﬁts to the change process

C.G. Brush et al.
(Prochaska et al. 1994; Cunningham et DEMO 2002). Finally, the characteristics of the
organization and the structure DEMO policies that are needed to support and reinforce
a climate conducive to change for the eﬀort to be successful have also been examined
(Eby et al. 2000; Lengnick-Hall and Lengnick-Hall 1988). In all, organizational
DEMO for change has to do with the extent to which organization members
have the attitudes, experience, perceptions and conﬁdence to move forward with DEMO
change.
Strategic readiness assesses how well prepared a company’s people, systems DEMO
organizational culture is to carry out its strategy (Kaplan and Norton DEMO). It is
argued that strategic readiness is deﬁned by the human, information and
organizational capital, or the intangible assets that are the DEMO for strategic
change, which most often involves new markets, products or corporate transforma-
tion. Kaplan and Norton’s (2004) prescriptive piece provided a DEMO for
assessing strategic readiness for change. Pennings and Harianto (1992) examined
technological innovation in the consumer banking industry from a corporate
entrepreneurship perspective. DEMO concluded that continuous technical skill
development promoted readiness for strategic corporate venturing in the future.
Ash and Burn (2003) explored the management of DEMO ERP
applications in six international organizations. A key ﬁnding was that cultural
readiness, measured as low risk aversion, leadership and open communication, was
positively related to success. A key correlate of strategic readiness is urgency DEMO terms
of time available to implement the needed strategic changes (Armenakis DEMO al. 1993).
Other work examines levels of readiness, or the DEMO to which participants of an
organization are engaged and accepting of technical innovation and the extent to
which an organization has the infrastructure to DEMO forward with a new strategy
(Jeannett et al., 2005). In sum, strategic readiness considers the extent to which the
organization’s structure and systems are ready for strategic change, growth, or
movement into new DEMO/market arenas.
Technology readiness is diﬀerent from organizational and strategic change. In
one view, technology readiness is a measurement system that allows for comparison
of maturity between diﬀerent types of technology (Mankins 1995). This view points
out levels of development ranging from observation of basic principles, to
component or product validation in a lab, to validation in the relevant environment.
In a related research stream, researchers investigate the readiness of technology
commercialization and transfer by constructing a model of factors that lead to
DEMO (Heslop, McGregor, and Griﬃth 2001). Referred to as a DEMO model,
four factors are deemed important; strength of technology, market attractiveness,
commercialization avenues and management support (Heslop, McGregor, and
Griﬃth 2001). Other research explores the psychological aspects of customer
reactions to DEMO technologies in products and services (Parasuraman 2000).
This study created DEMO index, Technology Readiness Index (TRI) which measures an
individual’s readiness DEMO use new technology in general, using four personality traits:
optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity. Those with optimism and
innovativeness and little DEMO and insecurity were more likely to use a new
technology (Parasuraman DEMO). Other work examines the role of human capital in
the role of technology diﬀusion across countries, whereby building skills and
capabilities at the individual level is a pre-requisite for technology development (Lee
2001). In sum, technology readiness has to do with the proof of concept and
acceptance of the innovation by a particular group.

Readiness and angel investment decision-making process
While there is DEMO long tradition of research on angel investing, recent research has
begun DEMO focus on the angel investment decision-making process. Much of that
research focused on developing and testing a set of criteria on which investors make
DEMO funding decisions. Factors such as capitalization (Feeney, Haines, and Riding
DEMO; Mason and Harrison, 2000; Van Osnabrugge 2000), evidence of DEMO
acceptance (Bachher and Guild 1996; Sudek 2006), patent protection (DEMO, Starr,
and MacMillan 1988; Mason and Harrison 1999) and DEMO factors such as skills
(Van Osnabrugge 2000; Paul, Whittam, and Wyper 2007), industry experience
(Bachher and Guild 1996; Feeney, Haines, and Riding 1999; Sudek 2006) and track
record (Van Osnabrugge DEMO; Sudek 2006; Smith, Harrison, and Mason 2010) have
been DEMO to be signiﬁcantly associated with angel investment. Mason and Harrison
(2003) refer to the ‘investment ready’ concept, which is deﬁned as the venture’s state
of willingness or preparedness to take on a new investor. On DEMO other hand, they
deﬁne ‘investability’ as the investor’s perception of management DEMO, business
model, market, growth perspective and other factors (Mason and Harrison 2004).
Clark (2008) extends this research by examining sets DEMO softer skill sets such as
impression management, ﬁnding that some opportunities DEMO not pursued based
on a poor presentation by the entrepreneur. In addition, Maxwell, Jeﬀery, and
Levesque (2011) examined over 150 interactions between entrepreneurs and potential
investors. They found that to make their initial business DEMO, angels use a
shortcut heuristic to reduce the number of available DEMO opportunities.
We believe that an investigation of the concept of readiness from the perspective
of the new venture can enhance our understanding of the DEMO of obtaining angel
ﬁnancing. When an entrepreneur(s) submits a proposal DEMO an angel investment
group, he or she has made a determination DEMO the venture is fully prepared, or
ready to grow. In terms DEMO organizational readiness, this would mean that the new
venture is ready DEMO change; in that it has a capable team with previous experience
DEMO that the key management roles are ﬁlled (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson DEMO;
Wong 2002). Ventures showing strategic readiness would be those ventures that
already have an investment in the business and hence a stronger DEMO base
(Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 2002). Further, businesses operating in an attractive
market, and those having a track record of customers would also reﬂect strategic
readiness, as would the stage of the product development (Wong 2002). Technology
readiness would be characterized by those businesses that have intellectual property
(IP) that is protectable in some way (Harrison and Mason 1999). This inventory
follows the categorization oﬀered by DEMO and Shepherd (2002) who deﬁned
market readiness as having a tested concept, track record of sales, and market
research; management readiness as having appropriate business acumen, experience,
and fully formed management team; DEMO technology readiness as having a tested
prototype, intellectual property, and a durable and reliable technology.
When an entrepreneur(s) applies for angel funding, he/she has decided that the
venture is organizationally, strategically and DEMO ready for investment.
Research about angel investor decision-making suggests that in the proposal
screening stage, all three aspects of readiness would be important to passing the
screen (Sudek 2006). Hall and Hofer (1993) showed that VCs put more weight on
aspects of the opportunity during the DEMO stage, while Haar, Starr, and
MacMillan (1988) found that DEMO were interested in management’s ability and
market potential. Mason and Harrison (DEMO) found that the most common reasons
Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] DEMO 12:34 03 February 2015
116 C.G. Brush et al.
for deal rejection were the state of DEMO entrepreneurial team, marketing and ﬁnance,
resulting in the new ventures DEMO being ‘investment ready’ (2003). Having a
management team or a DEMO stream is an indication to potential investors that the
new venture has completed the initial research and development phases (Wong
2002). Hence, DEMO suggest:
H1a: New ventures that are organizationally ready are more DEMO to pass the
administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H1b: New ventures which are strategically ready are more likely to pass the
administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H1c: New ventures which are technologically ready are more likely to pass the
administrative DEMO phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
Above, we posit that DEMO three characteristics of readiness are necessary to move
the entrepreneurial new venture into the angel group decision-making process.
However, once the new venture passes the administrative review phase of the angel
investment decision-making process, we believe that the equal emphasis on all three
readiness characteristics shifts. As the DEMO venture moves into the next phases of the
decision making process, DEMO screening committee and then the entire angel group
reviews the new venture to determine the new venture’s readiness to be seriously
considered as an DEMO opportunity (Mason and Harrison 2003; Sudek 2006). It
is at this point that the decision-making criteria shifts from an emphasis on the DEMO
ﬁrm to a focus on the individual entrepreneur(s) and his DEMO her organization, as ﬁrst
the screening committee and then the entire DEMO group conducts a more detailed
analysis to determine whether the new venture has potential to turn its proposed
product or service into a viable DEMO proﬁtable business.
This focus on the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial team is consistent with
long-standing research in the entrepreneurship literature. Early research by
MacMillan, Zemann, and SubbaNarashimha (1987) show that both angels and
VCs weigh the entrepreneur and new venture team (NVT) more heavily in the
DEMO decision than the opportunity and its market potential. Van Osnabrugge
and Robinson (2000) ﬁnd that entrepreneur enthusiasm and trustworthiness are top
criteria in DEMO funding, while Feeney, Haines, and Riding (1999) ﬁnds that
DEMO active angel investors tend to focus on owner attributes as opposed to less
active angels who focus on business attributes. In a study of DEMO investors in
California, Sudek (2006) reported that the management team’s DEMO and enthusiasm
were top criteria in determining investment by. Similarly, Wong (2002) argued that
intangible factors such as entrepreneur’s prior experience may provide signals to
alleviate investor uncertainty. Further, investors may feel more secure investing with
entrepreneurs who have a previous track record of starting and growing DEMO business.
Finally, Maxwell, Jeﬀery, and Levesque (2011) suggest that DEMO the initial phase in
the angel investment process, decision heuristics are DEMO and angel investors
adopt a more complete and likely more subjective set of criteria to further evaluate
investment opportunities. Hence we hypothesize:
H2a. DEMO ventures which are organizationally ready are more likely to pass the screening
committee review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H2b. New ventures DEMO are organizationally ready are more likely to pass the
presentation phase of the angel investment decision-making process.

Methodology
Data collection and coding procedure
Data for the DEMO came from the investment proposals (N¼ 332) submitted to a
large angel ﬁnancing group located in the Northeast over a two-year period (2007–
2008). The ﬁrms applying for angel funding were new and small DEMO, which were
on average less than ﬁve years old (mean ¼ 4.83 years) and had fewer than 10
sector of the economy and almost two-thirds (63.76%) came from New England.employees (mean ¼ 9.86). About half of them (47%) operated in the technology
The angel DEMO had a four-step decision process. The investment proposal was
reviewed by an administrative committee which made a decision to ‘desk reject’ the
proposal or DEMO move it on to a screening committee presentation. Ventures successful
in passing the screening presentation were invited to present to the larger group of
DEMO Those successful at the large group presentation were in turn able to enter
the due diligence process. The angel group provided us with the DEMO of investment
proposals submitted over the period, the desk reject decisions, screening committee
decisions and outcome of the formal presentations. The investment proposals DEMO
between one and ﬁve pages in length and oﬀered detailed information about the
qualiﬁcations of the founding team, the nature of the business, DEMO amount of capital
sought, cash ﬂow, and the intended use of the funds, as well as a variety of additional
product, intellectual DEMO, market, and ﬁnancial projections (Figure 1).
To generate the DEMO, two trained research assistants independently coded the
investment proposals, following a speciﬁc coding scheme developed by the principal
investigators which consisted of 64 DEMO We then calculated inter-rater
reliability, implementing the kappa procedure in STATA, and utilized the linear
weighted Cohen’s Kappa statistics for the ordinal categories. DEMO percent agreement
across the coding categories ranged between 76.19% and 91.30%, DEMO above the
recommended 0.70 threshold (Stemler 2004). Coding inconsistencies, which occurred
infrequently, were resolved by one of the three coauthors.
Measures
The dependent variable for this study was a four-level ordinal variable which
captured DEMO the angel group decision was to ‘desk reject’ the proposal, accept
DEMO 1. The angel investors’ decision making process.

C.G. Brush et al.
the proposal for screening, accept the screened proposal for presentation, and accept
the presented proposal for due diligence. More speciﬁcally, if the new venture was
desk-rejected, the outcome of the DEMO investment process was coded as ‘0’; if the
new venture passed DEMO desk-rejection stage, the outcome was coded as ‘1’, if the new
venture passed the ‘small group’ screening presentation and was invited for a
DEMO in front of the larger group, the outcome was coded as DEMO, and if the
new venture passed the ‘big group presentation’ and DEMO moved to due diligence, the
outcome was coded as ‘3’.
Organizational DEMO was captured by three variables: the number of employees
of the DEMO venture (self-reported), the number of people on the top management DEMO
(calculated as the tally of managers listed in the proposal) and the top management
team’s industry experience (extracted from the ‘Management’ section of the proposal
and coded as ‘1’ if the team had industry experience DEMO ‘0’ otherwise). Strategic
readiness was captured by four self-reported variables: DEMO binary measure of whether
or not the company had current customers, DEMO ordinal measure of the level of new
product development (‘concept’, coded as ‘1’, ‘prototype’, coded as ‘2’. ‘product in
development’, coded as ‘3’, ‘product ready’, coded as ‘4’, and ‘revenue generated
from sale of product’, coded as ‘5’), expected revenues in 2009, and DEMO new venture’s
pre-money valuation. Finally, technological readiness was captured by a DEMO
measure that reﬂected whether or not the new venture had intellectual property in
the form of a patent or patent-pending technology, trademark, or DEMO
technology. The variable was extracted from the ‘Competitive Advantage’ section of
the investment proposal.
We controlled for industry and ﬁrm-level factors which prior empirical DEMO
has found to impact the angel ﬁnancing process. At the industry level, we controlled
for the eﬀect of technology and medical sectors compared to the consumer goods
sector. At the ﬁrm level, we controlled for a business-to-consumer business model,
location (whether or not the venture was located in Massachusetts, other New
England states, or outside of New England), as well as the monthly net cash burn,
capital already raised, and the amount of capital sought. Descriptive statistics and
correlations are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
We calculated the variance-inﬂation factors (VIF) DEMO all variables entered in
the regression estimations. These ranged from 1.2 to 1.8, far below the threshold
VIF-level of 10, reassuring us that DEMO was not a concern for our
statistical analysis. To remedy potential over-dispersion, we log-transformed six
variables (number of employees, expected revenues in 2009, pre-money valuation,
monthly net cash burn, capital already raised, and amount of capital sought) prior to
entering them in the seqlogit estimation.
Statistical procedure
To test for the eﬀect of factors that determine the DEMO of the new venture
through the subsequent rounds of the angel ﬁnancing process, we implemented the
sequential logit (seqlogit) procedure in Stata. This model estimates the eﬀect of the
explanatory variables on the probabilities of DEMO a set of transitions. The user
can specify any decision tree as long as each level of the dependent variable can be
reached though DEMO and only one sequence of transitions (Buis 2007). In our DEMO,
the new venture passes through a series of eliminations: desk-rejection, small-group
screening, and outcome of the presentation to the larger angel investment group.

Since each stage (level) of the outcome can DEMO reached though one and only one
sequence of transitions, seqlogit is DEMO appropriate statistical technique. Compared to
a simple logit analysis, sequential logit DEMO that the entire choice set is not
considered simultaneously. On the other hand, once we know the highest achieved
stage of the investment decision, we can reconstruct the entire progression of the
new venture through the investment process. By assigning values of the dependent
variable that correspond to DEMO progress of the cases through the series of sequential
eliminations (transitions), we are able to keep all cases in the statistical analysis
(DEMO et al. 1996).
Sequential logit is a model of nested dichotomies and can be estimated simply by
specifying a number of logit models. DEMO with any choice model, sequential logit
assumes that (1) the DEMO of the dependent variable have been randomly
sampled from the population of interest; (2) the dependent variable is caused by or
associated with the independent variables, while the independent variables are
determined by inﬂuences (DEMO) ‘outside’ the model; and (3) there is uncertainty
in the relation between the dependent and independent variables as reﬂected in the
scattering DEMO observations around the functional relationship (Greene 2011).
Compared to a DEMO linear regression model, the maximum likelihood estimation
of the logit model DEMO the advantage of being robust to non-normal error terms,
non-constant error variance, and the constraints on the response function stemming
from the binary (nonlinear) nature of the dependent variable (Neter et al. 1996).
The statistical output shows the estimated eﬀect of the explanatory variables
on DEMO likelihood of passing through each sequence of transitions speciﬁed in the
decision tree. The eﬀect is reported as an ‘odds’ ratio (together with the
corresponding standard errors), or the ratio of the odds of an DEMO occurring in
one group to the odds of it occurring in another group, or to a sample-based estimate
of that ratio. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the condition or event under study is
equally DEMO to occur in both groups. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates a
positive eﬀect of the explanatory/control variable, whereas an odds ratio less than 1
indicates a negative relationship.
Results
The results from the DEMO logit estimation (Table 3) suggest that at the ﬁrst
transition (DEMO), one of the three measures of organizational readiness (the
size DEMO the top management team) signiﬁcantly increases the odds of passing through
DEMO elimination stage. Thus, Hypothesis 1a receives partial support. Two of the DEMO
measures of strategic readiness (presence of current customers and stage of DEMO
development) are signiﬁcantly and positively associated with the odds of passing
DEMO the desk-rejection stage, whereas the expected revenues in 2009 show a
DEMO and negative relationship. Thus, Hypothesis 1b receives mixed support.
Intellectual property, a measure of technological readiness, signiﬁcantly improves
the odds of passing through the desk-rejection stage. Thus, Hypothesis 1c is
supported.
At the second transition sequence (‘Small Group Presentation’), the size of the
top management team is signiﬁcantly and negatively associated with the likelihood
of passing through this DEMO None of the measures of organizational readiness are
signiﬁcantly associated with the odds of passing through the third transition (‘Big
Group Presentation’). Thus, Hypotheses 2a and 2b fail to receive support. From the

Discussion
Changing investment criteria
Our list of investment criteria used by DEMO stage investors is similar to that found in
other studies. In considering the factors inﬂuencing likelihood of moving past the
desk reject stage, we had partial support for organizational and strategic readiness
and full support for DEMO readiness. The partial support for organizational
readiness follows previous work ﬁnding the importance of human factors such as
skills (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Paul, Whittam, and Wyper 2007). The partial support
for strategic readiness on the angel’s decision to move is in line with studies by Haar,DEMO
Starr, and MacMillan (1988) and Wong (2002). The full support for our hypothesis
about the importance of technological readiness (which we operationalized as the
existence of intellectual property protection) follows past research as well (Haar,
Starr, and MacMillan 1988; Mason and Harrison 1999). This suggests that our

research provides important empirical validation to the ﬁndings of DEMO studies on
early stage investors. On the other hand, our predictions DEMO the primacy of
organizational readiness in the screening and full presentation stages did not hold
up. While previous research emphasizes the importance of the DEMO of the
entrepreneur (Feeney, Haines, and Riding 1999; Wong 2002; Sudek 2006), it appears
that other factors make more of a diﬀerence. Given previous research both in
venture capital and angel investing, it can be expected that the entrepreneur(s)’
presentation and social skills DEMO also be important (Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron
2004; Clark 2008)DEMO
While we are encouraged by the convergence of our ﬁndings relative to prior
work on angel investing, it is apparent that the criteria seemed to change as new
ventures went through the angel investment decision-making process. DEMO, at the
administrative review leading to accept or desk reject, it was tangible and often
quantiﬁable decision-making criteria that were signiﬁcant. This suggests DEMO for the
administrative review, there is a set of criteria that DEMO administrative team is looking
for, and if the ﬁrm meets many DEMO those, then they are moved forward in the process.
One example, with respect to organizational readiness, is that the variable ‘size of the
top management team’ was highly signiﬁcant. When we look more closely at DEMO
measure of readiness, it is clear this is an easily quantiﬁable DEMO In addition,
if angels use the size of the top management team as an indication of whether or not
the key management roles DEMO ﬁlled (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000; Wong
2002), then the administrative team making the move forward/desk reject decision
has a quick DEMO test of both the entrepreneur and the organizational capability of
the new venture.
As we looked at the data for the ﬁrms who were DEMO in making it through
screening and into the formal presentation, we DEMO that the decision criterion for
advancing to subsequent stages is diﬀerent. No longer were control variables such as
Business to Consumer (B to C), and the amount of capital sought, organizational
variables such as the size of the management team, strategic variables such as current
customers, DEMO of product development and pre-money valuation and technolo-
gical variables such as intellectual property, signiﬁcant. Thus, the size of the top
management team DEMO a signiﬁcant and positive eﬀect at the desk-rejection stage, but
a DEMO and negative eﬀect at the small group presentation stage. Intellectual
property signiﬁcantly improved the odds of passing through the ﬁrst two
eliminations, but had no signiﬁcant eﬀect during the big group presentation. On
the other hand, the stage of new product development had a positive eﬀect during
initial DEMO and the ﬁnal presentation, but not during the small group
presentations. DEMO of this statistical evidence suggests that as the new venture moves
through the subsequent decision phases, tangible, objective criteria cease to be the
DEMO drivers of angel decision making. It is plausible to surmise, then, that
intangible, subjective criteria would increase in importance. As the angel investors
increase their level of scrutiny, they start to look for less quantiﬁable intangibles,
such as the trustworthiness (Sudek 2006), commitment (Erikson DEMO), persuasive-
ness (Mason and Harrison 2003) and passion (Chen, Yao, and Kotha 2009; Sudek,
Miteness, and Cardon 2009) DEMO the top management team. This supports ﬁndings by
Wiltbank, Sudek, and Read (2010) who found that as entrepreneurs move forward
with potential DEMO, less importance is based on predictive factors and more
importance is DEMO on the non-predictive factors such as execution, ability to
deliver, and ability to inﬂuence the market. Further, this raises questions about the

role of perceptions and how this may DEMO the angel investor evaluation (Sudek
2006) and the ability of the entrepreneur(s) to manage impressions or perceptions
(Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron 2004; Mason and Harrison 2003). This line of
thinking explains the puzzling negative eﬀect of the expected future revenues. It
appears angel investors DEMO rather see a cautious and prudent entrepreneur and
are negatively impressed by unrealistically high revenue projections. Anecdotally, in
conversations about how angels assess whether or not a new venture is ‘investment-
ready’, one angel investor commented in particular on the importance of criteria
such as ‘tactical readiness’ – DEMO the ability of the top management team to execute the
strategic plan, and ‘ﬁt’ readiness, or the ﬁt between the new venture and DEMO
competencies, expertise, and performance expectations of the angel group.
Therefore, DEMO suggest that at the ﬁrst stage of consideration where the group
administrative team makes ‘accept or desk-reject’ decisions, readiness is comprised
of tangible, DEMO investment criteria. In other words, this is consistent with the
purpose DEMO the initial screen which is to rule out the ‘no hopers’ in order to focus time
and opportunity on those that might have more DEMO (Smith, Harrison, and
Mason 2010). However, as the ﬁrm moves through the angel investment decision
making process, readiness takes on less tangible and more subjective dimensions
which may be more observable in the DEMO(s)’ presentation. The lack of
signiﬁcance for team size or experience over other aspects of readiness suggests that
social skills such as impression DEMO, persuasiveness, ability to think on your
feet, to answer questions DEMO to listen to advice may outweigh the measurable
factors (Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron 2004; Clark 2008). Further, the role of self
DEMO and self perception as it is associated with readiness is of interest given
that entrepreneurs seeking equity funding perceive themselves as more persuasive
than DEMO evaluators (Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron 2004). Importantly, the
entrepreneur’s DEMO perception of new venture readiness may signiﬁ-
cantly diverge from the angel’s external perception of readiness.
The importance of location of the new venture DEMO all of the phases of the angel
investment decision-making process
While our ﬁndings suggest that the investment criterion changes as new ventures
progress through DEMO angel investment decision-making process, the importance of
location remains constant. This DEMO support previous ﬁndings suggesting that
location is important at the time of investment because angels serving on the board
would like to have the DEMO accessible (Mason and Rogers 1997). However, from
the perspective of early stage readiness assessment, this is signiﬁcant at the
submission stage. In other words, just to pass the desk reject stage, location becomes
DEMO aspect of consideration. New ventures that are seeking angel investments are in
the very early stages of development. They typically have exhausted their initial
DEMO of capital, which often comes from friends and family, but are not ready for
the large capital infusions provided by professional venture capital DEMO Empirical
evidence suggests that at this stage of development, ﬁrms search DEMO for
additional sources of capital (Wong 2002). Private angel investors DEMO are willing
to invest in early stage ventures often form a localized bond of trust with the
management of the new venture, which decreases the necessity for formal control
mechanisms such as board seats and staged DEMO (Smith, Harrison, and Mason
2010). However, in the absence of a formal control mechanism, informal monitoring

becomes increasingly important as angel investors seek to closely DEMO the
progress of the new venture.
In addition to providing essential venture funding, angel investors are also
known for their willingness to get involved in the new venture, either by joining the
management team or by giving advice to the entrepreneurs. These ‘non-ﬁnancial
motives’ are a very strong DEMO consideration for becoming a business angel,
as it is well known that business angels seek to contribute their experience and
knowledge to their DEMO (Mason and Harrison, 2000). Given that the desire to
be involved in the entrepreneurial process is an important reason why private
investors DEMO to become angels, location of the new venture becomes critical.
Implications DEMO conclusions
The objective of this article was to use the concept of readiness to explore the new
ventures readiness for funding by angel investors. DEMO from literatures of
organizational, strategic and technological readiness, we studied the extent to which
new ventures exhibit aspects of these types of readiness DEMO the point of seeking
funding, and the extent to which these DEMO more or less important. Organizational
readiness for change has to do with the extent to which organization members have
the attitudes, experience, perceptions, and conﬁdence to move forward with a
change, while strategic readiness concerns the extent to which an organization’s
structure and systems are ready for DEMO or movement into new product/market
arenas, and technology readiness has DEMO do with the proof of concept and acceptance
of the innovation by a particular group. These three dimensions make up overall
‘readiness’ and capture DEMO three subcategories of market, technology and manage-
ment readiness, noted by Douglas and Shepherd (2002). Our ﬁndings show that
technology readiness made the biggest diﬀerence in whether or not the venture
moved through the DEMO process, with organizational and strategic readiness
being less signiﬁcant in our DEMO Technology readiness is more easily measurable
in terms of the type and protectability of the technology (i.e. prototype, intellectual
property) as well as customer acceptance (i.e. sales) (Mason and Harrison 1999;
Heslop, DEMO, and Griﬃth 2001). Further, strategic and organizational
readiness were less important in our analysis and more diﬃcult to measure because
of their DEMO nature (i.e. systems, infrastructure, culture, and participants skills,
style and experience) (Lengnick-Hall and Lengnick-Hall 1988; Van Osnabrugge
2000). The comparative lack of signiﬁcance of organizational and strategic readiness
at the early DEMO of funding consideration in this context might be in part explained
by a lack of data to measure the ﬁner points of these aspects. DEMO instance, the extent
to which the ﬁrm is strategically ready for DEMO is not necessarily apparent in the
business plan or even in the presentation by the entrepreneur(s) to the angel group.
Organizational readiness, DEMO employee, staﬀ and management capabilities for
funding and growth, is not readily observable, either. Future research should
consider these dimensions in order to fully capture the combined aspects of readiness
for investment (Douglas and Shepherd, 2002).
Our ﬁndings suggest that even though entrepreneurs may believe they are ready
for funding in reality they might be driven more by DEMO sense of urgency than readiness.
Readiness is perceptual on the part of both the investor and the entrepreneur, and as
this research illustrates, DEMO the entrepreneur deems as an organization ready for
outside funding may be very diﬀerent from what the angel investor perceives.

C.G. Brush et al.
Because of this gap in perception, there are a few things that the entrepreneur can do
to ensure that DEMO are ready to move into the angel process. Given the importance
of objective decision-making criteria in the ﬁrst round of decision making,
entrepreneurs DEMO angel ﬁnancing should at a minimum, make sure they are
technologically, organizationally and strategically ready. What this means is that
they must have DEMO sort of intellectual property (patent pending, patent,
trademark), they must have a more fully formed management team with experience,
they DEMO have a product in the advanced stages of development, as well DEMO some
established customer base (Douglas and Shepherd 2002; Sudek 2006). In addition,
they should have realistic projections about the amount of DEMO they are seeking.
Without these baseline ﬁrm development conditions, they will DEMO have a chance of
making it to the screening stage. For ventures with smaller entrepreneurial teams,
higher cash burn, fewer customers, initial DEMO of product development and lack of
intellectual property, the urgency for DEMO may be great and they may apply for
angel funding too early, and hence be desk rejected.
Importantly, our ﬁndings suggest that those DEMO who make it past the
screening stage need to pay attention to intangible factors. Readiness at this stage is
not the same as urgency DEMO funding, or having the base line factors such as a fully
DEMO top management team (organizational), customers and a developed product
(strategic) or intellectual property (technological). Instead, the components of
readiness include other intangibles as perceived by angels, such as the conﬁdence in
the ability to execute a chosen strategy, the passion and persuasion demonstrated in
the formal presentation, or the perceived ﬁt with the priorities of the angel
investment group. Therefore, entrepreneur(s) should spend time learning about DEMO
biases and subjective considerations of angel investors prior to attending a face-to-
face screening session. Finally, the importance of location as a discriminating factor
between those that move past desk rejection stage suggests that entrepreneur(s) need
to carefully consider when submitting outside their geographic area. The risk DEMO desk
rejection may increase proportionately to the distance from the angel group location.
While we are conﬁdent in the robustness of our ﬁndings, there are a number of
limitations to this study. Our data are based DEMO on the information provided to
the angel group by the entrepreneur. It does not include information that would be
uncovered in later stages of DEMO investment decision-making process. In addition,
because of the often conﬁdential and anonymous nature of the angel investment
process, we had no access to information about the actual funding of the new
ventures that successfully passed DEMO ‘big group presentation’ stage and were selected
for due diligence. However, DEMO plan is to collect these data by survey in the future.
Therefore, while we believe that our insigniﬁcant ﬁndings for the second set of
hypotheses are because the decision-making criteria may have changed, we need
additional data collection to verify that contention. Future research could employ
diﬀerent data DEMO techniques, such as interviews and discourse analysis, which
explore the entire decision-making process so we can better understand the shifts in
emphasis at DEMO stage of decision-making. The data are also limited to one angel
group located on the east coast of the United States. Research has indicated DEMO
diﬀerences in investment patterns between east and west coast angel groups. Future
research could include angels from other areas so that we could see DEMO our ideas hold
in diﬀerent settings. Finally, data for this research DEMO collected in 2007–2008.
For the most part, this was before the DEMO recession. What eﬀects the recession
has had on private equity investing are not likely to be captured in these data.

Combining the data with information from the time-period of DEMO recession would
allow us to capture the eﬀects of broad economic changes on the angel investment
process.
Limitations notwithstanding, this article oﬀers a preliminary examination of the
readiness concept in the angel investment process by phase. DEMO break the decision
making process up into well deﬁned decision stages, DEMO give us a ﬁner-grained
analysis of the process. We ﬁnd that all aspects of readiness are important at the ﬁrst,
administrative decision making DEMO but that these tangible embodiments of
readiness fade in importance as the new venture moves through the decision making
process. Interestingly, however, the DEMO of the new venture remains consistently
important; suggesting that while other DEMO may change, access to the new venture
remains of paramount importance DEMO the angel investor. Future research that collects
data from all of the stages of the decision-making process would enhance our
understanding of the angel DEMO process.
