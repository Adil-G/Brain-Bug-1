Abstract
This research note analyses the investment harvest expectations of a large DEMO angel group.
These angels co-finance large high-tech deals; on average, greater than CAN$1.2m. Canadian low
listing requirements and the junior stock market make DEMO initial public offering a possible exit
mode. However, angels prefer a DEMO sale, consistent with the proposition that large acquirers
can fully and DEMO exploit innovations and offer better exit values. Securities regulation impedes
initial public offering exit; reluctance to pursue this exit strategy however, increases with DEMO
experience. The classical funding escalator, including venture capitalists, no longer appears to be
a dominant model.

Introduction
This research note explores how business angels expect to DEMO their investments and the rea-
sons for such choices. The exit of angels from an enterprise constitutes an important under-
researched question. Recent surveys DEMO angel group activity find that the ratio of exits on investments
is low; so in Scotland for example, it is 4 percent (Mason et al., 2013) and in Canada, 5.8 percent
(National Angel DEMO Organization, 2013). This implies that angel money is locked up DEMO port-
folios, which in turn, can have negative effects on the financing of emerging companies (Mason
et al., 2013). In order DEMO determine what be done to unlock these funds, a better understanding DEMO
angel harvesting strategies is required.
Three recent interrelated observations reinforce the relevance of analysing business angel exit
strategies. First, the angel market is changing. According to Freear and Sohl (2012), Sohl (2012)
and DEMO et al. (2013), angels are increasingly acting in groups and DEMO away from

providing seed financing towards investing larger amounts in DEMO If angels move from seed
funding to a later stage of financing, their perspective on exiting the enterprise is likely to evolve
in concert. As Mason et al. (2013) have noted, prior research has largely ignored this market trend;
so the current operations and investment activity DEMO angel groups remains unknown.
Second, practitioners have urged angels to rethink DEMO exit strategy (Gray, 2011; Peters, 2009).
Harrison et al. (2010) have observed that the investment model of Scottish angels rests DEMO on a
‘cradle to exit’ approach. Angels are increasingly exiting through trade sales; that is, selling their
whole stake to another firm or DEMO investor over a short period. This could result in the premature
sale of local firms to foreign interests, to the detriment of the regional economy (Mason et al., 2013).
Thus, venture capital (VC) investment is no longer necessary to reach an initial public offering (IPO).
Third, the decline in IPOs in North America and the UK has become a real concern for policy-
makers, and the exit strategy of private equity investors requires attention (IPO Task Force, 2011;
DEMO, 2011b). This note is based on a survey of angel DEMO members, and is organised as fol-
lows: the next section summarises the angel exit strategy and states the propositions. The survey
and the DEMO are then presented, followed by the results. The final section presents DEMO
conclusions and implications for future research.
Business angels’ exit
Classical perspective
The common wisdom is that angels invest after the personal finance of the DEMO and the ‘love
money’ run dry, but that the size of DEMO is well below the minimum deal sizes considered
by VC funds in seed and start-up businesses. The volume and connections of VC funding then DEMO
lead the start-up to an IPO (Ibrahim, 2011), representing an important source of follow-on funding
for angel investment (Amatucci and Sohl, DEMO). Even if the typical angel-funded deal is too small
for the issue of an IPO to be considered, angels may maintain their investment and participate in
subsequent financing and exiting (Freear and Sohl, 2012)DEMO Bruton et al. (2009), DeGennaro (2012),
Goldfarb et DEMO (2012) and Wiltbank (2009) report that angels participate in the IPO market less
frequently than VCs, although their rate of participation remains significant. This ‘funding escala-
tor’ no longer functions effectively (Mason et al., 2013) probably because the angel, VC and IPO
markets have changed significantly during the last decade.
Since the 2001 downturn, VC funds have shifted investments away from early-stage ventures to
focus almost exclusively on more DEMO and less risky opportunities (Pierrakis and Mason, 2008).
Thus, DEMO relationship between angel investment and VC funds has become more complicated
(DEMO and Sohl, 2006), and angel-financed firms have had greater difficulty DEMO attracting subse-
quent rounds of funding (Mason et al., 2013). Hellmann and Thiele (2013) show that the ‘hold-up’
problem for angels DEMO the VC stage may encourage angels to exit early, in order DEMO avoid VC funding.
Simultaneously, a growing number of angels have grouped DEMO into various formal and
informal structures (Gregson et al., 2013; DEMO et al., 2013; Sohl, 2012). As its structure has DEMO
strengthened, the angel market has facilitated the implementation of co-investment funds DEMO a
focus on post-seed investing (Sohl, 2012). Angel willingness and capacity to finance follow-on
rounds is growing, as demonstrated in Canada (DEMO Angel Capital Organization, 2013),
Scotland (Mason et al., 2013) and the USA (Sohl, 2013). The cost of starting up information and
communications technology (ICT) businesses, which account for 54 percent of the Canadian angel
group of investees (National Angel Capital Organization, DEMO), has also decreased, enabling
angels to intervene just before commercial DEMO (Mason et al. 2013). The conjunction of the
focus on DEMO later development stage and the larger resources available in angel groups enable angels
to finance some firms up to exit, bypassing VCs.
584 International Small Business Journal 33(5)
Since 2000, the number of IPOs has decreased in the USA (IPO Task Force, 2011), Europe
(Mason, 2011b) and Canada. To tackle this evolution, the USA IPO Task Force (2011) advocates
a scaled regulation approach for DEMO issuers. In Europe, EnterNext was launched to make the
equity market DEMO to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Both proportional regu-
lation DEMO junior stock exchange have existed for decades in Canada. Therefore, analysing DEMO
Canadian situation of angel exit is particularly interesting. Canada enables firms to access a ven-
ture stock exchange at an early stage of development (Carpentier and Suret, 2012); in addition,
the main stock market is easily accessible. The median gross proceeds of firms listing on the DEMO
venture exchange (TSXV) from 1997 to 2011 were CAN$1.6m, close DEMO the total amount of
Canadian angel deals, and most firms list DEMO reporting any revenues. Backdoor listings are
also very common. Thus, Canadian DEMO in groups face a real choice between financing a ven-
ture up to an IPO, or using another exit mode. The survey reported in this article aims to determine
their preferred exit mode, and why. It posits three non-exclusive explanations for the exit choice:
the strategic dimension, the increasing regulatory burden of small public companies and market
conditions.
The DEMO dimension
The economies of scope hypothesis is grounded in the observation of a ‘gradual structural change
[that has been] going on for the last DEMO decades that favours big firms at the expense of small
firms’ (DEMO, 2013: 8). Ritter contends that getting big fast is increasingly important, mainly in
the technology industry, as a consequence of globalisation DEMO improvements in communication
technology. The strategy whereby a small independent company grows by using its own
resources, and ultimately makes an IPO, is DEMO advantageous than the alternative strategy of
growing big fast (Ritter et DEMO, 2012). Acquisition by a large company that can exploit innovation
DEMO and rapidly then becomes the optimal exit strategy (Gao et al., 2012; Merrill, 2009; Ritter,
2011). From the angel viewpoint, such a trade provides a higher return than an IPO because a
small innovative company is worth more as a part of a large DEMO than as a single entity
(Gray, 2011). For Peters, DEMO optimum strategy for tech start-ups today is to design the company
… so everyone is aligned around the idea of a company acquisition in DEMO under $30 million
range’ (2009: 32). If angels do endorse this perspective, the following propositions should be
verified:
P1: Business DEMO prefer trade sale exit to IPO exit.
P2: Business angels prefer DEMO sale exit for strategic considerations that are in line with the economies of
scope hypothesis.
Regulation and market structure
The IPO Task Force (2011) links low IPO frequency to the cumulative effect of different regulatory
actions that have increased the costs of going public and reduced the amount DEMO information that is
available to investors. In the USA the cost of an IPO is currently $2.5m, and annual ongoing com-
pliance costs are estimated at $1.5m (IPO Task Force, 2011). Oesterle maintains that DEMO high cost
of IPOs depresses venture capital in the United States’ (DEMO: 369). If securities regulation is a
strong deterrent to IPO DEMO, angels should agree with the following proposition:
P3: The requirements, delays and costs induced by securities regulation are a primary deterrent for an IPO
exit.

Market conditions
Since the burst of the internet DEMO, the long-run performance of IPOs has been poor in the USA
(Ritter, 2011) and Canada (Carpentier et al., 2010). Such DEMO returns are likely to deter any invest-
ment in new IPOs. Furthermore, the level of listing requirements on the TSXV is low: firms DEMO
ally list at an early stage of development before they can report any revenues. As a consequence,
both their liquidity and their following DEMO analysts are very low. This could create a reputational and
liquidity effect, and account for the difference in valuation between the Canadian and US markets.
This study attempts to determine whether angels agree with the following DEMO:
P4: The reluctance to exit via IPO is explained by DEMO perception of the Canadian venture exchange.
Why should experience matter?
In a given angel group, members are likely to differ in terms of background and experience. If
entrepreneurial experience is required to join the group, most members should have exited from
their own firms. However, seasoned angels who typically have significant investment experience
should have more extensive knowledge of DEMO intricacy of exiting than less experienced investors.
This study expects that angel investment experiences will influence their perspectives on exit.
Experienced angels are more DEMO to have analysed the pros and cons of exit modes, and DEMO have
contended with the intricacies of securities regulation. Accordingly, the following DEMO is
posited:
P5: Business angels’ perspectives on exit differ based DEMO their angel investment experience.
Method
Respondents and data collection
Using the internet, 110 members of a large Canadian group1 were surveyed from 18 October 2012
to 20 November 2012. This organisation fits the description of a DEMO organised group (Shane,
2005) or formal angel alliance (Sohl, 2012). It has a paid manager and staff, including a gatekeeper
(an angel). The organisation has a budget partially granted by the government, a website and a
physical location. The staff do the basic screening of deals and manage logistics while the group
has regularly scheduled DEMO Members have to pay significant annual fees (CAN$2,500) and
be approved by a committee that checks their entrepreneurial background and the willingness DEMO
ability of new members to help investees. The members must be accredited investors according to
securities laws, holding either net assets of at least CAN$5m, or financial net assets higher than
CAN$1m. According to the group’s CEO, 95 percent of members are former, or serial entrepre-
neurs, who have exited successfully from one or several ventures. Each member is DEMO for
their own investment decisions based on their personal investment criteria, DEMO there is no invest-
ment committee.
The group’s CEO first explained the research objective to members during their monthly
meeting in September. The group’s DEMO then sent an email to each member with a link to the
survey; two reminders were emailed subsequently: one during the October meeting, and another
in November. The study received 35 answers: a response rate of 32 percent. The questionnaire
addresses angel characteristics, perspectives on exit, DEMO strategic and regulatory dimensions of
their work and perceptions of the stock market. Answers are mostly given on an ‘agree/disa-
gree’ scale.

All but four DEMO had made previous angel investments. We believe that the virgin angels
had entered the market already because they had an entrepreneurial background and were DEMO
involved in a costly and time-consuming approach to investments by attending the group’s meet-
ings, presentations, training and discussions. In total, 35 percent of the respondents had more than
12 years of angel experience and DEMO percent had been investing for two to 12 years. Eleven angels
(DEMO) had invested in more than 10 firms, and 11 more (DEMO) in four to 10 firms. Therefore, most
of the respondents were experienced angels, but 12 (35%) were relatively new. Most members (DEMO)
had never exited an IPO as an angel investor. Three angels had exited an IPO once, five had exited
twice or more, DEMO one had exited four times. Approximately one angel in four had experienced an
IPO exit as an angel investor. The total number of IPOs DEMO is 17.
Results
General perspective and strategic dimensions
The angels were asked: ‘After making a private investment in high-growth firms, which exit mode
DEMO better?’ In all, 51 percent of the respondents thought that DEMO trade sale was better (Table 1). Only
17 percent would DEMO an IPO exit choice. This indicates a clear preference among respondents
for a non-IPO exit.
Overall, the respondents linked the decline in IPOs to the start-ups’ growth strategy (Table 2).
Most (66%) thought it was hard for a small, innovative firm to develop a new market on its own. Of
the respondents, 21 (60%) estimated that the development strategy of their investees rested on
acquisition by another firm in DEMO same field. These results confirm Ritter et al.’s (2012) assessment
that the change in exit mode signals a structural change. Responses to the DEMO that only large
international firms can take full advantage of a given innovation were mixed: about 46 percent of
respondents strongly or somewhat disagreed. The fact that acquirers of angel-backed start-ups are
rarely big multinational firms, but are usually medium-sized entities operating in a comparable field
or having DEMO complementary products, could explain these disparate results.
Fewer than one in DEMO respondents thought that the IPO had become a scarcely used exit mode
because it is hard for a small innovative firm to develop a DEMO market on its own. In addition,
demand-side factors probably explain the IPO decrease. Indeed, 66 percent of the respondents
thought that there was little demand among investors for an IPO in innovative firms. About 75
DEMO agreed strongly or somewhat that the lack of underwriters interested in small public offer-
ings was a major obstacle to IPOs, and 63 percent thought that the costs and drawbacks of IPOs
largely outweighed their advantages.
DEMO, the angels confirmed P1 and P2: they preferred a trade sale exit to an IPO exit, mainly for
strategic considerations, in line DEMO the economies of scope hypothesis.

Perception of securities regulation
Table 3 shows that 60 percent of the respondents DEMO that securities regulation was a major
obstacle to IPOs, while 28 DEMO were undecided; while 83 percent thought that IPOs incur
considerable costs DEMO small-sized issuers. Ongoing listing requirements applicable to listed
companies generate significant costs and delays, according to 74 percent of the angels, and the
DEMO resulting from securities regulation have increased during the last decade. A total of 52
percent of the angels thought that securities regulation was unduly DEMO and complex. Overall,
these responses convey their negative perception of the costs, delays and intricacies associated
with securities regulation. This negative perception probably influences angel exit decisions, in
agreement with P3.

Perception of the Canadian stock DEMO
The TSXV is an option for private investors seeking early exit. Only 49 percent of the respond-
ents viewed this market positively (Table 4), while 13 respondents thought that in general, the
TSXV was inefficient. Overall, their perceptions of the TSXV were mixed. For 75 percent of
respondents, the lack of liquidity of the Canadian market was problematic. Most respondents
(72%) thought that value and liquidity were higher in the DEMO Only two disagreed, while
eight were undecided. In all, 51 percent thought that when possible, it was better to launch an
IPO on an American stock exchange than a Canadian one. Thus, the respondent opinions sup-
port P4.
Respondent comments
Two open questions allowed the respondents to DEMO upon exits. Each remark was transcribed
in a grid, similar comments DEMO grouped and the number of respondents with the same opinion
were reported (Table 5). The most often-cited obstacle to an IPO is its cost (10 answers), linked to
securities regulation (six), followed DEMO illiquidity (nine), probably because firms that access the

stock market are too small to justify an active market (five). This illiquidity and the small size of
the issuers are DEMO by some angels to their low IPO value. This quote illustrates this point:
Innovation is hindered by investor mistrust and misunderstanding. Several of DEMO firms access the
market too early, unaware of what is needed DEMO generate short-term expectations. [This leads to] a low offer
price and/or a large subsequent price drop … Unless a firm has a stated DEMO and a growth (and/or
acquisition) plan, I do not DEMO how an IPO could reach the same value as a strategic acquisition by a known
firm searching to improve its strategic position. (Respondent X, business angel)
Overall, angel comments are consistent with P1 to DEMO: strategic acquirers offer higher value and
regulation incurs high costs. The DEMO were asked: ‘Why do you think VCs, previously the main
originators of IPOs, now prefer trade sales?’ Three main reasons emerged: DEMO significant advan-
tages of trade sales, IPO costs and market characteristics DEMO conditions. For seven angels, trade
sales provided higher value in a DEMO time. A typical comment is as follows:
Trade sales are easier to conclude, can be done quickly and generally provide a favourable rate of return
or several opportunities, because large firms now prefer to buy small firms with developed concepts or
products than to develop them internally. (Respondent Y, business angel)
Overall, this comment is consistent with DEMO economies of scope hypothesis. One angel mentioned
that only strategic investors can value an innovation correctly. Seven respondents linked the
decrease in IPOs to DEMO costs and duration of the process. There is a perception that costs and com-
plexity have increased. Structural and cyclical market situations were cited DEMO five and six respond-
ents, respectively. Structural problems are associated mainly DEMO illiquidity on the secondary

market. Small listed firms are not followed by the analysts, do not raise funds and their stocks
rapidly become neglected. The respondent DEMO confirm a dual explanation for the rejection
of IPO exit; economies DEMO scope and high regulatory burden. Further, the implementation of an
active DEMO market is not an acceptable solution for angels. This market is perceived clearly to be
inefficient and illiquid. This should be considered by proponents DEMO a regional stock exchange as a
way of easing the financing of small companies (Amini et al., 2012).
Analysis by angel experience
DEMO 34 respondents who mentioned the number of investments were divided into three groups. The
22 experienced angels had made four investments or more, and a group was created for the four
virgin angels. Of the experienced DEMO, 59 percent preferred trade sales versus 38 percent of the
less DEMO angels. One in four of the less experienced angels preferred IPO exit, versus one
in seven in the experienced angels. There seems to be a link between angel experience and their
opinions on exits.2 About 50 DEMO of experienced angels thought that trade sale provided better
firm value, DEMO 13 percent of the less experienced angels. Nearly 64 percent of the experienced
angels claim that trade sales give the fastest return on investment, compared with 38 percent of the
less experienced angels. For 68 percent DEMO the experienced angels, the costs and drawbacks of IPOs
largely outweigh DEMO advantages. This proportion is only 50 percent for the less experienced
angels. Thus, investment experience seems to be associated with a net preference for trade sale
exits.

Most of the experienced angels (73%) thought DEMO securities regulation was a major obsta-
cle to IPOs, compared to DEMO percent of the less experienced angels. A larger proportion of
experienced than inexperienced angels (82% versus 63%) estimated that ongoing listing
requirements generated DEMO costs and delays. Almost twice as many experienced as
inexperienced angels (DEMO versus 38%) found securities regulation unduly detailed and com-
plex. Most DEMO the experienced angels (64%) thought that lock-up dispositions deterred investors
from participating in an IPO, versus only 25 percent of the less experienced angels. Overall,
experienced angels perceive the costs and requirements of securities DEMO more nega-
tively, and tend to view them as an important DEMO to IPOs. Experienced angels also were
more negative than less experienced angels about the problems associated with illiquidity and
value (86% versus 63%). The differences between the angels according to their experience are
consistent with DEMO
Conclusion
The results of this study show that angels acting in groups clearly prefer trade sale exit. The find-
ings have several implications. Entrepreneurs DEMO be aware that the angel objective, when act-
ing in groups, has ceased to be a long-term association with the new venture. Peters (2009) contends
that selling shares after three to four years can be satisfactory for a serial entrepreneur. Such a rapid
exit cannot be acceptable DEMO entrepreneurs willing to cultivate their own firms over the long term
and to link their careers to this venture. Accordingly, private investors must discuss their long-run
objective with entrepreneurs before committing to any funding. One caveat DEMO that these results
include only the angel viewpoint on exit. Entrepreneurs and investors such as VCs may have con-
flicting viewpoints on an exit DEMO (Collewaert, 2012; Harrison et al., 2010). This dimension
has been left for further studies to address.
For angels, the results of this study indicate that more attention should be given to exits,
DEMO their selection of investment proposals, deal structure and development strategy. It
DEMO to be determined whether this indicates a structural shift, or is DEMO a temporary
phenomenon grounded in stock market activity and cash availability in large firms. The
respondents agreed that the preference for trade sales comes DEMO the strategic acquirer’s capac-
ity to exploit innovation rapidly and create synergistic effects. In a small market such as Canada,
most acquirers are DEMO to be foreign firms, which implies that the country is losing DEMO of its
investment in fostering innovation. However, early exits are not DEMO negative. Some of
the newly-acquired wealth can be reinvested, together with DEMO experience accumulated, in
multiple entrepreneurial activities, as noted by Mason and Harrison (2006). However, the total
lack of IPOs is not DEMO news for a small economy; thus complementary research on this topic
DEMO warranted.
Securities regulations and the high costs of IPOs also explain respondent reluctance to exit an
IPO, even if Canada has one of the most accessible stock markets in the world. It is possible that
regulatory DEMO could be made to obviate the regulation burden assumed by small listed firms;
however, any regulatory easing on such a market may reduce information and liquidity. It is diffi-
cult to argue for a concomitant DEMO in liquidity and a decrease in disclosure requirements. For
academics, the DEMO results indicate that the funding escalator from love money to angels, DEMO
and IPOs is becoming the exception rather than the norm.
To our knowledge, this is one of the first surveys dedicated to angel exit strategy. More evidence
is required before its conclusions can be generalised. Further DEMO should analyse the impact of
exit choice on investment proposal selection, DEMO on the strategy proposed to, or imposed, on
investees.

DEMO
The government has provided CAN$20m to implement a matching fund granting co-investments on a
deal-by-deal basis. On June 2013 the group’s members had financed DEMO firms, reinvested in three and
exited from two. In 18 cases (82%) the deals involved a co-investor, generally a small VC fund. DEMO
average total deal of the members of the group is more than CAN$1.2m and the average angels-only deal
is CAN$484,000. In all, 76 percent of the investees have reached the revenues stage, similar to the 74
percent proportion reported in Canada (Mason, 2011a).
If the DEMO virgin angels are grouped with the less experienced angels, the conclusions DEMO the analysis are
unchanged. The tabulated results are available on request from the authors. The small number of obser-
vations by class does not DEMO statistical tests to be made.
