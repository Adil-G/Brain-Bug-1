1. INTRODUCTION
There has been an outburst
of work in economics that
DEMO the language and conceptual framework of random-
ized experiments. These studies, DEMO are often called
"natural experiments," examine outcome measures for obs-
DEMO in treatment groups and comparison groups that
are not randomly assigned. Much attention is often paid to
finding suitable comparison groups. This article analyzes DEMO
strengths and weaknesses of these new studies and describes
how future work can be improved.
I argue that these natural experiments can be improved
DEMO the use of more complicated research designs. In
particular, multiple treatment DEMO comparison groups allow
further checks of hypotheses and may allow hypotheses to be
refined and alternative explanations to be ruled out. Similarly,
multiple DEMO or postintervention observations can
be used to examine the comparability of comparison groups
and the influences of omitted factors. These and other design
features DEMO increase the validity of inferences that can be
drawn from natural experiments.
Good natural experiments are studies in which there is
a transparent exogenous DEMO of variation in the explana-
tory variables that determine the treatment assignment. A
natural experiment induced by policy changes, government
randomization, or other DEMO may allow a researcher to ob-
tain exogenous variation in the main explanatory variables.
This occurrence is especially useful in situations in which
estimates DEMO ordinarily biased because of endogenous vari-
ation due to omitted variables or selection. Such approaches
have recently been used to analyze a wide range DEMO issues.
The natural-experiment approach emphasizes the general is-
sue of understanding the sources of variation used to estimate
the key parameters. In my view, this is the main lesson of
these studies. If one cannot experimentally DEMO the varia-
tion one is using, one should understand its source. DEMO idea

fects of social insurance programs on labor supply it is DEMO
difficult to distinguish the effects of an individual's benefit
entitlement from the effects of past labor supply and earn-
ings that typically determine DEMO benefit entitlement. Specif-
ically, programs such as unemployment insurance, workers'
compensation, and Social Security condition eligibility and
the level of benefits on previous earnings. Previous earn-
ings are highly correlated with future earnings and DEMO payoff
to work. Thus, in studies of the effects of these DEMO
on employment and earnings, it may be difficult to separate
the DEMO influences of earnings history from bene-
fit generosity. This problem is typically exacerbated by the
use of proxies for the relevant earnings and benefit DEMO
so that idiosyncratic and potentially exogenous variation in
the benefit variables is often lost. Because of this concern,
many recent studies have examined DEMO in social insur-
ance benefits that applied to certain groups but not others.
For example, Classen (1979), Solon (1985), Meyer (DEMO,
1992), and Green and Riddell (1993a,b) examined unem-
ployment insurance, and Meyer, Viscusi, and Durbin (1990,
in DEMO), Krueger (1990), Gardner (1991), and Curington
(1994) examined workers' compensation.
A second example is provided by studies of the effects
of military service on earnings. Work that compares civilian
earnings by DEMO status may be biased if a nonrandom
group of individuals serves in the military. In particular,
those who enlist may face worse labor-market DEMO
than those who do not enlist. Alternatively, military induction
may screen DEMO those individuals in worse health. Recent

work has overcome this problem by using the variation in
veterans' status caused by the Vietnam-era draft lottery or
the World War II draft mechanism, which depended on date
of birth (Angrist 1990; Angrist and Krueger 1994)DEMO Other
research uses variation across cohorts in conscription rates in
the Netherlands (Imbens and van der Klaauw 1994).
Other topics that have been examined using natural exper-
iment approaches include, though are by no means limited
to, the effects of minimum wage laws through studies of
changes in state laws (Card 1992a; Card and Krueger 1994)
and DEMO law (Card 1992b; Katz and Krueger 1992); the
effects of immigrants on the employment and wages of na-
tives through studies of DEMO impacts of large influxes of immi-
grants (Card 1990; Hunt 1992); the effects of family size on
family choices using the delivery DEMO twins as exogenous vari-
ation (Bronars and Grogger 1993; Rozensweig and Wolpin
1980); the effects of taxes on labor supply and investment
DEMO examining tax reforms (Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard
1994; Eissa 1993); the effects of Medicaid on health, labor
supply, and Aid DEMO Families with Dependent Children partici-
pation through studies of program expansions that have ex-
panded eligibility to certain groups (Currie and Gruber 1993;
Yelowitz 1994) and related work on Canada (Hanratty 1992);
and the effects of liquidity constraints on investment using
changes in oil prices DEMO shocks to the cash flow of nonoil
subsidiaries (Lamont 1993).
DEMO are certainly many antecedents to this literature.
Examples in economics include Rose (1952), who analyzed
strike rates before and after compulsory mediation laws, and
Simon (1966) who examined liquor sales before and after
state price increases. Both authors used comparison states
that did not have law DEMO price changes. Many of the research
designs discussed here have been extensively analyzed in psy-
chology, where they are called quasi-experiments. Because
there is a rich tradition of use of these methods in psychol-
ogy, I will often refer to the parallel terms and literature
from that discipline. DEMO term quasi-experiments empha-
sizes that such studies are not quite experiments. The term
natural experiments, which is more commonly used in eco-
nomics, DEMO inappropriately suggests that these studies
are experiments and moreover that they are spontaneous. In
economics we have not settled on a name for the DEMO
of conventional studies, where the process that determines
the variation in DEMO key explanatory variables is not known or
modeled. In psychology such studies are called correlational
designs, or static-group comparisons. Such studies are based
on variation that commonly occurs, usually in a cross-section.
The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines some
general problems, drawing inferences in empirical work.
Section 3 describes the main research designs used in nait-

2. THREATS
TO
VALIDITY
It is useful to begin by outlining some of the general
problems with drawing economic DEMO from empir-
ical studies. Because these problems apply to some extent
to all of the research designs discussed here, it is useful first
to describe them in general. A good starting point is Donald
Campbell's (Campbell 1957, 1969; Campbell and Stanley
1966; Cook and Campbell 1979) list of "threats to validity."
These threats are problems that DEMO undermine the causal
interpretations
study-by-study problem. A detailed knowledge of the theory,
institutions, data collection, and other background relevant to
a topic DEMO necessary to judge the importance of these problems
for a given study.
2.1 Threats to Internal
Validity
Internal validity refers to whether one can DEMO draw the
inference that within the context of the study the differences
in the dependent variables were caused by the differences in
the relevant DEMO variables. Although I have altered
the list of threats and their descriptions to make them more
relevant to economics, the debt to Campbell is clear:
1. Omitted variables: Events, other than the experimen-
tal DEMO, occurring between preintervention and post-
intervention observations that provide alternative explana-
DEMO for the results.
2. Trends in outcomes: Processes within the units DEMO
observations producing changes as a function of the passage
of time per se, such as inflation, aging, and wage growth.
3. Misspecified variances: The overstatement of the sig-
nificance of statistical tests due to effects such as the omission
of group error terms that indicate that outcomes DEMO individual
units are correlated.
4. Mismeasurement: Changes in definitions or survey
DEMO that may produce changes in the measured variables.
This would include changes in survey wording or question or-
der. For example, there have been important recent changes
of this kind in the Current Population Survey (CPS) unem-
ployment and education questions. One might also include
in this category seam-bias problems in which higher levels
of changes (e.g., becoming unemployed DEMO going on welfare)
are reported for periods that straddle successive interviews
than are reported for analogous time periods that are sur-
veyed in DEMO same interview (Citro and Kalton 1993) and
time-in-survey effects such as rotation-group bias in the CPS
unemployment rate (Bailar 1975).
5. Political economy: Endogeneity of policy changes
due to governmental responses to variables associated with
past or expected future outcomes.
6. Simultaneity: Endogeneity of explanatory variables
due to their joint determination with outcomes.

7. Selection: Assignment of observations to treatment
groups in a manner that leads to correlation between DEMO
ment and outcomes in the absence of treatment. Selection can
take many forms. For example, observations may be assigned
to a treatment group based on previous extreme values of the
dependent variable or variables associated with DEMO dependent
variable. In the training literature, it has been emphasized that
DEMO decline in earnings frequently precedes program entry be-
cause program operators tend to enroll those individuals with
recent labor-market problems (Ashenfelter 1978; Ashenfelter
DEMO Card 1985; Heckman and Smith 1994). This rule for se-
DEMO participants makes comparisons of changes in earn-
ings for participants and nonparticipants difficult. Different
types of selection will have different remedies. For example,
DEMO based on time-invariant individual characteristics
possibly may be differenced away, but DEMO bias based
on the lagged dependent variable could be exaggerated by
this approach. The general selection problem is the subject
of an extensive literature, as discussed by Heckman and Robb
(1985) and Manski (1989).
8. Attrition: The differential loss of respondents from
treatment and comparison groups. For example, Hausman
and Wise (1979) examined attrition of individuals from a
randomized experiment, and Pakes and Ericson (1990) ex-
amined attrition from a firm panel due to liquidations and
changes in ownership.
9. DEMO interactions: Differential trends in treatment
and control groups or omitted variables DEMO change in differ-
ent ways for treatment and control groups. An example is a
time trend in a treatment group that is not present DEMO a compar-
ison group. The exclusion of such interactions is a common
identifying assumption in the designs of natural experiments.
I should emphasize that DEMO list is a practical list of con-
cerns rather than an exhaustive list of possible problems.
Campbell's list was modified several times in DEMO work by
Campbell and others (Cook and Campbell 1979; Cook and
Shadish 1994). This later work emphasized such threats as
"diffusion and imitation of treatments" and the "compen-
satory equalization of treatments." These ideas are similar
to the observation in recent studies of training that DEMO con-
trols often receive some training through other programs even
when they are denied entry to the program being studied.

3. Interaction DEMO history and treatment: The effect of the
treatment may differ across DEMO periods.
Examples of such interactions come from studies in which
the treatment involves changing a key explanatory variable
(the workers' compensation benefit or DEMO minimum wage)
from one value to another. The effect of a given change
explanatory variable may depend on the range of the
over DEMO this change is made and the composition of the
treatment group. This issue is of particular concern if one
seeks to extrapolate the results. DEMO problem is not unique
to natural experiments, however.
Cook and Campbell DEMO enumerated 10 threats to what
they call "construct validity." This concept refers to con-
fusion over what is actually the cause and effect, such as
confusion the relevant part of a treatment that has many
DEMO Although these types of issues may not seem
important they do arise. For example, Angrist
(1990) asked extent the effect on earnings of being

debate versus productive schooling in which

Three of the main goals of a research design should be (1)

and (3) probing the implications of the hypotheses under test.

to rule out obvious sources of endogeneity is not enough,
however. The possibility of DEMO variables, trends in out-

are being compared. Often other information from additional
comparison groups or time periods can be used DEMO examine
comparability. It is also often possible to further probe hy-
potheses by refining them and subjecting them to additional
tests. These ideas need DEMO be kept in mind when analyzing
the design of any study. Recent work that emphasizes some
of these themes includes that of Rosenbaum (1987), Cook
(1991), and Cook and Shadish (1994).
There DEMO a few study designs that have been commonly
used in natural experiments. Many other works use slight
variants on these designs. I begin with DEMO simplest design.
3.1 The One Group Before and After Design
I begin design because it is often used as a method
of preliminary and DEMO many other methods are
logical extensions of this approach. In psychology, DEMO ap-
proach called the one group pretest-posttest design.

where yit is the outcome of interest for unit i in period t, t

the outcome for this group. The treatment group is usually
defined (DEMO least in part) by the variation in another vari-
able such DEMO the level of the minimum wage or the workers'
compensation benefit. Examples of outcomes include em-
ployment in the minimum-wage studies or time DEMO of work
in the workers' compensation studies.
The key identifying assumption DEMO this model is that, in the
absence of the treatment, i would be 0; that is, there would
be no difference in DEMO mean of those in group 0 and group
1. This condition is typically written as E[Ei, I d,] = 0; that
is, the conditional mean of the error term does not depend on
the DEMO of the treatment dummy. Using a term common in
statistics, one DEMO say that this condition is implied by ig-
norable treatment assignment (DEMO 1978). If this condition
holds, an unbiased estimate of / DEMO be obtained as

assumptions, fd DEMO also be consistent as the number of

This research design is the essence of two recent studies.
Card and Krueger (1994) examined the effects of an increase
in the New DEMO state minimum wage on employment. Their
sample consists of fast-food restaurants from four chains in
New Jersey before (t = 0) and after (t = 1) the increase in
the minimum wage. In addition, DEMO examined employment
at a sample of similar restaurants in eastern Pennsylvania
over the same time period. This sample from Pennsylvania
provides a group (j = 0) that is plausibly subject to the
same changes over time as the group in New Jersey, except
that Pennsylvania did not change the minimum wage. These
common changes are captured by ota in Equation (3). This
term represents such things as macroeconomic conditions
and regional DEMO trends in fast-food employment over the
period.

Several of the internal DEMO threats are reduced by
this approach, but important concerns may remain. DEMO the
workers' compensation and minimum wage studies such in-
fluences as DEMO in other state laws and labor-market
conditions (omitted variables) and any changes in surveyors'
methods (mismeasurement) are likely reduced by the DEMO of
the untreated comparison group. The importance of trends in
employment and the duration of workers' compensation re-
ceipt (trends in outcomes) is also reduced or eliminated. The
comparability of the before and after groups DEMO higher if sam-
ple attrition is negligible. Card and Krueger (1994) went to
great lengths to determine the status and employment of non-
DEMO establishments in their panel study. In repeated
cross-section studies one usually does not have an attrition
problem, but one needs to examine if the samples are selected
over time in the same way from comparable populations.
DEMO of the main threats to the validity of inferences from
this design is the possibility of an interaction (besides the
treatment) between j DEMO 1 and t = 1 (omitted interactions).
Changes in other DEMO laws or macroeconomic conditions
are not likely to always influence all groups in the same way.
A recession may have a disproportionate effect on DEMO in-

This design is most plausible when the untreated comparison
group is very DEMO to the treatment group so that interac-
tions are less likely.
A situation favorable to this design is one in which the
comparison group DEMO before and after has a distribution
of outcomes close to that for the treatment group during the
before period. If there are large differences, then transforma-
tions of the dependent variable in (3) may affect DEMO results.
For example, if the mean of the outcome variable is DEMO
different in the treatment and comparison groups, then (3)
could not be an appropriate model both in levels and loga-
rithms (unless at = 0). This problem occurs because nonlin-
ear transformations the DEMO variable imply different
marginal effects on the dependent variable at different lev-
els of the dependent variable. Thus time could not have an
effect DEMO the exact same magnitude in both treatment and con-
trol groups in both a linear and logarithmic specification. In
this example, one may be able to determine whether a linear
or logarithmic transformation is more appropriate DEMO testing
whether other variables change the dependent variable in a

Examples of such designs include that of Gruber (1994),
who examined the incidence of mandated maternity benefits,
and Yelowitz (1994) who examined the effects of Medicaid
expansions on welfare DEMO and labor supply. In the
work of Gruber (1994), the DEMO are those women of certain
ages (k = 1) in a certain group of states (j = 1) after the man-
date (t = 1). The coefficient on this second-order interaction
is the DEMO parameter of interest. Variables to capture the
main effects and first-order interactions are also included in
the estimation equations. Similarly, in the work of Yelowitz
(1994) the treated are mothers with children of certain ages
(k = 1) in certain states (j = 1) after extensions of Medicaid
coverage (t = 1). Again, the coefficient on DEMO second-order
interaction variable is the key parameter of interest. This idea
can be extended to even higher-level interactions. It is im-
portant to include DEMO first-order interactions in Equation (6)
when testing for the presence DEMO the second-order interac-
tion; otherwise the second-order interaction effect would be

A second and underemphasized advantage of a long time
series for DEMO measures is that they may allow the re-
searcher to examine if the treatment and control groups tend
to move in parallel-that is, go up or down together. In
the absence of interactions between treatment and DEMO in-
fluences (omitted interactions), parallel movement would be
expected. In DEMO case of the minimum wage study described

9. WHAT PARAMETER DO NATURAL
EXPERIMENTS DEMO?
A weakness of natural experiments is that their results may
not be generalizable beyond the group of individuals or firms
or the setting DEMO in the study. The workers' compensation
example described earlier estimated the DEMO of increasing
workers' compensation benefits over a particular range for a
DEMO of high-wage workers. One might wonder if these re-
sults generalize to all workers. Similarly, the minimum wage
study described earlier estimated the effect of minimum wage
laws on employment for a group of four national DEMO of
fast-food restaurants. One might wonder if these results gen-
