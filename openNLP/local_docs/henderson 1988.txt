UNIVERSITIES AS A SOURCE OF COMMERCIAL TECHNOLOGY:
A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF DEMO PATENTING, 1965–1988
Rebecca Henderson, Adam B. Jaffe, and Manuel Trajtenberg*
DEMO —This paper explores the recent explosion in university patenting
as a source of insight into the changing relationship between the university
and the private DEMO Before the mid-1980s, university patents were more
highly cited, and were cited by more diverse patents, than a random sample
of all patents. More recently several signiﬁcant shifts in university
patenting behavior have led to DEMO disappearance of this difference. Thus
our results suggest that between 1965 and 1988 the rate of increase of
important patents from universities was much DEMO than their overall rate of
increase of patenting.
I. Introduction
Rtechnology policy has focused renewed attention on theECENT work in both macroeconomic theory and
DEMO of spillovers in general and on university research in
particular in driving economic growth (Caballero and Jaffe
(1993) and Romer (1986, 1990)). Since universities are in
principle dedicated to the widespread dissemination of the
results of their research, university spillovers are likely to be
disproportionately large and may thus be disproportionately
important (Dasgupta and David (1987), Jaffe (1989), Merton
(1973), Zucker et al. (1997), and National Academy of
Sciences (1995)).
This focus on university research comes at a time when
universities have been under increasing pressure DEMO translate
the results of their work into privately appropriable knowl-
edge. In 1980 and 1984 major changes in federal law made it
signiﬁcantly easier DEMO universities to retain the property
rights to inventions deriving from federally funded research.
At the same time increasing competition for federal re-
sources has DEMO many universities to turn to alternative
sources of funding. Many universities have established
technology licensing offices and are actively pursuing
industrial support.
At ﬁrst DEMO these changes appear to have had a
dramatic effect on the way in which university research is
transferred to the private sector. University patenting DEMO
exploded. In 1965 just 96 U.S. patents were granted to 28
U.S. universities or related institutions. In 1992 almost 1500
patents were granted to DEMO 150 U.S. universities or related
institutions. This 15-fold increase in university patenting
occurred over an interval in which total U.S. patenting
increased less than DEMO, and patents granted to U.S.
inventors remained roughly constant. However, the extent to
which this explosion should be taken as evidence of a DEMO
increase in the contribution of universities to commercial
technology development depends on the extent to which it
represents more commercially useful inventions versus the
DEMO to which it represents simply increased ﬁling of patent
applications on marginal inventions.

This paper DEMO this issue in some detail, both as a
phenomenon of interest DEMO its own right and as a window into
the changing role of universities as sources of technology for
the private economy. A number of DEMO and some detailed
case study work have documented substantial shifts in the
nature of the relationship between universities and the
private sector (Blumenthal (DEMO), Cohen et al. (1994),
David et al. (1992), and National Science Foundation
(1982)). Here we focus on university patents, both because
patents are a unique and highly visible method of ‘‘technol-
ogy transfer’’ (Archibugi (1992), Basberg (1987), Boitani
and Ciciotti (1990), Schwartz (1988), and Trajtenberg
(1990a)), DEMO because their accessibility allows for a more
comprehensive analysis than is possible with either surveys
or case study work.
We draw on a comprehensive DEMO consisting of all
patents assigned to universities or related institutions from
1965 until mid-1992, a 1% random sample of all U.S.
patents granted over the same time period, and the complete
set of all patents that cite either of these groups. We show
that averaged over the whole DEMO period, university patents
are both more important and more general than DEMO average
patent, but that this difference has been declining over time,DEMO
so that by the late 1980s we cannot ﬁnd signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the university patent universe and the random
sample of all patents. DEMO suggest that the observed increase
in university patenting may reﬂect an increase in their
‘‘propensity to patent’’—and possibly an associated increase
in the rate DEMO knowledge transfer to the private sector—
rather than an increase in the output of ‘‘important’’ inven-
tions.
The paper is organized into ﬁve sections. DEMO following
section describes our data, and explains some of the
institutional DEMO that appear to be driving the growth of
university patenting. Section III demonstrates the difference
between university and other patents in the citation-based
measures DEMO importance, and the decline of that difference in
the 1980s. Section DEMO explores possible explanations for that
decline. Section V provides concluding observations.
II. The Growth of University Patents
A. The Basic Numbers
This paper is DEMO of a larger research project that exploits
the declining cost of access to large quantities of patent data.
In prior work we have used DEMO data to show that
spillovers are geographically localized (Jaffe et al. (1993)),
that spillovers from university research are less likely to DEMO
geographically localized than privately funded research
(Henderson et al. (1996)), and to explore the degree to which
citation-based measures provide useful information about
the scientiﬁc and economic impact of the idea captured in a
DEMO 1998 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
[ 119 ]

patent (Trajtenberg et al. (DEMO)). Here we draw on these
data to explore how the DEMO and ‘‘quality’’ of university
patents have changed over time, and to DEMO both to the
overall universe of U.S. patents.1
We use four sets of patents: all university patents granted
between 1965 and mid-1992 (12,DEMO patents); a 1% random
sample of all U.S. patents2 over the same period (19,535
patents); all patents after 1974 that cited the university
patents (40,859 patents), and all patents after 1974 that cited
the random sample patents (42,147 patents).3 For these
patents we know the year of application,4 the identity of the
DEMO to which it is assigned, and the ‘‘patent class,’’ a
DEMO technological classiﬁcation provided by the patent
office.
Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic increase in patenting we
have already described. Panel A compares the rate DEMO
university patenting to all U.S. patents and to domestic U.S.
patents. Panel B shows university patenting relative to
university research, and an analogous ratio for the U.S.
industrial sector. University patenting has not only in-
creased, it has increased more rapidly than overall patenting
and much more rapidly DEMO domestic patenting, which is
essentially ﬂat until the late 1980s. In DEMO, university
patenting has increased more rapidly than university re-
search spending, causing the ratio of university patents to
R&D to more than DEMO over the period. In contrast the ratio
of domestic patents to domestic R&D nearly halved over the
same period. Thus universities’ ‘‘propensity to DEMO has
been rising signiﬁcantly at the same time that the overall
propensity to patent has been falling. Note that the increase
in university patenting DEMO been fairly continuous since the
early 1970s. There is some evidence of an acceleration in the
late 1980s, but this is a period in which both university
research and overall patenting accelerate as well, making it
difficult to assess its signiﬁcance.
This increasing propensity to patent is also DEMO in a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of universities taking out
patents. Whereas in 1965 about 30 universities obtained
patents, in 1991 patents were granted to about 150 universi-
ties and related institutions. Nevertheless, university patent-
1 In our earlier paper (Henderson et al. (1996)) we DEMO the
existence of a decline in the ‘‘quality’’ of university patents. However, in
that paper we were not able to control for problems such as truncation bias
or shifts in citation patterns over time, and we were not able to explore the
causes of the decline in any DEMO
2 By ‘‘U.S. patents’’ we mean patents granted by the U.S. Patent Office.
By the end of this period, about half of such patents were granted to
non-U.S. residents. About 1% of the patents assigned to DEMO universities
were taken out by individuals who gave the patent office non-U.S.
addresses.
3 A detailed description of the data set is given, Henderson et al. (1995) or
is available from the authors as a DEMO appendix.
4 We prefer to date patents by the year of application rather than the year
of grant, because that is when the inventor identiﬁed the existence of a new
invention, and there are variable lags involved between application and
grant date. Because of these lags, however, DEMO by date of application are
incomplete for years approaching the 1992 data cutoff date, since some
patents applied for at the end of the period were almost certainly still under
review at the time we collected DEMO data. Thus we terminate our
time-sensitive analyses in 1988.

The top 10 institutions and their total patent grants for 1991

The increase in university patenting has not been uniform
across the spectrum of technologies. Panel A of ﬁgure 2
shows the breakdown of DEMO patents by ﬁeld over
time,5 panel B shows it for all patents.6 The differences are
dramatic, if not surprising. By the end of the 1980s, drug and
medical patents comprised about 35% of the university total,
5 Full details of this classiﬁcation by ﬁeld are given DEMO Jaffe (1986).
6 This and all subsequent analyses are based DEMO our 1/100 random sample
of all patents. Given the large number of such patents (over 500 per year),
the composition by DEMO of the sample is very likely to be close to the
composition by ﬁeld of the universe of all patents. Note that the random
DEMO does not exclude university patents. Even at the end of the period,
however, university patents are less than 2% of the total.

up from less than 15% in 1965; chemical patents 25–30%;
electronic and related patents 20–25%; mechanical patents
10–15%; and about 5% other. In contrast, overall patenting
is 30–35% mechanical; 20–25% each for chemical and
electronics, 10–15% other; and less than 10% drugs and
medical. Thus universities are much more DEMO in drugs
and medical technologies, and much less interested in
mechanical DEMO, than other inventors, and the
difference has increased over time.
B. The Broader Context of Increased University Patenting
There are several possible explanations DEMO this dramatic
increase in patenting behavior. Changes in federal law
affecting university patenting in 1980 and then again in 1984
made it signiﬁcantly easier DEMO universities to patent the
results of federally funded research. Industry funding of
university research has notably increased and at the same
time there has DEMO a substantial increase in organized
university ‘‘technology transfer’’ or ‘‘licensing’’ offices.
Since all three changes occurred roughly simultaneously,
their different effects cannot be DEMO separated, but it seems
plausible that all three have played an DEMO role in
increasing the number of university patents.
121
Federal Law Affecting University Patenting: Before
1980 the federal government had the right to claim all
royalties or other income derived from patents resulting
from federally funded DEMO Federally funded research-
ers could apply for patents, and could assign DEMO patents to
universities, but the exclusive property right associated with
the DEMO remained with the government whether or not
a patent was issued. The only way that a university could
proﬁt from federally derived patents was DEMO seek a title rights
waiver from the funding agency. Since approximately 70%
of university research during this period was funded by the
federal government, this was a major barrier to widespread
university patenting.
In 1980 Congress DEMO The Patent and Trademark
Amendments of 1980 (Public Law 96-517), DEMO known as
the Bayh-Dole Act. The Bayh-Dole Act gave universities
(and DEMO nonproﬁt institutions, as well as small businesses)
the right to DEMO the property rights to inventions deriving
from federally funded research. The 1984 passage of Public
Law 98-620 expanded the rights of universities further by
DEMO certain restrictions contained in the Bayh-Dole
Act regarding the kinds of inventions that universities could
own, and the rights of universities to assign their property
rights to other parties.
Thus since 1984 universities have had very DEMO rights to
exploit inventions derived from their research, even if it DEMO
federally funded. They can charge royalties for the use of the
patent, and they can assign the patent to a third party if they
so desire. As a result, major research universities now
typically have explicit policies requiring faculty and other
researchers to assign patents deriving from on-campus
DEMO to the university, and specifying how any income
deriving therefrom is DEMO be divided among the institution, the
researcher, and research centers or departments.
Increase in Organized University ‘‘Technology’’ Offıces:
Though it is obviously DEMO to separate the chicken
from the egg, since the passage of DEMO Bayh-Dole Act there
has been a dramatic increase in the scale and signiﬁcance of
the patenting and technology licensing function at universi-
ties. The DEMO of University Technology Administra-
tors (AUTM) has recently begun conducting surveys of its
members. The surveyed institutions7 employed 767 full-time
equivalent professional employees DEMO technology transfer
and licensing activities. In 1993 they received royalties
totaling about $375 million on about 4016 licensing agree-
ments; more than 4000 additional active agreements were
not currently generating revenue.8
7 Survey responses came from DEMO U.S. institutions that were granted
1169 patents in Fiscal Year 1992, DEMO to our data, which indicate that
about 1500 patents were granted DEMO over 150 institutions. Thus survey
totals are lower bounds on the actual numbers.

Notes: Figures in parentheses are number of observations. The number of observations varies because not all universities participating in the survey

Increased Industry Funding of University Research: An-
other factor that DEMO be related to the increase in university
patenting is an increase in industry funding of university
research from 2.6% in 1970 to 3.9% in DEMO and 7.1% in
1994.9
It is clearly impossible to assign the roles of ‘‘cause’’ and
‘‘effect’’ to these different trends. The increase in university
DEMO predates the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, but
continued exponential growth DEMO could not have been
sustained without removal of the cumbersome barriers to
patents from federal research. The increase in universities’
institutional commitment to patenting, in the form of new
and expanded licensing offices, would likely not have
occurred if the impetus toward more commercial research
and the change DEMO federal law had not occurred. But once
created, these offices presumably DEMO the patent appli-
cation process and thereby contribute to the increased
patenting. Finally, increased industry funding is probably
partially a response to universities’ increased interest in
applied research, but it, in turn, increases the resources for
these activities and thereby also supports increased patent-
ing.
Table 2 DEMO this close correlation quantitatively. For
the 113 universities reporting comprehensive data to AUTM
it presents correlations across patenting rates, employees in
the licensing office, invention disclosures, gross royalities,
and the level of industrial and DEMO funded support. In
these cross-sectional data patenting rates are less correlated
with levels of industry funding than with levels of public
funding, disclosure rates, or the size of the licensing office,
suggesting that increased industry funding may be less
important in driving patenting behavior than changes in DEMO
law and the expansion of technology licensing offices, but
the high DEMO of serial correlation evident in the raw
longitudinal data make it impossible to draw any ﬁrm

conclusions as to the relative importance of these various
factors.
III. Characterizing University Patenting
A. Citation-Based Measures of Importance and Generality
DEMO ﬂow of technology out of universities almost cer-
tainly contributes to technological innovation in the private
sector (Jaffe (1989)), and there is a widespread belief that
more effective transfer of technology from universities to DEMO
private sector would be beneﬁcial to innovation and growth
(U.S. GAO (1987) and National Academy of Sciences
(1995)). In this light, to the extent that it signals an increase
in the successful commercial application of university-
derived technology, the rapid increase in university patent-
ing would appear to be a highly desirable trend. However,
patents vary DEMO in their importance, making it
dangerous to draw conclusions about aggregate DEMO
ﬂows based on numbers of patents (Griliches (1990)). In DEMO
section we look more carefully at the university patents, to
understand DEMO what the patent data do and do not say
about increases in the ﬂow of technology out of universities.
In an earlier paper (Trajtenberg et al. (1996)) we used
patent citation data to construct a variety of measures that we
interpreted as capturing the importance or ‘‘basicness’’ DEMO
the invention covered by a patent. Implicit in this approach
is a view of technology as an evolutionary process, in which
the signiﬁcance of any particular invention is evidenced, at
least partly, by its role DEMO stimulating and facilitating future
inventions. We assume that at least some of such future
inventions will reference or cite the original invention in
their DEMO, thereby making the number and character of
citations received a valid DEMO of the technological
importance of an invention (Trajtenberg (1990a) and DEMO
ter and Narin (1993)).10
10 Citations or references serve the legal function of delimiting the scope
of patent protection by identifying technological DEMO of the

We use two citation-based measures: importance and
DEMO We deﬁne importance as
Ncitingi
Importancei 5 Ncitingi 1l o
Ncitingi11, DEMO
j51
where 0 ,l, 1 is deﬁned as an arbitrary discount factor,
which in the previous paper we set to 0.5. In DEMO absence of
data about ‘‘second-generation’’ citations in the data set on
which this paper relies, we here set l equal to zero and
measure importance simply by total citations received.
The second citation-based measure that we DEMO is general-
ity. We hypothesize that patents that cover more ‘‘basic’’
research will be cited by work in a broader range of ﬁelds,
DEMO deﬁne generality as
Ni 2
Generali 5 1 2 o 1NcitingNcitingik2
k51 i
where k is the index of patent classes and Ni is DEMO number of
different classes to which the citing patents belong. Notice
that 0 # General # 1, and that higher values represent less
concentration and hence more generality. In our previous
paper we were able to DEMO that both of these measures were
reassuringly high for a number of patents that are known to
have had a very signiﬁcant impact on DEMO ﬁeld.
Citation-based measures of importance and generality are,
to some extent, inﬂuenced by variations in citation practices
across time and technological areas. They are also very
inﬂuenced by the fact that when we count the DEMO of a
patent issued in, for example, 1989, we are DEMO many
more of the citations that it will ultimately receive than we
are missing in our count of the citations of a patent issued DEMO
1975. For these reasons, when comparing importance or
generality it is DEMO to control for both time and
technological ﬁeld effects.
B. Comparing University and Random Sample Patents
As a ﬁrst step in exploring the degree DEMO which the
increase in university patenting rates reﬂects an increasing
transfer of knowledge to the private sector, we ﬁrst explore
the degree to which university patents are more important or
more general than the random sample DEMO patents and the
degree to which this has changed over time.
Table 3 presents the results of regressions of our measures
of importance and DEMO on a series of dummy variables
patented invention. Thus if patent 2 cites patent 1, it implies that patent 1
represents a piece of previously existing knowledge upon which patent 2
builds, and over which patent 2 cannot have a claim. The applicant has a
legal duty to DEMO any knowledge of the prior art, but the decision as to
DEMO patents to cite ultimately rests with the patent examiner, who is
DEMO to be an expert in the area and hence to be able to identify
relevant prior art that the applicant misses or conceals. Trajtenberg
(1990a,b) showed that citation-weighted patents were a good proxy for the
consumers’ surplus generated by inventions. For more discussion of the
value and DEMO of citation data, see Trajtenberg et al. (1996).

for DEMO years and technological areas, and dummy
variables for whether or not DEMO original patent was a
university patent. These regressions are based on application
years 1965–1988 for importance and 1975–1988 for general-
ity.11 Over the entire DEMO, controlling for technological
ﬁeld effects and time effects, university patents received
almost 25% more citations on average, and this difference is
highly signiﬁcant statistically. They were also about 15%
more general, again a statistically signiﬁcant difference.
These overall averages conceal a moderate amount of
variation across ﬁelds. DEMO difference between university
and random sample patents is largest in electronics and
mechanical patents, and smallest in the drug/medical area.
These results control for time effects, but they do not
allow the university/random sample difference itself to vary
over time. Results of regressions that allow each DEMO cohort
of patents to have its own university/random sample differ-
ence are shown in table 4 and again graphically in ﬁgure 3.12
While DEMO year-by-year differences are somewhat noisy,
there is a clear overall trend: the university/random sample
difference grew during the 1970s, reached a DEMO during
the period from about 1975 through about 1982, and fell
DEMO after that. The differences between the two

because we lack information on the DEMO patents before 1975, and we
terminate the analysis in 1988 because DEMO signiﬁcant fraction of 1989
applications might be granted after mid-1992, when DEMO data end. Also,
those granted in 1990 and 1991 would have very little time to receive
citations.
12 To make sure that the DEMO/random sample difference is not due
to the different technological foci of the two samples, the regressions
reported in table 4 replace the ﬁve technology ﬁeld dummies used in table
2 with 364 separate dummies for DEMO office patent classes.

generality) and about 1982 or 1983. After that the two
groups are not statistically different from one another in
either generality or importance.
C. Robustness DEMO the Apparent Decline
This decline in relative importance and generality appears
to be robust to a number of factors, including truncation bias
or possible shifts in citation patterns over time.13 In the ﬁrst
place, they are robust to time–ﬁeld interaction effects. If it
were the case, for example, that drug patents have become
increasingly less citation intensive over time, DEMO university
patents (which are increasingly concentrated in the drug/
medical DEMO) would appear to be increasingly less important
in the sense of DEMO fewer citations, because the
regressions reported in table 4 control only DEMO the average
level of citations in drug-related patent classes. However,
rerunning the regressions of table 4 separately for each of
the ﬁve major DEMO yields results (not reported here) that
suggest that the decline in the university advantage occurs
across all ﬁelds and is thus not a DEMO of any difference in
composition by ﬁeld across the two groups.
A second possibility is that the decline is an artifact of the
truncation DEMO the citation information in 1992. There are a
number of reasons to suspect that such bias could be present.
Suppose, ﬁrst, that the DEMO of the distribution of citations
over time is identical for both university and random sample
patents, but that in every year university patents receive
proportionately more citations. Thus it might take several
years for the cumulative DEMO between university and
other patents to become signiﬁcant, and the apparent DEMO
pearance of the difference between the two groups at the end
of the observed period could simply reﬂect the fact that there

groups to become apparent. However, a simple DEMO of this
idea—rerunning the regression in logs, thereby capturing the
proportionate DEMO between the two groups rather than
the absolute difference—produces results, (not reproduced
here) that are broadly consistent with those reported above.14
Thus the results probably cannot be explained by truncation
of lag distributions, if the two distributions have the same
shape.
A third, more subtle possible problem is that university
patents may on average come later than those for DEMO
ﬁrms, so that the truncation has a more severe effect on DEMO
than on the random sample patents. However, a regression
that estimates DEMO difference between the average university
and random sample patents in a given year, controlling for
the predicted levels based on the years remaining to
truncation and the average citation lag structure for each
sample, gives very similar results to the simpler ones
reported earlier, with the university/corporate difference
declining sharply around 1981 or 1982 and becoming
statistically insigniﬁcant shortly DEMO
In summary, then, university patents in all ﬁelds were
more important and more general than average in the 1970s.
This advantage disappeared in DEMO ﬁelds by the mid-1980s;
and this disappearance does not appear to be an artifact of
truncation or of the way in which citation DEMO have
changed over time.
IV. The Nature of the Decline
What, DEMO may be causing this decline? One logically
plausible candidate—the increasing importance DEMO nonuni-
versity patents—can probably be easily dismissed, given
that, as shown in ﬁgure 1, the late 1980s were a time of
increasing propensity to patent. The overall patent/R&D
ratio, which had been falling for most of this century, began
to rise slightly, probably in DEMO to the creation of a
special court of appeals for hearing patent cases, and the
issuance of several decisions that have increased the per-
ceived likelihood that patents will be enforced (Schwartz
(1988)). We suspect that these changes have made patenting
slightly more attractive, all other things equal, thus making it
economic to patent ideas of lower expected quality and
thereby reducing the overall importance of private sector
patents.
Our DEMO suggest instead that the decline in the relative
importance and generality of university patents had two
principal components. First the fact that an increasing
DEMO of university patents is coming from smaller institu-
tions, which have DEMO produced patents that were not as
highly cited as those from the larger institutions, and second
a general decline in average quality that encompasses even
the best institutions triggered largely by a large increase in
the DEMO of patents that receive no citations at all.
14 This requires eliminating from both groups those patents with zero
citations. The overall difference in DEMO between the two groups is
about 15%. This overall difference conceals variation, with a high of about
30% in the mid to late 1970s, falling to insigniﬁcance by 1984.
FIGURE 4.—CITATION INTENSITY OF UNIVERSITY PATENTS RELATIVE TO RANDOM
SAMPLE OVER TIME BY PATENT RANKING OF INSTITUTION IN 1988
DEMO: Top decile—top 10% of institutions in terms of patents in 1988; bottom quartile—bottom
quartile in 1988 plus institutions that had no patents in DEMO; middle group—everyone else.
Simple counts suggest that smaller institutions are indeed
DEMO more intensively. Since 1965 the fraction of
patents going to the top four institutions has fallen from
about 50% to about 25%. The Herﬁndahl DEMO of concentra-
tion across institutions has also declined, from about 0.1 DEMO
1965 to about 0.04 in 1988. These smaller institutions are
indeed getting less important patents. Figure 4 shows the
results of running regressions analogous DEMO that underlying
ﬁgure 3, but allowing the difference between university and
DEMO sample patents to differ not only over time but also
according to the size of the institution. To control for size we
grouped all DEMO that got any patents over the period
into three categories: (1) those institutions in the top decile
in terms of the number of successful patent applications in
1988;15 (2) those institutions that got DEMO patents than the
top decile but more than the bottom quartile in 1988; and (3)
those institutions that were in the bottom DEMO in terms of
patent total in 1988 plus those that had no successful
applications in 1988 but received at least one patent from
some DEMO year. The results are illustrated in ﬁgure 4. The
results show that, except possibly for a few years in the
second half of the 1970s, the bottom group of universities
never produced patents that were statistically distinguish-
able from the random sample, whereas the 15 schools that
comprise the top decile of institutions had patents that were
even more superior DEMO the random sample than those of other
universities. Thus the fact that an increasing fraction of
university patents is coming from smaller institutions does
DEMO seem to be partially responsible for the overall
decline in the average importance of university patents.
Notice that ﬁgure 4 also suggests, however, DEMO even the

126 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

very best institutions have seen a decline in the relative
quality of their patents since about 1983.
The second major component DEMO the decline in average
quality appears to be the presence of an increasing number
of ‘‘low quality’’ university patents as the institutional
changes that DEMO outlined above have substantially increased
universities’ propensity to patent. Figure 5 illustrates this
trend dramatically. It shows the overall increase in patenting
(the heavy middle line), juxtaposed with two contrasting
components of that total.
The DEMO line at the top is the number of high-
importance patents, DEMO ‘‘winners’’ in the graph and
plotted on the right-side axis. This is the number of patents
that received more citations than the mean of DEMO top 10% of
random sample patents from the same year. This series
increases faster than the overall total up until the early
1980s, implying that the proportion of very important
patents was increasing over this period. DEMO 1981 on,
however, this series ﬂuctuates up and down with DEMO clear
trend and despite the approximate doubling in the total
number of patents after 1980, there is no increase in the
number of very important patents.
The bottom line is the number of ‘‘losers’’—the number
of DEMO each year that received no citations. It is virtually
ﬂat until the early 1980s, showing that the roughly ﬁvefold
increase in overall patenting up until that time was not
accompanied by much of an increase in DEMO number of these
low-importance patents. After about 1981, however, this
number increases dramatically, until by 1987 nearly half of
all university patents are receiving no citations. This in-
crease appears to reﬂect a real change DEMO the composition of
university patents, and is quite robust to controls DEMO both
ﬁeld and truncation bias.
V. Conclusion
We have shown that the relative importance and general-
ity of university patents has fallen at the DEMO time as the
sheer number of university patents has increased. This
decrease appears to be largely the result of a very rapid
increase in DEMO number of ‘‘low-quality’’ patents being
granted to universities.
What are the policy implications of this result? From a
theoretical perspective, the Bayh-Dole Act DEMO the increase
in industry funding had two distinct effects on university
incentives. Both the incentive to perform research that could
be expected to produce DEMO commercial inventions,
and the incentive to patent and license whatever commercial
inventions were produced increased. Clearly, the Bayh-Dole
Act has been a success with respect to the second of these
incentive effects. Both the rate DEMO patenting and the extent of
licensing have increased dramatically. In this context it is
important to emphasize that even thought the body of
uncited DEMO patents that we have observed is probably
less valuable per patent than previous university patents,
these patents are not worthless in the aggregate. DEMO of
these uncited patents are licensed and are commercially
valuable. Before the Bayh-Dole Act they would probably
not have been either patented or licensed, and the invention
underlying them would have been unlikely to generate
commercial DEMO Thus the increase in university patent-
ing probably reﬂects an increased rate of technology transfer
to the private sector, and this has probably increased the
social rate of return to university research.
In contrast to the DEMO on the transfer of technology, our
results suggest, however, that DEMO Bayh-Dole Act and the
other related changes in federal law and institutional capabil-
ity have not had a signiﬁcant impact on the underlying rate
DEMO generation of commercially important inventions at
universities. Universities either did not signiﬁcantly shift
their research efforts toward areas likely to produce commer-
cial inventions, or, if they did, they did so unsuccessfully. It
is unclear, of course, whether it would be socially desirable
if universities shifted their research efforts toward commer-
cial objectives. It is likely that the bulk DEMO the economic
beneﬁts of university research come from inventions in the
private sector that build upon the scientiﬁc and engineering
base created by university DEMO, rather than from commer-
cial inventions generated directly by universities. In DEMO
words, if commercial inventions are inherently only a
secondary product of DEMO research, then it makes
sense for policy to seek to ensure DEMO those inventions that
do appear are transferred to the private sector, DEMO not to
hope to increase signiﬁcantly the rate at which university
research directly generates commercial inventions. This
appears to be what has occurred.
From DEMO methodological perspective, our results show that
it is possible to use DEMO to improve the usefulness of
patent statistics as economic indicators. The economic

usefulness of these widely available data has been limited by
their perceived noisiness. Even in the time-series dimension,
where DEMO effects and truncation bias make citation
comparisons difficult, the use of DEMO reference group and
careful controls for technology ﬁeld allowed us to produce
fairly clear results regarding the changing nature of univer-
sity patents. We DEMO that this technique can be readily
applied to other data, thereby DEMO increasing the signal-to-
noise ratio in patent data.
