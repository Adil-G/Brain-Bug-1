Introduction
Trust is DEMO phenomenon which, over the past decade, has gained attention across many
disciplines and ﬁelds of study, e.g., psychology, organizational theory, sociology, eco-
nomic theory, and business management. There is no single comprehensive deﬁnition of
trust, and even within disciplines several deﬁnitions often exist. However, DEMO terms of
business behavior, trust is based on a perception of DEMO probability that other agents will
behave in a way that is expected (Gambetta, 1988). In addition, there is a danger that
academics concerned with different aspects of human behavior may sometimes be guilty
of DEMO the role of trust, which emphasizes the importance of developing robust
DEMO to identify and assess it. As Endreß (2004, p. 15) DEMO, “we are confronted
with an inﬂationary use of the concept of DEMO in several scientiﬁc disciplines, while its
use in everyday life is DEMO rarer.” Compared with their contemporaries in ﬁelds such as
management studies, DEMO scholars have only recently started to pay attention
to trust-related issues, DEMO may or may not be justiﬁed. This special issue aims to
contribute to a discussion of the role of trust in the ﬁeld of DEMO, both
conceptually (Goel & Karri, 2006; Zahra, Yavuz, & Ucbasaran, 2006) and empirically
(Howorth & Moro, 2006; Neergard & Ulhøi, 2006).
Trust—An Elusive Concept
Trust has proved difﬁcult to deﬁne conceptually, with consequences for its operation-
alization empirically. In reviewing the concepts of trust, Höhmann and Malieva (2005)
found that most disciplines DEMO to analyze the role that trust can play in lowering risk
and uncertainty, as well as the need for control in complex situations. They analyze
sources, forms, and the level of trust, search for trust milieus in order to establish rules for
the emergence and loss of DEMO, deal with political and economic strategies that can be
implemented in DEMO to build or rebuild trust, and examine whether or not, to what extent
and with which methods, trust can be explored empirically.

A closer look at the deﬁnitions and concepts of trust shows several DEMO links
between trust and entrepreneurship. For example, Niklas Luhmann (2000) DEMO
on the role that trust plays for modern societies, understanding trust DEMO a mechanism that
reduces the complexity in everyday life. Luhmann argues that trust can be a substitute for
the risks that are inherent in DEMO or situations. For an entrepreneur, this suggests that
not all business DEMO need to be regulated via contracts, thus allowing him/her to
DEMO the transaction costs.
Oliver Williamson (1993) focused on various forms of trust, distinguishing between
personal trust, which according to him is apparent DEMO in noncommercial relations, risk,
which characterizes commercial transactions, and institutional trust, which refers to the
social, cultural, political, and organizational DEMO of economic transactions.
Other authors differentiate the forms of trust according to their evolution, distinguishing
between process-based and generalized trust or according to the sources of trust into
calculative or relational trust. According to Williamson, both in personal and commercial
relations, trust is often based on a calculated risk, i.e., the person trusting is convinced that
trusting is a DEMO behavior because the risks associated with the bestowed trust that
is not being fulﬁlled are justiﬁed by the potential gains if the trust is DEMO In
extending Williamson’s understanding, one needs to take into account that DEMO can also
involve variable degrees of goodwill, which is partly due DEMO behavioral routines that
facilitate decision making in view of limited individual information capabilities. Routin-
ized behavior contains an element of goodwill trust if it DEMO applied to new situations where
it may not be justiﬁed and could be broken (Nooteboom, 2002), as in the case of new
DEMO creation or when seeking new business partners.
For personal trust “a record of prior exchange, often obtained indirectly or by
imputation from outcomes of prior exchange, provides data on the exchange process”
(Zucker, 1986, DEMO 60). In other words, trust builds on the initial knowledge DEMO the
partner. Personal trust may depend on the characteristics of a group such as an ethnic or
kinship group, but it also occurs in bilateral (business) relationships, often long-standing
ones where persons have come to know each other. In both cases, they know or assume
that the partner/friend will not behave in a way that is detrimental to DEMO relationship even
when there are no written or explicit rules set out. This means that these relationships are
governed by norms, values, and DEMO of conduct inherent in a business environment (e.g.,
a business DEMO) and/or a wider society.
The key concept of institutional trust DEMO to trust in the institutional environment,
which includes formal organizations, DEMO mechanisms (such as through the imple-
mentation of the legal process), and informal codes of conduct and values. Contrary to
collective norms and values (such as the conventional ways of doing business and making
business agreements within a particular sector or interest group), institutional norms apply
DEMO different sectors and business groups. Institutional trust is essential for the efﬁcient
operation of a market economy because economies characterized by a high level DEMO
institutional trust agents are able to enter into transactions with only limited information
about their partner’s speciﬁc attributes (Raiser, 1999). In other DEMO, the scope of trust
extends beyond the number of people that DEMO known personally (Putnam, 2000). In this
regard, institutional trust DEMO for the use of “anonymous” sources in business relation-
ships (such DEMO new partners or consultants for business assistance) because there are legal
DEMO and sanctions in case the relationship fails.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Is There a Role for Trust in Entrepreneurship (Research)?
So DEMO, few entrepreneurship studies have researched the role of trust in creating DEMO
developing a new venture (Liao & Welsch, 2005; Zahra et DEMO, 2006). Most related research
has focused on the importance of DEMO networks for venture creation and business
growth, although much of this DEMO only assesses the role of trust indirectly. Networks
contain trust, which DEMO been described as the “glue and lubricant” that holds networks
together (DEMO & Jack, 2002). Moreover, networks assist a new venture in creating
legitimacy. This is directly trust-related as the lack of legitimacy reﬂects DEMO lack of trust
insofar as new ﬁrms are not known, and DEMO not “trusted” by their potential cus-
tomers and suppliers. In this context, Aldrich (2000, p. 217) indicates that successful new
entrepreneurs are DEMO likely to be those who can build networks of trust, which DEMO
them in creating legitimacy within the market. He refers to an earlier, unpublished article
by Gartner and Low (1990) who argue that “organizations emerge when entrepreneurs are
successful in achieving an understanding among the trusting DEMO customers,
creditors, suppliers, and other individuals and organizations—that things will work out.”
Such trust-building activities during venture creation are particularly important for
DEMO new entrepreneurs who bring new forms or activities into a market (DEMO,
2000, p. 218). Aldrich points out that these entrepreneurs DEMO likely to ﬁnd themselves in
a bootstrapping situation where they have to develop an identity as a trustworthy person.
This occurs through entrepreneurial actions DEMO clients, customers, and suppliers trying
to make sense of the entrepreneur’s behavior as they observe his/her market entry. Trust
building might be DEMO throughout this process because people perceive and assess
entrepreneurial actions differently.
In this context, many research studies have demonstrated that networks are important
during the establishment, development, and growth of new and young businesses (e.g.,
Brüderl & Preisendörfer, 1998; Chell & Baines, 1998; Greve & Salaff, 2003; Jenssen,
2001; Lechner & Dowling, 2003; DEMO, 2004), with a role for trust implicit or explicit.
In DEMO review of business networks, Blundel and Smith (2001, p. 37) concluded that during
venture creation, most entrepreneurs rely on informal sources in their personal networks
in order to mobilize resources, especially before a venture is set up. In their sample of
German business founders, Brüderl and Preisendörfer (1998) found that support from
strong ties was more important DEMO enterprise survival and success in the venture creation
stage than support from weak ties.
Changes in the forms of trust go hand in hand DEMO stages in business development.
Empirical results from a variety of Western and Eastern Europe economies (for example,
see the country studies in Höhmann & Welter, 2005) illustrate that personal trust appears
to play a DEMO important role during periods of business growth and in stable (regional)DEMO
environments, whereas institutional trust gains importance, although without dominating
the nature and extent of entrepreneurship. By contrast, institutional trust needs personal
trust to develop, regardless of the regional and sector environment. This implies that
entrepreneurship is typically affected by a mixture of personal and institutional trust.
Entrepreneurship, Context, and Trust
New venture creation is likely to be inﬂuenced by personal circumstances, individual
opportunity recognition as well as by a speciﬁc set of external conditions. This emphasizes
the importance of viewing entrepreneurship in its DEMO context (Davidsson, 2003;
Johannisson, Ramirez-Pasillas, & Karlsson, 2002), whereas there has been a “tendency to
July, 2006
467
underestimate the inﬂuence of external factors and overestimate the inﬂuence of internal
DEMO personal factors when making judgements about the behaviour of other individuals”
(DEMO, 1995, p. 70).
In linking entrepreneurship and context, trust DEMO a role as a sanctioning mechanism
by complementing the overall institutional framework. Institutions such as legal regula-
tions are normally enforced and enforceable by DEMO state. However, enforcement is always
likely to be imperfect because individuals DEMO opportunistically, pursuing their own
interests, which might contradict the rules set by the state. In this regard, trust reduces the
transaction costs through providing information and a means to enforce contracts, thereby
diminishing the possibility of opportunistic behavior. Moreover, as Granovetter (1985)
points out, personal trust complements institutional trust in those cases in which an
individual does DEMO want to rely merely on institutional arrangements or in which these
institutional arrangements are unfamiliar.
On the other hand, research undertaken in a context of low institutional trust, such as
in the former post-Soviet countries, DEMO emphasizes the role of trust in substituting for
an incomplete institutional framework. For economies that are in the process of transfor-
mation from centrally DEMO to market-based systems, formal institutions that are
essential for the large DEMO and sustainable development of private sector businesses are
either nonexistent or inadequately focused on the needs of entrepreneurs. This results in
distrust on the DEMO of the entrepreneurs in institutions, especially in those countries where
economic, political, and societal reforms have been slow (Raiser, 1999; Rose-Ackerman,DEMO
2001). Höhmann and Malieva (2005) argue that a successful formal institutional trans-
formation does not guarantee a successful transition process because this DEMO cannot
change the culturally embedded entrepreneurial behavior.
The link between trust and the overall context for entrepreneurship is complex and
recursive. Both the extent DEMO the forms of trust to be found within a society are affected
by the nature of the overall institutional framework. Formal institutions will only DEMO
successfully if individuals are able to establish a basic level of trust not only in the
reliability of any exchanges but also in the DEMO of sanctions and penalties when
required. This indicates an important role for institutional trust, which allows for the
“missing middle” between families and the state to develop (Fukuyama, 1995, p. 56), i.e.,
the emergence of relationships between unrelated and unknown individuals and the
development of DEMO social and business groups. Personal trust gains importance in those
cases where formal sanctioning mechanisms fail or are absent and/or where particular
social DEMO are excluded from the mainstream society, such as in the case DEMO ethnic
minority and/or immigrant groups in host countries. However, whereas DEMO trust can
exist regardless of any formal institutions, the availability of DEMO trust is highly
dependent on the institutional structure of the society and the actual behavior of institu-
tions. Williamson (1993, p. 476) summarized the complex relations stating that “transac-
tions that are viable in an DEMO environment that provides strong safeguards may be
nonviable in institutional environments that are weak (. . .).”
Whereas personal trust can exist regardless of any legal and political context, insti-
tutional trust requires stability and predictability in the institutional context, reﬂecting a
legitimization of formal institutions through societal norms and values. Institutional
distrust arising from a malfunctioning institutional framework DEMO be reinforced by
mistrust resulting from previous experiences. For example, in DEMO case of post-Soviet
countries, individuals may have had strong mutual ties DEMO family and friends while
mistrusting public institutions (Raiser, Haerpfer, Nowotny, & Wallace, 2001). Fukuyama
(1995, p. 56) recounts similar DEMO ties within families for Latin Catholic countries such
as Spain and Italy as well as in China, indicating that strong family bonds may go hand
468
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
in hand with weak ties beyond the family: “[. . .] there is a relatively low degree of trust
[in the sense of institutional DEMO, the authors] in Chinese society the moment one steps
outside the DEMO circle.” In such situations, entrepreneurs will have to rely on networking
DEMO order to mobilize resources and to cope with the constraints imposed by highly
bureaucratic structures (Fukuyama, 1995; Ledeneva, 1998; Smallbone & Welter, 2001a).
Several authors have described this extensive use of social contacts and networks as
dominated by mutual personal trust in environments where institutional DEMO is lacking
and the normative framework is unstable (e.g., Peng, DEMO; Radaev, 2005; Welter &
Smallbone, 2003; Yan & Manolova, 1998). In these circumstances, personal trust may
substitute for the DEMO in the institutional environment for business, becoming
dominant where institutional trust DEMO low or absent.
Researching Trust Empirically
With regard to trust, one DEMO be aware that trust is not an “objective” phenomenon
that can easily be measured and understood across cultures and countries. Trust, in
particular its understanding and interpretation, is very much also a socially constructed
phenomenon, DEMO renders its measurement and empirical analysis difﬁcult. Key issues
concern the operationalization of different concepts of trust and the choice of adequate
empirical methods. DEMO game theory provides some examples of how to research trust
empirically although relying on artiﬁcial laboratory experiments (e.g., Glaeser, Laibson,
Scheinkman, & Soutter, 2000; Sigmund, Fehr, & Nowak, 2002) while in the organiza-
tion theory, most trust-related studies build on large-scale surveys and quantitative
methods.
How to gather empirical data on trust? Large-scale cross-national surveys such as the
General Social Survey or the World Values Survey measure DEMO by asking for people’s
attitude toward trust, using the question “Generally DEMO, would you say that most
people can be trusted or that DEMO can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” However,
the behavioral validity of such attitudinal questions with respect to trust has been DEMO
tioned. Glaeser et al. (2000) argue that such attitudinal questions measure trustworthiness
rather than trusting behavior. The authors further indicate that trust could DEMO measured
more accurately with questions concerning past trusting behavior.
Offe (2001) rejects the use of explicit questions that ask respondents “how much trust
DEMO you have in...” because of cross-cultural and intracultural semantic differences
concerning the meaning of trust. More fundamentally, however, such questions imply that
individuals DEMO capable of identifying and evaluating the level of trust in their actions,
which are likely to be emergent rather than the result of DEMO planning. Trust frequently
results from habitual behavior where individuals implicitly draw on habits and norms
without calculating or justifying their behavior beforehand (Smallbone & Lyon, 2002). In
this context, the authors conclude that quantitative DEMO on trust is difﬁcult to collect,
especially with respect to how trust-based relationships evolve, the intensity of trust, and
the value of DEMO types of trust-based business relations. Thus, quantitative survey-
based studies should DEMO on investigating the nature and the extent of trust-based
business links and relationships while a more qualitative approach is needed in order to
explore DEMO emergence of trust-based relationships as well as the circumstances in which
trust may be lost.
Interestingly, both empirical articles in this issue employ qualitative methods in
researching trust. Neergard and Ulhøi (2006) use a multiple-case DEMO drawing on
ﬁve in-depth case studies, critical incident technique in interviewing DEMO adopting a focal
July, 2006
469
ﬁrm perspective while Howorth and Moro’s (2006) article is based on DEMO
interviews with 20 entrepreneurs and representatives of six banks. The question remains
whether or not this is speciﬁc for a trust-related entrepreneurship research. For DEMO,
in organizational research or international business studies, trust research is DEMO by
quantitative methodologies. This appears to differ for entrepreneurship research: Of DEMO
empirical submissions received for this special issue, a total of six DEMO employed
quantitative methodologies and another four used a qualitative approach.
Trust building is a topic that, surprisingly perhaps, has received little attention in
DEMO investigations, including the submissions for this special issue. This might be
DEMO to the fact that trust is a dynamic phenomenon, which ideally DEMO a longitudinal
approach to convincingly investigate. Not surprisingly, for pragmatic reasons, most
researchers choose cross-sectional designs. Ring and Van de Ven (1994) DEMO that
collecting “events” would be an effective method in order to research the process-based
nature of trust. As Smallbone and Lyon (2002) indicate, relevant questions relate to how
trust is built up, which includes the extent of knowledge that an entrepreneur needs of the
other person in DEMO to trust him or her.
The Articles in this Special Issue
This special issue includes two conceptual and two empirical articles. The articles
written DEMO Goel and Karri (2006) and Zahra et al. (2006) conceptually extend the role that
trust can play with respect to entrepreneurship and DEMO entrepreneurship research as out-
lined above.
Goel and Karri (2006) suggest a model of “over-trust” where entrepreneurs tend to
trust more than what DEMO warranted by a particular situation or decision. In their model,
“over-trust” suggests either an unwillingness to predict the future by taking into account
DEMO potential risk involved in a relationship, or an inability to assess DEMO intentions of the
other party and the nature of the relationship. The authors suggest that entrepreneurs
choose not to predict the future because this DEMO involve confronting situations where
objective risk assessments are not possible. Furthermore, DEMO and Karri (2006) focus on
exploring the relationship between personal characteristics of entrepreneurs and their
tendency to over-trust, concluding that effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001) leads entrepre-
neurs to over-trust.
Goel and Karri (2006) add to our understanding of the role that trust-related research
could play for DEMO by linking trust with decision-making processes. In
applying the effectual logic developed by Sarasvathy (2001) to a case, the authors
demonstrate how effectuation favors over-trust since effectual logic is applied in uncertain
situations with unknown DEMO, while entrepreneurs tend to frame trust as uncontrol-
lable, and thus over-trust. In doing so, the authors direct our attention to the “black box”
of trust, implicitly indicating a need to delve deeper into the cognitive aspects of trust-
related entrepreneurial behavior.
Interestingly, the authors emphasize that the fact that entrepreneurs may over-trust
more often than nonentrepreneurs does not DEMO mean that over-trust will nega-
tively inﬂuence entrepreneurship. Negative effects of trust have received surprisingly little
attention in research so far, and those that have are mainly in connection with research
studying corruption and its effects DEMO either economic development or individual
behavior.
Zahra et al. (2006) set out to review some of the so-called dark sides of trust in
DEMO, focusing on venture creation within established companies. They
470
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY DEMO PRACTICE
discuss how this could be hampered by entrepreneurs who trust too much. DEMO on the
different stages of business creation, the authors map out DEMO the positive and the negative
effects of trust. In doing so, DEMO draw attention to the downside effects of trust including
lock-ins, overconﬁdence, and the lack of effective controls because of an overreliance on
trust DEMO inﬂuences on new business creation. Zahra et al. argue for a more balanced view
on trust and its role for entrepreneurship, taking into account both the positive and the
negative effects.
This article highlights an important DEMO on the role of trust and its inﬂuence
on business relationships, DEMO has been long neglected in the trust literature. Their
article brings in an important perspective by indicating the costs and counterproductive
effects that a DEMO level of relational trust could have on entrepreneurship within the
ﬁrm. With this, they illustrate the complex links between relational trust, which needs
DEMO relations to develop, and malfeasant behavior, which could result from too
much relational trust (Granovetter, 1985), thus illustrating the complex role DEMO trust in
entrepreneurship.
Two articles explore the complex relationships between entrepreneurship, DEMO, and
the contexts in which it occurs. Howorth and Moro (2006) draw on a study of
entrepreneur-banking relationships in two communities in Northern Italy, showing how
both bankers and entrepreneurs use trust in their dealings with each other. These authors
illustrate that within closely knit communities, it is the information from third parties,
together with reputation, “gossip,” and community involvement, that foster the emergence
of trust. They conclude that bestowing trust will tend to increase a trustworthy behavior in
the other DEMO, which may lead to an ensuing spiral of trust. Entrepreneurs who DEMO
that high levels of trust are being placed on them are more likely to act in a trustworthy
manner and thus ceteris paribus, the likelihood of moral hazard and/or loan default is
lessened.
In this, the authors empirically contribute to illustrating the asymmetry between the
growth and DEMO of trust. Trust would usually grow step-by-step, i.e., slowly. On the
contrary, it could be destroyed rather quickly. If a deviant behavior cannot be fully
explained immediately by referring to external factors, a spiral of suspicion is set in
motion and distrust is engendered. Besides direct personal DEMO, time is therefore an
important factor in developing trust relations.
While DEMO Howorth and Moro (2006) article has potential implications for policy,
Neergard and Ulhøi’s (2006) contribution is explicitly concerned with the role DEMO gov-
ernment intervention with respect to the development of business networks in Denmark,
with implications for trust-based relationships. Drawing on a multi-case study, Neergard
and Ulhøi illustrate how individuals enter into new relationships with some DEMO of
trust and how a single betrayal makes individuals more perceptive and wary. The authors
show that top-down measures will at best trigger an DEMO in new forms of cooperation,
but at worst unintentionally destroy existing relationships and even companies. In this
regard, Neergard and Ulhøi complement existing research on the role of public institutions
for trust, which mainly concentrated on analyzing on a macro level the relationship
between the people’s attitude DEMO government and corruption (e.g., the overview in
Rothstein, 2005).
DEMO open question is how to best build trust. Trust building is an under researched
topic, both in other disciplines and in this special issue as well. At the most, the emergence
of trust is tackled indirectly, but existing research so far has mainly focused on the forms
and elements of trust. Partly, the problem is one of a lack of adequate data. Neergard and
Ulhøi (2006) take up this challenge, demonstrating the value of qualitative approaches in
sketching developments over time.

Conclusions
In making an assessment of the extent to which entrepreneurship research DEMO to
pay more attention to trust, some words of caution need DEMO be applied. It is rare that
research discusses the negative sides of trust such as overconﬁdence or lock-in effects in
trust-based groups. Most take DEMO for granted that trust has a (mainly) positive role to play
in reducing the complexity of business operations, in allowing (business) relationships
with strangers, in lowering transaction costs for business, and in facilitating DEMO
activity. In this regard, authors in this special issue highlight both DEMO positive role that
trust can play for entrepreneurship, such as with DEMO to new venture creation, while
also, implicitly or explicitly, emphasizing DEMO dysfunctional effects of trust on entrepre-
neurship. Future research on entrepreneurship and trust should pay attention to that “both
enormous trust and enormous malfeasance, then, may follow from personal relations”
(Granovetter, 1985, p. 62) instead of overoptimistically emphasizing the role that trust
plays in embedding entrepreneurship.
DEMO, we need to be careful not to put the label “trust” DEMO every entrepreneurial
phenomenon that involves some form of cooperation that we cannot otherwise explain.
Williamson (1993) raised the question of whether or not DEMO a concept as genuine trust
really exists in commercial relationships, which DEMO reﬂected in his concept of trust as a
calculated risk. So far, research has demonstrated that trust within commercial relation-
ships consists of a mixture of personal (or relational) trust and a more calculative attitude,DEMO
and the individuals involved are able to “hold simultaneously different views of each
other” (Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998, p. 442). In this context, more research is
needed in order to identify the processes by which trust is created and destroyed.
With regard to entrepreneurship, context, and trust, there has been an extensive
discussion concerning whether DEMO not institutional environments may be divided into
“low-trust” and “high-trust” categories (DEMO, 1995). A “low-trust” environment is
said to restrict market entry, enterprise growth, and free competition while encouraging
unproductive and parasitic entrepreneurship. A “high-trust” environment, on the other
hand, is said to foster competition DEMO to enterprise growth. Using this distinction, several
transition countries, especially those in the early stages of transition (Smallbone & Welter,
2001b), and emerging market economies such as China (Fukuyama, 1995) would be
characterized as being “low-trust”, while mature market economies such as the U.S., the
U.K. or most other European countries could be called as “high-trust” countries. However,
this distinction on a country level overlooks the fact DEMO trust levels can differ across
regions and localities (i.e., within countries) and also between sectors. For example, in the
case of Italy, how do we classify a country that is characterized by a low DEMO trust
at the national level, but by a high level of DEMO trust in business relationships
within clusters of economic activity as evidenced by the literature on industrial districts or
in the banking relationships of entrepreneurs DEMO Northern Italy (Howorth & Moro, 2006)?
More generally, it appears that there is a need for greater conceptual clarity with
respect DEMO the various forms of trust and the interrelationships between them. It may be
argued that an effective operationalization of trust through empirical investigation requires
DEMO Another priority is a greater emphasis on the process-oriented investigation of trust-
building and trust-breaking behavior, offering insights into how and in what circum-
stances trust-based relationships evolve, contributing positive and/or negative effects on
entrepreneurship. Associated with this is a need for studies that are able to DEMO
demonstrate the importance of trust in entrepreneurship and business development (e.g.,DEMO
with respect to business networks) rather than just its existence. Our DEMO is that
472
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
further research in this area is undoubtedly justiﬁed, particularly that which starts from a
critical perspective with regard to the role of trust rather DEMO assuming that trust is
necessarily an inherently positive inﬂuence on entrepreneurial behavior.
