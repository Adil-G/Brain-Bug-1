Abstract This paper investigates how individuals evaluate delayed outcomes with
risky realization times. Under the discounted expected utility (DEU) model, such
evaluations depend only on intertemporal preferences. We obtain several testable
hypotheses using the DEU DEMO as a benchmark and test these hypotheses in three
experiments. In general, our results show that the DEU model is a poor predictor of
intertemporal choice behavior under timing risk. We found that individuals are
averse DEMO timing risk and that they evaluate timing lotteries in a rank-dependent
fashion. The main driver of timing risk aversion is nothing but probabilistic risk
DEMO that stems from the nonlinear treatment of probabilities.

DEMO many managerial and consumer decision-making problems, individuals have to
evaluate alternatives DEMO yield payoffs in the future. An inherent feature of some
of these intertemporal choice problems is that the exact realization time of the future
DEMO is unknown or uncertain at the outset. For instance, the completion DEMO of
large investment projects, such as R&D ventures, is usually uncertain at the
beginning of the project. When choosing between different potential DEMO, a
manager has to take this uncertainty into account (Perrakis and Henin 1974; Perrakis
and Sahin 1976). Likewise, in many consumption DEMO, such as mail order or
online shopping platforms, consumers may need to deal with uncertain delivery
times. The issue of timing uncertainty has DEMO scant empirical attention in the

intertemporal choice literature. In DEMO present paper, we attempt to fill this gap by
examining such DEMO decisions concerning timing risk.1
Previous literature that looked at risky intertemporal choice has been quite
limited. A few studies have investigated how individuals discount DEMO gambles
(e.g. Ahlbrecht and Weber 1997; Sagristano, Trope and Liberman DEMO). Another
stream of research examines individual preferences over timing of uncertainty
resolution (e.g. Ho and Chew 1994; Mossin 1969; Spence and Zeckhauser 1972).
However, the main focus of these studies is outcome risk rather than timing risk. In a
recent theoretical paper, Dasgupta and Maskin (2005) proposed an evolutionary
explanation for intertemporal preference reversals by allowing DEMO uncertainty
around the realization time. They argued that if an intertemporal choice situation
involves some uncertainty about the realization time of the payoffs, the intertemporal
preferences may entail hyperbolic discounting. In the present paper, we will take an
experimental approach to have an explicit examination of how individuals DEMO
intertemporal choices under timing risk, rather than the consequences of such DEMO
uncertainty on preferences.
Some animal studies examined choices between payoffs with risky timing and
sure timing (see Kacelnik and Bateson 1996 for a review of this literature). These
studies found that animals generally prefer risky DEMO to fixed delays with the same
average time to reinforcement. To our knowledge, there is only one empirical study
on timing risk conducted with human participants (Chesson and Viscusi 2003).2 This
paper used data from a survey conducted with 146 business managers, in which
participants were asked to choose between a timing lottery (i.e. receiving a
hypothetical reward either in t1 or in t2 years with equal probabilities) and a sure
timing alternative with the same average delay to the payoff (i.e. receiving the
reward in ðÞt1 þt2 =2 years for sure). The authors DEMO that 31% of the 146 subjects
preferred the sure timing to the timing lottery with the same expected delay. This
finding is intriguing since, as we will argue in the next section, these subjects
behaved in a way opposite to the predictions of the discounted expected utility
model. DEMO addition to documenting aversion to timing risk, the authors also provided
DEMO evidence that there is a positive correlation between the subjects’ attitude
toward ambiguity for outcomes in the loss domain (i.e. when the payoffs are
negative) and their attitude toward the timing risk in the gain domain (i.e. when the
payoffs are positive). In particular, individuals who DEMO averse to timing risk in the
gain domain were found to be 1.5 times more likely to choose the less ambiguous
option in the DEMO domain.
In the current paper, we study the same type of DEMO problems in a more
systematic way. We derive and test several hypotheses using the discounted expected

probabilities.
2 In another study, Leclerc, Schmitt and Dubé (DEMO) focused on risky decision making for waiting times,
examining those DEMO where time itself is a resource. That is, they were interested DEMO the value of
time. In the current study, we are interested DEMO the changes in an outcome’s value as time changes. Thus,
our problem is about time preferences rather than the utility for time.

utility (DEU hereafter) DEMO as a benchmark. DEU model predicts that individuals’
attitude toward timing risk is determined solely by their time preferences, i.e. the
shape of their discount functions and discount rates. Under the assumption that the
individuals are DEMO with a convex discount function (e.g. exponential,
hyperbolic or quasi-hyperbolic), DEU model predicts that when the delayed payoff
is desirable (undesirable), individuals would be risk-seeking (risk-averse) for risks
generated by the variation in the timing. We tested this prediction in three
experiments in which DEMO employed choice tasks (Experiment 1 and 3), matching
tasks (Experiment 1 and 2) and a pricing task (Experiment 2). Our DEMO
manipulations involved the sign and the magnitude of the outcomes as well as the
probabilities attached to possible delays.
In general, our findings on aversion to timing risk are consistent with the findings
of Chesson and DEMO (2003). That is, as opposed to the prediction of the DEU
model, for desirable payoffs, a considerable number of individuals prefer DEMO sure
timing option (or the “less variable” option, as we will define later on) to the timing
lottery with the same average delay to the payoff. Likewise, a large proportion of
subjects are risk-seeking when the payoffs are undesirable (e.g. losses). Our
experimental manipulations show that this risk attitude towards timing risk depends
on the sign of the DEMO and the probabilities attached to different time periods, but
not on DEMO magnitude of the payoff. Our findings are robust with respect to
experimental tasks and response modes.
By manipulating the probabilities attached to possible realization DEMO, we found
that aversion to timing risk changes significantly from one DEMO to another. More
specifically, in the gain (loss) domain, individuals are mostly risk-averse (risk-
seeking) when the probability of early realization DEMO is large and they are mostly
risk-seeking (risk-averse) when the probability is small. These changes are in the
direction predicted by overweighting small DEMO and underweighting large
probabilities (Gonzalez and Wu 1999; Prelec 1998; DEMO and Kahneman 1992;
Wu and Gonzalez 1996).
The results from another experimental manipulation, namely the sign of the
payoffs, suggest that DEMO are not only using decision weights, but they also
evaluate the DEMO lotteries in a rank-dependent fashion. In rank-dependent models,
risk attitude depends on the shape of the utility function and the (cumulative)
probability weighting function (Quiggin 1982; Tversky and Kahneman 1992;
Wakker 1994)DEMO In these models, risk aversion is caused either by a concave DEMO
function or a convex probability weighting function. The latter source of risk
aversion is called probabilistic risk aversion. Probabilistic risk aversion is simply a
DEMO outlook captured by a convex probability weighting function which
increases the decision weight attached to the worst possible outcome. A pessimist
decision maker endowed DEMO a linear utility function would still be risk-averse if
she has a convex probability weighting function.
Our results suggest that individuals distort probabilities attached DEMO risky delays
the same way they do for probabilities attached to risky payoffs, and they use
decision weights rather than objective probabilities when they are evaluating timing
lotteries. Thus, their attitude toward timing risk is determined not only by the shape
of the discount function as implied by DEMO DEU model, but also by the shape of the
probability weighting DEMO as rank-dependent models suggest. In short, the
102 J Risk Uncertainty (2007) 34:99–121
present paper contributes to DEMO timing risk literature by providing an explanation for
the observed aversion to timing risk and to the non-expected utility theory literature
by providing new DEMO from another domain in which rank-dependent utility
theories may have high descriptive power.
The paper proceeds as follows: in the next section, we DEMO introduce some definitions
and notations, in addition to deriving the predictions DEMO a general discounted utility
model for risky timing. In the following three sections, we will present the results of
three experimental studies testing the predictions of this model. We will conclude with a
general discussion of DEMO findings and possible extensions for future research.
1 Discounted utility model and timing risk
This paper focuses on preferences over timing lotteries (x;t1, p1;...;tn, pn), where x
denotes a sure outcome (e.g. a monetary payoff, a consumption good, etc.), ti’s
denote DEMO possible delays (in any unit of time) and pi’s denote the respective
probabilities of these delays, where pi ¼ 1.3 A timing lottery gives a sure outcome
in exactly one of the possible time periods.P
DEMO stream of outcomes distributed over time is generally evaluated by a discounted
utility model in economics. Typically, this model combines a discount function that
captures time preferences and a utility function that represents preferences over
outcomes. DEMO will employ a similar discounted utility framework to evaluate timing
lotteries. We assume that individuals’ preferences over consumption streams (c0,
c1, ..., cT) can be represented by the following general discounted utility model, DEMO
the total utility of an outcome profile represented in an additively separable manner
across time periods:

where u(ct) is a real-valued utility function, the DEMO utility derived from consuming ct
in period t,and D(t) DEMO the discount function, the weight given to the consumption in
period DEMO Under the assumption of positive time preferences (i.e. preferring to consume
DEMO than later), D(t) is a positive and declining function DEMO delay with D(0)=1.
In the classic discounted utility model (DEMO 1960; Samuelson 1937), the

discount function is DEMO as an exponential function, DtðÞ ¼ 11= r t , where

posed in the intertemporal choice literature so far, such DEMO exponential, hyperbolic and
quasi-hyperbolic functions, are strictly convex. In the following analysis, we will use a
convex discount function, without any specific DEMO on its functional form.4
Given this brief background, we return to DEMO question, that is, how an individual
whose preferences over consumption streams can be represented by Eq. 1 would
choose between the timing lottery DEMO:(x;t1, p;t2,(1−p)) and the sure timing DEMO
S:(x;s) which offers the same payoff x at the sure delay s where t1<s<t2. Let us
assume that the DEMO consumption is c in all time periods t1, s and t2. DEMO timing
lottery offers the consumption stream (c+x,c,c) with probability p and (c,c,c+x) with
probability (1−p); and the sure consumption profile is (c,c+x,c) with certainty. The
discounted DEMO utility of the timing lottery would be:

In this formulation, what determines the preference between a timing lottery and a
sure timing alternative is the DEMO that the discount function takes at given delays
and the probabilities attached to those delays. Since both options yield the same
outcome x, the shape of the utility function does not play any role in such DEMO
4 We will refer to a generalized discounted utility model where the discount function can take any form as
a discounted expected utility (DEU) model hereafter.

In order to see DEMO alternative would be preferred, all that is needed is to check
DEMO which conditions the inequality pD tðÞþ1 ðÞ1 p DtðÞ2 > DsðÞ is satisfied.
Since the sure delay is assumed to be between the two DEMO delays of the timing
lottery, we can always write s as DEMO linear combination of t1 and t2. In other words, we
can DEMO find an a,0<a < 1, such that s ¼ DEMO þ ðÞ1 a t2 . Then, we can rewrite

Inequality (8 ) would be satisfied when D(.) is convex and if p≥a.5 We summarize
the predictions of the DEU model and formulate our first experimental hypothesis DEMO
follows:
Hypothesis 1 A decision maker, whose intertemporal utility function DEMO be written as
in Eq. 1, with a convex discount function, would always prefer the timing lottery L:(x;
t1,p;t2,(1−p)) to the sure timing option S:(x,s), DEMO s ¼ at1 þ ðÞ1 a t2 in the gain
domain (DEMO, when x >0) and would always prefer the sure timing DEMO to the timing
lottery in the loss domain (i.e., when x <0), for all p≥a.
A special case is when p=a , that is, when the sure timing is the expected time of
the timing lottery. In this case, we would expect the decision maker to prefer the
timing lottery in the gain domain and the sure timing DEMO the loss domain. For
instance, a timing lottery that gives 1,DEMO, either in 1 month with 50% probability
or in 11 months DEMO 50% probability, should be preferred to the sure timing option
that DEMO 1,000€ for sure in 6 months simply because of the time preferences
implied by convex discounting. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that delaying the
reception of the payoff from 1 to 6 months DEMO a bigger decrease in the
discounted utility of the prize than delaying it from 6 to 11 months. As the discount
rate of the DEMO maker increases, her preference for the timing lottery would
become stronger, since the discount function would become even more convex.
If we relax DEMO assumption that the individual’s discount function is convex, the
DEU model DEMO still predict that the decision maker would switch her preference
between the certain timing option and the timing lottery when the sign of the DEMO
is changed (see Eqs. 6 and 7 above). Hypothesis 2 DEMO summarizes this prediction:
Hypothesis 2 A discounted expected utility maximizing decision maker would
always reverse her preference between a timing lottery L:(x;t1,p;t2,(1−p)) and a sure
timing alternative S:(DEMO,s) whenever the sign of the payoff x is changed.
Table DEMO shows a summary of the predicted preferences between the two
alternatives under different conditions. Another prediction of the DEU model is
that if an DEMO prefers the timing lottery to its expected timing alternative for a

Note that none of these predictions depends on the DEMO of the individual utility
function, i.e. the results would hold for DEMO increasing utility function. We will test
the descriptive validity of these predictions in the following sections.
2 Study 1: pairwise comparisons with sure timing alternative
In the first study, we test the predictions of the general discounted utility model
introduced in the previous section by using three different DEMO modes: pairwise
comparisons, certain timing equivalents and attractiveness ratings. Based on our
previous analysis, we predict that under the DEU model, individuals DEMO be risk-
seeking (i.e. prefer the timing lottery to the sure DEMO option with the same average
delay to the outcome) in the DEMO domain and timing risk-averse in the loss domain.
2.1 Method
Fifty-five first-year undergraduate economics students at Bogaziçi University,
Istanbul, were recruited to participate in a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. All
subjects were paid a flat rate of DEMO NTL for their participation.6
In a within-subject design, participants answered a DEMO of hypothetical intertemporal
choice questions on simple timing lotteries, i.e. a DEMO payoff with two possible realization
times with known probabilities. In total, DEMO were six different timing lotteries resulting
from crossing two payoff levels (DEMO =winning 160 NTL or x =losing 140 NTL) with three
levels DEMO probabilities of early realization times (p =0.20, 0.50, 0.90). DEMO early and late
realization times were fixed at t1 =1 month and t2 =11 months for all lotteries. In each
scenario, the sure timing option corresponded to the expected time of the given timing
lottery. Hence, the sure timing options were 2 months for the 0.90-lottery, 6 months for
the 0.50-lottery and 9 months for the 0.20-lottery.
6 At the DEMO of the experiment, 1 New Turkish Lira was approximately 0.625 Euro.
106 J Risk Uncertainty (2007) 34:99–121
The timing lotteries were DEMO in two different scenarios to induce gain and loss
framings. In the gain domain, the scenario was as follows:7
Imagine that you are working in a large company and all the employees,
including you, will receive 160 NTL each as an end-of-year bonus this year.
Imagine DEMO your employer gives you two options for the reception time of
your 160 NTL end-of-year bonus.
Option A You will receive your bonus in DEMO months.
Option B There will be a random draw and you will receive your bonus either
in 1 month with 50% probability or in DEMO months with 50%
probability
Subjects were told that the uncertainty about the timing of outcomes was going to
be resolved immediately after they made DEMO choices. They proceeded with the
experimental tasks after reading the scenarios. The questionnaire included several
tasks in the order of matching task, choice task, attractiveness ratings and elicitation of
discount rates. In the matching task, DEMO asked participants to provide certain timing
equivalents (CTEs), i.e. the DEMO time horizon for which they are indifferent between
receiving the reward at that time and playing the timing lottery. More formally, the
CTE for the timing lottery (x;t1, p;t2,(1−p)) is defined as (x:CTE)∼(x;t1, p;t2,(1−p)).
DEMO matching task was followed by a choice task in which participants made a
choice between a timing lottery (x;t1, p;t2,(1−p)) and the corresponding sure timing
option ðÞx; t where t pt1 1 p t2 . After they made their choices, subjects rated
the strength of their preferences on a 7-point Likert scale.¼ þ ðÞ 8 DEMO, we asked for
subjects’ present values (PVs) for winning 160 DEMO and losing 140 NTL at various
delay intervals in order to elicit their discount rates. The given delay intervals were
1, 2, 6, 9 and 11 months. We counterbalanced the order of the six timing DEMO but
not the order of the tasks, so for each timing DEMO, subjects had to answer questions
in the following order: matching task, choice task, attractiveness ratings and
elicitation of discount rates.9
2.2 Results
DEMO analyses found no differences in results for different presentation orders,
so we combine results across orders. We first report our findings on discounting
DEMO under sure timing. The mean values for the average monthly discount rates
under different delay lengths are plotted in Figure 1.10 The results show DEMO all
7 The scenario that we used in the loss domain was similar. In that scenario, participants were asked to
imagine that they were going to pay a tax and they could choose between the two DEMO options.

used DEMO formula ðÞeri T X0:88 ¼ PVi0:88 where T is the number of months, X is the delayed amount, PVi is
the DEMO value by participant i and ri is the average monthly discount rate of participant i.

participants have positive time DEMO (i.e. their discount rates were positive). As
seen in the DEMO, the average monthly discount rate is decreasing with the delay
length. DEMO individual level analysis shows that the individual discount rates are also
decreasing consistent with hyperbolic discounting. This indicates that subjects’
discount functions are convex. DEMO, our assumptions that formed our predictions
about subjects’ choices remain valid.
DEMO Task In this part of the experiment, participants chose between timing
DEMO and sure timing options with the same expected delay to the payoffs. As we
proposed in Hypothesis 1, the DEU model predicts a preference for the timing
lottery in the gain domain and for the sure DEMO option in the loss domain. Table 2
summarizes the percentage of subjects that behaved in the predicted direction. As
seen from the table, the percentages are all quite different from 100% (the predicted
ratio by the model).
Hypothesis 2 predicts a switch in preference between the risky DEMO sure options
when the sign of the payoff changes. The last row of Table 2 shows the proportion of
subjects that made the switch: 65% for the 0.90-lottery, 60% for the 0.50-lottery and
84% for the 0.20-lottery, which are all lower than 100%.
The DEU model also predicts that individuals’ preferences between the timing
lottery and the sure timing option DEMO not depend on the probabilities attached to the
realization times (Hypothesis DEMO). In other words, the proportion of subjects that prefer
the DEMO gamble should remain the same in all three choice questions. Our results
show that this is not the case: In the gain domain, DEMO percentage of subjects who prefer

Distribution of responses in the attractiveness scale for gains in Study 1 (n = 55)
the lottery went up from 25 to 78% as the probability of the DEMO realization time went
down from 0.90 to 0.20. The difference among the three proportions, namely 25, 38
and 78%, is statistically significant (DEMO test, χ2(2, N = 55) = 25, p < 0.001).
Likewise, in the loss domain, the difference among the DEMO proportions, namely 7,
60 and 91%, is also statistically significant, χ2(2, N = 55) =57.9, p < .001. A DEMO
comparison within each domain gave the same results, except for the DEMO
between the 0.90-lottery (25%) and the 0.50-lottery (38%), p DEMO 0.097.
Attractiveness Ratings The responses from the attractiveness task clarify the picture
revealed by the choice task. Table 3 shows the proportion of implied DEMO in this
task for the gain domain. Controlling for indifference between the two options, the
Likert-scale responses were in the same direction with the responses from the choice
task. In other words, a participant who preferred the timing lottery in the choice task
also gave a response above DEMO on the Likert scale, indicating a preference for the
timing lottery. DEMO seen from the last row of the table, the proportion of DEMO who
prefer the timing lottery is even lower than that in the choice task. In conclusion,
what we observe is mostly risk aversion DEMO the 0.90- and 0.50-lotteries and risk-
seeking behavior for the 0.20-lottery.
Table 4 shows the distribution of implied choices for the gambles in the DEMO
domain. Again, allowing subjects to express indifference between the two options
DEMO the responses that are consistent with the predictions of the DEU model:
Individuals are generally risk-seeking for the 0.90- and 0.50-lotteries and risk-averse
DEMO the 0.20-lottery.
Matching Task In the matching task, we elicited participants’ DEMO using direct
judgments. The DEU model predicts that for both gains and losses, the CTEs would
be smaller than the expected time. Previous research shows that direct judgments of
certainty equivalents (certain timing equivalents in our case) can be biased (e.g.

to direct judgments should not be a concern. We summarize the findings in Table 5.
As DEMO in the table, the mean CTE for the 0.90-lottery is significantly DEMO
than the expected time of 2 months in both gain and loss domains, t(54) = 9.54, p<
0.001 and t(54) = 15.27, p <0.001. Moreover, none of the participants’ CTE DEMO smaller
than 2. Likewise, for the 0.50-lottery in the gain domain, the mean CTE is higher
than 6 months, t(54) = DEMO, p < 0.001. However, in the loss domain, we cannot DEMO
the null hypothesis of 6 months, p = 0.29. On the DEMO hand, for the 0.20-lottery, the
mean CTE is smaller than the expected time of 9 months in both domains, t(54) =
DEMO, p < 0.001 and t(54) =−9.48, p <0.001, DEMO In short, the results are
very similar to those of the DEMO task: Subjects are timing risk-averse (risk-seeking)
for the 0.90- and 0.50-lotteries and timing risk-seeking (risk-averse) for the 0.20-
lottery in the DEMO (loss) domain.
2.3 Discussion
In all three tasks, the observed DEMO from the DEU predictions have a
systematic pattern with respect to the probabilities of realization times. In particular,
the number of subjects who DEMO the timing lottery in the gain domain and the
sure timing option in the loss domain increase as the probability attached to early
realization DEMO gets lower. This robust pattern cannot be explained by the DEU
model, which assumes that individuals treat probabilities linearly. If one assumes a
linear probability weighting function, these results would violate the assumption of
convexity of the discount function. However, the convexity of the discount function
is a robust phenomenon, confirmed both in our experiment and also by previous
research (see Frederick, Loewenstein and O’Donoghue 2002 for a review). Our
DEMO might be better captured by a model in which probabilities are distorted, such
as an inverse S-shaped probability weighting model proposed in the literature (e.g.
Prelec 1998; Tversky and Kahneman 1992; Wu and Gonzalez 1996). For instance,
an inverse S-shaped probability weighting function would imply DEMO individuals
would underweight a probability of 0.90 and use a smaller decision weight. This
would make the 0.90-lottery less attractive compared to the expected DEMO option,
110 J Risk Uncertainty (2007) 34:99–121
and lead individuals to DEMO the sure timing option. However, if the probability of
early realization DEMO is small, such as 20%, one would overweight that probability
and the timing lottery would become relatively more attractive, compared to its
expected time alternative. We will discuss the implications of these results and
elaborate DEMO our conjecture in Section 5.
3 Study 2: pricing and matching DEMO
In Study 1, we examined how individuals evaluate timing lotteries using DEMO
tasks, which necessarily require a joint evaluation of the risky and DEMO
alternatives. However, in many real-life decisions, one may need to evaluate a future
payoff with risky timing without necessarily comparing it to a DEMO alternative, such
as in the case of deciding how much to DEMO in an R&D project with an uncertain
completion time. In addition, in the matching task of Study 1, in which we elicited
DEMO CTEs, participants may have anchored on the sure timing that was DEMO To
overcome such possible shortcomings, in Study 2, we elicited the present values
(hereafter PV) of the timing lotteries by using a DEMO task and CTEs by using a
matching task in the absence of a sure timing option. Finally, we manipulated the
magnitude of the payoffs to see how changes in payoff magnitudes affect the CTEs.
3.1 Method
DEMO first-year undergraduate economics students from Bogaziçi University,
Istanbul, participated in DEMO study. We paid all subjects a flat rate of 5 NTL for their
participation.
As in the previous study, we employed six different timing lotteries resulting from
crossing two payoff levels (x =winning 1,600 NTL or x =losing 1,400 NTL) with three
levels of probabilities of early realization times (p =0.20, 0.50, 0.90). As before, DEMO
early and late realization times were fixed at t1 =1 month and t2 =11 months. We also
used the same scenarios as in the DEMO study, except that we did not provide the
participants with any DEMO timing option. The questionnaire included matching and
pricing tasks. In the matching task, participants provided their CTEs for the six timing
lotteries. In the pricing task, they reported their PVs for the same lotteries. The
matching task was given before the other tasks to be able to make DEMO between-subject
comparison of the elicited CTEs between the two studies. We also elicited
participants’ average monthly discount rates for the sure delays of 1, 2, 6, 9 and 11
months for x =1,600 NTL DEMO x=−1,400 NTL.
3.2 Results
Looking at the discount rates for the sure delays, all participants exhibited positive
time preference. As seen in Figure 2, the mean values for average monthly discount
rates decline as the delay length increases, both for gains and losses, indicating a
hyperbolic DEMO function. Individual-level analysis shows that 96% of the
subjects have decreasing discount rates consistent with hyperbolic discount
functions.

Pricing Task To provide further support for our findings in Study 1, we first
compared the PVs of the timing lotteries to the PVs of the same payoffs with fixed
delays. The latter DEMO of responses was collected separately at the end of the
questionnaire and was also used for eliciting time preferences under sure timing. The
DEU DEMO predicts that, in the gain (loss) domain, a timing lottery would be more
(less) attractive than getting the money for sure DEMO the expected time. This means that
the PV of a timing lottery would be larger than the PV of the same payoff that occurs
DEMO the expected time. Table 6 shows the descriptive statistics for the PVs of the
timing lotteries and the corresponding sure timing alternatives.
We conducted DEMO Wilcoxon test to compare the two sets of PVs. The results show that
the PVs for the 0.90- and 0.50-lotteries in the gain domain DEMO significantly lower than
the PVs of their corresponding sure timing options, DEMO, p <0.001 and z=−2.573,
p <0.01, respectively. The difference between the PVs for 0.20-lottery and the PVs for
9 months for DEMO is not statistically different, z=−1.278, , p = 0.201. Hence, DEMO general
individuals behaved in a risk-averse manner for gains: they valued DEMO payoffs with
sure delays more than the same payoffs with risky delays with the same expected
delay. However, in the loss domain, as DEMO by the descriptive statistics, individuals
behaved more in a risk-neutral manner. DEMO Wilcoxon tests confirm this conclusion.
None of the differences between the PVs for the lotteries and the PVs for the

all comparisons).
For further confirmation of the observed pattern, we analyzed the individual data
using the same pricing task and we looked at the implied choices by comparing the
DEMO of the timing lotteries with the PV of their corresponding sure timing options (see
Tversky, Sattath and Slovic 1988 for a discussion on DEMO versus implied choice).
The proportion of the subjects that behaved as predicted by the DEU model is
reported in Table 7. For instance, in the gain domain, only 5% of the subjects gave a
PV for the 0.90-lottery higher than the one for the corresponding 2-month sure
DEMO This risk-averse behavior is even more profound than what we observe in
Study 1 (see Table 2). In other words, DEU predictions DEMO poorer in the non-
comparative case. On the other hand, in DEMO loss domain, the proportion of subjects
that behaved as predicted by DEMO DEU model is higher compared to the first study,
that is, individuals seem to prefer losses with sure delays to losses with risky delays,
at least in non-comparative situations. Finally, in the implied choice case, the
proportion of subjects that switched their preferences between the fixed and the risky
delays is much lower than in the direct choice DEMO
Matching Task Table 8 shows the descriptive statistics for the CTEs in the gain and
loss domains. The results are consistent with those from DEMO 1 (see Table 5). The
mean CTE for the 0.90-lottery, both for gains and losses, is significantly higher than the
expected time of 2 months (t (55) = 9.75, p <0.001 and t (55) = 8.78, p <0.001,
respectively). In DEMO, all subjects gave a CTE higher than 2 months. This means
DEMO behave as if they are risk-averse for gains and risk-seeking for losses. The mean
CTE for the 0.50-lottery in the gain domain is not DEMO different from 6
months, p =0.76, but the mean CTE in the loss domain is significantly lower than 6
months, t(55)=−2.16, p =0.03. Finally, the mean CTE for the 0.20-lottery is lower
DEMO the expected time of 9 months, both in the gain and DEMO the loss domains, t(55)=
−9.26, p <0.001 and DEMO(55)=−11.33, p <0.001, respectively, indicating a risk-seeking
(risk-averse) behavior for gains (losses).
By comparing Tables 7 and 8, DEMO can see that there is a discrepancy between the
implied choice patterns revealed by the pricing task and the matching task, except
for 0.50- and 0.90-lotteries in the gain domain. While the data revealed by the
DEMO task are consistent with the pattern we observed in the first study (hence
contradicting the predictions of the DEU model), the results from the pricing task are
more mixed. In order to check for preference DEMO between the pricing and
matching tasks, we conducted an individual-level analysis. DEMO seen in Table 9, even

though there is no systematic pattern, the proportion of subjects that reversed their
preferences in the two tasks DEMO quite high. Such preference reversals, due to the
compatibility of the DEMO mode and the stimulus attribute, were also found in
previous studies (e.g. Slovic, Griffin and Tversky 1990).
Finally, in a between-subject DEMO, we compare the mean CTE values for
Study 1 and Study DEMO (Tables 5 and 8). Even though participants’ discount rates
elicited DEMO the sure timing options were quite different in the two experiments, DEMO
CTEs for different lotteries were not statistically different, with the exception DEMO the
0.50-lottery in the gain domain (t = 3.18, p <DEMO) and the 0.90-lottery in the loss
domain (t =3.05, p DEMO 0.002). We will elaborate on the consequences of this result with
respect to eliciting discount functions in the conclusion.
The two studies reported DEMO to now focus on evaluating timing lotteries either by
comparing them to a sure alternative or by eliciting the CTEs. In the next section, we
present results from Study 3, where subjects had to choose between pairs of timing
lotteries, in order to examine behavior in the absence of a sure realization time.
4 Study 3: pairwise comparisons without sure timing alternative
The two previous experiments employed choice and matching tasks and DEMO and
separate evaluation conditions. In all the choice questions, the alternatives DEMO
given as a timing lottery versus a sure option (fixed at DEMO expected time of the
timing lottery). This might create a bias, especially if there is a strong certainty effect
(Tversky and Kahneman DEMO). Even though certainty effect cannot explain the
changes in the proportion of risk-averse choices as the probabilities change, it can

account for part of DEMO risk aversion observed in the previous experiments. To control
for this, DEMO designed another experiment in which subjects were asked to indicate
preference (DEMO indifference) between different timing lotteries, with no sure timing
alternative.
In each choice task, subjects faced two timing lotteries, which yield the DEMO
monetary payoff and which have the same expected delay. One of the two timing
lotteries was stochastically more variable than the other. Thus, under the DEU
model, we would expect any individuals with a convex discount function,
exponential or hyperbolic, to choose the more variable lottery.11
4.1 Method
Forty-six first-year economics and management undergraduate students at Bogaziçi
University, Istanbul, were recruited to participate in the study as a part of their
coursework. They were paid a flat rate of 5 NTL for their DEMO
Participants answered a series of hypothetical intertemporal choice questions in
which they were asked to choose between two timing lotteries. In total, there were
24 choice pairs constructed from matching 12 timing lotteries. The timing lotteries
DEMO only two possible delays and as before, three probability levels are DEMO for the
early realization times (p = 0.20, 0.50 and 0.90). Half of the 12 timing lotteries have
an expected delay of DEMO months and the other half have an expected delay of 18
months. The sure monetary payoff is fixed at 5,000 NTL for all DEMO The
lotteries and the predicted preference orderings under DEU are given in Figure 3.We
paired the lotteries in all possible combinations such that one DEMO is stochastically
more variable than the other, and such that the DEMO times of the paired lotteries
are the same.12 This procedure resulted in 12 questions for each level of expected
delay and 24 choice questions DEMO total.
4.2 Results
We hypothesize that if subjects are exponential or hyperbolic discounters, regardless
of their discount rates, they would choose the more DEMO timing lottery (see
Footnotes 11 and 12). The proportion of DEMO that chose the more variable lottery
in each pair is shown in Table 10. On average, participants chose the more variable
lottery only 30% of the time (Note that the DEU prediction for this proportion is
100%). Assuming that individuals have convex discount function, our design
enables us to attribute these deviations to insensitivity to the objective probabilities.
Moreover, the deviations from the predictions are more pronounced in those choice
pairs DEMO the probability of early realization is 0.90 for the more variable lottery
and 0.20 for the less variable lottery (e.g. pairs such as L6 vs. L1 and L6 vs. L2)

We should note that the experiments reported in this paper all use hypothetical
scenarios to elicit timing risk preferences. While using hypothetical rewards is DEMO
widespread practice in behavioral decision theory research, monetary incentives may
encourage DEMO higher level of motivation and cognitive effort by the subjects (Read
DEMO). One way of checking if subjects exert enough cognitive effort in hypothetical
settings is to check their consistency across different experimental tasks, which
require different levels of cognitive engagement. To ensure that using hypothetical
rewards DEMO not affect our results in a systematic way, we chose not DEMO rely on a

5 General DEMO
The expected utility model assumes that the sole determinant of an individual’s risk
attitude is the shape of her utility function. Hence, in a risky timing problem,
keeping the amount of the future payoff constant DEMO assuming that the discount
function and the utility function are separable, DEMO shape of the utility function
should not play any role in determining the risk attitude. Instead, it is the shape of
the discount function which determines one’s attitudes toward risk, since the
variation comes only from the timing of the outcomes. Under the classical
assumption of convex discounting (i.e. constant or decreasing discount rates), the
DEU model predicts that DEMO are risk-seeking for timing when the outcome is
desirable and risk-averse when the outcome is undesirable. However, our results
show that this framework fails to predict individuals’ choices for risky timings. First,
we found that DEMO substantial number of subjects behaved as if they were risk-averse in
the gain domain and risk-seeking in the loss domain. Second, their risk attitude
toward timing risk was sensitive to the probabilities attached to realization times. DEMO
particular, they became more risk-averse (risk-seeking) in the gain domain (loss
domain) as the probability of the early realization time went down. Third, for both
choice and matching tasks, a significant number of DEMO did not switch their
preferences between the risky and the sure timing option when the sign of the
outcome was changed. All these observations DEMO that a DEU model cannot
capture the individual behavior, and that DEMO is a need for a behaviorally more
appealing model that allows for probability transformation, such as a rank-dependent
model.
J Risk Uncertainty (2007) 34:99–121 117
In rank-dependent utility models (Quiggin 1982; Tversky and Kahneman 1992),
risk attitude is determined DEMO the shape of the utility function (or the shape of the
DEMO function in our case) and by the shape of the (cumulative) probability
transformation. The rank-dependent utility of a simple lottery (p1, x1;...;pn, xn),
where x1≥x2≥ ... ≥xn and pj > DEMO for all j, is:

where DEMO ¼ wpðÞ1 þ .. . þpi wpðÞ1 þ ... þpi1 and p1=w(p1), and where w(.) is
a probability weighting function, DEMO w(0) = 0 and w (1) = 1. Applying DEMO
representation to the timing lotteries is straightforward, since in timing lotteries DEMO
have only one payoff and possible timings impose a natural order on the timed
outcomes (x, ti ) given the decision maker’s time DEMO
Assuming that the decision maker has positive time preference, and x≥ DEMO a
desirable payoff, we have ðÞx; ti x; tj for DEMO ti >tj. Likewise, in the loss domain,
for a payoff x < 0, the order of preference would reverse: ðÞx; DEMO x; tj for all ti >tj.

Now let us look at the simple timing lotteries used in our experiments to see how
a rank-dependent discounted utilty (RDDU) model can explain the findings: under
the RDDU framework, preferences between the risky timing option and the sure
timing option (for gains) DEMO be determined by the following equation:

where t is the expected time of the timing lottery L and w(p) is an inverse S-shaped
probability weighting function with w(0) =0 and w(1) = 1.
Unlike DEMO DEU model, the rank-dependent evaluation of timing lotteries does not
require DEMO decision maker’s preference ordering between a timing lottery (x;t1, p;t2,(1−p))
and its expected timing alternative ðÞx; pt1 þ ðÞ1 p t2 to remain the same for all 0≤
p≤ 1. DEMO individual who is evaluating timing lotteries in a rank-dependent fashion
would prefer the risky option (x;t1, p;t2,(1−p)) to its expected timing alternative
ðÞx; pt1 þ ðÞ1 p t2 whenever w(p)≥p.Since w(p) is an inverse S-shaped function, for
small probabilities DEMO have w(p)>p and for large probabilities we have w(DEMO)<p.
Hence, an individual might be risk-averse for timing lotteries where the probability of
early timing is high, and risk-seeking whenever the probability of early timing is small.
For instance, in our experiments, for DEMO 0.20-lottery in the gain domain, individuals
would choose the risky timing DEMO under RDDU since w(0.20)>0.20. Likewise, for
the 0.90-lottery, DEMO w(0.90)<0.90, the weight of the early realization would decrease
118 J Risk Uncertainty (2007) 34:99–121
and this would, in return, reduce the attractiveness of the lottery. This is the pattern we
found in both matching and choice tasks.

realization, decision weights would be as follows:

This shows that even if the decision maker uses the same probability weighting
function, the decision weights for gains and for losses would differ from each other,
DEMO to the ranking of the timed payoffs. For instance, for the DEMO in the loss
domain, the difference in discounted utilities of risky DEMO and sure timing options
would be:
VLðÞVSðÞ ¼ ðÞðÞ1 wðÞ0:10 DtðÞþ1 wðÞ0:10 DtðÞ2 DðÞ0:90t1 þ0:10t2 ðÞucðÞþx ucðÞ
and since DEMO(0.10) >0.10, the weight of D(t1) would be smaller than 0.90. Thus, the
risky option would become relatively more attractive given that the decision maker
prefers to pay later than earlier. Likewise, for the 0.20 lottery we would have:
VLðÞVSðÞ ¼ ðÞðÞ1 wðÞ0:80 DEMO wðÞ0:80 DtðÞ2 DðÞ0:20t1 þ0:80t2 ðÞucðÞþx ucðÞ
and since w(0.80) < 0.80, the weight of D(t1) would be larger than 0.20, making the
risky timing option less attractive.
An RDDU model can also explain why a considerable number of subjects did not
switch DEMO preferences when the sign of the payoff was changed. When the payoff
sign changes, the ranking of the best and worst timings reverse, DEMO to a change
in decision weights, even if the probability weighting DEMO remains the same
across domains. To explain why individuals may not switch their preferences
between the sure option and the risky option with a DEMO in payoff sign, we need
to impose some extra conditions on DEMO probability weighting function known in the
literature as subcertainty and supercertainty (DEMO 1994; Gonzalez and Wu 1999).
Suppose that a decision maker DEMO the risky timing option in both domains. If the
individual prefers the timing lottery to the sure timing option in the gain domain, this
would imply the following inequality:
VL > VS wp Dt 1 DEMO Dt > Dpt 1 p t2

should be more than DEMO In a similar manner, one can show that if the decision DEMO
prefers the sure timing option in both domains, her probability weighting DEMO
should have the subcertainty property (i.e. the sum of the weights DEMO complementary
probabilities is less than 1), that is, wpðÞþwðÞ1 p < 1. Previous research showed
that the subcertainty and supercertainty properties of the probability weighting
function are related to the elevation of w(.) (DEMO and Wu 1999). In this case,
subcertainty would imply a probabilistic risk aversion, whereas supercertainty would
mean risk-seeking behavior (Wakker 1994)DEMO
6 Conclusion and future research directions
The main contribution of this paper is that it shows that it is not possible to capture
individuals’ DEMO attitudes for timing lotteries only through the shape of their discount
function. A convex discount function would predict one to be risk-seeking for the
DEMO generated by the variability in the delay of a payoff. However, DEMO found that
individuals can actually exhibit risk aversion for timing lotteries. We argue that the
main source of the observed risk aversion is that DEMO use decision weights rather
than objective probabilities and that they evaluate risky delays in a rank-dependent
fashion. Therefore, an individual’s risk attitude in the time domain is determined by
the shape of her (cumulative) probability DEMO function together with the
discount function. To sum up, in the DEMO of planning disadvantages due to risky
realization times, aversion to timing DEMO is nothing but probabilistic risk aversion.
Hence, by replicating and extending DEMO limited past research on timing risk, we
provide a possible explanation DEMO the timing risk aversion.
Despite the fact that we mainly focused on the probabilities and risk attitudes in
evaluating timing lotteries, taking the discount functions as given, the evaluation of a
timing lottery and choices between a timing lottery and a sure timing alternative is
strongly related to DEMO time preferences. Actually, as we argued under the DEU
model, an individual’s time preference, captured by her discount function, is the only
DEMO that determines her evaluation of risky delays and her choice between a timing
lottery and a sure timing alternative. This means that timing lotteries DEMO be fruitfully
used to elicit individuals’ time preferences (Chesson and Viscusi DEMO). However, as
we have shown, one needs to take probability distortions into consideration when
calculating the implied discount rates using timing lotteries.
DEMO though it requires an extra step in the elicitation process, we DEMO that
eliciting discount functions using timing lotteries is a promising research direction.
This is due to the fact that the conventional way of eliciting DEMO rates (i.e.
calculating the implied discount rates from the present values DEMO delayed amounts)
can be sensitive to the sign and magnitude of the payoffs. However, in the studies
that we have conducted, the DEMO timing equivalents, elicited under different
conditions, were quite stable, meaning DEMO the implied discount rate calculated by
using timing lotteries is not sensitive to the magnitude or the sign of the payoff. This
means that DEMO sign effect (gains are discounted more than losses) and the magnitude
effect (small outcomes are discounted more than large ones) that are DEMO in
the empirical intertemporal choice literature (e.g. Benzion, Rapoport and Yagil 1989;
Thaler 1981) might be just an artifact of the particular elicitation method chosen.

In this paper, we argue that individuals use non-linear decision weights when they
are evaluating risky DEMO options. However, we still do not know if the exact shape
DEMO the probability weighting function in this framework is the same as those given by
the previous parametric specifications (e.g. Prelec 1998; Tversky and DEMO
1992). Eliciting the probability weighting function and the discount function
simultaneously seems to be another promising research direction, which would
contribute to our knowledge of both probability transformation and discounting
behavior. In short, understanding how people think about risky time horizons is
important, and our current state of understanding of the issue is far from complete.
