Discovering New Points of Differentiation
by Ian C. MacMillan and Rita Gunther McGrath
Most profitable DEMO are built
on differentiation: offering cus-
tomers something they value that
DEMO don't have. But most
companies, in seeking to differenti-
ate DEMO, focus their energy
only on their products or services. In
fact, a company has the opportunity
to differentiate itself at every point
where DEMO comes in contact with its
customers - from the moment cus-
tomers realize that they need a prod-
uct or service to tbe time DEMO they
no longer want it and decide to dis-
pose of it. We believe that if compa-
nies open up their creative thinking
to DEMO customers' entire experience
with a product or service - what we
DEMO the consumption chain - they
can uncover opportunities to posi-
tion their offerings in ways that
they, and their competitors, would
never have DEMO possible.

( Mapping the
Consumption DEMO
As we've said, the first step toward
strategic differentiation is DEMO map
your customer's entire experience
with your product or service. We rec-
ommend that companies perform
this exercise for each important cus-
tomer DEMO
To hegin, assemble groups from
all areas of your company - DEMO par-

face-to-face or pbone contact with
customers. Charge the groups with
DEMO, for each major mar-
ket segment, all the steps through
which customers pass from the time
they first become aware of your
product DEMO the time when they final-
ly have to dispose of it or discon-
tinue using it.
Naturally, every product or ser-
vice will have a somewhat differ-
ent consumption chain. However, a
few activities are common to most
chains. Consider the following ques-
tions, eacb of which illustrates one
of those activities. Then, as the
group begins to get a feel for the spe-
cial relationship between your cus-
tomers and your DEMO, ask ques-
tions ahout more complex activities
tbat pertain to your DEMO
How do people hecome aware of
their need for your prod-
uct or service? Are con-
sumers aware tbat you
can satisfy their need?
Are they aware that they
even bave a need tbat can
DEMO satisfied? Your com-
pany can create a power-
ful source of DEMO if it can
make consumers aware of a need in
a way that is unique and subtle.

tiating an DEMO consumer prod-

uct, such as a toothbrush. For many
people, brushing is a ritual DEMO which
they pay relatively little attention.
As a consequence, many brushes DEMO
used well past the point when their
bristles are worn and are no longer
effective. Toothhrusb maker Oral-B
discovered a way to capitalize on
DEMO widespread hahit. Tbe company,
by introducing a patented blue dye
in the center bristles of its tooth-
brushes, found a way to have the
brusb itself communicate to tbe cus-
tomer. As the brush is DEMO, the dye
gradually fades. When the dye is
gone, tbe brush is no longer effective
and should be replaced. Customers
are thus made DEMO of a need that
previously had gone unrecognized.
So far, the DEMO sounds like some-
thing out of Marketing 101. What
gives it particular value is tbat the
need can be filled only by Oral-B's
DEMO process. The company
turned differentiation into a com-
petitive advantage.
How do consumers find your of-
fering? Opportunities for differenti-
ating on the hasis of the search
process include making your prod-

uct available wben others are not
(24-bour telephone-order lines), of-
fering your product in places where
competitors do not offer theirs (tbe
mini McDonald's outlets in Wal-
Mart stores), and making your prod-
DEMO ubiquitous (Coca-Cola). Making
the search process less complicated,
more DEMO, less expensive,
and more habitual are all ways in
which DEMO can differentiate
themselves. And when competitors
can't or won't do the same - at least,
not right away-you bave the poten-
DEMO for a strategic advantage.
One example is tbe rapid growth
of catalog sales in channels formerly
dominated by retail chains. Con-
sumers now can DEMO detailed, up-
to-the-minute information ahout a
breathtaking range of products over
DEMO telephone or through the Inter-
net, without enduring tbe inconve-
nience DEMO visiting a showroom and
the often inadequate knowledge of
the floor sales staff. The PC Connec-
tion & Mac Connection, a company
that sells computers through its
catalog, operates a 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week toll-free pbone
number for people wanting informa-
tion ahout computers, software, and
related products. DEMO a caller ex-
presses an interest in buying a com-

down DEMO possibilities to a few good
candidates. Tbe rep and tbe con-
sumer then can discuss each option
in detail. What is remarkable ahout
this DEMO is that, in effect, it
allows consumers to tailor tbe search
experience to their own needs.
How do consumers make their fi-
nal DEMO? After a consumer has
narrowed down the possibilities, he
or she must make a choice. Can you
make tbe selection process more
comfortable, less irritating, or more
convenient? Look for the ideal situa-
tion, in which competitors' proce-
dures actually discourage people
MANAGER'
from selcctmg their products, while
your procedures encourage people to
come to you. Citibank for years cap-
tured a significant share of the col-
lege student DEMO for credit cards
simply by making it easy for stu-
dents to obtain a card while com-
petitors made it difficult.
Another example of DEMO dynamic
is playing out right now in the used-
car business. For many potential
customers, the experience of choos-
ing a used car is an
ordeal - to the point
where one CEO of a
major DEMO ob-
served that some peo-
ple would rather bave
a root canal. But a new
method of selecting
cars is transforming
the industry. Compa-
DEMO such as CarMax Auto Super-
store and AutoNation USA bave tar-
geted the selection experience as
their competitive focus. At a Car-
Max showroom, customers sit in
front of a computer and specify what
features they DEMO looking for in an
automobile. Tbey can then, in pri-
vate, scroll through detailed descrip-
tions of cars tbat might meet their
needs. DEMO final (and only) price for
each vehicle is listed. A sales assis-
tant then lets the customers inspect
tbe autos that interest them DEMO
bandies all the paper-
work if they decide to
buy one. The "selling" is
done not by tbe salespeo-
ple but by tbe DEMO
process tbe customers
create for themselves.
How do customers or-
der and purchase your product or
service? Tbis question is particular-
ly important for relatively low-cost,
high-volume items. Can a company
differentiate itself by making DEMO
process of ordering and purchasing
more convenient?
American Hospital Supply revolu-
tionized its industry hy radically
simplifying the ordering and re-
stocking process DEMO such products
as bandages, tongue depressors, sy-
ringes, and disinfectants. DEMO com-
pany installed computer terminals

The terminals DEMO tbose cus-
tomers directly to tbe company's
system, allowing direct DEMO ship-
ment and automatic restocking
whenever supplies fell below a cer-
tain level. Hallmark uses a similar
approach for its greeting cards.
Many companies, including ice-
cream makers and pet-food manu-
facturers, are also using tbis method
to stock supermarket shelves, reap-
ing tbe benefits of preferred access

to these crucial outlets as well as
of superior displays. Anotber, more
subtle benefit of this form of dif-
ferentiation is that it DEMO a
switching cost on customers tbat
might be tempted to try another
supplier. Once customers have
signed on, it is expensive for them
to switch; tbis deterrent creates a
barrier to competition and, once
again, a potential strategic advan-
tage for the supplier.
How is your product DEMO service de-
livered? Delivery affords many op-
portunities for differentiation, espe-
cially if tbe product is an impulse
purchase or if the customer DEMO
it immediately. Let's return to our
catalog computer dealer, tbe DEMO
Connection. Customers can call its
toll-free number as late as 3 A.M to
receive "next-day" shipments of
items in stock. How does tbe DEMO
pany do it? The amazing turnaround
times are possible because the DEMO
housing and distribution facilities
are conveniently located near an
Airhorne Express bub. Packages can
be picked up at tbe warebouse,
transferred to Airborne, and shipped
to tbe customer in a matter of hours.
Not only DEMO tbis delivery strategy
constitute a real benefit for cus-
tomers, hut, because there are a lim-
ited number of opportunities for
sucb a DEMO connection,
competitors will find it hard to adopt
tbe same strategy,

What happens when your product
DEMO service is delivered? An often
overlooked opportunity for differen-
tiation lies DEMO considering what bas
to happen from tbe time a company
delivers a product to the time tbe
customer actually uses it. Opening,
inspecting, transporting, and assem-
bling products are frequently major
issues for customers.
That applies even to tbe delivery
of services. Consider how difficult it
can DEMO to get an auto accident claim
processed and paid by an insurance
company. Now consider bow Pro-
gressive Insurance of Cleveland,
Ohio, tackled the problem. Tbe
company has a fleet of claims ad-
justers on DEMO road every day, ready
to rush to the scene of any DEMO acci-
dent in their territory. There they
can record all the information they
need and often settle claims on the
spot for policybolders. The DEMO
has greatly increased customer satis-
faction by eliminating the hassle
and delay that so often accompany
conventional reporting, inspection.
and assessment methods. A side
benefit for the company is tbat its
approach also has decreased tbe DEMO
dence of fraud hy reducing tbe op-
portunity to file false claims and in-
flate repair bills.
How is your product installed?
This DEMO in tbe consumption chain
is particularly relevant for compa-
nies with complex products. For ex-
ample, installation has presented an
enormous barrier for computer man-
ufacturers trying to hreak into the
novice-PC-user market. Computer
beginners are DEMO intolerant
of sucb on-screen messages as "Disk
Error 23."
Compaq DEMO, with its Pre-
sario line, was among tbe first to tar-
get installation as a source of differ-
entiation. Instead of providing an
DEMO book filled with techni-
cal terminology, Compaq offers its
customers a DEMO that clearly illus-
trates the ten installation steps. Tbe
company uses color-coded cords, ca-
hles, and outlets to simplify installa-
tion further and DEMO has rigged its

computers so that DEMO cheerful video
and audio presentation leads new
users through the setup and registra-
tion process when they first turn on
the machine.
How is DEMO product or service
paid for? Many companies unwit-
tingly cause tbeir DEMO major
difficulties with their payment poli-
cies. Here's a test to see whether
payment might he sucb an issue for
your customers: Take a walk over to
your accounts-receivable depart-
ment and ask to see DEMO copy of a re-
cent invoice. If your company is
anything like ahout 80% of those
we have worked with, the invoice
will be virtually incomprehensible.
Why? Because invoices are generally
designed by systems people for sys-
tems, not customers . Given the
prevalence of this situation, DEMO
company may find opportunities to
set itself apart hy making the whole
paymen t process easier for cus-
tomers to understand.
You may discover DEMO greater op-
portunities by rethinking why your
company uses its current payment
policy in tbe first place. We once
worked with a company in DEMO ener-
gy control husiness tbat was having
a hard time selling its services to res-
idential co-op owners. At every co-
op, the company ran into opposition
from a hard core of owners who re-
sisted DEMO capital outlay involved in
installing an energy management
system. The company eventually
won a huge share of tbe co-op mar-
ket by altering its DEMO, Customers
no longer pay an up-front installa-
tion fee; instead, DEMO pay over time,
out of tbe energy savings.
How is your product stored? When
it is expensive, inconvenient, or
downright dangerous for customers
to have a product simply sitting
around, tbe opportunities for differ-
entiation abound. Air Products and
Chemicals, a producer of industrial
gases, DEMO to dominate its market
segments by addressing the prob-
lem of storage. Realizing that most

move pleased customers; it also gen-
erated switching costs. Best of all,
once an Air Products plant was in
place, competitors had httlc oppor-
tunity to move in.
How is your product moved
around? What difficulties do cus-
tomers encounter when they must
transport a product from DEMO loca-
tion to another? Whether the jour-
ney is across a DEMO or across a state,
this step in the consumption chain
is another often-overlooked oppor-
tunity for differentiation. Ask your-
self the following questions: Does
the customer find the product frag-
ile? Difficult to package? DEMO
to move?
Consider how John ScuUey's mar-
keting team at Pepsi-Cola used
packaging as a way to differentiate
Pepsi from Coke. Sculley'DEMO team cre-
ated a distinct-if temporary-advan-
tage for Pepsi in the early 1970s hy
designing plastic bottles that were
lighter, and thu s easier for cus-
tomers to carry, than the heavy glass
bottles of the time. The beauty of
the move was that it not only made
DEMO soda easier, but it also re-
duced the advantage of Coke'DEMO well-
known contoured glass bottle. At
the time, it was difficult DEMO produce
plastic bottles in that shape.
What is the customer really using
your product for? Finding better
ways for customers to use a product
or service is a powerful differentia-
tor. And such opportunities abound,

products are expensive and used
relatively infrequently. General Elec-

here. GE, for instance, bas an enor-

ple who have difficulty using any of

Similarly, Butterball Turkey's 24-

captured national DEMO in the
1970s when one of its store man-
agers "took DEMO" a set of tires from
a customer despite the fact that
DEMO did not sell tires. By fo-
cusing on and aggressively promot-

policy, Nordstrom has enhanced its
position as a company that provides
unique customer service. Customers

An ideal solution, used by Tan-

in which downtime is a major proh-
lem - is to DEMO to repair a product

Analyzing Your

Although mapping the consump-

ways interactin g wit h people,

Those interactions determine the
customer's feelings toward your
product DEMO service at each link in the
chain. When they are viewed strate-
gically, they can shape the dynamics
of competition for that custom-
er's business.
Essentially, this step involves con-
sidering how a series of simple ques-
tions-what, where, who. when, and
how-apply at each link in the con-
sumption chain. We have found that
tbe most rewarding DEMO to approach
this exercise is to have a group of
people from a company start down a
path with any of tbeir questions and
DEMO until their ideas dry up.
Sometimes a given question will not
lead to any particular insight. That's
not a problem; tbe goal is to assem-
ble an inventory of possible points
of differentiation. Once the DEMO
are on the tahle, you can assess each
one and select DEMO tbat are most
promising for your situation.

small niches in rapid succession
over time, gaining economies of dis-

Consider some of the
DEMO that Blyth em-
ployees uncovered when
they applied the questions
to their business:
What? What are cus-
tomer s doing at eacb
point in the consumption
cbain- What else would

Wbat problems could tbey be experi-

can DEMO a role in everyday life in a

things, they are used to celebrate

and set the mood for
romanti c evenings .
Candles DEMO be pur-
chased in specialt y
shops, at crafts fairs, in
supermarkets, and at
card stores. Further,
their use can be ac-
companied hy a huge
variety of containers,
displays, accents, and DEMO

the possihility of offering a complete

DEMO or marketing complementary

Your customer could be alone or

could be with a spouse or significant
other. Your customer DEMO could be
traveling with a group of people.
What else are your customers
doing when they buy gasoline?
Among other things, they might be
commuting, on a leisure trip, on a
business trip, on vacation, shopping, or
planning to use equipment [such as a
mower DEMO a tiller).

They also came up with a variety DEMO
ways to package the candles and
combine them with such accessories
as napkins to suit each situation.
Candles intended for use with fami-

ample, might be scented with cinna-
mon, colored in tones associated
with the holiday, and sold with spe-
DEMO holders.
Because there are many holidays
and other occasions when families
get together in the dining room, you
can hegin to get a sense of the oppor-
tunities available for dif-
ferentiation. Moreover, the
process can be repeated for
as many different compan-
ions and settings as the
DEMO of your em-
ployees can contemplate.
Blyth, for example, also
has found a tremendous opportunity
to differentiate its products for roman-
tic meals. DEMO Goergen has worked
hard to design scented candles in vari-
ous shapes in order to influence the
ambience of such occasions so that, as

dining becomes romance."

Think about how candles are used
outdoors - say, at a company barbe-
cue. Citronella candles come to
mind. In addition to creating DEMO fes-
tive atmosphere, they are an attrac-
tive way to protect DEMO from in-
sect bites.
As we've seen, there is consider-
DEMO potential for differentiation
even in products so simple that at
first blush they seem like commodi-
ties. Candles are but one. Gasoline is
another. (See the exhibit "Is There a

Among other things, your customer

Keeping those ideas in mind, consider

Too many companies pursue what
seem like great new ideas without
carefully assessing whether their
organizations are well DEMO to do

that Blyth Industries has certain

cluding several unique production
techniques and, more important, a
deep knowledge of DEMO

strengths, coupled with a
